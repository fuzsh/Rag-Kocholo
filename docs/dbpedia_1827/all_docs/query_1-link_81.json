For in-year admissions the Governing Body is required to abide by the maximum limits for infant classes [5, 6 and 7 year olds], ie, 30 pupils per class.\n\nEltham Church of England Primary School also operates a 26 place Full Time Equivalent nursery. The criteria for admission is below.\n\nAdmission to Nursery: September 2025\n\nLooked after children or previously looked after children (see note 1).\n\nChildren with an exceptional and professionally supported medical or social need for a place at this school (see note 2).\n\nChildren who, with a parent/carer, are faithful and regular (see note 3) worshippers at St John the Baptist Church, Eltham.\n\nChildren who, with a parent/carer, are faithful and regular (see note 3) worshippers at another Anglican church and reside within the Deanery of Eltham and Mottingham (see note 2).\n\nChildren who, with a parent/carer, are faithful and regular (see note 3) worshippers of another Christian denomination as recognised by the Churches Together in England or Evangelical Alliance and reside within the Deanery of Eltham and Mottingham (see note 4).\n\nAny remaining places will be given in order of nearness to the school (see note 5).\n\nPlease note: A place in the nursery class does not guarantee a place in the Reception class. All parents must follow primary admission procedures for admission to the Reception class.\n\nAdmission to Reception: September 2025\n\nSpecial educational needs\n\nParent(s)/carer(s) of pupils who have a statement of special educational needs, or Education, Health and Care (EHC) Plan are required to apply for school places separately through the local authority from whom advice is available. If a child with a statement, or EHC Plan, is placed in the school by the local authority before the normal admission round, the number of places available to other applicants will be reduced. The Governors will admit all those pupils whose statement, or EHC Plan, names the School.\n\nOversubscription Criteria\n\nLooked after children or previously looked after children (see note 1)\n\nChildren with an exceptional and professionally supported medical or social need for a place at this school (see note 2).\n\nChildren who, with a parent/carer, are faithful and regular (see note 3) worshippers at St John the Baptist Church, Eltham.\n\nChildren with a sibling (brother/s or sister/s, step siblings and half siblings, fostered or adopted siblings living at the same address) attending the main school at the time of the child’s admission. (Sibling priority will not be granted where the child in attendance at the school is in the Nursery class).\n\nChildren who, with a parent/carer, are faithful and regular (see note 3) worshippers at another Anglican church and reside within the Deanery of Eltham and Mottingham (see note 4).\n\nChildren who, with a parent/carer, are faithful and regular (see note 3) worshippers of another Christian denomination as recognised by the Churches Together in England or Evangelical Alliance and reside within the Deanery of Eltham and Mottingham (see note 4).\n\nAny remaining places will be given in order of nearness to the school (see note 5).\n\nNotes:\n\nNote 1: Looked after children or previously looked after children: A looked after child is a child who is (a) in the care of a local authority, or (b) being provided with accommodation by a local authority in the exercise of their social services functions (see the definition in Section 22(1) of the Children Act 1989) at the time of making an application to the school. A previously looked after child is a child who immediately after being looked after became subject to an adoption, child arrangements, or special guardianship order including those who appear (to the admission authority) to have been in state care outside of England and ceased to be in state care as a result of being adopted. An adoption order is an order under the Adoption Act 1976 (see Section 12 adoption orders ) and children who were adopted under the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (see Section 46 adoption orders). A ‘child arrangements order’ is an order settling the arrangements to be made as to the person with whom the child is to live under Section 8 of the Children Act 1989 as amended by Section 14 of the Children and Families Act 2014. Section 14A of the Children Act 1989 defines a ‘special guardianship order’ as an order appointing one or more individuals to be a child’s special guardian (or special guardians). The Governors will require written confirmation that the child is looked after, or previously looked after, and will be so at the time of making an application to the school.\n\nNote 2: Medical/social needs: Children with an exceptional and professionally supported medical or social need for a place at this school. This must be supported by written evidence at the time of application, e.g., from a specialist health professional, social worker or other care professional. The evidence must set out the reasons why this school is the most suitable school and the difficulties that would be caused if the child had to attend another school.\n\nNote 3: ‘Regular’ is where parent(s)/carer(s) and children attend the place of worship at least twice a month for the two years prior to the date of application. In the case of those who have moved to Eltham within that period, the criterion is extended to include a place of worship at the previous neighbourhood. Written confirmation of the applicant’s and child’s attendance at worship will be sought from the priest or minister of the Church.\n\nIn the event that during the period specified for attendance at worship the church has been closed for public worship and has not provided alternative premises for that worship, the requirements of these [admissions] arrangements in relation to attendance will only apply to the period when the church or alternative premises have been available for public worship.\n\nNote 4: The Deanery of Eltham & Mottingham’s parishes are St Barnabas, Holy Trinity, St John the Baptist, St Saviour (Eltham) St Luke (Eltham Park), All Saints (New Eltham), St Andrew, St Edward (Mottingham). Please see below for the map of the Deanery.\n\nNote 5: Measured in a straight line from centre of the child’s home address to the centre of the school\n\nTie breaker\n\nIn the event that two or more applicants have equal rights to a place under any of the above criteria and there are insufficient places, the Governing Body will use distance, in the first instance, to decide between applicants; if applicants live equidistant from the school the Governing Body will draw lots to decide between applicants.\n\nProcedures for late applications and in-year admissions will be in accordance with the LA’s scheme for the co-ordination of primary school admissions.\n\nThe school operates a waiting list which is drawn up in accordance with the admission criteria on which names will be held for 12 months after which you will be asked if you wish to remain on the list.\n\nParents who are not offered a place for their child have the right to appeal against the decision to an independent appeal panel in accordance with the School Standards & Framework Act (1998). Parent(s)/carer(s) wishing to appeal should obtain an appeal form from the school. The form should be sent to reach the Clerk of the Appeal Panel, care of the school, within 20 days of the date of the letter confirming the governors’ decision not to offer place. Should an appeal be unsuccessful, the Governing Body will not consider further applications from those parent(s)/carer(s) within the same academic year unless there have been significant and material changes in their circumstances.\n\nDeferred entry\n\nThe School admits children to the Reception class in the September of the school year in which a child attains the age of 5 years. (The school year runs from 1 September to the 31st August.) All parents/carers are entitled to a full-time place for their child in the reception class from September, but may defer entry until the beginning of the term after their child is five years old (ie, when the child reaches compulsory school age) or until the beginning of the summer term whichever is earlier.\n\nChildren may attend part-time until their child reaches compulsory school age. Parents/carers who have been offered a place at the School and wish to defer entry for their child and/or attend part-time must put this in writing to the headteacher at the earliest opportunity and before the start of the autumn term.\n\nFair Access\n\nThe School is committed to taking its fair share of pupils who are hard to place in accordance with the locally agreed fair access protocol. Pupils admitted under the protocol will take priority over any children on the waiting list and this may include, on occasion, admitting above the planned admission number.\n\nEducation out of normal (chronological) age group\n\nChildren are educated in school with others of their age group. However, in exceptional circumstances parents/carers may choose to seek places outside of their child’s chronological year group. Decisions will be made on the basis of the circumstances of each case. Parents/carers must state clearly why they feel admission to a different year group is in the child’s best interest. They may wish to provide recent professional evidence to support this. Further details of how to make such a request are available from the school.\n\nPlease note that in order for any application to be considered under criteria 3, 5 or 6 a Supplementary Information Form (SIF) must be completed and returned to the school office. All SIFs are then sent to the relevant Parish Priest or Faith Leader to be validated.\n\nApplications without a completed SIF or one that cannot be validated by the Parish Priest or Faith Leader, will be considered under criteria 7 ‘distance’.\n\nDownloadable documents\n\nAdmissions Policy 2025-2026\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY FORM – re ADMISSION TO RECEPTION September 2024\n\nDeanery of Eltham & Mottingham map\n\nIN YEAR ADMISSION APPLICATION FORM\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY FORM_Sep 23\n\nNURSERY_APPLICATION FORM_re Academic Year 2024_25"
