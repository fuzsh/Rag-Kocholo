She was created Duchess of Norfolk for life 29 Sep 1397.\n\nShe seems to have had two husbands, both of whom were dead by this time.\n\nHer grandson, Thomas Mowbray, would become Duke of Norfolk in 1397 and Earl of Norfolk in 1399. He was born in 1366.\n\nEarl of Warwick:\n\nTHOMAS de Beauchamp (before 16 Mar 1339-8 Apr 1401, bur Warwick, St Mary’s). He succeeded his father in 1369 as Earl of Warwick. m (before Apr 1381) MARGARET Ferrers, daughter of WILLIAM Ferrers 3rd Lord Ferrers of Groby & his first wife Margaret de Ufford Earl of Suffolk (-22 Jan 1407, bur Warwick, St Mary’s).

His father’s assets having been forfeited following his execution in 1326 (for supporting King Edward II against the Queen and Mortimer), Richard FitzAlan’s inheritance was restored in 1330 and he succeeded as Earl of Arundel, known as “Copped Hat”. He succeeded in 1347 to the estates of the Warenne family, on the death of his uncle John de Warenne 8th Earl of Surrey, although he only assumed the title Earl of Surrey after the death of the 8th Earl’s widow Joan in 1361.\n\nSucceeded by his son:\n\nRICHARD (1346-beheaded Cheapside 21 Sep 1397, bur Church of the Augustine Friars, Bread Street, London). He succeeded his father 1376 as Earl of Arundel. A member of the Council of Regency on the accession of King Richard II. He took an active part against the King with the Duke of Gloucester.

Created 1st Earl of Northumberland at the coronation of King Richard II 16 Jul 1377.\n\nEarl of Oxford:\n\nROBERT de Vere (16 Jan 1362-Louvain 1392, bur Louvain, transferred Nov 1395 to Earl’s Colne). He succeeded his father in 1371 as Earl of Oxford, Hereditary Master Chamberlain. He was created Marquess of Dublin for life 1 Dec 1385, and Duke of Ireland for life 13 Oct 1386. He was accused of treason after repudiating his wife, raised troops at Chester and marched to London but was trapped at Radcot Bridge 20 Dec 1387. He escaped down river, made his way to London and fled to Utrecht, then Paris and later Louvain. During his absence he was declared guilty of treason and all his honours and property were forfeited[923]. He died from injuries received during a boar hunt.\n\nEarl of Pembroke:\n\nJOHN Hastings (11 Nov 1372-Woodstock 30/31 Dec 1389, bur Hereford, Church of the Friars Preachers, transferred after Mar 1392 to Church of the Grey Friars, London). He succeeded his father in 1375 as Earl of Pembroke, and his mother in 1384 as Lord Mauny. He was killed while practising for a tournament. m firstly (Kenilworth Castle, Warwickshire 24 Jun 1380, annulled after 24 Sep 1383) as her first husband, ELIZABETH of Lancaster, daughter of JOHN “of Gaunt” Duke of Lancaster & his first wife Blanche of Lancaster (Burford, Shropshire before 21 Feb 1363-24 Nov 1425, bur Burford Church, Shropshire). She deserted her first husband, was seduced by her second husband, JOHN de Holand, later Duke of Exeter, whom she hurriedly married as she was pregnant. She married thirdly (before 12 Dec 1400) as his second wife, Sir John Cornwall.\n\nEarl of Kent:\n\nThomas de Holand, b. ([1350]-25 Apr 1397, became Earl in 1360 on death of his father. m (after 10 Apr 1364) Alice FitzAlan, daughter of Richard FitzAlan 9th Earl of Arundel & his wife Eleanor of Lancaster ([1350]-17 Mar 1416).\n\nThomas’s mother was Joan of Kent, the mother of the future Richard II. As his mother retained the title of Countess of Kent he didn’t become Earl until 1381. At the early age of sixteen he was appointed captain of English forces in Aquitaine, presumably to assist the ailing Black Prince, Richard II’s father. He became a Knight of the Garter in 1375. When Richard became king he grew rich through his influence on the young king.\n\nBetween them they had 10 children, all of whom were fairly young at this time.\n\nEarl of Norfolk:\n\nMARGARET ([1320/22]-24 Mar 1399, buried in Charterhouse, Smithfield, London or perhaps Greyfriars Church, Newgate, London). She succeeded her father in 1338[675] as Countess of Norfolk, suo iure (in her own right). She was created Duchess of Norfolk for life 29 Sep 1397. She also apparently inherited her father’s title of Lord Marshall, the only woman to have done so. She held the title until 1377, when Henry Percy was granted the position on Richard II’s coronation.\n\nShe was also know as Lady Manny and Lady Segrave, after her two marriages.\n\nHer first marriage was to Sir John Segrave, Baron Segrave, with whom she had four children. However, they sought a divorce in 1350 on the grounds that they had married when she was under-age. Obviously they didn’t realise this until they had time to conceive four children! Probably the real reason was that she had started an infamous affair with Sir Walter Manny, 1st Baron Manny. She illegally crossed the channel to see him in Calais – presumably he was serving as a soldier there at the time. The divorce was still not finalised in 1353 when Sir John Segrave died. Margaret married Manny a year later. Manny died in 1371 and she did not remarry.\n\nShe really sounds like a remarkable lady. In 1376 she would be 56 years old and had more than 20 years of life ahead of her. She must have been very independent and strong willed to have an affair, manage an Earldom’s estates on her own and also take on the ceremonial duties of Lord Marshall as well. The Lord Marshall was supposed to deal with matters of heraldry and genealogy, not light matters in an age of supposed chivalry.\n\nHer grandson, Thomas Mowbray, would become Duke of Norfolk in 1397 and Earl of Norfolk in 1399. He was born in 1366.\n\nEarl of Warwick:\n\nTHOMAS de Beauchamp (before 16 Mar 1339-8 Apr 1401, bur Warwick, St Mary’s). He succeeded his father in 1369 as Earl of Warwick. m (before Apr 1381) MARGARET Ferrers, daughter of WILLIAM Ferrers 3rd Lord Ferrers of Groby & his first wife Margaret de Ufford Earl of Suffolk (-22 Jan 1407, bur Warwick, St Mary’s). Earl Thomas & his wife had one child, Richard, born in 1382.\n\nThe Earl accompanied John of Gaunt in campaigns in France in 1373, and around that time was made a Knight of the Garter. In the parliaments of 1376 and 1377 he was one of those appointed to supervise reform of King Richard II’s government. When these were not as effective as hoped, Beauchamp was made Governor over the King. He brought a large contingent of soldiers and archers to King Richard’s Scottish campaign of 1385.\n\nIn 1387 he was one of the Lords Appellant, who endeavored to separate Richard from his favorites. After Richard regained power, Beauchamp retired to his estates, but was charged with high treason in 1397, supposedly as a part of the Earl of Arundel’s alleged conspiracy. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London (in what is now known as the “Beauchamp Tower”), pleaded guilty and threw himself on the mercy of the king. He forfeited his estates and titles, and was sentenced to life imprisonment on the Isle of Man. The next year, however, he was moved back to the Tower, until he was released in August 1399 after Henry Bolingbroke’s initial victories over king Richard II.\n\nEarl of Arundel and Surrey:\n\nRICHARD FitzAlan, son of EDMUND FitzAlan Earl of Arundel & his wife Alice de Warenne ([1313]-Arundel 24 Jan 1376, bur Lewes Priory, Sussex). His father’s assets having been forfeited following his execution in 1326 (for supporting King Edward II against the Queen and Mortimer), Richard FitzAlan’s inheritance was restored in 1330 and he succeeded as Earl of Arundel, known as “Copped Hat”.

Earl Hugh & his wife had fifteen children.One of which, Edward was father of EDWARD de Courtenay ([1357]-5 Dec 1419) who succeeded his grandfather in 1377 as Earl of Devon\n\nEarl of Oxford:\n\nROBERT de Vere (16 Jan 1362-Louvain 1392, bur Louvain, transferred Nov 1395 to Earl’s Colne).
