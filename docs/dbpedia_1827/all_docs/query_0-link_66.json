        "text": "In this chapell lies interr'd all that was mortal of the most illustrious and most benevolent John Paul Howard, earl of Stafford, who, in\n\n1738\n\n, married Elizabeth, daughter of A. Ewens, of the county of Somerset, esq. by Elizabeth his wife. eldest daughter of John St. Aubyn, of Alfoxton, in the same county, esq. His heart was as truly great and noble, as his descent; faithful to his God, a lover of his country, a relation to relations, a detester of detraction, a friend to mankind, naturally generous and compassionate, his liberality and charity to the poor were without bounds. We therefore hope, that at the last day, his body will be received in glory into the eternal tabernacles; being snatch'd away suddenly by death, which he had long meditated and expected with constancy, he went to a better life the\n\n1st of April, 1762\n\n, having lived\n\n61\n\nyears,\n\nnine\n\nmonths, and\n\nsix\n\ndays. The Countess Dowager, in testimony of her great affection and respect to her Lord's memory, has caused this monument to be placed here.\n\nHere lieth buried\n\nSir Bernard Brogas\n\n,\n\nthird\n\nson of air John Brocas who had a considerable command of archers at the siege of Calais in\n\n1349\n\n, and was a lineal descendant from sir Bernard Brocas the younger, son of the earl of Foix, in France, who came into England with the Norman king William, and in requital of his services had a grant of land in Hampshire to the then value of\n\nfour hundred pounds\n\nper annum, which he chose near Basingstoke, and thereon built a mansion-house and called it\n\nBeau-repaire.\n\nThis sir Bernard served in the French wars, and being afterwards sent against the Moors, overcame the king of Morocco in battle, and was allowed to hear for his crest a Moor's head crowned with an old eastern crown: his elder brother sir John being slain in an engagement with the French, near Southampton; and his\n\nsecond\n\nson Oliver, who was captain seneschal of Guienne and Aquitaine, and governor of Bordeaux, under king Edward\n\n3rd\n\n, dying without issue, sir Bernard succeeded to the paternal inheritance both in England and France, and having married Mary, daughter and heiress of sir John de Roch, had a large estate with her, and the hereditary post of master of the buck-hounds, which was confirmed to him by king, Edward the\n\nThird\n\n, and held by the family till sold in James the\n\nFirst\n\n's reign. He was chamberlain to Anne, Richard the\n\nSecond\n\n's queen, and his son a knight of the same Christian name, was carver to his said majesty; the son was\n\none\n\nof the conspirators against king Henry the\n\nFourth\n\nat Oxford, and was afterwards taken and executed at Cirencester, in Gloucestershire; and he himself having raised a considerable force on the same aide advanced to Reading, in Berkshire, which place refusing him admittance, he burnt a part of it, and made the rest his quarters, till on the retreat of the conspirators forces into Oxfordshire, sir Bernard's dispersing, be, with many of his adherents, became an easy prey to the townsmen of Reading, who executed several on the spot, but sent sir Bernard to London, where he was beheaded on\n\nTower-hill\n\nin\n\nJanuary, 1400\n\n."
