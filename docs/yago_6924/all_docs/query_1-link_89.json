        "text": "This photo of actress Raquel Torres was taken in the late 1920s or very early 30s. Isn't she beautiful? Her bobbed hair, her smoky eyes, her long strands of beads, her sultry stare. Raquel was a Mexican born American actress who's first starring role was in MGM's White Shadows of the South Seas in 1928. She was in several films in the late 20s and early 30s including Duck Soup with the Marx Brothers. Raquel abruptly retired from acting in 1934 after marrying New York businessman Stephen Ames. Torres died in 1987 at age 78."
