Mark Eddy's primary area of expertise is the development, refinement and rigorous testing of culturally informed multimodal preventive and clinical psychosocial interventions to improve physical and mental health outcomes for children and families. This work is done in collaboration with families and professionals from schools and other community-based service systems. Areas of interest include parent-child relationships; intimate partner relationships; family violence; parent management training; couples intervention; youth mentoring; early childhood education and family-based intervention; mothers and fathers involved with the juvenile justice or criminal justice systems and their families; children and families involved with the child welfare system; immigrant families; observational research; social interactional theory; coercion theory; cognitive behavioral therapy; longitudinal growth modeling; survival analysis; the development and refinement of effective communication processes between and among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in order to provide children and families with the most effective preventive and clinical interventions; training and mentoring the next generation of implementation and prevention scientists. Dr. Eddy will be reviewing applications in anticipation of taking a student for Fall 2024.\n\nMy Coping and Stress in Education Lab conducts research at the intersection of health, psychology, and education. The focus of our work generally is on promoting wellness and optimal functioning in educational settings. Current work includes studies on educator stress and wellness, focuses on understanding the stress that teachers and administrators experience and how to help them cope and thrive. We use both local and national samples of teachers and administrators to understand how stress impacts their occupational health and overall well-being. We also conduct research on group interventions, which is an effective way to help teachers identify and reduce the stress they experience in their work. Finally, we conduct research in Preventive Coping. Much of our work in this area includes the Preventive Resources Inventory, a measure of psychological assets that individuals can use to proactively cope with stress, particularly in the context of careers.\n\nMy principal methodological research interest deals with the various facets of model specification, including, but not limited to, model comparison/selection and model modification methods. With the use of simulation techniques, I examine the performance of these different model specification approaches under manipulated conditions. With the use of real data sets, I also provide illustrations and demonstrations of alternative model parameterizations for pedagogical purposes. There are numerous models that may be employed to explain the relationships among variables. I am interested in employing models within the structural equation modeling (SEM), multilevel modeling (MLM), and item response theory (IRT) arenas. My other research interest deals with real-world data applications with these various modeling techniques. This is, in large part, due to requests from applied researchers to help with the methodological aspects of their study given my knowledge in quantitative methods. I enjoy these opportunities to collaborate with researchers in different disciplines because real-world data issues provide me with methodological research ideas as well as interesting examples to use in my courses when I am teaching."
