He enjoyed sharing a common love of personal computers (PC’s) with his son. He served wherever he was needed in his church with a warm smile on his face. His greatest delight was his family; his loving wife, Mary, his children, Jennifer & Brad & his son-in-law, Jim and his precious grand-children, Evan & Emma.
