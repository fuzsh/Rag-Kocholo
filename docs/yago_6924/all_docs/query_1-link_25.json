It’s not often you find a cream chow, much less one with a pre- 1950’s starlet.\n\nI personally had not heard of Raquel Torres until I dug deeper to discover that she was best remembered for her roll with Groucho Marx, Chico Marx, Harpo Marx and Zeppo Marx in Duck Soup (1933).\n\nIt was Raquel who inspired Groucho’s classic line,\n\n“I could dance with you until the cows came home. On second thought, I’d rather dance with the cows until you came home.”\n\nAt time marker 2:41 you can see Raquel Torres in Duck Soup and hear the famous line\n\nRaquel Torres (born Paula Marie Osterman;[1] November 11, 1908 – August 10, 1987) was a Mexican-born American film actress. Her sister was actress Renee Torres."
