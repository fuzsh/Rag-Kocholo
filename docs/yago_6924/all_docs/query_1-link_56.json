You might be tempted to skip exercise (too tired), get takeout for dinner, and then turn in late because you’re uncomfortably full.\n\nIf this cascade of events happens a few times each year, no problem. Trouble is, more than a third of Americans aren't getting enough sleep on a regular basis. Yet experts agree that getting enough sleep is as important to health, well-being, and your weight as are diet and exercise.\n\nRead More\n\nIntermittent fasting restricts when or how much you eat — and sometimes both. One variation, time-restricted eating, involves eating only during a certain time window, usually eight hours, over a single day. For example, you would eat only during the hours of 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and then fast during the other 16 hours.\n\nRead More\n\nDiscipline is the ability to control and manage one's instincts, emotions, desires, feelings, and behaviors. It requires you to be well-organized. Discipline is the difference between talking and doing. It's being able to set goals and actually going for them while not forgetting about everything else that's on your plate as well.\n\nIt's about being able to be consistent and persistent in the face of challenges (and failures). And most importantly it's about replacing bad habits with better ones.\n\nRead More\n\nEndorphin comes from the words “endogenous,” which means within the body, and “morphine,” an opiate pain reliever.

Mindfulness-based treatments have been shown to reduce anxiety and depression. There's also evidence that mindfulness can lower blood pressure and improve sleep. It may even help people cope with pain.\n\nRead More\n\nRecent statistics show that 1 in 5 adults in the United States struggles with depression, and antidepressant medications are a common way to treat the condition. However, pills aren't the only solution. Research shows that exercise is also an effective treatment. \"For some people it works better than antidepressants, although exercise alone isn't enough for someone with severe depression,\" says Dr. Michael Craig Miller, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.\n\nRead More\n\n5 Ways To Improve Your Metabolism.\n\nMetabolism is a term that describes all the chemical reactions in your body.\n\nThese chemical reactions keep your body alive and functioning; the molecules are constantly changing shape, renewing and rearranging themselves to either build things (heal), use energy, or save it as fat.\n\nSports training can have a significant effect on metabolic rate – this can determine weight gain and weight loss. This is because it boosts calorie burning.\n\nRead More\n\n“Fear is the biggest disability of all. It will paralyze you more than being in a wheelchair”. Nick Vujicic.\n\nTough people handle difficult situations with strength and grace. They stay positive instead of letting criticism rule their day. Being mentally tough is essential to staying positive, happy, and for moving forward, for many of us it doesn’t happen overnight, it takes practice and time; after consistent work we become braver not less afraid.\n\nRead More\n\nDoctors, scientists and dermatologists talk about the several benefits of sweating, is the way the body and the skin protect itself from overheating. Sweating also increases the blood circulation and the drips of sweating is the proof of our body's built- in mechanism to keep it cool while open up and unclog the pores, the dropples consist primarily of water, also sodiums, chloride and potassium to an extent.\n\nRead More\n\nAlways have long and short term goals. Having goals motivates us to work hard and including short term goals ensures that victory can be savored regularly. This provides a greater motivation to push hard to achieve long term goals. For example, writing goals on an agenda or whiteboard and looking at them every day has a positive effect since this constant visualization keeps you motivated and 100% focused on achieving each goal. Setting clearly defined goals will help you monitor your progress and give you constant motivation.\n\nRead More\n\nI write this with the intent to share my story, passion, efforts, obstacles, high and lows with the objective to inspire others to fight for their dreams, and to be better at whatever they love and in all areas as human beings.\n\nRead More\n\n“Wheresoever you go, go with all your heart…And remember no matter where you go, there you are.” Confucius\n\nThe power of visualizing your goals, any goal.\n\nIf you want to increase the likelihood of reaching your goals and dreams, visualization is where it all begins.\n\nRead More\n\nHere me sharing some good things I discovered using a Garmin for my triathlon training and how it improved my life in so many ways. I am shy or we can call it insecure when it comes to blogging, because a lot of reasons or excuses, the normal feeling we all have at some point when you are a beginner.\n\nRead More\n\nWhen the temperature drops and the snowy days come, a lot of triathletes take the season off, but some, those who still have goals and races, need to train, no matter the weather conditions.
