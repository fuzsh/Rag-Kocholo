        "text": "Raquel Torres\n\nPrimary Discipline: Tri/Multi-Sport\n\nOther Disciplines:\n\nBirth Year: 1981\n\nCity Of Residence: Cincinnati\n\nFavorite Race: Local triathlons or running races, because they can be exciting and more relaxing.\n\nBiggest Accomplishments\n\nFor me this is hard to answer, but I can say that I feel honored that after having my daughter Chantal and graduating with an MBA (In a second language in another country) with a 100% scholarship, I came back to sports and handled to be competitive for around 7 years as a professional triathlete with the support of organic sponsors. Competing internationally in more than 30 Elite & ITU events in 3 continents, in around 100 events, in different cities, states and countries from ITU to full IRONMAN. Some of my many personal achievements that I feel proud of are: -As a kid I won 3 international events also with the support of organic sponsors; Aruba International triathlon 1996 and 2 Junior Panamerican Triathlon Championships: Costa Rica 1997 and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico1998. -At the age of 15 years I competed as elite at the Central American Games in Venezuela finishing top 10. (The youngest female) -Dominican Triathlon Champion for around 10 years. -Qualified for the Toronto Panamerican Games 2015, 3 Triathlon ITU World Series and a few world cups based on points earned at Pan-American ITU Ranking. -Top 5 in several Panamerican ITU Cups from 2013-2018. -Top 20 Overall at IRONMAN 70.3 Dubai in 2017 at Pro Cat with a PR of 4:32.54. -8th place at Pro Cat at IRONMAN Louisville 2018. with a PR of 9:51:46. -Top 3 Overall at Ironman 70.3 Super Frog 2019 & Qualified for the Ironman 70.3 World championship. And many other small victories in swimming, running and local triathlons.\n\nAdvice\n\nFocus on yourself, do it for you not to impress anybody, do not compare to others rather than your past self. Find and stick to a good coach or mentors like I did, I know that part can be the hardest :)"
