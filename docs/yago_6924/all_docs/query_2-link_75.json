        "text": "Per that same review, bar owners and patrons are attributing the uptick to the rising need for queer and transgender-inclusive spaces amidst a flurry of anti-LGBTQ legislative attacks as well as an evolution towards messaging that is more inclusive of the full spectrum of the LGBTQ community within sapphic spaces. Also credited with generating this momentum is the fundraising campaign and documentary film Lesbian Bar Project, which features bars that are also included in the seven-minute NBC Out documentary with which the program will begin.\n\nThis event—a screening followed by panel discussion—will bring together leading advocates, bar owners, and community members to discuss efforts to counter the downward trend as well as the significance and evolution, from Stonewall to today, of the lesbian bar as a vital LGBTQ community space\n\nPanelists:\n\nWanda Acosta (she/her) is a stalwart icon in lesbian nightlife in downtown New York. She has been creating and producing events in New York City for 30 years. She was an owner of WonderBar, Starlight, and Clubhouse in Manhattan’s East Village. She also hosted and curated lesbian events at Bar d’O, The Box, Angels and Kings, BLVD, Liquids, NYC, Clit Club, and recently at The Ace Hotel, The Jane Hotel, and Hotel Hugo. She has worked with a diverse range of clients and media, including The New Festival (New York Gay & Lesbian Film Festival), Mix NYC (New York Gay & Lesbian Experimental Film/Video Festival), Showtime’s The L-Word, Miramax Films, Tribeca Film Festival, Twist/Columbia Records, fashion/art magazine Visionaire, and non-profit organizations such as GLAAD, Empire State Pride Agenda, Astraea Foundation, Hetrick-Martin Institute and The Center.

In 2021, Nobody’s Darling was a James Beard Award finalist. She lives on the south side of Chicago with her wife and many cats. She is a corporate attorney by day with expertise in advising corporations in highly regulated industries, including insurance, technology, construction, engineering, and real estate. But her main passion is helping others. Angela stands at the intersection of race, gender, and sexual orientation to help guide the strategic thinking and direction of the nonprofit organizations for which she has had the privilege of serving as a board director, including Center on Halsted, Chicago Coalition for the Homeless, GLAAD Chicago Leadership Council, and SGA Youth & Family Services. She co-founded SHE100, a philanthropic giving circle of lesbian and queer women supporting organizations throughout Chicago.

She feels passionate about inviting everyone to the conversation. She is proud to have been named the first Inclusion Ambassador to the LGBTQIA+ community for the Dallas Mavericks in 2018.\n\nStacy Lentz (she/her) is an LGBTQ+ activist, speaker, and Co-Owner of the Stonewall Inn, which became the birthplace of the modern gay rights movement after the Stonewall Riots in 1969.
