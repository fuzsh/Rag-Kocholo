        "text": "Torres selected from 278 nominees\n\nIndianapolis- The Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) announced Tuesday morning 20 student-athletes named to the 2017 Allstate WBCA and NABC Good Works Teams®. Metropolitan State University of Denver women's basketball senior, Raquel Torres (Vallejo, Calif./Jesse Bethel H.S.) was selected out of over 270 nominees. The award is given to 20 men and women for their accomplishments off the court.\n\nTorres has volunteered for numerous organizations and programs that help give back to her community. During this past spring as a member of the MSU Denver Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, Torres coordinated and ran an end of the year awards show for the MSU Denver Athletic Department, the \"Rowdy Awards.\" The award ceremony was the first of its kind at MSU Denver and recognized and identified numerous student-athletes on their accomplishments after the conclusion of the 2016-17 season. She secured a venue for the event, created award categories, a voting system, and decorated the venue. The event proved to be a huge success for not only SAAC but the athletic department as a whole. Later that spring, Torres volunteered for Girl's Inc. of Metro Denver where her team and herself spent hours painting fresh coats of paint in rooms at the facilities, as well as clean up litter around their campus. She also spent time volunteering with Team Impact in the spring, where she coordinated events that helped recognize the Team Impact children. While volunteering Torres organized a \"Team Impact Day\" at the MSU Denver baseball game against Colorado School of Mines. The Team Impact kids were recognized before the game and were awarded the \"Most Inspirational\" award at the Rowdy Awards ceremony.\n\nThe next summer, Torres spent over 40 hours volunteering at Berkley Manor Care Center in the activities department. She assisted residents with multiple activities during the day that included playing bingo, spa day manicures, yarn club, bowling, arts and crafts, bracelet making, and baking.\n\nDuring the Fall of 2016, Torres was named President of SAAC. She led the committee as a voice to speak out about issues and solutions involving intercollegiate athletics and student-athlete experiences. She transformed MSU Denver SAAC by helping put together on campus events for student-athletes such as; student-athlete socials, BBQ's, tailgating events, award shows, and student-athlete support days. Torres headed the committee during the NCAA Division II's \"Week of Wishes\", which supports the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Torres was also a part of MSU Denver's \"It's On Us\" campaign to raise awareness about consent and bystander intervention.\n\nTorres has been and continues to be a role model for fellow student-athletes and the numerous people surrounding her. Her selflessness has made a difference on her team, in the MSU Denver athletic department, and her community.\n\n\"We are absolutely thrilled for \"Rocky\" being named to the Allstate WBCA Good Works Team®,\" said MSU Denver head coach Tanya Haave. \"On the court, Rocky has battled numerous injuries throughout her career at Metro State, but that has not deterred her from making a huge impact on the community at large in Denver and on SAAC at MSU Denver. The initiatives Rocky has introduced to our program have had a positive impact on the culture of the whole athletic department. She is also working selflessly and endlessly to help others less fortunate that herself. I cannot think of a more deserving person for this prestigious award. I'm so happy and proud for her as she is an ideal representative of Metro State Women's Basketball and Athletic Department.\"\n\nThe Allstate WBCA and NABC Good Works Teams® are each composed of 10 student-athletes; including five from NCAA® Division I, and five from NCAA Divisions II, III and the NAIA. This year, sports information directors and coaches at colleges and universities across the country submitted a record 278 nominations, and in December 2016, 97 nominees from the WBCA and 181 nominees from the NABC were announced.\n\nMembers of the 2017 Good Works Team will be recognized during the 2017 WBCA Convention and at the 2017 NCAA Women's Final Four in Dallas, as well as participate in a local project in the Dallas community.\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#10 Raquel Torres\n\nG\n\n5' 6\"\n\nSenior"
