Shortly after his arrival, he found Owen and asked him for the medication. Owen refused to provide it, as he risked his medical license for doing so and hadn't met Rosie. When John threatened to report him if he didn't give John the drugs, Owen and Teddy offered to help John and Rosie establish residency in Seattle, allowing her access to physician-assisted suicide. John refused this offer, saying that he and Rosie didn't want their children to know and she didn't want to spend her time moving and filling out paperwork. When Owen still refused, John went to Bailey and reported him and Teddy.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nRomantic[]\n\nHe is married to Rosie.\n\nFamilial[]\n\nHe and Rosie have at least two children."
