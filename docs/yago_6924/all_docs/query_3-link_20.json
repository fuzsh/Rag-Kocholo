        "text": "Post by anns on\n\nSeeking information on John Hall, wives & children.\n\n1.My search starts with John Hall b Ludgvan 15/12/1841\n\nHe married a Mary Johns in South Australia 15/4/1865…\n\nOn the marriage cert John is 22 & Mary 19…….John`s father is listed as John Hall (Miner), Mary`s father is listed as a James Johns. …..\n\nOn their son John`s birth cert (1868) they both list their birth place as Cornwall England….I have not been able to thus far find when either John or Mary arrived in Australia.\n\nThey had a daughter Elizabeth Ann b 1865 & a son John b 1868 both born in Australia, I can trace the tree here in Australia to the present day.\n\n2. John Hall b 1815 d 1855 seems to be the next in line, he married Mary Anne/e Williams b ?\n\nJohn & Mary were married 27/01/1840 in Ludgvan witnesses were Richard Hall & Zacharias Williams, John`s father is John Hall (Miner) & Mary`s Zacharias Williams (Miner)……….I believe Richard may have been Johns brother!\n\n3. John Hall b ? I believe married Joan Sampson ( b 1791?) 13/08/1814 Ludgvan.\n\nI would be interested to hear about any of these families, their children etc…….especially the Halls\n\nanns\n\nPost by Cornish Terrier on\n\nAnns - the first thing we need to establish here is whether we have the correct parents for John Hall.\n\nDo you have a Death Certificate or any other document that confirms his mother was Mary Ann Williams?\n\nI ask this because if you look at the 1851 Census you will find two John Halls born about 1841/2 and in each case the father was John.\n\nOne is at Ludgvan son of John and Mary Ann so is the one you have mentioned but the other is at Gulval and was son of John and Margret Hall.\n\nIf you have something that confirms Mary Ann Williams as the mother of your John it will save us being led down a garden parth.\n\nCT\n\nPost by Cornish Terrier on\n\nHi Anns - okay, well the 1851 Census shows the two John Halls I mentioned.\n\nOne is at Ludgvan with parents John and Mary Ann . He was born 15th December 1841 and baptised 23rd January 1842 at Ludgvan.\n\nThe second is at Gulval with parents John and Margret. This John Hall born at Gulval and was baptised at Carfury Chapel on the Penzance Bible Christian Circuit 15th June 1842.\n\nBoth are good matches given the details you have supplied so it may not be easy to determine which is the right one.\n\nGiven the notoriety of transcriptions for the Census Indexes it is possible that there may be more possibilities and we don't know for sure that your John came from the West of Cornwall.\n\nThese two are a good start anyway so we need to probably work on them to see if one or other (or both) can be eliminated.\n\nNo luck so far with Mary Johns in the Census so I will keep looking for her.\n\nCT\n\nPost by Cornish Terrier on\n\nWell Anns - it looks like I can safely eliminate one John Hall.\n\nUnfortunately the one I can eliminate is the one you thought was your connection.\n\n1851 Census\n\nTreassowe, Ludgvan\n\nJohn HALL, head, mar, 35, tin miner, Ludgvan\n\nMaryann do., wife, mar, 35, miners wife, Ludgvan\n\nJohn do., son, 9, scholar, Ludgvan\n\nMary Jane do., daur, 7, scholar, Ludgvan\n\nZacharias do., son, 5, scholar, Ludgvan\n\nJohn son of John and Mary Anne Hall of Treassowe baptised 23rd January 1842 Ludgvan (born 15th December 1841)\n\nMary Jane daughter of John and Maryanne Hall of Treassowe baptised 14th January 1844 Ludgvan\n\nZacharias William son of John and Mary Ann Hall of Treassowe baptised 12th April 1846 Ludgvan\n\nAnn Maria daughter of John and Mary Ann Hall of Treassowe baptised 14th January 1849 Ludgvan\n\nAnn Maria daughter of John and Mary Ann Hall of Treassowe baptised 9th November 1851 Ludgvan\n\nPhilip Henry son of John and Mary Ann Hall of Treassowe baptised 5th June 1853 Ludgvan\n\n1861 Census\n\nCrowlas, Ludgvan\n\nMary Ann HALL, head, widow, 45, domestice, Ludgvan\n\nJohn do., son, unm., 19, tin dresser, Ludgvan\n\nMary Jane do., daur, unm, 17, stamps girl, Ludgvan\n\nZacharias do., son, unm, 15, tin miner, Ludgvan\n\n1871 Census\n\nWheal Baddern, Kea\n\nJohn HALL, head, mar, 29, Agent, Wh.

Dist.\n\nAs you can see from the baptisms of the children above they were all resident at Treassowe, Ludgvan when baptised. By 1861 John senior has died and son John is still living at Ludgvan with his mother and two surviving siblings.\n\nIn 1871 John Hall age 29 was married and living at Kea. But the most important thing here is that he has stated his birthplace as Treassowe, Ludgvan.\n\nBy this time your John Hall had been in Australia for at least six years.\n\nNext step now is to see if we can track the movements of the John Hall born at Gulval to see if he might be the man you are looking for.\n\nCT\n\nPost by Cornish Terrier on\n\nSt Ann Cornwall\n\nAnn - how difficult to read is the writing on that Certificate? Is there any chance that John's birthplace could be something else?\n\nI see that the family moved to Victoria but I cannot find any death record for a John Hall that might match in Victoria\n\nIf there is any other little piece of information that you might have tucked away it could be handy and if it is possible to send me a copy of that Birth Certificate I might be able to make something more of it.\n\nIf that is possible there is a little Email Icon just under my Avatar. Just move your mouse cursor over it to see which one.\n\nDo you have any idea of when or where John might have died?\n\nCT\n\nPost by Cornish Terrier on\n\nHaving now seen a copy of the certificate I requested I did a little research.\n\nThe name of John Hall's birthplace does 'look like' St Ann but ......... it could be St Ann, St Anne or St Anns.\n\nSt Anns Chapel is in Calstock Parish and not far from Gunnislake and there was a John Hall born there in 1841. He appears to have been baptised in 1842 but to parents Richard and Ann.\n\nThinking more on that name reminded me that St Agnes is/was often pronounced 'St Annes' so I dug a little further and found:-\n\nJohn son of John and Ann Hall of Menagizzy baptised 15th March 1843 at St Agnes\n\nJohn Hall married Ann Rosewall at St Agnes 23rd July 1835\n\nI found a total of five children baptised at St Agnes to John and Ann with Lavinia (1846) being the last.\n\nAs John Hall was married in South Australia I decided to see if any of these other children might also have found there way to that part of the World. Lo and behold there was a Marriage for a Lavinia Hall (daughter of John) to Richard Semmens TREVORROW!\n\nThis was right back in my alley having begun to look into the Trevorrow family a couple of months ago!\n\nProblem was that Lavinia was age 15 when the 1863 marriage took place when she would have been 17 had she been the girl born at St Agnes.\n\nSo a check of the South Australian Birth Index was in order and ................ Livinia daughter of John Hall and Ann (nee ROSEWALL) was born at Montacute, SA, 22nd January 1848. And another five children were born to John and Ann in South Australia after Lavinia.\n\nIt looks very much now that I have found a home for Ann's John Hall.\n\nFurther checiking found a couple of marriages in South Australia and then the family moved to Victoria.\n\nCT\n\nPost by anns on\n\nWell it is a start thank you CT. Leaves me with lots of work to put it all together.\n\nI have emailed a document to you asking if you think it might possibly be the registration of Ann Hall nee Rosewall`s birth. It says she was born in 1815 which would make her approx. 21 when their first child was born & 45 when the last child was born here in AU. See what you think!\n\nSecondly in a search I found the following info on Johns family that may fit my timetable....\n\nJames Johns aged 43 b 1810\n\nHannah Johns aged 29 b 1824\n\nJoseph Johns aged 9 b 1844\n\nMary Johns aged 6 b 1847\n\nCharles Johns aged 1 b 1852\n\n(all approx years as we know they might not be true & correct)\n\nIn August 1853 emmigrated on a ship named the Bore. (Code F; Fishe 013; Page 1)\n\nMary being 6 at the time & would make her 18 y o in 1865 when she married John Hall in Wallaroo S A.\n\nWhich would mean both John & Mary came out as children. ??\n\nanns"
