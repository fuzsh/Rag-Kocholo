        "text": "John Hall matriculated at Queens’ College Cambridge in the Michaelmas Term 1589, graduated B.A. in 1593/4, and M.A. 1597 (as Hale). He married Susanna, daughter of the playwright William Shakespeare, 1607 June 5.\n\nHe became a successful physician, practising around Stratford-upon-Avon, and kept case notes. In later life, he prepared the case-notes for publication in Latin. After his death in 1635, his widow sold his manuscript to James Cooke (1614–​88), who translated the case-notes into English and published them as Select Observations on English Bodies of Eminent Persons in Desperate Diseases in 1657, with further editions in 1679 and 1683: evidence of demand for them.\n\nThe reputation that Hall enjoys today, thanks to the continuing interest in his published case-notes, would be just as strong had he not been related to the playwright, but he is fated for ever to be referred to as: Shakespeare’s son-in-law.\n\nFurther reading\n\n1657: Select Observations on English Bodies: or, Cures both Empericall and Historicall performed upon very eminent Persons in desperate Diseases.
