        "text": "The Beati Paoli are, perhaps, the most mysterious citizens of Palermo, so mysterious we don’t even know if they existed. For more than five centuries, their name and the legend surrounding it has permeated the streets of Sicily’s capital, with some believing not only that they existed, but that they were the archetype of the island’s infamous mafia. Others, however, relegate them to the realm of pure literature and lore.\n\nWhere is the truth? And why the fascination with this secretive organization, rooted in the baroque past of beautiful Palermo?\n\nReal or not, the city embraced the Beati Paoli with warmth, as shown by the large amount of streets and shops bearing their name around town. But who were they and, most importantly, did they even exist?\n\nTheir first attestation dates to the 18th century, when the Marquis of Villabianca publishes the Opuscoli Palermitani, or the Palermitan Pamphlets. Here, the nobleman collected oral tales he had learnt as a child about a secret sect that worked to protect the weak against injustice. Indeed, the Marquis – full name, Francesco Maria Emanuele Gaetani – was adamant the Beati Paoli was a sect founded in 1180, that had been acting in secret since. Its name, he continued, was inspired by its members’ devotion to San Francis of Paola, while the adjective beati (blessed) was added because of their habit to wander from church to church dressed like monks. During the night, however, the Beati Paoli would cover their heads with dark hoods and, when needed, become vengeful: indeed, they were also known locally as the vendicosi.\n\nBut who were they? Well, tradition says the group was largely formed by men from the lower classes who, masked and hidden by darkness, would take revenge against the injustice perpetrated by the rich against the poor and the weak of the city.\n\nAs all sects and secret societies, the Beati Paoli had a secret meeting place, which could become, when needed, also a tribunal to decide about the fate of their enemies. According to tradition, they used to gather under the Mercato del Capo, in Palermo, in what used to be an ancient Punic necropolis that developed, with galleries and secret tunnels, between the church of Santa Maria di Gesù – locally known as Chiesa Santa Maruzza dei Canceddi, and located in what is today known as Piazza dei Beati Paoli — and the Grotta of Vicolo degli Orfani. It is believed that the church’s crypt held the door to a hidden passage that led directly to the secret chambers of the Beati Paoli’s see, the Grotta, likely a room in Palazzo Baldi-Blandano.\n\nFor the most curious among us, part of the Beati Paoli’s secret enclave can be accessed and visited today through a small door in Vicolo degli Orfani.\n\nIt’s all very mysterious, isn’t it? And it couldn’t really be otherwise, because historical information about the sect is very little. The Beati Paoli reached true popularity at the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the work of Sicilian writer and journalist Luigi Natoli who, under the name pen of William Galt, had his novel I Beati Paoli published in 239 installments in the Giornale di Sicilia between the 6th of May 1909 and the 2nd of January 1910. Natoli’s narrative, inspired of course by the legendary adventures of the secret sect, mixes together fiction and reality, presenting among its characters also historical figures. Natoli was also particularly careful in reconstructing in detail the society around his protagonists, basing his descriptions on historical treatises like Antonio Mongitore’s Diario Palermitano and Giovanni Evangelista di Biasi’s Storia dei Viceré di Sicilia. His novel was so popular that, in 1947, it became also a movie, I Cavalieri dalle Maschere Nere (The black masks’ knights), directed by Pino Mercanti, a famous Italian screenwriter and director of those years.\n\nBecause of their mysterious nature and the lack of factual information we have about them, it shouldn’t surprise that even more legends developed around the already legendary Beati Paoli. One of the most notorious wants them as the ancestors of the Sicilian Mafia, a theory in part based on the fact that, after the killing of New York police lieutenant Joe Petrosino in Palermo (1909), it emerged that Mafia members had begun meeting in secret in the very same spot tradition wanted the Beati Paoli to meet centuries earlier. It was infamous Cosa Nostra boss Tommaso Buscetta who, some seventy years later, fed the fire of curiosity when stating that “Mafia (…) goes way back… first, there were the Beati Paoli (…): we sworn the same oath, we have the same duties.”\n\nIn spite of Buscetta’s words, no historical link between the sect and organized crime has ever been discovered, adding an extra layer of mystery to the already mysterious life of the Beati Paoli of Palermo."
