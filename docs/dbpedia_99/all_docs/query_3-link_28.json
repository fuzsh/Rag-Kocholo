        "text": "This paper interrogates familial devotion and its relationship with parts of the house other than the chapel. In detail, it aims to problematize the issue of the devotional/non-devotional use of paintings inside the house by moving the focus from this dual opposition to the active role of canvases, broadly defined. Informed by Jacques Derrida’s and Pierre Bourdieu’s writings, this paper argues for the structural nature of the paintings inside the house and their meaningful correlation with both the arrangement of the domestic interior and the practices of people experiencing those spaces. To do this, the paper challenges the overwhelming attention paid by early-modern scholars to Northern and central Italy and investigates a precise case study, i.e., Palazzo Scordia in Palermo (Sicily). The research draws upon primary sources and amongst these, upon two detailed inventories of furniture referring to two subsequent generations of an aristocratic clan residing in Palermo between the seventeenth and the eighteenth century, i.e., Ercole and Giuseppe Branciforti, princes of Scordia.\n\nWhile general historiography portrays Renaissance women as submissive, the extensive female patronage promoted at the Villa of Poggio Imperiale in Florence during the years of the Medici Grand Duchy of Tuscany (1569-1737) provides the grounds to reassess scholars’ theories. Isabella de’ Medici, Maria Magdalena of Austria and Vittoria della Rovere are the female counterparts to the male Grand Ducal patronage at Palazzo Pitti. They inhabited the Poggio Imperiale and devoted time and resources to advocate their status as ruling women and female patrons. Be it through the commission of sculptures or frescoes, or through the inheritance of paintings or furniture, the villa was evidence of a genuine passion for the arts and a striving for legitimacy. After providing a general background of the debates which surround studies on Renaissance gender issues, I have dedicated one chapter to each of the three Medici women who contributed to the architectural and artistic growth of the villa: Isabella de’ Medici will be addressed for her interests in late-Renaissance sculptures as well as for establishing the tradition that bound the villa to female personalities; Maria Magdalena of Austria is remembered for giving the villa its current name, for formally dedicating it to the Grand Duchesses of Tuscany, and for promoting major structural changes and a fresco cycle of outstanding meaning; and, the thesis argues, Vittoria della Rovere’s contribution concentrated on the quantity of artworks which she collected and on her celebratory fresco. Thus, the ultimate goal of this thesis is to study the collections of the Villa of Poggio Imperiale and their influence on the architecture of the villa through its Medici female patrons.\n\nThe apartment created for Eleonora di Toledo in the Palazzo Vecchio properly extended to the floor above the her own quarters. In renovating and adapting space for the duchess’s needs in the former priors’ palace, significant attention appears to have been given to the question of where to house the duchess’s ladies-in-waiting and the allocation of space for their work and pastimes. This paper reconsiders the use of space in the palace by the women of Eleonora’s entourage in an attempt to better understand their daily life there. Special attention is given to the iconography of Vasari and Stradano’s decoration of the Sala di Gualdrada, a room generally presumed to have been reserved for the use of Eleonora’s ladies.\n\nBe it for longer or shorter periods of their lives, many early modern Italian male aristocrats experienced living without a female presence. 1 Many brothers, especially members of the clergy but also other unmarried males, occupied an apartment within the house of the firstborn, or of whomever would inherit the family estate. In some cases, up until the diffusion of primogeniture in the second half of the sixteenth century (but in others even later), two or more brothers shared the family house or the insula where they had separate residences with their own entrance. 2 The part of the house belonging to the prelate in the family, especially where this was a cardinal's court, would be occupied mainly and sometimes exclusively by men, assisted and served by other men, be they churchmen, secretaries, butlers, chaplains or servants. In the last few years, the scope for research in the history of masculinity has widened and this Special Issue on 'Men at Home' is clear evidence of this. Research has been concentrated in particular (but not exclusively) on the figurehead of the family and on marriage, showing how this was just as crucial a moment for men as it was for women. 3 Masculinity has been primarily read through the categories of authority, domesticity and household production, suggesting that 'becoming a man' coincided with being able to support a domestic unit, by protecting it and providing for it. But this was not the only possible model of masculinity. 4 Growing up in the aristocracy meant being able to curb one's impulses and displaying such virtues as gentility and courtesy. This essay, while examining the domestic space of certain unmarried men in seventeenth-and eighteenth-century Rome and Siena, seeks to highlight a kind of masculinity that differed from that of the married head of the family. Some Italian prelates pursuing a career within the Roman Curia often gained remunerative positions in the Papal City and would rent apartments where they held court; these were in fact both public and private dwellings. As the seat of an elected male monarch since the return of popes from Avignon at the beginning of the fifteenth"
