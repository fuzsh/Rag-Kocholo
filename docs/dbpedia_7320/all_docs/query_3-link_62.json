        "text": "Kourtney Kardashian has joined husband Travis Barker on the Australian leg of his Blink 182 tour. It’s the first time the reality star and Poosh founder has visited the country—and her first international trip with her newborn son, Rocky, who arrived into the world on November 1.\n\nKardashian, 45, cut a wife-of-a-rockstar silhouette—oversized tee, tailored pants, black shades—as she hit up all of Sydney’s hot spots, particularly those in and around Sydney’s East. If you’re visiting the city, let us take you on Kardashian’s Tour de Bondi so you too can explore the best of Bondi.\n\nBills, Bondi Beach\n\nArguably the best breakfast spot in Sydney, Bills has been serving up its famous scrambled eggs and ricotta hotcakes for 30 years. Its founder, the late Bill Granger, opened his first Australian café in Darlinghurst in 1993 and inside, it had a central communal table which welcomed locals, travellers and families alike. The Bondi Beach location is a popular choice. Kourtney Kardashian was spotted there recently for lunch with two of her children ordering up on the hotcakes, the grass fed beef burger and a pasta dish—and was super impressed with the restaurant’s Jeanneret-style chairs, evidently!\n\nFunky Pies, Bondi Beach\n\nThis café is one from Kardashian’s dreams. Its pies, pastries and sweet caramel slices are vegan and dairy and gluten free. The reality star and her husband were spotted at the humble hot spot on Glenayr Street recently and stopped to take photos with fans. The menu comes with a full ingredient and nutrition breakdown, too, and if you’re not in the area, you can order online or shop a nearby stockist. They are delicious!\n\nMimi’s, Coogee\n\nCoastal fine dining at its most eloquent. A Merivale hallmark, executive chef Jordan Toft has created an incredible Mediterranean-inspired menu served against the rolling waves of Coogee beach. Kourtney Kardashian, two of her children and her security team were spotted here recently. This handsome space also houses a wine and tapas bar called Una Más and a cocktail bar called Will’s. All winners.\n\nBondiTony’s Burger Joint, Bondi Beach\n\n“Never thought I’d see Travis Barker and Kourtney at Bondi Tony’s! But I guess everyone needs a bit of BTs goodness,” BondiTony’s owner Tony Gosden wrote on Instagram the day the famous American couple visited his venue. Gosden used to manage, tour with and promote bands; The Jezebels, Gang of Youths, Sticky Fingers, Dune Rats, Lost Valentinos, the list goes on. So it seems fitting, then, for Barker, the drummer in rock band Blink 182, to visit this famous Bondi establishment where menu items are named after the bands."
