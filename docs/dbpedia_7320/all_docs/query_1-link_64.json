        "text": "Outsourcing has been around for decades, however companies are now finding in a high inflation, low growth environment that outsourcing is the key to sustaining and growing profits. If you are thinking about reducing operational cost in your business and improving efficiency, outsourcing could be perfect for your business. Outsourcing typically relates to the process of hiring your full or part-time agents offshore. The Philippines and Colombia are both considered leading countries for outsourcing with incredibly high rates of education, amazing, hard working cultures and well established infrastructure for remote teams. BruntWork helps small and large companies establish remote teams in record time and has large clients who are listed (as well as many smaller ones). Let us help you outsource to the Philippines, Colombia and beyond and find the perfect employee to fit your business.\n\nGreat English, hard working attitude, university education and a friendly demeanor are the main qualities we look for. We also ensure they have a quiet space to work in, high spec computer and fast internet access.\n\nOutsourcing services include everything you might possibly dream of. One of the most important qualities we look for is time management skills so we can ensure your tasks are completed efficiently. BruntWork agents possess excellent communication skills (both verbal and written). Before we undertake our recruitment process we check knowledge of the tools you use most commonly.\n\nWhat your outsourced agent can do is limited only by your imagination and capacity to train. Some agents we’ve placed manage calendars and inboxes, undertake research and manage LinkedIn profiles for lead generation, customer support, telemarketing & more. They can create spreadsheets, update, and audit websites, build and optimise online product listings. Our agents are trained to ensure that communication with your customers is timely and professional. Apart from this, if you have any other need, you can tell them and they make sure to get the work done for you.\n\nThere are so many benefits to outsourcing agents to offshore to countries like the Philippines, Colombia and beyond. Firstly Filipinos and Colombians love working for foreign companies, as it allows them to work from home, avoid the traffic and work a day shift which is the preferred mode of employment in both the Philippines and Colombia. We find that virtual assistants hired by BruntWork report high levels of employee satisfaction and the benefit to you are substantial cost savings that can support your business expansion.\n\nOne understated benefit is the mental freedom associated with ceasing tasks that suck your creativity. With this new mental clarify, you can dream up new ideas to help your business expand and run more efficiently.\n\nOur recruitment process is not dissimilar to an on-shore recruitment process except our labour pool is 5x bigger than your labour pool on-shore. Together, the Philippines and Colombia have over 150m population, so for every role we advertise, expect 10x the number of applicants. But don’t worry, we take care of all the hard work for you, vetting candidates for English & Spanish, aptitude and skills and surface only those candidates that we expect are going to perform well for you and your company. We’ll ask you to provide a brief with specifics about your business needs, we’ll use that as the basis to surface relevant clients and then we’ll shortlist the best for an interview with you. If you prefer, you can conduct the final interview. For whatever reason if a candidate doesn’t work out, we’ll do the hard work of exiting them and replacing them with a better candidate.\n\nOur staff are “work from home” however if you have sensitive data we can implement security measures to make sure your data is private and secure, including remote desktop solutions. We take copies of employees drivers licence, passport or other identifying information so that if something happens, we have full recourse to pursue them for damage that occurs to your business (although this has never happened to us before). We can require an NDA before onboarding based on your preference. We are fully compliant and certified to ISO 27001."
