        "text": "Whore of the Orient is a canceled game from Team Bondi and Kennedy Miller Mitchell, planned to be released for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. It was a spiritual successor to L.A Noire.\n\nYou would play in 1930s Shanghai and the game would use the motion scan technology that was first used in L.A Noire. From leaked gameplay in 2013 it showed that the game had a focus on hand to hand combat, but still retained the usual cover shooting mechanics found in L.A Noire.\n\nIn November 2011, during an interview with Eurogamer, writer and director Brendan McNamara described the game saying “It’s pretty interesting. It’s one of the great untold stories of the twentieth century. So I think it’ll be good”\n\nWhen Team Bondi sought a publisher for Whore of the Orient, it was reported that no one was interested due to claims of poor working conditions during the development of L.A Noire. When Team Bondi closed it’s doors in 2011 its assets were sold to Kennedy Miller Mitchell where development continued, and Warner Bros Interactive had taken interest in the game, but later abandoned the project in 2012.\n\nIn 2013 it was rumored that the game had been put on hold and in June of the same year it was reported that Kennedy Miller Mitchell had revived $200,000 of funding from an investment board. It was then reported that Whore of the Orient was set for a 2015 release date, but that never happened and we would not hear anything more about the game until 2016. In June of 2016, in an interview on the GameHugs podcast, former producer Derek Proud was asked “so will we ever see that game” and he replied “I don’t think so“.\n\nThere are still screenshots of the game on the internet, the aforementioned 2013 leaked footage of the game can also be found online.\n\nArticle by Nathan Coe.\n\nImages:\n\nVideos:\n\nWhat do you think about this unseen game?
