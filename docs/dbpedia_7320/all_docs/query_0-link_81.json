        "text": "Bondi\n\nConstantly rated as one of the top beaches in the world, Bondi has become known as the quintessential Australian beach. Bondi is renown for its surf, devoted lifesavers, and reputation as the birthplace of the Speedo. There’s plenty to see & do as restaurants, bars, boutiques, and swimwear shops encircle the beach.\n\nHighlights:\n\nBondi Markets\n\nOpen Sundays, Bondi Markets are located at the Southern end of Campbell Parade. There is always a crowd at these markets and the vendors sell everything from flowers to homemade crafts and household items. It’s most crowded in the afternoon when the beach crowd is on its way home. For fresh fruit & veg, head to the same location on a Saturday and visit the Bondi Farmers Markets.\n\nIcebergs\n\nCarved into the Bondi rockface, Icebergs is a natural wonder overlooking the water. For a more casual meal or a few drinks, pop into the Icebergs Club Bistro. If you’re after fine dining with a killer view, make a reservation upstairs at Icebergs Dining Room.\n\nThe Bucket List\n\nTacos, burgers and quirky cocktails in a vibrant, colourful environment with outdoor beachfront seating."
