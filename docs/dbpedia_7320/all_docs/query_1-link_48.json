        "text": "What is it? It's a chance to step inside Australia's most iconic building, granting you access to (almost) every corner of this architectural wonder.\n\nWhy go? You'll get to explore the theatres (providing there isn’t a show in session) – from the majestic Concert Hall to the quaint Drama Theatre. You’ll be regaled with the secrets and stories that go on behind the curtain. There's even an immersive experience that celebrates the past, present and people of our city's most famous building.\n\nDon't miss: As well as entertaining all the musical aficionados, the Opera House caters to the foodies of Sydneytown with their 'Taste of the House' tour, which takes place on the last Sunday of every month.\n\nWhat is it? This secret garden, with full views of Sydney Harbour Bridge, is part public, part private land at the foot of artist Brett Whiteley’s home in Lavender Bay.\n\nWhy go? For years, the land was tangled, overgrown and strewn with rubbish, but when Whiteley died in 1992, his widow, Wendy, channelled her grief into creating a place of enchantment. Sydneysiders come to escape the busier parks and enjoy a picnic in the hidden oasis.\n\nDon't miss: The chance to snap a pic of Sydney Harbour surrounded by towering fig trees and native plants.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Locals use it every day on their commute to work, but the Manly Ferry voyage is an impossibly beautiful treat.\n\nWhy go? While the motors chug soothingly, enjoy the scenery of Sydney Harbour as it glides by, taking you past the bridge, Sydney Opera House, Taronga Zoo and harbourside beaches such as Shark Beach and Camp Cove out to one of the city’s most popular beachside suburbs, great for bars, restaurants, shopping and snorkelling.\n\nDon't miss: We suggest you hop off and explore part or all the Manly to Spit walk for spectacular views of the north and south headlands.\n\nWhat is it? A sunrise kayak tour with glorious photo opportunities that’ll make your hungover friends incredibly jealous.\n\nWhy go? Along with their passionat team of kayaking guides, life and business partners Laura and Ben Stone run daily dawn tours that make the most of Sydney Harbour before most people turn over on their pillow and hit snooze. The harbour water is velvety smooth, and the kayaks are very stable so you don’t need to work hard to paddle around Luna Park and into position as the sunlight hits Sydney Opera House.\n\nDon't miss: Flat whites never tasted more satisfying than when you're bobbing under the bridge, paddle under arm and wrangling a camera for that perfect Instagram shot.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A chance to scale the world-famous 'Coathanger'.\n\nWhy go? Yes it's pretty spenno, and yes it's very touristy, but it really is a breathtaking sight, beholding the Sydney Harbour in all its majesty. If you're short on time, the express climb is a little shorter and takes you up the inside structure so that you are surrounded by hand-riveted steel and feel a little like you’re inside the ribs of a metal skeleton. However, if you can we recommend you go all-in with the latest addition to the BridgeClimb's offering: scaling the full arch of the Harbour Bridge from end to end.\n\nDon't miss: This is an incredible experience at dawn or dusk, as the day's first rays and final embers light up the horizon.\n\nWhat is it? Deep within the Royal National Park is a sandy oasis that has to be seen to be believed. You can take a swim in the emerald waters of the creek-fed lagoon, which is also a great spot for snorkeling, or simply lay back against one of the cabbage tree palms with a good book. If you’re a budding shutterbug, the Wattamolla Waterfall may well rank as one of the most photogenic natural wonders anywhere in the Greater Sydney region and that's really saying something.\n\nWhy go? While this beach is popular with locals in the know, its location, very much off the beaten track of the city and harbour beaches, flies under the radar of most.\n\nDon't miss: Be sure to take the short bushwalk to Providential Lookout to snap some dramatic shots of the rugged sea cliffs. What makes this little slice of paradise extra impressive is that you’ll also find great facilities here, thanks to the well-equipped picnic area, so bring along some snags and grill up some lunch on one of the public barbecues.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A not-for-profit zoo with harbourside views featuring 4,000 animals from koalas and echidnas to giraffes and elephants.\n\nWhy go? You're guaranteed sightings of many Australian animals, plus threatened species. The zoo runs talks and animal encounters daily – and is home to what is arguably Sydney's most out-of-the-ordinary luxury hotel.\n\nDon't miss: Taronga Zoo boasts some of the best harbour views in the city, and as you walk along its wide, snaking paths you’ll spot the Bridge and Sydney Opera House as often as you spot the wildlife.\n\nWhat is it? The harbourside MCA is the go-to venue for cutting-edge art on a local and international level.\n\nWhy go? The Museum of Contemporary Art often hosts exhibitions by huge international artists, including heavyweights like Anish Kapoor, Yoko Ono and Grayson Perry.\n\nDon't miss: The MCA has a rooftop café and sculpture terrace with superb views of Circular Quay, including the Harbour Bridge and Sydney Opera House.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Perched 83 storeys above the streets of the CBD, this quirky, retro-futurist cocktail lounge is among the highest places to drink in Sydney, located on the second-to-highest floor of Sydney Tower.\n\nWhy go? The views of Greater Sydney from the Golden Bucket are simply jaw-dropping, stretching all the way to the Pacific horizon in the east, Ku-Ring-Gai Chase National Park in the north, the Blue Mountains in the west, and Cronulla in the south. Though Sydney has its share of beautiful rooftop bars, it's hard to find a place to drink with vistas as impressive as these.\n\nDon't miss: Because you're sure to work up an appetite gazing at all those delicious views, why not book a table at Sydney Tower's revolving restaurant, Infinity, one floor above Bar 83?\n\nWhat is it? One of Australia’s foremost cultural institutions holding significant collections of Australian, European and Asian art. And now it has the huge new addition of the Sydney Modern section – a spectacularly beautiful, award-winning space\n\nWhy go? The gallery presents nearly 40 exhibitions annually, and there are workshops, talks and film screenings each week – most of which are free to access.\n\nDon't miss: The aforementioned new Sydney Modern Project (named Naala Badu to honour the traditional custodians of the land, the Gadigal people). It's seriously up there with the most impressive modern art galleries in the whole world\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The only cageless shark diving experience in Sydney. You can join a colony of grey nurse sharks on a 30-minute diving experience in Darling Harbour.\n\nWhy go? Though the grey nurse sharks range from one to three metres long in the tank, they’re placid creatures and do very little other than give you a curious side eye as they swim by. The biggest benefit of diving with them at the aquarium, rather than in the open ocean, is the guarantee of seeing so many sharks in one spot.\n\nDon't miss: The colony of king and gentoo penguins who also call the aquarium home.\n\nWhat is is? It’s the most photographed ocean pool in Australia – at Sydney’s most famous beach. The 50-metre saltwater pool a popular spot for sunbathers and a bottleneck spot on the Bondi to Coogee walk.\n\nWhy go? The baths have been a landmark of Bondi for almost 100 years, and it’s only $9 for casual entry – giving you access to the pool and sauna.\n\nDon't miss: If you're splashing out, it's worth heading upstairs to Icebergs Dining Room for a cocktail and bowl of crab risotto with the best view in town.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Surfing a wave at Bondi should be on everyone’s bucket list. If you’re rusty with a surfboard, book in for a class at Let’s Go Surfing.\n\nWhy go? The school prides itself on the popular two-hour beginners’ course, which goes through the essentials of water safety (including Bondi’s dangerous rips), paddling and how to catch a wave. Each lesson starts on the sand, so you can ask embarrassing questions without fear.\n\nDon't miss: After your lesson, head to one of North Bondi's excellent cafés like Porch and Parlour or Harry's Bondi.\n\nWhat is it? A one-hour guided tour of the Royal Botanic Gardens where you'll learn about the Indigenous history of the land. You’ll learn about how the Gadigal people lived and worked with the seasons before the area was colonised.\n\nWhy go? Stingless bee colonies, climbing Moreton Bay fig trees and juicy Davidson plums are just a few of the natural wonders you’ll see (and taste) on this tour of Sydney’s harbourside horticultural oasis. You’ll walk by some of Sydney’s most famous landmarks as you trail around the fringe of the city looking back out to the Opera House, Mrs Macquarie's Chair and the Harbour Bridge.\n\nDon't miss: You’ll also learn about the deep connection to seasonality – when wattles are in bloom you’ll know that whales are migrating, while stingless bee colonies act as natural barometer.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Sydney's ittiest-bittiest tequila bar, somehow squeezed into a repurposed carport down a CBD laneway, and Time Out's 2020 pick for the best place to drink in the city.\n\nWhy go? Its Margarita is, without doubt, the best available in Sydney, and dare we say, the whole of Australia. The secret? A shaken 50/50 blend of Mexico-made tequila and mezcal, poured over shaved ice and finished with orange oil.\n\nDon't miss: If your experience of tequila (and its cousin mezcal) is slamming a nasty, eye-watering shot in the pub, allow the smooth-as-silk varieties here to change your mind about this all-too-often underrated spirit.\n\nWhat is it? The state-of-the-art, four-floor gallery brings together 21st century Chinese art, with a rotation of four key exhibitions throughout the year.

Home to the Sydney Theatre Company, the Wharf Theatres occupy Pier 4/5 on Hickson Road in the Walsh Bay Arts Precinct. Many of STC's productions are staged here but it's also where its offices and rehearsal studios are housed. The entire facility recently underwent two years of upgrades, making it one of the most cutting-edge theatre spaces in Australia.\n\nWhy go? The city's flagship theatre company, currently under the artistic direction of visionary theatremaker Kip Williams, is without question one of the most important theatre companies in the world. You cannot call yourself a cultured Sydneysider until you've seen one of this company's incredible productions.\n\nAlannah Le Cross\n\nArts and Culture Editor, Time Out Sydney\n\nWhat is it? A multi-level heritage-listed pub slash nightclub slash cocktail bar slash wine bar and shop on Broadway.\n\nWhy go? After closing in 2014, the Abercrombie reopened in December 2022 as several venues under the one roof (an actual party palace), and with a 24-hour licence. Take that, lockout laws!\n\nDon't miss: Casa Rosa, their cocktail bar and terrazza rooftop that's all about dancing on the tables through to the early morning. Think DJs spinning Italo-disco tunes, Italian-inspired cocktails, and Mediterranean-style dining. It's on level 2.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Sixty minutes from Sydney’s CBD, Dharawal National Park has stunning scenery and until recently public access to the bushland was restricted. Now you can enjoy guided tours of the park every second Saturday of the month.\n\nWhy go? Guiding the way will be an Aboriginal Discovery Ranger, who will share local knowledge about flora and fauna, as well as Dreamtime stories that connect Indigenous Australians to the area.\n\nDon't miss: Enjoy a short bushwalk and then picnic at Minerva Pool – a sacred women’s place for the Dharawal People (only women and children may enter the pool).\n\nWhat is it? This small but mighty cocktail lounge isn't just one of Sydney's best watering holes. It's been the highest-ranking Australian bar on the prestigious 50 Best Bars in the World list four years on the trot.\n\nWhy go? Yes, the mixology skills here are a cut above, but where Maybe Sammy really rules the roost is with its incredible hospitality.

And every carefully crafted cocktail has some kind of playful sleight of hand that adds a little bit of magic to your order.\n\nDon't miss: The signature cocktail menu is packed with fruit-forward crowd-pleasers that are sophisticated and complex but never challenging.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? On the leading edge of the South Head, you'll find one of Sydney's cutest lighthouses overlooking the calm waters of Camp Cove.\n\nWhy go? With the vast expanse of the mighty Pacific Ocean to the east and stunning city views to the west, a visit to this beautiful corner of the city is bound to leave you awestruck. You can make a day of it too, by taking the South Head trail from Watsons Bay. It's an easy amble, and you can reward yourself for that lill' bit of cardio with a drink or two at the Watsons Bay Hotel afterward.\n\nDon't miss: If you're travelling in from the city, catching the ferry from Circular Quay to the Watsons Bay terminus is a must. Not only will it get you to your destination swiftly, but it'll also treat you to a whistlestop stickybeak tour of the bougie harbourview residences that line the foreshore.\n\nWhat is it? Sydney has developed a thriving craft brewery scene, ever since Young Henrys came along in 2012.\n\nWhy go? The Australian beer landscape is now truly world class, and while we’re pretty darn spoiled for choice when it comes to places to drink craft beer in this city, there’s something special about going straight to the source. So leave the car keys behind and set aside an afternoon to make tracks to these excellent establishments pouring the top brews in town.\n\nDon't miss: The Marrickville brewery circuit. Although there are craft breweries dotted around Sydney, from the south and up to the Northern Beaches, inner western suburb Marrickville has a strong concentration of top picks – from Grifter, to Batch, Hawke's, Philter, Wildflower, Sauce Brewery, Stockade and relatively new entry, Mixtape. You can easily make a whole day of it in this single suburb.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? A neighbourhood shrine to seafood that's become an international dining destination for fish fanatics.\n\nWhy go? Young gun chef Josh Niland is doing revolutionary things with the ocean's finest: dry-aging, using eyeballs to make chips and making pure magic out of offal.\n\nDon't miss: Head in for lunch if you want to catch the almighty sea urchin crumpets or sea urchin brioche doughnuts – served depending on availabilty. Last service at the Oxford Street outpost will be on July 21, 2024 – then they'll be moving round the corner to an ambitious new space (complete with on-site hotel).\n\nWhat is it? The Sydney Jewish Museum is a beautifully and respectfully curated space that humanises history and invites visitors to look at the present with new understanding. There is a misunderstanding that the Sydney Jewish Museum is only meant for Jewish people to visit, or only of interest to WWII buffs. In reality, the museum makes history accessible through the lens of the Jewish experience, and in doing so, gives us new perspective.\n\nWhy go? It doesn't just keep important Jewish history alive; it reminds us about the potentially world-shattering danger of prejudice, hate and marginalisation of any group of people. It's one for the whole family.\n\nDon't miss: The Reverberations: A Future for Memory exhibition. Thanks to AI, you can have a one-on-one, interactive conversation with the now-deceased ‘Happiest Man on Earth’ Eddie Jaku and other Holocaust survivors at this extraordinary experience.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

In case you didn’t quite process the words written above: World’s. Best. Gelato. You’ve got 26 flavours to choose from every day, including sorbets.\n\nDon't miss: The mandorla affogato is the one that wowed the judges, but the strawberry balsamic panna cotta is a dazzler, too.\n\nWhat is it? A boutique, 60-seat cinema in Surry Hills where you can catch the latest indie releases as well as cult film screenings, attend weekly movie trivia nights and hang out in the golden age-inspired basement bar.\n\nWhy go? The building was constructed in 1940 as the offices of Paramount Pictures. Two vintage projectors remain on the premises, although the new cinema uses a digital projector.\n\nDon't miss: High-quality cinema snacks are offered in the adjoining bar – expect the finest choc-tops in Sydney, and some mighty fine cocktails.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Peter Gilmore’s inventive Australian dining institution, and a long time feature on Time Out's list of Sydney's top restaurants\n\nWhy go?

It’s the perfect pre-or-post-show feed.\n\nWhat is it? Tranquility might not be the buzzword that springs to mind when you think of the Western Sydney suburb of Auburn, but it’s the right descriptor for this 9.2-hectare oasis, bursting with lush greenery and exotic flora.\n\nWhy go? The gardens are broken down into themed areas that include a Japanese garden, complete with a pond, waterfall and ornamental bridges. Past the Japanese garden is the Reflection Pool, then the scented garden, the sunken rose garden, a billabong, native rainforest and a playground that has full wheelchair accessible equipment, including a liberty swing.\n\nDon't miss: Seek out the fauna reserve and aviary where you can commune with peacocks, Cape Barron geese and red-necked wallabies. Each year the Gardens also host a major flora festival, the Cherry Blossom Festival in August.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?

Each creation defies conventional explanation, fusing flavour and theatre in perfect sync.\n\nWhy go? PS40 co-owners Michael Chiem and Thor Bergquist have applied a jaw-dropping level of forethought and ingenuity to their craft. No bar commits to reinvention with more conviction than PS40 and that any idea or theme is just an excuse to let these gifted imaginations run totally free.\n\nDon't miss: If you're not in the mood for booze, PS40 also manufactures its own bespoke line of sodas.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nOcean pool by day, wedding venue by night, the heritage-listed baths that sit below the Maroubra to Bondi coastal walkway have changed little since they were built in 1907. The idyllic spot was born from one man's passion for the ocean: champion long-distance swimmer Henry Wylie obtained a special lease below the high-water mark to build the seawall and raised boardwalk.\n\nWhy go?\n\nFor a beach day sans sand that feels like stepping back in time.\n\nDon’t miss\n\nThe kiosk serves a limited menu that’s perfect for days in the sun – the salad roll is a perfectly crafted masterpiece.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The Darling Square-based little sister to the legendary and dearly departed late-night Chinese restaurant Golden Century, this buzzing diner is a must for anyone who considers themself a lover of Cantonese cuisine.\n\nWhy go? While the restaurant that inspired it fell foul of the lockdowns, XOPP has remained true to its legacy, with a menu that heroes live seafood and swift (if sometimes stern) service.\n\nDon't miss: The pipis in XO sauce, the signature dish at Golden Century that inspired its spin-off's name (say each letter slowly, one at a time) are likely to be one of the best things you've ever tasted. Yes, that's a big call, but we're yet to be proved wrong.\n\nWhat is it? It's 26 kilometres of national park with stunning coastline walks, secluded beaches, natural rock pools and rock formations that are Insta-worthy.\n\nWhy go? Whether you want to swim, trek, picnic, bike ride or just GTFO of Sydney for the day, the Royal National Park will provide an outdoors, adventure-filled day away. Tread with caution at hot spots like the Figure Eight rock pools, and watch some from a distance (cough, Wedding Cake Rock, cough).\n\nDon't miss: Whale watching season runs from May to November and the Royal National Park is one of the best places to catch a glimpse of these majestic creatures on their migration.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? These coffee pioneers were the first in Sydney to extol the virtues of bean provenance and production. In the 18 years since they first opened, they've firmly cemented a reputation as Sydney's ultimate utopia for coffee enthusiasts.\n\nWhy go? Come for the coffee, but stay for the impressive range of gourmet brunch options, many featuring a laundry list of native ingredients like saltbush, strawberry gum, macadamia, kangaroo and Davidson’s plum.\n\nDon't miss: When in Rome, drink coffee like the Romans do. Don't mess around with a flat white – it's Single O's espresso game that really stands it apart, so make sure you order the strong stuff.\n\nWhat is it? It's the largest island in Sydney's harbour and set at the junction of the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. It's been a film set, a jail, a shipping yard and home to some exceptional arts and culture festivals.\n\nWhy go? Because it has so much history. Before 1839, when a prison was built to house convicts from Norfolk Island, it was covered with red gums and was almost certainly an Aboriginal fishing spot. The island had a brief stint hosting an industrial school for girls and a naval training ship for boys. However, the island was mostly used for shipbuilding and repairs. Today, the island is run by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, which runs different types of tours.\n\nDon't miss: There are campsites, glamping packages, apartments or heritage holiday houses to choose from if you want to extend your trip to the storied island.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? This easy, breezy 1.8km walk rewards visitors with stunning views of the harbour for not a lot of effort.\n\nWhy go?

When it opened in 1892, the Strand Arcade was regarded as the very latest in shopping-centre architecture. It's still one of the most beautiful thoroughfares to visit today.\n\nWhy go? The narrow, multi-level shopping arcade houses premium Australian fashion designers, including Jac+ Jack, Lover, Sass & Bide and Dion Lee. Plus, you can find vibrant and distinctive jewellery from local brand Dinosaur Designs and natural beauty products at Aesop.\n\nDon't miss: The very dapper hat collection at Strand Hatters. If you came to Australia without sufficient head protection, staff will sort you out with a stylish Akubra, Brixton or Panama.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? The watering hole that kick-started our ongoing love affair with hidden cocktail bars and forever raised the (figurative) bar in Sydney’s bar scene.\n\nWhy go? Even now, after all these years, making your way through the dark tunnel and down the stairs at the back of the laneway is still a little bit of a thrill. And the service remains nothing less than impeccable.\n\nDon't miss: The jaw-dropping collection of whiskies now stretches to more than 1,000 labels, and the bar is now open 4pm-3am every single night, so let the good times roll.\n\nWhat is it? Situated on the North Head just south of Manly, Sydney's former quarantine station is now a hotel and corporate retreat. But try telling that to the many ghosts that supposedly roam its grounds. Q Station's ghost tours are hugely popular and pepper your scares with some fascinating local history.\n\nWhy go? If you weren't interested in learning about the quarantines of yore before 2020, you might be now. Q Station was on the frontline of the last global health emergency in 1918, and the rich history of this heritage-listed site offers a fascinating lens on the experiences of the past year.\n\nDon't miss: Of all the ghoulish stops on the Q Station ghost tour, one is feared above all others: the gravedigger's cottage. Some seriously scary experiences have been reported within its walls, and this creepy dwelling is said to have Sydney's most haunted bathroom.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? It’s the most resolutely Aussie joint in town. There’s no room for cultural cringe, because at the Unicorn they have a deep and enduring love for Australiana.\n\nWhy go? Get amongst the Jatz crackers and French onion dip, or a proper free-range, hormone-free schnitzel. They cook it right – a very hot pan to get that crisp, caramelised shell, and a liberal hand with the seasoning.\n\nDon't miss: There’s also darts, pool and live DJs will provide a good old fashioned disco soundtrack for Saturday night boogie.\n\nWhat is it? Of any bar in the city, few can boast a view as iconic as the Opera Bar. But that's not the only reason to go here. There are multiple venues to sample, live music and DJs most nights and unbeatable people-watching opportunities.\n\nWhy go? Beauty and convenience don’t always go hand in hand, but Opera Bar is a glam exception to the rule. It manages to be both one of the most enviably located bars in the city as well as its most advantageous spot for a pre-show drink.\n\nDon't miss: The neighbouring venue, House Canteen, is an all-day diner serving baked goods in the morning and a pan-Asian menu from lunch until late.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it?\n\nShelly Beach feels like a secluded island in comparison to the huge stretch of sand that is Manly Beach. Here, the waves are calmer, the sunbakers are quieter and the mood is more chilled. Getting here is a short cycle or walk around Cabbage Tree Bay and along the walk many people stop and take a seat on the rocks or take a dip in the aqua-coloured Fairy Bower Pool. It’s a nature reserve, so the whole area is protected – you’ll likely spot equally protected water dragons along the walk, basking in the sun.\n\nWhy go?\n\nFor a dreamy beach day with a spectacular harbour sunset.\n\nDon’t miss\n\nShelly Beach is a popular place to snorkel or learn to dive. Take a dip and have a look out for the famous Blue Gropers in this area.\n\nWhat is it? This weekly market is a Sydney institution, providing the freshest seasonal produce from the best growers and producers from around NSW.\n\nWhy go? It’s imperative that you do not eat before you visit the Carriageworks Farmers Markets. You’ll want to save maximum belly space for your personal version of The Bachelorette where you decide who gets your dollars and what delicious produce gets to come home with you. You can spend a whole lot of money if you want to here, but equally, you could just grab a kombucha on tap and find a chair for some of the best dog-watching in the city.\n\nDon't miss: Maybe you like something soupy and savoury first thing? In that case, go for the pho stand for a traditional Vietnamese start to the day. Maybe you like something soupy and savoury first thing? In that case head to Bar Pho for a traditional Vietnamese start to the day. On the veggie train? Hit up Keppos St Kitchen for a falafel breakfast, or head to Food Farm for a classic bacon and egg roll.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? It takes a chef of rare skill to perfect a complex dish, but a true genius in the kitchen to elevate a dish to legendary status that essentially has just one main ingredient. People queue down the street every weekend to get a taste of these light-as-a-feather, pillowy eggs, and for good reason.\n\nWhy go? Surry Hills, and Sydney in general for that matter, is far from short on brunch options but Bills is widely considered to be the OG venue for brekkie in the city. And it's not just the scrambled that they nail here – the corn fritters are another tried and true crowd-pleaser.\n\nDon't miss: If you can manage your timing just so, try and snag a seat at one of the outdoor tables. Not only will you get some grade-A people watching along Crown St, but you can also enjoy being the envy of everyone still waiting in line.\n\nWhat is it? One of Sydney's few legal nude beaches, so if you're feeling the au naturale vibe, then shed some layers here. You'll need to park up the hill and walk a fair way to get here – it's at the bottom of a long series of steps, and as far as beaches go, she's a small one. But it's worth it for the gorgeous views of Camp Cove and Parsley, Watsons and Vaucluse Bays in the distance.\n\nWhy go? While going Full Monty in public isn't for everyone, there's something undeniably liberating about taking to the harbour waters in just your birthday suit. The stunning Sydney views are just the cherry on top.\n\nDon't miss: If stripping off at Obelisk piques your interest, why not pay a visit to one of Sydney's other nude beaches? There are five near the city where getting your kit off is permitted.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? One of the best escape rooms in Sydney; there are three rooms to choose from, and in each room you have to solve a series of puzzles in the allotted time in order to escape.\n\nWhy go? The Cipher Room is a labour of love for its co-creators, Newtown locals Marise Watson and David Vella. Game designer Marise spent a year researching escape rooms around Australia and in New York before creating Espionage. Husband David is the builder who put together the room’s ingenious bits and pieces by hand.\n\nDon't miss: The Cipher Room’s scariest challenge, set in a haunted toy shop filled with creepy dolls. It's like stepping into a horror movie in the best way possible.\n\nWhat is it? A beachside restaurant that’s built its name on serving exceptional food made from locally sourced ingredients in a perfectly unpretentious, sun-bathed setting.\n\nWhy go? With its quaintly colourful decor, ocean views and distinctly friendly team, Sean’s has been playing host to magical mealtimes since it opened in 1993. Few things are more quintessentially Sydney than eating a plate of perfect fresh seafood after a dip in the ocean.\n\nDon’t miss: Honestly, you could come for the bread alone, but it’s worth coming hungry so you have room for a famous Sean’s dessert. The menu changes with the seasons, but you won’t be disappointed.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Palm Beach is the ideal Australian package. Located one hour away from Sydney’s CBD on the Northern Beaches, this hot spot is perfect for a relaxing day trip away from the commotion of the city.\n\nWhy go? Fans of Home & Away may recognise the location as Summer Bay, but Palm Beach is so much more than Alf Stewart's favourite fishing spot – there is calm water on one side for stand-up paddleboarding and kayaking, and big waves on the other for surfing. Plus, you can walk to the lighthouse on the hill, which is a great spot for whale watching.\n\nDon't miss: The cheapest way to get there is by the L90 bus from Wynyard Station for $6 - $10 with an Opal card.\n\nWhat is it? In a city that’s far from shy about showing off its natural beauty, it’s a surprise that one of its prettiest corners may well be one of its best-kept secrets. Adjacent to Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park in Sydney’s north, there’s a whopping 123 hectares of wildflower gardens surrounded by Sydney sandstone bushland. Every plant found here is native, although not necessarily local – these colourful blooms have been sourced from across Australia, including 18 threatened species of flora.\n\nWhy go? The gardens were first planted in 1968 as a sanctuary for Indigenous plants and animals. Today, in addition to their array of floral delights, the gardens also feature running paths, fitness areas, picnic spots, and the charming, heritage-listed Caley’s Pavillion and patio. There’s also a wildflower nursery where you can pick up some beautiful Australian plants to take home.\n\nDon't miss: While you're in this part of Sydney, make time to enjoy the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. Some of the most stunning trails close to the city can be found here, but the rocky falls at America Bay has to rank as its most breathtaking corner.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Aside from the toothy grin of its distinctive front gates, this multicoloured Ferris wheel is the most recognisable feature of Sydney's oldest theme park.\n\nWhy go? For more than eight decades, Luna Park has surprised and delighted the fun-seekers of Sydney. But it's not resting on its laurels. Sure, you'll still find some old-timey rides and vaudevillian aesthetics, but the park is also undergoing a major upgrade currently, to bring it into the 21st century, including the construction of several new attractions.\n\nDon't miss: While it's easy enough to catch the train over the Harbour Bridge to Milsons Point, we recommend taking the ferry. It's almost as quick and you'll be rewarded with some choice photo ops as you approach Luna Park's wharf.\n\nWhat is it? The phrase ‘hole-in-the-wall’ is thrown around all the time, but this teensy Inner West sandwich shop specialising in Vietnam’s greatest edible export really, truly is.\n\nWhy go? Sydney’s best banh mi is a topic of fierce debate, but Marrickville Pork Roll is always a part of that conversation. Waiting in the never-ending queue is like a rite of passage, but thankfully they pack the fluffy rolls with cold-cut pork, pâté and pickled veg so fast you won’t be waiting long.\n\nDon't miss: Should you find yourself in the city, you can get your hands on one of these bad boys at their second location in the thriving Darling Square precinct, as well.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhat is it? Affectionately known as the ‘Manly wormhole’, it was in fact industrious fishermen – and not natural erosion – that chiseled this 40-metre channel through the rock of Queenscliff Head more than a century ago. Connecting Queenscliff and Freshwater beaches, the tunnel is still the most direct route between the two seafronts without cutting through the suburban streets.\n\nWhy go? While it may be a bit of a challenge scrambling over the rocks of the headland north of Manly Beach to find it, your efforts are soon rewarded with a close encounter with Sydney’s rich history and a view of Freshwater Beach that’s hard to beat, especially if you time your visit to coincide with sunset.\n\nDon't miss: While you're in the neighbourhood, why not make a day of it? After all, Queenscliff Beach is Time Out's official pick for one of the best beaches in Sydney."
