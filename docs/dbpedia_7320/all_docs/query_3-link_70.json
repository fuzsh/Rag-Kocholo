        "text": "Year 11 students travel south and have a ‘Back to Bundanon’ experience at Arthur Boyd’s Bundanon and Riversdale properties. Here, they engage in all the wonders that the property has to offer, including an artistic programme aimed at supporting students in their transition from Year 11 into the Year 12 Visual Arts course. As their primary focus, students enjoy drawing and printmaking. They also acquire a range of competencies, including traditional and experimental techniques, while working closely with Bundanon art educators. Bonding with like-minded peers causes artistic discussion to flourish.\n\nYear 12 students visit Hobart to experience the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA). Students are always enthralled by the contemporary nature of the installations that are presented within the gallery space. Year 12 students use gallery visits to inspire their art theory work, as these trips greatly enhance their knowledge and understanding of art practice for their final coursework.\n\nOur senior art students often produce award-winning entries in web-based, local, national and international art competitions. They have also enjoyed investigating the world of influential artists, gaining a deep knowledge of their works and developing the ability to use the process of art analysis and art criticism to view the world in new and exciting ways.\n\nHigh School dance students engage in weekly technique classes that highlight foot and core control development, floor work and travelling, and off-centre skills in a range of styles. As technical skills in dance deepen, aspects of performance quality and stagecraft are also enhanced. In this process, our student dancers learn how to use their bodies via the language of dance.\n\nThroughout the year, teachers help students develop a class piece during practical lessons which is then performed at the annual End of Year Dance Showcase at NIDA in Term 4. This exercise aims to equip students with the endurance, strength and coordination required to eventually present a 3-minute solo dance. From a theoretical point of view, the dance programme introduces learners to somatotypes and individual body types. They also understand how these factors influence personal capabilities and limitations when dancing.\n\nTo support this new knowledge, students study the bones and joints of the body, as well as different types of training to prevent injury.\n\nIn composition classes, the focus is on increasing creativity and confidence in personal choreographic styles. Students create compositions based on a chosen intention and develop skills of personalisation and abstraction to transform literal concepts into the art form of dance. Students also learn to structure their movement using motif and form, organising their ideas into a readable art form.\n\nThe appreciation component of the course is centred around analysing the meaning of dance. Students evaluate the work of professional choreographers and engage in seminars and workshops with professional lecturers. There is also a focus on essay writing in this component of the course. Dance is a truly unique and rewarding subject. Studying dance at this level not only teaches students to become stronger, more expressive artists but they are equipped with personal skills that assist them in decision-making and problem-solving.\n\nParticipants learn how to collaborate with teachers and peers and expand their knowledge and potential. They become efficient at time management and learn to meet deadlines and plan effectively for the creative process. Throughout all aspects of the course, students are given regular opportunities to reflect on and evaluate their work to set goals for future performances. All of these are characteristics easily translated to every other subject on the High School timetable, preparing students for a full and rewarding academic experience.\n\nMusic I (Preliminary and HSC course)\n\nStudents who choose this option need no prerequisite, however due to the academic rigour at Reddam House, it is strongly recommended that students taking this option have experience as performers on at least one instrument or voice. It is suitable for students with diverse musical backgrounds, both formal and informal, including those with an interest in popular music. It is delivered at the rate of eight 55-minute periods every fortnight. Students are also required to study a musical instrument and perform in an ensemble.\n\nMusic II (Preliminary and HSC course)\n\nStudents who choose Music II must have completed the Years 7–10 Mandatory and Additional Study courses. Focusing on Western Art music, it is suitable for students with a formal background in music, and requires a high level of music literacy, advanced performance skills (around AMEB Grade 6 or equivalent at entry to Year 11), and an aptitude for composition and musicology. In addition to eight 55-minute periods every fortnight, students must also study an instrument and perform in an ensemble.\n\nMusic Extension (HSC course)\n\nThis unit is an extension for those enrolled in the Music II course. An extra period is timetabled each week and students are required to research their repertoire and expand their understanding of what it is to be a performer in these styles through their presentation of a viva and assembly of a portfolio of work In the HSC exam, they are required to complete 3 extra performance works for external examination, including a chamber ensemble performance."
