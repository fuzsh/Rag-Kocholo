        "text": "Anthony was born in Sydney and grew up around his father’s dental clinic, gaining experience in the dental field from an early age. He moved to Brisbane for five years and graduated from the University of Queensland with honours, also becoming a member of the Australian Dental Association before returning home to Sydney. Here Anthony enjoys treating patients in a wide variety of fields, ranging from regular check up and cleans to veneers, crowns, extractions, root canals and dentures.\n\nSince graduating, Anthony has undertaken further training in dental implants, allowing him to surgically replace missing teeth. He has also become a qualified provider of Invisalign, an “invisible” alternative to braces that comfortably straightens teeth and produces beautiful smiles. Anthony enjoys treating people of all ages and utilises the latest dental technologies to deliver efficient and comfortable care for his patients. When he is not working, Anthony enjoys football and playing his guitar.\n\nOleg obtained his Bachelor of Dental Surgery from Sydney University in 1988. Oleg is a member of the Australian Dental Association, and is a Visiting Dental Consultant to the Sydney Children’s Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital. He regularly provides his services to rural communities of NSW, and volunteers his time for the Yalari Aboriginal Project.\n\nOleg believes in practicing evidence-based dentistry, aided by state of the art technology. He is constantly keeping up to date with the latest technological innovations and regularly undergoes advanced training in many areas of dentistry.\n\nOleg enjoys spending his spare time with family and friends, but even at home it’s all medical shop-talk with his lovely wife Victoria (pharmacist) and his sons Anthony (dentist) and Danny (doctor). Currently in high school, his daughter Emily is also (unsurprisingly) thinking about a career in healthcare. Oleg’s other interests include the Australian outback and motorbikes – be sure to start up a conversation about these topics at your next appointment!\n\nDr. Veronica obtained her dental degree with honours from the University of Queensland, gaining valuable experience treating patients in Brisbane and regional New South Wales before joining us at Dental On Hollywood. Veronica has worked both privately and in a hospital setting, providing treatment to everyone from newly born children to the medically-compromised elderly, and uses her knowledge and skills to provide her patients with the best possible care.\n\nVeronica’s calm nature helps her patients feel at ease when they walk into our clinic. She listens to the concerns of her patients and educates them about oral health and how to look after their gums and teeth. In particular, Veronica enjoys treating children of all ages, helping them to overcome their fear of the dentist. Veronica also has a keen interest in aesthetic and cosmetic work, especially fixing crooked teeth. On her weekends, Veronica loves to have a good coffee and explore the various beaches and walking trails of Sydney.\n\nWith over 15 years experience at Dental On Hollywood, Iveta focuses on being a loyal and supportive assistant, administrator and manager. She takes initiative in any task to benefit the clinic and its clientele and prides herself in making sure patients have a friendly and high quality experience.\n\nOutside of the office, Iveta finds passion in fitness and health, travelling and caring for animals."
