        "text": "Yes, Bondi has got the beach. And babes. And surf. And smoothie bowls (or is it bone broth now?). Regardless, the coastal suburb has also got great bars, for when the only exercise you want to be doing is bending the elbow. Check out our guide to Bondi's best watering holes. Bottoms up.\n\nKeen to keep the party going? Check out our ultimate guide to best bars in Sydney.\n\nHungry? Have a look at our guide to the best restaurants in Bondi here.\n\nThere are four ways to drink at Hotel Ravesis. 1) Post-swim, downstairs with a cold schooner or cider. 2) Late night on a packed dancefloor with a vodka lime and soda or bubbles. 3) On the side balcony with a crisp rosé (which they've got on tap here) that'll match the facade's pink paint job; or finally, 4) On the front balcony overlooking the beach while exploring the wine list or diving into the fruit-heavy cocktail menu. Hotel Ravesis has your round the clock boozing covered.\n\nThis new addition to Bondi’s beachside dining scene is so pretty that the interiors almost rival the spectacular views of Australia’s most famous stretch of sand. Almost. Promenade Bondi Beach is housed in the heritage Bondi Pavilion, tucked under the Spanish-style roof and archways. Whether you're a beachgoer looking for a relaxed, post-swim beer, or are after an elegant date or special occasion location, this is one for you.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThis long-standing Bondi Road corner pub is now owned by Merivale. Rather than gutting and reduxing it entirely, they've kept some of the venue's scuzzy charm that's kept locals returning since it first opened way back in 1907. The Merivale edge comes into effect via the drinks. The list has been refreshed, complete with Daiquiris, Boilermakers, bottled Negronis and Espresso Martinis on tap. Wine wise, they are focusing on Australian producers doing rosés and low intervention wines. Hot tip: forget trying to nab a booking at Totti's nextdoor – you can order all the dishes at the Royal instead.\n\nThe army of regulars at this café and wine bar is fiercely loyal, perhaps because they know that snagging a spot in the wardrobe-sized place at peak hour feels like winning the lotto. So Wwen you see one, don't hesitate. Plus, the people and dog watching is also excellent.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFew pleasures come close to sipping a Spritz the colour of a Balinese sunset at this oh-so-Sydney institution, while you stare out at the deep blue hues of the Pacific rolling down below. You pay for the privilege, but why the heck wouldn't you? And a drink, after all, is cheaper than a meal in the restaurant. Go on, treat yourself.\n\nThirsty for a cold one? Good news, because Bondi is now home to a brewery, taproom and restaurant in one, Curly Lewis. It’s Bondi’s first brewery, and you’ll find it on Campbell Parade. Here our pick is the Bondi Hazy Ale – it’s tropical, full bodied and tastes even better after a surf. Keep one eye out for the weekly food specials and get around $15 schnittys.\n\nAvril Treasure\n\nFood & Drink Editor, Time Out Sydney\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe beach may be the jewel in Bondi’s sandy crown but some of its best features are far enough from the shoreline that you’re expected to wear shoes, even pants. So don those loafers and bring your license (Bondi Bowling Club is a club after all, so you'll need to sign in or join) and treat yourself to cracking feed and a cold one (or three) here.\n\nThe good news is you won't have to walk far from Bondi Beach to find Lola's Italian and Bar, a breezy spot by hospo gun Marco Ambrosino (ex-10 Willam Street and Fratelli Paradiso) and Manny Spinola. If you're after a drink, take a seat at the bar and choose from excellent cocktails or Italian vino – there's a page dedicated to bottles priced $100 and under. But we also recommend you settle in for snacks, too. Italian classics are the go here. Add ocean views into the occassion and there's a lot to love here.\n\nAvril Treasure\n\nFood & Drink Editor, Time Out Sydney\n\nAdvertising\n\nRocker, Bondi’s cool restaurant and bar, rocks. Found 200 metres from Bondi's golden stretch of sand, the relaxed spot by Darren Robertson (also Three Blue Ducks) and Cameron Northway (also Melbourne's Loti) has been keeping Bondi locals well fed and hydrated since 2017, and the good times have just kept on coming. Swim on over for their bottomless brunch – it's great value and one of the best in town.\n\nAvril Treasure\n\nFood & Drink Editor, Time Out Sydney\n\nYes, we know this is a best bars list, but hear us out. Mikey's Pizza slaps, and the joint has a big focus on drinks – so it makes the cut. Plus, the rock ’n’ roll vibe of the place is backed up with live music. Every Thursday, local artists, including Lionel Cole and Billsbry perform on rotation. We say come for pizza, booze and live music, and leave with a smile.\n\nAdvertising\n\nPull up a pew at this no-frills boozer, and you'll feel like a local in absolutely no time. They take the cocktails seriously and the jaffles are tops. The name says it all, really.\n\nThere aren't all that many places you can score a proper Bloody Caesar in the Harbour City, or proper poutine for that matter. You can snag both at the Beaver, and we'll happily drink to that.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThis chic restaurant-cum-bar has commanded the corner of Denham Street and Bondi Road for years, and remains a laid-back locale for wine-driven adventures.\n\nHardware was one of the first spots in Bondi to tackle the 'creative share plates and solid cocktails in industrial surrounds' brief, and it has stood the test of the time on Hall Street for getting it right.\n\nAdvertising\n\nA big night at the Beachy is pretty much a Sydney rite of passage, so if you haven't gotten amongst it yet, it's probably time to tick that box. And if you have, you know it's just as rewarding for a quiet beer and a game of pool."
