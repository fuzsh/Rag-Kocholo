        "text": "separator_solid\n\nAustralian National University (ANU)\n\nGreat for top international reputation\n\nUniversity of Sydney\n\nGreat for student city\n\n\"I loved Sydney and studying at the University! It was an amazing time! Sydney is a great place and the Uni is really supportive and strong. I felt really safe in the city and public transit is great.\"\n\nCasey\n\nUniversity of Melbourne\n\nGreat for social life\n\n\"I travelled to Melbourne University to gain a wider business understanding from the best university in Australia. Not only can I now say that I was educated at a globally competitive University, I can also say I travelled adventurously all throughout The Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia, and through Victoria.\"\n\nJustin\n\nUniversity of Adelaide\n\nGreat for access to nature\n\nUniversity of Queensland\n\nGreat for sporty campus\n\nJames Cook University\n\nGreat for student research opportunities\n\n\"I originally chose JCU for their marine biology courses since studying marine biology in a landlocked state is hard. I got incredible first hand experiences with marine life SCUBA diving there, I made new friends from all over the world, and I got to do field research with fun professors who really encouraged hands-on and fun learning!\"\n\nEllie\n\nMonash University\n\nGreat for green campus\n\n\"Studying at Monash was a once in a lifetime experience and I am so great-full for my opportunity. Monash does an excellent job on connecting exchange students with other exchange students, and domestic students are very approachable. Monash's campuses are student friendly for school work, socialising, and student work as well.\"\n\nRiley\n\nUniversity of New South Wales (UNSW)\n\nGreat for beach life\n\n\"I took some of my most rigorous, practical courses at UNSW, yet still had more free time than ever: the proximity to the beach, the beauty of the area, and the amount of friendship and community within the dorm/college made this an unforgettable and highly meaningful experience. Living with local and international students opposed to in an apartment allowed me to meet so many amazing people, and I believe this is a MUST when given the study abroad experience.\"\n\nJames\n\nUniversity of Technology Sydney (UTS)\n\nGreat for design innovation\n\nUniversity of Western Australia (UWA)\n\nGreat for affordability\n\nseparator_solid\n\nThings to know about studying in Australia\n\nIs Australia a good choice for international students?\n\nHome to the top universities in Australia for international students, the Land Down Under is consistently a favorite among US students. it's also an extremely popular choice for students from Asian, Latin American, and African countries. Not only is it a diverse and welcoming country but it boasts 6 of the world's top 50 student cities and 9 of the 100 best universities globally.\n\nIs Australia affordable for international students?\n\nWhere are the top universities located?\n\nSoak up the sun while studying in Australia\n\nAustralia is the sun-drenched land of great people, sandy beaches, delicious food, world-class universities, and people who really know how to relax and party. No matter which top university you choose, youâ€™re sure to have the time of your life. Just don't forget your sunscreen!"
