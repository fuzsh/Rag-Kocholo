We practice Responsible Service of Alcohol and Responsible Conduct of Gaming. We are a member of Clubs NSW and Eastern Suburbs Liquor Accord.\n\nThe Bondi Icebergs is the only licensed Winter Swimming Club in the world, dating back to 1929 & owing its origin to a band of local life savers with a desire to maintain their fitness during the Winter months.\n\nThe band of live savers formed the Bondi Icebergs Winter Swimming Club, drew up a constitution and elected office bearers. To maintain membership, they created \"Rule 15B\", declaring it mandatory for swimmers to compete on three out of four Sundays for a period of five years.\n\nThe Bondi Icebergs become licensed in 1960 and the members moved from a tin shed into comfortable premises with bar & poker machines. A further update took place in the 1970’s enabling the Club to operate on two floors. In 1995 female members were admitted, and in 2002 the Club opened their new premises.\n\nSince its beginning back in 1929, the Club has forged a reputation as one of Australia’s most famous Clubs.We stand on the shoulders of giants & would not be the iconic Bondi Icebergs Club without our rich legacy.\n\nOur history pages are dedicated to those Icebergs who have passed on since we began back in 1929.\n\nTo name them all would not be possible, to endeavour to would not be fair to those who might be omitted.\n\nTo our past Presidents, Vice-Presidents, Captains, Vice-Captains, Hon. Secretaries, Assist. Secretaries, Hon. Treasurers, Assist. Treasurers, Social Secretaries, Directors and Racing Officials we express the Club’s sincerest thanks and appreciation for their efforts.\n\nTo our vast number of active, active reserve, long serving and associate members for being one of us, we thank you all for helping make the club what it is today and add to the memories of the years gone by.\n\nThe main entrance to our licensed Clubhouse is on street-level along Notts Avenue. Our Clubhouse boasts great value Bistro style dining, and - of course - the unbeatable oceanfront views across the famous Bondi Beach.\n\nAll visitors are welcome from around Australia and all over the world.\n\nIdentification is essential. Please have your identification ready for entry. Passport, Drivers Licence or Members Entry I.D. As per licensed Club regulations in Australia all visitors who live within 5km of the Club will need to be a member, or signed in by a member. Members benefits include food & beverage discounts.\n\nInside you’ll find our casual Bistro, two licensed bars, dedicated function facilities, an air-conditioned TAB. Our club overlooks the sparkling blue waters of Bondi Icebergs pool and over North Bondi headland.\n\nThe famous Bondi Baths have been a historical landmark of Bondi Beach for over 100 years and are open to the public all year round. Featuring both a larger lap pool and smaller kid’s pool, qualified lifeguards are on patrol during opening hours all year round.\n\nThe Sauna is located on the pool deck level, and is included in the price of your pool admission, along with hot showers.
