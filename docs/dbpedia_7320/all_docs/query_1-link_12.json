It is rewarding to work here because we share the same interests, goals, values, and beliefs regarding teaching and caring for children and families.\n\nSpending time with my family and friends, cycling, hiking, and traveling are some of my favorited things to do.\n\nBachelor’s degree in Early Childhood Education\n\nI truly believe that a sense of belonging is crucial for each child’s development, healthy growth, and who they will become. Therefore, my aims are to build trustworthy relationships with the children, provide a safe environment, and support and understand their emotions. This will lead children to develop self-confidence, a strong sense of security and well-being, as it will enhance their learning capacity. I love spending time with friends, travelling, volleyball, trekking and sweets.\n\nDiploma in Early Childhood Education\n\nI believe that each child is unique and as an educator, I value and develop each child’s strengths, interests, and skills. It is our role to support, guide and encourage children, their families and the community in the journey that is early childhood education. I love to spend my spare time with my kids and exercising through swimming, tennis, cycling and badminton. I also love reading and watching movies.\n\nCertificate III in Early Childhood Education\n\nI’ve worked at BBC for 18 years. I’m extremely dedicated to caring for our little ones while providing a fun and safe environment. It’s a wonder to see how their personalities develop day by day, one by one in different directions, knowing that I’m a part of their development. I like to ensure our cottage is spotless every morning. In my spare time, I enjoy the company of my family, especially my 2 little grandsons. I also like to go to the movies, attend literature talks, author presentations and fine dining. I also meditate and love snorkelling in the tropical reef of Southern Philippines island and the Algave-Portugal.\n\nDiploma in Early Childhood Education\n\nStudying towards a Bachelor Degree in Early Childhood Education\n\nIt was my childhood dream to become an educator. As I go on with my life, I have been learning that being an educator is a rewarding profession beyond the title and benefits it could give you, especially when you can see the children learning new things, having fun and building a good relationship with everyone. Back in my home country, I studied a Bachelors in Secondary Education to fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher and I would choose to become one all over again.\n\nDiploma in Early Childhood Education\n\nThe children are the reflex of our teaching and the experiences we provide to them. Through play they learn skills for life! It is an educator’s role to create an environment where the children can feel the sense of\n\nbelonging, where they can display emotions, develop physical skills, feel confident. It’s also amazing how much the children learn from us, and we learn from them! I love going to the beach, meeting friends, coffee, chocolate, travelling and discovering new places!\n\nCurrently studying a Diploma in Early Childhood Education\n\nI believe that children are our future. I want to inspire your children to follow their dreams and give them love and support. I hope to fill their days with laughter and memories. I’m happy to be a part of this team where everyone’s goal is to give the children a fun, loving and safe environment. I love travelling, cooking, bushwalking, and spending time with my friends."
