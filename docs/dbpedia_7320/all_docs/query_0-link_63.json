The league may be reseeded mid-season so all teams can enjoy healthy matched competition. If enough teams register into each skill level, you will be playing against teams to match your experience. Click here to see an explanation of skill levels (choose wisely).\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 TEAM SIZE: There are 6 people required to play. As this is a mixed league, the rules explain how many of each gender are required. We recommend having a team roster of at least 8-10 people to allow for subs, and absentees. Click to view Team Roster Instructions and Default & Subs Policy.\n\n🌤 OUTDOOR FIELDS: Because the fields are outdoors, you can expect about 1-3 rescheduled games per season. BUT we will always ensure your paid games are played (not cancelled, just rescheduled). Our wet weather policy can be found here.\n\n🤸 YOUR DEDICATED STAFF: There are two Urban Rec staff looking after you this season. Your Event Host is the person overseeing your game, teaching you the rules and ensuring you are playing fair and fun. Your League Manager is your main point of contact and helps ensure your league is an epic experience.\n\n🎽 WHAT TO BRING: We provide all the equipment you need to play. If your team would like to nominate to play in a certain colour, you need to email [email protected] to get first dibs. Alternatively bring a black, AND a white t-shirt each week. Wear normal runners, and active wear. Studded boots are allowed.\n\n🚘 GETTING THERE: This season we are playing at Hugh Bamford Reserve in North Bondi. The fields are located off Military Road, and are accessible via bus with the 380 route, which drops off on Military Road, then it’s just a short walk up the driveway. There is also parking available on side streets. There are toilets on site.\n\n🍺 YOUR LOCAL CLUBHOUSE: We work with a ton of great venues for you to socialise after the game. Your local clubhouse is usually a sponsor venue and provides prizing for our leagues. For a list of all the Urban Rec clubhouses and to find your nearest, click here.\n\nREGISTRATION INFORMATION\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 TEAM REGISTRATION: Team rego is payable upfront, and that fee is all you will have to pay for the season. When registering as a team, you can choose how many people you’d like to have on the roster including subs. The fees for this league are below!\n\nINDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION: Don’t have a team? No problem, register as an individual, and we will match you with a team. The individual registration fee is the only cost you will have for the season. When you register as an individual player, we will provide you and your team with a uniform. Check out more Individual Player FAQs.\n\n💁‍♀️ JUST PLAY INDIVIDUAL REGISTRATION: If you're looking for the next level of team management, Just Play offer individual registration into this league. They sort uniforms, manage the team’s attendance each week and ensure your season is carefree.
