        "text": "Dr TEvya Harpole\n\nSenior Veterinarian\n\nAfter spending her early years living in many different countries, Tevya pursued her first university degree in biochemistry & biophysics in the USA. She then attended The Royal Veterinary College in London, graduating in early 2001. She spent 11 years working in the UK before emigrating with her family to Sydney in 2012. She has worked in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney since then.\n\nHer special areas of interest are dentistry, soft tissue surgery, ophthalmology and small furries (rabbits, rats & guinea pigs). She has spent her career focusing heavily on dentistry with advanced training in that discipline. She does, however, remain rooted in a holistic and individualised approach to her patients and their needs.\n\nHome is shared with her cat Cosmo, her dog Lucky and should the opportunity arise, no doubt, another ‘just staying for the night’ will become a part of the family.\n\nDr esther Tarszisz, BVSc (Hons I) MApSc PhD\n\nSenior Veterinarian\n\nEsther graduated from Sydney university in 2002. She’s worked all over Australia and the UK with dogs, cats and other small furries and simultaneously pursued a love of wildlife conservation in remote locations worldwide, most recently in Antarctica with Weddell and elephant seals. Despite the love of wildlife, she’s never lost a passion for hands-on treatment of small furry creatures and has pursued deeper knowledge of emergency veterinary care (medicine & surgery) and dentistry. She’s also discovered an interest in bird & reptile medicine, and holds a not-so-secret urge to have a cockatiel as part of her household.\n\nShe is owned by an elderly previous stray Beanie (now competing for “The Fussiest Cat In The World” title) and was recently adopted by a tiny bunny, Squishlet, who enjoys being adorable, snuggly and destroying things. Esther can be found climbing walls (gym and outdoors), hiking in her spare time, and doing no cooking whatsoever.\n\nDr Paul Logan\n\nSenior Veterinarian\n\nPaul graduated from University with honours more years ago than he wishes to admit before spending 3 years in mixed animal practice in the Hunter Valley and North Queensland. The mandatory couple of years in the UK followed before the sun, sand and surf of Bondi lured him home. Paul been at the practice for over 20 years and has cared for many of your pets (and seen your kids grow up!). Paul lives locally with his wife, 3 daughters, their 2 cats & Hungarian Vizsla. Outside work Paul enjoys surfing and most water sports.\n\nDr Eamonn sheehan\n\nVeterinarian\n\nEamonn moved to Sydney from Ireland in February of this year. Escaping the Irish wind and rain was the goal and he is very content with the sun and sand that Eastern Suburbs brings. Qualifying from University College Dublin in 2018, he has worked with all manners of animals in Ireland, from farm animals to little furries. Eamonn has focused on small animals in recent years, but remembers his cattle practice fondly. He has attained a postgraduate certificate in small animal surgery in recent years and is especially intrigued by orthopaedics and musculoskeletal problems. Eamonn hopes to continue with further studies in the future. In his spare time he likes to keep active by playing Hurling - an Irish ball sport, and recently has been trying his hand at Aussie Rules. He misses his two springer spaniel dogs back in Ireland, Jess and Sam who he gets regular updates of from his parents at home.\n\nRACHEL SCOTT\n\nOperations & Business Development Manager\n\nSenior Veterinary Nurse\n\nRachel graduated from Edinburgh Napier University as a Veterinary Nurse in 2019. Before making the move to Australia and gracing us with her sassy and hilarious presence, she worked in Emergency and Referral Veterinary care. Rachel has a special interest in the business side of the veterinary world along with medicine nursing and is always searching for new things to make our clinic even better.\n\nYou can often find her chatting about all things Scotland, and if you’re Scottish she will certainly know about it!\n\nIsabella PETRELLI\n\nVeterinary Nurse\n\nIsabella started vet nursing at Bondi Vets in 2021 as a junior nurse while finishing her Certificate IV and quickly climbed her way through the ranks. She loves to care for all animals and can usually be found in theatre monitoring an anaesthetic, or handing out homemade Napoletana sauce from her big Italian family who love to keep everyone at Bondi Vets well fed!\n\nHer passion is neonatal care and has been known to foster an abandoned kitten or two. Isabella currently has a cheeky kelpie named Shadow, two lorikeets and a special needs cat named Ollie.\n\ncaitlin Fisher\n\nVeterinary Nurse\n\nAfter completing a Bachelor in Animal Science at Western Sydney University, Caitlin began vet nursing in 2020 and hasn’t looked back. She is always finding ways to help everyone around her and is a self-proclaimed bird lady who keeps 26 pigeons.\n\nWhen Caitlin isn’t at Bondi Vets, she is not only responsible for creating Dr Kate’s looks as her makeup artist, but also a pole dancing instructor. Seriously, what can’t she do?\n\nCleo Lowery\n\nVeterinary Nurse\n\nCleopatra (Cleo) started her vet nursing career back in Melbourne where she grew up but since moving to Bondi in April she has fallen in love with the bondi lifestyle. Whilst studying her Certificate IV in Veterinary Nursing Cleo is learning all the tips and tricks from her colleagues in both medicine and surgical nursing. She loves a good cuddle from her patients and won’t hesitate to give out a treat or 3 to a well deserving good boy/girl. Cleo has a staffy named Luna back at home who she tries to go visit when she can. Outside of the clinic Cleo’s passions are Gymnastics, Boxing and woodcarving when she has the chance!\n\nelsa wilson\n\nVeterinary Nurse\n\nElsa began vet nursing in 2019 before becoming a part of our Bondi Vet team in 2022 where she is dedicated to building strong relationships with both patients and clients. While continuing her studies, she is actively expanding her skills in both medicine and surgery nursing, showing a particular interest with monitoring anesthesia as well as wildlife medicine. In future Elsa aspires to make contributions to wildlife conservation organisations. Elsa's passion for animal welfare drives her enthusiasm for all aspects of her veterinary nursing and has a soft spot when caring for geriatric patients. Outside of Bondi Vet, Elsa enjoys ballet, cooking and embarking on adventures with her dog.\n\nJulie Ui\n\nVeterinary Nurse\n\nAfter beginning careers in completely different industries, banking & fitness, Julie discovered her true passion was through veterinary nursing. Since 2022, Julie has been working at the Small Animal Specialist Hospital, before becoming a part of our team here at Bondi Vet Hospital this year. She has strong interests in internal medicine, surgery, and emergency animal care. At home, Julie is surrounded by Sesame her Toy Cavoodle, Monty her British Shorthair cat, and Shiloh her Labrador. Outside veterinary clinics, Julie enjoys travelling, a good read by the beach, starting (but never finishing) crochet projects, as well as camping in the outdoors with her fur babies in her spare time!\n\nSarojini “G” Selvaraju\n\nSenior Veterinary Nurse\n\nSarojini or best known as \"G\", recently moved from Melbourne to Sydney and joined Bondi Vets as a Senior Veterinary Nurse in September 2021. She was born and bred in Malaysia and studied Veterinary Medicine at the Bogor Agricultural University in Indonesia. After working as a Junior Vet in Malaysia for 1.5 years, in 2016, both she and her husband decided to make Australia home. They have since adopted a few cats to complete their little family who keep them pretty busy! Animal welfare has been G's main reason for becoming a veterinary professional. She hopes to be able to serve and play a part in improving the lives of animals in developing countries in the future. During G’s free time, besides cuddling her cats, she enjoys listening to music, playing the guitar, reading, and a good pint.\n\nKarol alonso\n\nAnimal Assistant\n\nKarol comes all the way from Sao Paulo, Brazil and has become a dedicated and caring member of our team at Bondi Vet. In 2021 Karol graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Science from Anhembi Morumbi University in Brazil before moving to Australian in 2022.
