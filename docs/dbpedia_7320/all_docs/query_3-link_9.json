You may find some of the facts below both amusing and fascinating.\n\nThe History of the Name\n\nThe name “Bondi” comes from the Aboriginal word that means “water breaking over rocks” or alternately “noise of water breaking over rocks.” But when you check with the Australian Museum, you’ll find out another reference for the word “Bondi”. For them, it corresponds to the place where a fight using “boondi” sticks took place. “Boondi” here simply means fighting sticks.\n\nBondi Beach Weather\n\nGenerally speaking, the temperature in Bondi Beach is enjoyable all year round, although the winter months can be cooler. On average during June to August temperatures drop down between 8.8 – 17°C. The warmest months to visit the Beach are from January to March when temperatures typically range from 24-28 degrees and often hotter into the 30’s. Either way, the rest of the months are a great time to visit, with the average temperature not going below 20 degrees Celsius in general and it’s still beautiful on a sunny winter day.\n\nAccommodation in Bondi Beach\n\nThere are a lot of accommodation options in Bondi Beach for travellers on all budgets. As a matter of fact, visitors have a lot of choices ranging from backpackers and hostels, to bed and breakfasts, to hotels, motels, and serviced apartments.

The busiest summer day for Bondi Beach was when its estimated the number of beach goers exceeds 40,000 on hot summer days. That’s a lot of people to get the lifeguards really busy.

The surf there can get very dangerous following big storm systems. In 1938 on a day known as Black Sunday some 200 people were swept into the sea in one moment after several huge waves hit people gathered on the sand bar. Five died and dozens were injured in the deadliest day on record at the beach. Earlier in the day lifeguards had pulled 74 people from the surf in one hour.\n\nFun Fact 4: Recorded Shark Attacks at Bondi Beach\n\nBetween 1990 and 2017 there have been a total of 3 unprovoked shark attacks at Bondi Beach. None have been fatal. The beach is protected by shark nets, air surveillance teams, and lifeguards.\n\nFun Fact 5: Hottest day on Bondi Beach\n\nThe hottest day on the beach happened in January 2018 when a scorching 47.3 degrees Celsius was recorded.
