        "text": "Swimming & surfing\n\nThis picture-postcard arc of golden sand and sparkling blue ocean is made for travel snaps or selfies at any time of the year. Just 8km from the city centre, Bondi is easy to get to by public transport – the trip from Town Hall is only 30 minutes. Or you can take a scenic ferry ride from Circular Quay to Watsons Bay for a connecting bus to Bondi.\n\nThe main beach area is in front of the Bondi Pavilion, a national heritage-listed icon. Roll out your beach towel and soak up Sydney’s relaxed beach lifestyle, then enjoy a dip between the red and yellow flags. Professional lifeguards patrol Bondi Beach 365 days a year and even have their own reality TV show, Bondi Rescue.\n\nYou can learn to surf year-round at one of the accredited surf schools. Experienced surfers will want to head to the southern end of the beach, where southerly swells and a rocky reef create powerful waves. On adjacent Campbell Parade, you’ll find shops selling surf gear and swimwear. Surfboard hire is also available.\n\nAt the southern end of the beach on the rocky headland is the iconic Bondi Icebergs, one of Australia’s oldest swimming clubs, where members swim throughout the winter, giving it the name Icebergs. The 50-metre pool and wading pool for kids are open to the public. Visitors are also welcome at the bar, bistro and elegant dining room.\n\nMore things to do\n\nBondi boasts a year-round events calendar of festivals, markets and activities, including the Festival of the Winds in September, which is a kite festival on the beach. If you’re visiting on the weekend, the Bondi Farmers Markets on Saturday is a must to stock up on organic produce, as is the Bondi Markets on Sunday for original fashions and jewellery.\n\nBetween May and November, you can easily spot whales during their annual migration from one of the spectacular vantage points along the Bondi to Coogee Coastal Walk, a 6km track which links four pretty beaches. In late spring, the cliffs of the coastal walk are transformed by Sculpture by the Sea, the world’s largest annual free-to-the-public outdoor sculpture exhibition.\n\nEat & drink\n\nThere are oodles of delicious places to eat in Bondi, from wholesome cafes and ice-cream parlours to beachside bars and fine-dining restaurants with great ocean views. Speedos in North Bondi was crowned the world’s most Instagrammable cafe, Sean's Panorama and North Bondi Fish both dish up great seafood with water views, local icon Hotel Ravesis serves Mediterranean small plates, and Bondi Trattoria is the place for pasta."
