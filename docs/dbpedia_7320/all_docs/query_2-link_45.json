        "text": "Bondi Partners was founded in Washington DC in early 2020 by former Australian Ambassador to the United States, the Hon. Joe Hockey.\n\nJoe identified that despite a deep trade and investment partnership between Australia and the U.S., innovative Australian companies struggled to gain traction in America because of the complexity and noise in the market. At the same time, U.S. firms looking to invest or expand into Australia, often as a strategic foothold into the Indo Pacific, lacked the strategic insights to help chart their course.\n\nAnd so Bondi Partners – named after the famous Sydney beach where Joe’s parents first met – was born to help elevate the trade and investment partnership between Australia and the United States to the next level.\n\nWith the evolution of AUKUS – a trilateral security pact between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. – Bondi Partners footprint continues to grow across the Pacific and the Atlantic. Today we have teams in Washington, Los Angeles, Sydney, Canberra, London and Tokyo where we partner with businesses which want to grow and invest across allied and global markets."
