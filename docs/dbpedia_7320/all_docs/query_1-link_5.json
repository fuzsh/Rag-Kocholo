Dacey were joined by journalists Ahtra Elnashar and Cate Cadell who all shared insights into how the election will play out in America and the effect it will have on the rest of the world.

Speaking to ausbiz about Australia's first national security fund, 1941, Anthony explained that national security will continue to be important in 10 years, 20 years and beyond because it underpins all other investment classes and our way of life. \"There is a huge desire to invest in local Australian business but it can't just be left to the Government. Private sector has a strong role to play. Plus the onset of AUKUS and Quad means these businesses now have an opportunity to sell to multiple governments,\" he said.
