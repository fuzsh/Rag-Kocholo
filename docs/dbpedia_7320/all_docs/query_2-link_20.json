        "text": "This past Monday I completed my first playthrough of LA Noire (2011). Its the third full playthrough I’ve done on stream, along with Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. I’ve wanted to buy this game since it first came out nearly thirteen years ago, but never got around to it. Every now and then I would stumble upon a clip of LA Noire on YouTube and it would pique my interest again, but not enough to convince me to make the purchase. It wasn’t until I came across another pair of comedic content creators on Twitch who were doing a playthrough on stream that I decided I wanted to try the game out for myself. Also, it didn’t hurt that LA Noire was on special in the Playstation Store (who doesn’t love a bargain?). As a lover of both open world games and media from that era, LA Noire seemed right up my alley. I had an absolute blast and I’m very grateful to all those in chat who joined me for the fun.\n\nLA Noire’s compelling plot, incredible music and challenging gameplay kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire ten streams it took to complete the main story. After wrapping things up I decided to make this review in the hopes that it will help anyone who is on the fence, much as I was for several years, familiarize themselves with LA Noire’s intriguing universe and decide for themselves whether this is a game they’d like to dedicate a significant amount of time to.\n\nWarning: significant spoilers ahead!\n\nSet in 1940’s Los Angeles, LA Noire follows the story of Cole Phelps (voiced by Aaron Staton of ‘Mad Men’ fame) as he rises through the ranks of the LAPD. A veteran of the 6th Marine Regiment, Phelps starts off as a patrol officer, eventually working his way up to the role of detective. Over the course of his career in law enforcement, Phelps is assigned a number of different partners — all of whom are disagreeable if not outright hostile to our protagonist. The gameplay is — for the most part — entirely linear. A cutscene presents a new case, followed by directions from one of the LAPD superiors. Then its off to the crime scene, where Phelps speaks to the coroner, examines the deceased and looks for any clues that could aid in resolving the case. Once a lead is found, Phelps and his partner travel to a new location in search of more clues and to interrogate anyone who might be of interest. How quickly a case is resolved depends entirely on how well the player does during the interrogation and clue collection process. As the player progresses through the different bureaus of the LAPD (Patrol, Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson) it becomes more difficult to bring cases to a satisfying conclusion. Dark, green-hued flashbacks that play at the end of every case give us a glimpse into Phelps’ past in the USMC. Cutscenes triggered by the discovery of newspapers throughout the game world inform of the big picture storyline unfolding in the background alongside the game’s more evident plot.\n\nBefore taking a deeper look into the gameplay itself, I think its important to acknowledge all the different elements that go into creating such an epic open world experience. The city of Los Angeles is as much a star of the game as Detective Phelps or any of his partners. Much can be said about the vintage architecture, the classic storefronts complete with colorful awnings and retail signage that are synonymous with big cities in America. As a native New Yorker, driving down certain streets in-game felt like entering some of the less tourist-y parts of my city. Indeed, its easy to forget that the events in this game are set 80 years in the past. The muted color palette and gritty streets — aspects that are undoubtedly meant to create a realistic depiction of mid-20th century California — have the unintended effect of making LA Noire’s open world seem more contemporary compared to, say, Grand Theft Auto V. Sure, coming across a newspaper salesman with his stand propped up against an enormous building or entering Reggie’s Café, a quaint spot on the corner of 9th and Olive complete with a jukebox and red tile flooring, do instantly ruin the illusion that the game is anything other than a time piece. I guess what I’m trying to say is that where GTA V tries too little with its harsh daylight and Red Dead Redemption 2 tries too hard with it’s hyper-dynamic environment and ever-changing weather system, LA Noire exists as a comfortable middle ground that doesn’t visually overwhelm the player.\n\nAs beautiful as the streets of LA Noire are, the building interiors are impressive in their own right. The game map is littered with accessible laundromats, clubs, bars, movie sets and stores. The sheer number of accessible interiors available in LA Noire is in stark contrast to Rockstar’s other titles. As the player explores the game map they discover new landmarks — some of which are relevant to uncovering the mystery of the BD Killer during the Homicide desk. One such location — my personal favorite as a matter of fact — is the Hall of Records. Located in North Broadway, west of City Hall, the Hall of Records houses the Property Records office and the LAPD Records office. While the grand exterrior cannot be ignored, its what lies inside that makes this landmark unlike any other in LA Noire. Through its doors you will find Roman-style busts, a spiral staircase, a gorgeous stained glass ceiling and a dangling chandelier. The magesty is certainly befitting a loacation of such importance. Those who have had the pleasure (or displeasure depending on the occasion!) of entering one of the massive government buildings in the U.S. for the first time will certainly recognize the feeling of total awe that comes over when one is standing on those marble floors, surrounded by history. I was very impressed that the developers were able to capture this familiar feeling so effectively.\n\nNo conversation about the atmosphere of LA Noire would be complete without acknowledging the incredible soundtrack that serves as a constant mood-setting backdrop to LA Noire’s gameplay. Composed by Andrew Hale and Simon Hale, LA Noire’s score consists of original tracks as well as over thirty licensed songs by artists such as Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong, which are featured on the in-game radio. The original tracks were recorded at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London, England and are inspired by the real-life scores of films from the 1940’s. The game’s main theme — featuring soft precussion, jazzy piano playing, and some moody trumpeting — instantly creates a vibe of melancholy and nostalgia from the minute the player enters the starting screen. As the player advances to the main menu, Cole Phelps is seen walking in the background near a brick wall, the screen entirely black and white, while the trumpet from the simply named \"Main Theme” title track blares in the background. Among all the incredible songs the make up the original score, my personal favorite has to be “New Beginning, Pt. 1”. The swelling percussion and trumpet accompanied by the intense violin always makes me perk up on my way to solve another case.\n\nAs I mentioned previously, the gameplay in and of itself is pretty linear. Each case opens with a title and cutscene that gives the player a glimpse into the fate of the victim(s) in question. Jump to Detective Cole Phelps in the police station accompanied by whichever respective partner is assigned to him during that particular bureau desk. On each of my streamed playthroughs I’ve always taken a generous amount of time to appreciate the game world, looking at every piece of artwork on the walls, going down every alley and observing the distinct architecture. It was easy to keep my audience engaged while doing this in Red Dead Redemption 2 because the game’s side missions, Easter eggs and general lore all but require an obsessive attention to detail in order to be understood in full. Admittedly, it was much harder to get viewers excited about this kind of exploration during the GTA V playthrough — both because my audience had changed quite a bit since the Red Dead days and because GTA’s silly, over-the-top vibe does not lend itself to thoughtful interpretations of in-game art. However, I had acquired a reputation among some of my older viewership for the attentive gameplays and I was determined to retain it going into my LA Noire playthrough. Unfortunately the game itself never states outright which moments are time-sensitive and which ones can be approached more leisurely. I spent the entirety of my playthrough wondering if some invisible clock was going to run out or whether the time I had spent exploring the police station was affecting the case I was working on at the moment.\n\nI fully appreciate the convenience of navigating in this game. While both Red Dead Redemption 2 and Grand Theft Auto V require some degree of familiarity with the game map, I only had to manually set waypoints during one section of the game — the part in which the player must travel to different landmarks searching for clues left by the BD Killer. During the rest of the playthrough I very easily got to where I wanted to go just by opening Cole Phelps’ notebook and selecting my next waypoint by clicking on one of the available locations written down. Locations are crossed out when you’ve found all remaining clues there. To make things even easier for the player, simply approaching a vehicle and long pressing the corresponding button will make Cole’s partner “drive” to the next location (it simply fades the screen to black and transports you to your chosen waypoint). I would caution against doing this, given that driving around is the simplest way to discover new landmarks and come across the street crime side missions.\n\nSpeaking of side missions, there are a total of 40 street crime cases available while playing through each bureau desk (except for Patrol). These unassigned cases range from minor crimes like petty theft to more serious ones like bank robberies. While driving around during a case, a call might come in on the dispatch about one such case or the player can simply stumble upon the crime in progress by driving in the direction of a red figure on their mini map. If the player fails to complete all 40 unassigned cases while playing through the main story they can select Cases from the main menu and pick “Streets of L.A.”, a free-roaming mode that allows you to complete the street crime cases from that particular bureau. Each bureau has its own set of street crimes.\n\nDespite how convenient I found the waypoint navigation system in LA Noire to be, there was one major drawback that made getting around particularly obnoxious when I was just starting out. Unlike practically every other game of its type, there is no line indicating what direction the player should go in on the mini map. Instead, the player can tap the respective button on their controller and Cole’s partner will indicate whether the player needs to turn left, right or continue going straight. This annoyed me to no end when I began my playthrough. I even found myself thinking, “at least Crazy Taxi had a damn arrow.” As I became more familiar with the map layout I didn’t have to rely on my partner for directions as much. However, not having clear indication of where I needed to go meant getting lost and getting lost meant significant downtime on stream that potentially motivated viewers to go elsewhere for their entertainment.\n\nDuring the rides between different points of interest on a case, Phelps and his partner engage in chit chat. Some of these lines of dialogue have to do with the case being handled while others reveal intimate details behind the personal lives of the two men. Cole has — at best — diplomatic, if not outright hostile relationships with nearly all of his partners. This makes it all the more special when either of the two detectives in the vehicle opens up about their private lives. For example, Rusty Galloway (voiced by actor Michael McGrady of ‘Southland’ fame) confesses to having been married and divorced three times — not too shocking for a cynic in the throes of alcoholism. Perhaps the most significant revelation is when Phelps tells his Vice partner, Roy Earle (Adam John Harrington), that he is married with children. Earle uses that information, along with knowledge of the affair his partner is having with singer and German exile Elsa Lichtmann (Erika Heynatz & Claudia Brucken), to protect himself from the consequences of his rampant corruption in the Vice bureau — all at the expense of Phelps’ reputation. The car conversations also expose Phelps as a stickler for the rules. His do-gooder personality — endearing at first — can become quite grating over time, especially as the player comes across more and more three dimensional characters during their gameplay.\n\nUpon arriving at a crime scene Cole is informed of the details of the case and left to examine the deceased. I quite like the fact that the player does not need to be too precise when arriving at locations for the opening cutscene to commence. The bodies of the deceased vary greatly in appearance — some with their eyes rolled into the backs of their heads and others entirely charred (during the Arson cases specifically). Typically one can examine the head, arms and torso of the victim. Cole often turns the heads of the victims to reveal ligature marks on their necks. Sometimes whether or not a victim is (or was) wearing a ring is relevant to the case. Other times victims will have objects in their hands that are of use to the detectives. In cases where the torso can be examined, it is usually because the victim has a wallet identifying them in their jacket pocket. After examining the body, the player is meant to look around the general area for clues. A special ability called “Intuition”, which is not always available to the player, can reveal the exact locations of all relevant clues. Some clues come in the form of objects that need to be manipulated by moving the left joystick. This game mechanic can be particularly annoying in the sense that the player has to hold the joystick in a precise position for a period of time in order for Phelps to properly examine the clue. Apart from the clues there are often miscellaneous objects scattered about. At first I thought it was kind of funny that instead of finding a clue I came across a piece of trash. However, as I progressed in the game and the locations that needed investigating grew larger, I became a bit irritated at the fact that so many of the objects I was picking up were completely irrelevant. Having to wade through so much junk in order to find a handful of clues at any given spot ruined the pace of the game for me. In my opinion, the Intuition skill should not be point based. Instead, it should be available to use twice during a case — once for a location of your choosing and the next for a line of questioning of your preference.\n\nSometimes witnesses or persons of interest are readily available at the crime scene. It is better to interrogate these individuals after you have found all possible clues at that location, as each clue opens up a potential line of questioning or serves as evidence for Cole when he is accusing the witness. I’m willing to bet that anyone who is familiar with LA Noire, even if they’ve never played the game before, is also somewhat familiar with the interrogation mechanic in the game. A clip of Detective Phelps interrogating Oswald Jacobs went viral several years ago because of just how expressive the witness’ face is. New motion capture technology allowed for cameras to pick up on an actor’s subtle facial movements and accurately display them on their character model. Facial expressions were always billed as an essential part of the interrogation process when the game first came out, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t pay much attention to them when I was playing. Logic, evidence and a bit of social skills goes a long way in helping to decide whether you play good cop, bad cop or accuse the individual being questioned. Do not assume that your ability to ace the interrogations depends heavily on your capacity to accurately read facial expressions.\n\nLA Noire is — in fact — a tale of two stories. At the forefront you have Cole Phelps’ rise through the ranks of the LAPD. This is the most evident storyline in that in unfolds right in front of the player’s eyes in real time. The player is immersed in it and without the ability to skip cutscenes, its quite difficult to miss out on Cole’s story unless the player is getting up and leaving the room every time a cutscene plays. In the background, however, evolves a big-picture storyline that eventually takes center stage and upends the routine pace of the game. In short, the Marines Cole served with in the 6th Regiment come across military surplus morphine and illegally distribute it. One of those veterans, Courtney Sheldon (Chad Todhunter), finds his way to a primary antagonist in the game, Dr. Harlan J. Fontaine — a clinical psychologist who sounds entirely too much like Frank Underwood from ‘House of Cards’ for me to not mention. Fontaine is voiced by Peter Blomquist, who also voices Micah Bell in Red Dead Redemption (guy must have a thing for irredeemable villains). Sheldon and Fontaine form a student-mentor relationship and Fontaine agrees to treat another Marine, Ira Hogeboom (J. Marvin Campbell), while also taking the surplus morphine that Sheldon has access to for supposed medical use. Fontaine promises to invest the funds gained from the sale of the surplus morphine into housing for war veterans. In reality, Fontaine is manipulating Sheldon the entire time and never plans on actually building homes for GIs. Instead he becomes an investor in Leland Monroe’s (John Noble of ‘Lord of the Rings’ fame) Suburban Redevelopment Fund, which is running an insurance scam with the aide of some of the highest-ranking figures in Los Angeles.\n\nFontaine is a central figure in LA Noire and 90% of his story unfolds entirely in the background. If that sounds strange — that's because it is. Scattered throughout different locations on the game map are thirteen newspapers that tell the tale of Fontaine and his associates. Upon coming across one of these newspapers, the player has the option of triggering a cutscene revolving around Fontaine or Sheldon. Although the newspapers are difficult to miss as one progresses through the game, there's never any indication of just how significant these cutscenes are — without which the events towards the latter half of the main story make much less sense. I was ready to treat these newspapers just like the newspaper clippings in Red Dead Redemption 2, cute little collectibles that mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Looking back, I’m just glad I chose to watch most of those cutscenes anyway.\n\nMuch like the newspaper cutscenes, the importance of the war flashbacks that play at the end of every mission is not immediately apparent. These flashbacks are essential to understanding the dynamics between Cole and some of the other Marines the player encounters throughout the game. I strongly recommend paying attention during these as well.\n\nAfter Cole’s fall from grace — thanks in no small part to the actions of the self-serving Roy Earle — I found myself controlling an entirely different character for the first time. Playing as Investigator Jack Kelso was jarring to say the least. I had grown emotionally attached to Cole Phelps and while his affair did dim the rose colored glasses through which I saw him, I was ready for Cole to have his redemption arc. Kelso’s section of the game presents the sharpest deviation from the routine gameplay yet. Sure, the pursuit of the BD Killer at the very end of the Homicide desk is quite distinct from anything the game asks players to do beforehand, but at the end of the day I still felt like I was chasing after a suspect and looking to put him away just as I had done many times before. With Kelso its not as clear what the endgame is. He’s not a detective or an officer of any kind for that matter and the bureau responsible for tackling figures like Leland Monroe (Kelso’s primary antagonist) has already expressed disinterest in taking his actions seriously. The Kelso section is also the first time the player finds themselves without a partner, which unfortunately means no one to rely on for directions while driving.\n\nThe change of pace after beginning the Kelso section felt like going from an American procedural cop show like ‘Law & Order’ to the end of an action movie. In true action movie fashion, our hero Cole Phelps gets his redemption, but at the price of his life. Something struck a sour note during the final confrontation between Kelso and Ira Hogeboom — a disturbed veteran from the 6th Regiment hiding out in the River Tunnels — that I just couldn’t get through this review without mentioning. The game presents Kelso killing off Ira as a positive. It insinuates that Ira is better off dead. While Hogeboom is no saint, he is suffering from severe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder — due in large part to having been ordered by then-Lieutenant Cole Phelps to torch a cave filled with civilians during WWII. Given what a significant issue PTSD is among veterans in the US, I found the game’s handling of Ira’s demise to be a bit disappointing. Ira deserved proper treatment, not a quack doctor like Fontaine. To be fair, I don’t think there was much in the way of awareness or availability of proper mental health care for the average Joe in the 1940s. Its just fun to imagine an alternate timeline where Ira escapes the fate that befalls every other member of the 6th Regiment (with the exception of Kelso) and recovers from being Fontaine’s Frankenstein monster, eventually leading a semi-normal life on a farm somewhere.\n\nIra also lacks “final boss” energy. Fontaine — from the very beginning — is presented as an unscrupulous and unrepentant manipulator. Given that he ruined the lives of so many of the men Cole proudly served with, it would’ve been a fitting end to see someone wholly evil like Fontaine square off with someone almost entirely good like Phelps. If not Fontaine then Roy Earle would’ve made an equally fitting — if not better — last antagonist. Earle is the polar opposite of Phelps, a crooked cop who sees his purpose as managing crime instead of eradicating it. Earle throws Phelps under the bus to save himself, destroying Phelps’ family and reputation in the process. These two are natural enemies and the fact that the game ends with Earle eulogizing Phelps made me feel just a bit ill.\n\nI couldn’t help but choke up after seeing Cole’s casket draped in the flag during the closing moments of the main story. Going by chat’s reaction, they were pretty moved as well. I’ve spoken at length on stream about how Red Dead Redemption 2 impacted me on a personal level. Arthur Morgan remains in the eyes of many as the best video game character in history. That playthrough could not have come at a more fitting time in my life. Arthur Morgan made being a decent person seem worthwhile. In contrast, Cole’s is a tragic tale — someone who seemed destined for greatness, but who’s one mistake lead directly to the destruction of his family and ultimately, his death. While infidelity would hardly break a person in the present day the way that it did Cole in 1940’s America, its hard not to look at how harsh and unforgiving we’ve become as a society when it comes to judging the faults of others — particularly those who excel in their chosen fields. Do-gooders can sometimes fall the hardest. Everyone assumes that if a decent person falters, its because they were putting on an act from the beginning. Those who are harsh towards Cole following the revelation of his affair have hardly the same tone for the openly corrupt individuals that make up the Vice desk. If Cole Phelps leaves any sort of legacy its in the people saved from his dogged investigating — the women spared after the BD Killer was no more and the families safe in their homes after the Suburban Redevelopment Fund was exposed. Cole’s desire to stay on the job even after being disgraced and his lack of self-pity are admirable. There's a lesson there to be learned about why doing right by others is more important than personal glory.\n\nIts hard to imagine an LA Noire 2 gracing our computers and consoles one day. The development team, Team Bondi, faced a slew of accusations from former staff members concerning long work hours and verbal abuse. Just three months after the release of LA Noire, Team Bondi transferred its assets to KMM Interactive Entertainment and went out of business. However, Rockstar retained ownership of LA Noire’s IP, meaning they have the right to release a sequel whenever they want. In the mean time, we can only speculate as to what a second installment would look like. Would players find themselves starting off where they last left — only this time as Jack Kelso? Would the developers bring back any of the characters from the previous game at all?\n\nIts not hard to see LA Noire fans excited to play as Kelso. The final war flashback shows him to be just as principled as Phelps. The few moments he spends with Elsa reveal Jack to be more charming than Cole. The closing scene inside the chapel during Cole’s funeral, where Kelso embraces having been neither Cole’s friend nor his enemy, reveal the kind of complexity and three dimensionality that players have come to expect from protagonists in Rockstar titles. A safehouse for Kelso — to be expected in a modern LA Noire with a proper open world — would give developers a reason to deviate from the police station → crime scene → point of interest routine that dominated so much of LA Noire’s original gameplay. Speaking of a proper open world, it would be nice to see Kelso roam around the game map in-between missions as a private investigator, spontaneously encountering the occasional side mission. Unfortunately, Rockstar seems more occupied with its more recent projects, so until they say otherwise us LA Noire fans will be left wanting. There is, however, a clear path forward if they ever chose to make a sequel — at least in my eyes.\n\nSummary:\n\nLA Noire requires the player’s concentration without overwhelming them with visual input or time-sensitive tasks. The graphics hold up quite nicely for a game released over a decade ago. As far as original scores go, this is the best in-game music I’ve come across yet. Gameplay can often feel repetitive — at least until the end of the Homicide desk. Shooting and hand-to-hand combat, which I didn’t touch upon much in this review, feel quite dated. Getting around can be either convenient or annoying depending on which aspects of the navigation you focus on. Car handling is more comparable to GTA IV than GTA V. Although a lot of fun, the game lacks that big title feel one often associates with other Rockstar titles. The main characters all have realistic personalities, although Phelps is lacking some complexity that even an affair with a German exile singer couldn't afford him. The overall plot, while hard to follow at times, does wrap up quite nicely. There are no loose ends or questions left unanswered, at least from what I could tell. 3.5/5 stars.\n\nI had a great time playing LA Noire on stream. Chat was engaged with the story until the very end. This was the most successful playthrough I’ve done when it comes to total view count. I have a feeling that LA Noire and Cole Phelps will occupy my mind for the foreseeable future just like Red Dead Redemption 2 and Arthur Morgan stuck with me for months after completing the main story. I can recommend this game to anyone who, like myself, loves media from the time period LA Noire is set in. While the open world leaves much to be desired — the sheer beauty of the game world, the amazing music and engaging plot can keep any player mesmerized for days.
