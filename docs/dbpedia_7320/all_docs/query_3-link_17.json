        "text": "BONDI 'TIL WE FUCKING DIE!\n\nThe Bondi Boys Motor Club (BBMC), alternatively the Bondi Boys & Babes Motor Club, is a 1% outlaw motor club that operates out of Vespucci Beach, Vespucci. It was created by Irwin Dundee.\n\nGeneral Description[]\n\nThe Bondi Boys Motor Club (BBMC) is a 1% outlaw motor club and terrorist organization known for its chaotic approach to life and its adherence to the philosophy of \"sending it,\" inspired by its leader, Prime Minister Irwin Dundee. The Bondi Boys MC was reborn on January 23rd, 2024, the club is headquartered in Vespucci Beach, Vespucci where the Billabong serves as its primary base of operations. The BBMC has become synonymous with this location, continuing a legacy that stretches back to April 8th, 2021.\n\nClub Attire and Identity[]\n\nBBMC members, including patched members and prospects, are often seen wearing distinctive blue denim jackets and vests adorned with patches. The most prominent patch is the large Bondi Boys patch on the back. The original kuttes (jackets) were hand-sewn by Dundee, the club's founder, but with this new variation of the club, Finley Milton asked Dundee if he wanted new kuttes with an updated design and patch to which Dee said yes. The new kuttes have variations for different club ranks.\n\nResurgence of the BBMC[]\n\nIn the previous iteration of the club, the club faced significant challenges due to its aggressive posture and extreme criminal acts, attracting a lot of attention from state authorities. Barry Benson's iteration of the BBMC, which he led after he and then-Enforcer Collin McKinley, removed Dundee in a violent coup d'etat, was subject to a RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) investigation by the San Andreas government. Jack Ripley, a Trooper Sergeant with the San Andreas State Police, issued a final warning to the BBMC, ordering them to cease all activities in Vespucci or face forced removal. The BBMC responded defiantly, firing RPGs at the authorities, ripping up the notice, and mailing back a printed HD photo of the entire club making obscene gestures. The government responded by deploying a military force, including tanks and jets, to dismantle the club in Vespucci. In the aftermath of the Battle for the Billy, club members were rounded up, imprisoned, and deported, with their kuttes and patches stripped from them. Those who escaped went into hiding and faced severe reprisal if they congregated together as a club. This led to the club's dissolution, and soon after, the entire city's governance collapsed. Five years later when the city reopened, former club members who still followed Barry opted to build a new motor club, the Already Dead MC (ADMC), as a loophole against the RICO.\n\nOn January 15th, 2024, Barry Benson reached out to Dundee. Barry stated he and his new club decided they would not claim The Billabong as turf, choosing instead to establish at a different location instead. He suggested that Dundee reclaim The Billabong, pointing out that it had always been his territory. Barry believed that Dundee was the rightful leader to re-establish the BBMC, rather than allowing a different group to take over. Dundee had already been in talks with former members of the Bang Boys Syndicate to reform. After a week of carefully considering what Barry had said, Dundee began rebuilding the BBMC, with Tommy Puff and James Kelly as his first two recruits and new founders of the newest iteration of the club. Together, they reclaimed the Billabong, reasserting control over Vespucci Beach and declaring it the official turf of the reconstituted BBMC. This move marked the beginning of a new era for the club, with Dundee once again at the helm.\n\nTerritory & Assets[]\n\nThe BBMC claims the Vespucci district in Los Santos, a coastal area known for its beaches and canals. Their territory includes the neighborhoods of Vespucci Beach, Vespucci Canals, and Puerto Del Sol, extending from the southern edge of the Vespucci Pier, bordering Del Perro, to the beaches of Vespucci Beach. The northeastern boundary meets Little Seoul, while the southeastern border crosses the canal into La Puerta.\n\nIrwin Dundee, often refers to the Vespucci district as \"Little Vespucci.\" This nickname reflects the club's vision for transforming the area into a lawless zone, akin to a miniature version of a Sanguine Isle. The BBMC has expressed intentions to create a space where traditional laws hold less sway, with plans to challenge the Unified Police Department's authority and fiercely defend their turf, Vespucci. To help achieve this vision, the BBMC has entered into a partnership with various gangs and clubs, including Chang Gang, The Hidden & Kilo Tray Ballas to all push the same weed strain known as Sam Gaas and collectively defend Vespucci from other gangs and law enforcement. This has turned Vespucci into a major hub for criminal activity due to so many gangs and crews making money and being in proximity to eachover, which has fostered more business investment into the region in both civilian and criminal ways.\n\nThe club's main base, the Billabong, is a gated city block located along the Vespucci boardwalk, with access points from Magellan Avenue and Melanoma Street. This area is known as the Billabong, or the \"Billy.\" It serves as the BBMC's home and operational center, where they conduct meetings and maintain their presence in the area. Warning signs at the entrance deter trespassers, and the club is known to respond with force if their territory is breached, especially confrontation with law enforcement who enter the club's turf without permission.\n\nVehicles[]\n\nAs a Motor Club, the BBMC are muscle car enthusiasts, with members owning a classic or modern muscle car painted in the club's signature Classic Bondi Blue: a metallic midnight blue with an ultra blue pearlescent finish, or the new Bondi Blue, a metallic blue (#011247) with an ultra blue (#0a9df1) pearlescent finish. The Imponte Dukes is the club's official car, but other vehicles, such as motorcycles, off-road vehicles, and SUVs, are also used, provided they fit the club's aesthetic. All vehicles are painted in the new Bondi Blue to maintain a consistent club identity."
