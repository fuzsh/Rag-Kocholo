        "text": "Name: Governor Tim Walz\n\nAge: 60\n\nHometown: Mankato, Minnesota\n\nOccupation: Governor of Minnesota\n\nTime Running: Since 2012\n\nReason For Running: I run for my physical and mental health, as well as the wonderful community.\n\nLike so many people, running began as a means to an end for me. When I was younger, I played football and basketball, and ran track to stay conditioned for my main sports. I then spent 24 years in the National Guard, so I was running at that time to stay in shape.\n\nToday, though, I view running as a hobby that is both a mental stress reliever and a great form of exercise. I turned 60 this year and feel inspired more than ever by the benefits of running. It was about 10 years ago that I started to take running more seriously, and I’ve never looked back.\n\nWhen I first started out, my goal was to run a 5K in under 20 minutes, so I made sure to get in tempo runs and hill work. But running has evolved for me over the years. My goals today are to stay consistent and enjoy the process. I want to still be running when I’m 80 years old, and for that to happen it has to be fun.\n\nRunning has become an important part of my routine. It’s how I decompress and prepare for big events. Before any major event, my team knows to schedule time for me to get a four to five mile run in. I’ve found that even before the most stressful events, if I’ve gone for a run, I’m calmer and more collected.\n\nIf you know Minnesota, you know we are a people who generally love the outdoors. Minnesotans are active year round, and both St. Paul and Minneapolis are almost always in the top 10 healthiest cities. I may be biased, but the Twin Cities are some of the best running cities in the country.\n\nPlus, it’s not bad politics either—I’ve never had anybody yell anything negative at me when I’m running. With one exception: a fellow runner told me during the Twin Cities 10-miler that he disagreed with everything I do in office, but was proud of me for being a committed runner—and that’s okay!\n\nI’ve learned there’s no more welcoming community than runners. Whether it’s in races, or a Sunday morning run along the river, the running community is wholly supportive of one another.\n\nOne of the most memorable races I’ve run was at the back of a half marathon in Rochester, Minnesota. I was an honoree starter and wasn’t planning on running, but another race starter shamed me into it. So I jumped in and caught up with the back of the pack, and those were some of the most inspirational people I’ve ever met in my life. They were cancer survivors, folks recovering from injuries, and some with prosthetics.\n\nFrom that experience, I learned the running community is one of the most resilient group of people you’ll ever meet. Those individuals weren’t running for time or to win age groups—they were out there to prove to themselves that they could do something amazing.\n\nI also love that I can take running with me wherever I go. There is something magical about running through the streets of a new city before it wakes up. It always feels special to see a city from a runner’s perspective.\n\nOver the years, running has allowed me to stay healthy and keep my head clear. It’s also allowed me to model living a healthy lifestyle for my children and community. My goal is to continue to run 18 to 22 miles a week for as long as possible, and I’m planning to run the Twin Cities 10 Mile this fall. I encourage everyone to get out there and start—because you can!\n\nThese three tips have made my running journey a success:\n\n1. Schedule your time to run\n\nIf you can carve out 30 to 40 minutes three or four times a week to get a run in, you will see the results for your mental and physical health, and if you stick with it, it’s life changing. You just have to make it a priority.\n\n2. Let go of worrying about pace and time\n\nI think we all go through a phase where it’s all about how fast we can run and hitting goals. But there are benefits in slowing down. Allow your running experience to be fun—find a community, join a running club, and get in some casual fun runs. My goal now is to make it to the finish, and I hope to still be running when I’m 80, so keeping it casual I hope will build my longevity in the sport.\n\n3. Run/walk if you’re just starting out\n\nCheck with your doctor of course, but if you’re intimidated by running or think you can’t, try the run/walk method. Run for 30 seconds, walk for 30 seconds, gradually build your time each day and week. Before you know it you'll be running a mile and will be hooked. Trust me, there is no one way a runner should look or pace you need to hit.\n\nGovernor Walz’s Must-Have Gear\n\n→ These shoes changed my life. I’m a big fan of Hokas—they’re extremely comfortable. They helped my running by keeping me injury=free.\n\n→ Balega socks: They are well-designed, lightweight, and prevent blisters."
