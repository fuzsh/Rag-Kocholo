        "text": "Local Bloke – Jack Warwick from Bondi\n\nBondi’s Jack Warwick is the founder of Only Everything, an agency that is fast becoming Australia’s leading youth entertainment brand. He shares his local favourites with The Beast…\n\nHow long have you lived here? Six years now. I was born in Sydney, grew up in Cowra and then did nine years in Brisbane before making my way to beautiful Bondi.\n\nWhy do you live here? Bondi is so unique and it genuinely ticks all the boxes for me – surf, sun, boutique shops, good food and wine. The fact we’re only 15 minutes from the CBD is also pretty handy.\n\nWhat’s your favourite beach? Bondi Beach, out at flat rock. You just can’t beat jumping in and out and lazing around on a beautiful summer’s day.\n\nWhat’s your favourite eatery? Drake. The food, the service and the vibe are perfect for a nice meal with good friends and family. Shout out to Ian and Joshy!\n\nWhere do you like to have a drink? Hotel Ravesis on a Friday night. A cold beer on the balcony listening to some tunes while the sun sets is pretty perfect.\n\nBest thing about the Eastern Suburbs? It would have to be the fact I’m never more than 15 minutes from my favourite locations – beaches, city, Centennial Park, office, etc.Worst thing about the Eastern Suburbs? Paying for parking every time you stop moving. It infuriates me.\n\nDo you have a favourite sporting team? I’m not a big sports guy. I’m more interested in business and creative projects.\n\nWhat music are you into at the moment? I listen to everything – house, hip-hop, soul, jazz, reggae. Every morning I wake I’ll throw on what I’m feeling that day. For me, it’s important to listen to different genres and diversify my taste.\n\nWho is your favourite person? It’d have to be my fiancée, Lauren. She inspires the hell out of me and really looks after me in every aspect of my life.\n\nWhat do you get up to on the weekends? Most of the time I’m at one of the weekly parties we run (el Rosa Friday at Hotel Ravesis, YOURS at the Beach Road on Saturday or Seadeck Sunday). If you haven’t attended one, pop in and say g’day for a beer on me.\n\nWhat do you do for work? Two years ago I started an agency called Only Everything. We’re part marketing/content production, part events/activations and we’re also slowly growing our own media network. We’re working towards becoming Australia’s leading youth entertainment brand. You can follow @onlyeverything.agency on Instagram to see what we’re about.\n\nWhat’s your favourite thing about work? I absolutely love what I do. Over time I’ve managed to design and build a business that touches on all my personal interests – marketing, events, entertainment, content.\n\nDo you have a favourite quote? “A rolling stone gathers no moss.”"
