Type Proprietary limited company Industry Computer and video games\n\nInteractive entertainment Fate Wound up Successors \"Balls\" Studios Sydney\n\nRockstar Sydney\n\nKennedy-Miller-Mitchell Interactive Defunct 5 October 2011 Headquarters Sydney, Australia\n\nTeam Bondi was an Australian independent third-party game developer. The company was responsible for the development of the Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 game L.A. Noire, which was published by Rockstar Games. An in-game trailer was released on 11 November 2010, which subsequently confirmed the release date as 17 May 2011.[1] L.A. Noire was both a critical and commercial success, but allegations of poor working conditions by several former staff members caused controversy for the developer. After failing to secure another game project, Team Bondi was placed into administration and liquidated. Kennedy Miller Mitchell bought the studio in August 2011.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe company was founded in 2003 by Brendan McNamara,[3] former Director of Development for Sony Computer Entertainment’s Team Soho Studio in London, writer and director of The Getaway.[4]\n\nMcNamara also founded sister company Depth Analysis.[5] Depth Analysis were responsible for the development of MotionScan, the award-winning[6][7] 3D motion capture technology which debuted in L.A. Noire.[8]\n\nGames developed[]\n\nTitle Year Platform Publisher Metacritic L.A. Noire 2011 PlayStation 3\n\nXbox 360\n\nMicrosoft Windows Rockstar Games 89/100[9] Whore of the Orient 2015 PlayStation 4\n\nXbox One\n\nMicrosoft Windows TBA N/A\n\nClosure[]\n\nOn 9 August 2011, numerous outlets reported that Team Bondi's intellectual property and assets had been sold to Kennedy Miller Mitchell, a Sydney-based multimedia production firm founded by Mad Max director George Miller and producer Byron Kennedy.\n\nAccording to forms lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission the business was placed into administration on 30 August 2011.[10][11]\n\nFurther documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 5 October 2011 revealed that following a meeting of creditors a decision had been made that Team Bondi be wound up. The liquidator handled the sale of Team Bondi's remaining assets and payment of outstanding debts.[12][13][14][15][16][17]\n\nOn 7 October 2011, documents provided to the Australian Securities And Investments Commission revealed that Team Bondi owed creditors £900K, with unpaid wages or bonuses accounting for over 75 percent of the L.A. Noire developer's debt. 33 staff credited for their work on L.A. Noire were owed a combined $1,074,283.28 in unpaid wages or bonuses. Among those, studio head Brendan McNamara claimed to be owed $102,495.16, general manager Vicky Lord $99,155.21 and gameplay lead David Heironymus $43,652. Depth Analysis was also reported to be owed $145,795.83.[18]\n\nAccording to McNamara, Team Bondi closed down because they had not signed another project in the time they needed to. McNamara stated \"we got a lot of bad press about what it was like to work with us and our conditions. That, obviously, didn't come at the right time. To do a deal for a major video game probably takes about a year. We didn't start running around doing that stuff until well after the game was finished. That's the problem when a game is all-consuming and you need to get out there and do whatever you need to do to get people to know it and interested. They would probably be the two main things, I'd say.\"[19]\n\nSpeaking to Official PlayStation Magazine (UK), Brendan McNamara talked about the end days of the studio behind the game:\n\n\"It was a long, painful process, but making games is like making films in that it’s a marathon, not a sprint – and some people come into the process not knowing that. I’d love to spend more time at home with my family and kids. We run things differently now – we have flexi-hours, for example. But everybody has their view on who’s the worst boss in the world, and maybe that’s me. I’ve read some amazing things about Steve Jobs in his biography, and I’ve never seen him get as vilified any way as much as I have. Sam Peckinpah [’70s film director] fired [plenty of] people off one movie, and nobody said a thing. Werner Herzog pulled a gun on Klaus Kinski to get him to finish a movie! Obviously I don’t compare myself to any of those people…\"[20]\n\nFuture[]\n\nAfter liquidation, Team Bondi's assets and most of its staff went to Kennedy-Miller Mitchell. Some of the former employees have gone to work in different Rockstar studios. Rockstar retained the L.A. Noire intellectual property.\n\nInterviewed in November 2011, Kennedy Miller Mitchell heads George Miller and Doug Mitchell commented on the success of L.A. Noire and the acquisition of Team Bondi. Miller said that many staff members from Team Bondi \"immediately went to work on Happy Feet Two.\"[21]\n\nKMM also acquired the rights to Brendan McNamara's next game, titled Whore of the Orient, which McNamara describes as “one of the great untold stories of the 20th Century.”[22] Miller and Mitchell commented on this and another project, a game supporting the Mad Max sequel Fury Road, to which the remnants of Team Bondi may also be attached. According to Mitchell, 'With the government’s support we can immediately go forward with two games. Warner Bros is standing by, willing to do Fury Road; the incentive would bring it back here in a New York minute. It’s not immediately obvious but the potential in the video games sector is massive'.[21]\n\nOn 30 August 2012, the former Team Bondi staff officially confirmed they are developing Whore of the Orient that is to be released on next-gen consoles and PC.[23] In April 2013 it was reported that the title was still seeking backing and a publisher.[24] It reportedly ceased production on the game in April, but received $200,000 from an Australian investor in June to continue development.[25] On 2 August, 2013, the first Whore of the Orient gameplay video leaked onto the web.[26]\n\n\"Balls\" Studios Sydney[]\n\n\"Balls\" Studios Sydney Type Development studio of \"Balls\" Industry Interactive entertainment\n\nPorting\n\nGame development Predecessors Team Bondi Successors UltraNitro Studios Australia Defunct 2014\n\n\"Balls\" Studios Sydney was a game development team for \"Balls\", located at Sydney, Australia.\n\nWhile initially focusing on developing brand new titles, in recent years \"Balls\" Studios Sydney has taken the responsibility of porting \"Balls\" titles to the Wii, Wii U, \"Balls\" Durango consoles and PC.
