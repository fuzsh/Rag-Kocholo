A few features include:\n\nImproved UI performance\n\nNetwork streaming improvement for media player mode\n\nOptimized performance for high bitrate mkv files\n\nAdded support for zlib compressed subtitles in MKV files\n\nVarious subtitle support fixes\n\nThere’s a lot more included and the full details can be found over at Geektonic! I may not be a Sage user myself, but I love seeing a company push updates like this. I does tend to make me a bit jealous since updates to MCE usually only come with OS changes. Here’s to hoping that changes soon and MS can take a page from this small company."
