        "text": "I run a DVR software call SageTV. I have 3 NASes I am trying to replace with TrueNAS. These are DLink, Lenovo and Buffalo NASes. On all three of these I can connect to shares I have created on them. I have created SMB shares on TrueNAS and can see them in Windows 7 and 10, but when I try to connect to TrueNAS in SageTV I can see the server, but no shares show up. I can map TrueNAS as a network drive and I can get to the TrueNAS shares that way but I really don’t think this is an optimal solution. I have been playing with permissions for the last week and nothing seems to work. I could use some guidance at this point in how to make the SMB shares show up in SageTV.\n\nCan you share how to configured the SMB Share in TrueNAS?\n\nAre you sure there’s no option to manually enter a share location in SageTV?\n\nYes, I am possitive I cannot enter an IP and the share. This works just fine on all my other NASes and they are all Linux based. What do you want to see as to how I configured the SMB share?\n\nYou’re sharing the root dataset. You shouldn’t do this. (I thought the GUI prevented this.)\n\nWith TrueNAS, you’re meant to create child datasets, save data to them, and then share those out.\n\nYes, that seemed to work. I did not know about that option. Since everything was working in Windows 7 and 10 I thought the SMB service was working as intended. Thank you so much. I’ve spent nearly a week trying to work this out on my own."
