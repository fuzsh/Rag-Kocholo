Like all good things, it came to an end after Google bought the company and euthanized the consumer product. We thought it was the end, and it was, until the spirit of FOSS breathed [‚Ä¶]\n\nRead more\n\nSome pretty crazy news passed my way by our friend George S., linking to a forum post by Jeff from (formerly) SageTV, announcing that they somehow convinced Google to open source the SageTV code! What does this mean? It‚Äôs too early to tell, but given how involved software developers were in making SageTV a great experience, I have a hunch [‚Ä¶]\n\nRead more\n\nCableCARD is the technology that enables HTPC users to build the ultimate DVR. The kind of multi-tuner DVR backed by insane amounts of storage that makes it easy to ‚Äúmeh‚Äù when a company proudly proclaims the capabilities of their ‚Äì not quite as spec‚Äôful ‚Äì aspirational kit. It has drawback though, especially if you prefer not to use Microsoft Windows [‚Ä¶]\n\nRead more\n\nAs previously noted, I‚Äôm working on upgrading the server in my house, which currently runs Windows Home Server (v1). While I don‚Äôt plan to use Windows Home Server 2011 for anything but backups, this guide should assist others who are thinking about how to upgrade WHS to WHS 2011, particularly migrating all your data out of the drive pool.

An unsanctioned effort by third-party developers is underway to bring SageTV front-end functionality to [‚Ä¶]\n\nRead more\n\nI have to agree with most of what Brent says in his editorial on what Google hopes to do with SageTV ‚Äì especially the points on AllVid. Whatever they have in store for us, I‚Äôm looking forward to reviewing it üôÇ It‚Äôs been three weeks since Google gobbled up the tiny Home Theater PC company, SageTV.

Greetings, We‚Äôre writing to let you know that SageTV has been acquired by Google.

Neat mod! Last time we were talking about the mod instead of doing the modding. This part will focus on the actual mod, with lots of pictures to help along [‚Ä¶]\n\nRead more\n\nSageTV V7 Installation Guide If you are new to SageTV getting it installed and everything like ISO playback and HD audio/video playback working can be bit of a challenge; so when I needed to do a V7 install a few days ago I decided to document the process to hopefully make it easier for everyone to get the server [‚Ä¶]\n\nRead more"
