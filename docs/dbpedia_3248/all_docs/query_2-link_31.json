        "text": "This Tools provides a way to keep your watched history synced FROM Plex Server To Trakt.tv (IT will not do history prior to tool Installation) it uses WebHooks to Accomplish this so a PLEX PASS Subscription is needed to use WebHooks. Trakt.tv has a build in tool for the same thingbut requires Trakt.tv VIP Subscription to use it. GoPlaxt is free and doesn't require Trakt.tv VIP subscription. Original Dev has stop development after Trakt.tv added it to the VIP subscription, However the dev (XandarStrike) has stated he will continue to merge PR's to the project but will not answer if any issues arrise. This is the SELFHOSTED version of the same tool that dev (XandarStrike) offers freely on his server at https://plaxt.astandke.com/ Requirements: - Create a new API App on Trakt.tv - Enable Scrobble and Check-in - Set Redirect URL to: - https://sub.example.com:/authorize (keep in mind your Plaxt instance must be accessible to all the Plex servers you intend to play media from. ) - http://your-local-ip:8000/authorize - Set JavaScript (cors) origins to: - http://your-local-ip:8000 Make Note of CLIENT ID and CLIENT SECRET this are REQUIRED.\n\nSageTV is an Open Source PVR and Media Player Configuration /opt/sagetv - This is the base directory for the server and other sagetv related files. Under this location there can be a 'server' directory and if the existing 'server' directory exists it will be upgraded. /var/media - Path for sagetv recordings and videos. Under this directory there should be (or will be created) a 'tv' directory where SageTV recordings will get recorded. /var/tv - Path for tv recordings if you want to store those in an alternate location. /var/mediaext - Path for extra media files. This can be whatever you want, but you will configure SageTV to look for videos, music, pictures, etc from this location. Permissions PUID - Should be the 'nobody' user for unRAID PGID - Should be the 'users' group for unRAID VIDEO_GUID - Should be the 'video' group for unRAID (used if you use PCI/USB video capture devices) Notes SageTV will need to use 'host' or 'br0' (set a unique IP) networking, so while the ports are defined, they are not required to be edited. Without 'host' or 'br0', sagetv will think your network clients are connecting as remote placeshifters, and present the placeshifter login. If using br0 mode (preferred) as the IP is unique the WebUI port of 8080 will not have any issues. If running in host mode, make sure you don't have other docker containers that are using port 8080. If you do, then EITHER change SageTV Jetty Port (in plugin configuration) after install, or, update the other docker containers to NOT use port 8080. On every Docker start, it will check for a new version of SageTV and install it, if it exists. You can force it to stay on a sepcific version by setting the Version in the template. The Version must match exactly the version tag from the github releases. There are Java 8, 11, and 16 version of these containers.
