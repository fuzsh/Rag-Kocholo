        "text": "I'm sure this question has been asked before, but can anyone give me a step by step guide to getting the Program listings in MediaPortal 1 RC 2 to work in the USA using a free service?\n\nI've read the sticky in the xmltv section but that uses Zap2it - gone, then I followed a link using CT TV listings - gone too. I'm aware of schedules direct, but I would like to avoid this if i can.\n\nSo far I have tried xmlTV and webEPG both to no luck. I've read the wiki step by step guide for WebEPG too - no luck. Concerning WebEPG, it mentions an XMLtv folder for the manual directions - which isn't there, and no mention of creating it. Speaking of which when I click on webEPG.exe (not the WebEPG - conf.exe) nothing happens, and my firewall is configured appropriately.\n\nFor xmlTV I've read what I can find. I've downloaded it and extracted the 32 binary and I've configured MediaPortal to look for the executable. I've selected the grabber tv_grab_na_dd, in the scheduler tab of the Program guide section of the MediaPortal Configuration but when it runs it asks for Schedule Direct info. Same if I try the grabber TVguide.xml File. Which I have no TVguide.xml anywhere on my PC I can find.\n\nI have had luck using YApi2XML, but the link at https://forum.team-mediaportal.com/za...ht=yahoo+guide is old and seems to not have any final solutions either.\n\nIf you've continued reading this far - thanks! Here's my predicament. I have a new TV tuner (ATI Theater Pro 550) on my Windows XP SP3 PC. Came with Cyberlinks PowerCinema - major problems, tried trials of other's SageTV worked the BEST and I loved it. but expensive and no FM support. Don't know why everyone seems to like BeyondTV - I had audio rings and glitches. Trials expired - so do I buy or try the free guys. Tried gb-pvr same audio glitches as mentioned above, trying MediaPortal and so far I REALLY like it, if I could get this program guide thing to work then I'm \"sold\". I have been able to auto tune all my channels and FM stations every thing works well except for this darn problem. I've spent what time I have in the past 4 days trying to fix this - reading and learning, but nothing, Is it really this hard? Since I'm in USA, do I just need to sign up for schedules direct? If so why pay them, when I chould just use that money and buy another PVR, where I won't have this problem. Can someone help?\n\nThanks in adavance."
