        "text": "sagetv.exe is a process belonging to SageTV from Frey Technologies, LLC.\n\nNon-system processes like sagetv.exe originate from software you installed on your system. Since most applications store data on your hard disk and in your system's registry, it is likely that your computer has suffered fragmentation and accumulated invalid entries which can affect your PC's performance.\n\nIn Windows Task Manager, you can see what CPU, memory, disk and network utilization is causing the SageTV process. To access the Task Manager, hold down the Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys at the same time. These three buttons are located on the far left of your keyboard.\n\nsagetv.exe has not been assigned a security rating yet. The sagetv.exe file should be located in the folder C:\\Program Files\\sagetv\\sagetv. Otherwise it could be a Trojan.\n\nMany non-system processes that are running can be stopped because they are not involved in running your operating system. sagetv.exe is used by 'SageTV'. This is an application created by 'Frey Technologies, LLC'.\n\nIf you no longer use SageTV, you can permanently remove this software and thus sagetv.exe from your PC. To do this, press the Windows key + R at the same time and then type 'appwiz.cpl'. Then find SageTV in the list of installed programs and uninstall this application.\n\nThis process is not considered CPU intensive. However, running too many processes on your system may affect your PCâ€™s performance. To reduce system overload, you can use the Microsoft System Configuration Utility (MSConfig) or the Windows Task Manager to manually find and disable processes that launch upon start-up.\n\nUse the Windows Resource Monitor to find out which processes and applications write/read the most on the hard drive, send the most data to the Internet, or use the most memory. To access the Resource Monitor, press the key combination Windows key + R and then enter 'resmon'.\n\nWhy is sagetv.exe giving me errors?\n\nMost sagetv issues are caused by the application executing the process. The surest way to fix these errors is to update or uninstall this application. Therefore, please search the Frey Technologies, LLC website for the latest SageTV update."
