        "text": "It has been nearly a month since the SageTV HD300 started shipping. Prior to the HD300 shipping I put together a brief writeup on the direction I hoped SageTV was heading towards, so I was anxious to give the HD300 a test run to see if it met my expectations. For this review I am going to spend most of the time focusing on the HD300 in standalone mode as in extender mode more of the focus would be on the SageTV 7 Media Center software and not the HD300. Enough talking, let’s get down and dirty.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nPrice: USD 149.95\n\nProcessor: Sigma SMP8654 SOC\n\nFile formats supported: AVI, ASF, MKV, MOV, MP4, Quicktime, MPEG-1, MPEG-2 PS, MPEG-2 TS, M2TS, BDMV Folder (BluRay), BluRay ISO, DVD ISO, DVD VIDEO_TS, VOB, M4A, MP3, FLAC, OGG, FLV, WAV, WMA\n\nVideo formats supported: MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, XVID, H.264 up to 1080p, WMV9/VC-1 up to 1080p, MJPEG, FlashVideo\n\nAudio formats supported: MP2, MP3, AAC, AAC-HE, ALAC, WMA, WMAPro, PCM, Vorbis (stereo only), FLAC, DolbyDigital/DolbyDigital+/DolbyTrueHD* (stereo down-mix or pass-through), DTS/DTS-HD/DTS-MA (stereo down-mix or pass-through)\n\n*DolbyTrueHD down-mix requires the DolbyDigital core track to be present\n\nCC/Subtitle formats supported: EIA-608(NTSC/ATSC/QAM Closed Captioning), DVB, SRT, SSA/ASS, VobSub (sub/idx, mkv), Nero MP4 VOB Subtitles, MP4 Text, SAMI, .sub (Subviewer/MicroDVD), DVD, BDMV, M2TS, PGS, multiple languages supported in all formats\n\nPlaylist formats supported: M3U, WPL, ASX, WAX, WVX\n\nMedia sources supported: Online Video, external USB Mass Storage Devices (FAT, NTFS, EXT2/3, HFS format), NAS or Mac/PC over SMB/CIFS, UPnP, SageTV Media Center\n\nKeyboard support: Wired or Wireless USB keyboards (US keyboard layout)\n\nWireless Network support: 802.11 b/g/n networks; USB wireless network adapters\n\nVideo Outputs: 1 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite (Component & Composite via breakout cable)\n\nAudio Outputs: Optical S/PDIF, HDMI, Left/Right analog audio output (analog audio output via breakout cable)\n\nMulti-Channel Audio Output: Multi-channel PCM audio output is supported over HDMI with up to 7.1 channels for PCM and FLAC audio formats; and up to 5.1 channels for WMAPro and AAC audio formats.

Nothing flashy, just some basic advertising.\n\nIncluded with the HD300 -\n\nSageTV HD Theater digital media receiver\n\nRemote control with batteries\n\nBreakout cable for composite video, component video and analog audio\n\nHDMI cable\n\n1.5 meter Ethernet cable\n\nPower adapter\n\nUser manual\n\nThe front of the HD300 is fairly basic. To the left are the typical decals. The right is the power LED, IR LED, and IR input for use with an IR extender.\n\nThe back of the HD300 includes 2 USB 2.0 ports, Ethernet 10/100 port, HDMI, Optical, and a combined Video Port (using the provided breakout cable will give you Composite or Component connections).\n\nThere is no power brick which is nice. However, I have to admit that I did not like the power plug. Based on the direction of the plugs the power adapter runs horizontally covering up nearby power outlets on my power conditioner (I ended up having to move plugs around to get this to fit). I would have preferred to have the plug designed so that the adapter was vertical when plugged in.\n\nOne thing you may have noticed is that the HD300 looks pretty small. It is small enough for me to easily palm with my hands. To really get a sense of how truly small it is, I decided to compare the HD300 with a Raisin muffin lying around.\n\nI also called on my body double (I only use him for stunts and standing in line at the pharmacy) to model the HD300. The HD300 could be the first HD media player that could be worn around in public!\n\nOne of the benefits of the size is that there are a lot of possibilities on where to store the HD300. I decided to purchase some Velcro tape at the local Home Depot and mount the HD300 behind an LCD TV. Two strips of Velcro tape along the bottom of the HD300 was all that was needed. Big thanks to PluckyHD for the Velcro tape suggestions and the interesting Home Depot commentary\n\nThe HD300 mounted without issue to the back of the LCD TV, keeping everything hidden.\n\nSince mounting the TV means I would lose line of site to operate the HD300 I simply plugged in the optional IR extender and mounted it to the upper corner of the TV.\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed with the size of the HD300, and even with the small size I felt I was dealing with a sturdy piece of equipment. I do admit that there is a geeky part of me that likes to have an “A/V looking” device, but in reality my devices are usually hidden anyhow. The HD300 is fanless which is a big plus (i.e. silent). Because of this the aluminum body does appear to get used as a heatsink, and although not scorching hot it did get very warm to the touch when in use.\n\nSetup:\n\nSetup was fairly easy to walk through. When the HD300 is powered on you will be taken to the main menu. The few items I like to confirm when first setting up a player is the Video Output, Audio Output, firmware updates, and set up my Media Library. From the Main Menu click on the “Settings” icon.\n\nYou will now be in the Setup Menu where you can access various settings.\n\nUnder Video Output you will have three options to choose from which are self explanatory.\n\nUnder Audio Output you will have four options to choose from. The Digital and Bitstream choices here may be a little confusing. The Digital PCM option is if you want the HD300 to decode all audio and send out as PCM (for example I use this setting when connecting the HD300 directly to a TV via HDMI since the TV cannot decode HD Audio). The Digital Bitstream option would send the audio through for the connected device to decode. However, this does not apply to HD Audio, so I am assuming with this option if you had a DTS(MA) audio track only the DTS core would be sent through. If you want the full HD Audio track sent through you would choose the HDMI 1.3 HD Audio Bitstream option.\n\nUnder System Update you can see what firmware version you are currently using as well as check for updates. You actually have two options for checking for firmware. You can either check for the most current stable firmware or if you want to live on the edge check for the most current beta firmware. To check for beta firmware while on the System Update screen with the remote type 2382 (i.e. BETA)\n\nTo add Media Libraries to the HD300 head back to the Main Menu and select the Folders icon. This should list out all available network paths. Since all my media is stored on my Windows Home Server I selected Browse the local Network.\n\nOnce you navigate to the folder where your media is located (in the example below I went to my Music Folder) click on the Info button on the remote where you should see an option to import this folder path. You can then select what content is in the folder, which then will determine what content will show on the corresponding Music/Videos/Pictures icons on the Main Menu.\n\nAfter paths have been added, the HD300 will go about importing the paths to its library. You will see a thinking glass icon in the upper right hand corner which indicates that the HD300 is in the process of importing a library or refreshing. If you have a large library be prepared to walk away from the HD300 for a while as it imports your library.\n\nOverall setup was quick and fairly easy to walk through. The only main issue I had was with the library import/refresh. The first time I set up my library paths it took easily over an hour for the import to complete, and I had no idea of the status as all I saw was the library import icon. It would be nice to give the user the option to see some sort of progress bar. Also, as you add new media you will need to refresh your imported media for it to show on the HD300. You can set the HD300 to automatically refresh every x number of hours, but once again the refresh takes too long in my opinion. I added two new movies to my server, ran the refresh manually, and it took over 20 minutes for the refresh to complete. This is something I would love to see sped up in the future.\n\nUI Appearance:\n\nThis is the area where I had hoped some more time was spent. The HD300 UI is not horrible, in particular when comparing to the stock UI of many other media players out there. However, it does have an outdated look and feel to it, and in its current form under Standalone mode there is no opportunity to enhance with 3rd party jukeboxes. The layout itself is straightforward and each category is clearly labeled on the main menu. In order to have your media appear under the Photos, Videos, or Music icons you need to have your media paths imported as mentioned in the Setup. If not you can still access your media via the Folders icon, but this means you will be drilling through a lot of folders and you will actually lose the ability to play back certain files (such as BluRay folders).\n\nWhen navigating through your media on the HD300 you will see thumbnails if available (it appears that the HD300 will display folder.jpg, and then if not available a snapshot of one of the files). Using Videos as an example, you can see below the Folders view which shows all folders available, how many videos are in each folder, and displays a thumbnail\n\nDrilling down to my “Movies Family HD” folder I can see each movie with the associated thumbnail. However, this view only works if your setup is like mine where each movie is in its own folder. If you have all your video files in one folder you will see all your videos but instead of the thumbnail you see below you instead will see a snapshot icon for each file (for example if you look at the Mobile folder above you see a snapshot of clouds which is from Bee Movie).\n\nIf you have metadata gathered in the SageTV format (I think it is .properties files) you can view details of each movie.\n\nMusic and Photos have the same type of interface/interaction as with Videos. Here are a couple more examples below\n\nWhen all is said and done I have mixed feeling about the UI. It is on par if not better then the stock UI of some other players. However, in standalone mode you are locked in to the UI you see. For me this is a big drawback as with other media players in my house (i.e. PCH, Dune, etc…) I can use a 3rd party jukebox such as YAMJ or Zappiti for a much more rich experience. It is not just looks, 3rd party jukeboxes can provide a much more usable interface which is key for the all important WAF. A perfect example of this would be TV Show support, navigating through my archived TV shows on the HD300 just doesn’t cut it and is a big negative for my wife.\n\nResponsiveness:\n\nOverall the HD300 felt relatively quick when navigating around, I definitely found it snappier then the previous HD200. Since the HD300 displays thumbnails/snapshots, at time page loads could be a little slow waiting for the thumbnails to appear. On a few occasions I got what I called the “Revolving Circle of Death” where the thinking circle icon would continuously rotate on my screen nonstop, requiring a reboot. For the most part navigating around the HD300 wasn’t too difficult or cumbersome, but I did encounter a few hiccups.\n\nNetwork Performance:\n\nOne of the more frequent questions I see asked when a media player is announced is if it support Gigabit network connectivity. This may be important if you are constantly storing and transferring files back and forth between the media player and a PC, but for streaming purposes 10/100 is more then adequate. The SageTV HD300 is 10/100 which I expected would be plenty for streaming my high bitrate media. Using smb (you can see how I set up here) to connect my HD300 to my Windows Home Server, not once did I have issues playing back all my high bitrate content. This is definitely a plus as not all media players out there play high bitrate content without stuttering or hiccups. From what I can tell, you can stream from either smb or via UPnP, the HD300 did not pick up on my NFS server or HTTP (myiHome).\n\nAudio/Video Playback:\n\nAs expected this is probably the area that most people care about. If a player cannot play back your content, then any other bells and whistles become moot. I have a variety of files I like to use when testing media players, and I am happy to report that the HD300 passed with near flying colors (I tested with the latest beta firmware). Here is a description of what I tested and the results (all results apply to both Standalone and Extender mode):\n\nmkv w/ chapters – chapters are supported BUT you have to bring up the options menu which is a little annoying (PASS)\n\nmkv w/ 480p internal IDX/SUB subtitles (PASS)\n\nmkv w/ 1080p internal IDX/SUB subtitles (FAIL) Also, trying to play this file will lock up the HD300 and force you to do a reboot\n\nmkv w/ internal PGS subtitles (PASS)\n\nHD Audio downmix to stereo (PASS and FAIL)*\n\nmkv w/ forced subtitles – the HD300 does not respect the forced subtitle flag (FAIL)\n\nmkv with DTS(MA) and/or TrueHD Audio Track – bitstreamed without issue (PASS)\n\n(m2)ts with DTS(MA) and/or TrueHD Audio Track – bitstreamed without issue (PASS)\n\nmkv w/ VC-1 encoded video – played without issue using latest beta firmware (PASS)\n\nBluRay ISO (main movie only) – played with forced subs, chapter support, and bitstreamed HD Audio (PASS)\n\nBluRay Folder (entire disc) – played main movie, the HD300 does not support BluRay menus (PASS)\n\nDVD ISO and/or Folder Structure – played with full menus (PASS)\n\n1080p quicktime (.mov) trailer – played without issue (PASS)\n\navi/mpeg clips – played without issue (PASS)\n\nmkv w/ FLAC – played w/ multi channel PCM (PASS)\n\nmkv w/ header compression – played without issue (PASS)\n\nAs expected, the HD300 handled nearly everything I threw at it, with 1080p IDX/SUB subtitles the only file causing a serious issue (requiring the unit to reboot). Chapter navigation was a little bit of an annoyance. On the remote there is not chapter skip button, just FF/RW buttons, so to skip chapters you have to bring up the Info menu and select either Previous or Next chapter. As mentioned by PluckyHD the remote can handle chapter skips using the channel up/down button. This is very odd but nonetheless gives the functionality. Overall, the HD300 did an excellent job with file playback. The only potential roadblock could be for users of TrueHD mkvs which you can read more about below.\n\n* The HD300 had no issues downmixing to stereo DTS(MA). However, for TrueHD there were mixed results. When a BluRay movie has a TrueHD track, this audio track also contains an embedded AC3 track. The HD300 grabs this AC3 track to downmix to stereo, so playing back a BluRay (either as a folder rip or as a standalone (m2)ts ) the HD300 has no problems downmixing to stereo. However. mkvs do not allow for the TrueHD + AC3 to be contained in one track, so you would only get TrueHD. In this case the HD300 is unable to decode the TrueHD track (they do not have a license to decode) so you are left with no sound if attempting to downmix to stereo. For mkv users the only option is to include the AC3 track as a secondary track. You would then just have to manually switch to the Ac3 track during playback. This is not ideal but the folks at SageTV have mentioned they are looking into possibly automating this (in the case where an mkv has a TrueHD track and the HD300 is set to downmix the HD300 would automatically switch to the AC3 track). A big kudos to SageTV to for the quick response in looking for a solution.\n\nOnline Content:\n\nThere is a fairly decent amount of online content available. Of course the first question that is always asked is “Where is Netflix?”. Well, unfortunately there is no Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Amazon, etc… I did test and confirmed that PlayOn did work with the HD300, however I think everyone is tired of going through a 3rd party hack and hopes for full integration. I am sure the folks at SageTV are aware of this, but unfortunately companies like Netflix seem to be very difficult in dealing with smaller companies.\n\nSelecting the Online Services icon from the Main Menu will bring up a variety of services you can choose from, most grouped by category.\n\nChoosing a category such as HD Videos will bring up another screen which will list out available online HD content.\n\nSelecting HD Nation (a favorite of mine) will bring up a list of all available videos for viewing. After some brief buffering when the video first loaded, I had no issues playing back a full episode.\n\nTo be honest I am not a big online content person, as I find a lot of the content somewhat random and picture quality to be hit or miss, so not having Netflix or Hulu is not an issue to me. However, these two services seem to be heavily requested, and if SageTV were able to integrate these services into the HD300 this would be huge. Only time will tell.\n\nStandalone Vs. Extender Mode:\n\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of this review, the focus was going to be on using the HD300 in standalone mode. However, I wanted to take a few minutes to discuss the extender mode. One of the features that sets the HD300 apart from just about every other player in the market is the ability to use it as an extender. To use in extender mode you are required to run SageTV Media Center ($79.95 or when bundled with the HD300 $199.95) on a PC or server. By doing this the HD300 can connect to SageTV Media Center and instead of having to use the stock HD300 UI you instead have full access to the SageTV 7 UI, functionality, plugins, etc… This is the same concept as what Microsoft does with the Xbox360 and Windows Media Center. In order to run Windows Media Center on the Xbox360 it must connect to a PC running Windows Media Center. So what exactly are the benefits of running in extender mode? Here are some that came to mind:\n\nAn HTPC experience without the HTPC\n\nAccess to the SageTV Plugin repository (it is a bit of a mess IMO currently but I expect it to improve over time). An example of a plugin would be the excellent Sage MyMovies plugin which I documented here. You can also read up about many of the other plugins over at Geektonic.\n\nIf you have TV Tuners installed on the PC running SageTV Media Center you can control those tuners on the HD300, including watching live TV and scheduling recordings\n\nIf you have multiple HD300s you can start a movie on one HD300 and resume from where you left off on another HD300\n\nIf you have a DVD/BluRay Rom drive installed on the same PC where SageTV Media Center is running you can actually use that drive on the HD300. You can only play back unencrypted discs so you must have AnyDVD or DVDFab Passkey running in the background. I was able to successfully play a BluRay disc installed on my desktop PC on the HD300 with full HD Audio bitstreaming.\n\nTrue Windows Home Server integration. This is an important feature for us Windows Home Server users.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nSo if you couldn’t tell so far, overall I was very impressed with the HD300. It addresses many of the issues that I had with the HD200, played nearly everything I threw at it, and came in a ridiculously small size. The size combined with the IR Receiver means you can put the HD300 virtually anywhere, and with consuming only 7-8W of energy (as confirmed by Andy at Missing Remote) it will have little impact on your electric bill.\n\nOf course the question that I will get asked, would I recommend the HD300? This is actually a tough one, so let me break it down into a few parts. First, if you are looking for full Windows Home Server integration then the HD300 is a no brainer. If you are looking to integrate a TV tuner farm setup with small/quiet clients, then the HD300 is a no brainer (as long as you understand that currently SageTV does not work with Cable Card tuners)."
