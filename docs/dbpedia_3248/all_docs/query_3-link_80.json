        "text": "Arrrg, National and Labour are arguing about first time home buyers, and itâs driving me nuts.\n\nIâm reading some good posts from NZ econ people, which frame it nicely in econ speak, but itâs just so simple in my mind.\n\nIf you want first time buyers to get cheap houses, all house must be cheaper, so that there are cheap houses for them to buy.\n\nI will now make up some numbers:\n\n60% of the population owns houses (group A)\n\n15% of the population wants to own houses but donât because they are too expensive (group B)\n\n25% of the population donât own houses because they understand the canât afford them (and are not bothered) or they want the flexibility of renting. (group C)\n\nSo with these made up numbers in mind, we have the two main political parties frothing at the mouth because group B canât buy houses, and its always been their dream.\n\nQueue sad story of dreams hereâ¦. I dream toâ¦ oh dreams of the group B people, anyway we all have dreams, work towards them and realise you canât have it all. Because I have lots of dreams, and so far Iâve not been to the moon!\n\nSo to me the âfirst home buyersâ argument is really group A needs to lose some of their capital wealth in their houses to help bring all house prices down, so group B can have cheap houses. How has the big drop in house prices worked for the USA so far???\n\nSo which party would be stupid to ask the majority of the country to lose money now and forever, so that another group can get a house. None, they donât talk about it in this frame of reference, but they are one and the same to me.\n\nHow would we go about destroying that value group A thinks they have: be that with tax (first time buyers grants, government houses for cheap, etc) or allowing faster building of houses, or destroying the markets desire for NZ property, you know act âNorth Korea likeâ until the world is scared of us. Ether way âThe Answerâ is going to be unpopular.\n\nNationalâs solutions seems to be a non-solution solution, but a political âresponseâ.\n\nWhat I donât understand is why did Labour start playing this debate/issue.\n\nThere are the core base in the Labour camp, who will vote Labour ether way? Are they trying to rev them up, and get them to mobilise the swing voters? Are they trying to win the hearts of the swing voters, the group B people might like the idea of cheaper houses, but as soon as they own a house they will want to increase in value, thus become group A, and not want this policy again. Or the group A people that âhave a heartâ but are too slow see what this would ârequire to fixâ or is Labour also not really caring about the issue at all, and just trying to make National demonstrate has âno heart for the poorâ\n\nI say this as swing voter, thatâs not found of Nationalâs sell it all policy, because how well did the Toll Rail Â sell/buy back program work out? So now thereâs no way I can vote for Labour with a stupid policy stance like this, so Iâm back to National, thank Labour.\n\nIt all drives me nuts, mix in the NSA spy electronic crap, and NZ rolling over for trade agreements, Labour of all people lowering the drinking age, to vote buying (n years ago) because 18 year olds are âadultsâ, yet also insisting we need more/tighter tobacco/drink/drug control because those aforementioned adults need to be told how to live (long live the nanny state).\n\nMean while the politicians embarrass themselves and our country with their anticâs in the âdebateâ chamber, and around the country. What a bunch of clowns.\n\nAnd there lies the rub, I donât trust them to do a mediocre job, Iâm not sure how to make them be less stupid, so do I shut-up take my lumps, or join them. Sighâ¦.\n\nThe D5100 had a stringÂ âA:\\\\LvRaw Â .rawâ that I notice soon after first decoding the firmware files. I could never fulling put together the how and why of what the code was doing (looking in Task 30 of the D5100 firmware or @0x1AC268 of v1.01 firmware)\n\nAfter the Magic Lantern guys announced RAW movies and it becoming a hot topic I doubled my efforts to work out how the code worked. But still it evaded me.\n\nThen I bricked my D5100 and I stop working on the project for a month as Iâd lost my mojo. Also my replacement D7000 was pretty much all a man could need. But that elusive RAW video mode the Magic Lantern guys have was a very shinny target.\n\nSo reading the D7000 firmware with more vigor I discovered why the D5100 didnât make sense, Nikon had removed the liveview raw saving code, because itâs present in the D7000, and with a simple tweak I got it working.\n\nSo for now itâs truly the raw buffer (the part thatâs put in the .NEF but with none of the EXIF data), and it takes a hack to turn on, and Iâve not nailed the FPS, nor do I have a clue how to speed it up, but itâs all very cool.\n\nForm the two test videoâs Iâve done, the first took 25 frames in 18 seconds so 1.33 fps, on an Extreme 45MB/s San Disk SD card. The second video with an Extreme Pro 95MB/s San Disk SD card, I got 15 frames in 10 seconds, so 1.5 fps. Not ground breaking stuff, but the code to do this was already present in the D7000 firmware. So making it âbetterâ will take a while.\n\nIâll post a couple of files in case anybody is keen to try decode them.Â https://simeonpilgrim.com/files/Liveview_silent.zip\n\nTurns out that after some data review, the files contents appear to be the left over ram from taking previous pictures and not the current raw buffer. sigh. Well at least we now how a button, that is wired up to run in live view and a complete understanding of the file handling process, albeit a slow process.\n\nAh, it only took ~15 years, but I have now completed the series. What started out as a racing set of books, then slowed into a crawl for book ~8, 9, 10, 11 and turned back into a racy Â adventure by book 12 and was a full on blood bath with plots getting sorted rather fast and furious in the final book 14.\n\nQuite pleased how it went. Glad some main characters died. Over all very pleased.\n\nI didnât get much else done in the last month, so now I am free to enjoy other things, and am currently having the âcompleter typeâ sense of done-ness about the whole thing.\n\nThanks Jo for getting me into the books and lending the early ones to me, and thanks Harvey for lending/giving the latter ones to me. Much appreciated to the both of you.\n\nFor the last couple of weeks Iâve filled up at the same petrol station, and then entered the details into Gas Cubby and the docket price is 2 cents different fromÂ that displayed on the ipodâ¦.\n\n2.119 x 27.94 = 59.20486, which should round to 55.20\n\nI could forgive 55.21, but really 50.22, thatâs magic rounding, or they are using more decimal places than shown.\n\nTo make the checking easy Iâll assume infinite precision and thus the rounding will trend towards .5 of the last digit. 2.1195 x 27.9405 = 59.2198898 thus 59.22, so it could be both figures are misrepresented or just the $/litre, as when you donât fudge the price and only the litre amount the total rounds to 59.21.\n\nOr maybe they Â just have bad programmers and the company is not evil.\n\nWhich reminds me of how my TelstraClear (now Vodaphone) bill never added up. If you telly the sub totals reported to 2 decimal places, the total was off 1 to 2 cents every bill. Scary was that two of three sections were fixed price, and the third was fractional. So how they did that I was never sure.\n\nSigh, I loaded my first altered firmware on my trusty D5100 on the 25th November 2011, and my last on 22nd May 2013.\n\nStrangely enough we are not sure what was wrong with the patch, weather the area we put the code in was not truly free space, Â or if the area we were putting data in was not spare, if the jump to the new code was wrong, was the return wrong, was there an error in the code, or did we take to long and a watchdog triggered.\n\n[Edit 7 July 2013] Hi Nikonrumor people, the problem with the patch was an incorrect sequence of assembly instructions used, and it was a development test patch. So âreleasedâ patches are much more âsaferâ but there is still a real albeit small risk.[Edit]\n\nItâs hard to know but the camera doesnât boot anymore. The led doesnât even flash when you put batteries in/out.\n\nSo now I get to buy myself a new camera, itâs a little frustrating, as the project had been getting donations, but we had not gotten enough for a D5100 body yet and my plan was to get one for one of the other developers, so we could speed up testing time, and spread the risk. The other guys have different models so are not directly applicable at this âbut how does it all workâ stage. And because I started the project we were focusing on the D5100 model as it was the most understood.\n\nIf my camera was damaged and I could claim insurance, I wouldnât get a replacement D5100, Iâd likely step up a model, not because Iâd out grown the D5100, itâs a fantastic camera, itâs just Iâm prepared to spend a little more to get more, compared to when I brought my first DSLR. But getting a D5100 makes the most sense as thatâs the model we know the most about from a team perspective.\n\nI rang the Nikon Service centre and it will cost 50% of the new camera price to replace the mainboard. And you can buy replacement off ebay for half that again, but Iâm not a hardware guy. They plan is to send the body to a team member and see if they can get the JTAG link working to force reprogram it.\n\nMichaela joked that I should dump Nikon and go with Canon, because of âdisgust with a camera thatâs so easy to breakâ. She took the news better than I expected.\n\nSo ignoring the Canon joke, Iâm torn between personal camera needs/wants, and project team needs, and Iâm wondering if thereâs any community opinion, and if the community is willing to help fund that opinion in anyway?\n\nIâve previously not directly asked for money for camera bodies, as I didnât want to ask before having something to show, and I felt we could stop at anytime without feeling a huge sense of dept to the community. So Iâm keen to understand what people think.\n\nBy the way, we have been able to partially dump the D7100 and itâs ARM based verse Fujitsu FR based and uses a different OS. So the newest cameraâs are a whole different kettle of fish, but should be easier to work with, as there is more ARM based disassembly tools.\n\nIâve been getting spam to my pageâs and pictures for years, but this last weekend I got 400+\n\nGrrr, time to fight back.\n\nTheÂ annoyingÂ thing is that both Media and Pages donât have the ability for the Admin (out of the box) to say âno commentsâ, which is what I do to all my posts once I they get enough spam, and I donât want to leave to open for active discussion.\n\nSo I found this support post with this code to stop Media comments:\n\nadd_filter( 'comments_open', 'no_media_comments', 10, 2 ); function no_media_comments( $open, $post_id ) { $post = get_post( $post_id ); // wordpress refers to images as attachments if ( 'attachment' == $post->post_type ) $open = false; return $open; }\n\nI then found this page in the Codex with the âpost->post_typeâ defined and added another clause to block posts to Pages also and ended up with this:\n\nfunction no_media_comments( $open, $post_id ) { $post = get_post( $post_id ); // wordpress refers to images as attachments if ( 'attachment' == $post->post_type ) $open = false; if ( 'page' == $post->post_type ) $open = false; return $open; } add_filter( 'comments_open', 'no_media_comments', 10, 2 );\n\nWhich I placed at the very bottom of my functions.php (Appearance -> Editor -> functions.php)"
