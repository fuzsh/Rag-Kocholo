Well, it was just announced that Google is purchasing SageTV (http://sagetv.com/index.html ) and they've closed down all hardware and software sales. I think a lot of people (me included) are looking for hardware extenders to support our servers.\n\nHow difficult is developing a channel for Roku? Do you think something like this is possible?\n\nI saw that Plex now has a Roku channel, which is what got me thinking of this as a solution for Sage.\n\nRoku 1 XDS connected via ethernet\n\nRoku LT via WIFI\n\nApple Airport Extreme"
