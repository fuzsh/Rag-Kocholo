This will ensure that all left over files from the older model are no longer on the system. Run the HCWCLEAR program from your WinTV-PVR-250/350 CD and choose 'Total removal' as well as putting a checkmark in the box to 'Search all INF files for conflicting hardware' and click ok. Once complete, proceed with the installation as normal.\n\nError Code 10: This device cannot start\n\nTry moving the WinTV card to a different PCI slot in the system. If there are any resource issues with the WinTV card and any other device in the system, this would reassign the resources for the WinTV.\n\nOpen the Control Panel - System - Advanced. In the Performance section click on the Settings button, then the Advanced tab. In the Memory Usage section located here, choose Programs instead of System Cache.\n\nMake sure that the latest drivers for your VGA card are installed as well.\n\nBlack screen issues\n\nThe main causes for black screen are \"Decoder Issues\", no sound card installed in the system, and video cards that do not support \"Overlay\".\n\nThe following information is ONLY a workaround for video cards that do not support Overlay.\n\nSymptoms of non-overlay support:\n\nBlack screens when channels have been scanned\n\nLockups after channel scan or adding a channel\n\nErrors when changing MPEG quality level\n\nCan only display video in MPEG1 setting\n\nYou can set the WinTV to run in Primary display mode to get the video in the WinTV2000. You must have the latest version of the Hauppauge Software decoders and version 1.6 or higher of the WinTV-PVR-250/350 drivers.\n\nOpen the Primary applet located in the Start - Programs - Hauppauge WinTV program group. Select Force Primary and close the Primary program out. Open WinTV and try adding a channel and see if the video and audio play. Also verify that you can change the MPEG quality settings in the Pref - Movies - MPEG settings.\n\nRemember, this is just a workaround; the PVR 250/350 is designed and meant to work in Overlay. You may need to upgrade the video card drivers or change your video.\n\nAlso make sure that the Hauppauge Software decoders have been installed. These will be listed as Intervideo Filter SDK for Hauppauge in the Add Remove Programs section of Control Panel. If they are not listed here, please reinstall from the SMD folder of the WinTV Installation CD.\n\nThe drivers for your Sound card should also be updated and installed properly.\n\nAlso, you can try recording a short MPEG1 VCD file and play it back to see if the decoder is working properly. If you can record and playback a VCD file, then the problem would indicate a Conflict with pre-installed decoders.\n\nDoes the WinTV-PVR-250/350 do MPEG decoding as well as encoding?\n\nThe WinTV PVR 250 has MPEG encoding hardware only. It will use software decoding for the playback and pause functions.\n\nThe WinTV PVR 350 has Hardware decoding only on the video output. Local playback (on the PC monitor) is still software decoding.\n\nRandom lockups with Dual CPU or Hyperthreaded systems\n\nAs a workaround, setting Affinity for the WinTV2k application to use only one CPU will sometimes work. To do this, while the WinTV application is open, Press CTRL+ALT+Delete on your keyboard to open the Windows Task Manager. In here click on the Processes tab and look for the WinTV2K.EXE listing under Image Name. Right click on it and choose Set Affinity. In here it will list the active CPUs. Uncheck the highest number CPU. If they are numbered CPU 0 and CPU 1, uncheck CPU 1. This will make CPU 0 the only one the WinTV will work on.\n\nMicrosoft is aware of these types of issues with capture devices. If you would like to read the Microsoft Knowledge base article concerning the hyper-threading fix you can click the following link. There should be a fix for this in Service Pack2:\n\nhttp://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;817589&Product=winxp\n\nDisabling Hyper Threading in the Bios should also allow the PVR250/350 to function properly. This should only be tried as a last resort.\n\nWinTV works fine until I restart my computer\n\nInitial installation was smooth, and finished without any problems. WinTV and all of its functions work fine until the system is rebooted. When windows comes up again, it recognizes the card as a new device and must be reinstalled in order to work again.\n\nUnder XP, a possible workaround would be to delete all the Prefetch files located in the \"C:\\Windows\\Prefetch\" This could also be caused by resource conflicts. Try moving the WinTV card to a different PCI slot. Windows will detect the card when you reboot and should reassign the resources for it.\n\nCan I record one show while watching another with the WinTV-PVR-250/350?\n\nNo, the WinTV PVR 250/350 will only be able to record the program that is being viewed using the supplied software. If you use SageTV with the PVR250/350 you can use 2 cards in the system which will then give you the ability to watch one channel while recording another. No, the WinTV PVR 250/350 will only be able to record the program that is being viewed.\n\nWhat is the difference between the WinTV-PVR-250 and 350 models?\n\nBoth models will have the same capture and TV functionality. The PVR 350 adds FM radio, as well as a video output(S-video/Composite video), so you can output captured MPEG videos to an external monitor of VCR.\n\nVideo out is only S-Video or Composite, there is no RF output.\n\nWhen Video Out is enabled, turning off the local playback will lower CPU usage considerably. To access that option, click and hold right mouse button then go down to video out and uncheck Local Playback. You can also turn off Video Out in the same menu selection.\n\nCan I view Closed Captioning with the WinTV-PVR-250/350?\n\nNot currently, however, this feature is planned for a future update.\n\nData Invalid error when installing the driver on Windows XP\n\nData Invalid error when installing the driver on Windows 2000.\n\nFailed to create TV window. hTV=0xd6a950 Err=1\n\nStop the Windows Media Center services from running to eliminate this issue. In order to stop the MCE services go to your task manager and to processes and end the following tasks if they are running: Ehrecvr , Ehsmas, Ehsched, and Ehtray.\n\n\"There is no common media type between these pins\" HCWSnapshot, Video Renderer\n\nThis error will occur if Overlay is not working properly on your system. Your VGA card MUST support Overlay in order for the WinTV-PVR-250/350 to work. Make sure your graphics card supports Overlay. Also make sure that there are no other programs running that require overla, ie; Windows Media Player. These programs will take over the Overlay surface and prevent the WinTV PVR 250/350 from working.\n\nThis error may also come up if the Software Decoders have not been installed. Reinstall the software codecs.\n\nAlso, be sure that the VGA cards hardware acceleration settings are on Full. (control panel/display/settings/advanced).\n\n\"WinTV Initialization Error.hTV=10\" when trying to open the WinTV program\n\nThis error will only come up if the VFW drivers have been installed on the system. For example, if you had a different model WinTV installed that requires VFW drivers and installed the PVR 250/350 software over it, you may get this error. You may also get this error if you have downloaded and installed the PVR PCI updated drivers mistakenly.\n\nThe WinTV PVR 250/350 DOES NOT USE VFW drivers. To correct this error, run the PVR48xxx.exe file from the PVR folder on the WinTV-PVR-250/350 installation CD.\n\nAlso, if this error is seen during the driver installation procedure, try reseating or moving the WinTV board into another PCI slot(s), making sure that it is firmly in place.\n\nError in MSVCRT.DLL when trying to open the WinTV program\n\nIf you get an error in MSVCRT.DLL please try updating to the latest version of the software.\n\nDVD MovieFactory: \"Error: cannot read from file\" when creating VCD\n\nULead DVD MovieFactory application update\n\nThe latest updates to MovieFactory can be found at: www.ulead.com/tech/dmf/dmf_ftp.htm\n\nA fix for a hang when burning VCD's is now available.\n\nDVD MovieFactory: \"Failed to initialize capture driver\"\n\nDVD MovieFactory is provided as an editing and authoring program only. It cannot capture the video directly. You must capture the MPEG video files using the WinTV2000 application and then import them into DVD MovieFactory to edit them.\n\nThird party capture applications not supported\n\nThe WinTV-PVR-250/350 records directly to MPEG using onboard Hardware encoders. Most third party capture applications are looking to attach to a card or driver that supports uncompressed video recordings. Like AVI files. These programs cannot capture video directly using the PVR-250/350.\n\nHibernate other Power Management options not supported\n\nWhen the WinTV is running, any Power Management routines configured on the computer will not run. Including Hibernate.\n\nCan I edit the captured Videos created with the WinTV-PVR-250/350?\n\nYes, you can edit the MPEG files.\n\nProdinfo: get information on your Hauppauge TV tuner\n\nProdinfo.exe is a program you can run which will extract information about the WinTV product you have installed such as model and serial number, MAC address, revision, and features which can be used to identify the exact model of your product. The driver for the device must be installed in order to run Prodinfo.exe\n\nHCWClear\n\nHCWCLEAR.exe is a program you run to remove all driver and files that were installed with the installation of the WinTV program."
