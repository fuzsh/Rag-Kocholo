        "text": "It has been nearly a month since the SageTV HD300 started shipping. Prior to the HD300 shipping I put together a brief writeup on the direction I hoped SageTV was heading towards, so I was anxious to give the HD300 a test run to see if it met my expectations. For this review I am going to spend most of the time focusing on the HD300 in standalone mode as in extender mode more of the focus would be on the SageTV 7 Media Center software and not the HD300. Enough talking, let‚Äôs get down and dirty.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nPrice: USD 149.95\n\nProcessor: Sigma SMP8654 SOC\n\nFile formats supported: AVI, ASF, MKV, MOV, MP4, Quicktime, MPEG-1, MPEG-2 PS, MPEG-2 TS, M2TS, BDMV Folder (BluRay), BluRay ISO, DVD ISO, DVD VIDEO_TS, VOB, M4A, MP3, FLAC, OGG, FLV, WAV, WMA\n\nVideo formats supported: MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, XVID, H.264 up to 1080p, WMV9/VC-1 up to 1080p, MJPEG, FlashVideo\n\nAudio formats supported: MP2, MP3, AAC, AAC-HE, ALAC, WMA, WMAPro, PCM, Vorbis (stereo only), FLAC, DolbyDigital/DolbyDigital+/DolbyTrueHD* (stereo down-mix or pass-through), DTS/DTS-HD/DTS-MA (stereo down-mix or pass-through)\n\n*DolbyTrueHD down-mix requires the DolbyDigital core track to be present\n\nCC/Subtitle formats supported: EIA-608(NTSC/ATSC/QAM Closed Captioning), DVB, SRT, SSA/ASS, VobSub (sub/idx, mkv), Nero MP4 VOB Subtitles, MP4 Text, SAMI, .sub (Subviewer/MicroDVD), DVD, BDMV, M2TS, PGS, multiple languages supported in all formats\n\nPlaylist formats supported: M3U, WPL, ASX, WAX, WVX\n\nMedia sources supported: Online Video, external USB Mass Storage Devices (FAT, NTFS, EXT2/3, HFS format), NAS or Mac/PC over SMB/CIFS, UPnP, SageTV Media Center\n\nKeyboard support: Wired or Wireless USB keyboards (US keyboard layout)\n\nWireless Network support: 802.11 b/g/n networks; USB wireless network adapters\n\nVideo Outputs: 1 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite (Component & Composite via breakout cable)\n\nAudio Outputs: Optical S/PDIF, HDMI, Left/Right analog audio output (analog audio output via breakout cable)\n\nMulti-Channel Audio Output: Multi-channel PCM audio output is supported over HDMI with up to 7.1 channels for PCM and FLAC audio formats; and up to 5.1 channels for WMAPro and AAC audio formats. Pass-through (bitstream) is supported for DolbyDigital, DolbyDigital+, DolbyTrueHD, DTS and DTS-HD/MA formats.\n\nRemote Control: Includes infrared remote control with universal remote functionality (3 buttons can be programmed using infrared, compatible with most remote controls).\n\nExternal IR Receiver: Optional external IR receiver can be purchased for mounting the HD Theater 300 behind a TV or in another room.\n\nMaximum Number of SageTV HD Theaters when used as a media extender: Limited only by your home network bandwidth, each HD video stream may use 20 Mbps or more of home network bandwidth.\n\nWOL (Wake-on-LAN) support: The device is capable of sending WOL packets to wakeup a SageTV server in standby mode if that server supports WOL functionality.\n\nDimensions: 5 1/16‚Ä≥ W x 1 1/2‚Ä≥ H x 4‚Ä≥ D\n\nTV Set Requirements:\n\nHDMI, Component or Composite input (NTSC or PAL)\n\nLeft and right audio input jacks, optical or HDMI audio input\n\nNetwork Requirements:\n\nOne 10/100 RJ-45 port on a Router, Hub or Switch network (supports DHCP and static IP addresses)\n\nor\n\nDirect connect from SageTV HD Media Extender to PC running DHCP server via cross over LAN cable (not supplied)\n\nHardware:\n\nThe HD300 comes packaged in a neat and compact white box. Nothing flashy, just some basic advertising.\n\nIncluded with the HD300 ‚Äì\n\nSageTV HD Theater digital media receiver\n\nRemote control with batteries\n\nBreakout cable for composite video, component video and analog audio\n\nHDMI cable\n\n1.5 meter Ethernet cable\n\nPower adapter\n\nUser manual\n\nThe front of the HD300 is fairly basic. To the left are the typical decals. The right is the power LED, IR LED, and IR input for use with an IR extender.\n\nThe back of the HD300 includes 2 USB 2.0 ports, Ethernet 10/100 port, HDMI, Optical, and a combined Video Port (using the provided breakout cable will give you Composite or Component connections).\n\nThere is no power brick which is nice. However, I have to admit that I did not like the power plug. Based on the direction of the plugs the power adapter runs horizontally covering up nearby power outlets on my power conditioner (I ended up having to move plugs around to get this to fit). I would have preferred to have the plug designed so that the adapter was vertical when plugged in.\n\nOne thing you may have noticed is that the HD300 looks pretty small. It is small enough for me to easily palm with my hands. To really get a sense of how truly small it is, I decided to compare the HD300 with a Raisin muffin lying around.\n\nI also called on my body double (I only use him for stunts and standing in line at the pharmacy) to model the HD300. The HD300 could be the first HD media player that could be worn around in public!\n\nOne of the benefits of the size is that there are a lot of possibilities on where to store the HD300. I decided to purchase some Velcro tape at the local Home Depot and mount the HD300 behind an LCD TV. Two strips of Velcro tape along the bottom of the HD300 was all that was needed. Big thanks to PluckyHD for the Velcro tape suggestions and the interesting Home Depot commentary üòâ\n\nThe HD300 mounted without issue to the back of the LCD TV, keeping everything hidden.\n\nSince mounting the TV means I would lose line of site to operate the HD300 I simply plugged in the optional IR extender and mounted it to the upper corner of the TV.\n\nOverall, I am extremely impressed with the size of the HD300, and even with the small size I felt I was dealing with a sturdy piece of equipment. I do admit that there is a geeky part of me that likes to have an ‚ÄúA/V looking‚Äù device, but in reality my devices are usually hidden anyhow. The HD300 is fanless which is a big plus (i.e. silent). Because of this the aluminum body does appear to get used as a heatsink, and although not scorching hot it did get very warm to the touch when in use.\n\nRead the rest of this entry ¬ª\n\nWhen it comes to using Windows Media Center there are two great plugins to consider, MyMovies and Media Browser. As always the question which I get asked often is which one to use. The first question I always ask which helps narrow things down quickly is whether the user wants TV episode support. Since MyMovies does not currently support TV episodes it is a quick elimination is this is something the user wants. Well, I just got a newsletter from Brian Binnerup at MyMovies and it appears that TV show support should be coming. Here is what Brian had to say:\n\nTV Series Support\n\nThe support for TV Series in My Movies for Windows Media Center have been a request from many over the years, and this is now something we are working actively on. It was planned that we would be able to release this late this summer, but due to different reasons, it will come later instead.\n\nIt is important to us that once we add this, we do it the right way with the right functionality, and not just focused for one country or region.\n\nTo be sure not to have a deadline we cannot hold, we will not put a date on when you will see this support available, and we are also yet to decide if we will include it fully at once, or in steps.\n\nWe can ensure you though that once we are releasing it, it will be worth the wait.\n\nSome other interesting tidbits from the newsletter:\n\nMy Movies for iPad\n\nThe one question we have had the most after releasing My Movies for iPhone Pro is if there will be a My Movies for iPad, both because of the options the iPad gives, but also because My Movies for iPhone does not operate on the iPad due to the iOS 4 usage.\n\nThere indeed will be a My Movies for iPad, which we plan releasing during October. We have created a sneak peak part of our website, which you can see here. On this site, many questions on the iPad release is answered. We will be using our Facebook site to keep you updated on the progress towards the release.\n\nMobile Device Remote Controls\n\nThere have been a lot of requests to add remote control support to both My Movies for iPhone and to the upcoming My Movies for iPad.\n\nDespite remote control functionality is not within the original scope of these programs, we have had so many requests for it that we cannot just ignore it ‚Äì this means that we after the initial release of My Movies for iPad will be working on adding remote control functionality to the software.\n\nThis will be done in two steps; we will start adding the option of starting playback of a title from the iPhone or iPad software, and perhaps later from the Android software as well ‚Äì this will allow you to browse through your titles and request playback for the one you choose on the mobile device ‚Äì if there are multiple playback options such as multiple discs on the requested title, you will be asked to choose between the options on the device.\n\nThe second step will be a remote control page in the software, giving you the functionalities that are included with a standard Windows Media Center remote control, which means navigation and transport controls.\n\nIt is for now not planned to add browsing of music or similar functionality.\n\nAfter what has seemed to be quite some time (over a year to be exact), the MPC HC team has finally released the next MPC HC Official Build (1.4.2499). You can download the official build here.

For some mysterious reason this weekend the printer no longer shows up on any of my PCs. This printer has been hit or miss for me, I will not be a happy camper if I find out is it broken in less then a year with minimal use‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äì Just received the Xtreamer Pro to replace my troubled Xtreamer Sidewinder. It is much smaller then I expected. Look for my review in the coming weeks.\n\n‚Äì I actually got up before work and went for a walk to get some morning cardio in. I then proceeded to eat a slice of chocolate cake for breakfast!\n\n‚Äì Took the wife to see Avatar in IMAX this weekend. She had seen it already, but only on BluRay. Her exact words once the movie was over, ‚ÄúThat was awesome.‚Äù\n\n‚Äì I was able to catch two movies this week. Clash Of The Titans was entertaining. It is just one of those movies where you have to keep your expectations in check. Percy Jackson and the Olympians, I have mixed feelings. When it first started I thought it had promise, but as the storyline progressed I found it just became cheesy and too ‚Äúteenie‚Äù. I have never read the books but from reading reviews the movie was a far departure from the books. My wife‚Äôs family is visiting until next weekend so I am going to try and squeeze in as many movies as possible until them while I have more hands on board to watch the kids.\n\n‚Äì At some point I want to get a new TV for my bedroom. There are a lot of deals for the 3D TV / 3D BluRay player / 3D glasses. I am not sure if it is worth it?\n\nAs usual I also enjoy testing out various software application, always looking for the latest and greatest. I just recently came across a tool called BluRip, which takes your Blu Rays (must be unencrypted) and throws into an mkv. What is different about this program versus MakeMKV, Ripbot264, or other is that with BluRip you can encode, rip as lossless, or do a combination. One feature in particular that I like is that you can keep the native PGS subtitles as well as create a secondary AC3 audio track. This is the only program I have come across that can do both of these with having to involve multiple programs (MakeMKV can do this to an extent if the HD Audio track is TrueHD). Another benefit, you can set to disable header compression (read more about it here) once and not have to worry about it again. BluRip is definitely a little intimidating at first, but I think it is designed for both the novice and power user. I spent some time documenting how to use BluRip, so if interested you can see my guide here:\n\nBluRip Guide\n\nOn a side note, you may be asking how I determine what I post here versus MediaSmartServer. Basically I have found blogspot (which this Blog runs on) to be absolutely horrible when it comes to managing guides, especially inserting pictures and formatting. With MediaSmartServer we use WordPress which I find much more flexible and powerful, so I save all the ‚Äúbeefy‚Äù guides/writeups for that site.\n\nI have been running the 2.4 RC3 beta firmware for the Xtreamer and unfortunately have not had much success with it (unable to bitstream HD Audio, PQ issues, etc‚Ä¶). Looks like the firmware has just moved from beta status to official, so I am hoping this will fix the issues I encountered. I should hopefully know for sure later tonight when I get home from work.\n\nVer 2.4 New Features\n\n(1) Subtitle Browser ‚Äì You will be able to find this new option on the subtitle popup screen. It will allow you to select an external subtitle file on any location on your HDD.
