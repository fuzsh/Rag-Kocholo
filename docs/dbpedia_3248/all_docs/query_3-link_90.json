Your DirectTV receiver needs to be connected to your network in order for this to work. Place \"DirecTV_SHEF.dll\" in your \"MediaPortal TV Server\\Plugins\" directory, and be sure to restart the TVService. Source is included.\n\nDownload\n\nbornslippy\n\nPortal Pro\n\nDecember 16, 2008\n\n78\n\n4\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nMay 19, 2011\n\n#2\n\nThank you for creating this. I am making a small website to put on my netbook to control my dtv boxes. now I will just see what I will do with this. Any suggestions? Because I have a pull down menu that allows me to get to each box-ip didn't know if you knew of any short cuts.\n\nmarirs\n\nPortal Member\n\nApril 29, 2011\n\n17\n\n3\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nMay 19, 2011\n\nThread starter\n\n#3\n\nThere was a website that showed you all the listings and allowed you to tune to channels that would probably work great. Unfortunately, I can't find the address again. I found it through dbstalk.org, though.\n\nDavid Abineri\n\nPortal Pro\n\nJuly 19, 2011\n\n152\n\n4\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nJuly 20, 2011\n\n#4\n\nDoes this plug-in work for all the different Directv receivers?\n\nThanks, Dave\n\nmarirs\n\nPortal Member\n\nApril 29, 2011\n\n17\n\n3\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nJuly 20, 2011\n\nThread starter\n\n#5\n\nI think it should work with all the receivers that have an ethernet port (not 100% sure though).\n\nbornslippy\n\nPortal Pro\n\nDecember 16, 2008\n\n78\n\n4\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nJuly 21, 2011\n\n#6\n\nIf i am correct its only the H20/hdvr & up it works with. The older boxes dont have the SHEF commands. Easiest way to try is assign the box an ip then do ip/info/8080 & see if you get a screen that has more commands\n\nDavid Abineri\n\nPortal Pro\n\nJuly 19, 2011\n\n152\n\n4\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nJuly 21, 2011\n\n#7\n\nIn a slightly different direction, can someone recommend a PC tuner board that will work with MP and the current Directv set top boxes (HD) that have outputs of hdmi and component video? Thanks for any advice on this issue.\n\nDave\n\najp8164\n\nPortal Pro\n\nJanuary 9, 2008\n\n575\n\n1,166\n\nAtlanta, GA\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nAugust 14, 2011\n\n#8\n\nHi -\n\nGreat plugin! I've been using the blaster plugin from IRSS to do this for the past year and wanted to create this same plugin to get rid of IRSS once and for all ;-) Less software always makes a better system!\n\nI have looked at the implementation and made a few changes to attempt to have the DirecTV receiver turned off when time shifting stops. I also made added some message boxes to respond to the Test button on the plugin setup page.\n\nThe plugin is not receiving the message to stop shifting so I'm not sure if the message is being sent or what's going on. I don't have a lot of time atm to debug it; perhaps marirs, you could take a look? I've attached updated zip with source and binary (v 1.0.1.0).\n\nThanks again!\n\nAttachments\n\nDirecTV_SHEF.zip\n\nrenfrja\n\nNew Member\n\nMarch 4, 2010\n\n4\n\n1\n\nHome Country\n\nUnited States of America\n\nAugust 28, 2011\n\n#9\n\nHi,\n\nI'm another possible SageTV convert.\n\nI've been tinkering with MP for the last couple days and have a question regarding this plugin.\n\nI currently have two DirecTV STBs. I am able to control both these boxes via my network with SageTV.\n\nThis plugin looks to be close to what I'm currently using - but, does this have the capability to control multiple STBs?\n\nNot really wanting to go back to IR blasters...\n\nThanks,\n\nChris"
