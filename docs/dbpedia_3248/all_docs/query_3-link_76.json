It also extracts the original broadcast date/time from the file metadata.\n\n2023-10-09T03:24:17 MCEBuddy.MetaData.VideoMetaData → Video Tags extracted from file/name metadata →\n\nTitle: First Ladies of Hip-Hop\n\nSubTitle:\n\nDescription: The story of how women in hip-hop fought for their voices to be heard.\n\nNetwork:\n\nNetwork Affiliate:\n\nParental Rating:\n\nMedia Credits: BBC TV;BBC Two;\n\nGenres: Music\n\nSeason: 1\n\nEpisode: 2\n\nBanner:\n\nBanner URL:\n\nIMDB Id:\n\nMovieDB Id:\n\nTVDB Id:\n\nIs Movie: False\n\nIs Sports: False\n\nOriginalBroadcastDateTime: 2023-10-07T14:35:00\n\nRecordedDateTime: 1900-01-01T00:00:00\n\nSeriesPremiereDate: 2023-05-05T00:00:00\n\nCopyProtected: False\n\nSageTV FileID:\n\nSageTV MediaFileID:\n\nThen it goes to TVDB and looks up the information looking for a match and it tries to match the information by the Original broadcast date and you’ve checked the option to Prioritize matching by Air date in the metadata corrections page of Conversion task settings.\n\nTVDB return S1/E1 for this episode when matching by First aired date; and you’ve checked the option to Overwrite the metadata from TVDB in your MCEBuddy metadata correction settings, so it takes the wrong information provided by TVDB.\n\nINFORMATION> 2023-10-09T03:24:17 MCEBuddy.MetaData.VideoMetaData → Downloading Series details\n\n2023-10-09T03:24:17 MCEBuddy.MetaData.VideoMetaData → Overwrite title from internet → TVDB\n\nINFORMATION> 2023-10-09T03:24:17 MCEBuddy.MetaData.VideoMetaData → Recording Type Show\n\nINFORMATION> 2023-10-09T03:24:17 MCEBuddy.MetaData.VideoMetaData → Checking TheTVDB\n\n→ Looking for Premiere Year information in text\n\n→ Looking for Premiere Year information in text\n\n→ Looking for Premiere Year information in text\n\n→ Found series match on TVDB by Original Broadcast Date.

I suspect if you turn off this forcing it may work depending on what TVDB returns or change MCEBuddy’s metadata correction settings to not match up Original broadcast date.\n\nThanks for your reply. I looked at the metadata from all the three original files and see that the metadata wasn’t removed/stripped when I used Handbrake to peform the transcode.\n\nI will uncheck “Prioritize Air Date Matching” - since that really can be a nuisance…\n\nHowever, unless a specific series isn’t in TVDB, I have it overwritten the metadata from Internet - TVDB because the series name can change slightly between services.\n\nOne may include an apostrophe, the series premiere date could be different, etc. and then my Television Folder becomes a mess and difficult to manage.\n\nThanks for checking out the logs and I’ll change and save my Handbrake profiles to not pass through metadata. ** that said, shouldn’t “Overwrite metadata from filename” ignore ALL metadata???\n\nBTW (When I look at the metadata using Windows File Properties, each file clearly states Episode 1, 2 or 3…"
