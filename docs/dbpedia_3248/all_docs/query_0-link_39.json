        "text": "2011 International CES, Booth C9542: Hauppauge Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAUP), the world's leading developer and manufacturer of TV tuner products for personal computers, today launched its new Colossus internal PCI Express board capable of recording component video and unencrypted HDMI video at up to 1080i from sources such as the Xbox360 and digital SLR cameras.\n\nThe latest addition to Hauppauge's line of high definition video recorders, Colossus is similar to the company's HD PVR external USB-based H.264 recorder, but offers expanded capability to include HD video recording from the HDMI port on the Xbox360 game console. When connected to an Xbox360, an HDMI cable can be used to record game play at video resolutions up to 1080i. When connected to a Playstation3, game play is recorded using component video at 1080i resolution.\n\nColossus allows users to make high definition video recordings of their highest-score games and even game tutorials, directly from the game console. Users can record game play in HD and then upload the recording to YouTube or other popular game recording websites. Colossus features pass-through support for component video and digital audio, enabling users to monitor game play on an HD TV set while recording.\n\nWhen connected to a cable TV or satellite set top box, Colossus users can record TV programs in HD. Colossus includes an IR blaster and the latest WinTV v7 application so that users can schedule a recording and have the Colossus ?blast? channel commands to the set top box at the appropriate time.\n\nWith Colossus connected to a set top box, a user can record a TV show or a complete TV series in high definition to their PCs hard disk, make HD libraries of favourite TV programs and then playback to the PC screen or burn the recording onto a disk in a high definition Blu-ray? format.\n\nColossus is supplied with two applications: the Hauppauge WinTV v7 application for scheduled recording of TV programs from cable TV and satellite set top boxes, and Arcsoft's ShowBiz, which allows users to record from a game console, trim the beginning and end of video recordings and immediately upload the recordings to YouTube. ShowBiz makes recording video game play and uploading to YouTube with Colossus easy.\n\nSageTV, a software company based in Inglewood, California, has announced support for Colossus in their Windows-based digital video application, SageTV 7.x. SageTV is a popular application providing complete DVR capability on a PC.\n\nPricing, availability and press pictures\n\nColossus will have a MSRP of $159 and will be available late January 2011.\n\nPictures of Colossus can be found here:\n\nhttp://www.hauppauge.com/site/press/presspictures/colossus_board-cables.png\n\nhttp://www.hauppauge.com/site/press/press_pictures_hdpvr.html#press_colossus\n\nAbout Hauppauge\n\nHauppauge Digital, Inc.
