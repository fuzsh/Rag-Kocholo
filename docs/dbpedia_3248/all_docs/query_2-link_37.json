        "text": "I have always had a love/hate relationship with SageTV. On one hand I think it has the most potential out of all the Media Center front ends. This includes true Windows Home Server integration and a very robust client/extender relationship. When I say Windows Home Server integration what I am talking about is the ability to use Windows Home Server as the central point for all SageTV clients/extenders (thus only needing to have your Windows Home Server + Client/Extender in use turned on). With Windows Media Center this is not the case. To use Windows Media Center on an extender such as the Xbox 360 you actually have to have a PC running Windows Media Center on as well. What this means is that you now have 3 machines turned on at the same time (Windows Home Server, PC running Windows Media Center, and the Xbox 360), which in Windows Home Server land is a big no no. SageTV’s Windows Home Server integration comes along with other benefits such as the ability to use Windows Home Server as a TV Tuner farm, the ability to start a movie on one SageTV client/extender and resume on another, the ability to play a DVD/Blu Ray disc inserted in your Windows Home Server machine on any client/extender, as well as many other features. The SageTv HD 200 Media Player is small, quiet, and energy efficient, which makes it the perfect media extender, especially when looking to have multiple media extenders throughout your house.\n\nYou may be asking with this and many other benefits why is it that I don’t use SageTV? Well, some of the main reasons are/were a terribly outdated UI (which has been mostly resolved with SageTV 7 although still in beta) and what I felt was a process to install plugins/enhancements that required too many steps and was too prone to user error (which has been mostly resolved with the new Plug In feature with SageTV 7). With regards to the HD200 there were two major flaws (in my opinion) that made it unusable in my house. The first is the inability to bitstream HD Audio (DTS-MA and TrueHD) which without this feature means that the HD200 had no chance of replacing my HTPCs in my family room and bedroom. The second issue was the HD200′s inability to downmix to stereo HD Audio. Most if not all TVs cannot decode HD Audio. Since the HD200 cannot downmix the HD Audio to stereo for the TV to process what happens is that when the HD200 is connected directly to a TV you are left getting no sound when you play back a file with HD Audio. The only solution was to include a secondary AC3 audio track to switch to, but this is not ideal, especially since I had tried to set my Mom up with the HD200 and explaining to her that if she gets no sound she needs to switch audio tracks is like explaining physics to Mike Tyson! The downmixing issue is particularly troublesome because I could see purchasing multiple HD200s to place throughout the house, but requiring a Receiver at every location just to get HD Audio playback is quite excessive.\n\nSo what is the purpose of this post? Well, with SageTV 7 being released and hopefully an HD300 is the works, I thought this would be a good time to come up with a wish list of what myself and the readers thought SageTV needs to do to really make it the Media Center/Extender to own. I spend a lot of time on AVSForum and there seems to be common themes amongst the members, so here are the things I have in mind and from what I have read:\n\nSageTV Media Player/Extender (HD300?) Hardware:\n\nHD Audio bitstreaming from standalone mkv/m2ts and Blu Ray folder structures (this would be both a hardware and software feature)\n\nHD Audio downmix to stereo (this would be both a hardware and software feature)\n\nStick with IR Remote as using an RF remote is not optimal for the many users who use a Universal remote\n\nNot critical but the ability to add an IR Extender so you can easily hide the HD300 but still operate with the remote\n\nNetflix integration (right now you can get this through a 3rd party software like PlayOn, but native integration would be ideal). I guess this could be hardware or software related, but from what I have read Netflix requires you to have certain hardware implementations to even be considered\n\nKeep same fanless case as the HD200 (see below screenshots of HD200). I don’t need anything fancy, I just want something that is quiet and feels solid. Maybe add an eSATA port on the back and remove the S-Video port?\n\nUpgrade to HDMI 1.3a (HDMI 1.4 would be optimal but not sure how cost effective currently)\n\nPossibly create two players, a base HD300 and a premium HD300 that includes a Blu Ray player (definitely not critical but a SageTV Blu Ray player with Netflix integration would really shake things up)\n\nSageTV Media Player/Extender (HD300?) Software – Standalone Mode:\n\nVideos (i.e. Movies) – multiple views with support for fanart/metadata. What I am thinking is that the standalone UI should have a few views (Wall, List, and Coverflow) and be able to read metadata. To get a sense of what the stock UI looks like for videos see two bullet points below for the Stock Music UI as it is essentially the same.\n\nAlternate UI - Wall View(Based on Rapier Skin)\n\nAlternate UI – Wall View I (Based on Confluence Skin)\n\nAlternate UI – List View (Based on Confluence Skin)\n\nAlternate UI – Coverflow View (Based on MediaStream Redux Skin)\n\nVideos (i.e. Archived TV Shows) – I am talking about individual episodes similar to what I documented here. The current HD200 does not break out but instead groups it along with all other videos in the Videos section. Same concept as movies, the UI should have a few views (maybe List and Banner) and be able to read fanart/metadata\n\nAlternate UI – Banner View (Based on Rapier Skin)\n\nAlternate UI – List View (Based on MediaStream Redux Skin)\n\nMusic – same as videos with support for multiple views (Wall and List).\n\nCurrent Music UI\n\nAlternate UI – Wall View (Based On Media Browser Music Plugin)\n\nMain Menu – Redesign UI to look more like the stock SageTV 7 UI or Other.\n\nCurrent Main Menu UI\n\nSageTV 7 Main Menu UI\n\nPossible Alternate And Sharper Main Menu UI (Based on Aeon). I prefer a horizontal menu versus vertical\n\nSupport for Blu Ray Menus (this could be a feature only for the “premium” HD300, as Blu Ray Menus require a licensing fee which means the cost of the player will increase)\n\nSupport for PGS and Hi Resolution (i.e. 1080p) IDX/SUB subtitles in mkvs (I believe PGS support has just been added to the HD200)\n\nHopefully new hardware would mean much faster navigation\n\nNetflix integration and continue to work on bringing premium Online content\n\nNow keep in mind that there may be hardware limitations of an HD300 that would prevent a more dynamic UI, but I thought it worth throwing some ideas out there of different views. I believe that most people who purchase a Media Player want an HTPC experience without the HTPC, which the stock UI on the HD200 does not deliver. Also, some may say that an easy way to get a more dynamic UI is to use the SageTV HD Media Player in extender mode, but two potential issues with that is it would require the purchase of SageTV Media Center Software which some people are not going to want to spend the money for (a one-time cost of $79.99) and some people are simply going to want to attach USB/external drives to the HD Player without running SageTV software.\n\nSageTV 7/HD300 (in Extender Mode):\n\nImplementation of an Archived TV Show View. With SageTV 6 there were add ins such as TV Explorer, but currently there is nothing for SageTV 7, which is one reason why I cannot use it in my house.\n\nDevelopment of the XBMC skin porting feature. This would be huge as I don’t know how many times I see requests on AVSForum from members who are looking for a media player that has an XBMC interface\n\nSupport for Blu Ray Menus (possibly not critical as this would increase the cost of the software due to licensing costs)\n\nSupport for PGS and Hi Resolution IDX/SUB subtitles in mkvs\n\nHopefully new hardware would mean much faster navigation\n\nFix bitstreaming issue with SageTV internal mkv splitter (this is purely a SageTV 7 + W7 HTPC issue, I have already submitted this as a bug)\n\nDevelopment/public release of Media Manager/UI plugins such as SMM, Ortus, and Phoenix\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nNow is the chance to open it up to all the readers. Assuming that an HD300 is in the works (this is just pure speculation on my part based on the fact that SageTV 7 was just released and the HD200 is in desperate need of a refresh), what do you want to see happen? What do you consider your ideal media player/extender and what does SageTV need to do to grab your attention and introduce a truly “next gen” media player? Who knows, maybe the folks at SageTV will be listening!!!"
