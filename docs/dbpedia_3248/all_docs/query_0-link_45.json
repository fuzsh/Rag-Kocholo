        "text": "Chad Taylor has elaborated on his comments on Chris Shinn from the recent Rolling Stone magazine article.\n\nChad's Facebook message is posted below:\n\nChad Taylor\n\n1 February ·\n\nThe entire experience of singing and playing the old songs was confusing for all of us (band and fans). Chris no more wanted to stand in Eds shoes, than Ed would have wanted to stand in his. When we began writing songs there were no constraints or pressures but as the demos started being created, Chris was suddenly faced with inside and outside pressure to make it a LIVE album. This was easy for PD, CG and me but even Jerry Harrison warned that the walls would/could close in on Chris. We broke this up by doing the Summerland Tour to get in touch with what it felt like to be a band in front of an audience. On this particular night, we were performing in a large amphitheater, the largest of the entire tour. The band were hitting our marks and finding our footing as a quartet, and the energy of the crowd was peaking just about the time we hit Lightning Crashes. These are the special moments where the audience and band merge; and hopefully where the spirit of a songs origination can return; where the crowd sings so loud we can melt into one. As I looked to my left to find my grounding, I saw Chris with his microphone extended to the crowd and my brain was shell shocked, who is that? Whats happening?\n\nThis a real and honest snapshot of what goes on during a performance for me, and what I experienced during many of the shows I performed with Chris. It doesnt mean that hes not a good person, or a great performer, and that Im not grateful for his partnership. My thoughts are not all pretty and cleaned up, if anything its one big mess. For thirty-years of my life that figure on our stage was Ed, and from the view of my lens it was so surreal and odd to witness someone else in this position.\n\nI doubt any interview would allow for that entire story or sentiment, but I was asked a direct question and shared a small piece of my experience, raw, unfiltered and incomplete. My comment certainly wasnt meant to detract from the spirit of our collaboration, but I remain wholly happy that Ed is back in his rightful place, and that Chris no longer has to deal with the distractions of being the replacement guy. Im sure I/we fucked this up along the way but there was no easy way to get to where we are today and really thats all I care about. Yes, egos were bruised, but the music should only benefit from our journey. Chris will find his footing, and the original line-up of the band will produce some inspired tunes and shows.\n\nIn spirit - CT\n\nSource: https://www.facebook.com/officialchadtaylor/posts/1247169198652174\n\n[credit: AManHasNoName]\n\n• posted by dangum on february 2, 2017"
