        "text": "There are lots of ways to get content off a PC and onto your living room television, but none are quite as easy to use as I'd like. Unfortunately, the release of SageTV's new HD Theater media extender doesn't change this situation, although it's billed as the way to watch all of your media and millions of Internet videos on your home HDTV. It's much smaller than its predecessor, the stereo-component-size SageTV HD Media Extender, but the new unit still manages to pack in the same features. These include high-definition media streaming from PCs and attached USB storage devices, along with silent operation. This version of the hardware also adds the ability to work without SageTV's Media Center software. Unfortunately, SageTV makes the HD Theater—like many boxes that have come before it, including the SlingCatcher and the Hava Titanium HD WiFi—too often more trouble than it's worth.\n\nFor this review, I'll focus on the HD Theater's new features, such as its built-in online viewing capability. I tested the SageTV HD Theater connected to a 42-inch Panasonic plasma HDTV and an Apple Airport Extreme Base Station with Gigabit Ethernet. My SageTV HD Theater had software version SageTV V6.4.5.1 and firmware dated 12/30/08; no updates were available during the review period.\n\nThe tiny, black-metal HD Theater measures just 1.5 by 6.7 by 5.7 (HWD) inches. Unlike last year's HD Media Extender, this one has no media controls on the front. Instead, there are only power and status lights, along with a USB port. This is fine with me, since the unit comes with the same large, full-featured remote as the previous model. The back panel features inputs for HDMI, component, S-Video, and composite video, along with a second USB port, an S/PDIF digital audio port, and an Ethernet port. In addition to the remote, the unit comes with HDMI, composite, and S-video cables in the box, as well as an Ethernet cable and the power adapter. There are no five-way component video cables in the box, but I'd prefer the HDMI cable in any case.\n\nUnfortunately, the HD Theater still lacks a built-in Wi-Fi radio. You'll have to run cabling to it. If this is a deal breaker, you should consider the more expensive D-Link DSM-750 media extender, which has built-in Wi-Fi.\n\nThe SageTV's setup wasn't a cakewalk. The unit outputs video all the time through the S-Video and composite jacks. This means that when you plug them in and switch to the right video input on your TV you see a picture right away. But the HDMI output doesn't work that way. Instead, you have to click the Video-out button on the remote several times, waiting several seconds each time, until you see a picture. Naturally, I didn't do this at first. The average user will doubtless expect plug-and-play HDMI and will be annoyed to have to figure out how to get it working by actually reading the directions—just as I was. Since there are no indicators on the unit's front panel, I had no idea what was happening. Even if you are the manual-reading type, the manual offers little help. The connection instructions are buried in paragraphs about the optional SageTV Media Center software (for more information on that, check out my review of the HD Media Extender). I ended up unplugging and plugging the unit back in, and swapping out HDMI cables a bunch of times, before the picture finally appeared—about 15 minutes later.\n\nThat done, the SageTV found my network and joined it without a problem. It also automatically adjusted its aspect ratio to match my widescreen television. The main interface screen is laid out like an overblown cell-phone menu, with nine icons arranged in a three-by-three grid. The top row deals with networked media, such as online services, a SageTV Server icon, and Search. The middle row contains music, photos, and video icons, while the bottom row has a configurable Weather icon, a Settings icon, and a cryptic \"Filesystems\" [sic] icon. Under Online Services, there are shortcuts for YouTube, the now-defunct Google Video, news, comedy, sports, science and technology, and other categories. There's also a dedicated section for high-def video, though there are HD videos sprinkled throughout the other sections as well. The interface looked unfinished overall; another coat of UI polish would do wonders for the presentation.—Next: Watching Web Content\n\nWatching Web Content\n\nWhen I clicked on YouTube and Most Viewed, a dialog box appeared as the unit downloaded content. After a few moments, a proprietary SageTV interface popped up, showing videos sorted by today, week, month, and so on. Each video has an info blurb at the top. When I clicked on Obama's address to Congress, almost a full two minutes passed before the clip began playing, and it stuttered horribly. It was unwatchable. I brought up the timeline and saw that this low-res clip—which looked pretty bad to begin with, blown up to full size on a living room television—was buffering at about the rate of a 1,200-baud modem from the 1980s. I tried several more times on different days but could never get a YouTube video to play properly. Fortunately, this problem was limited to that site. I watched numerous other videos, including an episode of Cranky Geeks and an Anderson Cooper 360° \"podcast\" (which is a video podcast). Both played smoothly with no hiccups, although they looked pixelated on a large living room TV. But that's due to a source file limitation rather than a fault with the SageTV unit.\n\nThe HD section, on the other hand, was mostly bare, consisting of about ten science and nature videos, Diggnation HD, and little else. Hulu and ABC.com fans will want to try another box. I cued up a high-definition NASA video about the SOFIA space mission. For some reason there was no sound, and it was too jerky to watch, anyhow. I tried another Comedy HD video, but it crashed the unit. A few minutes later—the HD Theater takes a while to boot, and displays dialog boxes about loading graphics and fonts during the process—it came back up on its own. Many of the categories had no videos at all in them, which was disappointing. Some categories, like HBO's Entourage, gave the impression of having full episodes, but they didn't. There were just lots of short clips and useless behind-the-scenes content, like the junk you almost never watch on the DVD extras. The online services section was mostly a bust; it offered nothing like the high-definition options you get with, say, the Apple TV.\n\nFortunately, other features worked much the same way as before. The unit streams your local MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, Xvid, WMV9, and H.264 video files at up to 1080p resolution (though my HDTV maxes out at 1080i, so I can't test 1080p performance). The unit can also stream content from a NAS. If you have SageTV's optional Media Center software, you can watch live or recorded high-definition television from your PC or Mac using the HD Theater. But you don't need that software just to stream videos anymore, as you did with last year's model. There's still no DVD player like the one in the Linksys Media Center Extender with DVD (DMA2200), although the HD Theater can stream DVDs from a remote PC. The Slingbox PRO-HD, our current Editors' Choice for media extenders, doesn't do a lot of the above—instead, it goes in the other direction, streaming your cable box or DVR to PCs—but it's much easier to set up and works more smoothly.—Next: Testing the SageTV HD Theater\n\nTesting the SageTV HD Theater\n\nIn a series of tests, most of the video formats I tried—Xvid, MP4, WMV, AVI, and so on, at up to 1080i resolution—worked well when streaming from a Windows Vista PC with a crisp, clear picture and flawless stereo sound. A few files played back with video but no sound, but those were WMV10 files. As these aren't officially supported, that's to be expected. The unit did crash again while browsing my Vista PC, forcing yet another reboot. Later, I plugged a Kingston 4GB DataTraveler flash drive into the front USB port. At least the ports are functional this time around; with the previous unit, that wasn't the case. I had no problem playing videos stored on the drive. The HD Theater can also display photos, as well as playing MP3, WMA, AAC, OGG, and FLAC audio files. But it can't stream any protected iTunes, Zune, or PlaysForSure content. The latter two mean almost nothing, but the lack of iTunes support means that many people won't be interested in using the unit as a music player. And, in any case, the interface required so many button presses in these modes that most users won't bother.\n\nThe HD Theater has plenty of competition. The Slingbox PRO-HD is still our Editors' Choice for media extenders. Even though its focus is narrower than the HD Theater, the PRO-HD is a useful device that performs its job very well. The Apple TV prefers that you play within the iTunes Store's walled garden, but it's a cinch to use in comparison and offers high-definition movie rentals to boot. The D-Link DSM-750 accomplishes most of what the HD Theater does, with strong wireless performance to boot, meaning that you won't have to run a cable across your living room. But it's significantly more expensive. Finally, the Buffalo LinkTheater HD is another solid alternative with simpler software, although the SageTV unit is smaller and supports more file formats.\n\nAs it stands, the HD Theater does what it claims to do, more or less, when it comes to playing your local content. But it needs more UI polish, some bug fixes, and—most important—a complete rethink of the online section in order to be a compelling device. At the very least, all of the Web video categories ought to be well populated with videos the unit can actually play.\n\nMore Media Hub Reviews:"
