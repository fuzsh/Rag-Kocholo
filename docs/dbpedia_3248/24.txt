Inglewood, California-based SageTV announced on its website today that it has been acquired by Google. The rest of the site, besides forums, has been closed down and visitors with questions are encouraged to send emails to sagetv-dev@google.com.

SageTV is a mediacenter and Slingbox type of product in one. It isnâ€™t immediately certain how Google will use SageTV but adding its Tivo-like recording capability to GoogleTVand the Google Cloud would certainly be interesting. Placeshifting technology (Slingbox) would also be a compelling technology for GoogleTVs to get into.
