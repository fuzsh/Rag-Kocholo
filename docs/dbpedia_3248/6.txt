Google announced it has acquired Inglewood, California-based SageTV and the company’s multiplatform DVR technology.

SageTV integrates broadcast, Internet, Netflix and Hulu via its Home Theater PC (HTPC) software.

SageTV Placeshifter enables users to view TV from any high-speed Internet connection, similar to Slingbox.

Although details have yet to be announced, we may see SageTV functionality incorporated into Google TV.

From the SageTV site: “We’ve seen how Google’s developer efforts are designed to stimulate innovation across the web, and as developers have played a core role in the success of SageTV, we think our shared vision for open technology will help us advance the online entertainment experience.”
