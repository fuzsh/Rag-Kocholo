        "text": "It’s been a while since I did a book haul post. Since we are slightly past the halfway point of 2018, I thought it would be a good idea to share some of the latest goodies I purchased (or received as gifts). Just when I managed to get my collection organized, the dreaded piles of books are slowly returning. Now that I think about it, wouldn’t it be great if there was a TV show solely dedicated to book hoarders? Maybe great isn’t the right word….\n\nSince I’ve been wanting to read more science fiction lately, I’ve been targeting those sections of the bookstores. Near the beginning of June I picked up The Forever War by Joe Haldeman. It had gotten several good reviews, and I’m happy to report those reviews were correct in my opinion. During that same week, I also found some science fiction short stories published during the 1950’s. I’m really excited to dip into some old-school sci-fi (yes I’m quite the nerd). The other books are all by authors that are new to me, but the plots all sounded really interesting. I’m excited to read Children of Time by Adrian Tchaikovsky, a recent recipient of the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks is heralded as an epic space opera. Since I love time travel, I also picked up Connie Willis’s Doomsday Book. Finally, I grabbed Dark Matter by Blake Crouch that promises to be quite a thriller. Who doesn’t like aliens, parallel worlds, and a little time travel right? Maybe the word “nerd” doesn’t quite cover me.\n\nThen, just this week I made quite the lucky discovery at my local thrift store. Ever since reading Hugh Howey’s phenomenal Wool, I’ve been dying to read the other two books in the Silo trilogy. I’ve been hoping I could find these used, and it looks like my patience finally paid off! When I saw them side by side on the shelf, I let out a squeal which may have startled some of the other customers. Don’t judge me!\n\nOf course my summer book haul isn’t just limited to sci-fi. I’m a multi-genre hoarder people! The Happiness of Pursuit by Chris Guillebeau sounded interesting. It’s all about finding happiness in the process of finding goals. I picked up another novel from one of my favorite authors David Mitchell. Of course, I can’t resist the allure of the short story so I rounded off my haul with collections from Ottessa Moshfegh (someone new to me) and Shirley Jackson (a tried and true friend).\n\nThey say the best books in life are free. I was the lucky winner of one of the quarterly prizes for the 2018 TBR Pile Challenge. My prize was a book of my choice, and I picked The Baron in the Trees from Italo Calvino. I really liked this author since reading If on a winter’s night a traveler. As fate would have it, I discovered another Calvino work while on vacation.\n\nMy best friend was kind enough to spot me a copy of the latest by Terry Brooks so I could participate in the book signing. With friends like mine, who needs books? Well, actually I do.\n\nSpeaking of free books (the best kind), it would be wrong if I didn’t show off this wonderful copy of Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Buried Giant. This lovely copy was given to me by my wife in honor of our anniversary. I thought it a clever twist on the fifth year symbol of wood as the cover has a large tree in addition to books being made of wood. She also got me this awesome wooden bookmark! If you didn’t read my review from two years ago (never too late), you will discover that it was not my favorite of his books. However, I’ve had the urge to do a reread, so my judgement may change. This raises a question in regards to a reread-do I do a completely new review or leave it with the one I’ve already written? No matter what I decide to do, at least I can say I own a copy of every Ishiguro novel. What author should I target next? The mind races.\n\nBetween all of these books as well as the ones I need to finish for my reading challenges, it looks like I’m set. I may put instill a temporary book-buying ban for the remainder of the year. Those don’t work well for me. Books are the worst temptresses aren’t they?\n\nWould you recommend any of the books from this post? What books have you purchased recently? Submit a comment and let’s chat it up!"
