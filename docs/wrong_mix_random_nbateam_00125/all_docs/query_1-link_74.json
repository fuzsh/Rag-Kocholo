        "text": "Today, Russians were shelling our position. Mines cut down three big oaks, broke most of the windows in our building, burnt down a bakery nearby, and badly wounded a local cat. Fortunately, none of our guys got hurt. Over the last two weeks, we (who quite recently worked as financiers, drivers, lawyers, plumbers, entrepreneurs, painters, cooks, students, builders, IT engineers, and bartenders) have learnt well how to survive and how to shoot the enemy. It appears so preposterous that one needs these skills in the 21st century. Well, on 24 February, my whole life suddenly turned into an incredibly preposterous mess. It is like the picture below - blurry, dim and uncertain. There are some recognizable elements in it, but overall, this looks like a reflection of someone else - not me, not my life, not my country, not this century. Many things have changed over the last two weeks. Those goals I was previously working on - new M&A deals, major finance projects, rankings from the reputable legal directories, billable hours, and financial KPIs - they do not matter anymore. They do not help me stay alive. They cannot facilitate the evacuation of my daughter. They cannot protect my parents. They mean little during wartime. Now, it is more important how fast you run, how amptly you shoot, how promptly you get down upon hearing an explosion sound, and how long you can endure cold, hunger and fatigue. It seems like, two weeks ago, the world started rapidly regressing and moved back to the dark medieval times. Times when human life has no value, times when you cannot survive without physical strength and weapons, times when it is not unusual that sick ravings of one psycho tyrant result in destruction of beautiful cities and multiple deaths of innocent children and adults. But do not treat this post as a message of dismay or despair. No way! I cannot remember the last time when I was so enthusiastic and motivated. Yes, my life has changed drastically, and the things I was working on hard before have been put aside and abandoned. But, at the same time, the war - like a spotlight in the dark night - made me see crystal clear the things I value most, the things I am ready to sacrifice my life for. I am happy and honoured to fight in order to protect my dearest family and friends, my lovely Kyiv, and my beautiful Ukraine. There are many of us fighting here, and we will surely win. My only concern is that each day of war brings multiple killings of civilian Ukrainians. You can help us cut down this tragic toll. Please put pressure on your governments that they request NATO to CLOSE THE SKY OVER UKRAINE. We will do the rest, be sure of it. But please close the sky over Ukraine."
