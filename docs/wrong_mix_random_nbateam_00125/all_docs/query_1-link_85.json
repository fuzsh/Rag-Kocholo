        "text": "Scott Kinkead’s contributions to science and national security have been extraordinary. After he graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1974 with a degree in chemistry, he then served five years in the Air Force before retiring with the rank of captain. From there, he enrolled in the chemistry graduate program at University of Idaho in 1979 and completed a Ph.D. in 1984.\n\nThe most important contribution of Kinkead’s career has been his commitment to science and technology to protect the U.S. from nuclear threats and terrorist weapons. A major concern leading to the 2003 Iraq War was the potential development of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Kinkead volunteered as a civilian to investigate this topic as a member of the Iraq Survey Group in Baghdad. He participated in efforts to locate nuclear detonators and gauge Iraq’s capacity to develop nuclear weapons. For his efforts in Iraq, Kinkead was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nDuring his career, Kinkead has received significant recognition including the Idaho Academy of Sciences Speakers Award and Sigma Xi (North Idaho Section) Publication Award. The Department of Energy has presented him with two Recognition of Excellence Awards and three Distinguished Performance Awards. Nationally, Kinkead was recognized by the National Academy of Sciences, including receiving the National Academy of Sciences Eastern European Exchange Fellowship. As a leader on the High Explosives Science and Technology group at Los Alamos National Laboratory, he earned the coveted R&D 100 Award, often referred to as the “Oscars of Innovation” and the “Nobel Prize of Engineering” by the technical community.\n\nKinkead has had an extraordinary career in chemistry, but most significantly, he has dedicated himself to ensuring our nation’s security. He chose to focus his education, talents and abilities to protect the country, minimize nuclear threats and protect our deployed military. He has also used his knowledge and science to address serious environmental issues associated with disposal of contaminated equipment and lead contamination issues affecting both military personnel and civilians.\n\nAlthough much of Kinkead’s career has involved classified efforts in service to America, he has more than 40 publications, including 33 peer reviewed articles, 9 patents and three book chapters to his credit.\n\nScott Kinkead is an extraordinary individual and an exceptional graduate of University of Idaho who has represented U of I with honor and distinction throughout his military and civilian career. We are proud to recognize him with our highest honor, the University of Idaho Alumni Association Hall of Fame Award.\n\nThomas Slayton was a standout Vandal while attending University of Idaho. He was elected Associated Students of the University of Idaho (ASUI) vice president and was honored with the 1972 Theophilus Outstanding Senior Award — the highest honor given to a graduating senior. This was just the beginning of Slayton’s stellar career in service not only to our nation, but internationally as well.\n\nAfter graduating from U of I, he enrolled in Columbia University where he earned a master’s degree in international affairs before moving to Washington, D.C. to work for the federal government. While in Washington, Slayton met and married his wife Cherie and embarked on a career in the Foreign Agricultural Service, eventually becoming a foremost expert on the international rice trade.\n\nBetween foreign assignments, Slayton worked to grow the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s capabilities to better understand the inner workings of the international rice trade. His assignment to Thailand, the world’s largest rice exporter, built his expertise on the intricacies of rice trade and inspired him to modify his career to a position where he could have a more direct and insightful impact on U.S. rice industry policies, practices and programs at the U.S. Rice Millers’ Association. Slayton was instrumental in nurturing an international, commercial trade interest throughout an industry that had long focused on a stagnant domestic market and subsidized foreign sales. This was a monumental shift in an industry tightly controlled by a network of rice growers and millers.\n\nSlayton helped move the industry to a position of lobbying and working with the U.S. government to open new markets for American rice worldwide. His knowledge of U.S. competitors and evolving global import markets grew as he advised the U.S. industry on opportunities to improve its business prospects. A key outcome of his work was to increase U.S. rice production viability for farmers when the loss of subsidized exports was replaced by a move to commercial opportunities.\n\nA student of the rice market for 40 years, Slayton occupied a unique position between the commercial rice market and academia/public officials in the U.S., the United Nations and the World Bank. He played a key role in both analyzing the origins of the 2008 rice crisis and providing a solution to “pricking the price bubble.” Along the way, he founded Slayton & Associates, a consulting firm that was recognized as the most authoritative and up-to-date source of information on world rice market developments. The firm had clients in 15 countries that included virtually all the major international rice trading firms, the leading export firms in several of the major markets, international banks and governments.\n\nSlayton’s continuing generosity to U of I underscores his ongoing commitment to education, service and paying it forward to facilitate positive change. We are honored to welcome him into the University of Idaho Alumni Association Hall of Fame.\n\nSteven Smith’s career path began at University of Idaho where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology in 1968 and continued to flourish in postgraduate work, where he a received a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from UCLA. After studies at University of Bern in Bern, Switzerland and completing a postdoctoral fellowship at Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in San Diego, California, Smith was recruited to the Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope in Duarte, California as an assistant research scientist. He rose through the ranks and was promoted to full professor of molecular science in the Divisions of Surgery and Urology in 2001. He served eight years as the director of molecular carcinogenesis in the Clinical Cancer Center and for 11 years as the director of cell and tumor biology in the Surgery Division.\n\nIn 1996, Smith was recognized by University of Oklahoma for his contributions to the field of DNA methylation, a mechanism that cells use to control gene expression. His service to the scientific community includes serving on several National Institute of Health (NIH) Study Sections, as executive editor of Analytical Biochemistry and the International Institute of Anticancer Research’s Editorial Board of Cancer Genomics and Proteomics.\n\nSmith’s main research since joining the City of Hope has been on the impact of DNA structure on DNA methylation, genetic stability and cancer. His research has been supported by NIH, including almost 30 years of support for structural studies of human DNA methylation. He has more than 100 research publications with an emphasis on the development of methodology such as markers for detection of prostate cancer and nanoparticles for cancer research. He holds seven patents with several more pending.\n\nSmith is an exceptional scientist and much of his work has been ahead of its time. His work in the field of epigenetics (the study of behaviors, environments, developmental processes and aging that can affect how gene action is altered without changes in DNA sequence) has been recognized by the Burroughs Welcome Fund with a Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biologists Visiting Professor Award. Smith is also an Honors Laureate for visionary use of information technology in medicine from Computerworld. He continues to contribute novel findings in recent publications, including work that will add significantly to our understanding of cellular deterioration during aging.\n\nIt is our honor to induct Steve Smith into the University of Idaho Alumni Association Hall of Fame.\n\nLawrence Wasden served Idahoans as Idaho’s attorney general for two decades — the longest-serving attorney general in Idaho history. During his tenure, he didn’t seek headlines or attention to gather support for his elections. Rather, he focused on doing what was right, not what was always popular at the moment. Throughout his career, Wasden exhibited a keen understanding and respect for the U.S. Constitution and Idaho’s Constitution, and always applied the rule of law.\n\nOne example of his integrity is when he made the decision that Idaho would not join Texas in a lawsuit challenging the 2020 presidential election results. This decision was not entirely politically popular for his career, but he did what he believed to be right for Idahoans, saying “I defended the state of Idaho, I defended our sovereignty, I defended our Constitution, both the United States’ and the state’s constitution.”\n\nWasden cares for everyone living in Idaho, including children. He worked on a task force for Internet Crimes Against Children and was recognized by the National Association of Attorneys General for his long-term commitment and leadership in reducing youth tobacco use. His work to help create education and outreach efforts educates youth and adults about the risks and dangers of smoking.\n\nBeyond his commitment of service to Idahoans, Wasden also reached across international borders to support the rule of law in Mexico and Central America. Wasden brought groups of Mexican law enforcement officials to Idaho for training in collaboration with the U.S. Agency for International Development and even hosted a dinner for them at his home. His goal was “to create this understanding that they were not alone, we are standing with them side by side for justice.”\n\nWasden was also the chair of the National Association of Attorneys General Mission Foundation and co-leader of a project that led more than 28 volunteers to Puerto Rico for two weeks to support public safety efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Maria. In 2022, the National Association of Attorneys General created an award named in part after Wasden, dubbed the Miller-Wasden Unity Award that honors commitment to supporting civility and unity throughout the attorneys general community.\n\nAnother former Idaho Attorney General, Jim Jones, said about Lawrence, “There is no leeway for favoring your friends or party when the laws stands in the way. Lawrence characterized his work as honestly ‘calling balls and strikes,’ and he routinely put the interests of the people above his own.”\n\nForever committed to Idaho, to the United States, to neighboring countries and the rule of law, we are proud to induct Lawrence Wasden into the University of Idaho Alumni Association Hall of Fame.\n\nLeah Frye earned her B.S. in chemistry at the University of Idaho in 1979, followed by her Ph.D. in organic chemistry at Johns Hopkins University in 1984. Aa a student at U of I, Frye received the Ernest Hiram Lindley and Elizabeth Kidder Award (Outstanding Senior, College of Letters and Sciences) and William H. Cone Award (Outstanding Senior, Department of Chemistry). She was also awarded a graduate teaching assistantship for her junior and senior years. She was also recognized nationally by being elected to the Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi honorary societies.\n\nShe completed a post-doctoral fellowship in the Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, supported by a prestigious NIH National Research Service Award. After a year at the University of Virginia, Frye joined the faculty of the Rensselaer Polytechnic University as an assistant professor of chemistry in 1987. She was promoted to associate professor with tenure in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Frye left Rensselaer and joined Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals as principal scientist, a position she held until 2001. In 2002, she began her distinguished career with Schrödinger, a company that develops chemical simulation software for use in pharmaceutical, biotechnology and materials research. She co-founded Schrödinger’s Drug Discovery Applications Group and served as project leader (2002-2007), director (2007-2010) and senior director (2010-2012). Frye served as vice president of the Drug Discovery Applications Group from 2012 to 2019, with more than 80 people on her team.\n\nFrye has an extensive record of research and publications. She is an inventor on 20 U.S. patents. She is active in professional organizations, including the American Chemical Society and has served on committees for the National Institutes of Health and the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Frye has also been active in promoting the field of chemistry and supporting opportunities for women in the field.\n\nFrye currently lives in Portland, Oregon, and has been married for more than 40 years to Daniel Frye ‘79, a 2010 Alumni Hall of Fame inductee. Although she no longer lives in Idaho, she continues to contribute to the university. Since 2019, Frye has served as a member of the U of I College of Science Advisory Board. In addition, she and her husband established the “Daniel and Leah Frye Chemistry and Physics Scholarship,” which supports students who are Idaho residents and members of underrepresented groups in science and technology. She is also a member of U of I's Heritage Society for including the university in her estate plans.\n\nIn 2018, Frye was recognized with an Alumni Silver and Gold Award for her extraordinary career in science and technology, and in the interdisciplinary areas of chemistry, biology and medicine. In recognition of her distinguished career accomplishments and leadership in improving the well-being of society through drug discovery research, Leah Frye is very worthy of induction into the University of Idaho Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\nCharlotte Hill was born in Jerome, Idaho, and after living in other states, her family returned to their “roots” in Hailey, Idaho. She graduated from what is now Hailey High School, but at that time was known as Wood River High School. Hill earned her bachelor’s degrees at the University of Idaho in bacteriology and chemistry in 1976 and 1977. She earned an M.B.A. at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1994.\n\nHill began her career as an analytical chemist at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL, now INL) from 1977 to 1979. Her research at INEL resulted in the development of new methods to identify, isolate, and quantify specific ions relating to use or production of nuclear or geothermal energy. Recycling nuclear waste is critical to the cost-effectiveness and waste reduction in the nuclear industry. The ion chromatographic techniques she developed were important in identifying and quantifying critical ions to reduce waste and enhance pollution reduction.\n\nHill worked for IBM from 1980 to 1989, rising to the position of manufacturing engineering manager, with responsibility for the development, building and maintenance of high-volume processing equipment for hard disk drive magnetic media. For her contributions to improve the yield of disk assemblies and their components, and validating methods of cleanliness pertaining to clean rooms, equipment and personnel, Hill was awarded the Excellence Award at IBM.\n\nShe served as senior manufacturing engineering/production manager for Electronics & Space Corp. from 1989 until 1995 and as vice president of operations/quality assurance for Rantec Microwave and Electronics from 1995 to 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Hill began her distinguished association with Georg Fischer Signet, a company in El Monte, California, which is a subsidiary of Switzerland-based Georg Fischer Corporation. She served as vice president of operations from 1996 to 1999 and as vice president of marketing from 1999 to 2001. She served as president and CEO from 2001 to her retirement in 2016.\n\nDuring her time as president, the company grew from $11 million to $35 million in revenues. Hill also led work to develop products to reduce water usage and avoid contamination.\n\nHill has been active in professional organizations and served on the Measurement, Control and Automation Association board of directors from 2005 to 2011, including service as vice chair and chair. She has also been active in the Los Angeles Section of the Instrumentation, Systems, and Automation Society, having served in the past as secretary and treasurer.\n\nHill also contributes to her local community through volunteer efforts. Notably, she has supported meaningful job creation efforts for persons with disabilities in the manufacturing facilities of Georg Fisher. She also generously supports the American Red Cross and University of Idaho.\n\nHill has contributed to U of I for many years. Hill is a member of U of I's Heritage Society for including the university in her estate plans. In 2020, she co-sponsored the Charlotte Hill and Carol Lisek Science Excellence Endowment. The endowment provides scholarships for undergraduates in a broad range of disciplines including chemistry, biological sciences, and animal, veterinary and food sciences. She is an active and valued member of the College of Science Advisory Board.\n\nUniversity of Idaho has recognized her distinguished career and contributions to society with the Silver and Gold Award in 2013 and with induction into the College of Science Academy of Distinguished Alumni in 2019.\n\nFor her career accomplishments and leadership in career organizations, Charlotte Hill is very deserving of induction into the University of Idaho Alumni Hall of Fame.\n\nRandy Luten is a stellar Vandal who has served his community, country, profession, and alma mater with distinction. During his illustrious 35-year military and professional career, he achieved the rank of Major in the U.S. Army before transitioning his career to the civilian world.\n\nA son of the South, Luten came to the University of Idaho to play football in the late 1970s. He joined the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, served on the student recreation board, and worked as a graduate assistant football coach. He also worked several jobs to help pay for his schooling. Those included writing parking tickets on campus, making sandwiches for a local eatery and buying and selling used cars.\n\nDuring a very busy weekend, he married his college sweetheart, Margaret “Peggy” Matukonis ‘82, ‘83 on a Friday, commissioned in the Army the next morning and graduated later that Saturday afternoon with a bachelor’s degree in general studies.\n\nAt that point, Luten immediately went to Fort Benning, Georgia, where he completed officer basic training, and Airborne, Ranger, Demolition and Air Assault schools. He was awarded the Merrill’s Marauders Award for Best Ranger.\n\nAfter serving as a platoon leader and executive officer in the infantry, he was transferred to Intelligence in Europe. His specialty was Human Intelligence, and with his interest in technology, he developed the first database for all source intelligence collection and was selected to run a new intelligence field called Measurement and Signature Intelligence, or MASINT.\n\nAlthough Luten left the military in 1994, he was called back into service two years later during the Bosnian conflict to serve as head of US NATO Human Intelligence Operations in Sarajevo and Chief of Special Operations Intelligence in Bosnia and surrounding countries. After Bosnia, he worked for Electronic Warfare Associates designing robots and spectral analysis systems and was called back into service again for Y2K and following the Sept. 11 attack on the U.S. He has received multiple military awards and decorations during his career.\n\nLuten was then recruited by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) Special Operations Section to develop leading-edge intelligence collection systems for its programs. While serving as an intelligence analyst/technical advisor in the Special Operations Division of the DEA, Luten designed and developed a database to monitor international drug activities and track the top-10 drug lords and all their known associates throughout the world. This database was key to capturing some of the most powerful cartel leaders in Mexico and Central and South America, and in providing supporting evidence in subsequent trials.\n\nAfter working for several IT companies in the Washington D.C. area, he started Logicteer in 2006 and bought another IT company, ASD Corp, combining the two to provide a full-service IT company specializing in large-scale datacenter deployments, national networks, and big data.\n\nLuten’s interest in international service has never waned. In April 2022, he returned from a humanitarian mission in Ukraine started Humanitarian Express, a non-profit organization focused on solving some of the problems in Ukraine, especially European customs delays and supply delivery. The organization also supports the overall humanitarian coordination effort in Ukraine. He knew with a little cooperation from the United Nations and the State Department, and the use of new technologies, Humanitarian Express could turn resupply from a 30- to 60-day venture into a 3- to 4-day operation.\n\nLuten’s wife Peggy passed away in 2012. Together, they had two children, Megan, and Christine. Christine Luten is currently attending the University of Idaho as a proud Legacy Vandal. In 2019, Luten married Kathleen Duncan, who has three children from her first marriage: Kara, Alex, and Patrick Duncan.\n\nThroughout all facets of his career, Luten remained a steadfast and loyal Vandal. He was a member of the advisory council for the university’s Operation Education for Veteran Students and is a current member of the Vandal National Scholarship Foundation board and given generously to support these and other programs.\n\nStarting in 2011, Luton joined the U of I Alumni Association (UIAA) board of directors where he served his fellow alumni for 10 years, eventually becoming president of the board. At the UIAA board meeting in spring 2017, Luten presented a big, bold idea to benefit Vandals for decades to come. After talking with then-Athletics Director Rob Spear, Luten asked his fellow board members to consider making a major donation to the new arena. The donation would give UIAA naming rights to a space in the arena for all members of the Vandal Family to gather and connect. It was his initiative and imagination that persuaded the UIAA board to approve a six-figure investment in the new arena.\n\nIn addition to the inspiration to invest in the arena, Luten applied his business acumen to ensure the UIAA board had the resources to make it happen. He took a hands-on role in helping to manage the board’s funds through some of the stock market’s most volatile times. As a result, the board was able to secure the funds for a $500,000 investment in the arena without touching the corpus of its endowment.\n\nThe UIAA gift became a catalyst for other organizations and individuals to make major gifts to the arena project. It was a turning point in the overall fundraising campaign for the facility that created the space known as the Alumni Club Room.\n\nRandy Luten epitomizes the intelligence, initiative, grit and spirit of a true Vandal, and he is a perfect candidate for the Hall of Fame.\n\nRichard Ormsby grew up in Coeur d’Alene, graduated from Coeur d’Alene High School and then transferred to the University of Idaho from North Idaho Junior College in 1952.
