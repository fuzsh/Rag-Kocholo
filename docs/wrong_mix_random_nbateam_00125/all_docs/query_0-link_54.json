This is a long one, even longer than the previous episode, but don’t worry, that won’t be the norm. There’s a reason these two were much longer than average. Click the full post to read liner notes, links to more information, and a transcript of the episode.\n\nPatreon backers also have a twenty-minute bonus episode available, on “Codine” by the Charlatans.\n\nErrata\n\nI mispronounce Brent Mydland’s name as Myland a couple of times, and in the introduction I say “Touch of Grey” came out in 1988 — I later, correctly, say 1987. (I seem to have had a real problem with dates in the intro — I also originally talked about “Blue Suede Shoes” being in 1954 before fixing it in the edit to be 1956)\n\nResources\n\nNo Mixcloud this week, as there are too many songs by the Grateful Dead, and Grayfolded runs to two hours.\n\nI referred to a lot of books for this episode, partly because almost everything about the Grateful Dead is written from a fannish perspective that already assumes background knowledge, rather than to provide that background knowledge. Of the various books I used, Dennis McNally’s biography of the band and This Is All a Dream We Dreamed: An Oral History of the Grateful Dead by Blair Jackson and David Gans are probably most useful for the casually interested.\n\nOther books on the Dead I used included McNally’s Jerry on Jerry, a collection of interviews with Garcia; Deal, Bill Kreutzmann’s autobiography; The Grateful Dead FAQ by Tony Sclafani; So Many Roads by David Browne; Deadology by Howard F. Weiner; Fare Thee Well by Joel Selvin and Pamela Turley; and Skeleton Key: A Dictionary for Deadheads by David Shenk and Steve Silberman.\n\nTom Wolfe’s The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test is the classic account of the Pranksters, though not always reliable.\n\nI reference Slaughterhouse Five a lot. As well as the novel itself, which everyone should read, I also read this rather excellent graphic novel adaptation, and The Writer’s Crusade, a book about the writing of the novel.\n\nI also reference Ted Sturgeon’s More Than Human. For background on the scene around Astounding Science Fiction which included Sturgeon, John W. Campbell, L. Ron Hubbard, and many other science fiction writers, I recommend Alec Nevala-Lee’s Astounding.\n\n1,000 True Fans can be read online, as can the essay on the Californian ideology, and John Perry Barlow’s “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace”.\n\nThe best collection of Grateful Dead material is the box set The Golden Road, which contains all the albums released in Pigpen’s lifetime along with a lot of bonus material, but which appears currently out of print. Live/Dead contains both the live version of “Dark Star” which made it well known and, as a CD bonus track, the original single version. And archive.org has more live recordings of the group than you can possibly ever listen to.\n\nGrayfolded can be bought from John Oswald’s Bandcamp\n\nPatreon\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by the generosity of my backers on Patreon. Why not join them?\n\nTranscript\n\n[Excerpt: Tuning from “Grayfolded”, under the warnings]\n\nBefore we begin — as we’re tuning up, as it were, I should mention that this episode contains discussions of alcoholism, drug addiction, racism, nonconsensual drugging of other people, and deaths from drug abuse, suicide, and car accidents. As always, I try to deal with these subjects as carefully as possible, but if you find any of those things upsetting you may wish to read the transcript rather than listen to this episode, or skip it altogether.\n\nAlso, I should note that the members of the Grateful Dead were much freer with their use of swearing in interviews than any other band we’ve covered so far, and that makes using quotes from them rather more difficult than with other bands, given the limitations of the rules imposed to stop the podcast being marked as adult. If I quote anything with a word I can’t use here, I’ll give a brief pause in the audio, and in the transcript I’ll have the word in square brackets.\n\n[tuning ends]\n\nAll this happened, more or less.\n\nIn 1910, T. S. Eliot started work on “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock”, which at the time was deemed barely poetry, with one reviewer imagining Eliot saying “I’ll just put down the first thing that comes into my head, and call it ‘The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.'” It is now considered one of the great classics of modernist literature.\n\nIn 1969, Kurt Vonnegut wrote “Slaughterhouse-Five, or, The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death”, a book in which the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, comes unstuck in time, and starts living a nonlinear life, hopping around between times reliving his experiences in the Second World War, and future experiences up to 1976 after being kidnapped by beings from the planet Tralfamadore. Or perhaps he has flashbacks and hallucinations after having a breakdown from PTSD. It is now considered one of the great classics of modernist literature or of science fiction, depending on how you look at it.\n\nIn 1953, Theodore Sturgeon wrote More Than Human. It is now considered one of the great classics of science fiction.\n\nIn 1950, L. Ron Hubbard wrote Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. It is now considered either a bad piece of science fiction or one of the great revelatory works of religious history, depending on how you look at it.\n\nIn 1994, 1995, and 1996 the composer John Oswald released, first as two individual CDs and then as a double-CD, an album called Grayfolded, which the composer says in the liner notes he thinks of as existing in Tralfamadorian time. The Tralfamadorians in Vonnegut’s novels don’t see time as a linear thing with a beginning and end, but as a continuum that they can move between at will. When someone dies, they just think that at this particular point in time they’re not doing so good, but at other points in time they’re fine, so why focus on the bad time? In the book, when told of someone dying, the Tralfamadorians just say “so it goes”.\n\nIn between the first CD’s release and the release of the double-CD version, Jerry Garcia died. From August 1942 through August 1995, Jerry Garcia was alive.\n\nSo it goes.\n\nShall we go, you and I?\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Dark Star (Omni 3/30/94)”]\n\n“One principle has become clear. Since motives are so frequently found in combination, it is essential that the complex types be analyzed and arranged, with an eye kept single nevertheless to the master-theme under discussion. Collectors, both primary and subsidiary, have done such valiant service that the treasures at our command are amply sufficient for such studies, so extensive, indeed, that the task of going through them thoroughly has become too great for the unassisted student. It cannot be too strongly urged that a single theme in its various types and compounds must be made predominant in any useful comparative study. This is true when the sources and analogues of any literary work are treated; it is even truer when the bare motive is discussed.\n\nThe Grateful Dead furnishes an apt illustration of the necessity of such handling. It appears in a variety of different combinations, almost never alone. Indeed, it is so widespread a tale, and its combinations are so various, that there is the utmost difficulty in determining just what may properly be regarded the original kernel of it, the simple theme to which other motives were joined. Various opinions, as we shall see, have been held with reference to this matter, most of them justified perhaps by the materials in the hands of the scholars holding them, but none quite adequate in view of later evidence.”\n\nThat’s a quote from The Grateful Dead: The History of a Folk Story, by Gordon Hall Gerould, published in 1908.\n\nKurt Vonnegut’s novel Slaughterhouse-Five opens with a chapter about the process of writing the novel itself, and how difficult it was. He says “I would hate to tell you what this lousy little book cost me in money and anxiety and time. When I got home from the Second World War twenty-three years ago, I thought it would be easy for me to write about the destruction of Dresden, since all I would have to do would be to report what I had seen. And I thought, too, that it would be a masterpiece or at least make me a lot of money, since the subject was so big.”\n\nThis is an episode several of my listeners have been looking forward to, but it’s one I’ve been dreading writing, because this is an episode — I think the only one in the series — where the format of the podcast simply *will not* work. Were the Grateful Dead not such an important band, I would skip this episode altogether, but they’re a band that simply can’t be ignored, and that’s a real problem here.\n\nBecause my intent, always, with this podcast, is to present the recordings of the artists in question, put them in context, and explain why they were important, what their music meant to its listeners. To put, as far as is possible, the positive case for why the music mattered *in the context of its time*. Not why it matters now, or why it matters to me, but why it matters *in its historical context*. Whether I like the music or not isn’t the point. Whether it stands up now isn’t the point. I play the music, explain what it was they were doing, why they were doing it, what people saw in it. If I do my job well, you come away listening to “Blue Suede Shoes” the way people heard it in 1956, or “Good Vibrations” the way people heard it in 1966, and understanding why people were so impressed by those records.\n\nThat is simply *not possible* for the Grateful Dead.\n\nI can present a case for them as musicians, and hope to do so. I can explain the appeal as best I understand it, and talk about things I like in their music, and things I’ve noticed. But what I can’t do is present their recordings the way they were received in the sixties and explain why they were popular.\n\nBecause every other act I have covered or will cover in this podcast has been a *recording* act, and their success was based on records. They may also have been exceptional live performers, but James Brown or Ike and Tina Turner are remembered for great *records*, like “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag” or “River Deep, Mountain High”. Their great moments were captured on vinyl, to be listened back to, and susceptible of analysis.\n\nThat is not the case for the Grateful Dead, and what is worse *they explicitly said, publicly, on multiple occasions* that it is not possible for me to understand their art, and thus that it is not possible for me to explain it.\n\nThe Grateful Dead did make studio records, some of them very good. But they always said, consistently, over a thirty year period, that their records didn’t capture what they did, and that the only way — the *only* way, they were very clear about this — that one could actually understand and appreciate their music, was to see them live, and furthermore to see them live while on psychedelic drugs.\n\n[Excerpt: Grateful Dead crowd noise]\n\nI never saw the Grateful Dead live — their last UK performance was a couple of years before I went to my first ever gig — and I have never taken a psychedelic substance. So by the Grateful Dead’s own criteria, it is literally impossible for me to understand or explain their music the way that it should be understood or explained. In a way I’m in a similar position to the one I was in with La Monte Young in the last episode, whose music it’s mostly impossible to experience without being in his presence. This is one reason of several why I placed these two episodes back to back.\n\nOf course, there is a difference between Young and the Grateful Dead. The Grateful Dead allowed — even encouraged — the recording of their live performances. There are literally thousands of concert recordings in circulation, many of them of professional quality. I have listened to many of those, and I can hear what they were doing. I can tell you what *I* think is interesting about their music, and about their musicianship. And I think I can build up a good case for why they were important, and why they’re interesting, and why those recordings are worth listening to. And I can certainly explain the cultural phenomenon that was the Grateful Dead.\n\nBut just know that while I may have found *a* point, *an* explanation for why the Grateful Dead were important, by the band’s own lights and those of their fans, no matter how good a job I do in this episode, I *cannot* get it right.\n\nAnd that is, in itself, enough of a reason for this episode to exist, and for me to try, even harder than I normally do, to get it right *anyway*. Because no matter how well I do my job this episode will stand as an example of why this series is called “*A* History”, not *the* history. Because parts of the past are ephemeral. There are things about which it’s true to say “You had to be there”. I cannot know what it was like to have been an American the day Kennedy was shot, I cannot know what it was like to be alive when a man walked on the Moon. Those are things nobody my age or younger can ever experience. And since August the ninth, 1995, the experience of hearing the Grateful Dead’s music the way they wanted it heard has been in that category.\n\nAnd that is by design. Jerry Garcia once said “if you work really hard as an artist, you may be able to build something they can’t tear down, you know, after you’re gone… What I want to do is I want it here. I want it now, in this lifetime. I want what I enjoy to last as long as I do and not last any longer. You know, I don’t want something that ends up being as much a nuisance as it is a work of art, you know?”\n\nAnd there’s another difficulty. There are only two points in time where it makes sense to do a podcast episode on the Grateful Dead — late 1967 and early 1968, when the San Francisco scene they were part of was at its most culturally relevant, and 1988 when they had their only top ten hit and gained their largest audience. I can’t realistically leave them out of the story until 1988, so it has to be 1968. But the songs they are most remembered for are those they wrote between 1970 and 1972, and those songs are influenced by artists and events we haven’t yet covered in the podcast, who will be getting their own episodes in the future. I can’t explain those things in this episode, because they need whole episodes of their own. I can’t not explain them without leaving out important context for the Grateful Dead.\n\nSo the best I can do is treat the story I’m telling as if it were in Tralfamadorian time. All of it’s happening all at once, and some of it is happening in different episodes that haven’t been recorded yet. The podcast as a whole travels linearly from 1938 through to 1999, but this episode is happening in 1968 and 1972 and 1988 and 1995 and other times, all at once. Sometimes I’ll talk about things as if you’re already familiar with them, but they haven’t happened yet in the story. Feel free to come unstuck in time and revisit this time after episode 167, and 172, and 176, and 192, and experience it again.\n\nSo this has to be an experimental episode. It may well be an experiment that you think fails. If so, the next episode is likely to be far more to your taste, and much shorter than this or the last episode, two episodes that between them have to create a scaffolding on which will hang much of the rest of this podcast’s narrative. I’ve finished my Grateful Dead script now. The next one I write is going to be fun:\n\n[Excerpt: Grateful Dead, “Dark Star”]\n\nInfrastructure means everything. How we get from place to place, how we transport goods, information, and ourselves, makes a big difference in how society is structured, and in the music we hear. For many centuries, the prime means of long-distance transport was by water — sailing ships on the ocean, canal boats and steamboats for inland navigation — and so folk songs talked about the ship as both means of escape, means of making a living, and in some senses as a trap. You’d go out to sea for adventure, or to escape your problems, but you’d find that the sea itself brought its own problems. Because of this we have a long, long tradition of sea shanties which are known throughout the world:\n\n[Excerpt: A. L. Lloyd, “Off to Sea Once More”]\n\nBut in the nineteenth century, the railway was invented and, at least as far as travel within a landmass goes, it replaced the steamboat in the popular imaginary. Now the railway was how you got from place to place, and how you moved freight from one place to another. The railway brought freedom, and was an opportunity for outlaws, whether train robbers or a romanticised version of the hobo hopping onto a freight train and making his way to new lands and new opportunity. It was the train that brought soldiers home from wars, and the train that allowed the Great Migration of Black people from the South to the industrial North.\n\nThere would still be songs about the riverboats, about how ol’ man river keeps rolling along and about the big river Johnny Cash sang about, but increasingly they would be songs of the past, not the present.\n\nThe train quickly replaced the steamboat in the iconography of what we now think of as roots music — blues, country, folk, and early jazz music. Sometimes this was very literal. Furry Lewis’ “Kassie Jones” — about a legendary train driver who would break the rules to make sure his train made the station on time, but who ended up sacrificing his own life to save his passengers in a train crash — is based on “Alabamy Bound”, which as we heard in the episode on “Stagger Lee”, was about steamboats:\n\n[Excerpt: Furry Lewis, “Kassie Jones”]\n\nIn the early episodes of this podcast we heard many, many, songs about the railway. Louis Jordan saying “take me right back to the track, Jack”, Rosetta Tharpe singing about how “this train don’t carry no gamblers”, the trickster freight train driver driving on the “Rock Island Line”, the mystery train sixteen coaches long, the train that kept-a-rollin’ all night long, the Midnight Special which the prisoners wished would shine its ever-loving light on them, and the train coming past Folsom Prison whose whistle makes Johnny Cash hang his head and cry.\n\nBut by the 1960s, that kind of song had started to dry up. It would happen on occasion — “People Get Ready” by the Impressions is the most obvious example of the train metaphor in an important sixties record — but by the late sixties the train was no longer a symbol of freedom but of the past. In 1969 Harry Nilsson sang about how “Nobody Cares About the Railroads Any More”, and in 1968 the Kinks sang about “The Last of the Steam-Powered Trains”. When in 1968 Merle Haggard sang about a freight train, it was as a memory, of a child with hopes that ended up thwarted by reality and his own nature:\n\n[Excerpt: Merle Haggard, “Mama Tried”]\n\nAnd the reason for this was that there had been another shift, a shift that had started in the forties and accelerated in the late fifties but had taken a little time to ripple through the culture.\n\nNow the train had been replaced in the popular imaginary by motorised transport. Instead of hopping on a train without paying, if you had no money in your pocket you’d have to hitch-hike all the way. Freedom now meant individuality. The ultimate in freedom was the biker — the Hell’s Angels who could go anywhere, unburdened by anything — and instead of goods being moved by freight train, increasingly they were being moved by truck drivers. By the mid-seventies, truck drivers took a central place in American life, and the most romantic way to live life was to live it on the road.\n\nOn The Road was also the title of a 1957 novel by Jack Kerouac, which was one of the first major signs of this cultural shift in America. Kerouac was writing about events in the late forties and early fifties, but his book was also a precursor of the sixties counterculture. He wrote the book on one continuous sheet of paper, as a stream of consciousness. Kerouac died in 1969 of an internal haemmorage brought on by too much alcohol consumption. So it goes.\n\nBut the big key to this cultural shift was caused by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, a massive infrastructure spending bill that led to the construction of the modern American Interstate Highway system. This accelerated a program that had already started, of building much bigger, safer, faster roads.\n\nIt also, as anyone who has read Robert Caro’s The Power Broker knows, reinforced segregation and white flight. It did this both by making commuting into major cities from the suburbs easier — thus allowing white people with more money to move further away from the cities and still work there — and by bulldozing community spaces where Black people lived. More than a million people lost their homes and were forcibly moved, and orders of magnitude more lost their communities’ parks and green spaces. And both as a result of deliberate actions and unconscious bigotry, the bulk of those affected were Black people — who often found themselves, if they weren’t forced to move, on one side of a ten-lane highway where the park used to be, with white people on the other side of the highway.\n\nThe Federal-Aid Highway Act gave even more power to the unaccountable central planners like Robert Moses, the urban planner in New York who managed to become arguably the most powerful man in the city without ever getting elected, partly by slowly compromising away his early progressive ideals in the service of gaining more power.\n\nOf course, not every new highway was built through areas where poor Black people lived. Some were planned to go through richer areas for white people, just because you can’t completely do away with geographical realities. For example one was planned to be built through part of San Francisco, a rich, white part. But the people who owned properties in that area had enough political power and clout to fight the development, and after nearly a decade of fighting it, the development was called off in late 1966.\n\nBut over that time, many of the owners of the impressive buildings in the area had moved out, and they had no incentive to improve or maintain their properties while they were under threat of demolition, so many of them were rented out very cheaply.\n\nAnd when the beat community that Kerouac wrote about, many of whom had settled in San Francisco, grew too large and notorious for the area of the city they were in, North Beach, many of them moved to these cheap homes in a previously-exclusive area. The area known as Haight-Ashbury.\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Grayfolded”]\n\nStories all have their starts, even stories told in Tralfamadorian time, although sometimes those starts are shrouded in legend. For example, the story of Scientology’s start has been told many times, with different people claiming to have heard L. Ron Hubbard talk about how writing was a mug’s game, and if you wanted to make real money, you needed to get followers, start a religion. Either he said this over and over and over again, to many different science fiction writers, or most science fiction writers of his generation were liars. Of course, the definition of a writer is someone who tells lies for money, so who knows? One of the more plausible accounts of him saying that is given by Theodore Sturgeon. Sturgeon’s account is more believable than most, because Sturgeon went on to be a supporter of Dianetics, the “new science” that Hubbard turned into his religion, for decades, even while telling the story.\n\nThe story of the Grateful Dead probably starts as it ends, with Jerry Garcia. There are three things that everyone writing about the Dead says about Garcia’s childhood, so we might as well say them here too. The first is that he was named by a music-loving father after Jerome Kern, the songwriter responsible for songs like “Ol’ Man River” (though as Oscar Hammerstein’s widow liked to point out, “Jerome Kern wrote dum-dum-dum-dum, *my husband* wrote ‘Ol’ Man River'” — an important distinction we need to bear in mind when talking about songwriters who write music but not lyrics). The second is that when he was five years old that music-loving father drowned — and Garcia would always say he had seen his father dying, though some sources claim this was a false memory. So it goes. And the third fact, which for some reason is always told after the second even though it comes before it chronologically, is that when he was four he lost two joints from his right middle finger.\n\nGarcia grew up a troubled teen, and in turn caused trouble for other people, but he also developed a few interests that would follow him through his life. He loved the fantastical, especially the fantastical macabre, and became an avid fan of horror and science fiction — and through his love of old monster films he became enamoured with cinema more generally. Indeed, in 1983 he bought the film rights to Kurt Vonnegut’s science fiction novel The Sirens of Titan, the first story in which the Tralfamadorians appear, and wrote a script based on it. He wanted to produce the film himself, with Francis Ford Coppola directing and Bill Murray starring, but most importantly for him he wanted to prevent anyone who didn’t care about it from doing it badly. And in that he succeeded. As of 2023 there is no film of The Sirens of Titan.\n\nHe loved to paint, and would continue that for the rest of his life, with one of his favourite subjects being Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster. And when he was eleven or twelve, he heard for the first time a record that was hugely influential to a whole generation of Californian musicians, even though it was a New York record — “Gee” by the Crows:\n\n[Excerpt: The Crows, “Gee”]\n\nGarcia would say later “That was an important song. That was the first kind of, like where the voices had that kind of not-trained-singer voices, but tough-guy-on-the-street voice.”\n\nThat record introduced him to R&B, and soon he was listening to Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley, to Ray Charles, and to a record we’ve not talked about in the podcast but which was one of the great early doo-wop records, “WPLJ” by the Four Deuces:\n\n[Excerpt: The Four Deuces, “WPLJ”]\n\nGarcia said of that record “That was one of my anthem songs when I was in junior high school and high school and around there. That was one of those songs everybody knew. And that everybody sang. Everybody sang that street-corner favorite.”\n\nGarcia moved around a lot as a child, and didn’t have much time for school by his own account, but one of the few teachers he did respect was an art teacher when he was in North Beach, Walter Hedrick. Hedrick was also one of the earliest of the conceptual artists, and one of the most important figures in the San Francisco arts scene that would become known as the Beat Generation (or the Beatniks, which was originally a disparaging term). Hedrick was a painter and sculptor, but also organised happenings, and he had also been one of the prime movers in starting a series of poetry readings in San Francisco, the first one of which had involved Allen Ginsberg giving the first ever reading of “Howl” — one of a small number of poems, along with Eliot’s “Prufrock” and “The Waste Land” and possibly Pound’s Cantos, which can be said to have changed twentieth-century literature.\n\nGarcia was fifteen when he got to know Hedrick, in 1957, and by then the Beat scene had already become almost a parody of itself, having become known to the public because of the publication of works like On the Road, and the major artists in the scene were already rejecting the label. By this point tourists were flocking to North Beach to see these beatniks they’d heard about on TV, and Hedrick was actually employed by one cafe to sit in the window wearing a beret, turtleneck, sandals, and beard, and draw and paint, to attract the tourists who flocked by the busload because they could see that there was a “genuine beatnik” in the cafe.\n\nHedrick was, as well as a visual artist, a guitarist and banjo player who played in traditional jazz bands, and he would bring records in to class for his students to listen to, and Garcia particularly remembered him bringing in records by Big Bill Broonzy:\n\n[Excerpt: Big Bill Broonzy, “When Things Go Wrong (It Hurts Me Too)”]\n\nGarcia was already an avid fan of rock and roll music, but it was being inspired by Hedrick that led him to get his first guitar. Like his contemporary Paul McCartney around the same time, he was initially given the wrong instrument as a birthday present — in Garcia’s case his mother gave him an accordion — but he soon persuaded her to swap it for an electric guitar he saw in a pawn shop.\n\nAnd like his other contemporary, John Lennon, Garcia initially tuned his instrument incorrectly. He said later “When I started playing the guitar, believe me, I didn’t know anybody that played. I mean, I didn’t know anybody that played the guitar. Nobody. They weren’t around. There were no guitar teachers. You couldn’t take lessons. There was nothing like that, you know? When I was a kid and I had my first electric guitar, I had it tuned wrong and learned how to play on it with it tuned wrong for about a year. And I was getting somewhere on it, you know… Finally, I met a guy that knew how to tune it right and showed me three chords, and it was like a revelation. You know what I mean? It was like somebody gave me the key to heaven.”\n\nHe joined a band, the Chords, which mostly played big band music, and his friend Gary Foster taught him some of the rudiments of playing the guitar — things like how to use a capo to change keys. But he was always a rebellious kid, and soon found himself faced with a choice between joining the military or going to prison. He chose the former, and it was during his time in the Army that a friend, Ron Stevenson, introduced him to the music of Merle Travis, and to Travis-style guitar picking:\n\n[Excerpt: Merle Travis, “Nine-Pound Hammer”]\n\nGarcia had never encountered playing like that before, but he instantly recognised that Travis, and Chet Atkins who Stevenson also played for him, had been an influence on Scotty Moore. He started to realise that the music he’d listened to as a teenager was influenced by music that went further back.\n\nBut Stevenson, as well as teaching Garcia some of the rudiments of Travis-picking, also indirectly led to Garcia getting discharged from the Army. Stevenson was not a well man, and became suicidal. Garcia decided it was more important to keep his friend company and make sure he didn’t kill himself than it was to turn up for roll call, and as a result he got discharged himself on psychiatric grounds — according to Garcia he told the Army psychiatrist “I was involved in stuff that was more important to me in the moment than the army was and that was the reason I was late” and the psychiatrist thought it was neurotic of Garcia to have his own set of values separate from that of the Army.\n\nAfter discharge, Garcia did various jobs, including working as a transcriptionist for Lenny Bruce, the comedian who was a huge influence on the counterculture. In one of the various attacks over the years by authoritarians on language, Bruce was repeatedly arrested for obscenity, and in 1961 he was arrested at a jazz club in North Beach. Sixty years ago, the parts of speech that were being criminalised weren’t pronouns, but prepositions and verbs:\n\n[Excerpt: Lenny Bruce, “To is a Preposition, Come is a Verb”]\n\nThat piece, indeed, was so controversial that when Frank Zappa quoted part of it in a song in 1968, the record label insisted on the relevant passage being played backwards so people couldn’t hear such disgusting filth:\n\n[Excerpt: The Mothers of Invention, “Harry You’re a Beast”]\n\n(Anyone familiar with that song will understand that the censored portion is possibly the least offensive part of the whole thing).\n\nBruce was facing trial, and he needed transcripts of what he had said in his recordings to present in court.\n\nIncidentally, there seems to be some confusion over exactly which of Bruce’s many obscenity trials Garcia became a transcriptionist for. Dennis McNally says in his biography of the band, published in 2002, that it was the most famous of them, in autumn 1964, but in a later book, Jerry on Jerry, a book of interviews of Garcia edited by McNally, McNally talks about it being when Garcia was nineteen, which would mean it was Bruce’s first trial, in 1961. We can put this down to the fact that many of the people involved, not least Garcia, lived in Tralfamadorian time, and were rather hazy on dates, but I’m placing the story here rather than in 1964 because it seems to make more sense that Garcia would be involved in a trial based on an incident in San Francisco than one in New York.\n\nGarcia got the job, even though he couldn’t type, because by this point he’d spent so long listening to recordings of old folk and country music that he was used to transcribing indecipherable accents, and often, as Garcia would tell it, Bruce would mumble very fast and condense multiple syllables into one. Garcia was particularly impressed by Bruce’s ability to improvise but talk in entire paragraphs, and he compared his use of language to bebop.\n\nAnother thing that was starting to impress Garcia, and which he also compared to bebop, was bluegrass:\n\n[Excerpt: Bill Monroe, “Fire on the Mountain”]\n\nBluegrass is a music that is often considered very traditional, because it’s based on traditional songs and uses acoustic instruments, but in fact it was a terribly *modern* music, and largely a postwar creation of a single band — Bill Monroe and his Blue Grass Boys. And Garcia was right when he said it was “white bebop” — though he did say “The only thing it doesn’t have is the harmonic richness of bebop. You know what I mean? That’s what it’s missing, but it has everything else.”\n\nBoth bebop and bluegrass evolved after the second world war, though they were informed by music from before it, and both prized the ability to improvise, and technical excellence. Both are musics that involved playing *fast*, in an ensemble, and being able to respond quickly to the other musicians. Both musics were also intensely rhythmic, a response to a faster paced, more stressful world. They were both part of the general change in the arts towards immediacy that we looked at in the last episode with the creation first of expressionism and then of pop art.\n\nBluegrass didn’t go into the harmonic explorations that modern jazz did, but it was absolutely as modern as anything Charlie Parker was doing, and came from the same impulses. It was tradition and innovation, the past and the future simultaneously. Bill Monroe, Jackson Pollock, Charlie Parker, Jack Kerouac, and Lenny Bruce were all in their own ways responding to the same cultural moment, and it was that which Garcia was responding to.\n\nBut he didn’t become able to play bluegrass until after a tragedy which shaped his life even more than his father’s death had.\n\nGarcia had been to a party and was in a car with his friends Lee Adams, Paul Speegle, and Alan Trist. Adams was driving at ninety miles an hour when they hit a tight curve and crashed. Garcia, Adams, and Trist were all severely injured but survived. Speegle died. So it goes.\n\nThis tragedy changed Garcia’s attitudes totally. Of all his friends, Speegle was the one who was most serious about his art, and who treated it as something to work on. Garcia had always been someone who fundamentally didn’t want to work or take any responsibility for anything. And he remained that way — except for his music. Speegle’s death changed Garcia’s attitude to that, totally. If his friend wasn’t going to be able to practice his own art any more, Garcia would practice his, in tribute to him. He resolved to become a virtuoso on guitar and banjo.\n\nHis girlfriend of the time later said “I don’t know if you’ve spent time with someone rehearsing ‘Foggy Mountain Breakdown’ on a banjo for eight hours, but Jerry practiced endlessly. He really wanted to excel and be the best. He had tremendous personal ambition in the musical arena, and he wanted to master whatever he set out to explore. Then he would set another sight for himself. And practice another eight hours a day of new licks.”\n\nBut of course, you can’t make ensemble music on your own:\n\n[Excerpt: Jerry Garcia and Bob Hunter, “Oh Mary Don’t You Weep” (including end)]\n\n“Evelyn said, “What is it called when a person needs a … person … when you want to be touched and the … two are like one thing and there isn’t anything else at all anywhere?”\n\nAlicia, who had read books, thought about it. “Love,” she said at length.”\n\nThat’s from More Than Human, by Theodore Sturgeon, a book I’ll be quoting a few more times as the story goes on.\n\nRobert Hunter, like Garcia, was just out of the military — in his case, the National Guard — and he came into Garcia’s life just after Paul Speegle had left it. Garcia and Alan Trist met Hunter ten days after the accident, and the three men started hanging out together, Trist and Hunter writing while Garcia played music.\n\nGarcia and Hunter both bonded over their shared love for the beats, and for traditional music, and the two formed a duo, Bob and Jerry, which performed together a handful of times. They started playing together, in fact, after Hunter picked up a guitar and started playing a song and halfway through Garcia took it off him and finished the song himself.\n\nThe two of them learned songs from the Harry Smith Anthology — Garcia was completely apolitical, and only once voted in his life, for Lyndon Johnson in 1964 to keep Goldwater out, and regretted even doing that, and so he didn’t learn any of the more political material people like Pete Seeger, Phil Ochs, and Bob Dylan were doing at the time — but their duo only lasted a short time because Hunter wasn’t an especially good guitarist.\n\nHunter would, though, continue to jam with Garcia and other friends, sometimes playing mandolin, while Garcia played solo gigs and with other musicians as well, playing and moving round the Bay Area and performing with whoever he could:\n\n[Excerpt: Jerry Garcia, “Railroad Bill”]\n\n“Bleshing, that was Janie’s word. She said Baby told it to her. She said it meant everyone all together being something, even if they all did different things. Two arms, two legs, one body, one head, all working together, although a head can’t walk and arms can’t think. Lone said maybe it was a mixture of “blending” and “meshing,” but I don’t think he believed that himself. It was a lot more than that.”\n\nThat’s from More Than Human\n\nIn 1961, Garcia and Hunter met another young musician, but one who was interested in a very different type of music. Phil Lesh was a serious student of modern classical music, a classically-trained violinist and trumpeter whose interest was solidly in the experimental and whose attitude can be summed up by a story that’s always told about him meeting his close friend Tom Constanten for the first time. Lesh had been talking with someone about serialism, and Constanten had interrupted, saying “Music stopped being created in 1750 but it started again in 1950”. Lesh just stuck out his hand, recognising a kindred spirit.\n\nLesh and Constanten were both students of Luciano Berio, the experimental composer who created compositions for magnetic tape:\n\n[Excerpt: Luciano Berio, “Momenti”]\n\nBerio had been one of the founders of the Studio di fonologia musicale di Radio Milano, a studio for producing contemporary electronic music where John Cage had worked for a time, and he had also worked with the electronic music pioneer Karlheinz Stockhausen. Lesh would later remember being very impressed when Berio brought a tape into the classroom — the actual multitrack tape for Stockhausen’s revolutionary piece Gesang Der Juenglinge:\n\n[Excerpt: Karlheinz Stockhausen, “Gesang Der Juenglinge”]\n\nLesh at first had been distrustful of Garcia — Garcia was charismatic and had followers, and Lesh never liked people like that. But he was impressed by Garcia’s playing, and soon realised that the two men, despite their very different musical interests, had a lot in common. Lesh was interested in the technology of music as well as in performing and composing it, and so when he wasn’t studying he helped out by engineering at the university’s radio station.\n\nLesh was impressed by Garcia’s playing, and suggested to the presenter of the station’s folk show, the Midnight Special, that Garcia be a guest. Garcia was so good that he ended up getting an entire solo show to himself, where normally the show would feature multiple acts. Lesh and Constanten soon moved away from the Bay Area to Las Vegas, but both would be back — in Constanten’s case he would form an experimental group in San Francisco with their fellow student Steve Reich, and that group (though not with Constanten performing) would later premiere Terry Riley’s In C, a piece influenced by La Monte Young and often considered one of the great masterpieces of minimalist music.\n\nBy early 1962 Garcia and Hunter had formed a bluegrass band, with Garcia on guitar and banjo and Hunter on mandolin, and a rotating cast of other musicians including Ken Frankel, who played banjo and fiddle. They performed under different names, including the Tub Thumpers, the Hart Valley Drifters, and the Sleepy Valley Hog Stompers, and played a mixture of bluegrass and old-time music — and were very careful about the distinction:\n\n[Excerpt: The Hart Valley Drifters, “Cripple Creek”]\n\nIn 1993, the Republican political activist John Perry Barlow was invited to talk to the CIA about the possibilities open to them with what was then called the Information Superhighway. He later wrote, in part “They told me they’d brought Steve Jobs in a few weeks before to indoctrinate them in modern information management. And they were delighted when I returned later, bringing with me a platoon of Internet gurus, including Esther Dyson, Mitch Kapor, Tony Rutkowski, and Vint Cerf. They sealed us into an electronically impenetrable room to discuss the radical possibility that a good first step in lifting their blackout would be for the CIA to put up a Web site… We told them that information exchange was a barter system, and that to receive, one must also be willing to share. This was an alien notion to them. They weren’t even willing to share information among themselves, much less the world.”\n\n1962 brought a new experience for Robert Hunter. Hunter had been recruited into taking part in psychological tests at Stanford University, which in the sixties and seventies was one of the preeminent universities for psychological experiments. As part of this, Hunter was given $140 to attend the VA hospital (where a janitor named Ken Kesey, who had himself taken part in a similar set of experiments a couple of years earlier, worked a day job while he was working on his first novel) for four weeks on the run, and take different psychedelic drugs each time, starting with LSD, so his reactions could be observed.\n\n(It was later revealed that these experiments were part of a CIA project called MKUltra, designed to investigate the possibility of using psychedelic drugs for mind control, blackmail, and torture. Hunter was quite lucky in that he was told what was going to happen to him and paid for his time. Other subjects included the unlucky customers of brothels the CIA set up as fronts — they dosed the customers’ drinks and observed them through two-way mirrors. Some of their experimental subjects died by suicide as a result of their experiences. So it goes. )\n\nHunter was interested in taking LSD after reading Aldous Huxley’s writings about psychedelic substances, and he brought his typewriter along to the experiment. During the first test, he wrote a six-page text, a short excerpt from which is now widely quoted, reading in part “Sit back picture yourself swooping up a shell of purple with foam crests of crystal drops soft nigh they fall unto the sea of morning creep-very-softly mist … and then sort of cascade tinkley-bell-like (must I take you by the hand, ever so slowly type) and then conglomerate suddenly into a peal of silver vibrant uncomprehendingly, blood singingly, joyously resounding bells”\n\nHunter’s experience led to everyone in their social circle wanting to try LSD, and soon they’d all come to the same conclusion — this was something special.\n\nBut Garcia needed money — he’d got his girlfriend pregnant, and they’d married (this would be the first of several marriages in Garcia’s life, and I won’t be covering them all — at Garcia’s funeral, his second wife, Carolyn, said Garcia always called her the love of his life, and his first wife and his early-sixties girlfriend who he proposed to again in the nineties both simultaneously said “He said that to me!”). So he started teaching guitar at a music shop in Palo Alto. Hunter had no time for Garcia’s incipient domesticity and thought that his wife was trying to make him live a conventional life, and the two drifted apart somewhat, though they’d still play together occasionally.\n\nThrough working at the music store, Garcia got to know the manager, Troy Weidenheimer, who had a rock and roll band called the Zodiacs. Garcia joined the band on bass, despite that not being his instrument. He later said “Troy was a lot of fun, but I wasn’t good enough a musician then to have been able to deal with it. I was out of my idiom, really, ’cause when I played with Troy I was playing electric bass, you know. I never was a good bass player. Sometimes I was playing in the wrong key and didn’t even [fuckin’] know it. I couldn’t hear that low, after playing banjo, you know, and going to electric…But Troy taught me the principle of, hey, you know, just stomp your foot and get on it. He was great. A great one for the instant arrangement, you know. And he was also fearless for that thing of get your friends to do it.”\n\nGarcia’s tenure in the Zodiacs didn’t last long, nor did this experiment with rock and roll, but two other members of the Zodiacs will be notable later in the story — the harmonica player, an old friend of Garcia’s named Ron McKernan, who would soon gain the nickname Pig Pen after the Peanuts character, and the drummer, Bill Kreutzmann:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Drums/Space (Skull & Bones version)”]\n\nKreutzmann said of the Zodiacs “Jerry was the hired bass player and I was the hired drummer. I only remember playing that one gig with them, but I was in way over my head. I always did that. I always played things that were really hard and it didn’t matter. I just went for it.”\n\nGarcia and Kreutzmann didn’t really get to know each other then, but Garcia did get to know someone else who would soon be very important in his life.\n\nBob Weir was from a very different background than Garcia, though both had the shared experience of long bouts of chronic illness as children. He had grown up in a very wealthy family, and had always been well-liked, but he was what we would now call neurodivergent — reading books about the band he talks about being dyslexic but clearly has other undiagnosed neurodivergences, which often go along with dyslexia — and as a result he was deemed to have behavioural problems which led to him getting expelled from pre-school and kicked out of the cub scouts.\n\nHe was never academically gifted, thanks to his dyslexia, but he was always enthusiastic about music — to a fault. He learned to play boogie piano but played so loudly and so often his parents sold the piano. He had a trumpet, but the neighbours complained about him playing it outside. Finally he switched to the guitar, an instrument with which it is of course impossible to make too loud a noise. The first song he learned was the Kingston Trio’s version of an old sea shanty, “The Wreck of the John B”:\n\n[Excerpt: The Kingston Trio, “The Wreck of the John B”]\n\nHe was sent off to a private school in Colorado for teenagers with behavioural issues, and there he met the boy who would become his lifelong friend, John Perry Barlow. Unfortunately the two troublemakers got on with each other *so* well that after their first year they were told that it was too disruptive having both of them at the school, and only one could stay there the next year. Barlow stayed and Weir moved back to the Bay Area.\n\nBy this point, Weir was getting more interested in folk music that went beyond the commercial folk of the Kingston Trio. As he said later “There was something in there that was ringing my bells. What I had grown up thinking of as hillbilly music, it started to have some depth for me, and I could start to hear the music in it. Suddenly, it wasn’t just a bunch of ignorant hillbillies playing what they could. There was some depth and expertise and stuff like that to aspire to.”\n\nHe moved from school to school but one thing that stayed with him was his love of playing guitar, and he started taking lessons from Troy Weidenheimer, but he got most of his education going to folk clubs and hootenannies. He regularly went to the Tangent, a club where Garcia played, but Garcia’s bluegrass banjo playing was far too rigorous for a free spirit like Weir to emulate, and instead he started trying to copy one of the guitarists who was a regular there, Jorma Kaukonnen.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve 1963 Weir was out walking with his friends Bob Matthews and Rich Macauley, and they passed the music shop where Garcia was a teacher, and heard him playing his banjo. They knocked and asked if they could come in — they all knew Garcia a little, and Bob Matthews was one of his students, having become interested in playing banjo after hearing the theme tune to the Beverly Hillbillies, played by the bluegrass greats Flatt and Scruggs:\n\n[Excerpt: Flatt and Scruggs, “The Beverly Hillbillies”]\n\nGarcia at first told these kids, several years younger than him, that they couldn’t come in — he was waiting for his students to show up. But Weir said “Jerry, listen, it’s seven-thirty on New Year’s Eve, and I don’t think you’re going to be seeing your students tonight.”\n\nGarcia realised the wisdom of this, and invited the teenagers in to jam with him. At the time, there was a bit of a renaissance in jug bands, as we talked about back in the episode on the Lovin’ Spoonful. This was a form of music that had grown up in the 1920s, and was similar and related to skiffle and coffee-pot bands — jug bands would tend to have a mixture of portable string instruments like guitars and banjos, harmonicas, and people using improvised instruments, particularly blowing into a jug. The most popular of these bands had been Gus Cannon’s Jug Stompers, led by banjo player Gus Cannon and with harmonica player Noah Lewis:\n\n[Excerpt: Gus Cannon’s Jug Stompers, “Viola Lee Blues”]\n\nWith the folk revival, Cannon’s work had become well-known again. The Rooftop Singers, a Kingston Trio style folk group, had had a hit with his song “Walk Right In” in 1963, and as a result of that success Cannon had even signed a record contract with Stax — Stax’s first album ever, a month before Booker T and the MGs’ first album, was in fact the eighty-year-old Cannon playing his banjo and singing his old songs.\n\nThe rediscovery of Cannon had started a craze for jug bands, and the most popular of the new jug bands was Jim Kweskin’s Jug Band, which did a mixture of old songs like “You’re a Viper” and more recent material redone in the old style. Weir, Matthews, and Macauley had been to see the Kweskin band the night before, and had been very impressed, especially by their singer Maria D’Amato — who would later marry her bandmate Geoff Muldaur and take his name — and her performance of Leiber and Stoller’s “I’m a Woman”:\n\n[Excerpt: Jim Kweskin’s Jug Band, “I’m a Woman”]\n\nMatthews suggested that they form their own jug band, and Garcia eagerly agreed — though Matthews found himself rapidly moving from banjo to washboard to kazoo to second kazoo before realising he was surplus to requirements. Robert Hunter was similarly an early member but claimed he “didn’t have the embouchure” to play the jug, and was soon also out. He moved to LA and started studying Scientology — later claiming that he wanted science-fictional magic powers, which L. Ron Hubbard’s new religion certainly offered.\n\nThe group took the name Mother McRee’s Uptown Jug Champions — apparently they varied the spelling every time they played — and had a rotating membership that at one time or another included about twenty different people, but tended always to have Garcia on banjo, Weir on jug and later guitar, and Garcia’s friend Pig Pen on harmonica:\n\n[Excerpt: Mother McRee’s Uptown Jug Champions, “On the Road Again”]\n\nThe group played quite regularly in early 1964, but Garcia’s first love was still bluegrass, and he was trying to build an audience with his bluegrass band, The Black Mountain Boys. But bluegrass was very unpopular in the Bay Area, where it was simultaneously thought of as unsophisticated — as “hillbilly music” — and as elitist, because it required actual instrumental ability, which wasn’t in any great supply in the amateur folk scene. But instrumental ability was something Garcia definitely had, as at this point he was still practising eight hours a day, every day, and it shows on the recordings of the Black Mountain Boys:\n\n[Excerpt: The Black Mountain Boys, “Rosa Lee McFall”]\n\nBy the summer, Bob Weir was also working at the music shop, and so Garcia let Weir take over his students while he and the Black Mountain Boys’ guitarist Sandy Rothman went on a road trip to see as many bluegrass musicians as they could and to audition for Bill Monroe himself. As it happened, Garcia found himself too shy to audition for Monroe, but Rothman later ended up playing with Monroe’s Blue Grass Boys.\n\nOn his return to the Bay Area, Garcia resumed playing with the Uptown Jug Champions, but Pig Pen started pestering him to do something different. While both men had overlapping tastes in music and a love for the blues, Garcia’s tastes had always been towards the country end of the spectrum while Pig Pen’s were towards R&B. And while the Uptown Jug Champions were all a bit disdainful of the Beatles at first — apart from Bob Weir, the youngest of the group, who thought they were interesting — Pig Pen had become enamoured of another British band who were just starting to make it big:\n\n[Excerpt: The Rolling Stones, “Not Fade Away”]\n\n29) Garcia liked the first Rolling Stones album too, and he eventually took Pig Pen’s point — the stuff that the Rolling Stones were doing, covers of Slim Harpo and Buddy Holly, was not a million miles away from the material they were doing as Mother McRee’s Uptown Jug Champions. Pig Pen could play a little electric organ, Bob had been fooling around with the electric guitars in the music shop. Why not give it a go? The stuff bands like the Rolling Stones were doing wasn’t that different from the electric blues that Pig Pen liked, and they’d all seen A Hard Day’s Night — they could carry on playing with banjos, jugs, and kazoos and have the respect of a handful of folkies, or they could get electric instruments and potentially have screaming girls and millions of dollars, while playing the same songs.\n\nThis was a convincing argument, especially when Dana Morgan Jr, the son of the owner of the music shop, told them they could have free electric instruments if they let him join on bass. Morgan wasn’t that great on bass, but what the hell, free instruments.\n\nPig Pen had the best voice and stage presence, so he became the frontman of the new group, singing most of the leads, though Jerry and Bob would both sing a few songs, and playing harmonica and organ. Weir was on rhythm guitar, and Garcia was the lead guitarist and obvious leader of the group. They just needed a drummer, and handily Bill Kreutzmann, who had played with Garcia and Pig Pen in the Zodiacs, was also now teaching music at the music shop. Not only that, but about three weeks before they decided to go electric, Kreutzmann had seen the Uptown Jug Champions performing and been astonished by Garcia’s musicianship and charisma, and said to himself “Man, I’m gonna follow that guy forever!”\n\nThe new group named themselves the Warlocks, and started rehearsing in earnest. Around this time, Garcia also finally managed to get some of the LSD that his friend Robert Hunter had been so enthusiastic about three years earlier, and it was a life-changing experience for him. In particular, he credited LSD with making him comfortable being a less disciplined player — as a bluegrass player he’d had to be frighteningly precise, but now he was playing rock and needed to loosen up.\n\nA few days after taking LSD for the first time, Garcia also heard some of Bob Dylan’s new material, and realised that the folk singer he’d had little time for with his preachy politics was now making electric music that owed a lot more to the Beat culture Garcia considered himself part of:\n\n[Excerpt: Bob Dylan, “Subterranean Homesick Blues”]\n\nAnother person who was hugely affected by hearing that was Phil Lesh, who later said “I couldn’t believe that was Bob Dylan on AM radio, with an electric band. It changed my whole consciousness: if something like that could happen, the sky was the limit.”\n\nUp to that point, Lesh had been focused entirely on his avant-garde music, working with friends like Steve Reich to push music forward, inspired by people like John Cage and La Monte Young, but now he realised there was music of value in the rock world. He’d quickly started going to rock gigs, seeing the Rolling Stones and the Byrds, and then he took acid and went to see his friend Garcia’s new electric band play their third ever gig. He was blown away, and very quickly it was decided that Lesh would be the group’s new bass player — though everyone involved tells a different story as to who made the decision and how it came about, and accounts also vary as to whether Dana Morgan took his sacking gracefully and let his erstwhile bandmates keep their instruments, or whether they had to scrounge up some new ones.\n\nLesh had never played bass before, but he was a talented multi-instrumentalist with a deep understanding of music and an ability to compose and improvise, and the repertoire the Warlocks were playing in the early days was mostly three-chord material that doesn’t take much rehearsal — though it was apparently beyond the abilities of poor Dana Morgan, who apparently had to be told note-by-note what to play by Garcia, and learn it by rote. Garcia told Lesh what notes the strings of a bass were tuned to, told him to borrow a guitar and practice, and within two weeks he was on stage with the Warlocks:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Grayfolded”]\n\nIn September 1995, just weeks after Jerry Garcia’s death, an article was published in Mute magazine identifying a cultural trend that had shaped the nineties, and would as it turned out shape at least the next thirty years. It’s titled “The Californian Ideology”, though it may be better titled “The Bay Area Ideology”, and it identifies a worldview that had grown up in Silicon Valley, based around the ideas of the hippie movement, of right-wing libertarianism, of science fiction authors, and of Marshall McLuhan.\n\nIt starts “There is an emerging global orthodoxy concerning the relation between society, technology and politics. We have called this orthodoxy `the Californian Ideology’ in honour of the state where it originated. By naturalising and giving a technological proof to a libertarian political philosophy, and therefore foreclosing on alternative futures, the Californian Ideologues are able to assert that social and political debates about the future have now become meaningless.\n\nThe California Ideology is a mix of cybernetics, free market economics, and counter-culture libertarianism and is promulgated by magazines such as WIRED and MONDO 2000 and preached in the books of Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly and others. The new faith has been embraced by computer nerds, slacker students, 30-something capitalists, hip academics, futurist bureaucrats and even the President of the USA himself. As usual, Europeans have not been slow to copy the latest fashion from America. While a recent EU report recommended adopting the Californian free enterprise model to build the ‘infobahn’, cutting-edge artists and academics have been championing the ‘post-human’ philosophy developed by the West Coast’s Extropian cult. With no obvious opponents, the global dominance of the Californian ideology appears to be complete.”\n\n[Excerpt: Grayfolded]\n\nThe Warlocks’ first gig with Phil Lesh on bass was on June the 18th 1965, at a club called Frenchy’s with a teenage clientele. Lesh thought his playing had been wooden and it wasn’t a good gig, and apparently the management of Frenchy’s agreed — they were meant to play a second night there, but turned up to be told they’d been replaced by a band with an accordion and clarinet.\n\nBut by September the group had managed to get themselves a residency at a small bar named the In Room, and playing there every night made them cohere. They were at this point playing the kind of sets that bar bands everywhere play to this day, though at the time the songs they were playing, like “Gloria” by Them and “In the Midnight Hour”, were the most contemporary of hits. Another song that they introduced into their repertoire was “Do You Believe in Magic” by the Lovin’ Spoonful, another band which had grown up out of former jug band musicians.\n\nAs well as playing their own sets, they were also the house band at The In Room and as such had to back various touring artists who were the headline acts. The first act they had to back up was Cornell Gunter’s version of the Coasters. Gunter had brought his own guitarist along as musical director, and for the first show Weir sat in the audience watching the show and learning the parts, staring intently at this musical director’s playing. After seeing that, Weir’s playing was changed, because he also picked up how the guitarist was guiding the band while playing, the small cues that a musical director will use to steer the musicians in the right direction. Weir started doing these things himself when he was singing lead — Pig Pen was the frontman but everyone except Bill sang sometimes — and the group soon found that rather than Garcia being the sole leader, now whoever was the lead singer for the song was the de facto conductor as well.\n\nBy this point, the Bay Area was getting almost overrun with people forming electric guitar bands, as every major urban area in America was. Some of the bands were even having hits already — We Five had had a number three hit with “You Were On My Mind”, a song which had originally been performed by the folk duo Ian and Sylvia:\n\n[Excerpt: We Five, “You Were On My Mind”]\n\nAlthough the band that was most highly regarded on the scene, the Charlatans, was having problems with the various record companies they tried to get signed to, and didn’t end up making a record until 1969. If tracks like “Number One” had been released in 1965 when they were recorded, the history of the San Francisco music scene may have taken a very different turn:\n\n[Excerpt: The Charlatans, “Number One”]\n\nBands like Jefferson Airplane, the Great Society, and Big Brother and the Holding Company were also forming, and Autumn Records was having a run of success with records by the Beau Brummels, whose records were produced by Autumn’s in-house A&R man, Sly Stone:\n\n[Excerpt: The Beau Brummels, “Laugh Laugh”]\n\nThe Warlocks were somewhat cut off from this, playing in a dive bar whose clientele was mostly depressed alcoholics. But the fact that they were playing every night for an audience that didn’t care much gave them freedom, and they used that freedom to improvise. Both Lesh and Garcia were big fans of John Coltrane, and they started to take lessons from his style of playing. When the group played “Gloria” or “Midnight Hour” or whatever, they started to extend the songs and give themselves long instrumental passages for soloing.\n\nGarcia’s playing wasn’t influenced *harmonically* by Coltrane — in fact Garcia was always a rather harmonically simple player. He’d tend to play lead lines either in Mixolydian mode, which is one of the most standard modes in rock, pop, blues, and jazz, or he’d play the notes of the chord that was being played, so if the band were playing a G chord his lead would emphasise the notes G, B, and D. But what he was influenced by was Coltrane’s tendency to improvise in long, complex, phrases that made up a single thought — Coltrane was thinking musically in paragraphs, rather than sentences, and Garcia started to try the same kind of thing.\n\nAnd under him Lesh was slowly starting to innovate in his bass playing. Lesh was also thinking in terms of Coltrane, but also of the way classical and baroque composers would use bass lines contrapuntally. Of all the band Lesh had the least knowledge of what the norms of popular music forms like rock and roll and blues were, and so his use of the bass inadvertently paralleled the moves being made by a lot of other bass players around this time, now that recording techniques were improving and allowing much better definition of bass sounds on record. Up to about 1965 the bass on rock and roll records was almost always playing very simple lines — at its most complicated it’d be something like a boogie walking bassline, but more often it would be the root and maybe fifth of the chord, simple whole notes dead on the beat, often locked in with the bass drum.\n\nLesh was one of the first bass players to start playing after people like James Jamerson, Paul McCartney, and Brian Wilson started coming up with more through-composed parts for rock music, and that became his natural idiom. What Lesh was doing was not what one might think of as conventional rhythm section work at all, and he would often syncopate his lines, only rarely coming in on the one of a bar as a normal bass player would, but often coming in half a beat later.\n\nThe group started to develop a conversational approach to performance, with the instrumentalists, especially Lesh and Garcia, entering into a dialogue with each other, all doing their own thing. They were particularly influenced by “Cleo’s Back” by Junior Walker and the All-Stars, a Motown instrumental, and it’s fascinating to listen to that record in this context. “Cleo’s Back” is clearly an attempt to replicate Stax records like “Green Onions”, but the Walker record has each of the musicians doing his own thing, rather than playing in tight lockstep. They’re all paying attention to the groove, but they’re riffing on it, coming in and out when they have something to say, playing off each other as if they all think they’re the star soloist but still somehow working as an ensemble:\n\n[Excerpt: Junior Walker & the All-Stars, “Cleo’s Back”]\n\nBy the time the Warlocks had finished their stint at the In Room, the San Francisco psychedelic rock scene had exploded, almost without the group realising it, and record companies were on the lookout. San Francisco was clearly the next big thing to exploit, and Autumn Records was right there. After Sly Stone had had hits with the Beau Brummels and minor success with the Mojo Men, they were on a bit of a high and were auditioning bands left and right. The recording of the Charlatans we heard earlier was from a session they did for Autumn that didn’t get released, and Sly Stone was just about to start work with the Great Society, but Stone was apparently not present when the Warlocks did their audition for the label in November 1965:\n\n[Excerpt: The Warlocks, “Can’t Come Down”]\n\nBut for that audition, the group actually performed under another name, The Emergency Crew, because Phil Lesh had been looking through records in a shop and found one by another group called the Warlocks. McNally in his biography suggests that this is likely the Warlocks who included two-thirds of ZZ Top, but as far as I can tell that band didn’t release a record until a few months after this. Nor of course is it the Velvet Underground, who never released a record under that name. There were, it turns out, a lot of bands who decided in the mid-sixties to call themselves The Warlocks — I’ve found evidence of at least ten, many of whom released singles.\n\nMy guess is that the record that Lesh had found was this one, an attempt by a band from Massachusetts to start a dance craze, released on Decca in June 1965. Lesh remembered the record he’d seen as being on Columbia, but otherwise this fits:\n\n[Excerpt: The Warlocks, “Temper Tantrum”]\n\nOddly, the B-side to that track was a cover of James Brown’s “I’ll Go Crazy”, which was a song that was also in the set of the Bay Area Warlocks.\n\nThe group got together in Phil Lesh’s house and started throwing out names. When nobody liked any of anyone else’s suggestions, they started thumbing through reference books — dictionaries, books of quotations, and so on — and eventually Garcia found what he and Lesh thought the perfect name, though Bob Weir wasn’t so keen.\n\nThe Grateful Dead is a motif from many folk stories throughout the world. To quote from Gordon Hall Gerould’s book on the subject: “A man finds a corpse lying unburied, and out of pure philanthropy procures interment for it at great personal inconvenience. Later he is met by the ghost of the dead man, who in many cases promises him help on condition of receiving, in return, half of whatever he gets. The hero obtains a wife (or some other reward), and, when called upon, is ready to fulfil his bargain as to sharing his possessions.”\n\nGerould identifies variants of this story all over the world, and sees it crop up as an element in many, many, stories. It exists in endless variations with no single canonical version, as so many folk stories and songs do.\n\nNone of the band knew much of this at the time, but Lesh in particular was so enthusiastic about the name that the matter was settled. The Warlocks were now the Grateful Dead:\n\n[Excerpt: “Grayfolded”]\n\nIn Kurt Vonnegut’s novel Cat’s Cradle, there’s a religion made up by a calypso singer named Bokonon, which includes a concept called a karass. To quote from the book “We Bokononists believe that humanity is organized into teams, teams that do God’s Will without ever discovering what they are doing. Such a team is called a karass by Bokonon”\n\nA karass doesn’t necessarily know it’s a karass — it’s a collection of people whose lives are intertwined in ways they will never fully understand.\n\nLater in the book he goes on to define another term: “A wampeter is the pivot of a karass. No karass is without a wampeter, Bokonon tells us, just as no wheel is without a hub. Anything can be a wampeter: a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail. Whatever it is, the members of its karass revolve about it in the majestic chaos of a spiral nebula. The orbits of the members of a karass about their common wampeter are spiritual orbits, naturally. It is souls and not bodies that revolve.”\n\nIn Vonnegut’s twice-fictional religion, there are always two wampeters for every karass, one waxing and one waning. And there’s no doubt that one of the wampeters around which the karass that encompassed the Grateful Dead at this time was revolving was Neal Cassady:\n\n[Excerpt: Bob Weir “Cassidy”]\n\nCassady is difficult to sum up, especially at a remove of nearly sixty years. He was a vital link between two different versions of the counterculture — the Beats of the fifties and the hippies of the sixties — and everyone who knew him talks about him as having been a great artist and a vital inspiration to them. He was regarded as a peer by Ken Kesey, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and Jerry Garcia.\n\nBut while Kesey and Kerouac’s art was their novels, Ginsberg’s was his poetry, and Garcia’s was his guitar playing — all things that one can point to and analyse and that exist as works of art, according to Garcia “Neal was a guy who was like an artist without an art. He was his art, you know?”\n\nHe meant that very literally. He said “If you’re doing something and eventually you’re doing it well enough to where there’s a flow to it, then you know when the flow is there and you know when it ain’t. And it’s that same thing. But like, most people do it the way I’ve done it—the way most conventional artists deal with it at that level is to take up a discipline, one specific thing, scope in on it, concentrate your energy on it, like an alchemist, and work on it and work on it, and that becomes the way of telling whether you’re on or not, and then all your energy goes into it.\n\nNeal’s way of doing that was to eliminate the tool, you know, even though he probably wasn’t conscious of it initially and used to envy that discipline. Eventually he became that whole thing—all of his surfaces, if you imagine human beings as having many surfaces, all of his surfaces were on that edge of on-ness and off-ness, and being conscious of whether you’re on or off. That whole thing of balancing on the end of a stepladder, you know, the kind of stuff that Neal could do. I mean, when he was on, he could really, because he worked at it, man. He spent a lot of the time doing it. Everybody else thought it was crazy weirdness, but he was working on it.”\n\nCassady had been a petty criminal for a great part of his youth, and had been arrested a number of times for car theft, shoplifting, and possession of stolen goods. But he was also mentored by a renowned educator, Justin Brierly, who saw potential in him. Through one of Brierly’s other students, after getting out of prison when he was nineteen he met Jack Kerouac, and the two travelled across the country on several occasions — with Cassady becoming the model for Dean Moriarty, the main character in Kerouac’s On The Road. Cassady asked Kerouac to teach him how to write, though he never finished a completed work in his lifetime, but according to many sources while Kerouac was teaching Cassady, Cassady was also teaching Kerouac, and the prose style which made Kerouac famous was in large part an imitation of Cassady’s style.\n\nIn 1962, Cassady read Ken Kesey’s novel One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest, and identified so strongly with the protagonist, Randle McMurphy, and his fight against a system that considers him insane and eventually breaks him, that he tracked down Kesey and the two became friends. By this time Kesey was a strong advocate for the use of LSD — not in controlled, experimental, safe conditions like those advocated by Timothy Leary at this point, but for general, uninhibited, recreational use.\n\nWhen in 1964 Kesey needed to travel to New York in connection with the publication of his second novel, he and Cassady and a group of other people, who dubbed themselves the Merry Pranksters, decided to make it a ritual event — they were going to retrace the East-West migration that had characterised white people’s journey in America, and do it backwards. They were going to go on the road, and bring West Coast weirdness to the heartlands and East Coast.\n\nThey got a bus, and painted it in psychedelic colours — and note that this is in June 1964, before even A Hard Day’s Night had come out, to give some perspective on where the general culture was at — and where the destination should be they simply wrote “Furthur” (spelled with a u instead of an e, apparently as a mistake, but taken as serendipity), and went out on the road.\n\nThey attempted to make a film of the journey, and they filmed extensive material. So extensive, indeed, that the task of going through it thoroughly became too great for the unassisted Kesey, and a film didn’t come out until 2011. But the Merry Pranksters’ journey and attempted film did, as the Tralfamadorians among you will know, become the inspiration for another film that was released:\n\n[Excerpt: The Beatles, “Magical Mystery Tour”]\n\nAfter this, Kesey’s home became something of a commune with various of the Pranksters often in attendance. In 1965 a young journalist named Hunter S. Thompson, working on a book about the Hells Angels motorcycle gang, decided that it might be interesting to bring them along to meet the Pranksters, and a party was thrown for the Angels at Kesey’s house, with Allen Ginsberg and Ram Dass also attending.\n\nThis went well enough that there started to be *weekly* parties organised by the Pranksters, and just after the Warlocks changed their name to the Grateful Dead, in November 1965, several of them attended one of these parties, where they took acid and had a great time with people like Kesey and Ginsberg.\n\nShortly after that, the Pranksters decided to do something a little bigger — they were going to turn their parties into full-blown Happenings, in the way we talked about last episode, and the Grateful Dead were going to be involved, providing music.\n\nPart of the reasoning for this was that the film that had been made of the road trip was clearly not yet ready, but they could show bits of it in these Happenings as essentially guerilla marketing, establishing an underground reputation for when it was finally released.\n\nThese Happenings were to be called Acid Tests, and the main way they were distinct from the other happenings we’ve talked about was that everyone involved would be on acid. Or at least, almost everyone — a small number never indulged, notably Pig Pen, whose drug of choice was always alcohol, not anything psychedelic.\n\nAt a typical one of these acid tests, the Grateful Dead would play their music, which from the few surviving recordings of them in 1966 was a mixture of fairly standard R&B:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “I’m a Hog For You Baby (acid test)”]\n\nAnd rather unformed psychedelic jamming:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Caution (Do Not Step on Tracks) (acid test)”]\n\nFilm of the Pranksters’ road trip would be shown, some of the Pranksters would make their own music (though they couldn’t play instruments), Kesey would write messages on slides which would be projected while the band were playing, and Neal Cassady would juggle hammers.\n\nAfter the first of the Acid Tests involving the Dead, they quickly found themselves with a team — co-managers Rock Scully, who they met at the Acid Test, and Danny Rifkin, and sound man Owsley Stanley, who became interested in doing the band’s sound after an acid trip in which he claimed he could see the patterns the sound was making and knew how to improve them.\n\nStanley was the first private individual in the world, outside industry and academia, to figure out how to synthesise his own LSD, and he used the money he made from this to help support the group in their career, buying equipment. He would also record all the group’s shows (and others he engineered) to check his own work back, and he kept almost all of these recordings, starting a practice that would lead to the Grateful Dead being the most exhaustively documented live act of the rock era.\n\nWithin two months of the first Acid Test the group found themselves playing to six thousand people at the Trips Festival, and they soon built up enough of a following that they actually decamped with the Pranksters to LA, spending two months there holding acid tests while working on original material and trying to get a little privacy as they worked out how to deal with their new followers.\n\nThey returned to San Francisco after a couple of months, thoroughly disillusioned with LA, and in July they released a single on the tiny San Francisco-based indie label Scorpio Records:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Don’t Ease Me In” (use single mix from YouTube as it has reverb)]\n\n“people still laugh about as much as they ever did, despite their shrunken brains. If a bunch of them are lying around on a beach, and one of them farts, everybody else laughs and laughs, just as people would have done a million years ago.”\n\nThat’s from Galapagos, by Kurt Vonnegut. The narrator in that novel is the son of Kilgore Trout, an unsuccessful and rather bad science fiction writer who appears in several of Vonnegut’s novels as an inspirational figure who writes mostly for himself and doesn’t really realise that he has any fans, let alone that some of his fans regard him as some sort of guru with great wisdom. There are two main models for Trout — one is Vonnegut’s friend Theodore Sturgeon, and the other is Vonnegut himself.\n\nWhile the Dead had been working on original material, they apparently chose not to record any — while both tracks on the single were credited to Garcia as songwriter on the label, they were actually traditional jug band songs that had been in their repertoire while they were still Mother McRee’s Uptown Jug Champions.\n\nThe single was only released in very limited quantities, but at least they had now actually made a record, even if the only place to buy a copy was the Psychedelic Shop on Haight Street.\n\nThe Grateful Dead by this point were just one of several bands in the Haight-Ashbury area, and not necessarily the most successful — that would be jefferson Airplane, who were actually releasing records, or maybe the Great Society. Or Quicksilver Messenger Service. Or the Charlatans. Or Big Brother and the Holding Company. All these bands were regularly playing sets around a local circuit, with two venues in particular standing out — the Avalon Ballroom, which was run by Chet Helms and the Family Dog commune, and the Fillmore, run by Bill Graham. The Avalon was a friendlier venue, and everyone liked Helms more, and it had a better light show, but Graham was a better businessman, the Fillmore had a better sound system — bought from Owsley during one of his periodic fallings-out with the Dead — and Graham was also more interested in putting on a wider variety of acts. Graham would listen to the musicians who played his venue, and would bring in outside acts that they suggested, and often juxtapose wildly different performers like the avant-garde jazz pianist Cecil Taylor and the Yardbirds. The reputation that Graham got was of someone who would rip off the artists who were performing for him, but was so good at business that they’d still end up better off than playing for anyone else.\n\nBy late 1966 the group were essentially living in two communes — Garcia, Weir, Pig Pen, their managers, and assorted girlfriends and roadies in a house on Ashbury, and Lesh and Kreutzmann and their partners a couple of blocks away (they’d originally lived with the others, but Lesh had soon bolted after having to share a room with Garcia, who snored very loudly). That wasn’t the only bodily function that was causing problems for the group. Weir had by this point given up on LSD — joining Pig Pen, who’d never used it — but while Pig Pen was drinking a bottle of whisky a day, Weir had given up in order to become healthier, and had taken up a vegetarian diet which led to a severe flatulence problem.\n\nThere were other issues starting to develop between Garcia and Weir as well. By this point a group of hippie anarchists called the Diggers had taken up residence in the area, and they were giving away free food, scrounged or stolen from local shops and cooked, as a combination of political act and performance art piece — anyone getting their free food had to step through a frame, because inspired by John Cage they thought that the act of putting a frame round something made it art.\n\nThe Diggers also insisted that music should be free, and that it belonged to the people who shouldn’t have to pay to get it. Garcia had some sympathy for this attitude, and the Dead would often play free shows, but he was also pragmatic enough to realise that if the Dead didn’t get paid for their work he’d have to get an actual job, which would be horrifying.\n\nThe way Garcia squared this was to insist that the group needed to get good enough to be *worth* paying, and this led to him pressuring Weir, who was the youngest of the band members and the least facile on his instrument. Weir decided he needed to figure out a way for a rhythm player to function in a band with a soloist who was inspired by John Coltrane, and eventually hit on the idea of, rather than looking to rhythm guitarists like Steve Cropper, as most musicians in his position would, listening to McCoy Tyner, the piano player in Coltrane’s quartet, and copying his style:\n\n[Excerpt: John Coltrane, “My Favorite Things”]\n\n“To be a successful creator you don’t need millions. You don’t need millions of dollars or millions of customers, millions of clients or millions of fans. To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans.\n\nA true fan is defined as a fan that will buy anything you produce. These diehard fans will drive 200 miles to see you sing; they will buy the hardback and paperback and audible versions of your book; they will purchase your next figurine sight unseen; they will pay for the “best-of” DVD version of your free youtube channel; they will come to your chef’s table once a month. If you have roughly a thousand of true fans like this (also known as super fans), you can make a living — if you are content to make a living but not a fortune.\n\nHere’s how the math works. You need to meet two criteria. First, you have to create enough each year that you can earn, on average, $100 profit from each true fan. That is easier to do in some arts and businesses than others, but it is a good creative challenge in every area because it is always easier and better to give your existing customers more, than it is to find new fans.\n\nSecond, you must have a direct relationship with your fans. That is, they must pay you directly. You get to keep all of their support, unlike the small percent of their fees you might get from a music label, publisher, studio, retailer, or other intermediate. If you keep the full $100 of each true fan, then you need only 1,000 of them to earn $100,000 per year. That’s a living for most folks.”\n\nThat’s from an essay called 1000 True Fans by Kevin Kelly, who along with Stewart Brand, one of the people who organised the Trips Festival, set up the early online community The WELL. Kelly later founded Wired magazine. The essay appears in Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers by Tim Ferris.\n\nIn late 1966 the Dead put out their first T-shirt, designed by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse who did the group’s early posters, which had an image of Pig Pen on it.\n\nThey also started to move away from their association with Kesey and the acid tests. The final break came when Kesey negotiated a plea bargain for some legal trouble, which involved him committing to doing a final acid test style show, but with a “don’t do acid any more, kids” type message. Kesey announced that the Dead would be playing this, without asking them, and on a night when they were booked to play elsewhere. They still considered doing it until one of the Pranksters told Danny Rifkin that the plan for the event was to play one last big prank and dose the entire audience with LSD. Unlike many in the Dead’s circle, Rifkin detested the idea of dosing people without their consent, and he was also worried that if the performance went ahead, Bill Graham, who was meant to be promoting it, would lose his promoter’s license. The group pulled out, and Kesey ended up doing a much smaller event.\n\nBy this point the Dead were a powerful live band, though very far from the style that they would become known for in later years. Listening to live recordings from the summer of 1966, they’re a conventional garage band, not a million miles away from other bands from the area like the Standells or the Count Five, though with a more imaginative guitarist than those bands:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Cream Puff War (live in Vancouver)”]\n\nAnd it was that powerful live band that Joe Smith of Warner Brothers Records came to see, after being informed that the San Francisco scene was ripe with potentially successful bands that they could pick up for bargain prices. Over the autumn, Warners negotiated a deal with the group for a ten thousand dollar advance, and assurances that they would be given a certain amount of special treatment. Rather than being put through their customary marketing machine, the label would treat them the way they treated country artists, giving them special marketing for their niche genre.\n\nSmith was very eager to get the Dead signed — other than the Everly Brothers, who were making great records but no longer having hits, Warners had few rock acts, and was mostly known for the artists on its Reprise subsidiary — a label that had been started by Frank Sinatra and still mostly had artists of Sinatra’s generation (plus the mildly successful teenpop band Dino, Desi, and Billy, two of whom were the sons of Sinatra’s celebrity friends).\n\nThey were trying desperately to build up a rock roster, and San Francisco was the obvious place to turn, since LA had already been picked clean — as we heard in the episode on “Heroes and Villains” they also bought up Autumn Records around this time and got Lenny Waronker, Van Dyke Parks and their circle to work with that label’s group of San Francisco artists.\n\nSmith said later of signing the Dead “That was one of the two or three most important signings in all those years. It changed the nature and opinion of the record company. We were out in front. It was important to indicate we were more than Dean Martin and Sinatra—that we were hip.”\n\nFor this reason they made another important concession, which would have a profound impact on the way the group’s sound evolved. The standard record contract at this time paid performers per song, and that made sense for a time when most songs were about two or three minutes long — you’d need at least ten songs to make up an album, and so bands were being incentivised to produce as many of those two or three minute pop songs as possible.\n\nBut the Grateful Dead liked to stretch out and play long solos, and Rock Scully had heard that there was another way to structure these contracts. He’d worked at the Monterey Jazz Festival, and there he’d heard that jazz musicians were paid by the minute of recording, not by the song, which was how they could afford to do those long exploratory improvisational tracks that could last an entire side of an album.\n\nScully insisted on this being the case for the Grateful Dead’s contract too, and Smith agreed.\n\nBy the time of the group’s first sessions for Warners, Garcia at least had some studio experience. As we heard in the episode on Jefferson Airplane, Garcia had been involved in the recording of their album Surrealistic Pillow, at least according to most participants, though the record’s producer always said he wasn’t involved.\n\nCertainly some tracks sound very much like they have Garcia playing on them:\n\n[Excerpt: Jefferson Airplane, “Today”]\n\nIn January 1967, the group made their first album. Garcia later said of it “At that time we had no real record consciousness. We were just going to go down to L.A. and make a record. We were completely naïve about it. We had a producer we had chosen because he’d been the engineer on a couple of Rolling Stones records that we liked the sound of; that was as much as we were into record-making.”\n\nDave Hassinger had definitely engineered a lot of Rolling Stones records — he’d been the group’s main US engineer for the run of hit singles and albums they’d had in the previous couple of years — but Garcia also knew him from working with Jefferson Airplane, as he’d engineered their album.\n\nHassinger was a super-competent engineer who had worked on everything from the TAMI Show to the Chipmunks’ album of Beatles covers, and he and Garcia had got on well. But Hassinger had only recently moved into production rather than engineering, and the rules of the studio they were working in meant that he had to use the studio’s staff engineer rather than do the job himself as he wanted, and as Hassinger himself said the band didn’t want to hear what a conventional producer had to say — they just went in and bashed out versions of their live set of the time, though as always they found themselves unable to let loose and improvise in the studio without the feedback of the audience. The first single, “The Golden Road (to Unlimited Devotion)”, failed to chart:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “The Golden Road (to Unlimited Devotion)”]\n\nThat track was actually recorded in San Francisco later, after the record company said they needed a single. Other than that, the album, which was just titled The Grateful Dead, only took four days to record, including the time spent mixing, and for the most part it sounds like any other pop album of the period — Bob Weir sounds spookily like Peter Tork at points. Despite Pig Pen being the band’s frontman and most popular member, he only gets one lead vocal, on the blues standard “Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl”, with the rest of the leads being shared between Garcia and Weir, but his keyboard is all over the album.\n\nAt this point, the group weren’t writing much of their own material, and other than the group composition “The Golden Road”, the only original is Garcia’s “Cream Puff War”, with everything else being standard folk-club material like Bonnie Dobson’s apocalyptic ballad “Morning Dew”:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Morning Dew”]\n\nor jug band material they’d been playing when they were still the Uptown Jug Champions, like “Viola Lee Blues”, originally written by Noah Lewis and performed by Gus Cannon’s Jug Stompers, which at just over ten minutes long was the only truly extended track on the album:\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Viola Lee Blues”]\n\nGarcia said at the time “I think our album is honest. It sounds just like us. It even has mistakes on it. But it also has a certain amount of excitement on it. It sounds like we felt good when we were making it. We made it in a short period—four days—and it’s the material we’d been doing onstage for quite a long time. It sounds like one of our good sets.”\n\nPhil Lesh, not really getting the hang of this promotion business, said in an interview at the time “I think it’s a turd.”\n\nThe album wasn’t a success, and only reached number sixty-nine on the album charts. But the group’s reputation as a live act was steadily improving. A couple of weeks before the studio dates they’d performed at the Human Be-In, a massive outdoor show in San Francisco with speeches from people like Timothy Leary and the political activist Jerry Rubin, food distributed for free by the Diggers (paid for by Owsley, who was also distributing the acid), security provided by the Hell’s Angels, and performances by Jefferson Airplane, Blue Cheer, and Big Brother and the Holding Company.\n\nTwenty thousand people turned up for that event, and they were all astonished to find that there were *that many* people in what they all thought of up to that point as a rather small scene. The gathering of that many people in one place to hear the new psychedelic music got the biggest national and international media exposure the San Francisco scene had ever had, and soon everything that wanted to be cool and hip had the suffix “-in”, in imitation of the Be-In — there were love-ins, Rowan and Martin’s Laugh-In on TV, and John Lennon and Yoko Ono having bed-ins.\n\nSoon San Francisco, and the Haight-Ashbury area, was once again being overrun by the kind of tourists who ten years earlier had come looking for beatniks, only this time they were looking for hippies, or trying to become hippies, as the Mothers of Invention would satirise the next year:\n\n[Excerpt: The Mothers of Invention, “Who Needs the Peace Corps?”]\n\nThe Human Be-In was also one of the precursors to the Monterey Pop Festival, which of course, as we talked about in episode 151, was only possible because the Grateful Dead persuaded the other San Francisco bands to play, and where of course the Dead played what they considered an incredibly sub-par show sandwiched between the Who and Jimi Hendrix, both of whom blew them off the stage. The Dead’s performance was so bad that none of it was used in the film. The Dead did, though, come out ahead from the show — apparently they stole the PA system.\n\n[Excerpt: The Grateful Dead, “Grayfolded”]\n\nThere is of course a reason that the Californian ideology became centred in California and developed in the way it did, and that reason is of course infrastructure.\n\nMany people who were influential on the Californian ideology, like the postmodernist science fiction writer Robert Anton Wilson, would argue that if you plotted a timeline of the most innovative people in human history, that timeline would slowly move west and slightly north, accelerating over the centuries, as the most radical thinkers followed the Sun, so in the last few centuries the greatest innovations had come from Greece, then Italy, then France, then England, then New York, and then finally the West Coast of the USA. According to Wilson and his friends like Timothy Leary, now that wave had finally reached the Pacific there was only one place left to go, and so humanity would fulfil its manifest destiny and head up into the stars.\n\nOther, less teleologically-minded, thinkers have suggested that the growth of that ideology had more to do with the fact that the Bay Area had… well, a bay. Which meant that it was a natural area for naval bases, and thus for much of the twentieth century a hub of military activity more generally. And this meant that when the US Government wanted to fund research into military technology — like rockets, or like the computer systems that would be needed to guide missiles, or like a communications network that would allow those computers to communicate, the Bay Area’s institutions of higher learning were the best places to turn to, and so places like Berkeley and Stanford got vast military research grants, and so became the cutting-edge institutions for those topics.\n\nAnd so Berkeley, for example, counts among its alumni Steve Wozniak, the co-founder of Apple, Gordon Moore, the semiconductor researcher who co-founded Intel and coined “Moore’s Law”, and Eric Schmidt, a software engineer who went on to become the CEO of Google; while Stanford produced seventeen of the forty-four winners of the Turing Award for computer science to date, and was also the place where in order “to exploit new computer technologies to meet the needs of military command and control against nuclear threats, achieve survivable control of US nuclear forces, and improve military tactical and management decision making” as the director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency put it, they developed what was then called ARPANET but later became known as the Internet — the first ever ARPANET message, the word “login”, was sent from CalTech to Stanford, though problems meant that only the first two letters arrived.\n\nSo many advances in computer science came out of the military-funded institutions in the Bay Area that soon corporations started building their own facilities there to hire all the bright young graduates, and Silicon Valley was built, starting with Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Centre, where basically every personal computing technology of the nineties was invented in the seventies.\n\nAnd so young men (and it was, sadly, almost all men, sexism in science and technology being what it is) flocked to the Bay Area to work with this cutting-edge technology. Many of these people were the kind of staggeringly bright, vaguely idealistic peo"
