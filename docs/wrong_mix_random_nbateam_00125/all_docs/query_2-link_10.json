        "text": "Channing Tatum is to star in the film adaptation of Joe Haldeman's sci-fi classic The Forever War.\n\nThe 35-year-old actor has signed up to appear in the Jon Spaihts-scripted movie, which has been the focus of a bidding war between Warner Bros. and Sony.\n\nWarner Bros. came out as the winners for the film adaptation after beating Sony to nab the script.\n\nThe film is based on the 1974 book, considered to be a classic for the sci-fi genre, and there is scope for Haldeman's books to be turned into a fully-fledged franchise, Deadline reports.\n\nChanning's casting comes shortly after it was revealed that a 'Jump Street' and 'Men In Black' crossover is in the works.\n\nIt would most likely see the Hollywood actor reunite with his co-star Jonah Hill, though it's unclear whether Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones or Josh Brolin will reprise their roles from the earlier movies.\n\nDetails of the eagerly-awaited new film were revealed in a series of leaked Sony emails, which also showed that a female-driven spin-off of 'Jump Street' is in the works.\n\nSony Pictures is reportedly trying to revamp the popular movie franchise by making a female-centric version of the comedy film.\n\nAdditionally, plans to make a '23 Jump Street' movie are also in motion following the success of the two earlier films, '21 Jump Street' and '22 Jump Street'."
