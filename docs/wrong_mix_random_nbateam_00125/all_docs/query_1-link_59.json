Astronomers have verified the last measurable prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity—vibrations in space-time. Converted to sound, these waves become a cosmic orchestra, allowing us to hear exploding stars, colliding black holes, rotating pulsars, and possibly even echoes from the Big Bang itself. Marcia Bartusiak chronicles the quest to build the world's most sensitive listening device, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and its historic detection of gravitational waves, revealing the brilliance, personalities, and luck required to start a new age of astronomy.\n\n​Critical Response\n\n\"an important, multifaceted scientific story to tell — part theoretical physics, part astronomy, part experimental physics, part engineering....Bartusiak is dream[y] in mood and...stately in tone.\" ​― James Ryerson, New York Times Sunday Book Review​\n\n\"Bartusiak provides a fascinating description of how the LIGO Scientific Collaboration first observed the gravitational waves from the merger of two black holes.

The weirdly alien notion of a space-time abyss from which nothing escapes—not even light—seemed to confound all logic. This engrossing book tells the story of the fierce black hole debates and the contributions of Einstein and Hawking and other leading thinkers who completely altered our view of the universe. Bartusiak shows how the black hole helped revive Einstein's greatest achievement, the general theory of relativity, after decades during which it had been pushed into the shadows. Not until astronomers discovered such surprising new phenomena as neutron stars and black holes did the once-sedate universe transform into an Einsteinian cosmos, filled with sources of titanic energy that can be understood only in the light of relativity. This book celebrates the hundredth anniversary of general relativity, uncovers how the black hole really got its name, and recounts the scientists' frustrating, exhilarating, and at times humorous battles over the acceptance of one of history's most dazzling ideas.\n\nCritical Response\n\n​\n\n\"Sparkling.....One of the delights of this witty book is seeing the many way physicists historically found to dismiss, deny and disdain black holes....What comes through so beautifully...is how theoretical physics is itself a dynamically evolving landscape.\" ― Margaret Wertheim, Washington Post\n\n\"Fear not; you don’t need an advanced degree to enjoy this entertaining tale of how black holes meandered their way from theoretical oddity into everyday consciousness....A beautiful case study in how scientific ideas grow through inspiration, thought and, finally, observation.\" ― Mike Brown, Wall Street Journal\n\n\"A fascinating account of how the scientific community came to embrace the idea of a black hole....Bartusiak's book excels in describing the open questions concerning black holes and the controversies surrounding future directions in black hole research.\" ― Privamyada Natarajan, The New York Review of Books\n\n\"A fascinating historical narrative...offering exceptionally vivid images of complex physical concepts as well as of the personalities who placed a central role....Bartusiak has done a valuable job in offering a lively, entertaining, and multifaceted picture of this subject...one of the most intriguing themes in the history of general relativity.\" ― Roberto Lalli, Isis, Journal of the History of Science Society\n\n\"Entirely engaging narrative...Superior science writing that deliver[s] a persistently fascinating portrait.\" — Kirkus Reviews (starred review)\n\n\"Black Hole is engaging and lively, weaving in personal drama...with a clear account of the underlying science.

Here is the watershed moment in our cosmic history, splendidly arising from the exceptional combination of human curiosity, intelligence, and enterprise.\n\nOn January 1, 1925, thirty-five-year-old Edwin Hubble announced findings that ultimately established that our universe was a thousand trillion times larger than previously believed, filled with myriad galaxies like our own. It was a realization that reshaped how humans understood their place in the cosmos. Six years later, continuing research by Hubble and others forced Albert Einstein to renounce his own cosmic model and finally accept the astonishing fact that the universe was not immobile but instead expanding. The story of these interwoven discoveries includes battles of will, clever insights, and wrong turns made by the early investigators in this great twentieth-century pursuit, from the luminaries (Einstein, Hubble, Harlow Shapley) to the lesser known: Henrietta Leavitt, who discovered the means to measure the vast dimensions of the cosmos…Vesto Slipher, the first and unheralded discoverer of the universe’s expansion... Georges Lemaître, the Jesuit priest who correctly interpreted Einstein’s theories in relation to the universe…Milton Humason, who, with only an eighth-grade education, became a world-renowned expert on galaxy motions...and others.\n\nCritical Response\n\n• “Bartusiak's intelligent and engaging book may well become the standard popular account.\" -- Joel Achenbach, Washington Post\n\n• \"…delivered with wit, clarity and occasional drama, Marcia Bartusiak's The Day We Found the Universe is a small wonder….A science writer of rare gifts…Bartusiak manages to convey the mind-bending complexity of the astronomers' task and the scope of the work while never losing sight of the human elements (fame, ego, pioneer spirit, competitive drive) that drive the pursuit.\" — Ben Cosgrove, San Francisco Chronicle\n\n• \"The Day We Found the Universe is an energetic, thoughtful, and original guide to that pivotal point in the history of cosmology. Bartusiak has perfect pitch in telling the story of that scientific discovery. Her deft biographical sketches breathe life into a large cast of characters who are normally skipped over in [textbooks]....It involves competition, cooperation, friendship, jealousy, loyalty, vanity, insight, missed opportunities, technical genius, and startling success....\" -- Harvard astronomer Robert Kirshner, Physics Today\n\n• \"…this tale is not about breakthroughs. It focuses on the dramatic insights, sidesteps and missed opportunities, persistence, pride and bits of luck that accompany the scientific process….Bartusiak's account never gets boring and never feels anticlimactic. Instead, moments of drama and intimacy make the reader forget…the final outcome: the Milky Way is merely one of many stellar collections in a vast universe.\" — Elizabeth Quill, Science News\n\n• “Bartusiak vividly tells the story behind the discovery that changed our cozy view of the universe….From the women ‘computers’ who analyzed stellar photographs for Harvard to Mars-mad Percival Lowell, Bartusiak reveals the vibrant beginnings of modern astronomy, along with all the dreams and fears, rivalries and triumphs, of those involved.” -- Publishers Weekly (starred review)\n\n• “Hardly a year passes without one paradigm shift or another in astronomy. But this progress pales in comparison to a brief period last century, the 1920s, when Edwin Hubble and others showed that the universe is not a placid place with our solar system at its center, but rather is an ever-expanding vastness of countless galaxies. With her trademark mix of meticulous research and vibrant prose, Bartusiak weaves these discoveries into a narrative equal to the excitement of that convulsive decade.” — Seed Magazine\n\n• “Bartusiak lovingly and meticulously traces the origins and development of a big idea....Her enjoyable book is an exhaustively researched exploration of both major and minor players....The International Astronomical Union and the United Nations declared this year the ‘International Year of Astronomy,’...Bartusiak's book would be a great way to celebrate.\" — Stephen Ornes, New Haven Review\n\n• “Peopled with a fascinating cast of characters...The Day We Found the Universe is a scientific thriller that brings to life the many scientists who laid the foundation for Hubble's groundbreaking accomplishments....A great read, for anyone who enjoys a compelling yarn.\" — Robert Scott, Montreal Gazette\n\n• \"Details regarding countless personalities...the interplay between them and the times in which they worked, make this story satisfying for anyone who wants to learn how science has uncovered...an almost unimaginably vast geography of the heavens.\" — Rich Heffern, National Catholic Reporter\n\n• “[A] fascinating and accessible book...” — Barbara Fisher, Boston Globe\n\n• \"Bartusiak chronicles the cosmic explorations that helped make [Edwin] Hubble a star. A journalist specializing in science, she knows how to cut to the chase.

Instead of collecting light waves or radio waves, these novel instruments will allow astronomers to at last place their hands upon the fabric of space-time and feel the very rhythms of the universe.\n\nThese vibrations in space-time—or gravity waves—are the last prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity yet to be observed directly. They are his unfinished symphony, waiting nearly a century to be heard. When they finally reveal themselves to astronomers, we will for the first time be able to hear the cymbal crashes from exploding stars, tune in to the periodic drumbeats from swiftly rotating pulsars, listen to the extended chirps from the merger of two black holes, and eavesdrop on the remnant echoes from the mighty jolt of the Big Bang itself.\n\nWhen Einstein introduced general relativity in 1915, it was hailed as a momentous conceptual achievement. Einstein attained celebrity status. But, once scientists verified what they could of the theory, given the scant experiments available at the time, general relativity became largely a theoretical curiosity. Now, after decades of technological advancement, general relativity is being tested with unprecedented accuracy. It even affects our everyday lives. Satellites used by both travelers and soldiers to peg their positions require constant corrections of Einsteinian precision. Meanwhile, the first gravity-wave \"telescopes\" are about to come alive.\n\nIn Einstein's Unfinished Symphony, Bartusiak captures the excitement as two gravity-wave observatories in Louisiana and Washington State, as well as others in Italy, Germany, Japan, and Australia, approach operation and physicists gear up to begin their work to register the long-predicted quakes in space-time. With each chapter, Bartusiak extends her musical metaphor in tracing the story of general relativity, from the time \"Maestro\" Einstein enters physics, through the \"Starlight Waltz\" of neutron stars twisting space-time around themselves, to the \"Dissonant Chords\" of controversy as physicists fight to get their radically new observatories approved, through the \"Finale\" as a worldwide endeavor in gravity-wave astronomy is launched.\n\nCritical Response\n\n• \"... Einstein's Unfinished Symphony is her best [book] yet....a gripping story about real people and real events that makes science come alive; if you want to know what happens at the cutting edge of research today, this is certainly a good place to find out.... Einstein's Unfinished Symphony gives you a ringside seat at what is likely to be the next great revolution in astronomy.\"\n\nJohn Gribbin, The Washington Post\n\n• \"In Einstein's Unfinished Symphony, Marcia Bartusiak tells the story of a discovery waiting to be made. The cutting edge of science is not about the completely unknown. It is found where we understand just enough to ask the right questions or build the right instrument. Bartusiak, a freelance science writer for many years, tells this story in a breezy but careful style that is informative and easy to read. And, she has quite a good story to tell, even aside from the purely scientific part. When a gravity wave is first detected, the reader of this book will feel like a participant in the great event.\"\n\nDavid Goodstein, The New York Times Book Review\n\n• \"...science writing at its best. Einstein's Unfinished Symphony is an excellent account of the struggle to detect gravitational waves....her interviews with the leading lights in the gravitational-wave community reveal that it takes huge amounts of ingenuity, optimism, and sheer pigheadedness to stay in the field.\"\n\nValerie Jamieson, The Times Higher Education Supplement\n\n• \"Einstein is hot this year ... cross-promotion of related titles will boost sales of this graceful little book about the mysterious subject. Bartusiak has been writing about gravity waves for more than a decade, and her familiarity with the search and the scientists involved results in a thorough, engrossing and valuable chronicle\"\n\nPublishers Weekly\n\n• \"Bartusiak does a grand job of highlighting the challenges involved in this staggeringly demanding project [and] has a gift for apt metaphors, talking evocatively of being able to detect the 'cymbal crashes' of exploding stars, the 'drumbeat' of a swiftly spinning pulsar and the 'glissando' of two black holes merging into one another. Best of all, Bartusiak gives a sense of the ebb and flow of confidence among scientists trying to hunt down gravitational waves. Governments have handed a small group of scientists hundreds of millions of dollars to build vast devices that have only a slim chance of detecting a phenomenon we already know exists. I came away from Bartusiak's nicely judged account of this awe-inspiring project feeling that as long as researchers still devote their lives to such long shots, and governments continue to fund them, there is still hope for the scientific enterprise.\"\n\nRobert Matthews, New Scientist\n\n• \"I found it harder to put down than some mystery novels....When the new field of gravitational-wave astronomy is born, you will appreciate not only the tremendous gambles in careers, taxpayer money, and engineering that went into its creation, but also the new baby's astonishing potential to change our view of the universe. This book really has no competition, nor does it need any.\"\n\nE. Sterl Phinney, Sky & Telescope\n\n• \"Veteran science writer Bartusiak spins this complicated technical subject into a riveting narrative....Her clear writing and thorough understanding of the science and personalities behind her topic make her book as absorbing as any film.\"\n\nScience News\n\n• \"This is epic storytelling....The narrative is direct and even understated, often resembling John McPhee at his lean best....It is uncertain when or if a detectable wave will be found, but like prospectors in search of gold, scientists endure. Showing this is how Bartusiak shows us that humanity, the mortal ego, is an element of science.\"\n\nJohn-Henry Doucette, The Virginian-Pilot\n\n• \"Einstein's Unfinished Symphony provides a delightful and clearly written survey of the physics, the hopes, and the fears of the gravity wave community. You do not need to be an expert in general relativity to appreciate Bartusiak's account, which anyone with a basic grounding in science will benefit from, and enjoy, reading.\"\n\nMatt Visser, Science\n\n• \"The route to LIGO was long and checkered; it is beautifully recounted by Marcia Bartusiak in her latest book, Einstein's Unfinished Symphony. Bartusiak is a distinguished science journalist with a reputation for detail and accuracy, and her new book is no exception. She has clearly made a great effort to interview all major players in the field, scan the literature, and capture the relevant science. What results is an easy-to-read and clear exposition....\"\n\nLawrence M. Krauss, Physics Today\n\n• \"...Marcia Bartusiak is our guide on an intriguing scientific quest spanning nearly a century. Much more than a museum tour, this is a story of passionate, intelligent individuals who yearn for a deeper understanding of the universe....Bartusiak's lively style illuminates the contributions of physicists...and leaves the reader rooting for scientists around the world who wait eagerly and patiently for the universe to play them a tune.\"\n\nAstronomy magazine\n\n• \"[An] illuminating history....Bartusiak is adept at making the nuances of general relativity comprehensible....Einstein's Unfinished Symphony is understandable even to readers who lack a background in astronomy or physics....Einstein shines and Bartusiak's book resonates with optimism.\"\n\nRyder W. Miller, Mercury magazine, Astronomical Society of the Pacific\n\n• \"Bartusiak gives a good picture of the work of scientists and the obstacles, financial and political, as well as practical and theoretical, that they must undergo.... portray[s] Einstein as the epitome of genius, the well-deserving Man of the Century.\"\n\nNancy Schapiro, St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\n• \"Bartusiak shows the reader the real world of science, where hypotheses are championed or challenged by people equipped not only with powerful minds but also courageous visions, fragile egos, and ample eccentricenties.... generous with anecdotes.... poetic...\"\n\nJean Shea, Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\n• \"Bartusiak excitingly relates the hunt for proof of the gravity waves predicted by Einstein. The existence of these \"spacequakes\" would not only confirm the theory of relativity but also allow scientists to listen to the sounds of the Big Bang.\"\n\nDiscover magazine\n\n• \"A beautiful history of gravitational-wave physics, full of carefully researched science and engaging portraits of scientists—elegant, straightforward, and clear.\"\n\nAlan Lightman, author of Einstein's Dreams\n\n• \"Marcia Bartusiak has done it again. Her passion for probing the frontiers of cosmic discovery has now led to Einstein's Unfinished Symphony, an account of the physicist's ongoing quest to detect gravity waves--the last experimental test of Einstein's theory of relativity. Along the way, the reader is treated to a narrative that makes you feel as though you have front-row orchestra seats.\"\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, Director, Hayden Planetarium, New York City\n\n• \"Hang on tight and lean into the curves of space-time as Marcia Bartusiak takes you surfing through the world of gravitational waves. You'll meet the fountain-pen theorists and dirty-fingernail experimenters who are straining together to open a great new window on the Universe. Will they succeed? Nobody knows. But Marcia Bartusiak shines a laser beam of intelligence down the long dark tunnels of their work so you can share in the fun of these scientific adventure.\"\n\nRobert P. Kirshner, Professor of Astronomy, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n\n• \"A wonderful portrayal of the conflicting emotions of doubt and certainty in the scientists' minds as they tell themselves repeatedly that Einstein has to be right. This is a very high stakes game and the players are, in many ways, gamblers. Their strategies, strengths, and weaknesses are engagingly constructed and artfully told.\"\n\nDavid DeVorkin, Curator, History of Astronomy and the Space Sciences, National Air and Space Museum\n\n• \"Marcia Bartusiak brings to vivid life the people and personalities, the challenges and controversies surrounding the hunt for gravitational waves.
