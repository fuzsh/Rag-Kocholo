        "text": "Wel this book I'm reading,The Forever War,is zipping along nicely. Its one of those hard to put down books and I'm not even half way thru yet. Are his other books as readable as this? Its strange because this book is all military gung ho A la the film Aliens,but you get the feeling the author really knows his science! He mentions the lower G of this planet they're on and how because the air pressure is lower due to having less gravity than the earth that the water in the sea is closer to boiling point. And also he makes travelling interstellar distances sound convincing,rather than just inventing a Device or Strange Concept.(Funnily the book was written in 1974 but set in 1997!) Who is this guy and whats his background?\n\nI really like Haldeman. I've read Camouflage (2005 Nebula winner) and The Accidental Time Machine (Nebula and Locus nominated) and thought both were quite good. Camo is the better of the 2 IMO. They both zip along as well. Entertaining and fast reads for the pacing and the relatively short book length.\n\nCamouflage:\n\nTwo aliens have wandered Earth for centuries. The Changeling has survived by adapting the forms of many different organisms. The Chameleon destroys anything or anyone that threatens it.\n\nNow, a sunken relic that holds the key to their origins calls to them to take them home--but the Chameleon has decided there's only room for one.\n\nThe Accidental Time Machine:\n\nGrad-school dropout Matt Fuller is toiling as a lowly research assistant at MIT when, while measuring subtle quantum forces that relate to time changes in gravity and electromagnetic force, his calibrator turns into a time machine. With a dead-end job and a girlfriend who has left him for another man, Matt has nothing to lose taking a time machine trip himself-or so he thinks.\n\nWho is this guy and whats his background?\n\nCan't really add anything to what others have said. Viet Nam vet with scientific credentials and these things infuse his writing, which has won multiple awards.\n\nAre his other books as readable as this?\n\nGenerally, yes. Haldeman is one of my favorite writers largely for the fact that he doesn't screw around. He's quite aware of literary values and/but he's mastered a direct, efficient style rather than a dense obtuse obscurantism and seems to be more inspired by the novel as a coherent form rather than the more 18th/19th century \"and then\" kind of chatty piling on of incidents. He's also written the occasional superb short story, novelette, novella.\n\nDespite enjoying his style and most everything I've read by him, I'm not a Haldeman fanatic and haven't read everything, especially of the newer stuff, but I can recommend:\n\nCollections:\n\nInfinite Dreams (1978)\n\nDealing in Futures (1985)\n\nNone So Blind (1996)\n\nA Separate War (2006)\n\nIn a way, each of these collections gets better than the one before it.\n\nNovels:\n\nThe Forever War (1974)\n\nMindbridge (1976)\n\nAll My Sins Remembered (1977)\n\nWorlds (1981)\n\nWorlds Apart (1983)\n\nWorlds Enough and Time (1992)\n\nCamouflage (2004)\n\n(AMSR is actually a collection of three connected novellas woven together with additional material. And the \"Worlds\" novels form a trilogy.)\n\nThe only one I can't entirely recommend is Forever Peace (1997). It's still fairly well done and interesting in ways, but doesn't carry the weight of its questionable didacticism. The Forever War probably is his best novel and does have a much later sequel that I haven't read and is probably unnecessary but this, despite the title, has nothing to do with The Forever War except the title and some thematic material - nothing in terms of plot and character.\n\nI have wanted to try Haldeman ever since i was impressed by his short story None So Blind.\n\nYep, that's a good one.\n\nPyan and others who have read Forever War can i who enjoy reading thoughtprovoking Military SF take a chance on the book and buy it ?\n\nYes!"
