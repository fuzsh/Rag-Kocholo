        "text": "\"A raunchy, viciously funny, post-feminist bat's eye view of L.A.'s dark side.\"\n\nâ Jonathan Kellerman, author of the bestselling Alex Delaware novels\n\n\"A taut, tight, sexy tale, combining love, vampirism, police procedural, and some very mean streets. Deftly done.\"\n\nâ Roger Zelazny, Hugo- and Nebula-Award- winning author of the Amber series\n\n\"The writing is crisp and clear-headed, and Gottlieb handles the emotional complexities of the characters with brevity and understandingâ¦ a good read with just enough quirkiness to make it a memorable one.\"\n\nâ Scott Winnett, LOCUS magazine\n\n\"It's all a lot of fun, a sharp picture of life after dark in Southern California...highly entertaining...an impressive first novel, and excellent escapist reading in its own right.\"\n\nâ Carolyn Cushman, LOCUS magazine\n\n\"A notable addition to the vampire field.\"\n\nâ Kim Newman, author of ANNO DRACULA\n\n\"Sherry Gottlieb's strongest point is her bringing out the brilliant eccentricities of her characters. In Love Bite, there is nothing like Ms Gottlieb bringing the City of Angels to life in all its shades of bizarre eccentricities, quirks, and nice/not-so-nice peccadilloes of its inhabitants.\"\n\nâ Lunarpages\n\n\"Fast-paced and exciting, one hell of a read!\"\n\nâ Thomas Doherty, Tor/Forge Books\n\n\"A great deal of fun.\"\n\nâ Michele Slung\n\n\"A delightful, sexy brew.\"\n\nâ FATEA magazine (U.K.)\n\n\"A colorful, compelling tale.\"\n\nâ Brent Monahan, author of THE BOOK OF COMMON DREAD\n\nEditor's Pick of 1999, Barnesandnoble.com\n\n\"This is a clever and cold-blooded little fable that captures the essence of our times.\"\n\nâ Orlando Sentinel\n\n\"Sherry Gottlieb knows how to tell a story; WORSE THAN DEATH is a real page-turner.\"\n\nâ Hugo- and Nebula-Award-winning author Joe Haldeman\n\n\"WORSE THAN DEATH intrigues me. It's inventive and very amusing. Highly recommended.\"\n\nâ Philip JosÃ© Farmer, author of The Riverworld series\n\n\"Sherry Gottlieb's new novel about vampires suggests that death may be the cure for what ails you--though the price may be more than you want to pay. A frequently funny, often terrifying novel about life and death on the dark side.\"\n\nâ Frank M. Robinson, author of WAITING and THE POWER\n\n\"A wonderfully erotic hard-boiled murder mystery about vampires in loveâ¦WORSE THAN DEATH is the perfect 'great read' to sprawl out with under a beach umbrella in the broiling sun or to curl up with in your favorite easy chair in front of a cozy fireplace on a chilly night.\"\n\nâ Richard A. Lupoff, author of WRITER AT LARGE\n\n\"WORSE THAN DEATH is a sexy, supernatural whodunit; Gottlieb's vampires are compellingly original, with compellingly human problems. One wild, fast-paced rideâ¦\"\n\nâ Jeanne Kalogridis, author of The Diaries of the Family Dracul\n\n\"WORSE THAN DEATH spanks right along along with steamy energy and the author's appropriately wry eye entertainingly reporting the state of undeath in Southern California. One can hope Jace and Risha will return in a third novel....\"\n\nâ Locus - Edward Bryant\n\n\"Sherry Gottlieb's WORSE THAN DEATH is one hell of a sexy, funny, exciting read. Miss this wonderful novel and you'll be kicking yourself into the next life.\"\n\nâ Patrick LoBrutto\n\n\"Sherry Gottlieb adds a little spice to the tasty bloodsucker stew of vampire fiction. Like Laurell K. Hamilton's excellent Anita Blake series, Gottlieb writes about steamy, erotic power duels between humans and the undead.\"\n\nâ Naomi Gesinger, Amazon.com\n\n\"A very straightforward book, clear and vivid and appealing.\"\n\nâ Catherine B. Krusberg, The Vampire's Crypt\n\n\"Very entertaining.\"\n\nâ Science Fiction Chronicle"
