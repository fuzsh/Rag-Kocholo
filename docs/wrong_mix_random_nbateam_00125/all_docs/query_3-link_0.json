        "text": "Joe Haldeman is a graduate in Astronomy and Physics from the University of Maryland and he gained a master's degree in Creative Writing at the University of Iowa. A Vietnam War veteran, he was awarded the Purple Heart. He was president of Science Fiction Writers of America (1992-1994).\n\nHis best known works are The Forever War (1975) -a novel that won the Hugo, Nebula and Locus prizes, and was made into a comic series with illustrations by Markvano (Mark van Oppen) -, and Forever Peace (1997), a novel that is not a sequel but explores the subject of war and the new technologies, especially nanotechnology. He has published two anthologies that include almost all of his short stories, Infinite Dreams (1978) and None So Blind (1996); the latter includes the tales \"Graves\" (Locus, Nebula and World Fantasy Prizes in 1993) and \"None So Blind\" (Hugo and Locus Prizes in 1995). Worlds (1981), Worlds Apart (1984) and Worlds Enough and Time (1992) make up a trilogy based around the adventures of a female protagonist, on the future of civilisation after the Third World War. He has also written two novels for the television series Star Trek: Planet of Judgement (1977) and World Without End (1979).\n\nOn two occasions he has won the Rhysling Prize for the best science-fiction poetry: in 1984 with \"Saul's Death\" and in 1990 with \"Eighteen Years Old, October Eleventh\"."
