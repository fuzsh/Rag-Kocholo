        "text": "I contacted the author's Literary Estate to see if they had any info on the subject. The were kind enough to pointed me toward a note in his autobiography which indicates that, in the author's opinion at least, the goal of his overseas publisher was to \"simplify\" the title and text for a younger US audience.\n\nHe was deeply upset about this and evidently voiced his concerns to them. Eventually future editions had the unedited text and original title, although the 'Starship' edition also remained in print for decades.\n\nThe contract duly arrived. A one-sheet job, brutally simple. I signed as instructed. I knew only Faberâ€™s honest contracts, Ted knew no more than I. It was a contract with no release clause. As long as Criterion kept their edition in print, so long would S. G. Phillips take fifty per cent from any subsidiary sale, such as paperback or film rights.\n\nWhen eventually some copies of the Criterion edition filtered through, my disappointment was great. The text had been altered, simplified. The title had been changed to Starship, which gave away the first major surprise of the novel, the binding appeared to be a kind of sacking, and the whole presentation was aimed at a juvenile or semi-juvenile market. As I write, the Criterion edition is officially still in print. For obvious reasons, I cannot comment on that.\n\nBury My Heart At W.H.Smith's\n\nMost likely the publisher simply preferred a different title.\n\nThere are many examples of the same story being published under different titles. Poul Anderson's \"The makeshift Rocket\" appeared in Astounding as \"A Bicycle Built For Brew\", \"The Enemy Stars\" as \"We Have Fed Our Sea\", and \"Planet of No Return\" as \"Question and Answer\", probably because John W Campbell thought the original titles too bland. Also his \"After Doomsday\" had appeared in Galaxy as \"The Day After Doomsday\".\n\nSimilarly, Hal Clement's \"Needle\" has also been published as \"From Outer Space\" and Aldiss' own \"Bow Down To Nul\" first appeared in New Worlds as \"X For Exploitation\". n Short stories commonly get the same treatment. Thus Arthur C Clarke's \"Royal Prerogative\" has also appeared as \"Refugee\" or just as \"?\". In short, it's just an irritating habit that publishers (and magazine editors) seem to have."
