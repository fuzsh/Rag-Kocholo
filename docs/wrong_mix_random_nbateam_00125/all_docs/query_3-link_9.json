The novel tells of a war that stretches across intergalactic distances and long periods of time, the soldiers involved traveling to remote battlefields via black holes. Because the soldiers travel at faster-than-light speeds, they age far slower than the civilians for whom they fight. This difference in relative age—the soldiers a few years older, their society centuries older—results in an alienation between the soldiers and the people they defend.\n\n\"Haldeman exercises his literary license,\" James Scott Hicks wrote in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, \"to comment on, and ultimately to expunge from his memory, America's last ground war [Vietnam].\" Hicks pointed out that Haldeman's first novel, War Year, based on his army diaries, deals with the Vietnam fighting directly. \"But the demon of Vietnam,\" Hicks continued, \"was not exorcised from Haldeman's soul by writing [War Year], and frontline combat became the subject of … The Forever War.\" Haldeman, Hicks believed, is particularly adept at presenting his \"theme of quiet resentment felt by those waging war.\" Because of his scientific training in physics and astronomy, Haldeman is particularly careful to present The Forever War as realistically and accurately as possible. \"The technology involved in this interplanetary campaign,\" Martin Levin of the New York Times Book Review noted in his review of The Forever War, \"is so sophisticated that the book might well have been accompanied by an operator's manual. But then, all the futuristic mayhem is plugged into human situations that help keep the extraterrestrial activity on a warm and even witty plane.\"\n\nAmong newer novelists in the field, Haldeman, Richard Geis of Science Fiction Review believed, \"is one of the best realistic science fiction writers going; maybe the best.\" Hicks found that \"Haldeman confronts his readers with painful questions, but he asks them with no small literary skill and with careful attention to scientific credibility.\" \"It's comforting to know,\" wrote Algis Budrys of the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, \"that the cadre of impressive talent among younger writers is not diminishing, and to think that people like Haldeman will be around for a long time to set high standards.\"\n\nHaldeman's \"Worlds\" trilogy, published over a span of a dozen years, follows the exploits of Marianne O'Hara, who is, summarized Michael Pavese in Best Sellers, \"an intelligent, promiscuous (in space promiscuity is encouraged) New New York citizen.\" Born in space, she travels from her orbiting, manmade world to Earth, to engage in postgraduate studies at N.Y.U. in the first book, Worlds: A Novel of the Near Future. It details her adventures and misadventures on Twenty-second-century Earth, a far poorer, more decadent, chaotic, and dangerous extension of contemporary society. It is a society rapidly nearing a total break-down—which, by the denouement, it indeed has, with Marianne's space ship veritably riding the shockwave of nuclear devastation home to New New York. Worlds Apart details Marianne's career as an ambitious politician of the orbital worlds, who, thinking her former lover, Jeff Hawkings, is dead (he isn't) from the nuclear holocaust, takes a pair of husbands. In addition, the book not only tracks Jeff's career, now peddling medications to devolved Earth tribes, it includes, noted Charles Platt in the Washington Post, \"a grab-bag of extraneous notions in between: a Mansonworshipping death cult, a starship with an anti-matter drive, a formalized menage-a-trois, a hijacked space shuttle, an expedition into regressed Florida, a new science of behavioral conditioning, and more.\" In the final book, Worlds Enough and Time, Marianne, her two husbands and her cybernetic \"twin sister,\" along with 10,000 other would-be colonists, venture forth in the starship Newhome to seek their destinies on an Earth-like planet in the Epsilon Eridani system. A Publishers Weekly reviewer concluded, \"Haldeman shows his strengths here: the workings of Newhome are believably complex, the novel's scientific background is neither strained nor especially complicated, and the reader's attention is focused on O'Hara's character, her inner life and her interpersonal relationships.\"\n\nIn addition to the obvious recurring theme of war—both real and imagined—in many of Haldeman's books, essayist Duncan Lunan noted another theme in the St. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers. Referring back to The Forever War, where the enemy aliens are controlled by a hive-mind, Lunan said, \"Mind-bridge was another examination of human contact with a hive-mind, while All My Sins Remembered was a damning indictment not merely of big government but also of the standard SF attitude toward individuality. SF used to be full of people who find out that they're really someone else (usually someone more powerful), and part of the problem in identifying with central characters is often they lack individuality.\" Explained Lunan, \"McGavin in All My Sins Remembered is a government agent, repeatedly given new identities through psychological conditioning and plastic surgery.\" Lunan added, \"He is an individual moved and controlled by an organisation which commands his loyalty but is beyond his control.\" The theme of individuals preyed upon and controlled by ultra-powerful agencies or corporate entities is also central to Haldeman's \"Worlds\" trilogy, as with the CIA and KGB in Tool of the Trade, and by the wealthy in Buying Time. A Publishers Weekly contributor wrote, \"Evoking painful nostalgia, … Haldeman uses bold language, powerful images and a graphic style to tell his emotional tale, in which concentrated, diary-like entries intensify the drama and despair.\"\n\nSue Martin, writing in the Los Angeles Times, termed The Hemingway Hoax \"a bright, short science fiction novel, … [this] quirky effort offers a unique solution to one of the enduring literary mysteries of our time: Just what DID happen to Ernest Hemingway's missing manuscripts, lost in 1922 at the Gare de Lyon in Paris?\" She continued, \"For Hemingway fans, Haldeman's answer is a hoot, and as different a theory as you can find.\" Marc Leepson, in a Book World review, described Haldeman's fictionalized but largely autobiographical 1968 as \"a well-crafted, biting novel set in Vietnam.\"\n\nForever Peace is a follow-up novel to the problems raised in Haldeman's acclaimed Forever War. In 2043, an American-led alliance has been battling with the third-world Ngumi confederation, primarily, on the alliance's part, with \"soldierboys\"—killing machines controlled by brain-linked \"mechanics,\" among them, the protagonist, physicist Julian Class. Meanwhile, the Jupiter Project, the most ambitious scientific experiment of all time, circles Jupiter, and Julian's lover, Amelia, discovers it may endanger not only our solar system, but the universe, in a new \"Big Bang.\" Among other complications, their attempt to stop the disaster runs afoul of an influential Christian cult, the Hammer of God, dedicated to bringing on the Endtime. A Publishers Weekly reviewer concluded, \"As always, Haldeman, a Vietnam vet, writes with intelligence and power about the horrors of war, and about humanity's seeming inability to overcome its violent tendencies.\"\n\nWhile Forever Peace quenched the thirst of many of Haldeman's devoted readers, fans still clamored for a sequel to The Forever War, which the author provided in Forever Free. According to Jackie Cassada of Library Journal, Haldeman \"continues his exploration of the essential nature of humanity in a deceptively simple story that questions the foundations of human belief.\" Haldeman describes life after the war, focusing on William and Margay Mandella, two retired soldiers banished to the frozen planet of Middle Finger by the highly evolved species of humans who took over when the war ended. Cassada recommended the book, crediting Haldeman with \"clear, concise storytelling\" and an \"understanding of human behavior.\" A Publishers Weekly contributor called Forever Free \"a well-written and worthy sequel to one of SF's enduring classics.\"\n\nFollowing Forever Free, Haldeman wrote The Coming, a first-contact type story about a professor named Aurora Bell, who gets a message from an alien population announcing their upcoming visit to Earth. Bell attempts to warn officials by telling them about the message she's received, but no once cares to listen. Library Journal's Cassada noted, Haldeman \"demonstrates an uncanny ability to tell a large-scale story with a minimum of words\" and commented that the book \"provides food for thought as well as fast-paced action.\" The protagonist of Haldeman's next book, Guardian, is another courageous woman. The story follows Rosa Coleman, a woman from the late nineteenth century who leaves her abusive husband. Rosa believes she has an important destiny and a mystical raven verifies her belief. Cassada remarked that Haldeman \"delivers an elegant parable of many worlds and multiple possibilities while telling the tale of a courageous woman whose life spans most of a century.\" Roland Green of Booklist noted, \"Many may prefer the historical traits of the novel to its SF aspect. They also may admit that Haldeman couldn't write a bad book to win a bet.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nbooks\n\nAuthors and Artists for Young Adults, Volume 38, Gale (Detroit, MI), 2001.\n\nContemporary Literary Criticism, Volume 61, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1990.\n\nDictionary of Literary Biography, Volume 7: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1981.\n\nEncyclopedia of Science Fiction, St. Martin's Press (New York, NY), 1993.\n\nGordon, Joan, Joe Haldeman, Starmont House (Mercer Island, WA), 1980.\n\nSt. James Guide to Science Fiction Writers, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nScience Fiction and Fantasy Literature, 1975-1991, Gale (Detroit, MI), 1992.\n\nScience Fiction Writers: Critical Studies of the Major Authors from the Early Nineteenth Century to the Present Day, 2nd edition, Scribner (New York, NY), 1999.\n\nTwentieth-Century Science-Fiction Writers, 3rd edition, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1991.\n\nperiodicals\n\nAlgol, summer-fall, 1977; summer-fall, 1978.\n\nAnalog, March, 1978; September, 1978; July, 1979; November, 1982, pp. 164-165; September, 1983, p. 164; March, 1984, p. 168; February, 1986, p. 182; December, 1986, p. 182; January, 1990, pp. 308-309.\n\nAnalog Science Fiction and Fact, May, 2000, Tom Easton, review of Forever Free, p. 132.\n\nBest Sellers, June 15, 1972; December, 1976; February, 1978.\n\nBloomsbury Review, January-February, 1996, pp. 3, 20.\n\nBooklist, June 1, 1975; June 1995; September 15, 1997; November 1, 2000, Ray Olson, review of The Coming, p. 492; January 1, 2002, review of Forever Free, p. 832; November 1, 2002, Roland Green, review of Guardian, p. 480.\n\nBook World, July 2, 1995, p.
