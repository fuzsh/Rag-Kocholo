        "text": "In the literary world, it seems like it’s always prize season. But who actually gets all these literary prizes? It feels as though some writers have won every prize in the world—and it also feels as though some, while equally deserving, have won almost none of them. These are the kinds of thoughts that lead me to make spreadsheets, and also to share my findings with you.\n\nI couldn’t track every single prize available to writers (or at least, I couldn’t without going insane), so I stuck to the biggest and most prestigious prizes in fiction.* While putting together the data, I noticed that some writers had won several of the same prize, and some had a more diverse portfolio, so I’ve split the final results into two lists: those who have one the most prizes of those I counted, full stop, and those who have won the most distinct prizes, i.e. one of each. I also looked at who had won the most prizes for a single book. I included prizes for career work as well as for single books.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, given what we know about sexism in publishing, it’s mostly men who top all the lists here. Interestingly, the women who do rank are more likely to be writers of speculative fiction (Ursula K. Le Guin, N. K. Jemisin, etc.)—possibly because winners of the Hugo, Nebula, and Arthur C. Clarke awards are more likely to win them multiple times than the winners of more general literary awards. On the plus side, if you haven’t read Colson Whitehead’s The Underground Railroad, this accounting may just finally convince you.\n\n*\n\nThe writers who have won the most major prizes:\n\n9 prizes:\n\nPhilip Roth\n\nNational Book Award for Goodbye, Columbus (1960)\n\nNBCC Award for The Counterlife (1987)\n\nPEN/Faulkner Award for Operation Shylock (1994)\n\nNational Book Award for Sabbath’s Theater (1995)\n\nPulitzer Prize for American Pastoral (1998)\n\nPEN/Faulkner Award for The Human Stain (2001)\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal (2001)\n\nPEN/Faulkner Award for Everyman (2007)\n\nMan Booker International Prize (2011)\n\n8 prizes:\n\nJohn Updike\n\nNational Book Award for The Centaur (1964)\n\nNBCC Award for Rabbit is Rich (1981)\n\nPulitzer Prize for Rabbit is Rich (1982)\n\nNational Book Award for Rabbit is Rich (1982)\n\nNBCC Award for Rabbit at Rest (1990)\n\nPulitzer Prize for Rabbit at Rest (1991)\n\nPEN/Faulkner Award for The Early Stories 1953-1975 (2004)\n\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal (2007)\n\n7 prizes:\n\nE.
