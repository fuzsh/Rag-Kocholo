        "text": "Günter Grass\n\nThe great German novelist, Günter Grass, died on April 13, 2015. He won the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature for his \"frolicsome black fables [that] portray the forgotten face of history\" and the Nobel Academy named him the \"predecessor\" of \"García Márquez, Rushdie, Gordimer, Lobo Antunes and Kenzaburo Oe.\" Although his landmark 1959 novel, The Tin Drum, was initially rejected by his countrymen, it became an international success and launched his career. Grass became known as the conscience of Germany--a status that was later questioned when he disclosed his involvement during World War II."
