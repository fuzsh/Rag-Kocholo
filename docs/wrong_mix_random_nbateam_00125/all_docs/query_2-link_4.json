        "text": "Introduction: What You Don’t Know Can’t Hurt You\n\nOur culture and other cultures have a romantic image of the writer as a man or woman of experience—Jack London slogging through the snow or fighting the high seas, Hemingway jumping into the ring with bulls or prizefighters, Joan Didion going to El Salvador, Norman Mailer daring to wear a white fur coat in Manhattan—but most of us know that what they actually do with their time is stare at a blank space and try desperately to come up with the next sentence. In action, a writer looks pretty much like a clerk. Romantics would rather think of them as walking point for us—going out and living life to the fullest: doing, feeling, thinking, and eventually becoming so full of life that they have to sit down at the writing table to try to make sense of it all, for themselves and for their waiting readers.\n\nWriters don’t work very hard to dispel this illusion. Many of us use our profession as an excuse to do things that are dangerous or expensive or morally reprehensible—or all three. Every now and then, if you hang around writers, you come across one or two who you suspect write fiction only because it gives them an excuse to say outrageous things, have sex with a variety of odd people, and drink before lunchtime.\n\nThe title of this collection was originally Feedback, from the first story, one of my favorites. But None So Blind won a bunch of awards, including the Hugo for Best Science Fiction Short Story of the Year, and my editor beseeched me to change the title to that. Not only was it marginally more famous, but it was less abstract, and thus less of a headache for the art director. I was generously allowed to keep this introduction, though, and the organization of the book, which tied into the original title.\n\nSome writerly behavior, and misbehavior, can be seen in terms of feedback. Feedback is what happens when part of the output of a system is fed back into the system to regulate it. The screech you get from a microphone is positive feedback; it reinforces the output. Negative feedback is more benign, like the governor on a truck’s engine or a pressure cooker’s regulator. Writers such as Hemingway and Byron, who feel compelled to model their lives after their made-up heroes, are evincing a kind of positive feedback. I suppose there may be negative-feedback writers, too, who are repelled by the excesses of their characters, and so live quiet, normal lives—but of course we only hear about the other kind!\n\nA justification of the more flamboyant behavior is a corollary to a rule that I think is a pernicious lie: Write what you know. Teachers from the fourth grade through graduate school keep telling their students to write what they know, and it’s a principle that seems so self-evident that neither students nor teachers question it. (It’s also why there are so many novels about college professors committing adultery with their students, or at least fantasizing about it.)\n\nI’m a science-fiction writer, and I would certainly be paralyzed if I were restricted to writing about what I, or anybody else, actually knew from experience. Nobody has ever talked to a Martian, or used mental telepathy to control others, or traveled through time. (There are people, somewhat reality-impaired, who do think they have done these things, and one of the bonuses of being a science-fiction writer is that you get to correspond with them and sometimes even meet them in the flesh.)\n\nScience fiction is an interesting perspective for investigating this writing-and-experience business from two different angles. One is the rejection of experience completely: the value of imagining events to write about rather than remembering them. And the other is the creative interplay between imagination and experience: I’ve never fired a ray gun, but I have fired a pistol. I think in both cases you use both hands to steady the weapon; you spend an extra fraction of a second getting a good sight picture; you squeeze the trigger rather than jerk it, and so forth. Knowing the real world makes your imaginary world more believable.\n\nWhat’s more important than those mechanical details, of course, is how well you can know or imagine the emotional state of the person who’s holding that ray gun and about to fire. If you do that honestly, you’re inventing truth. You’re not being dishonest by making up things that haven’t happened to you; by and large that’s what a fiction writer does—and if you write science fiction, fantasy, or horror most of the things you write about have never happened to anybody.\n\nA couple of hobgoblins can’t be ignored, though. You ought to shy away from writing directly about a very commonplace experience that you have never experienced. I’d either be a fool or have to consider myself a genius, for instance, to write about how it feels to go through pregnancy and have a baby. The science fiction writer James Tiptree, Jr., revealed to some readers that she was actually female when she tried to write a description of male masturbation in zero gravity.\n\nBut it’s worth thinking about what actually constitutes universal experience. I see an awful lot of tiresome nonsense written about combat, which rings false to me because I did experience a half year of combat in Vietnam. But most of a writer’s audience nowadays wouldn’t have experienced combat, either; it’s a fairly rare experience even among men of my generation. So very few readers are going to catch you, for instance, if you write about a M-16 rifle firing twenty rounds at a clip. (Reference books will tell you the weapon held twenty rounds; they probably won’t tell you that if you loaded more than eighteen, you risked the thing jamming.)\n\nThere’s a famous example of just making it all up: According to most critics, the best novel about the American Civil War is The Red Badge of Courage, written by Stephen Crane many years after the war. Crane was born six years after the conflict ended and had not had any experience of combat anywhere. He interviewed a lot of veterans for specific information, but the main thing is that he could describe very well the interior of his own heart, and he had one hell of an imagination. (An old soldier who reviewed the book in London admired its accuracy but wondered how the writer managed to get the sound of the bullets wrong.)\n\nAll experience is, of course, memory by the time you sit down to write about it, unless all you write about is typing. So another thing that writers ought to be aware of is that the barrier between memory and imagination can be a very thin membrane indeed. All of us constantly rewrite our own pasts, not just to make ourselves look better, but to try to make sense out of our lives and out of capital L Life in general.\n\nAn exercise I give to my writing students at MIT is to have everybody write for five or ten minutes about the earliest childhood memory they can recall. I ask them to try to remember an actual incident rather than just a sense of place, which is what most people come up with. There must be some reason they remember this incident rather than some other one, something important to them in later life, so it’s a logical springboard for a story. But it’s also part of a demonstration about the value of experience in writing fiction.\n\nAfter I collect their papers, I tell them this anecdote about first memories: The great child psychologist Jean Piaget thought for years that his earliest memory was the dramatic one of having been kidnapped from his stroller. He even remembered that his nurse chased after the man and caught him; her face was scratched up in the struggle. Years later, though, the nurse came back to visit the family and confessed that she had made the whole thing up—she’d gotten the scratches making love with her boyfriend in the bushes! Piaget had heard the story so many times that the details had impressed themselves upon his memory as true data, remembered.\n\nThis is not irrelevant to fiction: the actual truth or falsity of that incident was immaterial to its effect on Piaget’s personality as he grew from child to adult. The memory of the nurse’s selfless behavior must have given him a higher opinion of human nature than he otherwise would have had. The incident might even have had some effect on his choice of career.\n\nWhen we read a piece of fiction, unless it’s an obvious roman à clef like The Sun Also Rises or Unanswered Prayers, we don’t have any idea whether the author ever experienced anything like the incidents in the story. It shouldn’t make a particle of difference, either—but of course it does. We wonder about the literal authority of the author. We are also snoops and voyeurs.\n\nOne reason writers’ biographies are interesting is the opportunity to search through them for sources of the fictions. It occurred to me that that would be a useful way to tie together the stories in this book, using hindsight to recall, or try to figure out, which parts of each story are made up and which parts came from so-called real life. I put in those mullings as afterwords, in a different typeface, so that those who just want to read fiction can easily skip over them. But those people aren’t reading this either.…\n\nJoe Haldeman\n\nIsle of Jersey\n\nApril 1993 to October 1995\n\nSeasons\n\nTranscripts edited from the last few hundred hours of recordings:\n\nMaria\n\nForty-one is too young to die. I was never trained to be a soldier. Trained to survive, yes, but not to kill or be killed.\n\nThat’s the wrong way to start. Let me start this way.\n\nAs near as I can reckon, it’s mid-noviembre,\n\nAC\n\n238. I am Maria Rubera, chief xenologist for the second Confederación expedition to Sanchrist IV. I am currently standing guard in the mouth of a cave while my five comrades try to sleep. I am armed with a stone axe and flint spear and a pile of rocks for throwing. A cold rain is misting down, and I am wearing only a stiff kilt and vest of wet rank fur. I am cold to the very heart but we dare not risk a fire. The Plathys have too acute a sense of smell.\n\nI am subvocalizing, recording this into my artificial bicuspid, one of which each of us has; the only post-Stone Age artifacts in this cave. It may survive even if, as is probable, I do not. Or it may not survive. The Plathys have a way of eating animals head first, crunching up skull and brain while the decapitated body writhes at their feet or staggers around, which to them is high humor. Innocent humor but ghastly. I almost came to love them. Which is not to say I understand them.\n\nLet me try to make this document as complete as possible. It gives me something to do. I trust you have a machine that can filter out the sound of my teeth chattering. For a while I could do the Zen trick to keep my teeth still. But I’m too cold now. And too certain of death, and afraid.\n\nMy specialty is xenology but I do have a doctorate in histori-cultural anthropology, which is essentially the study of dead cultures through the writings of dead anthropologists. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, old style, there were dozens of isolated cultures still existing without metals or writing or even, in some cases, agriculture or social organization beyond the family. None of them survived more than a couple of generations beyond their contact with civilization, but civilization by then could afford the luxury of science, and so there are fairly complete records. The records are fascinating not only for the information about the primitives, but also for what they reveal of the investigating cultures’ unconscious prejudices. My own specialties were the Maori and Eskimo tribes, and (by necessary association) the European and American cultures that investigated and more or less benignly destroyed them.\n\nI will try not to stray from the point. That training is what led to my appointment as leader of this band of cold, half-naked, probably doomed, pseudo-primitive scientists. We do not repeat the errors of our forebears. We come to the primitives on equal terms, now, so as not to contaminate their habit patterns by superior example. No more than is necessary. Most of us do not bite the heads off living animals or exchange greetings by the tasting of excrement.\n\nSaying that and thinking of it goads me to go down the hill again. We designated a latrine rock a few hundred meters away, in sight of the cave entrance but with no obvious path leading here, to throw them off our scent at least temporarily. I will not talk while going there. They also have acute hearing.\n\nBack. Going too often and with too little result. Diet mostly raw meat in small amounts. Only warm place on my body is the hot and itching anus. No proper hygiene in the Stone Age. Just find a smooth rock. I can feel my digestive tract flourishing with worms and bugs. No evidence yet, though, nor blood. Carlos Fleming started passing blood, and two days later something burst and he died in a rush of it. We covered his body with stones. Ground too frozen for grave-digging. He was probably uncovered and eaten.\n\nIt can’t be the diet. On Earth I paid high prices for raw meat and fish and never suffered except in the wallet. I’m afraid it may be a virus. We all are, and we indulge in discreet copromancy, the divining of future events through the inspection of stools. If there is blood your future will be short.\n\nPerhaps it was stress. We are under unusual stress. But I stray.\n\nIt was specifically my study of Eskimos that impressed the assigning committee. Eskimos were small bands of hearty folk who lived in the polar regions of North America. Like the Plathys, they were anagricultural carnivores, preying on herds of large animals, sometimes fishing. The Plathys have no need for the Eskimos’ fishing skills, since the sea teems with life edible and stupid. But they prefer red meat and the crunch of bone, the chewy liver and long suck of intestinal contents, the warm mush of brains. They are likable but not fastidious. And not predictable, we learned to our grief.\n\nLike the Eskimos, the Plathys relish the cold and become rather dull and listless during the warm season. Sanchrist IV has no axial tilt, thus no seasons in the Terran sense, but its orbit is highly elongated, so more than two thirds of its year (three and a half Terran years) is spent in cold. We identified six discrete seasons: spring, summer, fall, winter, dead winter, and thaw. The placid sea gets ice skim in mid-fall.\n\nIf you are less than totally ignorant of science, you know that Sanchrist IV is one of the very few planets with not only earthlike conditions but with life forms that mimic our own patterns of DNA. There are various theories explaining this coincidence, which cannot be coincidence, but you can find them elsewhere. What this meant in terms of our conduct as xenologists was that we could function with minimal ecological impact, living off the fat of the land—and the blood and flesh and marrow, which did require a certain amount of desensitization training. (Less for me than for some of the others, as I’ve said, since I’ve always had an atavistic leaning toward dishes like steak tartare and sushi.)\n\nSatellite observation has located 119 bands, or families, of Plathys, and there is no sign of other humanoid life on the planet. All of them live on islands in a southern subtropical sea—at least it would be subtropical on Earth—a shallow sea that freezes solid in dead winter and can be walked over from late fall to early thaw. During the warm months, on those occasions when they actually stir their bones to go someplace, they pole rafts from island to island. During low tide, they can wade most of the way.\n\nWe set up our base in the tropics, well beyond their normal range, and hiked south during the late summer. We made contact with a few individuals and small packs during our month-long trek but didn’t join a family until we reached the southern mountains.\n\nThe Plathys aren’t too interesting during the warm months, except for the short mating season. Mostly they loll around, conserving energy, living off the meat killed during the thaw, which they smoke and store in covered holes. When the meat gets too old, or starts running out, they do bestir themselves to fish, which takes little enough energy. The tides are rather high in summer and fall, and all they have to do is stake down nets in the right spots during high tide. The tide recedes and leaves behind flopping silver bounty. They grumble and joke about the taste of it, though.\n\nThey accepted our presence without question, placidly sharing their food and shelter as they would with any wayfaring member of another native family. They couldn’t have mistaken us for natives, though. The smallest adult Plathy weighs twice as much as our largest. They stand about two and a half meters high and span about a meter and a half across the shoulders. Their heads are more conical than square, with huge powerful jaws: a mouth that runs almost ear to ear. Their eyes are set low, and they have mucous-membrane slits in place of external ears and noses. They are covered with sparse silky fur, which coarsens into thick hair on their heads, shoulders, armpits, and groins (and on the males’ backs). The females have four teats defining the corners of a rectangular slab of lactiferous fatty tissue. The openings we thought were their vaginas are almost dorsal, with the cloacal openings toward the front. The male genitals are completely ventral, normally hidden under a mat of hair. (This took a bit of snooping. In all but the hottest times and mating season, both genders wear a modest kilt of skin.)\n\nWe had been observing them about three weeks when the females went into estrus—every mature female, all the same day. Their sexuality was prodigious.\n\nEverybody shed their kilts and went into a week-long unrelenting spasm of sexual activity. There is nothing like it among any of the sentient cultures—or animal species!—that I have studied. To call it an orgy would be misleading and, I think, demeaning to the Plathys. The phenomenon was more like a tropism, in plants, than any animal or human instinct. They quite simply did not do anything else for six days.\n\nThe adults in our family numbered eighty-two males and nineteen females (the terrible reason for the disparity would become clear in a later season), so the females were engaged all the time, even while they slept. While one male copulated, two or three others would be waiting their turn, prancing impatiently, masturbating, sometimes indulging in homosexual coupling. (Indulging is the wrong word. There was no sense that they took pleasure in any sexual activity; it was more like the temporary relief of a terrible pressure that quickly built up again.) They attempted coupling with children and with the humans of my expedition. Fortunately, for all their huge strength they are rather slow and, for all the pressure of their desire, easily deflected. A kick in the knee was enough to send them stumping off toward someone else.\n\nNo Plathys ate during the six days. They slept more and more toward the end of the period, the males sometimes falling asleep in the middle of copulation. (Conversely, we saw several instances of involuntary erection and ejaculation while sleeping.) When it was finally over, everyone sat around dazed for a while, and then the females retired to the storage holes and came back with armloads of dried and smoked meat and fish. Each one ate a mountain of food and fell into a coma.\n\nThere are interesting synchronies involved. At other times of the year, this long period of vulnerability would mean extinction of the family or of the whole species, since they evidently all copulate at the same time. But the large predators from the north do not swim down at that time of year. And when the litters were dropped, about 500 days later, it would be not long after the time of easiest food gathering, as herds of small animals migrated north for warmth.\n\nOf course we never had a chance to dissect a Plathy. It would have been fascinating to investigate the internal makeup that impels the bizarre sexual behavior. External observation gives some hint as to the strangeness. The vulva is a small opening, a little over a centimeter in extent, that stays sealed closed except when the female is in estrus. The penis, normally an almost invisible nub, becomes a prehensile purple worm about twenty centimeters long. No external testicles; there must be an internal reservoir (quite large) for seminal fluid.\n\nThe anatomical particulars of pregnancy and birth are even more strange. The females become almost immobilized, gaining perhaps fifty percent in weight. When it comes time to give birth, the female makes an actual skeletal accommodation, evidently similar to the way a snake unhinges its jaw when ingesting large prey. It is obviously quite painful. The vulva (or whatever new name applies to that opening) is not involved; instead, a slit opens along the entire perineal area, nearly half a meter long, exposing a milky white membrane. The female claws the membrane open and expels the litter in a series of shuddering contractions. Then she pushes her pelvic bones back into shape with a painful grinding sound. She remains immobile and insensate for several days, nursing. The males bring females food and clean them during this period.\n\nNone of the data from the first expedition had prepared us for this. They had come during dead winter and stayed one (terran) year, so they missed the entire birth cycle. They had noted that there were evidently strong taboos against discussing sexual matters and birth. I think taboo is the wrong word. It’s not as if there were guilt or shame associated with the processes. Rather, they appear to enter a different state of consciousness when the females are in heat and giving birth, a state that seems to blank out their verbal intelligence. They can no more discuss their sexuality than you or I could sit and chat about how our pancreas was doing.\n\nThere was an amusing, and revealing, episode after we had been with the family for several months. I had been getting along well with Tybru, a female elder with unusual linguistic ability. She was perplexed at what one of the children had told her.\n\nThe Plathys have no concept of privacy; they wander in and out of each other’s maffas (the yurtlike tents of hide they use as shelter) at any time of the day or night, on random whim. It was inevitable that sooner or later they would observe humans having sex. The child had described what she’d seen fairly accurately. I had tried to explain human sexuality to Tybru earlier, as a way to get her to talk about that aspect of her own life. She would smile and nod diagonally through the whole thing, an infuriating gesture they normally use only with children prattling nonsense.\n\nThis time I was going to be blunt. I opened the maffa flap so there was plenty of light, then shed my kilt and got up on a table. I lay down on my back and tried to explain with simple words and gestures what went where and who did what to whom, and what might or might not happen nine months later.\n\nShe was more inclined to take me seriously this time. (The child who had witnessed copulation was four, pubescent, and thus too old to have fantasies.) After I explained she explored me herself, which was not pleasant, since her four-fingered hand was larger than a human foot, quite filthy, and equipped with deadly nails.\n\nShe admitted that all she really understood was the breasts. She could remember some weeks of nursing after the blackout period the female language calls (big) pain-in-hips. (Their phrase for the other blackout period is literally pain-in-the-ass.) She asked, logically enough, whether I could find a male and demonstrate.\n\nActually, I’m an objective enough person to have gone along with it, if I could have found a man able and willing to rise to the occasion. If it had been near the end of our stay, I probably would have done it. But leadership is a ticklish thing, even when you’re leading a dozen highly educated, professionally detached people, and we still had three years to go.\n\nI explained that the most-elder doesn’t do this with the men she’s in charge of, and Tybru accepted that. They don’t have much of a handle on discipline, but they do understand polity and social form. She said she would ask the other human females.\n\nPerhaps it should have been me who did the asking, but I didn’t suggest it. I was glad to get off the hook, and also curious as to my people’s reactions.\n\nThe couple who volunteered were the last ones I would have predicted. Both of them were shy, almost diffident, with the rest of us. Good field workers but not the sort of people you would let your hair down with. I suppose they had better anthropological perspective on their own behavior than the rest of us.\n\nAt any rate, they retired to the maffa that was nominally Tybru’s, and she let out the ululation that means All free females come here. I wondered whether our couple could actually perform in a cramped little yurt filled with sweaty giants asking questions in a weird language.\n\nAll the females did crowd into the tent, and after a couple of minutes a strange sound began to emanate from them. At first it puzzled me, but then I recognized it as laughter! I had heard individual Plathys laugh, a sort of inhaled croak—but nineteen of them at once was an unearthly din.\n\nThe couple was in there a long time, but I never did find out whether the demonstration was actually consummated. They came out of the maffa beet-red and staring at the ground, the laughter behind them not abating. I never talked to either of them about it, and whenever I asked Tybru or the others, all I got was choked laughter. I think we invented the dirty joke. (In exchange, I’m sure that Plathy sexuality will eventually see service in the ribald metaphor of every human culture.)\n\nBut let me go back to the beginning.\n\nWe came to Sanchrist IV armed with a small vocabulary and a great deal of misinformation. I don’t mean to denigrate my colleagues’ skill or application. But the Garcia expedition just came at the wrong time and didn’t stay long enough.\n\nMost of their experience with the Plathys was during deep winter, which is their most lively and civilized season. They spend their indoor time creating the complex sculptures that so impressed the art world ten years ago and performing improvisational music and dance that is delightful in its alien grace. Outdoors, they indulge in complicated games and athletic exhibitions. The larders are full, the time of birthing and nursing is well over, and the family exudes happiness, well into the thaw. We experienced this euphoria ourselves. I can’t blame Garcia’s people for their enthusiastic report.\n\nWe still don’t know what happened. Or why it happened. Perhaps if these data survive, the next researchers …\n\nTrouble.\n\nGabriel\n\nI was having a strange dream of food—real food, cooked—when suddenly there was Maria, tugging on my arm, keeping me away from the table. She was whispering Gab, wake up! and so I did, cold and aching and hungry.\n\nWhat’s— She put her hand on my mouth, lightly.\n\nThere’s one outside. Mylab, I think. He had just turned three this winter, and been given his name. We crept together back to the mouth of the cave and both jumped when my ankle gave a loud pop.\n\nIt was Mylab, all right; the fur around one earhole was almost white against the blond. I was glad it wasn’t an adult. He was only about a head taller than me. Stronger, though, and well fed.\n\nWe watched from the cave’s darkness as he investigated the latrine rock, sniffing and licking, circling.\n\nMaybe he’s a scout for a hunting party, I whispered. Hunting us.\n\nToo young, I think. She passed me a stone axe. Hope we don’t have to kill him.\n\nShould we wake the others?\n\nNot yet. Make us easier to scent. As if on cue, the Plathy walked directly away from the rock and stood, hands on hips, sniffing the air. His head wagged back and forth slowly, as if he were triangulating. He shuffled in a half-circle and stood looking in our direction.\n\nStay still.\n\nHe can’t see us in the shadow.\n\nMaybe not. Their eyesight was more acute than ours, but they didn’t have good night vision.\n\nBehind us, someone woke up and sneezed. Mylab gave a little start and then began loping toward the cave.\n\nDamn it, Maria whispered. She stood up and huddled into the side of the cave entrance. You get over there. I stationed myself opposite her, somewhat better hidden because of a projecting lip of rock.\n\nMylab slowed down a few meters from the cave entrance and walked warily forward, sniffing and blinking. Maria crouched, gripping her spear with both hands, for thrusting.\n\nIt was over in a couple of seconds, but my memory of it goes in slow motion: he saw Maria, or sensed her, and lumbered straight for her, claws out, growling. She thrust twice into his chest while I stepped forward and delivered a two-handed blow to the top of his head.\n\nThat axe would have cracked a human head from crown to jaw. Instead, it glanced off his thick skull and hit his shoulder, then spun out of my grip.\n\nShaking his head, he stepped around and swung a long arm at me. I was just out of range, staggering back; one claw opened up my cheek and the tip of my nose. Blood was spouting from two wounds in his chest. He stepped forward to finish me off and Maria plunged the spear into the back of his neck. The flint blade burst out under his chin in a spray of blood.\n\nHe stood staggering between us for a moment, trying to reach the spear shaft behind him. Two stones flew up from the rear of the cave; one missed, but the other hit his cheek with a loud crack. He turned and stumbled away down the slope, the spear bouncing grotesquely behind him.\n\nThe other four joined us at the cave entrance. Brenda, our doctor, looked at my wound and regretted her lack of equipment. So did I.\n\nHave to go after him, Derek said. Kill him.\n\nMaria shook her head. He’s still dangerous. Wait a few minutes; then we can follow the blood trail.\n\nHe’s dead, Brenda said. His body just doesn’t know it yet.\n\nMaybe so, Maria said, her shoulders slumping sadly. Anyhow, we can’t stay here. Hate to move during daylight, but we don’t have any choice.\n\nWe’re not the only ones who can follow a blood trail, Herb said. He had a talent for stating the obvious.\n\nWe gathered up our few weapons, the water bladders, and the food sack, to which we had just added five small batlike creatures, mostly fur and bone. None of us looked forward to being hungry enough to eat them.\n\nThe trail was easy to follow, several bright red spatters per meter. He had gone about three hundred meters before collapsing.\n\nWe found him lying behind a rock in a widening pool of blood, the spear sticking straight up. When I pulled it out he made a terrible gurgling sound. Brenda made sure he was dead.\n\nMaria looked very upset, biting her lip, I think to keep tears away. She is a strange woman. Hard and soft. She treats the Plathys by the book but obviously has a sentimental streak toward them. I sort of like them too, but don’t think I’d want to take one home with me.\n\nBrenda’s upset too, retching now. My fault; I should have offered to do the knife. But she didn’t ask.\n\nI’d better take point position. Stop recording now. Concentrate on not getting surprised.\n\nMaria\n\nBack to the beginning. Quite hot when we were set down on the tropical mainland. It was the middle of the night and we worked quickly, with no lights (what I’d give for night glasses now), to set up our domed base.\n\nIn a way it’s a misnomer to call it a base, since we left it the next night, not to return for three and a half years. We thought. It was really just a staging area and a place where we would wait for pickup after our mission was ended. We really didn’t foresee having to run back to it to hide from the Plathys.\n\nIt was halfheartedly camouflaged, looking like a dome of rock in the middle of a jungle terrain that featured no other domes of rock. To our knowledge at the time, no Plathy ever ventured that far north, so even that gesture toward noninterference was a matter of form rather than of actual caution. Now we know that some Plathys do go that far, on their rite-of-passage wanderings. So it’s a good thing we didn’t simply set up a force field.\n\nI think the closest terrestrial match to the biome there would be the jungles of the Amazon basin. Plus volcanoes, for a little extra heat and interest. Sort of a steam bath with a whiff of sulfur dioxide added to the rich smell of decaying vegetable matter. In the clearings, riots of extravagant flowers, most of which gave off the aroma of rotting meat.\n\nFor the first leg of our journey, we had modern energy weapons hidden inside conventional-looking spears and axes. It would have been more sporting to face the Mesozoic fauna with primitive weapons, but of course we had no interest in that sort of adventure. We often did run into creatures resembling the Deinonychus (Lower Cretaceous period)—about the size of a human but fast, and all claws and teeth. They travel in packs, evidently preying on the large placid herbivores. We never saw fewer than six in a group, and once were cornered by a pack of twenty. We had to kill all of them, our beams silently slashing them into steaming chunks of meat. None paid any attention to what was happening to his comrades but just kept advancing, bent low to the ground, claws out, teeth bared, roaring. Their meat tasted like chicken, but very tough.\n\nIt took us nine days to reach the coast, following a river. (Did I mention that days here are twenty-eight hours long? Our circadian rhythms had been adjusted accordingly, but there are other physiological factors. Mostly having to do with fatigue.) We found a conspicuous rock formation and buried our modern weapons a hundred meters to the north of it. Then we buried their power sources another hundred paces north. We kept one crazer for group defense, to be discarded before we reached the first island, but otherwise all we had was flint and stone and bicuspids with amazing memories.\n\nWe had built several boats with these tools during our training on Selva, but of course it was rather different here. The long day, and no comfortable cot to retire to at night. No tent to keep out the flying insects, no clean soft clothes in the morning, no this, no that. Terrible heat and a pervasive moldy smell that kept us all sniffling in spite of the antiallergenic drugs that our modified endocrine systems fed us. We did manage to get a fire going, which gave us security and roast fish and greatly simplified the boat-building. We felled two large trees and used fire to hollow them out, making outrigger canoes similar to the ones the Maori used to populate the sparse South Pacific. We weren’t able to raise sails, though, since the Plathys don’t have that technology. They wouldn’t have helped much, anyway; summer was usually dead calm. We didn’t look forward to rowing 250 kilometers in the subtropical heat. But we would do it systematically.\n\nHerb was good at pottery, so I exempted him from boat-building in exchange for the fascinating job of crafting and firing dozens of water jugs. That was going to be our main survival problem, since it was not likely to rain during the couple of weeks we’d be at sea. Food was no problem; we could spear fish and probably birds (though eating a raw bird was not an experiment even I could look forward to) and also had a supply of smoked dinosaur.\n\nI designed the boats so that either one would be big enough to carry all twelve of us, in case of trouble. As a further safeguard, we took a shakedown cruise, a night and a day of paddling and staying anchored near shore. We took our last fresh-water bath, topped off the jugs, loaded our gear, and cast off at sundown.\n\nThe idea had been to row all night, with ten minutes’ rest each hour, and keep going for a couple of hours after sunup, for as long as we could reliably gauge our direction from the angle of the sun. Then anchor (the sea was nowhere more than ten or twelve meters deep) and hide from the sun all day under woven shades, fishing and sleeping and engaging in elevated discourse. Start paddling again when the sun was low enough to tell us where north was. It did go that way for several days, until the weather changed.\n\nIt was just a thin haze, but it was enough to stop us dead. We had no navigational instruments, relying on the dim triangle of stars that marked the south celestial pole. No stars, no progress.\n\nThis was when I found out that I had chosen my party well. When the sky cleared two nights later, there was no talk of turning back, though everyone was capable of counting the water jugs and doing long division. A few more days becalmed and we would be in real danger of dying from dehydration, unable to make landfall in either direction.\n\nI figured we had been making about 25 kilometers per night. We rowed harder and cut the break time down to five minutes, and kept rowing an extra hour or so after dawn, taking a chance on dead reckoning.\n\nDaytime became a period of grim silence. People who were not sleeping spent the time fishing the way I had taught them, Eskimo style (though those folks did it through a hole in the ice): arm cocked, spear raised, staring at one point slightly under the surface; when a fish approaches a handspan above that point, let fly the spear. No Eskimo ever applied greater concentration to the task; none of them was ever fishing for water as well as food. Over the course of days we learned which kinds of fish had flesh that could be sucked for moisture, and which had to be avoided for the salty blood that suffused their tissues.\n\nWe rationed water fairly severely, doling it out in measures that would allow us to lose one night out of three to haze. As it turned out, that never happened again, and when we sighted land, finally, there was water enough for another four days of short rations. We stifled the impulse to drink it all in celebration; we still had to find a stream.\n\nI’d memorized maps and satellite photos, but terrain looks much different seen horizontally. It took several hours of hugging the shore before I could figure out where we were; fortunately, the landmark was a broad shallow river.\n\nBefore we threw away the crazer and its power source, we used it to light a torch. When the Plathys traveled, they carried hot coals from the previous night’s fire, insulated in ash inside a basket of tough fiber. We would do the same, rather than spend an hour each day resolutely sawing two pieces of dry wood together. We beached the canoes and hauled them a couple of hundred meters inland, to a stand of bushes where they could be reasonably well camouflaged. Perhaps not much chance they would still be there after a full year, but it was better than simply abandoning them.\n\nWe walked inland far enough for there to be no trace of salt in the muddy river water, and cavorted in it like schoolchildren. Then Brenda and I built a fire while the others stalked out in search of food.\n\nGame was fairly plentiful near the river, but we were not yet skilled hunters. There was no way to move quietly through the grass, which was shoulder-high and stiff. So the hunters who had the best luck were the ones who tiptoed up the bank of the stream. They came back with five good-sized snakes, which we skinned and cleaned and roasted on sticks. After two weeks of raw fish, the sizzling fatty meat was delicious, though for most of us it went through the gut like a dropped rock.\n\nWe made pallets of soft grass, and most of us slept well, though I didn’t. Combination of worry and indigestion. I was awake enough to notice that various couples took advantage of the relative privacy of the riverbank, which made me feel vaguely jealous and deprived. I toyed with the idea of asking somebody, but instead waited for somebody to ask me, and wound up listening to contented snores half the night.\n\nA personal note, to be edited out if this tooth survives for publication. Gabriel. All of us women had been studying his naked body for the past two weeks, quite remarkable in proportion and endowment, and I suppose the younger women had been even more imaginative than me in theorizing about it. So I was a little dismayed when he went off to the riverbank with a male, his Selvan crony Marcus. I didn’t know at the time that their generation on Selva is very casual about such things, and at any rate I should have been anthropologist enough to be objective about it. But I have my own cultural biases, too, and (perhaps more to the point) so do the Terran males in the party. As a scientist, I can appreciate the fact that homosexuality is common and natural and only attitudes about it change. That attitude is not currently very enlightened on Earth; I resolved to warn them the next day to be discreet. (Neither of them is exclusively homosexual, as it turned out; they both left their pallets with women later in the night, Gabriel at least twice.)\n\nWe had rolled two large and fairly dry logs over the fire before bedding down, orienting them so as to take advantage of the slight breeze, and the fire burned brightly all night without attention. That probably saved our lives. When we broke camp in the morning and headed south, we found hundreds of tracks just downwind, the footpads of large catlike creatures. What an idiot I had been, not to post guards! Everyone else was sheepish at not having thought of it themselves. The numb routine and hard labor of the past two weeks had dulled us; now we were properly galvanized by fear. We realized that for all our survival training, we still had the instincts of city folk, and those instincts could kill us all.\n\nThis island is roughly circular, about a hundred kilometers in diameter, with a central crater lake. We would follow this river to the lake and then go counterclockwise to the third stream and follow it to the southern shore. Then we would hop down an archipelago of small islands, another 80 kilometers, to the large island that was our final destination.\n\nThe scrub of the coastal lowland soon gave way to tangled forest, dominated by trees like Earth’s banyan—a large central trunk with dozens or hundreds of subsidiary trunks holding up an extensive canopy of branches. It was impossible to tell where one tree’s territory ended and another’s began, but some of the largest must have commanded one or two ares of ground. Their bark was ashen white, relieved by splotches of rainbow lichen. No direct sunlight reached the ground through their dense foliage; only a few spindly bushes with pale yellow leaves pushed out of the rotting humus. Hard for anything to sneak up on us at ground level, but we could hear creatures moving overhead. I wondered whether the branches were strong enough to support the animals that had watched us the night before, and felt unseen cats’ eyes everywhere.\n\nWe stopped to eat in a weird clearing. Something had killed one of the huge trees; its rotting stump dominated the clearing, and the remnants of its smaller trunks stood around like ghostly guardians, most of them dead but some of them starting to sprout green. I supposed one would eventually take over the space. After feasting on cold snake, we practiced spear-throwing, using the punky old stump as a target. I was the least competent, both in range and accuracy, which had also been the case on Selva. As a girl I’d shown no talent for athletics beyond jacks and playing doctor.\n\nSuddenly all hell broke loose. Three cat-beasts leaped down from the forest canopy behind us and bounded in for the kill. I thrust out my spear and got one in the shoulder, the force of the impact knocking me over. Brenda killed it with a well-aimed throw. The other two checked their advance and circled warily. They dodged thrown spears; I shouted for everyone to hold their fire.\n\nBrenda and I retrieved our weapons and, along with Gabriel and Martin, closed in on the beasts, moving them away from where the thrown spears lay. In a few seconds the twelve of us had them encircled, and I suddenly remembered the old English expression having a tiger by the tail. The beasts were only about half the size of a human, but all muscle and teeth. They growled and snapped at us, heads wagging, saliva drooling.\n\nI shouted Now, Gab!—he was the best shot—and he flung his spear at the closer one. It sank deep in the animal’s side and it fell over, mewling and pawing the air. The other beast saw its chance and leaped straight at Gab, who instinctively ducked under it. It bounded off his back and sprang for the safety of the trees. Six or seven spears showered after it, but missed.\n\nGabriel had four puncture wounds under each shoulder blade from the cat’s claws. Brenda washed them out thoroughly but decided against improvising a dressing out of leaf and vine. Just stay clean, always good advice.\n\nWe skinned and gutted the two cats and laboriously sliced their flesh into long thin strips for jerky. The old stump made a good smoky fire for the purpose. As darkness fell, we built another bright fire next to it.\n\nI set up a guard schedule, with teams of three each standing three-hour shifts while the rest slept, but none of us slept too soundly. Over the crackle of the fires I was sure I could hear things moving restlessly in the woods. If they were there, though, they weren’t bold enough to attack. During my watch a couple of dog-sized animals with large eyes came to the periphery of the clearing, to feast on the cat-beasts’ entrails. We threw sticks at them but they just looked at us, and left after they had eaten their fill.\n\nIf my estimate of our progress was correct, we had about 30 kilometers of deep woods to go, until the topography opened up into rolling hills of grassland. Everyone agreed that we should try to make it in one push. There was no guarantee we could find another clearing, and nobody wanted to spend a night under the canopy. So at first light, we bundled the jerky up inside a stiff catskin and headed south.\n\nAs we moved along the river the nature of the trees changed, the banyans eventually being replaced by a variety of smaller trees—damn! Two of them!\n\nBrenda\n\nI wasn’t paying close attention, still grieving over Mylab—actually, grieving for myself, for having committed murder. I’ve had patients die under my care, but the feeling isn’t even remotely similar. His eyes, when I drew the flint across his throat—they went bright with pain and then immediately dull.\n\nWe’d been walking for about an hour after leaving the cave, picking our way down the north slope of the mountain, when Maria, in the lead, suddenly squatted down and made a silent gesture. We all crouched and moved forward.\n\nAhead of us on the trail, two adult Plathys sat together with their backs to us, talking quietly while they ate. They were armed with spear and broadaxe and knives. I doubted that the six of us could take even one of them in a face-to-face combat.\n\nMaria stared, probably considering ambush, and then motioned for us to go back up the trail. I kept looking over my shoulder, every small scuff and scrape terribly amplified in my mind, expecting at any moment to see the two huge brutes charging after us. But their eating noise must have masked the sound of our retreat.\n\nWe crept back a couple of hundred meters to a fork in the trail and cautiously made our way down a roughly parallel track, going as fast as silence would allow. The light breeze was coming from behind us; we wanted to be past the Plathys—downwind of them—before they finished eating. We passed close enough to hear their talking, but didn’t see them.\n\nAfter about a kilometer the trail disappeared. We had to pick our way down a steep defile and couldn’t help making noise, dislodging pebbles that often cascaded into small rattling avalanches. We were only a few meters from the bottom of the cliff when the two Plathys appeared above us. They discussed the situation loudly for a few moments—using the hunting language, which none of us had been allowed to learn—and then set aside their weapons in favor of rocks.\n\nWhen I saw what they were doing I slid right to the bottom, willing to take a few abrasions rather than present too tempting a target. Most of the others did the same. Herb took a glancing blow to the head and fell backward, landing roughly. I ran over to him, afraid he was unconscious. Gab beat me to him and hauled him roughly to his feet; he was dazed but awake. We each took an arm and staggered away as fast as we could, zigzagging as Gab muttered go left and right, so as to present a more difficult target. I sustained one hard blow to the left buttock, which knocked me down. It was going to make sitting uncomfortable, but we wouldn’t have to worry about that for a while.\n\nWe were lucky the Plathys hadn’t brought rope, as a larger hunting party in the mountains would have done. They are rather clumsy rock climbers (though with their long arms they can run up a steep slope very fast). One of them started down after us, but after a nearly fatal slip he scrambled back up.\n\nWe pressed our advantage, such as it was. To pursue us they would have to make a detour of a couple of kilometers, and at any rate we could go downhill faster than they could. It seemed likely that they would instead go back to their main group to report our whereabouts, and then all of them try to catch us in the veldt. On level ground they could easily run us down, once they caught our scent.\n\nMaria, xenologist to the end, remarked how lucky we were that they had never developed the idea of signal drums. It is strange, since they use such a variety of percussion instruments in their music and dancing.\n\nSuch music and dancing. They seemed so human.\n\nOur only chance for survival was to try to confuse them by splitting up. Maria breathlessly outlined a plan as we hurried down the slope. When we reached the valley we would get a bearing on the stream we’d followed here, then go six different ways, rendezvousing at the stream’s outlet to the sea three days later; at nightfall, whoever was there would cross to the next island. Even at high tide it should be possible to wade most of the way.\n\nI suggested we make it three pairs rather than six loners, but Maria pointed out that two of us really didn’t stand a much better chance against an armed Plathy than one; in either case, the only way we could kill them would be by stealth. Murder. I told her I didn’t think I would be able to do it, and she nodded. Probably thinking that she would have said the same thing a few days ago.\n\nWe stopped for a few minutes to rest on a plateau overlooking the veldt, where Maria pointed out the paths she wanted each of us to take. Herb and Derek would go the most direct route, more or less north, but twining in and out of each other’s path so as to throw off the scent. Gab, being the fastest, would run halfway around the mountain, then make a broad arc north. She would go straight northeast for about half the distance and then cut back; Martin would do the opposite. I was to head due west, straight for the stream, and follow it down, in and out of the water. All of us were to leave scent at the places where our paths diverged the most from straight north.\n\nA compass would have been nice. At night we’d be okay if it didn’t cloud up again, but during the day we’d just have to follow our direction bump through the tall grass. I was glad I had an easy path.\n\nNot all that easy. The three water bladders went to the ones who would be farthest from the stream, of course. So I had to go a good half day without water. Assuming I didn’t get lost. We divided the food and scrambled down in six different directions.\n\nMaria\n\nWhere was I? Coming here, we got around the crater lake without incident, but the descent to the shore was more difficult than I had anticipated. It was not terribly steep, but the dense undergrowth of vines and bushes impeded our progress. After two days we emerged on the shore, covered with scratches and bruises. At least we’d encountered no large fauna.\n\n(By this time I had a great deal of sympathy for the lazybones minority on the Planning Committee who’d contended that we were being overly cautious in putting the base so far from the Plathy island. They’d recommended we put it on this island, with only 80 kilometers of shallow sea separating us from our destination. I’d voted, along with the majority, for the northern mainland, partly out of a boneheaded desire for adventure.)\n\nWhat we faced was a chain of six small islands and countless sandbars, in a puddle of a sea that rarely was more than a meter deep. We knew from Garcia’s experience that a boat would be useless. With vine and driftwood we lashed together a raft to carry our weapons and provisions, filled the water jugs, and splashed south.\n\nIt was tiring. The sand underfoot was firm, but sloshing through the shallow water was like walking with heavy weights attached to your ankles. We had to make good progress, though; the only island we were sure had fresh water was 40 kilometers south, halfway.\n\nWe made a good 25 kilometers the first day, dragging our weary bones up onto an island that actually had trees. Marcus and Gab went off in search of water, finding none, while the rest of us gathered driftwood for a fire or tried lackadaisically to fish. Nanci speared a gruesome thing that no one would touch, including her, and nobody else caught anything. Susan and Brenda dug up a couple of dozen shellfish, though, which obediently popped open when roasted. They tasted like abalone with sulfur sauce."
