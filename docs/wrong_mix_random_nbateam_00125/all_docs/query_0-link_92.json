Well, besides having a way bigger backyard and a better surround sound system than you and me, they have all shared screen time or worked alongside me, the unknown hero of our story, Larkin Campbell.\n\nLarkin Campbell is a small-town kid at heart and always will be. He was raised in the tiny, but spectacular mountain town of Estes Park, Colorado. He grew up playing stick-ball in the street, performing in high school plays and working on the school newspaper. Him and his band of lunatic friends started a comedic dance group aptly named, “CAMPBELL’S CRAZY CREW”. They performed at high school basketball games, pep rallies and cheerleader camps until they realized nobody was still watching. He moved to Washington to attend Tacoma Community College and lived with his father in a gorgeous little harbor town named Gig Harbor. He studied acting and journalism before transferring east across the state to attend Washington State University. While there, he perfected the art of procrastination and tomfoolery while studying Broadcast Journalism and Theatre. While visiting Los Angeles on spring break of his senior year at WSU, he put in a request for an internship at the hit TV show Entertainment Tonight. His request was granted and upon graduation, he headed for the bright lights of the big city.\n\nHe spent many years working as a stand-in and photo double on dozens of big budget movies such as ARMEGEDDON, LETHAL WEAPON 4, MYSTERY MEN, ESCAPE FROM LA, HARD RAIN and dozens more. All the while hustling down agents and casting directors and anyone who would give him a look. He joined the Screen Actors Guild in 1995, and has never stopped chasing down the next role or opportunity. His hard work has paid off in dozens of roles in film and TV. Highlights include guest starring roles on CSI: NY, LAS VEGAS, CRIMINAL MINDS and a bucket list supporting role playing COACH SHANE, opposite Steve Carell and Ed Helms in THE OFFICE. His multiple film career highlights include playing HR HALDEMAN, in the highly acclaimed Clint Eastwood film, J EDGAR. He has written, produced and starred in over 25 short films and video projects which have gone on to win many awards at film festivals all over the country. His work has been published in multiple parenting magazines, describing the life of a stay-at-home-parent, trying to juggle the rigorous life of an actor. He recently chronicled his 30-year career in a hilarious and heartfelt memoir titled, A VIEW FROM THE MIDDLE. How an unknown actor managed to stay that way.

They were among the thousands of people-young and old, singers, dancers, jugglers, mimes, and more – lined up to audition for NBC’s America’s Got Talent. It would take several more hours for Landau to finally get inside and sing a few bars, and his day grew even longer as he sang for one producer after another. Soon, he was the last one sitting in a huge rehearsal hall. “I knew that was a good sign,” remembers Jennifer.\n\nThe rest as they say is history. Despite going from washrags to riches, “I’m still happiest when I’m with my family,” says Landau. “I like it when there is no stress and I’m doing what I want to do-which is to sing.”\n\nWatch Zoom Into Books Interview with co-author Rick Robinson and Guest Interviewer Burke Allen\n\neBook Available HERE\n\nClick Here - From Washing Cars to Hollywood Star\n\nClick here to watch Landau Eugene Murphy, Jr - Live in Logan!\n\nClick here to purchase the author's books.\n\nFor More Information Visit https://www.landaumurphyjr.com/\n\nLeonard, Coleman, and Blunt have been around the world and back again several times each as the lead singers of three of the most legendary vocal groups of all time: the Temptations, Platters, and Drifters. The three Washington, DC natives have a back story right out of a Hollywood movie; Leonard, Coleman & Blunt grew up singing together in church and on street corners throughout the 1960s before finding fame and fortune separately, then reuniting after 30 years to harmonize together once again.\n\nGlenn Leonard and his sweet tenor voice joined Motown’s legendary Temptations, recording ten hit albums, touring the world, and singing lead on many of their 1970s and 1980s R&B hits.

He served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and Assistant Chief Counsel of the Senate Watergate Committee in addition to his years in private practice. His clients have included General William C. Westmoreland, John and Maureen Dean in a libel suit against G. Gordon Liddy and others, and a corporation (IMIC) owned by the Hunt brothers and Arab sheiks during the collapse of the silver market. He is the author of several books including The Unexpected Scalia: A Conservative Justice's Liberal Opinions and a novel, Moses v. Trump.\n\nDavid Dorsen's book, Judicial Mayhem, is extraordinary and almost certainly unique. He tells the story of Michael Lauer, who came to this country in 1971 at the age of 15 from behind Russia's Iron Curtain penniless and speaking no English. Lauer worked his way through the City College of New York by driving a taxicab, entered the world of finance, and succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. Lauer made his fortune the hard way, honestly. But, as Dorsen explains, Lauer's dream became a nightmare, when an overzealous Securities and Exchange Commission and misguided Department of Justice targeted him. The American judicial system failed Lauer by trashing the rule of law. -- John W.

What started as almost a clean sweep of nearly 50 pageant victories from age seven in a small Texas town quickly evolved into seven seasons in Orlando on the Disney Channel’s wildly popular The All-New Mickey Mouse Club in the late ‘80s well into the ‘90s, which Jennifer describes as a sort of “‘Saturday Night Live’ for kids” featuring interviews, skits, variety show-styled razzle dazzle, and of course, loads of singing. A quick internet search shows her performing alongside a slew of internationally renowned stars --Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera-- and throughout a real time conversation, she just as casually mentions how Michael Jackson used to visit the set as a major fan of their show or the time when Celine Dion helped calm her nerves prior to an inauguration performance for President Bill Clinton at the Kennedy Center.\n\nWatch Video HERE\n\nFor more information visit https://www.jennifermcgill.com/\n\nFilm and television writer/director/cartoonist/voice actor/author/musician\n\nDave, an award winning film and television writer, cartoonist, author, musician, voice actor and freak nerd, has had his writing compared to the likes of Ray Bradbury and David Lynch and his cartoon work to that of Charles Schulz, one of Dave’s idols.
