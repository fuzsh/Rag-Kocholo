It was an unexpected experience, therefore, to encounter true humility and modesty among the Nobel laureates featured in this book. Drs. Joseph Goldstein, Michael Brown, Robert Lefkowitz, and Harold Varmus tended to attribute their many successes to good fortune, in addition to the positive influences of their mentors, rather than to their own evident and considerable abilities. They were candid in relating personal stories to help illuminate the “Golden Era” when they served together as trainees at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Asking them to recall events that occurred a half-century ago was an unfair test of their memories. Nevertheless, the clarity with which they all remembered their stints at NIH only served to underscore how vital those few years were to each of them.\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nParenthetically, it should be noted that the experience of having four Nobel laureates read and critique one’s work can be more than a little intimidating. To my great relief, these distinguished scientists could not have been kinder or more generous with their thoughtful suggestions. When the writing lagged at times, the unsolicited chorus of enthusiasm and encouragement from these masters was a powerful motivator to complete the project. I benefited from an up-close and personal view of the coaching skills this quartet of effective mentors provided to literally hundreds of aspiring investigators. The two surviving NIH mentors, Drs. Ira Pastan and Jesse Roth, were equally helpful in sharing their personal recollections about their Nobel Prize–winning trainees, Harold Varmus and Bob Lefkowitz. Well into their eighties, both Pastan and Roth remain active researchers and continue to mentor young scientists who follow in the footsteps of Varmus and Lefkowitz. Others who were NIH Associates at the same time, including Drs. Thomas Caskey, Maximilian Buja, Mahlon DeLong, and Thomas Boat, all of whom went on to very distinguished academic careers, kindly shared their NIH memories as well. Dr. William Lovejoy, who was a few years ahead of Bob Lefkowitz and Harold Varmus at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, also generously offered his recollections of their days together. An invaluable resource to this project was the Office of NIH History, which provided access to previously conducted oral histories, the Clinical Associate program application cards for the four protagonists, and photographs of the mentors and facilities. Helpful advice and guidance were provided by the founding director of the Office of NIH History, Dr. Victoria Harden, as well as Christopher Wanjek, director of communications of the Office of Intramural Research. Barbara Harkins, the office’s librarian/archivist, spent many hours searching for relevant material, and Michele Lyons, the curator of the Office of NIH History and the Stetten Museum, provided additional support. The prior interviews of NIH Clinical Associates conducted by Melissa Klein and Drs. Buhm Soon Park and Sandeep Khot provided a rich detail of background information. Dr. Alan Schechter, NIH senior historical consultant and chief of the Molecular Medicine Branch of the National Institute of\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDiabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, was kind enough to share his many insights into the Clinical Associate program. The Board of Regents of the University of Texas System and two chancellors, William McRaven and J. B. Milliken, allowed me the time and support needed to research and write this book. It is a privilege to work for leaders who view scholarship as a possible route to salvation for an aging educational bureaucrat. The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, the academic home of Drs. Goldstein and Brown, provided generous financial support for the publication of this book. My thanks go to President Daniel Podolsky and Executive Vice President for Business Affairs Arnim Dontes for helping to identify the necessary funding. My very capable and perennially cheerful executive assistant, Trisha Meloncon, did yeoman’s work in transcribing the interviews, collecting permissions for the reproduction of photographs, and incorporating multiple iterations of edits. Without her loyal support this project would not have been possible. The University of Texas Press, under the leadership of David Hamrick, embraced this project with enthusiasm and helped to bring it across the finish line. Robert Kimzey, managing editor at the University of Texas Press, served capably as the project manager, and the copy editor, Jon Howard, drew the short straw to guide me through the developmental editing process. With great ardor I thank my wife, Leah, for her sacrifices of time and companionship that allowed this book to be written. She was the first person to read and critique the text, and in so doing she reaffirmed, once again, the wisdom of marrying an English major. The story of the “Yellow Berets” and their contributions to the advancement of science and medicine is one of the most remarkable and underappreciated chapters in American history. The stories of these four Nobel doctors—Goldstein, Brown, Lefkowitz, and Varmus—can inspire a new generation of accidental scientists to stand on the shoulders of such giants. Raymond S.

Kennedy at the White House was on Sunday, April 29, 1962. The event honored living Nobel Prize winners from the Western Hemisphere, and among the 177 guests, forty-nine Nobel laureates attended along with other luminaries in the arts and sciences. Scheduled at the height of the Cold War, the evening’s subtext was American dominance in science and technology. In the first six decades since the Nobel Prize was awarded beginning in 1901, seventy-six Americans had been so honored—more than any other nation and accounting for nearly a quarter of all laureates. Russia could muster only eight recipients. This celebration came about a year after the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human in outer space. The Kennedy administration was eager to spotlight America’s heroes in science. Invitees included the writers James Baldwin, John Dos Passos, Katherine Anne Porter, William\n\nxiv\n\nPrologue\n\nStyron, Lionel Trilling, and Robert Frost, the nuclear physicist Robert Oppenheimer, and John Glenn, who just two months earlier had followed Gagarin into space and successfully orbited the earth. Another guest, the 1954 laureate in Chemistry, Linus Pauling, had that weekend protested along with 3,000 others outside the White House against the resumption of atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons by the United States. Earlier that Sunday, Pauling, carrying a placard with a message to Kennedy and the British prime minister Harold Macmillan (“we have no right to test”), managed to change into blacktie attire by eight o’clock. The president greeted Pauling at the door with a smile and his familiar wry sense of humor: “I understand you’ve been around the White House for a couple of days already.” Pauling, who soon would win a second Nobel for contributions to Peace, acknowledged as much. President Kennedy was gracious in reply: “I hope you will continue to express your feelings.” 1 The evening is remembered for Kennedy’s toast to laureates, departing from remarks prepared by the Harvard historian and special assistant to the president Arthur Schlesinger Jr.: I want to tell you how welcome you are in the White House. I think that this is the most extraordinary collection of talent, of human knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\n\nLater in the toast, Kennedy again spoke unscripted, expressing the hope that the dinner would also “encourage young Americans and young people in this hemisphere to develop the same drive and deep desire for knowledge and peace.” 2 Kennedy, a month shy of his forty-fifth birthday, was a big believer in the powers of both technology and bold visions. Three weeks after Gagarin’s spaceflight, the president stood before a joint session of Congress and famously declared: “I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth.” Now, his broader charge to the next generation of Americans was equally audacious. Many of those who would bring Kennedy’s Nobel vision to reality had no idea\n\nPrologue\n\nthat they would become scientists—much less Nobel laureates. Among the unsuspecting future researchers were three college seniors and a firstyear English literature graduate student. Joe Goldstein, a native of rural Kingstree, South Carolina, was nearing graduation as the valedictorian at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Mike Brown, raised in the Philadelphia suburbs, was preparing to graduate at the top of his class at the University of Pennsylvania, where he briefly served as editor of the student newspaper. Bob Lefkowitz, a hometown prodigy from the High School of Science in the Bronx, was about to graduate from Columbia University at nineteen. All three were chemistry majors and aspired to be practicing physicians, and none had any mentored research experience. The graduate student among this quartet was Harold Varmus, who was struggling between pursuing a passion for English literature versus following his father’s path into medicine. Varmus grew up on the South Shore of Long Island and matriculated at Amherst College, where he majored in English literature (and barely survived a premed prerequisite in organic chemistry). Even though he won a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to attend graduate school at Harvard, Varmus soon became disenchanted with the program there and applied to medical school. As with Goldstein, Brown, and Lefkowitz, Varmus avoided any opportunity to pursue laboratory research experience, anticipating a career in patient care. All four young men were stellar undergraduates and were admitted to excellent medical schools. Goldstein, the lone southerner in the group, made a last-minute decision to attend Southwestern Medical College of the University of Texas. Brown remained at the University of Pennsylvania, and Lefkowitz and Varmus became classmates at Columbia University’s College of Physicians and Surgeons. All four finished at or among the very top of their medical school classes in 1966, securing clinical training positions at two of the premier teaching hospitals in the country. Goldstein and Brown became fellow interns at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, and Lefkowitz and Varmus stayed at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in New York City.3 All four anticipated futures as professors at medical schools, primarily serving as clinicians and teachers. They thought that they might dabble in research but had\n\nxv\n\nxvi\n\nPrologue\n\nonly vague notions of what that would entail and saw it as more of a sidelight than a primary focus. With the Vietnam War escalating in 1966, all four (as well as other newly minted physicians nationwide) faced the likelihood of being drafted involuntarily into military service. Since the Korean War, there was a mandatory draft of physicians in order to meet the medical needs of the United States Armed Services. There were few viable alternatives, but one especially attractive option was selection for a two-year commission to conduct basic research and care for patients at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. With a handful of positions available and thousands of highly motivated applicants, admission into the NIH Associate program was, at best, a long shot. Although Goldstein, Brown, Lefkowitz, and Varmus all had sterling academic credentials, their paucity of research experience did not bode well for their selection. Fortunately for them, and for the NIH, all four managed to find an interested staff scientist who saw a reason to bring them aboard. This quartet of rising stars arrived at the NIH in July 1968, a period when the country seemed to be coming apart at the seams. The Vietnam War saw an alarming rise in casualties, and antiwar street protests roiled campuses and divided the nation. Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., the civil rights icon and movement leader, was assassinated in Memphis that April, sparking violent riots in at least ten major cities, including the nation’s capital. In June, the United States senator and Democratic presidential candidate Robert Kennedy had been gunned down in Los Angeles, just five years after his older brother met a similar fate in Dallas. Come August, with November’s presidential election in the balance, the Democratic National Convention in Chicago was stained by bloodshed, the result of a police crackdown on protesters. Amid the chaos and uncertainty, four young physicians were introduced into a different world—the compelling, challenging, and exciting pursuit of medical research. Brown and Goldstein used “Golden Era” to describe the NIH at that time.4 Five of its senior scientists would go on to win Nobels in their own right, the first going to Marshall Nirenberg only a few months after the four Clinical Associates arrived. Three more NIH investigators would win the Nobel in the following eight years: Julius Axelrod (1970),\n\nPrologue\n\nChristian Anfinsen (1972), and Carleton Gajdusek (1976). It would be another eighteen years before another NIH scientist, Martin Rodbell, was selected in 1994. He would be the last scientist employed by NIH so honored. To the extent that Nobel awards are markers of achievement in science, there is little question that NIH was a prodigious contributor during the 1960s and 1970s. The matching of brilliant basic scientists with a cadre of gifted physician trainees occurred in an environment at NIH that was wellresourced, collaborative, and open to people, such as religious and ethnic minorities, who often felt less welcome on traditional university campuses. The period also marked a revolution in biomedical research, as technological advances were made in the methods used to isolate, purify, and study important biological molecules such as proteins and genes. Indeed, a high percentage of the physicians who would become future leaders in American medicine trained at the NIH during those halcyon years. As Goldstein and Brown pointed out, nine future Nobel laureates were trained at the Bethesda campus between 1964 and 1972.5 Even more remarkable, the class that entered in 1968, including Brown, Goldstein, Lefkowitz, and Varmus, accounted for nearly half of the total number of future Nobel laureates to date. The Vietnam War left deep wounds—physical and emotional—on a generation of Americans. If there is a silver lining to the war, perhaps it is the unforeseen salutary effect it had on bringing some of the brightest minds of that generation into scientific careers. Collectively, this group of former Public Health Service6 Commissioned Officers is referred to by the nickname “Yellow Berets,” an obvious counterpoint to the celebrated Green Berets—the US Army’s Special Forces troops in Vietnam. Although Goldstein, Brown, Lefkowitz, and Varmus are too modest to stake the claim, a credible argument can be made that their work made possible many of the advances in medical care over the past quarter-century. Brown and Goldstein formed a lasting partnership, still thriving five decades later, that led to fundamental discoveries about how cholesterol levels are controlled within the body. Their work helped to pave the way for the popular statin drugs that are improving the lives of those who have or are at high risk of developing heart disease. Varmus teamed\n\nxvii\n\nxviii\n\nPrologue\n\nup with another former Yellow Beret, Michael Bishop, and discovered how a normal gene can be altered and give rise to cancer. Their findings opened the door to more precise cancer treatments that target specific underlying genetic defects. Lefkowitz, for his part, characterized the molecules on the surfaces of cells that recognize members of a large class of chemical messengers, triggering the appropriate biological responses. His insights helped to advance the development of medications for treating a multitude of conditions ranging from allergies, to heartburn, to diabetes, to heart disease, to cancer. The awarding of the Nobel Prize for each of these discoveries provides objective evidence of the importance that experts in the field attach to such work. There are many accolades given for scientific accomplishment, but none has the history, global visibility, prestige, pomp, and ceremony associated with the Nobel Prize. Established by Alfred Nobel, a Swedish inventor and explosives manufacturer, in his 1895 will, the series of annual awards was intended to honor work that conveyed “the greatest benefit to mankind.” Virtually all of Nobel’s fortune was bequeathed to create the prizes in five specified domains: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace (a sixth area—Economics—was added in 1968 with financial support from the Bank of Sweden). A foundation was created to manage the operational aspects of the prizes (but not the actual selection of recipients). For the award in Physiology or Medicine, the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm is assigned the responsibility for choosing the honoree(s), whereas the other scientific prizes are selected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901 and have been granted annually since then, with the exception of interruptions during World War I and World War II. For all of the hoopla over the announcement of winners, few are household names. The best-known recipients in Physiology or Medicine include Ivan Pavlov (digestion, 1904), Robert Koch (tuberculosis, 1905), Alexander Fleming (penicillin, 1945), and James Watson and Francis Crick (structure of DNA, 1962). Although the identities of honorees and the technical details of the work may be unfamiliar outside scientific circles, the impact of the discoveries is easier to appreciate, at least in retrospect. Some of the featured areas of innovation in Physiology or Medicine include the discovery of insulin, the\n\nPrologue\n\ndevelopment of key technologies such as the electrocardiogram, computed tomographic and nuclear magnetic imaging, the identification of blood groups, the introduction of high-impact procedures such as heart catheterization and in vitro fertilization, and the determination of causes of disease such as the human immunodeficiency virus. In Physiology or Medicine, the selection process is overseen by an assembly of fifty professors at the Karolinska Institutet, with a five-member committee that screens nominations and selects candidates. Sometimes, potential recipients are excluded because they do not meet the award guidelines. For example, Nobel rules do not permit an award to someone who has not been nominated, regardless of how deserving that individual may be. This has been suggested as one of the contributing reasons for the underrepresentation of female laureates. Another exclusion factor is a prohibition against posthumous recognition. So, when Rosalyn Yalow was selected in 1977, her deceased colleague, Solomon Berson, who partnered on the prize-winning work on radioimmunoassay, was not designated as a corecipient. Similarly, only three honorees are permitted in any prize category in a single year, which is increasingly challenging as science becomes more of a team sport. Deliberations in the selection process are maintained under strict confidentiality for fifty years, so the underlying rationale for inclusion or exclusion of any potential candidate remains shrouded in mystery for generations. Even with all of these constraints, the Nobel Prize still remains the worldwide gold standard for scientific achievement. Part of its appeal is its longevity, now well into its second century. It also benefits from the halo effect of past winners—a virtual Who’s Who of Scientific Heroes, including such revered historical figures as Ernest Rutherford, Marie Curie, Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Neils Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and Enrico Fermi. To be associated with these giants, if only in an indirect way, provides an enduring legacy for each awardee. Then there is the masterful and media-savvy manner in which the announcements of winners are made in October every year. Each discipline has its own designated day, and collectively there is a full week of global attention to the awards. Finally, there is the incomparable pageantry of the award ceremony itself, held every year on December\n\nxix\n\nxx\n\nPrologue\n\n10—the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel. The white-tie ceremonies are hosted at the resplendent Stockholm Concert Hall, followed by an elaborate banquet at the Stockholm City Hall. The prizes are presented to honorees by the king of Sweden, with each winner receiving a gold medal emblazoned with the image of Nobel, as well as an ornate diploma. A handsome cash award, currently valued in excess of $1 million, is provided in each discipline and divided if there are multiple recipients. The mystique of the Nobel Prize and the work that underpins the honored discoveries have inspired popular books on the subject. Perhaps the best known is The Double Helix, the autobiographical account of the discovery of the structure of DNA by James Watson.7 Of more immediate relevance here is the excellent autobiography written by Harold Varmus, The Art and Politics of Science, 8 and the equally entertaining memoir How to Win the Nobel Prize, written by his colleague and corecipient Michael Bishop.9 Both of these accounts are invaluable sources for this book and are recommended highly to the reader who is interested in a firsthand perspective on the experience of becoming a Nobel laureate. Goldstein, Brown, and Lefkowitz have yet to pen their own autobiographies, but they have been generous in sharing their personal stories in various articles and interviews. These publications proved helpful in constructing this synthesis and are commended to the reader.10 The article written by Goldstein and Brown on the NIH’s Golden Era drew attention in scientific circles to the remarkable cohort of future Nobel laureates who trained at the institutes on the Bethesda campus and posed a question: “Was there something particular about these recipients, the time, and the place that account for this unprecedented record?”11 They mention many contributing factors they deem important, namely, the involuntary draft that funneled top medical students to the NIH; the focus of the research experience on fundamental biological processes; and especially the rigor of the NIH’s veteran scientists who served as mentors. Interestingly enough, three senior researchers (Marshall Nirenberg, Earl Stadtman, and Ira Pastan) oversaw two each of the nine future Nobel awardees. Others have attempted to characterize circumstances associated with the development of Nobel laureates. Arguably, the most influential study of this topic was published by Harriet Zuckerman in 1977.12\n\nPrologue\n\nThen a sociology professor at Columbia University and later a senior vice president at the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Zuckerman studied the lives of all American Nobel laureates selected between 1907 and 1972. Of the fifty-six honorees, Zuckerman conducted personal interviews with forty-one, creating a rich trove of information that she described as a “group biography.” Not surprisingly, given her disciplinary background, Zuckerman approached her research subjects from the perspective of the social organization and operation of the world of science. Key findings from Zuckerman’s work were that Nobel laureates show early promise and tend to be educated at a small number of prestigious private and public universities. Often, they served apprenticeships with prior recipients, learning how to choose and approach important topics, how to adhere to the highest research standards, and how to develop self-assurance, especially when facing uncertainty and criticism from others. Future Nobelists tend to begin publishing early and in greater volume than peers. This entire picture of early success led Zuckerman to propose that the laureates benefit from “the accumulation of advantage: the spiraling of augmented achievements and rewards for individuals and a system of stratifications that is sharply graded.”13 More than four decades have passed since Zuckerman’s study. And though many aspects of the socialization process that she documented likely persist in the upper ranks of scientists, there have been some significant changes to the research landscape that affect how scientific leaders emerge. Some of these trends include older ages at which training is completed14 and first grants are awarded,15 heightened competition for grant funding,16 declining percentages of physicians pursuing careers in research,17 the emergence of a new breed of research universities, particularly on the West Coast,18 the rise of “Big Science,” which requires large, interdisciplinary research teams,19 and the expansion of industry-funded research and a parallel emphasis on ownership of intellectual property.20 The extent to which any of these factors (and others) shape the current and future scientific elite remains to be determined. To some extent, Zuckerman’s work can be updated by a close examination of the Yellow Berets, who were being trained just when the last of her Nobel laureates were being chosen. All nine of the NIH Associates who later won Nobel Prizes are worthy of consideration, but an\n\nxxi\n\nxxii\n\nPrologue\n\nattempt to cover the full cohort in a single book would fail to do justice to any one of them. Out of respect for both the laureates and the reader, this book is confined to the four Yellow Berets who arrived at the NIH in 1968. In recounting their odysseys and trying to weave together their storylines in a coherent narrative, this book is organized into three sections. The opening chapters in Part I (“Soldiers for Science”) build our foundation by describing the circumstances that brought the four trainees to the NIH and the environment they entered. The middle chapters in Part II (“Mentors and Apprentices”) represent the beating heart of the story, covering mentors and the research these four Yellow Berets conducted while at NIH. The final chapters in Part III (“Four Laureates”) covers their days after NIH leading up to, but not beyond, the award of their respective Nobel Prizes. The intent throughout is to illuminate the science and its implications for medicine without becoming immersed in technical jargon and concepts. As the reader will appreciate, there is no single uniform path to great achievement—whether scientific or otherwise. Although each story is unique, there are some commonalities and themes that emerge. To the extent that these personal histories reveal larger truths about the NIH in the 1960s and 1970s—and more generally what it takes to prepare young people to achieve the highest levels of performance—this book humbly extends President Kennedy’s 1962 challenge to yet another generation of young Americans.\n\nPART I\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nTHIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK\n\nC HAP TER 1\n\nANNUS HORRIBILIS 1968 and America’s Conflict on Two Fronts\n\nFor President Lyndon Johnson, Vietnam was an unwanted distraction from his ambitious social agenda, known as the Great Society. In late May 1964, with America’s commitment still limited to providing advisers, financing, and matériel, Johnson made clear his reservations about Vietnam to Special Assistant for National Security Affairs McGeorge Bundy: “It looks to me that we’re getting into another Korea. It just worries the hell out of me. I don’t see what we can ever hope to get out of there with once we’re committed. I believe that the Chinese Communists are coming into it.” Johnson added prophetically: “I don’t think it is worth fighting for and I don’t think we can get out. And it’s just the biggest damn mess I ever saw.”1 About two months later, a limited exchange of fire ten miles off the coast of North Vietnam turned into a critical test of Johnson’s reservations. On August 2, an American destroyer, the USS Maddox, operating\n\n4\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nin international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, was monitoring North Vietnamese radar and electronic transmissions. Suspecting that the US ship was engaged in naval commando raids occurring along the coast for several months, three patrol boats from the North Vietnamese Navy pursued and fired on the Maddox.2 The Maddox was unscathed in the attack, but two days later a second incident occurred or, more accurately, was thought to have occurred. The crews of the Maddox and a second destroyer, the USS Turner Joy, mistakenly interpreted phantom radar images as an indication that they were under another torpedo-boat attack. The suspected second attack was communicated to military leaders back in Washington, but further assessments from the Gulf of Tonkin over the next several hours raised serious doubts about the credibility of initial reports.3 Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, reflecting on this incident, observed: “It was just confusion, and events afterwards showed that our judgment that we’d been attacked that day was wrong.”4 To some extent, a rush to judgment and action may have been influenced by events two weeks earlier at the 1964 Republican National Convention in Daly City, California, where Arizona’s hawkish senator, Barry Goldwater, was chosen as the GOP presidential candidate. In his acceptance speech, Goldwater declared: “Yesterday it was Korea; tonight it is Vietnam. Make no bones of this. Don’t try to sweep this under the rug. We are at war in Vietnam. And yet the president, who is commander in chief of our forces, refuses to say, refuses to say, mind you, whether or not the objective over there is victory, and his secretary of defense continues to mislead and misinform the American people.” 5 As midnight approached on August 4, mere hours after reports about the second confrontation, President Johnson announced via nationwide broadcast his conclusion that American forces had been attacked on multiple occasions and would respond accordingly. Johnson stated: “Repeated acts of violence against the armed forces of the United States must be met not only with alert defense, but with positive reply. The reply is being given as I speak to you tonight.”6 A series of air strikes were launched against North Vietnamese attack boats and other targets. Of much greater consequence was the socalled Gulf of Tonkin Resolution: at the president’s behest, the United\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\nStates Congress, with only two dissenting votes in the Senate and none in the House, rushed to authorize the president, without a formal declaration of war, “as Commander in Chief, to take all necessary measures to repeal any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent any further aggression.” It went on to authorize the president to “take all necessary steps, including the use of armed force, to assist any member or protocol state of the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty requesting assistance in defense of its freedom.”7 This gave Johnson the political cover necessary for direct American military intervention in Vietnam. Three months later, the presidential election resulted in a landslide victory for Johnson, who received more than 60 percent of the popular vote and 90 percent of the Electoral College. With this mandate and the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in his back pocket, Johnson’s military advisers urged him to expand the US role in Vietnam. The government in Saigon (South Vietnam) was unstable and ineffective. It’s military, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, was losing territory, and, not surprisingly, troop morale was very low. Yet Johnson hesitated. He was not particularly concerned about fighting North Vietnam, which he characterized in private as a “raggedy-ass fourth-rate country.” 8 Johnson’s recurring nightmare was that sympathetic communist governments in Beijing and Moscow would come to the aid of the North Vietnamese and that the war would escalate into a showdown between nuclear-armed superpowers. Meanwhile, North Vietnam’s communist National Liberation Front, commonly known as the Vietcong (VC), had a sizable force in South Vietnam allied with the North. The Vietcong controlled substantial areas of countryside in the South, and VC guerrilla warfare tactics were taking an increasing toll. A series of VC attacks on American military bases in February 1965 finally convinced President Johnson that he had to increase US pressure, starting with airstrikes against North Vietnamese Army (NVA) camps. The knockout punch was supposed to be a massive air operation code-named “Rolling Thunder.” Launched on March 2, 1965, the initial targets of Rolling Thunder were supply lines just north of the border that were used to transport men and matériel in support of VC insurgents in the South. In addition\n\n5\n\n6\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nto the tactical objective of disrupting and degrading the opposition forces, the strategic goal was to demoralize the enemy through a massive show of force and determination.9 Over time, the bombing expanded to military and industrial targets throughout North Vietnam, enemy-held targets in South Vietnam, and regions in neighboring Laos and Cambodia. The major cities of Hanoi and Haiphong, with their large civilian populations, and the border area near China were spared. Rolling Thunder was undertaken on a scale unprecedented in military history. Between 1965 and 1967 alone, the United States dropped more bombs than during the entire Korean War or the Pacific campaign in World War II.10 Rolling Thunder was estimated to have destroyed three-quarters of all ammunition depots, more than half of North Vietnam’s power plants and bridges, and 10,000 military vehicles.11 In spite of this devastation, the bombing was unsuccessful in breaking the fighting spirit and capabilities of the North Vietnamese and the Vietcong. The initial commitment of US ground troops to the war effort began on March 8, 1965, when 3,500 Marines from the 9th Expeditionary Brigade were deployed to protect the air base at Da Nang. Three months later, for the first time, US troops engaged the Vietcong in combat. On July 28, President Johnson announced at a noon press conference at the White House that he would authorize sending forty-four combat battalions to Vietnam. His public words made it evident this decision weighed upon him: “I do not find it easy to send the flower of our youth, our finest young men, into battle.” He added: “I think I know, too, how their mothers weep and how their families sorrow.”12 Even as he commenced the ground war, Johnson had doubts about the prospects for victory. Speaking privately to his press secretary, Bill Moyers, Johnson confessed: “Light at the end of the tunnel? We don’t even have a tunnel; we don’t even know where the tunnel is.”13 The die was cast, however, and within five months US troop levels had reached nearly 185,000, almost sixfold more than a year earlier. By the end of 1966, there were more than 385,000, with another 100,000 added in 1967.14 As the US troop presence grew, so did the number of casualties. In 1965, US forces suffered about 6,000 nonfatal injuries and nearly 1,400 deaths. In 1966, the number of wounded was five times higher and the number killed nearly four times higher. And in\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\n1967—with fighting in Vietnam at its peak—60,000 Americans were wounded and more than 9,000 killed.15 This was roughly 70 percent more than the total nonmilitary deaths of eighteen- and nineteen-yearold males back home.16 The gruesome numbers were weighing heavily upon the nation. As the fighting expanded and intensified more than 8,000 miles away, Americans at home had a front-row seat to the action. The Vietnam War was the first military conflict to be televised, and by that time more than 90 percent of American households had a television.17 By 1963, television surpassed newspapers as the leading source of international news for the American public.18 Even more telling, television was becoming the news source that Americans considered most trustworthy.19 Television and other media coverage of the war was not censored, and reporters were given free access to the troops and the action. Nevertheless, Johnson felt that TV coverage of the war was excessively negative: “The Communists already control the three major networks and the forty major outlets of communication,” he groused to his aides.20 Tensions about the role television played in influencing public sentiment toward the war emerged as early as one week following Johnson’s commitment of large numbers of US ground forces. On August 5, 1965, the CBS correspondent Morley Safer reported on a mission conducted by US Marines in Cam Ne, a hamlet near the Da Nang air base. As film rolled, Marines used a variety of devices, including a Zippo cigarette lighter, to set fire to thatched huts while villagers, including old men and women, fled in terror.21 Accompanying the images of 150 homes being destroyed, Safer narrated: “Today’s operation is the frustration of Vietnam in miniature. There is little doubt that American firepower can win a victory here. But to a Vietnamese peasant whose home means a lifetime of backbreaking labor, it will take more than presidential promises to convince him that we are on his side.” 22 The Marines and the administration were incensed over the report, which they felt provided selective and biased information, omitting, among other key details, the hamlet’s known connections to the Vietcong.23 Whether or not there was bias in media coverage, brutal images combined with American lives lost impacted attitudes on the home front. A\n\n7\n\n8\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nGallup public opinion survey conducted around August 1965 revealed that only one-quarter of Americans thought that sending troops to Vietnam was a mistake. By early 1968, after nearly three years of unrelenting warfare, the number of Americans who opposed the commitment of troops to Vietnam had doubled.24 Internal documents from the Pentagon’s Systems Analysis Office reveal concern about the eroding public support for the war: “If we are to stay, we must have the backing of the U.S. electorate. As we divert resources from other national goals, as U.S. lives are lost, and as the electorate sees nothing but endless escalation for the future, an increasing fraction will become discouraged. . . . [I]f we are not to lose everything, the trends will have to be changed.”25 In public statements, Johnson and his advisers did their best to counter mounting opposition. On Veterans Day 1967, the president delivered an address from the deck of the USS Enterprise, posing a question on the minds of many: “How many nights must we suffer the nightmare of war?” His answer was upbeat but, in retrospect, overly so: “Not many more nights. . . . Not while we stand as one family, and one Nation, united in our purpose.”26 Ten days later, General William Westmoreland, commander of US forces in Vietnam, appeared before the National Press Club in Washington, DC, and predicted: “With 1968, a new phase is now starting. We have reached an important point when the end begins to come into view.”27 However, the new phase that began in 1968 was not one Westmoreland saw coming. In Vietnam, the Lunar New Year known as Tet is the most sacred time of the year. Homes are cleaned in preparation for the holiday, symbolically removing the bad luck of the past year. Good fortune in the new year is thought to be encouraged by performing acts of kindness. Tet is a time for families to be together at home. (Even during the height of the war, it was standard practice to suspend hostilities to allow combatants on both sides to spend time with families.) In advance of the Tet holiday in 1968, both the NVA and VC insurgents in the South announced that they would honor a one-week cease-fire from January 27 through February 3. The Tet holiday began January 30, and in the early-morning hours of January 31 the Vietcong and NVA launched a coordinated series of\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\nattacks on more than a hundred cities and towns in South Vietnam, including the capital (Saigon) and the former imperial capital (Hue). With the element of surprise, and a massive force estimated at 80,000, the attackers were able to penetrate many targets, including the United States Embassy in Saigon. During the second day of fighting, the brutality of the conflict was captured in a Pulitzer Prize–winning photograph. On a street in Saigon, the Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams captured the exact moment that, at point-blank range, the South Vietnamese chief of national police, Nguyen Ngoc Loan, fatally shot in the head a handcuffed VC death-squad captain, Nguyen Van Lem. The following day, the startling photograph appeared in newspapers worldwide, putting faces to the violence occurring in the capital.28 The defenders were able to repel attacks quickly in many locations, but there was fierce and protracted fighting in other locations, particularly Hue. By the end of the twenty-five-day assault, losses in Hue were heavy on both sides—and even more so for the resident population. It is estimated that nearly 6,000 civilians died there, half being executed and then buried in mass graves by communist forces. Three-quarters of the houses in the city were destroyed, and more than 100,000 persons were left homeless.29 From a strictly military perspective, casualties suffered by the NVA and Vietcong during the Tet Offensive were staggering. It is estimated that as many as 32,000 fighters were killed, representing 40 percent of the forces amassed.30 On the American and South Vietnamese sides, losses were much smaller, but still they represented some of the costliest days of the war. Nearly 3,000 South Vietnamese soldiers died; the Americans lost more than 1,500.31 It was hardly a victory for the communist forces, however. When they were repelled from Hue, the North Vietnamese and Vietcong had lost all of the territory they had seized, and their infrastructure was decimated. For Americans back home, the Tet Offensive fed a growing sense of pessimism. In his State of the Union Address, which he delivered just prior to the beginning of the Tet Offensive, the president declared that “the enemy has been defeated in battle after battle.”32 Yet only two weeks later, this same enemy was able to mount a series of surprise attacks, deploying unprecedented numbers of troops in coordination. To see\n\n9\n\n10\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nthe walls of the United States Embassy, a symbol of American strength, penetrated by Vietcong fighters was jarring to even the most hawkish supporters of the war. As questions mounted across the country, Walter Cronkite, the legendary anchor of CBS Evening News, traveled to Vietnam for some answers. Cronkite, whose program was the most popular among the three national networks, felt that news should be presented in an objective manner without editorial commentary. However, when his special documentary report from his tour of Vietnam aired on the night of February 27, Cronkite ended the broadcast with a brief personal assessment: “To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory, conclusion.”33 Legend has it that President Johnson reacted to the CBS broadcast by observing to press aide Bill Moyers: “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost middle America.”34 Regardless of whether this is an apocryphal story, it is undeniable that Johnson was losing the support of the electorate. Two weeks later, he would barely beat an antiwar Democratic presidential candidate, Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, in the New Hampshire primary. It was an ominous sign for a sitting president to face such strong opposition from a relatively unknown challenger within his own party.35 Four days after the New Hampshire primary, sensing Johnson’s vulnerability, Senator Robert Kennedy of Massachusetts announced that he would join the race as well.36 On March 31, Johnson delivered a televised address from the Oval Office. He was not yet sixty years old, but he appeared worn down by the burdens of office. He spoke for forty minutes about the war, announced a unilateral suspension of the bombing campaign, and entreated the North Vietnamese to come to the negotiation table. Johnson concluded his address with a stark acknowledgement: “There is division in the American house now. There is divisiveness among us all tonight.” He then stunned the national audience by declaring: “I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.”37\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\nThree days after Johnson’s surprise announcement, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., the thirty-nine-year-old civil rights champion, accompanied by several fellow leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, boarded a plane in Atlanta bound for Memphis. King went there to support a strike by the city’s African American sanitation workers. The strike was launched seven weeks earlier to protest unsafe working conditions as well as poor wages and benefits. Although such grievances were long-standing in Memphis, the situation boiled over when two sanitation workers were crushed to death by a trash truck’s compactor. The workers wanted to be able to negotiate with the city through union representation, but the city refused to even recognize the union.38 King had traveled to Memphis several times in support of the strike, hoping to hold a peaceful march. A massive, restless crowd gathered on March 28 for a scheduled protest in downtown Memphis with King in the lead, but violence and looting erupted and King was forced to call off the march. Shaken by the riot and its damage to the cause of nonviolence, King and his closest associates returned to Atlanta to plan a response. After intense debate, the Nobel Peace Prize winner convinced the others that a return to Memphis was the only way to demonstrate that a peaceful protest was possible and that ultimately it would prevail in securing workers’ rights.39 King’s arrival in Memphis on April 3 was delayed because the airline had received a bomb threat on his life, necessitating a search of all baggage onboard. In Memphis, King and some associates checked into the Lorraine Motel at midday and that afternoon received a court injunction barring the march, which was planned for the following day—April 4. While lawyers strategized into the evening about how to lift the injunction, an exhausted King, suffering from a fever and a sore throat, sent his friend Ralph Abernathy to address the sanitation workers and their supporters gathered in the Mason Temple, one of the largest churches in the African American community in Memphis. It was filled to capacity that evening despite heavy rainstorms and tornadoes in the area. When Abernathy saw the size and energy of the assembled crowd, he called back to King and pleaded with him to come and speak.40 Without the benefit of text or notes, King began to address the crowd at 9:30 p.m., the winds buffeting and banging the shutters\n\n11\n\n12\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\noutside. King rarely spoke publically about the threats that were made against his life, but that night in Memphis, with lightning cracking outside, he confronted the issue directly. Building to the crescendo of his hour-long sermon, his message was prescient: “We’ve got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn’t matter with me now, because I’ve been to the mountaintop. And I don’t mind.” King continued: Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And he’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.41\n\nKing’s “Mountaintop Speech” that night, one of his greatest and most moving, is tragically prophetic. The following evening, King stood on the second-floor balcony outside his room at the Lorraine Motel as his party prepared to visit a local minister for dinner. Below King, in the parking lot, was a tenor saxophone player, Ben Branch, who was to perform at the dinner. King leaned over the railing to request that Branch play Thomas Andrew Dorsey’s gospel song “Take My Hand, Precious Lord” at the gathering. Branch responded that he played it all the time and would be happy to perform it that night as well. Pleased, King added: “But tonight, especially for me. I want you to play it real pretty.” These words were the last that King spoke. As he turned to go back inside Room 306, a forty-year-old escaped convict named James Earl Ray pointed his Remington Gamemaster pump-action rifle from 200 feet and fired a single bullet that struck King in the chin and neck, killing him.42 “Take My Hand, Precious Lord” includes the following haunting lyrics: “When my life is almost gone, hear my cry, hear my call, hold my hand lest I fall, take my hand, Precious Lord, lead me home.”43 Although King did not hear it played that night in Memphis, at his prior request the renowned contralto Mahalia Jackson would sing it five days later at King’s funeral in Atlanta.\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\nOn the night of King’s assassination, Robert Kennedy, now a Democratic candidate for president, was scheduled to make a campaign appearance in Indianapolis. Kennedy arrived to news of King’s death and, against warnings for his own safety, discarded his prepared remarks in speaking to the heart of the African American community. From the back of a flatbed truck, he delivered a short, moving appeal for peace and understanding. He began by announcing to the audience—many did not yet know of the events in Memphis—of King’s assassination. Screams of disbelief and anguish rose from the crowd. Kennedy expressed empathy in deeply personal terms: “For those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with—filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man.”44 Kennedy echoed King’s call to nonviolence: “What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.”45 Indianapolis remained quiet that evening, perhaps in part because of Kennedy’s calming influence. But a hundred other cities across the country erupted in a spasm of arson, looting, and violence. In the nation’s capital, unrest started on the night of the assassination, and by the middle of the following day a full-scale riot was under way. The DC police force was overwhelmed by an estimated 20,000 rioters; federal troops were called in for assistance, with Marines guarding the Capitol and the 3rd US Infantry Regiment protecting the White House. Over four days of tumult in Washington, more than 1,200 buildings were burned, a dozen people killed, a thousand-plus injured, and more than 6,000 arrested.46 Riots in Baltimore started a day later than in Washington but quickly matched the level of ferocity. Over the weeklong nightmare of burning and looting in Baltimore, more than a thousand businesses were damaged or destroyed, six people were killed, 700 were injured, and nearly as many were arrested as in Washington.47 In Chicago, especially\n\n13\n\n14\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nin the largely black communities on the West Side, two days of violence left eleven dead and 150 injured, and more than 2,000 people were arrested.48 Empty lots in some neighborhoods—still impoverished and never rebuilt—attest to the enduring devastation caused by events in 1968, the annus horribilis.49 There had been deadly riots in American inner cities before, including the Watts section of Los Angeles in August 1965 and Newark in July 1967. The riots reflected the growing frustration of many black Americans that, despite federal programs and outlays to improve education, economic status, and housing, little progress was made. Lyndon Johnson’s ambitious Great Society agenda was aimed at making America fairer and more just for all citizens. A flood of legislation had been passed, starting in 1964 with the Civil Rights Act and the Economic Opportunity Act, followed in 1965 by the Voting Rights Act, the Housing and Urban Development Act, and the establishment of Medicaid.50 In 1968 many blacks in urban America saw meager progress in daily life. The median number of years of educational attainment was 9.8 for African Americans, compared with 12.1 for whites.51 The black unemployment rate was more than twice as high as for whites.52 And the median household income of whites was 60 percent higher than that of African Americans.53 Centuries of inequity could not be erased overnight, or even a few years, and discontent among black communities nationwide might have turned toward rioting without the catalyst of Martin Luther King’s assassination. His murder instilled in African Americans a sense of hopelessness and despair atop their stagnant prospects. Racial tensions impacted the 1968 presidential election. George Wallace, the segregationist former governor of Alabama, ran as a third-party candidate, appealing to poor white voters with law and order and by attacking liberal social policies. The Republican presidential nominee—the former vice president and unsuccessful 1960 candidate Richard Nixon—chose then-Maryland governor Spiro T. Agnew as his running mate to secure the conservative base. Little known to voters nationwide, Agnew’s local record was controversial. He had quickly mobilized the National Guard during the Baltimore riots, and more generally he demonstrated contentious interactions with black leaders.\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\nNixon presented himself as a law-and-order candidate, and his “Southern Strategy” to capture the anti–civil rights white constituency in the Old South still echoes in politics more than a half-century later. Here is Nixon in his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention: “As we look at America, we see cities enveloped in smoke and flame. We hear sirens in the night.” His solution? “To those who say that law and order is the code word for racism, there and here is a reply: Our goal is justice for every American. If we are to have respect for law in America, we must have laws that deserve respect.”54 The Democratic race had become a referendum on the current administration. Eugene McCarthy’s potent antiwar message versus then– incumbent Lyndon Johnson in New Hampshire impelled RFK to get into the race. And with the president out of the picture, Vice President Hubert Humphrey entered the race, focusing on states without primaries. As the Kennedy campaign was gearing up, McCarthy tallied a string of victories in early voting. Kennedy then won in Indiana and Nebraska, then lost a close race to McCarthy in Oregon. The next primary, in California, was key to each campaign. McCarthy focused on campuses, where his peace platform was the motivator among most students; for his part, Kennedy appealed to African American and Hispanic communities. On June 4 in the late hours of the night, Kennedy—forty-two years old—won California by a close margin. Around midnight, Kennedy delivered a victory speech to nearly 2,000 supporters in the Ambassador Hotel ballroom. His remarks rallied them to the next step toward nomination: “Now on to Chicago and let’s win there!” Everything ended moments later when a gunman wounded Kennedy and five other persons in a cramped pantry leading to the Colonial Room for press interviews. The assassin Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian Orthodox Christian with Jordanian citizenship, immigrated to the United States twelve years earlier and opposed Senator Kennedy’s support of Israel. The nation, still recovering from the assassination of Martin Luther King and the violent reaction that it triggered two months earlier, was in shock from another killing of a national leader. On the day of Robert Kennedy’s funeral, the playwright Arthur Miller wrote a commentary\n\n15\n\n16\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nin the New York Times that exhorted his fellow Americans: “Face the fact that the violence in our streets is the violence in our hearts.” Miller went on to link the injustice at home with the fighting in Vietnam, which Kennedy had sought to end: “A country where people cannot walk safely in their own streets has not earned the right to tell any other people how to govern itself, let alone to bomb and burn that people.”55 Two weeks after Robert Kennedy was slain, Robert Angell, editor and writer at The New Yorker, assessed the nation’s state: Each morning since the death of Robert Kennedy, we have awakened to the familiar knowledge that some terrible piece of news, some jolt of the intolerable, awaits us just beyond the borders of sleep. We open our eyes to a corner of the bureau, a soft glint of mirror, morning sounds, and then it comes back. . . . Like an invalid, we are each day less shocked to find that we are ill, each day more absorbed with our symptoms.56\n\nIn this dispirited state, the country limped into the national political conventions, with the Republicans gathering on August 5–8, followed by the Democratic meeting on August 26–29. The Republicans nominated Richard Nixon on the first ballot over Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan, in part because the Southern Strategy brought support from conservative delegates opposed to racial integration. The convention was held without disruption in tony Miami Beach, but only a few miles away, in the predominately black, poor, overcrowded section of Miami known as Liberty City, unrest was brewing. Reminiscent of the riots following King’s assassination, Liberty City erupted in looting, arson, and violence on August 7, with local police bolstered first by state troopers and then by the National Guard. The fighting over the next two days resulted in three deaths, numerous injuries, and almost 200 arrests.57 Even with President Johnson off the ticket, the Democratic National Convention, held at the International Amphitheatre in Chicago, amounted to a referendum on his policies, particularly escalation in Vietnam. In Johnson’s absence, Vice President Hubert Humphrey stepped into the race and was seen as the standard-bearer for the administration. The candidate who had been in the race the longest, motivated\n\nAnnus Horribilis\n\nby his opposition to the war, was Senator Eugene McCarthy. After Robert Kennedy’s assassination, Senator George McGovern of South Dakota, also an early opponent of the war, joined the race. The peace vote, previously divided between Kennedy and McCarthy, now was split between McGovern and McCarthy, providing Humphrey a clear path to nomination. Antiwar forces in fifteen states attempted to bolster their representation through repeated challenges of the credentials of Humphrey delegates, but it was to no avail and Humphrey was nominated. The biggest battle of the convention, however, was fought outside on the hot and humid streets of Chicago. Beginning five months before the convention, plans were laid for large-scale antiwar protests involving more than a hundred groups. Tens of thousands of protesters came to Chicago. In a show of strength, Mayor Richard J. Daley refused permits for parades, established curfews at public parks, and amassed a force of nearly 12,000 Chicago police, 7,500 Army troops, 7,500 National Guardsmen, and 1,000 Secret Service agents. Violence erupted when law enforcement attempted to relocate protestors from areas in which they were not permitted and when protestors attempted to march to the convention site. Scenes of police in full riot gear, using tear gas, and wielding clubs to beat protestors were telecast live around the country. Reporters who happened to be caught in the crossfire were attacked as well. Nearly 600 arrests were made, and more than 100 protestors and a comparable number of law enforcement personnel were injured.58 Chicago only served to put an exclamation point on a year of violence and division. As soldiers fought an ocean away, the dreams of the Great Society and the nonviolence movement at home had been shattered by assassinations, looting, burning, and the heavy-handed response of elected officials and law enforcement.\n\n17\n\nC HAP TER 2\n\nBEST IN CLASS Goldstein, Varmus, Brown, Lefkowitz\n\nIn a contest for least likely town in America to produce a major research scientist, Kingstree, South Carolina, would have to be near the top. About 75 miles north of Charleston, Kingstree is better known for producing vinegar-spiced barbecue than for raising biomedical scientists. Kingstree’s origins trace back nearly 300 years to the British governor’s plan for a ring of inland townships to protect the settled coastal communities from attack by Spaniards and Native Americans. The town’s name relates to a towering white pine that stood at the head of the Black River and was marked as a “King’s tree” reserved as potential timber for building royal ships.1 In search of religious freedom, Protestant Scots-Irish immigrants settled the township, enjoying success by cultivating indigo. During the Revolutionary War many joined the legendary guerrilla commander General Francis Marion—the “Swamp Fox”—in his campaign against\n\nBest in Class\n\nthe British. After independence, the region began to cultivate laborintensive crops like cotton and tobacco; large and prosperous antebellum plantations were built with the forced labor of slaves. The Civil War and Reconstruction left the community in financial and psychological ruin. Over ensuing decades, a series of economic booms and busts occurred, first with the rise and fall of turpentine production, then cotton, and finally tobacco. Much of the tree-lined downtown commercial district was constructed between 1900 and 1920. The buildings stand today as they did a century ago, undisturbed by the world beyond the fields, pine forests, and swamplands.2 One of the early stores on Main Street was a dry-goods business founded in 1904 by David Silverman. In 1935, the store’s owner, Joseph Eron, died, and his widow, Sadie, invited her younger brother, Isadore Goldstein, to become a partner in the business and operate it. Goldstein, a recent law school graduate of Cumberland College in Tennessee, quickly adapted to the demands of running a family clothing business that was, both literally and figuratively, at the center of the community. He married Fannie Alpert of Sumter, forty miles west, in 1938. Their only child, Joseph “Joe” Leonard, was born on April 18, 1940, in Sumter, because the hospital in Kingstree had been closed due to a fire. The Goldsteins were known as pillars of the Kingstree community, and over time Isadore served three terms on the city council, as president of the Kiwanis Club and Chamber of Commerce, chair of the local district of the Boy Scouts, and Master of the Free Masons. At their white-painted brick home on Second Avenue, built when Joe was about ten years old, Fannie was admired as a gracious hostess. In addition, she was a master gardener with a particular affection for orchids in her sun porch and pink azaleas in the yard. Growing up in a town of fewer than 3,200, Goldstein attended segregated local public schools. The Jewish community in Kingstree had only about forty families at its peak. His parents drove Goldstein to Sumter every Sunday so that he could attend classes at Temple Sinai; he was confirmed there with three other students. His high school had only sixty students, but he had good teachers, including a chemistry instructor who sparked Joe’s initial interest in science.3\n\n19\n\n20\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nGoldstein was voted class president for each of his last three years of high school. As a senior, among his extracurricular activities Goldstein was editor of the Boll Weevil student newspaper, named for the beetle that bedeviled the region’s cotton farmers. Under his leadership, the Boll Weevil won three out of four divisions in a state press association contest and was named Best in State, beating out student newspapers from larger prominent schools. One of Goldstein’s most noteworthy assignments as a reporter was to interview the much-admired statesman Bernard Baruch. A Jewish native of Camden, South Carolina, Baruch was born five years after the end of the Civil War. His father, Simon, a physician educated at the state’s medical school in Charleston, had served as a surgeon in the Confederate Army. When Bernard was eleven, Simon moved the family to New York City, where the elder Baruch became known for medical writing and public health efforts.4 Bernard chose not to follow his father’s career path into medicine, instead becoming a stock broker and making a fortune in commodities trading. Baruch served as an adviser to Presidents Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War I and World War II.5 Baruch reconnected with South Carolina when he bought a massive landholding on the coast, which he named Hobcaw Barony and maintained as a hunting preserve. A second, smaller Baruch landholding—this one a paltry 3,700 acres or so—was located eight miles east of Kingstree and was known as Little Hobcaw.6 Among the dignitaries who came to visit Baruch at Little Hobcaw was Eleanor Roosevelt. While in high school, Goldstein observed the former first lady’s arrival in Kingstree on the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. As in many Southern towns, the railroad tracks divided the community by social and economic status. Roosevelt’s arrival was greeted with cheers from the assembled African Americans on one side and jeers from whites on the other side. In February 1958, the eighty-seven-year-old Baruch consented to be interviewed by Goldstein at Little Hobcaw. The elder statesman clearly charmed the young reporter, who variously described the elder statesman as spry, robust, warm, and friendly. Of particular note, Baruch emphasized to Goldstein, that while the three R’s of education—reading, writing, and arithmetic—are important, equally important are the\n\nBest in Class\n\nthree C’s—character, courage, and competence. This lesson would shape the young editor’s life for years.7\n\nMore than 700 miles to the north and a cultural world away lies the village of Freeport, New York. Located on the south shore of Long Island, the town’s name reflects its history as a so-called free port where ships during colonial times could unload cargo without paying customs fees. The town became an artist colony in the early twentieth century, with many vaudeville performers such as Fanny Brice, Sophie Tucker, and Will Rogers establishing residences there. Freeport grew as a tourist destination, noted for its water sports and fishing in the summer months. With a population of about 20,000, Freeport welcomed a new resident on December 18, 1939: Harold Eliot Varmus. Harold’s father, Frank, was a physician who had attended Harvard College on a lacrosse scholarship. After graduation, Frank worked as a waiter to earn enough money to enroll in Tufts University Medical School. Frank would undertake a residency at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn, where a friend introduced him to his future wife, Beatrice “Bea” Barasch. Bea grew up in Freeport and attended Wellesley College, where she majored in psychology and later trained as a psychiatric social worker. Together, they settled in her hometown, where Frank launched a family medicine practice.8 Harold grew up with his younger sister Ellen in a Victorian house surrounded by vegetable and flower gardens. Even as the son of a physician, Harold’s school interest was literature rather than the sciences. A product of public schools, Varmus augmented his high-school studies by arranging an informal summer tutorial on James Joyce. Taught by a young English professor from Hofstra University, the once-per-week evening seminar reinforced Harold’s interest in, and appreciation of, great literature.9\n\nIn Brooklyn, less than twenty-five miles west of Freeport, Harvey and Evelyn Brown celebrated the birth of their firstborn, Michael “Mike” Stuart Brown, on April 13, 1941. Harvey was a salesman who marketed textiles to clothing manufacturers, and Evelyn was a homemaker.\n\n21\n\n22\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nHarvey knew the frustrations of working for a boss, and he wanted something different for his son. He believed that if Mike could become a physician his son would enjoy greater independence and freedom. From an early age, Mike was encouraged to become a physician, and he internalized this desire. When Mike was eleven, the Brown family, by then including a daughter, Susan, moved to Elkins Park, located within the sister suburban townships of Cheltenham and Abington about six miles north of Philadelphia. Together, the two townships had about 50,000 residents when the Browns arrived. Elkins Park was named after businessman William L. Elkins, who made his initial fortune in oil refining and then diversified into the streetcar and railway businesses. At the turn of the twentieth century, Elkins built an opulent Italian High Renaissance summer retreat there. At the time, it was said that “there were more millionaires in Cheltenham per square inch than anywhere else in the country.”10 When Brown was growing up, Elkins Park was far more diverse economically, and the Browns lived in an apartment in the less affluent part of town. Not long after arriving in Elkins Park, Michael developed a keen interest in operating amateur radios and obtained a license when he was thirteen. He built radio transmitters and receivers from kits, and he learned how to troubleshoot problems in a systematic way. These skills would serve him well in later years when he was trying to solve problems of an entirely different nature. Brown attended Cheltenham High School, one of the oldest public high schools in Pennsylvania. Cheltenham alumni have been successful in many fields, including business (dealmaker and billionaire Ronald Perelman, class of 1960), athletics (baseball Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, class of 1964), and politics (Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, class of 1967).11 At Cheltenham, Michael played baseball and developed an interest in journalism, serving as the sports editor of the school newspaper. During this period, one particular book left a lasting impression, as it did for many young people who aspired to careers in medicine: Arrowsmith by Sinclair Lewis. This 1925 satirical novel tells the story of Martin Arrowsmith, a physician who traveled a fanciful odyssey from private practice, to hospital work, to research, to fighting a\n\nBest in Class\n\nplague, and finally returning back to private practice.12 Young Brown was fascinated with how a career in medicine might open up so many doors of opportunity.\n\nOn April 15, 1943, during World War II, Max and Rose Lefkowitz welcomed their only child, Robert “Bob” Joseph Lefkowitz, into the world. After four prior miscarriages, Rose’s delivery of a healthy son was the realization of a dream, and Rose was advised against attempting any further pregnancies. She had grown up in Manhattan and worked as an elementary-school teacher. Husband Max grew up in a large family on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, studied accounting at Brooklyn College, and worked in the garment industry. The Lefkowitz family lived in the southeast Bronx in a sixth-floor, two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment.13 Their building was one of about fifty that housed 12,000 families as part of a planned community, Parkchester, developed a few years earlier by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.14 Rose cherished her only child and was very protective of him, but she was uncomfortable expressing deep affection. She did manage to communicate her high expectations, however. She was a perfectionist, and she took great interest in his schoolwork and making sure that he practiced the piano for an hour every day—a task that young Bob despised. Max was a doting parent; as a Yiddish expression goes, he kvelled with pride over his son’s every accomplishment. Max took great pleasure in any assistance that he could provide to his son. In junior high school Bob was a straight-A student, but one thing that did not come easily was athletics. When Bob struggled to meet physical education standards in tumbling and rope-climbing, Max rigged up tumbling mats in their apartment and a rope at their summer vacation home. Under his father’s coaching, Bob was able to demonstrate sufficient skills to earn a passing grade. From an early age, reading was a passion for Bob, and he devoured books, including his parents’ collection. When he had read all of the books at home, he turned to the public library, always checking out the maximum number of books permitted. He deemed the library to be a poor substitute for acquiring his own books, which he did\n\n23\n\n24\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nsurreptitiously. He would order “free” books offered as teasers for subscriptions to buy more books over the ensuing year. In this way, he received the six-volume set of Carl Sandburg’s magnum opus on Abraham Lincoln and an equally weighty six-volume edition of The Second World War by Winston Churchill. His unsuspecting parents were left to honor his stealth commitments to purchase the remaining contracted books, adding to his reading material. Bob’s passion for books was so intense that he would occasionally feign illness so that he could stay home from school in order to read.15 Like Mike Brown, one novel that captured Bob’s imagination was Arrowsmith. Another favorite was Microbe Hunters by Paul de Kruif, published in 1926. The latter was a collection of a dozen true-life stories of medical heroes—from Louis Pasteur working on rabies, to Walter Reed working on yellow fever, to David Bruce working on sleeping sickness. A microbiologist himself, de Kruif had been an adviser to Sinclair Lewis in the technical aspects of Arrowsmith. De Kruif wrote with passion and verve, occasionally inventing dialogue to spice up the story.16 Not surprisingly for a fan of Microbe Hunters, the young Bob Lefkowitz had a chemistry set and a microscope. He was also an enthusiastic stickball player and a diehard New York Yankees fan. In his heart, he aspired to be a professional baseball player, like his hero Mickey Mantle, but sadly lacked enough talent with the bat. A more realistic career choice took root by the time Bob was in third grade: to become a practicing physician. In this he had a role model, the family’s dedicated physician, Dr. Feibush, who made house calls as part of his practice.17 Clearly, Bob had the academic chops to aspire to a medical career. In the sixth grade, he performed well enough on a Special Progress exam to skip grades. The next hurdle was admission to the highly selective Bronx High School of Science, or Bronx Science. One gained admission solely on the basis of performance on a competitive exam. At the time, Jewish students faced quotas at many private schools, but at Bronx Science no such barriers existed. The school, therefore, became an academic entry point for many talented Jewish students. As Lefkowitz described: “Everybody at Bronx Science was Jewish at the time. . . . I went back and looked and I think there were about 15 Shapiros in my class.”18 Bronx Science produced a distinguished line of graduates, including eight\n\nBest in Class\n\nNobel Prize winners, mostly in physics, and six Pulitzer Prize winners. For the first time in his life, Lefkowitz felt challenged academically, but he still graduated within the top 5 percent of his class of about 800 students. Of course, it was an accomplishment just to graduate from Bronx Science, but Bob managed to do it two years early at the age of sixteen.19\n\nThese four young men—from Kingstree (Goldstein), Freeport (Varmus), Elkins Park (Brown), and the Bronx (Lefkowitz)—headed in different directions for their college educations. Goldstein, as the only one raised south of the Mason-Dixon Line, chose a school steeped in southern tradition: Washington and Lee University, a small liberal-arts school in Lexington, Virginia, toward the lower end of the Shenandoah Valley. In 1958, Lexington had a population of about 7,500, which was double the size of Kingstree yet small enough to feel comfortable for Goldstein.20 Goldstein was interested in premed studies, the program at Washington and Lee was solid, and he signed up. Goldstein arrived in September 1958 among a freshman class of about 300. Joe pledged and was admitted into Zeta Beta Tau, the first Jewish fraternity. Academically, he made a smooth transition from the small high school in Kingstree to the rigors of college courses, and he was one of nine freshmen admitted into the Phi Eta Sigma honorary scholastic society.21 Goldstein’s academic success continued in his second year, when he was selected as the sole recipient of the Phi Beta Kappa honorary society’s Sophomore Award.22 The following year, he was the only junior elected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa.23 Goldstein maintained a perfect 4.0 gradepoint average through his college career. Just to prove he was human, however, he did actually earn one B—in physical education—but this was not counted in the official grade calculations.24 With an unblemished academic record, it was no surprise when he became the valedictorian of his graduating class; on Friday, June 8, 1962, he addressed 238 graduates, their families, and friends at commencement on the front lawn of the university.25 There was more than academics to Goldstein’s career at Washington and Lee, however. He was chair of the student library committee,\n\n25\n\n26\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nsecretary of the Publications Board,26 and editor in chief of Calyx, the student yearbook. One of his former biology professors, James H. Starling, observed: “Pre-med students had their minds on getting into medical school . . . and to hell with the rest of it. But he [Goldstein] did the rest of it.”27 Another former professor, Sidney M. B. Coulling of the English Department, noted of Goldstein’s diverse interests that “it’s hard to have that kind of all-around record,” adding, “he was, in short, a campus leader and a valedictorian—a rare combination.”28 Even when it came to academics, the kid from Kingstree who graduated with a BS in chemistry summa cum laude was not monochromatically interested in the sciences. Professor Coulling recalled that Goldstein “had a perception of literary values and literary qualities. He bridged the two cultures.” It was in science, however, that Goldstein truly excelled. One of his former classmates and later a judge, George E. Honts III, recalled an organic chemistry class in which Goldstein earned a 99, 30 points above the next highest grade. “He royally screwed the curve for all of the other fellows,” laughed Honts.29\n\nNearly 600 miles northeast of Lexington is Amherst, Massachusetts, named after Jeffery Amherst, commander in chief of the British army in North America during the French and Indian War.30 When Harold Varmus arrived in Amherst, in 1957, about 13,000 permanent residents were far outnumbered by the student population. Amherst is the typical college town. In addition to the private Amherst College, there is the much larger University of Massachusetts–Amherst, the flagship campus of the public University of Massachusetts System. Nearby are two of the Seven Sisters—private women’s colleges—Mount Holyoke College (in South Hadley) and Smith College (Northampton). Hampshire College, a small private liberal arts school, opened in 1970. Varmus chose Amherst over his father’s alma mater, Harvard, because he was looking for a small school at which he could have close relationships with faculty while pursuing a broad liberal arts education. His class (about 250, all male) was taught according to the so-called New Curriculum, introduced a decade earlier. This approach to undergraduate education involved prescribed two-year sequences of courses in\n\nBest in Class\n\nthree required pathways: history, science, and the humanities. Courses were taught in small groups, with complementary laboratory or seminar sections, and electives were reduced or eliminated during the first two years. Even when a student decided on a major in the final two years, faculty continued to exert influence, if not control, over course selection.31 Varmus selected English literature as his major after excluding philosophy and physics as alternatives. He was exposed to great literature and great teachers. For his thesis, Varmus was matched with a young faculty member named William Pritchard. This was the first thesis Pritchard directed, so he was particularly attentive to his young charge. The thesis focused on the role that Charles Dickens’s character and life experiences played in shaping his writing. The premise of Varmus’s thesis—that literary analysis must take historical and biographical contexts into account—was a counterpoint to the department’s senior scholars who built reputations arguing the opposite. Nevertheless, Pritchard and other faculty members found the thesis sufficiently meritorious to advise Varmus to consider a career in English literature.32 When he was not immersed in Dickens, Varmus was focused on the school newspaper, the Amherst Student. For a year, Varmus served as the editor in chief. The paper, not limiting itself to events on campus, featured reviews of virtually every type of art form, from literature, to music, to film, to painting. Editorials were equally wide-ranging, from the amount of money spent on intercollegiate athletics, to the role private philanthropy plays in influencing academic matters, to national issues such as the presidential election and the civil rights movement.33 With his attention directed toward Dickens and the student newspaper, Varmus clearly was not the typical premed student. He took the bare minimum of required science courses and tackled them with little enthusiasm. Traditionally, the biggest hurdle for premeds is organic chemistry (in which Joe Goldstein screwed the curve for classmates at Washington and Lee). Harold Varmus started out at the other end of the grade spectrum and struggled even to receive a passing mark. His professor, Robert Whitney, suggested that Varmus abandon the course (and, with it, his medical school ambitions). Varmus was determined to prove Whitney wrong. He escaped the distractions of his noisy fraternity house, relocated to a dormitory, and concentrated enough to\n\n27\n\n28\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nraise his grade to a respectable C.34 Remarkably, Varmus graduated magna cum laude in 1961 and headed to Harvard University to pursue English literature.\n\nMichael Brown’s choice came down to two Ivy League schools: Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania. Brown had images of himself as a Princeton man and was “ready to buy a pipe and ascot.”35 Unfortunately, Princeton did not offer him a scholarship his freshman year, and his family could not afford to send him there without assistance. But Penn was prepared to foot the bill for tuition, room, and board for all four years. Brown accepted the offer from Penn and moved to the campus in downtown Philadelphia. Brown’s four-year scholarship was sponsored by Procter & Gamble and was awarded to two students each year. About two months into Brown’s freshman year, a dinner was held to introduce the awardees to a representative of their corporate benefactor. Upon arrival, Brown immediately noticed that the seven other scholarship recipients were large, strapping fellows. Surprised that he was the only scholarship recipient who didn’t look like he belonged on the football field, after the dinner Brown pulled the Penn dean aside and said: “I think that you guys made a mistake.” Although Brown had played third base on his high school’s baseball team, he was no hot prospect for the Penn athletic department. The dean graciously reassured him that no mistake had been made, confessing: “[Procter & Gamble] stipulated that we couldn’t use their scholarships to recruit athletes. But of course we have been using it for that, and the problem is that the grade point average is so low that they are beginning to get suspicious. So, we had to accept somebody who would pull up the grade point average for the whole group and that’s you.”36 During Brown’s sophomore year, the Penn Quakers football team had seven wins against one tie (Navy) and one loss (Harvard), winning the conference championship. And though Brown kept up his part of the bargain in the classroom, his fellow Procter & Gamble scholars on the football team went 5–13 during Brown’s last two years at the school. Brown majored in chemistry as an undergrad, but he devoted more time and energy to writing features for the university-supported school\n\nBest in Class\n\nnewspaper, the Daily Pennsylvanian. The editorial staff had a reputation for irreverence, which grated on the buttoned-up university administration. It was more than adolescent rebellion—it marked a turning point in social and cultural norms on campus. In the early 1960s, Penn was still a conservative bastion of tradition, with students wearing jackets and ties to classes, as well as to dinner in the freshman commons. Many, if not most, of the students were perfectly comfortable with the status quo. The staff of the Daily Pennsylvanian, however, felt that it was time to bury the “organization man” era of the 1950s. The editorial staff rebelled against university-imposed curfews, dress codes, and the graduation awards handed out largely on the basis of social standing. The newspaper became a forum for raising such concerns and advocating for change. The situation came to a head when the Daily Pennsylvanian produced a parody of the gossipy weekly newspaper published by the separate women’s college at Penn. “We basically lampooned the whole women’s system,” Brown recalled. “That gave the university the opportunity to close down the newspaper. At the time, the newspaper was totally funded by the university. . . . So they called up the printer and said: ‘Stop the presses. We are not paying any more.’”37 The imbroglio did not end there, however: “They made a stupid mistake,” reminisced Brown. “They didn’t shut down our offices. We had offices on the campus that had telephones. So, we immediately got on the telephone and started calling up all the other Ivy League newspapers saying: ‘Penn is suppressing free speech. This is horrible.’” In response, “all of the college newspapers came out with editorials saying that this was terrible.” Not satisfied with support in the print media, Brown and his colleagues contacted local TV stations, but they declined coverage unless there was some sort of visual image to broadcast. Realizing that most of the student body was not enamored of the Daily Pennsylvanian staff, Brown and his team had to find another way to get the campus motivated for a public protest. “We sent our freshman staffers through the dormitories saying: ‘There’s a big demonstration today against the DP.’ So, we organized this whole demonstration against us, and I remember, I got up on the platform and tried to defend us. The television cameras were rolling—and my parents who lived in suburban Philadelphia—that was the first time they ever saw me on television.”38\n\n29\n\n30\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nWithin ten days, the university administration concluded that the newspaper had to be reopened, but they needed a scapegoat, so they relieved the prior editor in chief, Melvin Goldstein, of his responsibilities. The university president, Gaylord Harnwell, a Princeton-educated physicist, personally selected Brown as the interim successor, believing, as Brown later characterized with a touch of irony, that he “was the most presentable guy.” Unbeknownst to Harnwell, Brown had edited the parody issue that ignited the entire controversy and, in addition, was the mastermind behind the guerrilla campaign to restore the newspaper. The headline of the first postsuspension issue read: “As we were saying . . . ” Under Brown’s brief tenure as editor in chief, the Daily Pennsylvanian continued to support greater freedom, independence, and selfdetermination for students. In retrospect, these early Daily Pennsylvanian skirmishes with the university president seem tame compared to events five years later, when Harnwell would see his office occupied by protesting students for two days. In April 1967, as the Vietnam War escalated, students held a sit-in to object to secret research conducted on campus on chemical and biological warfare. Later that year, the editors of the Daily Pennsylvanian would call for Harnwell’s retirement, referring to him as “an old man” and “calling for an infusion of new blood at the top.”39 Aside from learning how to organize a protest with full media coverage, Brown’s tenure at the Daily Pennsylvanian helped him acquire skills that he credited as serving him well later. “One is it gave me a real sense of how to work with a group—how to lead a group of people. Number two, I think newspaper writing is the best training for scientific writing because newspaper people are trained to get the major ideas in the first paragraph, because nobody reads past the first paragraph. That is certainly true nowadays in scientific papers.” More generally, writing “forces you to focus your ideas. What do you do as a scientist? The same thing.”40 Brown estimated that he spent about 80 percent of his time as an undergraduate working on the Daily Pennsylvanian. “You have to put out an issue every single day. The pressure of that is enormous.” The paper went to press at 2:00 a.m., and at this time the printer used linotype machines, so “you would sit there all night with these linotype\n\nBest in Class\n\noperators because they would print a big galley sheet and you would check for errors.”41 Even with the all-nighters, Brown found enough time to study for the courses required for his major in chemistry, as well as the liberal arts classes, which he enjoyed as much or more than his science curriculum. In the summer of 1962, following graduation from Penn, Brown got his first taste of science in a roundabout way. His mother, Evelyn, performed temporary secretarial work, and one of her assignments was at the pharmaceutical company Smith, Kline & French, which operated a factory and a laboratory facility in the heart of Philadelphia. Evelyn Brown, who had a deathly fear of rodents, was not told in advance that her work space would be surrounded by cages of research mice. No sooner had she arrived at her desk than she fainted at the sight of her new office mates. An ambulance was called, and as she was being wheeled out on a stretcher, the laboratory head approached and asked her if he could help in any way. Without missing a beat, in true Jewish mother fashion, Evelyn replied that she was fine, but she would be ever so grateful if he could find a summer job for her son who was a student at Penn. “It was impossible to get these jobs,” Brown reported, and “there was absolutely no way I could have gotten this job any other way. So, they offered me a Summer job, and even though I had a scholarship to medical school as well, I was desperate for money . . . that was the money that basically allowed me to eat during the year.”42 The project on which he worked related to testing drugs that were being developed to reduce stomach acid secretion and the associated symptoms of heartburn. One of the undesirable side effects of these drugs was that they slowed down the rate at which food moved through the intestines. In order to assess the effect on intestinal transit, the drug company needed an experimental model in which gut motility could be measured easily. For this purpose, a meal consisting of a suspension of charcoal was introduced through a tube into the rat’s stomach. The charcoal was used as a marker that could be seen and measured easily. At various times after the charcoal was introduced, the animals were sacrificed to see how far the food had progressed through their intestines. In the meantime, the medications were tested for their effectiveness in preventing ulcers that were induced by stressing the rodents.\n\n31\n\n32\n\nSOLDIERS FOR SCIENCE\n\nOver the two summers that preceded and followed his first year of medical school, Brown measured the effects of various drugs on ulcers and bowel motility in literally thousands of rats. Wanting to understand the biological processes at a deeper level, he spent hours in the company’s library, getting special permission to remain there after closing. It is tempting to trace Brown’s later interest in both medical research and gastroenterology to those quiet summer evenings spent reading in the Smith, Kline & French library and his studies of ulcers and intestinal motility in rodents.\n\nBob Lefkowitz chose Columbia University for college, in part because he was granted early admission and a scholarship. He was given credit for two advanced placement courses—the maximum permitted— in chemistry. So, as a freshman, he was permitted to enroll in organic chemistry, a course usually taken during junior year. Two years younger than most of his classmates, Lefkowitz would later describe himself as “a man in a hurry.”43 His goal was to get to medical school, and from his perspective the sooner that he got there the better. He was able to pick up the already breakneck pace by combining his advanced placement credits with a heavy course load and summer school classes, thereby squeezing a full year from the normal duration of college. At Columbia, there was a two-year required core curriculum, Contemporary Civilization. The didactic approach was to assign readings from classical works in a range of fields, from philosophy to history to social and political sciences. Then, the students would be brought together in a small group seminar format to discuss the works. This curriculum introduced Lefkowitz to a dizzying array of stimulating concepts and ideas. Moreover, he took courses from some of the leading intellectual figures of the day, including the writer and literary critic Lionel Trilling and the historian Jacques Barzun. In completing his assignments, the bookish Lefkowitz felt right at home poring over the collections of the New York Public Library in its majestic public reading room on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.44 Beyond the established academic luminaries to which Lefkowitz was exposed at Columbia, one rising star, Ronald Breslow, captured his\n\nBest in Class\n\nimagination. Breslow taught an advanced seminar in biochemistry and entertained his students, including Lefkowitz, with his fast-talking depictions of the “magic stuff” of chemistry. Breslow would go on to create his own chemical magic by creating new molecules that mimic the actions of naturally occurring compounds. Three decades later, President George H. W. Bush would award Breslow the National Medal of Science for his many contributions, including the development of a drug used in the treatment of lymphoma. Although his primary focus was coursework, Lefkowitz was active in extracurricular activities as well. He worked on the yearbook, the Columbian, during his junior and senior years, serving first as editor of the senior section and, the following year, the fraternities and societies section. Lefkowitz also was a member of the Political Assembly and the Pre-Med Society. In addition, he served as vice president of the Seixas Society, a Jewish fraternal organization. Lefkowitz graduated from Columbia at nineteen and immediately got engaged to his childhood girlfriend, Arna Gornstein. A year later, the couple married, and a year after that they had their first child, David. Almost like clockwork, the following year, "
