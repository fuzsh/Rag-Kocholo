        "text": "Nebula Award for Best Novel [NA]\n\nGiven annually since 1965\n\nThe baby of the sci-fi award family. It started with a bang in 1965 when it was given to perhaps (perhaps) the most famous sci-fi novel of all time. It then hit a number of greats over the following decade: Flowers for Algernon, The Left Hand of Darkness, and Rendezvous with Rama, among others. Though it has found some diamonds since then (notably Neuromancer and Ender’s Game) the sci-fi genre has, in recent decades, failed to score a crossover cultural hit.\n\nNineteen books have won both the Nebula and the other sci-fi annual award, the Hugo [HA]. This means you will see a good deal of them appear on the master list.\n\nWinners can be found here. Ones listed below in RED appear on the Master List."
