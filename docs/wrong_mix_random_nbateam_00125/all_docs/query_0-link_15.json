        "text": "Florida, with it's exotic locales, tropical climate and sometimes fierce weather, has inspired writers for five centuries. We take a look at some of these writers, including two of the most famous, Ernest Hemingway and Zora Neale Hurston. And if you think you might like to be a writer yourself, we have some advice for you. Let's explore...\n\nZora Neale Hurston, 1891(?)-1960\n\nHurston was born in Eatonville, a town near Orlando that was founded and governed by blacks. She moved away when she was 9. She started writing and became a part of the Harlem Renaissance literary movement in New York, but she began returning to her Florida roots in the 1920s and '30s. Her best-known work, Their Eyes Were Watching God, portrays a young woman coming to understand her own identity. She was intensely interested in folk customs and included them in her writing. Other works include Jonah's Gourd Vine and her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road.\n\nSHE WROTE IT:\n\nNothing that God ever made is the same thing to more than one person. That is natural. There is no single face in nature, because every eye that looks upon it, sees it from its own angle. So every man's spice-box seasons his own food.\n\nNaturally, I picked up the reflections of life around me with my own instruments, and absorbed what I gathered according to my inside juices.\n\n_from Dust Tracks on a Road.\n\nErnest Hemingway, 1899-1961\n\nHemingway traveled the world, and his fiction is set on a global stage. However, he wrote many of his books in Key West, where he moved in 1928. To Have and Have Not is set there. He owned a home in Key West from 1931 to his death. The house is a museum of Hemingway's life and displays many exotic possessions he acquired during his travels. His breezy writing studio is a highlight of the tour. Hemingway often sailed across the strait to Havana, Cuba, and The Old Man and the Sea is about a fisherman's loving struggle with a giant marlin. He won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1954.\n\nHE WROTE IT:\n\nThe moon was up now and the trees were dark against it, and he passed the frame houses with their narrow yards, light coming from the shuttered windows; the unpaved alleys, with their double rows of houses; Conch town, where all was starched, well-shuttered, virtue, failure, grits and boiled grunts, under-nourishment, prejudice, righteousness, interbreeding and the comforts of religion; the open-doored, lighted Cuban bolito houses, shacks whose only romance was their names; The Red House; Chicha's ...\n\n_from To Have and Have Not\n\nSources: The World Book Encyclopedia; The Book Lover's Guide to Florida, published by Pineapple Press. The page was researched and reported by David C. Miller and designed by Ron Reason and Beth Hudgins. Illustrations are by Times aartist Rossie Newson.\n\n(A writer's view)\n\nIt was once called by the Indians who lived here \"the land where the wind is born.\" But any writer who has sunk his bare feet into the fine white sand of gulf shores or tasted the tang of ocean spray on her lips or heard the fronds of sabal palms rattling on a summer night or sniffed orchids blooming in the winter knows something else about Florida. It's a land that keeps a writer connected to the mysterious and the beautiful _ and to the seeds of life and thought that travel on the winds of change giving birth to stories. _ Gabe Horn\n\nGabe Horn is an author and teaches writing at St. Petersburg Junior College.\n\nAdvice for young writers\n\nSterling Watson is a writer who lives in southern Pinellas County. He has written critically acclaimed novels and teaches creative writing at Eckerd College. Here are some thoughts about writing he shares with young people:\n\nWhen your writing is going well, you can slip into an almost trancelike state, what John Gardner calls the \"vivid and continuous dream of fiction.\" It can be more real, more challenging and more fun than the world the world calls real.\n\nPeople talk a lot about a talent for writing. Hard work may be even more important than talent. Lots of people have talent. Most of them waste it because they don't work hard and they don't learn the craft _ the nuts and bolts _ of writing.\n\nWhen you begin to worship at the altar of craft rather than talent, other elements of what I call the myth of creativity begin to come into question. Inspiration is one of them. Inspiration exists, or happens, but waiting for it to happen is a very chancy business. Writers don't simply live from day to day in a state of passive receptivity.\n\nThe rewards of writing, as the world defines rewards, can be sparse. The joys of the writer's life are not fame, or money, or glamor, or the esteem of one's fellow citizens. Fred Chappell says that \"the only recompense for decent literary work is the work itself. Not the finished product, but the process of creating.\"\n\nHere are 10 rules for a happy, healthy writing life:\n\n1. If you can't get anything written, lower your standards.\n\n2. If you write something you think is really good, raise your standards.\n\n3. Read good books. If you can't find them, your teachers will help you. They know where to look. Also read bad books so that you can know the enemy.\n\n4. If you get a little money, buy books. If you get a little more money, buy food.\n\n5. Don't watch TV. If you do, it will take years to rid yourself of tawdry habits of storytelling.\n\n6. Write every day, or as often as you can. Regular writing is different in almost every way from occasional writing. The results will astonish you.\n\n7. Don't compare yourself to anyone but your earlier self. Don't waste time and energy on jealousy. Jealousy rots the soul.\n\n8. Everyone is entitled to his or her opinion, but not all opinions are of equal value. Opinions have value in direct proportion to how well they are articulated and supported by evidence.\n\n9. You don't have to go on safari to be a great writer. As much great art has been made from the back yard as has been made from the outback. Or, as Flannery O'Connor put it, \"If you can't make something out of a little experience, it's not likely you'll make something out of a lot.\"\n\n10. Last, and most important of all, you don't have to self-destruct to be an artist. Some writers have been drunks and suicides, but more have been happy and healthy. Those in the second category write just as well as those in the first.\n\nFAMOUS WRITERS OF FLORIDA\n\nHere are some of the top Florida writers. They're listed with the places they lived or wrote about or with which they're otherwise most associated. Dr. Gary Harmon, a professor at the University of North Florida, put together most of this list and some of the information about the writers. Other information came from The Book Lover's Guide to Florida and Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nWest coast and Panhandle\n\nAlvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca (1490-1560). He was a Spanish explorer who reached the Tampa Bay area in 1528 with hundreds of other men. They undertook a harrowing journey of thousands of miles through the area that would become the southeastern United States, Texas and Mexico. Only four survived. Nunez Cabeza de Vaca wrote an account of his travels, the land and the people he encountered titled, in part, Naufrigos, or Shipwrecks. His account was a primary source of the legend of the fabulous Seven Golden Cities of Cibola that conquistadors pursued for decades.\n\nCape Canaveral\n\nMartin Caidin (1927- ). The television shows The Six Million Dollar Man and The Bionic Woman were developed from Caidin's book Cyborg. He has written many books and stories based on the space program, including Marooned and The Cape.\n\nGainesville\n\nHarry Crews (1935- ). Crews is director of the writing program at the University of Florida. Much of his work is explicitly Southern. His novels include Naked in Garden Hills, Karate Is a Thing of the Spirit, Car and The Hawk Is Dying. The Gypsy's Curse is set in Clearwater.\n\nCoconut Grove\n\nMarjory Stoneman Douglas (1890- ). There'll be a portrait of Douglas, a writer and environmentalist who is 102 years old, on this page next week.\n\nOrmond Beach\n\nJoe Haldeman (1943- ). He wrote his first novel, War Year, after he was wounded in Vietnam. Most of his work is science fiction, for which he has won prestigious awards. The Forever War won the Hugo, Nebula and Ditmar awards. Other works by Haldeman include Mindbridge and All My Sins Remembered.\n\nKey West\n\nErnest Hemingway (1899-1961). There's a portrait of Hemingway on this page.\n\nTennessee Williams (1911-1983). Williams, one of America's foremost playwrights, maintained a home in Key West for more than 30 years. Night of the Iguana was written on the island and the movie version of The Rose Tattoo was filmed there.\n\nMiami\n\nCarl Hiassen (1953- ). This columnist for the Miami Herald has gotten national attention in the past few years for his comic novels. They include Tourist Season, Native Tongue, Double Whammy and Skin Tight.\n\nEatonville\n\nZora Neale Hurston (1891?-1960). There's a portrait of Hurston on this page.\n\nSiesta Key\n\nMacKinlay Kantor (1904-1977). A retired military man, Kantor won fame for two novels based on war. Andersonville, about the infamous Civil War prisoner of war camp, won the Pulitzer Prize. Glory for Me was made into a famous movie, The Best Years of Our Lives, which won an Academy Award.\n\nJohn D. MacDonald (1916-1986). He wrote more than 70 novels and 500 short stories, many, but not all, thrillers and mysteries. His most famous character is Travis McGee, a detective who lived on a houseboat in Fort Lauderdale. His books include The Only Girl in the Game, The Dreadful Lemon Sky and Condominium.\n\nWinter Park\n\nAndre Norton (1912- ). Another science fiction and fantasy writer, Norton has written more than 100 works. Her novels include Crossroads of Time, Night of Masks and The Year of the Unicorn.\n\nPalm Beach\n\nTheodore Pratt (1901-1967). He was called the literary laureate of Florida for his trilogy of books about the Palm Beach area: The Barefoot Mailman, The Flame Tree and The Big Bubble. Much of his writing was about the history of Florida. His Seminole was about the chief Osceola.\n\nCross Creek\n\nMarjorie Kinnan Rawlings (1896-1953). She is one of Florida's most famous writers, mostly on the strength of her novel The Yearling, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1939 and was made into a popular movie. She also wrote South Moon Under and When the Whippoorwill. She was sued over her book Cross Creek, and the bitter trial strained her so that she moved away and never again produced any important writing.\n\nMerritt Island\n\nPatrick D. Smith (1927- ). Much of what Smith writes concerns ordinary people and how they shaped the history of Florida. His Forever Island is about Seminoles in the Everglades. A Land Remembered covers three generations of a family from Central Florida to the 1920s land boom in Miami. Angel City concerns the lives of migrant farm workers.\n\nMandarin\n\nHarriet Beecher Stowe (1811-1896). The Stowe family owned a mansion in Mandarin and were winter residents for more than 15 years. Stowe's most famous work is Uncle Tom's Cabin. Her book, Palmetto Leaves, did much to encourage Northern migration to the state.\n\nJacksonville\n\nFrank G. Slaughter (1908- ). Originally a surgeon, Slaughter published That None Should Die in 1941 and won critical acclaim. The book is about a young doctor in the South. He has written more than 60 others, including In a Dark Garden, Fort Everglades and The Song of Ruth, one of several of his works that became movies.\n\nJames Weldon Johnson (1871-1938). He founded perhaps the first daily newspaper in the country for blacks. In 1900, he wrote the words to Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing, which later became the official song of the NAACP. He wrote The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man and, with his brother, J. Rosamund Johnson, wrote God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse.\n\nSt. Petersburg\n\nHarry Whittington (1915-1989). Though born in Ocala, Whittington spent much of his career in St. Petersburg. He wrote more than 200 novels and many other works. He used many pen names during his career, including Hondo Wells and Harriet Kathryn Myers. Among his books are Master of Blackoaks, Rampage and Heat of the Night.\n\nDaytona Beach\n\nRobert Wilder (1901-1974). Wilder wrote many historical novels including a series tracing the story of northeast Florida from colonial times to the 1960s: God Has a Long Face, Bright Feather and The Sea and the Stars. He also was a screenwriter for major movie studios in the '30s and later. His novel Flamingo Road became a movie starring Joan Crawford and a TV series starring Morgan Fairchild."
