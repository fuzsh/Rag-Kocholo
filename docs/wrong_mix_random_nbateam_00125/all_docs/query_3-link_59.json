        "text": "Different direction from Forever War\n\nForever War was a sprawling political war epic in the tradition of Robert Heinlein. Forever Free is at once a smaller, personal story that, by the end, seems like a cosmic tale concocted by Aasimov, Clarke and Dick while sitting at a cafe with Serling in the Twilight Zone.\n\nLiteral Deus ex Machina\n\nA Literal Deus ex Machina - interesting premise, but author undermines it through lazy plot devices. A very far cry from the genius of the Forever War.\n\nExplosive & messy ending.\n\nThe Forever War is an amazing piece of science fiction. It’s sequel; Forever Free… is not, the first 3 hours of this audiobook are decent. The book starts to drag towards its ending and then BOOM! Books over and the ending only slightly makes sense.\n\nSpoilers below if you don’t want to waste a credit on this.\n\n~\n\nVets are mad about the future and try to skip in time to the future.\n\nWhile our motley crew of whoever’s and Mandella’s family comes back in from their extended stay out in space\n\nJesus comes back, raptures all of existence than kills some people, resurrects them 3 sentences later. Gets angry that his creations don’t like being terminated and has a tantrum then fucks off to who knows where…THE END.\n\nThis is an awful reading.\n\nThe book would be better with a decent narrator. I adjusted the audio as much as I could and it still sounded awful.\n\nconfused.\n\nhuh. not sure what to make of that. definitely not a fan of the super macho voice actor. I think it jumped the shark at the end and then gravity failed and it never came down again.\n\nNot my favorite of the trilogy\n\nDid not care for this narrator. Would have preferred the original narrator from the first book to match the characters in this one too.\n\nThe story was whiny, frustrating and depressing. Perhaps that was by design? Or it could have just been the narration?"
