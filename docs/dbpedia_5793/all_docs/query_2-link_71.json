        "text": "Noam Chomsky is internationally recognized for his writing, lecturing, and teaching on linguistics, philosophy, contemporary issues, intellectual history, international affairs, and U.S. foreign policy. Born in 1928 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he studied linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania, where he received his PhD in linguistics. He taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for 50 years and is now an institute professor emeritus in the Department of Linguistics and Philosophy at MIT and a laureate professor of linguistics and the Agnese Nelms Haury Chair in the Program in Environment and Social Justice at the University of Arizona.\n\nHe has published leagues of work, including numerous best-selling political books, which have been translated into scores of languages worldwide, most notably among them: Hopes and Prospects, The Essential Chomsky, Hegemony or Survival, For Reasons of State, Occupy, and Fateful Triangle. Among his most recent books are Who Rules the World?, Requiem for the American Dream, and What Kind of Creatures Are We? In Spring 2022, he will publish Chronicles of Dissent, a new compilation of his 1984-1996 interviews with David Barsamian.\n\nThe New York Times Book Review says, “Judged in terms of the power, range, novelty, and influence of his thought, Noam Chomsky is arguably the most important intellectual alive.”"
