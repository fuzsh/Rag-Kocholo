Conflict between humans and machines is seen as inevitable and its outcome all too predictable. In this groundbreaking audiobook, distinguished AI researcher Stuart Russell argues that this scenario can be avoided, but only if we rethink AI from the ground up.

The Great Degeneration tackles nothing less than the decline of Western civilization. Ferguson posits that slowing growth, outrageous debt, and antisocial behavior are contributing to the erosion of the West’s once rock-solid foundations. Ferguson excavates the causes and shows how heroic leadership and radical reform are needed to right the course.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nSuperb as always!\n\nBy Ivanhoe on 08-28-17\n\nRadical Markets\n\nUprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society\n\nBy: Eric A.

The solution is to rein in the market, right? Radical Markets turns this thinking - and pretty much all conventional thinking about markets, both for and against - on its head. The book reveals bold new ways to organize markets for the good of everyone.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nTerrible Reader ruins this book\n\nBy Brian W.

How is it that the law permits the state to lawfully engage in actions which, if undertaken by individuals, would land them in jail? These are among the most intriguing issues in political and economic philosophy. More specifically, the problem of law that itself violates law is an insurmountable conundrum of all statist philosophies. The problem has never been discussed so profoundly and passionately as in this essay by Frederic Bastiat from 1850. This essay might have been written today. It applies to our own time.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nThis is abridged\n\nBy Kipling Oren on 09-10-14\n\nFor a New Liberty\n\nThe Libertarian Manifesto\n\nBy: Murray N.

Libertarianism is Rothbard's radical alternative that says state power is unworkable and immoral, and ought to be curbed and finally overthrown.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nI'm a Ron Paul Libertarian but this is a good\n\nBy monte reed on 03-20-12\n\nThe Wealth of Nations\n\nBy: Adam Smith\n\nNarrated by: Gildart Jackson\n\nLength: 36 hrs and 43 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,552\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,297\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 1,286\n\nThe foundation for all modern economic thought and political economy, The Wealth of Nations is the magnum opus of Scottish economist Adam Smith, who introduces the world to the very idea of economics and capitalism in the modern sense of the words.\n\n4 out of 5 stars\n\nADAM SMITH\n\nBy chetyarbrough.blog on 01-20-15\n\nThe Wealth of Nations\n\nBy: Adam Smith\n\nNarrated by: William Holly\n\nLength: 31 hrs and 1 min\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nPerformance\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nStory\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nThe Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith is a seminal work in economics that revolutionized our understanding of the market system and laid the foundation for modern capitalism.

At the heart of Smith's doctrine is an optimistic view of the effects of self-interest.
