        "text": "There's a paragraph that, if the book is to be summarized, seems to summarize it well (and is a favorite of Russ Roberts, who recently wrote a book about Adam Smith):\n\nMan naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely; or to be that thing which is the natural and proper object of love. He naturally dreads, not only to be hated, but to be hateful; or to be that thing which is the natural and proper object of hatred. He desires, not only praise, but praiseworthiness; or to be that thing which, though it should be praised by nobody, is, however, the natural and proper object of praise. He dreads, not only blame, but blameworthiness; or to be that thing which, though, it should be blamed by nobody, is, however, the natural and proper object of blame.\n\nSo, as jobermark pointed out, one should never reduce anyone to a caricature. However, the question from the OP seems to be, in what ways do that caricature fail to explain who Smith is? From the Theory of Moral Sentiments, one can conclude that Smith was not in favor of a cut-throat, profit-at-all-costs existence of society. Rather, Smith acknowledged these two sometimes competing, sometimes cooperating urges that each person has: to benefit one's self and to benefit others one interacts with.\n\nI haven't read enough Smith to know this for a fact, but I know many philosophers since have concluded (based on Smith and based on other independent sources) that the appropriate mechanism for a society is a free-market capitalism in which people are bound by some idea of virtue (treating others with respect, worrying about reputation, etc.).\n\nThe contrast between Smith's moral philosophy and economic sociology has been noted by many, most especially Marx. Smith's work arrived at a radical historical crossroads, prior to the French Revolution and Kant, which makes it especially precarious to deal with it retrospectively.\n\nAs Smith's contemporary and friend Hume noted, you can't get an \"ought\" from an \"is.\" So their \"metaphysical\" and prescriptive work divided from their historical and \"descriptive\" work. A separation that still marks the Anglo-American \"fact-value\" divide.\n\nSmith, Hume, and Locke before them were still disputing old forms of authority. The \"free\" market, like \"free\" reading of the printed bible, was opposed to the absolutism of centralized state pricing, usually in favor of the land-owning class. Marx, who was a great reader of Smith and Ricardo, agreed that capitalism was a great liberating advance, but not a moral advance.\n\nSmith agreed that \"labor\" would be reduced to its lowest possible value under capitalism, but that in the end labor's situation would progress out of \"savagery.\" Marx was more historically relativistic, and witnessed the industrial mass wretchedness of labor. For this later Enlightenment critique, Smith's reliance on \"human sympathy\" was too \"universal\" and simply did not comport with the dynamism and flux of his historical, \"descriptive\" work.\n\nWhile I am something of a neo-Marxist, this remains one of those abiding and unsettled disputes where in fact, philosophy really does matter. Certainly, Smith is no defender of the inherent \"morality\" of modern capitalism. For that, one must look to Mises and the abhorrent Austrians. As an interesting side note, Smith disliked the idea of a limited liability stock \"corporation,\" while Marx thought is was an advance towards a more socialized economics."
