If Republicans succeed in dismantling Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, we can kiss what's left of our democracy goodbye.\n\nBLANK In the second part of their recent conversation, the renowned intellectual (left) tells the Truthdig columnist how the banking, fossil fuel and tech sectors profit from taxpayer dollars.\n\nStaff / Truthdig “I think that the word 'ideology' has to be used very carefully But when people come forward with rather simplistic truths -- you already know you’re in trouble when they say they’ve got the truth -- and they say: 'This is what must happen This is how things work This is what dominates society' That’s an ideology\"“I think that the word 'ideology' has to be used very carefully'\".\n\nStaff / Truthdig In this short clip from a History Channel documentary, the renowned linguist and activist explains how markets actually bring out the worst in humans by turning us into people \"dedicated to maximizing individual gain, not social concern.\"\n\nBy Michael Hudson Unlike psychological terminology -- which consists mainly of terms of invective (try to think of a desirable personality complex) -- today’s economic vocabulary is euphemistic. One rarely hears the terms \"rentier\" or \"usury\" that played so central a role in the debates of past centuries."
