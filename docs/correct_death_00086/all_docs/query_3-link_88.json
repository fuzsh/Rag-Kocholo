        "text": "Petty Officer Second Class (SEAL) Adam Smith died on September 21, 2010 from injuries sustained during combat operations in Zabul Province in Southern Afghanistan. His helicopter crashed while receiving enemy fire during a nighttime operation in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He was assigned to an East Coast based SEAL team.\n\nFallen Heroes of the U.S. Navy SEALs\n\nSeptember 11, 2001 to Present\n\nIn the days, months, and years following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States, Navy SEALs have been called upon more so than ever to employ their unique set of skills in accomplishing our nationâ€™s most dangerous and covert operations. The photographs and stories in this room honor those SEALs who have made the ultimate sacrifice in support of the war on terror, and are displayed in chronological order of their sacrifice, from left to right. Similar displays can be found on the quarterdecks of the U.S. Navy and Naval Special Warfare Commands."
