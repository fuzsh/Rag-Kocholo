        "text": "1776 was a good year for big ideas, a rare thing. It was also a big year for good ideas, an even rarer one. Our own big-deal Declaration was, in its way, the small pugnacious summary of Enlightenment ideas that had reached their apex that winter, in London. In February, Edward Gibbon published the first volume of “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” which included the hymn to Roman republican virtues and the great chapter explaining the rise of Christianity in terms of men, not miracles. Then, a month later, his friend Adam Smith published his big book, “The Wealth of Nations,” which put an end to any attempted defense of the mercantile system of colonial dependence on a mother country.\n\nClassics of English prose, Gibbon’s and Smith’s books don’t just belong to the history of ideas; they helped establish the ideas of history and economics. Gibbon’s is still a model of the tone with which truly enlightened history is written; Smith’s is still the best account of the foundations of market economics. Why do classical economists believe that free trade is good for everyone? Why does the amount of gold kept in the treasury not make much difference to a country’s wealth? Why don’t better machines for making pins eliminate jobs for good, instead of making more jobs of another kind? Why, for that matter, does it not matter whether we’re productive in farming or manufacturing so long as we’re productive? What does productivity even mean? Complex ideas—the division of labor, the advantages of trade—become lucid to the non-economist for the first, and perhaps last, time.\n\nBut where Gibbon is a clear figure in shadowy light, a figure of the Enlightenment who found his place in the twilight of history where reason fell, Adam Smith is a shadowy figure in clear light. He is to most of us the invisible-hand guy, the Scottish face on the British twenty-pound note—the one who showed that greed was good, that the market, left to its own devices, would always set the right price and favor the right goods, Milton Friedman in a kilt. Yet a very different Smith is current in the academy. This Adam Smith is seen not as the apostle of the free market but as one of the fathers of the French Revolution, albeit the nicer, warmer bits of the French Revolution. None other than Noam Chomsky is a fan of this Smith, while one of the most original and mind-altering academic works of the past decade, Emma Rothschild’s “Economic Sentiments: Adam Smith, Condorcet, and the Enlightenment,” claims him for sentimentalists more than for stockbrokers, as a man who believed that feelings of sympathy and engagement preceded impulses of industry and ambition. By cutting off “The Wealth of Nations” from his other great book, “The Theory of Moral Sentiments,” we not only cut off one half of Smith’s mind from the other but lobotomize our own understanding of modern life, making economics into a stand-alone statistical quasi-science rather than, as Smith intended, a branch of the humanities.\n\nNicholas Phillipson’s new biography, “Adam Smith: An Enlightened Life” (Yale; $32.50), tries, very successfully, to pull together the two Smiths, letting us see how the man of feeling became the little god of finance. Phillipson, a historian at the University of Edinburgh, follows Rothschild, making it plain that Smith was more moral-man than market-man. He even finds a couple of deeper emotional veins, which, though hardly turning Smith into Lord Byron, do spice his life with incident and subplot. One was his intimate friendship with the philosopher David Hume, his closest colleague and greatest influence, and his not quite forthright embrace of the atheism for which Hume was notorious. Smith’s real question, it turns out, was not the economist’s question, How do we get richer and poorer?, or even the philosopher’s question, How should one live? It was the modern question, Darwin’s question: How do you find and make order in a world without God?\n\nSmith’s biographers have always sighed at his irredeemable dullness; not much happened to him, certainly nothing romantic. He was a bachelor who lived with his mother for most of his life, and the only really lively surviving anecdote about him is that he was kidnapped at the age of three by a Gypsy, and had to be rescued by his uncle. But the uneventfulness of his career is part of its modernity. Where his fellow-intellectuals typically had to scramble and scrape, Smith had just the career that a man of similar gifts would have now: he scored early by giving well-received lectures under the patronage of an older wise man, became a department chairman at a classy university, then moved into government, until he could make a good living publishing big books while giving, so to speak, an occasional undergraduate survey course.\n\nThe possibility of such an existence does owe something to his nature, but it owes more to his country—to his place as a citizen of Scotland, and particularly of Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment, a renaissance of learning and ambition that followed the union between England and Scotland, in 1707. Smith, who was born in 1723, in Kirkcaldy, Fife, on Scotland’s east coast, studied moral philosophy at Glasgow, spent an unhappy half decade at Balliol College, Oxford, and then arrived in Edinburgh around 1749, when he was in his mid-twenties.\n\nEdinburgh was commonly called the Athens of Britain, though it really was more like an eighteenth-century Chicago. It had a slightly wounded, slightly imperious sense of secondness—to London, in this case—and was belligerently proud of being the place where thinking and teaching went on with less pretension and more common sense than elsewhere. Above all, Edinburgh’s intellectual life, like Chicago’s, was built around a distinctly city university, intertwined with the commercial life and the civic life of a merchant capital, rather than set off in a country town with country values. The intellectual life of Edinburgh was tied to public lectures that were attended by large non-academic audiences. Phillipson sees “The Wealth of Nations” as a Scottish street book, “one of the supreme achievements of a remarkable intelligentsia that was engaged in the project for distilling a theory of sociability out of a popular culture of politeness.”\n\nIn Edinburgh, Smith was immediately befriended by David Hume, who was a dozen years his senior, and whose freethinking essays he had read, thrillingly and illicitly, at Balliol. “The heads of the college thought proper to visit his chamber, and finding Hume’s ‘Treatise on Human Nature,’ then recently published, the reverend inquisitors seized that heretical book, and severely reprimanded the young philosopher,” a later memoir tells. Hume, though far from a romantic figure, had a core of courage, which both impressed Smith and frightened him a little. As the inquisitors at Balliol understood, Hume hardly made a secret of his contempt for organized religion. (An earlier biographer of Smith, James Buchan, points out that both Smith’s and Hume’s fathers died when their boys were small; perhaps the loss made them curiously aware of the spectral nature of authority.) Phillipson shows that many of Smith’s ideas derive from Hume’s. Even his economic theories have origins in Hume’s thought. His theory of the “flow” of balance of trade was Hume’s first of all, and his idea of sympathy as the mucilage of the market was Hume’s, too. Yet Smith’s favored words, “active” and “productive,” are not at all Hume’s favorites. Smith liked life. What he took from Hume’s demonstration of the limits of reason, the absurdity of superstition, and the primacy of the passions was not a lesson of stoical indifference, of Humean serenity, but something more like Epicurean intensity: if we are living in the material world, then let us make it our material.\n\nSmith was an inspired lecturer, who at times stepped away from the lectern, abandoned his notes, and spoke freely to his students. Yet the gift that made him a mesmerizing lecturer—the ability to so lose himself in his subject that he could draw his listener into the maze with him—also earned him a reputation as the first absent-minded professor, seen wandering about, his lips moving as he talked out another lecture; he was “the most absent man in company I ever saw,” one friend said. The “absent-minded professor” is easily misunderstood: he’s really present-minded, but his present is out there in the future, a week or the next lecture away. Dr. Johnson muttered to himself, but that was rumbling before the launch of conversational lightning; Smith moved his lips in reverie as he walked the streets, because he was brooding on the next blow in the inscription of a chiselled argument that he would get right next week. He wasn’t daydreaming; he was night writing.\n\nHume’s feelings about sympathy, in his essays, were not entirely sympathetic. He sees the self as shifty and uncertain, and recognizes that sympathy can be the cause of what we now call conformity: men “find it very difficult to follow their own reasons or inclination, in opposition to that of their friends and daily companions.” But the idea that people live in groups, and that a shared sense of well-being is essential to an individual’s sense of himself, is at the heart of what Smith learned from him. “Man, born in a family, is compelled to maintain society, from necessity, from natural inclination, and from habit,” Hume wrote. Smith pressed harder at the question of how we do live together. Policing, force, plays a role, but people mostly get along well enough even when the cops are far away. “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it,” Smith wrote.\n\nThe key leap between Hume’s thoughts on sympathy and Smith’s thoughts on money took place in the lectures on moral philosophy that Smith gave in the seventeen-fifties, and then turned into “The Theory of Moral Sentiments,” which he published in 1759. For Smith, social sympathy rests on that “principle to persuade which so much prevails in human nature.” His key concept is the idea of an impartial observer who lives within us, and whom we invent to judge our own actions. Sympathy alone, Smith makes plain, isn’t enough to make us good. If we saw our brother or our best friend being tortured on the rack, could we truly sympathize? Not unless we could imagine what it felt like ourselves; it is our own mind that makes us kind. Sympathy isn’t a reflex or a serene internal search; it’s work. Smith’s witness is the imaginary other we install inside ourselves to watch our own behavior.\n\nIt was this connection—between the work of being a social being and the work that social beings do—that began to rule Smith’s meditations on the market. For Smith, the market is imaginative sympathy on speed. “Man continually standing in need of the assistance of others, must fall upon some means to procure their help,” a student’s lecture notes record Smith as saying. “This he does not merely by coaxing and courting; he does not expect it unless he can turn it to your advantage or make it appear to be so. Mere love is not sufficient for it, till he applies in some way to your self love. A bargain does this in the easiest manner.”\n\nThat last sentence is the really explosive one. A bargain does this in the easiest manner. Where can you find a sympathetic community, people working in uncanny harmony, each aware of the desires of the other and responding to them with grace and reciprocal charm? Forget the shepherds in Arcadia. Ignore the poets in Parnassus. Visit a mall. For Smith the plain-seeing Scot, the market may not be the most elegant instance of human sympathy, but it’s the most insistent: everybody has skin in the game. It can proceed peaceably only because of all those moral sentiments, those imaginary internal judges. That’s what keeps the mob from rushing the Victoria’s Secret and stealing knives from the Hoffritz and looting the Gap. Shopping, which for the church moralist is a straight path to sin, is for Smith a shortcut to sympathy. Money is the surest medium of exchange.\n\nIn 1764, Smith went to France as the intellectual companion of a Scottish duke, and stayed for two full years. His reputation had preceded him, and he was overwhelmed by his welcome, as Hume had been by his, and became a regular at the best salons. In Paris, he had a decisive series of discussions with various Physiocrats, who were the first thinkers to refer to themselves as économistes. Though he rejected their one big idea—that all wealth really comes from agriculture and that the manufacturer is parasitic on the farmer—he liked their habit of having big ideas, and having them about money.\n\nOn his return to Britain, Smith tried retreating to his house in Kirkcaldy to write the magnum opus on economics that his visit to France had fixed in his mind as his crucial work. But he eventually found himself short on books and company, and so he travelled to London, where he was invited to join the Literary Club. (Dr. Johnson found him eccentric company, which tells you something.) It took him a decade to find a tone that suited his subject and made its trivia fun to read. To illustrate his central thesis about the “division of labor,” and to illuminate the play between large and small in economics, Smith began his book with one of the great virtuoso pieces of mock-epic writing of the period. He took a single poor worker in England, and meditated on the number of different occupations and laborers involved in dressing him:\n\nThe woollen coat, for example, which covers the day-labourer, as coarse and rough as it may appear, is the produce of the joint labour of a multitude of workmen. The shepherd, the sorter of the wool, the wool-comber or carder, the dyer, the scribbler, the spinner, the weaver, the fuller, the dresser, with many others, must all join their different arts in order to complete even this homely production. . . . Let us consider only what a variety of labour is requisite in order to form that very simple machine, the shears with which the shepherd clips the wool. The miner, the builder of the furnace for smelting the ore, the feller of the timber, the burner of the charcoal to be made use of in the smelting-house, the brick-maker, the brick-layer, the workmen who attend the furnace, the mill-wright, the forger, the smith. . . . Without the assistance and co-operation of many thousands, the very meanest person in a civilized country could not be provided, even according to what we very falsely imagine, the easy and simple manner in which he is commonly accommodated.\n\nThis is the book’s crucial moment of vision: all these people working together, absolute harmony among anonymous individuals, motivated not by the will to coöperate but by the pursuit of their own interest, without any reference to getting a coat on the back of that specific laborer—that’s what makes the coat.\n\nThere are three main arguments in “The Wealth of Nations.” One concerns the quarrel between town and country, and the relative roles that they play in creating wealth. The French Physiocrats’ theory that all the wealth of a nation came from its farms was rooted in the notion that only the farmer really made something out of more or less nothing. Labor was essentially the product of the oats consumed by the laborer. Living, as we do, in the long wake of the industrial revolution, this seems such an odd argument that it is difficult to believe that intellectuals ever put it forward seriously. Yet its emotional tone eerily matches our own feelings about the primacy of manufacturing over the service industries. Even if the economists tell us that the man serving cheeseburgers or selling video games to the few surviving auto-assembly-line workers is doing a job just as productive, we don’t feel it to be true. We think that exporting a television rather than a television program is obviously more virtuous, and therefore must be more profitable, and though we are told it isn’t, we never quite believe it.\n\nSmith ends the entire theory of farm-first wealth by pointing to an error in simple arithmetic. A footman might be said to cost a wage without producing a product, but a glovemaker or a pinmaker is eating his oats and making his gloves or pins. Gloves and pins can be sold for money, and that adds to the wealth of the society. If, over half a year, you eat ten pounds’ worth of corn and make ten pounds’ worth of pins, the value of “what has been consumed and produced during those six months is equal, not to ten, but to twenty pounds.”\n\nSmith’s second argument is that the wealth of a nation has nothing to do with how much gold and silver it has in its vaults. This was a harder argument to make, since it is—and to people like Glenn Beck remains—counter-intuitive. Wealth is what you make, Smith said, not what you hold; make what others want, and you can buy all the gold and silver you need. “Gold and silver . . . are utensils, it must be remembered, as much as the furniture of the kitchen,” he wrote. “Increase the use for them, increase the consumable commodities which are to be circulated, managed and prepared by means of them, and you will infallibly increase the quantity.” If you’ve got the cash to buy gold, you can always get it from whatever country has it.\n\nSmith’s central idea, after these two false ones are demolished, is simple: increased productivity is the sole source of a nation’s wealth. People get richer when they make more things than they did before, and they almost always make more things than they did before because someone has invented a new machine or method that lets them do it. Workers make wealth; prosperity is productivity. The wealth of a nation is all owed to the labor of its people and the technology they possess. Make more and you make more.\n\nThe argument seems so plausible now that it isn’t easy to recapture how abstract and difficult it was in 1776. Smith is arguing against a kind of ancient philosophical prejudice that saw balance, continuity, equilibrium as the signs of a well-ordered commonweal—that thought of the good life as one free from the anxiety of change. If you look at Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s fresco “Allegory of Good and Bad Government,” the Renaissance image of perfect social harmony, you do not see that the good government is making new kinds of scythes so that the peasants can reap more wheat; you see the peasants carrying on as they always have. Insisting that growth and disruption, not balance and harmony, were the key signs of success was very strange. It also meant overturning centuries of Christian suspicion of luxury and luxury goods. The argument was, in its way, as profound as any in the Enlightenment.\n\nYet this leads Smith to his most important and world-changing idea—a way of setting off intention from results, and seeing order where there is no plan. In the earlier works, the implication is that social trust drives people toward free enterprise. The most famous passage in “The Wealth of Nations” seems to suggest that a bunch of heartless bastards caring for no one but themselves can make a prosperous country, because the institutions in some way invent their own decencies:\n\nEvery individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\n\nSmith may not be saying that selfish bastards pursuing their own profits make a better world; but he does say that they make a wealthier nation. They enrich one another while trying to enrich themselves. Not wanting to surrender Smith to later laissez-faire, Emma Rothschild suggests that his use of the “invisible hand” is actually ironic. She points out that its earlier uses derive from the kind of natural theology that we know Smith disliked, and that his use of it here (there’s an earlier, similar one in “Moral Sentiments”) doesn’t mean he believes that letting things alone must naturally make them work better. Still, her proposal that the invisible hand is a “mildly ironic joke” may be a few shades off. _“_Playful” is a terrible word in English—sadistic teachers and bosses are always “playful”—and “tongue-in-cheek” a sad one. “Wry” comes closer to Smith’s intention when he writes about the invisible hand: he is being wry, in the sense of putting forward a phrase or idea seriously while at the same time signalling some rueful knowledge that the phrase or idea has dubious antecedents. But he does think that there is a kind of force—the sum of many conscious and purposefully channelled intentions—which pushes people to do things other than what they sought, and that appeal to greed actually has good effects.\n\nRothschild is certainly right, though, that one can’t grasp the idea of the invisible hand without the balancing idea of the imaginary inner witness. All those moral judges are what let the invisible hand act. Our faith, before we get to the market, that our fellow-man is like us and will seek to bargain and wheedle as we do—fiercely but fairly—is primary. The narrow animal instinct is not to trade and exchange and invest; it is to hoard and guard and pillage. The acquired human trait is the market trait, and it depends on trust, sympathy. To see what happens in the absence of trust, one need only consider the recent history of the developing world; if there is not civic capital, a network of trust, already in place, “privatization” just produces kleptocracy.\n\nBut Smith does not hold that markets always set the best price. He believes that producers tend to band together in order to control prices and eliminate competition, and that historically most of their activity—apprenticeships, guilds, tariffs—has been designed to help them do this. The urge to fair dealing that makes markets happen is always met by the urge to unfair dealing that distorts them. Sociability quickly becomes selfishness if the small society you inhabit shares only your interests. The laissez-faire economy, truly left alone, becomes a conspiracy of producers against consumers, of sellers against buyers. The interest of manufacturers and merchants, Smith maintained,\n\nin any particular branch of trade or manufactures, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers . . . and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, an absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens. The proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order, ought always to be listened to with great precaution, and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined, not only with the most scrupulous, but with the most suspicious attention.\n\nSmith believes, in a way that few neoclassical economists seem to accept, that there is a “natural” price for goods—a price that takes in the cost of making them and a profit for the makers—and a “market” price, and that these two are not always the same. The market is susceptible to pressures from the masters and dealers to keep prices unnaturally high. Smith does not think that “government is the problem”; he thinks that the producers’ compact against the consumers is the problem, and that the producers, because they are concentrated and rich, are usually able to make the government take their side. It is the proper function of the state to prevent the dealers from ganging up on the customers: “Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.” For Smith, the market moves toward monopoly; it is the job of the philosopher to define, and of the sovereign state to restore, free play.\n\nSmith was a firm believer in public goods: he thought that the state has an obligation to build roads and bridges, establish an army, and do all the other things necessary for a sane polity in which the market can function naturally. It would be good, he thought, if these things could be paid for directly, by way of taxes and tolls, by the people using them. But when this is neither practical nor desirable everyone should pay for them, and the rich should pay more than others. “The rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proportion to their revenue, but something more than in that proportion,” Smith writes. He believed in free markets; he just thought that you needed the oversight of the sovereign to make them free. The argument that divides his right-wing admirers from those on the left is whether markets are now, with the abuses that Smith named mostly gone, essentially free, and market prices generally “natural” prices, or whether the process that he identified, by which merchants and manufacturers capture the regulators and conspire against the interest of the broader public, might, in the course of centuries, have found some new manner to make itself felt.\n\nAt one level, “The Wealth of Nations” is a theory of how material commerce works; at another level, a theory of how material commerce civilizes; and, at still another level, a testament to the belief that the material world is the only world we have. For the third great event of 1776, to stand alongside the two others, was the death of David Hume; and Smith’s next important work was his published account, in the form of a letter to a friend, of Hume’s last words and acts. Given Hume’s hostility toward religion, the man’s slow and scary death was a test case of the Enlightenment. Could a declared infidel face his own annihilation with the same serenity that he had been famous for in his lifetime?\n\nSmith, who kept Hume company in Edinburgh, was, in effect, his chosen witness, telling the world that Hume’s serenity remained, to his dying day, as unbroken as his infidelity. (“I shall tell your friend, Colonel Edmondstone,” Hume’s doctor said to him one day, “that I left you much better, and in a fair way of recovery.” “Doctor,” Hume replied, “as I believe you would not chuse to tell any thing but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as fast as my enemies, if I have any, could wish, and as easily and cheerfully as my best friends could desire.”) His impiety remained intact, with his aplomb. Just a few days before his death, Hume, joking about begging for a delay from Charon, the Greek ferryman of Hades, said, “I thought I might say, Good Charon, I have been endeavoring to open the eyes of the people; have a little patience only till I have the pleasure of seeing the churches shut up, and the clergy sent about their business; but Charon would reply, ‘O, you loitering rogue; that won’t happen these two hundred years.’ ” The great infidel and his greatest student, who had used his mentor’s belief in extreme skepticism about authority and his sympathy for sociability to create the intellectual foundation of free-market capitalism, had a fine and final dinner with friends shortly before Hume died. As it happened, it was the night of July 4, 1776.\n\nSmith, at least, lived to have high hopes for the new country. He thought that it was normal for human beings to want to live in a prosperous society, but that it was also normal for them to live in a broadly just society. Their desire for self-improvement was in many ways mysterious, but in the end it was inherently social, rooted not only in the love of acquiring but in the love of haggling, bargaining, interacting—the whole work of building worlds out of wishes. What moved men to make markets was ultimately their love of pleasure and happiness, and who, Smith wondered, could live happily in a society where all the wealth has been confiscated and kept in a few hands? He believed not that markets make men free but that free men move toward markets. The difference is small but decisive; it is most of what we mean by humanism. ♦"
