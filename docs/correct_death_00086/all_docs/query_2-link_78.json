Although scholars have elucidated Smith's view of colonization, these studies have not fully clarified how Smith was influenced by the depiction of societies in South America from travel books. Though he read travel books on South America, Smith does not necessarily follow their original description of the societies found there. Instead, he sometimes distorted the original in consideration of the effects of colonization. To evaluate the impact of colonization, he supposed that societies in South America were not civilized, so colonized societies could be seen as part of the process of civilization. However, he did not belittle precolonial societies. He emphasized the moral quality of the so-called savage people. As I argue in this paper, he had at least two criteria in evaluating society. In addition to economic development, Smith also recognized moral degradation as part of social development. Smith evaluated societies according not only to their degree of economic growth but also to that of moral quality. While he saw civilization as prospering, he thought of it as morally degraded.

        "text": "Introduction\n\n2By referring to travel books, Smith developed his view of civilization. Civilization for Smith was related not only to Europe but also to world countries. By analysing world countries, he created his vision of social transformation from savagery to civilization. He then considered civilization not only as a product of economic development but also of moral degradation.\n\n3We can understand this ambivalence by focusing especially on how Smith researched each region, including South America. When examining that region, he compared the merit and demerit of each society.\n\n4This perspective is also essential for understanding how Smith examined European encounters with non-European people. His explanation of South American societies is also worth studying because it enabled him to consider the effects of colonization. He saw Spanish colonies in South America as one of the worst examples of colonization. Indeed, he also criticized other colonies in North America, India, and other places. He, however, emphasized the beneficial effects of colonization in North America.\n\n5Although Smith criticized British colonization in India, the British presence was fully established only after the Seven Years' War (1756-63), and the effects of colonization were still not yet fully seen in Smith's age. South America was different. Colonization on the continent began at the end of the fifteenth century and had a long history that followed. Some travel books included descriptions of the colonization of South America. Smith read these travel books and cited them in his Wealth of Nations (hereafter WN). Accordingly, by considering travel books on South America, he was able to analyse the consequences of colonization.\n\n8In addition to colonization, Smith investigated the history of civilization in writing about South America. He did not necessarily follow the original description of societies in South America. Instead, he sometimes too oversimplified or distorted the original. This was because he tried to create a view of history that complied with an evolutionary theory of transition from savagery to civilization in which South America was one case; he then did not simply rehearse original reports but elaborated his view of civilization.\n\n10What needs to be researched more fully is how Smith also considered historical processes as including both progress and degradation, although this ambivalence was left to explore. We can understand this by considering how Smith evaluated some societies in South America that were difficult to categorize within the theory. Because some indigenous societies, such as the Aztecs and Inca, were sometimes seen as civilized, they could not be easily seen as savage. South American indigenous societies offer the opportunity to understand what Smith focused on in his evaluation of a civilized society, yet they were not obvious cases for making clear judgements about their degree of civilization. Smith considered the degree of civilization of each society from the viewpoint of such absolute evaluation as economic development but also of relative evaluation by which he compared one society to another. Smith evaluated societies absolutely, or according to what manner of subsistence each society had. He also adopted the relative evaluation in investigating the level of civilization of Peru and Mexico, both of which were not fully civilized nor savage. Smith also used the relative evaluation in examining the moral quality of each society.\n\n12This paper is an attempt to understand how Smith discussed South America by elucidating how travel books on South America influenced Smith, how he recognized the impact of colonization through these books (Section II), and how this perspective was relative to his view of civilization (Section III). Smith then transformed the image of people and societies in South America.\n\nSmith on South America\n\n13In his WN, Smith analysed the effects of colonization on South America. He examined both the negative and positive impacts of colonization. In reviewing it, he referred to the profits from mining, the impact of colonial government, and economic progress, the progress that was especially relevant to his evaluation of indigenous people in South America. In his analysis, he mentioned travel literature on South America and sometimes transformed his views of societies on the continent.\n\n16 Smith, WN, I. xi. c. 26.\n\nNeither are the profits of the undertakers of silver mines commonly very great in Peru. The same most respectable and well-informed authors acquaint us that when any person undertakes to work a new mine in Peru, he is universally looked upon as a man destined to bankruptcy.\n\n16Smith again referred to Frézier, Juan and Ulloa.\n\n17Smith, nonetheless, presented only one side of the story. Indeed, in his book, Frézier wrote, 'according to the nature of the mines, and the richness of the veins, every caxon, or 50 quintals, that is, hundred weight, yields four, five, or six ounces: when it yields but two, the miner does not make good his charges, which often happens.' He also said,\n\n17 Frézier, Amédée François. A Voyage to the South-Sea, and along the coasts of Chili and Peru, in (...)\n\nHe [the miner] also sometimes good amends made him, when he meets with good veins: for the gold mines are, of all those which produce metals, the most unequal [...] they [veins] have sometimes made a man wealth at once; and this same inequality sometimes ruins then, which is the reason that is more rare to see a gold miner rich than a silver miner, or of any other metal, tho' there be less expence in drawing it from the mineral.\n\n18While he admitted that the miners did not always make a profit, he acknowledged that they could be wealthy in cases other than gold mines. This suggests that the silver miners did not necessarily fail in every instance.\n\n20Smith ignored the information that the mines could be profitable because Smith's theory of political economy presupposed that the mines were not promising. Because he supposed that the mines produced low profits, he viewed prospecting for gold and silver as disadvantageous. If the mines had been worthwhile, his theory of colonial political economy could not have been supported. Instead, he selected information that was favourable for his economic theory, which denied the profitability of mines.\n\n22Second, Smith also argued the harmfulness of colonial government in South America. He wrote:\n\n20 Smith, WN, IV. vii. b. 52.\n\nAbsolute government of Spain, Portugal, and France, on the contrary, take place in their colonies; and the discretionary powers which such governments commonly delegate to all their inferior officers are, on account of the great distance, naturally exercised there with more than ordinary violence [...] But the European colonies in America are more remote than the most distant provinces of the greatest empires which had ever been known before.\n\n23He then thought of British colonies in America as an exception. He wrote,\n\n21 Smith, WN, IV. vii. b. 52.\n\nThe government of the English colonies is perhaps the only one which, since the world began, could give perfect security to the inhabitants of so very distant a province. The administration of the French colonies, however, has always been conducted with more gentleness and moderation than that of the Spanish and Portuguese. This superiority of conduct is suitable both to the character of the French nation, and to what forms the character of every nation, the nature of their government, which though arbitrary and violent in comparison with that of Great Britain, is legal and free in comparison with those of Spain and Portugal.\n\n25Smith did not necessarily deny the positive effects of colonial government. Because America and the West Indies were distant from Europe, he wrote:\n\n23 Smiith, WN, IV. vii. b. 6.\n\nTheir great distance from Europe has in all of them alleviated more or less the effects of this dependency. Their situation has placed them less in view and less in the power of their mother country. In pursuing their interest their own way, their conduct has, upon many occasions, been overlooked, either because not known or not understood in Europe [...] Even the violent and arbitrary government of Spain has, upon many occasions, been obliged to recall or soften the orders which had been given for the government of her colonies, for fear of a general insurrection.\n\n26Although Smith criticized imperialism, including British imperialism vehemently, this did not necessarily mean that there were no good effects of colonization. He analysed both the positive and negative impacts of colonization. He referred to colonies in South America to illustrate the harmfulness of bad colonial governance on colonial societies.\n\n30 Juan and Ulloa, Voyage historique, i. 443-5, trans. John Adams, ii. 53-55. (On this point, see also (...)\n\nThe Spanish families are very numerous; Lima, according to the lowest computation, containing sixteen or eighteen thousand whites [...] The negroes, Mulattoes, and their descendants, form the greater number of the inhabitants [...] The third, and last class of inhabitants, are Indians and Mestizos, but these are very small in proportion to the largeness of the city, and the multitudes of the second class.\n\n31Although Juan and Ulloa did not indicate the specific size of the population, it seems that they regarded Lima as populous.\n\n32This view presupposed that societies in South America did not make much progress before colonization. Smith selected some of these views of indigenous societies in South America. He wrote,\n\n31 Smith, WN, IV. i. 33.\n\nThe discovery of a passage to the East Indies, by the Cape of Good Hope [...] opened, perhaps, a still more extensive range to foreign commerce than even that of America [...] There were but two nations in America, in any respect superior to savages, and these were destroyed almost as soon as discovered. The rest were mere savages. But the empires of China, Indostan, Japan, as well as several others in the East Indies, without having richer mines of gold and silver, were in every other respect much richer, better cultivated, and more advanced in the arts and manufactures than either Mexico or Peru, even though we should credit, what plainly deserves no credit, the exaggerated accounts of the Spanish writers, concerning the ancient state of those empires.\n\n35Because both societies in America were not fully ‘civilized’, abundant undeveloped lands remained. As a result, colonization became the moment to enhance societies in South America through land cultivation.\n\n36These three points on the mines, colonization, and population are essential for considering Smith's theory of political economy.\n\n37First, Smith did not think gold and silver mines were the sources of development in South America. As I argued, Smith negated this view. His political economy assumed that the abundance of gold and silver did not lead to economic growth, so he needed to negate the development of prosperity through mining.\n\n39Third, Smith saw the indigenous societies in South America as uncivilized, and this description was important for understanding how Smith grasped societies with abundant resources such as land. In Asia, where a great amount of land was cultivated, Smith saw it as relatively civilized. On the other hand, Smith saw as uncivilized societies in South America where there remained abundant undeveloped land. This presupposes that the unutilized land was not in use in any other way and implies underdevelopment. Based on this perspective of political economy, Smith assigned a degree of civilization to South America.\n\nThe Ambivalence of Civilization\n\n42This section argues that when Smith adopted the development model that moved from savagery to civilization, Smith also found historical realities that deviated from this model. This was not necessarily an anomaly but sometimes coherent with his other model of civilization using moral quality in society. For Smith, moral quality differs not only from person to person but also from society to society.\n\n44Indeed, in TMS, Smith saw the Amerindian people as virtuous. He said:\n\n44 Smith, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, ed. by D. D. Raphael and A. L. Macfie (Indianapolis : Libert (...)\n\nThe savages in North America, we are told, assume upon all occasions the greatest indifference, and would think themselves degraded if they should ever appear in any respect to be overcome, either by love, or grief, or resentment. Their magnanimity and self-command, in this respect, are almost beyond the conception of Europeans.\n\n50Smith also recognized this point when examining the process of colonization. He wrote,\n\n56 Smith, TMS, V. 2. 9.\n\nThere is no negro from the coast of Africa who does not, in this respect, possess a degree of magnanimity that the soul of his sordid master is too often scarce capable of conceiving. Fortune never exerted more cruelly her empire over mankind, than when she subjected those nations of heroes to the refuse of the jails of Europe, to wretches who possess the virtues neither of the countries which they come from, nor of those which they go to, and whose levity, brutality, and baseness, so justly expose them to the contempt of the vanquished.'\n\n51Smith was impressed by the savages' virtues, which ceased to be seen in civilized societies. Although Smith did not think their virtues were necessary for civilized people, the virtues were still moral qualities that Smith approbated. Although he did not perceive all civilized people as morally degraded, at least some of them fell short in virtue and attacked savage people who had 'magnanimity' and were from 'nations of heroes.' In this sense, Smith supposed that the course of civilization, in reality, involved a process of moral degradation because of colonization. Colonization for Smith had moral implications. Smith, as a moralist, lamented the morality of colonizers.\n\n55In this sense, Smith became skeptical of improving morality in civilized society. In contrast, as I argued, Smith re-evaluated the moral quality of the people he identified as savage or barbarous. Smith then considered the self-control of indigenous people in the Americas an excellent example of moral goodness. Smith continued to think about the effects of civilization. Although Smith's political economy supposed that the degree of civilization depended upon economic development and social security, this does not mean that savagery or barbarism were morally inferior to civilization. Smith posed the problem of the ambivalence of civilization, by which civilizing processes were not necessarily affirmative but were ambivalent.\n\n57Although Smith became more critical of the effects of civilization in the sixth edition, even before that edition of TMS, this ambivalent evaluation of civilization had already existed. As I argued, especially in arguing for the moral superiority of savage people, he supposed that such moral qualities were lost in civilized societies. Smith's moralist stance enabled him to keep distance from their full affirmation.\n\nConclusion\n\n58By reading travel books on South America, Smith examined the effects of colonization. He then transformed the descriptions of the societies and their people in South America to extract both positive and negative impacts of colonization. Whereas the original descriptions of people in South America were complex and nuanced, Smith simplified and abused these reports. To evaluate the positive impact of colonization, Smith supposed that some societies in South America such as Peru and Mexico were civilized compared to other societies there, but were not civilized fully, so colonized societies could be seen as their promise of progress. This view depended on Smith's perspective of political economy in which economic happiness and social security were essential for the degree of civilization. Smith then judged the level of civilization according to its degree of economic development. Despite this absolute evaluation, Smith also introduced another criterion, and considering the degree of civilization according to its relative evaluation. We can find out the relative evaluation in seeing how Smith reviewed Peru and Mexico. He also adopted the relative evaluation in understanding the moral quality of the savage people. In this sense, Smith continued to think about the ambivalent effects of civilization.\n\n59Smith found the savage people morally superior to civilized people. Smith, as a moral philosopher, appreciated the moral quality of the former. Smith did not necessarily see European civilization as the goal of social development in every aspect and did not deeply affirm the virtues of civilization. However, as a political economist, he admired the effects of civilization, in which people could enjoy a better economic life than in savagery. Unlike the state of civilization, that of savagery was short of economic prosperity. Because of this shortage, savage people could have more self-command than civilized people. The latter tended to lose the sense of self-command because of their economic prosperity, by which they could feel safe and relaxed, resulting in lowering their degree of self-control. In this sense, economic prosperity was linked with moral damage. Smith found this tension between economic and moral evaluations.\n\n60This tension was derived from Smith's two criteria for evaluating societies : the economic development of society from savagery to civilization and its moral transformation or degradation."
