Smith wrote two classic works, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). The latter, often abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations, is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics. In his work, Adam Smith introduced his theory of absolute advantage.\n\nSmith was born in Kirkcaldy, in the Kingdom of Fife, Scotland. His father, also Adam Smith, was a Scottish Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate and prosecutor (judge advocate) and also served as comptroller of the customs in Kirkcaldy. Smith's mother was born Margaret Douglas, daughter of the landed Robert Douglas of Strathendry, also in Fife; she married Smith's father in 1720. Two months before Smith was born, his father died, leaving his mother a widow. The date of Smith's baptism into the Church of Scotland at Kirkcaldy was 5 June 1723 and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth, which is unknown.\n\nTestament of Adam Smith, Edinburgh Commissary Court, 1791\n\nCC8/8/128/2, pp. 1109-1116\n\n21 Jan[uar]y 1791\n\nTest[ament] Test[amenta]r Adam Smith\n\nThe Testament Testamentar & Inventary of the debt and sum of money which was addebted and resting owing to Umq[uhi]l Adam Smith L.D.D one of the commissioners of his Majesties Customs for Scotland at the time of his decease who died upon the.... day of .... seventeen hundred and ninety years In so far as concerns the Nomination of his sole Executor and now Faithfully made and given up by David Douglas youngest son of Colonel Rob[er]t Douglas of Strathendry In so far as concerns the inventary of the said defunct his debt and sum of money after mentioned which David Douglas he the said Umq[uhi]l Adam Smith did nominate and appoint to be his sole Executor and universal Legator and Intromitter with his moveable estate And that by his Disposition and Settlement bearing date the said sixth day of February one thousand seven hundred and ninety registred in the books of Council & Session (office C.
