        "text": "popular name: Tom Carvel\n\ndate_of_death: October 21, 1990\n\nage: 84\n\ncause_of_death: Heart attack\n\nclaim_to_fame: Business and Finance\n\nbest_know_for: Tom Carvel was the creator of soft serve ice cream and one of the founding fathers of the franchise system in America. When his ice cream truck suffered a flat tire in New York in 1934, he sold his melting ice cream from a parking lot. A self-made success story, his name is synonymous with the product he created—soft-serve ice cream. He was also the first chief executive officer of a company who served as his own spokesperson/commercial announcer for radio and television. He proved that movie-star looks and a professional “announcing voice” were not necessary for building product sales. Carvel’s gravelly voice did just fine in creating effective commercials. “Thinny thin ice cream for your fatty fat friends” may perhaps be the most memorable (if not most offensive) of his ad lines. Those humble beginnings eventually grew into the Carvel ice cream chain with 850 locations and a fortune conservatively estimated at around $80 million at the time of his death. Soon after the legal fighting started and it hasn’t stopped yet.\n\npopular name: Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.\n\ndate_of_death: November 18, 1969\n\nage: 81\n\ncause_of_death: Series of stokes and heart attacks\n\nclaim_to_fame: Business and Finance\n\nbest_know_for: Joseph P. Kennedy is best known for being the father of three political leaders: President John F. Kennedy, U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy and Robert Kennedy, who served as a U.S. senator and attorney general. Kennedy became a bank president by age 25, also holding positions as a shipyard manager and movie studio owner. By age 30, he was a millionaire. In 1937, Kennedy became the first Irish-American ambassador to Britain, serving in that position until 1940. A prominent American businessman, investor and politician, Kennedy is known for his own political prominence as well as that of his children and was the patriarch of the Irish-American Kennedy family."
