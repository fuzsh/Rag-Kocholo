        "text": "The Royal Mile, Edinburgh EH1 1RN\n\nDavid Hume (1711–76), incongruously portrayed in this statue as an ancient Greek philosopher rather than a mid-eighteenth-century man of letters, is perhaps the best known figure of the Scottish Enlightenment. In the eighteenth century Edinburgh witnessed an unprecedented flowering of science, literature and philosophy. Hume was a contemporary of Adam Smith (1723–90), the great political economist, Adam Ferguson (1721–1816), the social theorist, Joseph Black (1727–99), the pioneering chemist and James Hutton (1726–97), the geologist. These figures all knew each other and socialised together in the convivial atmosphere of Edinburgh’s many clubs and hostelries. Together they helped develop many of the ideas and theories that made the modern world.\n\nFind out more\n\nBBC – Great thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment\n\nBritish Council – Scottish Enlightenment\n\nStanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy – Scottish Philosophy in the Eighteenth Century\n\n192 The Royal Mile, Edinburgh EH1 1RF\n\nThe great economic theorist Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy in 1723. He studied moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow under Frances Hutcheson, whose chair he would later inherit. Hutcheson, a charismatic minister, had been one of David Hume’s most vociferous opponents. Smith also gave public lectures in Edinburgh including one on the ‘progress of opulence’, which formed the basis of his most famous work, The Wealth of Nations (1776). Influenced by an idea of Hume’s on the ‘partition of employments’ he isolated the basic principle that explains all social improvement: the division of labour. Smith is often portrayed as the prophet of neo-liberalism, but his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) shows a deep concern for the role of conscience and sympathy in human affairs.\n\nFind out more\n\nThe University of Glasgow Story – Adam Smith\n\nBBC History – Adam Smith (1723-1790)\n\nMelville Dr, Edinburgh EH9 9EX\n\nThis large public park used to be a lake known as the South Loch until the early eighteenth century. The loch provided much of the city’s drinking water until 1621, when the first piped water supply was established. Its draining and conversion into a park by Sir Thomas Hope in 1722 is a good example of the Enlightenment enthusiasm for ‘improvement’. Later in the century it became a favourite place for James Hutton, the geologist, Adam Smith, the economist, and Joseph Black, the chemist, to take a stroll and discuss the latest ideas in science and philosophy.\n\nFind out more\n\nFriends of the Meadows and Bruntsfield Links – History and Archaeology\n\n13 Sylvan Place, Edinburgh EH9 1LH\n\nUp an alleyway here you will find the house where the great chemist Joseph Black lived in around 1740. To get to the university from here Black only had to walk across the Meadows, where he often took a stroll with his friends the economist and political philosopher Adam Smith and the geologist James Hutton. Among his important contributions to chemistry were the discovery of carbon dioxide and latent heat. He discovered the latter principle when he observed that applying heat to boiling water produces more steam, but does not raise its temperature above its boiling point.\n\nNo public access.\n\nFind out more\n\nNational Library of Scotland, Scottish Science Hall of Fame: Joseph Black (1789–1799)\n\nSchool of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh: Joseph Black (1789–1799)\n\nEducation Scotland, Scottish Enlightenment: Joseph Black, Scientist (1728–1799)\n\nFor International Women’s Day on March 8, we are launching a new tour featuring locations in Edinburgh connected to amazing women in STEM. Celebrate equality, diversity and inclusion in STEM by taking a look at Edinburgh-connected women who have made an impact in a wide range of STEM fields.\n\nCheck out our new bird trail! We are currently working on the development of coastal trails, in collaboration with Traveltech for Scotland and the Royal Society of Edinburgh’s Young Academy Scotland’s Coastal Knowledge map. Here you can upload your own experiences of the coast, including birds you have spotted.\n\nLast year we added the Second World War tour developed by academics from the schools of Social and Political Science and History, Classics and Archeology."
