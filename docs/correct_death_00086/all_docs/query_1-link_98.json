The exact date of his birth is unknown, however, he was baptized on June 5, 1723. Smith was the Scottish philosopher who became famous for his book, The Wealth of NationsÂ written in 1776, which had a profound influence on modern economics and concepts of individual freedom.\n\nIn 1751, Smith was appointed professor of logic at Glasgow university, transferring in 1752 to the chair of moral philosophy. His lectures covered the field of ethics, rhetoric, jurisprudence and political economy, or Ã¢â¬Åpolice and revenue.Ã¢â¬Â In 1759 he published his Theory of Moral Sentiments, embodying some of his Glasgow lectures. This work was about those standards of ethical conduct that hold society together, with emphasis on the general harmony of human motives and activities under a beneficent Providence.\n\nSmith moved to London in 1776, where he published An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, which examined in detail the consequences of economic freedom. It covered such concepts as the role of self-interest, the division of labor, the function of markets, and the international implications of a laissez-faire economy. Wealth of Nations established economics as an autonomous subject and launched the economic doctrine of free enterprise.\n\nSmith laid the intellectual framework that explained the free market and still holds true today. He is most often recognized for the expression the invisible hand,Â which he used to demonstrate how self-interest guides the most efficient use of resources in a nation's economy, with public welfare coming as a by-product. To underscore his laissez-faire convictions, Smith argued that state and personal efforts, to promote social good are ineffectual compared to unbridled market forces.\n\nIn 1778, he was appointed to a post of commissioner of customs in Edinburgh, Scotland. He died there on July 17, 1790, after an illness. At the end it was discovered that Smith had devoted a considerable part of his income to numerous secret acts of charity.\n\nSOURCE: http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jun/smith.html\n\nFood For Thought\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAn article on the ten greatest economists ever to live describes Adam Smith thus\n\n\"A key figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, Smith is the giant on whose shoulders subsequent economists have stood. He is best known for The Wealth Of Nations, his 1776 landmark book on economics, published at the dawn of the Industrial Revolution - and was even consulted on economic matters by Pitt The Elder, the Whig politician and Prime Minister. His arguments for free trade, market competition and the morality of private enterprise remain as fresh and influential as when written over 200 years ago. That said, Smith - who studied and later taught at Glasgow University - saw only a limited role for government and was hostile to economic nationalism. However, his arguments have at times been misinterpreted by free marketeers in recent decades. The fact is that he did not believe in 'laissezfaire' (an earlier French doctrine opposing any government intervention in economic matters) - he saw government's sole job as to establish law and justice, and provide for the nation's education and basic infrastructure.\"\n\nOne can best inform people about the brilliance of this man by looking at a short timeline of his life and the events of the world at that time in chronological order.\n\nA FEW QUOTES OF ADAM SMITH\n\nIt is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\n\nMen desire to have some share in the management of public affairs chiefly on account of the importance which it gives them.\n\nMercy to the guilty is cruelty to the innocent\n\nNobody but a beggar chuses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow-citizens.\n\nWherever there is great property, there is great inequality.\n\nThe subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government, as nearly as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.\n\nHonour makes a great part of the reward of all honourable professions.\n\nEvery tax must finally be paid from someone or other of those three different sorts of revenue [rent, profit, or wages], or from all of them indifferently.\n\nIt is not very unreasonable that the rich should contribute to the public expense, not only in proprtion to their revenue, but something more than their proportion\n\nEvery man is, no doubt, by nature, first and principally recommended to his own care; and as he is fitter to take care of himself than of any other person, it is fit and right that it should be so.\n\nOne who is master of all his exercises has no aversion to measure his strength and activity with the strongest.\n\nBefore we can feel much for others, we must in some measure be at ease ourselves.\n\nBy pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\n\nWherever there is great property, there is great inequality.\n\nIt is unjust that the whole of society should contribute towards an expence of which the benefit is confined to a part of the society.\n\nThe real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it.\n\nThey are the most frivolous and superficial of mankind who can be much delighted with that praise which they themselves know to be unmerited.\n\nNever complain of that of which it is at all times within your power to rid."
