        "text": "Adam Smith was born in 1723 in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Smith was one of the principals of a period of astonishing learning that has become known as the Scottish Enlightenment, which included groundbreaking innovations in everything from medicine to geology to chemistry to philosophy to economics. Smith is the author of two published books: The Theory of Moral Sentiments (TMS), in 1759, and An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (WN), in 1776. TMS brought Smith considerable acclaim during his lifetime and was soon considered one of the great works of moral theory—impressing, for example, Charles Darwin (1809–82), who in his 1871 Descent of Man endorsed and accepted several of Smith’s “striking” conclusions. And TMS went through fully six revised editions during Smith’s lifetime. Yet since the nineteenth century, Smith’s fame has largely rested on his second book, which, whether judged by its influence or its greatness, must be considered one of the most important works of the second millennium.\n\nNot many details of Smith’s boyhood are known. He was born on the 5th of June and was an only child. His father, also named Adam Smith, died shortly before he was born. In his 1793 Account of the Life and Writings of Adam Smith, LL.D., Smith’s student Dugald Stewart reports that Smith’s “constitution during infancy was infirm and sickly, and required all the tender solicitude of his surviving parent. She was blamed for treating him with an unlimited indulgence; but it produced no unfavourable effects on his temper or his dispositions” (Smith, 1982a: 269). Perhaps one anecdote from Smith’s childhood bears repeating. Margaret, Smith’s mother, would regularly take him to Strathenry, about seven miles northwest of Kirkaldy, to visit her brother, Smith’s uncle. On one visit, when the wee Smith was but three years old, he was playing in front of his uncle’s house and was kidnapped by a passing group of “gypsies.” The alarm was raised and the kidnappers were discovered and overtaken in the nearby Leslie wood, whereupon the wailing toddler was safely returned to his family. Stewart writes that Smith’s uncle, who recovered Smith, “was the happy instrument of preserving to the world a genius, which was destined, not only to extend the boundaries of science, but to enlighten and reform the commercial policy of Europe” (Smith, 1982: 270).\n\nSmith matriculated at the University of Glasgow in 1737 at the age of fourteen and in 1740 was elected as a Snell exhibitioner at Balliol College, Oxford. Smith was apparently not impressed with the quality of instruction at Oxford, however. As he wrote years later in WN, “In the university of Oxford, the greater part of the public professors have, for these many years, given up altogether even the pretence of teaching” (WN: 761). Smith was able to make good use of the libraries at Oxford, however, studying widely in English, French, Greek, and Latin literature. He left Oxford and returned to Kirkcaldy in 1746.\n\nIn 1748, at the invitation of Henry Home Lord Kames (1696–1782), Smith began giving in Edinburgh “Lectures on Rhetoric and the Belles Lettres,” focusing on literary criticism and the arts of speaking and writing well. It was during this time that Smith met and befriended the great Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–76), who was to become Smith’s closest confidant and greatest philosophical influence. Smith left Edinburgh to become Professor of Logic at the University of Glasgow in 1751, and then Professor of Moral Philosophy in 1752. The lectures he gave at Glasgow eventually crystallized into The Theory of Moral Sentiments, which was published to great acclaim in 1759.\n\nIn 1763 Smith resigned his post at Glasgow to become the personal tutor of Henry Scott, the Third Duke of Buccleuch, whom Smith then accompanied on an eighteen-month tour of France and Switzerland. During these travels with the young Duke, Smith met Voltaire (1694–1778), on whom Smith apparently made quite an impression: Voltaire later wrote, “This Smith is an excellent man! We have nothing to compare with him, and I am embarrassed for my dear compatriots” (Muller, 1993: 15). Smith also met François Quesnay (1694–1774), Jacques Turgot (1727–81), and others among the so-called French Physiocrats, who were arguing for a relaxation of trade barriers and generally laissez-faire economic policies. Although Smith had already been developing his own similar ideas, conversations with the Physiocrats no doubt helped him reﬁne and sharpen them. In 1767, Smith returned to Kirkcaldy to care for his ailing mother and to continue work on what would become his Wealth of Nations. During this time he was supported by a generous pension from the Duke of Buccleuch, enabling him to focus on his scholarly work. It was widely known that the celebrated author of TMS was working furiously on a new book, and the ten years he labored on it raised expectations high indeed. Finally, at long last, Smith’s magnum opus was published on March 9, 1776.\n\nSmith remained in Kirkcaldy until 1778, when he became Commissioner of Customs in Edinburgh. During the decade or so that he spent in Kirkcaldy, and then thereafter when he was in Edinburgh, Smith spent a great deal of time visiting with and entertaining friends, among whom he counted Irish Catholic philosopher and statesman Edmund Burke (1729–97), the chemist Joseph Black (1728–99), the geologist James Hutton (1726–97), the mechanical engineer James Watt (1736–1819), Prime Minister Frederick (Lord) North (1732–92), and Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger (1759–1806). He also took active roles in learned organizations like the Oyster Club, the Poker Club, and the Select Society, the last of which included among its members William Robertson (1721–1793), David Hume, James Burnett Lord Monboddo (1714–99), Adam Ferguson (1723–1816), and Lord Kames. In 1783, Smith was a founding member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, which exists still today as Scotland’s premier national academy of science and letters. Having previously served as the University of Glasgow’s Dean of Arts (1760) and Vice-Rector (1761–63), in 1787 he was elected Lord Rector of the university, a post he held until 1789.\n\nDuring his years in Edinburgh, Smith extensively revised both TMS and WN for new editions. In 1785, he wrote to Le Duc de La Rochefoucauld that “I [Smith] have likewise two other great works upon the anvil; the one is a sort of Philosophical History of all the diﬀerent branches of Literature, of Philosophy, Poetry and Eloquence; the other is a sort of theory and History of Law and Government” (Smith, 1987: 248). Neither of these projects was ever published, however. In the days before he died, Smith summoned his friends Black and Hutton to his quarters and asked that they burn his unpublished manuscripts, a request they had resisted on previous occasions. This time Smith insisted. They reluctantly complied, destroying sixteen volumes of manuscripts. It is probable that Smith’s philosophical history of literature, philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, and his theory and history of law and government were among the works that perished in that tragic loss.\n\nAdam Smith died in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 and is buried in the Canongate cemetery off High Street in Edinburgh.\n\nA short overview of Smith's life and writings\n\nFrom the Foundation for Economic Education, this overview of Smith was written by Richard M.

Smith worked on both books throughout his life, yet their perspectives seem so different. Otteson argues that the books focus on social behavior and the institutions that sustain that behavior--market transactions in The Wealth of Nations and moral behavior in The Theory of Moral Sentiments.\n\nThe Published Works of Adam Smith\n\nSmith: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\n\nFrom the website of the Library of Economics and Liberty, this edition of Smith’s An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations is based on Edwin Cannan’s careful 1904 compilation of Smith’s fifth edition of the book (1789), the final edition in Smith’s lifetime.\n\nSmith: The Theory of Moral Sentiments\n\nFrom the website of the Library of Economics and Liberty, Smith’s The Theory of Moral Sentiments outlines his view of proper conduct and the institutions and sentiments that make men virtuous.
