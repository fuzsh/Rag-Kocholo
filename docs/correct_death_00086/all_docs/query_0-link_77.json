        "text": "Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments, was among a number of leading financial and economic guests paying tribute to Adam Smith, author of the celebrated Wealth of Nations.\n\nScots-born philosopher and economist Smith has been brought back to life in a lively series of discussions to commemorate the revival of Panmure House in Edinburgh.\n\nEdinburgh Business School, part of Heriot-Watt University, have spent several million refurbishing Smith’s home off the Canongate, making it a location for the study of global economics. Smith died in the home in 1790.\n\nThe home will be officially reopened by Edinburgh Business School later in the year.\n\nQuoting Smith, Milligan said: “The first thing you have to know is yourself. A man who knows himself can step outside himself and watch his own reaction like an observer,’’ which is from Smith’s first major work, The Theory of Moral Sentiments.’’\n\nMilligan also quoted Sir John Templeton, the well-known investor, who said: “Bull markets are born in pessimism, grow on scepticism, chill on optimism, and die in euphoria.’’ He went on to talk about what was driving the markets. “As a professional investor, I should be trying to sell at the top and buy at the bottom.’’\n\nMilligan told the audience that the market was three-quarters of the way through its cycle.\n\n“Everyone is very sceptical because they think the US is about to go into recession with Trumps’ trade restriction, they are worried about emerging markets issues and the Federal Reserve’s interest rates. But no, no, no.‘’\n\nHe said he was not deeply concerned about the deteriorating Turkish economic situation, where it could default on its debt, saying it was not on the scale of the Asian crisis.\n\n“The important thing is we have several years of strong economic growth at least in front of us because the US economy is booming away. Trump is throwing petrol on the fire and corporate profits are going like billy-o. Corporate profits in the second quarter are up 27% from a year earlier. And that’s what we buy. We buy cash flow from corporate profits.’’\n\nHe conceded that 2020 might be much more difficult year.\n\n“I’m going to navigate this carefully and wait for the signs of euphoria and start selling for all those defined contribution schemes with manage for many people.’’\n\n“Cash levels are currently very high indeed and people are very nervous and not putting their cash to work, so one of the things to look for is whether people are talking all their hard-earned cash savings and putting them into the stock market saying it’s the only game in town. We’re a long way away from this.’’\n\nThe lively sessions, called The Butcher, the Brewer and the Baker, were hosted by Merryn Somerset Webb, the FT columnist and Editor of MoneyWeek, in the Panmure House library.\n\nThe panel also tackled the Brexit debate and the issue of freedom of movement of people. James Lewisohn, an investment fund advisor and chairman of the Investment Committee of Poul and Erna Sehested Hansens Fond, a Danish medical charity, explained: “In 2004, we opened our borders.\n\n\"This was the year that ten new members joined the EU, including Latvia and Poland. Most people think that a Polish plumber could go anywhere on day one.\n\n\"They could go to France or Germany, but this wasn’t true. For the first seven years, the Polish plumber could only go to the UK or Ireland and Sweden. Every other country had transitional controls which prevented that happening.\"\n\nThen in 2011, the Polish plumber was able to go to Germany but this happened just as the Eurozone crisis impacted on countries across southern Europe, including Greece, Spain and Italy.\n\n“This brought a second wave of migration from another part of European from the Eurozone periphery of France and Spain, when many unemployed Spaniards and Italians were coming here to work. This has been wonderful in many waves, but not in every way. But it has brought a tidal wave of immigration that other European countries simply haven’t had.’’\n\nIn 2004, the foreign-born population was 8%, by 2011 it had risen to 12%. The foreign-born population of Germany and Italy has fallen during the same period.\n\n“So when Europeans talk about free movement it is an aspiration but it is something we as a country have actually done in size. None of the other nations have.’’\n\nOther panelists for the series included Norman Lamont, the former Chancellor for the Exchequer."
