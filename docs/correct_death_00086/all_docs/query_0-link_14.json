        "text": "Built in 1691, Panmure House is the final remaining home of economist and philosopher Adam Smith, who occupied the House from 1778 until his death there in 1790.\n\nDuring his tenancy, Smith completed the final editions of his magnum opus The Wealth of Nations, and regularly hosted key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nRescued and restored by Edinburgh Business School, Heriot-Watt University, it is now a new centre for global economic and social debate, not normally accessible to the public."
