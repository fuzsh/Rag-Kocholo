        "text": "Adam Smith is known as the founder of modern economics. He is the University of Glasgowâ€™s most famous alumn and one of its first world changers.\n\nSmith was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife. His father, a customs officer, died before he was born and Smith was raised by his mother.\n\nHe came to the University of Glasgow in 1737 at the age of 14 and studied under the famous philosopher Francis Hutcheson. Smith was a gifted student and won a scholarship to continue his studies at Oxford (1740-46).\n\nReturning to Scotland, Smith became a teacher in Edinburgh, where he gave popular classes on philosophy and literature. He joined the clubs and societies of the Scottish Enlightenment along with friends like the philosopher David Hume.\n\nThe Scottish Enlightenment believed that science, learning and education would help banish superstition, ignorance and bigotry. They believed that the light of learning would improve society and help us lead happier and more fulfilled lives."
