        "text": "The conference is designed to showcase cutting-edge studies exploring the intricate interplay between market-based and moral approaches in achieving sustainability and carbon neutrality and advancing Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices.\n\nIn examining these approaches, we draw inspiration from the timeless insights of Adam Smith’s two influential works, “The Wealth of Nations” and “The Theory of Moral Sentiments”. While the former underscores the power of free markets and the concept of the “invisible hand”, the latter delves into the moral underpinnings of human behaviour and importance of social cohesion in ethical decision-making.\n\nBuilding upon the profound ideas of Adam Smith, our conference aims to investigate how market-based solutions, align with the principles of free markets while considering the ethical dimensions of environmental responsibility. We are keen on shedding light on the potential synergy between market mechanisms and moral sentiments in fostering sustainable finance and accelerating the transition to a net-zero emissions future.\n\nWe invite you to join us in Edinburgh immediately following the Edinburgh Festivals for an enriching and inspiring gathering. Here, thought leaders, researchers, and practitioners come together to exchange innovative ideas, share cutting-edge research, and collectively contribute to shaping a sustainable and responsible future.\n\nKeynote Speakers\n\nProfessor Sir Oliver Hart, Harvard University (2016 Nobel Prize Laureate in Economics)\n\nProfessor Steven Ongena, University of Zurich\n\nProfessor Richard Tol, University of Sussex\n\nProfessor Grigory Vilkov, Frankfurt School of Finance & Management\n\nConference Chair\n\nProfessor Gavin Jack, Dean of Business School, University of Edinburgh\n\nConference Information\n\nAdam Smith ESG Conference & The 2nd BAR Annual Conference\n\nView the Conference Programme\n\nSpecial Issue\n\nThe conference will lead to a Special Issue (SI) for the British Accounting Review (Rated A* in ABDC Journal Quality Guide and 3 in Academic Journal Guide).
