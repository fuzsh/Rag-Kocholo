Adam Smith, the moral philosopher and political economist who wrote ‘An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations’, died In Edinburgh on 17 July 1790, aged 67.

We’d love to find out more about the papers that he destroyed before he died – the ones that he deemed ‘not fit for the public eye’. Hmm, it does make one wonder what he destroyed…
