        "text": "Grand Duke of Russia\n\nIn this name that follows Eastern Slavic naming customs, the patronymic is Alexandrovich.\n\nGrand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia (Russian: Великий Князь Александр Александрович Романов; 7 June 1869 – 2 May 1870) was the second son of the Tsesarevich and Tsesarevna of Russia, later Emperor Alexander III and Empress Maria.\n\nGrand Duke Alexander's father was heir apparent to the Russian throne as the eldest living son of Emperor Alexander II of Russia. The Grand Duke was Alexander and Marie's second child, second son, and the younger brother of the future Emperor Nicholas II.\n\nAlexander died of bacterial meningitis in 1870, one month before his first birthday.[1] Following his death, his mother wrote to her own mother, Queen Louise of Denmark: \"The doctors maintain he did not suffer, but we suffered terribly to see and hear him.\"[2] The only photo taken of the Grand Duke was taken posthumously.\n\nSergei D. Sheremetev, the adjutant to Tsarevich Alexander, accompanied the body on horseback to the Peter and Paul Fortress.[3] The grand duke was buried in the northern nave of the Peter and Paul Cathedral in a white marble sarcophagus.[4]\n\nAncestry\n\n[edit]"
