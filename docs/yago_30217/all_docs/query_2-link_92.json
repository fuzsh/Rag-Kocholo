        "text": "Olga Karnovich was a married woman with four young children when she began an affair with the recently-widowed Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich. Her husband was an aide de camp to Paul’s brother, though the pair were able to keep the affair secret until Olga attended a court ball wearing a stunning diamond necklace that had belonging to Paul’s mother. The necklace had been a gift from Paul and was immediately recognized by the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, who had her promptly escorted out. To avoid any further scandal, Paul was shipped off to a different regimental command, but it was too late: Olga was already pregnant with Paul’s child.\n\nOlga gave birth to their son, Vladimir, on 9 January 1897, and was almost immediately abandoned by her husband. Paul wished to recognize the child as his own and marry Olga against the objections of Tsar Nicholas II. Although Paul had been deeply upset by the death of his first wife - who died after giving birth to their second child - Paul repudiated his other children and spent long periods abroad with his mistress instead, only adding fuel to Nicholas' fire. In 1902, Paul was able to acquire a divorce for Olga after promising under oath. No sooner had the ink dried did Paul break his promise; however, and after purchasing a mansion in France for his mistress and child, Paul married Olga in a Greek Orthodox church in Italy. Paul was banished from Russia, stripped of his military commissions and deprived of his titles and privileges. His brother was appointed as guardian of his two eldest children while Paul and Olga settled in Paris with their son, who would later be joined by two sisters. Although an outcast, Paul was splendidly happy with his new family and fabulous home, which included a staff of sixteen maids, several gardeners, four cooks and two tutors. In 1912, Nicholas finally relented and recognized the marriage as valid; he also restored Paul’s titles, though the family did not return to Russia until 1914 - they were waiting on the house he had commissioned to be completed. Olga was also granted the title of Princess Paley.\n\nAfter the fall of the Russian monarchy, Paul initially remained at his palace in Tsarskoe Selo until the Bolshevicks took power. He was arrested and sent to prison with three of his cousins, also Grand Dukes. Olga furiously attempted to have her husband released, but without success, though she was allowed to visit him twice a week. The Duke’s health, already in decline, sharply fell in early December and he was transferred to a prison hospital on the island of Goloday. He said goodbye to his youngest daughters prior to his departure; Olga then arranged for them to be smuggled out of the country into Finland following the execution of their son by the Bolsheviks at only 21 years old. She last saw her husband on Christmas Day (according to the old calendar), although the new director treated her roughly and would not allow her to stay as long as usual."
