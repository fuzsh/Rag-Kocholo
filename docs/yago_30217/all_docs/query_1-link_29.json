        "text": "The jewel album Grand Duchess Maria Georgievna of Russia\n\nPrincess Maria of Greece and Denmark (Greek: Μαρία) (Russian: Мария Георгиевна; 3 March [O.S. 20 February] 1876 – 14 December 1940) was a daughter of King George I of Greece and his wife Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia. She was a sister of King Constantine I of Greece and a first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.\n\nBorn as a princess of Greece and Denmark, she was educated in Athens by private tutors. She married Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, her first cousin once removed, who courted her for five years.\n\nShe just turned twenty years old when, in April 1896, during the Olympics games held in Athens, King Alexander I of Serbia (last representative of the Obrenović dynasty) proposed to her. Princess Maria found King Alexander too ugly and rejected him.\n\nSince her childhood, Princess Maria of Greece had visited Russia many times with her mother, who remained very attached to her native country. They usually stayed at Pavlovsk Palace with Princess Maria's maternal grandmother, Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna. While in Russia, in summer 1894, for the wedding of her cousin Grand Duchess Xenia to Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, Princess Maria became smitten with the groom's brother, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia, who was her mother's first cousin.However, he had no interest in her then. In a subsequent visit to Russia in the autumn of 1895, they were reunited at a Court Ball. This time she found him too old and boring and was no longer interested. On the other hand, he fell in love with her and asked to marry him. She turned him down, to the dismay of Maria's mother, Queen Olga, who was in favor of a Russian marriage for her daughter.\n\nIn spring 1896, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich arrived in Athens and proposed while they were playing billiards. She accepted him and the engagement was officially announced on 4 April 1896. The wedding was to take place a few months later in the summer. However, she had a change of heart and after putting off the wedding date twice, she broke off the engagement in October.\n\nFor five years, Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia persisted in his intention. Twice a year, he proposed to Princess Maria who continued refusing him, always give her some jewels. This was the reason why she had a lot of smaller jewels from the time before her marriage in her painted collection.\n\nTsar Nicholas II finally intervened, telling the grand duke to make only one more attempt and give up. George Mikhailovich arrived in Greece in spring 1900. This time, under pressure from her family, the Greek princess finally accepted his proposal, yet reluctantly. She made clear that for her it was a marriage of convenience and that her feelings were not going to change. Before she had a change of heart, Queen Olga hurried the wedding. The marriage took place in Greece at the church of the old Venetian fortress in Corfu on 12 May 1900. It was a relatively simple ceremony with the reception held at the Greek Royal family residence in Corfu: Mon Repos. She was then 24 years old and her husband 37\n\nThe wedding took place at Corfu in 1900. Her wedding gifts are splendid we see four of her pearlstrings, pinned at the kokoshnik, which was a gift from Tsar Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra, it was together with an sapphire and diamond fermoir, another in a similar design with 2 row of diamonds and seven rows pearls are around her neck, was also given.\n\nThe diamond link chain as a bordure around the headjewel. and 7 Diamond Buttons from the imperial jewels of Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna of Russia, which died 1891 and left to Grand Duke George a part of her important jewels. The diamond buttons are pinned along her gown and are from two sets of each 8 large and 8 smaller diamond buttons.\n\nClose to her head on top there is a chain of oval diamond ornaments - from \"Cadeau de noce from Imperatrice Marie Feodorovna\"\n\nThe stomacher in front of her gown is of diamonds and rubies again from Grand Duchess Olga Feodorvna of Russia's Ruby Parure.\n\nIHer Imperial Highness, Marie Georgievna Romanova, commonly known as Grand Duchess George the gift from her grandmother Grand Duchess Alexandra Iosifovna of Russia, was a diamond and ruby bracelet.\n\nSource: Russisches Staats Archiv;The Times;"
