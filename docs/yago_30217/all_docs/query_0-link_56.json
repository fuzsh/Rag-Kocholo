Each title offers a FREE “Look Inside” feature.\n\nAll of these titles are available from any AMAZON site in the world and are priced in local currencies [CLICK on any of the following links]: Canada, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Japan, India, Brazil, Mexico and Australia\n\nPlease refer to the links provided below to view this month’s selection – PG\n\nVERA: Princess of the Imperial Blood Vera Konstantinovna\n\nCompiled and Edited by Paul Gilbert\n\nIncludes more than 75 black and white photos!\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER PAPERBACK EDITION\n\nPrincess of the Imperial Blood Vera Konstantinovna (1906-2001), was the youngest child and daughter of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mavrikievna.\n\nVera was a second cousin of Emperor Nicholas II, and a childhood playmate of his younger children. During World War I, she lost her father and brother, and during the Russian Revolution, three of her brothers were murdered by the Bolsheviks.\n\nAt age twelve, she escaped revolutionary Russia, fleeing with her mother and brother George to Sweden. She spent the rest of her long life in exile, first in Western Europe and from the 1950s in the United States.\n\nIn the last years of her life, the Supreme Monarchist Council considered her the Empress of Russia, after whose death there were no heirs to the Russian throne.\n\nVera was the only Romanov who remembered pre-revolutionary life and her legendary relatives. She was a living embodiment of the best traditions of the House of Romanov, enjoyed great respect and respect in the circles of the Russian emigration.\n\nPrincess Vera died on 11 January 2001, at the age of 95. She was buried next to her brother Prince George Konstantinovich at the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Monastery of Novo-Diveevo in Nanuet, New York.\n\nPetrograd: The City of Trouble, 1914-1918\n\nby Meriel Buchanan\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER PAPERBACK EDITION\n\nA compelling first-person account by the daughter of the British Ambassador to Imperial Russia Sir George Buchanan. Meriel Buchanan writes in a colourful, highly readable style that keeps her subject fresh.\n\nHer memories provide a lively and accurate account of the 1917 Revolution, and the terror and horror the new Bolshevik order had on the Russian people\n\nThis is an fascinating account of the tense, eventful months leading to the Revolution. As the war became a disaster for Russia, the author witnessed many of the harrowing scenes in St. Petersburg, often viewing them from the windows of the British Embassy facing the Neva River and bridges where so many of the most important events were played out.\n\nAs events unfolded, Buchanan recalls the Russian soldiers, the wounded in the hospital, the crowds on the street where public speakers held forth – to her, all were upstanding and sympathetic depending on their attitude toward Bolshevism. Those who favoured Bolshevism, she correctly identifies as surly and disreputable.\n\nThe author speaks of the Russian masses in the same way that foreigners always have. In her eyes, they were almost simple-minded — admirable when they were subservient, docile, and humble, but savage when they wanted freedom from the iron grip of tyranny and capitalism.\n\nWhen they fought the Germans, she acknowledges that they fought bravely even though they lacked every essential for fighting, but when they were thrown back by the enemy and flooded into St. Petersburg, in her eyes they became slovenly, lazy, and dirty.\n\nThis book is well worth reading. It demonstrates how diplomats managed, though with difficulty and with the help of many servants, to keep up a privileged existence in a city in the grip of dire circumstances, a city torn apart by events of world-shaking consequence.\n\nA great tool for anyone researching St. Petersburg in the final days before WWI and the collapse of the Romanov dynasty.\n\nRomanov Relations: Volume I\n\nCompiled and Edited by Paul Gilbert\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER PAPERBACK EDITION\n\nMore than a century after the fall of the monarchy in Russia, the world’s fascination with the Romanov dynasty endures, as a whole new generation of Romanovphile pursues their fascination with Russia’s most famous family.\n\nRomanov Relations is a multi-volume set of books, with each volume offering a collection of out-of-print articles, about the emperors, empresses, grand dukes and grand duchesses, as well as their descendants. Many of them dating back to the golden years of Imperial Russia have sat around collecting dust, mostly forgotten by time and neglected by researchers. Many of the authors, whom have long since passed from this world, personally knew their subjects and present them objectively to their reader in this volume. They offer both interesting anecdotes and insight into the private world of the Russian Imperial Court. Further, each volume is richly illustrated throughout, offering a selection of vintage photographs, many of which are drawn from Russian sources, and some of which may be new to readers.\n\nVolume One includes 70 photographs, and 5 articles, some of which are divided into numerous sub-chapters:\n\n(1) The Imperial Family of Russia by the Countess Marguerite Cunliffe-Owen\n\n(2) H.I.H. The Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna of Russia by the Countess Alexandra Olsoufieff\n\n(3) The Controversial Grand Duchess: An Intimate Biography of the Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, Senior by Christopher Heu\n\n(4) The Russian Imperial Family in Olden Times by Princess Catherine Radziwill\n\n(5) Flight from Russia by Louise Mountbatten, Queen of Sweden and includes Letters from the Russian Imperial Family. The letters written by the Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana to their cousin, Louise\n\nRomanov Relations will be enjoyed by readers who have an interest in the Romanovs and their legacy, as well as providing a useful reference to writers and historians as they continue to unravel the mysteries and dispel many of the popular held myths surrounding the Romanov dynasty.\n\nEmperor Nicholas II As I Knew Him\n\nby Sir John Hanbury Williams\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER PAPERBACK EDITION\n\nIn this compelling and intimate series of diary entries, originally published in 1922, Major-General Sir John Hanbury-Williams (1859-1946) depicts Tsar Nicholas II not as history knows him, but as he knew him.\n\nThe author claims that he probably saw the Tsar oftener and knew him more intimately than most others, outside his immediate entourage, during the period of his command in the field in 1916 to early 1917.\n\nFrom a great personal friend of the Emperor and one of the last people to have received any kind of correspondence from him, a fresh perspective on the character of the man behind the title is available.\n\nThis is a powerful recollection from Hanbury-Williams, who includes touching and poignant details from his own life in an historical and historic diary.\n\nSir John Hanbury-Williams (1859-1946) was the Military Secretary to the Secretary of State for War and Brigadier-General in charge of Administration. During the First World War, he was head of the British military mission with the Russian Stavka with direct access to Tsar Nicholas II.\n\nClick HERE to view 5 NEW Romanov titles published in September 2021\n\nClick HERE to view 4 NEW Romanov titles published in August 2021\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 31 October 2021\n\nPortrait of Tsarevich and Grand Duke Nicholas Alexandrovich (1889), the future Emperor Nicholas II, by the artist Baron Ernst Friedrich von Liphart (1847-1932), Russified as Ernst Karlovich Lipgart. Lipgart painted at least six portraits of Russia’s last monarch, including several ceremonial portraits.\n\nThis magnificent portrait is currently on display in the Twilight of the Gods II – Last Monarchs in the House of History of Bavaria exhibition, at the Museum of the House of Bavarian History in Regensburg, Bavaria until 16th January 2022.\n\nThe Emperor is depicted in the uniform of the Prussian 8th Hussar Regiment, of which he was appointed an Honourary Chief in 1889, his cape is decorated with the Royal Prussian Order of the Black Eagle.\n\nThe painting hung from 1890 to 1995 in the former dining room of Neuhaus Castle, directly opposite the portrait of Elector Clemens August of Bavaria. The officers of the 8th Hussar Regiment established a club for their meetings here and in the adjacent premises. The Prussian regiment was stationed at Neuhaus and Paderborn castle from 1851 to 1919. Following the end of World War I, the regiment was disbanded.\n\nAfter the exhibition ends in January of next year, the portrait will be returned to the Residenz Museum in Neuhaus Castle.\n\nPHOTO: Ernst Karlovich Lipgart (1847-1932). Self-portrait, 1881.\n\nFrom the Collection of the State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg\n\nErnst Karlovich Lipgart (1847-1932) was a Russian portraitist and decorator. He was born in Tartu, and after living for a time in Florence, where he studied at the Academy of Arts, he moved to France and then to Russia.\n\nHe arrived in St. Petersburg in 1886, where he painted portraits of members of the Imperial family, including a whole gallery of portraits of Nicholas II. He also decorated palaces and theatres in the capital, including the curtain in the Hermitage Theatre.\n\nLipgart also took on more unusual requests, including the menu for the Tsar’s coronation in 1896 and then painting 100 figures on a piano, telling the story of Orpheus. The piano was a present from the Tsar to Empress Alexandra Feodorovna.\n\nBetween 1906-1929 he served as the Main Curator of the Hermitage Art Gallery. His role in the acquisition of the Madonna with a Flower by Leonardo da Vinci, which belonged to the Benois family, became a sensation in 1914.\n\nIn 1921 he was evicted from his house and his daughter was executed for harbouring a White Army officer.\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 24 October 2021\n\n***\n\nCOLOUR Hard cover edition of ‘Nicholas II.

Upon leaving the cathedral, the honour guard formed a sabre arch for the newly married couple.\n\nFollowing the media publication of the wedding, journalists and social media users began to ask why military personnel were present at a private event.\n\nAccording to the press service of the Western Military District, a separate rifle company “provides the guard of honour for important events, such as the greeting and departure ceremonies of official state, government and military delegations, garrison and other events with the participation of troops in St. Petersburg and the North-West region of the country.”\n\nOther events, which the Guard of Honour are used: laying wreaths at the graves of soldiers who died in battle; rituals for paying military honours at the opening of monuments, memorials and funerals, and also participates in the military-patriotic education of young people and other socially significant events.\n\nCiting unnamed Defence Ministry sources, the state-run TASS and RIA Novosti news agencies reported that the ministry’s Western Military District had violated regulations by sending honour guard personnel to the Romanov’s wedding.\n\n“An official investigation established violations of governing documents by individual officials,” one of the sources was quoted as saying.\n\nPHOTO: Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu\n\nThe reports did not indicate what type of disciplinary action was brought against the Western Military District or who exactly was targeted. The district itself did not comment on the reprimand.\n\nThe so-called “Russian Imperial House” wasted little time in damage control, stressing that the honour guard’s participation was legally sanctioned.\n\n“The wedding organizers agreed with every authority — state, church, military — in accordance with the procedure established by law,” said Maria Vladimirovna’s senior mouthpiece Alexander Zakatov, who serves as director of Maria’s “chancellery” in Moscow. This, however, is not true:\n\n“On behalf of the Russian Defence Minister, disciplinary action has been taken against responsible persons, for violation of regulations and statutory documents governing the appointment of the guard of honour,” another source added.\n\n“I have no doubt that those responsible will be held accountable. The commandant subdivision of the Russian Armed Forces is not a firm or a company catering to wedding banquets or other functions for individuals.\n\n“Thank God that Russia’s Minister of Defence, Hero of Russia Sergei Shoigu is a man of honour and duty, one who teaches his subordinates to protect the honour of a serviceman and the honour of his uniform, and not to participate in a funny show of these impostors!”\n\nPHOTO: Lyudmila Narusova (left), chatting on her mobile in St. Isaac’s Cathedral\n\nThe Kremlin played down the significance of the Romanov wedding. No Russian government officials were reported among the 1,500 guests at the St. Isaac’s Cathedral ceremony, with the exception of Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova and senator Lyudmila Narusova, the widow of St. Petersburg’s ex-Mayor Anatoly Sobchak – who was photographed showing the utmost disrespect by talking on her mobile during the wedding ceremony in St. Isaac’s Cathedral.\n\n11 October 2021\n\nPHOTO: Paul Gilbert in the old ‘Royal Russia Bookshop’. Please note that the books depicted in this photo are no longer available from my online bookshop – PG\n\nAt the end of 2020, after 26 years, I closed my publishing business. Aside from my Nicholas II. Emperor. Tsar. Saint. 2022 Calendar, I have not published any new titles and ceased publication of my periodicals Royal Russia and Sovereign, during the past year.\n\nThis may be your last chance to additional titles to your personal Romanov collections!\n\nOn 27th October of this year, I will mark my 65th birthday, at which time I will permanently retire from bookselling. It is with mixed feelings, that after more than a quarter century of publishing and selling books on the Romanovs, my main online bookshop Paul Gilbert Publisher [for many years known as the Royal Russia Bookshop] will permanently close on 31st December 2021.\n\nI will, however, continue to offer books on my other online bookshop Paul Gilbert Bookseller, which offers new, rare and second-hand titles, in addition to other topics.\n\nAt some point within the next few years, I will be moving back to England, where I will take up permanent residence in Northumberland.\n\nAs a result, I am forced to sell off the bulk of my personal library, which consists of several thousand titles on Imperial Russian history, the Romanovs, European and British royalty. In addition are richly illustrated pictorials, books on history, art, architecture, biographies among many other topics.\n\nGiven the sheer number of books that I still own, it will take me two to three years to scan and list each book. It is a very time consuming task, however, I am now committed to adding up to 50 additional titles to my online catalogue each month.\n\nIf you would like to receive updates when my online shop has been updated, please send me an email – royalrussia@yahoo.com – with a request to be added to my mailing list.\n\nNew publishing venture on AMAZON\n\nI am pleased to announce that I will continue to research and write books on the life and reign of Emperor Nicholas II [among others], all of which will be published in both paperback and eBook editions, and sold worldwide from AMAZON.\n\nClick HERE to review 4 NEW publishing projects, which I am currently working on\n\nIn August of this year, I started to reissue reprints of other books on the Romanovs, which have been out of print for many years, and unavailable to a new generation of Romanovphiles! Below, are links to titles, currently available on AMAZON – with many others planned.\n\nClick HERE to review 4 NEW Romanov Titles added on 31st August 2021\n\nClick HERE to review 5 NEW Romanov Titles added on 16th September 2021\n\n© Paul Gilbert. 7 October 2021\n\nOn 1st October, the wedding of George Mikhailovich Romanov [a Spanish citizen] to his fiancé Rebecca Bettarini [a citizen of Italy] was held in St. Isaac’s Cathedral in St. Petersburg.\n\nMore than 1,500 guests crammed the historic cathedral. Guests refused to wear protective masks or practice social distancing, despite the record number of daily COVID-19 cases and deaths in Russia[1].\n\nThe Russian and some Western media outlets hailed the event as both the Romanov “wedding of the century” and the “first Romanov to marry in Russia”, since the fall of the Romanov dynasty in 1917. Neither are correct.\n\nPHOTOS: guests crammed the historic cathedral, defying protection from COVID\n\nPHOTOS: guests crammed the historic cathedral, defying protection from COVID\n\nFor the record . . .\n\nGeorge Mikhailovich is “NOT” the first Romanov to marry in Russia since 1917, despite what the misinformed media are reporting! In fact, a total of six Romanov weddings have been held in Russia since 1917. It is interesting to note that the so-called “Russian Imperial House” headed by George’s mother Princess Maria Vladimirovna, has made no effort to correct this faux pas!\n\nBetween 1917 and 1920, five marriages among the members of the Russian Imperial House were concluded in Russia:\n\nOn 22nd April 1917, Prince Gabriel Konstantinovich (1887-1955) married Antonina Rafailovna Nesterovskaya (1890-1950) in Petrograd.\n\nOn the same day Prince Alexander Georgievich Romanovsky, Duke of Leichtenberg (1881-1942) married Nadezhda Nikolaevna Karelli (1883-1964) in Petrograd.\n\nOn 25th April 1917, Princess Nadezhda Petrovna (1898-1988) married Prince Nikolai Orlov (1891-1961).\n\nOn 18th July 1917, Princess Elena Georgievna Romanovskaya, Duchess of Leichtenberg (1892-1971) married Count Stefan Tyshkevich (1894-1976) in Yalta, Crimea.\n\nOn 25th November 1918, Prince Andrey Alexandrovich (1897-1981) married Duchess Elizabeth Sasso-Ruffo (1887-1940), in Ai-Todor, Crimea.\n\nAfter being widowed in 1989, Prince Dimitri Romanovich (1926-2016) married Dorrit Reventlow (born 1942) in Kostroma on 28 July 1993. His second marriage was the “FIRST” time a Romanov had been married in Russia in more than a century.\n\nThrough his paternal lineage, Prince Dimitri was a great-great grandson of Emperor Nicholas I (1796–1855), who founded the Nikolaevich branch of the Russian Imperial Family. At his death on 31 December 2016, the male line of the Nicholaevich branch of the Romanov family died out.\n\nAn unimpressive guest list\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the wedding, Maria Vladimirovna’s public relations team issued press releases, detailing an impressive list of royals and dignitaries who would attend her son’s nuptials, in reality, however, none of them attended.\n\nProminent on the guest list was Queen Sofia of Spain, who was present at George’s christening, but she failed to attend. None of the many Romanov descendants scattered around the world were even invited, as Maria and her son, both look down their noses at them.\n\nThe guest list was unimpressive to say the very least, which included a few petty Russian politicians, although the Chairman of the Communist Party Gennady Zyuganov sent the couple a congratulation!\n\nThere were no reigning kings or queens of the European royal houses or ambassadors to represent them. The only “royals” in attendance, were a few princes and princesses and members of numerous, now defunct European royal houses.\n\nIn addition, the groom’s father Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia was notably “absent”. The wedding was also attended by Maria Vladimirovna’s half sister Helen Louise Kirby [born 1935], whose attendance, according to the Russian media, marked Helen Kirby’s first public appearance in 10 years.\n\nKirby is the daughter of Leonida Georgievna Bagration (1914-2010) and her first husband Sumner Moore Kirby (1895–1945), a wealthy American businessman, and one of the heirs to the F.W. Woolworth fortune.\n\nMaria Vladimirovna is the daughter of Leonida Georgievna Bagration (1914-2010) and her second husband Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov (1917-1992). It is through her mother’s marriage to Kirby, that Maria enjoys a lavish lifestyle to this day, with homes in Madrid and Paris.\n\nDespite the hoopla, those who gathered outside the cathedral were few and far between, many were there, simply out of curiosity.\n\nIt should also be noted, that no live broadcast of the wedding was conducted on any federal or regional TV channel in Russia. So much for the “Romanov wedding of the century!”\n\nKudos to Russian president Vladimir Putin\n\nThe Interfax News Agency reported that while Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had been invited to the wedding of George Mikhailovich to Victoria Bettarini in St. Petersburg, would not be attending.\n\nPutin also stated that he would not be congratulating the newlyweds either, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in response to the relevant question on Friday.\n\n“No, the president is not planning to congratulate the newlyweds in any way. Once again, this wedding has absolutely nothing to do with our agenda,” Peskov said.\n\nThis is a clear indication that Putin does NOT recognize the current descendants – Maria Vladimirovna and her son George Mikhailovich, as anything more than Russian citizens.\n\nIn addition, the Interfax News Agency does not identify Maria and George by their self-adopted and false titles, “Grand Duchess” or “Grand Duke”.\n\nWhy is this article relevant?\n\nI am dedicated to clearing the name of Russia’s much slandered Tsar. This includes identifying those who broke their personal oath to Nicholas II, including George Mikhailovich’s great-grandfather Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich (1876-1938), a member of the Russian Imperial Family, who not only lacked a moral compass, but openly defied his Sovereign, culminating in committing treason against Him in 1917.\n\nUnder no pretext can we admit to the throne those whose ancestors belonged to parties involved in the 1917 revolution in one way or another. Nor can we admit those whose ancestors betrayed Tsar Nicholas II. Nor can we ignore those who ancestors openly supported the Nazis. Thus, without any reservations, the right to the succession to the throne of the Kirillovich branch should be excluded.\n\nAny one who supports this branch of the family, dishonours the memory of the Holy Tsar-Martyr Nicholas II.\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] Russia has confirmed 7,612,317 cases of coronavirus and 210,801 deaths, according to the national coronavirus information center.
