In 1882 he was appointed commander of the 1st Battalion of the Preobrazhensky Life Guards Regiment.\n\nSoon after his return to St. Petersburg Sergey Alexandrovich assumed the duties of the chairman of the Imperial Orthodox Palestine Society, which collected, developed and spread information throughout Russia about the holy places in the Orient, and provided assistance to Russian pilgrims. The Grand Duke initiated and funded excavations in Jerusalem, at the site of which there was built a church in the name of the Holy Prince Alexander Nevsky, in memory of the Tsar-Liberator Alexander II.\n\nSergey Aleksandrovich was the honorary chairman of numerous Moscow Society charities: education and training of blind children, the Society for patronage of homeless and released from juvenile detention, the Moscow department of the Russian society for protection of public health; a patron of Almshouses of Crown Prince Nicholas, the Moscow Society of the mutual promotion of handicraft, Auxiliary cash printers, the Charitable society for older artists; the patron of all parish schools of the Moscow diocese, shelter of Sergievsky community in St. Petersburg, Pskov real school; president of the Society care about the children of persons exiled by judicial sentence to Siberia and other public organizations.

In December 1894 he became a member of the State Council, and after a year and a half - the commander of the Moscow Military District. During his tenure as governor-general the Grand Duke took an active part in the beautification of the capital. Sergey Aleksandrovich supported pro-government labour organizations and took a firm stand against the rebels and revolutionaries, believing that it was necessary to take tougher action against terrorists. The Government had not supported the Grand Duke and in January 1905 he voluntarily relinquished the post of governor-general.\n\nOn 17 February (O.S. 4 February) 1905, at about 3 p. m., Sergey Alexandrovich was assassinated by a bomb, thrown by terrorist Ivan Kalyaev."
