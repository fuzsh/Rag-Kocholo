        "text": "From mid-March 2003:\n\nVery curious, I decided to see what I could come up with\n\nconcerning the marriage of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich\n\nand Princess Elisabeth (\"Ella\") of Hesse and by Rhein, from\n\nthe (admittedly limited and not overly impressive ;) resources\n\nat hand.\n\nDespite having had a crush on the young and dashing\n\nAlexander II (when he had visited England when she was\n\nnewly Queen) Queen Victoria was neither a fan of the\n\nRomanovs (whom she found to be wild and decadent)\n\nthe Russian Court (ditto ;) nor Russia (which she thought\n\nto be backward and barbaric, and certainly no place for\n\ntenderly-raised princesses.) I cannot think of any marriage\n\nconcerning the Romanovs which she embraced with\n\nenthusiasm; rather, she accepted the inevitable when the\n\noccasion demanded it, such as her finding something\n\n\"good\" in the imperious Grand Duchess soon to be\n\nher daughter-in-law (Marie Alexandrovna.) As it turned\n\nout, Victoria was faced with the addition of three closely-\n\nrelated Romanovs (a sister, a brother and nephew)\n\nwho would marry her son and two of her granddaughters\n\nwithin a space of twenty years.\n\nIn 1841, the sixteen year old Princess Maximiliane\n\nWilhelmine Auguste Sophie Marie of Hesse and by Rhein\n\nembraced Russian Orthodoxy and thus became \"the truly\n\nbelieving Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna.\" On\n\n16 April 1841, she married the Tsarevich Alexander\n\nNicholevich. From what I have read, the marriage had\n\nbeen a happy one, producing eight children, until,\n\nsuddenly, it appeared, Alexander, by then Tsar Alexander\n\nII, took a mistress. Not only did he take a mistress,\n\nEkaterina Michielovna Dolgorukaya, but he casually\n\ninstalled her in the Palace, beneath his wife's very nose,\n\nwhere the Tsarina could hardly fail to notice the presence\n\nof her husband's ambitious paramour.\n\nWhereas once the Tsar had spent what free time he had\n\nwith his wife and children, enjoying their company, now\n\nhe spent it with Ekaterina and the children they began\n\nto produce together. The Tsarina, who had suffered from\n\na myriad of health woes, was increasingly wracked with\n\n(quite understandable!) bouts of depression, and fled to\n\nthe comfort of her family in Hesse. These visits, and the\n\nreasons for them, were the subject of concerned\n\nconversation in the various Courts of Germany and\n\nEngland. By this time, Queen Victoria's daughter Alice\n\nwas living in Hesse and was the wife of the Tsarina's\n\nnephew, Ludwig (Louis, the future Grand Duke of\n\nHesse.) Thus Victoria received inside information about\n\nthe visits of the unhappy \"Aunt Marie.\"\n\nAmongst the children of the Tsar and Tsarina, only their\n\nsole daughter, the Grand Duchess Marie Alexandrovna\n\nwas able to maintain the terrible balancing act of\n\nremaining on good terms with both of her increasingly\n\nestranged parents. Much as the Grand Duchess loathed\n\nand was even outraged by her father's behaviour, she\n\nstill loved him, as she did her mother, who sank into\n\nmelancholia, neurasthenia, and other health woes, both\n\nreal and imagined. Much more partisan were the\n\nyoungest two sons, Grand Dukes Sergei and Paul, who\n\nbecame their mother's travelling companions as she\n\nsought solace away from the Russian Court, and even\n\nher own homes, which, it was felt, were increasingly\n\ntaken over (certainly in the emotional sense) by her\n\nrival.\n\nThe children of the Tsarina and Princess Alice had met\n\nbefore, and the Hessian children were not particularly\n\nimpressed. Princess Alice was raising her children very\n\nmuch in the \"English mode,\" with the ideals of her mother\n\nthe Queen of England, which, in the eyes of the conservative,\n\ntradition-bound and etiquette-smothered German and\n\nRussian Courts was considered very liberal. Liberalism,\n\neven in the relative sense, was innately distrusted. The\n\nstiff young Russians, suspicious of this more relaxed\n\natmosphere, found their Hessian cousins somewhat odd\n\nin this way.\n\nEven when very young, Princess Elisabeth, the second\n\ndaughter of Prince Ludwig and Princess Alice, was\n\nbecoming noticed for her loveliness and grace. But even\n\nthough \"Ella\" was considered the family beauty, no sparks\n\nflew between her Russian cousins and her.\n\nThis changed in September 1879, at least for Sergei,\n\nwhen, on yet another trip to Hesse, he suddenly seemed to\n\nsee his cousin Ella with new eyes. The Princess was not\n\nyet fifteen, but the twenty-two Sergei suddenly noticed\n\nshe was no longer a little girl. It does not appear that,\n\neven given Sergei's new appraisal, that Ella made any\n\nnew appraisals of her own. Even by this time, Sergei\n\nhad a reputation for being cold, unapproachable and\n\ndistant; hardly a likely candidate to inspire romantic\n\nideas in a young girl. Also distracting Ella was the death\n\nof her mother, the December before. Though devoted to\n\nmany causes, the Grand Duchess Alice had been the\n\nlinchpin and central figure of the Hessian Grand Ducal\n\nfamily; Life has revolved around her and all had turned\n\nto her. Though Queen Victoria did as much as she could\n\nto oversee her grandchildren from England (and encourage\n\nthem to visit as often as possible) and Ella's eldest sister\n\nfilled in as much as she could, there was an enormous\n\nsense of loss.\n\nThe Tsarina's health continued to deteriorate, and by\n\nthe Spring of 1880, she was confined to her rooms in the\n\nWinter Palace. Most cruelly, the children of her\n\nhusband and his mistress, could be heard in their\n\nplayrooms directly above the dying Tsarina's suite. It\n\nwas a constant and painful reminder of what her marriage\n\nhad become and how her husband had not only made\n\nanother Life, but went merrily along without her as if she\n\nwere already dead. Still, Grand Duchess Marie\n\nAlexandrovna strove to keep some sense of normalcy\n\nin this decidedly odd (and fraught with tension, spoken\n\nand unspoken) domestic arrangement, as well as\n\nentertain and comfort her mother.\n\nEven at this time, though partisan, as I wrote, to the\n\nmother he adored, Sergei still worshipped his father and\n\nbelieved that the Tsar was inviolate and worthy of\n\nrespect, both as his father and the monarch. From what\n\nI have read, though, he did not \"travel\" as easily between\n\nthe two \"camps\" as his elder sister. The sight of his\n\nmother, in her misery and illness, compared to his father's\n\nhappiness with his mistress and \"other family,\" even in\n\nsuch close quarters, even with the knowledge of the\n\nTsarina's situation, was too much for him.\n\nAdding to the tension in the Household, an attempt\n\nwas made on the Tsar's Life: a bomb had been smuggled\n\ninto the Palace itself. As it happened, the explosion hurt\n\nno one, but it was a reminder of what *could* happen\n\n(and, in the end, what *would* happen.)\n\nOn 3 June 1880, the Tsarina Maria Alexandrovna died\n\nat the age of fifty-six, after thirty-nine years of marriage.\n\nAs it happened, the Tsarina died alone, with no one at\n\nher bedside. It was a final tragic note to a Life that had\n\nso long been unhappy. Mercifully, the Tsarina died in\n\nher sleep.\n\nIn a move that deeply shocked and outraged his children,\n\nless than a month passed when the technically-bereaved\n\nTsar revealed the depth of his lack of feeling, not only\n\nfor his recently dead wife, who had loved him, but for\n\nhis grieving children, by marrying his mistress at the\n\nTsarskoe Selo. A mere thirty-three days since the Tsarina\n\ndied in Moscow. Full Court mourning had not even yet\n\nceased for the dead Tsarina. In all fairness, it must be\n\nmentioned that two of the Grand Dukes, while\n\nacknowledging the haste, were not as deeply offended\n\nin comparison to the others.\n\nIt's still fair to say, however, that, overall, the children\n\nwere incensed; their mother was barely cold, and\n\nthough all knew of their father's relationship with\n\nEkaterina Dolgorukaya, none truly expected that he\n\nwould do something so outrageous as attempt to put\n\nher in their mother's place, much less in an official\n\ncapacity. Despite her princely antecedents, there was\n\nno way to stretch the requirements making Ekaterina a\n\nfit consort for a Russian Tsar, and in the end, her ambitions\n\nhad to be denied; the Tsar gave her the title of \"Princess\n\nYurievskaya\" on 5 December of the same year.\n\nThe happiness of the Tsar and his new wife was not to\n\nlast. Ekaterina was terrified about what might befall her,\n\nin the largely hostile Court, should Alexander die before\n\nher, and given the increase in terrorist activities, it was\n\na distinct possibility. Though revered by some as the\n\n\"Tsar-Liberator\" (for his abolition of serfdom in 1861)\n\nAlexander had also gained enemies, both of those who\n\nhad opposed his sweeping reforms, as well as those\n\nwho believed he had not done enough.\n\nEkaterina's fears were realized when, on 13 March 1881,\n\na series of attempts where made on the Tsar's Life. The\n\nsecond in which a bomb was thrown directly beneath\n\nhis feet. The mortally-wounded Tsar was transported\n\nto the Winter Palace, where he died in agony in the\n\npresence of his hastily-summoned family, including his\n\nsuccessor, Alexander III. The Church of \"Our Saviour on\n\nthe Spilled Blood\" was later erected on the site.\n\nNone of his children present either forgot the sight of their\n\nhideously wounded father nor forgave his murder. Especially\n\nvehement was the new Tsar, Alexander III, who saw his\n\nfather's murder as how \"the people\" had \"repaid\" a\n\nmonarch generous with reform. Thus, the reactionary\n\nbacklash was extreme.\n\nThe Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich was not in Moscow\n\nat the time of his father's murder, and thus missed witnessing\n\nthe terrible events. However, he was in complete agreement\n\nwith his eldest brother on the matter. A Tsar must be ruthless,\n\nfirm and strict: Russia demanded no less, and to be otherwise\n\ninvited the very events of 13 March 1881. Though he had\n\nalways been of an anti-liberal bent, his father's assassination\n\nconceived a murderous hatred of revolutionaries, reform\n\nand liberal ideals.\n\nIt was this hardened man who returned to Hesse in 1882,\n\nbut that was not what Ella saw. Intensely sympathetic,\n\nthe now seventeen year old Princess saw a man devastated\n\nby the deaths of his parents, alone and in need of nurturing.\n\nShe empathized with his grief over his mother's loss; the\n\nGrand Ducal family of Hesse still felt the death of Ella's\n\nmother four years previously keenly. Sergei was well-\n\ntraveled, cultured and urbane. Also appealing to Ella,\n\nwho had inherited her mother's restless, questioning nature\n\nand religious interests, was Sergei's piety and satisfaction\n\nin his Russian Orthodoxy.\n\nBy 1883, Ella was penning letters to her adoring Grandmama\n\nin England, who had been worriedly keeping abreast of\n\nthe developments between Sergei and Ella, kept advised by\n\nElla's eldest sister, Victoria. It was a courtship fraught with\n\nElla's indecision - one moment she was certain, the next\n\nshe was not. She was well aware not only of her family's\n\ntrepidation about the match, and Queen Victoria's disapproval\n\nof the Romanovs and Russia in general, but also had her\n\nown fears. She tried to sort out what was a genuine fear and\n\nwhat was based on simply what she had heard and the\n\nfeelings of her family. Queen Victoria was especially concerned\n\nabout Sergei's reputation and his stringent views on \"the way\n\nthings should be\" (in his opinion.) Ella wrote her grandmother,\n\nrevealing what perhaps might have been one of her driving\n\nmotivations in accepting Sergei's suit, \"We both have that great\n\nsorrow of losing one we love so dearly that it draws us closer\n\ntogether and we feel for each other more...\" and even more\n\nrevealingly, \"Do you not think, dear Grandmama, that I\n\nmight do him good?\"\n\nBy the New Year of 1884, Ella had decided, and on 26\n\nFebruary 1884, the engagement of Grand Duke Sergei\n\nAlexandrovich Romanov and Princess Elisabeth Alexandra\n\nLouise Alice of Hesse and by Rhein was officially announced\n\nin the presence of the former's eldest brother, Tsar Alexander\n\nIII and his wife, the Tsarina Marie Fyodorovna. In honour\n\nof the occasion, Sergei gave Ella the deeply symbolic gifts\n\nof a jeweled bracelet and a shawl, both of which had belonged\n\nto his late mother. The Tsar gave her the Order of Saint\n\nCatherine as well as a brooch of sapphires and diamonds.\n\nAs she would with all the members of her family, once\n\npresented with a romantic fait accompli, Queen Victoria,\n\nwhom, for all her shortcomings, was a romantic herself and\n\nalways wished the best for those she loved, \"came around.\"\n\nWhen told of Ella's engagement, Victoria immediately\n\ndispatched a loving letter assuring Ella of her good will and\n\nblessing. (It must be said, however, that Queen Victoria\n\n\"came around\" when a match was suitable, as Gentle\n\nReaders will soon see, the good Queen was not such a\n\nhopeless romantic as to countenance a mésalliance, especially\n\nif she suspected social motivations... ;)\n\nBut there was still more romantic drama in store for the\n\nHessians. On 30 April 1884, Hesse was packed with Royal\n\nrelations for the wedding of Princess Victoria to Prince\n\nLouis of Battenberg. The Prussians were a bit out of sorts -\n\nthey considered the Battenberg marriage a mésalliance at\n\nbest, for the Battenbergs were tainted through the morganatic\n\nmarriage of the groom's parents; his mother was merely\n\na lowly Countess, most shocking to the rank-conscious\n\nHohenzollerns. The bride's aunt Vicky, married to the\n\nHohenzollern heir, had pleaded to be allowed to attend.\n\n(Queen Victoria was *quite* put out by the Prussians'\n\nstance on this point, making it clear that she, as Queen of\n\nEngland, was planning to attend, and that should be\n\nvalidation enough of the worthiness of the match for\n\n*anyone*.)\n\nUnbeknownst to anyone, the bride's father also had marriage\n\non his mind, and after attending the services of his daughter\n\nand her groom, but before the bridal meal, he adjourned\n\nto his rooms in the Grand Ducal Palace and secretly\n\nmarried his mistress, Countess Alexandrine von Hutten-\n\nCzapska, an ambitious Russian woman already twice\n\ndivorced. The revelation of this fait accompli ignited a\n\nstorm which very nearly ruined the Hesse-Battenberg\n\nwedding. Livid, Queen Victoria summoned her son-in-law,\n\nwhom she liked, to her rooms, gave him a furious dressing-\n\ndown and demanded he have the marriage annulled, post-\n\nhaste. Alexandrine, Victoria was under no illusions, was\n\na scandalous adventuress with two living husbands and was\n\nin *no* way a fit successor to her beloved daughter, Alice.\n\nShocked, Royalties began to decamp from Hesse en masse.\n\nThe furious Kaiser ordered Vicky and Fritz home, as if\n\nyet another morganatic marriage was contagious. Tears\n\nand outrage abounded, and Ludwig at first tried to hold\n\nout against the furious Queen of England and her equally\n\noffended family. As much as many members of the\n\nEnglish Royal Family (Queen Victoria reluctantly included)\n\ncould perhaps understand Ludwig's loneliness and need\n\nfor companionship, none would countenance the idea of\n\nhim remarrying, especially to such a woman (Queen\n\nVictoria hoped to arrange a marriage between Ludwig\n\nand her youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice, an idea\n\nfor which neither showed the slightest interest or\n\nenthusiasm.)\n\nFor her part, Alexandrine proved herself venial and\n\nimmediately tried to blackmail her new husband. The\n\nmatter was solved with a financial payoff (financed,\n\nat least in part, by Queen Victoria, who regretted the\n\nloss of money on such a matter but was eager to see\n\nit definitively resolved) and the creation of the wannabe\n\nGrand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhein as Countess\n\nRomrod. The marriage was annulled on 9 July 1884,\n\nand the erring (and depressed) Ludwig was returned\n\nto Queen Victoria's graces. He went to England after\n\nthe annulment, where the Queen could keep a closer\n\neye on him, and spent his days hunting and bemoaning\n\nhis lost love (though she had not exactly proved herself\n\nfaithful during the crisis.)\n\nI believe Ella may have been along on this trip, which\n\nalso settled her sister in her new home in England. She\n\nvisited the Queen at Windsor, where \"darling Grandmama\"\n\nwas filled with \"plenty [of] advices and warnings about\n\nmarried life in Russia\".\n\nThere was no question that a Russian Grand Duke, brother\n\nof the Tsar, would marry in provincial Hesse, especially\n\nafter such a fiasco. So, Ella departed for her new Life\n\nin Russia, where she was married in a dazzling ceremony\n\nfilled with Romanov tradition on 14 June 1884 in St\n\nPetersburg.\n\nElla was prepared for her \"big day\" at the Winter Palace\n\nin St. Petersburg. Like all Grand Duchesses, her hair\n\nwas arranged and she was dressed before the famous\n\ngold mirror of the Empress Anna Ioannovna (1693 -\n\n1740) daughter of Tsar Ivan V Alexeiovich. The hairstyle\n\nitself was another \"traditional\" one, with two long \"sausage\n\ncurls\" framing her face.\n\nFor her bridal gown, Ella wore a heavy Russian Court\n\ndress of real silver tissue, with an immensely long train\n\nedged with ermine. She also adorned with the spectacular\n\ngems which had belonged to Catherine the Great, including\n\na diadem with a brilliant pink diamond and a necklace of\n\nlarge diamonds. From her ears dangled heavy, cherry-\n\nshaped earrings. Interesting, for a future saint and martyr,\n\nElla also wore a crimson crown adorned with a large\n\ncross, all encrusted with diamonds on top of her long,\n\nlace veil.\n\nThe preparation was sadly lacking in the presence of\n\nhappy, excited mothers: both the mother of the bride\n\nand the mother of the groom were dead, loved ones\n\nwhose absence was felt keenly by the nuptial pair.\n\nAfter the long and intricate ceremony, in which Ella\n\npromised to \"love, honour and obey\" her husband, the\n\nnewlyweds departed for the estate that would become\n\nsynonymous with them: Illinskoe, just ten miles from\n\nMoscow. Sergei loved the estate which he had inherited\n\nfrom his late mother. It was there that Ella would play\n\nhostess to her youngest surviving sister, Princess Alix,\n\non her visits to Russia, and where Sergei's nephew\n\nNicholas would long to be, after developing a deep crush\n\non the shy, serious Hessian princess.\n\nAnd what happened on that honeymoon? I have seen\n\nno documentation that provides any details. Certainly,\n\nElla, at nineteen, expected *something* to happen. The\n\ngroom has celebrated his twenty-seventh birthday the\n\nmonth before and was healthy, and ostensibly, as \"manly\"\n\nas any other member of his large family. Certainly, by\n\nhis age, most Romanov males were not only most\n\ncertainly *not* virginal, but were likely to have\n\naccumulated at least one mistress; some would have\n\nsired illegitimate children.\n\nIf Ella had any questions, she had a dearth of female\n\nconfidantes available on hand. Both her mother and\n\nmother-in-law were dead. Her younger sisters were\n\nunmarried and soon back in Hesse at any rate. Alix\n\nhad only just passed her twelfth birthday (Ella's wedding\n\nhad made an enormous impact on the impressionable\n\nyoung Alix, who soaked up the almost magical environment\n\nlike a sponge and noticed the attentions of the sixteen year\n\nold Tsarevich, who later admitted in his diary to having\n\nbeen struck by the serious and pretty \"Alix H.\") and was\n\ncertainly too young for such confidences. Ella's\n\nremaining sister, Iréne, was nearly eighteen, but unmarried,\n\nherself, and would therefore have no practical advice to give,\n\nhowever much she might be able to listen sympathetically.\n\nSergei's only sister, the brusque and practical Marie\n\nAlexandrovna, had been unable to attend the wedding,\n\nhaving delivered what would be her youngest child,\n\nPrincess Beatrice, in England, only two months before.\n\nBesides, Marie Alexandrovna would have been an\n\neffective stranger to Ella, and not a likely candidate\n\nto approach on such a sensitive topic, especially given\n\nshe was the *groom's* sister.\n\nA far better - and more likely - candidate would have\n\nbeen Ella's eldest sister, the new Princess Victoria of\n\nBattenberg. Twenty-one at the time and a newlywed\n\nherself, Victoria was intelligent, calm, sensible, devoted,\n\nintensely loyal and above all, discreet. But even given\n\nall that, would Ella have approached her sister? Such\n\nwas Victoria's personality that, if Ella did, we will never\n\nknow, for Victoria would have never broached such a\n\nconfidence. From accounts I have read, Princess\n\nVictoria was not overly impressed with Sergei, and had\n\nshared the same trepidations as Queen Victoria (with\n\nwhom she corresponded regularly) over Ella and her\n\nmarriage plans.\n\nIt appears that, sometime during the honeymoon, Ella\n\ndid come to realization that her marriage would be\n\n\"different,\" and that Sergei did not have interest in her\n\nphysically or intimately. True to her nature, and the\n\npromises she had made at the altar, Ella honoured all\n\nthat had brought her to Russia and made every\n\nappearance of devotion to her new husband. But,\n\nhélas, her hopes of \"doing him good,\" as she had so\n\noptimistically written her Grandmother, were not to\n\ntake the form of \"changing\" Sergei, but rather to achieve\n\nharmony by seeking always to please him.\n\nAs I alluded in another post, Sergei may have had a\n\nPygmalion-esque view of Ella: he would mould her,\n\nas Pygmalion fashioned Galatea, into what he wanted,\n\nand for Sergei, it appears this took the form of dressing\n\nher, choosing her jewels, even her reading material.\n\nTolstoi (especially \"Anna Karenina\") was out, as was\n\nanything of a romantic nature (a waste of time, and\n\nmore likely than not would encourage unhealthy\n\npassions and interests.) Sergei worked on Ella's French\n\nand Russian, and approved her religious and devotional\n\ntexts. Luckily, Ella, like her late mother, had a deep\n\ninterest in the mystical and the religious.\n\nAfter their honeymoon, Ella and Sergei settled into\n\ntheir official \"in town\" residence, Sergievskaya Palace,\n\nin St Petersburg. Russian society was far more\n\nsophisticated than provincial, sleepy Hesse, and\n\nit was quite a change, on many levels, for Ella.\n\nGamely, she set about making the adjustment,\n\nimpressing all as a charming hostess. Initially ignorant\n\nof Russian, Ella set her mind to learning it. Luckily,\n\nFrench was the langue de choix of the Russian\n\nCourt, though Ella's French was not quite \"up to\n\nsnuff,\" either, though she set to remedying that as\n\nwell.\n\nUnfortunately, for all of Ella's efforts to please (and\n\nthe praise she received from others) Sergei criticized\n\nand belittled his wife, often in front of others. He made\n\nfun of Ella, her tastes, efforts, intellect and errors, as\n\nwell of Ella's serious pursuits, even her religious\n\ninterest and devotions (though, perversely, he prided\n\nhimself on his own religiosity.) Naturally, Ella was\n\ntremendously embarrassed and hurt, and resented such\n\ntreatment, but further impressed others by refusing to\n\ncomplain about her husband, who was only furthering\n\nhis own reputation as a bully, as well as giving more\n\ncause to make people wonder why such a charming\n\nwoman as Ella would have accepted the proposal of\n\nsuch an oppressive creative.\n\nThere was interest, of course, as to whether the Grand\n\nDucal couple would soon begin producing children.\n\nA mere ten months after her 30 April 1884 wedding,\n\nElla's sister Victoria welcomed her first child, Princess\n\nAlice (the future mother of the Duke of Edinburgh;\n\nPrincess Alice would also be fascinated by her \"Aunt\n\nElla\" and seek to emulate her in many ways.) All\n\nof Sergei's married siblings had quickly produced\n\nchildren, usually within their first year of marriage,\n\naside from the 18 months between the wedding of\n\nSasha - Tsar Alexander III - and his wife \"Minnie\"\n\nand the birth of the future Nicholas II.\n\nThe Romanovs also had young children and even\n\na new baby, when Ella and Sergei married. The\n\nyoungest daughters of Sasha and Minnie (Grand\n\nDuchess Olga Alexandrovna) and Grand Duke\n\nVladimir Alexandrovich and his wife, \"Miechen,\"\n\n(Grand Duchess Helena Vladimirovna) were\n\nboth two years old when Ella joined the Imperial\n\nFamily, and her sister-in-law, Marie Alexandrovna,\n\nmarried to Ella's \"Uncle Affie\" in England, had\n\ngiven birth to her last daughter (Princess Beatrice)\n\nonly a few months previously.\n\nGiven the fertility on both sides of the family, it was\n\nnot considered untoward that Sergei and Ella would\n\nenjoy the same success.\n\nAnd yet, the months passed, and there was no\n\nannouncement from the Grand Ducal couple, and\n\nperhaps more significantly, there appears to have been\n\nlittle to no conversation as to why there wasn't.\n\nLike the English Royal Family, the Romanovs were\n\na chatty bunch who exchanged a veritable forest\n\nof letters, all filled with family news and gossip. Yet\n\nI cannot recall much information of an intimate nature\n\nabout Ella and Sergei. This is not to say that Sergei\n\nand Ella did not make their appearances in the\n\nletters, diary entries and other correspondence of\n\nthe Romanovs, for they did. However, unlike other\n\npeople, Ella and Sergei emerge more in the way of\n\n\"everyday\" activities; appearances at various functions\n\nand family events, their homes and the various concerns\n\nof those establishments, and, of course, Ella's growing\n\nand spectacular wardrobe and adornments.\n\nSweet-natured and eager to please, Ella soon settled\n\ninto her new family, who gave every appearance of\n\nembracing and welcoming her into the family.\n\nConversion to Russian Orthodoxy was only\n\nabsolutely mandatory for a woman who might bear\n\na future Tsar. Since it was unlikely that a son of Ella\n\nand Sergei would be called upon to assume the Throne\n\n(by 1884, Tsar Alexander III had four sons, as did\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir, and Grand Duke Alexis had\n\nmarried morganatically; and all came before Sergei in\n\nthe Succession) there was no especial pressure put\n\nupon Ella to convert.\n\nElla had been baptized and confirmed a Lutheran\n\n(\"Evangelisch\") and her grand Russian Orthodox\n\nwedding had been followed by a Lutheran service, in\n\naccordance with her own beliefs and at the insistence\n\nof her father. One of Ludwig of Hesse's primary\n\nconcerns, when the subject was the marriages of his\n\ndaughters, was that they retain their religion. This was\n\nnot an issue for Iréne, who, on 24 May 1888, married\n\ninto the House of Hohenzollern when she wed Prinz\n\nHeinrich (\"Harry\") of Prussia. It was also acceptable\n\nto Ludwig when Princess Victoria married Henry of\n\nBattenberg.\n\nAfter her marriage, Ella continued to attend Lutheran\n\nservices in St Petersburg. She showed a keen interest in\n\nRussian Orthodoxy, and, his perverse behaviour aside,\n\nSergei enjoyed instructing her.\n\nFour years after her marriage, Ella made a trip that\n\nwould change her Life. A beautiful church had been\n\nconstructed in Jerusalem, at the foot of the Mount\n\nof Olives, in honour of the late Tsarina Maria\n\nAlexandrovna. In 1889, the Tsar delegated his\n\nyoungest brothers, Sergei and Paul, to represent him\n\nat the consecration ceremonies, and Ella excitedly\n\nmade the trip in September to join them and be present\n\nas well. Ella made the most of the trip, happily \"sight-\n\nseeing\" and exploring the Holy Land. In awe of and\n\nprofoundly moved by all around her, all that she was\n\nseeing and experiencing, Ella ecstatically wrote her\n\nbrother Ernst (\"Ernie\") in Hesse, \"You cannot think how\n\njoyful it is to see all these Holy places, to go on the same\n\nroads where our Lord walked and lived... You cannot\n\nimagine what profound impression it makes on entering\n\nthe Holy Sepulchre...\"\n\nIt was while in the Holy Land that Ella prayed for a\n\npersonal miracle: a child of her own.\n\nIt was during the emotional, dazzling and intricate\n\nconsecration ceremonies for the new Church of Saint\n\nMary Magdalene that it is thought that Ella also began\n\nto doubt her own Lutheran Faith (especially as the\n\n\"*only* way\") and move more firmly towards embracing\n\nRussian Orthodoxy. She continued this self-examination,\n\nexploration and religious search upon her return to St\n\nPetersburg, believing, more and more, that Russian\n\nOrthodoxy offered her a more direct communion with\n\nthe Almighty, this last an interest that had also consumed\n\nher mother, Princess Alice. Both Ella and Alice unceasingly\n\nsought a deeper, more personal relationship with God,\n\never in search of harmony and knowledge.\n\nHer renewed and intensified interest also changed her\n\nfooting with Sergei somewhat - realizing her seriousness,\n\nSergei threw himself into instructing Ella with all due care.\n\nWhen Ella was at last certain of her decision and satisfied\n\nthat conversion would bring her personal happiness and\n\nreligious fulfillment, she at length decided to write her equally-\n\ndevout father (who had been nettled by his late wife's\n\nrestless searching on religious issues; his was not a\n\nquestioning spirit, he simply accepted and had faith and did\n\nnot truly understand nor appreciate the religious quests of\n\nothers.) As she feared, Ludwig of Hesse was appalled,\n\nfearing Ella risked Heaven itself in abandoning the Faith she\n\nhad once sworn to observe. He speedily wrote back, \"God\n\nprotect and forgive you if doing wrong...\"\n\nElla was certain she was not erring, and further bolstered\n\nby the understanding and approval of both her sister\n\nVictoria, and by Queen Victoria, who sent their own letters\n\nof support, Ella officially converted to Russian Orthodoxy\n\nin January 1891, becoming the \"truly believing Grand\n\nDuchess Yelisaveta Fydorovna.\" (Saint Fydor is the\n\nRussian Orthodox patron saint of converts, and many\n\nconverts took the patronymic of Fydorovich/Fydorovna,\n\nas appropriate, upon conversion.)\n\nThe effect on Ella was profound, and she threw herself\n\nwholeheartedly into the observances and practices of\n\nher new religion. A cousin, Prince Nicholas of Greece,\n\nobserved that Ella's piety added \"a certain mixture of\n\nidealism and mystery\" which only enhanced the well-\n\nknown charm and personal sweetness of the Grand Duchess.\n\nNo snob, Ella's search for direct and simple communion\n\nwith her Maker led her to worship amongst the peasants,\n\nwho adored her for it.\n\nAccounts differ as to the true status of the relationship\n\nbetween the Grand Duke and Duchess. Some have it\n\nthat it was harmonious, unified by a mutual wish for\n\nchildren, though Ella disapproved of Sergei's severe\n\npersonality and prejudices, while others have it that the\n\nrelationship had settled into a cool arrangement, with\n\nElla thoroughly disillusioned but equally certain that\n\nthere was nothing she could do to change Sergei,\n\nwithdrawing further and further into the comfort she\n\nderived from her religion and its practice.\n\nAlexander III appointed his brother Sergei to the post\n\nof Governor General of Moscow, and Sergei and Ella\n\nduly moved there. As deeply effected by their father's\n\nassassination as had been Sergei, Alexander knew his\n\nbrother was the man to enact his severe and\n\nrepressive policies. Ella was horrified by the form these\n\ntook, and the way Sergei exercised his power. Sergei's\n\nreputation as cold and brutal grew, and he was feared\n\nand disliked even within the family. Especially brutal\n\nwas his treatment of Moscow's Jews, whom he drove\n\nrelentlessly out of the city in their tens of thousands,\n\nrequiring any Jewish woman or girl who unwisely chose\n\nto stay to register as a prostitute. The Jews, Sergei\n\nsincerely believed, were \"the killers of Christ\" and thus\n\nnot worthy of human consideration.\n\nAlmost as if to counterbalance Sergei's cruelty, Ella\n\nincreased her charitable concerns. The way the Grand\n\nDucal couple were perceived by many was to be at\n\nopposite ends of the moral spectrum. Though some\n\nin the Imperial Family preserved their affection for\n\nSergei, there were not many. Most found him cold\n\nand oddly disagreeable at best.\n\nIn Moscow, Ella at least made one good friend,\n\nPrincess Alexandra of Greece, the niece of Minnie\n\n(the Empress Marie Fydorovna, the wife of Sasha.)\n\nThrough her mother, Queen of Greece (née Grand\n\nDuchess Olga Konstatinova Romanova, herself the\n\ngranddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I) \"Aline,\" as\n\nAlexandra was called, was also closely related to\n\nthe Imperial Family was well. In 1889, Aline had\n\nmarried the Grand Duke Paul, the youngest brother of\n\nthe Tsar and Sergei. As sweet-natured as Ella herself,\n\nAline and Ella rapidly became close friends, making\n\nElla happier in Moscow than she had been in St.\n\nPetersburg. This happiness was short-lived, however,\n\nwhen Aline, a frequent visitor to Ella at Illinskoe, died\n\nduring childbirth. Already the mother of a little girl (Ella's\n\nfuture ward Maria Pavlovna) Aline, heavily pregnant,\n\nhad dashed exuberantly down to the Moscow River\n\nand jumped into a small boat. It was believed she\n\nsomehow shifted her unborn child, bringing on premature\n\nlabour later that evening. To the horror of everyone, Aline\n\nfell rapidly into a coma, and, still unconscious, was\n\ndelivered of a son after six days, after which she died.\n\nGrand Duke Paul immediately fell apart, and Sergei\n\nswore to help his bereft brother raise his children. The\n\nnew baby was christened Dmitri and he and his sister\n\nwere frequent visitors at the homes of Ella and Sergei,\n\ncoming to live with them permanently after the Grand\n\nDuke Paul remarried - inappropriately, morganatically -\n\nand left Russia in disgrace, eleven years later.\n\nThe next year, Ella suffered another loss with the death\n\nof her father, Ludwig, in Hesse. She traveled home\n\nto be present when he died, and his death reminded her\n\nof how far away she lived, how distant she was, in\n\nmany ways, from her family and the memories of her\n\npast in Hesse.\n\nElla had long been concerned about the future of her\n\nyoungest surviving sister, Princess Alix of Hesse. It had\n\nbeen at Ella's wedding to Sergei that the Tsarevich\n\nNicholas had shyly pressed the present of a brooch,\n\nwhich he had personally selected especially for Alix,\n\ninto her hand. Flustered by the gesture and distracted by\n\nthe excitement of a children's party, the twelve year old\n\nhad simply given it back. Then, flustered himself, the\n\nTsarevich next offered the brooch to his younger sister,\n\nXenia, \"who not knowing [the brooch's] history, happily\n\naccepted it.\"\n\nOn the death of Ludwig IV, Ella and Alix's only surviving\n\nbrother, Ernst Ludwig, became the new Grand Duke.\n\nBoth Ella and Alix adored the creative, highly-strung\n\n\"Ernie.\" With Alice long dead, Victoria in England with\n\nher growing family, Ella in Russia, Iréne in Prussia with a\n\ngrowing family of her own (like Ella's Romanov in-laws\n\nand her own Hessian family, Iréne began to quickly\n\nproduce progeny within a year of her 1888 nuptials)\n\nonly Ernie and Alix remained in Hesse. Like Alix,\n\nErnie was unmarried, and so Alix filled in the role of\n\n\"Landesmutter.\"\n\nFor her part, Alix was somewhat restive to the idea of\n\nmarriage. Her grandmother, Queen Victoria, was *very*\n\nkeen on the idea of matching the \"magnificent Alix\" to\n\nher very unpromising grandson, Prince Albert Victor \"Eddy\"\n\nof England, the heir to the Prince of Wales and a future\n\nKing of England. Alix was unmoved by the grand destiny\n\nof her languid, certainly intellectually-deficient cousin. Though\n\nhe duly proposed, Alix let it be known that much as she\n\n\"liked [him] as a cousin\" (which was arguable ;) she would\n\nonly agree \"if forced,\" but was very certain that neither of\n\nthem would be happy with one another.\n\nIt appears that, even at this early date, Alix was trying to\n\ndismiss from her mind the charming Tsarevich, for she\n\nknew that marriage with Nicholas would absolutely *require*\n\nconversion to Russian Orthodoxy, which Alix simply\n\ncould not imagine doing. It was a war for Alix's heart:\n\nher emotions pulling her in two different directions at once.\n\nThe first deciding factor would be the marriage of Ernie.\n\nWhile Queen Victoria could not convince Alix to accept\n\n\"Eddy,\" she could, and did, prevail upon Ernie to accept\n\nher plan for him: that he marry Princess Victoria Melita\n\nof Edinburgh, the second daughter of the Duke of\n\nEdinburgh and Ella's sister-in-law, the Grand Duchess\n\nMarie Alexandrovna.\n\nVictoria had been thwarted in a previous match-\n\nmaking plan, that of matching Ducky's eldest sister,\n\nPrincess Marie (\"Missy\") with Prince George of\n\nWales. This match was heavily favoured by Missy's\n\nfather, the Duke of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-\n\nGotha, but equally disapproved of by his wife,\n\nthe Duchess Marie (née Grand Duchess Maria\n\nAlexandrovna Romanova, Ella's sister-in-law) who\n\ninitial unease with the English Court and her in-laws\n\nhad hardened, with the demise of her marriage, into\n\ndeep disdain and dislike. Duchess Marie preferred\n\nContinental, preferably German (or Germanicly-\n\nconnected) spouses for her four attractive daughters.\n\nNo way would she countenance a match between\n\nMissy, considered one of the great beauties of her\n\ngeneration, and Georgie, if for no other reason than\n\nshe wished to thwart both her mother-in-law, whom\n\nshe considered an insufferable busybody, and her\n\nhusband, with whom she had been long disenchanted.\n\nDuchess Marie's match-making of Missy with Crown\n\nPrince Ferdinand (\"Nando\") von Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen,\n\nthe heir (though not son) of the King of Romania. Marie's\n\nhurried match of Missy and Nando was so rushed that\n\nRoyal Europe was shocked - surely the beautiful and\n\nwell-connected Missy could \"do better\" than the awkward\n\n\"Nando\" and with only the Throne of backwater Romania\n\nto which to look forward.\n\n\"Affie\" (Prince Alfred, son of Queen Victoria, husband of\n\nMarie and himself the Duke of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-\n\nGotha) was so disappointed with Missy's marriage that\n\nMarie knew she could not press her luck by refusing a\n\n*second* English-favoured match, so she agreed, albeit\n\nsomewhat grudgingly to the pairing of her second daughter\n\nwith the Hessian Grand Duke, and vocally hoped that\n\nVictoria had not influenced Ernie too much.\n\nAt first blush, the matching of \"Ernie and Ducky\" seemed a\n\nsmart piece of business. Both were highly-strung, lively,\n\npersonable, intelligent, creative, artistic, attractive and social\n\ncreatures. But always, even from the inception, there were\n\ninherent problems. The prospective Hessian \"Landesmutter\"\n\nwas already in love - with the Grand Duke Kyril Vladimirovich,\n\nthe eldest son of Ella's brother-in-law, Vladimir Alexandrovich.\n\nFirst cousins were forbidden to marry by the Russian\n\nOrthodox Church, but the Anglican (and Evangelisch)\n\nChurch did (does) allow for first cousin marriages, and\n\nthis, on 19 April 1894, Schloß Ehrenburg, Ducky did,\n\nwhen she married Ernie.\n\nFurther complicating matters from the Ducky and Ernie\n\nstandpoint, aside from the bride being in love with another,\n\nwas the fact that the groom was homosexual. It was\n\nhardly a recipe for marital bliss.\n\nAlix had been long tormented about the issue of Nicky\n\nand her growing love for him. For their part, Nicky's\n\nparents had been discouraging, in fact, their personal\n\nliking for Ella aside, had done all they could to dissuade\n\ntheir son from marriage to the Hessian Princess. But\n\nas firm as Alix was on the matter of her religion, Nicky\n\nwas equally (and perhaps, for the only time in his Life)\n\nfirm on the issue that he would consider *no one* else.\n\nWhen it became apparent that the Tsar's health was\n\nfailing, Sasha and Minnie at last capitulated with good\n\nwill: Nicky could propose to Alix with their blessing.\n\n(Perhaps they hoped the matter would be resolved if\n\nAlix absolutely refused to convert, thus definitively\n\nsettling the matter.)\n\nNicky arrived in Hesse for the wedding of Ernie and\n\nDucky determined to leave an engaged man.\n\nLong aware of the situation, Ella had done her best to\n\ngently counsel and console Alix, who had become quite\n\noverwrought over the entire dilemma. Conversion, she\n\nassured Alix, was nothing to be feared. After all, she\n\nhad been exactly as Alix was - a Lutheran becoming\n\nOrthodox.\n\nThough the matter of religion was, without doubt, the\n\nlargest factor in Alix's considerations, also apparent to\n\nAlix was that she could not continue living as she was.\n\nDucky would soon be the new \"Landesmutter\" and\n\nFirst Lady (as Ernie's wife) of Hesse. Unmarried and\n\nno longer needed by Ernie in that capacity, what would\n\nAlix do? There are also some accounts that, even at\n\nthis early time, it was already obvious that Alix and\n\nDucky were hardly to be expected to be \"simpatico\"\n\n(and weren't.)\n\nAs History knows, it was a very successful wedding,\n\naside from the groom and bride themselves. Nicky of\n\nRussia proposed to Alix of Hesse, and was accepted.\n\n(Hessian weddings seemed to provide the impetus for\n\nmany Royal engagements, such as Beatrice of England\n\nwith Henry \"Liko\" of Battenberg, and Marie Louise\n\nof Schleswig-Holstein to Aribert of Anhalt, et al, -\n\nthough not all of these pairings would be successful!)\n\nElla was thrilled. With the tragic death of Princess\n\nAline (Alexandra) of Greece in 1891, Ella had been lonely,\n\nand had happily grasped the idea of her younger sister\n\nfinding happiness in Russia and living close by. Ella\n\ncould also have had few doubts about Nicholas: the\n\nTsarevich had long made his feelings plain about Alix,\n\nand over the years, her home and heart provided a\n\nconduit for Alix and Nicky.\n\nAlix soon came to Russia to receive the blessing of the\n\nfailing Tsar. Ella would have heard the dark mutterings\n\nof how Alix \"came to [the Russian people] behind a\n\ncoffin\" as Alix's nuptials ended up closely following the\n\nfuneral services of Alexander III.\n\nElla's experience radically differed from that of her sister.\n\nAlix went almost literally from her home in Hesse to\n\nthe pinnacle of Russian Imperial society, on the Throne\n\nnext to her uncertain, overwhelmed husband. Unlike\n\nwhatever uncertainties and darkness may have plagued\n\nthe bedroom of Sergei and Ella, Nicholas and the new\n\n\"Alexandra Fydorovna\" (as Alix became upon her\n\npremarital conversion to Russian Orthodoxy) would\n\nenjoy one of the greatest of Royal love stories, truly, a\n\n\"Lifelong Passion\" they would share until their murders\n\nin 1918, twenty-three and one half years later.\n\nAs, it must have seemed to Ella, because it happened to\n\neveryone else, the marriage of Nicky and Alix quickly\n\nproduced a baby, when the new Tsar and Tsarina welcomed\n\ntheir first child, the Grand Duchess Olga Nicholevna, on 15\n\nNovember 1895, a mere eleven days before their first\n\nwedding anniversary.\n\nMarried, by this time, for over eleven years, had Ella\n\ngiven up all hopes of a child of her own?\n\nWith a seemingly unending list of new responsibilities,\n\nobligations and duties, Alix turned to Ella, and Ella was\n\nonly too pleased to aid her sister in any way. There had\n\nalready been \"rubs\" between Alix and the Dowager\n\nTsarina (Marie Fydorovna, \"Minnie,\" who was not only\n\nAlix's mother-in-law but Ella's sister-in-law) and Ella\n\ndid what she could to defuse them.\n\nBut disaster had only slept for the Romanovs, and woke\n\nagain with the Coronation of Nicholas II and Alexandra.\n\nAnd, as Ella had moved in to aid her sister in her transition\n\nfrom Hessian princess to Russian Orthodox convert to\n\nRomanov bride and then Tsarina and mother, Sergei moved\n\nin to help Nicholas.\n\nThe first disaster would be at the Khodynka Meadow. As\n\nwas traditional, open-air feasts, laden with food, alcohol and\n\ncommemorative trinkets, had been prepared for the people\n\nin honour of the Coronation. Sergei had been in charge of\n\nthose in and around Moscow, and at the Khodynka site,\n\nhis decisions proved disastrous. Security was minimal\n\n(especially given the thousands who arrived to participate)\n\nand a stampede and riot ensued when rumours spread that\n\nthere was not enough food, alcohol and \"goodies\" for\n\neveryone. In a mere fifteen minutes, almost fifteen hundred\n\npeople died and thousands were wounded. Sergei was\n\nblamed for negligence, but later exonerated. Unfortunately,\n\nSergei was to compound his error by insisting on what\n\nfollowed, for which Nicky and Alix would be blamed.\n\nThe new Tsar and Tsarina were horrified, and there first\n\ninstincts were to cancel a lavish dinner being held that evening.\n\nSergei and the other Grand Dukes insisted that the dinner\n\ncontinue as planned - no need to cause a \"political situation,\"\n\nthey felt, by risking offending the French (whose dinner it\n\nwas.) Nicky and Alix tried to demur - they wished not only\n\na cancellation, but to immediately withdraw into a prayerful\n\nreligious retreat, but Sergei and the others prevailed.\n\nThough the Tsar and Tsarina insisted not only on visiting the\n\nhorrors at Khodynka, and paying for separate burial for the\n\nvictims (instead of allowing them to be disposed of in a\n\nmass grave) and medical care for the wounded, that news\n\ndid not disseminate broadly. All that was seen was that the\n\nnew Tsar and his wife were callous and unfeeling, that they\n\nattended a grand fête on the very night of such a tragedy.\n\nAs I recall, Ella went with the Nicholas and Alexandra,\n\nand witnessed the horrors of the Khodynka Meadow. Like\n\nAlix, her instincts were to withdraw and pray, even that it\n\nwas during the Coronation festivities.\n\nElla could have only been repulsed by Sergei's difference\n\nof opinion (and lack of foresight) on the matter. She certainly\n\nwould see how her sister would \"pay\" for a disaster entirely\n\nNOT of her making.\n\nElla would also bear witness, not only to her sister's happiness,\n\nbut Alix's increasing frustration that, though Grand Duchesses\n\narrived in satisfying - and healthy - succession (with the births\n\nof Grand Duchesses Tatiana, Marie and Anastasia Nicholevna,\n\nin 1897, 1899 and 1901, respectively) Russia still lacked the\n\nall-important male heir. While Ella would have understood the\n\nneed for a boy, she might have also been wistful that Alix was\n\nat least having children, while she still had none, or had Ella\n\nbecome completely resigned to the fact that children simply\n\nwere \"not part of God's plan\" for her?\n\nIn 1902, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, the widower of\n\nElla's dear friend Princess Aline of Greece, remarried.\n\nUnfortunately, his choice was controversial, to say the\n\nleast. On 27 September 1902, Paul married Olga Valerienovna\n\nKarnova, his mistress of long-standing and already mother\n\nof three of his children. For this stunt, as Paul had foreseen,\n\nhe was promptly banished from Russia, Olga Valerieovna\n\nand their children in tow.\n\nThis had repercussions for Ella as, remembering his promise\n\nwhen Princess Aline of Greece had died, Sergei stepped\n\nin and took guardianship of Paul's children by Aline,\n\nMarie and Dmitri. The children did not come as strangers:\n\ngiven the past affection between their parents and Ella and\n\nSergei, they had long known them. But now, their father\n\nwas gone.\n\nSergei had certain expectations of the children, however.\n\nUpon taking custody, he announced \"I am your father now,\"\n\nto them, and was annoyed when the children still proclaimed\n\nthat they loved the Grand Duke Paul, even that he had left\n\nRussia - and them. Sergei was stern, dictatorial and expected\n\ntotal obedience, but for all his cruel and odd behaviour to\n\nothers, Sergei also proved himself a doting and involved father-\n\nfigure. The same cannot be said of Ella, of whom it was sadly\n\nnoted, seemed to resent these children, who had been buffeted\n\nby tragedy and the decisions of the adults around them.\n\nParticularly sad was the adoration the young Marie Pavlovna\n\nwould show for \"Aunt Ella,\" whom she adored and believed\n\nto be the most beautiful woman who ever lived. Marie\n\nPavlovna would write, with the clarity and guilelessness of a\n\nchild, about enjoying watching her beautiful aunt prepare for\n\nRoyal occasions, longing to be embraced by her, and\n\nbeing driven back, cringing, by Ella's \"hard look\" when the\n\nchild threw her arms around \"that snowy neck\" to kiss her\n\nwith affection and adoration.\n\nIt was readily apparent to both children that \"Aunt Ella\"\n\nfound them to be a \"disagreeable presence\" in her homes,\n\nlittle entities that were best avoided.\n\nAll of this was all the more ironic, for Dmitri and \"Marisha,\"\n\nas Grand Duchess Marie Pavolvna was known (to\n\ndifferentiate her from another Grand Duchess of the same\n\nname and patronymic, this \"Marie Pavlovna the Elder\"\n\nwas nicknamed \"Miechen\") were the children of a woman\n\nwhom could fairly be termed Ella's best friend. One\n\nmight think that Ella's love for Aline would have motivated\n\nher to cherish her dead friend's now-motherless children,\n\nto love them as she would her own.\n\nIt was not to be.\n\nThough all continued, on the surface, as long it had, there\n\nmust have been significant undercurrents in the marriage of\n\nSergei and Ella.\n\nTwo events in 1904 must have effected Ella deeply. Firstly,\n\nElla and Sergei went to visit a \"holy hermit.\" Russian\n\nOrthodoxy is filled with wandering holy men and women,\n\nas well as hermits (male and female) whose departure from\n\nsecular Life, even into total aesthetic lifestyles, led to their\n\nreputations for saintliness, even prophecy. It was one such\n\nhermit which Ella and Sergei sought out in the Summer of\n\n1904: he predicted darkly that, within a year, Sergei would\n\ndie... \"his head smashed to atoms.\"\n\nElla was horrified.\n\nThe second event began with such hope and was, initially,\n\nthe cause of unabashed jubilation: on 12 August 1904, Alix\n\ngave birth to the long-awaited son and heir, the Tsarevich\n\nAlexei Nicholaevich. However, this momentous event was\n\nsoon overshadowed by the tragic news that this baby was a\n\nhemophiliac. How soon did Alix share this news with her\n\nsister? Certainly, Ella would have commiserated: both sisters\n\nknew of the specter of hemophilia that hovered over their\n\nfamily; their brother Frittie had died from complications\n\nfollowing a fall in 1873 (an event which had plunged their\n\nmother into a deep depression) and their sister Iréne had\n\nat least one hemophiliac son.\n\nNow, it was Alix's turn to despair. She had wanted a son\n\nso keenly, besieged the very gates of Heaven to produce\n\nthe son that her husband and his people needed. And now\n\nshe had one, but the child had this dread disease, and\n\nincreasingly, Alix felt she could not be both the instrument of\n\nher son's illness and that of his release. This feeling would\n\nset the stage for a miracle worker, for Rasputin.\n\nBut these events were still in the future.\n\n1905 brought more drama, more groundwork for the\n\ntragedies would come. There was the disastrous war\n\nagainst Japan, as well as \"Bloody Sunday,\" in which the\n\nTsar's soldiers fired upon peaceful demonstrators who had\n\ngathered to see their Tsar with petitions and holy icons.\n\nThousands were injured and killed, men, women and even\n\nchildren. It was a gruesome fiasco which fueled the blood\n\nof revolutionaries.\n\nAnd few were hated by the revolutionaries as was the Grand\n\nDuke Sergei, who was seen as the author of so much\n\nbrutality. In an odd twist of Fate, an offspring of the \"Will of\n\nthe People\" terrorist sect which had been involved in the\n\nassassination of Alexander II, the \"Socialist Revolutionary Party,\"\n\nnow determined to eliminate Sergei. It was led by Ezno Azev,\n\na Jew, who had never forgotten or forgiven the murders of\n\nmany of his family members during the past pogroms nor\n\nSergei's vicious expulsion of the Jews from Moscow. Azev\n\ndispatched the same two men who had earlier assassinated\n\nthe hated Minister of the Interior, Plehve; Boris Savinkov and\n\nIvan Kalyaev.\n\nAs much as he loathed Sergei, Kalyaev refused to kill either\n\nElla, nor Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and Grand Duke\n\nDmitri Pavlovich, who were often in Sergei's company. On\n\nFriday, 17 February 1905, Kalyaev at last found his prey alone,\n\nand threw a bomb into the carriage carrying Sergei, who was\n\ninstantly killed.\n\nThe explosion could be heard through the Kremlin, and even\n\nto Ella's own apartments. She would later say she knew that\n\nimmediately what had happened and that Sergei was dead.\n\nFollowed by Marie and Dmitri's governess, Ella flung herself\n\ninto the street and could not be dissuaded from getting to the\n\nside of her husband. Kneeling in the bloodstained snow, Ella\n\nremoved the rings from his right hand (including his wedding\n\nband) and wiped his face. Few forgot the sight of the contrast\n\nbetween Ella's beautiful blue velvet gown, the white snow,\n\nand the blood blackening everything, everywhere. When a\n\nstretcher arrived, Ella began to calmly gather the bleeding bits\n\nof her husband, placing them on the blankets with her shattered\n\nhusband's remains. The Grand Duchess was soon, ineffably,\n\ninevitably, covered in her husband's blood.\n\nWhen Sergei's body had been removed, Ella retired with it\n\nto the Chudov monastery to pray, \"submitting to the Will of\n\nGod.\"\n\nMany remarked on the courageousness of the Grand Duchess,\n\nwho insisted on visiting the man who had murdered her husband.\n\nTheir conversation was noted, and says much about Ella's\n\nbeliefs and state of mind. When Ella admits it is pitiable that\n\nit was only by such a terrible action that feelings should thus\n\nbe known, that she wishes he could have come to her before,\n\nKalyaev rails at her, \"So you think it is easy to go to you?\n\nSurely you know what happened on January 4 when they went\n\nto the Tsar. Do you really believe that this could go unpunished?\n\nThere is also that terrible war that people hate so much. You\n\nhave declared war on the people and we took up the challenge.\n\nI would give my life thousand times, not just once. Russia must\n\nbe free.\"\n\nWhile Ella had been conciliatory and tearful to this point, she is\n\nnot a simpering push-over - the man had brutally murdered her\n\nhusband. With some spirit, Ella observed, \"in war men fight\n\neach other, face to face,and you have murdered from behind,\n\nand that is not war but cowardice. You think that you are the\n\nonly ones that suffer; we also suffer and I assure you, we wish\n\nonly good for the people.\"\n\nElla then attempted to talk about Sergei, about the man who\n\nwas her husband. Evidently, Ella wanted Kalyaev to know\n\nthat he had killed so much more than a symbol, more than a\n\nmember of the Imperial Family, more than a Grand Duke,\n\nbut also a man, a man who was her husband. Kalyaev wouldn't\n\nhave any of it, and Ella conceded. She stood and said, \"Yes,\n\nI don't want to enter into discussion with you. I only wanted\n\nyou to know that the Grand Duke forgives you and that I will\n\npray for you. I beg you to accept this icon in my memory.\"\n\nIvan Kalyaev was executed on 23 May 1905 in the courtyard\n\nof the Schlusselburg Fortress outside of St Petersburg. His\n\nbody was left hanging for thirty minutes after his death before\n\nbeing cut down.\n\nDespite all that had happened, Ella refused to dwell on Sergei's\n\nmany shortcomings. In fact, Ella effectively canonized the man\n\nwho had so disappointed her in Life and nearly venerated him\n\nas a saint. People who knew Sergei in Life might have found it\n\n*very* difficult to recognize him in the idealistic way in which\n\nElla now chose to remember him. \"I hope God,\" she said,\n\n\"might give me strength, that never one can say I was worthy of\n\nhaving been in olden times guided by such a true noble husband\n\nand true Christian.\" She had a cross erected on the site where\n\nSergei died, inscribed with the words, \"Forgive them, Lord, for\n\nthey know not what they do.\"\n\nThe marriage that had begun with such hope and optimism in\n\n1884 was over.\n\nAs could be expected, she withdrew and found solace in her\n\nreligion; now all that was left to her, all that really mattered.\n\nThough many expected that Ella, still beautiful at forty-one,\n\nwould remarry. Nothing Ella ever said or did appears to\n\ngive credence to the idea that she ever considered marrying\n\nagain. She threw herself whole-heartedly into charitable\n\nefforts, her ideas of what she would do with the rest of her\n\nLife increasingly taking on clarity and form.\n\nMuch would happen after Sergei's death, both to Ella and to\n\nRussia. Ella found it increasingly difficult to \"understand\"\n\nthe youngest sister who reigned as Tsarina and consort, yet\n\nshe possessed some of the very same, blind, insistence on\n\nseeing things the way she *wanted* to see them, and then\n\ntruly *believing* that they were, indeed, that way.\n\n~ C.\n\n--\n\n--\n\n~ CEM-L-G"
