        "text": "The following text was taken from the official program for the marriage of Nicholas and Alexandra. I recently found a rare original copy of this book on the Internet and I am happy to share it with everyone here.

The text appeared first in Russian and then in French. This translation from the French was done by Rob Moshein, and we should all thank him for this translation. We also want to thank Timothy F. Boettger for providing us the proper forms of titles and of address.
