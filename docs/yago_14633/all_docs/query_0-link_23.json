Against this view were arranged large wooden cutouts of cabbages. A few friends dressed in rental costumes waited to act out their parts. Alice Guy was about to direct La Fée aux Choux (The Cabbage Fairy), the short film that would earn her an undisputed place in film history\n\nas the first woman film director and probably the first film director to produce narrative films.\n\nAlice Guy was born at Saint-Mondé on the outskirts of Paris on July 1, 1875, because her mother (whose name has been lost to history) was determined that her fifth child be born in France. Alice's father Emile Guy owned bookshops in Valparaiso and Santiago, Chile. Within a few months of her birth, her parents returned to Chile, leaving her in the care of her maternal grandmother. Three-year-old Alice rejoined her parents in South America, but when she reached school age, she was returned to France and enrolled in the same school her three sisters attended at the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Viry. Then a series of disasters, including an earthquake, left the family bankrupt, and Alice was sent to a less expensive convent in the château of Voltaire at Ferney. Following the death of their only son, the Guys returned to France, settled in Paris, and Alice completed her education there.\n\nThere is nothing connected with the staging of a motion picture that a woman cannot do as easily as a man, and there is no reason why she cannot completely master every technicality of the art.\n\n—Alice Guy-Blaché\n\nWhen Emile Guy died at age 51, his wife was poorly prepared to support the two daughters who remained at home. A family friend suggested that Alice take typing and stenography lessons. Noting her rapid progress, her instructor recommended her for a secretarial position at Comptoir général de Photographie. This company, which made and sold film and equipment for still photography, was soon acquired by Alice Guy's employer, Léon Gaumont, and renamed the Société des établissements Gaumont.\n\nIn 1895, Louis Lumière brought Gaumont his new invention, a camera that filmed moving objects. Though Gaumont soon developed his own version of the camera, he saw little practical use for it. Alice, however, was intrigued by the possibilities. To demonstrate the new cameras, Lumière and Gaumont both shot short films of actual events: parades, trains arriving at railroad stations, and portraits of laboratory personnel. Alice was convinced that there would be more interest in films that told stories. Gaumont, thinking the camera was little more than a toy, agreed to her making a film as long as it did not interfere with her secretarial duties.\n\nGuy was in the office every morning at eight to open, record, and distribute the mail. Then she would commute to the Buttes Chaumont to work on her films. She returned to the office by 4:30 and often worked until 10 or 11 at night handling correspondence and other details. To help shorten her commute, Gaumont arranged for her to rent a house behind the photographic studio and granted the use of a paved terrace covered by a glass roof next to the studios.\n\nIn 1896, she directed La Fée aux choux, based on an old French tale about a fairy who raises children in a cabbage patch. Whether this was the first story film is still unsettled. Most film histories, which make no mention at all of Alice Guy-Blaché, credit French filmmaker Georges Méliès (known as \"father of the fiction film\") with making the first narrative films. Anthony Slide, Charles Ford, and others believe that La Fée aux Choux preceded Méliès' first effort by a few months. According to Guy-Blaché's daughter Simone Blaché , this film was shown in 1896 at the International Exhibition in Paris. Regardless, Alice Guy and Méliès, working independently, were discovering and using similar story-telling techniques at about the same time.\n\nGuy describes some of those techniques in her memoirs. By reversing the film, a house that fell down could be magically reconstructed. Slowing down or speeding up the turn of the handle on the camera could produce frenzied movement or slow motion. Stopping the camera allowed objects to be moved, creating the impression they were animated by a supernatural life. Fade outs could be used for visions and dreams. Double exposures and masks allowed other special effects.\n\nThese early films were short, about 75 feet in length. The titles suggest the story lines: Leçon de danse (Dance Lesson, 1897), Le Déjeuner des enfants (The Children's Lunch, 1899–1900), Les Dangers de l'alcoolisme (The Dangers of Alcohol, 1899–1900). They were so successful that Gaumont named Alice Guy head of production and in 1901 built a studio for her use. There she began to produce more sophisticated films, many painstakingly tinted by hand by artisans working in the laboratory. As film quality improved and mechanical methods of film development replaced tedious hand developing, longer films were possible. These often ran 150 feet, while one, La Vie du Christ (1906), ran almost 2,000 feet.\n\nWhen Gaumont bought the rights to the newly invented Chronophone, a device that synchronized sound, recorded on a wax cylinder, with the projector, Guy directed a series of talking pictures between 1900 and 1907. Some featured popular singers, others were scenes from operas including Carmen, Mignon, Manon, Faust, and Les Dragons de Villars. The work was demanding. The role of the director included responsibility for the scenario and choice of actors, working with the decorators and costumers, overseeing lighting, rehearsals and stage direction, editing and cutting the final film. It was also filled with unexpected problems. In one instance, Guy decided to use a gypsy (Rom) camp as the location for Volée par les bohémiens (1904). The scenario included a bear which the animal trainer had tied under a wagon. Startled by the screams of the actress whose foot he sniffed, the bear escaped and jumped on a goat. As the trainer tugged and the gypsies rushed to save the goat, the bear turned to a donkey which fled, braying wildly. The camera captured the melee and, according to Alice Guy, this \"added greatly to the interest of the film.\"\n\nAs demand for films grew, Guy worked with several assistants, including Victorin Jasset. (Early film historians often erroneously credited direction of Guy's films to these assistants.) Jasset helped her manage the 250–300 extras and the outdoor scenes in La Vie du Christ (1906). The film, based on illustrations by James Tissot, was lavish by the standards of the time: 25 solid sets were constructed, costumes were carefully matched to Tissot's documents, and two Jesuits were brought in as consultants. La Vie du Christ was undoubtedly one of the first large spectacle films, with superimpositions used to depict Jesus rising from the sepulchre.\n\nIn 1906, Herbert Blaché-Bolton arrived at Gaumont headquarters from the company's English office to work with the camera. Intent on learning film directing, he accompanied Guy to film the bullfights at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. By Christmastime, they were engaged; they were married in 1907.\n\nMeanwhile, Gaumont had the sold rights to the Chronophone to a Cleveland entrepreneur, and the newlyweds were sent to the United States to represent Gaumont's interests. (Once in the U.S., the couple dropped Bolton from their name and were known as Herbert Blaché and Alice Guy-Blaché.) When the Cleveland company went bankrupt, the Blachés moved to Flushing, New York, to head up Gaumont's manufacturing and film-production activities. In 1908, Alice Guy-Blaché gave birth to a daughter Simone, but she was soon restless with domestic life and decided to return to films.\n\nOn September 7, 1910, Guy-Blaché—along with her husband and George A. Magie—founded the Solax Company. Alice was president and director-in-chief. (Herbert was still under contract to Gaumont.) That same year, Solax released its first film, A Child's Sacrifice.Magda Foy , later known as the \"Solax Kid,\" played an eight-year-old girl who tries to aid her starving family. With her father out on strike and her mother ill, the child sells her doll to a junk dealer who then gives it back as a present. The girl goes on to intervene in a bitter quarrel provoked by the strike.\n\nAt first, the new company rented the Gaumont's Flushing studio. But Solax prospered and, in 1912, moved production to a new studio complex in Fort Lee, New Jersey. News reports described the size and complexity of the nascent operation. The studio had south-facing windows two stories high. There were also shops for building sets and storing props, large dressing rooms for the actors, laboratories and dark-rooms for processing the film, and projection rooms for viewing.\n\nMadame Guy-Blaché directed or actively supervised all the films produced by Solax. Anthony Slide lists well over 300 films that were produced there. Since most of these films were lost and few carried director credits, it is difficult to ascertain which were directed by Guy-Blaché and which by Edward Warren who joined Solax in 1911.\n\nGuy-Blaché attracted considerable interest from the press. Reporters, who often attended filmings, sought interviews frequently. When she could not comply, they wrote articles anyway, in which she learned, she said, \"some absolutely unsuspected details about my beginnings, my family, my ancestors.\" At the time, a woman managing such complex activities was viewed as unique. If, to reassure an actor, Alice had to be the first to stroke the tiger or drape the snake around her neck, she did it. At times when the physical risks were obvious, her husband stepped in, as he would in setting off the explosion to sink the pirate ship in Dick Whittington and His Cat (1913).\n\nIn addition to the technical expertise she had developed, Guy-Blaché had a keen sense of the beauty of a photographic image. She took advantage of the most favorable hour for the best light, noted how the setting sun lengthened shadows, captured the reflections in a rippling pond, and was aware of the waves made by the wind blowing across a field of wheat.\n\nAt Solax, she directed a variety of films. An advertisement in the November 18, 1911, issue ofThe Moving Picture World listed several Solax releases. In the ad, An Interrupted Elopement was announced as a clever comedy in which a couple, held up and detained by thieves, escape as love triumphs. Grandmother Love was promoted as a small, simple drama of the heart, while Only a Squaw boasted beautiful photography. It also heralded a special release: the \"Big Naval Review\" with 102 naval vessels reviewed by President William Howard Taft in New York Harbor. Next to Solax's blazing sun logo was the reminder that \"all our films are tinted and toned.\"\n\nIn 1912, Guy-Blaché gave birth to her second child, a son Reginald. Noting the number of films produced at Solax that year, it is reasonable to assume she was quickly back at the studio. Then, Herbert Blaché left Gaumont and established Blaché Features in October 1913, with himself as president and his wife as vice-president. He persuaded her to join in directing films for the new company, and Solax soon ceased production. The following year, Herbert was involved in another production company, U.S. Amusement Corporation.\n\nWhile Guy-Blaché continued to work for the companies started by her husband, she also directed several films for a New York company, Popular Plays and Players. These included the first two films featuring the dramatic actress Olga Petrova : The Tigress (1914) and The Heart of a Painted Woman (1915). Petrova was impressed by Guy-Blaché's courtesy to artists; by earning their respect, she got the results she sought. Reporters writing for The Moving Picture World also had praise for her directing style. One who visited the location where Fra Diavolo (1912) was being filmed found Guy-Blaché conducting rehearsals on the elevated camera platform. She was never ruffled, never agitated, never annoyed, he wrote. \"With a few simple directions, uttered without apparent emotion, she handles the interweaving movements like a military leader might [handle] the maneuvers of an army.\" Another who visited the set of Dick Whittington and His Cat (1913) commented on \"how sharp and clear-cut is her visualizing power and how thoroughly she knows just what she wants.\" Yet, he observed, she was also quick to find the humor in situations, helping to ease the nervous strain of production.\n\nIn 1917, Guy-Blaché was invited to lecture on film at Columbia University. But small independent filmmakers like the Blachés were finding it more difficult to compete with large, well-financed companies. The last two films Alice directed, The Great Adventure (1918) and Tarnished Reputations (1920), were released through the Pathé Exchange. Lured by the sunny climate, many film companies were moving to California, and the Blachés joined the migration. Herbert was hired to direct several films, but Alice was restricted to a position as his assistant. By this time, the marriage was foundering, and, following a divorce, Guy-Blaché and her two children returned to France in 1922.\n\nWhen Alice Guy-Blaché tried to reestablish herself in the French film industry, she found no one willing to hire her. Since she had left all of her work behind in America, she had no films to show as evidence of her ability. The only offers she received would have required her to make large financial investments in the projects. This she was in no position to do. From time to time, she earned some income by writing summaries of scenarios, short stories, and children's stories.\n\nThe difficulties Alice Guy-Blaché encountered in trying to continue working in film had been foreshadowed in an interview that had appeared in the November 6, 1912, issue of The New York Dramatic Mirror. Talking about her work as a filmmaker, she maintained that she \"would not have been able to accomplish so much in any other country, particularly in France.\" In the United States, she felt, \"the fight and victory is to the strong, irrespective of sex.\" In France, women are \"commonly in a state of dependence, and are not likely to exercise their reason with freedom.\"\n\nPetrova, Olga (1886–1977)\n\nEnglish actress. Born Muriel Harding in England in 1886; died in 1977.\n\nBilled by studio publicists as the daughter of a Russian noble from Warsaw, Poland, Olga Petrova was born Muriel Harding in England in 1886. She played femmes fatales in Hollywood silents for Metro, including The Tigress (1914), The Soul Market (1916), The Undying Flame (1917), The Soul of a Magdalene (1917), Daughter of Destiny (1918), and Panther Woman (1918), and produced and wrote several of her own films. After retiring from the screen in 1918, Petrova returned to the stage, starring in many plays, including three that she had also written.\n\nsuggested reading:\n\nPetrova, Olga. Butter with my Bread (autobiography), 1942.\n\nFor the rest of her life, Guy-Blaché tried to reclaim her place in film history. She lived with her daughter Simone who, from about 1941, worked with the American foreign service, first in France, then in Switzerland. In 1952, when Simone was transferred to Washington, D.C., Alice came with her and began a search for her films but was unsuccessful. All had disappeared. Finally, in 1955, her work as a pioneer in France's motion picture industry was recognized by the award of the French Legion of Honor. Simone Blaché retired to live in the United States, accompanied by her mother. Alice Guy-Blaché died in New Jersey on March 24, 1968.\n\nTo date, film historians have uncovered a few of Guy-Blaché's films. A positive negative of La Fée aux choux exists at the Cinémathèque Française. Anthony Slide lists six one-reelers produced at Solax that are in the National Film Collection at the Library of Congress: Greater Love Hath No Man (1911), The Detective's Dog (1912), Canned Harmony (1912), The Girl in the Armchair (1912), A House Divided (1913) and Matrimony's Speed Limit (1913). A few other films may exist in private collections.\n\nIn trying to reach conclusions about Alice Guy-Blaché's contribution to film history, one fact is obvious. She was prolific. Film historian Francis Lacassin compiled a list of 403 films directed by Alice Guy for Gaumont alone. Anthony Slide asserts that of the 331 films produced by the Solax Company through 1913, she was involved in the production of all of them as supervising director and producer. He credits her with directing 23 more films that were released between 1914 and 1920. Her choice of subject matter ranged widely: comedy, fantasy, religious themes, drama, military and cowboy adventures, adaptations of plays and stories, dance, opera—the list goes on. In addition, she was inventive. While many of the techniques such as running film in reverse or masking or varying the speed of the film may have been discovered by trial and error, the ways in which she used these techniques as story-telling devices was truly creative. As Slide comments about the films in the National Film Collection, they demonstrate \"a remarkable sophistication in storytelling.\" Whether or not historians reach agreement about who was first in producing a narrative film, Alice Guy-Blaché will retain her place as the first woman film director and a remarkably successful one.\n\nsources:\n\nBlaché, Alice Guy.
