THEY ARE NOT INTENDED TO PORTRAY ANY ACTUAL PERSONS OR INCIDENTS\n\nPrologue\n\nGeorge Hare (of Hare, Briggs, Burton, and Kurtnitz) met Carey Arundel for the first time at the annual Critics' Dinner at Verino's. She was to receive a plaque for the best actress performance of the year, Greg Wilson was to get the actor's, and Paul Saffron the director's. These dinners were rather stuffy affairs, but the awards were worth getting; this year Morning Journey was the picture that had swept the board, all the winners having scored in it. George had seen the picture and thought it good, if a trifle tricky. He was far more concerned with his luck in being next to Carey at the dinner, for his own well-concealed importance in the movie world did not always receive such rewards. George had an eye for beauty which, combined with a somewhat cynical nose for fame, made him take special notice of her. Of course he had seen her on the stage as well as on the screen, but he thought she looked best of all in real life--which meant, even more remarkably, that she looked really alive at a party such as this, not merely brought to life by ambition or liquor.\n\nGeorge left her to her other neighbor for a while; he was lazy socially, content often to talk with those who would seek him out, which many people did, liking him personally and eager for any titbit of scandal that might slip from his legally acquired store. He never spilled anything important, but always seemed about to, and nobody realized that he picked up far more than he let drop. He was so shrewd in business that people thought his air of innocence could not possibly be real, but there was a sense in which it was, and thus he often fooled and foiled his adversaries. It was this innocence that had made him say, when introduced to Carey at the table: \"You played in Boston once when I was at Harvard--I can't remember the play, but I couldn't forget you.\" She had laughed, and somebody who had overheard said later that nobody had ever pinned an age on an actress more securely (though that had not been George's intention at all). But now, turning to him again more than halfway through the meal, she said: \"I think it must have been Quality Street you saw me in, Mr. Hare.\"\n\nGeorge was surprised she had even caught his name, and this was not modesty so much as an awareness that in a community where big names are a dime a dozen, some of the higher price tags are on the big-nameless.\n\nHe said: \"That's right, so it was.\"\n\n\"Because I don't believe I ever played in Boston in anything else. Not in those days.\"\n\n\"Not so very long ago,\" he commented gallantly.\n\n\"Twenty years.\"\n\nHe smiled. \"What does it feel like to be a well-known actress all that time and then have people behave out here as if they'd discovered you?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"It's funny.\"\n\n\"I hope you'll tell them that in your speech.\"\n\nShe seemed a little perturbed. \"Oh, do I have to make a speech?\"\n\n\"I'm sure we all hope you will. But it needn't be a long one. Do speeches make you nervous?\"\n\n\"Other people's do occasionally.\" He thought it was just a witticism till she added: \"Paul's especially, Paul Saffron--the director. He can be so tactless.\" She went on hastily: \"No, I'm not exactly scared to speak in public, but I find it much harder than acting. Perhaps that only means I find it hard to act the part of myself.\"\n\n\"Ethel Barrymore once told me practically the same thing.\" He proceeded to compliment her on Morning Journey, her first picture and such a success, and she thanked him with a genuine pleasure that lit her face like a girl's, but with life rather than mere youthfulness. George wondered (as one always must with an actress) whether the transfigurement was natural or a practised artifice; frankly he could not judge, and admiringly he did not care--it was quite remarkable either way.\n\n\"Of course you won't go back to the stage again,\" he said, and continued: \"I say that because I hope you will.\"\n\n\"I might.\"\n\n\"But first, I suppose, another picture?\"\n\n\"No, I've no plans for that. I've no definite plans for anything, except perhaps a vacation in Ireland.... By the way, Mr. Hare, you're the lawyer, aren't you?\"\n\n\"The lawyer? Let's settle for a lawyer.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you could help me.\"\n\n\"Of course. Trouble of some kind?\"\n\nHe guessed she must have some other lawyer or lawyers somewhere, together with the usual outfit of agents, business managers, tax consultants, and so on; he knew also how impulsively actors get themselves into a mess and how capriciously they can turn on those whom they pay to get them out. Maybe she was in a mood for such a change. He himself had tried to winnow down his clientele into those who were his personal friends and who, if they did get into trouble, would give him the pleasure as well as the task of extrication. He wondered if he would want Carey Arundel as such a client, even if she asked him. Possibly.\n\nShe was answering his question: \"Oh, nothing very important. I just thought of subletting my apartment while I go to Ireland, but the lease says I can't.\"\n\nGeorge might well have replied that if the lease said she couldn't, then very probably she couldn't; or he might have tactfully conveyed that he was a busy and expensive lawyer and that any financial advantage of subtenancy could easily turn out to be less than his fees if she got into any trouble over it. But simply because he continued to like the look of her, and also the sound of her voice, he said instead: \"Be glad to help you. Send--or better still bring--the lease along to my office and I'll see if anything can be done.\" The chairman was pounding his gavel for silence so he hastened to add: \"Any time. Tomorrow morning if you like.\"\n\n\"Thanks. Tomorrow morning then,\" she said hurriedly, fixing her face for the degree of attention that was appropriate in one about to be honored.\n\nThe chairman made a very dull speech about the significance of motion pictures in the national life, and during the applause that followed George said: \"Are you by any chance going on to the Fulton-Griffins' when this thing is over?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think so. I was asked, but I understand there's such a crowd always there and I hate crowds.\"\n\n\"So do I, but a Fulton-Griffin party is something you ought to see if you haven't been to one before. I thought if you were going I'd have a chance to talk to you without all these interruptions.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I'd like that, but I really think I ought to go home. I've been rather tired since the picture finished and----\"\n\nThe chairman was introducing the next speaker, a local politician who would present the awards. He was her neighbor on the other side, so the mechanics of it would be simple. But he talked too long, though he was easier to listen to and told a few mildly amusing stories. Presently he veered his remarks in her direction and announced her as the winner of the actress award.\n\nGeorge applauded with more than his usual fervor when she accepted the plaque. Then she made a short but charming speech in which there was no discernible trace of nervousness at all. He wondered if it were concealed, or whether she had made a habit of telling people about it in advance and then surprising them. George, however, was not surprised. He had seen tricks like that before, and had sometimes practised them in court with much success. But he admired the total effect of her performance and was more than sincere in his whispered \"Bravo\" when she sat down. \"You did very well,\" he commented.\n\n\"Did I? Who's next? Is it Greg?\"\n\nIt was Greg. He was a handsome fellow invariably cast for heroic parts; not a great actor, not even in his own estimation. Sufficient that in a few ill-chosen sentences he could mumble thanks and work off a labored gag about golf, which was his passion and pastime; any eloquence, even too much coherence, would have been almost disconcerting from such a source.\n\nThen the director's award to Paul Saffron. For some reason Saffron was seated far down the table and had to come forward to a microphone; as he did so George studied him with curiosity, chiefly because of Carey's remark that his speeches were apt to make her nervous. George wondered how many of them she had been forced to hear. Saffron was certainly a personality: his face large and jowly, the expression that of a man facing limitless challenge; there was a certain splendor, though, in the contour of cheeks and forehead, caprice in the waving wispy hair, something of a Pan-like sparkle in the small blue-gray eyes. George wondered if he had drunk too much; a few minutes later he was beginning to wonder what else could be the matter with the man.\n\nFor it was, by and large, the most deplorable exhibition George could remember. Saffron, in a strident staccato that would have been loud enough even without a microphone, began by telling the donors of the award that he considered their choice a bad one. At first some of the audience thought this must be a joke, but he glared them down and went on to state categorically that Morning Journey was the worst picture he had ever made. \"Of course an artist gets used to being praised for all the wrong reasons--he's lucky to be praised at all--and in my own case I can boast that my best work was never praised, it was never even finished--they wouldn't allow me to finish it.\" (He didn't say who \"they\" were, but by this time it was abundantly clear that he was not cracking jokes.) \"As for Morning Journey, I have this to say, and as an artist I must say it, that the picture you have so extravagantly praised and undeservedly honored is a product of the gigantic factory that does for entertainment what Henry Ford has done for automobiles. A competent picture--oh yes. A clever picture--perhaps. But a great picture?... Oh dear no, let us save that word for some occasion when it might possibly be needed--even here. Because it has been needed here--in earlier days. Griffith could have claimed the word--and Chaplin--perhaps a few others whose names are less well known, perhaps a few whose names are by now completely forgotten....\"\n\nGeorge shared the general discomfort with which all this was received. It was not that he specially disagreed: he had no great opinion of Hollywood and all it stood for; to him it was a place to earn a living, a place also in which he had found friends. A few of Saffron's remarks he would not have disputed at all--for instance: \"This place is full of craftsmen who might have been artists if only they'd stayed away.\" That, in a magazine article, might have been worth saying and quotable; on an occasion such as this it seemed merely graceless. There was, indeed, an appalling disregard of the feelings of others in the whole spectacle, and George, who considered manners more important than sincerity on many of the occasions of life, felt as if his mental well-being were being sandpapered. When, he speculated, does such an irritant make one get up and punch somebody on the nose? Then he chanced to catch Carey's face and saw in it a disturbance so extreme that his own indignation sharpened. By that time Saffron had abruptly finished; with the plaque in his hand, he had not even said thank you.\n\nThere was perhaps as little applause as a speaker could ever receive without being actually booed or hissed; the chairman rose and, bore though he was, eased the situation and won a grateful laugh by saying: \"I think, Mr. Saffron, we must all feel that you are a better maker of pictures than a judge of them.\"\n\nThe affair broke up very quickly after that, many showing an embarrassed eagerness to escape. Held in conversation with his other neighbor, George was presently aware that Carey had left the table without a sign or a good night. As he mingled with the departing crowd, he caught sight of Randolph, the producer of Morning Journey. Randolph, whom he knew fairly well, was in consternation; all he could mutter was: \"What got into that guy? Is he crazy? You saw the press taking it all down--they loved it--I suppose that's what he's after--what else could he be after?\"\n\nGeorge thought it pathetic that Randolph should not even contemplate the possibility that Saffron, however nastily, had been actuated by a desire to tell what he believed to be the truth. One need not, of course, think of such a thing nine times out of ten, but it was foolish to deny that it could conceivably happen. All of which, however, George wisely kept to himself.\n\nSuddenly voices upraised near the exit revealed the by now unmistakable element of Saffron's, his high-pitched tenor, involved in an argument. \"Of course she's an artist,\" he was shouting. \"Not a supreme artist, I grant you, but----\"\n\n\"What d'you mean?\" someone interrupted. \"Are you talking like God, or just jealous of her success?\"\n\n\"I'm proud of her success. It was always my ambition----\"\n\n\"So you take all the credit?\"\n\nGeorge was near enough now to recognize the other man as a young journalist named Hazelton who wrote movie criticism for one of the local papers.\n\n\"I take much of the credit,\" Saffron was retorting, \"because I know she needs someone else to bring out what she has, which is quite enchanting in its own way----\"\n\n\"Then how can you say she isn't a great artist?\"\n\n\"Supreme was the word I used.\"\n\n\"All right. Supreme. Maybe she isn't. Maybe she isn't even great. After your speech tonight we know how you feel about the word. But she's good--or do you deny that?\"\n\n\"Of course I don't, but you don't know how good she is. How could you? Are you an actor? Have you directed plays? Do you know anything about acting and the theater?\"\n\nThis was so brazen that it had to lead to either a fight or laughter. Hazelton chose to laugh. \"I won't argue that, Saffron, except to tell you I've seen her act when you had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"In what, may I ask?\"\n\nHazelton mentioned a Broadway comedy that had enjoyed a long run during the later years of the Second World War.\n\nSaffron snorted. \"Rubbish.\"\n\n\"But she was good in it.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did you see her?\"\n\n\"My friend, I had the misfortune to spend that period of my life in an internment camp in France while you were gadding about to New York theaters----\"\n\nHazelton laughed again. \"I happened to be on leave from the Pacific, but let that pass. The point is--and take my word for it--she was good in that play.\"\n\n\"And take my word for it she was best of all in Desdemona, before you were born, and as Candida in the Shaw play, and as Mrs. Vincent in a play called The Widow in the Forest which was a great hit when you must have been in knee pants----\"\n\n\"All of which, Saffron, by sheer coincidence you directed yourself?\"\n\n\"No coincidence at all. She's always best when I direct her.\"\n\n\"Ah--so now we know. She has to have you.\"\n\n\"Yes. And she knows it. She knows it better than anybody.\"\n\nHazelton moved away still laughing and Saffron completed his exit to the corridor. When he had gone Hazelton spotted George, whom he knew, and walked over to him. \"You heard all that? What a guy! What an evening! Well, it's something to write about, anyhow. The most exciting thing at a show like this since De Mille called the Chinese Ambassador a Jap--remember that?\"\n\nRandolph said: \"I suppose it's no good asking you boys to play it down. A packet of bad publicity for the whole industry....\"\n\nOf course it was no use. One might be able to buy a certain amount of good publicity spacewise, but the real news nuggets, the mishaps and misfires of the celebrated, were so precious that no paper could afford to let them go. By that reckoning a table brawl at Ciro's was always more important than the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n* * *\n\nGeorge went on to the Fulton-Griffins', where the party was already in full swing and where every new arrival from the Critics' Dinner was being asked what had really happened. George took pleasure in lowering the temperature. \"No,\" he kept on saying, \"there were no blows traded--nobody got hurt--it wasn't half as exciting as you think. Saffron made a silly speech, that's all.\"\n\n\"But he insulted Miss Arundel, didn't he?\"\n\n\"No. All he said was that Morning Journey was the worst picture he'd ever made, which by implication of course wasn't so very kind to----\"\n\n\"But didn't he say she was a bad actress and couldn't do a thing without him as director?\"\n\n\"That was afterwards--and anyhow, that wasn't what he said at all. As a matter of fact he defended her--he said she was enchanting----\"\n\nBut George knew that rumor could never be overtaken by fact. He broke off with a shrug: \"Ask someone else. I wasn't the only one there.\"\n\nBut he also knew that others who had been asked, or would be before the evening was out, were less trained than he in the reporting of evidence, as well as possibly less ethical. He edged away from the crowd and found his usual comfortable corner with a drink which he could make last a long time, and with enough people to enjoy talking to among those who would look for him. He kept thinking of Carey and wondering how soon the twists and exaggerations of what had happened would get to her ears. Several people he talked to mentioned her sympathetically; during the short time she had been on the Coast she seemed to have made herself generally liked. Saffron, by contrast, was in the special doghouse reserved for those whose unpopularity has somehow not deprived them of stature. Diagnosis of him veered from the surly genius to the psychopathic charlatan; anecdotes in proof or disproof were in steady supply as argument grew livelier. An actor who had had a small part in Morning Journey remembered that Miss Arundel had once quarreled bitterly with Saffron in one of the studio dressing rooms during the making of the picture.\n\nGeorge acquired for a moment his courtroom air. \"You heard this quarrel yourself?\"\n\n\"One of the prop men told me--seems it was the lunchtime when nobody else was around. He said Saffron had a gun and was threatening her with it.\"\n\n\"Why didn't the prop man do something?\"\n\n\"Aw, why should he get mixed up in what wasn't his business? That's what he said.\"\n\n\"Even if a man's threatening a woman with a gun?\"\n\n\"Apparently she wasn't hurt.\"\n\n\"And she didn't complain?\"\n\n\"I guess not.\"\n\n\"And they both went on with the picture after lunch as if nothing had happened?\"\n\n\"I know--it's hard to believe. But so was tonight hard to believe--unless you were there.\"\n\n\"But I was there. And already the whole thing's inflated out of all relation to the truth.\"\n\nBut again it was no use. George settled down to enjoying himself as a guest at a party; why work for nothing?\n\nTowards midnight someone brought him news which at first he could only think was another rumor--that Carey Arundel had actually arrived at the party. At that stage of the evening, with two or three hundred persons overflowing from a large house into floodlit gardens, the presence or absence of any individual was not easy to determine outside the range of sight, and George recollected that he was probably the only person to whom Carey's intention of not coming to the Fulton-Griffin party had been definitely stated only a few hours before. So he doubted the report until he saw her approaching him.\n\nThe first thing he noticed was an almost astonishing radiance about her, as if she had given herself some central glow to match the exterior lighting of beauty. She had also changed into another dress, much more startling than the one she had worn at the dinner; it had an austere simplicity of line that permitted a special drama of color and texture. George would say afterwards \"A sort of crimson velvet\" and leave it at that.\n\n\"Hello, Mr. Hare,\" she said smiling.\n\n\"Well, Miss Arundel, this is a surprise. You changed your mind?\"\n\n\"I often do.\"\n\n\"So we can finish our talk. That's good.\"\n\n\"Yes, but let's go outside. The gardens are lovely.\"\n\nHe led her through the French windows on to a terrace that stepped down to the swimming pool where a fair-sized crowd had congregated. He found a side path leading through a grove of eucalyptus trees.\n\n\"I felt I had to come,\" she said, \"just to show I don't feel all the things people are thinking I feel.\"\n\n\"You're very wise,\" he answered, taking her arm. \"What Saffron did say, as opposed to all the talk of what he said, wasn't really against you. Therefore there's nothing for you to be hurt or humiliated about.\"\n\n\"I'm so glad you think that.\"\n\n\"Just stupid of him and in bad taste.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, oh yes, I know it was.\"\n\n\"Rather odd--coming just after you'd told me his speeches sometimes made you nervous.\"\n\n\"Yes, wasn't it odd?\"\n\n\"You must have had a lot of experience of him.\"\n\nShe said quietly: \"Well, we were married once.\"\n\nHe could not conceal the measure of his surprise. \"You were?\"\n\n\"Didn't you know?\"\n\n\"I didn't, and as everybody else here must, it's rather astonishing nobody happened to mention it to me. I suppose they assumed I knew.\"\n\n\"So you've been talking about me to people?\"\n\n\"A few people have been talking about you to me.\"\n\n\"What do they say?\"\n\n\"They like you--and they don't like him.\"\n\n\"They don't have to couple us together any more.\"\n\n\"Except that you were in the picture together.\"\n\n\"Yes--for a special reason; but that's a long story--I might tell you sometime if you're interested.\"\n\nSome men and girls were approaching.\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow? Don't forget you have a date at my office. Make it eleven-thirty and I'll take you to lunch.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" And she added as they walked back towards the house: \"He didn't show up here tonight, did he?\"\n\n\"No. I'm sure I'd have known if he had. Did you think he might?\"\n\n\"He's capable of it. If he'd been here I'd have wanted to leave--I couldn't stand any more.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you.\"\n\n\"I'm just about at the limit of what I can stand, to be frank.\n\n\"You probably need that holiday in Ireland you talked about. But why Ireland?\"\n\n\"I was born there. Where were you born?\"\n\n\"Vermont... on a farm.\"\n\n\"So was I. In County Kildare. The greenest fields and my father rode the wildest and most beautiful horses....\" She paused as if some secret recollection had stolen her away; George watched her till she caught his look. She smiled embarrassedly. \"Oh, I guess we all feel that about where we were born. Vermont is beautiful too.\"\n\n\"Yes, very....\" The people who were approaching had voices he recognized; he said hastily: \"There's just time for one more question before the mob finds you again... a rather personal question, so don't be startled.... Did Saffron ever--in a dressing room at the studio while the picture was being made--did he ever quarrel with you and threaten you with a gun?\"\n\nShe looked amazed, then laughed. \"Good heavens, no. Who on earth made that one up?\"\n\n* * *\n\nThey separated inside the house and soon afterwards George left; it was already long past his usual bedtime. A few hours later (nine, to be exact) he was telling his secretary he would see Miss Arundel as soon as she arrived. But she did not arrive, and about noon he found out where she lived and telephoned. It was a fashionable apartment hotel and the desk informed him she was out. He thought she was probably on her way, but after a late lunch alone he was concerned enough to telephone Randolph at the studio. Randolph said she had not only not been there, but they had been trying for hours to find where she was and why she had broken an appointment to see some publicity people. It was not like her, Randolph said, to be either forgetful or unco-operative and already he was a little worried. \"The hotel people were cagey at first about what time she got home, but finally they said it was about one o'clock.\"\n\n\"Sounds reasonable. I left the Fulton-Griffins' soon after midnight and she was still there. She had a date to see me at eleven-thirty this morning.\"\n\n\"I didn't know she was one of your clients.\"\n\n\"She wasn't--till last night.\"\n\n\"Was it important business--or I suppose you can't tell me that?\"\n\nGeorge Hare was a highly successful lawyer for a number of reasons, one of which was that he never kept a secret that didn't matter.\n\n\"Of course I'll tell you--she wanted to know if she could sublet her apartment while she takes a vacation in Ireland. Hardly headline news, is it?\"\n\n\"Talking of headlines, what do you think of the Saffron thing?\"\n\n\"Been too busy to see the papers yet. Do they make much of it?\"\n\n\"You bet they do, and in some ways I'm glad they could tie it all into one story. Sort of takes the edge off what he said when the police found him drunk.\"\n\n\"I don't--quite--get you, Randolph. How do the police come into it?\"\n\n\"You mean you don't know what happened after he left the dinner?\"\n\n\"I told you I hadn't seen the papers.\"\n\n\"Well, read 'em, they'll give you the details. Not that there's much to it if it hadn't been him, but he was a fool to talk back to the cops. That's probably why they took him along. Of course as a studio we're not interested--so far as he's concerned we're through. But we don't like him upsetting her.\"\n\n\"Naturally. And from what she told me last night she's had enough of him to last a lifetime. By the way, how much of a lifetime did it last? Her marriage, I mean?\"\n\n\"To Saffron? Oh, that was all years ago.\"\n\n\"Did she never marry again?\"\n\n\"Sure, she's got a husband now--but they're supposed to be separating or separated. Millionaire banker, broker, something like that. New York.... The latest gossip links her with Greg Wilson.\"\n\nOh no, George thought in protest--not Greg Wilson. But then he realized what was behind the protest, and being skilled in self-diagnosis, he was astonished. For already he was aware of something quite unexampled in his experience. He liked women and had frequently thought he loved them, but never before had he been able to contemplate marriage. Now, quite suddenly, he was able. Not a desire, of course, just a pleasure in abstract thought. And it was absurd--after an hour or so of acquaintance and a few scraps of conversation. Yet it did not seem absurd, and that was what made it such an astonishment to him. He had not known he was capable of it.\n\nRandolph was waiting, so he said lightly: \"Sounds a little confusing, Randy.\"\n\n\"Did you ever know the life of an actress that wasn't? Not that Greg Wilson seems to me her type.\"\n\n\"Maybe she doesn't have a type. She isn't one, why should she have one? Well, call me up later if you get more news.\"\n\nGeorge then sent out for the morning papers and while they were coming he brushed aside the work on his desk and indulged in a daydream. He wondered if what she really sought from him was advice on matters more important than subletting an apartment--her marriage problem, maybe? Perhaps she wanted a divorce from the millionaire? George was an expert in getting divorces from (and for) millionaires. It would be exciting to be able to help her, to show off a little in doing so, to say in that calm casual way that had reassured so many clients during their first professional interview: \"Sure, we'll get what you want. Not a doubt of it. Just relax and don't worry....\"\n\nThe papers then arrived and he found the Saffron affair two-columned on the front page under the caption: \"Abuses Hollywood, Then Cops; Noted Director Makes Morning Journey to Jail.\" There was the usual photograph through prison bars, and the story had been written up in that style of deadpan glee which, by long experience, has proved most effective in making the fall of the mighty pleasurable to the masses.\n\nPaul Saffron, director of the hit picture Morning Journey, gave Hollywood a straight punch to the jaw in his speech at the Critics' Dinner last night... [Then a technically indisputable but thoroughly tendentious summary of what Saffron had said.] Unfortunately Mr. Saffron was just as mad with the police an hour later when they asked why he had bashed in the fenders of a parked car outside his apartment... [Etc. etc.]\n\nGeorge telephoned a few people who would know and found that the case, though trivial, would make further headlines if only because of Saffron's emphatic denials and generally truculent behavior in court that morning. But as he had admitted a few drinks at the dinner and been unable to pass a sobriety test, he might just as well have pleaded guilty from the outset. On the whole he was lucky to get off with a fifty-dollar fine.\n\nGeorge was working late at the office that evening and about ten o'clock Randolph called him again. \"Still missing, George, but a scrap more news. We finally got the hotel clerk to admit that she went out again about half an hour after checking in. She'd changed to street clothes and drove off in her car. Now where could she go alone at half-past one in the morning?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said George, beginning to chuckle because of the twinge of jealousy that made him catch his breath.\n\nRandolph ignored the frivolity. \"Well, it so happens we do know where she went, because the clerk eavesdropped on a phone call. You'd never guess.\"\n\n\"I probably wouldn't. Where was it?\"\n\n\"The Observatory on Mount Wilson. She called up somebody there and asked if she could look at the stars.\"\n\n\"Any proof that she did?\"\n\n\"Not yet, but someone's on his way there to find out. Have to tread carefully, we don't want the papers to make another sensation.\"\n\nAfter Randolph hung up George telephoned the Observatory. He wouldn't have been a good lawyer if he hadn't been able to ask a straight question without making it seem important. Within five minutes he was talking to a quiet-spoken man who said he was Professor Lingard and readily confirmed that Miss Arundel had indeed visited the Observatory the previous night. \"Anything wrong?\" asked the Professor.\n\n\"Not a thing,\" answered George. \"She just didn't keep an appointment for lunch, but she often does things like that--she's a little haywire about times and places. We just wondered what she was up to during the small hours, that's all. 'We' is her studio and I'm her lawyer.\" And he laughed as if the whole thing was just part of some goodhearted fun he was having.\n\nThe Professor did not attempt to share the fun, but he explained with great seriousness how it had all come about. He said that about one A.M. Miss Arundel had telephoned to ask if it were a right time for coming up to look at the sky. No, he didn't know her well, he had met her only once before, but they had talked about astronomy and he had invited her to visit the Observatory some suitable night. That night being one of the best, he had answered, Sure, come by all means. He himself was at work with his assistant, as always when weather conditions were thus favorable. She had reached the Observatory about two-thirty, and he had been slightly surprised that she was alone--she hadn't mentioned anyone else, but somehow he had assumed she would have company on the rather lonely drive to the mountaintop. They had spent perhaps an hour at the big telescope; she had then said she must go. He and his assistant had taken her to her car about a quarter to four.\n\n\"Did she say she was going straight home?\"\n\n\"I imagined she was. We talked about it being sunrise before she'd get there.\"\n\n\"So she's probably asleep still.... Well, thanks, Professor, it's been very kind of you.\"\n\nHe was just about to hang up when the Professor added, with a blandness that George thought remarkable: \"I suppose she never arrived home at all and you're looking for her? I'm afraid I can't help you much about that. She was wide awake when she left and certainly able to drive a car. I myself drove down the mountain about half an hour later and there was no sign of any accident.\"\n\n\"Did you expect one?\" George asked sharply.\n\n\"There's a dangerous part of the road where several cars have gone over in recent months.\"\n\n\"And you wondered about it enough to follow her and make sure?\"\n\n\"Yes... for some reason I can't quite explain... I did.\"\n\n\"That's a strange thing.\"\n\n\"It is, isn't it? But she was rather strange too. Behind a surface cheerfulness I'd have guessed her in acute distress of some kind.\"\n\n\"Look here, Professor, I think we ought to meet personally to talk about all this....\"\n\nThe Professor agreed, but before George could fix an appointment his secretary had entered with a typewritten message: \"Randolph's been trying to phone you again. He said it's important--about Miss Arundel.\"\n\nGeorge got rid of the Professor as best he could and then called Randolph, who said simply: \"She's gone off with Saffron. It'll be in the morning papers along with the drunk case. The real topper of toppers. Some paper up the coast just spotted them together in a hotel. Calls it an elopement. I daresay this means we're through with her as well--I don't know what else we can do. If only these people would realize we don't give a damn what their morals are provided they don't make trouble for us with 'em.... Personally, I can't understand it. Not only throwing away a career but for God's sake, what on earth can she see in Saffron? What on earth did she see? Don't suppose we'll ever get the whole truth about that.\"\n\n\"Do you ever expect to get the whole truth about anything?\" George asked, with all his lawyer's experience. But behind the hard-boiledness he felt a little sad. He was rather sure he would never meet another woman who would make him--even fleetingly--question the validity of his bachelorhood. He added: \"She must have had an interesting life, Randy. Born in Ireland, she told me--on a farm.... I wonder how she ever...\"\n\nBut there were so many things he wondered.\n\nPart One\n\nAt the convent school just outside Dublin, Carey had nourished ambitions to be either a nun or an actress; the nuns dissuaded her from the former, and her mother was equally against the latter. Mrs. Arundel, however, died when Carey was fifteen, and a year later, after a period of idleness at home, the girl managed to get a small part at the Abbey Theatre. It was in a bad play that lasted a week, and the sole press report that noticed her at all called her \"an interesting newcomer.\" But whatever she had or lacked, she was both eager and popular, so that during later seasons she was given a number of even smaller parts in other plays. She read all the books she could get hold of about acting and theatercraft, she studied plays and actors and tried to copy their tricks (some of which, at the Abbey, were among the neatest in the world), and occasionally she put into her lines a curious quality that riveted an audience's attention in the wrong place and made the director wrinkle his forehead in dismay.\n\nShe was a small girl, delicately featured, with a generous expressive mouth that twisted a little when she smiled, as if (a doctor admirer once said) she had once had a very slight attack of Bell's palsy and had only 99 per cent recovered. Dark hair and gray-blue eyes added to a total that might have taken no first prize in a beauty contest, yet might well have drawn more glances than the winner. Her figure, slow to develop, was still boyish at a time when her voice had already acquired a richness rare even in a mature woman; it was the most striking thing about her, this voice--low-pitched, never shrill, yet capable of catching the random ear as color catches the eye. (Much later, a critic said: \"Whenever she speaks, her voice gives a command performance,\" but \"command\" was not quite the word for a compulsion yielded to so happily. And another critic said, also much later: \"She has a quality of womanhood so ample, and in a peculiar way so purposeless, that the nerves of the critic unclench and even his judgment is off guard; for this reason she can often be overpraised, but never under-enjoyed.\") At school she had been a bright, gay, normal pupil, cleverer than the average, but no bluestocking. She liked horses, games, picnics. A ribald sense of humor had sometimes got her into scrapes, but never seriously; she had many friends and no enemies, and when she recited Portia's speech at the school's annual concert the nuns applauded affectionately, not thinking she was specially good (and she wasn't), but beguiled by her voice into a vision they found vicariously satisfying--that of wifehood and motherhood in the well-tempered Catholic life.\n\nThose years culminated in the period of the Sinn Fein \"troubles\"; by the time she made her first stage appearance the treaty with England had been signed and the Free State, precariously born, was already fighting for its life against the Republican Army. At the height of the fratricide Rory O'Connor and his men were shelled in the Four Courts (within a few streets of the Abbey Theatre), and many a night the city echoed to sporadic rooftop shooting. One of the lively areas was the neighborhood of the Portobello Bridge, which lay on a direct route between the theater and the southern suburb of Terenure, where Carey lived with her stepfather. Several times, along with other passengers, she flattened herself on the floor of a tram as it crossed the bridge during a fusillade, and whenever she could arrange it she drove home with an actress friend named Ursula, who had a very ancient car; they could then make long detours through safer districts. Sometimes also if there were shooting near the theater she would spend the night with another friend named Mona who lived in an apartment approachable by a sheltered route from the stage door itself. Since the Terenure house had no telephone, her stepfather could not be notified, but she had always urged him not to worry or stay up for her return.\n\nOften, though, when she got home late at night she found him still hard at work in the room which he called his study. He was learning Gaelic as an apt expression of his enthusiasm for the new Ireland, and perhaps as an aid to promotion in his job--he was an official in the Tax Department of the Dublin City Corporation. \"How was it out tonight?\" he would ask, as about the weather.\n\n\"Ursula heard there was something going on in Rathmines, so we drove around by Donnybrook. It wasn't so bad that way.\"\n\n\"Ah, I thought I heard something--I wouldn't have been surprised if you'd stayed all night with Mona again.... Rathmines, eh? Well, well, that's getting pretty close.\" His casualness was part of an English manner that many years in Ireland had not effaced and which, combined with short stature and a strutting walk, gave him an appearance which to Irish eyes was sometimes a little ridiculous. But he was a kindly man. \"You know, Carey, you can always give it up if the journeys make you nervous.\"\n\n\"Oh, but I love the work--I wouldn't know what to do with my life if I didn't have it to think about.\"\n\n\"Well, well, so long as it doesn't get you down. These are certainly great days in the history of our country. And of course there's not much real danger--to you girls, I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh no.\" Which was true--statistically. \"It's fun, in a way.\"\n\nBut this was not quite so true, for after the strain of a theater performance all one wanted to do was to go home quickly and get to bed; the effort to find a quiet route and the perhaps ten-thousand-to-one chance of stopping a stray bullet added no pleasurable thrills. \"At least I'm getting to know much more about Dublin, finding all these different ways home.\" It was a cheerful way to look at it, and the colorful topography of Dublin and suburbs--such names as Crumlin, Dolphin's Barn, Harold's Cross, Beggarsbush, Drumnagh, Rathfarnham--became the symbols of her almost nightly ordeals.\n\nOne rainy morning about two o'clock, as she and Ursula detoured through Ballsbridge, a man, hatless and trench-coated and pointing a gun, stepped into the dark street in front of the car. When Ursula braked hard, he jumped into the back seat and gave curt orders. \"Drive through Palmerston Park and towards Dundrum. Not too fast but don't slow down. Keep in the middle of the road. I'll tell you when to stop. And for your own sakes, no tricks.\"\n\nUrsula, panicked into silence, concentrated on the driving, but Carey was panicked into just the opposite. She began chattering and giggling for a reason she could not at first discover, but soon her nerves propelled her more and more surely into a pattern of behavior; she felt the kind of unspeakable terror she sometimes felt on the stage, but which she could always with an effort control, and which sometimes seemed to help rather than hinder her performance; and this too, she decided, must be a performance. So she fell into a rather broad and bawdy impersonation of a girl who had had too many drinks and was not particularly distressed at being kidnaped in the middle of the night by a forceful and handsome male. The man made no response. After a few miles there was a stretch of lonely country, and here he gave the order to stop; he then changed places with Ursula and took the wheel. Carey, sitting now beside him, kept her eyes on his stern profile and prayed that somehow, during the short interval of the drive to wherever they were bound for, she could talk herself and Ursula out of being raped, or even into being raped as a substitute for being murdered; maybe if she played up to him with all she had she could win him over. So she played. Actually the man was an exceptionally high-minded member of the Republican Army, burning with political zeal and puritanical to the point of primness. He had never even had a woman, much less raped one, and his only murders had been cold-blooded ones of men; on this occasion all he wanted was the car. Amidst empty moorland, where the climb began towards the Sally Gap, he brusquely ordered the two girls into the road, gave them a receipt for the commandeered vehicle (correct IRA procedure), and drove off with scarcely concealed contempt for a couple of prostitutes.\n\nCarey, indeed, had proved herself an effective actress, but her judgment had not been shrewd in her choice of the play. It was a combination that was to happen again in her life. The more immediate result, however, was a near collapse from the strain of the whole incident, for the two girls had to walk miles in the rain before they were picked up; they both caught bad chills. Furthermore, the theft of the car meant that from then on the problem of getting home from the theater would be much more burdensome. \"It's Ursula I'm really sorry for,\" Carey told her stepfather. \"The car wasn't insured and she hadn't finished paying for it.\"\n\n\"She should keep the receipt,\" he answered judicially. \"A truly independent Ireland has a responsibility in all such cases--I'm sure eventually it will realize that.\"\n\nDuring her next non-acting spell Carey visited her great-uncle in Kingstown. He had been her childhood hero, and as he lived in a district where there had never been any \"trouble,\" she could expect to relax more easily than at home. Captain Halloran (retired from the British Navy after a somewhat eccentric career) lived in a hillside house overlooking the harbor; he was seventy odd, keen-eyed, loganberry-red in countenance, with endearing qualities; he liked youngsters and animals, gave generously to the undeserving, and was a cheerful loser at Leopardstown races. Comfortably off, he kept a couple of horses which he galloped over the local countryside, or else hitched to a variety of two-wheeled vehicles that might well have been in a museum. Carey was driving one of these things on an August afternoon when she met Paul Saffron.\n\n* * *\n\nPaul was then twenty-nine, attractive in a slightly mannered way that sometimes suggested the feminine but never the effeminate; a little plump, with wavy black hair, intense blue-gray eyes, and a long strong nose, he was striking enough to be noticed in a crowd, and much more so on a quiet Irish road. Carey stared at him from some way off, and with growing apprehension, for he was hatless and wore a raincoat whose pockets bulged.\n\nIn truth the bulge on one side was from cigars, the other was from a rather conspicuous copy of the New York Times. The reason for this was that he wanted to be taken for an American before anyone could shoot him, and the reason he thought such a thing possible was that, being the kind of journalist as well as the kind of person he was, he thought anything possible. He had, in fact, just lately stepped down the gangway onto Irish soil with an almost conditioned reflex of naïveté, for he knew his job was to write something about Ireland that would be readable by those who were not really interested in Ireland at all. Somewhat to his carefully nurtured surprise there had been no ambush on the pier as the boat from Holyhead put in, so he had ignored the waiting train to Dublin and strolled inland through the first Irish streets he came to. It was often his luck to find things to write about thus casually--a dog or a child or a shop window or anything that met his eye. (One of his most successful pieces had been about a cat playing with a skein of wool in the ruins of an earthquake.) This time it was a girl, a girl driving a horse and some sort of a buggy along the road towards him, and he first noticed her because she was sitting on one leg in a way that looked uncomfortable. Now why? Or was it uncomfortable? Good enough for a start... Then he glanced at her face, which did not seem to him beautiful so much as appealing and piquant; it had a look that somehow complemented the question mark of the posture. Maybe a talk with such a chance-met native would save him the effort of walking further, for he disliked walking; so he stepped to the middle of the road in front of the cantering horse.\n\n\"Well?\" she said, before he could speak a word, and he caught then a quality in her voice that stirred him far more than anything in her looks. He did not guess that it was fear, and that she had not yet noticed his Times.\n\n\"Can you tell me where this road leads to?\" he asked.\n\n\"Just up in the hills.\"\n\n\"Ah, then I've lost my way. Are you driving into town? Could you give me a lift back?\"\n\n\"Sure. Jump up.\"\n\nShe had been too scared not to invite him, and he took her readiness for affability. This made him pleased with her, for he liked people to like him, and when he thought they specially did so he paid them the supreme compliment of talking about himself. He did this then, as they clop-clopped through the peaceful downhill streets; he told her who he was, of his recent arrival in Ireland, his mission to report on that disturbed country for an American magazine, his real ambition which was quite different, and the extreme likelihood that he would one day be famous. He talked to her, indeed, as he could always do to anyone (whether celebrity or bell hop) when he felt in the mood or thought it worth while--as if he had known and would continue to know them all his life, and as if neither his nor theirs could possibly have been complete before the meeting. It was a technique that had won him both friends and enemies, and would have perhaps worked out all right on balance if he had ever felt a need to discover who were which.\n\nCarey, on her part, was warming to the relief of finding him not another gunman, and the warmth put her at odds with herself for having been so mistaken. She listened to his chatter in a daze, unwilling to try her voice lest there might still be too much tremor in it. By the time they reached the center of the town she had said scarcely a word, and was already chagrined to find him so content with her silence. The looks she gave him were increasingly quizzical. \"Well, here we are,\" she said at length, pulling up at a corner.\n\n\"Already? This is as far as you go? Well, thanks. Very good of you. Can I get a streetcar from here into Dublin?\"\n\nStreetcar? \"Oh yes, of course. They stop over there.\" She pointed.\n\n\"Much obliged for the lift,\" he said, climbing down with caution. She noticed he was not very agile. \"It's a hot day,\" he added, mopping his forehead. \"How about having a cup of tea somewhere?\"\n\n\"And what would I do with the horse?\" She half-smiled, not so much to him as to herself about him. Maybe he thought a two-year-old would wait at the curb like a car--a city fellow, evidently (she was wrong about that, for he came from Iowa, but she was basically right, since he had always been peculiarly inept at country ways). Paul Saffron. He had told her his name but had shown no curiosity about hers, and that too had rankled, giving her a sudden defensive pride in being Irish, and in the duality of Irish life that made nobody either countrified or citified to an absurd extent.\n\nHe was still mopping his forehead. \"I wonder, then, is there a place I could get some ice-cold beer?\"\n\n\"Ice in Dunleary in the month of August?\" She shook her head at a rueful angle.... Paul Saffron. \"And besides, the pubs aren't open yet.\"\n\n\"I see. Like the English. I thought you were free of them now.\"\n\n\"Sure, but they had us so long we learned all their bad habits.\"\n\nHe grinned. (More for his article. Irish counterpart of the New York taxi driver--never at a loss for an answer.) \"You said some name just then that I didn't quite catch?\"\n\n\"Dunleary? It's the new name for Kingstown. Or rather the old name before our oppressors changed it. So we changed it back. It's spelled Dun Laoghaire.... And Dublin is Baile Atha Cliath.\"\n\n\"Tell me that again. How must I say it?\"\n\n\"Better not say it at all, or nobody'll know what you're talking about. It's a craze they have these days for turning everything into Gaelic. Dublin's still good enough for most people.\" She gave \"Dublin\" this time the caressing, almost Brooklynese vowels of the patois.\n\nHe looked as if the whole subject of place names and pronunciations were infinitely beyond his comprehension, for he had heard again that peculiar note in her voice that set him listening without taking in the words. It made him, from the sidewalk, give her a slow upward scrutiny and then put the question that had been in his mind from the first. \"What's the matter with your leg?\" For she was still sitting on it.\n\n\"'Tis broke,\" she answered.\n\nHer voice was so much in his ears that he didn't immediately show that he caught the joke; and this, it seemed, was an extra joke at his expense, for after a few full seconds of relish she drove off laughing.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen she got back to the house on the hill, she could not stop thinking about the American, for he had told her, amongst so much else, that though his current task was journalism, he had directed plays in New York and the real love of his life was the theater. Which would have been a natural cue for her to tell him about herself, but she had failed to do so, partly because she was still recovering from the initial shock of the meeting, but chiefly because his complete absorption in his own affairs had teased her to a more and more deliberate concealment of hers. She would not disclose anything that would interest him so much. Or would it? As soon as the doubt prevailed she wished she had told him. Fortunately it would be easy to let him know, since there were only three Dublin hotels at which he would be likely to stay.\n\nNeither could Paul, on the tram, stop thinking of her, and for a reason that flattered them both; he had already diagnosed what he called a histrionic personality. Not of course that it was specially rare; many types in all walks of life were apt to be so equipped (auctioneers, athletes, and the clergy, for instance); besides which, one often met the unlikeliest people who made their personal or professional world a stage and their own lives a continuous play. To be an actor, a real actor, much more was needed than any kind of personality; nevertheless, to have the right kind was a good start.\n\nBy midnight of that August evening he was already blaming himself for the incredible stupidity of not having inquired even the girl's name--how on earth could he trace her, even if he should want to? For it might well become a whim to do so, as casual as her own voice answering him about her leg. \"'Tis broke.\" It was the way he would have liked her to say it if it had been a line in a play.\n\nBy that same late evening Carey was writing three identical notes addressed to Mr. Paul Saffron at the Gresham, the Shelbourne, and the Hibernian hotels. She wrote that since he had stressed so much his interest in the theater, doubtless he would like to visit the famous one in Dublin, so she would leave a couple of tickets for next week's opening night for him to pick up at the box-office in Middle Abbey Street. She signed herself \"Carey Arundel,\" but she still left it to him to discover, if and when he cared to, what she was.\n\n* * *\n\nHe was not, as it happened, staying at any of the three hotels, but at a private house called Venton League, the home of a rich brewer whom he had met at a party in London, and who had promptly extended the invitation on learning of his Irish visit. Brewing, one of the more historic trades, has almost escaped the stigma of being a trade at all, and its distinguished dynasties rank high and are considerably international; Michael Rowden, in his late fifties, was a fine fleur of the culture, a Rothschild of his line, with family connections well scattered across England, Europe, and America, and financial interlockings from Milwaukee to Dortmund. Had he been a younger son he might have made an excellent diplomat, bishop, or even cardinal (for he was both a Catholic and a bachelor); as it was, he sold beer (with an inverted snobbery that made him thus describe his business), drank wine, collected French Impressionist paintings, and found ample time to cultivate the habits of a gentleman-savant. Temperament and wealth insulated him from most of the troubles of life, even from the Irish \"troubles,\" for neither side wished to drive into exile a man so eminently taxable. The hotheads had once put Venton League on their list of large houses to be burned, but Rowden had let it be known that he didn't much care; its destruction would spare him the eventual problem of whether to demolish it for villa development or bequeath it to Holy Church for some institutional use. And there really was a sense in which he did not care; he would be quite happy, if he had to be, in London or Palm Beach or Capri. Yet Venton League did, for all that, give him a special sort of satisfaction; it was the house of his ancestors, as far back as four generations, and family pride well-tempered with cynicism about it was strong in him. Moreover, since this was Dublin and not any other place in the world, there was a uniqueness in the kind of life he could live there--an eighteenth-century quality marvelously and miraculously preserved into the fabric of the twentieth. Leisurely elegance, half urban and half arcadian, part scholarly, part merely sophisticated, gave a ripeness even to anachronism; the kitchens were monstrous and old-fashioned, yet the bathrooms combined the luxuries of ancient Rome and modern America; the library windows offered a view of formal gardens backgrounded by green mountains, yet at the end of the half-mile carriage drive, and just outside the lodge gates, the threepenny tram started for the Pillar in O'Connell Street. All this suited him and immensely intrigued his constant succession of house guests. For as a suave Maecenas to young men of promise he performed a function all the more admirable because he took so much pleasure in it; at Venton League there was always apt to be some visiting painter, writer, musician, or even tennis champion, and the language at dinner was almost as often French or Italian as English. Rowden had not needed much acquaintance with Paul at that London party to decide that he would make an apt recruit, both culturally and racially, to the Venton League ménage--a young American with literary and theatrical connections... good... he could stay as long as he liked.\n\nPaul, compared with all this, was brash; he had met American millionaires, and even American millionaire brewers, but they had not been in the least like Rowden. To that extent he was secretly baffled, but he gave Rowden the usual treatment of brilliant talk and affable self-display, hopeful though by no means sure that the man was being impressed. One evening wine unleashed his tongue to such vainglory that Rowden smiled and put his hand under the youth's arm as they walked into the library for coffee and cognac; Paul by that time was in the midst of a survey of all the grandiose theatrical ideas that had ever effervesced in his mind, one of which he had just thought of suddenly at the dining table and which lifted him to a peak of excitement the more he enlarged upon it--Othello with an all-Negro cast, except for Othello himself, who should be white. Into a rare and breathless silence Rowden then managed to interject: \"My dear young man, I admire your enthusiasms and I think it quite possible you are almost as wonderful as you say. But tell me... how are you going to live in this world?\"\n\n\"Live?\"\n\n\"Yes. Make a living.\"\n\n\"You mean money? Oh, I manage. I pick up a bit from journalism, and then I have a traveling fellowship--rather a juicy one--it's supposed to enable me to do 'creative writing,' whatever that means; but there's no problem, because if the worst comes to the worst I'll bundle some of my articles together and call 'em creative--who the hell can swear they aren't?\"\n\n\"You, of course, know that they aren't.\"\n\n\"Oh, sure. I'm not really a writer. I've got creativeness in me, but it's not that kind.... But don't worry--I'll get by. The fellowship's a racket, but it helps me around--they might even renew it for another year. And sometimes I meet rich people who save me hotel bills.\"\n\nRowden was at first antagonized by what he took to be boorishness; but then, beneath it, he caught other notes--frustration, ambition, cool self-criticism, and a sort of celestial you-be-damnedness. On the whole he was beginning to like Paul very much indeed.\n\nPaul added, with a grin: \"I'm only kidding. If you think I'd stay here just for that you don't know me. I'm really grateful to you. But it isn't all on one side, is it? I'd have been worth my keep in the old days when artists had patrons. Then you could have built a theater for me and I'd have made you famous.\"\n\n\"Quite a proposition.\"\n\n\"I'm still kidding. You must think I have a nerve.\"\n\n\"I do.\" Rowden smiled and continued: \"Do you write as you talk?\"\n\n\"God, no. I wouldn't sell much if I did. I'm a sort of actor in print. I've created a fictional character that I call Myself, so I never write what I think, but what I think this character would think. The novelist does that all the time, but he does it honestly--he labels it fiction, but I pretend I really am the slightly ridiculous fellow I've invented.\"\n\nRowden eyed him critically, as if wondering how much of all this to suspect or discount. \"Isn't it rather confusing at times?\"\n\n\"Sure, though of course it's nothing new--the public always tend to identify an actor with his part.\"\n\n\"Not the educated public?\"\n\n\"Yes, to some extent. Or else why would the man who plays Jesus in the Oberammergau Passion Play have to quit smoking and drinking?\"\n\n\"I didn't know that he did. Tell me, how did you launch yourself into this rather strange journalistic career?\"\n\n\"Ah, that's a story in itself.\"\n\nHe told it, but he didn't tell the whole truth about it, which was as follows. He had been in England just after the 1918 Armistice, awaiting the voyage home and demobilization. His war service had comprised a year in an Army office in London. The reason he had not been sent to fight was a pituitary condition which made him put on weight with alarming ease; without proper dieting or treatment, he was at that time in danger of becoming almost comically fat. (Back home as a civilian, a year later, he took medical advice, lost most of the excess poundage, and managed after that to remain merely stoutish.) It happened that during the early days of 1919 Mr. Lloyd George was to leave for the opening of the Peace Conference in Paris, and reporters were badgering him in vain for a scoop. In such circumstances one would have thought it sheerly ridiculous for Paul to seek an interview with the great man for an American small-town paper; and so it was, yet he succeeded. He simply sent a letter on United States Army notepaper and enclosed a photograph. \"You will see from this,\" he wrote, \"the sort of fellow I am--I certainly carry a lot of weight around here, but it isn't the kind that helps. In fact, Mr. Lloyd George, I'm just a Yank without rank who'd be proud indeed to shake hands with you before I go home to Reedsville, Iowa.\" Perhaps the P.M. was seduced, or amused, or merely obliging; it is even possible that he practised the same mixture of innocence and guile, for he had never been unmindful of the value of American publicity. At any rate, Private Paul Saffron was invited to call at Number Ten Downing Street at four-thirty one January afternoon. Of course there was no political scoop, they didn't talk about politics or the war at all, but they did discuss America, England, Wales, tea, coffee, the beauties of nature, and choral singing; moreover Paul, who had a rather pleasing bel canto tenor, was able to demonstrate that a lament of the Seminole Indians was remarkably similar to a hymn tune popular among the slate miners of Blenau Festiniog. Amidst these amenities half an hour passed, and then an hour, whereupon Mrs. Lloyd George joined them and Paul had to sing again. It was all very neighborly, more like Iowa than London's West End--which, of course, was exactly the point that Paul made in the two-column piece he wrote. And the whole article, which was picked up by some of the big newspapers after its debut in the Reedsville Clarion, proved something else too--that America was much more interested in a number of other things than in war and politics.\n\nAfter this flash-in-the-pan success, Paul felt he had it in him to earn a living from journalism if he had to, though he hoped he wouldn't, for his passionate leanings had already centered themselves elsewhere. But an editor named Merryweather had become interested in him and was shrewd enough to realize that while magazines and newspapers were full of stuff emanating from informed sources, the uninformed source, the fall guy who steps in where experts fear to tread, could be equally readable in a small corner of his own. (Later the technique was developed into one of the humaner and more profitable arts by Will Rogers and later still by Ernie Pyle.) It was the pose of having no pose--the trick of telling the public, in reporting a war, how scared one was, or of an international conference, how bored.\n\n\"I'm the Little Man,\" Paul said, gulping Rowden's brandy to give himself the right feeling about it. \"I'm the world's hero because I'm not a hero--I'm Constant Reader, Pro Bono Publico, Worried Taxpayer, Average Citizen--I write as if writing's easy, unprofessional, no particular talent required, just a few pipes of tobacco and a sort of cute way of looking at things.... I'm low-brow and I'm human--my God, how human I am--when I did a piece about my dog's birthday I got over five hundred letters and a truckload of dog food from readers.... Did that ever happen to Shakespeare?... And I haven't got a dog, I don't smoke a pipe, and I think I'd loathe the fellow I pretend to be if ever I met him. One of these days, when I've made a big hit with a play, I'm going to lose all my public in one grand gesture--I shall confess that all the time I've been secretly enjoying Beethoven quartets.... Only I'm afraid the editor wouldn't publish it, he wouldn't let me destroy my humble little Frankenstein, God's wide-eyed Mite, always on the watch for the Funny Side of Things, bless his tiny guts.... And finding it too. My first article on Ireland--you'd never guess how I'll start it--nothing about the Free State, or Cosgrave, or the shooting--leave that to the regular writers--I'll do a piece about a girl--I met her just after I came ashore at Kingstown, Dunleary, whatever you call the place--I took a walk in the town and saw this girl driving a horse and buggy and she was sitting with one leg bent under her... the oddest thing... like this....\" He got up from the chair and reseated himself with his own leg clumsily imitating the posture. He was aware by then that he had drunk too much.\n\nRowden said: \"Charming, I'm sure. Some more brandy? No?... But coming back to the stage... of course you know about our own Abbey Theatre? Maybe we should go one evening while you're here....\"\n\n* * *\n\nThey went to the Abbey to see a new play called Moon of the Galtees, by a new Irish writer whom some of the critics had praised. It was typical of Rowden that he did not choose the opening night, that he bought seats in the third row, and that he took Paul to the city by tram. The chauffeur and Rolls-Royce would pick them up afterwards.\n\nPaul was naturally astonished when he recognized Carey on the stage, as of course he did immediately, despite her part as a rather minor leprechaun. (It was that kind of play.) His desire to see her again revived and expanded, during the first act, into all kinds of agreeable expectations. At the interval he told Rowden excitedly that here was an amazing coincidence, that leprechaun was actually the girl at Kingstown, the one he intended to write about! Perhaps they could go backstage after the show? But Rowden, at first vaguely assenting, then demurred. \"I'm afraid it'll be rather hot and noisy--if you'd like to meet Barry Fitzgerald and Arthur Shields I can have them to dinner at the house some evening. I know them fairly well. Yes, that's quite an idea. Yeats, too--you must meet him--he's usually here, but I don't see him tonight. And perhaps Lennox Robinson and Dr. Starkie and A.E.... We have a genuine intelligentsia--just the people you'll enjoy meeting.\"\n\n\"But I'd like to see that girl.\"\n\n\"The little girl?\"\n\n\"Sure. The leprechaun. After meeting her the way I did it would be amusing----\"\n\n\"I'd preserve my illusions if I were you. The article might work out better.\"\n\n\"I wasn't thinking of the article.\"\n\n\"You like her acting then?\"\n\n\"Hell, no.\" He added hastily: \"I mean, she's not good for the part, the part's not good, she seems to be untrained, or else badly trained, or something.\"\n\nRowden smiled. \"It would be hard to make conversation then. Why don't you write your little friend a note? And I'll try to fix our party for next Sunday--that's always a good day.\"\n\nSo they didn't go backstage, but Paul left a scribbled message for delivery to her after the show, and the next day he sent flowers. He wasn't the kind of person who sent flowers to girls and he was rather surprised at himself for thinking of it.\n\nShe wrote back: \"Thank you for the roses. I love roses, and everybody wondered who they were from. I didn't see you in the audience, but I'd half expected you on opening night, because I'd left tickets for you at the box-office. I'd written to you about that at three hotels, I never thought you'd be staying anywhere else. All this sounds complicated, I'll explain when we meet. You don't say if you liked the play. Tomorrow will do fine--say two-thirty at the Pillar.\"\n\nThe Pillar was the Nelson Pillar, stuck squarely and squatly astride the great width of O'Connell Street. Buildings on both sides had been destroyed in the 'sixteen rebellion, but the Pillar had escaped except for bullet nicks; it dominated the scene, providing a terminal point for tram routes and a lofty monument to an Englishman whose public and private life made his memory a constantly delightful anachronism in the streets of Dublin. So Rowden had remarked to Paul, and it proved a good way to start a conversation when he met the girl, for he was unaccountably nervous at first. He had been late at the rendezvous owing to delay in getting away from Venton League after lunch, for he had not told Rowden he was going to meet the girl. He had even wondered if she would wait when he did not arrive; the first thing he must do was to apologize. But he forgot all about that when he saw her, and as she did not mention it, the fact that she had been standing for half an hour amidst the scurrying crowd vanished for both of them as if it had never existed. She wore a blue dress and the kind of pert cloche hat that was in style in those days and happened to suit her; she came towards him smiling, having seen him first, a few anxious seconds first, for after leaving a taxi to cross the road he had nearly been run down by a tram whose driver gave him some picturesque language in passing. \"I keep forgetting you keep to the left in this country,\" were his first breathless words of greeting.\n\n\"I know, I saw it,\" she said. \"But there's terrible traffic here all the time. The Pillar gets in the way of everything.\"\n\nWhich led him to repeat Rowden's remark about it, and she too found the subject helpful to begin with; she told him how the City Corporation had considered moving the Pillar (as a traffic hazard, so as to dodge the political issue), but so far nothing had been done because it would cost too much.\n\n\"At least they could change the statue on the top,\" Paul said. \"Why not some Irish hero?\"\n\n\"Och, there mightn't be time. Before we could hoist him up there, somebody would have shot him as a traitor and half the country wouldn't think him a hero at all. That's what happened to Michael Collins.\"\n\n\"That's almost what happened to Lincoln.\"\n\n\"It's a curse on all of us then. The English don't do things like that.\"\n\n\"They do as bad.\" He laughed. \"Come now, don't say you're on their side.\"\n\n\"My stepfather's English. I wish there weren't any sides.\"\n\n\"Ah, then that accounts for it. He's the one that keeps you broadminded.\"\n\n\"Not him--he's more Irish than some of the Irish. Spells his name S-e-a-n instead of James and it's pronounced 'Shawn.'\"\n\n\"Then I give up. This is a strange country.\"\n\n\"You can't give up if you've got to write about us.\"\n\n\"I shan't touch on politics much.\"\n\n\"No?... Perhaps that's sensible. But don't romanticize, whatever you do--none of the Killarney-blarney, broth of a boy, top o' the marnin' to ye--that's the stuff we can't stand.\"\n\nWhen he reflected that this was the kind of article Merryweather would probably like, he almost blushed. \"Maybe you'd rather be laughed at? I could do an amusing piece about those Gaelic changes you talked about.\"\n\n\"Why not, then? It's a good subject. The ancient tongue of Ireland that nobody speaks any more except a handful of peasants in the far west, so there have to be a handful of professors in Dublin to decide what the ancient Irish would have called a telephone if they'd ever seen one.\"\n\n\"If I wrote that way it would seem like an attack.\"\n\n\"And why not? 'Tis time someone attacked us in fun instead of seriously.\" She showed him the book under her arm. It was Martin Chuzzlewit, a library copy. \"I've just been reading this. Dickens certainly didn't spare the Americans. And it wasn't all fun either.\"\n\n\"D'you know, I've never read Chuzzlewit.\"\n\n\"Why don't you? I'll lend you this--I've finished it.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n\"It'll probably make you angry.\"\n\n\"I'll bet it won't. My family hadn't come to America when it was written, so why would I feel insulted? I'll tell you what I think when I've read it.\"\n\nThey went on talking, as vagrantly as that, while they skirted the quays past the burned-out Four Courts and entered Phoenix Park. It was windy on the upland there, with fast scudding clouds and a hint of rain. The view of mountains reminded him of a backdrop, gray-blue shapes as if cut in cardboard. He told her this, and it gave her the cue to remark that he still hadn't said how he liked the play.\n\n\"Oh, that? Well, it wasn't bad. In some ways it wasn't bad enough. You know when a play is really bad, anything good in it shows like a sort of outcropping. Take Twelfth Night----\"\n\nHe wondered if the notion that a Shakespeare play could be called bad would shock her, and he had used the example chiefly to find out. But she seemed unconcerned. Or perhaps she had read Shaw. Or more likely still, her mind was anchored to the main issue, for she went on: \"So you didn't like Moon of the Galtees? Och, nor did anybody. They're taking it off.... And I don't suppose you liked me in it either.\"\n\n\"It wasn't much of a part for you, was it?\"\n\nShe grimaced. \"As good as I generally get. I try to believe it's because they think I'm too young.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Seventeen. Nearly eighteen.\"\n\n\"I'd have guessed you nearer twenty.\"\n\n\"I feel like twenty. And I dress to look older, but none of it seems to work. There's a fourteen-year-old part in a new play they're considering--I'll bet they offer it to me.\"\n\n\"Juliet was fourteen.\"\n\n\"Ah, now, if only I could have a chance like that!\"\n\n\"Would you take it?\"\n\n\"Who wouldn't? Or is it absurd of me to be so ambitious? Maybe I should stick to leprechauns?\"\n\n\"Leprechauns or Juliet--it's all acting.\"\n\n\"I know. And you haven't yet told me how--if--you liked my acting.\"\n\n\"You really want me to?\"\n\n\"Sure. I can bear it.\"\n\nHe said judicially after a pause: \"I don't think you know how to act, but I think you have something--I don't quite know what--but it's something you'd be lucky to have as well, even if you did know how to act.\"\n\n\"All I have to do, then, is to learn?\"\n\n\"Yes. And unlearn.\"\n\n\"Ah, I see.\"\n\nThe inflection he caught in her voice made him continue quickly: \"Remember, that's only my opinion.\" The words didn't sound like his, and he wondered how far the impulse to speak them could be identified as humility, truculence, or a simple desire to spare her feelings.\n\n\"It's what I asked for. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--but----\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"Well, what I mean is, don't let anybody's opinion worry you. Because worrying wouldn't help. And unless the person who criticizes has something constructive to say----\" He checked himself, aware of immense pitfalls.\n\nShe said musingly after a pause: \"I expect you're right--that I've everything to learn and unlearn.\"\n\n\"I didn't say everything. You weren't at a dramatic school?\"\n\n\"No. Is that what I need?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, I rather thought you had been to some school.\" He laughed. \"They teach a lot of the wrong things.\"\n\n\"Ah now, Mr. Saffron, am I as bad as that?\"\n\n\"My name's Paul, by the way. I wish you'd call me Paul.\"\n\n\"All right. Paul. And I don't know how to act, according to you. Maybe you think you could teach me?\"\n\n\"Heavens, no. I'm not a teacher. I can't act myself--I haven't the vaguest idea how it's done.\" Again he knew that this was an attitude-cliché, with just enough truth in it for guile. \"All I do--all I hope to do--is to... if I had to put it into a sentence... to... to communicate a sort of excitement.\" Well, that was true--fairly true, anyhow. \"If you challenge me to say I could do that with you, then I'll say it--I'd try to, anyhow.... I mean, if I were directing a play you were in.\"\n\n\"Excitement?\"\n\n\"Of course there's much more to it than just that--there's style and technique and a hundred other things. But the essential thing is the kindling of emotion in the actor--in his mind, in his voice, in his movements.\"\n\n\"Emotional excitement?\"\n\n\"Call it anything you like. Perhaps it's what Oscar Wilde meant when he said he felt in a mood to pick his teeth with the spire of a cathedral.\"\n\n\"He said that?\"\n\nHe nodded, amused at what he guessed--that to her Catholic mind the name was necessarily a symbol of wickedness. \"Are you surprised?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. But I'd never heard it before. It's a wonderful phrase.\"\n\n\"Wilde was one of the wittiest men who ever lived.\"\n\n\"I know. I've read his plays. Under the bedclothes with a flashlight.\" She caught his look and added: \"That was at school. They were strict about the books we got, but we used to smuggle them in. I also read De Profundis and The Ballad of Reading Gaol.\"\n\n\"You were interested in Wilde at that age?\"\n\n\"Oh yes--and my great-uncle often talked about him--still does. He knew him. They were at T.C.D. together.\" Again she intercepted the look. \"That's Trinity College, Dublin.\"\n\nHe gaped, a little enchanted by this strange Irish world in which there could be so much intimacy and innocence combined; for of all the reasons for being concerned about Wilde, surely the fact that one's great-uncle had been at college with him was unmatchable.\n\nShe broke into his reverie by saying: \"Did you ever have that feeling--that you could pick your teeth with the spire of a cathedral?\"\n\nThe answer that came to his mind (that he was enjoying such a sensation there and then) was too simple and astonishing to confess, so he said: \"Well, on a first night when you know the play's a hit you feel pretty good.\" (He had never had this experience.)\n\nShe nodded, more with encouragement than assent, and he went on feverishly: \"And sometimes also it happens at quieter moments--when you're alone or with just one other person... the heart suddenly beating a little faster, putting its private exclamation mark at the end of every thought.\"\n\n\"That's not a bad phrase either.\" (It was his own, but he had used it before in some article.) \"You could be Irish, the way the words come.\"\n\nHe laughed. \"A real Playboy of the Western World, with an American accent.\"\n\n\"Yes, and you ought to visit the West, by the way--our West--Kerry, Clare, Connemara....\"\n\n\"Perhaps I will when I've straightened out a few ideas about Ireland in general.\"\n\n\"Not too straight or they'll surely not be right. Remember we're a twisted people.\"\n\n\"And I'm a twisted man.\"\n\nShe said quietly: \"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing. A joke. Can't I joke too? But I am getting a feeling of this country and I think I do know what you mean when you call it twisted.\"\n\nIt was true that he was already aware of Ireland as an atmosphere--something at once garrulous and secretive, warmhearted yet slightly mocking, as if after a thousand years of insolubility a problem could become itself a kind of dark inscrutable answer. So far he had been in Dublin a week and had written not a line; all he had done was to sight-see, read newspapers, talk to everyone he met, hear a few shots in the distance, and go to the theater. Yet deeper than such surface contacts was something that came to him by the same channel that it could pass from him to others--a communication of excitement, as he had called it, so that, had Dublin been a play, he would have been aching to put it on the stage. There was a symmetry in the emotion that the city gave him, and his meeting with Carey seemed part of it.\n\nShe on her side was equally aware that she had never met anyone who interested her so much as Paul. As he went on talking she was sure he must realize how comparatively ignorant she was, yet at the same time she knew how little it mattered; she had wits to match his in the profound escapade which, at first, is every human relationship of consequence. Nor had she been really hurt by his telling her that she didn't know how to act, because she felt he would have been more polite if he had been less interested in her (though in that she was wrong); and, as the hours progressed till it was time to return to the streets, she passionately wanted to retain his interest, not only for its own sake, but for the strength she already felt she could draw from such a new thing in her life. For she alone knew how events during recent months had strained her nerve, had set up tensions that had kept her sleepless often till dawn, weakening even ambition, so that from the original \"I want to be a great actress\" that had kept her emotionally alive as a schoolgirl, she had caught herself lately in half-wistful clingings, as if the dream were becoming a prop instead of an urge. But suddenly, talking to Paul, she had felt the urge again.\n\nWhen he took her hand outside the theater he said he hoped it wasn't the last time they would see each other.\n\n\"Oh yes, I hope so too. When are you leaving?\"\n\n\"Don't know exactly. Depends on how soon I finish the job I'm here for.\" He smiled. \"Maybe I won't hurry.\"\n\n\"Fine. So we really ought to meet again.\"\n\nThey waited, each for the other; then he said, taking the plunge: \"What about tomorrow?\"\n\n\"Oh dear, there's a matinee on Saturdays. But you could come for tea at Mona's afterwards. She has a little flat just round the corner--I always go there between shows on matinee days.\"\n\n\"Who's Mona?\"\n\n\"My best friend. She was Pegeen in the play, if you remember.... Can you come?\"\n\nThere wouldn't be much time, between the end of a theater matinee and dinner at Venton League, but he made a note of the address and said he would be there.\n\n* * *\n\nAll evening and the next morning and afternoon he had the recurrent feeling that to have made such an appointment was a mistake; he wanted to see Carey again, but only alone; to meet her with her friend was pointless, for he so often did not get along with strangers, especially girls, and he had a gloomy foreboding that Mona would prove to be one or another kind of bore. Up to five o'clock he was in mind not to go, but then it began to rain, the soft Irish rain that seemed to caress the air even more than sunshine. The rooms of Venton League darkened as the clouds rolled over, yet only the house was melancholy; the rain tempted one out of doors into a luminous gray cheerfulness. He put on a mackintosh and walked down the drive, relishing the fragrance of lawns and shrubs. A tram was at the terminus outside the lodge gates; boarding it he climbed to the upper deck where the rain lashed the windows soundlessly. He rubbed a clear space on the pane and stared down at the glistening pavements and bobbing umbrella tops as the journey began. He tried to think what it was in Carey that so attracted him, something in her like a magnet to a compass needle, luring him into behavior that was out of character--or perhaps only out of the character he had hitherto decided was his own. In this sense his discovery of her was a discovery of himself, and he was puzzled as well as fascinated. Was it merely her voice that did such things to him, or her slight slanting smile, Mona Lisa among the leprechauns, or her face in quiet profile that was like the figurehead of a ship on a calm day? An actress? Yes, she had the makings of one in her. But the act that enticed him was that of her simple existence.\n\nHe left the tram at the Pillar and explored through the rain till he found the flat. A tall Regency house had been subdivided; the flat was on the third floor. He climbed with his heart pounding only partly from the physical exertion, but when Carey opened the door all his tension vanished as if a switch had been pulled. The first exchange of looks confirmed the ease she could give him, instantly, so that he even forgot about Mona. Then when she was taking his dripping hat and mackintosh she mentioned that Mona was out.\n\n\"I don't mind,\" he said wryly.\n\n\"Oh, but you'll find her interesting--you could get at least an article out of her.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"Irish legends--antiquities--old Dublin--she knows it all. This house, for instance, had quite a history before it came down in the world.\"\n\n\"I'd say that with you here it hasn't come down in the world at all.\"\n\nHe wasn't good at compliments, and this one sounded stilted and artificial. But she warmed it to life with her laughter. \"Oh, what a sweet thing to say. But it really was a grand house in the old days--it belonged to Lord Fitzhugh--the Catholic Fitzhughs. They were a wild eccentric family--one of them fought with Wolfe Tone, and another was always called the holy man because he----\"\n\n\"Are you a Catholic?\" he interrupted, brushing aside the Fitzhughs.\n\n\"Yes, but I'm not very holy.\"\n\n\"You mean religion doesn't matter much to you?\"\n\n\"Oh no, it matters a lot, but I'm just not conscious of it all the time. Like when you have a good digestion and you don't worry about what you eat.\"\n\n\"So you'd call a saint a fellow with a touch of spiritual indigestion?\"\n\n\"Ah now, you're laughing at me.\"\n\n\"I'm never quite sure when you're joking.\"\n\n\"Neither am I. That's the trouble sometimes.\"\n\n\"Oh? What trouble? When?\"\n\n\"Well... during the worst of the street fighting recently nobody would believe how scared I really was.\"\n\n\"I think I'd be scared too.\"\n\n\"But you probably wouldn't laugh about it as I did.\"\n\n\"No, I'd just run--very seriously.\"\n\n\"But you can't, when you're in a panic. It transfixes you. Perhaps you've never known panic.\"\n\nSo the subject was panic, he thought, with the kind of acceptance that comes in a dream. He had a wild idea to tell her about the panic he had indeed known, the secret panic that sprang from his ambition whenever he realized how time was passing and he was no nearer accomplishment, the rage that sometimes followed the panic, so that he said stupid brutal things that were often held against him forever. Panic--yes, he had felt it every birthday when he looked back on the year and reckoned his lack of advancement. Would she understand that if he tried to explain it? Would her own ambitions give her any inkling? He said gruffly: \"I've never been shot at except by life and that goes on all the time.\"\n\n\"Because you find battles everywhere, Paul... don't you?\"\n\n\"They are everywhere, except... a few moments... a few people... you, for instance.\" And saying that, in words so simple, even banal, gave him a comfort that was partly an immense laziness, so that he could relax the sinews of his spirit in her company and let come what might in either words or actions.\n\nShe exclaimed: \"Oh, I'm so glad about that. I wondered if you'd ever want to see me again after yesterday.\"\n\n\"Why on earth shouldn't I?\"\n\n\"I'm not as clever as you. I don't know very much. I thought you were just trying to get material out of me for an article.\"\n\n\"Good heavens, do you think I'm always using people?\"\n\n\"I wouldn't blame you if you were. You're a writer--an artist. It's justified by the results.\"\n\n\"You really think it is in my case?\"\n\nAnd again the impulse overwhelmed him to tell her, of all things, the truth; to confess it as she would doubtless confess to a priest. He could begin, at least, by admitting that all his boasts and brashness were to cover an almost complete lack of success in anything he had really wanted to do so far; he could say that the articles he had the trick of writing were always trivial and sometimes contemptible, that he had had long spells of fruitless striving and agonized self-disgust, that he was still practically unknown on Broadway despite his poses and pretensions abroad, that he had directed only two plays in his entire life, both of them at an experimental theater in a New York suburb; that neither had attracted attention or been popular; and that even these meager achievements had taken place several years before, since when he had been unable to persuade anyone else to give him a third chance. All this he could tell her, and then, perhaps, could follow even other truths....\n\nHe said: \"Listen... you've been so kind, so... so friendly and... and sympathetic... I don't want you to get any wrong ideas about me.... Oh God, don't answer it--they'll call again if it's anything important... let it ring, let it ring....\"\n\nBut it wasn't the telephone, for the flat possessed none. Carey hesitated, but there was clearly nothing else she could do but admit Mona. Nervously effusive, devoured by curiosity, Mona was also maddeningly discreet in the way she had forborne to use her key.\n\nPaul froze instantly, became glum, and soon got up to go. The fact that it was Mona's flat did not prevent him from regarding her as a complete intruder. Carey took him downstairs. They said nothing till they were in the hallway and could see out into the street. The rain had stopped and a watery sunlight glinted on the wet pavements. They were both aware of things unsaid that might never be said on any other occasion. She touched his arm and whispered: \"Oh, Paul, I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry too, if I was rude, but I was just getting in a mood to talk--I mean, really talk.\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"I wonder if you do know.\"\n\nShe made no answer to that, but presently said: \"We can meet again. Do you like the country--I mean, getting out of the city--mountains--scenery?\"\n\nHe didn't, but he rallied himself to give a grudging assent.\n\n\"We might go to Glendalough, if you have a day to spare, or even half a day. I could borrow Mona's car--it's terribly old and shabby, but it runs. There's the lake and the famous Round Tower--might be something else for one of your articles.\"\n\n\"Oh, damn the articles. I'd like to go, though, but when?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know how busy you are----\"\n\n\"Sunday's your best day, isn't it? What about this Sunday?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow? Again tomorrow? Oh yes, if I can get the car. Do you mind if it rains? It probably will... this kind of weather... oh, it doesn't matter, does it? Would ten o'clock be too early to start? I could pick you up where you're staying....\"\n\n\"Venton League? You know where that is?\"\n\n\"Of course--everyone knows Mr. Rowden's house. It's less than a mile from where I live, and directly on our way.... Tomorrow, then.\"\n\n* * *\n\nBut they never did go to Glendalough. Late that evening, when he mentioned the planned excursion, Rowden said suavely: \"But my dear Paul, aren't you forgetting the party we had planned? A.E.'s coming, and even Yeats promised--besides the Abbey crowd....\"\n\nPaul had forgotten, but recovered himself enough, he hoped, to conceal the fact. \"I know--I'm looking forward to it immensely, but if I start early I'll be back in plenty of time for dinner.\"\n\n\"It happens to be a lunch party.\"\n\n\"Lunch? I thought you said----\"\n\n\"Several of them couldn't come in the evening--Yeats in particular--and as I was anxious to have you meet our leading lights--good material for a journalist, apart from the fun you might have----\"\n\nPaul felt a sharp concern, realizing it wasn't Rowden's fault, yet unwilling to accept at any price the cancellation of his appointment with Carey.\n\n\"And you can go to Glendalough some other time,\" Rowden was continuing. \"I won't accompany you, I've been there so often, the place bores me a little. But you should go--it's worth seeing, touristically. You can have Roberts for the day.\" And after a pause: \"Or had you other plans? Perhaps you'd arranged to go with someone else?\"\n\n\"Well yes, I had, to be frank....\"\n\n\"Why don't you, then, by all means, take this--this someone else? Roberts can drive you both--any time except tomorrow.\"\n\nIt seemed reasonable, even generous, though the thought of driving in state with a uniformed chauffeur at the wheel of Rowden's Rolls-Royce was completely unenticing. Besides, how did he know he would stay at Venton League as long as the following Sunday, and of course Sunday was her best day. He already wished he had been truculent enough to say at the outset: I'm sorry, I must go to Glendalough tomorrow, party or no party. But Rowden's conciliatoriness had outmaneuvered him, so that now he could only mutter: \"Okay, I suppose that's what it'll have to be.\" Deprived of power to be adamant, he could only take refuge in ungraciousness.\n\nIt was too late to communicate with Carey that night to explain matters; she would already have left the theater and he did not know her home address. He would have to tell her when she arrived at Venton League in the morning, and though he guessed that she too would be disappointed, somehow that bothered him less than the thought of any possible meeting between her and Rowden, or even the chance that Rowden might see her driving up to the house in that \"terribly old and shabby\" car. A half-realized awkwardness in the whole situation kept him awake to wonder how he could circumvent it; and in the morning, just before ten, he walked down the drive and past the lodge gates with the idea of intercepting her in the roadway outside. She was punctual, and immediately he told her what had happened. Because he was so chagrined he was rather testy and offhand, making almost no effort to seem blameless. She was not reproachful, assuring him that she fully understood and that naturally it would be impossible for him to miss the lunch party. They did not talk long, and after separating (with no plans for any future meeting) he began to wonder whether she had been too disappointed or not disappointed enough. Whichever it was had put him in no mood for meeting celebrities.\n\nThey came, a little later, some by tram, others in cars far more ancient and battered than the one Carey had been driving. Dublin in those days was like that. And Paul, unhappy at first, was soon swept into a livelier mood by such exciting contacts; once or twice during the lunch he felt a stab of regret that he was not where he had planned to be, but he killed it by self-derision--was it possible that he preferred naïve chatter with a girl of seventeen to an exchange of ideas with some of the brightest minds in such a captivating country? If so, then what on earth had happened to him? And all the discomforts of a long drive in a rattletrap car with nothing but scenery at the end of it? For Paul did not enjoy travel for its own sake; art he loved, and a long way off and by no means next to it, nature. Moreover, he shared Dr. Johnson's attitude towards mountains, partly because of an aversion to most physical effort; even the mountain view from Phoenix Park had impressed him only because he had seen it momentarily as a backdrop.\n\nAll this while he was listening to a very eminent poet recite some lines from one of his poems. Candidly, Paul did not think he recited very well, but since it was actually himself reciting himself, what more could one ask? And then the almost equally famous Mr. So-and-so, who was opposite Paul, engaged him in talk that soon veered to a subject that was one of the few on which Paul had no ideas of his own--that of co-operative creameries; and for the next ten minutes there ensued a fascinating monologue to which Paul listened in growing wonderment coupled with the ghost of a feeling that he was missing something more interesting elsewhere. But presently Rowden suggested an adjournment to the garden, and once out there it was possible to escape from co-operative creameries and switch to another group who were discussing the theater.\n\nPaul was capricious in conversation; his rare silences might indicate that he was either bored or entranced; but so might his talkativeness, for if he were bored he would take quick refuge in the pleasure of his own voice, and if entranced, there would be generated in him sooner or later a terrific desire to entrance the entrancer. This latter occurred during the talk in the garden when Paul, having silently worshiped a well-known literary critic during the latter's eloquent opinion about the proper way to produce the plays of Synge, suddenly interrupted with an opinion of his own. It began modestly, soon acquired an eloquence fully equal to the critic's, and grew to a quite brilliant exegesis that attracted several listeners from another group.\n\nAnd in the thick of it, without a nod or a word, the well-known literary critic walked off.\n\nPaul finished his sentence and stopped. He felt himself flushing to the roots of his hair, and the aboriginal in him responded with a mental and almost muttered: Why, the son of a bitch.... He knew he had been snubbed, and though it was not the first time, the identity of the snubber made it perhaps the most devastating in his experience.\n\nOne of the group around him, an actor later to become world famous, laughed and said: \"Don't mind him, boy. He's just not used to being contradicted.\"\n\n\"But I wasn't contradicting him! I was merely explaining----\"\n\nThey all laughed then as if the whole incident had been a supreme joke climaxed by his own declaration of innocence. A tall thin youngish playwright whose white hair made effective contrast with his bead-black eyes remarked: \"I imagine you must have found Moscow very interesting, Mr. Saffron.\"\n\n\"Moscow? I've never been to Moscow.\"\n\n\"Indeed? I thought you must be a disciple of Stanislavski.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nThe playwright looked as if the question could be damnation either way; the revelation of Paul as an ignoramus, or cover for his appropriation of another person's ideas.\n\nActually Paul had not caught the name, but the wine he had drunk increased the dismay he felt at having been snubbed by a man he admired and laughed at for a joke he couldn't share. He exclaimed hotly: \"So I never heard of somebody?... So what? You guys never heard of me till today, did you?\"\n\nLater it occurred to him that the name had been Stanislavski, and that he had behaved as if it were unknown to him. The gaucherie completed his mortification.\n\n* * *\n\nThe party dispersed soon after that, and Paul, still troubled, found himself a couple of hours later in the library, staring at the Cézannes with his mind half elsewhere on a road that wandered disconcertingly between Moscow and Glendalough. The butler brought in a tray of tea things, and Rowden entered soon afterwards. Paul noticed idly that he wore different clothes; must have an enormous wardrobe, changed for every meal, a fad maybe... and he recollected something that Roberts had told him with evident pride during one of their drives: \"Mr. Rowden, sir, is very particular. Clean sheets and pillow slips every time he goes to bed--even when he takes his little nap in the afternoon. Very particular, he is.\" So he's probably been taking his little nap, Paul reflected.\n\nRowden attended to the tea making, a ritual he always performed himself, because it involved bringing the water exactly to a boil over the spirit kettle, mixing the leaves from separate caddies, heating the silver pot with a swill of boiling water and then rinsing it into a bowl; the result, no doubt, was an excellent brew, but Paul didn't like tea anyway and only drank it from politeness.\n\nRowden said, handing Paul a cup: \"What on earth did you do to our latter-day Coleridge? He went off in a considerable huff and somebody told me you'd insulted him.\"\n\n\"I insulted him? All I did was to beg to differ from a few things he said. He'd been laying the law down--it was time someone else put in a word.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid you upset him.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry if I did--I didn't mean to. But he was talking about the function of the stage director and I'm just as entitled to an opinion about that as he is about books.\"\n\n\"He directs plays too.\"\n\n\"Then I don't think he can be very good at it.\"\n\nRowden laughed. \"Confidentially, I rather agree.\"\n\n\"Why confidentially?\"\n\n\"Because if you criticize him in this town it means you'"
