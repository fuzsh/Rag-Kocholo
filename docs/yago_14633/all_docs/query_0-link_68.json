        "text": "The Narrow Circle of Nathan Hoks\n\nWhen I open my mouth, a whale swims out and I am the hologram projected from its spout.\n\nDuality provides the structure for Nathan Hok’s book of poems The Narrow Circle. The forty-four poems are divided equally into two sections called The Interior and The Exterior, but the poems themselves seem to be doing everything they can to eradicate the boundary between inner and outer. The book’s telling epigram comes from William Blake:\n\nThey told me that I had five senses to inclose me up.\n\nAnd they inclos’d my infinite brain into a narrow circle,\n\nAnd sunk my heart into the Abyss, a red round globe hot burning\n\nTill all from life I was obliterated and erased.\n\nNot surprisingly, the fives senses are on high alert throughout Hok’s poems, but especially the ear and the mouth as primary instruments of communication. There are multiple references to the mouth, which uniquely among the senses serves as a two-way passageway between inner and outer. The mouth receives sustenance, the mouth emits language.\n\n“Mouth eats poem. Falls from rafters.” (from Mouth of the Interior.)\n\n“Film comes/Whirring out of his mouth.” (from People of the Interior)\n\n“When the sky comes out/Of the mouth/Should I break it -” (from Sky of the Exterior)\n\n“I feel my mouth./It is a child crying in a dark bed.” (Mouth of the Interior, complete poem)\n\nAnd here is the complete poem Edge of the Exterior:\n\nMy mouth has become\n\nThe edge of me.\n\nIt spills outward\n\nLike a spool of thread\n\nWhich I can use to stitch up\n\nThe rest of my face.\n\nI am so afraid\n\nOf this mouth\n\nI keep it as far\n\nFrom me as possible.\n\nHere it is –\n\nI hold it towards you.\n\nAfter every five or six poems there is a double page spread on which we see four brief texts that have been extracted from the previous set of poems. These texts can be single words, brief phrases or a full line from one of the poems, and here each text is associated with a photograph. (There are a total of eight of these photo spreads.) These text/image spreads seem to act as a sort of refrain that reinforces the idea that all of the poems share some common goals or themes. But these refrains also act like new poems unto themselves, poems that force us to deal with the inner/outer issue head on. (I should probably be just a bit cautious about calling these double page spreads “poems,” since they do not have titles and their existence is not acknowledged in the Table of Contents.) In these text/image “poems”or spreads we undertake the normal activity called upon by a book, we read words – an “inner” activity of the brain in which we convert language into images. But we are simultaneously asked to read images – a process by which we pull the outer world inside to be digested, and we are challenged to find common ground between the two forms of “writing”: text-writing and image-writing. In some instances the text and the image essentially say the same thing, while at other times we must puzzle over the relationship between the text and the image. The images themselves show us things from the exterior world and (unseen) glimpses into the inner world, such as X-rays, images of sub-atomic particles, and brain scans.\n\nHoks seems to be trying to find a way to avoid being “inclos’d” by his senses, but instead to use them to erase barriers between the inner life and the exterior life, between dreamed/imagined events and observed events, between emotions and the objects and events that cause them. We see this clearly in the line quoted at the beginning of this post: “When I open my mouth, a whale swims out and I am the hologram projected from its spout” (from Letter of the Exterior). Reversing the Biblical story of Jonah, here the poet disgorges a whale, projecting his own imagination upon the world, but the holographic image of the poet is real enough to turn back and examine the poet.\n\nHere’s the last third of the final poem in the book, Mind of the Exterior:\n\nWhat is the body?\n\nThe body becomes light.\n\nWhere is it going?\n\nTo the other side of the couch.\n\nWhen will it get there?\n\nWhen morning comes around again.\n\nWhy is it a circle?\n\nI am a circle.\n\nWhat is a circle?\n\nA way to be erased.\n\nThe hand-built porcelain work of art on the cover, Kate MacDowell‘s Taking Root, 2009, is a brilliant evocation of Hok’s book.\n\nNathan Hoks. The Narrow Circle. NY: Penguin, 2013.\n\nRailroad Conversations – part 1\n\nAt first glance, Audio Obscura (Full Circle Editions, 2011) looks like a rather well-produced chapbook that pairs poems by Lavinia Greenlaw and photographs by Julian Abrams. And on one level that is exactly what it is, a beautifully designed volume, handsomely printed on lush paper, bound in sturdy French wrappers, with twenty-four double spreads that each have a text on the left page and a photograph on the right. The stark black and white images that dominate each spread depict scenes within railway stations and powerfully convey both the intimacy and the anonymity of public spaces. The sentences or phrases that make up the matching poems or prose poems suggest voices overheard or the thought fragments that might occur while waiting for a train – prayers, lists, remembered conversations, pangs of guilt. The brief texts, sometimes shorter than a haiku, have the flavor of authentic voices, although Greenlaw makes it clear that these are not found texts, but carefully shaped texts that, in her words, are meant to “hover between speech and thought.”\n\nThey’ll find out and they’ll think I knew. But that’s not what I saw. Not really. I only saw a list. You have to be absolutely sure. Or you’ve destroyed everything for nothing. Nothing. A list.\n\nAs Greenlaw discusses in her Introduction, the book Audio Obscura is actually a second generation artwork, an essentially new product related to but not exactly a substitute for the original artwork, which was a commissioned soundwork of the same name. Audio Obscura, the soundwork, consisted of a dozen monologues written by Greenlaw and audio-recorded by actors. During a period of several months in 2011, lucky visitors to several train stations in Manchester and London were able to use headphones and listen to the monologues as they walked around the stations. (There is considerable additional material about the project at the website of Artangel, one of the commissioners.) Here is Greenlaw describing what participants might hear once they donned headphones and headed into the station equipped with an MP3 player, excerpted from The Guardian:\n\nYou hear station noise so you forget you have headphones on, and the idea you’re cut off goes. Then these voices start appearing. At first you think they’re voices you’re overhearing in the crowd, then you start to overhear interior monologues – some are quite painful and explicit, some uplifting…I spent a long time coming up with situations you could map on to the people around you. So there’s a teenage girl, waiting…Having recorded these monologues, which are more poetic than narrative, I broke them down. I wanted to get to the point where you could overhear enough to imagine the rest.\n\nAs this audio excerpt shows, there is a startling intimacy to the voice speaking quietly and directly into the listener’s ears, which would have been in striking contrast to the bustling crowds, the arrival and departure of trains, and the nearly incessant noise of a busy station. There is something invasive, almost creepy about a voice in your ear, especially since it isn’t clear whose privacy is being invaded – that of the listener or of the speaker. Is the voice exposing something deeply private exclusively for our ears or are we eavesdropping? In her Introduction to the book, Greenlaw, who is Director of the Poetry MA at the University of East Anglia, talks about how her concept of “dark listening” and this feeling of “transgression” relates to the idea of the dark room or camera obscura:\n\nThe fragile, shifting but acute images of the camera obscura draw you in. In Audio Obscura, the idea is translated into ‘dark listening’ with its connotations of depths and shadows, the impalpable and the unreachable. We enter interior lives and discover, somewhere between what is heard and what is seen, what cannot be said. We are conscious of this as transgression but unable to contain our curiosity.\n\nI keep thinking about the huge distance between the soundwork and the book, between the visceral multi-sensory experience in a busy train station and the silent experience of moving one’s eyes back and forth between words and images in a book. For me, the word and image pairs never become simultaneous or connected (I’m not sure that achieving this is even possible). They never overlay or adhere to each other in any way that alludes to the possibility of transgression or eavesdropping. In the end, I can’t avoid sensing that the book is just a pale ghost of the original soundwork, and I must not be the only one who thought this: it was the soundwork, not the book, which won the Ted Hughes Award for new work in poetry for 2011. Greenlaw more or less suggests that her audio monologues are site-specific (if not to specific train stations then at least to locations that masquerade as train stations), but I’d like to see them have a new life as a podcast that could be downloaded and taken for a walk without a leash.\n\nComing in “Railroad Conversations – part 2”: Railtracks by John Berger & Anne Michaels, with photographs by Tereza Stehlíková.\n\nNew Directions Poetry Pamphlets\n\nNew Directions is starting up a new Poetry Pamphlet series and, curiously, two of the first four employ photographs. Bernadette Mayer’s Helens of Troy, NY contains a series of photographs of women accompanied by poems that, to some extent, serve as written portraits. Although there is no statement about either the poems or the photographs, the implication is that each of these woman is named Helen who lives in Troy, New York. There is no attribution to the informal photographs, so one is left with the assumption that they were made by the author. The book concludes with a poem “A History of Troy, NY (in homage to Ed Sanders, Patti Smith& Howard Zinn).”\n\nMayer’s book reminded me of the classic (and now rather hard to find) self-published artist’s book by Mike Mandel called seven never before published portraits of Edward Weston (1974), which contained portraits of seven men who shared the name of the famous American photographer. Instead of poems, however, Mandel had each Edward Weston complete a questionnaire:\n\nSusan Howe’s book Sorting Facts: or, Nineteen Ways of Looking at Marker, is an extended poetic “essay” on two films by Chris Marker – Sans Soleil and La Jetée. Although Marker has title billing in her piece, Howe spends at least as much space on the Soviet filmmakers Dziga Vertov (1896-1854) and Andrei Tarkovsky (1932-1986). Her essay/poem, with its reference to Wallace Stevens’ 1917 poem “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” deals with “the primacy of the ‘factual'” in poetry and film and includes a number of stills from films by all three.\n\nI work in the poetic documentary form, but I didn’t realize it until I tried to find a way to write an essay about two films by Chris Marker.\n\nHowe takes aspects of the traditional academic essay and willfully bends them into her own poetic form. And then she blends in elements of her own autobiography – descriptions of going to movie theaters as a child or reminiscences of her deceased husband. Passages that read like film theory are followed by passages of dense poetic shorthand. The result is that Nineteen Ways is neither classic analysis nor essay but a series of oblique glances, some quick like a snapshot and others deeply penetrating.\n\nYesterday words could come between the distance. Frame light, for example. All living draw near. Knowing no data no something then something. No never and no opposite occident orient. Film with jumps and quick cuts. Dissolves and slide effects. Real chalk. Burnt-out ruins. Without weariness. Without our working conditions. When our forces hadn’t been thrown.\n\nLanguage, Unmoored\n\nOf all of the one hundred or so books of photo-embedded fiction or poetry that have read, undoubtedly the most perplexing and resistant have been those by the poet Leslie Scalapino, who died in 2010. Crowd and not evening or light ((O Books, 1992) reproduces scraps of paper with handwritten texts and snapshots of beach and ocean scenes. When I wrote about this book earlier in a post called “Some Assembly Required,” I speculated that “what Scalapino often does in her poetry is force language into the process of losing its anchor in context, letting it start to float free.” The Tango (Granary Books, 2001) is a book-length poem that consists of a poetic text and photographs by Scalapino and other kinds of artworks by Marina Adams. It actually began as a gallery exhibition in New York City in 2001, before being adapted into book form. Scalapino’s text consists of fragments that frequently repeat and morph, along with a liberal and idiosyncratic use of typographical marks. To further complicate the reader’s task, her text, at first glance, seems utterly unrelated to the photographs of Tibetan monks mingling, talking, and dancing in a monastery courtyard. Earlier, I concluded that “Scalapino’s real subjects are language and communications and what it means to be social beings” and that she was “someone who likes to takes complicated mechanical watches apart to see how they tick.”\n\nFortunately, Magnus Bremmer tries to sort all of this out in his essay “Out of Site: Photography, Writing, and Displacement in Leslie Scalapino’s The Tango,” which appears in the new volume of essays that I have written about multiple times since mid-September, The Future of Text and Image: Collected Essays of Literary and Visual Conjunctures (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012). To Bremmer, the text in The Tango is “striking in its sheer density, the syntactical complexity of its language” and for its surprising “shortage of visual descriptions.”\n\nScalapino’s photo-texts are characterized by a sense of “writing against” the image. The images in her photo-texts bring objects, events, and places to the literary text that the writing does not simply attest to or authenticate.\n\nIn his eyes, “the juxtaposition of photos and texts… enables certain readings/viewings, but in the end delivers closure to none.” Bremmer’s dense essay covers a lot of territory and infuses no small amount of Foucault and Barthes into the mix. But in essence, he seems to be saying that Scalapino doesn’t give the photographs and texts a predetermined relationship to each other. They don’t explain or illuminate each other in any way that we typically expect words and pictures to interact on the page. Instead, the reader is given the assignment of providing ever-shifting contexts with each reading. “Scalapino’s poetry presents an incessant, subversive process of locating the self in writing.” I take the use of “self” here to mean not just Scalapino the writer, but all of us as readers. I suppose it could be said that the reader must always be in the process of locating himself or herself in the text during the act of reading – no matter what the text. It’s just that here we are confronted with an artist who makes the tangled nexus of language and meaning the explicit concern of her poetry. Here’s the opening of the final section of The Tango.\n\nThe Tango – ‘night’ any night is can’t\n\n(Astor Piazzola’s tangos: the tango is relentless. The embrace\n\n– a couple? – entwining goes and goes. It skips, jumps\n\nahead of a horizon – itself – resuming. The tango is a\n\nhopscotch ‘ahead’ of them, a couple, it’s for convenience of\n\nmaneuver, it’s for intense love.)\n\nseparation the that’s, outside as same the interior only\n\n(separation) that’s – , separation a to illumines\n\n‘live why?’ – one some on dependent – illumines – no place\n\nBremmer points to the indexicality of Scalapino’s work as both the source of confusion for the reader and a key element in her strategy of showing us how language works unmoored from context. The Tango is full of pronouns – he, they, it – and references to direction that cannot be clearly linked to anything else in the text or in the images. When I first read Scalapino, I was tempted to think of her language as abstract, like a solid wall of words stripped of or resistant to meaning. Slowly, however, her work has evolved for me. It seems more organic. It helps to read the work out loud or to listen to Scalpino read and one suddenly wonders if this isn’t somehow related to the way the brain works, using bits of language and images to build up meaning, not in a linear fashion but simultaneously, stutteringly, from many directions.\n\nMany links to Leslie Scalapino reading can be found at the University of Pennsylvania’s Center for Programs in Contemporary Writing website.\n\nSebald Erased\n\nThe current issue (number three) of the Brooklyn-based independent literary magazine The Coffin Factory features a collaborative piece by writer Justin Taylor and artist Bill Hayward entitled “From Notes on the Inconsolable,” in which Taylor performs an erasure based on W. G. Sebald’s novel The Emigrants. The result is a fairly short poem by Taylor into which Hayward inserts three of his own photographs, à la Sebald. On Hayward’s blog, the work featured in The Coffin Factory is described as “an excerpt,” which suggests there is more to come one day. Here’s a bit of commentary by Taylor on his process of erasure:\n\nErasure is a method of delving into the depths of a text to see what can be found there. But the eraser is liberated—as well as made anxious—by the knowledge that said findings are not discoveries but creations. The erasure-text is not a salvage: it has no reality independent of the search for it, the searching is in fact what made it real. Erasure, therefore, is a way of being read, at least as much as it is a way of reading.\n\nFor the most part, the result truly is “liberated.” Other than the use of the highly-recognizable quotation “And so they are ever returning to us, the dead…”, one would be hard pressed to identify Sebald as the source for the Taylor’s enigmatic new poem. Perhaps most noticeably, the narrative voice in Taylor’s piece is utterly different. Here’s an excerpt:\n\nand you already know\n\nhow things went from never able\n\nto bring myself to anything I still don’t know\n\nfor sure what made us drift apart\n\nbetween his legs, the muzzle\n\nThere is a small universe of erasure-based poetry, but probably the most well-known example is A Humument, in which Tom Phillips made an entirely new, illustrated novel by eliminating parts of the text of an obscure Victorian book. Phillips painted on and decorated the original pages of the book as a way of editing out much of the original text, saying that he “plundered, mined, and undermined its text to make it yield the ghosts of other possible stories, scenes, poems.” Taylor’s strategy is very similar, although he’s only using (and retyping) Sebald’s altered text rather than playing with the physical pages of Sebald’s book.\n\nTaylor explains that he asked Hayward “to punctuate my erasure-text with images that would simultaneously pay homage to Sebald at the level of form while undermining or re-imagining them at the level of content.” Unlike Sebald’s snapshots and found photographs, Hayward’s are described as “intentional artworks.” They also deliberately relocate” The Emigrants to the US, where both Taylor and Hayward live. Based on the three photographs in this excerpt, it’s seems fair to say that Hayward has created a parallel imagery that references Sebald’s photographs in several ways. Reminiscent of the many sources for Sebald’s imagery, the three photographs here are done in three distinct styles: a sharply-focused sepia image of a 1940s car on a road in the American West; a dark, over-exposed black-and-white image of a small boy dressed in Western clothing (almost an ironic twist on the cover photograph from Austerlitz); and a slightly blurred image of a young woman making an enigmatic gesture or movement, as if cleaning something from her blouse.\n\nSealed Intentions: More on Sebald’s Poetry\n\nIn The New Republic, Ruth Franklin writes an extended review of W.G. Sebald’s poetry as collected in Across the Land and the Water: Selected Poems, 1964-2001 and translated by Iain Galbraith. I highly recommend the piece. Not only is it probably the most thorough review of the book, but Franklin is an extremely sensitive and thoughtful reader of Sebald. Franklin has some reservations about Sebald’s poetry, which led me to reread Across the Land and the Water (which I have written about several times earlier). “What happens when the context is obscure?” she asks, pointing out the exceptional range of esoteric and sometimes unknowable references that are scattered throughout the poems. “Crucial passages remain opaque,” she worries. “To track all the references is impossible.” In the end, Franklin decides that “too often Sebald comes across essentially as an aggregator, who piles up links and references without probing them for meaning. The connections drawn by the language and the imagery are meant to provide that meaning on their own. Sometimes they do; but not always.”\n\nThe truth is, I like the opaque, obscure poems the best. By far. Sebald signals very early on that obscurity is one of the directions his poetry will take, when he suggests a preference for the mysteries of a sealed letter over the answers that might be found by opening it up. Here’s an untitled poem written in the mid-1960s:\n\nThe intention is sealed\n\nof preserved signs.\n\nCome through rain\n\nthe address has smudged.\n\nSuppose the ‘return’\n\nat the end of the letter!\n\nSometimes, held to the light,\n\nit reads: ‘of the soul.’\n\nSebald often writes as if in a kind of shorthand, dashing down the thoughts that flash through his mind and the things that cross paths with his vision. This Sebald seems truer to his core spirit. In these poems, Sebald frees himself of the burden of having readers. These highly compressed, allusive and illusive poems feel more intimate and immediate, pulling me as a reader into unexplained territory and abandoning me there. One of my favorite poems in this collection is Day Return, about a round-trip train ride into London. The first section of the poem describes a descent into the underbelly of the city, if not into Hell itself. In the last few lines of this section Sebald presents us with a familiar litany of businesses that represent decay and death. But then, after these more or less predictable lines, he then launches into a brief but wild improvisation, enumerating a bewildering sequence of images.\n\nPulling into the north-easterly\n\nquarter of the metropolis\n\nGilderson’s Funeral Service\n\nMerton’s Rubbish Disposal\n\nthe A1 Wastepaper Company\n\nStratford the forest of Arden\n\nand the first colonists\n\non the platform at Maryland\n\nheavenly Jerusalem\n\nskyline of the City\n\nbrick-wall catacombs\n\nLiverpool Street Station\n\nAre these images of the Forest of Arden and the Maryland colonists suggested by billboards? Are they the result of the narrator simply free associating or hallucinating?** Regardless, the effect is liberating, exhilarating and I don’t find is essential to understand the mechanics of the sequence or the origins of the images.\n\n** A gentle reader has pointed out to this American writer that Stratford and Maryland are, in fact, rail stations along the line that leads to Liverpool Station. Hence there is a real-world basis to Sebald’s stream of imagery here.\n\nA Silent War: Sebald’s Poetry\n\nwhen I am here\n\nit always seems to me\n\nas if we were\n\nin the throes of a silent war\n\n(from A Galley Lies off Helsingbore)\n\nAcross the Land and the Water: Selected Poems 1964-2001, the new English edition of W.G. Sebald’s poetry, has arrived and I’ve been making my way through it for the last week. Iain Galbraith served as editor, translator, and scholar-in-residence. The volume opens with his Translator’s Introduction, in which he talks about his approach to translation and some of the issues he faced editing Sebald’s poetry, and it closes with some forty pages of very useful notes that he appended which will help readers with many of the literary, historical, and geographical allusions embedded within Sebald’s work. Between Galbraith’s bookends of Introduction and Notes lie some ninety poems by Sebald spanning thirty eight years from his school days to the year of his death.\n\nThis volume makes it abundantly clear that poetry was never a peripheral enterprise for Sebald. He consistently wrote poetry throughout his writing life and the themes that infuse his poems are the very same ones that can be found in his prose. He quickly established his own voice, which then evolved much as his prose style evolved over the years. But there are some differences. In contrast to his famously long prose sentences, Sebald honed a very sparse form of poetry, creating poems that tended to be short, dense, and – to the general reader, partially obscure. As a result, the difference between the surface of the poem and its archaeology can sometimes seem more dramatic than in his prose. While every Sebald poem has a satisfactory surface reading that any reader can appreciate, every Sebald poem gets incredibly richer as you unpack it. The challenge with his poetry is that there are few clues as to what can profitably be unpacked and the unaware reader will simply pass right over the unseen depths. As Galbraith’s many notes indicate, the range of Sebald’s multilingual allusions is mind-boggling, making me think back to the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot. But more importantly, unpacking a Sebald poem often causes a drastic undoing of the surface reading, and the most innocent landscape can turn into a place of horror. As Sebald says in the poem Calm November Weather,\n\nin fact this ground\n\nis steeped in history\n\nthey find corpses\n\nevery time they dig.\n\nSebald’s poems also strike me as more intimate than his prose. There is much less of the structural framework that puts Sebald’s prose narrators at a slight remove from the reader. The poems are less mediated. But I would add that I can’t decide if this makes the poems more personal. There are moments when certain poems feel more confessional or private, when Sebald the poet seems to lean close and speak quietly in the reader’s ear. But that doesn’t necessarily indicate that what he is saying at that point is truly a personal secret.\n\nIf you knew every cranny\n\nof my heart\n\nyou would yet be ignorant\n\nof the pain my happy\n\nmemories bring\n\n(from Poetry for an Album)\n\nHere’s how some of the reviewers in the British Isles are responding.\n\nBoyd Tonkin in The Independent (he also discusses Saturn’s Moons): “Iain Galbraith’s gracefully unsettling translations.”\n\nAn unnamed reviewer in The Economist: “Mr Galbraith does a good job translating these shifting tones and influences. However, it is a shame that this volume does not include Sebald’s original poems in the German.” [The review is now behind a paywall.]\n\nGerald Dawe in the Irish Times: “Sometimes the viewpoint is so cryptically concentrated that the hard facts of what we are looking at pass by, but in these landscapes, shades of light and weather merge like Constable into chilly elusive reality. “\n\nMelani Challenger in the New Statesman: “Both Celan and Sebald were masters of rich understatement, conjurors of the dark, hidden sense of words, names and phrases profoundly marked by history. At their best, Sebald’s poems engage thrillingly with the private archives of Germany’s memory of the war. In an age of distrust for abstruseness or overabundance in poetry, the force of suggestion in the seeming simplicity of his word-choice and phraseology contrasts with many modern poetic idioms, which aim to be instantly accessible.” And: “Galbraith’s translations are both guarded and diligent, and he succeeds in the considerable task of conveying the atmosphere of Sebald’s unmistakable prose voice into the poetic form.”\n\nAndrew Motion in The Guardian: “Galbraith’s versions are scrupulous but incisive – catching…the gloom as well as the intermittent bleak comedy of the original, and the directness that arises from its indirection.” And: “the old consolations of nature are no longer stable.”\n\nEric Ormsby in Standpoint: “Galbraith has skillfully caught the cadences of the original and in doing so, reveals Sebald’s indebtedness to a long tradition of German and Austrian elegy; this is not nostalgia but evocation in asperity, akin to the double-edged laments of Georg Trakl, of a past at once illusory and much-cherished. Galbraith provides a perceptive introduction and copious notes; all that the reader of Sebald needs is here.”\n\nMy limited “tourist German” doesn’t let me comment if Galbraith is a better translator than Michael Hamburger, the only other major translator of Sebald’s poetry, but I think Galbraith was the right choice to assemble what will long stand as our foundational understanding of what constitutes the core of Sebald’s previously untranslated poetry. As I noted earlier, Galbraith literally reinvented this book, even though it would superficially seem to be nothing more than a translation of its German predecessor of 2008 Über das Land und das Wasser, edited by Sven Meyer. Galbraith went back to the Sebald archive in Marbach and found additional poems to include (some never before published in German), resulting in fifty percent more poems than in the German edition. This permitted Galbraith to create a volume with real integrity.\n\nFinally, I must comment on the oddly pastoral title of the book and the very unfortunate choice of cover art used by Hamish Hamilton. Über das Land und das Wasser was the title that Sebald himself tentatively selected for one of the volumes of poetry that he never got around to publishing, but that seems like a poor excuse to use it for a volume of his selected poems. Certainly for an American, the phrase evokes all the wrong images, from Longfellow to Hemingway (I’m thinking of his novel Across the River and into the Trees), not to mention the mid-nineteenth century poem that has become a commonly heard Christmas song “Over the river, and through the wood,/To Grandfather’s house we go;/ The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh/through the white and drifted snow.” The marketing department at Hamish Hamilton apparently hope that by choosing a placid image of two canoes passing on a lake and placing the Andrew Motion blurb “Marvellously warm, exciting and compassionate” on the back cover they can sell more copies. (Curiously, Motion says nothing remotely like this in his review, cited above.) Perhaps the US edition, due out in April 2012, will do justice to Sebald’s dark, challenging, and deeply intellectual poems.\n\n“Published in English with additional material…”\n\nRiddle: When is a translation of a book not a translation of that book?\n\nThe earliest hint is buried in tiny print on the copyright page: “Published in English with additional material by Hamish Hamilton 2011.” Despite the similarity in their titles, the recently released English volume Across the Land and the Water: Selected Poems 1964-2001 by W.G. Sebald is dramatically different from it’s German counterpart of 2008 Über das Land und das Wasser, which was edited by Sebald’s longtime editor Sven Meyer. Across the Land, edited and translated by Iain Galbraith, contains considerably more poems, but, puzzlingly, they are incorporated within a different structure. Across the Land has five sections: Poemtrees, School Latin, Across the Land and the Water, The Year before Last, and the oddly-named Appendix, which contains two poems that Sebald originally wrote in English. The German version has three sections: Schullatein, Über das Land und das Wasser, and Das vorvergangene Jahr, each of which is different from its English counterpart.\n\nGone Missing.\n\nThe English edition contains every poem from the German edition – except two: Analytische Sommerfrische and Physikalisches Wunder.\n\nShuffled Around.\n\nAcross the Land opens with a section called Poemtrees, which contains seventeen of Sebald’s earliest poems. In the German edition, there is no section by this name; instead, the first fifteen of these poems are in the section called Schullatein – along with four other poems that appear in the School Latin section of the American edition. (Yes, this is confusing.) The second section in Across the Land is called School Latin, containing twenty poems – fifteen of which do not appear in the German edition at all. Four of the poems in School Latin were originally in the Schullatein section of the German edition and one was originally included in the Über das Land und das Wasser section. (Confused even more? Sorry, we’re not done.) The third section in Across the Land is called, appropriately, Across the Land and the Water, which contains twenty-nine poems, ten of which do not appear in the German edition. The fourth section is called The Year Before Last, which closely corresponds to the German section Das vorvergrangene Jahr, except that it contains six poems that did not appear in the German edition. How this fourth section got its title is never made clear. The fifth section is the Appendix, which contains two poems originally written by Sebald in English and, therefore, were not translated by Iain Galbraith. (Got everything straight now?)\n\nSo, What’s Going on Here?\n\nIain Galbraith writes in his Translator’s Introduction to Across the Land that in the 1908s “Sebald had prepared and paginated, apparently for publication, two collections of shorter poems – ‘Schullatein’ (‘School Latin’) and ‘Über das Land und das Wasser’ (‘Across the Land and the Water’), consisting altogether of some ninety poems – neither of which would find its way into print.” Sebald’s manuscript for “Schullatein” contained a number of poems that also appeared in an even earlier gathering (which Galbraith calls a “loose bundle of poems”) that he labeled “Poemtrees.” To further complicate matters, some of the poems in “Schullatein” were included – sometimes in a revised manner – in the later manuscript for Über das Land und das Wasser. (Endlessly cannibalizing his own poems, Sebald also took some of these early, short poems in their entirety and inserted them into his long poem After Nature.)\n\nIf I am reading Galbraith’s introduction correctly, his reshuffling of the poems is based upon the manuscripts in Sebald’s archive at the Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach. Furthermore, Galbraith seems to have made at least some of his translations from Sebald’s manuscripts (where multiple version of the same poems can be found), rather than from the German edition of Über das Land und das Wasser. This means that one cannot reliably compare Galbraith’s English translations with the published German version because Galbraith and Sven Meyer were, on occasion, using different source manuscripts for their respective editions. It is very conceivable that every time that a poem was shuffled from one section in the German edition to a different section in the English edition, Galbraith and Meyer were using different manuscript versions of the same poem.\n\nRiddle: When is a translation of a book not a translation of a book?\n\nAnswer: When the translator works from a different set of manuscripts.\n\n[Please make sure to click on the Comments line below and read Iain Galbraith’s extended comment to this post, in which he addresses all of my questions and assumptions. Notably, he explains that he and Meyer did use the same source manuscript, so that a direct comparison made be made between his translations and the German originals in Über das Land.]\n\nWhy Orphans Wear Stillness-Mittens\n\n[front cover]\n\n8. It is not, in fact, anything like silence, anything like stillness, anything like coming upon an empty meadow the day after a heavy snow storm, a meadow that is no longer a meadow but simply an expanse, a white expanse, wind in the bordering birch trees, leafless, nothing around but your own breathing, your own pause, nothing around but the moment you realize this pause.\n\n9. It is not even like any mitten, any category of mittenness.\n\n10. How small a hyphen is. How effortless its great work.\n\n[from Reasons Why Orphans Wear Stillness-Mittens]\n\nAs both the punning title and the stereographically superimposed front and back book covers imply, Ventrakl is a book about what happens when two literary hearts beat as one. The title page lists two authors: Christian Hawkey and Georg Trakl. Hawkey (American, b. 1969) calls the book a collaboration with Trakl (1887-1914), an Austrian Expressionist poet, but it seems more like an act of transubstantiation, with one poet taking possession of the words of another and making something altogether new. “Ultimately these are not my poems. Nor are they Trakl’s. They occur at some site between our languages, texts, names…”\n\nHawkey (like many other contemporary poets) is interested in the orality of poetry, specifically in the way that reading another’s poem inherently involves speaking it (even if silently) in the reader’s own voice and accent and patterns of speech. Thus, reading becomes an act of translation, reanimation, and, ultimately, ownership, opening the door for new modes of writing that will carry the intermingled DNA of two poets.\n\nFor the poems here, the modes of composition deployed are numerous and varied. Some were composed by combing through all of Trakl’s available poems in English for lines in which a given color appears; I then rearranged, cut, and altered (slightly) the lines to build poems – centos… Other procedures involved the generation of what might be called homographonic drafts (building on the growing tradition of homophonic translation), where a word (or words) from one’s native language is identified within a foreign word or text by either sound or sight (i.e. one sees and/or hears “ends” or “bends” or “sonnets” cradled within “abendsonate”), in part because the textual surface of an unknown language becomes so intensely visual. Sometimes, inspired by a procedure invented by the poet David Cameron, I typed into Microsoft Word a Trakl poem in German and used the spell check program to produce an initial draft. Other strategies involved typing the poem into an online translation engine and then translating the poem back and forth, line by line, between English and German; or shooting, with a 12 gauge, an open Trakl book from a distance of ten feet, then translating, with a dictionary, a remaining page of the perforated text…\n\nAs his strategies suggest, Hawkey is also intrigued with translation (in the broadest sense) as a creative act. He writes about a “willful mis-translation” as a way of pointing to the original and thus maintaining a kind of fidelity that is different than a literal or exact translation. The poems that result from Hawkey’s authorial bonding with Trakl are as varied as the strategies he uses to create them. Some (like Yellowtrakl, Bluetrakl, and Blacktrakl), which are poems built upon unrelated lines extracted from Trakl’s poems, read and sound much like Trakl, retaining a strong sense of mood and emotional ambiance.\n\nYellowed with incense the lovers’ slight limbs loosen\n\nShadows on yellow wallpaper; in dark mirrors\n\nThe silence of grey clouds, of yellow rocky hills\n\nThe sky hardens to grey over the yellow fields.\n\n[from Yellowtrakl]\n\nOthers, clearly made through word processing techniques, are less concrete and resemble textbook Surrealist poems (or the results of a slightly offbeat version of Mad Libs).\n\nO why these kingdoms of mild writing without alternate parks\n\nWhere schools of trout move between trees? Why, despite the ant’s hyacinth-blue light,\n\nThis earnest stammering? Blueness\n\nSwells your fuselage, and the Queen’s voles,\n\nDumbstruck by stillness, rotate the stem cells, while Democrats,\n\nMoan in the blue light of a lost miner’s eyes.\n\n[from Words Temporarily Altered by a Wig]\n\nIn addition to being a collection of poems, Ventrakl is a work that blends biography, history, literary discussion, quotation, and photographs, making Hawkey’s poetic enterprise a close parallel to W.G. Sebald’s work in prose. In between poetic efforts, Hawkey pauses to provide biographical snippets, interpretations of a few of Trakl’s lines of poetry, and commentary on a number of photographs of Trakl. Hawkey treats photographs essentially like texts, as something that can be played with.\n\nWhat traces or traces of a life could I find there, translate there? Does one defer to the magic of the photograph, the weirdly doubled aura of the historical author portrait? Can one engage it actively, generatively, using writing and the visual editing and manipulation tools now packaged into all our writing technology (crop, rotate, enlarge) to either exaggerate its magic or dispel it? Both?\n\nI have to say that Hawkey seems less successful, less daring with photographs than with poems. He doesn’t seem on such confident ground with images and the results are almost trite. His immediate tendency is to provide a “reading” of a photograph as he encounters it, translating images into little stories, into the more familiar medium (for him) of words. On several occasions, he does visually play with some of the images, enlarging them until they blur or simply break down into the building blocks of any printed image: squares of grayscale. None of this play transforms the images into anything remotely as interesting or successful as his poetic efforts.\n\nIn a gesture of closure, Hawkey, who did not know any German when he began this project, ends the book with what seems to be the only complete translation of an entire Trakl poem in Ventrakl, Grodek. Grodek is a short, quietly terrifying poem about the scene of a battle between Russian and Austrian troops that Trakl experienced. Two months after witnessing the battle and its horrible aftermath (Trakl was serving in a nearby field hospital) Trakl committed suicide.\n\nIn the evening the autumn woods resound\n\nWith deadly weapons…\n\n[back cover]\n\nChristian Hawkey, Ventrakl.
