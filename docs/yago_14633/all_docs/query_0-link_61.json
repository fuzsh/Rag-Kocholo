I am thinking in particular of a collection of unpublished letters (Souvenirs intimes - Extraits de lettres inédites 1850-1880, Paris, 1950), and also to the study of Fr. Athanase Sage on the spiritual thought of Fr. Emmanuel d’Alzon (Un maître spirituel du XIXe siècle, Rome, 1958). The recent celebration of the sesquicentennial in the year 2000 also gave birth to the publication of new works that bring us closer to this important personality of the 19th century and to the congregations he founded.\n\nSince the publication in 1956 of the Écrits spirituels, a great effort has been made to give access, to a larger audience, to the correspondence through which Fr. d’Alzon communicated the inspiration underlying his numerous initiatives and his most intimate reflections. This effort consisted in the publication of the letters collated in fifteen volumes, at first by Fr. Pierre Touveneraud, later by Fr. Désiré Deraedt (from 1978 to 1996), which comprise some 5000 letters, and finally two tomes of unpublished letters, assembled and published by Fr. Jean-Paul Périer-Muzet (Rome 2003). A truly scholarly work has resulted and is impressive. To this must be added the three volumes edited by Fr. Siméon Vailhé between 1923 and 1926, containing the letters from 1822 to 1850. The result is so impressive in fact that one might fear to read such a work and believe that only a few people, familiar with this kind of documents, could do it. There is also the fact that none or so few of the letters have been translated that this work remains completely unknown to non-francophones. The result is an incomplete picture of the man, and in certain cases a complete lack of understanding of this personality and of his objectives. Thus, the importance of this publication.\n\nI consider that the present work is an essential complement to the Écrits spirituels published in 1950. Together they give us a faithful portrait of Emmanuel d’Alzon. The Écrits spirituels bring together in one volume the official work of the Founder: the Directory (the spiritual doctrine of his religious faith), some elements of the first Constitutions, and other foundational documents (Addresses to the Chapters, letters to formators, circular letters to the religious meditations and retreat conferences, various speeches, other official and doctrinal letters). The “official” and public nature of these documents gives us an excellent idea of their author and yet, once again, it remains limited. For example, we learn very little about the evolution of the thought of the founder and of his spiritual path, about the persons he came close to and their reactions to his ideas and initiatives; in the end, we obtain only a vague perception of his true personality. A quick reading of these documents, and particularly of the Ecrits spirituels, may give us the impression that the thought of Fr. d’Alzon was rather classical and not very original, whose sermons and spiritual considerations lacked imagination and humanity, and whose personality was quite austere and inhibited.\n\nThose who had already discovered the correspondence of Fr. d’Alzon felt the need to go further. That brought about the publication of the mass of his letters. Yet for most people the personality of Fr. d’Alzon revealed by this important collection remained unknown. That is, until now.\n\nJust as the Écrits spirituels brought about a rediscovery of Fr. d’Alzon seventy years after his death, this volume finally brings about the discovery of a “new” Fr. d’Alzon nearly 120 years after his death. From now on, I believe that whoever wants to know the Founder, know who he was, and find his true thoughts, will have to refer to these two volumes.\n\nIf this book was nothing more than an anthology of the main letters of Fr. d’Alzon and of their translations into the official languages of the Congregation, it would already have found its place in the libraries of the Assumption. But the author has re-situated each letter in its precise historical context, with references that will satisfy the most erudite and permit any reader to know more about whatever he is seeking. For a long time already we had desired a modern biography of Fr. d’Alzon that would complement the two important volumes of Siméon Vailhé on Fr. d’Alzon in 1926-34. That work will require much research, but I believe that Fr. Périer-Muzet has already built the foundations for it by writing an historical preface for each letter chosen for this anthology.\n\nFr. Périer-Muzet, the archivist of the Congregation, has once again rendered a great service to his brothers and to the Church in general, and he has accomplished it with his great competence as an historian. I pray that his work, translated in the four official languages of the Congregation, become a source of renewal as was that of Fr. Sage fifty years ago, in fidelity to the spirit given to the Church, through Fr. d’Alzon, for the greater service to the people of God.\n\nFr. Richard Lamoureux, A.A. Superior General\n\nRome, February 2, 2003\n\nDEDICATION\n\nThe memory of the Founder of a\n\nCongregation does not belong only to history.\n\nIt also comes in the form of a spirituality that expresses itself in prayer.\n\nBefore the altar, the Assumption invokes Fr. d’Alzon in the hope that\n\nthe Church, in the near future, will officially recognize his holiness.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nA man, whatever his qualities, cannot be defined only by words, let alone by the words of others. Is not someone’s best to be found in his own writings? That is what we are trying to achieve in these pages, through the reading and study of the correspondence of Fr. d’Alzon, chapter after chapter, following the chronology of his life, and in choosing a few major strengths of his thought and action. Before we present these extracts, we present a summary of this person.\n\nD’Alzon, a strong personality\n\nEmmanuel d’Alzon was a son of the Cévennes, who spent his entire life (1810-1880) in the Rome of southern France in the 19th century, Nîmes: a Southerner in origin, in demeanor, and in spirit, that is how this man of the Church can be defined geographically and psychologically, vicar general of his diocese for forty years, who gave birth to two religious families, the Augustinians (1845) and the Oblates of the Assumption (1865) and contributed greatly to the formation of the Religious of the Assumption.\n\nFrom his family roots in the Cévennes (Le Vigan), Emmanuel retained more than one characteristic: quick and even impetuous in his choices as in his dislikes, faithful to ideas and to people as to the causes he took up, he willingly defined himself, with a whole-hearted temperament, “Catholic above all,” that is to say in his era, Ultramontane, anti-liberal (“liberal” in the sense of 19th century French politics), quick to act and generous in his commitments.\n\nAlso in his writings, expressions of the most polished romanticism, filled with finesse and sensitivity, can be found side by side with fiery attacks highlighted by the purest irony or marked, like Veuillot, by the talent of the polemicist.\n\nD’Alzon’s vocabulary, particularly rich in his voluminous correspondence, reveals no fear in juxtaposing the most familiar and the warmest epithets or diminutives with the most direct invectives or calls to order. Is not his favorite adverb the frequently used word “frankly,” repeated with all its nuances and sometimes dumped on someone with the most brutal honesty?\n\nSignificant Evolutions\n\nAnd yet, this “thoroughbred” Southerner, who would visit Rome more often than Paris, escapes easy classification and stereotyping. On the political level for example, if it is true that he shows himself to be, from his birth to his death, almost viscerally and without a chink, anti-liberal, we see that he did not refuse the evolutions that appeared inevitable for him and for his era: 1848 transformed him into “a republican in the making”; his monarchist convictions did not stop him, at the end of the 1860’s, from envisaging a nascent democracy.\n\nAn aristocrat of note, in command of a powerful fortune which he would inherit from his family in 1860, he neither attached himself to the dominant class, the bourgeoisie, nor to its interests. This aristocrat knew how to speak to the people and aimed to draw the congregations he would found to the service of the needs of the people. For a time the education for the elite that he developed in Nîmes by taking on Assumption College in 1844 consumed all the strength of his religious; but very quickly, Emmanuel gave free rein to other initiatives that sought to reach the masses: Fr. Halluins orphanage at Arras in 1868, the alumnates (“minor seminaries”) in 1871 for the popular classes that had been called the priesthood of the poor, massive pilgrimages beginning in 1872, and the creation with Fr. Vincent de Paul Bailly in 1873 of a popular press that would become a powerful molder of opinion, the Bonne Presse.\n\nThe child or the young man accustomed in the years 1816-1832 to the princely home of Lavagnac (Hérault), in the lordly style and the mores of the provincial aristocracy, would nevertheless die poor and stripped of everything, wearing the humble religious habit of the monk-apostle on November 21, 1880. That is the true path of an authentic gospel-like life, a striking paraphrase of the rich young man (Matthew 19:16-22), who knew how to break away from the kind of destiny that his state in life might impose to one marked by boldness, generosity, and unselfishness, one set on more universal shores and stakes.\n\nThe Gift of a “Full” Life in the Church\n\nWe would cut ourselves off from any possible understanding of the life of Emmanuel d’Alzon if we did not relate it to the free choice that he made of progressive ecclesiastical duties, matured in the light of a living, personal, committed faith open to the universal.\n\nEmmanuel liked to recall his triple attachment to the Church or his three spiritual births: his baptism in the church of St. Peter of Le Vigan (September 2, 1810) which he never forgot to celebrate annually as his true birthday; his ordination to the priesthood in Rome (December 26, 1834) at the end of great suffering because of his friendship with Lamennais; and his choice of religious life in the chapel of the college of Nîmes (December 24, 1845 and 1850) after five years of personal and community trials. Baptism, ordination and religious life do not represent three successive aspects of an anxious or inconstant life; they are three markers of a spiritual path lived in the Church and for the Church, as much on the level of a strong interior life—to love Christ, the Virgin and the Church: to live all of Jesus Christ—as on the level of a vigorous apostolic action: to promote the coming of the Kingdom of God in me and around me, the motto that would become his banner.\n\nEmmanuel was a man of total commitment, discovered in the course of his experience in a church alive. His faith was the gift of a conquest unremittingly begun anew, unremittingly expanded, and unremittingly pursued.\n\nThe trials of ill health that, in May 1854, obliged Fr. d’Alzon to reduce his activities and to care seriously for himself by enjoying the waters at Lamalou-les-Bains (Hérault), marked a kind of taking in hand and re-centering of his life and his work in which the apostolic dimension was recovered in the fire of that devouring love of Christ and the Church which consumed his entire existence. Emmanuel, who welcomed the changes of the times and who was a natural leader, who loved the studies that inspired the apostolic options he would undertake for society and for the Church, did not have the temperament of a hermit. Immersed in the life of his college with its many students, surrounding himself with laity, priests, and religious as collaborators, he did not think of his personal, priestly, and religious life except in terms of team, community, and communion. The spirit that enlivened him, and that he developed, was inspired by a faith that flowed naturally beyond the borders of a diocese, a country, or a continent, for himself, for the struggles he faced, and for the apostolic fields that he assigned to his two congregations. That spirit was as vast as the faith, as universal as the Church, and as unified as his life.\n\nNow it is time to let his own words bring his life to light May these 50 chapters whet the appetite to know him better and especially to enflame the hearts of all who will seek to live in his spirit in the service of the Gospel for today’s world.\n\nPart I\n\n1.

It’s a greenhouse where I am perfectly fine, in the middle of orange and camellia trees, although most of the cameillias have died.” Letter to Marie Correnson, 8 November 1877, cf. Volume XII (edition Deraedt), p. 231.\n\n3\n\nTHE GENESIS OF A VOCATION\n\nThe theology of the vocation to the priesthood did not begin with the 19th century! Emmanuel d’Alzon’s concept of the priesthood changed dramatically through the years. From a question of ideas, he was led to a path of commitment. It evolved from a status of influence in a society where clergy had a specific weight, clearly recognized at the time, to an interior, and even mystical, concept of the priest whose action was an in-depth participation in the incarnation of Christ in souls. This theology of the priesthood was patterned on the Imitation of Christ\n\nThe choice of a priestly vocation made its way into the heart of Emmanuel d’Alzon, according to his own testimony, in his adolescence. One might believe that he heard the slogan of vocational promotional material: too young to undertake the project, but not too young to think about it. The idea of such a vocation confronted other desires, those of a social establishment that the birthright, the formation, the social rank of Emmanuel would have given him almost automatically. When the young man revealed it to his parents, their reaction, without being negative, was far from enthusiastic. Also, his friends, patently, did not all accept the idea. In the wide variety of their answers, we would find many of the ideas or stereotypes that fill readers’ opinion columns of magazines or in the rare television programs that are given to this unusual subject. The media generally do not give much space to the mysteries and channels of grace...\n\nAnd yet, Emmanuel was not discouraged. He established study plans and organized his way of life toward the goal; he took care to surround himself with the wise counsel of a few priests in whom he had confidence so that his interior adventure might not be lost in the sands of youthful illusions. Prayer, meditation, and receiving the sacraments had already become for him, after the apprenticeship of the child and adolescent, a freely accepted life-style, a second nature. He was still a youth in age and spirit, but already an adult in his faith. At Lavagnac, he spent two years of retreat to ripen his choice, while at the same time leading the life of the youth of his time and milieu, according to his refined, but exacting taste. It was in this well-balanced context that he was led to express interiorly the YES to the gift of his life for the Church, a YES without looking back, a YES open to a world to love, to evangelize, and to save. Let take the time to hear him express his discovery:\n\n“...You do not want to be at all reasonable. I scare you in a priest’s robe. Should I have expressed all my reflections before I settled on an idea so repugnant to you? Firstly until the age often to twelve, the idea pleased me in singular fashion. I abandoned it for a while and the career that attracted me the most was the military. I gave it up because of a few remarks from my parents. But, from about that time, I decided to consecrate myself to the defense of religion, and that thought has grown in me in a surprising way. From that moment, I felt an extreme repugnance for public service. I would have accepted to have a career, but it would have been for a short time only It would have been in order to see how administration works. So I saw only one battlefield worthy of me, the rostrum, and I believed I had to prepare myself for it by serious studies. Yet, by the same principle that made me despise careers and because I believed that I lived in a lawless State, and consequently lacking in legitimate power, I believed that where God did not command, I felt that I was made to aspire to sovereignty. And so, this sovereignty, in my opinion, was in the elected Chamber, and only in the elected Chamber... I soon noticed that sovereignty did not exist any more in the Palais Bourbon than at the Tuileries, and that in a society that was so sick, one could have influence only in separating oneself completely from it and pressing on it with all the weight of the rights that it had no authority to give. From then on, my enthusiasm to become a deputy disappeared completely, and I saw in the French government only a decrepit machine that was useless and was even dangerous to try to repair it. With other considerations, I was led to conclude, as I formed a life-plan, that if I ever got settled in a career, I would resolve to do so by the age of 35 at the earliest, while I contemplated with pleasure, in the distant future of my career, the possibility of consecrating myself to God. Little by little, the desire for a career disappeared and I saw before me only the priesthood, for which I had nothing to sacrifice, since I no longer felt any attachment to the world. Do you know what frightened me the most then? It was my lack of enthusiasm; it was the coldness with which I considered the sacrifices I had to make and the possibility of profiting from it. The ease with which I believed I could make a break with my attachments frightened me; but what frightened me even more, was the absolute absence of enthusiasm. But that enthusiasm has finally appeared; there is nothing more to be afraid of except the weight of the burden that must be carried...”\n\n—E.d’Alzon to Luglien,[4] Paris, January 24, 1830,\n\nS.V., vol. I, p. 39-40. 13\n\n6\n\nROMAN INTOXICATION\n\nOn November 20, 1833, Emmanuel d’Alzon boarded the Henri V7, a ship that shuttled between Marseille and Civitavecchia. His family placed him in the care of Abbé Gabriel, then pastor of Sainte-Ursule of Pézenas, a well-educated, enthusiastic priest, and admirer of Lamennais. A young seminarian, Eleuthere Reboul, completed the trio. Stops in Genoa and Pisa enhanced the trip; on November 26, Emmanuel wrote his first letter from Rome to his sister Augustine, having had to wait an hour in the mud at the passport control and «cool his heels» at customs. Thus began his first stay in the Eternal City (November 1833-May 1835), to which he would return eight times: May-June 1855, May-June 1861, May-June 1862, April-May 1863, from November 1869 to June 1870, twice in 1877 (January-February, April-June), February-April 1878. In 1833, he quickly found lodgings in the convent of the Minims attached to the church of Sant’Andrea delle Fratte, near Piazza di Spagna. After having attended theology courses at the Roman College, he preferred, on the advice of Fr. Ventura, former general of the Theatines, to remain in his cell and study on his own, as he did in Lavagnac. He visited eminent members of the clergy, such as the Capuchin Cardinal Micara, Fr. Olivieri, Dominican, Fr. Mazetti, Caked Carmelite, all experienced theologians and favorable to the ideas of Lamennais. Before meeting with them, he prepared his reading notes, and made summaries of thorny problems of philosophy, theology, and religious politics. He also frequented the Rector of the English College, the future Archbishop and Cardinal Wiseman and his cousin Charles Mac-Carthy who gave Emmanuel English lessons, before the latter entered the diplomatic ranks.\n\nEmmanuel’s circle of relationships included Frenchmen and other foreigners living in Rome, M. d’Auriol, banker, Paul Delaroche, the son-in-law of the famous painter, Horace Vermet who would succeed him at the Villa Medicis, M. de Fournas, Xavier Sigalon, the artist, Rubichon, an economist from Grenoble, the German painter Peter von Cornelius, the future Abbé de Dreux-Breze, the de Bernis; but Emmanuel also knew how to restrain himself, for, as he says, if you want to work, you can not visit too much. There he experienced, at the heart of the Church in Rome, the condemnation of Lamennais (1834); Emnunuel suffered from the climate of politico-religious intrigues of which pontifical diplomacy is not exempt, even under the guise of theological thought. He formed a life-long maxim: “always act on behalf of Rome, never against, sometimes without.” With him and through his eyes let us discover as pilgrims and admiring observers the beauties of the city:\n\n“This morning [November 26, 1833], I went back to St. Peter’s. The facade still bothers me, but I was able to admire at leisure the interior of the church. It is incredible. The space seems to grow as you walk. It is impossible to get an idea of the magnificence of all these things. The statues, the paintings, the papal tombs, everything is beautiful. And then, you get lost in it. We went back this evening. The more one sees it, the more one admires it; but I must say frankly that I don’t like the facade, no more than the baldechino over the confession of St. Peter... Rome is an intoxicating city. I assure you, I do not exaggerate. I am on the run all day long. Truly it is miraculous. The monuments are almost as common as the houses. We went through some very ordinary streets; all of a sudden you stop to admire the very beautiful Trevi fountain, that could feed a river. You can believe me because I only began to admire it once I saw it. Mr. Gabriel claimed that I had fish blood in my veins. I let him talk... I will finish my speech at St. Mary Major. This morning I got started at St. Peter’s...\n\n—Extract of the letter to Augustine d’Alzon, November 26, 1833, edit. S.V., t. 1 p. 450-451\n\nI have begun to roam through Rome at leisure. It is incredible. In all it would take more than a year to visit Rome superficially. St. Mary Major, St. John Lateran, St. Paul outside the Walls, the Coliseum and a great number of other monuments that I visited rapidly and that I will be obliged to revisit, if I want to appreciate all the details, contain all the beauty that you can imagine. We usually do our visiting on Thursdays because then we have the whole day to roam. Those monuments which are closest we do little by little.\n\n—Extract of a letter to Augustine d’Alzon, December 14, 1833, o.c, p. 461\n\nThis evening [February 24, 1834], I went to the Coliseum to see the moon rise. I sat on the steps of the cross that protect it from destruction...\n\n—Extract of a letter to d’Esgrigny, o.c, p. 511\n\nThis evening [March 31, 1834], I went to see the famous fireworks. Perhaps I have seen more beautiful fireworks in Paris, if you consider the details, but [I have never seen] such a complete show. Yesterday, I saw the illumination of the dome of St Peter’s. You have never seen anything like it...\n\n—Extract of a letter to d’Esgrigny, o.c, p. 539\n\nYesterday [June 4, 1834], I enjoyed one of the most beautiful spectacles that I have ever seen... we went to visit the oak of Tasso, high on the Janiculum. The sun was setting behind us and was throwing its golden rays on the dome of St. Peter’s that seemed completely separated from the rest of the city. Facing us, Rome, aglow in the last light of day; farther away, the Sabine mountains and those of Albano as mists began to cover them. It was a ravishing sight. It is after seeing such spectacles that you can understand Rome. You can see it in all the majesty of its ruins and of its new monuments; you understand everything that separates the debris of the palace of Nero from the arches of the Vatican... I spare you everything that I could add on the cupolas and orange groves, on the fountains and palaces, on the old Tiber whose waters are always yellow, on the pines that show their marvelous parasols on the horizon. I pray you, plant pines on the wastelands...\n\n—Extract from a letter to Henri d’Alzon, o.c, p. 580\n\nI bother about the world only when I look out of my window and see Tivoli, the ancient habitat of Horace, Monte Porzio where Cato lived, Tusculum the city of Cicero, Albano, the cradle of the Roman Empire, the debris of some temples and, very near to me, Holy Cross of Jerusalem where there is preserved the largest part of the cross that overturned the Epicurianism of Horace, the Stoicism of Cato, the Platonism of Cicero, and expanded the limits of the Roman Empire by giving it new laws and a new god...”\n\n—Extract from a letter to Henri d’Alzon, o.c, p. 758\n\nPart II\n\n11.

Everything or almost everything contrasted, on the level of ideas, these two figures of the 19th century. And yet, one would be insulting the memory of the Founder of the Assumption to classify him without nuance as a social conservative because of his political anti-liberalism; at the time of the Second Empire, d’Alzon was demonstrably sensitive to the desires and expectations of the popular classes in their democratic and economic aspirations. Ozanam, a prestigious figure of a liberal and social Catholicism, had opened a new direction at the time of the July Monarchy with his famous motto ‘Let us turn our attention to the Barbarians’ The events that followed the Revolution of 1848 had quickly swept away the idyllic vision of the alliance of freedom and the Gospel, such as to drown it in the bloodied rubbish of the barricades. The Bonaparte dictatorship later took care of dissolving, with all the ambiguities of the Party of Order, any seeds of hope that had been scattered in 1848. In this difficult birth of a new society yearning so much for freedom, Abbé d’Alzon was certainly not a prime actor nor a privileged witness. As a man of the provinces, he was suspicious of the disputatious Parisian groups that held the top echelons and created public opinion. His efforts with the journal La Liberté pour tous in 1848 miscarried. Nonetheless, he followed, from Nîmes, the disquieting and paradoxical evolution of this ‘unattainable society.’ In his school, he fought against any outbreak of what he called ‘bourgeois spirit’ and loved the contact with the good’ people of Nîmes to whom, he believed, it was necessary to give direction and moral perspective. There is no lack of examples of his attachment to the people that could be suspected of being paternalistic if there had been at the same time signs of personal ambition or interest. As a man of the Church, Abbé d’Alzon used his influence and his means, but within the limits of his state, his status, and his convictions. A sworn enemy of intrigue, he allowed himself to be tempted only once in 1861 by a possible electoral candidacy, without any illusions as to the result, in order to block the anti-Roman political agenda of the government. It was more a question of honor than a question of taste. A text from 1840, borrowed from the St. Vincent de Paul Conferences that he had established in Nîmes, the second city in France to have them, thanks to him, allows us to understand the complex aspects of what we call the social streak of Fr. d’Alzon. It is written by Mr. Jules Monnier, secretary:\n\n“Our organization until now is properous, but we need to be extremely prudent and reserved: whenever we meet Protestants, we must avoid clashes. That is why we put off many projects of spiritual alms which we have planned: thus it is for the catechism to the taffeta makers, to the porters, books for prisoners. Since God prepares the way and since charity shows how to overcome obstacles ingeniously, we hope to begin these good works without too much delay. Abbé d’Alzon, Vicar General, after having said Mass for us, addressed us with some edifying reflections. I thought that you would find pleasure in having the summary:\n\nWe recall the sentiments of humility that the example of our holy patron must inspire in us as we begin our work. Humility, in detaching us from all human pride, stirs us to work for God alone and, through it, we come to have confidence, not in ourselves, poor and weak sinners, but in the work that the divine Master has inspired in us. We render homage to God’s omnipotence by never despairing of the good undertaken in His name. Charity always works that way. Almost all the foundations of Saint Vincent de Paul began with nothing, and had almost nothing to sustain them.\n\nThe work of the Dames de Misericorde began with a meeting of 24 devout ladies: today it covers all of Europe. At first a rented house at the Saint-Victor Gate held 12 foundlings; soon there was a hospital, Bicetre, Saint-Lazare, all of France. In the beginning Miss Legras gathered just a few Sisters of Charity; today there are more than 10,000... Our work will progress in the same manner if we know how to be detached, renounce ourselves, bring everything to God. Five loaves of bread in the hands of Our Lord fed five thousand men. The 1 franc 25 that we began with will be multiplied just as mysteriously as long as the spirit of charity, the spirit of Saint Vincent de Paul, will be in us.\n\nGod has never abandoned good works. They are truly Christian, they are devout, they are blessed when they are humble and devoted servants of God. They are different from philanthropic works where all is human, where nothing is done for God, for they refer everything to God and humble themselves in self denial where they find marvelous strength. Also, what rights charity acquires! It pushes God, if we can express it so, it forces him to give back to the one who gives in his name as much as he gave to others. It exacts and engages his mercy. And heaven opens up for charitable sinners, at the request of the poor who have been helped and to whom heaven has given his alms.\n\nLuxembourg, who said as he lay dying that he would give all his victories for a glass of water presented in the name of Jesus Christy spoke true: what indeed are all the glories, all the riches, all the honors of time compared with eternal happiness that the charitable soul conquers? Let us refer everything to God, let us give alms in a spirit of prayer, always in the sight of the Lord. It will bless us, will sanctify our visits to the poor. Our Guardian Angels will guide us, will give us consoling words to soothe the poor, words of hope to support them in their misery, gentle and zealous words to give new life to the afflicted soul and strengthen it in goodness. We will have glorified God, we will have lightened the sufferings of a few brothers, we will have sanctified ourselves: that is the most brilliant crown. Let us earn it, love it, and seek to obtain it.\n\nAbbé d’Alzon ended the meeting with more words of encouragement to the Organization. He seeks to make known to us the mission of the layman in our time...”\n\n—Letter of Jules Monnier to the President of the Conferences in Paris, August 5, 1840.\n\nOriginal manuscript: archives of the Society,\n\n7, rue du Pré-aux-Clercs, Paris.\n\nOne can read d’Alzon’s commentary on St. Baudille in the series entitled Assomption en Nîmes, #70 (pp. 357-358).\n\nTHE FOUNDER OF THE LITTLE SISTERS OF THE ASSUMPTION\n\nFr.

Letters, Volume IX (editions Deraedt), p. 400.\n\nSee an enthusiastic description of this site by Fr. d’Alzon in the same volume, pp. 166-167.\n\n29\n\nA RAMSHACKLE HOUSE IN PARIS\n\nThe history of the purchase of the plot of land on François Ier Street in Paris, some 1050 square meters, in December 1860, can be traced perfectly, thanks to the extant correspondence between Fr. d’Alzon and Brother Vincent de Paul Bailly; it was through the intervention of M. Adolphe Baudon, owner of #2 on the same street, that the purchase was concluded positively on December 12, after an auction that had no other bidders. The president of the Saint Vincent de Paul Society was not on this occasion, as was long believed or we were led to believe, simply a front, but a real buyer with his own money, in order to be of service to Fr. d’Alzon, who always seemed to be without funds. Fr. d’Alzon counted on the sale of Clichy to cover the cost without increasing his debts. Leases would be regularly signed to allow the Congregation to divide the lot, very modestly at first, in the autumn of 1861, on which a chapel would be built along with a few cells. On February 25, 1862 a first Mass was able to be celebrated there by Fr. Picard and in May of the same year the place was inhabited. There were a few enlargements made in 1866, a cloister with five small rooms above it. In 1874 the building, christened Picard, a big four-story convent in the back, would be erected, while waiting for the beginning of the construction of the big chapel of Notre-Dame de Salut, which would be completed in the years 1896-1899.\n\nBut this architectual work was merely the material envelope of a dynamic apostolic fermentation; in 1865 Fr. Pernet committed himself to the foundation of the Little Sisters of the Assumption. The war in 1870 and the Commune in 1871 only appear to mark a halt; ambitious initiatives would explode with the creation of the Association of Our Lady of Salvation (1872), pilgrimages (1872-1873), Congresses and the Press (1873), a work-place where we would find shoulder to shoulder a religious leader full of spiritual energy, Fr. Picard, and an assistant characterized by an insatiable drive, Fr. Vincent de Paul Bailly. The first alarm of November 1880, the assault on and takeover of the little chapel, was quickly forgotten; the following years marked the high point of an astonishingly lively and multifaceted spirit. House of formation, novitiate (1874), the press, preparation of Eucharistic Congresses, cradle of the Orantes (1896), François Ier Street became the heart and center of the Congregation, firmly directed by Fr. Picard, supported by a star-studded field of young religious formed in his image. Then came the sad days of 1900: the Trial of the Twelve, the decree of dissolution, the exodus. It was only in 1945 that 8 François Ier Street would become once again a center of community life. Let us follow the humble beginnings of the famous ‘bicoque’ (ramshackle house).\n\n“Nîmes, Monday evening, December 17, 1860\n\nMy very dear friend,\n\nFirst of all let me tell you that you are definitely one of the most original characters that I know; but, then again, I don’t accept any of the blame for you! I would rather give you a holy picture for all the details you go into and that interest me so much. But you will ask for it from Madame the Superior, for whom you spare the trouble of writing and reading my hieroglyphics. Your youthful eyes must be good for something.\n\nIn order to build, one must have money. On the one hand, I do not have a cent, and on the other hand I do not want to borrow, with the exception of the land credit. So we must wait until some part of Clichy is sold. No way in the world do I want a rich construction; I want something poor and very poor, as long as it is clean. In that regard, I am fifty-six times of the opinion of Mr. Baudon, and even I do not see why we shouldn’t go to the sixtieth.\n\nIt is absolutely impossible for me to go to Paris at this time. When Fr. Laurent leaves for Bordeaux, I will remind you. Fr. O’Donnell will go with Fr. Picard. If they say stupidities to each other, they will patch it up. There will not be a community for some time, and the two Fathers will be able to live in the little house neighboring that of Mr. Démion, if the house of Mr. de Brou offends the archdiocese too much. In the spring we will have sold a little of the Clichy property, it is to be hoped, and as a result, we will not be too much in debt. If the builders of our future ‘bicoque’ would want to take a part of the land at Clichy as payment, as they did for the convent of Auteuil, we could perhaps hasten the construction of the buildings.\n\nI can say nothing about the location of the chapel. I had believed that if Mr. Jackson had ceded a part of the lot, we would have been able to build along the property of Mr. Ouvré and we would have had the prescribed ecclesiastical orientation; in addition to supposing that we had the Leroux lot, we could have built for the religious on the south side. As to the passageway, I yield it gladly. If we had lay clothing, we could escape by d’Antin Avenue and in all these public gardens we would be invisible to the naked eye, isn’t it true? On that matter, I leave it up to Providence, especially as we have only d’Antin Avenue as an exit and that from the entrance on François ler Street we would be seen taking it. If by ceding these passages, and adding 20 to 30,000 francs, we can buy the Leroux and the Jackson strip, I think that it would be very good.\n\nI believe that I have answered all your questions, and as I have a raging headache caused by a head cold, I say goodbye.

Galabert was screaming for them. The Founder had been thinking of something like this since 1863, but circumstances would give an unexpected twist to his first plan. Since January 1863, when he wrote: ‘I would be disposed to found a small Congregation for Bulgaria,’ until April 1865, when he confessed: ‘I am also a bit annoyed by the Religious of the Assumption, who have recently founded two new houses and then tell me they have no subjects,’ there had been negotiations, plans and attempts! And yet, if we look at the day to day unfolding of the events, it would not be exact to present the birth of the Oblates of the Assumption as the simple result of a refusal by the Religious of Auteuil. In December 1864, Mother Marie-Eugénie de Jésus traveled to Nîmes expressly to discuss the founding of a group of Oblates who would be an intermediate category between the Choir professed and the lay sisters. It is also true that her council demanded that a foreign foundation with all its uncertainties be put off: Where to go? Andrinopolis where the Assumptionists had not yet founded and where the help of the Resurrectionists seemed to them to be a sort of last resort? And for what precise mission, since two foundations recently made or about to be made, Malaga in Spain and Poitiers, still needed personnel? In the end, on whom could he count? The famous ‘Pauline’ of Lavagnac, that is Miss Sagnier, on whom Fr. d’Alzon was counting on, calling her the cornerstone, finally removed herself from the race. Despite the understandable hesitations, d’Alzon’s sense of urgency moved him to act. In February 1865, he rented a house in Nîmes, but there was no one to live there! Finally it was Fr. Hippolyte Saugrain, the Master of Novices at Le Vigan, who saved the day in April 1865, and found in the Cévennes a pool of solid vocations, whom Fr. d’Alzon could not praise highly enough. They were the ‘Bulgarettes; his ‘Bulgarotes’, his ‘Bulgarines’, those tough little mountain girls, active, intelligent, full of faith and generosity. He found them a house to rent in the suburbs of Le Vigan, Rochebelle, blessed it on May 23, 1865, and celebrated the first Mass there the next day; and the same evening, Bishop Plantier blessed a statue of the Virgin, called Our Lady of Bulgaria, who presided over the small improvised convent. Mother Marie-Eugénie accepted to furnish this first nucleus a temporary superior, M. Marie-Madeleine de Peter. Let us visit the place with Fr. d’Alzon.\n\n“To my dear daughters, Sister Marie-Eulalie, Sister Marie des Anges and Marie Correnson, Le Vigan, April 22, 1865\n\nMy dear children,\n\nMan proposed to begin the work of the Oblates in Nîmes and God seems to want it launched at Le Vigan. The house is just about to be rented. That probably will be a done deal on Monday or Tuesday. It is on the side facing the one where we live. It is a house rented by the English for a long time, when the English came to Le Vigan, on a rise; a charming hill, a beautiful vista, water, fruit, vegetables, a prairie, and mulberry trees. It will cost 12,000 to 15,000 francs, probably 12,000. But a thousand francs-worth of leaves have already been sold. There is some 300 francs worth of fodder, four tuns of wine, so that the rent would end up at some 400 or 500 francs at most.\n\nThe person who is obtaining this great deal for us is trying to find out why we are being given such a great and advantageous deal, and fears that something is going on under the table and is trying to discover what it is. The building has four stories. On the first floor, there is a vestibule, an enormous kitchen with pantries, a huge dining room, cellars, and sheds. On the second floor which opens on a terrace, two very nice rooms, on one side an antechamber that can be the parlor, a large room that can be the chapel, with a small room as the sacristy and a small office for the superior and the chaplain. On the third floor, very large rooms which could become dormitories. On the fourth floor, bedrooms and attics.\n\nWe can move in immediately. We would begin paying only on July first, and for the first six months we would deduct the price of the leaves and the fodder sold. We would keep the wine, the vegetables and the fruit. Fr. Hippolyte claims that in one or two months he would have at least twenty young women. In that case the house would be too small, but we would have the option of sending a few to Nîmes.\n\nNote that we have two teachers, who would sell their school benches, collect their debts and bring in a few hundred francs, as well as their furniture and kitchen utensils. We believe that this endeavor won’t cost us a cent, except to set up the chapel and that will be a small expense. Besides, I can surely count on the good will of some ladies ofLe Vigan.\n\nDont you want to visit our little establishment? I will be here all next week. If you leave at six in the morning, by mail-coach or the business coach, you will be here at about one or two o’clock—seven or eight hours of coach—and then you will go back, having seen for yourselves. A trip for three in the coach what a delight! And you would come to give your blessing in the foundation of the work.\n\nAs for what we do, here is what I think: work, penance, prayer. Work to live, penance to expiate for the sins of heretics and obtain their conversion, prayer to adore the Blessed Sacrament. From there, retreats where the girls of our mountains would come to see if they should become lay sisters or go to Bulgaria. The mission that Fr. Raphael or Fr. Jean-Baptiste just gave at Alzon converted all the men, except for fifteen, gave new life to the Penitents, turned up one vocation for us and seven or eight female vocations, without mentioning those from Le Vigan and surroundings. If were successful, we would lease a big silk worm factory and put in two hundred beds, with an economical oven, to take care of the female weavers, as we have done at Saint-Ambroix. In the meantime, Fr. Hippolyte will preach to them (the weavers) three times a week for the Month of Mary, at the hospital So you see the urgency of your coming to Le Vigan to supervise all of this, give your opinion, and your blessing...”\n\n—Letter to Miss de Régis,[169] vol.

If Only We Had a Newspaper.................................. 207\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nFather d’Alzon’s life did not end on November 21, 1880 even if his pen fell from his fingers on that day. He bade farewell to his religious somewhat like his master, in the manner of the patriarch Augustine, who, on his deathbed in Hippo, foresaw a new age for the life of the Church in the face of the invasion of the Vandals in North Africa. Assumption College in Nîmes, in November 1880, awaited a police search and expulsion as the decrees of Jules Ferry concerning unauthorized teaching religious orders were applied. The intervention of Bishop Besson with the President of the Republic, Jules Grévy, obtained only a short reprieve.\n\nThe Founder himself died in uncertainty concerning the fate of his Congregations; as to that of his men, 70 religious strong, dispersed in 13 communities (France and Bulgaria), they had little promise of a future; as to the Oblates, he was not unaware of its fragility in the hands of an ill Superior. His hopes were on another level. In March 1879, did he not compare himself to Abraham, who had only one son, who had only two and one was banished, and yet he became the father of the people of God?[300] His serenity concerning his spiritual posterity was more an act of faith than a proof based on solid statistics. Placed in the hands of Fr. Picard, the Assumption, with the vigor of its spirit, would find its path of life both in Europe and on the roads of the new world.\n\nBuried November 24, 1880, in the Saint Baudile Cemetery of Nîmes, the human remains of Fr. d’Alzon would be exhumed three times: transferred to the chapel of the College of Nîmes in 1892; then to that of Séguier Street in 1942; then they would be the object of a canonical recognition in November 1964. The Cause of the Servant of God, opened rather late (1930), and studied at length because of its more or less well inspired orientations (1958), followed a sinuous path. Pope John Paul II at last signed the decree recognizing the heroic virtues of Fr. d’Alzon in December 1991, eight years after that of Fr. Pernet (1983). All that remains for his beatification is an authenticated miracle. That condition was fulfilled on February 9, 1975 for Marie-Eugénie de Jésus, beatified by Pope Paul VI. At least Fr. d’Alzon can have the consolation of having fulfilled his promise to work for the perfection of one he directed spiritually. In part, he was responsible for her perfection. Above all, may his daughters and sons continue today to promote on every continent his call to a religious, apostolic and churchly life faithful to the Gospel.\n\nPRAYER FOR THE BEATIFICATION\n\nOF\n\nFATHER D’ALZON\n\n“Lord Jesus Christ, you called Emmanuel d’Alzon to be with you,\n\nin the midst of men and women, in the service of the Father and of your\n\nKingdom.\n\nYou led him to share\n\nthat service and his love for you, the Virgin, and the Church\n\nwith brothers and sisters in the Assumption.\n\nToday, in hope and in prayer,\n\nwe await the recognition of the holiness of Fr. d’Alzon\n\nby the Church.\n\nThat is why, through his intercession,\n\nwith the poor and the sick of the Gospel[301]\n\nwe make this suppication.\n\nLord, have mercy...[302]\n\n[Share with us your passion for the Father and for man. Make of us the laborers of your Kingdom].[303]\n\nINDEX OF PRINCIPAL THEMES\n\nAlumnates: ch. 42, 48\n\nAssumption, Charism/Spirit of: ch. 10, 20, 24, 25, 31, 38, 47, epilogue\n\nAugustinian character: ch. 10, 19\n\nBible and exegesis: ch. 35\n\nCatholicity/Universalism: ch. 19\n\nChildhood/Youth: ch. 13,34\n\nChrist, Mary, and the Church, Love of: ch 20, 24, 38\n\nChurch, Love of: ch. 6, 20, 40\n\nChurch, Service of the: ch. 6, 28, 46\n\nCommunity: ch. 13, 15, 24, 25, 31, 33\n\nDeath/Mourning: ch. 27\n\nDirection, spiritual/Discernment: ch. 12\n\nDisciples, Formation of and Relationship with: ch. 4, 12, 15, 16, 23, 25,\n\n30\n\nDoctrinal apostolate: ch. 14, 19\n\nEcumenism: ch. 8, 9, 32\n\nEducation/Teaching: ch. 13, 18, 19\n\nEpiscopacy: ch. 46\n\nEvangelization/ Kingdom, the: ch. 14, 41\n\nFamily: ch. 22, 27, 34, 43\n\nFinancial matters: ch. 26, 29, 39\n\nFormation: ch. 1, 5, 7, 15, 23\n\nFoundations: ch. 17, 18, 23, 28, 29, 33\n\nFriendship/Charity: ch 4, 15\n\nInteriority: ch. 7, 15\n\nMarriage: ch. 43\n\nMinistry: ch. 8\n\nMissionary apostolate: ch. 19, 23, 28\n\nNovitiate: ch. 15, 17,36\n\nObedience: ch. 24\n\nOrthodoxy: ch. 32\n\nPapacy/Rome: ch. 6, 7, 20, 27, 30\n\nPedagogy: ch. 13\n\nPilgrimage (practice and places): ch. 2, 13, 16, 18, 21, 25, 38, 4S Politics :ch. 11,37,46 Poverty: ch. 39\n\nPrayer/Life of Faith: ch. 27, 30, 49, epilogue\n\nPreaching (Ministry of the Word): ch. 14\n\nPress/Journalism: ch. 30, 50\n\nPriesthood: ch. 37\n\nProtestantism: ch. 9\n\nReligious Life: ch. 10, 17\n\nRomanticism: ch. 2\n\nSeminary: ch. 5\n\nSensitivities, Religious and Ecclesial: ch. 9, 20, 45\n\nSickness/Health: ch. 21\n\nSocial apostolate: ch. 11, 44\n\nSociety: ch. 11, 41\n\nStudies: ch. 1\n\nSuffering: ch. 21\n\nSuperiors: ch. 24\n\nUltramontanism: ch. 9, 20\n\nVatican Council I: ch. 40\n\nVocation: ch. 3, 22, 42, 48\n\nWomen Religious: ch. 25, 33, 37\n\nWork: ch. 36"
