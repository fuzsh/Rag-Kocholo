Skittery CG lightning bolts, neon lighting, strobes, and a high magnitude score give way to kinetic energy that counters the day-to-day sequences well. In a tight 92-minute runtime, the film takes us through a community as a microcosm of culture, delivers shivering gore, and crafts characters worth caring about. The script can be a bit opaque when trying to squeeze in as many thesis-supporting scenarios as possible, but it also handles nuanced topics with grace, like the symbiotic relationship between underserved communities and drug abuse. And while the film's desire to explain itself softens its edge a bit, it eventually recovers.\"\n\nPeyton Robinson, RogerEbert.com\n\nBLACKBERRY - Jay McCarroll\n\n\"The audience are all in the joke, being fully cognisant of the BlackBerry’s fall from grace; the way Johnson invites us to poke fun at the story and its players initially feels strange, but soon becomes second nature (the phone itself, after all, was dubbed 'CrackBerry' and considered the first addictive smartphone). Where it should perhaps feel grating to have the director play such an exaggeratedly bone-headed character of his own attention-grabbing invention (the real Fregin looks like a nice man that you would pay your taxes to), this layer of fictionalization only ameliorates the comic beats. Throw in Jay McCarrol’s tongue-in-cheek electro score and the way company engineers keep pushing up eyeglasses that are already high on the bridge of their nose, and you’re left with something undeniably funny and yet somehow not mean-spirited.\"\n\nSteph Green, IndieWire\n\n\"The condensing of consequential shifts in fortune into relateably tense, humanly funny scenes is admirable, and the tech aspects are never too confusing that they pull away from the story’s stakes. Johnson’s verite-informed direction could be more fleet, but editor Curt Lobb keeps a mean pace, and Jay McCarrol’s electronic score does its era-setting part.\"\n\nRobert Abele, The Wrap\n\n\"Pacing could be more consistent, but regular Johnson collaborator Jay McCarrol’s synth score gooses the energy and fits the subject matter, complemented by some choice needle drops from Joy Division, The Strokes, Moby and The White Stripes. The cleverest of them is The Kinks’ classic, 'Waterloo Sunset,' deftly repurposed as a dream of melancholy nostalgia for another Waterloo, across the Atlantic.\"\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nFLAMIN' HOT - Marcelo Zarvos\n\n\"In one scene, just after laying off a bunch of workers, a boss diminishes Montañez under the guise of not-so-subtly saying that there are those who have bigger problems, and he should just be grateful for what he has. The narration that surrounds such moments, while occasionally clunky, makes explicit how this is merely a continuation of interpersonal and structural instances of racism that are baked into so much of the world. That Montañez turns this on its head in the film, proudly expressing how his specific cultural background has value, makes for the type of moment where you can feel the pause being left for cheers and applause. This is one of those choices that, while it has to push back against saccharine musical compositions, effectively tugs at the heartstrings.\"\n\nChase Hutchinson, Collider\n\nFURIES - Nguyen Hoang Anh\n\n\"These concerns do not detract too much from the film’s overall success as a fast-and-furious action bonanza that’s stylishly filmed in a riot of primary colors by DP Phu Nam. The rock guitar-dominated original score by Nguyen Hoang Anh is fine if a tad generic, and the soundtrack is given a nice boost by songs from renowned female singer Phuong Tranh, veteran pop star Dan Truong and co-star Toc Tien. Also noteworthy is Na Bong Chua’s excellent costume design which includes an eye-catching pink jump suit as Bi’s distinctly personal choice of combat fatigue.\"\n\nRichard Kuipers, Variety\n\nJOYRIDE - Ray Harman\n\n\"If you’re able to look past the police’s bizarre inaction, Mully’s implausibly excellent driving skills and the schmaltzy score, there are moments of fun to be had. Colman and Reid make a believable surrogate mother-son pairing, with the Oscar-winner predictably great at capturing a mum in the throes of postpartum depression, but the barrage of silly one-liners that follows sells her -- and the character -- short. Ultimately, it’s a joyride that runs clean out of gas.\"\n\nWhelan Barzey, Time Out\n\nMASTER GARDENER - Devonte Hynes\n\n\"The song at the end of the movie, part of the remarkable, insinuating score (mostly airy keyboards and heavily processed electric guitar, always hinting at a kind of magic that goes hand in hand with a lot of the movie’s plant imagery) by Devonte Hynes, who makes records under the name Blood Orange, says 'I don’t want to leave this world without saying I love you.' It’s possible Schrader came up with this particular scenario because he believes that the only way to portray love credibly and compellingly these days is to depict it in its most utterly improbable form.\"\n\nGlenn Kenny, RogerEbert.com\n\n\"Dev Hynes’ (of Blood Orange) atmospheric score is an emotional touchstone in an oft-confusing arena both narratively and thematically. It’s hard to imagine how one should receive any of this without some providence from the score. It’s an everyday story for Schrader, a stalwart in cinematic perversion, but it’s more careful than most of his others, and tastefully so. The clearest example is in the meticulously planted seeds of consent, phrased as explicitly as possible throughout the screenplay so as to leave no room for interpretation in certain areas.\"\n\nLuke Hicks, Paste Magazine\n\n\"The stakes also feel significantly lower this time around -- the worst that our characters endure is a spot of light garden vandalism. The beauty in Schrader’s work has always been in the relationship between penance and absolution, which feels noticeably absent here. It’s a shame because the trio of Edgerton, Swindell, and Weaver deliver strong performances, and Devonte Hynes’ romantic score with a slight edge of sombreness is nicely atmospheric, but the film’s third act feels too neat and unconvincing, particularly given the sharpness of the conclusion in Schrader’s last two films. Moreover -- do we really need to watch another Neo-Nazi redemption narrative?\"\n\nHannah Strong, Little White Lies\n\n\"'Master Gardener''s artful opening credits -- set to the earthy rumble of Devonté Hynes’s synth score -- depict flowers in bloom against a sheer black backdrop dissected by a thin white line. Later, Narvel warns Maya that they’re all just walking a line she should be careful of crossing. If only Schrader had crossed a few more, and not watered down the sultry melodrama, pruning it far too stiffly.\"\n\nStephen A. Russell, Time Out\n\n\"The muddled tone of the chronically underpowered film is exacerbated by a score from British alternative R&B composer Devonté Hynes, whose mellow grooves seem antithetical to tension or suspense.\"\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nONE RANGER - Sean Murray\n\n\"Several subsidiary turns seem to have been cast on the basis of bicep and chest measurements. But disappointingly, 'One Ranger' never leaps into the realm of conscious genre cartoon that such elements suggest, which might have lent it some snap. Instead, it’s a self-canceling combination of the earnest and the clueless, its technical competency shorn of any leavening style or personality. That lack is underlined by Sean Murray, whose bombast feels so familiar you might at first mistake it for a pastiche of library music. This movie could be worse -- but if it were, it might leave more of an impression.\"\n\nDennis Harvey, Variety\n\nPAST LIVES - Christopher Bear, Daniel Rossen\n\n\"Every other facet of the film conspires to strengthen the semi-heightened reality that its cast puts into motion. Shabier Kirchner’s long-lens 35mm cinematography emphasizes the threat of distance inherent to Song’s meticulous compositions (at one point a character is framed out of a shot in a way that made me gasp), Grace Yun’s production design splits the difference between 'pressurized romance' and 'too-precious fairy tale,' while Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen’s crystalline score allows the movie to find its proper time signature right from the start.\"\n\nDavid Ehrlich, Indie Wire\n\n\"That said, it can be difficult to draw a bead on the film’s first half, which, with its pointed musical underscoring and wistful look at a lost but reasonably uneventful childhood, feels a bit like lily-gilding. It’s not entirely convincing that reconnecting with a childhood crush merits the slow build-up, emotional score, or symbolic images -- like the one when the younger versions of the pair part for the last time in Seoul, their paths home diverging like their paths in life.\"\n\nPat Brown, Slant Magazine\n\n\"Song doesn’t just choose her words carefully. Cinematographer Shabier Kirchner can open up the city, letting a quiet ferry ride breathe deeply of the wide sky, but excels at cramped compositions. One, as Hae Sung walks into Nora and Arthur’s apartment, enhances one of the movie’s best jokes. Up-and-coming composers Daniel Rossen and Christopher Bear (of Grizzly Bear) nudge and prod our tear ducts, as if they needed it. All the sweetness and pain is there in the words and in the distance, close and far, between Hae Sung and Nora.\"\n\nJacob Oller, Paste Magazine\n\n\"It might not have been the right decision to use the same actors, Lee and Yoo, in the middle and later segments of Nora’s life. There’s something beautiful but still-unformed about people in their early 20s, and the performers look too mature to convey it. That’s where Grizzly Bear collaborators Christopher Bear and Daniel Rosen’s music comes in handy: The score practically bubbles with potential during the scenes where Nora and Hae Sung are video chatting -- a youthful sound, compared with later, when strings speak to what they might have missed out on.\"\n\nPeter Debruge, Variety\n\n\"Song reveals herself to be a fully formed filmmaker with this accomplished debut. She shows a visual command to match her emotional and philosophical insights, a pleasingly understated wit and a grasp of tone that never falters, enhanced by the delicate chiming synths of a score by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen, from indie rock band Grizzly Bear. The fluency with which the writer-director moves between time periods and distant places is impressive indeed, with invaluable help from Keith Fraase’s supple editing.\"\n\nDavid Rooney, The Holywood Reporter\n\nSTONEWALLING - Ng Chor Guan\n\n\"When the movie goes in for an infrequent closeup -- a shot of ultrasound gel being smeared on Lynn’s belly or of Lynn’s face as she puts on a surgical mask in the immediate wake of the COVID-19 outbreak -- the intimacy is startling, and instructive. For the camera to lavish attention on a single soul suddenly feels like an indulgence, a rare privileging of the individual over the collective. The same formal restraint characterizes the filmmakers’ use of music (composed by Ng Chor Guan), which fades up at only the briefest instances and has the effect of enfolding the characters in a gentle but fleeting embrace.\"\n\nJustin Chang, Los Angeles Times\n\nTHERE THERE - Jon Natchez\n\n\"Throughout, Bujalski toggles between comedy, light surreality, and philosophical inquiry, leveling things out with playful interstitials, in which the War on Drugs’s Jon Natchez performs a short solo on a range of instruments (clarinet, mandolin, and in one especially evocatively romantic piece, the piano). The result sometimes feels like a mash-up of his breezier comedies like 'Results' and 'Support the Girls' with his stylistic exercise 'Computer Chess.'\"\n\nChris Barsanti, Slant Magazine\n\n\"Made at the height of the pandemic, 'There There' is a gimmick film so low-key you may not even clock that it’s doing anything out of the ordinary. Then again, the story -- 'story' being a big word for what’s really just a round robin series of one-on-one conversations between coincidentally interlinked characters, each scene separated by a musical interlude from The War on Drugs multi-instrumentalist Jon Natchez -- is threadbare in a way that’s meant to call attention to its telling.\"\n\nDavid Ehrlich, IndieWire\n\n\"Composer Jon Natchez, best known as a member of the band The War on Drugs, appears onscreen not just at the very beginning, but also between each of the isolated episodes, each time offering a musical performance that acts as a sort of palate cleanser. For one of his solo performances, he resourcefully makes rhythmic music out of slapping a couple of spoons against a cereal bowl. It’s a neat metaphor for how Bujalski himself is trying to create art with the spare tools he’s left with in the wake of production limitations. If the resulting film feels like little more than the cinematic equivalent of a series of B-sides of varying quality strung together, it at least whets the appetite for the next proper cinematic album that Bujalski releases.\"\n\nDaniel Buckalew, The Onion AV Club\n\n\"Filmed during the height of the pandemic, when the restrictions were their most stringent, 'There There' is made up of six two-character scenes, interrupted by musical interludes, performed onscreen by Jon Natchez in various homey settings (a garage, a stairway, a kitchen). The seven actors -- Lili Taylor, Lennie James, Annie LaGanga, Avi Nash, Jason Schwartzman, Roy Nathanson, and Molly Gordon -- were filmed separately (and shot remotely by cinematographer Matthias Grunsky on an iPhone). No one was in the same place at the same time. At any given moment, there is only one person onscreen. The camera never moves. This unusual process is sometimes interesting, but sometimes not, and it loses steam as it progresses.\"\n\nSheila O'Malley, RogerEbert.com\n\n\"Structurally, the film contains six segments separated by transitional overtures of the type more prevalent in the 1970s, except here we see the musician actually performing diegetically. Yet even with adherence to familiar conventions, the finished product feels experimental and cerebral.\"\n\nMartin Tsai, The Wrap\n\n\"Andrew Bujalski’s 'There There' opens with a mellow, melancholy saxophone solo, the first of several musical interludes by The War on Drugs’ Jon Natchez that serves as bridges between the series of primarily two-person scenes that will follow. The first of them is probably the best -- it makes a promise the movie can’t quite keep – as a doctor (Lili Taylor) and a restaurateur (Lennie James) wake up the morning after their first date and first sexual encounter. They’re sweet with each other in a very specific way; Bujalski’s writing, and his fine cast’s playing, capture the rhythms and peculiarities of morning-after small talk. 'I’m not normally like that,' she says of her behavior the night before; he cheerfully shares secrets one typically waits a few dates for ('People our age? We have so much baggage – but I am such a colossal f**k-up that I have no baggage'). The intimacy is striking, but that’s not all there is; you have to see a scene like this to realize how rarely we actually see, in movies, this kind of conversation between two people of this age. But their chemistry goes sideways, and the scene comes to a sudden, unexpected conclusion. Another musical interlude follows, this one deeply discordant, and then we find Taylor rehashing the events of the morning to her AA sponsor: 'All of a sudden, I had a panic attack, and this man had to leave.' Another interlude and the Bujalski follows her sponsor to a parent-teacher conference, and so on.\"\n\nJason Bailey, The Playlist\n\n\"The film reveals itself as a series of two-person conversations, separated by scenes in which a lonely man (multi-instrumentalist Jon Natchez, of The War on Drugs) paces around his house and plays lovely fragments of music on mandolin, bass clarinet, et cetera.\"\n\nJohn Defore, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nTHE NEXT TEN DAYS IN L.A.\n\nScreenings of older films in Los Angeles-area theaters.\n\nJune 23\n\nBARBARELLA (Charles Fox, Bob Crewe) [Nuart]\n\nBATMAN: MASK OF THE PHANTASM (Shirley Walker) [Alamo Drafthouse]\n\nBEST IN SHOW [Vidiots]\n\nGREMLINS 2: THE NEW BATCH (Jerry Goldsmith) [BrainDead Studios]\n\nHAIL, CASEAR!
