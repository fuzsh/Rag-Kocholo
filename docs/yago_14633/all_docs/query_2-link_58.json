        "text": "DVD\n\nThe Ten Commandments (1956)\n\nDirected by Cecil B. DeMille\n\nRun Time: 220 minutes\n\nStarring: Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, and Edward G. Robinson.\n\nMoses leads the Israelite slaves from the tyranny of the Egyptian pharaoh and into the desert where he is given the Ten Words by God. Once the pharaoh's chief architect, Moses receives the attentions of the Queen until he rebels and is cast into exile. It looks very \"1950s\" and \"epic,\" but it's good to watch (listen for how Anne Baxter says \"Mooooses\" -- great stuff.)\n\nLent\n\nDVD\n\nJesus of Nazareth (1977)\n\nDirected by Franco Zeffirelli\n\nRun Time: 371 minutes\n\nStarring: Robert Powell (as Jesus Christ), Anne Bancroft, Ernest Borgnine, Claudia Cardinale, James Farentino, James Earl Jones, Stacy Keach, Tony Lo Bianco, James Mason, Laurence Olivier, Donald Pleasence, Christopher Plummer, Anthony Quinn, and more.\n\nThis is a well-done film of the life of Christ with a few points some Catholics might quibble with, and a few points all Catholics will quibble with.\n\nEaster\n\nDVD Wide Screen\n\nThe Passion of The Christ (2004)\n\nDirected by Mel Gibson\n\nRun Time: 126 minutes\n\nStarring: James Caviezel (as Jesus Christ), Maia Morgenstern (as Mary), Monica Bellucci (as Mary Magdalene), Claudia Gerini\n\nFilmed in Matera, Basilicata, Italy and released on Ash Wednesday of 2004, it is the story of the last 12 hours of Christ's Passion. Both Mel Gibson and James Caviezel, the man who plays Jesus, are devout Catholics (Mr. Gibson being a very traditional Catholic) who were devoted to making the film as accurate as possible, going so far as to film the movie in Aramaic, Latin, and Hebrew. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough! It is, very truly, less \"a movie\" than a religious experience. Brilliant!\n\nLent, especially Passiontide and, more specifically, Good Friday\n\nDVD\n\nThe Robe (1953)\n\nDirected by Henry Koster\n\nRun Time: 2 hours 15 minutes\n\nStarring: Richard Burton; Jean Simmons; Victor Mature\n\nIn the Roman province of Judea during the 1st century, Roman tribune Marcellus Gallio is ordered to crucify Jesus of Nazareth but is tormented by his guilty conscience afterwards.\n\nLent\n\nDVD\n\nSpartacus (1960)\n\nDirected by Stanely Kubrick\n\nRun Time: 184 minutes\n\nStarring: Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier , Jean Simmons, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov\n\nThough not particularly a \"Catholic movie,\" I put this film here because it gives one an idea of the situation in Rome around the time of Christ. Plot: The rebellious Thracian Spartacus, born and raised a slave, is sold to Gladiator trainer Batiatus. After weeks of being trained to kill for the arena, Spartacus turns on his owners and leads the other slaves in rebellion.\n\nTime After Pentecost\n\nDVD\n\nQuo Vadis? (1951)\n\nDirected by Mervyn LeRoy\n\nRun Time: 171 minutes\n\nStarring: Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Peter Ustinov\n\nReturning to Rome after 3 years in the field, General Marcus Vinicius meets Lygia and falls in love with her. She is a Christian and doesn't want to have anything to do with a warrior. Though she grew up Roman, the adopted daughter of a retired general, Lygia is technically a hostage of Rome. Marcus gets Emperor Nero to give her to him for services rendered. Lygia resents this, but somehow falls in love with Marcus anyway. Meanwhile Nero's atrocities get more outrageous. When he burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus goes off to save Lygia and her family. Nero captures them, and captures other Christians to kill them, but Marcus, Lygia, and Christianity prevail in the end.\n\nTime After Pentecost\n\nDVD\n\nBecket (1964)\n\nDirected by Peter Glenville\n\nRun Time: 148 minutes\n\nStarring: Richard Burton, Peter O'Toole, John Gielgud\n\nThe story of St. Thomas a Becket, made Archbishop of Canterbury by King Henry II who made him so for political purposes -- but who came to regret it after St. Thomas had a true conversion and came to take his new \"job\" very seriously, to the point of martyrdom. (Historical innacuracy: Thomas a Becket was Norman, not Saxon)\n\nTime After Pentecost & the Feast of St. Thomas (December 29)\n\nDVD\n\nJoan of Arc (1948)\n\nDirected by Victor Fleming\n\nRun Time: 145 minutes\n\nStarring: Ingrid Bergman, José Ferrer, Francis L. Sullivan\n\nWhat can I say? It's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman playing St. Joan of Arc in a way that modern portrayals of the Saint don't: without the \"Joan was a lesbian feminist who wasn't as Catholic as Catholics make her out to be\" overtones.\n\nTime After Pentecost & the Feast of St. Joan (May 30)\n\nDVD\n\nThe Passion of Joan of Arc (1928)\n\nDirected by Carl Theodor Dreyer\n\nRun Time: 114 minutes\n\nStarring: Maria Falconetti, Eugene Silvain, André Berley, Maurice Schutz\n\nAll reviews I've ever read about this silent film describe it as a veritable masterpiece of film-making -- a film that is shown repeatedly in film schools and is said to be the apotheosis of visual excellence in film-making. The actress's performance has been described by Pauline Kael as the best performance ever captured on film. But it is a silent movie, so may not appeal to most people who aren't \"film buffs.\"\n\nTime After Pentecost & the Feast of St. Joan (May 30)\n\nDVD\n\nA Man for All Seasons (1966)\n\nDirected by Fred Zinnemann\n\nRun Time: 120 minutes\n\nStarring: Paul Scofield, Wendy Hiller, Leo McKern, Robert Shaw, Orson Welles, Susannah York, Nigel Davenport, John Hurt\n\nThe story of St. Thomas More, an attorney during the time of Protestant \"Reformation\" in England, who suffered martyrdom by beheading rather than capitulate to Henry VIII's idea of religion. Winner of 6 Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Scofield), Cinematography, Screenplay, and Costume.\n\nTime After Pentecost & the Feast of St. Thomas (June 22)\n\nDVD\n\nThe Song of Bernadette (1943)\n\nDirected by Henry King\n\nRun Time: 156 minutes\n\nStarring: Jennifer Jones, William Eythe, Charles Bickford, Vincent Price\n\nThe story of St. Bernadette Soubirous, who had the vision of Our Lady at Lourdes and whose body still lies incorrupt at her convent at Nevers, France. This movie won Academy Awards for Best Actress (Jennifer Jones), Cinematography, Art Direction, and Music, and won nominations for Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best Director, Best Picture, Editing, Screenplay, and Sound Recording.\n\nTime After Pentecost & the Feast of the Apparition at Lourdes (February 11) and the Feast of St. Bernadette (April 16)\n\nDVD\n\nThérèse (1986)\n\nDirected by Alain Cavalier\n\nRun Time: 94 minutes\n\nStarring: Catherine Mouchet\n\nThis French movie (English subtitles) is a very strange and haunting one. It will not please the \"I need action and explosions\" types (they will loathe it), but for those who are able to be calm, meditative, and appreciative of visual beauty, this one is most definitely for you. It is a visual poem in shades of blue and white, and the way the camera treats faces in this movie is something to behold. What I appreciate about this film is its capturing of the stillness of a convent's interior and how that makes one appreciate the little things -- the rustling of freshly washed white linen, sound of bare feet on cold stone floors... If you \"get\" what I am saying, buy or rent this movie. (Warning: after Thérèse becomes quite ill and confined to bed, don't eat anything while watching if you have a queasy stomach. One little quickie scene that involves a bizarre form of mortification/relic veneration might bother you.)\n\nTime After Pentecost & the Feast of St. Thérèse (October 3)\n\nDVD\n\nInto Great Silence (2007)\n\nDirected by Philip Groning\n\nRun Time: 162 minutes\n\nStarring: Real Carthusians.\n\nThis is a documentary that takes you inside the Grande Chartreuse in the French Alps. From Amazon: \"In 1984, German filmmaker Philip Gröning wrote to the Carthusian order for permission to make a documentary about them. They said they would get back to him. Sixteen years later, they were ready. Gröning, sans crew or artificial lighting, lived in the monks quarters for six months filming their daily prayers, tasks, rituals and rare outdoor excursions. This transcendent, closely observed film seeks to embody a monastery, rather than simply depict one it has no score, no voiceover and no archival footage. What remains is stunningly elemental: time, space and light. One of the most mesmerizing and poetic chronicles of spirituality ever created, INTO GREAT SILENCE dissolves the border between screen and audience with a total immersion into the hush of monastic life. More meditation than documentary, it s a rare, transformative experience for all.\"\n\nLent and Time After Pentecost\n\nDVD\n\nThe Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima (1952)\n\nDirected by: John Brahm\n\nRun Time: 102 min.\n\nStarring: Gilbert Roland, Angela Clarke, Frank Silvera Richard Hale. Score by Max Steiner.\n\nThe story, beautifully filmed in Technicolor, of the greatest miracle of the Church Age, witnessed by thousands: the miracle of Our Lady appearing to Lucia dos Santos and her cousins Francisco and Jacinta.\n\nTime after Pentecost & the Feast of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary (October 7)\n\nFor Greater Glory (2012)\n\nDirected by: Dean Wright\n\nRun Time: 145 minutes\n\nStarring: Andy Garcia; Peter O'Toole; Eva Longoria\n\nThis movie about the Mexican Cristeros is one I can't vouch for since I haven't seen it. I've heard both good and bad -- that the pacing was slow, but also that it was \"awesome,\" \"excellent,\" and \"well worth watching.\" Roger Ebert said that \"it is well-made, yes, but has such pro-Catholic tunnel vision I began to question its view of events.\" Well, we don't mind the \"pro-Catholic tunnel vision\" at all, do we?\n\nIn any case, the subject matter is a very important one -- one that should be taught to young Catholics.\n\nTime after Pentecost & the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe (December 12)\n\nDVD\n\nBlack Robe (1991)\n\nDirected by: Bruce Beresford\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 41 minutes\n\nStarring: Lothaire Bluteau; Aden Young; Sandrine Holt; August Schellenberg\n\nIn the 17th century, a Jesuit missionary and his small party of companions try reaching the Huron tribe in Canada, all while facing mistrust, Iroquois warring parties, and harsh winter conditions. The movie contains strong violence, so be warned.\n\nTime after Pentecost & the Feast of the North American Martyrs (September 26)\n\nDVD\n\nMonsieur Vincent (1947)\n\nDirected by: Maurice Cloche\n\nRun Time: 1 hour 54 minutes\n\nStarring: Pierre Fresnay; Aimé Clariond\n\nSt. Vincent de Paul struggles to bring about peace and harmony among peasants and nobles in the midst of the Black Death in Europe, carrying on his charitable work in the face of all obstacles. In French with English and Spanish subtitles.\n\nTime after Pentecost\n\nDVD\n\nBoys Town (1938)\n\nDirected by: Norman Taurog\n\nRun Time: 96 minutes\n\nStarring: Spencer Tracy; Mickey Rooney\n\nThe true story of Father Flanagan who, when told by a death row prisoner that he might not have fallen into a life of crime if he'd had help as a child, builds a home for boys in trouble on 200 acres of land 10 miles outside of Omaha, Nebraska. This institution became known as \"Boys Town.\"\n\nTime after Pentecost Vaincre ou Mourir (2022)\n\nEnglish title: Vanquish or Die\n\nDirected by Paul Mignot and Vincent Mottez\n\nRun Time: 100 minutes\n\nStarring Hugo Becker; Valentine Piffard\n\nA French language film about the Catholic Vendée peasants who fought the Republican Revolutionaries to defend the Faith and their land.\n\nTime after Pentecost\n\nDVD\n\nThe Exorcist (1973)\n\nDirected by William Friedkin\n\nRun Time: 122 minutes\n\nStarring Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Jason Miller\n\nThis is the most terrifying movie ever made. It's about demonic possession (based on a true case of the possession of a young boy) and has been described by real exorcists as completely realistic (except for the silly head-spinning). This movie is shocking and horrifying and, because of its subject matter, contains extreme vulgarity and blasphemy (some quite explicit and sickening). Therefore, discretion should be used! This movie's not for children! But if you want to see what possession looks like, this movie might be for you... Winner of 2 Oscars (Best Screenplay and Best Sound), nominated for 8 others, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Lead Actor and Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Art Direction).\n\nAll Hallow's Eve\n\nDVD\n\nThe Exorcism of Emily Rose (2005)\n\nDirected by Scott Derrickson\n\nRun Time: 119 minutes\n\nStarring: Laura Linney, Tom Wilkinson, Campbell Scott, Jennifer Carpenter\n\nThe suspenseful story of a real-life exorcism and, mostly, the court room drama that ensued after the possessed girl died while under a priest's care. Much less of a \"shocker\" than \"The Exorcist,\" this movie pits the secular world against the religious world in a thought-provoking and respectful way. Highly recommended, even by exorcists and priests such as Fr. Brian W. Harrison, O.S., who wrote at Seattle Catholic\n\n\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\" gets it right. Scarily, yes, but at the same time beautifully, powerfully — inspiringly. This one is the real thing, folks. (I speak as a priest who has had direct experience with real-life exorcisms: in Rome, with Fr. Gabriel Amorth, the Pope's leading exorcist and author of several books on the subject.)\n\nBy the way, the real life girl about whom this movie centers was named Anneliese Michel (sometimes her first name is spelled Annelise), and she died in 1976. May she rest in peace.\n\nAll Hallow's Eve\n\nFilms with a Catholic Sense of the World\n\nDVD\n\nMeet John Doe (1941)\n\nDirected by Frank Capra\n\nRun Time: 135 minutes\n\nStarring: Gary Cooper, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward Arnold, Walter Brennan\n\nCapra directed this, and the great Barbara Stanwyck plays in it. That's enough there for me to like this movie, but what really gets me is the ending. The plot: Stanwyck is a reporter who prints a fake letter from a \"John Doe\" who threatens suicide over the social ills of the day. That sells newspapers, so the scheme is continued with the newspaper's hiring Gary Cooper to play this suicidal \"John Doe.\" What happens? You'll see and will love it. And if the last few lines don't make you cry, fuhgetaboutit! This is a film more for adults than children.\n\nChristmas\n\nDVD\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nDirected by Frank Capra\n\nRun Time: 130 minutes\n\nStarring: James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore\n\nIf you don't know this movie by the wonderful (and Catholic! and Italian!) Frank Capra, you've been living on Mars. This is the American Christmas movie, and for good reason! I don't care what the cynical, intellectual elites say, I love \"Capracorn\"! And I deeply love Jimmy Stewart (don't miss his \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" -- another Capra-directed movie; \"Magic Town\"; \"The Stratton Story\"; \"Rear Window\"; \"Vertigo\"; \"Rope\"; \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\"; \"Call Northside777\"; \"The Shop Around the Corner\" -- I'd better stop. But I do love me some Jimmy.). Anyway, just forget about the bad angelology (angels are not those who've died, of course) and go with the story.\n\nChristmas\n\nDVD\n\nI Confess (1953)\n\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nRun Time: 95 minutes\n\nStarring: Montgomery Clift, Anne Baxter, Karl Malden\n\nNot one of the great (and Catholic!) Hitchcock's best, but a fine film that plays with the ideas of murder, falsely accused innocent men, and the sacred seal of the confessional. This will bring a tear to your eye as you see how Hollywood used to treat the Catholic Church compared with the way things are now, when every priest is depicted as a radical or a troubled, drug-addicted or alcoholic, money-grubbing, fornicator or pedophile. So sad.\n\nPssst... If you want to know where Hitchcock's cameo is before seeing it, highlight the area between the brackets with your mouse [during the opening credits, he is crossing a staircase. According to a site visitor, Hitchcock is also the first man seen leaving the Church as the Mass ends.]\n\nDVD\n\nAngels with Dirty Faces (1938)\n\nDirected by Michael Curtiz\n\nRun Time: 97 minutes\n\nStarring James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, Humphrey Bogart, the Dead End Kids\n\nRocky Sullivan and Jerry Connolly were tough kids who grew up together in the toughest part of New York --- Hell's Kitchen. Early on, Rocky (the great -- and Catholic! -- James Cagney) gets sent to reform school, where he learns how to be a first class criminal. Jerry, who had escaped from the law, goes straight and becomes a priest. As adults, they reunite in the old neighborhood: Jerry works with the kids who could end up on either side of the law; Rocky has returned looking for a safe place to stay 'til he can get back into his old racketeering organization -- something that his old partner isn't anxious to have happen. This great oldie is filled with that \"I'm gonna get you, see\" dialogue delivered in that over the top Brooklyn accent that makes old gangster movies so memorable. The final scene is a film classic, a must-see, and, as in all the old movies, evil gets its reward.\n\nWatch\n\nThe Dead (1987)\n\nDirected by John Huston\n\nRun Time: 83 minutes\n\nStarring Anjelica Huston, Donal McCann, Dan O'Herlihy, Donal Donnelly\n\nThis film (John Huston's last) is a very slow-paced character study based on James Joyce's \"The Dead.\" To watch this movie is to be a fly on the wall at a very mellow, pleasant and charming Twelfthnight dinner party in turn of the century Ireland -- then to leave it and experience a haunting and powerful meditation on death. This one's for poets...\n\nLent\n\nDVD\n\nOn the Waterfront (1954)\n\nDirected by Elia Kazan\n\nRun Time: 108 minutes\n\nStarring Marlon Brando, Eva Marie Saint, Karl Malden, and Rod Steiger\n\nThe young and so very beautiful Marlon Brando takes on corrupt union bosses -- including his own brother. Karl Malden plays the brave, heroic priest who nudges at his conscience, encouraging him to do the right thing, even at the cost of great suffering. This classic won 8 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Actor (Brando), and Best Actress (Eva Marie Saint) -- and has the immortal lines, \"I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody, instead of a bum, which is what I am.\" Babette's Feast (1987)\n\nDirected by Gabriel Axel\n\nRun Time 102 minutes\n\nStarring Stéphane Audran, Birgitte Federspiel, Bodil Kjer, Jarl Kulle, Jean-Philippe Lafont\n\nA sumptuous, visually rich movie that is, on the surface, about a French Catholic woman who flees to Denmark after her husband and son were killed. There, she works as a domestic for two aging Protestant sisters and ends up winning the lottery. Then, after fourteen years of cooking Danish foods in a Puritan style as the sisters instructed, she uses her winnings and skills to prepare a French feast for twelve (undoubtedly not a coincidental number) -- a meal that changes their lives.\n\nOn a deeper level, the movie is about everything from sacrifice, the roads not taken, the mind-body connection, unrequited and uncosummated love, the contrast between the Protestant and Catholic views of the temporal world, and, most of all, grace, faith and hope. It is beautiful to watch, with lots of blues, cold seas, white walls, interesting faces, and extravagant foods. I highly recommend this movie! Bella (2008)\n\nDirected by Alejandro Monteverde\n\nRun time: 91 minutes\n\nStarring: Eduardo Verástegui, Tammy Blanchard, Manny Perez, Ali Landry, Angélica Aragón\n\nI haven't seen this one yet, at least as of this writing, but I've been told it needs to be on this list. Here's the review from Amazon:\n\nLife is a complicated journey in which right and wrong are sometimes indistinct and where the things that really matter are often unclear. Bella is a powerful, leisurely-paced film in which Jose (Eduardo Verastegui) and Nina (Tammy Blanchard) struggle to do what's right while seeking meaning in their lives. A quiet, brooding man with a dark past, Jose works as a chef in his brother Manny's (Manny Perez) restaurant where he mostly keeps to himself until young waitress Nina is fired. Touched by Manny's unfair treatment of Nina, Jose impulsively leaves work to follow Nina and spends a day with her where he discovers that she is pregnant and alone. The two become incredibly close in the space of a day, sharing their pasts, feelings, and fears, and a lasting friendship is born. As Nina struggles with her pregnancy options and Jose comes to terms with a horrific incident from his past, the pair's newfound friendship aids in growth and healing. In the end, Jose and Nina's lives become permanently intertwined in a most beautiful and unexpected way. Bella is a moving, introspective film that will inspire serious personal reflection.\n\nMarty (1955)\n\nDirected by Delbert Mann\n\nRun time: 90 minutes\n\nStarring: Ernest Borgnine; Betsy Blair; Esther Miniciotti\n\nMarty's a nice-a Italian American boy -- but one who can't get a girl, no matter how often he's asked when he's going to get married, or how often he's told he should be ashamed for not having a wife. And no matter how badly he'd love to find the right girl for him and build a family. Will he find Miss Right? Watch and find out!\n\nHow I love this movie. If Ernest Borgnine doesn't break your heart, I don't want to know you.\n\nDVD\n\nA Hidden Life (2019)\n\nDirected by Terrence Malick\n\nRun time: 2 hrs 54 minutes\n\nStarring: August Diehl; Valerie Pachner\n\nBased on real events, A Hidden Life is the story of an unsung hero, Bl. Franz Jägerstätter, who refused to fight for the Nazis in World War II. When the Austrian peasant farmer is faced with the threat of execution for treason, it is his unwavering faith and his love for his wife, Fani, and children that keeps his spirit alive."
