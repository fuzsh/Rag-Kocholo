        "text": "Tinker Bell (also nicknamed Tink or Miss Bell) is the tritagonist of Disney's 1953 animated feature film Peter Pan. She is a sassy fairy, who serves as Peter Pan's sidekick. Tink regularly joins Peter on his exploits throughout the magical isle of Neverland. She values their relationship so much, that the presence of other girls (particularly Wendy Darling), causes her to become insanely jealous and spiteful.\n\nTinker Bell is equipped with Pixie Dust, which grants herself and others the ability to fly, so long as they think \"wonderful thoughts\". She is a largely silent character, speaking a fairy language that is unintelligible to most humans. Her vocalizations are instead expressed in the form of a light jingling noise reminiscent of a bell.\n\nSince her inception, Tinker Bell has become one of Disney's most popular and iconic characters. Known for flying toward the screen and sprinkling it with pixie dust, Tink has featured heavily as a spokesperson for The Walt Disney Company (along with Mickey Mouse and Jiminy Cricket). She eventually became the focus of her own franchise, Disney Fairies, which spun off a series of full-length feature films, beginning with 2008's Tinker Bell.\n\nBackground[]\n\nWhen the film Peter Pan was in development, the filmmakers knew Tinker Bell couldn't have been a mere spot of light as she was portrayed in all previous Peter Pan incarnations. Tinker Bell was designed and animated by one of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men, Marc Davis. Without the aid of vocal performance, Marc relied on Tinker Bell's expressions for the animation, much like previous pantomime characters such as Pluto, Dopey, and Dumbo. Upon the release of the film, Tinker Bell received critical acclaim and has continued to shine as one of Disney's trademark characters.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nDespite her cute appearance, Tinker Bell is very sassy, feisty, stubborn, and hot-tempered. Upon meeting Wendy and other human females, Tink immediately shows disgust and irritation, mostly out of jealousy. This drives Tink to perform acts in both selfish and even murderous ways, much to Peter's annoyance. However, despite her rough interior, at her core, Tinker Bell is devoted and loyal to those she loves and will eventually come to terms with those she initially resents, should they prove themselves worthy of friendly treatment. This can be seen, most notably, in her relation to Wendy Darling in the original film.\n\nOne of the first things she does while trying to find Peter's shadow is to admire herself in a mirror, that is until she finds out how wide her hips are.\n\nSome fans have assumed that Tinker Bell has a romantic crush on Peter. However, that theory has been contradicted several times by Margaret Kerry, who has said:\n\n\"Tinker Bell was never in love with Peter Pan, she was sort of a groupie. Peter would go on his adventures and she would get to go with him, and what she was really worried about with Wendy was that maybe he wouldn't take her on the adventures anymore, he would take that ugly old girl! So that's what she was jealous of.\"\n\nAs a fairy, Tink can fly and produce pixie dust, which allows other creatures to fly (including an octopus in Return to Neverland). She is described as being a tinker, meaning that she mends pots, kettles, and acorn caps, and is shown to be very skilled, gifted, and talented at it too.\n\nPhysical appearance[]\n\nTinker Bell is described as a tinker fairy who is small, slender, pear-shaped, hand-sized, and fair-skinned. However, her entire body turns fiery red when she's angry. She has baby blue eyes, shoulder-length blonde hair worn in a bun (tied with a blue ribbon in the movies, yet the characters at Disney may appear to have a gold ribbon or no ribbon) with her bangs out, dirty-blonde eyebrows, and pointy elf-like ears.\n\nShe is usually seen wearing a green strapless dress with a miniskirt. On her feet, she wears green flats with white puffballs on her toes. She also has clear, butterfly-like wings on her back. In the Disney Fairies franchise, she is sometimes seen wearing a variety of clothing based on her original outfit.\n\nFilm appearances[]\n\nPeter Pan[]\n\nOne night in London, Tinker Bell and Peter Pan visit the home of the Darling family where he accidentally left his living shadow during one of his previous visits. Using her light, Tinker Bell scopes through the house. While searching, Tinker Bell finds and lands on a hand mirror and looks at herself. They eventually find the shadow, but accidentally trap Tink inside, and wake Wendy Darling, the oldest Darling child, in the process. Wendy helps put Peter's Shadow back on by sewing it. Tinker Bell, however, tries to get out of the drawer by climbing through a keyhole and gets stuck in the process due to her wide hips. She later gets unstuck when Wendy gets the sewing kit to help Peter free her.\n\nWendy is heavily fascinated with the stories of Peter Pan and the Lost Boys and appears to have a crush on the boy as well. This angers Tinker Bell, making her red with jealousy and even calling Wendy a \"big ugly girl\". Soon enough, Wendy explains that she may never see Peter again as her father is forcing her to \"grow up\" and leave the Pan stories in the past.\n\nBecause Peter enjoys Wendy's stories of his adventures, he offers her a chance to stay in Neverland, where she will never have to grow up. Tinker Bell is disgusted by the very idea and refuses to bestow her fairy dust upon Wendy and her younger brothers, John and Michael. However, Peter simply spanks the fairy dust out of Tink and onto the Darlings when she doesn't cooperate, giving them the ability to fly to Neverland. Once they've arrived, the group is attacked by Pan's nemesis, Captain Hook. Peter orders Tink to take the Darlings to the island for safety, but Tink leaves them in her dust. She heads to Hangman's Tree, where she, Peter, and the Lost Boys reside. She tells the boys that Pan has ordered them to shoot down the \"Wendy Bird.\"\n\nThe boys do as they thought they were told, and Peter saves Wendy's life which makes Tink so red with rage that she burns through a leaf as she flies away. When Peter finds out what they have done, he is furious. Lost Boy Cubby reveals that Tink gave them the order, and as punishment, Peter (at first) banishes the fairy forever but switches it to a week after Wendy convinces him otherwise and not be so hard on Tink. Later that night, Captain Hook's first mate, Mr. Smee, kidnaps Tink and takes her to Hook's ship, where the captain attempts to toy with Tink's emotions to get her to reveal Peter's hideout. He tells her the pirates are planning on shanghaiing Wendy, and the plot makes Tink more than happy as, with Wendy out of the way, she and Peter can be together again. She points the way to the hideout on the map, but she forces Hook to promise not to lay one single finger or a hook on Peter Pan before she completes this. Hook agrees, trapping her in a lantern once she reveals the location, revealing he had duped her and was still going to do away with Peter, but still within his promise not to lay a single finger or hook on Peter.\n\nThe next morning, Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys are captured and given the choice of becoming pirates or walking the plank. Wendy convinces the boys to refuse the offer in high hopes that Pan will save them. Meanwhile, Hook reveals his plot to plant a bomb in Peter's hideout, disguised as a gift from Wendy. When Tink hears this, she breaks free of her trap and heads for Hangman's Tree. There, she tries to warn Peter, but he brushes her claims off as nonsense. The bomb begins to ring rapidly, ready to explode, causing Peter to realize Tink was right, but Tink takes it away from Peter and sacrifices herself, with the bomb exploding with such force that it decimates Hangman's Tree and even nearly swamps the Jolly Roger away from its anchoring with the concussion from the blast.\n\nIn the rubble of Hangman's Tree, Peter is safe, but Tink is fatally injured. Peter restores her life by telling her just how much she means to him. With Tink saved, Peter heads to the Jolly Roger to rescue his friends. A battle occurs, ending with Hook fleeing for his life from the crocodile who ate his left hand and now wants the rest of the captain. With Hook defeated, Peter decides to escort Wendy home, having Tink sprinkle fairy dust all over Hook's ship so it turns gold and flies, taking the Darling children back to London.\n\nReturn to Never Land[]\n\nTink and Peter are having a normal day in Neverland when they stop by the Jolly Roger to visit and annoy Captain Hook. When they arrive, Hook claims to have his dearest Wendy held captive. Peter battles the evil pirate, but Hook throws \"Wendy\" overboard to be eaten by an octopus. Peter rushes down to save her, and Tink follows close behind. When Pan seems to have finally met his end, he emerges from the water, and Tinker Bell uses her pixie dust to lift the octopus and land him on Hook's ship. Peter and Tink then leave the scene to free the prisoner. Instead of Wendy, however, they find her daughter Jane. Tinker Bell takes an immediate disliking toward her, similar to her initial disliking of Wendy in the first film.\n\nPeter decides to introduce her to the Lost Boys, but Jane quickly grows tired of their unruly behavior and attempts to build a raft to return home. The plan fails, and Peter tells Jane that the only way to leave Never Land is to fly. Tink reluctantly bestows pixie dust upon Jane, but the flight lessons end in failure. Jane loses her temper again when Peter and the boys unwittingly destroy her notebook, and snaps at them, before declaring she does not believe in fairies. Jane's disbelief causes Tink to grow ill. After Slightly gives Tink a check-up, Peter and the gang learn that she will die unless they can convince Jane to believe in fairies. To save the fairy, Peter and the Lost Boys then set out to find Jane and make her the very first Lost Girl.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Hangman's Tree, Tinker Bell is still struggling to stay alive as her light continues to flicker in and out over and over again, this time going a bit faster as her death draws near. After unintentionally causing herself to slip off a brown mushroom by kicking her left leg in frustration (due to her trying to use her pixie dust and only being able to shoot out bits of it), which she was on earlier, Tink finds a mirror next to her, and she's clearly devastated at being the person she was all these years. Tink then looks as if she's crying.\n\nUnfortunately, Jane makes a deal with Hook. If she helps him locate his treasure, he'll give her a ride home on his ship that now has the ability to fly after Tinker Bell sprinkled her pixie dust all over it. Jane tricks the boys into playing treasure hunt, but after bonding with them, she changes her mind and discards the whistle she was meant to use to summon Hook once she found the treasure. Tootles the Lost Boy finds the whistle and innocently blows it, summoning Hook and his crew. As Peter and the Lost Boys are captured by the pirates, an outraged Peter reveals to Jane that her disbelief in fairies is causing Tinker Bell to die. Jane rushes back to Hangman's Tree, only to find out that Tinker Bell's bright light of life has expired. Jane mourns the death of the tinker fairy in guilt and shame, and her belief in fairies begins to arise. Jane's newfound belief in fairies revives Tinker Bell. The two reconcile and head to the Jolly Roger to face Hook and save Peter and the Lost Boys.\n\nThey arrive and find Peter tied to an anchor and about to be thrown overboard. Tink distracts Hook and Smee while Jane frees the Lost Boys and battles the pirates. Tink manages to knock Hook unconscious so Jane can try to retrieve the key. Hook awakens and attempts to kill Jane. Tink sprinkles pixie dust on her and she is able to escape through flight. Not only that, but she is also able to free Peter. Hook is defeated and Peter escorts Jane home. While there, Peter and Tink - who, after so many years, has finally put her jealousy and resentment of Wendy aside - have a brief but heartwarming reunion with the full-grown Wendy, whom Tink uses her fairy dust on to allow Wendy to magically levitate one last time with Peter's permission. Afterward, they head back home to Neverland.\n\nTinker Bell[]\n\nThe film Tinker Bell tells of Tink's history; long before she met Peter Pan. According to the film, Tinker Bell was born from a baby's first laugh and a white dandelion seed. She arrives in Pixie Hollow, located in Neverland. Upon her arrival, she was able to talk to her friends and her magical talent is found by showing her a number of objects related to each fairy talent which will react to her if that is her innate magical talent. Ironically, the only object she passes over when looking for her talent is the Tinker hammer, but her inner talent is so skillfully gifted and strong that the hammer goes to her. As a result, she is introduced to Clank and Bobble, who take her on a tour of Pixie Hollow before arriving at the Tinker Fairies workshop and providing Tink her new home, where she soon gets to work replacing the dandelion seed dress she was wearing at her birth with her trademark outfit and hairstyle, which amazes Clank and Bobble when they see her in it, before showing her around the workshop and meeting the Tinker Fairy Overseer, Fairy Mary.\n\nAfter hearing stories of the mainland, Tinker Bell becomes excited at the prospect of visiting in the springtime. She soon learns that only nature-talented fairies visit the mainland, and become determined to find a talent that would let her go. However, Tinker Bell's attempts at learning nature talents fail miserably. She alienates the other Tinkers in the workshop by saying she does not want to be a stupid tinker. However, after her friends see Tinker Bell successfully repair a music box, they tell her that going to the mainland shouldn't matter if tinkering is what she is good at. This does not make Tinker Bell feel better as she calls them out for breaking their promise, so she goes to Vidia for help. Vidia, who had been unintentionally humiliated by Tinker Bell earlier, tells Tink that capturing the pestering sprinting thistles would allow her to go to the mainland. In attempting to capture them, Tinker Bell ruins the preparations for spring after Vidia secretly interferes. After speaking with Terence, the fairy in charge of the pixie dust, she realizes the importance of a tinker's job.\n\nTinker Bell is able to redeem herself by inventing machines that speed up the spring preparations, allowing the other fairies to get back on schedule. This causes Vidia to out herself as the true culprit who unleashed the thistles to ruin the preparations when she gets into an argument with Tinker Bell, resulting in her being punished with rounding them up alone. As a reward, Queen Clarion allows Tinker Bell to go to the mainland with the nature fairies to return the music box Tinker Bell had fixed earlier to Wendy.\n\nTinker Bell and the Lost Treasure[]\n\nThe nature-talent fairies bring to the mainland the season of leaves, hibernation, chilly breezes, and pumpkins: autumn. Meanwhile, Tinker Bell and dust-talent fairies like Terence are staying in Pixie Hollow. Tinker Bell is trying to make a \"Pixie Express\". But it fails just as she is called to meet Queen Clarion, Fairy Mary, and The Minister of Autumn.\n\nThey show her a magical moonstone and explain to her its powers. Every eight years, there is a blue harvest moon in Pixie Hollow. When the light of this moon passes through the moonstone, it creates blue pixie dust to rejuvenate the pixie dust tree. The Autumn Revelry is the associated event during which the fairies gather to collect the dust.\n\nA new scepter is to be made to raise the moonstone, and Tinker Bell has been recommended. Although Tinker Bell has made mistakes in the past, Fairy Mary explains that tinker fairies learn from them, most of the time. Tinker Bell accepts the task, as well as help from Terence. But as the work on the scepter progresses, Tinker Bell begins to have trouble with Terence, who is trying too hard to be helpful. An accident occurs, causing the scepter and the stone to break. That night, she attends a show at the Fairy Tale Theater about a magic mirror called the Mirror of Incanta which, according to legend, granted two of three magic wishes before becoming lost. She sets out in a balloon she created to find the Mirror of Incanta. Tinker Bell intends to use the last wish to repair the moonstone.\n\nAlong the way, she meets Blaze, a brave and daringly bold firefly. Tinker Bell finally discovers the magic wish-granting mirror of Incanta, but she accidentally wastes the wish foolishly. She is found by her best and closest friend Terence, who followed her after discovering her plans and the fragments of the moonstone in her empty house. The two reconcile before escaping with Blaze.\n\nTinker Bell and Terence start back to Pixie Hollow. Along the way, Tinker Bell fixes the scepter using a white gem from the top of the mirror, the scepter pieces Terence has wisely brought, and the moonstone pieces, all set at just the right angle. She discovers the magic of friendship, humility, and love. Thanks to inspired teamwork with Terence, she is ready to give the newly constructed Fall scepter to Queen Clarion.\n\nWhen she unveils the scepter, the assembled fairies are alarmed to see the fragments of the moonstone. However, the broken moonstone shards create an unexpected benefit: they increased the surface area through which the rays of the blue moon could pass, creating the bluest pixie dust ever seen in Pixie Hollow. This blue pixie dust later appears as the main part of the film The Pirate Fairy when it is briefly stolen by Zarina.\n\nTinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue[]\n\nLike many other fairies from Pixie Hollow, Tink attends Fairy Camp on the mainland for the Summer. When she attempts to go find some lost things, Vidia asks her if she's going to the human house, which isn't too far from camp. The question makes Tinker Bell curious and she eventually sneaks off when she hears a human vehicle. Vidia follows behind to watch over her. When Tink reaches the human house, she is amazed by their \"horseless carriage\". She takes the time to flitter around under the car, while Vidia tries to get her to leave. Eventually, they do, but on their way back to camp, Tink and Vidia stumble upon a fairy-sized house made by Elizabeth Griffiths, a human girl who wishes to meet a real fairy.\n\nTinker Bell immediately heads in to investigate, despite Vidia's constant warnings to leave. Tink claims it to be perfectly good, so Vidia uses her wind to slam the door in an attempt to give Tink a little scare, but it unintentionally locks Tink inside. When Lizzy begins to approach the house, Vidia gets scared and tries to free Tink, but it's no use. Lizzy discovers Tink inside the house and takes her to her home. She prepares to show her father, Dr. Griffiths, but upon witnessing all the butterflies he has pinned in display cases for research, she decides to keep Tink a secret. Meanwhile, Vidia rallies Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, Clank, and Bobble to rescue Tink.\n\nBack at the human house, Lizzy reveals her fascination with fairies to Tink. Tink is flattered by the child's obsession, and since it's raining outside, Tink decides to stay and teach her nearly everything about fairies. She tells her how light fairies make rainbows, how animal fairies paint butterflies, and much more. They record their information in a new research book given to Lizzy by her father. She even learns to communicate via pantomime to Lizzy as well (something which she'd eventually do when talking to Peter Pan and other humans in other Peter Pan media), since her spoken dialogues couldn't be understood by regular humans and only end up being interpreted by them as jingling sounds.\n\nTink and Lizzy have formed a great friendship, but after a while, the rain dies down, and Tink is able to return to the camp. She and Lizzy make an umbrella for her and she flies outside, but she watches Lizzy attempt to show her father the research before she leaves. Unfortunately, he's too busy fixing the house's leaks, as usual, to pay Lizzy any mind. Tink returns and decides to fix the leaks in secret so Lizzy can spend more time with her father. After she does, she chooses to release a captive butterfly Lizzy's father was planning on showing to a group of scientists, which causes Lizzy to get grounded.\n\nTo make up for what had happened, Tink shows Lizzy how to fly by sprinkling pixie dust on her and teaching her how to fly, but when her father comes in and finds the room a mess, she tells him about Tink. He discards the claims and begins to throw her fairy drawings and research book into the trash. This sight angers Tink, and because of having enough of his ignorance towards fairies and his own daughter, the tinker reveals herself, telling the father off while doing so (though he only hears jingles when she talks).\n\nThe astonishing sight of a fairy prompts Dr. Griffiths to capture Tink, but Vidia arrives and pushes her out of the way. Vidia is then taken by Dr. Griffiths to London for research, but Lizzy and the fairies are able to convince him to think otherwise, which he does. Vidia is freed, and she and Tink form a friendship, while Lizzy and her father are now closer than ever.\n\nPixie Hollow Games[]\n\nWhen the traditional Pixie Hollow Games arrive, Tinker Bell and Fairy Mary represent the tinker talent fairies, competing against all the other talents in the world of the fairies. Eventually, Tink and Fairy Mary were eliminated after the twigspheres event. And when they were, Tink began to support the combined efforts of Rosetta and her teammate, Chloe, as garden fairies have a history of losing every year with no wins whatsoever.\n\nSecret of the Wings[]\n\nOn an average day, Tink, Clank, and Bobble are weaving baskets to be sent to the Winter Woods via snowy owl messengers. Tinker Bell develops a fascination for the Winter Woods and begins to wonder what it is like. Clank and Bobble inform her that warm fairies are prohibited from crossing the borderline to the Woods. Just then, Fawn arrives chasing after a rabbit who's afraid of crossing over for the winter season. Tink offers to help, believing animal fairies (and those that assist them) are allowed to cross the border to escort the animal. However, when they arrive, Fawn explains that animal fairies only send the animals off. Fawn then tries to wake a sleeping animal, and Tink takes the opportunity to cross over.\n\nWhen she does, her wings begin to glow out of nowhere, and starts feeling cold from the winter chill. Fawn then uses Tink's fishing rod-type invention to reel the tinker back to the warm side of the border. Fawn rushes Tink to the healing talent fairies when she notices Tink's wings half frozen. Silvermist, Iridessa, Vidia, and Rosetta meet with the two, and Tink tries to tell them about the glowing wings. None of her friends believe the story, so Tink goes through some fairy history books to learn about glowing wings. She finds the \"Wingology\" book, but the chapter on sparkling wings has been eaten by a bookworm. Tink then asks a nerdy sparrow man for information, but he claims only the keeper knows about glowing, glittering fairy wings.\n\nThe keeper lives in the Winter Woods, however, so Tink stows away on one of the baskets being sent over to the Woods. When she arrives, she loses the Wingology book, and the said book is found by a frost sparrow man named Sled. Lord Milori, the ruler of the Winter Woods, tells Sled to send the book over to the keeper. Tink follows and meets the keeper and a frost-talent fairy named Periwinkle. When Tink and Periwinkle meet, their wings begin to glow, just like when Tink first crosses the border. The keeper, whose real name turns out to be Dewey, discovers that Tink and Peri were born from the first laugh of the same baby, thus making them fraternal twin sisters. The two fairies are more than happy to begin their newfound and strong sisterly bonding, but Lord Milori arrives and informs Dewey to send them back as it is too cold for a warm fairy's wings to withstand.\n\nTink and Peri decide that one day together in the warm realms of Spring and Summer would not hurt. They spend time enjoying activities, and Tink even meets some of Peri's best friends. After a near-death experience, however, Dewey also agrees that it's too dangerous. Tink and Peri are forced to part ways, but Tink tells Peri to meet her at the border the next day. That night, Tink gathers her friends to secretly create a snowmaker machine. The machine will allow Peri to see the warm regions of Pixie Hollow. Tink also plans on introducing Peri to Queen Clarion, hoping the Queen would abolish the border law upon hearing how Tink and Peri are sisters. The following day, the machine proves to be a success for a short time. Peri meets Tink's friends and is given a periwinkle flower by Rosetta as a gift, which Peri frosts. After a while, Peri became too hot, and her wings began to wither.\n\nPeri is taken back to the Winter Woods, where her wings are able to recover. Queen Clarion and Lord Milori arrive and only enforce the border law further after learning about Periwinkle's event. If a warm fairy enters winter, their wings would freeze and break. If a frost fairy enters warm regions, their wings would shrivel and dry up. Tink and Peri say their goodbyes as they are forced to never see each other again. Queen Clarion explains to Tink that when Pixie Hollow was young, two fairies from separate seasonal regions fell madly in love and recklessly crossed the border. One had broken a wing and was unable to fly forever. That is when Queen Clarion created the law.\n\nThe next morning, a small portion of the warm regions of Pixie Hollow have been frozen as a result of the ice machine going berserk. Tink and her friends destroy the machine, but the weather has been thrown off, and Pixie Hollow continues to freeze. Tink and the others evacuate all the fairies and animals to shelters. Tink then realized that the periwinkle flower Rosetta gave to Peri never died due to being preserved in frost. Tink flies over to the Winter Woods to get Peri and her friends to preserve the Pixie Dust Tree, threatened by the dropping temperature.\n\nThe frost talents do so, and the Pixie Dust Tree and the rest of Pixie Hollow are saved. The frost melts within minutes of being shined on by the sun, and all is seemingly well. However, when Tink traveled into the Winter Woods, she broke her wing. Peri and Tink connect their wings, which magically heals the shredded wing. Queen Clarion and Lord Milori then reveal that they were the two fairies that fell in love and decided to allow Tinker Bell and Periwinkle to continue seeing each other. In the end, all warm fairies are allowed to cross the border when the frost talents preserve their wings. Tink and Peri are then seen celebrating the newfound unity with their new best friends.\n\nPixie Hollow Bake Off[]\n\nIn a Contest to bake the most delicious cake for Queen Clarion's arrival, Tinker Bell leads her friends as a team. She may have suggested that the Baking fairy, Gelata shakes things up a bit because she and her friends plan on a different kind of cake. but she's not too worried. Although Tink and her team were eliminated on taste at the end of the contest, the queen is feeling much better, at least she made her points with Gelata.\n\nThe Pirate Fairy[]\n\nIn the fifth movie of the ever-expanding Tinker Bell series, Tinker Bell and her five best friends - Fawn, Rosetta, Iridessa, Silvermist, and Vidia - go after a misguided and rogue dust-keeper fairy named Zarina to return the vital blue fairy dust she had stolen to its rightful place in Pixie Hollow. After confronting Zarina, Tinker Bell has her innate tinkering abilities changed and becomes a water fairy. She is uncertain of her recently acquired water-controlling abilities and accidentally creates huge waves, puddles, downpours, and whirlpools with just a touch or snap of her fingers, which effectively hinders all her fellow fairy companions' abilities to fly once they get drenched by Tink's water magic powers. Tink also gets her wings drenche along the other fairies (except for Silvermist who became a fast-flying fairy) once her backfired water magic powers caused her, Rosetta, Iridessa, Vidia and Fawn to slide down a couple of wet leaves onto the ground, and therefore temporarily losing her ability to fly in the process. With Tink and the other four fairies Rosetta, Iridessa, Vidia and Fawn become temporarily flightless thanks to their wet wings, they had to resort to using a makeshift boat made out of crocodile eggs and vines pulled by Silvermist to get to the pirate ship where Zarina is.\n\nTinker Bell desperately tries to convince Zarina to return home with them but is taken to a place on the ship inside a metal box. When she later discovers that Zarina has been double-crossed by James Hook, Tink willingly returns the blue fairy dust in exchange for Zarina's safety and well-being. She uses her unusually strong hydrokinetic abilities to push the waters back so that the others could save Zarina from sinking. She later used a sword to fight and distract the pirates while Zarina attempted to reclaim the blue fairy dust from James. When they succeeded in making the ship go off course, Tinker Bell and the others were caught in a sack from one of the ship's sails. When released, Tink used her water-controlling abilities to create a tidal wave over the pirates (as well as wash the pixie dust off of James, removing his flight).\n\nUsing the pirate ship to return home, she convinces Queen Clarion and Fairy Gary that Zarina had practically mastered her unique and strong fairy dust-controlling abilities and that they all should see her in action. She soon thanks the reformed and redeemed Zarina for fully restoring her tinkering-talent abilities with light green-colored fairy dust.\n\nTinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast[]\n\nTinker Bell appears in Legend of the NeverBeast along with the other fairies, where she helps Fawn protect the mythical, legendary NeverBeast from harm. Just like in Pixie Hollow Games, Tinker Bell is not the main character, but a supporting one replaced by Fawn.\n\nPeter Pan & Wendy[]\n\nTinker Bell appears in the 2023 live-action reimagining of the 1953 classic film, portrayed by Yara Shahidi.[1] Unlike in the original film where she had no dialogues throughout the entire film, Tink has dialogues in this adaptation similar to what happened in the Tinker Bell film series; however, Tink does not speak until during the end of the film where she thanks Wendy for hearing her. In addition, unlike the 1953 animated film, the original J. M. Barrie play, or every other Peter Pan adaptation in general, this incarnation of Tink is never shown to be jealous of Wendy, but instead befriends her.\n\nTinker Bell is first seen arriving at the Darling family's house flying quietly which she approaches Wendy who is sleeping, sprinkling Pixie Dust on her only for John to catch her, followed by Michael noticing Wendy who has it followed by Peter Pan to arriving at the house, introducing himself to the Darlings. In a plan to bring the children of the Darling out of the house, Tink follows Peter who is about to catch his shadow which Peter was able to catch it. Seeing Tink, Wendy asks Peter to know if she can speak which Peter replies that she can speak and as Wendy studies her gestures, Peter interprets: \"All fairies are small, that's what makes them fairies\". Later in a plan to take the children to Never Land, Tink then sprinkles Pixie Dust onto Wendy, followed by John and Michael for them to fly to which the three of them suddenly fly thanks to the Pixie Dust effect with faith, trust, and a little bit of Pixie Dust just as Tink follows alongside Peter bringing them to Neverland.\n\nFollowing the Second Star to the Right, Tinker Bell guides Peter, Wendy, John, and Michael across Neverland where they fly across the place where children never grow up while Captain Hook who is on his ship spots Peter Pan using his telescope, leading his crew to target him, resulting in Tink, Peter, Wendy, John, and Michael under attack by the pirates during their arrival at Neverland which Hook fires a cannonball at the edge where Peter, Tink, and the Darlings are standing, knocking them off the edge while Hook uses his telescope to find any sign of Peter Pan in his sight.\n\nAfter Peter Pan removes his disguise at Skull Rock, Tinker Bell follows alongside Peter in helping foil Hook's crew to which as the pirates escape, Tink was able to rescue John and Michael who have been held captive, thanks to her Pixie Dust just as she leads Peter Pan, Wendy, John, Michael, and Tiger Lily out of Skull Rock while Hook and his crew are under attack by Tick-Tock the Crocodile which they are able to escape from Hook, his crew, and the Crocodile. Tinker Bell then follows along Wendy who suddenly arrives at the Lost Children's Hideout where she arrives alongside Peter who enters. When Wendy sings a lullaby to her siblings as well as the Lost Children, Tinker Bell hears Wendy singing \"All Grown Up\" to the children quietly.\n\nWendy then approaches Tinker Bell where she attempts to understand her unlike Peter which Tink tells Wendy to follow her upstairs while making non-verbal gestures into Peter's room as Wendy sees the name \"James\" crossed out on the door, which Tinker Bell tells her that the name is linked to Captain Hook as she shows her an image of a hook in the form of Pixie Dust as Tink takes her there. Suddenly when Tink notices Peter falling down from high below, she attempts to save him only for Tink to be captured by Mr. Smee in his beanie, placing her into a lantern where she is held captive at the Jolly Roger just as Smee holds the lantern where she is trapped. Soon as Captain Hook is sending his crew to kill Wendy, Michael, John, and the Lost Children, Tink worriedly notices Hook's evil plans.\n\nThe next day, Mr. Smee holds the lantern where Tinker Bell is trapped which as she notices Wendy who is about to walk the plank by falling into the ocean, Tink manages to free herself from the lantern she was trapped (also destroying the lantern Mr. Smee was holding) just as Tink manages to save Wendy from falling into the ocean. All of a sudden, Tink provides the Pixie Dust effect onto Hook's ship, causing the ship to float into the air while Hook tells his crew to get the ship back into the water. As Peter Pan takes on Captain Hook in battle, Tink joins in the battle in fighting off Hook's pirates, alongside Wendy, Michael, John, the Lost Children, and Tiger Lily.\n\nWith Captain Hook and his crew defeated, Tinker Bell remains onboard the Jolly Roger as Wendy returns back home to London. After Wendy reunites with her parents, she later bids a farewell to Peter Pan who is returning back to Neverland while Tinker Bell thanks Wendy for hearing just as Tink follows alongside Peter who is returning to Neverland. At the end of the film, Tinker Bell and Peter Pan pass by Captain Hook who is shown to have survived on shore which Hook begins to smile, implying that he has forgiven Peter.\n\nOther films[]\n\nIn the animated film The Black Cauldron, Tinker Bell can briefly be seen amongst the other sprites emerging to meet Taran and her friends.\n\nTinker Bell appears at the very end of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, first briefly seen after Roger reads Marvin Acme's will, then seen helping Porky Pig close the movie with her pixie dust.\n\nOne of the bees spit out by Roger Rabbit in Trail Mix-Up is modeled after Tink, with others modeled after Mickey Mouse, Evinrude, and the Genie.\n\nTinker Bell makes a cameo in the form of a silhouette at the end of The Lion King 1½.\n\nTink makes an appearance in the animated short Electric Holiday, sprinkling pixie dust on the entrance to a fashion show's runway, allowing the Disney characters that enter, to gain the bodies of world-renowned fashion icons as they strut down the runway.\n\nTinker Bell appears in Saving Mr. Banks, with Walt Disney (Tom Hanks), as a nod to Walt Disney's appearances on television.\n\nIn Ralph Breaks the Internet, Tinker Bell can briefly be seen on Oh My Disney, at the catering table with Peter's shadow, Grumpy, and Heihei.\n\nIn the live-action Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers movie, a bootleg version of Tinker Bell appears on a poster of Sweet Pete's own mockbuster film \"Flying Bedroom Boy\".\n\nIn Once Upon a Studio, Tinker Bell is first seen being called by Mickey and he asked her if all the employees of the Disney Animation Studio are gone, to which she nods yes.

The Guardian of Never Land informs Jake and his crew that only the pirate who truly believes in himself can save Never Land from vanishing completely, Jake must break off from the rest of his crew and go alone to save the Forever Tree. Unknown to Jake at the time, the magical ball of light sent by The Guardian to guide him on his quest to save Never Land is Tinker Bell, and furthermore, the Guardian was none other than Peter Pan, as he and Tink were testing Jake, for one day, he'll become Never Land's guardian. Peter Pan gives Jake the power to fly without pixie dust and invites Jake to explore the worlds beyond Never Land but he'd have to part with his friends.\n\nWhile flying with Tinker Bell and Peter Pan, Jake cannot shake the feeling that his crew may need his help and quickly soars back to Pirate Island. Jake is right to worry; Captain Hook returns, trapping Izzy, Cubby, and Skully in a cage and attempting to smash the Team Treasure Chest open until Jake, Tinker Bell, and Peter Pan intervene. Forcing Captain Hook to retreat but not empty-handed, he manages to capture Tinker Bell and use her pixie dust on the Jolly Roger, granting the ship flight and allowing Hook the means to plunder the riches beyond the Never Sea.

Her first appearance is in \"Quite a Common Fairy\", where Tinker Bell is portrayed as a fairy among the ranks of the Blue Fairy. When the young Regina fell from her balcony, Tink saves her life by using her pixie dust to allow Regina flight. Afterward, the two form a friendship of sorts. However, the Blue Fairy detested the relationship and forbids Tinker Bell to continue to see Regina. This induced Tink to prove to the Blue Fairy that Regina can find good despite her background. To mend Regina's broken heart, Tinker Bell decides to guide Regina to a tavern that would offer a man with a lion tattoo that would bring a better life for Regina, unfortunately, Regina's fear of moving on from her past love prevents her from meeting the person. When Tink returns, Regina lies about her fear and states that she would never move on from the past and blames her incident on Tink, and coldly rejects her as a friend as well. Tink, heartbroken over this, flies off. In the sky, Tink is stopped by the Blue Fairy, who is disappointed that Tinker Bell disobeyed her order to stay away from Regina, and despite Tinker Bell's apology, strips Tinker Bell of her wings, and leaves Tinker Bell to her fate.\n\nAfter losing her status as a fairy in the Enchanted Forest, Tinker Bell, in an unknown manner, ends up living in Neverland. She becomes an ally of Peter Pan, although she is aware of his malefic nature. It infers that she is for his service possibly to be able to survive on the island. But she always waited for the opportunity to escape from Peter Pan and Neverland. She developed a kind of hostility with Hook, although they remain courteous from one to the other one. During the period when David, Emma, Hook, Mary Margaret, and Regina are walking through the Dark Jungle, Tinker Bell secretly spies on them. Exhausted from the long journey, Regina wipes herself with a handkerchief and unknowingly drops it onto the ground, which Tinker Bell picks up. Emma notices Regina lagging behind, and they talk for a moment. Though Emma is curious about what is her relationship with Tinker Bell, Regina would rather not go into details about the complicated history. Regina urges Emma to go ahead with the group while she rests. Once she is alone, Tinker Bell emerges from the brush to confront Regina about their \"complicated history\". The ex-fairy states she has waited a long time for this. Taunted by Regina, Tinker Bell counters by blowing poppy dust to knock her out.\n\nAt a cave, Tinker Bell binds Regina's wrists together while she is still unconscious. When Regina awakens, Tinker Bell demands answers about why she did it. Ignoring the question, Regina responds she was just a terrible fairy, but Tinker Bell pulls out a knife dipped in dream shade and presses it against her nemesis's neck. She threatens to end Regina's life, but the latter gives an even more tempting prospect by pulling out her own heart and handing it over to Tinker Bell. Regina pushes her to crush it, but an angered Tinker Bell asks why she didn't go to the inn and meet her true love. Tearfully, Regina admits to being afraid, and because of uncertainty about what she might've been without all the anger in her heart. She points out her heart is the product of not having chosen love as it is almost completely blackened, so Regina asks Tinker Bell to pick between vengeance and hope. Tinker Bell believes it's too late to backtrack, but Regina promises it won't be if she doesn't crush the heart. Wavering in her decision, she asks if Regina loves her son, Henry. After receiving an affirmative response, Tinker Bell returns the heart unscathed but warns Regina she won't be helping her find Henry, and it's possible Pan already got to him.\n\nOutside the cavern, Tinker Bell is cornered by David, Emma, Hook, and Mary Margaret, who believe she has harmed Regina. However, Regina comes out and reassures them Tinker Bell does not have bad intentions. Through much discussion, Mary Margaret convinces Tinker Bell to help them in exchange for passage to Storybrooke. She agrees to the deal and is welcomed into their campsite. Approaching Regina, Tinker Bell wants to know if she ever went back to look for the man with the lion tattoo. Regina replies she never did, which prompts Tinker Bell to say her actions were selfish. Confused, Regina doesn't understand how, so Tinker Bell makes known that her actions not only ruined her own life, but her true love's as well.\n\nVideo games[]\n\nTinker Bell has appeared in a numerous amount of video games. Some of the games she appears in include those from the Peter Pan franchise as well as the Disney Fairies franchise. She is also prominent in crossover games such as Disney Universe as a costume (which resembles her outfit from Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure). Tink appears in Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion as well.\n\nKingdom Hearts series[]\n\nTinker Bell is a recurring character in the Kingdom Hearts series, often accompanying Peter Pan in Never Land or as a summon to aid Sora. Her appearance in the series retains her feisty attitude (especially toward Wendy) but helps the player by giving them the ability to fly via pixie dust. She assumes the role of a summon in Kingdom Hearts, Kingdom Hearts II, and Chain of Memories and makes an appearance as a guide to Roxas in 358/2 Days.\n\nKinect: Disneyland Adventures[]\n\nTinker Bell plays a role in Peter Pan's Flight mini-game. She also appears in the Pixie Hollow mini-game during Fawn's story and makes an appearance during the Mickey's Soundsational Parade mini-game.\n\nDisney Infinity series[]\n\nTinker Bell appears as a cameo in the Nintendo 3DS version of Disney Infinity. When the player lands on her space, the player or CPU is allowed to switch spots with another player on the board.\n\nShe appears in Disney Infinity 2.0 as a playable, stand-alone figure.\n\nDisney Mirrorverse[]\n\nTinker Bell appears as a playable character in Disney Mirrorverse. In this reality, she is a Ranged Guardian from Neverland. Her pixie dust has been amplified by Stellar Magic, allowing her to have more control over it and creating a life-sized avatar to use in battle.\n\nDisney Parks[]\n\nPrior to 2005, the only appearances for Tinker Bell at the Disney theme parks were in the nightly fireworks shows, in which she would fly from one side of the park to the other through the fireworks, started by Walt Disney himself. The original performer for Tinker Bell was 71-year-old circus performer Tiny Kline.\n\nDisneyland Resort[]\n\nFollowing the release of the Tinker Bell film, Disneyland converted Ariel's Grotto into a representation of Pixie Hollow with the character having meet-and-greets, along with a few of her fairy friends.\n\nAt Disney California Adventure, Tinker Bell kicks off World of Color during the introduction and also appears in small snippets alongside her friends from the Disney Fairies franchise in the winter rendition of the show Winter Dreams.\n\nShe also appears alongside Peter in Mickey's Soundsational Parade.\n\nTink made a special appearance at the end of Soarin' Over California, in the finale scene above Disneyland. She appears again in Soarin' Around the World, in a new final scene, also set above Disneyland.\n\nWalt Disney World[]\n\nTink has her own spell card in the attraction Sorcerers of the Magic Kingdom known as \"Tinker Bell's Pixie Dust\". Also in the Magic Kingdom, Tinker Bell makes daily appearances riding the rear of the Peter Pan unit in the Festival of Fantasy parade.\n\nFor meet-and-greets, she can be found in the Town Square Theater on Main Street, U.S.A. just inside the park entrance in a separate room from where Mickey and Minnie can be met. Since the end of her film series, there have been very few times she appeared with her fairy friends from Pixie Hollow, indicating the Disney Imagineers have, for now, retired Vidia, Rosetta, Silvermist, Fawn, and Iridessa, from meet-and-greets among the Theme Park Characters.\n\nIn Back to Never Land, a tourist in a Goofy hat (the actor Robin Williams) is magically transformed into a cartoon \"lost boy\" so that he can learn firsthand how animation is produced. Little Robin is happy about his transformation until his host - Walter Cronkite - drops him into a background painting of a pirate ship. Robin encounters Captain Hook himself, who wants to know where Peter Pan is hiding. Tinker Bell and the Crocodile show up and help save little Robin from the notorious pirate captain. Robin compares Tink to Barbara Streisand at one point.\n\nIn Fantasmic!, Tinker Bell is summoned by Sorcerer Mickey toward the end of the show to restore the river after the Disney Villains are defeated.\n\nTink made a special appearance at the end of Soarin', in the finale scene above Disneyland. She appears again in Soarin' Around the World, in a new finale scene above Epcot, filmed specifically for that park's version of the Soarin' attraction.\n\nDisneyland Paris[]\n\nIn Disney Dreams!, Tinker Bell is called forth by Peter Pan to help restore the released magic to the Second Star to the Right and defeat Captain Hook and the Disney Villains. After successfully doing so, Peter, Wendy, and Tink enjoy a flight together.\n\nPeter Pan's Flight[]\n\nTink also has a central place in the Peter Pan's Flight attractions at the Disney Theme Parks (with the exception of Hong Kong Disneyland), all of which are located within Fantasyland. The original version at Disneyland was one of the first attractions to open with that park in 1955.\n\nDisney Fairies[]\n\nMain article: Disney Fairies\n\nIn 2005, Tinker Bell became the lead character for her own line of licensed products called Disney Fairies. This program, a spin-off of the popular Disney Princess line (which she was a part of before this new franchise started) includes toys, accessories, clothing, Halloween costumes, books, and a direct-to-video movie series. The first book in the series, titled Fairy Dust and the Quest for the Egg, was written by Ella Enchanted author Gail Carson Levine. In it, Tinker Bell, who lives in a secret place within Neverland called Pixie Hollow, and three of her fairy friends are faced with the task of protecting the egg responsible for keeping Neverland's inhabitants forever young, pretty, and beautiful.\n\nAlthough she had been capable of speaking in Disney comics, Tinker Bell never had a voice in Disney films and television shows, always having been mute and using pantomime to communicate with humans. This changed with the release of her self-titled direct-to-video movie, which takes place before the events of the 1953 Peter Pan film. Late actress Brittany Murphy was initially chosen to provide Tink's voice in the film; however, due to scheduling conflicts, she was replaced by Mae Whitman, who said in an interview with USA Today:\n\n\"Kids will like Tink's energy and feistiness because it never comes from a malicious place. It's always out of the goodness of her pure heart.\"\n\nOther voices in this film include Anjelica Huston as Queen Clarion, Raven-Symoné (of Disney Channel's That's So Raven) as Iridessa, Kristin Chenoweth as Rosetta, America Ferrera as Fawn, British actress Jane Horrocks as Fairy Mary, Loreena McKennitt as the narrator, Jesse McCartney as Terence, and Kathy Najimy as the Minister of Summer. Several sequels followed. A preview clip of the movie aired on ABC during a telecast of Peter Pan on July 26, 2008. In the clip, Tink tries to teach a baby bird to take flight, with embarrassing results. The television debut of the film aired on November 30, 2008, on Disney Channel.\n\nDisney Fairies book series[]\n\nIn The Trouble with Tink, Tink loses her hammer in a game of fairy-tag. She borrows a hammer from a carpenter-talent fairy, but it is too big and ruins everything she had fixed. After so many mistakes, the other fairies begin to think that she has lost her talent, including Terence and Queen Clarion. Even the other tinker talents decide that Angus and Zuzu will fix Queen Clarion's bathtub instead of Tink. Worried about seeing Peter Pan, she tells Terence what happened and he offers to go with her.\n\nWhen they get there, Peter pretends to mistake them for butterflies, saying he is going to catch them and put them in his butterfly collection. Peter thought the prank is extremely funny, but neither Tink nor Terence shares the sentiment. However, giving back Tinker Bell's spare hammer makes her think much more fondly of him again and she promises - and means - to visit him again soon.\n\nAt the beginning of Vidia and the Fairy Crown, when she is seen talking to Rani about the Queen's arrival day party, Vidia makes a comment that she wishes to steal the Queen's crown. Tink later accuses Vidia of taking it when it goes missing. She appears again at the end during Vidia's hearing, accusing her again.\n\nIn Rani and the Mermaid Lagoon, Tink comforts Rani when she is not allowed to do the top fountain for the Fairy Dance, because of Mother Dove's wings. At the dance, Rani causes a disaster when she falls off Mother Dove's back, and Tink, Fira, and Terence save her. Rani runs away and Tink tries unsuccessfully to find her. When Rani comes back, Tink is excited to see her again.\n\nIn Fira and the Full Moon, she appears during the arrival of Sparkle, Helios, and Glory. While Tink is showing Fira her kettle that she fixed, the triplets burn a metal sheet of Tink. But Tink was too caught up in fixing it to be mad.\n\nTink is seen briefly during dinner in Prilla and the Butterfly Lie when Queen Clarion announces the outbreak of fairy pox.\n\nShe appears briefly in Silvermist and the Ladybug Curse at the fairy picnic, playing games with the other fairies.\n\nIn Iridessa, Lost at Sea, Tink helps Iridessa with ideas about how to get rid of the fairies' owl problem. They have a fight about what they should do, Tink goes to find a bottle and Iridessa goes after her. They accidentally get trapped in the bottle and thrown off the ship. They encounter several creatures along the way including a sea turtle, the mermaids Numi and Oola, and a colorful crab. They make a boat out of the bottle that gets washed along the shore when Beck finds them and helps them back to Pixie Hollow. The light talents then help put sunbeams in the bottle to scare away the owl. They had put the bottle in his nest forcing him to leave.\n\nIn Four Clues for Rani, she teams up with Prilla for the Fairy Treasure Hunt. She feels bad for not being Rani's partner but had thought that she already had one.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn the original J.M. Barrie play, her small fairy's size results in her only being able to hold one feeling at a time, therefore explaining why her personality tends to go to extremes meaning when she is angry she has no counterbalancing compassion.\n\nAs revealed in numerous occasions in the films and the TV series Jake and the Never Land Pirates, due to Tinker Bell's small size, she and the human characters need to be in close proximity with each other in order for them to be able to understand her fairy language which is conveyed by pantomime and her jingling sound.\n\nBecause of this, one needs to pay close attention to what Tink has to say to him/her without any noise interruptions in the background in order to better understand her nonverbal language. This is best reflected in the sequel Return To Never Land when Peter Pan silences Cubby when the latter bawls hysterically over Tinker Bell's ailing condition while Tink is communicating to Peter, so that Peter could understand what Tink is trying to say to him.\n\nIn Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue, even though Tink could speak her spoken dialogue couldn't be understood by regular humans as to humans her dialogue ends up being translated as jingling sounds, therefore resulting her to resort to using pantomime to communicate to them. This could possibly explain why outside the Tinker Bell films Tink doesn't speak but instead communicates via pantomime and her jingling sounds when within the presence of humans.\n\nThis is however contradicted in the live-action remake Peter Pan and Wendy, where Tink does not speak until during the end of the film where she thanks Wendy for hearing her which the latter clearly understood. This could imply that in the live-action remake Tink's spoken dialogue could be clearly understood by humans (albeit in close proximity), but for some reason doesn't speak to Peter and the Darlings until the ending.\n\nFrom 1994-1999, Tinker Bell appears on the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection intro logos, sprinkling pixie dust on the bare version of the logo to the completed version of the logo (a purple hump-shaped logo complete with Disney castle in the middle) while a reorchestrated version of the 1988-1994 Walt Disney Classics music plays over. In all the more recent French Disney DVD, the same introduction is used. Interestingly enough, two versions of the scene are alternatively used: one with Tinker Bell in hand-drawn animation, the other with Tinker Bell in CGI. The Hand-Drawn Version is used with the CGI films, and the CGI version is used with the hand-drawn film, as a kind of easter egg.\n\nIn Aladdin and the King of Thieves, when the title is shown, Genie briefly transforms into Tinker Bell (parodying the Disneyland show opening).\n\nFor the 2009 direct-to-DVD video film Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure, Tinker Bell was given her first new outfit in over 50 years, which reflects the autumn setting of the movie. According to Klay Hill, the director of the movie, the tomboyish look of the outfit still reveals the curves she has had since her first appearance in 1953. Her outfit is consisting of a hat, cape, long sleeve top, leggings, and boots with her familiar pom-poms.\n\nThe green hat she has along with the rest of her outfit, has a red feather, possibly alluding to Peter Pan.\n\nTinker Bell acts like the Auto-Life from the Final Fantasy series and Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days, reviving Sora if his HP is depleted.\n\nIn the 1990s, Tinker Bell appeared with a wand in the logos \"Disney at Christmas\" and \"Disney at Easter\" for ITV's Disney Christmas and Easter Movies.\n\nIn the Wizards of Waverly Place episode Fairy Tale (where Justin directs the play of Peter Pan), Alex's Tinker Bell costume looks exactly like the real one.\n\nOn October 25, 2009, an event was held at the United Nations world headquarters in New York City for the world premiere of Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure. Just before the screening of the movie, Kiyo Akasaka, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Communication and Public Information, introduced her to the audience, while Director Klay Hall and Producer Sean Lurie gave her a plaque for the work that she has done promoting environmental conservation and, perhaps most notably, for her work in a campaign for the Ad Council that she was in.\n\nIn 2010, Tinker Bell was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She is one of the few Disney characters to receive a star.\n\nTinker Bell is also considered a Disney mascot along with Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Jiminy Cricket.\n\nThe only non-fairy characters known to understand Tinker Bell completely are Peter Pan and Captain Hook, though the Lost Boys understand her to a degree.\n\nDespite being one of Disney's most iconic performing characters, Tinker Bell has never sung in a film, nor has she had a song that can be easily attributed to her sung by another character or off-screen.\n\nTinker Bell's arrival day is November 19, as evidenced by the Nintendo DS game. It appears that time passes differently in Pixie Hollow compared to how it does on the Mainland. You can clearly see that the winter fairies are just returning home from the Mainland in groups a few hours after Tinker Bell's arrival. In the game, the starting date for Tinker Bell (though the player is supposed to put in his or her own birthday) is November 19.\n\nIn Secret of the Wings, there is a scene in which Tink and Periwinkle list things they have in common by making tally marks on an ice wall. If one were to count all the markings, it would show that the two sisters have 120 things in common with each other.\n\nTink is mentioned in Skye Sweetnam's song \"Baby Doll Gone Wrong\".\n\nShe is also mentioned in the Ruth B. song \"Lost Boy\", specifically in the line listing the main characters, \"Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, Wendy Darling...\"\n\nIt is quite strange that Tinker Bell is making a pact with Hook, the man who has failed to kill Zarina, one of her own friends. However, it is possible she does not recognize nor remember Hook from his youth, most likely because she never actually interacted with Hook in The Pirate Fairy film.\n\nTink has been featured on more Peter Pan merchandise than any other character in the movie.\n\nTinker Bell was born approximately 6 seconds before Periwinkle. It is easy to tell which is which by their voices, observing their necks, and Tinker Bell's position: Tinker Bell, in the first movie and in the scene where Tinker Bell and Periwinkle watch how they came to, does not wear a collar, and her position is to the left, which is the direction Queen Clarion is shown to be entering after her birth. Periwinkle is shown to be wearing a collar, and her position is to the right.\n\nTinker Bell is the inspiration of the Fairies of The Legend of Zelda series, specifically Navi and Tati.\n\nBecause The Legend of the NeverBeast was the last film in the Tinker Bell series, it remains unknown how Tinker Bell came to meet Peter Pan. However, the early draft of the first film, as well as a cancelled eighth and final installment of the Tinker Bell series [2], were originally going to show how Tinker Bell met Peter.\n\nThe early draft of the first Tinker Bell film would show Tinker Bell traveling to the mainland to restore children's belief in fairies. During the journey, she would meet Peter Pan and the Lost Boys, who were kidnapped by Captain Hook and enslaved in the boiler room of a barge ship in London. However, John Lasseter viewed the story to be \"virtually unwatchable\" and interfered with the original storyline of the 1953 film, thus the original film and draft were scrapped.\n\nTinker Bell had unknowingly met both major characters before her adventures with them and Peter Pan began. Wendy Darling was the child that owned the music box Tinker Bell fixed and eventually returned to in the first Tinker Bell film, and during The Pirate Fairy film, Tinker Bell met Captain Hook in his youth, in which he became the former ally of Tink's friend Zarina. However, it is unknown why she did not recognize or remember both of them when they met again during Peter Pan's adventures.\n\nIn Return to Never Land, it is revealed that she needs children to believe in fairies in order to survive, as any disbelief in fairies on the child's part could lead to her demise.\n\nIt is unknown if all of Tinker Bell's other fairy companions from the Tinker Bell films such as Iridessa, Fawn, Rosetta, etc. also share this exact same weakness.\n\nRegarding on that topic, there is quite an inconsistency between the idea that, as shown in Return to Never Land, Jane's disbelief in fairies hurts Tink's feelings so badly that it causes Tink to die, and in Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue where Dr. Griffiths' blatant disbelief in fairies isn't at all fatal to Tink, as while it hurts Tink's feelings, Tink was still able to angrily retaliate against him, implying that a child's disbelief in fairies is far more hurtful to Tink (and possibly other Pixie Hollow fairies) than an adult's disbelief in fairies.\n\nIn the book Disney Trivia from the Vault - Secrets Revealed and Questions Answered by Dave Smith, Dave mentioned that Tinker Bell is sometimes mistaken to be modeled after Marilyn Monroe, since Peter Pan was released in the same year when Marilyn Monroe was at the peak of her popularity, in 1953.\n\nIn the original novel, it is thought that Tink dies shortly after the conclusion of the novel, as the year-later epilogue when Wendy asks Peter about Tinker Bell for him to respond that he completely forgot she existed, as well as the fact that Neverland fairies in general are said to have very short lifespans and therefore do not live long.\n\nShe, however, is revived in its sequel, Peter Pan in Scarlet, due to the wish of a silly blue fairy called Fireflyer who wants to meet her after hearing about her from Wendy. They go on to get married, have adventures, and sell dreams to pirates.\n\nThese facts are all heavily contradicted in the sequel Return to Never Land where Tinker Bell still remained alive and Peter still remembers her, even after Wendy and her brothers left Neverland.\n\nIn the J.M. Barrie play on which the original movie is based, it was mentioned that Tinker Bell is a tinker who mends the pots and kettles. This was most likely the inspiration for Tink's full-time occupation as a tinker fairy the Tinker Bell film series.\n\nSimilarly, in the original J.M. Barrie novel, it is stated that there are other fairies in Neverland besides Tinker Bell. This was most likely the inspiration for the entire Disney Fairies franchise.\n\nThough Fireflyer, the silly blue fairy from Peter Pan in Scarlet (the sequel to the original Peter Pan novel Peter and Wendy), does not appear in the Tinker Bell films, let alone the entire Disney Fairies franchise in general, Tink's birth in the first Tinker Bell film (as well as other Pixie Hollow fairies in general, including her twin sister Periwinkle) largely parallels how Firefly was born in Peter Pan in Scarlet, which is via a baby's first laugh. Tink and Peri's births are revealed to come from the exact same baby's laugh from Bloomsbury, London, England, as revealed in both Tinker Bell and Secret of the Wings.\n\nIn the Peter Pan films Tink's entire body turns fiery red when she is angry. But in the Tinker Bell films, however, only her face that turns red.\n\nTink's appearance in the live-action remake Peter Pan & Wendy is heavily altered from her original 1953 appearance, largely in part of her portrayer Yara Shahidi, where her appearance in that film co-incidentally bears a striking resemblance to that of Iridessa from the Tinker Bell films, albeit with her clothing recolored green like the tinker fairies. Whether this co-incidental resemblance is intentional or not is unknown.\n\nTinker Bell served as the inspiration for the character of Joy, one of the five characters as the emotions of Riley Andersen from the 2015 Disney/Pixar movie Inside Out.\n\nIn the original movie, Margaret Kerry, Tinker Bell's live-action reference model, also voiced one of the red-haired mermaids.\n\nIn earlier versions of Ralph Breaks the Internet, Tinker Bell originally had a larger role in the film, where Ralph, Vanellope, and Yesss all visited Oh My Disney, but the fairy throws pixie dust on Ralph, causing him to insult her by calling her \"Stinker Smell\". This was, however, deleted as she only appears in a small cameo role in the final cut of the film.\n\nWhen the Disney Princess franchise was formed, Tinker Bell was part of it, along with Snow White, Cinderella, Aurora, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, Pocahontas, Esmeralda, and Mulan. She, along with Esmeralda, remained in the franchise until 2004, appearing in many products, and even in some events. However, since 2005, she and Esmeralda have not been seen along with the other Princesses in any product, or event related to the franchise.\n\nTinker Bell, on the other hand, was fortunate to spawn a franchise centered around her after being dropped from the Princess franchise, Disney Fairies.\n\nTinker Bell is one of the five unofficial Disney Princesses to get a Classic doll at the Disney store in 2020, alongside Alice, Wendy Darling, Esmeralda, and Megara.\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nTinker Bell on Wikipedia\n\nTinker Bell on the Disney Fairies Wiki\n\nMedia Films: Peter Pan (soundtrack/video) • Return to Never Land (soundtrack/video) • Tink • Peter Pan & Wendy (soundtrack)\n\nShorts and Specials: The Walt Disney Christmas Show • Reading Magic with Figment and Peter Pan • You Can Fly!: The Making of Peter Pan\n\nVideo Games: Kingdom Hearts • Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories • Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days • Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep • Peter Pan: Adventures in Never Land • Peter Pan: The Legend of Never Land • Disney Universe • Kinect: Disneyland Adventures • Epic Mickey series • Disney's Villains' Revenge • Disney Sorcerer's Arena • Return to Never Land\n\nBooks: Never Never • Peter Pan and Wendy: The Junior Novelization\n\nDisney Parks Fantasy Springs • The Annex • Adventure Isle • Back to Never Land • Disney Animation Building • It's a Small World • Mickey's PhilharMagic • Peter Pan's Flight • Peter Pan’s Never Land Adventure • Storybook Land Canal Boats • Midship Detective Agency\n\nEntertainment: Believe!
