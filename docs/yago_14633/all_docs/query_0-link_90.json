        "text": "Hi I used to visit the old Warners Holiday Camp back in 1970 - 1972. I was Thirteen at the time. My uncle was the head chef there. We used to spend most of my summer holidays from school there. I used to help out in the kitchens. My uncle used to give me tasks to complete, I remember him letting me make the small individual trifles, and then going out into the dinning room to let everyone know that I'd made them. We lived and still do in Deal, my uncle told me off in 1971 because I had cycled all the way there from Deal. He wouldn't let me cycle back, he put me on the train. It's a pity the old camps gone, I loved it there. Alas my uncle has passed away since then back 1n 1984, His name was Ronnie Bamford in case anyone doe's remember him.Dear Yvonne Hayter (nee Taylor)\n\nEpisode 5\n\nWhilst not a pupil at Airedale School, I remember Mrs Rooke and her daughter, and some 18 months ago, corresponded with Anne Rooke's daughter on one of Trevor Edwards' Isle of Sheppey websites. I knew some children who attended Airedale, on the corner of Glenwood Drive; they included Russell Carlson, my first childhood friend (I was told he'd passed away (Cancer, in the early 1980's, though how accurate that is, I do not know), and Dr Hamish Wylie's children. As for you going to the convent in 1954, I remember food rationing coming to an end in that year, and going to the cinema (The Ritz) with my parents to see the film Beau Brummel starring Elizabeth Taylor and Stewart Granger. I became a pupil at the convent in late 1955, but my time there was dolorous and I could not wait to leave in 1966. As you probably know, the school was sold around 1992 and has been turned into a small housing development. You may also know Madame Anselm passed away, I think, in the 1980's, also Cancer. I remember you taking part in the 1958 production of Midsummer Night's Dream in which you played one of the tradesmen/strolling players of Athens.\n\nEpisode 6 to come. Dear Yvonne Hayter (nee Taylor)\n\nEpisode 3\n\nAs said, we first met in 1952, and during that era, my parents attended Christmas parties at your home. If you had a piano, and of that, I am not sure, it is likely my mother played the instrument; something, I still do, much as your mother gave you a love of horses and taught you to ride. At one of the parties, I can even remember what I wore; a red velvet skirt and short sleeved white blouse with red stitching. Maybe, my mother bought it at The Kiddies' Store on Sheerness High Street, or a shop on Broadway (just down from Humphreys - baker and snooty caf√© - where so-called Sheppey 'society' met for cream cakes and slagging off sessions) that also sold clothes for children. One Christmas, Uncle Alf and Aunt Marjorie gave me a small doll, made of a china texture as opposed to plastic, and dressed in a cherry red jumper, trousers and hat. Unfortunately, I never played with dolls, but, kept it for a very long time. Even now, I can remember my mother saying one 26 December, 'Oh, Alf has gone to a football match'. Did Sheerness have a team? That's it for now, in case I type too many words, but episode 4 to follow. Dear Yvonne Hayter (nee Taylor),\n\nEpisode 2\n\nWe first met in 1952 when I was 4 years old. Our parents knew each other, and I well remember, as a very small child coming up to the stables. Your garden/lawn were on the left, with the stables on the same side, further ahead, before I walked up to a gate, behind which was a paddock/field with jumps. Behind that and slightly to the right was a small copse that frightened me a little as it seemed dark and spooky, but, such are small children; behind that copse was The Glen. I also remember a local proliferation of Foxgloves, in season, especially, when waking along a small pathway that was reached, when leaving your property, by turning left, then sharp left to climb a slightly steep area. As the level settled, walking back to Minster, I could look down towards a good view of your property on the left. I had forgotten, if, indeed, I ever knew, the name, Casita, and it is lovely you still live there, as the late Angela Fray (nee Hale [another convent schoolgirl])lived at Scocles Court until her death in 2015. I will try to send Episode 3 tomorrow. Thinking on it, as I have, I am sure the Russells lived at 22 Bramston Road, and for I know, some may still be on the island. Otherwise, you say you went to Minster Primary School, so, perhaps, the name Peter Harcup and Joan Frost are familiar to you? Also, you may have known a boy named Ian Cox who lived just opposite my former home at 368 Minster Road? Otherwise, if you type in, say, 368 Minster Road Google, you can get on to the road, and if you have the patience, follow it up towards Minster Village. Along the way is your old school, though it now seems to be a 'gentrified'/residential complex. I do remember going to the school as I was press-ganged into joining the Guides who held their weekly meetings there; yikes, they were dreary. Also, the row of, presumably, Victorian terrace houses just opposite, have long gone. In fact, it is quite a shock to see some of the changes, but, that's life. If the Tudors could come back to Minster, given those changes, can you imagine the impact on them? Yes, there was a small sweetshop on the left hand side as you went down Minster Hill. It was situated on the corner by the road that runs around the back towards Scocles Road, and stood opposite The Prince of Waterloo public house. I do not remember the name of the shop, but, it was run by a Mrs Griffiths who had black hair with a rigid middle parting and gave the impression of being a veritable pillar of the community. Another shop, also on the left on the way down, was run by Mr and Mrs Kerry (butchers). Mr Kerry was very lean and dark haired with a 'spiv' style moustache, whilst his wife, a blonde, was larger, and kept a yapping poodle. Otherwise, the Newsagent in the village was originally run by a Mr and Mrs Robertson before the Feltons took over, whilst Mrs Thomsett ran the fish shop, Mr Hodges was the greengrocer, Mr Roberts had a grocery shop, and there was also a hardware shop, a junk shop and even a small jewellery shop by the side of the huge set of stone stairs that led/lead down to the lower road. Plus, three pubs,a hairdresser and one of the Ingletons ran a post office as you left the village and headed for Eastchurch. I went to Airedale School in the late 70's. I remember Mr and Mrs Rook very well along with lots of fond memories of playing rounders on the field, the sink on the playground with the plastic cups for a drink of water and lining up to wash your hands in the kitchen before lunch. I also remember always volunteering for litter picking when it was time to read aloud from the bible once a week. One of the best things was the girls summer uniform, I remember spinning around and around sending the skirt flying out on the sides and the straw hat. However, I was never picked to take Mrs Rooks tea upstairs to her and I was desparate to see the upstairs of the house. When I left there I went onto Danley Middle School which I found a huge shock after Airedale and I didnt cope very well. We moved away in my second year at Danley and I was given the chance of a fresh start which I embraced wholeheartedly!Message to Jo (we corresponded briefly earlier in the year when I wrote in to say I remembered Airedale, the old coach your mother used as studio etc). I have just read you are moving to Ontario. Yikes it is a long way to move and you seem very brave. Have visited that great country three times, and once took a train from Toronto to Jasper, before taking the bus into Vancouver; great fun to stop at Edmonton, Saskatchewan and the other towns you read about in the geography books at school as a little girl. If you have not done the train journey, it is fantastic, and Jasper is one of the most peaceful places I have ever visited. I am sure returning to Sheppey to visit The Glen, Harty Church and, of course, Airedale, will be emotional and though you are moving far away, I hope that does not stop you from commenting in the future on Trevor Edwards' great website. All the best for your new life in Canada. M-F CResponse to Jo/Guest. When I read your first email (13.01.13), apart from remembering the facts I included in my response re Airedale School, something 'clicked' way back in my mind that went, 'Yes, I remember the grown ups (probably Mrs Carlson, Mrs Dixon, and certainly, my mother) chatting and mentioning your mother was an artist, and that Harty connection', which is why I asked if she had painted there. Upon reading your email (21.01.13)in which you mentioned the bus, yes, there was another click. I do remember that bus and it was parked, as you say, at the top of Glenwood Drive, and I am sure, just opposite a small bungalow covered with pebble dash before one walked into The Glen. I am also sure it was a single decker, and possibly khaki green, but, will stand corrected on the colour. I had not realised it was an artist's studio and how very enterprising of your mother. As for the local farmer, I wonder if it was Mr Kite? I am impressed that two of your mother's works have been exhibited at the Royal Academy, and despite barely knowing a paint brush from a palette, I attend odd exhibitions, visiting the Holbein exhibition at The Tate in 2006 (you may know his portraint of Henry VIII was loaned by the Thyssen Museum (Madrid), along with a Jane Seymour from Vienna, and their child Edward from Washington DC, and it is believed that was the first time all three pictures had been hung together in centuries); the Van Dyke exhibition (also at the Tate), and the Royal Academy last year to see an exhibition of Zoffany. Do you paint? Otherwise, Trevor Edwards, the gentleman who has put the Sheppey website together, has done wonders, and did you know there are a series of sites about the island; e.g. Leysdown, Minster, Eastchurch, Warden, and, of course Harty. Given your mother's connections, it might be fun to add a comment to the Harty site? The comment by a lady named Jo certainly, 'Rings Bells with me'. As a little girl, I lived further up Minster Road at number 368 that, in those days, was a police house, and I still have many pictures of that time. Although, I was not a pupil at Airedale School, a little boy I knew, Russell Carlson, who lived at 372 Minster Road, was a pupil at Airedale, before going on to Borden Grammar. I understand he passed away in the early 1980's. Yes, I knew the Dixon girls, Anne, Isabelle, Nicky and Linda (Fiona was a later addition) and used to play at their farm at the end of Oak Lane. I also knew Susan Love who was a fellow pupil at the convent in Sittingbourne. Other Airdale pupils may have included Dr Hamish Wylie's children. I did not know Mrs Rooke, but, knew who she was, and remember seeing her outside the school which, I think, was on the corner of Glenwood Drive. I also remember Anne Rooke and the fact she was an artist seemed very exciting to residents in Minster Road. Did she ever paint scene out at Harty? I have just come across this site while researching my family tree. I lived in Sittingbourne but attended Sheerness Tech until I left in 1960 to join the RAF. Now, many years later and after a couple of tours overseas, I live near Gatwick Airport. I have read some of the recollections about the Tech - I remember Mr Kitkat very well. I also remember Mr (Bill) Barnett who someone mentioned. I was there from 1955-1960 and have been trying to recall some of the other teachers there. I can remember Luland, Hutley, Lifton, Macarthur, Holt, Ryder, Hawkes and Ducy but there are several whose names I have forgotten (one was known as Algy because his initials were L G, but I cannot recall his surname). Twice during that time the King's Ferry Bridge (the old one) got hit and stuck in the up position and we had to go home by tug from Sheerness Dockyard via Gillingham. Still, at least we got a week off school each time.I love the isle of Sheppey, it was our holiday place when me and my sister were children,we wernt told that we were going until just the day before as we would get far too excited,when,we would pack up all our things in our dads old red cortina and off we set, when we clapped eyes on the bridge,well the excitment was so intense,the first place that came to mind was Leysdown,begging our parents to go there first, we would always have to stop at the halfway house so that dad could have a pint,we had to go in the childrens room it was great.we would somehow find the old caravan that we had booked for the week,it was always a bit meldew but we didnt care,then straight to Leysdown to the arcades and bumper cars, paddling in the see and looking for crabs.It was brilliant..My mum has just recently moved to Minster and loves it , my aunt and uncle have had several caravans on the island since the 1960s they now have a chalet in eastchurch.I often go and stay with my mum and love it ....I lived on Sheppey between 1955 and 1973 before being whisked off to Melbourne where I still live. I have so many precious memories of my childhood there and how free to roam and healthy we were despite sleeping in damp houses and the lack of daily showers! As a child in Queenborough, summers were spent walking my dog Tim from the Creek to Bluetown or sitting for hours in a tree that hung over into High St and watched the continual flow of super-quirky Q'bro-ites. After moving to Minster, winter hols were spent at the Reeds Farm in Parsonage Chase and summer at the beach ALL day with a bottle of water, a jam sandwich and a few bob for an icecream. Perfick!\n\nI then spent 4 years at Rochester Art College '68-72. While living on the Thames Lighter barge that was moored in The Creek I was married at Q'bro Church and quite a crowd was gathered outside due to a rumour that the bride would be wearing jeans! (I was somewhat 'alternative' at the time). I am returning to Shep next month for the 10th time and despite all the changes and loss of 'green space', for me, it still feels like my home.Hi there. For a number of years I have been trying to trace my dad, his name is Alan John Davis and his last know address was 72 James Street, Sheerness, it says on my birth certificate that he was a painter, I do not have any more info on him, only his name and the address, I was born in 1957 and lived at the above dress with my brother Roydon, dad and mam who's name was Hilda, she died when i was nine in 1966, i was brought up by my gran up north who wouldnt tell me anything about my dad. If anyone could point me in the right direction as to where i could start looking again it would be much appreciated. Hope you all had a good christmas and all the best for the new year. Jane.hello it is matthew again i told my friend connor about it and we all went down the hole apart from adam because he was going out that day on the 3rd of augest 2008 first connor went down then me then taylor. when we all was down there we was going to look round the corner because we had a torch. but when we all was about to look round the corner........ we all got abit scared of what was behind there,and we all thought we saw something move round the corner so we got out and just tried to make the hole bigger but it did not work much because we only have a hammer. but today i threw the hammer into the cenal because a police car drove past sloley so we all ran out of that erea,and we ran across the road but that probally made us all looking suspictious to the police but when i looked round the corner again the police went to the park for a different reason. my freind adam told me that the other bomb shelter or air raid shelter got fully filled with cement a few days back and that the council are going to fill the other one we found up in a couple of days or weeks what shall we do???? do you think we can get them not to cement it all up??? and maybe ask if they could make it into a little underground play erea for people??? what do you think about it all........hello my name is matthew and i have two friends called adam and taylor. we was walking along behind my house and we had a little base. it was just an area where there was a gap of trees so we usauly hang out there. but on the second of augest 2008 we went there and there was some concrete at both ends which we knew about, but when we went there on that day there was a hole in each sides of the concrete i am twelve adam is twelve and taylor is eleven. there was a small hole in one end and a big hole in the other end,(just enougth room for us to get down there) but we did not go down there.it was an air raid shelter from world war 2. and we saw a mask down the big hole so i went home and got me fishing net,i plled the mask out and it was burnt on the back we looked at the tree next too the hole and there was realy bad scratch marks on it that no knife ir tool could do so we went up the hill and chucked it in the cenal.we went back down and we looked at the edges of the hole and it looked like something got out from the shelter but..... it has been all concreted up for at least 66 years and we are trying to make the hole bigger so we could go down there.... would it be safe???? what do you think it was???/or who?? and when i last looked dow there i saw something black move round the corner.. only me adam and talor knows so should we tell any1 to be on the safe side and i was gonna see if i could get a camra there over night would that be good or do you think we should stay away from it or stay away and get the council or someone to fill it up with concrete???? and there is a little tunnel bit that leads to the magazine which is a big rock thing that people go on at the park. you cant get inside it but we was thinking maybe when we get the hole big enougth then we could go and look?? do you think we should go down there at least with our mum or dads and maybe someone from the council because nowone els knows they just think it is cemented up still and what do you think????Well I was supposed to be cleaning the house to day, but I stumbled upon this fantastic site and I have been rivieted to my seat all day, and I mean all day, I have looked at every picture they are fantastic keep it up, I wish I had some photos to offer you, I loved the leysdown photos and was surprised at there once being a picturdrome in queenborough, I would be curious to know who the people are in the little boat on the pleasure beach at leysdown, the man is wearing a white cap to one side of his head and they are in a boat marked number 2, as think these people are my grandparents, I also remember the stage 3 night club in leysdown and I also remember the bus station when it was converted into a pub, I wonder if there are any pictures of that about, and I would love to see a picture of the old cinama that was in wood street sheerness, I tried to find pictures before but have never had any joy. I have had a great mornig looking at all these great pictures and I will check back for any updates. Thankyou from Kelly.Fantastic pictures, I was born in Minster hospital and lived there till I was 15, though I only moved to Maidstone which is 25 miles away! Some of my family still live on the island and my sister is buried at Half Way Cemetry, while my brother is buried in the old cemetry near the Abbey in Minster.\n\nI am now retraining and studying to teach English as a foreign language, and have been looking for a picture of my old school Holy Trinity in sheerness (the school has been demolished and is now a car park - though the church still stands). I went to school in about 1953, and then went onto the grammar school in Sittingbourne in 1964.\n\nFantastic pictures, brings back wonderful memories - but life is not the same there now, most of the areas I played in have been built on though the 'Bunny bank' at the Glen is still there, and we still go blackberrying every autumn.\n\nThanks very much for the memories!\n\nLinda Allen"
