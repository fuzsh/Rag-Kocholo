A Little Princess: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack

AllMusic; Amazon; Apple Music; Discogs; Last.fm; Spotify; Wikipedia

This is the soundtrack/score to the movie A Little Princess. It was released in 1995, but I must not have gotten it until at least 2013, after I watched the movie. It was composed by Patrick Doyle. The album has 28 tracks, most of them quite short, some even less than a minute long. I don't feel the need to list them all by name, as I do in most of my music reviews.

So, I don't have much to say about individual tracks. I will say they're mostly instrumental, though some tracks include a choir, or a solo singer. The first couple have an Indian flair to them (as do some of the later tracks), because the movie starts in India. The third one is a waltz, so more European (though most of the movie is spent in New York). Most of the tracks sound like Western classical music. I quite like track 16, "Tyger Tyger", though it's only half a minute. But really I like the whole soundtrack. Track 19, "Kindle My Heart", is sung by Abigail Doyle (Patrick's daughter), and it's another one that has an Indian sound to it. Very nice. The final track is listed on the CD as "The Goodbye", and it includes a reprise of "Kindle My Heart", this time sung by the movie's star, Liesel Matthews. But that's just a small part of it. (It's the longest track on the album, at 4:19, mostly instrumental.) And... I don't know what else to say.
