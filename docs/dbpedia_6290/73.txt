One of the most exemplary children's films ever made, Alfonso Cuaron's A Little Princess (1995) is the perfect antidote to the empty, action-oriented projects that plague young people's cinema. Based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's book, the film stars Liesel Matthews as 11-year-old Sara Crew, raised by her father (Liam Cunningham) in India until he joins the allied effort in WWI. Patrick Doyle's eclectic score is one of the finest of our day, combining stylistic influences ranging from Purcell to Ravel, and incorporating authentic Indian ragas and sitars ("Ramayana"). Equally memorable are the 19th-century waltzes, yearning clarinet solos for Sara ("Alone"), and several impressionistic passages for harp and keyboards ("Knowing You By Heart"). There are also haunting songs set to poems by William Blake ("On Another's Sorrow"), performed by members of the New London Children's Choir. The main vocal set-piece is "Kindle Your Heart," an enchanting theme performed by Abigail Doyle (the composer's daughter) and star Matthews in separate performances. For Sara's inevitable but welcome reunion with her father, the composer begins with an intimate string quartet, before expanding his palette to an octet and, finally, a full recapitulation of "Kindle Your Heart". --Kevin Mulhall
