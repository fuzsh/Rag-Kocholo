        "text": "I graded this movie as an A+ in visuals by the wonderful, hard-working animators at Pixar, and A+ for music in the score by Patrick Doyle, but only a B for story. A “B” isn’t really that bad, (and still above average), but it’s just not nearly as good as I’ve come to expect from a Pixar film.\n\nThe tagline for Brave was “change your fate,” and I’m sure if you saw the ubiquitous trailer this summer, you heard the line, “if ya had the chance to change yer fate, wouldja?” (spoken in a Scottish accent), but I wouldn’t really say that’s the main theme in this movie, –I would say it’s about the consequences our actions can have, and the importance of reconciliation. (It’s also not really about being brave, so neither the title nor the tagline are terribly appropriate).\n\nScottish princess Merida of the Dunbraugh clan is “destined” to marry the heir of one of her father’s allied clans. Merida’s mother is frustrated that her daughter doesn’t seem serious about applying any of her lessons in ladylike behavior and queenly decorum, and the heroine is equally frustrated that her mother doesn’t appreciate her interests and skills in horse-riding and archery and her disinterest in an arranged marriage. Mother and daughter share a simultaneous line in split-screen about wanting the other to listen to her point of view.\n\nThe Queen does put an unbearable pressure on Merida when she tells her, “above all, a princes strives to be perfect,” as if that were attainable, and really doesn’t seem to understand her daughters anxiety and dread of betrothal with a throwaway “Oh, Merida, it’s marriage, it’s not the end of the world!” For her part, Merida spits a very hurtful line at her mother, shouting, “I’ll never be like you! I’d rather die than be like you!” as she slashes the family tapestry that her mother has been sewing all her life in two. The Queen responds by throwing Merida’s beloved bow into the fire. Both are deeply, justifiably hurt.\n\nMerida runs away and comes across a witch, from whom she buys “a spell to change my mum. That’ll change my fate.” Surprise surprise, the spell doesn’t quite do what Merida thought it would. **SPOILER ALERT** It transforms her mother’s body into that of a bear.\n\nMerida and the bear-Queen return to the witch for help reversing the spell, but she’s gone, having left behind only a potion-operated answering service, (that is supposed to be funny but annoyed me because it was ridiculously anachronistic to the story setting.) They learn that if it is not reversed before “the second sunrise,” the spell will be permanent and the Queen will become a wild bear. The formula for reversing the spell is:\n\nFate be changed,\n\nlook inside,\n\nMend the bond\n\ntorn by pride.\n\nMerida and the bear-Queen interpret the witch’s instructions to mean that they must literally sew the family tapestry, torn apart in anger, back together. This involves sneaking the bear-Queen back into the castle and past the roomful of gathered clansmen, and Merida has to utilize the skills in diplomacy and decorum (to distract the clansmen) and domesticity (to sew up the tapestry) that her mother was always trying to impress upon her. (Earlier I guess we were supposed to think that the Queen had also come to realize the validity of Merida’s perspective, because as a bear she was quite un-ladylike and ate raw fish. I’m not sure that being physically forced by magical coercion to behave differently than you normally would counts as empathizing with someone else, but then I wasn’t convinced that the Queen didn’t really understand her daughter’s point of view to begin with, just that she didn’t place much importance on it.)\n\nAs you could probably guess, mending the tapestry does not reverse the spell, because the “bond torn by pride” was between mother and daughter. I was fully expecting Merida to have to utter the “magic” words, “I’m sorry”, but instead the movie went with the cliche and less powerful (in this situation) “I love you.” Really, Pixar?! This isn’t Beauty and the Beast! Love and forgiveness overlap, for sure, but I don’t think they are always mutually interchangeable. Merida to shouted to her mother’s face that she would rather die than be like her, she ripped apart the project her mother had spent years working on, and she tricked her mother into eating a bewitched pie to “change her.” Even if she didn’t realize it would turn her into a bear, she was purposefully manipulative, underhanded, and selfish. The appropriate thing for her to say is “I’m sorry”! (This is one of the reasons I only graded the story as a B).\n\nLooking at this positively, I guess it could be a good illustration of two scripture passages on anger. The hurtful words and actions that the Queen and Princess exchange are spoken in anger–all the trouble and hurt feelings might have been avoided if they two had tried to apply James 1:19 to their relationship, which says:\n\nMy dear brothers, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry.\n\nThe other verse this storyline made me think of was Ephesians 4:26-27:\n\nIn your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.\n\nDon’t let the sun go down (or the second sunrise come up) on your anger, or else your mother might be permanently transformed into a bear. That’s the Brave version of Ephesians 4:26. I should add that, while the Bible doesn’t place a two-sunrise time limit on reconciliation, it does urge a quick resolution to interpersonal conflict. Jesus tells us in Matthew 5:23-24 that it is more important to make our human relationships right than to observe religious rituals:\n\nTherefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.\n\nDespite the disappointingly weak and predictable storyline, the film is well worth watching just for the stunningly beautiful animation. Just look at the details in the gif below, like her pinky finger clenching, the light on the fabric moving, her ribcage expanding and contracting as she breathes. And this shot doesn’t even include her hair, which is incredible–I read that Pixar developed new software in the process of making this movie, just to animate Merida’s hair!\n\nIn conclusion, this is a good film, it’s just too bad it’s not the great one I was hoping for. The message of understanding another’s perspective and reconciling broken relationships is good, and it is one of those rare princess films where the girl has her own plot lines independent of any romantic interests. (One little girl, after seeing Brave in the theater, reported that Merida doesn’t end up with a prince because “none of them were very handsome.” -thanks EBR).\n\nLet me just start by saying that everyone should see this movie! It is my new favorite, the best that I’ve seen so far this year. It’s a story with a message about finding and embracing one’s purpose and healing from brokenness, depicted through stunning, worth-while 3D visuals, accompanied by fantastic music and wonderful acting. It’s a movie for movie-lovers, full of praise for cinema as “the world of imagination.”\n\nBased on the highly unique novel-and-picture book blend “The Invention of Hugo Cabret” by Brian Selznick, the story centers on the young orphaned protagonist Hugo, (Asa Butterfield), who is apprenticed to help keep the clocks running in a busy 1930s Parisian train station. On a quest to finish repairing the automaton he and his father used to tinker with together, Hugo gains a companion in the form of sophisticated-vocabulary-lover Isabelle, (Chloë Grace Moretz). Meanwhile, Isabelle’s godfather “Papa” Georges Méliès, (Ben Kingsley), is an angry, bitter old man inexplicably upset by the children’s endeavors.\n\nOne of the main themes in this film was purpose. Seen in a conversation over the yet-to-be-repaired Automaton:\n\nIsabelle: It looks sad.\n\nHugo: I think he’s just waiting.\n\nIsabelle: For what?\n\nHugo: To work again. To do what he’s supposed to do.\n\nAnd later, more beautifully, in an exchange between Hugo and Isabelle about how they might need to “fix” Papa Méliès:\n\nHugo: Everything’s got a purpose, even machines. Clocks tell the time, trains take you places. Maybe that’s why broken machines make me so sad–they can’t do what they’re supposed to do. Maybe it’s the same with people–if you lose your purpose, it’s like you’re broken.\n\nWhen Isabelle wonders aloud whether or not she might have a purpose, Hugo responds:\n\nMachines never come with extra parts, you know? They always come with exactly the right amount of parts they need. So I thought, if the world was one big machine, I couldn’t be an extra part. I had to be here for some reason. And that means you have to be here for some reason too.\n\nWhile there is no explicit mention of God, this metaphor of the world as a machine begs for a machine-maker, and Hugo’s assertion that everyone has a unique and necessary purpose is completely in line with scriptural passages such as 1 Corinthians 12:12-31, as well as being an inspirational sentiment. (How much more at peace might we all be if we spent more time earnestly seeking God’s purpose for us in the world, and less time chasing shallow goals to be admired and popular, or clambering to buy the products mass marketing has told us we need, or to fit the mold society has decided we should wear?)\n\nAlthough this story is fictional, many of the events and characters referenced are historical, including Méliès himself. I found it quite interesting to read up about him and some of the other historical references after viewing the movie, (though you could always read up beforehand if you don’t mind spoilers).\n\nThis film is simply terrific. I was even impressed by the Station Inspector, (Sacha Baron Cohen), whom I had expected would be nothing more than a one-dimensional source of comic relief in the for of slapstick humor, but who surprised me with his depth and humanity. (Even the “bad guys” have a purpose!)\n\nI will end with the same words that Méliès uses to introduce a viewing of his films, which highlight the imaginative participation of the audience, and may be how I need to kick off any home movie-watching parties I host in the future:\n\nAnd now, I address you all as you are: Wizards! Mermaids! Travelers! Magicians! Come and dream with me.\n\nLoved it! I wasn’t sure this movie was going to be any good. You can never tell with spin-offs, they often seem like unnecessary and lazy attempts to make more money off the success of a legitimately good film. But “Puss in Boots” was certainly not lacking in quality, and though I may have sat down with an “eh, might as well watch this” attitude, I walked out singing, toe-tapping and high-clapping praises. Like a flamenco dancer. A feline flamenco dancer, of course.\n\nThis story is meant to be a prequel of sorts to the Shrek movies, but it doesn’t feature any of the Shrek characters except Puss. (It’s his backstory.) It’s predictably fun, incorporating new variations of fairy-tale motifs and characters, and features almost totally positive messages. I absolutely recommend it.\n\nIn the opening sequence, Puss describes himself as “a bad kitty, a fugitive searching for a chance to clear my name.” Later, we see just how a misunderstanding, a deceitful friend, and Puss’s own naivite and choice to ignore another character’s warnings to “be careful of the company you keep”, (advice that echoes Proverbs 13:20), led to Puss losing “everything that I cared about; my brother, my honor, my home. All I thought about was the disappointment in my mother’s eyes, and I have been running ever since.”\n\nA reunification with his old partner in crime, Humpty Dumpty, seems to provide Puss with a chance to redeem his mistake, (which resulted in the loss of the townspeople’s money). The plot involves magic Jack-and-the-Beanstalk beans, with Humpty plotting, “we go up the beanstock outlaws, and we come back legends!” Of course everything doesn’t work out just exactly according to plan. Or, there may have been more than one version of the plan, I should say.\n\nHumpty is a pretty rotton character throughout most of the film. He’s devious, bitter, vengeful, and just plain mean. Although I feel bad for the way Humpty was bullied and ostracized as a child, I think it’s clear that much of his isolation, especially into adulthood, was of his own making. He chose to be bitter and unforgiving, and to act selfishly and dishonorably, despite his adoptive mother and best friend/adoptive brother encouraging him to be “better than this!”\n\nThe “Mama” character provides a good moral compass for the protagonists of this story. At one point she tells Puss, who has his sword drawn and is surrounded by the Comandante’s men, “Pequeño! Do not fight them, please. No more running. Please stop breaking my heart, and face what you have done.” This speech is successful in convincing Puss to surrender, but even while Puss is misbehaving it is clear that Mama carries an unconditional love for him, but that she disapproves of his choices.\n\nTowards the end, after Humpty’s evil schemes have come to light, Puss urges him to help fix the disaster he has created, saying, “It’s never too late to do the right thing!” This is a terrific message! It makes me think of Samson, who after all his mistakes asks God to grant him undeserved strength one last time.\n\n***SPOILER ALERT*** When Humpty, at the very end, decides to sacrifice himself so that Puss can save the baby goose and by extension the entire town, because “it’s the right thing to do,” he lets go of the rope they are dangling from. Puss looks down and sees that amidst his cracked shell there is not a mess of yolk but a solidly golden egg. “I always knew that you were good inside,” sighs Puss. The Mother goose scoops the golden egg up with her and flies it and the baby away to their castle in the clouds. It’s very beautiful and fitting, because when Humpty and the gang are breaking in to the beanstalk land, Humpty cries, “Look at this! It’s egg paradise! It’s so beautiful, I feel like I belong here!” So in a very real sense, what is portrayed in this story is that Humpty changes his heart and his actions, and even though it is after a lifetime of rottenness he is rewarded by being taken to Paradise. It reminds me of the Parable of the Workers in Matthew 20, where some labor all day and some only an hour, but God can reward everyone with the same price. None of us deserves heaven, but all of us have the chance to earn admittance, (which can only be by the blood of Jesus Christ), as long as we are breathing. It’s never too late to do the right thing! **END SPOILER**\n\nIt gets a little confusing at the end, because Puss ends up still being an outlaw, running from the soldiers, even though I thought part of his whole lesson was to face up to the consequences of what he had done instead of running from them? I mean, granted, it is way more fun to watch Puss and Kitty dance through the credits than it would be to watch Puss sit in jail and await trial during the credits, but still…it’s inconsistent with the main message. (Perhaps the ending is necessary to set up Puss’s eventual meeting up with Shrek and Donkey, in Shrek 2?) The other bit of content that some might find objectionable in a children’s movie is the way Puss is repeatedly referred to as “a great, great lover of women. Seriously, it is crazy!” but I think most of those references will go over kids’ heads.\n\nOverall, this was a great film. I really enjoyed it. I saw it twice, and it will definitely be joining my DVD collection.\n\nThis movie is so cute, I loved it! Classic characters, hand-drawn animation, actual children’s movie, not like so many these days where they fell compelled to wink-wink at adult content so the parents are entertained, too. I mean, parents can definitely enjoy Winnie the Pooh, but the “adult” jokes involve being able to read. Nothing dirty. And it’s not very long, just over an hour, so young children may actually be able to sit through it.\n\nThere is a short at the beginning, “The Ballad of Nessie,” about Loch Ness. It’s wonderful. Narrated with a great thick Scottish accent, with the moral, “Dinnae be afraid to cry, it really is okay. Sometimes it’s through ya’ tears t’ find a better way.” It’s adorable.\n\nThen there’s the feature presentation. I read some of the Pooh books as a child, and had at least one that was a “book on tape”. I don’t know if the voice actors for this movie are all the same as the voices I heard as a child, but they sure sounded right. Some of the songs are familiar, (“willy nilly silly old bear!”), and others were new to me. My favorite was probably the duet that Pooh sings with his hungry, growling tummy.\n\nThere is a song about a creature called a Bakson that might be a little bit frightening to very small children, but the animation for that montage is even less realistic chalk drawings and it is interspersed with humorous gags. I didn’t notice any of the kids in my theater crying. (The Bakson is a mythical creature developed when Owl mistakenly interprets a letter from Christopher Robin that says he has gone and will be “back soon”.)\n\nThroughout the story, the characters and the action interact with the narrator and text. Maybe this can be used to encourage children to read more, (or have things read to them at least.) There are also several possibilities for discussion questions to engage a child in after viewing this film; nothing too deep, but a good way to start the habit of discussing stories and noting whether or not the characters display behavior that should be mimicked. For example, you might ask how Pooh could have been kinder to Piglet, (not making him do all the hard work), how Pooh showed that he was a good friend to Eeyore, (by bringing him his tail right away instead of satisfying his own craving for honey), note how the friends all work together, or discuss how Tigger’s philosophy can apply to each of us, too, (he’s special because “he’s the only one!”). But overall it is just a very lighthearted, enjoyable children’s movie.\n\nThe best part, by far, was the Toy Story short at the beginning. I feel a little bad saying that I hated this movie, because I know it’s a very popular franchise, aimed at kids, with some sort of positive moral. I want to support Hollywood’s efforts to continue producing family-friendly fare. But I don’t think that has to be done at the expense of good storytelling. Pixar movies are usually all-around high quality, but this time it feels like they should have taken the script in for a tune-up or two before racing into theaters.\n\nThe original Cars movie worked a little better as a car-populated universe because they were confined to normal car settings; racetracks, highways, gas stations, car shops. The second movie gets global and introduces a series of spy cars, equipped with all sorts of gadgets to help conduct their spy business. It just feels a little ridiculous. I mean, James Bond has an awesome car. But he doesn’t drive it all the time. It’s not very intuitive to lower a vehicle on four cables into a warehouse to spy on the cars below, and then have to drive yourself back across the cables, or drive up a wall with magnetic wheels, or drive it over roofs. I’m sure kids won’t be bothered by it, and it’s probably not any more unrealistic than a talking car to begin with, but to me it felt like the story was stretching too far beyond the natural boundaries of such a universe. I rolled my eyes so much I was nearly dizzy.\n\nMuch of the eye-rolling came courtesy of one Tow Mater, who is certainly the central figure of this sequel. If your kid is a Lightning McQueen fan, they may be disappointed by how little screen time he gets. Mater demonstrates what a well-meaning idiot he is over and over and over again. McQueen starts out being embarrassed by him, but brings him along on his overseas tour, where he is really embarrassed, then Mater messes up McQueen’s race. Next, Mater gets caught up with the spies and is bumbling his way across Europe. Then he finds out everyone sees him as an idiot, and has flashbacks to all the bumbling idiot episodes in case we forgot what we just saw not forty five minutes ago. We get it! He’s an idiot. Personally, I don’t find ignorance that hilarious.\n\nA lot of the dialogue feels very poorly set up. It’s like one person wrote the important speeches, when characters fight or little lessons are preached, and somebody else took their work and said, okay, let’s stick that one there, and this one here. They don’t flow well.\n\nThe primary theme is about friendship, (although I think really the primary theme was about having a Cars sequel.) After disowning his friend, McQueen receives the following advice from some Italian cars:\n\n“It’s okay to fight. Everybody fights now and then, but you’d better make up fast. No fight is more important than friendship…He who find a friend, find a treasure.”\n\nThat’s a pretty simplistic statement, that no fight is more important than friendship, but it is a good message for children. The Bible tells us not to let the sun go down on our anger (Ephesians 4:26), it says to settle disputes quickly and as a priority over offering sacrifices (Matthew 5:23-26). It says that we should live peacefully with everyone, if possible (Romans 12:18). But it’s not always possible. And sometimes maintaining our convictions, or refusing to compromise God’s mandates, might be more important than staying “friends” with somebody. Jesus promised that if we live as he has shown us, we’ll have some haters, (John 15:18-25). That’s pretty complicated, and doesn’t fit into a nice kid-friendly platitude. The Cars 2 message isn’t bad, it just isn’t a good substitute for Sunday School.\n\nThe secondary message to this movie is, Big Oil is bad, alternative fuels are the obvious solution, and cars with inefficient gas mileage and unreliable parts are “losers.” That last part, in a human-populated world, might be just a statement about energy efficiency, but remember, in this universe, the cars are people. So it is essentially saying, if you came with faulty parts, you’re a loser. Haha, why didn’t you pick a better factory to be manufactured in, loser! (Or are the cars “born”? It isn’t really explained). They’re the bad guys, so it’s easy to write them off, but this subtle message is not a healthy one. It encourages mocking the misfortune of others, and doesn’t suggest that people can change and improve themselves. One character haughtily states, “Once Big Oil, always Big Oil,” justifying a mistrust in a car that had purportedly switched to green fuel. Good grief, even Twilight features vampires that strive against their human-eating nature to better themselves. Come on, Cars 2, you’re getting morally out-done by a hormonal teen romance franchise!\n\nVerdict: It’s fine. Not great, not terrible. The man sitting behind me guffawed loudly every ninety seconds or so, so apparently some adults will thoroughly enjoy it. But not me. If I had kids, I would rather wait for this to come out on DVD and let them watch it while I get other things done, because it was so tedious for me to sit through in the theater. I might issue this film a citation for driving below the minimum speed entertainment limit.\n\nI liked it! It was entertaining and fun. Being the fourth installment in a series that hasn’t seemed to care much for coherent plot, I didn’t go in with very high expectations. And what do you know, I wasn’t disappointed! Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is as devilishly charming as ever. The plot was silly and cliche, but at least it wasn’t the exact same cliches and jokes that were being recycled in movies 2 and 3. Or…not as much anyway. We still get the freakish monkey screaming at the camera, but we don’t have to suffer the buffoonery of tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum (the soldiers, or the one-eyed pirate and his friend). There’s no I’m-headstrong-and-a-swordfighter Elizabeth and I’m-good-but-a-pirate Will being friends, and then not friends, with Jack. So it’s fresh, in a sense, although not really original. The music is pretty much exactly the same as previous films, so don’t buy the soundtrack, but it does it’s job of lending to the atmosphere while you watch the movie, and making it more enjoyable by reminding you of how much you liked the first one, when the music and everything else was wonderfully new and exciting.\n\nThe plot is pretty weak; it’s more fun if you don’t think about it too hard. Because really, why would the fountain of youth require a ritual that involves Ponce de Leon’s silver chalices? It wouldn’t, if the fountain was a real thing, because de Leon didn’t invent it, he just went searching for it. And why would it require a mermaid’s tear? Why, so we can have mermaids in this movie, of course! I actually loved the mermaids. They reminded me of the ones in Peter Pan who will “sweetly drown you if you get too close.” At first they appear beautiful and innocent, so alluring that one pirate is willing to kiss one even though he’s been warned she’ll drag him underwater and eat his flesh. “At least I’ll have been kissed by a proper mermaid!” he declares. But then her angelic singing ceases, and her fangs come out, literally. And suddenly, confronted with the reality of her deadliness and not the romanticized version, he’s not so willing anymore. It’s a pretty good metaphor for the destructiveness of sin, which is so easy to justify and sounds so much like it would be ‘worth it’ at the time, but which always, always leads to ruin.\n\n“Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death.” –James 1:15\n\nThere’s actually quite a bit of focus on sin and salvation in this film, although it’s all misguided. Angelica is focused on saving the soul of her father, the murderous pirate Blackbeard. To that end, she tries not to let him actually kill people, even though as Captain if he orders it he’s still ultimately responsible. I guess the thinking is, if the murder isn’t done by his hand, his soul isn’t guilty of the deed. But that’s not really how it works, is it? God is more concerned with the intentions of the heart than the outward actions. Jesus says hate is just as bad as murder, (Matthew 5:21-22), and that even seemingly good deeds, like prayer and giving to charity, if done for the wrong reasons, are not so great (Matthew 6:1-8).\n\nFurthermore, the idea that less sinning will make it easier for his soul to ascend is not Biblical. The Bible says that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Romans 3:23), that salvation is attained only through repentance and acceptance of Christ as Lord, for “there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved,” (Acts 4:12). Even one sin is enough to condemn him, and Blackbeard isn’t the least bit repentant. After his demise, Angelica screams that Jack has thwarted her attempts to save her father’s soul, to which he replies, “Your father saved you, perhaps his soul is now redeemed.” But he didn’t save her on purpose, he thought he was saving himself. Selfish to the end. And as stated, that’s not how souls are ‘redeemed’, anyway. Sorry, Angelica, but Jack doesn’t know what he’s talking about. This is the same deviant who toyed with conversion on an ‘as needed’ basis earlier in the film, saying he was “willing to believe whatever he needed, to should to situation arise” or some such. But you should know better, if you were really about to take your vows to become a nun before Jack seduced you. Tsk tsk.\n\nOn to my new favorite ‘Pirates’ character: the missionary, Philip. I loved his character, even though he apparently didn’t go a very good seminary, (if any). He says (correctly) that there is always hope for any soul to be saved, but then editorializes (unbiblicaly) that he doubts it in Blackbeard’s case. Even though I just spent a paragraph arguing that Blackbeard was ultimately not saved, it isn’t because he didn’t have a chance, and a minister (or any person) should never presume to give up on someone. God doesn’t. As long as they are alive we should hope and pray for their salvation. Then, Philip tells the mermaid that she must be “one of God’s creatures”, and not descendant from those damned beings that weren’t on Noah’s ark. Say what? Firstly, all creatures on and off Noah’s ark were ‘God’s creatures,’ since he created everything. Secondly, mermaids, if real, wouldn’t have been on the ark anyway since they could easily survive a flood along with all the other sea-dwellers. But I appreciate his sentiment–that she’s a person, essentially, and that it’s wrong to mistreat her.\n\nThat’s why he’s my favorite–he’s so good. (And cute!) He has pure intentions, and he really tries to act Christlike, he doesn’t just preach, and he’s not concerned with his own welfare over his convictions. When the mutinous pirates ask, before they cut him down, if he’s for them or against them, he doesn’t say that he’s for them so that he can get off the mast he’s been tied to for days. He says, “I’m neither for you nor against you,” because his allegiance lies with God. (This is a position I wish more American churches would take, instead of becoming enmeshed in politics!!!) When the mermaid’s tank crashes and she becomes human (a la Ariel), he immediately gives her his shirt to cover her nakedness and helps carry her when she cannot walk, and I just kept thinking that some who call themselves Christians would have been offended by her nudity and gossiped and gasped and had a general outcry at the indecency of a minister holding a half-naked girl to his chest. But Philip isn’t caught up in these distractions, he’s focused on the most important thing, which is helping someone in need. I might be making a straw man’s argument here with my imaginary so-called Christians, but to me in this scenario he is reminiscent of the good Samaritan.\n\nI was a little disappointed by the romantic development between my Philip and the mermaid, (Serena, I think he named her), because I was afraid he was going to somehow betray his convictions, for love, when he was so stalwart before. In the end I don’t think he did, but I’m not sure because I don’t know what the heck happened to him. Did he die, was he dying anyway, is it a mercy drowning, is she taking him to the fountain, if so is she going to sacrifice her life for his?!?!?! That was perhaps the most unsatisfying subplot ending I have ever seen, especially since I was so invested in his character by that point. I wouldn’t really mind if he died, if it was a good death; I just want to know what happened! There had better be a deleted scene explaining that.\n\nAnother time, maybe I’ll write about why we all love Captain Jack Sparrow, and whether or not that’s a good thing. (Good Blackbeard quote, to Jack: “Your words surround you like fog and make you hard to see.”) But this is already too long, so, “ride hard between wind and tide!”"
