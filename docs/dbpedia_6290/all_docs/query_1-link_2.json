The one-night-only production was the first to have a child ensemble playing its array of schoolgirls. Amanda Abbington played Miss Minchin, and Danny Mac played Captain Crewe.\n\nThe performing rights to the musical are available from Musical Theatre International.[6][9]\n\nPlot summary\n\n[edit]\n\nSara Crewe is a girl who was raised in Africa and now attends a London boarding school. She draws the ire of the headmistress, Winifred Minchin, for going to supper without shoes on and for mingling with Becky, a scullery maid at the school. Crewe's father, Captain Crewe, enrolled her in the boarding school while he undertakes an expedition to Timbuktu. He promises to return for Sara Crewe. Sara Crewe's father's wealth means provides her with privileges that her schoolmates are both jealous of and curious about.\n\nCrewe tells stories to her schoolmates and talks about contacting spirits, which Minchin disapproves of. Meanwhile, in Africa, Captain Crewe struggles on his expedition. Sara Crewe gains friends in classmates Ermengarde and Lottie, who moreover apologize to Becky for their previous behavior toward her.\n\nAfter time passes, the school celebrates Sara Crewe's birthday. Minchin, having made some money on the stock market based on rumors that Captain Crewe reached Timbuktu, is more amenable toward Sara than previously. However, a lawyer interrupts the birthday party to inform the school that Captain Crewe never reached Timbuktu and died. Sara Crewe is orphaned with no money, and Minchin's stock market gains are reversed. Minchin obliges Crewe to begin working as staff in the school.\n\nSara Crewe endures her reversal of fortune. Christmas draws near. After disputation, Minchin locks Crewe and Becky in the attic. Becky attempts to comfort Crewe through imagination, but Crewe is inconsolable. After they fall asleep, Pasko—a friend of Crewe's from St. Louis—sneaks into their attic and brings food and amenities to comfort them. Upon waking, Becky is startled to see Pasko in the attic. Minchin, hearing the ruckus, goes to the attic to check what is happening. Crewe escapes with Pasko out the window. Becky, scared of heights, says she will rendezvous with Pasko and Crewe at another time.\n\nMinchin makes plans to have Crewe arrested, but then Crewe returns to the school in the company of Queen Victoria. Crewe having told her about Minchin's cruelty, Queen Victoria has Minchin arrested. At the show's end, Crewe's father is revealed to be alive after all, and she and he reunite.\n\nSong list\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: from the Studio cast album, released in 2011[10]\n\nAct 1\n\nOverture\n\nGood Luck – Bonne Chance - Sara and Chorus\n\nSoon, My Love – Captain Crewe\n\nLive Out Loud – Sara\n\nLet Your Heart Be Your Compass – Sara, Becky, School Girls, and Chorus\n\nThe Widow Zuma – Ermengarde, Sara, Lottie\n\nHome by Christmas – Captain Crewe\n\nIsn't That Always the Way – Captain Crewe\n\nLucky – Miss Minchin\n\nIf the Tables Were Turned – Becky, Sara, Ermengarde, Lottie\n\nTimbuktu Delirium – Chorus\n\nSoldier On – Sara\n\nBe a Princess – Sara, Lavinia, Ermengarde, Lottie and other school girls\n\nAct 2\n\nAnother World – Sara\n\nAlmost Christmas – Sara, Schoolgirls and Chorus\n\nCaptain Crewe – Pasko\n\nOnce Upon A Time – Miss Amelia\n\nBroken Old Doll – Becky\n\nTimbuktu – Becky, Sara, and Chorus\n\nSoon – Pasko, Sara, Becky, and Miss Minchin\n\nGossip – Ermengarde, Lottie, Lavinia, Becky, and other schoolgirls\n\n\"Compass\" Reprise – Chorus, School Girls\n\nFinale – Full Company\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nRichard Connema, for Talkin' Broadway, wrote:\n\n\"I give credit to TheatreWorks, Mr. Lippa, Mr. Crawley and director Susan H. Schulman for working toward making this old-fashioned family musical work wend its way to Broadway. However, the show needs to flow more smoothly and the characters need to be defined more sharply. There is just too much going on, with too little focus on the central characters. It's not a sophisticated musical, but there are saving graces in this production's singing, exuberant athletic dancing, melodic score and good production values. However, something is lacking to make it a great musical. Two liabilities are the indigestible book and two stories presented side by side\".[11]"
