Our feet shall stand in thy gates, O Jerusalem Jerusalem is builded as a city that is at unity in itself. O pray for the peace of Jerusalem, they shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and plenteousness within thy palaces, and plenteousness within thy palaces!\n\n3.\n\nGuide Me O Thou Great Redeemer (free) 02:41\n\nGuide me, O Thou great redeemer, Pilgrim through this barren land; I am weak, but Thou art mighty, Hold me with Thy powerful hand; Bread of heaven, bread of heaven Feed me till I want no more; Feed me till I want no more. Open now the crystal fountain Whence the healing stream doth flow; Let the fire and cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey through: Strong deliverer, strong deliverer; Be Thou still my strength and shield; Be Thou still my strength and shield. When I tread the verge of Jordan, Bid my anxious fears subside; Death of death, and hell's destruction Land me safe on Canaan's side: Songs of praises, songs of praises, I will ever give to Thee; I will ever give to Thee!\n\n4.\n\nGod Save The Queen-British National Anthem (free) 01:32\n\nGod save our gracious Queen Long live our noble Queen God save the Queen Send her victorious Happy and glorious Long to reign over us God save the Queen O Lord, our God, arise Scatter her enemies And make them fall Confound their politics Frustrate their knavish tricks On Thee our hopes we fix God save us all Thy choicest gifts in store On her be pleased to pour Long may she reign May she defend our laws And ever give us cause To sing with heart and voice God save the Queen\n\n5.\n\nLove Divine All Loves Excelling (free) 03:30\n\nLove divine, all loves excelling Joy of heaven to earth come down Fix in us Thy humble dwelling All Thy faithful mercies crown Jesus, Thou art all compassion Pure unbounded love Thou art Visit us with Thy salvation Enter every trembling heart Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit Into every troubled breast Let us all in Thee inherit Let us find that second rest Take away our bent to sinning Alpha and Omega be End of faith, as its beginning Set our hearts at liberty Come Almighty to deliver Let us all Thy life receive Suddenly return and never Nevermore Thy temples leave Thee we would be always blessing Serve Thee as Thy hosts above Pray and praise Thee without ceasing Glory in Thy perfect love Finish then Thy new creation Pure and spotless let us be Let us see Thy great salvation Perfectly restored in Thee Changed from glory into glory 'Til in heaven we take our place 'Til we cast our crowns before Thee Lost in wonder, love, and praise\n\n6."
