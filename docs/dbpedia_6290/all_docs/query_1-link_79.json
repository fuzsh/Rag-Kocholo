        "text": "Gatefold jacket with custom dust sleeves and an envelope containing a personal letter from Suki\n\nLimited sparklemuffin-pearl vinyl\n\nSuki Waterhouses music sounds like a collage of her inspirations, experiences, and emotions stitched together by honeyed vocal delivery, bright-eyed melodies, and evocative storytelling. It doubles as a mirror image of her life as a consummate creative, artist, actress, model, and mother, yet it also breaks the glass to unveil raw truth. She leans on an ever-evolving sonic palette to convey what shes feelingwhether it be folky Americana, nineties alternative, turn-of-the-century indie, or handcrafted otherworldly pop. Youll hear Sukis longing in a swooning chorus, fearlessness in a crunchy chord, elation in a danceable waltz, and wonder in a soft coo befitting of a lullaby. She faithfully followed a lifelong passion for music to her 2022 full-length debut, I Cant Let Go. Adorned by Moves and Melrose Meltdown, it incited widespread critical applause from Variety, Nylon, NME, The Line of Best Fit, and more. Between headlining shows and touring with Father John Misty, Good Looking surged online, generating nearly a billion streams, going RIAA platinum, and paving the way for theMilk Teeth EP. Simultaneously, she absorbed inspiration from a season of change earmarked by unforgettable moments a la gracing the stage of Lollapalooza 2023, performing on multiple continents, becoming a mom, and closing out the Gobi Tent at Coachella in 2024. Everything just set the stage for the gold-certified songstress to assert herself as a versatile, vibrant, and vital presence on her 2024 double-LP, Memoir of a Sparklemuffin.\n\nLP - features LIMITED EDITION BLACK & WHITE SWIRL + album download code with 3 never-before-released bonus tracks REMIXED AND REMASTERED from 192kHz/36-bit transfers of the original multi-track tapes. Includes a 4-COLOR BOOKLET with liner notes from Alison Brown, Dave Dennison, and Mike Marshall, plus ARCHIVAL PHOTOS and SESSION DOCUMENTS. Unavailable on all formats since the early 2000s, Alison Brown's Grammy-nominated debut album Simple Pleasures was a leap forward for Scruggs-rooted banjo playing when it was first released in 1990. This led to her immediate recognition as a banjo pioneer and to her win in 1991 of the Banjo Player of the Year award from the International Bluegrass Music Association (the first female to win an Instrumentalist of the Year award).\n\nThe album was produced in 1989 by acoustic music icon and frequent Jerry Garcia cohort David Grisman (architect of \"Dawg Music,\" the jazz-influenced breakout fringe of the bluegrass genre) and recorded with a cast of all-star musicians at Dawg Studio in Marin, CA. Players on the sessions included Alison Krauss (fiddle), David Grisman (mandolin), Mike Marshall (guitar, fiddle, mandolin), Matt Eakle (flute), Joe Craven (percussion) and Jim Kerwin (bass). The album's 12 tunes were all written by Alison and include the first recorded versions of some of her most well-known compositions, including \"Mambo Banjo,\" \"Leaving Cottondale,\" and \"Weetabix.\" For the 2024 reissue, the original 8-track, 1\" multitrack tapes were transferred at a resolution of 192kHz/36-bit, and remixed and mastered by Matt Coles at Compass Sound Studio in Nashville. Simple Pleasures will be released on LP, CD, and all digital platforms and features liner notes from Mike Marshall, recording engineer Dave Dennison, and Alison. The CD and DL versions include 3 bonus tracks of never-before-released demos recorded at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, CA, in 1988, produced by Richard Greene and featuring David Grisman (mandolin), Mike Marshall (guitar), Todd Phillips (bass), and Greene (fiddle). Originally released on Vanguard Records in 1990, Simple Pleasures earned extensive critical praise both for Alison's compositions as well as her instrumental prowess and received a Grammy nomination for Best Bluegrass Album. In his liner notes for the reissue, Mike Marshall wrote: \"It is SO fun to revisit this first album of Alison's and to remember how she put her own stamp on the acoustic music scene back in the early 90s both as a composer and monster instrumentalist. It was refreshing and very much needed to have a woman showing us guys what was what and, in the process, paving the way for the next generation of virtuoso female bluegrass pickers.\" One of the most multi-faceted minds in roots music, Alison Brown is a GRAMMY-winning musician, GRAMMY-nominated producer, and co-founder of Compass Records Group. She is the recipient of the USA Artists Fellowship in Music and the Distinguished Achievement Award from the International Bluegrass Music Association. A pioneer among women in the music industry, Alison was the first female to win an Instrumentalist of the Year award from the International Bluegrass Music Association; in 2019, she became the first female 5-string banjoist to be inducted into the American Banjo Museum's Hall of Fame. Alison serves as Vice President of the Board of Governors of the Recording Academy, on the advisory board of the Salt Lick Incubator and the Earl Scruggs Center, and as co-chair of the Steve Martin Banjo Prize. Over the course of her career, she has continued to break down barriers for the 5-string banjo through both her solo discography and her live performances with the Alison Brown Quintet, as well as frequent collaborations with actor/comedian/banjoist Steve Martin, The Indigo Girls, and others. Alison's 2023 release, On Banjo, received critical acclaim for charting new territory for the 5-string banjo and a Best Album of the Year nod from AllMusic.\n\nRussell County, Virginia-based 49 Winchester is following up their 2022 breakthrough hit, Fortune Favors The Bold with their latest album, Leavin This Holler. Since their last release in 2022 the band has mined success across the globe by playing multiple sold out tours in the US as well as a sold out run of arena concerts opening for Luke Combs across Europe. Crowds have celebrated and supported this band across the globe and the bands hard workin ways continue to help build their devoted following.\n\nLeavin This Holler is a soulful anthem of liberation and renewal. The album narrates a journey of breaking free from the chains of the past to pursue happiness and freedom. With a resolute spirit and a clean washed heart, 49 Winchester embraces change and sets out on a quest for new heights. Fortune has favored these bold boys and fueled by determination and the promise of a bright future, Leavin this holler is a powerful ode to resilience and the pursuit of personal fulfillment."
