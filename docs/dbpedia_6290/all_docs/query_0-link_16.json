The song \"Non Nobis Domine\", from the film, was awarded the 1989 Ivor Novello Award for Best Film Theme.

While he was undergoing chemotherapy, he composed the score for his latest project, Quest For Camelot, and often received hospital visits and care packages from Branagh, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Timothy Spall, who himself had been diagnosed with the same disease only a few years earlier.[1]\n\nSelective filmography[]\n\nYear Work Award Category Result 1991 Dead Again Golden Globe Best Original Score Nominated 1992 Indochine César Best Music Written for a Film Nominated 1994 Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Saturn Best Music Nominated 1995 Sense and Sensibility Academy Best Original Score Nominated BAFTA Film Best Film Music Nominated Golden Globe Best Original Score Nominated 1996 Hamlet Academy Best Original Score Nominated Satellite Best Original Score Nominated 1999 East/West César Best Music Written for a Film Nominated 2001 Bridget Jones's Diary N/A 2005 Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Saturn Best Music Nominated Nanny McPhee N/A 2011 Rise of the Planet of the Apes Thor 2012 Brave Annie Music in an Animated Feature Production Nominated 2014 Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit N/A 2017 Murder on the Orient Express 2022 Death on the Nile\n\nBehind the scenes[]\n\nPatrick Doyle's daughter Abigail has been singing professionally since age 11, and performed Underwater Secrets, the song of the Golden egg for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\n\nPatrick Doyle scored for the following films, in which he also made minor cameo appearances, directed by Gilderoy Lockhart actor Kenneth Branagh, who starred alongside Sybill Trelawney actress Emma Thompson:\n\nHenry V (1989), which also featured Robbie Coltrane (Rubeus Hagrid).\n\nDead Again (1991)\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (1993), which also featured Imelda Staunton (Dolores Umbridge).\n\nDoyle scored for the following films directed by Mike Newell, the director of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire:\n\nInto the West (1992), which also featured Brendan Gleeson (Alastor Moody) and Jim Norton (Mr Mason).\n\nDonnie Brasco (1997), which also featured Johnny Depp (Gellert Grindelwald).\n\nDoyle scored for the 1994 film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and the 2015 film Cinderella, which were directed by Kenneth Branagh and featured Bellatrix Lestrange actress Helena Bonham Carter.\n\nBranagh starred in the former in addition to directing it.\n\nDoyle scored for the 1995 film A Little Princess and the 1998 film Great Expectations, which were directed by Alfonso Cuarón, the director of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\n\nHe scored for the following films, which Kenneth Branagh directed and also starred in:\n\nHamlet (1996), which also featured Julie Christie (Rosmerta), Ray Fearon (voice of Firenze), and Timothy Spall (Peter Pettigrew).\n\nLove's Labour's Lost (2000), which also featured Carmen Ejogo (Seraphina Picquery)\n\nJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014)\n\nMurder on the Orient Express (2017), which also featured Johnny Depp.\n\nAll Is True (2018)\n\nDeath on the Nile (2022), which also featured Dawn French (Fat Lady).\n\nHe scored for the following films directed by Kenneth Branagh:\n\nAs You Like It (2006)\n\nSleuth (2007), which also featured Jude Law (Albus Dumbledore).\n\nThor (2011)\n\nArtemis Fowl (2020), which also featured Colin Farrell (Percival Graves).\n\nDoyle has scored for various projects which featured several actors and actresses from the Harry Potter films:\n\nTwo more films with both Emma Thompson and Imelda Staunton:\n\nSense and Sensibility (1995), which also featured Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), Gemma Jones (Poppy Pomfrey), Robert Hardy (Cornelius Fudge), Elizabeth Spriggs (Fat Lady).\n\nNanny McPhee (2005), which also featured Kelly Macdonald (Helena Ravenclaw).\n\nJim Broadbent (Horace Slughorn) and Gemma Jones in the 2001 film Bridget Jones's Diary.\n\nIt was a Grammy Award nominee for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for Motion Pictures, Television or Other Visual Media; though Doyle scored for the film, he was not listed as a recipient, two compilation producers were.[2][3]\n\nTwo more films with Kelly Macdonald:\n\nGosford Park (2001), which also featured Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), Maggie Smith (Minerva McGonagall), Sophie Thompson (Mafalda Hopkirk), and Stephen Fry (UK audiobook narrator).\n\nBrave (2012), which also featured Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, and Julie Walters (Molly Weasley).\n\nJulie Walters and Ciarán Hinds (Aberforth Dumbledore) in the 2003 film Calendar Girls.\n\nEddie Izzard (voice of Lord Voldemort in The LEGO Batman Movie) in the 2008 film Igor.\n\nTom Felton (Draco Malfoy) in the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nPatrick Doyle on Wikipedia"
