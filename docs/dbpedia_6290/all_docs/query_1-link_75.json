        "text": "It is not random music mentioned here and there. They make you feel what he cannot communicate with words.\n\nHaruki Murakami’s books have a lot of artistic depth to me. The worlds he creates are crazy and yet feel so real due of the use of precise words and cultural references. Japanese culture mixed with western classical culture — from Greek philosophers to German romantic composers — give a wide pallet of emotions, culture and knowledge to the reader. What makes Murakami even more real to me is when I listen to his classical music references. Murakami uses classical pieces just to make a parallel to the history to the piece (e.g. Beethoven’s trio for piano, violin and cello no. 7 in B-flat minor, Op. 97 “Archduke Trio” in Kafka on the Shore) or just to fit in the theme of the book (e.g. Liszt’s Années de pèlerinage S.160-S.163 in Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage). Some other times however, he uses classical music to give a message that he cannot communicate otherwise (e.g. Tchaikovsky’s serenade for strings in C minor, Op. 48 in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle). These references are not key in understanding the plot of the story but I am certain they are not random music pieces placed like that — just like his references to other work of Art, they bring more to the emotional spectrum.\n\n“Our lives are like a complex musical score. Filled with all sorts of cryptic writing, sixteenth and thirty-second notes and other strange signs. It’s next to impossible to correctly interpret these, and even if you could, and could then transpose them into the correct sounds, there’s no guarantee that people would correctly understand, or appreciate, the meaning therein.” — Murakami (Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage)\n\nKafka on the Shore\n\nThe first Murakami book I read last year. Many recommended to start with Kafka on the shore as I would get a general idea of Murakami’s world. I was not disappointed at all! It is rich in reference, the story has some depth and charms. Although it is surely the best introductory book to get into Kafka’s vibes, it is today the one on the bottom on my list here as I believe the rest have more to offer.\n\nSomething I noticed about classical music in Murakami: Whenever he tries to give a sense, or an explanation to the piece, it does not seems as powerful to me. Although I need to admit that they way Schubert piano sonata is explained is very good. When listening to Schubert, we have a sense of surprise and unpredictability. The best metaphor I have to describe Schubert piano music is like having a walk in a forest, where you just discover things as you walk through it: unexpected turns, leading you to different places, different moods, different light intensity, different smells… The use of Schubert’s 17th piano sonata is very good as well!\n\n“When the Haydn concerto was over Hoshino asked him to play the Rubinstein-Heifetz-Feuermann version of the Archduke Trio again. While listening to this, he again was lost in thought. Damn it, I don’t care what happens, he finally decided. I’m going to follow Mr. Nakata as long as I live.”\n\nSame thing goes for “Archduke Trio.” First, I was surprised about the referenced recording Murakami gave: The Million Dollar Trio. The trio consist of legendary musicians namely Jascha Heifetz (violinist), Emanuel Feuermann or Gregor Piatigorsky (cellist), and Arthur Rubinstein (pianist) (Though I think the Million Dollar Trio is with Piatigorsky and not with Feuermann). Those musicians were the best of their era and we still look up at them as Gods. Listening to recording by those musicians performing solo, is incredible and together they are very very powerful. Some may argue there is an ego fight which is true but not in their music. Secondly, Murakami makes a parallel between the history of the composition of the “Archduke Trio” and of two of his characters — Nakata and Hoshino. I thought it was a superb source of knowledge and culture that Murakami is giving out to the readers!\n\nEmotionally however, these pieces do not connect me with the characters or the story. The selected pieces and recordings are interesting and of cultural value but there is little emotional factor for me. Schubert piano sonata did not made the road trip any better and while I love Beethoven’s trio, it did not made me connect with the emotions of Hoshino feeling inadequate in the scene.\n\nColorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\n\nThis is another novel where Murakami used classical music to give some conistency to his story. Unlike Kafka on the Shore, Murakami did not made much explanations of Franz Liszt’s Liszt’s Années de pèlerinage (“Years of pilgrimage”) S.160-S.163. The obvious reason for this piece is to enforce the pilgrimage theme. However the piece shares a lot of emotional depth to this story this time.\n\nBefore reading Colorless Tsukuru, I did not do much research about pianists and Liszt piano music. Today I enjoy more the piano as an instrument, pianists as artists, and composers like Franz Liszt. Liszt music always sounded highly intellectual to me. It is only now, after months of listening and research of different recordings, I enjoy some of his pieces like the Hungarian rhapsodies when interpreted by Roberto Szidon. Liszt compositions for piano and orchestra like Totentanz and Malédiction are thrilling. The Années de pèlerinage was an interesting find. The recording highlighted in the book is absolutely golden — interpretation by Lazar Berman. The specific movement that Murakami emphasis on is le mal du pays (“homesickness”). It reflects Tsukuru’s emotions imbalance, anxiety and sadness. When listening to the piece, I do feel uneasy, anxious and melancholic. The music enabled me to understand and get closer to Tsukuru. However, I do not enjoy le mal du pays as much as the next movement movement les cloches de Genêve (“Geneva’s bells”) which leaves me with more melancholy and sadness. Surely one day I will enjoy more le mal du pays.\n\nThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle\n\nWe are now coming to my favourites from Murakami: The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle and 1Q84 trilogy. They both emotionally resonated in me. They are very dense, story wise it does not get any more stranger than that, and emotionally tortured. More importantly to me, both have incredible music mentions.\n\nThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle starts with Toru making pasta while listening to Rossini’s La gazza ladra (“The Thieving Magpie”) overture. To me it was already a sign that the book will be amazing! I loved that this time, Murakami only mentioned the music, not giving much reference if only if only to which recording the characters were listening to. In the case of The Thieving Magpie, it is Abbado’s recording which is perfect timing when cooking spaghetti carbonara!\n\nAbout Rossini’s Thieving Magpie, you surely made the correlation between the music piece and the name of the first book, “Book of the Thieving Magpie.” And of course, the two other books have classical music references. The second book, the “Book of the Prophesying Bird” references Robert Schumann’s set of 9 pieces of music for piano, Waldszenen (“Forest Scenes”), Op. 82. The seventh piece is Vogel als Prophet (“Bird as Prophet”). The third and final book, the “Book of the Bird-Catcher Man,” refers to a character Mozart’s fantastic opera Die Zauberflöte (“The Magic Flute”) K. 620, Papageno. I do not think there is something related to the emotional aspect of the music of Mozart. It refers to a particular situation in the opera.\n\n“It’s kind of like The Magic Flute. You know: Mozart. Using a magic flute and magic bells, they have to save a princess who’s being held captive in a faraway castle. I love that opera. I don’t know how many times I’ve seen it. I know the lines by heart: ‘I’m the birdcatcher, Papageno, known throughout the land.”\n\nPapageno, the bird-catcher, is desperate as he desires to be with the woman he loves, Papagena, but cannot as he is not worthy of her yet. Schumann’s “Bird as Prophet” however resonates in the story in an interesting way. Murakami does mention that it is a piano piece. Listening to some various recordings, I found it strange sounding but not quite bird and strange enough. Looking on Spotify, I discovered a brilliant recording of an arrangement by Jascha Heifetz and played by himself. Heifetz’ ability to create rich and dark colours transforms this piano piece. It gave another dimension to the piece and to suits the mood conveyed in the book better in my opinion.\n\n“When Tchaikovsky’s Serenade for Strings ended, a little piano piece came on that sounded like something by Schumann. It was familiar, but I couldn’t recall the title. When it was over, the female announcer said it had been the seventh of Schumann’s Forest Scenes, titled “Bird as Prophet.” […] The announcer explained that Schumann had created a scene of fantasy in which a mysterious bird lived the forest, foretelling the future.”\n\nThe best musical mention to me is when I read “Tchaikovksy’s serenade for strings”. This automatically made me feel a lot more the gravity of the emotions set in the scene. Tchaikovsky’s serenade for strings in C minor, Op. 48 is only mentioned like so. No description about Toru’s feelings nor precise recording, which gives the reader some choice between two types of interpretations: chamber string orchestra (21 musicians) or full sized orchestra (obviously more than 21). I personally prefer the impact this serenade has when it is played by a large string orchestra! Tchaikovsky’s serenade is heart breaking, beautifully sweet, loving, melancholic, elegiac and pathétique.\n\nPathétique from Latin patheticus, from Ancient Greek παθητικός ‎(pathētikós, “subject to feeling, capable of feeling, impassioned”), from παθητός ‎(pathētós, “one who has suffered, subject to suffering”), from πάσχω ‎(páskhō, “to suffer”).\n\nWikitionary. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pathetic\n\nWe can even feel the different stages of Toru’s emotions through the serenade: The 1st movement opens with a cry, continuing in a melancholic mood until the end. The second movement, the Waltz, is very famous for its beauty giving, sometimes serene moments and sudden tormented moments. Followed by the third movement, Elegy, where Toru laments his lost. And the finale, where everything seems to go better but finishes on the same opening statement in the first movement, though with more determination, making me believe it is an endless cycle.\n\nIf you have not listened to Tchaikovsky’s serenade for strings, please do it!\n\n1Q84\n\nI will finish with 1Q84 as it is my second favourite book I ever read so far. The world is very dense and rich and there is an abundance of resource scattered in the three books. The plot is intelligent and there is a lot of topic of discussion available. I also like to take this work as a romantic art work where Murakami stresses on intense emotions as source of truth.\n\nLike the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84 opens up with classical music. Aomame, the female protagonist, is stuck in a traffic jam and Leoš Janáček’s Sinfonietta is playing over the radio in her taxi.\n\nThe taxi’s radio was tuned to a classical FM broadcast. Janacek’s Sinfonietta — probably not the ideal music to hear in a taxi caught in traffic. The middle-aged driver didn’t seem to be listening very closely, either. With his mouth clamped shut, he stared straight ahead at the endless line of cars stretching out on the elevated expressway, like a veteran fisherman standing in the bow of his boat, reading the ominous confluence of two currents. Aomame settled into the broad back seat, closed her eyes, and listened to the music.\n\nMy pick as recording would be Claudio Abbado’s conducting the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO). You may prefer the interpretation of Rafael Kubelik with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra but Abbado’s slow tempo of the opening of the piece suits very well the opening scene in the book. Surely it does not sound to ‘fanfare’ but I picture the various scenes of the book with Abbado’s recording better; The slow movements during Aomame’s sports exercises, with then an increase in intensity. The opening of the snifonietta, the brass section announces something very mysterious, which is then resolved in strange beauty. This feeling is kept by Murakami until the end of the story. There are some other mentions such as Bach Well-Tempered Klavier and Vivaldi’s Concert for Woodwinds. These mentions sets some kind of mood in the scene and about the characters but did not trigger anything major in me until I read what Aomame received as music to listen to while she is waiting for Tengo to appear once more on the slide.\n\nShe also listened to music. The elderly dowager had sent over a box of classical music cassettes: Mahler symphonies, Haydn chamber music, Bach keyboard pieces — all varieties and types of classical music. There was a tape of Janáček’s Sinfonietta as well, which she had specifically requested. She would listen to the Sinfonietta once a day as she noiselessly went through her exercise routine.\n\nGustav Mahler is a big name when we speak of symphonies. He wrote the most titanesque symphonies I ever heard! Mahler symphonies are expressions of the world around him and, boy! He lived in an intense world!\n\nThe first Mahler symphony I heard, was the second symphony also known as “Resurrection,” and I could not think of a better piece of music for Aomame’s emotional state. Leonard Bernstein’s recording on Sony label with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra suits best the story to me. The thrilling fast tempo with the strings at the beginning of the symphony adds so much drama to the emotional spectrum compared to the slower tempo chosen by Bruno Walter with the New York Philharmophic. Mahler’s music, like many other romantic music, contains beauty and drama. It is soothing and bright landscape, when suddenly intense darkness creeps in and after the intense tempest, a ray of hope comes and shines through again. We can hear it throughout the symphony but the best example would be opening of the last movement — movement which lasting over 30 minutes — comes like a huge quake! The bass does something very visceral and explodes into an incredible tutti and immediately becomes something very sweet and soothing."
