        "text": "All Saints - 'Pure Shores' (The Beach)\n\nAll Saints - Pure Shores (Official Music Video)\n\nA huge UK number one single in 2000, All Saints recorded the main theme tune to this Leonardo DiCaprio film.\n\nProbably the best thing about the film, it's still a fantastic summery pop tune over two decades later.\n\nWilson Phillips - 'Hold On' (Bridesmaids)\n\nWilson Phillips Wedding Performance | Bridesmaids | Screen Bites\n\nIn one of cinema's most rousing endings, the 2011 comedy Bridesmaids gave a new lease of life to 1990's biggest hit from American trio Wilson Phillips.\n\nIn the film, the characters played by Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph fondly recall the song from their teenage years.\n\nThe Story of... 'Hold On' by Wilson Phillips\n\nWilson Phillips then make an appearance to sing the song at the wedding at the conclusion of the film.\n\nTom Petty - 'Free Fallin'' (Jerry Maguire)\n\nTom Cruise singing (Jerry Maguire, 1996)\n\nWe love this moment where Tom Cruise's titular character in Jerry Maguire finally has a bit of good news, and sings out his feelings while listening to this Tom Petty classic on the radio.\n\nSixpence None the Richer - 'Kiss Me' (She's All That)\n\nShe's All That • Kiss Me • Sixpence None the Richer\n\nWhile not written specifically for the teen romcom, 'Kiss Me' was used as the film's main theme, and gave it a brand new lease of life.\n\nChristina Aguilera, Pink, Lil Kim and Mya - 'Lady Marmalade' (Moulin Rouge)\n\nChristina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, Mya, Pink - Lady Marmalade (Official Music Video)\n\nThere are plenty of brilliant music moments from Baz Luhrmann's extravaganza, but it doesn't get much more epic than this team-up of 2001's biggest pop divas.\n\nLulu - To Sir With Love (To Sir With Love)\n\nTo Sir, with Love • Theme Song • Lulu\n\nThe teenage Lulu scored a number one hit in the USA with this sentimental song.\n\nIt was the title track of the Sidney Poitier film about social and racial issues at an inner city UK school in the 1960s.\n\nMichael Sembello - 'Maniac' (Flashdance)\n\nMichael Sembello - Maniac (1983) (Official Video)\n\nOriginally intended as a horror movie song, it was later reworked perfectly as a song to play while Jennifer Beals trained hard at home, it became a big '80s pop hit for Michael.\n\nEminem - 'Lose Yourself' (8 Mile)\n\nEminem - Lose Yourself [HD]\n\nEminem's autobiographical movie was a resounding success for the rapper, helped largely to this main song from the film.\n\nWhile largely spelling out the plot of the film, it has also become something of an anthem relating to taking your moment and challenging yourself.\n\nSonny & Cher - 'I Got You Babe' (Groundhog Day)\n\nI Got You, Babe - Groundhog Day\n\nOK, Bill Murray may have grown to hate this song thanks to his character Phil constantly hearing it every time he woke up, but it's now an iconic movie song because of his suffering. Sorry, Phil.\n\nGary Jules and Michael Andrews - 'Mad World' (Donnie Darko)\n\nDonnie Darko - Mad World\n\nIn a film full of '80s classics, it was an inspired move to record a piano cover of Tears for Fears' brilliant song 'Mad World' for the powerful finale.\n\nTwo years later, it was the UK's surprise Christmas number one after a new single release, and it remains one of cinema's most moving music moments.\n\nPharrell Williams - 'Happy' (Despicable Me 2)\n\nHAPPY - Pharrell Williams (feat. Minions)\n\nA ridiculously uplifting and catchy song, Pharrell Williams had a massive hit with the animated comedy sequel's main song.\n\nPharrell wrote and recorded the film's entire soundtrack, bringing back the days of big animated films recruiting top music names.\n\nFred Astaire - 'The Way You Look Tonight' (Swing Time)\n\nThe Way You Look Tonight\n\nOne of the most romantic ballads of all time, this song first appeared in the 1936 musical comedy Swing Time.\n\nThe song earned an Academy Award, and has since been performed countless times by everybody from Phil Collins to Rod Stewart.\n\nDoris Day - 'Que Sera Sera (Whatever Will Be Will be)' (The Man Who Knew Too Much)\n\nDoris Day - Que Sera Sera\n\nOne of those songs that became so big that it's easy to forget that it first appeared in a film.\n\nDoris Day performed the classic song in an Alfred Hitchcock film, no less. It became her signature song, and won an Oscar.\n\nPrince - 'Purple Rain' (Purple Rain)\n\nPrince - Purple Rain (Official Video)\n\nWe'd argue that this song is more famous as a song in its own right rather than being from a film, but we're counting it anyway!\n\nPrince was arguably at his peak when he made the Purple Rain film in 1984, with this legendary song becoming his signature tune.\n\nWill Smith - 'Men in Black' (Men in Black)\n\nWill Smith - Men In Black (Video Version)\n\nWill Smith was the '90s king when it came to recording theme songs for films he was also starring.\n\nHis best was the theme tune to sci-fi comedy Men in Black, which managed to explain the plot of the film and be catchy.\n\nBarbra Streisand - 'The Way We Were' (The Way We Were)\n\nBarbra Streisand - The Way We Were\n\nBarbra Streisand's career was arguably revived thanks to the success of this song from the film of the same name, in which she also starred.\n\nA huge hit single, it won two Academy Awards.\n\nBilly Ocean - 'When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going' (The Jewel of the Nile)\n\nThe Story of... 'When the Going Gets Tough' by Billy Ocean\n\nBritish pop legend Billy Ocean was recruited by Hollywood to perform the main theme tune to adventure flick The Jewel of the Nile starring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.\n\nAs Billy explained to Smooth, Michael, Kathleen and Danny DeVito even popped up to star in Billy's music video!\n\nLionel Richie and Diana Ross - 'Endless Love' (Endless Love)\n\nDiana Ross & Lionel Richie Endless Love 1981\n\nThis is definitely one of those songs that was a bigger deal than the movie it was from.\n\nBrooke Shields starred in the romantic drama of the same name in 1981, but the most memorable part of the film will always be the stunning duet from two of pop's biggest stars: Lionel Richie and Diana Ross.\n\nPeter Gabriel - 'In Your Eyes' (Say Anything)\n\nSay Anything • In Your Eyes • Peter Gabriel\n\nA perfect example of how a film could bring a new lease of life to a song.\n\nAn iconic scene from this 1989 film featured broken-hearted Lloyd (John Cusack) serenading his ex-girlfriend outside her bedroom window by holding a boombox up above his head and playing the Peter Gabriel song for her.\n\nHarry Nilsson - 'Everybody's Talkin'' (Midnight Cowboy)\n\nMidnight Cowboy - Harry Nilsson - Everybody's Talkin'\n\nHarry Nilsson was recommended for the Midnight Cowboy soundtrack to director John Schlesinger, who then selected this song.\n\nThe track was used as the theme song for the Jon Voigt and Dustin Hoffman movie, and would become closely identified with it from then on.\n\nBJ Thomas - 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head' (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid)\n\nB. J.
