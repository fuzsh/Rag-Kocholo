        "text": "This year marks the 10th anniversary of Musical Theatre Resources, and one of the most popular topics I continue to get asked about is theatre songs for kids. Notably, I released a repertoire guide featuring 500(!) musical theatre & film songs for children a few years ago. That guide and others are available to purchase in the MTR Store. However, in honor of the site’s ‘decennial’ anniversary, I thought I would take a moment to highlight one-hundred great songs from that guide here (among many other fabulous pieces).\n\nThe musical theatre and film songs below are generally appropriate for children up to about age 13 (aka mostly treble voices regardless of gender). The majority are solos, but some do feature multiple singers. I tried to choose a fair number of songs that aren’t as well known– though there are standards included to round out the bunch (it never hurts for young singers to learn classics!). All of these pieces range in difficulty and maturity level, so I recommend voice teacher discretion as always. If you find this list useful, please strongly consider purchasing the full guide to support my continued work. Thanks for your support as always, and cheers to ten years!\n\n1. “Home” from Wonderland (2011)\n\nMusic by Frank Wildhorn; Lyrics by Jack Murphy | Song Type: Dramatic Ballad | Character Gender: Female | Sheet Music: MusicNotes (Vocal Range: A3-C5)\n\n2. “What If” from The Addams Family (2010)\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Andrew Lippa | Song Type: Comedic Ballad | Character Gender: Male | Sheet Music: MusicNotes (Vocal Range: A3-D5)\n\n3. “Ring of Keys” from Fun Home (2015)\n\nMusic by Jeanine Tesori; Lyrics by Lisa Kron | Song Type: Dramatic Uptempo | Character Gender: Female | Sheet Music: MusicNotes (Vocal Range: B3-E5)\n\n4. “When I Get My Name in Lights” from The Boy from Oz (2003)\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Peter Allen | Song Type: Comedic Uptempo | Character Gender: Male | Sheet Music: MusicNotes (Vocal Range: A3-E5)\n\n5. “Quiet” from Matilda (2013)\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Tim Minchin | Song Type: Dramatic Ballad | Character Gender: Female | Sheet Music: MusicNotes (Vocal Range: Bb3-C5)\n\n6. “Electricity” from Billy Elliot (2008)\n\nMusic by Elton John; Lyrics by Lee Hall | Song Type: Dramatic Power Ballad | Character Gender: Male | Sheet Music: MusicNotes (Vocal Range: A3-B4)\n\n7. “Six Hours As a Princess” from Children’s Letters to God (2004)\n\nMusic by David Evans; Lyrics by Douglas J.
