        "text": "Rather than asking you to keep your phones turned off and out of sight, the Civic Symphony is testing something new. We prepared a few interactive activities where you can use your device to participate and learn more about the music. We hope this \"bonus content\" will increase your understanding and enjoyment of tonight's concert.\n\nDon’t forget to silence your cell phones and refrain from texting, audio/video recording, or flash photography during the performance.\n\nPlease stand by...your host Steve Wilda will let you know when we're ready for you on set!\n\nPREVIEWS\n\nWhile you're waiting for the show to begin, check out the \"previews\" (i.e., posters) of movies featured tonight. Later, maybe you'll notice how the stage side lights change color to match each movie poster while the orchestra is playing!\n\nFIRST HALF\n\nCOLD OPEN\n\nOverture to \"West Side Story\"\n\nA cold open is the practice of jumping directly into a story at the beginning of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. It is a narrative technique used in television and film, and we're trying it here tonight!\n\n\"West Side Story,\" which debuted in 1957, was conceived as a contemporary retelling of Romeo and Juliet. Bernstein's score reflects a variety of genres, from opera to jazz. Interestingly, the overture was not in the original score, but later arranged for orchestra by Maurice Peress. The overture conveys a thematic overview of the show—but rather than a cheery curtain raiser, the solemn music foreshadows the tragedy to come.\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\nThe Godfather: A Symphonic Portrait\n\nLearn more about the music and the movie by following along with our real-time program notes. Start the video below when our conductor Seong-Kyung Graham begins the piece. Go full screen to make it a little easier to read on your device. (Alternatively, you can view the notes as a PDF, but you'll need to turn the pages yourself.)\n\nORIGIN STORY\n\nMission: Impossible Theme\n\nOkay, we know you might be reading ahead, so here are a couple quick tidbits about the origins of the Mission: Impossible Theme.\n\nThe music was written by Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin and was used as the theme song for the television series \"Mission: Impossible\" (1966-1973). The music has also been featured the 1988 television series, the ongoing film series with Tom Cruise, and the video games.\n\nSchifrin's working title for the tune was \"Burning Fuse.\" The theme is written in a 5/4 time signature, which Schifrin jokingly explained as being for people who have five legs. Schifrin started from the Morse code for M.I. _ _ .. So if a dot is one beat and a dash is one and a half beats, this gives each measure a total of five beats, exactly matching the underlying rhythm!\n\nNow...sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!\n\nTRIVIA\n\nJohn Williams\n\nStart this section when the orchestra plays Star Wars Medley. Test your knowledge about the composer and learn a few interesting facts along the way. If your first guess is incorrect, choose another answer until you find the right one. May the force be with you!\n\nINTERMISSION\n\nTake five, everyone!\n\nLet's all go to the lobby! Let's all go to the lobby! (Remember that old tune?)\n\nGet up. Stretch. Use the facilities. See if there's any popcorn left. Grab a photo at the selfie station. Don't forget to check out the movie-themed raffle baskets and buy tickets for a chance to win. Don't put all your tickets into one basket...or do!\n\nMusicians of the orchestra generously donated all the items in tonight's baskets. Proceeds will be used to offer tickets for low-income families to attend our April concert at no cost.\n\nThe Civic Symphony of Green Bay will be back after this short break (approximately 15 minutes).\n\nEXTRAS: Behind the Scenes\n\nBack to your seat early? Swipe through a few photos from our rehearsals preparing for today's concerts. Some of us are photogenic.\n\nEXTRAS: Deleted Scenes\n\nYou may notice we're only playing two of the four movements from the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone Suite. The concert was timing out a little long, and as much as we love playing for you, we only have the Walter Theatre rented until 11:00 tonight!\n\nMovement I: \"Hedwig's Theme\" - This was the first music written for the movie and was used in the original trailer. It became an important leitmotif (remember that term from earlier?) and can be heard in every single movie in the series. John Williams referred to this theme as a “darkly alluring orchestral waltz.” You'll hear snippets of it in Movement IV.\n\nMovement II: \"The Sorcerer's Stone\" - This slow music is characterized by a simple three note motif, but the composer extends it further creating a repeating and continually growing melodic row of three, four, and five notes. The dark music exudes fateful mystery and foreboding.\n\nSECOND HALF\n\nCAMEO APPEARANCE\n\nMusic from \"La La Land\"\n\nEnjoy this special \"cameo\" from the Civic Symphony of Green Bay's newly-formed cello ensemble, led by principal cellist Adam Korber. This is their first concert, and they're looking for a name! After they finish playing, vote for your favorite option.\n\nMUSICIAN POV CAMERA\n\nSelections from E.T.\n\nEver wonder what the musicians are looking at on stage? (Other than their music, of course!) Enjoy this POV (point-of-view) camera angle of Seong conducting Selections from E.T. You'll get to see how she directs the orchestra, not just with her baton and beat patterns, but also with the emotions on her face. We're gonna call this camera our \"second unit.\" Note: there may be a slight delay in the video feed. After all, it does have to go to space and back!\n\nDEDICATION\n\nBand of Brothers Suite\n\nWe ask that you put down your electronic device and take a moment to honor the memory of all the lives lost in war.\n\n\"We cherish too, the Poppy red\n\nThat grows on fields where valor led,\n\nIt seems to signal to the skies\n\nThat blood of heroes never dies.\" -Moina Michael, 1915\n\nTRIVIA\n\nHarry Potter\n\nAnswer these trivia questions while the orchestra plays the \"Nimbus 2000\" section of Harry Potter & the Sorcerer's Stone Suite. See what you remember from the films! Like earlier, if your first guess is incorrect, choose another answer until you find the right one. May the odds be ever in your favor! (oops, wrong movie)\n\nPROGRAM NOTES\n\n\"Harry's Wondrous World\"\n\nStart the video below when our conductor Seong begins the \"Harry's Wondrous World\" section of Harry Potter. Go full screen to make it a little easier to read on your device. (Alternatively, you can view the notes as a PDF, but you'll need to turn the pages yourself.)\n\nEND CREDITS\n\nMusic from \"Frozen\"\n\nIf you have children, you already know the words. Feel free to sing along!\n\nDO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?\n\nDo you wanna build a snowman?\n\nCome on let’s go and play\n\nI never see you anymore\n\nCome out the door\n\nIt's like you've gone away\n\nWe used to be best buddies\n\nAnd now we're not\n\nI wish you would tell me why!\n\nDo you wanna build a snowman?\n\nIt doesn't have to be a snowman\n\n(Go away, Anna)\n\nOkay, bye\n\nLET IT GO\n\nLet it go, let it go\n\nCan't hold it back anymore\n\nLet it go, let it go\n\nTurn away and slam the door\n\nI don't care what they're going to say\n\nLet the storm rage on\n\nThe cold never bothered me anyway\n\nLet it go, let it go\n\nI am one with the wind and sky\n\nLet it go, let it go\n\nYou'll never see me cry\n\nHere I stand and here I stay\n\nLet the storm rage on…\n\nSPECIAL THANKS\n\nThank you for participating in our little experiment. We hope you learned something new and enjoyed the experience. Let us know what you liked (or didn't) in our concert survey, and send us your thoughts and ideas for future concerts. Visit gbcivic.org/survey or scan the QR code in your program.\n\nIf there happens to be any popcorn left in the lobby, please feel free to take some home to enjoy tomorrow!
