        "text": "Jack Ryan, Shadow Recruit is an American thriller action movie based on author Tom Clancy’s fictitious personality Jack Ryan. This movie is the 5th installment & the 2nd relaunch of the Jack Ryan franchise and is based on an actual plot rather than a specific Tom Clancy novel version. Chris Pine plays Ryan after Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, & Ben Affleck, making him the 4th actor to play this evergreen role. David Koepp and Adam Cozad wrote the original script. Patrick Doyle composed the film’s soundtrack. In this article, let’s get to know more about the star cast of Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit movie in detail.\n\nTalking about the plot, the CIA hires Jack Ryan because of his exceptional skill. His Marine Corps experience gave him a strong body, and his education at the London School of Economics gave him a statistical mind. Ryan works for a Wall Street brokerage, where he performs covert government investigations into possible terrorist money transactions. He is dispatched abroad to conduct an audit after noticing an error in the records of a Russian named Cherevin. As Ryan arrives, an assassination attempt is launched, and he is promoted from analyst to active duty. To make matters worse, his girlfriend follows him to Russia to learn if he is having an affair.\n\nThe movie was scheduled to be in theatres on December 25, 2013, but Paramount Pictures pushed it back to January 17, 2014, to release Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street. It was released on King Martin Luther Jr. Day, January 17, 2014, in the United States. This is the finest picture for thrills and adventure. The first day of sales in North American markets for Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit was $5.4 million, rising to $17.2 million by the end of the first weekend.\n\nStarcast of Jack Ryan:\n\nChris Pine as Mr. Jack Ryan\n\nKevin Costner as Mr. Thomas Harper\n\nJohn Schwab as New York DWP Worker\n\nKeira Knightley as Dr. Catherine “Cathy” Muller\n\nLenn Kudrjawizki as Konstantin\n\nAlec Utgoff as Aleksandr Borovsky\n\nElena Velikanova playing Katya\n\nNonso Anozie as Embee Deng\n\nKaren David as FBI Lead Agent\n\nEric Michels as FBI Operative\n\nKenneth Branagh as Mr. Viktor Cherevin\n\nColm Feore as Rob Behringer.\n\nGemma Chanas as Amy Chang\n\nDavid Paymer as Dixon Lewis\n\nLeading Characters of Jack Ryan Movie:\n\nChris Pine as Jack Ryan: Acclaimed actor Chris Pine takes up the titular character, who is a phenomenal actor and has received several awards, such as the Boston Society of Film Critics Award, Teen Choice Award, etc. In the first plot, viewers watch him as a CIA agent serving in Afghanistan, where he gets a severe spine injury. After recovery, Ryan starts working for the CIA and operates covertly on Wall Street in search of suspicious monetary operations that may be signs of terrorism. In the next movie scene, we see how Chris Pine saves the city, thus marking it as one of the best scenes.\n\nKeira Knightley as Dr. Catherine “Cathy” Muller: Keira Knightley is a capable actress who has received several awards, such as Teen Choice Award, People’s Choice award, Empire Award, etc. She plays a hardworking research doctor role, specializing in infectious illnesses. She spends much of her time in her epidemiological lab and has little time or desire for a significant love connection. When Jack Ryan gets a spin injury during his Afghanistan duty, Cathy Muller helps him during the recovery time.\n\nThomas Harper plays Kevin Costner: Going ahead with the ‘Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit’ movie star cast, Thomas Harper is a renowned actor, acclaimed by the Youth Jury Prize, the BAFTA Scotland Award, the BBC New Filmmakers Award, etc. After being pleased by Ryan’s military record, Harper formally convinces him to join the Central Intelligence Agency. We also see him as Ryan’s bodyguard during his Moscow.\n\nKenneth Branagh as Viktor Cherevin: Ryan finds that billions of dollars held by Russian corporate interests have been stolen after Russia loses a crucial vote at the UN, and the markets do not react as anticipated. The U.S. economy is weak due to Cherevin’s years-long covert support for the faltering economies of China and Japan. Viktor Cherevin, a Russian tycoon, is directly or indirectly responsible for most of the lost money. Kenneth Branagh adds reality to this character through his professional acting. Kenneth Branagh received several awards in the past, such as Academy Awards, BAFTA Awards, Emmy Awards, etc.\n\nAlec Utgoff as Aleksandr Borovsky: Alec Utoff is well recognized for his roles as Aleksandr Borovsky in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit. Cherevin also used a forged death certificate to bring him to the US as a sleeper agent. After coming, he makes a full-proof plan for a terrorist attack on wall street, but Ryan catches him and saves the place.\n\nJack Ryan (Shadow Recruit) – Awards:\n\nJack Ryan: Shadow Recruit was nominated for Best Thriller Television Spot in the 2014 Golden Trailer Awards and Best Action/Adventure Film at the 2014 Saturn Awards."
