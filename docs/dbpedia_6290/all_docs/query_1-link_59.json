The tracks as they are presented in the game's Sound Test are listed and described here. Almost all of the game's music can be heard in the game's Sound Test feature, and they are given their \"official titles\" there.\n\nOpening[edit]\n\nOpening Track title Opening Universe Super Smash Bros.

Characters in the above mentioned series share their victory theme with the other characters in said series. These themes are named by the Sound Test as [Character]'s Victory (i.e. Samus's Victory). However, there are a few quirks in this naming convention:\n\nSeries with multiple characters are instead titled [Series] Team Victory (i.e. Fire Emblem Team Victory)\n\nDespite there being four characters from the Super Mario Bros. series, their victory theme is nonetheless entitled Mario's Victory.\n\nSome victory themes have their series or character's name shortened:\n\nDonkey Kong is abbreviated as \"DK.\"\n\nThe The Legend of Zelda series is shortened to simply \"Zelda.\"\n\nCaptain Falcon is abbreviated to \"Capt. Falcon.\"\n\nThe Pokémon characters' victory theme is not titled in either conventional manner, instead being called Pokémon Victory, similar to the previous game's \"Pokémon Wins.\" This implies this song as a generic theme for any Pokémon, rather than being tied to the concept of a series.\n\nMetal Battle[edit]\n\nMetal Battle Track title Metal Battle Universe Super Smash Bros.
