        "text": "It happens -- a composer is attached to a project, like John Williams and \"Titanic\", and you even see them listed on the movie posters, but come time for movie viewing (or checking out musicfromthemovies.com), you find out someone else is scoring the film. So immediately, if you know what's good for you, you come to my website to find out what the fudge is wrong. Ummm ... fudge...\n\nAnyway, the following list is for rumors, was attached to reports, and possible rejected scores (unsolved mysteries). When what happened is finally found, the title is striked out, and the answer put in bold red.\n\nClick HR lines to go back to the top of the page; \"HR lines\" are the semi translucent lines at the top of each year.\n\nNumbers by each entry only reflect count, not listing placement; the numbers automatically change by themselves when I add a new entry anywhere in the list.\n\nKEY:\n\nORIGINAL NAME OF THE FILM (AKA: Name of the film when shown) -- Rejected composer. [Replacement composer.]\n\n1933\n\nFIGHTERS -- Hanns Eisler. [Dmitri Shostakovich.]\n\nFIGHTERS -- Dmitri Shostakovich. A book explains production dragged on for a few years, and eventually he was unable to score the film. [Hans Hauska.]\n\nI MARRIED AN ANGEL -- Richard Rogers. A university that has some of his tapes and paper work, has papers for a score and songs to this film, and lists Lorenz Hart as the lyricist. The film is from 1942, the the paper work indicates 1933. [Herbert Stothart.] 1934\n\nTHE GAY DIVORCEE -- Cole Porter, R.I.P.. [Various.] 1936\n\nDER KAMPF -- Dmitri Shostakovich, R.I.P.. Offered the film but things in his life and a delay in the film by a year, kept him from scoring it. [Hans Hauska.] 1937\n\nTHE GOOD EARTH -- Arnold Schoenberg, R.I.P.. [Herbert Stothart.] 1938\n\nPYGMALION -- William Walton. According to the book David Lean (Howard Maxford), Walton turned down the offer from the producer to score the film. [Arthur Honegger.]\n\nTHE WIZARD OF OZ -- Jerome Kern, R.I.P.. .\"MGM had originally wanted Jerome Kern to score the film but Kern's doctor vetoed the idea, having prescribed rest to the songwriter who was recuperating from a recent heart attack.\" [Herbert Stothart.] 1939\n\nBABES IN ARMS -- Richard Rogers. A university that has some of his tapes and paper work, has papers for a score and songs to this film. [Nacio Herb Brown.]\n\nGONE WITH THE WIND -- Herbert Stothart. Not beliving Steiner could complete the score in time, as it wasn't going very quickly, he asked Stothart to do a score just in case; while I have no idea if Stothart recorded anything, he did write score. He appearently gloated about the assignment around town, and word of that got to Steiner, and that effectively ended Herbert's employ. [Franz Waxman.]\n\nGONE WITH THE WIND -- Franz Waxman. Still worried about Steiner, he then asked Waxman to do it. Now this is where it gets confusing, because normally I would say I have no idea if he recorded anything, but he's credited for additional music on the film -- did he or was that stock from some other score he did? Steiner finally got it together, realizing he needed to get the score done, and cranked it out; several other composers, according to IMDb, as listed as \"additional\". In a 1975 interview with Jerome Moross, conducted by book author Noah Andre Trudeau, Trudeau states while talking about tossed scores, that Waxman did a complete score for the film. [Max Steiner; IMDb credited \"additional\" folk: Adolph Deutsch, Hugo Friedhofer, Heinz Roemheld, and of course Waxman (inspite of IMDb listing it as \"stock\"). William Axt (stock music).] 1941\n\nSOLITUDINE -- Unsure. imdb.com lists both Mario Nascimbene and Ettore Montanaro [Unsure.] 1942\n\nTHE COMMANDOS STRIKE AT DAWN -- Igor Stravinsky. Stravinsky quietly recycled the music as Four Norwegian Moods. The first time he composed a movie score and they rejected it. Supposedly recording the score before even seeing the movie. [Louis Gruenberg, John Leipold.]\n\nJANE EYRE -- Igor Stravinsky. Negotiations failed.. [Bernard Herrmann.] 1943\n\nA GUY NAMED JOE -- Kaper. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Herbert Stothart.]\n\nFOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS -- Francisco Avellan. An old news article said he was hired to score the film. [Victor Young.]\n\nSTORMY WEATHER -- William Grant Still. Was hired to score the film. [Cyril J. Mockridge.] 1944\n\nLAURA -- Alred Newman / Bernard Herrmann. Newman didn't have the time and Herrmann turned it down; I wonder if the last one involved cursing.... [David Raksin.]\n\nSONG OF BERNADETTE -- Found: \"Ironically, Newman replaced the famous composer Igor Stravinsky on the film, and the second movement of Stravinskys Symphony in Three Movements evolved from his original unused score.\" [Alfred Newman.] 1945\n\nBEAU BRUMMELL -- Miklos Rozsa. Supposedly did an entire score, with only bits -- like the end credits, left in.\n\nCORRECTION:\n\nHere's an excerpt from Rozsa's autobiography, Double Life:\n\n\"The only other occasion when I let myself in for rewriting part of someone else's score was in the 1950s when I was on the Music staff at MGM. Producer Sam Zimbalist came back from London with a picture called Beau Brummel, dissatisfied with the music provided by an English composer. He felt that the whole beginning and end were wrond, and asked me to provide new music. My contract with MGM specified that I should not interfere with any other composer's music, nor should anyone interfere with mine. However, since Zimbalist was a personal friend, I agreed to make an exception in this case, on condition that I received no screen credit. Now that the composer whose music I replaced is dead, there seems no harm in saying that the whole of the final scene, where Beau Brummel takes his leave of the dying king, is mine.\" [Richard Addinsell, Miklos rozsa (leftovers?).]\n\nTHE TRUE GLORY -- Marc Blitzstein. Alwyn's book tells that the original composer fell ill. [William Alwyn.] 1946\n\nBECAUSE OF HIM -- Hans J. Salter. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Miklos Rozsa, R.I.P..] 1947\n\nTHE OCTOBER MAN -- Kenneth Pakeman. Alwyn's book tells: \"The score was assigned to Kenneth Pakeman, whose film experience was a couple documentaries for Rotha and another for Greenpark. Pakeman wrote three sketches before the film went into production, but his music was dropped, ...\". [William Alwyn.]\n\nTIME OUT OF MIND -- Ferde Grofe. Wrote a score which was not used, unknown if any of it was recorded. [Miklos Rozsa, Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco (stock music?).] 1948\n\nPORTRAIT OF JENNIE -- Bernard Herrmann. imdb.com lists him as uncredited. Did some cues and a song, but only the song remained; he was going to score the whole film and arrange music, but the film's production got pushed back and Herrmann had other committments. [Dimitri Tiomkin.]\n\nTHE RED SHOES -- Allan Gray. As told in the book The Red Shoes: Turner Classic Movies British Film Guide, Gray was asked to do the score, but he was slow turning it out and when he did, what he wrote was not liked; he was allowed to continue until two more weeks had passed and director Emeric Pressburger, ended it. [Brian Easdale.] 1948\n\nOUTRAGE (AKA: THE LAWLESS) -- Paul Sawtell. An old news blurb said he was signed to do the score. [Mahlon Merrick.] 1949\n\nCALAMITY JANE AND SAM BASS -- Walter Scharf. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Milton Schwarzwald.]\n\nMY FRIEND IRMA -- Leigh Harline. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Roy Webb.] 1950\n\nBRIGHT LEAF -- Dimitri Tiomkin. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Victor Young.]\n\nCOUNTY FAIR -- Edward J. Kay. An old article on the film (back in 1945) said a news reported claimed he was hired to score it, but it was unconfirmed. [Ozzie Caswell.]\n\nGUILTY OF TREASON -- Dimitri Tiomkin. An old article on the film said Tiomkin had been orginally signed. [Emil Newman; Hugo Freidhofer (stock?).]\n\nLAWLESS -- Arthor Morton. [.] 1953\n\nKNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE -- Clifton Parker. A brief cue by Parker, source music in the castle, retained. [Miklos Rozsa.]\n\nTONGA TIKA -- Unsure. imdb.com lists both Victor Young and Les Baxter. [Unsure] 1955\n\nTHE KENTUCKIAN -- Roy Webb? UA's press book in UK says Webb was the composer. Obviously not, but he did score MARTY for the same producers the year before. Was he just penciled in as possible composer, or did he actually compose a rejected score? [Bernard Herrmann.]\n\nTHE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT -- John Hotchkis. Supposedly Hotchkis became ill and couldn't do the score. [James Bernard.] 1956\n\nTHE SWAN -- Miklos Rozsa. [Bronislau Kaper.]\n\nTHE TEN COMMANDMENTS -- Victor Young. Supposedly Mr. Young's \"Overture\" still exists on some release prints (this may just be inaccurate information spread around). But it is also said he only got as far as sketching some dance music. Contrary to popular knowledge, Young did write some music for the film; he did a couple source music cues, which -- best of any information I could find -- were not recorded (even in a demo recording form). In 2016 Intrada Records released the complete score, along with alternates and un-used score and an early demo, Bernstein score along with re-masters of the re-recordings. [Elmer Bernstein.] 1957\n\nA FAREWELL TO ARMS -- Max Steiner. According to score boards member Joe Caps (who never replied to me .. Mr. Capps..., and who also mistakinly listed Alfred Newman and \"Anne Frank\"), \"A Suymmer Place\" uses two of the themes. Steiner didn't do a score though. [Mario Nascimbene.]\n\nSAYONARA -- George Duning. Duning stated in a 1994 Soundtrack! magazine interview that Josh Logan wanted him to score the film, but a theme from a song by Irving Berlin made for the film made him decline after he realized he would not be able to do a score based on Berlin's theme. [Franz Waxman.]\n\nTHE VINTAGE -- Bronislau Kaper. FSM notes that, when releasing Raksin's score, they found Kaper possibly scored the film, but paper work and tapes are missing. [David Raksin.] 1958\n\nTHE DEFIENT ONES -- George Antheil. Was going to do the score it, but right before the music was to be done (no idea if he started writing), he died of a heart attack. [Ernest Gold.]\n\nTEACHER'S PET -- Irvin Talbot. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Roy Webb.]\n\nTOO MUCH, TOO SOON -- Albert Glasser. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score.. [Ernest Gold.]\n\nSTAGE STRUCK -- Bernard Herrmann. According to a March 9, 1957 issue of Billboard magazine, Herrmann was going to score the film. [Alex North.] 1959\n\nON THE BEACH -- George Antheil. Was going to do the score, but could not. [Ernest Gold.]\n\nTHE REDEEMER -- ?????. Raksin tells in an interview, \"they had a score written for it, but it turned out badly\", but doesn't say who or if it was recorded. IMDb.com lists a foreign composer with Raksin. [David Raksin.]\n\nSIGN OF THE GLADIATOR -- Angelo F. Lavagnino. Was this a rescore for U.S. prints? [Dominic Frontiere?]\n\nSOLOMON AND SHEBA -- Malcolm Arnold. Arnold did a couple cues for the film later after the director changed his mind on leaving two without score; Mario, for what ever reason, did not do it. [Mario Nascimbene.]\n\nTHIS EARTH IS MINE -- Franz Waxman. An old billboard magazine news blurb reported that Waxman would compose and conduct a score for this film. [Hugo Friedhofer.] 1960\n\nBELLS ARE RINGING -- Jule Styne. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Andre Previn.]\n\nTHE CRIMINAL -- Richard Lester (yes, the director). Lester had already scored one film, and was asked to score this -- according to himself -- but had to drop out for unspecified reasons. [John Dankworth.]\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN -- Dimitri Tiomkin. In the new 2015 book The Making of The Magnificent Seven: Behind the Scenes of the Pivotal Western, it states Tiokin was considered and passed on. [Aaron Copeland.]\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN -- Aaron Copeland. >The book also says Copeland was considered. [Alex North.]\n\nTHE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN -- Aaron Copeland. >Finally the book says North was considered as well. [Elmer Bernstein.]\n\nWHERE THE BOYS ARE -- Joe Sherman (composer of some episode of the series \"In the Heat of the Night\"). [George Stoll; Calvin Jackson, Pete Rugolo (additional, \"Original Dialectic Jazz by\").] 1961\n\nLOLA -- Quincy Jones. Jones was hired (in 1959) to score the film, but three days later -- after viewing it, had to back out. [Michel Legrand.]\n\nQUO VADIS -- Mario Nascimbene. In a 1986 interview with Soundtrack! magazine, Nascimbene was asked about rumors of having scored the film, because of a quote in Rozsa's autobiography; Nascimbene explains producer Samuel Bronston asked him to write some dance themes (which Mario did, saying of them \"tympani, with a rather brutal, violent rhythm, without any real melody\"), then he was asked to score the film and when he came to America, Bronston showed him a pile of work from Jules Massenet's opera El cid, and told him that was the score, to essentially adapt it; Nascimbene found Bronston's behavior offenssive, flew home, tore up the contract, and Bronston apparently lied to Rozsa about not liking a score by Nascimbene, which in reality was never composed. [Miklos Rozsa.] 1962\n\nDAMON AND PYTHIAS -- Frank Loesser. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Angelo F. .]\n\nEVA -- Miles Davis, R.I.P.. First choice. [Michel Legrand.]\n\nTHE FOUR HORSEMEN OF THE APOCALYPSE -- Alex North, R.I.P.. [Andre Previn.]\n\nHOW THE WEST WAS WON -- Tiomkin:\n\n\"While How The West Was Won was still in the planning stages, producer Bernard Smith envisioned it should have a score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Initially, Tiomkin had expressed interest, but he was forced to bow out of the project following eye surgery, and Alfred Newman was brought in as a replacement.\"; the reality is, however, that he was replaced as composer and sued MGM over being replaced.\n\nHATARI -- Dimitri Tiomkin, R.I.P.. Tiomkin was hired by the director to score the film and he said no strings, along with another order on scoring; two or three days later Dimitri called him asking if he was serious, and the director fired him right there over the phone. [Hoagy Carmichael, R.I.P..]\n\nIPNOSI -- Francesco De Masi, R.I.P.. [Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, Roman Vlad (together?).]\n\nLAWRENCE OF ARABIA -- Richard Rodgers. May have recorded, but at least a dozen cues were written. [Three guys.]\n\nLAWRENCE OF ARABIA -- Walton (for the marches), Khatchaturian (arabic music) & Arnold (the rest). Wanted too long to score it supposedly, but according to one of them in an interview, upon watching the film, they found they hated it. [Benjamin Britten.]\n\nLAWRENCE OF ARABIA -- Benjamin Britten. Wanted too long to score it as well. [Maurice Jarre.]\n\nLE SETTE SPADE DEL VENDICATORE -- Francesco De Masi, R.I.P.. [Franco Mannino.]\n\nSODOM AND GOMORRAH -- Dimitri Tiomkin. An old news blurb mentions Tiomkin dropped out to do an \"eye operation\". [Mario Nascimbene.]\n\nSODOM AND GOMORRAH -- Mario Nascimbene. In a 1986 interview with Soundtrack! magazine, Nascimbene said he rejected an offer to score the film. [Miklos Rozsa.] 1963\n\nTHE RUNNING MAN -- Ron Grainer. Grainer redid the main theme only. [Alwyn.] 1964\n\nTHE COOL WORLD -- Dizzy Gillespie. An old news article said Dizzy was hired to score the film, but appearently later on he turned it down for some reason, yet he did play on Waldron's score, and an LP by the name of the film, with instrumental scoring not of Waldron's doing, was released. [Mal Waldron.]\n\nMARY POPPINS -- Nelson Riddle. In the biographal book, September In the Rain, Riddle says he was offered, but turned down scoring the film. [Irwin Kostal.]\n\nTHE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA -- Alex North, R.I.P.. Turned down scoring the picture and didn't care for it. [Benjamin Frankel.]\n\nTHE PAWNBROKER -- John Cage. Lumet, the director, said in an interview he asked Cage, but Cage wasn't interested in doing a movie score. [Gil Evans.]\n\nTHE PAWNBROKER -- Gil Evans. Evans turned it down and suggested Jones. [John Lewis.]\n\nTHE PAWNBROKER -- John Lewis. Lumet, in the same interview, said he showed the film to Lewis, but didn't think Lewis liked it, so he moved on to find another composer. [Quincy Jones.] 1965\n\nA RAGE TO LIVE -- Dominic Frontiere. An old Billboard article said he scored it (with Diahann Lampert on the song). [Nelson Riddle.]\n\nJULIET OF SPIRITS -- Morton Gould, R.I.P.. Turns out this was confused with the musical, which Gould scored, that the film was based off of. [Nina Rota.]\n\nMISTER MOSES -- Dominic Frontiere. An old Billboard article said he scored it (with Ferrante & Teicher on the song). The tapes for Barry's score are missing (maybe destroyed), so if Frontiere did do a score, one would assume unless recorded elsewhere, his score is gone, too. [John Barry.]\n\nTHE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD -- Ray Martin. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Sol Kaplan, R.I.P..]\n\nTHE TRAIN-- Leroy Holmes. An old Billboard article said he scored it (with Noel Sherman on the song). There is a 7\" LP promo with one piece called the \"theme\" from \"The Train\" -- one would assume, if not a song, this is a score cue from his rejected score (anybody have that and can confirm?). [Maurice Jarre.] 1966\n\nA FINE MADNESS -- ?????. Among some changes to the film, according to one source, was a new score. [John Addison.]\n\nBRIDES OF FU MANCHU -- Johnny Douglas. Dropped out; don't know if he did anything or not. [Bruce Montgomery, Douglas Gamely (additional).]\n\nTHE BIBLE -- Miklos Rozsa. [then Ennio Morricone (rejected), then finally ToshirÃ´ Mayuzumi.]\n\nCAST A GIANT SHADOW -- Dov Seltzer. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P..]\n\nTHE FAMILY WAY -- Bernard Herrmann. Turned it down when offered. [Paul McCartney.]\n\nGRAND PRIX -- Jerry Goldsmith. Information from Deconstructing Goldsmith:\n\nEVIDENCE: July 11th 1995 - Jerry Goldsmith interview on America On Line (AOL Online Host).\n\nQuestion: Jerrald, I've listened to and admired your work for many, many years. THE SAND PEBBLES is a personal favorite. Were there any unique challenges, or anecdotes about doing that score?\n\nGoldsmithJ: Yes. Originally I was supposed to do GRAND PRIX, but I was under contract to 20th Century Fox at that time and Alex North was supposed to do THE SAND PEBBLES, but he got sick, so Fox preempted me out of GRAND PRIX, and to my good fortune, I got to do THE SAND PEBBLES. It was my first time working with Robert Wise and it was a great experience.\n\nTHE MOVING TARGET (AKA: HARPER) -- Andre Previn. Appearently a fairly late replacement, as many sources were still citing Previn as having done the score. At least one song in the film is credited to Previn; it was also stated he was starting to write it right after finishing \"Inside Daisy Clover\". [Johnny Mandel.]\n\nNO TOYS FOR CHRISTMAS (AKA: ONCE BEFORE I DIE) -- Richard LaSalle. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score.. [Emmanual Vardi.]\n\nPISTOLS 'N' PETTICOATS: \"Pilot\" -- Jack Marshall. An old BMI newsletter reported Marshall had score this. [Russ Garcia.]\n\nTHE SAND PEBBLES -- Alex North. North became sick and had to drop out. Didn't find out whether he has begun recording. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nSECONDS -- Quincy Jones. In a interview with Jones, mention was made that he'd completed \"The Pawnbroker\" and was preparing to score this film. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nTHIS GUN FOR HIRE -- Jack Marshall. An old BMI newsletter reported Marshall had score this pilot which ultimately failed; it ended up airing as an episode of \"Laredo\" titled \"Above the Law\" and with a different composer. [Russ Garcia.]\n\nYOU'RE A BIG BOY NOW -- John Sebastian (the film composer, not the long-gone classical composer). An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Robert Prince.] 1967\n\nBONNIE AND CLYDE -- Earl Scruggs. Hired to score the film and his band was going to perform it; don't know if it was done. Charles Strouse.]\n\nBONNIE AND CLYDE -- Charles Strouse. FSM: EUGENE IEMOLA:\n\n\"the rejected score to BONNIE AND CLYDE by Charles Strouse. The trailer has some of it and the Exit music exists on the DVD, but what of the rest of the score?\"\n\nThe answer being he didn't do any score than that really.\n\nLUV -- Burt Bachrach. Was assigned to score the film, but had to back out to finish scoring \"Casino Royale\". [Gerry Mulligan.]\n\nMIDWAY -- John Cacavas. In a book, Cacavas says the director wanted him to score the film, but Williams was hot at that time. [John Williams.]\n\nTOBRUK -- Quincy Jones. Was hired to score the film. [Bronislau Kaper.]\n\nSADISMO/MONDO SADISMO -- ?????. Baxter scored US prints only. Original composer? [Les Baxter.]\n\nIN COLD BLOOD -- Leonard Bernstein. One of the studio people clashed over Jones scoring the film just because he was black, as Jones recants in a story, and that they wanted Leonard Bernstein to score it. [Quincy Jones.]\n\nKILL A DRAGON -- Richard LaSalle. An old news blurd reported LaSalle had scored the film (this was months before it opened in the U.S.) with a song by Buddy Kaye. [Philip Springer.]\n\nWELCOME TO HARD TIMES -- Dimitri Tiomkin. As documented on the official website of the late composer, Tiomkin was hired to score the film; there were talks for a week and a few months of letters back and forth, Dimitri was announced, but for unspecified reasons he was dropped and told he would not be paid for any work he did during that time. Sukman was coincidently, food friends with Tiomkin. [Harry Sukman.] 1968\n\nTHE CATCHABLES (AKA: THE TOUCHABLES) -- Traffic. An old news article on Billbaord reported the music group was going to score the film; the film contains at least one song by them, in the opening. [Ken Thorne.]\n\nTHE DEVIL'S BRIGADE -- Elmer Bernstein. Billboard reported Bernstein had scored the film, and their track record -- at least for every assignement I read in their papers -- has been 100% accurate, with rejections listed as well. [Alex North.]\n\nHELLFIGHTERS -- John Williams. According to Rosenman, Williams was supposed to score it, but Williams got appendicitis (seems to me there must be a lot of appendicitis doctors in Hollywood...). [Leonard Rosenman.]\n\nICE STATION ZEBRA -- Jerry Goldsmith. Turned it down to score PLANET OF THE APES. [Michael Legrand.]\n\nKILLERS THREE -- Merle Haggard. An old news blurb mentioned that he would do the score, on top of the song for the film. [Mike Curb, Harley Hatcher, Jerry Styner.]\n\nL'ODISSEA (mini series) -- ?????. Rustichelli explains in an interview he had very little time to score each episode because he came on late, taking over for an un-named composer whom he said turned out to not be up to the task (he makes no word on whether anything had been recorded). [Carlo Rustichelli.]\n\nLATIGO -- The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Along with a song, were also hired to score the film. [Jeff Alexander.]\n\nTHE LOST CONTINENT -- Nino Rota, R.i.P.. Letters were sent to Rota and he was asked to score the film; I have no idea what happened after that. [Frankel (rejected); Gerard Schurmann; Howard blake (source music -- I will of course inquire further on if he also did a score which was not used...).]\n\nNIGHT HUNT -- Sammy Fain. An old report in Billbaord said Fain was scoring the film. [Harry Sukman.]\n\nSHALAKO -- John Barry. From a February 1979 interview handled by Martin Crosthwaite; when asked about why he doesn't do many westerns or horror films, replied: \"No, I think itâs due to the fact that most of the time up through the past few years I was using England as my base for writing and we don't make westerns out of England. I was offered one with Sean Connery and Brigitte Bardot, Shalako, which I thought I might like to do. Then I saw the film and decided I didn't. So there was an opportunity.\" (also adding he had never been offered a horror film). [Robert Farnon.]\n\nTHE SWEET RIDE -- Lee Hazelwood. An old article mentioned he was hired to score the film, and also have an acting role. [Pete Rugolo.]\n\nTHE PICASSO SUMMER -- Randy Newman. An old article mentioned he was hired to \"compose, arrange and score\" the film, along with providing the title song. Supposedly the film got changed a good deal and that necessitated a new score. [Michel Legrand.] 1969\n\n80 STEPS TO JONAH. David White & Erik Faulkner. An old Billboard article said they not only did the songs, but the score as well. [George Shearing.]\n\nTHE APRIL FOOLS -- Burt Bacharach. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score; ASCAP lists registered cues. [Marvin Hamlisch.]\n\nANNE OF A THOUSAND DAYS -- John Barry. In a February 1979 interview handled by Martin Crosthwaite, Barry was asked if he ever turned any films down and replied: \"I was going to do Love Story (1970) when the director Anthony Harvey, was involved with it. I also turned down Anne of the Thousand Days (1969), but overall I've been pretty lucky in that sense.\". [Georges Delerue.]\n\nTHE ARRANGEMENT -- Manos Hadijidakis, R.I.P.. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [David Amram.]\n\nCAMILLE 2000 -- Armondo Trovajoli. Supposedly dropped out at the last minute. [Piero Piccioni.]\n\nDAVID COPPERFIELD -- John Williams. Scheduling conflict with \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\". [Malcolm Arnold.]\n\nTHE MAGIC CHRISTIAN -- Paul McCartney. Mention was made McCartney was asked to score the film, but wasn't excited about doing it. Another source said Lennon was writing the score with him. [Ken Thorne.]\n\nMAROONED -- Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind. Were originally hired to score the film (I can't recall the story if they did or didn't). [No original score.]\n\nTHE WILD BUNCH -- Lalo Schifrin. Feldman had wanted Schifrin, but Peckinpah wanted Feidling. [Jerry Feilding.] 1970\n\nTHE BATTLE OF NERETVA -- Vladimir Kraus-Rajteric. Herrmann scored the English language version. The USSR print of this Yugoslav picture was wholly or partially rescored by Soviet composer(s). [Bernard Herrmann.]\n\nBENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES -- Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nEVIDENCE: 1996 - Jerry Goldsmith interview for the Special Edition LaserDisc release of PATTON.\n\nAt one point in the interview Jerry Goldsmith mentions that he was originally the composer signed to write the score to BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES; however, Frank Schaffner went to the Fox brass and insisted that Goldsmith do PATTON instead. Also in his discussion, Goldsmith alludes to the fact that he had already started his BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES score...\n\nDIAL HOT LINE -- Stanley Wilson. [Oliver Nelson.]\n\nLOVE STORY -- John Barry. In a February 1979 interview handled by Martin Crosthwaite, Barry was asked if he ever turned any films down and replied: \"I was going to do Love Story (1970) when the director Anthony Harvey, was involved with it. I also turned down Anne of the Thousand Days (1969), but overall I've been pretty lucky in that sense.\". [Jimmy Webb (rejected), then Francis Lai.]\n\nTHE MOONSHINE WAR -- Neal Hefti? Credited to Karger, but with additional music by Hefti. As Hefti scored four previously for director Richard Quine, I assume he was first choice for this one, but MGM had Karger rescore most of it. True?. [Fred Karger; Neal Hefti (additional).]\n\nMYRA BRECKINRIDGE -- Rod McKuen. An old news blurb said he had been signed to do the score. [John Phillips.]\n\nTHE OVER-THE-HILL GANG RIDES AGAIN -- Hugo Friedhoffer. Earle Hagen tells in his book, Memoirs of A Famous Composer Nobody Ever Heard Of, that he suggested they hire Hugo again, which worked, until the next day when they changed their minds. After having trouble picking a composer, they settled on Raksin. Things didn't go well, and producer Aaron Spelling walked out during the scoring of the first reel; on their end they tried to save as much, but used Hagen's suggestion to re-record music from the first film (because of union music rules), so Hagen re-did some score from the first film, after a session of \"The Mod Squad\"; the network was happy and surprised Rakin could do that after having worked on \"Bonanza\" for so many years, at which Hagen told them that was David Rose, and the reply Hagen says he got from them, says it all: \"Huh?\". If you like stories like this, the book is recommended. [David Raksin.]\n\nPERFORMANCE -- Randy Newman. [Jack Nitzsche.]\n\nUPON THIS ROCK (TV movie) -- William Walton. As the Lewis tells in an old interview, Walton was offered the film, but turned it down; after the \"Battle of Britain\", he was no longer interested in scoring movies. [Michael J. Lewis.] 1971\n\nA CLOCKWORK ORANGE -- Ennio Morricone. In a February mini ivideo nterview for Channel 4, Morricone explains he was asked by the director to score the film and accepted. But the director of another film he had finished scoring, told Kubrick that Ennio wasn't done; he lost the job and Kubrick never called him again. He expressed how deeply he wished he had scored the film. [No original score; Wendy Carlos (additional); Erika Eigen (additional?).]\n\nCLAY PIGEON -- Tommy Boyce & Bobby Hart. An old artilce says they were going to score the film. [.]\n\nTHE DAY OF THE WOLVES -- Ferde Grofe. An old article said he was going to score the film; Mr. Grofe also served in other capacities on the film, including a producer; one can assume the schedule and multiple positions just proved to be too much to handle with the addition of a score. [Sean Bonniwell.]\n\nDR. JECKYLL & SISTER HYDE -- Harry Robinson. Whitaker mentions in an old interview he was asked to score the film, replacing a composer who was having disagreements with the director; Robinson said in an interview he did not like the movie and asked to be let go. Before leaving, he suggested Whitaker as a replacement. [David Whitaker.]\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY, WANDA JUNE -- Duke Ellington. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Hal Schuler.]\n\nTHE KREMLIN LETTER -- Toshiro Mayuzumi. Many listings have him along side Drasnin as composer, and he had worked twice before with the director. I can't confirm this, as I don't own the CD, but appearently the linear notes for Drasnin's score infact mention Mayuzumi in fact having done a score, but goes into no further detail. [Robert Drasnin.]\n\nPSYCHOMANIA -- David Whitaker. [John Cameron.] 1972\n\nBLACK BELT BROTHERS -- Eddie Harris, R.I.P.. An old article reported Harris would be making his film scoring debut by scoring this film. [Charles Earland.]\n\nBROTHER SUN, SISTER MOON -- Leonard Bernstein. Was chosen to score it, but don't know if he did or didn't. [Riz Ortolani (overseas) / Ken Thorne (U.S.).]\n\nCOME BACK, CHARLESTON BLUE -- Quincy Jones. An old artilce says Jones was hired to do the score; two or three months later the same magazine reported the replacement composer as being hired. [Donny Hathaway.]\n\nTHE HOT ROCK -- Phil Spector. An old news article, I think it was in Billboard, reported Spector would be doing his first film score for this film. Spector, whom had otherwise made a career in the song and music industry, currently is in prison on a murder conviction. [Quincy Jones.]\n\nTHE REVENGERS -- Pino Calvi. Shot in Mexico, and presumably scored there. The Calvi version played in UK. Did Matz rescore the US print? [Peter Matz?]\n\nLIVING FREE -- John Barry. In a February 1979 interview handled by Martin Crosthwaite, Barry was asked why he didn't score this sequel, he replied: \" I was asked to do Living Free (1972) after Born Free (1966), but I refused because I don't think you can pull it off twice. You might be lucky. I think the 'Bond' and 'Pink Panther' films are a unique exception. I thought it would be best to have someone else score Zulu Dawn and so I let it be known I wasn't interested.\". [Sol Kaplan.] 1973\n\nA DOLL'S HOUSE -- John Dankworth. In a 1976 interview with Soundtrack! magazine, Dankworth stated he was offered the film, but turned it down because he thought it was immoral to put music in the film. Reportedly the film only contains one cue by Legrand. [Michel Legrand.]\n\nCLEOPATRA JONES -- Joe Simon. An old issue of JET says Simon was going to do the film's score, \"joining the ranks\" of songwriters who had crossed over to scoring. [Roger Kelleway.]\n\nCLEOPATRA JONES -- Roger Kellaway. An old news article that said he had recorded a score at the new Burbank Studios, was false and jsut very poorly written; Kellaway did two pre-recorded songs, arranged and conducted, \"Am I Blue?\" and \"Swing Down Chariot\". [J.J. Johnson; Carl Brandt (additional).]\n\nTHE EXORCIST -- George Crumb. Recalls in an interview he was asked to the score the film, but declined as he wasn't interested in scoring films. [Lalo Schifrin (rejected), then Jack Nitesche (rejected), no original score.]\n\nJEREMY -- ?????. In a 2016 interview, Holdridge said he was a replacement composer on the film, but doesn't say who the original composer was or any further details. [Lee Holdridge.]\n\nLIVE AND LET DIE (James Bond) -- John Barry. In a February 1979 interview handled by Martin Crosthwaite, Barry was asked why he didn't score the film and replied: \"I was doing Billy for the London stage at the time and also had fallen out with the producer Harry Saltzman (but not with Cubby). So it was a combination of the two things.\". [George Martin.]\n\nMOSES THE LAWGIVER -- Anthony Burgess, R.I.P.. According to Burgess, Producer Lew Grade rejected him. Supposedly Burgess only got as far as piano sketches. [Ennio Morricone.]\n\nPAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID -- Jerry Fielding, R.I.P.. The producers wanted Fieldingand Dylan to work together, but Fielding didn't exactly agree and backed out; Dylan was offered to score the film. [Bo Dylan.]\n\nTHE STING -- Joshua Rifkin. Was asked to score it, but had prior committments. [Marvin Hamlisch.] 1974\n\nTHE GIRL FROM PETROVKA -- Roy Budd. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Henry Mancini.]\n\nTHE GREAT GATSBY -- Andre Previn. Was asked to score it, but turned it down. [Nelson Riddle.]\n\nTHE HAPPY PRINCE -- Howard Blake. Blake says on his website that after being hired, writing a theme for the bird, and a song, he called the director and found out they hired Goodwin. Calling Goodwin up, he got a terese reply on the situation. [Ron Goodwin.]\n\nLAW AND DISORDER -- Aaron Copland, R.I.P.. In an interview, Badalamenti says this:\n\n\"... He'd just finished Law and Disorder for them, a cop movie starring Carroll O'Connor and Ernest Borgnine. Id read the script, which was floating around the office, and was inspired enough to write some music for it on spec. So I caught Ivan as he was about to go out the door and told him how much I loved the script. Then I said, \"Ivan, I'd like to play something for you.\" And he said, \"Oh, I've got to go down and mail a letter. But I tell you what. Why don't you play me this music before I go?\" So I played the themes for Carroll and Ernest, then showed Ivan how I could make the themes work together. Ivan really flipped over the music and asked me to score the film. I'd never done a movie before and immediately said yes. Then Ivan said, \"You're lucky I didn't mail this letter.\" I asked him why, and Ivan took the letter out of his coat pocket. It was addressed to a composer he wanted named Aaron Copland! Ivan ripped the letter up and threw it in the garbage. ...\"\n\n[Angelo Badalamenti.]\n\nMAME -- Fred Werner. An old news article said he had recorded the score at the Burbank Studios (which was still new at the time). [Jerry Herman.]\n\nNEWMAN'S LAW -- Billy Goldenberg. An old news blurb mentioned scores that would be recorded at Universal's stage in the next \"four weeks\", and this was one of them; Goldenberg was noted to also conduct the score, too. [Robert Prince.] 1975\n\nBARRY LYNDON -- Howard Blake. In an interview Blake said he was asked to score the film, but he turned it down to continue on a piano quartet he was doing. [Leonard Rosenman, R.I.P..]\n\nTHE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE -- Jack Nitzsche. Offered, but declined. [David Shire.]\n\nW.W. AND THE DANCEKINGS -- Bill Conti. According to an article on Conti over at RunMovies (home of Soundtrack! magazine), Conti had met the director but Burt Reynolds stepped in and called up Lionel Newman because he wanted somebody else. No huge loss as the director then recommended Conti for another film: \"Rocky\"; to this day Conti is still known for his score and song to the \"Rocky\" film while Reynolds is known as that guy who used to be famous that also had a mustache. [Dave Grusin.] 1976\n\nA STAR IS BORN -- Richard Perry. A book on the actress, singer, says he was hired to score the film, but quit. [Rupert Holmes.]\n\nA STAR IS BORN -- Rupert Holmes. A book on the actress, singer, says he was hired to score the film, but quite. [Rupert Holmes.]\n\nA STAR IS BORN -- Rupert Holmes. Various reports say he was working on the score, and some cite songs; he did at least two songs which were not used. [Roger Kellaway.]\n\nBAROCCO -- Ennio Morricone. [Philippe Sarde.]\n\nCARRIE -- Bernard Herrmann. Obviously not rejected, but was set to score the film until his death. [Pino Donaggio.]\n\nFAMILY PLOT -- ?????. In a news article from 1996, the following story was recanted:\n\nHe was not the first to have been assigned that job and remembers asking the old boy why it hadn't worked out with the previous composer. \"Well,\" said Hitchcock, \"he kept writing this oppressive, lugubrious music.\" \"But surely that's appropriate in a movie about murder?\" replied Williams. \"No, Mr Williams, you must understand - murder can be fun.\"\n\n[John Williams.]\n\nGOD TOLD ME TO -- Miklos Rozsa, R.I.P.. When the director asked him, he replied: \"God told me not to.\". [Bernard Herrmann, R.I.P..]\n\nGOD TOLD ME TO -- Bernard Herrmann. Met up with the director (after finishing scoring \"Taxi Driver\"), watched the film, mades notes on how he was going to score it, then died less than 24 hours later. [Frank Cordell.]\n\nROBIN AND MARIAN -- Maurice Jarre. Turned it down after finding out Legrand had been rejected.\n\nROCKY -- David Shire. In an interview, Shire states if was too busy working on two other films at the same time (one \"The Big Bus\"), that he had to turn this offer down; totally regrets it. [Bill Conti.]\n\nTHE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION -- Bernard Herrmann. An old news blurb mentions he was signed to do the score, but he passed away before he could (or did he?). [John Addison.]\n\nTHE QUEST -- Billy Goldenberg. An old billboard magazine blurb mentioned Goldenberg had been hired to score this. [Richard Shores.]\n\nA WHALE OF A TALE -- Herb Bernstein. An old BMI newsletter reported Bernstein was scoring it (reported in 1965). [Jonathan Cain.] 1977\n\n????? -- David Bowie. Bowie's site mentions in late 1977, he attended a screening for a film he was asked to score, but IMDb shows no scoring projects that early for him. [?????.]\n\nTHE DEEP -- John Williams. An old news blurb mentioned that Williams would do the score. [John Barry.]\n\nIL DESERTO DEI TARTARI -- Mario Nascimbene. In a 1986 interview with Soundtrack! magazine, Nascimbene saiys he regretted not scoring the film. [Ennio Morricone.]\n\nGULLIVER'S TRAVELS -- Peter Hunt mentioned in an interview that John Barry and Black had written a substantial amount, but when the film went into financial hiatus, and was effectively locked up, the whole project got shelved. When the finance came back, Hunt contacted Barry and Black, but Barry had withdrawn his music by then. Did he record anything though? [Michel Legrand.]\n\nTHE HILLS HAVE EYES -- Martin Heller. An old news article reported he had been hired to score the film; this is the only know credit for this obscure musician. Hitchcock Media Records released the replacement score, they also released the replacement score to \"The People Under the Stairs\", and not the rejected score, so there's a chance Heller did his score. [Don Peake.]\n\nMATI (AKA: BEYOND REASON) -- John Cacavas. An old report stated Koch, one of the producers, had hired Cacavas to do the score. [Robert Randles.]\n\nMIDNIGHT EXPRESS -- Vangelis. In a DVD commentary, the director reveals he wanted Vangelis to score the film, but the studio felt otherwise; he points out now, Vangelis is famous (yet, for all 11 films later, he did not hire Vangelis). [Giorgio Moroder.]\n\nPETE'S DRAGON -- Al Kaska & Joel Hirschoen. An old news blurb said they were doing the songs, and score; the article was just lacking a more informative explination -- the two did the songs and the general score, and Kostal did score arrangements. [Irwin Kostal.]\n\nTHE SENTINEL -- John Williams. Supposedly backed out at the last minute. [Gil Melle, R.I.P..]\n\nTHE SPY WHO LOVED ME (James Bond) -- John Barry. In a February 1979 interview handled by Martin Crosthwaite, Barry was asked why he didn't score the film and replied: \"Right. The union rules are that if the picture is made in England, the score must be done in London, and I no longer work there. The new Bond film, Moonraker, is an Anglo-French co-production; and therefore it will be recorded in Paris. So Iâll be doing it there.\". [Marvin Hamlisch.]\n\nTWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING -- Frank DeVol. Had to bow out at the last minute because of health issues, supposedly. [Jerry Goldsmith.] 1978\n\nTHE FURY -- Bernard Herrmann. Not rejected, but according to Varese Sarabande, \"...would have been scored by the legendary Bernard Herrmann, if not for his untimely passing...\". [John Williams.]\n\nTHE GREAT BRAIN -- Don Costa. An old news blurb said he had been signed to do the score. [Merrill B. Jenson.]\n\nKING OF THE GYPSIES -- Jimmie Haskell. [David Grisman, Mike Marshall and John Carlini(additional); Jimmie Haskell (leftovers?).]\n\nMIDNIGHT EXPRESS -- Jean Michael Jarre. Jean told in an early July, 2013 Q&A at the International Music Summit, that he was offered the film but turned it down. [Giorgio Moroder.]\n\nSIX WEEKS -- Marvin Hamlisch. An old news report said David Seltzer would being doing a film based on the Fred Stewarts book, and that Hamlisch was scoring it; based on the plot and checking IMDb, there is no film matching this; I have no idea if it was shelved or never made. [Marvin Hamlisch?]\n\nSUPERMAN -- Jerry Goldsmith.\n\nEVIDENCE: 2001 - Richard Donner interview for the Special Edition DVD release of \"Superman, The Movie\".\n\nRichard Donner revealed that Jerry Goldsmith was in line to score the movie first but due to scheduling difficulties during 1977-78 had to pass on the assignment. John Williams also nearly missed out for the same reason and the project again was offered to Goldsmith. But further scheduling prevented Goldsmith working on the film and Williams was finally able to score it.\n\nSOLAMENTO NERO -- Goblin. Supposedly a contractional dissagreement had them leave. [Stelvio Cipriano.] 1979\n\nALIEN -- Howard Blake.\n\nRidley asked Blake if he wanted to score the film, but studio heads were planning otherwise.... [Isao Tomita.]\n\nALIEN -- Isao Tomita. Ridley wanted Tomita to score the film, the studio felt completely different, suggesting Goldsmith or Williams. [Jerry Goldsmith, R.I.P.]\n\nALL THAT JAZZ -- Allan Ferguson. An old news blurb said he had been hired to score this. [Ralph Burns.]\n\nTHE BLACK STALLION -- Bill Russo. [?????.]\n\nTHE BLACK STALLION -- ?????. In an interview, Walker tells the story:\n\n\"You know, Carmine was not Carroll Ballard's choice as the composer. Carroll had hired a composer who was in academia.\n\nThe man had his own notation system. I looked at it and thought, he isn't going to put this in front of a studio orchestra in Los Angeles and have it come out the way he thinks it's going to come out. He had this whole smoke-and-mirrors number because he was having trouble interfacing with the commercial work. And, in fact, the music of his that Carroll Ballard had heard and loved, when I heard it, I realized it was stuff that a harmonica player had improvised. Maybe we shouldn't remember this guy's name. So, he was out. Who was next? Oh, God, I wish I could remember the names. I'm so sorry that I can't. There was another composer who then came into the picture.\n\nBut, ultimately, Carmine got the job. Carroll had struck out twice. Carroll arranged to have me work in the studio with Nyle Steiner, the creator of the Electronic Valve Instrument, improvising to picture under Carroll's direction. We would improvise stuff, refine it a little bit, record it to picture in Richard Beggs' studio, and then give it to Carmine to write into his film score. I was so stupid -- I didn't get it that there was absolutely no way that Carmine was going to like any of it or use any of it in what he wrote for the film score. We're talking territory here. That was sort of the beginning of a strain in my relationship with Carmine. (TS)\n\nPrincipally I was an orchestrator for Carmine. When his score was finished, Carroll Ballard then decided he was unhappy with certain elements of Carmine's score. He wanted to actually bring in another composer at that stage to do rewrites. Particularly the island portions of the film, where he was the most dissatisfied.\"\n\n[Carmine Coppola & Shirley Walker.]\n\nBREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO --&nbsp Richard Bellis Arranged songs; never did a score.&nbsp [Gereld Fried.]\n\nBUTCH & SUNDANCE: THE EARLY YEARS -- Jerry Goldsmith. Script conflicts.\n\nTHE CHAMP -- Marvin Hamlisch. Song by Hamlisch; an old news article reported he was scoring it. [Dave Grusin.]\n\nTHE CHINA SYNDROME -- Jack Nitzsche. [Then Michael Small, then nobody went in and it went scoreless.]\n\nDOCTOR DEATH: SOUL SEEKER -- William Tasker. An old news blurb mentions he was signed to do the score. [Richard LaSalle.]\n\nESCAPE TO ATHENA -- Jerry Goldsmith. Script conflicts.\n\nTHE GLOVE -- Robert O. Ragland. Soundtrackcollector lists the score as not being used, yet IMDb still lists him, and the film credits him -- did he do two different scores? Was his score replaced but he's still credited? [Robert O. Ragland.]\n\nTHE HOUSE ON GERIBALDI STREET -- ?????. Just speculation, since Bernstein said in an interview he wrote the score in six days; typically schedules like this only happen when replacing a score. [Charles Bernstein.]\n\nHURRICANE -- Bill Conti. An old news blurb mentions he was doing the score; the picture was still being filmed. [Nina Rota.]\n\nEISENHOWER (AKA: IKE: THE WAR YEARS, mini series) -- Leonard Rosenman, R.I.P.. An old issue of Bernstein's \"Film Music Notebook\" reports that this was one of hisnext assignments; the mini series was originally six hours, and cut down to four instead. One would assume that at that poin, if he did a score, it no longer fit. This would have been one of his next scores, if not the very next, after completing \"Lord of the Rings\" -- if that gives any idea of what it might have been along the lines of. [Fred Karlin.]\n\nJUST YOU AND ME, KID -- Sammy Fain. An old news blurb mentions the signing to do the score. [Jack Elliot.]\n\nTHE MAGICIAN OF LUBLIN -- Don Seltzer. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Maurice Jarre.] 1980\n\nAIRPLANE! -- Miklos Rozsa, R.I.P.. In a 1982 Soundtrack! interview, he said he was offered the film and read the script, but couldn't tell if it was a comedy or serious from reading it, and ultimately passed on it, but thought Bernstein did a good job. [Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P..]\n\nALLIGATOR -- James Horner. Supposedly Horner was originally going to score the film, but a musician's strike left him unable to do so. [Craig Huxley; and stock music from other films (including a Jerry Goldsmith cue).]\n\nCARNY -- Robbie Robertson. Only did songs and was never engadged to do the score. [Alex North.]\n\nTHE CONTENDER (mini series) -- Leonard Rosenman, R.I.P.. [James Di Pasquale.]\n\nCURLILAND (AKA: WHY WOULD I LIE?) -- Billy Goldenberg. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score.. [Charles Fox.]\n\nFLASH GORDON -- Pink Floyd. [Howard Blake.]\n\nNIGHT OF THE JUGGLER -- Jerry Goldsmith. Script conflicts. 1980\n\nAMERICAN GIGOLO -- Jean Michael Jarre. Jean told in an early July, 2013 Q&A at the International Music Summit, that he was offered the film but turned it down. [Giorgio Moroder.]\n\nHIDE IN PLAIN SIGHT -- Michael Small, R.I.P.. An old news article in April the previous year, reports Small had been signed to score the film, and a listing on SoundtrackCollector.com says he had a score that wasn't used. March 2, 2011, FSM released Rosenman's score; curious, I contacted Lukas; their search couldn't turn up Small having done one either. Whomever you are out there that added that listing to SoundtrackCollector, if you know better or even have tapes/know someone who does, for Small, please contact me (see home/index page for e-mail). [Leonard Rosenman.] 1981\n\nALL NIGHT LONG -- Dave Grusin. An old article on the film stated Grusin was doing the music, and if you've read the various films she [Streisand] did on the \"Rejected\" list, you know it's a problem if you are the first composer on any of her films... [Ira Newborn, Richard Hazzard.]\n\nBODY HEAT -- Miklos Rozsa, R.I.P.. Was offered the film, but when he read the script, he found it \"disgusting\". [John Barry.]\n\nTHE COMING (AKA: Burned at the Stake) -- Dana Kaproff. [Arthur Kempel.]\n\nTHE DEVIL AND MAX DEVLIN -- Marvin Hamlisch. An old news blurb said Hamlisch was scoring the film. [Buddy Baker.]\n\nHEARTBEEPS -- Ira Newborn. An old article on the film stated Newborn was doing the music. [John Williams.]\n\nKENT STATE (TV movie) -- Ken Lauber. Director said he ultimately dropped about 92% of the composer's score since each time it was put to it, it made the film lose the documentary feel. [Ken Lauber (leftovers).]\n\nLOOKER -- Jerry Goldsmith. Script conflicts.\n\nMOMMIE DEAREST -- Miklos Rozsa, R.I.P.. In a 1982 Soundtrack! magazine interview, he said (when being asked about films he declined): \"I didnât do the Joan Crawford picture, MOMMIE DEAREST. I knew the lady. She was a lovely woman in life. I cannot force myself to make her more vicious and horrible with my music.\". [Henry Mancini, R.I.P.]\n\nOUTLAND -- James Horner. Here is an interesting post I found. Very interesting: (I forget who made the post)\n\nIn 1986 there was an interview published in \"Start Trek: Movies Files - The Wrath of Khan\" (Ed Gross - Files magazine ? 1986 By PSI FI Movie Press, inc.), in where the writer does a Q&A with Horner about his career and his score for the Trek films. At some point Horner mentions that he had done some work on the film \"OUTLAND,\" commenting that it was his first \"A\" picture. Here is a bit of the snipped interview where Horner talks about his contribution to \"Outland\".\n\nThis part comes after having talked about his big break into film scoring with Roger Corman:\n\n\"Ed Gross - Q: \"Would you consider Corman to be your big break?\"\n\nHorner: - A: \"I look at my career in terms of milestones. At the time I'm sure I felt it was an important advance. Then I did some work for Orion pictures on OUTLAND, which was my first \"A\" picture, if you consider that an \"A\" picture. It was my first big budgeted film. From there I did several other films, and I guess that my next big milestone was STAR TREK II. Now I've gone beyond that by doing such films as GORKY PARK, The DRESSER, UNCOMMON VALOR and TESTAMENT. Thank God I did TESTAMENT.\" \"\n\nSPHINX -- Jerry Goldsmith. Script conflicts.\n\nTATTOO -- Pino Donaggio. [Barry De Vorzon.]\n\nTRUE CONFESSIONS -- Bill Conti. Supposedly the film got pushed back and Conti wasn't avaiable, scoring the Bond picture. [Georges Delerue.] 1982\n\nANNIE -- Ralph Burns. An old news blurb mentions he was signed to do the score. [Charles Strouse.]\n\nCAT PEOPLE -- Jean Michael Jarre. Jean told in an early July, 2013 Q&A at the International Music Summit, that he was offered the film but turned it down. [Giorgio Moroder.]\n\nDANCE OF THE DWARFS -- John Barry. [Perry Botkin, Jr.]\n\nDEATHWISH II -- Isaac Hayes. Page had two weeks to do his score, usually a sign a previous composer did their score... [Jimmy Page.]\n\nGANDHI -- ?????. In a bio' on Fenton for a concert performance (sometime 201o to 2015), the statement was Fenton was called in to score the film after the previous composer supposedly dropped out. [George Fenton & Ravi Shankar.]\n\nGREASE 2 -- Charles Fox. Apparently didn't see eye-to-eye with the director. [Louis St. Louis.]\n\nTHE HAND -- Tangerine Dream. In Edgar Froese's autobiography he reveals they met with the director several times in 1980 about scoring the film. [James Horner.]\n\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD -- John Cacavas. Cacavas is credited with the opening and closing score cues; perhaps that is all that is left, assuming he didn't provide themes for Markowitz. [Richard Markowitz.]\n\nTHE THING -- Jerry Goldsmith. Decided to do \"Poltergeist\" instead. [Ennio Morricone (who had most of his score dropped), then the director -- John Carpenter -- scored it.]\n\nTIR GOUPE -- Philippe Sarde. A listing on SoundtrackCollector.com says so. [Yvan Sullien, Hubert Rostaing.]\n\nYES, GIORGIO -- Jerry Goldsmith. Script conflicts.\n\nEVIDENCE FOR 4 TO 9: March 4th 1981 - Jerry Goldsmith interview on OUTLAND by Allan Bryce.\n\nAllan Bryce: \"One of the more interesting of your telefilms was PURSUIT. Do you remember that one?\"\n\nJerry Goldsmith: \"That was the first time I worked with Michael Chrichton. It wasn't called PURSUIT in the States, it was called BINARY. (In fact it was based on Chrichton's novel BINARY, written under a pseudonym). I've since done COMA and THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. I'm not doing LOOKER with him though, because I'm doing this picture now [OUTLAND], which is a direct conflict. I would be scoring LOOKER in three weeks if I had accepted it, whichis virtually impossible since I'm not done with this one yet. I will do his next film, CONGO.\" [Which Schaffner didn't film after all]\n\nAllan Bryce: \"Everyone thought you would be doing SPHINX.\"\n\nJerry Goldsmith: \"That was a conflict also, with OMEN 3 - THE FINAL CONFLICT. I'm doing Schaffner's next picture, with Pavarotti.\" [YES, GIORGIO, which he obviously didn't]\n\nAllan Bryce: \"Will that mean you?re going to be writing a lot of opera?\"\n\nJerry Goldsmith: \"No, I don't think so -- the script's at home, I haven't read it yet.\"\n\nAllan Bryce: \"Sometimes you duck out of some films for various reasons... Can I try these on you? BUTCH AND SUNDANCE: THE EARLY YEARS?\"\n\nJerry Goldsmith: \"I did MAGIC for Fox instead.\"\n\nAllan Bryce: \"NIGHT OF THE JUGGLER?\"\n\nJerry Goldsmith: \"I took that but I didn't like the script. I liked the book, but that was something different.\"\n\nAllan Bryce: \"ESCAPE TO ATHENA?\"\n\nJerry Goldsmith: \"I didn't like the script for that either.\"\n\n1983\n\nFIRE AND ICE -- John Corigliano. Supposedly he was offered the film, but turned it down to work on his opera The Ghosts of Versailles (which didn't premiere until 1991). In April, 2013, BuySoundtrax Records released Kraft's score. [William Kraft.]\n\nJAWS 3 -- John Williams. Didn't, for what ever reason.[Alan Parker.]\n\nNEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN -- ?????. In the book The Complete James Bond Movie Encyclopedia, which I do not have and am only using an excert from, the producer (Jack Schwartzman) was not happy with Legrand's score, and brought in another composer. The excerpt does not name who, but says he had wanted James Horner, but Sean Connery vetoed that idea (coincidently just two years later Horner scored a film Connery starred in). [Michel Legrand.]\n\nLAST RIVER TO CROSS/THE EIGHT (AKA: UNCOMMON VALOR) -- ?????. Milius hired a composer, Katzenberg -- angry about not being consulted -- threw Milius off the Paramount lot, and refused to let the composer do a score. Basil Poledouris was hired to score the film, and paid, but in spite of his working relationship with Milius, it doesn't necessarily mean he was the one the story refers to (if you know otherwise, please inform me). A common title requested by Horner fans for release, the master tapes are currently missing. [James Horner.]\n\nLOVESICK -- Stanley Silverman. I am told he didn't do a score. [Philippe Sarde.]\n\nPRINCESS DAISY (TV movie) -- Maurice Jarre. In a 1985 interview with Soundtrack! magazine, Jarre said he turned down the offer to score the film. [Lalo Schfrin]\n\nTHE RIGHT STUFF -- Bill Conti. I can't personally vouch for the veracity of this, but on top of having to replace Barry, Conti supposed did three complete scores for the film because the director couldn't make up his mind, and that parts of all three were used in the film, creating even more of a disjointed listen with the other music used. But since the tapes are missing and what little could be found was put on the Varese Sarabande CD Club release, we'll never really know the extent of what Conti did and how each score stood on its own. [Bill Conti.]\n\nRUMBLE FISH -- ?????. Supposedly a previous composer had either backed out or was fired. [Stewart Copeland.]\n\nSADAT (TV movie) -- Maurice Jarre. In a 1985 interview with Soundtrack! magazine, Jarre said he turned down the offer to score the film. [Charles Bernstein.]\n\nWARGAMES -- John Williams. [Marvin Hamlisch.]\n\nWARGAMES -- Marvin Hamlisch. Both composers were being considered for the score before Rubinstein, but as nothing was on the Intrada CD, my guess is neither did anything. [Arthur B. Rubinstein.]\n\nWITHOUT A TRACE -- Bill Conti. [Jack Nitzsche.] 1984\n\nBOLERO -- Alex North. Did not like violent films and when offered to score the film, turned it down. [Peter Bernstein.]\n\nDUNE -- Brian Eno. A rumor online is that Eno did a whole score which was not used, except that one cue. [Toto.]\n\nFOOTLOOSE -- Toto. Toto member Steve Lukather stated in a 1992 interview they were given the offer to score the film but turned it down. [Miles Goodman.]\n\nMICKI + MAUDE -- Michel Legrand. Supposedly became unavailable, but a song by him still appears in the film. [Lee Holdridge.]\n\nOH, GOD! YOU DEVIL -- Mike Post. A version of the film rental from Netflix (maybe the same version available everywhere else), still has Post credited; I was not able to see the film myself to find out what the credit reads. [David Shire.]\n\nOXFORD BLUES -- George Romanis. [John DuPrez.]\n\nTHE TERMINATOR -- Tony Banks. When in talks to score, Mr. Fiedel was told they had a British composer who would score the film for free; unknown to him was that Cameron had sent Banks a copy of the script, wanting him to compose, and that desperate for the work and experience, Banks was offering to take on scoring projects for free; ultimately Banks was tied up on \"2010\" (see \"DEMOS\") and had to turn down the film. [Brad \"BOOM BOOM Boom BA Boom\" Fidel - CD.]\n\nTOP SECRET -- Elmer Bernstein - For some reason, this looks like one he probably did. It just seems like something he would have been rejected from. Plus, Jarre's score sounds like a replacement anyway. [Maurice Jarre - CD.] 1985\n\nA CHRISTMAS PRESENT-- Nick Bicat. [Mark Isham.]\n\nBRAZIL -- Michael Kamen. \"...Brilliant orchestral, symphonic score...\". Supposedly a lot of his score was not used and replaced with songs to make it more \"hip\" to young people. [Michael Kamen.]\n\nFLETCH -- Charles Gross. This was nothing more than an inaccurate rumor that ended up being passed along until no one was sure. [Henry Mancini.]\n\nFLETCH -- Henry Mancini, R.I.P.. [Tom Scott.]\n\nFLETCH -- Tom Scott. Supposedly a noir styled score. [Harold Faltermeyer.]\n\nJAGGED EDGE -- Brad Fiedel. Was asked to rescore scenes in the film, but declined. [John Barry.]\n\nTHE GOONIES -- Jerry Goldsmith. Since Varese Sarabande CD Club released Grusin's complete score in 2010 (as I write this, it has not sold out yet), and there's simply no way they would pass up a Goldsmith score, it then goes without saying Jerry did not do a score for the film, but \"why\" ... is still unknown. [Dave Grusin.]\n\nLADYHAWKE -- Gerard Schurmann. Originally going to score it, but the producers changed their mind; a mistake if you ask me... [Andrew Powell.]\n\nLIFEFORCE -- James Horner. Horner was the original choice, but he ended up not being available, though Kamen stated in an interview with Soundtrack! magazine there were some problems and Horner left. Kamen also stated he was first asked to score the film but was busy scoring \"Brazil\" and had to turn it down (oddly enough at one point it was going around his \"Brazil\" score was going to be dumped and that another composer was being sought, having Kamen calling them up and asking if it was true). [Henri Mancini; Michael Kamen with James Guthrie (additional).]\n\nSWEET DREAMS -- Stanley Myers. [Charles Gross.] 1986\n\nCLUB PARADISE -- Van Dyke Parks. Mansfield co-scored with Mr. Parks. [David Mansfield.]\n\nENTERTAINING ANGLES: THE DOROTHY DAY STORY -- Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P.. Listed on imdb.com has having an \"unused score\". I spoke to the film's director, and he said that Bernstein was in fact asked to score the film, but it soon became clear that his son would be doing most of the score, and he moved on to another composer. So, I guess it should read: Peter Bernstein. [Bill Conti, Ashley Irwin (additional).]\n\nHOWARD THE DUCK -- Bruce Broughton. In a 1986 interview with Soundtrack!, Broughton said he wanted to score the film; he was being considered and had a ticket to go meet director, but then Barry was hired. Then he saw the movie and was grateful for missing out. There was also another film he wished he had scoed, but he could not remember the name of it (the interview makes rerference to another interview where Broughton does mention it, but does not say whom conducted the interview, and for what publication). The choice had come down to Barry or Poledouris. [John Barry.]\n\nNIGHT OF THE CREEPS -- Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P.. Was going to score it and use the ondes martenot, but for what ever reason he didn't score it. [Barry De Vorzon.]\n\nNOTHING IN COMMON -- Thompson Twins. In a 1985 interview the group mentions they are going to score the film; supposedly because of family problems, in the end they only did a song. [Patrick Leonard.]\n\nSALVADOR -- ?????. The composer on the film originally, quit and so Stone hired Delerue --- whom he had worked with before (which begs the question: why not hire Delerue in the first place?). [Georges Delerue, R.I.P..]\n\nTHERESE AND ISABELLE -- Georges Delerue, R.I.P.. Was hired to score the film, but some kind of personal problem arose and he had to back out. [Georges Auric.]\n\nTHE TRIAL OF THE TIME LORD (AKA: Mindwrap -- Doctor Who) -- Dick Mills. [Richard Hartley.]\n\nWHEN THE WIND BLOWS -- David Bowie. Was asked to score the film, but apparently -- from what I read -- he was in too poor of shape from a bad drug habit. [Roger Waters (of Pink Floyd).] 1987\n\nFLOWERS IN THE ATTIC -- David Shire. The director was originally going to hire him, but for what ever reason supposedly didn't. [Christopher Young.]\n\nEXTREME PREJUDICE -- RY Cooder. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nTHE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS -- John Williams? [David Foster.]\n\nQUICKSILVER -- Thomas Newman. Credited with additional music at the end of the film; no word on whether that was leftovers from a rejected score, or just supplementing. [Tony Banks; Thomas Newman (additional; leftovers?).] 1988\n\nCASUAL SEX? -- Carter Burwell. Listed on SoundtrackCollector.com as \"(score not used)\". [Van Dyke Parks.]\n\nCHILL FACTOR -- John Tatgenhorst. [John Ross.]\n\nTHE DECIEVERS -- Richard Robbins. The director wanted/possibly hired him, but there were disputes over who would do the score; ultimately I don't know if Robbins did or did not. [John Scott\n\nFRIDAY THE 13TH PART VII: THE NEW BLOOD -- Harry Manfredini. Not rejected, but unavailable. [Fred Mollin with music from Manfredini's scores to Parts 1, 2, 5, & 6]\n\nLITTLE NIKITA -- James Horner. [Marvin Hamlisch.]\n\nMYSTIC PIZZA -- Barry Coffing. [David McHugh.]\n\nNIGHTMARE AT NOON -- Author Kempel, R.I.P.. According to record producer, offender extraordinaire, Ford A. Thaxton, Kempel was the first composer and made him \"music supervisor\"; Ford retains the credit (even on IMDb), though he was not involved with the final score. And he hasn't exactly corrected it either, so... [Stanley Myres & Hans Zimmer.]\n\nPOLTERGEIST III -- Jerry Goldsmith. Before he found out the budget. [Joe Renzetti.]\n\nTUCKER: A MAN AND HIS DREAM -- John Williams. Originally doing the score. [Leonard Bernstein.]\n\nTUCKER: A MAN AND HIS DREAM -- Leonard Bernstein. Hired and were discussing it (Bernstein even brought up being careful about it, lest another \"Apocolypse Now\"), but the studio interfered; Bernstein had written one song and had flown to another country with the director to work on the music. [Joe Jackson.]\n\nSCROOGED -- John Williams. An old listing of scores recently recorded (London Symphony Orchestra; Elfman used the Hollywood Symphony Orchestra), had this among it; all the other entries were accurate; surely this can't be right... [Danny Elfman.]\n\nSHERLOCK AND ME (AKA: WITHOUT A CLUE) -- John Williams. An old listing of scores recently recorded listed this amongst the titles (London Symphony Orchestra). [Heny Mancini, R.I.P..] 1989\n\nA GRAND DAY OUT WITH WALLACE AND GROMIT -- ?????. In an interview, Nott says someone else was going to score it. [Julian Nott.]\n\nTHREE FUGITIVES -- Charles Gross. David McHugh, the final composer on the project, was replaced by Gross. Then they decided they wanted McHugh again... [RY Cooder.]\n\nTHREE FUGITIVES -- RY Cooder. Once again they replaced McHugh and asked RY Cooder, but Cooder wasn't available and turned it down. [David McHugh.]\n\nMISS FIRECRACKER -- Composer/Music Editor Joseph S. DeBeasi was Music editor on the rescore, but imdb.com lists two composers, not saying who did which. I tried DeBeasi at his website and he didn't reply. It's either Homer Denison or David Mansfield. I've had success reaching Mansfield, so I will try him again. [?????.] Bad choice of words is all; Mansfield wasn't available for some changes and Denison came in and provided a little etra help.\n\nONE FOR SORROW, TWO FOR JOY (AKA: Signs of Life) -- Richard Einhorn. In a 1989 Soundtrack! magazine interview, he says he's just been hired to score the film, and about what the score will be, he says: \"The score will be a real change of pace: all of it will be Portuguese music!\". I contacted Mr. Einhorn and he said he did not do a score in the end. [Howard Shore.]\n\nTHE RED KING, WHITE KNIGHT (TV movie) -- ?????. Speculation, as Scott said he wrote the score in ten days, a schedule that usually only happens when replacing another score. [John Scott.]\n\nTO KILL A PREIST -- Zbignew Preisner.&nbsp [Georges Delerue, R.I.P..]\n\nTURNER & HOOCH -- James Horner. [Charles Gross.]\n\nWHY ME? -- Basil Poledouris. [Phil Marshall.] 1990\n\nCHILD'S PLAY 2 -- Danny Elfman. Supposedly, he was unhappy with the finished film. Don't know how far he got, but he at least wrote a theme; Revell took the job on the condition that he could use it. Note from me, Justin: There is a boot that has Elfman's recorded theme. [Graeme Revell.]\n\nDANCES WITH WOLVES -- Peter Buffet. In his 2010 book, Buffet explains Costner asked him if he would want to score the film, but Buffet elaborates he didn't actually know how to score and didn't know any of the basics, and contacted some composers/orchestrators for a crash course, but the studio nixed him; the \"Firedance\" cue in the film, on the two Barry score CD's, is a piece writen for the film afterwards, at Costner's behest (which Barry did not want on the CD). [Basil Poledouris.]\n\nDANCES WITH WOLVES -- Basil Poledouris. Backed out to score FLIGHT OF THE INTRUDER. Ironically, Basil had been trying to get the film; schedules overlapped and Costner was okay with the overlapping schedules, but the producers on the other film were not. Of related interest: composer Stephen Graziano explained in an interview another composer had scored the trailer but they didn't like it, so he got the job; he rescored it and they didn't like it, so he went home and in an extremely short period of time, but together the music that was used in the trailer. The original trailer composer isn't known and the first piece Graziano did, has not been heard. [John Barry.]\n\nDICK TRACY -- Stephan Sondheim. Was asked to score the film on top of doing some songs, but turned down the offer to score it. [Alan Silvestri.]\n\nDICK TRACY -- Alan Silvestri. In an book where he was interviewed, it said he had already started work on the score. Silvestri also mentions not having a score rejected up to that point, so if he recorded for this -- it would be his first rejected score. [Danny Elfman.]\n\nEDWARD SCISSORHANDS -- Robert Smith (The Cure). Originally asked to score the film, and sent him a copy of the script, but Smith hadn't heard of Burton and turned it down.&nbsp [Danny Elfman.]\n\nEXORCIST III -- Christopher Young. The film was re-cut heavily and DeVorzon's score was going to be replaced, for a good while, but the budget did not allow for it, and Young backed out (after writing an unknown amount of score). [Barry DeVorzon.]\n\nHOME ALONE -- Bruce Broughton. Supposedly a scheduling conflict with \"Rescurers Down Under\" that ran a month over and Broughton turned it down. [Jonathan Sheffer.]\n\nHOME ALONE -- Jonathan Sheffer. After Broughton, Sheffer was picked, but when Williams expressed interest... [John Williams.]\n\nLES ENFANTS DU PARADIS (AKA: Lacenaire) -- Georges Delerue, R.I.P.. In an Soundtrack! magazine interview, Delerue says he might score the film. [Laurent Petitgirard.]\n\nLIONHEART -- ?????. Another speculation on my part because someone said Scott did the score is less than two weeks. [John Scott.]\n\nMOON 44 -- Christopher Young. Turned it down for unknown reasons. [Another composer, then Joel Goldsmith.]\n\nTHE RUSSIA HOUSE -- Michael Kamen. The director wanted Kamen, since Sean Connery was playing a sax in the film and Kamen and Sanborn had just done an album like that. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nTIE ME UP! TIE ME DOWN! -- Miles Davis. The director states in an interview he wanted Davis (doesn't state if that happened), and only hired Morricone because he was available, and also says all Morricone did was rip his theme off from \"Frantic\", and mentiones he only used half of Morricone's score. [Ennio Morricone.]\n\nTOTAL RECALL -- Basil Poledouris. Basil once said:\n\n\"BP: When Paul asked me to score Total Recall I had already The Hunt For Red October. It nearly killed me but I had to refuse the assignment, as I don't score two films at once feeling it to be a great disservice to both pictures. His choice of Jerry was perfect and Jerry has provided him with wonderful soundtracks. Paul is loyal but is willing to cast composers like he would any other of his films. He once told me that he utilized Jerry for a more intellectual approach and me for a more emotional approach. It made perfect sense at the time and still does.\"\n\nBut the problem with this being that these films were seperated by two or three years, and Basil was on TR for at least six months. Conflicting. [Jerry Goldsmith.] 1991\n\nBACKDRAFT -- James Horner. Wanted Horner, but a scheduling conflict made him unavailable; Zimmer says it was always himself onboard. [Hanzi Zimmer.]\n\nHOLLISTER (AKA: BROTHERHOOD OF THE GUN) -- ?????. In an old interview with the late Joel Goldsmith, Joel stated he was the replacement composer on the project (and didn't name the previous composer). [Joel Goldsmith; Jerry Goldsmith (theme).]\n\nFATHER OF THE BRIDE -- ?????. Just speculation, but in a November, 2016 video interview with Film Music Media, Silvestri was asked about his fatested score and this was the first one named, with little time to score; no specific word is given that he was taking over for somebody else. [Alan Silvestri; Steve Tyrell (additional).]\n\nHIGHLANDER II: THE QUICKENING -- Ennio Morricone. In a 1990 Soundtrack! magazine assignments listing, this is listed; all other assignemtns listed were accurate except one film which never got made (sorry, Elfman). [Stewart Copeland and George S. Clinton.]\n\nLIVIN' LARGE! -- Kurt Farquhar. An old article says he had scored it. [Herbie Hancock.]\n\nRETURN TO BLUE LAGOON -- Gary Chang. [Basil Poledouris.]\n\nSUPER MARIO BROS. -- Jerry Goldsmith. Back when the film was being directed by Greg Beeman, Goldsmith had been signed on to score it. The film came out in 1993, and was directed by somebody else. [Alan Silvestri.]\n\nTRUE COLORS -- Georges Delerue, R.I.P.. In an Soundtrack! magazine interview, Delerue says he would be scoring the film. [Trevor Jones.] 1992\n\nTHE BODYGUARD -- John Barry. FSM had a poll once on which Barry scores should be released and Barry's Bodyguard got: 202 votes (4.4%). La La Land Records released Silvestri's score in late 2012; eventually at the Film Score Monthly forum they said Barry did not record anything. [Alan Silvestri; Allen Dennis Rich (additional).]\n\nCITY OF JOY -- Richard Blackford.&nbsp Provided additional scoring, not for Morricone, but was never the full comopser for the film. [Ennio Morricone.]\n\nTHE DEAD LIQUER -- Stamatis Spaanoudakis. [Nikos Kypourgos.]\n\n1492 -- John Barry. Barry was called and asked if he would score the film, and that was that -- he never heard back. [Hans Zimmer.]\n\n1492 -- Hans Zimmer. Said in an interview he was signed to score it. [Vangelis.]\n\nINDIANA JED (fan film) -- David Wurst. IMDb had listed Michael & Marc Linn as doing a \"new score\", but this was just poorly selected wording; despite the film listing Wurst as the composer, library music by him was used in the film (no original score) and the Linn's did original additional material. The Linn's were also acted, directed, wrote, and produced on their fan film. [David Wurst (library music); Michael & Marc Linn (additional original material).]\n\nIMAN TROUBLE -- Jean-Claude Petit.I Delerue stated in an interview Petit didn't accept the offer to score the film. [Georges Delerue.]\n\nMIDDLE AGES (mini series) -- James Newton Howard and/or Jack Nitzsche? [James Newton Howard and/or Jack Nitzsche?]\n\nNEWSIES -- Alan Menken & Jack Feldman. Confused listing with the stage musical? [J.A.C. Redford.]\n\nSCENT OF A WOMAN -- Danny Elfman. Appearently the recent Elfman Box states in the linear notes that Elfman was going to do the film, but turned it down, and suggested a composer he was a fan of, Thomas Newman. [Thomas Newman.]\n\nTRESPASS -- James Horner. [John Zorn (rejected), then RY Cooder.] 1993\n\nA BRONX TALE -- Bobby Watson. As reported by FSM. [Butch Barbella.]\n\nBENNY AND JOON -- ?????. Someone posted at a board mentioning that the Special Edition LaserDisc had as an option, an alternate score that was rejected. I do not know who, but imdb.com lists Charlie Reid. I have no confirmation. [Rachel Portman.]\n\nThe LaserDisc features an option to see a different version of the film, or something like that and the beginning of the film uses Portman's un-used score piece, which was replaced by the song \"500 Miles\". They say it's a wonderful cue too. Maybe more.\n\nFALLING DOWN -- Graeme Revell. I went ahead and checked his IMDb.com listing and 1993 films. He did seven. I can only now assume it was a scheduling conflict. Unless he was just that good. [James Newton Howard; Marc Bonilla (additional).]\n\nHOCUS POCUS -- . James Horner. \"Sara's Theme\" is credited to Horner, who was the original composer (no idea if he went any further); when he couldn't do the score, he initially suggested somebody else. [Rachel Portman.]\n\nHOCUS POCUS -- Rachel Portman. Eventually Portman turned the film down, unable to figure out how to meet the scoring needs. Again, Horner suggested another composer: Debney.. [John Debney.]\n\nTHE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS -- Giorgio Mororder. I need another person to verify this is even real. [Danny Elfman.]\n\nPOSSE -- ?????. Colombier states in an FSM interview they originally wanted \"a black composer\" (saying the same thing about \"New Jack City\"; see: REJECTED) but does not state who. Speculation, but Stanley Clarke scored his next film -- possibly he was the first composer on this film. [Michael Colombier.]\n\nROMEO IS BLEEDING -- In an interview, Michael Kamen said he didn't. [Mark Isham.]\n\nSLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE -- John Barry. Offered the movie, read the script, was going to do, but according to himself in an FSM interview, found out there was a music supervisor attached; inquired about the song use, found out there was 20 pages of songs to be used, dropped out. [Marc Shaiman.]\n\nSWING KIDS -- Jerry Goldsmith, R.I.P.. Supposedly a scheduling conflict. [Georges Delerue, R.I.P..]\n\nSWING KIDS -- Georges Delerue, R.I.P.. Started writing the score, but passed away. [James Horner.]\n\nTOMBSTONE -- Jerry Goldsmith, R.I.P.. Supposedly a scheduling conflict. [Basil Poledouris.]\n\nTOMBSTONE -- Basil Poledouris, R.I.P.. Basil was asked to score it and wanted two-and-a-half weeks to do it, so they sought another composer; ironically, Broughton was allowed the same amount of time to do his score. [Bruce Broughton.]\n\nTHE VANISHING -- Carly Simon. Simon was asked, but he had no interest in scoring movies at that time, again. [Jerry Goldsmith.] 1994\n\nA LOW DOWN DIRTY SHAME -- Bill Conti. [Marcus Miller.]\n\nANGIE -- Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P.. In a 1993 interview, Bernstein said this was his next film, working again with the director. Appearently Bernstein was assuming he would, as I am told he was never going to score this film, and Goldsmith was the only choice. [Jerry Goldsmith, R.I.P..]\n\nCOPS AND ROBBERSONS -- Bill Conti. [Alan Silvestri.]\n\nCOPS AND ROBBERSONS -- Alan Silvestri. Was hired to score the film. [William Ross.]\n\nTHE CLIENT -- Hans Zimmer. Someone asked me if it was true if Zimmer had rejected stuff and was replaced by Shore. Don't know. And now someone else has asked that. [Howard Shore]\n\nCLIFFORD -- Howard Shore. Was never on the film; old magazine listing was incorrect. [Richard Gibbs.]\n\nTHE CRUSADES (TV movie) -- Jerry Goldsmith. An old upcoming scores list had this on his credits. [Jose Nieto.]\n\nED WOOD -- Henry Mancini. [Howard Shore.]\n\nFOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL -- Trevor Jones. In an interview with Soundtrack! magazine in 1999, Jones stated he had been approached to score the film but he was too busy scoring \"The Name of the Father\". [Richard Rodney Bennett.]\n\nTHE JUNGLE BOOK -- Jerry Goldsmith. The film was delayed and Jerry moved on, ironically, to Judge Dredd, after Dredd went through two composers. When they asked him again, he was fresh off a rushed three and-a-half weeks of rescoring \"The River Wild\" and only had a few weeks to do it and turned it down. [Bruce Broughton.]\n\nTHE JUNGLE BOOK -- Bruce Broughton. According to a magazine article (which I'll have later), he was working on the score. Hopefully the article will clear up whether he recorded it. [Basil Poledouris.]\n\nM.A.N.T.I.S.: \"Pilot\" -- Terence Blanchard. Blanchard was originally announced as the composer for the pilot, even joking in an interview he had no idea who the director was, but he was flying out to score it. [Joseph LoDuca.]\n\nM.A.N.T.I.S.: \"(unknown episode; possibly the Pilot)\" -- Shirley Walker, R.I.P.. Walker's website used to list this was being a score that wasn't used; it has been since amended and just shows the credit only. She is not credited with any episode score. [Since I don't know which episode, I can't name the replacement composer; series composers: HERE.]\n\nMILK MONEY -- Richard Robbins. Supposedly, during the first meeting to score the film, the composer and executives disagreed so much that Robbins left the film, thus never writing the score. [Michael Convertino.]\n\nMY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING -- Alan Silvestri. Was attached (don't know if officially) for at least four months. [James Newton Howard.]\n\nNATURAL BORN KILLERS -- Spiritualized. At one point, as one of the film's producers says in an interview, the UK synth music group was signed to score the film but a conflict in their schedule prevented them from doing so. [Brent Lewis; tomandandy (additional).]\n\nPONTIAC MOON -- In an interview, Michael Kamen said he didn't. [Randy Edleman.]\n\nREADY-TO-WEAR -- Thomas Newman. [Michael Legrand.]\n\nSPEED -- Michael Kamen, R.I.P.. The studio was trying to hire Kamen, after Mancina was hired; no idea if they succeeded. [Jerry Goldsmith (rejected), then Mark Mancina.]\n\nSUGAR HILL -- Jack Nitzche, R.I.P.. [Terrance Blanchard.]\n\nTHE OUTLAWS: LEGEND OF O.B. TAGGART -- Larry Gatlin. Gatlin and the other guy did songs; no rejected score. [David Mansfield.]\n\nTHE QUICK AND THE DEAD -- Trevor Jones. Was fired; don't know if he recorded anything (though Lukas Kendall said once that Jones didn't write a note). [Alan Silvestri.]\n\nTHE RIVER WILD -- Trevor Jones. In an interview, Jarre states Jones was on the project, but didn't record anything. [Maurice Jarre. Rejected. Then Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nWOLF -- John Williams. As reported by FSM. [Ennio Morricone.] 1995\n\nBABY'S DAY OUT -- Jerry Goldsmith, R.I.P.. As reported by FSM. [Bruce Broughton.]\n\nCASINO -- Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P.. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [No original score.]\n\nCONGO -- James Newton Howard. Was hired to do the score, but supposedly had to back out over a conflict with another score. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nCOPYCAT -- James Newton Howard. As the director puts it: \"Several weeks into the process, he unceremoniously dumped our movie because he had been offered a large sum of money to do the score for Waterworld.\". [Christopher Young.]\n\nFIRST KNIGHT -- Maurice Jarre. Jarre said in an FSM interview the original cut of the film was three hours; Jerry Zucker asked him to score it, but he declined saying he could not write 90 minutes of music in six weeks and that he did not use \"outside orchestrators to help me write scores\". [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nFREE WILLY 2 -- Nathan Wang. [Basil Poledouris.]\n\nGOLDENEYE -- Elliot Goldenthal. This was a false rumor and Goldenthal was never involved. [Robert Folk.]\n\nGOLDENEYE -- Robert Folk. [Eric Serra; John Altman (one rescored scene, refered to as the \"tank scene\").]\n\nTHE GRASS HARP -- John Barry. Studio interference; the studio didn't think Barry was right for the job and never hired him. [Elmer Berstein.]\n\nTHE GRASS HARP -- Elmer Bernstein, R.I.P.. Just heresay, as Bernstein was never onboard. [Patrick Williams.]\n\nTHE JOURNEY OF THE AUGUST KING -- Carter Burwell. [Stephen Endelman.]\n\nLORD OF ILLUSIONS -- Christopher Young. \"creative differences\" [Simon Boswell.]\n\nMONEY TRAIN -- Brad Fiedel. FSM reported in an old issue the same story they did with \"Sgt. Bilko\": the previous composer wasn't avaiable because of a scheduling conflict, and Fiedel was taking over; while Mr. Fiedel had worked for the director before, this news from FSM was false and he was never onboard or in talks. [Mark Mancina.]\n\nOPERATION DUMBO DROP -- Basil Poledouris. Poledouris said in an FSM interview that this was his next film after \"Free Willy 2\" and \"Under Seige 2\". [David Newman.]\n\nPOWDER -- Bennett Salvay. Upon asking the director, Jerry was the first choice. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nSHOWGIRLS -- Jerry Goldsmith. [David A. Stewart & Rena Riffel.]\n\nTHE SCARLET LETTER -- Ennio Morricone. [Elmer Bernstein (rejected), then John Barry.]\n\nSOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT -- Randy Newman. [Hans Zimmer, Graham Preskett.]\n\nTWELVE MONKEYS -- Michael Kamen. Kamen stated in a mega interview with FSM that there was some talk with the director about it, but that the director was waiting to see the movie first and wanted a more classical approach, so this is unsolved because at the time no decision was made yet. [George Fenton.]\n\nTWELVE MONKEYS -- George Fenton. As reported in an old listing in the FSM magazine. [Paul Buckmaster.]\n\nTHE USUAL SUSPECTS -- ?????. Originally another un-named composer was onboard, and Ottman had three weeks to do his score. [John Ottman.]\n\nVENDETTA -- Ennio Morricone. Shaw said once his first job scoring in Sweden, was replacing Morricone on the film. [Francis Shaw.]\n\nTHE VIKING SAGAS -- George Fenton. [George S. Clinton.]\n\nWAITING TO EXHALE -- Quincy Jones. [Kenneth Edmonds.] 1996\n\nA TIME TO KILL -- Jesse Johnson. Singer/songwriter Johnson has occassionally broken into film scoring. [Elliot Goldenthal.]\n\nCHAIN REACTION -- James Newton Howard Supposedly left because of a scheduling conflict. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nTHE CRAFT -- Thomas Newman [Graeme Revell.]\n\nDRAGONHEART -- Jerry Goldsmith. See post HERE. [Randy Edelman.]\n\nESCAPE FROM LA -- ?????. In a Soundtrack.net interview, John Carpenter says there wasn't much time to do the score; I believe I read somewhere else he said it was like three days; the time frame leads me to believe he replaced a score, but that is not confirmation (so this entry is speculatory). [John Carpenter & Shirley Walker, R.I.P. - CD.]\n\nEXECUTIVE DECISION -- Basil Poledouris, R.I.P.. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nFAITHFUL -- David Newman. As reported by FSM. [Phillip Johnston.]\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS -- David Newman. BMI or ASCAP lists cues for Newman, but I am unaware of any stock music in the film being by him. [James Newton Howard.]\n\nTHE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS -- James Newton Howard According to Alex Kitman Ho, Howard never got to do the score because there was a conflict with his agency and the money. Kitman wanted Howard and not Goldsmith.. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nHOMEWARD BOUND 2 -- Joel McNeely (FSM reported this). Broughton, I am told, was on the film from the get-go, and that McNeely was never involved, but this was a mistake on the part of the person I spoke with, because McNeely was onboard before that person, and was going to score it but didn't in the end, being attached only briefly. [Bruce Broughton.]\n\nMARS ATTACKS! -- Howard Shore. Did not record a score. [Danny Elfman.]\n\nMISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 1 -- Ryuichi Sakamoto. Was aksed to score the film (later doing \"Snake Eyes\" for the director), but was busy; the director asked him to drop whatever he was doing and score the film anyway, but Sakamoto declined. [Alan Silvestri (rejected), then Danny Elfman.]\n\nMOJAVE MOON -- Scott Grusin. [Johnny Caruseo; Craig Stuart Garfinkle (additional).]\n\nNICKLE AND DIME (AKA: LARGER THAN LIFE) -- Mark Isham (FSM reported this). [Miles Goodman, R.I.P..]\n\nTHE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU -- Wojciech Kilar. [Then Zbigniew Preisner (who did), then Gary Chang.]\n\nLA CELESTINA -- Ennio Morricone. [Patrick Doyle.]\n\nLA CELESTINA -- Patrick Doyle. [Alejandro Masso.]\n\nLOCH NESS -- Rachel Portman. As reported by FSM. Supposedly production took longer than needed and when it was tiem for Portman to do her score, she wasn't available (isn't that what a contract is for?); I don't rule out that she may have done demos though. [Trevor Jones.]\n\nMARIETTE IN ECSTASY -- George Fenton. Fenton was the initial choice of composer and was going to do the score, but production went on far longer than expected and when it was time for the score, Fenton was not available. [Leonard Rosenman, R.I.P..]\n\nTHE PROTRAIT OF THE LADY -- Michael Nyman. [Woljciech Kilar.]\n\nPRIMAL FEAR -- Thomas Newman. [James Newton Howard, J. Peter Robinson (additional).]\n\nTHE QUEST -- Woljciech Kilar. [Randy Edleman.]\n\nTHE ROCK -- ?????. An old interview I read said the original composer wasn't working out, though it it may turn out that was refering to Nick, as he was originally going to score the film himself. [Nick Glennie-Smith, Hans Zimmer; Harry Gregson-Williams (aditional); Steven M. Stern, Don Harper (additional co-composing).]\n\nTRIGGER EFFECT -- Jerry Goldsmith. There was supposedly a bootleg for download from illegal file sharing programs, but someone downloaded it and informned me it's nothing more than his \"2 Days In the Valley\". [James Newton Howard.]\n\nWHITE SQUALL -- James Horner. [Vangelis.]\n\nWHITE SQUALL -- Vangelis. Did not according to Ridley Scott. [Jeff Rona.] 1997\n\nA FURTHER GESTURE -- Three composers are associated with the film and I don't know who the final composer was: Shaun Davey / Harald Kloser / John M. Keane (not the same Keane from CSI). [?????.]\n\nA SIMPLE WISH -- John Barry. [Bruce Broughton.]\n\nCATS DON\"T DANCE -- Randy Newman. Was doing the songs and score, but only the songs were still in the film; don't know if he did the score. (FSM reported this). [Steve Goldstein; Randy Newman (songs).]\n\nCOMMANDMENTS (TV mini series) -- Danny Elfman. [Joseph Vitarelli.]\n\nCOP LAND -- Terrence Blanchard. Blanchard stated in an interview he was asked to do the score, and met with the director and saw the film; he then said he went on to describe how he saw the film, being in four different parts, and how the scoring should go, and that the director had this blank look on his face. The director admitted later, he was surprised Blanchard \"Got it\", and was surprised by the comments, so this begs the question: why did Shore score the film, and not Blanchard? [Howard Shore.]\n\nTHE 18th ANGEL -- Simon Boswell. MovieMusicUk interview where Boswell taks a bit about it what happened. In an interview I did with him (see Interviews page), he said it was not recorded. [Starr Parodi & Jeff Edan Fair - a promo of score exists.]\n\nHOME BEFORE DARK -- Mason Daring. Mason was too busy and recommended Cowen. [Jeanine Cowen.]\n\nHOPE -- Dave Grusin. [Steve Porcaro.]\n\nLA CONFIDENTIAL -- Elmer Bernstein. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nLIAR, LIAR -- James Newton Howard. Was originally going to score it himself, but due to a scheduling conflict, had to bow out, but he provided theme(s) and, as I recall, suggested Debney as replacement. He may have also recorded a few cues with the theme.(s). [John Debney, James Newton Howard (themes).]\n\nMETRO -- James Newton Howard. Porcaro, a friend of Howard's, ended up getting recommended for the film. [Steve Porcaro.]\n\nMURDER AT 1600 -- Basil Poledouris, R.I.P.. [Christopher Young.]\n\nTHE SAINT -- Maurice Jarre. Contacted the director, Phillip Noce, and he said Jarre was never involved.. [Graeme Revell.]\n\nSTARSHIP TROOPERS -- Jerry Goldsmith. The administrator at JerryGoldsmithOnline.com told this story -- take it for what it's worth: \"I heard from a v good source that Goldsmith's services were requested for Starship Troopers but for some odd reason his Agency declined the offer without JG knowing. Apparently when JG found out he was furious and was going to leave. But they got JG Air Force One to make up for it.\" [Basil Poledouris.]\n\nTHAT OLD FEELING -- Marc Shaiman. An old news blurb mentioned he was doing the score. [Patrick Williams.]\n\nVOLCANO -- Gary Chang For a score supposedly (at least according to one website) wasn't done, people have been rather tight-lipped about talking about it. [Alan Silvestri.]\n\nTHE WRONG GUY -- Steven Page (of The Bare Naked Ladies). Apparently Dave Foley was talking to them about it, but the studio wanted a name composer. The BNL did a song for the film, though. [Lawrence Shragge.] 1998\n\nA BUG'S LIFE -- Bruce Broughton. [Randy Newman.]\n\nA CIVIL ACTION -- Ennio Morricone. Did something, but I don't know what. [Danny Elfman.]\n\nBLACK CAT RUN (TV movie) -- Hummie Mann. Was set to score it, as FSM also listed. [Jeff Rona.]\n\nCAN'T HARDLY WAIT -- IMDb lists both David Kitay and Matthew Sweet -- both recorded scores. Film came on TV, both composers are credited together. [David Kitay & Matthew Sweet.]\n\nEATING L.A. -- Brice Martin. [Rick Butler, Randall Derchan, & Matthew Solomon.]\n\nDANCING AT LUGHNASA -- Zbigniew Preisner. [Bill Whelan.]\n\nDEAD MAN ON CAMPUS -- Dust Bros.. Was set to score it, as FSM also listed. [Mark Mothersbaugh.]\n\nDEEP IMPACT -- Hanzi Zimmer. Turned it down, after being offered two similar films during that time. [James Horner.]\n\nDESPERATE MEASURES -- Wojciech Kilar. In a lengthy interview, no longer dated but going back at least to 2007, Kilar says he turned the offer down to score the film because it was not his type of film and he did not feel the genre. [Trevor Jones.]\n\nENEMY OF THE STATE -- Hans Zimmer. In a 1998 interview with Soundtrack!, Rabin stated another composer had been hired but fell through; I thought he surely would not be refering to Harry or Hans that way, but it turned out Zimmer was indeed that composer, dropping out because he was tied up heavily in \"The Thin Red Line\". [Harry Gregson-Williams, Trevor Rabin, Tim Heintz (additional), Paul Linford (additional).]\n\nHEART OF THE STORM -- Larry Groupe. Pushed back to 2004. [Richard Bellis.]\n\nTHE KISS (AKA: LIVING OUT LOUD) -- Mervyn Warren. The old Film Score Monthly listing with Mr. Warren as composer, was inaccurate; he worked on songs on the film only. [George Fenton.]\n\nMULAN -- Rachel Portman. FSM reported this as far back as January 1996. Portman claims she didn't have time, with the birth of her child, but she was also doing \"Dangerous Beauty\", and she recorded score for that. In a March 9, 2018 audio interview on the BBC website (conducted by Donald Macleod), Portman said he due date was abut the time of the recording sessions and Disney didn't feel comportable with it and decided not to have her score the film; but they did come back and give her a large sum of money anyway. [Jerry Goldsmith.]\n\nONE HELL OF A GUY (TV Movie) -- Russ Landau. [Michael Whalen.]\n\nORGAZMO -- The Dust Bros. [Paul Robb.]\n\nRONIN -- Jerry Goldsmith, R.I.P.. Faced with a film full of car chases, Goldsmith didn't know what to do for it, so turned it down. [Elia Cmiral.]\n\nTHE TRUMAN SHOW -- Philip Glass. Received and \"additional\" credit, but is said to have recorded a full score. Kilar was also on the project at some point. [Burkhard Van Dallwitz]\n\nQUEST FOR CAMELOT -- David Newman While FSM listed it for Newman, the director said Newman wasn't onboard. I am told in an old issue of FSM, it's mentioned that Doyle -- still in the hospital from Lukemia, did the score from his hospital bed. [Patrick Doyle.]\n\nSHAKING ALL OVER -- David May. Was set to score it, as FSM also listed. [Larry Groupe.]\n\nTHE SIEGE -- James Horner. [Graeme Revell.]\n\nTHE UNKNOWN CYCLIST -- Hummie Mann. Was set to score it, as FSM also listed. [Donald Markowitz; David Vanacore (additional); Sydney Forest (songs).]\n\nTHE VELOCITY OF GARY -- Harry Gregson-Williams. Decided to help score \"Ants\" instead. [Peitor Angell.] 1999\n\nABILENE (AKA: SHADOWS OF THE PAST) -- John Hills. As reported by FSM. [Charles Engstrom.]\n\nANALYZE THIS -- Trevor Jones. IMDb used to report it. [Howard Shore.]\n\nANIMAL FARM -- Trevor Jones. Vol. 4, No. 3 of FSM lists this in the \"Upcoming Assignments\" section. [Richard Harvey.]\n\nTHE BEST MAN -- Terence Blanchard. [Stanley Clarke.]\n\nBICENTENNIAL MAN -- John Williams. Left the project to score THE PHANTOM MENACE. Now, though not clear, I have heard Williams actually started recording some before he parted ways. [James Horner.]\n\nTHE BIG KAHUNA -- John Barry. [Christopher Young.]\n\nBUDDY BOY -- Michael Brook. FSM reported him as the composer. IMDb shows him, Brian Eno, and Revell. I have no idea what kind of mess was created here. [Graeme Revell.]\n\n8MM -- Elliot Goldenthal. [Danna.]\n\nEND OF DAYS -- Mark Isham Wanted Isham, but he was scoring another film. [John Debney.]\n\nFANTASIA 2000 -- Bruce Broughton [Classical music and one original piece.]\n\nFIGHT CLUB -- Howard Shore. [Dust Brothers.]\n\nHOOF BEETS (Later RUNNING FREE) -- Danny Elfman. FSM reported it, and SoundtrackCollector.com has him as a rejected score. [Nicola Piovani.]\n\nTHE IRON GIANT -- Danny Elfman. In a 1995 Film Score Monthly interview, this exchange was given between the interviewer and Kamen:\n\nI was recently asked to rescore a film that Danny Elfman was working on. They were making deals already for me to come: \"Be there and see it and set up times.\" And I said, \"Has anybody told Danny Elfman yet?\" They said, \"Oh, no...!\"\n\nI have found no further evidence on what Elfman did or did not do. [Michael Kamen.]\n\nTHE IRON GIANT -- John Williams. Both were being considered. [Michael Kamen.]\n\nTHE IRON GIANT -- Nicholas Pike. There is a promo CD with two demo cues for it [4:43]. [Michael Kamen.]\n\nJAKOB THE LIAR -- Zbigniew Preisner. Never saw the film, never heard either score, but you can bet there would have been lots of pauses in Preisner's. [Edward Shearmur.]\n\nJESUS: THE EPIC MINI SERIES -- Ennio Morricone. In an old interview they asked Williams about Morricone being before him, and he didn't know about it; Morricone had worked with the director before. I seem to recall some listings saying Morricone provided the theme (maybe the only retained piece?). [Patrick Williams.]\n\nKIMBERLY -- Larry Groupe. Vol. 4, No. 3 of FSM lists this in the \"Upcoming Assignments\" section. [Basil Poledouris with additional music by Eric Colvin.]\n\nLIGHT IT UP -- Quincy Jones III (son). FSM listed this in the \"Upcoming Assignments\" section. [Harry Gregson-Williams, John E. Rhone(?).]\n\nLOVE STINKS -- Ira Newborn. Vol. 4, No. 3 of FSM listed this in the \"Upcoming Assignments\" section, but in the end Newborn did not do any score. [Bennett Salvay.]\n\nMAN ON THE MOON -- Thomas Newman. According to CineMusic.net, September 17. [Norman Henry Mamey, Mike Mills, Michael Stipe (R.E.M.).]\n\nMICKEY BlUE EYES -- Joseph Vitarelli. MMUK had reported back then: \"Before either Basil Poledouris & Wolfgang Hammerschmid came together to write the music for Hugh Grant's gangster comedy, young New Yorker Joe Vitarelli was attached to this project -- something of a departure for a composer with a track record that includes thrillers such as The Last Seduction. No one really knows how much music Vitarelli wrote before he was dumped, but it couldn't have been much worse than the banal Nino Rota pastiches the film was ultimately saddled with.\"; Vitarelli did in fact write score, but it ended up not making it to the recording stage as the film sufferend problems with folks in charge butting heads. [Two other composers -- both of which rejected (See \"Rejected\" page), then finally Basil Poledouris.]\n\nA MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM -- Ennio Morricone. [Wojciech Kilar (see \"DEMOS\" on the main lists page); Simon Boswell.]\n\nMAGNOLIA -- Aimee Mann. Was set to score it, as FSM also listed. [Jon Brion.]\n\nMY FAVORITE MARTIAN -- Joel McNeely. There is a demo CD-R, but it's unclear as to whether this is a compilation for submission, or an actual rejected score. [John Debney.]\n\nMY FRIEND PAUL -- Tom Waits. The director said Waits did the score, in an old bio about the film before it opened. [Robert Musso.]\n\nMUPPETS IN SPACE -- Richard Gibbs. Vol. 4, No. 3 of FSM lists this in the \"Upcoming Assignments\" section. Was never on the film; old magazine listing was incorrect. [Jamshied Sharifi with additional music by Rupert Gregson-Williams.]\n\nONEGIN -- Zbiganew Preisner. According to somebody who worked on the film, the choice of composer had come down to him, Anne Dudley, and the used composer; the director said she consulted an \"oracle\" on the composer, and Presiner was the winner. The \"oracle\" later turned out to be her dead mother. No word on whether Preisner did anything... [Magnis Fiennes.]\n\nPLUNKETT & MACLEANE -- Trevor Jones. [Craig Armstrong.]\n\nTEACHING MRS. TINGLE -- Christopher Young. Vol. 4, No. 3 of FSM lists this in the \"Upcoming Assignments\" section. Not sure how far he got, but somebody on eBay claimed to have a bootleg of Young's rejected score. [John Frizzell.]\n\nTOM'S MIDNIGHT GARDEN -- John Barry, R.I.P.. An informal conversation with the director, but was never hired. [Debbie Wiseman.]\n\nTHE 13th WARRIOR -- Lisa Gerrard. Did vocals for Revell's score, but didn't do her own -- at least, that's what I am told. [Graeme Revell (rejected); Jerry Goldsmith]\n\nTHE WHITE RIVER KID -- Camaran Kambon. As reported by FSM. [John Frizzell.] 2000\n\nA TASTE OF SUNSHINE -- Hans Zimmer. Jarre was the initial composer, then Zimmer took over, then they went back with Jarre. [Maurice Jarre.]\n\nTHE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE -- Michael Kamen. As someone said in a moviemusic.com post, Kamen confirmed he was still scoring the movie, but that doesn't necessarily mean he recorded anything, though if you look at all the orchestrators Mark used (Not all of which are credited on imdb.com), I think that says something about how many people ghostwrote... [Mark Mothersbaugh.]\n\nAFFECTION -- Graeme Revell. This was in an old listing of upcoming assignments, but no director was listed and I can't find whether he was replaced (since there's no film by this name in 2000, 2001, and 2002 [except a short]) or if it was something that changed names and he still ended up doing. [.]\n\nAMERICAN PSYCHO -- Danny Elfman. Was on the proje"
