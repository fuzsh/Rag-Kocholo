        "text": "Written by Tony-nominated composer/lyricist, Andrew Lippa (The Wild Party), and Brian Crawley (Violet), A Little Princess is based on the novel by Frances Hodgson Burnett, which was honored by School Library Journal as one of the \"Top 100 Chapter Books\" of all time. This re-imagined version of the classic tale expands beyond the confines of Victorian England to Africa, giving the writers ample opportunity to include lively African music and dance, exotic locales like Mali and Timbuktu and creating an unforgettable journey around the world.\n\nSeparated from her father and the openhearted Africans who have helped him raise her, young Sara Crewe is sent to boarding school in London. When things go badly for her there, her imaginative powers come to the rescue â€“ helping to transform a drab institution into a place of magic and mystery. As the girl wins the affection of the other boarders, she draws the ire of Miss Minchin, the dour headmistress, who forces Sara to work as a maid when her father is reported dead, and his fortune is seized. Sara counters all of Miss Minchin's best efforts to degrade her, all the while maintaining the grace and virtue of a little princess.\n\nA Little Princess is a big show that calls for many younger female actresses, making it perfect for educational institutions. Because of its strong curriculum tie-ins, A Little Princess provides a wonderful opportunity for theatre companies to team up with schools in their area for workshops, talkbacks and more."
