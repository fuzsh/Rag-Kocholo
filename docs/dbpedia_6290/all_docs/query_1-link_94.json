        "text": "MMMbopHanson\n\nThe chipper-sounding \"MMMbop\" by Hanson has a heavy lyrical theme, asking us to look at the big picture and value what is lasting in life: our support systems.\n\nGodTori Amos\n\nIn the song \"God,\" Tori Amos makes the point that if there's God, there must also be a Goddess because there are no male-only species.\n\nHell's BellsAC/DC\n\nA one-ton bell was custom made for AC/DC's \"Hell's Bells.\" The recording was slowed to half speed to make it sound like a more ominous two-ton bell.\n\nSundownGordon Lightfoot\n\nThe inspiration for Gordon Lightfoot's \"Sundown\" came from the songwriter worrying about his girlfriend, who was out at bars all day while he was at home penning songs.\n\nTainted LoveSoft Cell\n\n\"Tainted Love\" started as a 1964 soul song by Gloria Jones, became a huge hit when Soft Cell covered it in 1981, and was the basis for Rihanna's 2006 #1 \"S.O.S. (Rescue Me).\"\n\nJust The Way You AreBruno Mars\n\nBruno Mars' \"Just The Way You Are\" was originally written with Cee-Lo Green in mind, but the Gnarls Barkley singer didn't feel it was right for him.\n\nChristopher CrossSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe man who created Yacht Rock with \"Sailing\" wrote one of his biggest hits while on acid.\n\nThe PoliceFact or Fiction\n\nDo their first three albums have French titles? Is \"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\" really meaningless? See if you can tell in this Fact or Fiction.\n\nJohn Kay of SteppenwolfSongwriter Interviews\n\nSteppenwolf frontman John Kay talks about \"Magic Carpet Ride,\" \"Born To Be Wild,\" and what he values more than awards and accolades."
