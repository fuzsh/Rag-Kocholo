[We] saw the breaking dawn.\"\n\nHis co-star Barry agreed, saying: “Everything was merged..It was crazy. Everyone was dressed up and I didn’t know who was who... When the camera wasn’t on these people, the party was still going on.”\n\nFans have taken to TikTok to share their love for the song. One penned: \"I need to whip my ponytail around in the clurb to this NOWWWWWW\"\n\nAnother said: \"I need to hear this blasting in a club with Jacob Elordi\"\n\nAnd a third wrote: \"need to be clubbing in the UK in the year 2007 with Jacob Elordi bc if not what is even the point of living\" Jacob stans, we hear you.
