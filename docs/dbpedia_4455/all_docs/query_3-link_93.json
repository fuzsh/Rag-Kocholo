        "text": "A: Standard salary pay scale starts from $45,000 to $65,000 per year, and usually with guaranteed pay on “spare board” work. After gaining a few years of experience (and overtime,) you can expect to earn $80,000 or more per year.\n\nThe job may become a lifelong career with opportunities to advance and network in the railway transportation industry spanning across the continent.\n\nThe typical employer is a large, seniority-based, unionized organization.\n\nFor the first three to seven years, work is 24/7 on-call, mostly on spare board, with two hours of notice. Expect long, odd hours, and shift work including weekends and statutory holidays. Depending on the work location, you may work away from home for up to two days at a time.\n\nOutdoor work could be day or night shifts, in all types of weather conditions. Be prepared to supply your own clothing and dress appropriately for sun, rain, wind, sleet, and snow.\n\nWork is physically demanding. You must be able to lift up to 85 lbs., walk on uneven terrain, and perform work while the train is moving.\n\nWork can be dangerous. You need to be safety-oriented and note that the Conductor is usually the first person who appears at the scene of an accident.\n\nWork on and around large, heavy, moving, and stationary equipment is required.\n\nWork independently or in small teams with little or no supervision\n\nA: Excellent verbal and written communication skills to convey accurate information.\n\nProper hand signals, and clear voice, enunciation, and proper protocols on radio equipment. It is important to note that the use of radio communication is more frequent than face-to-face communication.\n\nSkills such as conflict resolution, coaching, and ability to work with small teams of two to three people, with different co-workers in every shift.\n\nMechanical and technical aptitude to operate and carry out basic repairs on freight equipment and track appliances.\n\nCommitment to customer service and safe work practices.\n\nCarry out inspections and tests in accordance with railway rules and specifications.\n\nUse and interpret technical documentation, railway terminology, and railway rules and regulation.\n\nIdentify and document defects, and make necessary repairs on railway equipment.\n\nBasic computer skills to log data, access information, complete self-training, and operate a computerized locomotive.\n\nA: A valid class 5 driver’s licence and reliable transportation is an asset as employees are required to arrive at the home terminal within a two-hour call window. Some employers may also require employees to operate company vehicles.\n\nAll employers require new employees to undergo a criminal record check. Applicants should ensure that they have the ability to pass a criminal record check or obtain a pardon, prior to entering the program.\n\nAll railways have a zero-tolerance policy towards the use of alcohol and drugs. Applicants should be prepared to submit to a mandatory drug and alcohol test upon employment and should expect random alcohol and drug use tests throughout employment. BCIT will enforce the same zero-tolerance policy during training.\n\nThere are a number of strict medical rules and requirements that apply to railway employees, and these may exclude certain candidates from employment, for example, colour blindness, and certain prescription medications. Also, there is a mandatory railway medical exam that must be successfully completed upon employment. Please consult Railway Association of Canada website for the Medical Rules Handbook for specific details.\n\nHigh school graduation or GED required.\n\nPeriodic re-certifications and technical training are required throughout employment.\n\nFlexibility to go where the jobs are, with the understanding that jobs may not be in the Lower Mainland, and there may be layoffs in the first years of this career.\n\nThis program prepares graduates for employment with Class 1 railways and shortlines in North America, industrial railways, sidings, and spurs at grain elevators, dockyards, rail suppliers, and regional carriers"
