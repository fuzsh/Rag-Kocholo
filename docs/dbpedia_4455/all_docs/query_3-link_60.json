        "meta_description": "‘This collection of original papers takes a genuinely international look at the economic regulation of railways. It covers all forms of rail operations (freight, passenger, and local) and a diversity of regulatory regimes, as well as having a substantial geographical coverage. The editors have managed to entice a cornucopia of experts from around the world to contribute. The volume is timely. Railways over the last 50 years have seen economic regulatory adjustments that have affected their ownership, operations, methods of finance, and investment priorities. While one can easily find a common thread in many of these changes, the overriding emphasis has been on more reliance on market forces and lighter interventions by governments, there are considerable national variations in the instruments deployed and the outcomes that have emerged. This volume allows experts to keep abreast of events and thinking in the rail regulatory world and offers newcomers an almost encyclopedic account of the practical and intellectual challenges involved.’\r– Kenneth Button, George Mason University, US",
