This means the opportunity for those in High School to step into a career quickly has never been better.\n\nWe will be holding our annual High School Senior Welding Contest at KWI where students will compete against the best in the nation for a chance to win a $14,000 scholarship!\n\nWe pride ourselve on providing you with the blueprint and tools needed to thrive as soon as you graduate. Right now, there is a gap that exists between what welding education is teaching and what industry demands from a certified welder. We aim to change that.\n\nThatâ€™s why we talked with welders, general foremen, superintendents, inspectors and designed an educational experience that has all the grit and grind of a job site. Not only that, but students get every certification, piece of equipment, and testing needed to show up to jobs with confidence!\n\nEach one of our welding programs are tailored for a successful path into the welding industry. Check out your options today!"
