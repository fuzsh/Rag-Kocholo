This is because the code is developed to update automatically if your score changes. It is a one-off implementation.\n\nIf you choose to download the image file and upload directly, you will need to make sure to update the online rating should it change in the future.\n\nGuidance on the requirements for online display of your food hygiene rating is available\n\nThe previous version of the online ratings has now been retired.\n\nUse the code for the high resolution online ratings provided above if you are adding the online rating to a businesses website.\n\nUse the online rating images provided above if you are sharing across your online or social portfolio.\n\nThe legacy code will remain active until July 2024, after this period it will be retired."
