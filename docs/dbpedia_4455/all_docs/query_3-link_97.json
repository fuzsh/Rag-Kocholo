        "text": "Ways to book:\n\nIt takes just a few clicks to book Passenger Assist when you book direct with LNER.co.uk or through our app. Plus you’ll receive confirmation instantly for wheelchair spaces, while our team handle your assistance booking request separately. Even better, we’ll remember your details for next time. So once it’s set up, it’s sorted.\n\nYou can also benefit from services like Change of Journey and our extended booking Horizon, as well as One Click Delay Repay and our loyalty scheme, LNER Perks. With no need to contact the Customer Service team, it’s easier than ever.\n\nYou can book your Passenger Assist up to 2 hours before your journey. If you are not able to book in advance, let us know when you arrive at the station and the team will be happy to help.\n\nSelect the Passenger Assist option when booking your ticket on the LNER website.\n\nCall 03457 225 225, 24 hours a day.\n\nUse the Text Relay Service 18001 03457 225 225.\n\nBetween the hours 22:00 and 08:00 please phone, textphone or use the Passenger Assist app.\n\nFill out the Passenger Assist form (this will be picked up the next day when our team starts at 8am).\n\nLive Chat daily between the hours of 08:00 - 17:00 - from our 'Help and support' pages.\n\nYou can buy your ticket when you call us to book your Passenger Assist, which will include a reservation to travel on our trains. If you've already booked your ticket online, when you book your Passenger Assist, this will include a reservation, also.\n\nWe have recently rolled out a new Passenger Assist booking system nationally to make the booking process quicker and more reliable. The first time you make a booking over the phone, since the introduction of this new system, you will be asked to provide your personal details again due to GDPR. This will only happen the first time and then you can make bookings going forward as normal.\n\nWhat to do if you book Passenger Assistance and we fail to offer assistance?\n\nWhen you have booked assistance and it has not been delivered we will provide you with compensation for your journey. When your assistance was booked for travel on one of our trains we will offer you a full refund for the cost of the journey. If you were travelling on another train company’s service, please contact that company who will arrange for appropriate redress.\n\nYou can make a complaint by contacting us.\n\nFor more information, please read our Accessible Travel Policy (PDF). The details are laid out in section A8: Redress.\n\nGet station accessibility information\n\nPlan your route through the station, check for accessible toilets or check if there's a sheltered waiting room before travelling. Search for your station to find accessibility information.\n\nOur stations\n\nWheelchair spaces\n\nAll of our trains have spaces for wheelchair users. The maximum size of wheelchair able to safely travel on our trains are:\n\n120cm long by 70cm wide in both First Class and Standard accommodation.\n\nIf you use a mobility scooter and it is within the size dimensions above, you are also able to travel on our trains and use wheelchair spaces. Please note that while you do not need a permit to bring a mobility scooter on an LNER train, some operators do require permits so please check with all train operators involved in your journey before travelling.\n\nA handful of our trains have a slightly different seating layout with the wheelchair space and accessible toilet being located in First Class rather than Standard. If you have reserved a wheelchair space on one of these trains, or require a wheelchair space and one is available, we’ll upgrade you to the First Class on the train for free. Our teams at the station can advise what type of train you are due to travel on.\n\nAccessible toilets\n\nAccessible toilets on Azuma trains\n\nThere are accessible toilets on all Azuma trains but they are located in different coaches depending on the length of train you're in.\n\nOn a 9-coach Azuma the accessible toilets are in coach A and M\n\nOn a 10-coach Azuma the accessible toilets are in coach A, E, F and M\n\nOn a 5-coach Azuma the accessible toilets are in coach A and E.\n\nAccessible toilets on non-Azuma trains\n\nOur wheelchair accessible toilets are located in Standard coach F and coach L in First Class.\n\nVerbal guide to Azuma 9-car\n\nWe have created a verbal guide to assist customers who would like to hear where seating, toilets and bins are located on our new Azuma train.\n\nDownload the verbal guide\n\nFor more information on our new Azuma trains click here to view the Azuma accessibility FAQs.\n\nIf there are any amendments to the accessibility on our trains, this will be updated on our live travel alerts page.\n\nAs part of the sunflower lanyard programme our staff will recognise and help customers who have non-visible impairments wearing a green printed sunflower lanyard. Staff will find out what help is needed and do what they can to accommodate.\n\nWearing a lanyard\n\nYou can wear a green sunflower lanyard at any time and take it off if you decide you do not want any help. You will not be offered any less assistance if you do not have a sunflower lanyard nor do you have any obligation to wear one - this is entirely voluntary.\n\nWhere can I get a lanyard from?\n\nIf you want a lanyard, you can get one from any LNER station by visiting the travel centre or information desk or alternatively, you can also email us at customers@lner.co.uk to request one by post. Please send us your feedback on Twitter using #SunflowerLanyard\n\nThis is the same project that is currently operating in all major UK airports as well as other locations such as Sainsbury's and all other UK train operators. We're using the same sunflower lanyards as these places so if you already have a lanyard you can wear this."
