        "text": "2024 Outstanding Railroad Historic Preservation Award\n\nNRHS, Railway Age, and Railway Track & Structures have joined for a second year to recognize and honor a North American common-carrier railroad for a historically significant preservation project currently in operation, accessible to the public or on display in the United States, Canada or Mexico.\n\nNRHS members and Railway Age and RT&S readers are strong advocates for sharing the railroad industryâ€™s important history. This award is intended to recognize the most outstanding example of historic preservation achieved within the railroad industry itself.\n\nNRHS members, and Railway Age and Railway Track & Structures readers, are invited to nominate their favorite preservation project on the NRHS website. Nominations close August 30, 2024. The Award winner will be announced at the Railway Supply Institute conference in October 2024."
