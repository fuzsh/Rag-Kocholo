We offer programmes to suit all experience levels, through Certificate, Diploma and Degree courses.\n\nFind out more today!\n\nLearn More\n\nFounded in 1999, the Institution of Railway Operators was created to work at the heart of the rail operations community. We are the only professional institution whose focus and specialism are railway operations.\n\nIn 2020, the Institution was recognised by Her Majesty the Queen by the granting of a Royal Charter for its work within the industry. It then became the Chartered Institution of Railway Operators (CIRO).\n\nCIRO offers a combination of learning from our Introduction to Rail course to a Degree in Railway Operations Managements, events, CPD courses, and networking opportunities for current and aspiring rail employees. CIRO also offers a unique Mentoring Scheme where the expertise of industry leaders is shared to support our members. This helps in delivering the very best developmental opportunities and industry-recognised qualifications for the next generation of the rail industry.\n\nWe are proud to bring positive changes and improvements to the industry by working alongside members and rail operations businesses.\n\nThe courses with CIRO are great because you don’t get all of this knowledge in one place anywhere else. It plugs the gaps in your knowledge base, plus there’s the non-academic side which is also great like the events, speakers, webinars and more, they’re very valuable. It gives students a route to an academic qualification that they might not otherwise have.\n\nFormer CIRO graduate and current CIRO tutor Toby Rackliff"
