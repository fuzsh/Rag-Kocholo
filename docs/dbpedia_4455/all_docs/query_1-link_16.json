        "text": "About The UTCRS Consortium\n\nThe Office of the Assistant Secretary of Transportation for Research and Technology (OST-R) within the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) awarded, in the fall of 2013, a grant to establish the University Transportation Center for Railway Safety (UTCRS). At present, the Center for Railway Safety, which is headquartered at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV), operates as a consortium with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI), the University of Nebraska Transportation Center (NTC), the University of South Carolina (UofSC), the University of California-Riverside (UCR), and South Texas College (STC).\n\nAs a Tier 1 University Transportation Center, the UTCRS and its team of educational institutions are focusing on promoting safety of railway transportation systems. Our primary strategic goal is safety of railways systems, with secondary goals of economic strength and global competitiveness, as well as climate and sustainability. The UTCRS consortium research thrust focuses on the development, testing, implementation, and technology transfer of smart technologies for safer railways in collaboration with rail industry partners."
