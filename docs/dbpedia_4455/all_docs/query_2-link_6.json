For example, if your rail sales/service revenue in 2023 was $15 million, you belong to class II-A and should pay $6,500.00 in dues for 2024.\n\n*Important: A member company’s wholly owned divisions or subsidiaries may be included under the principal company’s membership providing that the individual wholly owned divisions or subsidiaries total gross rail sales/service revenue is considered when determining 2022 RSI dues. RSI dues are not prorated, unless otherwise stated, and last one calendar year."
