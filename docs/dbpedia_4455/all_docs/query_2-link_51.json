        "text": "Why Railway Engineering Graduate Study?\n\nAs the railroad industry undergoes unprecedented growth and modernization, its workforce ages rapidly and rail companies scamper to fill positions, particularly in engineering and related technical fields. All major railroad companies and companies that serve the railroad industry are recruiting college students and recent graduates who often have no railroad engineering education or background because of the lack of railroad engineering academic programs in the USA.\n\nOur graduate-level Railway Engineering Certificate program, offered through the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, better prepares graduates for successful careers in the rail industry and gives them a competitive edge in the hiring process. The curriculum was developed based on rail industry feedback related to sought-after skills and qualifications of new hires.\n\nThe 12-credit hour requirements of the certificate program may be fulfilled through online courses, allowing traditional students as well as working professionals to enroll. The program is designed to serve the following groups:\n\njunior engineers already in the industry\n\nundergraduate senior students in engineering or related fields\n\nany level engineers interested in joining the railroad industry\n\nany level engineers seeking professional development through continuing education\n\nProgram of Study\n\nThe graduate Certificate in Railway Engineering consists of a minimum of four (12 credit hours) core and elective courses. Students take one core course, two railway engineering elective courses, and one related engineering or technical elective courses. Railway engineering courses include the following topics:\n\nRailway Infrastructure Planning and Design\n\nRailway Operations and Logistics\n\nDesign of Railroad Bridges and Other Structures\n\nDynamics of Railway Systems\n\nCapstone Design Rail Project\n\nVisit the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering for more information about the faculty and research opportunities in railway engineering.\n\nVisit Graduate Handbooks and Curricula for additional detail.\n\nGraduate Admissions\n\nAll applications must be submitted to the Graduate School of the University of South Carolina. Admissions is competitive. Admission decisions are based on the quality of the applicant's previous university-level academic work, letters of recommendation, GRE scores, and other evidence of past accomplishments.\n\nApplicants should hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in engineering or be within 36 credit hours from completion of the degree requirements from an accredited U.S. institution or an approved international institution.\n\nAdditional Admissions Information:"
