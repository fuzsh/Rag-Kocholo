Rousseau is sat to the right, wearing a straw hat!\n\nA very good boy\n\nRousseau often populated his scenes with exotic animals, rather than family pets, so the inclusion of the Junier's dogs makes this painting a rare, touching portrait of his real-life friends.\n\nAll askew\n\nHenri Rousseau, who'd never had any formal training, was a Naive artist. This can be seen in his flat, seemingly childish style and, here, in his disregard for 'correct' proportions."
