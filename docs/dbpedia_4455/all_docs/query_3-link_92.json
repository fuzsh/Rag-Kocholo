The hydrogenation of FAc in the aqueous phase using metallic- and Re oxide-supported catalysts on graphite was studied, within a temperature range of 200–240 °C, in a batch reactor over a 6 h reaction period. The catalysts were characterized using N2 adsorption–desorption, TPR-H2, TPD-NH3, XRD, and XPS analyses. Catalytic reactions revealed that metallic rhenium and rhenium oxide-supported catalysts are active for the hydrogenation and Piancatelli rearrangement of FAc. Notably, metallic rhenium exhibited a fourfold higher initial rate than rhenium oxide, which was attributed to the higher dispersion of Re in the Re/G catalyst over graphite. Re/G and ReOx/G catalysts tended to rearrange and hydrogenate FAc to 2-(2-oxopropyl)cyclopenta-1-one in water.

As one of the most abundant vesicle types in human blood, pEVs transport a diverse array of bioactive molecules, including growth factors, cytokines, and clotting factors, facilitating crucial intercellular communication, immune regulation, and tissue healing. The unique ability of pEVs to traverse tissue barriers and their biocompatibility position them as promising candidates for targeted drug delivery and regenerative medicine applications. Recent studies have underscored their involvement in cancer progression, viral infections, wound healing, osteoarthritis, sepsis, cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and atherothrombosis. For instance, pEVs promote tumor progression and metastasis, enhance tissue repair, and contribute to thrombo-inflammation in diseases such as COVID-19. Despite their potential, challenges remain, including the need for standardized isolation techniques and a comprehensive understanding of their mechanisms of action. Current research efforts are focused on leveraging pEVs for innovative anti-cancer treatments, advanced drug delivery systems, regenerative therapies, and as biomarkers for disease diagnosis and monitoring. This review highlights the necessity of overcoming technical hurdles, refining isolation methods, and establishing standardized protocols to fully unlock the therapeutic potential of pEVs. By understanding the diverse functions and applications of pEVs, we can advance their use in clinical settings, ultimately revolutionizing treatment strategies across various medical fields and improving patient outcomes.

Although PTC is an indolent tumor with good prognosis, 60–70% of patients still have early cervical lymph node metastasis, typically in the central compartment. Whether there is central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) or not directly affects the formulation of preoperative surgical procedures, given that such metastases have been tied to compromised overall survival and local recurrence. However, detecting CLNM before operation can be challenging due to the limited sensitivity of preoperative approaches. Prophylactic central lymph node dissection (PCLND) in the absence of clinical evidence of CLNM poses additional surgical risks.

The neurobiological mechanisms underlying these adverse effects remain elusive. Here, in a mouse model of PD, we investigated the effects of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R)-preferring agonist pramipexole (PPX) on decision-making. PD model mice were generated using a bilateral injection of the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine into the dorsolateral striatum. Subsequent treatment with PPX increased disadvantageous choices characterized by a high-risk/high-reward in the touchscreen-based Iowa Gambling Task. This effect was blocked by treatment with the selective D3R antagonist PG-01037. In model mice treated with PPX, the number of c-Fos-positive cells was increased in the external globus pallidus (GPe), indicating dysregulation of the indirect pathway in the corticothalamic-basal ganglia circuitry. In accordance, chemogenetic inhibition of the GPe restored normal c-Fos activation and rescued PPX-induced disadvantageous choices. These findings demonstrate that the hyperactivation of GPe neurons in the indirect pathway impairs decision-making in PD model mice. The results provide a candidate mechanism and therapeutic target for pathological gambling observed during D2/D3 receptor pharmacotherapy in PD patients.

We examine the implications for human development arising from the influence of professionalism in HE, presenting the qualitative interpretations of second-career academics, a term we use to describe university teaching staff recruited for their prior industrial experience in STEM professions. Using a phenomenographic approach, we examine the conception of second-career academics and how professionalism influences educational policy and practice in HE. We present four successively inclusive conceptions of experiences, with professionalism expressed as making normative judgements of students’ interactions and behaviours, negotiating those interactions and behaviours with students, critiquing the professional applicability of curricula and activities, and changing those curricula and activities to suit the needs of STEM professions. These conceptions expose challenges related to policy and practice and the roles undertaken by second-career academics, including their enculturation of students into the normative expectations of STEM professions, their influence on the apparent correspondence between HE and work in STEM, and their marketing of STEM professions inside HE.

These drugs also complicate the surgical treatment of neoplasms, as they can hinder wound healing, especially when associated with other unfavorable factors (e.g., previous radiotherapy, diabetes, etc.). We herein present our experience with a 74-year-old SOTR who underwent a radical extended parotidectomy and reconstruction with a submental island flap for a persistent cutaneous squamous carcinoma after radiotherapy; his complicated clinical course was characterized by incredibly slow wound healing. The current literature was reviewed to provide a succinct overview of the main difficulties of head and neck surgery in SOTRs. In particular, the immunosuppressive regimen can be tapered considering the individual risk and other elements should be carefully assessed, possibly prior to surgery, to prevent cumulative harm. New developments, including intraoperative monitoring of flap vascularization through indocyanine green fluorescence video-angiography and the prophylactic application of negative pressure wound therapy, when feasible, may be particularly beneficial for high-risk patients.

This paper endeavors to scrutinize the policy impacts of this measure on elevating cultivated land quality and increasing land area in China. We employ an instrumental variable model with two-way fixed effects to quantitatively analyze the impact of the construction of high-standard farmland on the area and quality of cultivated land, based on panel data from 30 sample provinces in China from 2009 to 2018. Our results indicate that for every additional 10,000 hectares of high-standard farmland construction, the cultivated land area per person increased by 0.004 hectares, and the overall quality improved by 0.004 grade. The mechanism analysis further shows that constructing high-standard farmland indirectly alleviates cultivated land quality by reducing farmers’ use of chemical fertilizers, plastic film, and pesticides. The results imply that the ongoing construction of high-standard farmland remains a pivotal element in ensuring the sustainable utilization of cultivated land resources and achieving food security and agricultural modernization goals in China.

Rail transport significantly influences spatial structures, industrial distributions, and is vital for regional economic integration. Despite its importance, the impact of rail transport on economic equity has not been thoroughly explored in current literature. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the spatiotemporal characteristics of rail transport accessibility and its implications for economic equity in the Guangdong–Hong Kong–Macao Greater Bay Area. We considered high-speed, intercity, and conventional rail transport and employ three distinct indicators—door-to-door travel time, weighted average travel time, and potential accessibility—to provide a nuanced assessment of accessibility in the region. Each indicator provides a unique perspective on how accessibility affects economic equity, collectively broadening the scope of the analysis. From 1998 to 2020, the evolution of rail transport and its consequent impact on regional economic equity is scrutinized. Advanced econometric methods, namely ordinary least squares, and spatial Durbin models, are combined with the Gini coefficient and Lorenz curve for comprehensive quantitative analysis. This approach highlights the dynamic influence of rail transport development on economic equity, contributing to the sustainable urban development discourse. The results reveal that although rail transport advancements bolster connectivity and economic growth, they also exacerbate regional economic inequality. This study provides valuable insights for urban planning and policymaking by elucidating the complex relationship between rail transport accessibility and economic equity. Our findings underscore the importance of implementing balanced and inclusive transport policies that foster growth and efficiency while mitigating socioeconomic disparities.

The suitable process parameters windows were obtained for the butt joining of Al/Mg sheets. The effect of ultrasonic vibration on the macrostructure and mechanical properties of the dissimilar joints was studied. The results showed that the width of the weld nugget zone (WNZ) was enlarged to some extent and the hardness distribution in WNZ was more uniform in UVeFSW. In addition, the application of ultrasonic vibration effectively promoted the interpenetration degree of dissimilar materials in the WNZ so that the mechanical interlocking on the bonding interface of dissimilar Al/Mg materials was enhanced. The facture positions were changed from the bonding interface in FSW to the boundary between WNZ and the thermo-mechanical affected zone, and the ductile fracture zone was expanded. The highest ultimate tensile strength was 205 MPa at the process parameters set of 1200 rpm–50 mm/min in UVeFSW in this experiment. The average ultimate tensile strength of FSW/UVeFSW joints was 172.3 MPa and 184.4 MPa, respectively, and the average ultimate tensile strength was increased by 7.02% with the introduction of ultrasonic vibration.

Methods: The MRI protocol included the quantification of hepatic, pancreatic, and cardiac iron levels (R2* technique), the assessment of biventricular function parameters (cine images), and the detection of replacement myocardial fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement technique). Results: Age, sex, frequency of splenectomy and chelation, and serum ferritin levels were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the two groups, but TI patients started regular transfusions significantly later (p < 0.0001) and showed significantly lower pre-transfusion hemoglobin levels (p = 0.005). No difference was found in hepatic iron levels (p = 0.853). TI patients exhibited significantly lower pancreatic R2* values (p < 0.0001), also correcting for the duration of regular transfusions, and significantly lower cardiac R2* values (p < 0.0001). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, pancreatic iron was the strongest discriminator between the two diseases. Left and right ventricular end-diastolic volume indexes were significantly higher in TI than in TM patients (p = 0.003 and p = 0.046, respectively), but the correction for the duration of regular transfusions removed the disease-specific differences (p > 0.05). Left ventricular (LV) mass index was significantly higher in TI (p = 0.049), while no difference (p > 0.05) was found in biventricular ejection fractions and replacement myocardial fibrosis. Conclusions: TI patients showed lower pancreatic and cardiac iron burden and more pronounced LV hypertrophy. These differences could not be explained by the different duration of the transfusional regimen.

Errors in this process lead to clinical errors, which increase costs and dissatisfaction among physicians and patients. Physicians in developing countries are overloaded with patients and cannot always follow the proper history-taking procedure. The challenges have been acknowledged; however, a comprehensive understanding of the status and the remedies has remained unexplored. This paper aims to investigate the workload, history-taking challenges, and the willingness of the physicians to accept digital solutions. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted on 104 physicians across Bangladesh, featuring 22 questions regarding their professional environment, workload, digitization status of health records, challenges in history taking, and attitudes toward adopting digital solutions for managing patient histories; 92.67% of the physicians face high workloads, 88.46% struggle in medical history taking, and only 4.81% use digital medical records. About 70% struggle to complete the necessary history-taking steps, emphasizing the urgent need for solutions. A novel visualization system, the Smart Health Gantt Chart (SHGC), has been introduced for their instant feedback. A total of 93.27% of physicians expressed their willingness to use such a system. The proposed SHGC has the potential to enhance healthcare efficiency in developing nations, benefit physicians, and improve patient-centered care.

Here, the effects of six Bacillus species on the storage quality of, and antioxidant levels in, the southern highbush blueberry ‘O’Neal’ fruit were investigated. Bacillus treatments reduced the fruit decay rate, slowed fruit quality decline, inhibited malondialdehyde accumulation, and increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity levels. Bacillus altitudinis Y-14 had the best effect overall. Furthermore, the effects of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), B. altitudinis Y-14, and 1-MCP + B. altitudinis Y-14 treatments on the storage quality and antioxidant of rabbiteye blueberry ‘Brightwell’ fruit were investigated, and each treatment effectively reduced the decay rate and weight loss of fruit. When stored for 25 days, the decay rate of the 1-MCP + B. altitudinis Y-14 group was only 8.33%, significantly lower than that of the control. The three treatments delayed the decline in fruit quality, inhibited malondialdehyde accumulation, and increased superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activity levels. The 1-MCP + B. altitudinis Y-14 treatment was more conducive to prolonging the postharvest storage period of blueberries and had the best effect in delaying the decline in fruit quality. Thus, combined 1-MCP and B. altitudinis Y-14 treatment may be an effective way to improve the storage quality and extend the storage period of blueberries, which provides a new way for storing and transporting blueberries to reduce costs and improve economic benefits.

Methods have been developed, including improvements to the automatic control system structural diagram which made it possible to obtain the system transfer function in the bandpass filter transfer function form. The work also improved the fuzzy rules base and the neuron activation function mathematical model, which significantly accelerated the neuro-fuzzy controller training process. The transfer function frequency and time characteristics analysis showed that the system effectively controlled the engine and reduced vibration. Methods for ensuring a guaranteed stability margin and the synthesis of an adaptive filter were studied, which made it possible to achieve the system’s high stability and reliability. The results showed that the developed controller provided high stability with amplitude and phase margins, effectively compensating for changes in external conditions. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the control quality improved by 2.31–2.42 times compared to previous neuro-fuzzy controllers and by 5.13–5.65 times compared to classic PID controllers. Control errors were reduced by 1.84–2.0 times and 5.28–5.97 times, respectively, confirming the developed neuro-fuzzy controller’s high efficiency and adaptability.

In this work, the effects of different influencing factors (including the water-to-binder ratio, coarse aggregate content and carbon fiber (CF) content) on the electric resistance of conductive concrete were systematically investigated. At the same time, ohmic heating (OH) curing was applied to fabricate CF-reinforced conductive concrete (CFRCC) under a negative temperature environment at −20 °C. The effects of different factors on the electrothermal properties (curing temperature and conductive stability) of the samples were studied. The mechanical strengths of the CFRCC cured by different curing conditions were also tested, and the feasibility of OH curing for preparing CFRCC in a negative-temperature environment was verified at various electric powers.

The effects of SA on mechanical properties, thermal stability, antioxidant capacity, and antimicrobial activity of the GA/PPA nanofibers were systematically characterized. The scanning electron microscopy observation results revealed a smooth surface on the nanofibers. The incorporation of SA enhanced the viscosity of the electrospun solutions, and it increased the average diameter of nanofibers from 0.17 μm to 0.28 μm. The tensile strength and thermal stability of the obtained nanofibers were enhanced with the addition of a suitable level of SA (1.5%, w/v), which strengthened the intermolecular interaction. The GA/PPA/SA nanofibers presented over 80% antioxidant capacity and strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Meanwhile, the sensitivity responses of nanofibers to NH3 revealed that GA/PPA/SA II nanofibers (1.5% w/v SA) presented good sensitivity of colorimetric behavior to ammonia. A pork spoilage test was performed to evaluate practical application of the nanofibers, and an obvious color change (dark purple to green) was observed. These results indicated GA/PPA/SA II nanofibers can be utilized as an active and intelligent multipurpose packaging material to preserve and track the freshness of pork.

Achieving 2–3 cm accuracy with RTK requires successful ambiguity resolution, which involves two main steps: identifying the best integer ambiguity candidate and confirming its validity. While previous research has largely concentrated on the first step, including the development of Cascading Ambiguity Resolution methods, and reducing tropospheric delay, studies on the validation of ambiguity for long-distance RTK are limited. This study conducts a thorough examination of ambiguity validation for long-distance RTK, focusing on two prevalent methods: the theoretical success rate and the R-ratio test. The results reveal several key insights. Firstly, the six commonly used bounds for the theoretical success rate are not an accurate reflection of the actual success rate, making them unsuitable for long-distance RTK applications. Secondly, the R-ratio test proves to be dependable when the threshold is set above 1.7, assuming there is a minimum observation period of one minute and at least ten satellites are visible. However, the probability of successfully resolving ambiguities with the R-ratio test does not surpass 50%. Additionally, if ambiguity resolution is not achieved within 20 min, simply prolonging the observation time is generally unproductive. To improve the performance of ambiguity resolution in practical situations that require extended observation times, this research proposes a novel ambiguity validation method. This new approach is based on the duration for which an integer ambiguity resolution candidate maintains the best status. This method aims to provide a reliable means of validating ambiguities in cases where the R-ratio test fails.

In order to ensure the safety of lithium batteries, it is essential to monitor the state of health and state of charge/discharge. There are commonly two methods for measuring lithium batteries: destructive testing and non-destructive testing. Destructive testing is not suitable for in situ or non-destructive analysis as it can cause irreversible deformation or damage to the battery. Herein, this review focuses on three non-destructive testing methods for lithium batteries, including ultrasonic testing, computer tomography, and nuclear magnetic resonance. Ultrasonic testing is widely used in crack and fatigue damage detection. X-ray computer tomography and neutron tomography have gained increasing attention in monitoring the health status of lithium batteries. Nuclear magnetic resonance can be used to conduct in situ and ex situ detection. In this review, non-destructive testing of lithium batteries is summarized, including the current status, achievements, and perspectives of this technology.

This study explores the application of blockchain technology across various environmental domains, such as air quality, climate change impacts, and resource management. The research utilised a dual approach, combining a bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer and a topic analysis using BERT models to assess the discourse within both the scientific literature extracted from Scopus and practical blockchain projects obtained from GitHub. The findings reveal that food security, energy, and sustainable agriculture are predominant topics in academic discussions, with a noticeable increase in focus from 2017 onwards. Practical projects are focused on transparent tracking and decentralised management.

This research examines the distribution characteristics of soil moisture across different microtopographic types in the semi-fixed dunes located at the southeastern edge of the Tengger Desert. We constructed a path model to examine the direct and indirect impacts of topography, shrub vegetation, and herbaceous vegetation. The data encompassed soil moisture, topography, and vegetation variables, which were collected from field experiments to ensure their accuracy and relevance. Furthermore, SHAP models based on machine learning algorithms were utilized to elucidate the specific mechanisms through which key factors influence soil moisture. The results of the descriptive statistics indicate the highest surface soil moisture content, recorded at 1.21%, was observed at the bottom of the dunes, while the leeward slopes demonstrated elevated moisture levels in the middle and deep soil layers, with measurements of 2.25% and 2.43%, respectively. Soil moisture at different depths initially decreases and then increases with greater herbaceous cover and slope direction, while surface soil moisture follows a similar trend in terms of height difference, with 3 m serving as the boundary for trend changes. Middle and deep soil moistures initially increase and then decrease with greater biomass and shrub coverage, with 30 g and 40% serving as the boundary for trend changes respectively. This study elucidates the spatial distribution patterns and influencing factors of soil moisture in semi-fixed dunes, offering valuable references for the establishment of sand-stabilizing vegetation in desert regions.

We prepared CsPbBr3 perovskite microcrystals with different shapes grown directly on planar substrate by conventional drop casting. We observed the formation of CsPbBr3 microcubes on bare indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass. Interestingly, with the same technique, CsPbBr3 microrods were obtained on (3-Aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES)-modified ITO-glass, which we ascribe to the modification of formation kinetics. The obtained microcrystals exhibit an orthorhombic structure. A green photoluminescence (PL) emission is revealed from the CsPbBr3 microrods. Contact angle measurements, Fourier-transform infrared and PL spectroscopies confirmed that APTES linked successfully to the ITO-glass substrate. We propose a qualitative mechanism to explain the anisotropic growth. The microrods exhibited improved PL and a slower PL lifetime compared to the microcubes, likely due to the diminished occurrence of defects. This work demonstrates the importance of the substrate surface to control the growth of perovskite single crystals and to boost the radiative recombination in view of high-performance optoelectronic devices.

However, there is currently no mature method for estimating farmland size in smallholder farming areas. This is due to the small size of farmland plots in these areas, which have unclear boundaries in medium and high-resolution satellite imagery, and irregular shapes that make it difficult to extract complete boundaries using morphological rules. Automatic farmland mapping algorithms using remote sensing data also perform poorly in small-scale farming areas. To address this issue, this study proposes a farmland size evaluation index based on edge frequency (ECR). The algorithm utilizes the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery to compensate for its spatial resolution limitations. First, all Sentinel-2 images from one year are used to calculate edge frequencies, which can divide farmland areas into low-value farmland interior regions, medium-value non-permanent edges, and high-value permanent edges (PE). Next, the Otsu’s thresholding algorithm is iteratively applied twice to the edge frequencies to first extract edges and then permanent edges. The ratio of PE to cropland (ECR) is then calculated. Using the North China Plain and Northeast China Plain as study areas, and comparing with existing farmland size datasets, the appropriate estimation radius for ECR was determined to be 1600 m. The study found that the peak ECR value for the Northeast China Plain was 0.085, and the peak value for the North China Plain was 0.105. The overall distribution was consistent with the reference dataset.

However, the resulting changes in the mechanical properties of these concrete have attracted attention. This study investigates the compressive behavior of concretes where river or sea pebbles partially (i.e., 33% and 67%) or fully (i.e., 100%) replace traditional gravel as coarse aggregate, using a noncontact full-field deformation measurement system based on digital image correlation (DIC). Compared to the traditional gravel concrete (GC), compressive strengths of the river pebble concrete (RPC) at constitution rates of 33%, 67%, and 100% decreased by 6.5%, 29.8%, and 38.9% while those values of the sea pebble concrete (SPC) decreased by 13.1%, 32.7%, and 44.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, SPC exhibited slightly lower compressive strength than RPC. The peak strains of both SPC and RPC decreased at lower substitution rates, although their stress-strain curves resembled those of GC. In contrast, RPC and SPC at higher substitution rates exhibited a noticeable stage of load hardening. Full-field deformation data and interfacial characteristics indicated that the compressive failure modes of both RPC and SPC showed significant interfacial slipping between pebbles and mortar with increasing coarse aggregate substitution rates. In comparison, fractures in coarse aggregate and mortar were observed in damaged GC. The study demonstrated that the spatio-temporal compressive deformation response and failure modes of SPC and RPC were distinct due to the introduction of pebbles, providing insights for engineering applications of river/sea pebble concrete in practical offshore or island construction projects.

In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of S. inversa (GenBank accession number: ON584565.1). The circular mt genome of S. inversa was 335,372 bp in length, containing 62 genes, including 33 mRNAs, 22 tRNAs, 6 rRNAs, and 1 pseudogene, along with 1626 open reading frames. The GC content was 45.14%. Predictive analysis revealed substantial RNA editing, with ccmFn being the most abundantly edited gene, showing 36 sites. Gene migration between the mt and chloroplast (cp) genomes of S. inversa was observed through the detection of homologous gene fragments. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that S. inversa was clustered with Arctium tomentosum (Asteraceae). Our findings provide extensive information regarding the mt genome of S. inversa and help lay the foundation for future studies on its genetic variations, phylogeny, and breeding via the analysis of the mt genome.
