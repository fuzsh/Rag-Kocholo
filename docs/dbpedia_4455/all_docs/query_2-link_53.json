        "text": "The Wheel Rail Interaction conference was created and built on the idea that our industry can only make progress in solving its most difficult challenges, and becoming the best version of itself, if there is free and open communication across the boundaries of traditional organizational silos.\n\nWheel Rail Seminars has excelled in creating events and environments in which there is a positive and open dialogue between personnel involved in rolling stock, track, operations, and management. Updates and ideas are shared between railways, suppliers, consultants, researchers, and regulators. Connections are made and conversations opened between some of the most junior and some of the most experienced members of our industry.\n\nIt has been a great privilege for me to attend and be involved in WRI conferences for nearly 20 years, as a participant, presenter, principles course chair, and most recently co-chair and program director. During this time, I have seen the many ways in which WRI has sparked new ideas and helped to build enduring relationships and networks across diverse members of our community. At each WRI conference there is always something new to learn, someone new to meet, and something valuable to take away."
