        "text": "The Institute of Railway Research within the School of Computing and Engineering at The University of Huddersfield is a world leading centre in the field of railway engineering and risk.\n\nOur research has helped to improve the knowledge of the way in which railway vehicles interact with the track including key performance aspects such as suspension peformance, wheel-rail contact, traction and braking. In partnership with industry and academic partners, this work has led to a number of tools and techniques being developed which are now used to predict deterioration of railway wheels and rails, to optimise the vehicle track interface, to increase safety and reliability levels, reduce cost and improve performance of the railway system."
