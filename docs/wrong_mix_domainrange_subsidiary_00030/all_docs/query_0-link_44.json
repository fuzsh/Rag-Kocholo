They all try to influence public opinion using branding, even if what is getting branded is the truth, a lie, a myth or a conspiracy.\n\n1.\n\nCOMMERCIAL BRANDS\n\nBut before we can explore all of that, we need some shared definitions. “Branding” is the process of purposefully repeating a word, concept or logo until it gets stuck in the minds of the public.2 Commercial branding comes from business entities like partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs) and corporations. Commercial branding is ubiquitous. Nearly from the moment the average American opens her eyes in the morning to the moment she goes to sleep, branding is everywhere, from the products in her bathroom to the food in her kitchen, the vehicles in her garage, the billboards on her commute, the sign outside her workplace, the product placements on TV and the banner ads online. Brands are so omnipresent in our lives that they sometimes slip into genericide. Linguists Julie Sedivy and Greg Carlson, in their book Sold on Language, provide multiple examples of how brands have become shorthand for objects in our daily lives: If you stroll across your linoleum floor over to your formica countertop, check on the stew in the crock-pot, pick up the spilled kitty litter in the corner with a kleenex, pour a bowl of granola, and open your freezer to take out a popsicle before proposing a game of after-dinner ping pong, you are contributing to the genericide of these brand names.3\n\nDan Pallotta, A Logo Is Not a Brand, Harv.

As Professor Tamara Piety notes in her book Brandishing the First Amendment: It is possible to create a brand out of whole cloth. However, because brand value is so dependent on imagery built by communication efforts, it is, to some extent, always susceptible to sudden shifts in public perceptions. Such shifts may include total collapse of all brand value.4\n\nOr as David D’Alessandro, president of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance, once quipped: “It can take 100 years to build up a good brand and 30 days to knock it down.”5 In the Twitter age, death of a brand can happen even quicker. Evidence of the importance of branding to corporations can be seen in the public relations and advertising budgets of firms.6 Most of the corporate money allotted for branding is spent on advertising. As a report in Fortune indicated in 2012, “US companies spend $150 billion annually on advertising and only $5 billion on public relations.”7 By 2018, advertising in the U.S. hit the $166 billion mark ($107 billion of it on digital ads).8 Worldwide spending on advertising in 2018 was $414 billion ($227 billion of it online).9 And some brands exist on a societal level. Think about the ubiquitous “Santa Claus” brand. When I had my son, my husband and I resolved not to lie to him about the existence of Santa Claus. I thought this would be easy. How little did I appreciate the media environment that he would inhabit from age zero to five. First, there were other caregivers in his life—from grandparents to nursery school teachers—who told him Santa was real. Then there were ubiquitous ads on TV, radio and billboards in which Old Saint Nick sold everything from Coke to M&Ms to Norelco shavers. There was the “mall Santa,” with long\n\n4 Tamara R.

There were men on Christmas pub crawls through Brooklyn dressed in red suits and fake white beards. But the real nail in the coffin for our battle with this branded lie was PBS. My young son saw Santa show up in most of his children’s shows, from Bob the Builder to Thomas the Tank Engine. And for him, that made Santa real—at least when he was very young. I could not have been prouder when, as a five-year-old, he said to me and my husband, “Wait, this Santa thing doesn’t add up.” And we said, “You’re right. It doesn’t.” The spell was broken. The word “brand” comes from the Old English word “brond,” meaning “fire,”10 which in turn came from the Norse word “brandr,” which meant “burn.”11 Branding’s historical roots derive from farmers using a red-hot iron to sear an image, like the initials of the owner or a family crest, into the flesh of livestock. This type of “branding” was a way of telling Farmer Joe’s cows from Farmer Steve’s cows. The practice of branding cattle goes back thousands of years. According to the Smithsonian, branding dates back to at least 2700 BC, where there is evidence of livestock branding depicted in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.12 By the 1500s, “brand” in English referred “to a mark burned on cattle to show ownership.”13 In the American context, branding cows was important at the slaughterhouse, where payment to the source farms could depend on how many animals bearing a particular “brand” were slaughtered.14 Trademarks on hand-crafted goods have a parallel history to agricultural branding. In Europe, during the Middle Ages, craft guilds would stamp craftworks with marks of both the artisan and the guild.15 The guild mark alerted customers that the creation was up to the guild’s high standards.16 Modern trademarks can serve a similar purpose: think of an ABATM (American Bar 10 Online Etymology Dictionary, Branding, www​.etymonline​.com/​index​.php​?term​ =​brand (“brand (n.) Old English brand, brond ‘fire, flame …’”). 11 Matt Shadel, A Brief History of Branding, Convoy (Jan. 8, 2014), www​ .weareconvoy​.com/​2014/​01/​a​-brief​-history​-of​-branding/​ (“The modern word Brand is derived from the word ‘Brandr’, a word from Ancient Norse meaning ‘to burn . . .’”). 12 Jimmy Stamp, Decoding the Range: The Secret Language of Cattle Branding, Smithsonian (Apr. 30, 2013). 13 Shadel, supra note 11. 14 Jerry McLaughlin, What is a brand, anyway?, Forbes (Dec. 21, 2011) (“As the cattle moved across the plains on their way to Chicago slaughter houses, it was easy to determine which ranches they were from because each head of cattle was branded.”). 15 Thomas D. Drescher, The Transformation and Evolution or Trademarks—from Signals to Symbols to Myth, 82 Trademark Rep. 301, 314 (1992) (“In the 1300s, master craftsmen in a guild had to choose a mark specific to their work which would be affixed to their products.”). 16 Id. at 316 (crafts usually bore a second mark as well, which represented the collective mark of the guild. This mark certified the craft met the regulations and criteria of that guild.).\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\n4\n\nPolitical brands\n\nAssociation) approved law school. ABATM accreditation tells the public that that particular school has met the guild’s high standards. The meaning of “branding” has certainly evolved beyond marking livestock with hot irons. According to Mustafa Kurtuldu, “[t]he transition from ‘This belongs to me, so leave it …’ to ‘This was made by me, so buy it’ started to evolve in the 1800’s.”17 Commercial branding as Americans know the practice today took off as corporations tried to market what had been previously undistinguishable dry goods, like fungible piles of oats or beans.18 The “brand” told the customer which corporation was the source of a particular box of oats or can of beans. While it may not have mattered to the average farmwife shopping at a dry goods store on the prairie in the 1800s whether she bought Quaker Oats or Heinz Beans, it mattered a great deal to the Quaker and Heinz corporations, which spent handsomely to advertise the high quality of their oats, beans or whatever else they were selling, so that shoppers around the nation would buy these brands over similar quality, but unadvertised or generic alternatives.19 The need for branding is most acute when the market is flooded with nearly indistinguishable and fungible goods. As Forbes once explained of Coke: In the late 1880s, for example, as the Coca-Cola Company was getting started, there were many soda producers in every market. Before Coca-Cola could get a customer to reach for a Coke, it needed to be sure the customer could distinguish a Coke from all the other fizzy caramel-colored beverages out there … A Coke is a fizzy caramel-colored soda concocted by those folks in Atlanta.20\n\nCoca-Cola was started as patent medicine that was advertised as “an ideal nerve tonic,” which contained wine and cocaine. After a local temperance law passed, later formulations of Coke changed to sugar and cocaine. Then finally Coca-Cola went with its modern formula of just sugar and caffeine.21 In the 1800s, patent medicines were heavily advertised, including strange tinctures which claimed to be miracle cures for exhaustion and headaches. Often the main active ingredient was cocaine, just like the original Coca-Cola.22 But the corporations making the patent medicines wanted consumers to buy their cocaine, not the other guy’s cocaine.\n\n17 Mustafa Kurtuldu, Brand New: The History of Branding, Design Today (Nov. 29, 2012), www​.designtoday​.info/​brand​-new​-the​-history​-of​-branding/​. 18 Drescher, supra note 15 at 321 (up until the post-Civil War period, many commodities were fungible.). 19 Id. at 323 (Quaker Oats was not started by a Quaker.). 20 McLaughlin, supra note 14. 21 James Hamblin, Why We Took Cocaine Out of Soda, Atlantic (Jan. 31, 2013). 22 Kurtuldu, supra note 17.\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nBranding itself: an introduction\n\n5\n\nAnd this process continues today, as firms try to distinguish their company’s cookie-cutter SUV, sedan or pick-up truck from another company’s cookie-cutter SUV, sedan or pick-up truck merely with a hood ornament or a name on the bumper. For instance, what love and a hatchback station wagon have to do with each other is a mystery to me, but years of ads have told millions of consumers that “love is what makes a Subaru a Subaru.”23 Typically, building up positive connotations for a brand is done through advertising using standard puffery.24 Old standbys for advertisers are the assertion (true or not) that if the customer buys this product, she will be more powerful, rich, intelligent, sexy, envied or successful.25 But the lies to sell products can get out of hand, as Vance Packard complained in his book The Waste Makers: “Millions of consumers are manipulated, razzle-dazzled, indoctrinated, mood-conditioned, and flimflammed.”26 Jingles to sell products are often “earworms” that get stuck in viewers’ heads. They can be so insidious that even if viewers hate the product or the company behind it, the ad copy is stuck in their minds. As Drew Westen notes, “[w]hen even people who don’t like your product are humming your jingle, you know you’ve got them where it counts: in their [neural] networks.”27 Likewise, ad man Nigel Hollis once wrote: engaging and memorable ads slip ideas past our defenses and seed memories that influence our behavior. You may not think advertising influences you. But marketers do. And in addition to millions of dollars, they have something else most people don’t have: Access to data that proves their point.28\n\nDiana T.

Objectively, this is somewhat absurd, since a heavily advertised item could be poorly constructed, carcinogenic or addictive. But nonetheless, this is a measurable phenomenon: Repetition of an ad may signal to consumers that the brand or product is a good buy, or a quality product. This is sometimes referred to as signaling theory. In 1975, University of Wyoming researchers Anthony McGann and Raymond Marquardt found that ads with high rates of repetition tended to also be rated as high quality in Consumer Reports.30\n\nAnd even more disturbingly, the more an ad is repeated, the more viewers will believe it (even if the claim that is being repeated is not true). “Studies suggest that repeated statements are perceived as more truthful than statements made less frequently, ‘presumably because repetition imbues the statement with familiarity.’ In simple terms: frequency breeds familiarity, and familiarity breed trust.”31 A well-established brand enables the brand owner to charge a premium over a competing similar generic product or service.32 Thus, the economic meaning of a “brand” is that value-added quality of a product that convinces a customer\n\n29 David Brandt, Understanding Memory in Advertising, Nielsen (Feb. 22, 2017), www​.nielsen​.com/​us/​en/​insights/​journal​-of​-measurement/​volume​-1​-issue​ -3/​understanding​-memory​-in​-advertising​.html; Sean H.

Forbes estimated the value of Nike’s swoosh at $26 billion;43 though that pales in comparison to Apple’s “apple with a missing bite” brand, which Forbes valued at $170 billion.44 Typically, because they want to be able to charge a premium, most owners of commercial brands try to steer clear of negative connotations. There are, of course, a few brands that like to flirt with a more edgy image as a way to cut through the clutter and enter the public consciousness. Think of Red Bull’s sponsorship of dangerous sporting events and stunts, some of which have turned deadly.45 Here, being a “renegade” is part of building the brand. If branding is in part a battle to grab the audience’s attention, then being “extreme” can actually be helpful in building a brand. But edgy brands walk a delicate line. If the “extreme” brand or the “extreme” brand ambassador gets in real trouble socially or legally, then the company behind the brand can suffer. For instance, before it went bankrupt in 2017,46 American Apparel had ads with models wearing nothing but socks or legwarmers, or in other states of undress.47 The sexualized image seemed to help sell the brand, which lasted 19 years. American Apparel’s founder, Dov Charney, seemed to revel in the controversy over the sexy ads, which won\n\nSee Lauren Behr, Trademarks for the Cure: Why Nonprofits Need Their Own Set of Trademark Rules, 54 B.C.

For example, when Tiger Woods was suspected of cheating on his wife, many brands that he had endorsed dropped him as a spokesperson.50 And when Michael Vick got in criminal trouble for dog fighting, brands similarly shunned him.51 As reported in Advertising Age, “[w]hen you hang a brand on one guy, you’re taking a huge risk.”52 Some companies will even rebrand if the old brand has picked up too many negative connotations. In an episode of The Simpsons, there is the following colloquy: Kent Brockman from the TV: In response to the outcry, Lard Lad’s parent company, Tianjin Mining and Smelting and Donuts, has issued the following statement: “We are rebranding Lard Lad with an updated statue.” Homer: Ooh, rebranding! Lisa: That just means admitting failure, Dad. Homer: Ooh, admitting failure!53\n\nAnd indeed, rebranding is typically an admission that the previous brand has failed. An example of this phenomenon is when a mobile payment system called “Isis” decided to rebrand itself as “Softcard” in 2014 because of the possible negative connotation associated with the terrorist group ISIS.54 The companies involved in the Isis mobile payment project included AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile, which decided that despite the price of rebranding, it\n\nHannah Marriott, Dov Charney: the man who put the sleaze factor into American Apparel, Guardian (June 19, 2014). 49 Frank Bruni, A Grope and a Shrug Dov Charney, American Apparel and Sexual Harassment, N.Y.

The most effective branding can get into our heads so deeply that it warps how we see ourselves. As Amanda Hess observed: “now branding has taken over not just work but life itself, seizing control of our appearances, our social relationships, even our approach to civil society.”60 Put another way, “[b]rands allow businesses to reach consumers directly with messages regarding emotion, identity, and self-worth. …”61 Branding often plays on our emotions and tries to fill deep psychological needs like wanting to accepted.62 Ads—whether they are advertising a product or a candidate—are trying to shape our impression of what’s for sale and whether we want that in our lives.\n\n55 Stephen T.

You want the customer to fall in love with your product and have a profound brand loyalty when actually content may be very similar to hundreds of competing brands.’ To create this illogical loyalty, he said, the first task ‘is one of creating some differentiation in the mind—some individualization for the product which has a long list of competitors very close to it in content.’”).\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nBranding itself: an introduction\n\n11\n\nTo get into our brains, being the first to make a first impression matters. As Drew Westen put it: We have known for half a century that in advertising, being the first to make a pitch renders an effort at persuasion more effective. The one who gets there first has the widest latitude in shaping [neural] networks while they are most malleable (i.e., when no other dots have been firmly connected.)63\n\nOne way to get there “first” is to hit customers while they are still children, when their minds still have plasticity. Targeting children is important for advertisers because “[w]e do the overwhelming majority of our learning when we are children. By the time we are seven, most of our mental highways have been constructed.” 64 If an advertiser can’t get to us as children, it will try to get to us as adults through our emotions,65 since: emotion continues to provide us with new imprints throughout our lives. … [For instance,] Americans alive today can vividly relive the experience of watching the World Trade Center towers fall. This is because these experiences are so emotionally powerful that they are effectively seared onto our brains.66\n\n2.\n\nPOLITICAL BRANDS\n\nThe language of marketing has infected political discourse. Recall when President George W. Bush’s Chief of Staff Andrew Card once said, “You don’t introduce new products in August,” explaining why the administration didn’t try to “sell” the second Gulf War to the American public during the summer of 2002.67 Or as pollster Celinda Lake explained, “whether you’re Pepsi or Obama you have to run a campaign to get your brand out.”68 Political branding comes from the government and from political actors such as candidates, political action committees (PACs), 527s, politically active\n\nWesten, supra note 27, at 346.

When the branding comes from the government, it can be anything from useful public information—like what constitutes a balanced diet based on the best available scientific knowledge, as visualized in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s food pyramid—to actual government propaganda, like lying about what happened at the Gulf of Tonkin. Branding from the government is propaganda when it feeds the public a particular view that is deeply misleading. Of course, the word “propaganda” carries with it a century of negative connotations.69 Though interestingly, even the word “propaganda” started with different connotations than what it has now. The word was coined by the Vatican in 1622. The original idea from Pope Gregory XV was to propagate the Christian faith in the New World through “propaganda.”70 Only many centuries later, after the First World War, did the word “propaganda” turn into the ugly manipulative mess that it is today. Political campaigns are one place where political branding attempts to define candidates, policies, even the state of the nation. Incumbents will try to brand the economy as outstanding and brand themselves as the cause of the nation’s success. Challengers will try to brand the country as being on the wrong track and brand themselves as the catalyst for needed change. Another key to success for many vying for high office is the ability to convince disenchanted voters that the candidate can save them. This might explain the election and re-election of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who promised a nation of “forgotten men” going through its worst financial Depression a “New Deal”— one of the all-time great political brands in history.71 In candidate campaigns, which often rely on broadcast ads to reach large and dispersed electorates, the first casualty is often the truth. If you think that elections are cerebral affairs decided by logic and facts, I have bad news for you:72 Two-thirds of voters’ decisions to support one candidate or another could be accounted for by two simple variables: their partisan feelings and their feelings\n\nMark Crispin Miller, Introduction to Edward Bernays, Propaganda 9 (1928 reprinted 2005) (“Prior to World War One … propaganda tended not to be the damning term we throw around today … [Now it means] lies, half-truths, selective history or the other tricks[.]”). 70 Id. 71 V.O. Key, Jr., Politics, Parties, & Pressure Groups 187 (1964 5th ed.)

Stouffer, director of the Laboratory of Social Relations, Harvard University… [said] it was a good working rule that people’s attitudes are more easily reached through their emotions than through their intellects.”). 69\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nBranding itself: an introduction\n\n13\n\ntowards the candidates. Candidates’ positions on the issues had only a modest effect on their electoral preferences.73\n\nPut another way, depressingly, facts frequently have nothing to do with who is electable. As Joe McGinniss summed up in his book The Selling of the President, “Politics, in a sense, has always been a con game.”74 Often what political ads play on is not the argument that we should support a particular new candidate, but rather that we (the viewer) already support the candidate because the candidate is on our team or in our tribe. As cognitive scientists show, evoking a “team” is a powerful motivator. A recent study showed that “once a group is marked as competitive, Schadenfreude [taking pleasure in the misfortune of others] and Glückschmerz [sorrow felt at the good fortune of others] follow: no learning is required.”75 For some of us, triggering the hatred of another person from another team or love of our team is nearly automatic with the right prompt. Branding played a crucial role in the 2016 election. As Trump’s ex-personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified before Congress on February 27, 2019: Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation – only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the “greatest infomercial in political history.” He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign – for him – was always a marketing opportunity.76\n\nBranding has surely taken center stage with the Trump Presidency. Trump’s repetitive rhetoric can leave the impression that he has a limited vocabulary. But as a master brander, he knows that repetition of catchphrases or an image is the way to hammer a point home. He’s not the only one who can deploy this technique. The day after Trump was inaugurated, a Women’s March in Washington, D.C. to protest him attracted more attendees than his inauguration. One way the two crowds could be distinguished at a distance was that many in the Trump crowd wore red “Make America Great Again” hats and\n\nWesten, supra note 27, at 119.

Branding techniques do not have to be used for an iniquitous telos. For example, branding techniques were used by Sesame Street to teach generations of children to read.78 In 1969: John W. Macy, Jr. wrote an investigation of how public broadcasting might better serve American viewers. ‘This program [Sesame Street] is directed at teaching pre-schoolers letters of the alphabet and numbers by using the commercial advertising techniques of animation, jingles, and so forth,’ he wrote.79\n\nAnd there is some discussion of positive uses of branding in this book, like those deployed by survivors of the Parkland massacre. But most of the book is focused on when branding is used to manipulate and abuse the public, often for base political ends. The results of the 2016 presidential election motivated me to write this book. How, I wondered, could America have elected a brand as president? The other occurrence that motivated me to write this book is a sense that Americans are suffering from “truth decay.”80 To me, electing a brand president and the decay of truth are intertwined, because the more that voters rely on flashy branding to dictate who is electable, the more they are likely to fall for a slick, media-savvy candidate over a competent and truthful one. I am a campaign finance lawyer by training. And one of the drivers of the high price of political campaigns is the exorbitant cost of advertising. What first got me interested in branding was a statement from Senator Russ Feingold, who warned in 2011 that political spending by companies may cause\n\n77 Design legend Debbie Millman on branding, illustration and podcasting, Breed (May 16, 2018), https://​breedlondon​.com/​debbie​-millman/​. 78 Joan Ganz Cooney, The Potential Uses of Television in Preschool Education: a report to the Carnegie Corporation of New York 10 (1966), www​.joanganzcooneycenter​ .org/​wp​-content/​uploads/​2014/​01/​JGC​_1966​_report​.pdf (“If we accept the premise that commercials are effective teachers, it is important to be aware of their characteristics, the most obvious being frequent repetition, clever visual presentation, brevity and clarity … unfortunately for our children, many teachers may have forgotten what Madison Avenue, with consummate skill, had cribbed from them.”). 79 Erin Blakemore, Sesame Street’s Controversial Early Years, JSTOR Daily (Apr. 7, 2017), https://​daily​.jstor​.org/​sesame​-streets​-controversial​-early​-years/​. 80 Jennifer Kavanagh & Michael D.

The criminal and congressional investigations into Trump’s election in 2016 have provided a treasure trove of information for a researcher like me. In a typical election, political ads that were placed on Facebook for a millisecond could be lost to history. But now some of those ads, because they are suspected to be part of a foreign attack on the integrity of our elections, are part of a permanent and public Congressional record. Like the Congressional investigation into Watergate, which gave the public a rare peek behind the curtain into the 1972 election, the investigations into the 2016 election provide a chance for a deeper dive on how modern elections are transforming. A final reason that I wanted to write this book is to show the artifice of political branding. Typically, the people using political branding techniques are just trying to manipulate the public. When President Trump calls his Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida the “Winter White House,” that is branding—and not original branding either. President Nixon (1969−74) called his Florida home the “Winter White House” as well.84 When Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s investigation into the 2016 election is called a “witch hunt” by Presidential Advisor Kellyanne Conway, that is branding.85 Again, it’s not original branding.

Again, it wasn’t original; it went back to President Ronald Reagan, among others.88 Senator Richard Neuberger also used the phrase “drain the swamp” in a piece in the New York Times urging the adoption of public financing for federal elections back in 1956.89 The original Mother Jones (the woman whom the magazine is named after) also said “drain the swamp” in 1913.90 Even Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi in 2006 called for Democrats to “drain the swamp” after years of unified Republican rule under President George W. Bush.91 But when working for a firm called Cambridge Analytica, Steve Bannon tested the phrase “drain the swamp” years before it was used in the 2016 election campaign by candidate Donald Trump.92 Clearly, what Mr. Bannon was doing was brand testing, and “drain the swamp” hit the right chord for his target market. My hope is that perhaps when Americans see that “Winter White House,” “witch hunt” and “drain the swamp” are all just basic branding trying to sell something, they can be less gullible about falling for messages designed to tug at our emotions\n\nIckes Assails Acts of ‘Witch Hunters’, N.Y.

But the repeated branding can put both Trump and Subaru in a more positive light, such that you may buy Trump’s claims just as you might purchase a Subaru station wagon. Let me close this introduction by noting that “branding” has been called “a process of manufacturing meaning.”94 I don’t disagree, but that is precisely why branding’s power needs to be interrogated. Manufacturing meaning is a scary power in the wrong hands. During the Third Reich in Germany, propagandist Joseph Goebbels “manufactured meaning” too. It led to genocide and a World War Here is the structure of this book. Part I, “The Legal Landscape,” will look at how the Supreme Court has set the ground rules for political discourse, especially in elections—including whether people can lie in elections, who can fund them, and how much dark money is allowed. This new legal landscape is created by a Supreme Court that has defined corruption incredibly narrowly, to the delight of dishonest politicians everywhere. Part II, “Branding Infecting Politics,” will deal with the phenomenon of commercial branding techniques being utilized in political campaigns against the backdrop of America’s growing partisan rift. This section will cover elections from Eisenhower to Trump. Part III, “When Branding Gets Pernicious,” examines what happens when branding is used to do socially destructive things like damaging the free press, exacerbating racial tensions and undermining the integrity of a presidential election. And finally, Part IV, “Rejecting Toxic Brands,” explores how citizens and customers are rejecting certain brands (or in some cases embracing others) because of their perceived political stances. Here, boycotts and other tactics are discussed. In the epilogue, I offer some policy prescriptions to address many of the problems that this book highlights along the way.\n\nRobert Spero, Duping of the American Voter 166 (1980) (“The political television commercial … is a dangerous weapon in the hands of the unscrupulous …”). 94 Stein, supra note 2. 93\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nPART I\n\nThe legal landscape Commercial branders often lie to sell soap. Should branders also be able to lie to sell who is standing on a political soapbox? By setting the ground rules for elections, the Supreme Court enables many pathologies in politics, including mendacity and corruption. The results of this can be seen in the ways that dishonest politicians cite to campaign finance cases to try to wriggle out of criminal liability. The results can also be seen in corporate political spending in elections, which was enabled by Citizens United v. FEC, and in dark political spending that has reached over $1 billion since 2010. Instead of allowing for laws that require some truthfulness in political campaigns or that restrain the influence of money in politics, the Supreme Court is deregulating politics into a Wild West where nearly anything goes. The message that the Supreme Court has broadcast is that it will not act as a check on the worst instincts in American politics. In the cases discussed in this part of the book, the Supreme Court sets the stage for the debased politics where the candidate with the most money tends to win, corrupt politicians duck behind the First Amendment to try to avoid jail time and lying has become such a problem that a national paper of record has to create the “bottomless Pinocchio” to capture the high level of mendacity of the president.\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\n1. Branding truth “Truth is not always valued and falsehood is not always punished.”1\n\n1. INTRODUCTION Branding is the process by which an idea is repeated again and again until it is accepted by the target audience. Mass-marketed branding has a target audience of nearly every man, woman and child who consumes.2 But brand marketing can be microtargeted to a particular demographic, income group or subculture. For example, Dove soap, which targets women with images of empowerment that are ostensibly against lookism, and Ax soap, which targets men with sexist appeals, are both sold by the same company (Unilever), just to different target demos. The same branding techniques can be used in noncommercial spheres. For example, with propaganda, an idea (often an untrue one) is repeated by the government or reiterated by an official to the electorate, until it is accepted as the truth. With commercial branding, the message is typically a combination of “this product lives up to expectations” and “please buy this product right now.” For luxury items, the branding is frequently, “this product is a status symbol” and “when you can afford it, treat yourself to this luxury.” There’s also the perennial claim that “this product is cool” and “if you buy this product, you’ll be cool too.” The basic message is to get the public to buy, buy, buy—but buy our widget, not the other guy’s widget. With political branding (or government propaganda), the messages can be more varied, since the topics that politics touch can be everything from environmental policy to the price of milk (not that those are completely unrelated either); but at the end of the day, the political brander or government propagandist is also hoping that the public will buy, buy, buy. In the political context, however, the audience is urged to buy our idea, not the other guy’s idea.\n\nDavid Snyder, media attorney at the Florida Bar Reporters Workshop (2018).

It works the same way an urban legend does. One of the great human conundrums is why false myths stick around so long. Old wives’ tales and urban legends persist in part because they are circulated through networks of trust: a parent, a friend, a peer or a co-worker says the mythic claim and it suddenly takes on an air of truth, especially if it is repeated and reinforced. Take this old wives’ tale: “cold water boils faster than hot water.” Parents tell this to children in many an American kitchen. Line cooks and chefs tell it to busboys and bar backs. The claim also gets repeated on a myriad of cooking shows on television.3 The only problem is, it isn’t true. Hot water boils faster. But hear something from a trusted source, especially from multiple trusted sources, and the end result is it seems “true.” It can be mind-blowing when at long last it is revealed that the physics just doesn’t add up for the cold-water-boils-quicker myth.4 Branders and purveyors of lies tap into the same trusted networks that allow myths and old wives’ tales to persist. Facts have the power to cut through even longstanding myths. For centuries, people believed, as Aristotle had postulated, that heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. But this myth was shattered by a simple experiment when Galileo dropped two cannon balls of different weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. And “when Galileo dropped two balls—a heavy one and a light one— and the world witnessed that both hit the ground at the same time[,] [i]t was the beginning of the end of the Aristotelian, prescientific civilization. . .”5 Truth still has that power to blast through lies and bluster and act as a myth buster. This chapter will explore how America is going through a period of truth decay, and that a major catalyst for this decay is the extraordinary level of mendacity issuing from the White House. As explained below, lies started from the very first week of the Trump Administration and, if anything, the pace of dishonesties has accelerated. Two and half years in, the rate of lying from President Trump averaged 15−16 lies a day. Finally, this chapter will explain how the Supreme Court deals with lying. Spoiler alert: it’s not reassuring.\n\n‘Chef’ Thinks That Cold Water Boils Faster Than Hot Water, Hell’s Kitchen (May 1, 2018). 4 Anahad O’Connor, The Claim: Cold Water Boils More Quickly Than Hot Water, N.Y.

Unfortunately, political actors, governments (foreign and domestic), advertisers and broadcasters, just to name a few, are all trying to influence what the public thinks is true.7 And, of course, great philosophers have also spent their lives debating the nature of truth and how to discern it.8 Sidestepping most of these higher-level philosophical debates about the nature of “truth,”9 there are things that happened—those things are true; and there are things that have never happened—those things are false. For example, there was a war in the 1930s and 1940s called the Second World War; that happened, that is a truth.10 The idea that Adolph Hitler survived the Second World War is an event that did not happen and is false.11 There was a genocide of Jewish people during the Second World War; that happened, that is a truth.12 Denial that there was a Holocaust during the Second World War is a dangerously false claim and therefore a lie.13 And, of course, there are many things that are much more debatable, or in a grey zone, like whether the color aqua is really blue or green. When discussing truth in this chapter, this word indicates events that actually happened, either in history or more recently.\n\nPackard, supra note 2, at 257. Darrell M.

The Rand report notes three other periods in American history which also had indicia of truth decay: the 1880s–90s, 1920s–30s and 1960s–70s.16 As the authors noted, these periods (the Gilded Age, the Roaring Twenties followed by the Great Depression, and the tumult of the 1960s and 1970s) were marked by economic disruption, which typically made income inequality more severe as a chosen few became wealthy and the have-nots displaced by the new economy struggled to find their footing. During these periods of social and economic uncertainty, lies and demagoguery flourished and truth took a beating.17 Just as a product can be branded, “truth” can branded too.18 Like all branding, the impact is most effective when a brand is repeated again and again from a source of authority.

In 1968, more people voted against Nixon (combining votes for Humphrey and Wallace 40 million votes) than voted for him (31.7 million votes).19 In 1972 Nixon won in a landslide of 46 million votes to McGovern’s 28 million. As Robert Spero warned then: That [the president’s] myths were reinforced by a landslide made them and the mythology all the more dangerous. Huge winning margins tend to bond mythology to the public mind until long after an election is over. Despite ample evidence to the contrary, the public automatically reasons that if so many people voted for the winner, his principles and programs must be just and true.20\n\nLike Nixon in 1968, Trump in 2016 lost the popular vote, but he still was cloaked with authority. President Trump has the bully pulpit, not to mention two far-reaching Twitter handles (@realdonaldtrump with 62 million followers and @potus with 26 million followers).21 And this is in a media environment where roughly 69 percent of Americans consume social media.22 Most social media users check in at least a once a day.23 One notable attribute of this era is the embrace by President Trump of all-out, bold-faced lying. Lying about big things; lying about small things; lying about things that are easily disproved; lying about things that are hard to disprove; lying about science; lying about economics; lying about basic math—the list goes on. “You are entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts,” said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.24 But this Senator’s words of wisdom are ignored as mendacity rains down on America’s citizenry from on high, from the Trump White House. Candidate Trump previewed what would happen in the Trump presidency.25 There was good reason for the Oxford Dictionary to 19 Louis Menand, Lessons From the Election of 1968, New Yorker (Jan. 8, 2018) (“In close elections, such as those of 1960, 1968, and 1976, the vote is essentially the equivalent of flipping a coin. … But we interpret the result as though it reflected the national intention, a collective decision by the people to rally behind R., and repudiate D.”). 20 Robert Spero, Duping of the American Voter 125 (1980). 21 Twitter as of June 20, 2019. 22 Social Media Fact Sheet, Pew (Feb. 5, 2018), www​.pewinternet​.org/​fact​-sheet/​ social​-media/​(“in 2005, just 5% of American adults used at least one of these platforms.

President Nixon (R) and President Clinton (D) were also noted fabulists. Whether it was Nixon’s claim that “I’m not a crook” (narrator’s voice: he was); or Bill Clinton’s claim, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky,” (narrator’s voice: he did),27 presidents have been known to lie to the American public in significant ways about serious subjects. Or, jumping way back, during the election of 1800, Thomas Jefferson’s side accused John Adams of being a hermaphrodite (narrator’s voice: he wasn’t), while John Adams’ side accused Thomas Jefferson of being a Jacobin (narrator’s voice: he wasn’t).28 On the second day in the Trump presidency, Donald Trump claimed erroneously that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest in history.29 This was not true. That honor belonged to President Barack Obama’s 2009 inaugural,30 which makes sense as President Obama was the first African American president and Washington, D.C. is a majority Black city.31 Even the U.S. Park Service put out pictures comparing President Obama’s huge inaugural crowd to President Trump’s comparatively paltry inaugural crowd.32 But undaunted, Press Secretary Sean Spicer went to the podium in the White House briefing room and repeated the lie that the crowd at the Trump inauguration was the\n\nOxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2016 is..., Oxford Dictionaries (Nov. 17, 2016), https://​www​.oxforddictionaries​.com/​press/​news/​2016/​11/​17/​WOTY​-16. 27 Millman, supra note 8, at 175–176 (“‘We really can’t know if something is true or not,’ maxim of the deconstructionists, or Bill Clinton’s infamous equivocation, ‘That depends on what the meaning of “is” is.’”). 28 Kerwin Swint, Adams vs. Jefferson: The Birth of Negative Campaigning in the U.S., Mental Floss (Sept. 9, 2012), http://​mentalfloss​.com/​article/​12487/​adams​-vs​ -jefferson​-birth​-negative​-campaigning​-us; C.

But Spicer also broadcast this lie to the world—and it sits on the White House’s webpage to this day.34 When a journalist asked Presidential Aide Kellyanne Conway about Spicer’s lie, she said Spicer was only providing “alternative facts.”35 Again, that was just in week one, but the rebranding of the truth by the Trump White House had already begun. President Trump has surrounded himself with individuals who will echo and amplify his misstatements of facts without correcting them. Sean Spicer was all too willing to spread falsehoods. His replacement, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, perpetually told the press corps the functional equivalent that the “sky is green.” Politifact had Huckabee Sanders’ rating as 75 percent “false” and 25 percent “pants on fire.”36 Editorialist Frank Bruni said of Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ pressers: “For some 20 minutes every afternoon, down is up, paralysis is progress, enmity is harmony, stupid is smart, villain is victim, disgrace is honor, plutocracy is populism. . .”37 The war over false narratives that were present in the Trump 2016 campaign continued seamlessly into the Trump presidency. “We have to fight over basic facts these days,” Washington Post White House reporter Abby Phillip told the audience at the New Establishment Summit.38 Ms. Phillip reported that the team of fact checkers at her paper are working overtime to just keep up with President Trump’s statements, and what’s remarkable is that now there is a “segment of the population that is not moved by politicians that deny things that they can see with their own eyes.” The Washington Post fact checkers reported that in a single day, September 7, 2018, President Trump “publicly made 125 false or misleading statements—in a period of time that totaled only about 120 minutes.

He is not merely making gaffes or misstating things, he is purposely injecting false information into the national conversation. To accurately reflect this phenomenon, The Washington Post Fact Checker is introducing a new category —the Bottomless Pinocchio. That dubious distinction will be awarded to politicians who repeat a false claim so many times that they are, in effect, engaging in campaigns of disinformation.41\n\nThe paper has given the Bottomless Pinocchio to Trump for his false claims about the U.S. trade deficit, his tax cuts, the border wall, the U.S. economy, NATO, drug trafficking and the Mueller Special Counsel investigations, among many others.42 There have been so many lies during the Trump presidency that space limits the ability to list them. The Washington Post reports that “As of June 7, [2019] his 869th day in office, the president has made 10,796 false or misleading claims. …”.43 This tally of lies goes up on a nearly daily basis. But here is a representative sample of some of the biggest whoppers from the mountebank-in-chief. One genre of Trump lies are lies about the state of the economy. This is one of the most puzzling things that he misrepresents, because during the first two years of his presidency, the economy by objective measures was doing reasonably well.44 But by lying about the economy, he puts other statements about basic facts and mathematics in doubt.

By just about any important measure, the economy today is not doing as well as it did under Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton — and Ulysses S. Grant.47\n\nRelatedly, President Trump lies about the unemployment rate as well: he has falsely claimed that “‘[u]nemployment is at historic lows.’” But the Washington Post noted that this is “[f]alse. The unemployment rate, currently 3.9 percent, is low but it is not historic.”48 President Trump also lies about his own standing in the world. When he claimed, “We’re respected again as a nation[,]’”49 the fact checkers at the Washington Post responded thusly: “False. Polls by Gallup and the Pew Global Attitudes Project show worldwide views of the United States and its president have become more negative since Trump took office.”50 When addressing the U.N. General Assembly in 2018, other world leaders showed how little they respected him. President Trump bragged to the U.N. that his administration “has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country.” The response from the assembled group of dignitaries was to break into a gale of laughter. “So true,” he said; and when he heard the laughter, he responded, “I didn’t expect that reaction.”51 While he has been under investigation, President Trump has lied about the Special Counsel’s Office, the Justice Department and the FBI.52 One of his classic moves is to call the investigation into Russia and his campaign a “witch 45 Kavanagh & Rich, supra note 9 (“Truth Decay [includes] a blurring of the line between opinion and fact in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish between the two …”). 46 Kessler, et al., supra note 40. 47 Glenn Kessler, Anatomy of a Trump rally: 70 percent of claims are false, misleading or lacking evidence, Wash.

As the former head of the FBI, James Comey, testified to a House Committee in December of 2018: Comey: [There have been lies from] the President and his supporters about the nature and quality of the Department of Justice and the FBI. It’s shortsighted and anybody who knows those organizations knows it’s not true. Nadler: And what implications might there be under the Justice Department and the rule of law? Comey: Those kind of lies hurt the ability of the FBI to be believed at a doorway or in a courtroom. That makes all of us less safe. These are honest institutions made up of normal flawed human beings, but people committed to doing things the right way. When they’re lied about constantly, it hurts the faith and confidence of the American people in them, and that is bad for all of us. I don’t care what your political stripe is.”55 Nadler: And how does that impact our national security? Comey: Our national security turns upon the ability of an FBI agent to convince the girlfriend of a jihadi that we will protect her if she cooperates with us. If we’re seen as a political group of one kind or another, an untrustworthy group, that trust is eroded and the agent loses the ability to make that case. If a jury doesn’t believe an FBI agent when he or she says, “I found this” or “I heard this “in the course of this case, we’re less safe because the case can’t be made.56 … [W]hen people veer from truth-seeking into trying to find any excuse to bad-mouth an organization that’s investigating the President, we’ve lost our way.57\n\nWhile the Washington Post has been keeping track of these false and misleading statements from President Trump, the paper’s fact checkers have been very reluctant to call particular statements from him actual “lies.” The New York Times had already crossed that Rubicon during the 2016 election.

The backstory of what he was admitting to involved facilitating payments to a porn star with the stage name Stormy Daniels to remain silent during the 2016 election about an affair she allegedly had with Donald Trump years before. Because the payment was to help a federal candidate during a federal election, and because the candidate allegedly directed the payment, it was considered an “in-kind” campaign donation to the Trump campaign. One legal problem about this payment of $130 000 to Stormy Daniels for her silence was that it was too big. The contribution limit at the time was $2700. Another violation of campaign finance law was that the payment wasn’t reported properly.59 Once all of this came to light when Cohen pleaded guilty of violating campaign finance laws in open court in August of 2018, the Washington Post put out a rare article calling Trump’s denials around the Stormy Daniels payments a bold-faced “lie.”60 As Glenn Kessler wrote: “What we know now: Every answer was false. Trump knew about the payment, he knew Cohen made the payment as part of an effort to kill damaging stories, and he knew Cohen was reimbursed.”61 This confession by Cohen also implicates the possible guilt of the president, who many deem to be an unindicted co-conspirator to Cohen’s campaign finance crimes.62 Incidentally, Michael Cohen’s sentencing memorandum filed by the Southern District of New York on December 7, 2018 explained how Cohen first became Trump’s attorney. Cohen lived in a condominium in a Trump-branded building. The condo board was going to rename the building or at least drop the Trump name. Cohen intervened to stop the rebranding of the building. Trump was so appreciative of Cohen’s help in this matter that he hired Cohen to work for the Trump Organization as an executive vice president and special counsel.63 Cohen worked for Trump for a dozen years, right up to the year he\n\nutive editor [said] ‘But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies.’”). 59 Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Why the U.S. Has the Campaign Finance Laws That Michael Cohen Broke and What Their History Means for Trump, Time (Aug. 23, 2018), http://​time​.com/​5376715/​campaign​-finance​-laws​-trump/​. 60 Glenn Kessler, Not just misleading.

Without Trump’s love of his own brand, Cohen would not have been his lawyer. As the Washington Post continues to fact check President Trump, “Trumpian” is becoming a synonym for lying. For instance, the paper used the new word in a sentence: “Trump’s tsunami of untruths helped push the count in The Fact Checker’s database past 5,000 on the 601st day of his presidency. That’s an average of 8.3 Trumpian claims a day. . .”64 And the average only went up the following year to 15 Trumpian lies per day.65 It’s not just the Washington Post that fact checks Trump. This has become standard practice for all sorts of sources—from the Art Institute of Chicago, which notes that a Renoir painting President Trump claims is the genuine article is a really a fake;66 to Golf Magazine, which questions whether he has won any of the golf tournaments he has claimed to win;67 to Gold Star families, which have had a service member die who were never contacted by the president, when he claimed he had contacted them all.68 In the fall of 2018, the New York Times caught President Trump in a particularly juicy lie about himself.69 For decades, Trump had claimed to journalists and in his autographical books that he was a “self-made” man.70 He claimed that he had received a single $1 million loan from his father, which he repaid and then parlayed into a billion-dollar enterprise.71 The New York Times exposé showed that Trump’s father Fred had given his son closer to $60 million and had repeatedly bailed him out when the younger Trump ran a business into the\n\nKessler, et al., supra note 40.

In a particularly odd bailout, Fred Trump apparently rescued one of his son’s casinos, called the Trump Castle, from ruin by buying $3.35 million in casino chips and then never cashing them back in at the casino.72 As the authors said: The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father’s real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.73\n\nWhen asked about the myth of President Trump being a “self-made” man, Susanne Craig (one of the authors of the New York Times investigation) said flatly, “it’s a lie.”74 And notably, it’s a lie that he has told most of his adult life, including during his run for president. Ms. Craig told Terry Gross of NPR: It’s interesting … the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history becomes fact. And I think that we’ve reset that.

I worry about that. They’ve suffered information annihilation, and they’re tired. This is what happens in Russia. It leads to political apathy.”78\n\n3.\n\nTHE SUPREME COURT WON’T SAVE US FROM LIARS\n\nWhat President Trump counts on when he is rebranding the truth to include myth, lies and conspiracy theories is that “the public is enormously gullible at times.”79 Perhaps because of this gullibility, journalist Walter Lippmann argued that freedom of speech should not cover mendacity. As Lippmann wrote in The Public Philosophy: If there is a dividing line between liberty and license, it is where freedom of speech is no longer respected as a procedure of the truth and becomes the unrestricted right to exploit the ignorance, and to incite the passions, of the people. Then freedom is such a hullabaloo of sophistry, propaganda, special pleading, lobbying, and salesmanship that it is difficult to remember why freedom of speech is worth the pain and trouble of defending it. … It is sophistry to pretend that in a free country a man has some sort inalienable right to deceive his fellow men. There is no more right to deceive than there is a right to swindle, to cheat, or to pick pockets.80 But the current Supreme Court (headed by Chief Justice Roberts) has adamantly disagreed with Lippmann’s framing of this issue. Much to the chagrin of many a litigant seeking truth, the Supreme Court has protected the right to lie in many circumstances, including in elections. As was previewed in the introduction to this book, facts matter surprisingly little in elections—in part because many voters are voting for emotional, instinctual reasons.81 Kavanagh & Rich, supra note 9 (“Facts and data have become more important in most other fields, with political and civil discourse being striking exceptions”). 78 Denise Clifton, Russia’s Campaign to Help Trump Win Was Just the Start And the next attack on US elections, warns former FBI agent Clint Watts, could come from within, Mother Jones (May 23, 2018). 79 Packard, supra note 2, at 216 (quoting The Public Relations Journal). 80 Spero, supra note 20, at 1 (quoting Walter Lippmann’s The Public Philosophy). 81 Drew Westen, The Political Brain: The Role of Emotion in Deciding the Fate of the Nation ix (2007) (“the vision of mind that has captured the imagination of philosophers, cognitive scientists, economists, and political scientists since the eighteenth century—a dispassionate mind that makes decision by weighing the evidence and reasoning to the most valid conclusions—bears no relation to how the mind and brain actually work.”). 77\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nBranding truth\n\n33\n\nSo, isn’t lying illegal? Lying is illegal in certain confined circumstances. When an individual is under oath, it is illegal to lie. It is also illegal to lie to federal law enforcement, like the FBI, or to lie in documents that are being filed with the federal government under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Lying about private persons, if the lie is outrageous enough to damage their reputation, can be slander. If the lie about the private person is in writing, that is potentially libel.82 But when the target of the lie is a public figure, a whole different line of legal precedent applies.83 Good luck trying to prove that a particular published article about a public figure was committed with the requisite malice to be libelous under controlling U.S. Supreme Court First Amendment doctrine.84 Under the law of libel, an injured private citizen can sue for money damages in tort against a person who has spread injurious lies about him or her. Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. explains, in part, why America has libel laws: The legitimate state interest underlying the law of libel is the compensation of individuals for the harm inflicted on them by defamatory falsehood. … [T]he individual’s right to the protection of his own good name ‘reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being.’”85\n\nThe law of libel provides public figures with fewer protections against personally damaging lies. Gertz noted the difference between the rights of private and public figures: The communications media are entitled to act on the assumption that public officials and public figures have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood concerning them. No such assumption is justified with respect to a private individual. … He has relinquished no part of his interest in the protection of his own good name, and consequently he has a more compelling call on the courts for redress of injury inflicted by defamatory falsehood. Thus, private\n\n82 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 269 (1964) (“libel can claim no talismanic immunity from constitutional limitations. It must be measured by standards that satisfy the First Amendment.”). 83 Id. at 279 (“A rule compelling the critic of official conduct to guarantee the truth of all his factual assertions—and to do so on pain of libel judgments virtually unlimited in amount—leads to a comparable ‘self-censorship.’ Allowance of the defense of truth, with the burden of proving it on the defendant, does not mean that only false speech will be deterred.”). 84 Id. at 279–80 (“The constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with ‘actual malice’—that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.”). 85 Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 341 (1974).\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nPolitical brands\n\n34\n\nindividuals are not only more vulnerable to injury than public officials and public figures; they are also more deserving of recovery.86\n\nFor public figures, recovering for libel is nearly impossible unless they can meet the high hurdle of proving actual malice on the part of the person spreading slanderous lies under New York Times v. Sullivan. Yet the law of libel can leave some reputations forever in tatters. As Justice Stewart noted, “[t]he destruction that defamatory falsehood can bring is … often beyond the capacity of the law to redeem.”87 Indeed, the Supreme Court gives Americans wide latitude to lie even when the topic is something serious, like military service. The Supreme Court, in a 2012 case called U.S. v. Alvarez, allowed a man to pretend he was a decorated veteran. As Justice Kennedy wrote for the Supreme Court in his Alvarez opinion: Lying was his habit. Xavier Alvarez … lied when he said that he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from Mexico. But when he lied in announcing he held the Congressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new ground; for that lie violates a federal criminal statute, the Stolen Valor Act of 2005.88\n\nThe Stolen Valor Act was meant to protect the integrity of the award of military honors.89 Because someone who is perceived to be a war hero may be lauded with praise, jobs and money, the law is intended to allow only individuals who have actually earned those military honors to claim those plaudits. Thus, the Stolen Valor Act makes lying about getting military honors a crime—or it at least it did until the Supreme Court stepped in. The Supreme Court considered the Stolen Valor Act to be a content-based restriction on free speech. This type of law is nearly universally held by the federal courts to violate the First Amendment.90 As the Court explained in Alvarez: The Government contends the criminal prohibition is a proper means to further its purpose in creating and awarding the Medal [of Honor]. When content-based speech Id. at 345. Rosenblatt v. Baer, 383 U.S. 75, 92 (1966) (Stewart, J., concurring). 88 U.S. v. Alvarez, 567 U.S. 709, 713 (2012). 89 18 U.S.C. §704. 90 Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 828–29 (1995): Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional. … When the government targets not subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant. 86 87\n\nCiara Torres-Spelliscy - 9781789901825\n\nBranding truth\n\n35\n\nregulation is in question, however, exacting scrutiny is required. Statutes suppressing or restricting speech must be judged by the sometimes inconvenient principles of the First Amendment.91\n\nContent-based restrictions typically fall on hostile ears at the Supreme Court, as they did in Alvarez. As the Court wrote: as a general matter, the First Amendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its co"
