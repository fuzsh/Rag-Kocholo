If you would like to see this specific post, simply delete _v1 from the URL.\n\nXerox, The Very, Very, Very Shiny Company\n\nWhatever you do, whether it’s today or 1994, please do not call Xerox “the copier company”. Actually, don’t call it “The Document Company” anymore either. While you are at it, don’t confuse Fuji with Xerox, or wonder if the two merged. And, finally, please forget about that pixelated X that became one of the best known and widely recognized icons. All that is a thing of the past. Yes, just the past four decades. Poor Xerox, so misunderstood, so verbalized — “Can you xerox this for me? Thanks intern” — so outdated. Yet, if you worked anywhere with one of those multi-tasking, short of coffee-making machines, you know that Xerox can do more (way more) than make black and white copies of your spreadsheets. Yet, apparently, few people realize this. And nothing cures ailments like these better than a rebranding. Unveiled today, the new identity, designed by Interbrand, for Xerox may signal a new era for the company but, as far as we designers are concerned, it merely signals the full embrace of the senseless threedimensionalization of the corporate world.\n\nIf you can stomach a little press-releasing, here is some:\n\nThe new Xerox logo is now a lowercase treatment of the Xerox name — in a vibrant red — alongside a sphere-shaped symbol sketched with lines that link to form an illustrative “X,” representing Xerox’s connections to its customers, partners, industry and innovation, and designed to be more effectively animated for use in multi-media platforms.\n\n— Official press release\n\nSignaling a clear change and evoking a dramatic shift in the world’s perception of this iconic brand, the visual and verbal identity system for Xerox has undergone a massive redesign. The new signature incorporates a lowercase treatment of the Xerox name — in a vivid red Pantone 1797 — alongside a sphere sketched with lines, called “connectors,” that link to form an “X”, representing the company’s connections to its customers, employees, partners, industry and innovation. The “connectors” are super-graphics that appear as reoccurring design elements.\n\n— Interbrand project description\n\n“The Internet, sponsorships, all kinds of 3D icons — none of that existed when Xerox adopted its old logo,” said Maryann J. Stump, senior director of brand strategy for Interbrand. “And you can do animation with a symbol that you just can’t do with a wordmark.”\n\n— Article on The New York Times\n\nI find it rather humorous — and please excuse me while I get my biggest gripe out of the way — that this logo “animates” better and how it’s a key strength. Yet, the best that could be done (at least at launch) is this? Seriously?\n\nError text.\n\nPlease excuse the hypnotic looping animation. The original movie is too big and when reduced the controller goes away. You can see the full-size animation here.\n\nWhy is that marble not rotating? Or exploding? Or building out of thin air? Heck, morphing into Xerox’s CEO would be more interesting than a pedestrian zoom and shine. Sigh. But I digress. Let’s focus on the evolution of this mark for a little bit:\n\nIn 1961 Lippincott designed the original logo for Xerox after the company had dropped its “Haloid” half.\n\nSeven years later, in 1961, Chermayeff & Geismar updated the wordmark.\n\nAnd it wasn’t until 1994 that the logo changed to red and the digitized X was introduced by Landor.\n\nThis is also when “The Document Company” appeared, taking completely over the wordmark — people also answered the phone by saying “The Document Company, Xerox”.\n\nIn 2002, the wordmark became the more prominent visual. Later, in 2004, “The Document Company” disappeared.\n\nAnd now, we have this.\n\nContrary to other logos, like AT&T or UPS, the old Xerox wordmark was not necessarily good or looked as a paragon of our profession, so its demise is not mourned. The short-lived digitized X on the other hand was incredibly communicative and expressive of the place that Xerox occupied at the moment — bridging new and old technologies and processes — but at the same time, despite nostalgia, the pixelation effect was probably as clichéd then as these electric bugaloos are today. The Xerox wordmark was in serious need of an update and, letter for letter (except for the “r”), this new wordmark does an amazing job. Those “x”s are to die for. A wise move would have been to simply move forward with the wordmark, placing emphasis and importance on the word Xerox, which has plenty of equity. But instead we had to be graced with the introduction of this furious marble that is downright abominable and meaningless but come to think of it, it does take my mind off of “the copier company”. Just not with good thoughts.\n\nConspiracy Theory No. 1: Kodak + Xbox 360 + X-MEN III.\n\nJump to Most Recent Comment\n\nGlenn’s comment is:\n\nFist thing I saw was the Kodak logo...\n\ntwoeightnine’s comment is:\n\nAll I think of is an electronics store. Circuit City or CompUSA.\n\nBart O'Dell’s comment is:\n\nDear lord no.\n\nJonSel’s comment is:\n\nWow...I can't for the life of me figure out why they need a symbol. I agree that they need to do some major education concerning their market position, but what does this symbol add? The new wordmark is nice and contemporary. That whole criss-crossing patterning would serve much better as part of a visual language, anchored by the wordmark.\n\nDmitriy Yermolov’s comment is:\n\nlooks like someone's a wollieolins wannabe outhere)kinda lame attempt to fuse kodak and sony-ericsson, obvious fuckup +1\n\nK. West’s comment is:\n\nDo they not realize that they have the LETTER X in their name TWICE?! The single most graphics-ready symbol in the alphabet?! If I had that I would lean on it like a wall.\n\nI liked the pixelated X too. I think they should've started with that and updated accordingly.\n\nJon Whipple’s comment is:\n\nWow. I am rendered almost speechless. But I'll try to say:\n\nAn X-Men costume! On A cough drop! Cool!\n\nYeah, when I think Cherry Cough Drops I sure think Xerox. Or is it the other way around?\n\nI'll grant that in the markets in which they compete they're mark will sure stand out. But I doubt it will be in a good way.\n\nMichael Bierut’s comment is:\n\nI wish I were dead.\n\nJulio’s comment is:\n\nMy gut reaction was, simply: this gives branding a bad name, and drags us all down with it. Given Xerox's high profile, I almost fear that people out there will see this and assume this is what I do for a living when I say I'm a graphic designer that focuses on identity. At least with the recent rebrandings of UPS and AT&T (as much as I disliked them), you could find a thread of logic in their execution: the new marks resembled the old. Sure, the new ones were strange, bubbly badges carrying the unfortunate debris of trendy, marketing-savvy, web 2.0 design aesthetics, but at least some remnants of the previous brand remained. But this? Where does this marble come from? This is what 5,000 interviews and 24 months of work gets you? A completely new, unnecessary, poorly-crafted element that builds on none of the existing strengths of the brand for the sake of asserting itself into the world? Welcome to the time of full embrace of senseless, threedimensional corporate branding, indeed...\n\nFernando Lins’s comment is:\n\nI had some hope that the glows and globes and gradients in branding would be left behind with 2007 altogether... big mistake. BIG mistake.\n\nUnit B’s comment is:\n\nGreat word mark, and the X's really grab your attention. In fact, because the name Xerox is bracketed by those X's, the name alone serves as the symbol. The icon looks like it belongs on a really lame superhero comic book. Oh, sorry–I mean graphic novel.\n\nAdrian’s comment is:\n\nWow...that looks so cheap! I loved the pixel-X, but perhaps that's just sentimental value (aaah to be an intern, xeroxing away...).\n\nShame. I notice there's a lot of ugly logos coming out lately, what's up with that?\n\nNadia’s comment is:\n\nI understand the lower case treatment but fail to associate with the ball. What does the ball mean? Are they better positioned now?\n\nSaawan’s comment is:\n\nThe conspiracy theory is very thought-provoking and funny at the same time. Xerox has become synonymous to photocopy in India! (I donno about the world). I doubt most of the people here know that there's a company called Xerox!\n\nTheUprock!’s comment is:\n\nI'm okay with the logotype. I don't necessarily LIKE it, but I can live with it -- it has a look and feel similar to a lot of branding trends right now, and I can somewhat empathize with why Xerox (or is it all-lowercase now, huh?) would want to try to copy after the industry. What I really don't get is the mark. It says nothing to me about what they do, or their vibrant history as a copy, fax, computing company.\n\nI agree with Julio -- this makes a lot of people look bad.\n\nSaawan’s comment is:\n\nThe conspiracy theory is very thought-provoking and funny at the same time. Xerox has become synonymous to photocopy in India! (I donno about the world). I doubt most of the people here know that there's a company called Xerox!\n\nDamian Cugley’s comment is:\n\nMy first thought on seeing the new design is that a red ball with a white X on it has been used by Microsoft to decorate error messages for the last decade or so...\n\nVon Glitschka’s comment is:\n\nLooks like they fudged on this \"Marble Brand.\"\n\nJon’s comment is:\n\nI really liked the old logo. Maybe it could have used and update, but they definitely went in the wrong direction. I think the worst change is the switch to lower case.\n\nThe old logo is so clean, and to me just says \"This is serious. Let's get down to business.\" Unless they're planning on focusing on the consumer market in the future, the new one is too friendly and too generic. They needed a little more IBM, and a little less kodak.\n\nOn second thought, without the marble it aint that bad.\n\nChristian Palino’s comment is:\n\nThere is no excuse for this – Xerox likely has enough foresight to recognize that their longterm corporate growth is not dependent on flash-in-the-pan trends but rather in well conceived strategies that will provide over the long haul. The blame is likely with Interbrand's keen ability to sell this kind of solution as timeless rather than what it is.\n\n…alongside a sphere sketched with lines, called \"connectors,\" that link to form an \"X\", representing the company's connections to its customers, employees, partners, industry and innovation. The \"connectors\" are super-graphics that appear as reoccurring design elements.\n\nVery poor rationale. super-graphics? super-outdated-trendy-nonsense maybe.\n\nBlake’s comment is:\n\nThis really blows. I'm so disappointed in the apparent trend large corporations THINK they have to follow. Complete gradient/3D bs.\n\nArmin’s comment is:\n\n> Very poor rationale. super-graphics? super-outdated-trendy-nonsense maybe.\n\nNot to defend Interbrand's mumbo jumbo, but \"super graphics\" is a funny term that is used for anything that is plastered big in a physical space. This is an \"artist's rendering\" that was posted at BusinessWeek, and those swirly panels is what I think they mean by super-graphics. Either that, or they just think their graphics are, indeed, super.\n\nChristian Palino’s comment is:\n\nTheir use of \"super-graphics\" was clear – mine was just a play on words ;)\n\nI like their use of the flag element!\n\nAlex Burr’s comment is:\n\nAs a former Xerox employee, I gotta say a heartfelt BLEAH. This looks to me like 1. An attempt to mimic Kodak (another six-letter nonsense word, and the other big corporate entity in Rochester) and 2. An attempt to look \"hip\", something which Xerox will never be.\n\nHugh’s comment is:\n\nI think the type is quite nice... But the symbol? >_\n\nKeith’s comment is:\n\nThe symbol looks like a bandage on a really nasty boil. Yuck!\n\nC-Lo’s comment is:\n\nI enjoy the type MUCH more then that web 2.0 malarkey marble. Imagine Microsoft using their start button as their logo. No way, and that is how the X logo relates to me. I would like to see an uppercase R however. I was never a fan of those half n's. The rest of the letters do show a sense of technological superiority even if its' relying on that aspect like an intern relying on Helvetica to show a sense of sophistication for a logo.\n\nformsubstance’s comment is:\n\nI did work for corporate HR at Xerox and everything seemed to be stalled waiting for this new rebranding. A year and a half later I had totally forgotten until I saw this. I guess they still haven't figured it out.\n\ndiane zerr’s comment is:\n\nI'm completely confused, after reading the case study on Interbrand's website\n\n\"A palette of eight new colors support the brand. A new illustration style using silhouetted graphics, contemporary photography, and the “connectors” against a white background add to the brand’s new look. The illustration style can adapt to the color palette, and the three-dimensional sphere is used across multi-media. The new proprietary font - called Xerox Sans - is a modern style that visually communicates the openness and approachable nature of the company.\"\n\nSo they come up with this 3-D logo and then they are going to incorporate an illustration style, what style is that? And how does that manage to work well with this style logo? If they are referring to the wavy lines used on their website, I hardly call that illustration style.\n\nDave Klonke’s comment is:\n\nCitizen Bank + bocce balls. I think the typeface is great! It does look very similar to Kodak, though. This marble trend (great animation, Von!) is wearing thin.\n\nkenny eicher’s comment is:\n\nSo, how much $$ did they pay for this?\n\nMoriarty’s comment is:\n\nWhilst I always loved the old pixelated 'X' I understand why it was dropped but the type after that was always quite ugly, the new type however is really quite nice (and a nice red) but the marble is bloody horrible. The marble makes it all look really cheap and nasty – and I'm not sure that it's even needed (any mark at all) with the new type treatment…\n\nTy’s comment is:\n\nAbsolutely pathetic.\n\nPrescott Perez-Fox’s comment is:\n\nDitch the ball and the world can rest at ease.\n\nI do, of course, love the word \"threedimensionalization\", great neologism! Thank you Armin for taking another stab at the great institution that is the Press Release. I'm right behind you.\n\nAllan’s comment is:\n\nThe marble is almost exactly the same as this.\n\nWillis’s comment is:\n\nThe new logo looks like a bocce ball the factory messed up.\n\nIt's not helped by the fact that, should that object exist in actual three dimensions, the \"super-connector\" criss-cross lines would be completely lopsided and awkward-looking.\n\nIs there a two-color version?\n\nThe old pixel-X was fantastic - easy to recognize, conveyed rather complex meaning, and easy to represent.\n\nJohn McCollum’s comment is:\n\nOy.\n\nI agree with pretty much everyone else -- the symbol sucks. It almost seems like the wordmark was developed, and then some executive said, \"We're paying $XXX,XXX for this rebranding and all we get is the name typed out in Arial?\"\n\nA company as big as Xerox should be confident enough to not need shiny baubles and gewgaws.\n\nBut If they wanted to do something \"cooler\" than just a wordmark, they could have tried something clever like an ambigram. Those two Xs are almost begging to be highlighted somehow.\n\nAgain, I say, \"Oy.\"\n\nMatheus’s comment is:\n\nxerox doesnt need branding\n\nthe name itself its the biggest brand it will get\n\n\"Do me a xerox\" says everything\n\nit turned up into a substantive\n\nsubstantives doesnt need new branding\n\nJohn McCollum’s comment is:\n\nOy.\n\nI agree with pretty much everyone else -- the symbol sucks.

The ball does absolutely nothing for me, but agreed, the type is a vast improvement.\n\nXerox Logo Rebranding\n\nBjorn Yeo’s comment is:\n\nSome brands need only realignment. Not rebranding. Nike is one of them. 3M as well. And so is Xerox.\n\nMatt Hunsberger’s comment is:\n\nWasn't the pixelated X really trendy when it came out in '94? I really like the wordmark, but I wish brands weren't so afraid of capital letters these days...\n\nPaul Riehle’s comment is:\n\nsure it's a horrible direction, but atleast make the sphere look somewhat appealing if you go in the 3rd dimension. The x is all off balance and just makes it seem like interbrand doesn't know how to draw in perspective.\n\nPaul Riehle’s comment is:\n\nsure it's a horrible direction, but atleast make the sphere look somewhat appealing if you go in the 3rd dimension.

I am a modern and approachable font (yes, they referred to it as a FONT). My rounded corners make me more human and less technical.”\n\nSo is it Xerox Sans or is it Albert, and why did you send out a press release saying it wasn't proprietary and now it is?\n\nAnd why is the \"X\" not truly an \"X\" in perspective? And why is it on a bouncy ball? I hate this more than 2012 I think. Suck it Interbrand and suck it hard. Suck it with a dropshadow, like you put on most of your other logos, especially the ones you do under the name of BrandWizard. The Wizard of Brands.

Neither one has become synonymous in the vernacular with its core product (Kleenex, Popsicle.)\n\nBy using the lower-case in their treatment, they are reinforcing the name as verb, instead of as noun.

Our company (Interbrand) designed that one too. It is a non-issue that it reminds you of the sony ericsson brandmark, or the 360 brandmark for that matter, since they are two different categories. But it does have the \"tech\" feel, which is a good thing for xerox. The old one did feel dated. Every new logo that comes out gets dinged by people. Look at the reaction to the new at&t logo http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/002478.html\n\nOne thing to consider though, as I have seen all the concepts of both the at&t logo and the xerox logos that were presented to clients, is that the client will pick what they like, and have you tweak it, combine it with another concept, and tweak it some more. It is just the way the industry is set up. Not much you can do about it. Personally, I think there were better options for both brandmarks, but I'm just a designer, not the client. \"\n\nAttitude seems to be good or bad - the logo will get 'dinged' so why bother?\n\nSi Daniels\n\nLead PM for fonts, Microsoft typography\n\nJung’s comment is:\n\njust shoot me\n\nJoachim’s comment is:\n\nInterbrand's laughing their way to the bank.\n\nMy biggest gripe is not just seeing at&t the moment I saw this brand, but how they added that stupid marble.

Next, we'll add 3D effects because it'll look stupid without it in animation.\"\n\nHell, it doesn't even look like a sphere.

The thing is, I'm okay with the type. I'm not jumping for joy or anything, but I'm okay with it. It's modern and sleek, and I think most people can live with it just fine.\n\nAs for the mark. Well, the mark leaves much to be desired. It still needs a bit of work on the psuedo-dimensionality aspect. Oddly enough, I was just checking out the Super Smash Bros Brawl website and noticed the logo they've been using for all of their Smash Bros games: that meaningless sphere with the x through it. See below:\n\nDarrin Crescenzi’s comment is:\n\nDoes the ball look like it sits ever-so-slightly too low next to the wordmark?\n\nWhat makes this so dreadful, above and beyond the whole glowing-orb-marble-sphere trend, is just how wildly off-balance and impossibly constructed the symbol is. And the highlights/shadows are completely non-sensical. Say what you will about the X-Box, at&t and Sony Ericsson spheres, but at least they're fun to look at and there is some technical execution backing them, no matter how trite it may be. They beg to be bounced. This one is just completely lacking in redeeming qualities.

They're as synonomous as Kleenex is to tissue, FedEx as to overnight delivery!\n\nThey obviously come off as the followers rather than the leader.\n\nOpportunity missed!\n\nThe sphere, marble or whatever you call it is just as formula as the next reality series.\n\nEnough is enough and it's about time that companies start thinking on their own and leading by example.\n\nI'm surprised that Xerox would not think outside of the\n\n\"ball\":-P!!!\n\nObviously their not as forward thinking as other companies.\n\nCan you say Apple Inc?\n\nMR’s comment is:\n\nIf this logo were a child, I would spank it and send it to bed without dinner.\n\nJA’s comment is:\n\nHey K2!

What fit very well for the Xbox brand, is a bit strange for Sony-Ericsson but its ok because they want to be a 'fun' compagny (see adds) become very strange for a name like Xerox. its like every one wants to look like a Game developer compagny, or a some geek web 2.0 stuff.\n\nWhat is funny is that in the Web 2.0 sphere you don't see much 3D logo, it's more used by old compagny that try to look fresh.\n\nBut for me Xerox endorsing this trends is like my old grand father buying a skateboard and deseperetly tryin to look young.\n\nJonathan Salem Baskin’s comment is:\n\nXerox has been reinventing its business for the past few years using THE OLD LOGO, so what does branding imagery have to do with business reality? To pay gurus what was probably a load of cash to invent a bunch of generic, feel-good attributes that Xerox will have to pay loads more cash to try to drill into our minds...instead of simply focusing its efforts on creating further products and services that differentiate it...is just, well, branding nonsense. Now the company has a logo that it can't 'own' (lower case font and spheres are not terribly unique, as other posts have pointed out), it has jettisoned any recognition or association anybody had for its logo (being a verb and linked to something tangible like 'copying' wasn't such a bad thing, I'd suggest), and it's going to flush money down the toilet to celebrate this business brilliance. I've written about what Xerox COULD have done in some detail at DIM BULB, if you'd care to check it out: http://dimbulb.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/01/of-balls-and-ba.html\n\nRay ’s comment is:\n\ngradients are the new comic sans\n\nOliver Nielsen’s comment is:\n\nI like it. And apparantly it makes you all talk like crazy chickens. So, apparantly it works. Graphics nerds;-)\n\nPeter Whitley’s comment is:\n\nThis is good news for designers everywhere as Xerox will surely be in the market for a facelift in a few years.\n\n(I didn't pay any attention to Xerox before their new logo and I certainly won't pay any attention now. The world is full of marks that don't speak to me. I'm neither surprised nor depressed.)\n\nTravis Cain’s comment is:\n\nInterbrand is making the movie Idiocracy come true one brand at a time.\n\nStardust’s comment is:\n\nBlech! I think they copied off iHop. IHOP's logo has lower case font and a little round stack of pancakes next to it with the syrup dripping off of it in a X formation.\n\nJoe Natoli’s comment is:\n\nI am absolutely, unequivocally SHOCKED that this glossy web 2.0 wannabe trendsetting piece of utter garbage came from Interbrand. What a NON-statement. Major step backward in brand equity and the message of strength and reliability the Xerox brand is synonymous with. Candy-coated bullshit.\n\nAnonymous’s comment is:\n\nAll those others inspirations for the ball don't even come close,THIS is probably where they got the idea from(take a look at the number 3 ball)they were probably playing pool. :P\n\nMark’s comment is:\n\nAll those others inspirations for the ball don't even come close,THIS is probably where they got the idea from(take a look at the number 3 ball)they were probably playing pool. :P\n\nstefano picco’s comment is:\n\nI don't linke the new one, looks like a cheap web 2.0 logo :(\n\nPaul’s comment is:\n\nThe thing that bothers me the most about the new logo is that the perspective of the stripes on this red marble thing is either completely off, or Xerox decided to just throw two stripes on there randomly.\n\nIt's obvious the two stripes are not perpendicular, making a perfect X or cross. The lines cannot be straight on the surface of the marble with this perspective. It's like someone designed this '3D' logo by hand in illustrator with absolutely no reference in actual 3D software.\n\nJason parry’s comment is:\n\nxerox and kodak have always been in competition. Kodak comes out so xerox comes up with a meaningless 5-letter name that starts and ends with same letter. kodak redoes their brand in red lowercase san serif, xerox does the same.\n\nJw’s comment is:\n\nDamn those spheres! Damn them all to hell!\n\nIncidentally, the Michael Bierut attributed comment above (if Designer Observer rules apply here, it really was him) is effing hilarious.\n\nTom ’s comment is:\n\nWell here it is! Xerox designers could have told you a YEAR ago this was gonna be a WINNER. We could just tell when the Interbrand people showed up at our office looking like they just rolled up from a 24 hour RAVE in some back alley. It was easy to tell this was a FRONT BURNER project for Interbrand. Xerox paid big bucks for this..they got the money by laying off most of their own design department. I guess we should glad it is not a \"swoosh\"\n\nTodd Baer’s comment is:\n\nIt's too easy to critique a big target public corprate identity. Its far enough away that we can't get noticed for do so, we have all had contact with the organization and I have proffesional jealousy for not being picked to do the job.\n\nCorporate identity design for large consumer clients is difficult, approval committees and wide cultural acceptance kill the potency of graphics and concepts, the two qualities that make a corporate identity great.\n\nRemember the old AT&T mark by Saul Bass? As I understand it he was paid a lot at the time, showed one final design and that was it. Until it too was diluted into a translucent gel orb, on trucks, TV, uniforms, and print it worked great. It even looked good either in color or black & white. The graphic sphere became the flag for the company's ambition to serve a new digital and yet defined communications frontier.\n\nThe redesign of the AT&T's and the new xerox identity have similar liabilities: lack of graphic strength and a soft concept. Can the design process only work if lead by strong point of view from outside the organization's marketing committees and ad hoc \"new branding development team\"?\n\nLogoblink’s comment is:\n\nI think this change is not so bad and it's a very smooth move that they now got 2 figures to play with - the wordmark and the ball. We all can say \"I'll do it better\", but I bet we won't. I'm just curious to take a look of the variations that Interbrand offered to Xerox. I'm sure there should be some interesting stuff :))\n\nrdas7’s comment is:\n\nmy guess is that this is what the guy who designed to London 2012 Olympics logo went on to do...\n\nMark’s comment is:\n\nI saw a Xerox commercial repasted with the new logo.\n\nit was ok not great, but ok.\n\nall the logo did was zoom out to the center starting between the last X and the ball thing and after it settled in the the ball thing flashed, that's it that all it did.\n\nThis somehow seems \"OMG soooooo fricking awesome and innovative!!!!!!!\" to the company somehow.\n\nI expecting at least more like a swooshing effect with the lines creating the \"X\" of the ball (sort of like how the previous SBC logo formed at the end of their commercials,before they became the new AT&T) and then a separate animation for the red ball following that. At least some type of animation that would illustrate the connections concept they were talking about in the logo, at least something that would make me go \"Aha! now I understand what you were talking about! now I get it!\" nope. nothing. just a simple zoom and flash was all the offered. :P\n\nMark’s comment is:\n\nI saw a Xerox commercial repasted with the new logo.\n\nit was ok not great, but ok.\n\nAll the logo did was zoom out to the center starting between the last X and the ball thing and after it settled in, the the ball thing flashed, that's it that all it did.\n\nThis somehow seems \"OMG soooooo fricking awesome and innovative!!!!!!!\" to the company somehow.\n\nI was expecting at least more, like a swooshing effect with the lines creating the \"X\" of the ball (sort of like how the previous SBC logo formed at the end of their commercials,before they became the new AT&T) and then a separate animation for the red ball following that.

How on earth did we get here? It's almost beyond comment. Yes, the type is \"nice\" but is that all we have left? What the H has happened to ideas, craft, originality?\n\nI remember when Wolff Olins was pitching against Interbrand for this one (their pitch wiped the floor with what we see here) and when they lost it to I-brand, I knew at that moment that it was going to go this way. I mean what else would it be? It's yet another homogeneous, middle-of-the-road, formulaic, lick 'n stick solution.\n\nI can't help but see a parallel with the sorry state of politics, (and even that is changing!) Rushing towards the middle, chanting about change, running by research (polls) and, ultimately, settling back into same-old, same-old when the race is done.\n\nAs citizens, consumers, and yes, even designers, we are starving for smart, savvy, idea-driven, revolutionary \"brands\" (and leaders) and, instead, we witness endless regurgitating and riffing on old clichés and thinking.\n\nTell me, is there an Obama equivalent in big-business branding?\n\nI'd sure as heck vote for 'em!\n\nphilip bulley’s comment is:\n\nThis new logo bears a rather striking resemblance to the flag of Kyrgyzstan.Take a look:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Flag_of_Kyrgyzstan.svg\n\ni'm shocked, poor old Kyrgyzstan, i think xerox should provide the country for free with all A4 paper, copiers and fax machines they need for the duration of the logo's lifetime.\n\nScott Lerman’s comment is:\n\n\"The Document Company\" brand strategy was developed by Siegel & Gale and Jay Doblin & Associates. It was a well reasoned attempt to move XEROX beyond its copier roots. This was years before Landor developed the digital X mark.\n\nDiego’s comment is:\n\nToo late to go back? Traveler's did...\n\nD\n\nmax’s comment is:\n\nPain.\n\nKula bácsi’s comment is:\n\nLooks like a hemorrhoid with bandage.\n\nEve’s comment is:\n\nyou liked the pixelated \"x\"? really? liars.\n\ni agree with the comments that the new type is nice and the symbol is possibly unnecessary. however, it's a symbol that stands up against other contemporary marks. while we as snobby designers might not like this shift toward the shiny and 3D, there it is.\n\nJoe Moran’s comment is:\n\nLooks like Wrigley is eating this up! Literally. Wrigley 2.0, here we go.\n\nHo!\n\nVR/\n\nDonald’s comment is:\n\nThe designer didn't test this in Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa or the West Indies.\n\nIt's quite clearly a cricket ball!\n\ncatherine’s comment is:\n\nfirst at&t now xerox, marbellous!\n\noisín’s comment is:\n\nPanic Button? But Xeroxed!\n\nTom’s comment is:\n\nLooks like it came straight out of Logoworks... can't get more generic than that.\n\nBrian Maloney’s comment is:\n\nLike they couldn't just animate the pixelation on the X?\n\nArtspeak and Adspeak (and apparently Brandspeak) can justify anything after the fact.\n\nAs for the marble - the word cliché comes to mind.\n\nWhy is it that Board Room Execs - who are generally not hip - will buy into a \"Design Company\" description of what is hip? Talk about fleeting moments and passing Fashion Trends . . .\n\nPhil Belair’s comment is:\n\nI'm sad. Look what AT&T- I mean at&t started.\n\nTo me, it's all about MBA's hopping on the latest trend to reach the short term business goals. Recently Johnson Controls just lost control and switched to an ambiguous globe as well. I doubt if either logomark will have half of the staying power as the ones that preceded them. These are very similar solutions to sphere and globe icons found on those $50 overnight logo websites. The only true point of distinction is found in typographic relationships in wordmarks or type-based logos. Geez. Do we really have to draw a circle to say that we are global? (and have it in motion- (whoowhee!) Ever hear of Motion Typography?\n\nAmber Cordova’s comment is:\n\nQuite well stated Phil.\n\nThe semi-translucent orb depicts how the brand was injured repeatedly and now must be encircled in ace bandages while \"xerox\" bounces it around, hoping more people will find it friendly and want to play with it. The, \"Look at the shiny new object my branding company can give you\" approach apparently flys with the powers that be. What really impresses me is xerox paid a lot for this.\n\njustification for a design, in research and numbers does not = success. It = large fees and a feeling of security for the non-creatives that approve it.\n\nGoffredo Puccetti’s comment is:\n\nCheap pedestrian web 2.0 icon. Inexcusable poor design. It is one of the worst redesign I have ever seen.\n\nAnd the press release explaining it is mumbo jumbo!\n\nShame. Shame. Shame.\n\nAl Hood’s comment is:\n\nDesign is Dead...\n\nPhil Belair’s comment is:\n\nIt might be attractive to squirrels and misguided crows that like shiny objects.\n\nLadyN’s comment is:\n\nMarc Stress’s said: I'm sure this logo looks great when faxed... or copied...\n\nAAaaahahahahahahahahahahahahhHAHAHaahaha!!!\n\n*breathes* LOVE. IT.\n\nDan’s comment is:\n\nFrom another blog:\n\n\"No, it's not a joke. The are two possibilities now – the proud country of Kyrgyzstan will send the best lawyers on camels to file a lawsuit against Xerox for copyright and negligence and will be fighting it in courts ? Or Xerox can go one step further and pay the proud country of Kyrgyzstan an 'unspecified' amount to add Xerox name to the flag, thus becoming the 1st company to officially sponsor the country’s flag and saving lots of money on Olympic advertising – see every 2 years Xerox/Kyrgyz’s flag would be proudly displayed at the Winter / Summer Olympic games BTW – I accidentally came across this flag picture in a break-out area and at 1st thought it was a joke – but in reality it’s true.\" Igor – the friend of Kyrgyz people by association to former U.S.S.R.\n\nStephen’s comment is:\n\nXerox 2.0, did they come up with a new W3C spec sheet with that? I'm also surprised that the official press release doesn't believe in full stops.\n\nbrandy’s comment is:\n\nExcerpt from Wolff Olins' site…\n\nBeware the wolves in sheep’s clothing\n\nWith the launch this week of the new Xerox brand, we’re seeing the continuing trend of a B2B brand of stature borrowing the trappings of a B2C cousin, much like AT&T before it. And why not? Consumer brands are cool, dynamic, fun, and the really good ones create the kind of emotional attachment to their customers that’s really hard to compete against.\n\nIt’s a little unfortunate, then, that these B2B brands seem hell-bent on borrowing the wrong things. A friendly logo, a curvaceous typeface, the use of friendly language, and a library full of as many images of smiling friendly people as possible have become the oh-so-predictable signs of a formerly staid corporation undertaking a ‘transformation in customer-centricity’.\n\nNoah Venezia’s comment is:\n\nThere are some things on which one can not improve.\n\nS. Cullen’s comment is:\n\nDead-on comment award I think goes to twoeightnine (electronics store...circuit city..compusa) and jon whipple (cherry cough drops).\n\nRulf’s comment is:\n\nThe problem is Interbrand. These guys are as ignorant as they are arrogant. I remember an article in the Wall Street Journal where an Interbrand consultant pontificated about automotive logos. He didn't get a single information right about the logos' semantic or historic background. Regarding Xerox, they may have talked to 5,000 people (principally to shore up the time sheet), but they either didn't listen or didn't grasp what was said.\n\nWebdesign’s comment is:\n\nI'll stick with the consipiracy theory\n\nLuisfer’s comment is:\n\nRealmente si es cierto que han necesitado dos años para lanzar este logo , demuestran que son nefastos gestores y quizas esta sea la principal razón por el que la competencia les esta comiendo el mercado . Por otro lado no deja de ser una copia del logo de at^t , Xbox , Sarenet , a quien tratan de engañar , desde luego atacan a la inteligencia de los Clientes si piensan que éstos se van a dejar influenciar tan solo por este cambio , si éste no va acompañado de un verdadero giro en la gestión que realmente les tenga en cuenta .Señores las Empresas necesitan productos y servicios que esten respaldados por una marca que les escuche , de respuesta a sus requerimientos , y apoye adecuadamente la implantación de las soluciones contratadas , es decir que disponga de capital humano perfectamente integrado en esta filosofía ,cosa que desde hace al menos tres años se estan encargando de eliminar , la realidad es que el numero de empleados se ha reducido en un 50 % a nivel mundial . Por favor revisen sus estrategias si quieren perdurar.\n\nSaludos\n\nLuisfer\n\nBilbao-España\n\nEnergonCube’s comment is:\n\nThe name is the problem. Not the logo. If xerox doesn't want us to think of them as the \"copier company\" or \"the document company\" they're fighting a losing battle. There's simply too much equity behind the name. In essence, they've painted themselves into a corner.\n\nCould Kleenex change their logo to have us think of them as something other than facial tissue? Could Coke or McDonald's change theirs?\n\nNope.\n\nPaul Rand’s comment is:\n\nThe Xerox logo was created with shareware software that creates 3D gel icons. Here is the company that designed the new logo: http://iconbase.com\n\nXerox’s comment is:\n\nIt's change we can believe in.\n\nEd Phelps’s comment is:\n\nThis is what happens when thinking and problem solving are overcome by video game sensibilities.\n\nThe good news? Start lining up your pitch to redesign the next iteration. I give this 3 years tops.\n\nBorat’s comment is:\n\nVery nice. I like.\n\nfabyoolus’s comment is:\n\nI don't know whether to feel bad or surprised. Bad because this is the first thing I thought of, or surprised that nobody else has done it yet. Quick and dirty:\n\nMichael Gioia’s comment is:\n\nAdobe or somebody, I just need half a million to finish up on this morning's work.\n\nDel Shephard’s comment is:\n\nWhy not go the whole hog and change the company name? the logo stinks\n\nAnonymous’s comment is:\n\nfind it here it's the same logo\n\nhttp://www.tempo-textron.com/\n\nTaylor’s comment is:\n\nReminds me alot of SR Technic's logo\n\nTaylor’s comment is:\n\nforgot SR's logo\n\nhttp://www.srtechnics.com/datas/images/img_mediacenter_logos_2c300_gr.jpg\n\nanonymous’s comment is:\n\nOur logo was first.\n\npat Taylor’s comment is:\n\nCome on...GET REAL!\n\nJared’s comment is:\n\nOh to be a fly on the wall when decisions like these are being made. Too many years in the asylum has dulled their senses.\n\nUnReal’s comment is:\n\nWhoooooops!!\n\nLook at MSX International logo.....who copyrighted or cheated first??\n\nAnonymous’s comment is:\n\nok. For starters, everything has already been done. So, they couldn't have gone off and created something completely unique. I agree the word could have been just enough for the logo, but the sphere really does bring it up to date for all that they can do. The company does more than it used to and the sphere reflects that. The bolder red is great too.\n\nEmmaline’s comment is:\n\nHi all! The babes are here! This is my best site to visit. I make sure I am alone in case I get too hot.
