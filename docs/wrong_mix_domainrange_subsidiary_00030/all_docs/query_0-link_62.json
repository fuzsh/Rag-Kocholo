The editor wishes to acknowledge in particular the unusual amount of effort the authors expended in obtaining images and permissions for the book’s complex illustration program. Several anonymous readers offered invaluable critiques and timely advice on both the substance and the structure of the volume, while giving us the confidence to move forward. The University of Chicago Press has been unwavering in their support for this project, and its staff both collegial and professional at every turn. The enduring material and moral support of the Newberry Library, the host of the Nebenzahl Lectures since 1966, is foundational. Without this extraordinary community of creative librarians, curators, teachers, and readers dedicated to free inquiry in the humanities, there would be no Nebenzahl Lectures. In the autumn of 2016 the Nebenzahl Lectures celebrated their fiftieth anniversary. This collection is dedicated to Ken and Jossy Nebenzahl in honor of their kind and enduring sponsorship of this series and the scholarship it has promoted.\n\nvii\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nJames R. Akerman\n\nThe idea for the Seventeenth Kenneth Nebenzahl, Jr., Lectures in the History of Cartography (2010), “Mapping the Transition from Colony to Nation,” the basis for this book, emerged from the Fifteenth Nebenzahl Lectures, “The Imperial Map” (2004), published under the same name by the University of Chicago Press in 2009. The Imperial Map’s broad, if episodic, examination of how modern imperial powers used mapping to conquer and manage their colonies and to promote and affirm their imperial identities, as well as— somewhat antithetically— its contemplation of the limits of imperial mapping suggested an obvious counterpoint and successor. This volume publishes the result. At the simplest (and titular) level it considers the roles mapping has played in the passage from colony to nation— or, if you will, from dependent to independent state. The seven chapters all concern the engagement of mapping in the long and clearly unfinished process of decolonization and the parallel process of nation building from the late eighteenth century to the mid-twentieth century. A few scholars have addressed this issue. However, the subject has not been examined systematically or comprehensively. The first chapter, by Ray Craib, offers a wide-ranging introduction to the subject, identifying salient\n\n1\n\nfeatures of the relationship between mapping and decolonization, and placing them within the context of recent theoretical debates about the nature of decolonization itself. There follow seven case studies examining this relationship over more than two centuries and on three continents. Needless to say, this volume can only suggest the general contours of this vast subject and propose some of its historical problems and dilemmas. When I first conceived of this series I imagined that the papers would focus on twentieth-century mapping and would be associated primarily with African and Asian countries emerging from European imperialism. It soon became clear that the questions I wanted to ask of the mid-twentieth-century decolonization could not, or should not, be separated from the revolutions and emergent nationalisms of the nineteenth century. Indeed, the broad theme of decolonizing the map could easily have embraced accounts of mapping and its relationship to nineteenth-century nationalist movements for independence in Eastern Europe, and their echoes in post-Soviet times. In the end, the papers focus on Latin America, Africa, and Asia. I made a calculated decision as well— perhaps not theoretically defensible— to exclude America north of Mexico, already the subject in English of a large literature. There are other notable gaps and biases in chronological and geographic coverage— the former French colonies in Southeast Asia and Africa, for example, are not treated here, while former British and Spanish colonies are the subject of three articles apiece. Even so, the book covers a broad chronological and geographic context, and while there are commonalities to be found in the mapping and decolonization from the late eighteenth through the twentieth centuries— such as the iconic and propagandistic use of maps— the several contributions show the relationship between mapping and decolonization, like the concept of decolonization itself, to be multifaceted and defiant of summary. Our goal in assembling this volume has not been to offer a comprehensive treatment, but rather to move toward an understanding of the processes at work in decolonizing the map and to suggest where there may be common issues across time and geography, while respecting the distinctiveness of each context. In much the same way that The Imperial Map asked whether there is and what constitutes imperial cartography, so this collection asks whether there is and what is a decolonizing cartography. The authors were asked to consider, each within the context of their areas of specialty, how peoples and states emerging from colonization use maps to define, defend, and administer their polities and territories; to develop their national identities; and to establish their place in the community of nations. The papers, both as presented orally and in enlarged form here, offer many\n\n2 ·\n\nJames R. akeRman\n\npartial answers to these questions, but both the editor and the audience were struck by what cartographic history reveals about the limits of decolonization as well as the inadequacy of the term. At the heart of Craib’s sweeping review are the ongoing theoretical and geopolitical challenges to the very idea of decolonization. While acknowledging the widespread agreement among scholars and political observers that the simple equation of independence with decolonization is problematic, he shows nevertheless that the problematic nature of the concept is perhaps what makes it a meaningful line of inquiry into the character of mapping in the later modern world. If, as he acknowledges, “the contours of colonialism still configure the globe,” so, too, it is undeniable that the uneven retreat from empire has recast the meaning of these contours in the conduct of human affairs. More to the point here, his excursions into the broader scholarship of decolonization always come back to questions of geography and spatial practice, and therefore, fundamentally, maps and mapping. This is perhaps most explicit in his examination of the ways in which the boundary lines and place names inscribed on maps reflect and enforce both continuity and differentiation in decolonizing regions. Warning that though the power of imperial mapping and its influence on a decolonizing world are considerable, they were never as absolute as it is most often imagined. Incorporations, creolizations, resistance, and countercartographies, shaped the character of imperial cartography and set the decolonization of the map in motion well before independence. By the same token, Craib continues, decolonizing the map has been neither monolithic nor complete. Internal colonialism— the disproportionate distribution of power among elites, indigenes, regions, and ethnic groups within decolonizing states— has been expressed and reinforced by official and popular cartography, as have contests among political ideologies and political economies. Craib concludes by showing that, elusive as the concept is, the significance of decolonization as a lens through which we might come to understand cartographic history in the modern world is underscored by the extent to which the historians of cartography over the past thirty years have sought to decolonize the field itself. Magali Carrera’s chapter demonstrates that mapping is engaged in the formation of decolonizing national identities well before legal independence. The immediate context is late colonial Mexico, but the general observation is no less valid in preindependence Ghana, Egypt, and India-Pakistan, the subject of later chapters in this collection, as it is no doubt in many other African states and in French Indochina. What sets New Spain apart from these other contexts is that its late colonial identity emerged from settlement colonialism, where\n\nIntRoductIon\n\n· 3\n\nindigenous populations were largely or partially displaced, their survivors living alongside substantial populations of migrants from the imperial center and their descendants, who became— in Mexico, as in much of the Americas— the most important factor in the formation of an emergent national identity. Eighteenth-century Spanish colonial authorities saw in the mapping of New Spain opportunities for economic development and assertion of state control that were imperfectly developed in Spain itself. While published maps asserted the identity and authority of the viceroyalty in a manner consistent with European geopolitical idioms, they also fostered the emergence of a New Spanish (and ultimately Mexican) identity distinct both from Spain and the global Spanish Empire. The surveying and mapping of land tenure, for example, entailed a nuanced and complicated dialogue between European and indigenous mapping traditions well into the eighteenth century. Finally, Carrera argues that narrative mapping, in both textual and graphic form, plays in admixture with modern European mathematical cartography a critical role in an emergent criollo mapping in the latter eighteenth century, weaving New Spanish colonial history into Iberian sociogeographic traditions emphasizing local community. The tripartite entanglement of Spanish, native, and criollo cartographies, she concludes, was readily translated into a hybridized official and scholarly cartography of an independent Mexico. Similarly, but at the moment of revolution, in chapter 3 Lina del Castillo shows how mapping reflected competing ethnic and political visions of nationality in an independent Colombia/Gran Colombia. At the most superficial level this is a story of the competition between maps of two “Colombias”: a pan– South American federal Colombia (or “Colombia Prima”) promoted most prominently by the Venezuelan Francisco Miranda, and a more pragmatically conceived and narrowly defined “República de Colombia,” or Gran Colombia (composed of the territories of modern Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, and parts of Guiana and Brazil) supported in the later stages of the revolution by Simón Bolívar in a move to consolidate his power. Through detailed analysis of competing maps, their delineations of boundaries, emphasis of specific places, and omissions, Del Castillo shows how Bolívar’s Liberator Party took control of the early cartographic image of Colombia and, just as important, the mapped narrative of the Colombian revolution to discredit the revolutionary pedigree of political and military competitors. Del Castillo shows how the mapping of early Colombia represented who would get credit for its revolution, which aspects of revolutionary history would be preserved by a national history, and which would be forgotten. Extending this process in Latin America into the later nineteenth and twen-\n\n4 ·\n\nJames R. akeRman\n\ntieth centuries, Jordana Dym next explores how the often arbitrary nature of colonial boundaries can destabilize the territorial expression of national identities for a century and more after independence. She shows that delineation of Guatemala’s national geo-body (the often iconic geographic outline of a state; see Thongchai 1994) remained unstable for two centuries due to prolonged territorial negotiation with adjacent states. Here, as in many other places in Latin America, there was no clear continuity between colonial political divisions and postcolonial states, no consistent principle to govern this transition. The geopolitical chaos that often resulted played out in many different types of maps. Dym highlights especially the contradictory mapping of the relationship between British Honduras/Belize and Guatemala as well as the instability of Guatemala’s border with Mexico. Here again, factors of ethnicity and class come into play. Overarching specific territorial issues, Dym argues, was a shift in the social reach of the mapping involved, from a period of decolonization largely managed by and for criollos, elites, and the state to more democratized forms of mapping in the spheres of education, marketing, and tourism. The next four chapters move across the Atlantic and shift our focus to states that achieved independence in the twentieth century. In different cartographic spheres, topographic mapping and national atlas publication, McGowan and Culcasi trace the enduring influence of cartographic practices brought to Africa by European colonizers lingering in postcolonial mapping, even as African administrations, surveyors, and cartographers took over. In chapter 5, Jamie McGowan takes a long view of the role local intermediaries and native technocrats played in creating and mapping a British Gold Coast identity that became Ghana in 1957. McGowan begins with an outline of the career of George Ekem Ferguson, a mixed-race colonial operative whose combined skills both as mapmaker and political intermediary helped define the territory and political identity of the future Ghana. Ferguson’s partial African descent gave him an access to indigenous political relationships no British colonial official could hope to achieve, producing diplomatic successes that extended and solidified British control of the greater Gold Coast. His maps were the direct expression both of his British training and his African diplomatic sensibilities. Ferguson’s influence as a model in the twentieth century was limited, however, as colonial authorities organized formal surveys of the Gold Coast based on European, and more specifically British, models. Though Africans played a considerable role of as surveyors, draftsmen, and surveyor’s assistants, they were valued because they were a source of cheaper, semiprofessional labor, rather than for their intermediary status. Although their participation was\n\nIntRoductIon\n\n· 5\n\nincreasingly unacknowledged and unrecorded, the training of African surveyors and their proportional role in the mapping of the colony nevertheless increased. In the aftermath of the Second World War, mapping agencies were largely Africanized, forming the core of both personnel and methodologies that would account for a smooth transition to Ghanaian control of its now national topographic and cadastral mapping. The methods and standards on the new national mapping agencies were indistinguishable from European ones, a fact underscored by the belief, among African surveyors whose careers spanned both regimes, that surveying had nothing to do with politics— even as they ascended to positions of management in postcolonial Ghana. In like manner, Karen Culcasi traces the application of Western mapping practices, most especially in the production of national atlases, to the creation of an Egyptian national identity during that country’s protracted emergence as a modern nation-state. She argues that the Egyptian case is complicated not only by its long history of quasi independence from the Ottoman Empire, France, and Britain, but also by its unstable relationship to secular nationalism, internal minorities, pan-Arabism, and Islamic movements of the late twentieth century. Culcasi shows that the first national atlases and topographic projects created after nominal independence in 1922 remained essentially British projects, created mostly by British cartographers and in accordance with British standards. Even a second edition of the first national atlas, the Atlas of Egypt, published in 1958, after the Officer’s Revolution, was unchanged, with the exception of its rhetorical trappings and erasure of marks of British authorship. Thereafter, the cartographic assertion of a postcolonial Egyptian identity was strident but not univocal. It was complicated by the promotion of a panArabic identity in Egyptian atlases and maps, as well as by the countermappings of minorities such as Coptic Christians and Nubians. Culcasi shares with Dym a concern for the public projection of national identity, but whereas Guatemalan cartographers grappled with an unstable geo-body, Culcasi shows that, despite the territorial stability of postcolonial Egypt, its cartography has struggled with a national identity buffeted by social, ethnic, and religious pressures from both within and beyond its boundaries. The contradictions and conflicts generated by the twentieth-century rush to carve out and validate national territories from former colonies lie at the heart of Sumathi Ramaswamy’s interrogation of the enduring crisis created by the partition of British India. She sets the stage by recalling the halfhearted and almost banal way in which the Radcliffe line separating the independent states of Pakistan and India was conceived and committed to paper, strangely\n\n6 ·\n\nJames R. akeRman\n\nwithout any significant involvement of the considerable cartographic and geographic institutions the colonial power had at its disposal. Predictably, the partition itself prompted immediate cartographic reactions, both Pakistani and Indian, but precise, official public representations of the border were scarce. Ramaswamy then argues that the boundary line and the concept of partition have been both duplicated and reconceived by literary and artistic mappings, as well as propagandistic and other forms of popular cartography. While these mappings have to some extent naturalized the geo-bodies of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, seen as a whole, and sometimes explicitly, they also challenge the legitimacy of the partition, and with it one of the most intractable problems of the decolonizing world map. To the same general point, chapter 8, by Thomas Bassett, argues that mapping for travelers and tourists has actively contributed to the survival of internal colonialisms within nominally independent, decolonized states. Bassett shows how during the apartheid era, and often beyond it, South African road and street maps masked or entirely erased the presence of indigenous African communities within their own homeland in the name of better serving their audience of predominantly white motorists. I am struck by the similarity to the way that cover art on road maps published in the United States in the 1920s– 50s depicted African Americans and Indians as part of the landscape and whites, only, as motorists— that is, as the only American citizens truly liberated by the geographic mobility the automobile offered (Akerman 2006). Bassett finds in the history of road mapping in apartheid and postapartheid South Africa a rich context for examining the persistence of racial prejudices and the racialized organization of space in a country that has experienced a protracted and ambiguous decolonization. South African road mapping offers a dramatic example of how the spatial practices of internal colonialism utterly destroy any simple historical equation between the nominal achievement of sovereignty and the spatial expression of decolonization, if we mean by that the achievement by formerly colonized peoples of some measure of liberty and power over territory. One might expect road mapping, with its navigational intent, to be a cartographic genre that is largely depoliticized. Bassett shows powerfully that racial and colonial politics are present even in this realm, and perhaps more perniciously so, because the eye and mind of the map user are likely to be quite unaware of them. In his introduction to The Imperial Map Matthew Edney struggled mightily with the idea of an “imperial map.” There is nothing intrinsically imperial, he argued, about any map: what makes a map imperialistic is not its specific\n\nIntRoductIon\n\n· 7\n\ncontent or form, but how and for whom they are deployed. Imperial maps do not constitute some complex of related mapping genres. Neither are they functionally distinct from other maps that exert power. Edney was particularly concerned with the similarities and dissimilarities of imperial mapping and mapping implicated in the formation and maintenance of nations and states. Clearly the two are intertwined, and any distinction, he argued, was one enforced not by differences in form or content, but by the sociopolitical and geographic separation of the peoples and polities involved. Imperial mapping is that of territories and polities by peoples and interests removed— emotionally, morally, and spatially— from the territories and peoples mapped, who have relatively little say in how and why they are mapped (Edney 2006). It follows that decolonizing the map would entail processes and practices by which colonized peoples become more engaged or reengaged in mapping their own spaces and territories. Inasmuch as a major portion of mapping in the modern world by governmental or other agencies is implicated in the modern state system, mapping as an aspect of decolonization correlates with movements for, and the achievement of, the independence of colonies and colonized peoples. This commonsense narrative is reinforced by the almost universal attention newly independent states pay to the production of new maps and atlases that affirm their independence and identity. But this narrative is both complicated by the nuances of individual cases and, in some instances, undermined by them. The cartography of a nation-state emergent from a colonial regime only throws off with difficulty, if ever, the implied inequality of imperial mapping, and decolonization is often experienced unevenly and restrictively by peoples and social groups within a new state. Collectively, the chapters that follow show that decolonized mapping is forefronted primarily by the operation of colonial and former colonial elites or other privileged groups, creoles (criollos), other intermediaries between indigenous communities, and authorities within the colony. For the most part this mapping adopts and adapts the cartographic idioms and practices used by European imperial powers, even where employed by countermapping generated by minorities within the new nation-states. Drawing new boundaries and creating new geo-bodies, naming and renaming places and territories, powerful as they may be in shaping public opinion and social spaces on the ground, either fail to achieve their desired effect or produce unintended consequences. The cartographic and geopolitical record of the past two centuries shows that, in mapping their new states, decolonizing communities distinguish themselves from their former colonizers and consolidate new identities only gradually and incompletely.\n\n8 ·\n\nJames R. akeRman\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAkerman, James. 2006. “Twentieth-Century American Road Maps and the Making of a National Motorized Space.” In Cartographies of Travel and Navigation, edited by James R.

INTRODUCTION\n\nI will begin with a rather plain but instructive map: map 6 from James Francis Horrabin’s An Atlas of Empire, published in 1937 (fig 1.1). The map, created and published on the eve of Italy’s invasion of Abyssinia, is a blunt representation of European colonial possessions in Africa. The image reveals visually the following statistic: six European states covering a total area of 660,000 square miles “own[ed] close on 11 and ½ million square miles in Africa.”1 Such statistics led Horrabin, a working-class educator and innovative socialist geographer, to proffer a remarkably succinct definition of Europe: it was, he wrote, “a group of States holding colonial possessions in other continents.” 2 Two decades later, Frantz Fanon would take this observation to its logical, and historicized, conclusion: “Europe is literally the creation of the Third World.”3 At their imperial apex, colonial powers (including not only European states but also the United States and Japan) laid claim to more than three-quarters of the world’s landmass. Yet no more than a half-century later this equation had been inverted as anticolonial struggles, domestic agitation in the metropoles,\n\n11\n\nfigure 1.1. Africa possessed. European domination of Africa. Map 6 from J. F.

Certainly the “military red” of British domination no longer spread itself across the globe. If in 1898 Rand McNally could celebrate the British Empire in an\n\n12 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\natlas by noting that “the real magnitude of the vast empire of Great Britain can not be fully comprehended until it is studied in a series of gooD Maps, such as those contained in this volume,” by the early 1960s even the most ardent imperialists had to recognize that the empire’s sun was indeed setting.5 By 1962 Britain’s colonial empire, which had formerly spanned the globe, appeared as little more than a hodgepodge of bloody outposts on the maps of the annual British Colonial Office Lists (fig. 1.2).6 The magnitude of how much had changed in the wake of two world wars and shifts in global resource accumulation can be conveyed with a few statistics: the continent of Africa contained only four independent countries in 1948; by 1965 there were thirty-seven.7 The United Nations counted fifty-one member states in 1945; three decades later it had three times that number.8 The pace of change was so rapid that the cartographic division for the US National Geographic Society, on its September 1960 atlas plate of Africa, felt compelled to note the following: “Boundaries on this map reflect the political situation as of July 15, 1960, the day the map went to press.”9 Much had changed. But there were continuities, a reality nowhere better captured than in the fact that theories of neocolonialism developed in tandem with decolonization in the 1960s. In this chapter I take a synoptic view of cartography and decolonization in the twentieth century and make occasional reference to nineteenth-century processes of decolonization in the Americas. The essay is intentionally broad and synthetic: it looks at colonization and decolonization across the globe and across nearly two centuries, although the primary focus is on the twentieth century. While cognizant of the fact that the particularities of decolonization varied according to time and space— something that is clear in the subsequent essays in this volume— I have taken this wide-angle perspective in order to put the historical experiences and processes of decolonization in Africa and Asia, in North America and Latin America, in Oceania and Southwest Asia into conversation, comparison, and relation to one another. Doing so highlights certain patterns and continuities but, of course, at the risk of eliding differences and disjunctures. The essay builds on a growing body of secondary literature on cartography, colonialism, and postcolonialism in order to highlight general themes and points of comparison and contrast, while at the same time plumbing particular primary sources (maps of various kinds) that illustrate such processes or trends. While it highlights certain themes and points, it invariably also suffers from elisions, exceptions, and generalizations. In this respect the essay resembles not only a map— which is inherently selective— but also “decolonization” itself which was, as historian Prasenjit Duara observes, “neither a coherent event [ . . . ] nor a well-defined phenomenon.”10\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 13\n\nfigure 1.2.

Continued\n\nThe conceptual, as well as geographic, approach to colonialism and decolonization I take here is also somewhat capacious. While my emphasis is on colonialism in the formal sense— that is, formal political control— I do, at certain points and particularly toward the end of the essay, also take up the question of decolonization and neocolonialism or informal empire. My intent is not to conflate what are, and should remain, useful distinctions— between, say, “imperialism” and “colonialism”— regarding forms of external control and/ or domination. At the same time, and as will become apparent throughout the essay, such distinctions are rarely clear cut, and some attention to the range of relationships, often unequal and involving a variety of coercive mechanisms, that might be plotted on a “colonial” spectrum is warranted.11 “Informal” does not seem adjectively adequate to capture the ruthlessness with which, say, the United States engaged the Caribbean and Central America in the twentieth century.12 But more to the point, informal empire was never far removed from its more heavy-handed partner, which is why when anticolonial leaders, intellectuals, and masses living under the yoke of colonial rule spoke of independence or emancipation, they often did so with a vocabulary informed as much by socialism (and, as I will argue below, anarchism) as by nationalism or anticolonialism per se.13 I wrote this essay as part of a series of talks on mapping the transition from colony to nation, but many colonies did not make such transitions. In a recent grand work on empire, historians Jane Burbank and Fred Cooper observed that nation-states were not the only alternative to empire: federation, confederation, and a host of other possibilities existed.14 Similarly, historian Jeremy Adelman notes for the specific case of Ibero-America, “no single vision of postcolonial sovereignty filled the vacuum left behind. . . . The nation was not prefigured by colonialism to herald its demise.”15 Moreover, what exactly independence means is a contentious question. What is the relationship between decolonization and independence? Independence from what? And for whom? And how do such issues manifest themselves in the realm of cartography? To what degree does looking at decolonization through the lens of the history of cartography affect or force us to rethink our understandings of processes of decolonization and vice versa?\n\nII. LINES, MINDS, AND NAMES\n\nThe contours of colonialism still configure the globe.16 Decolonization led to the dramatic, and still contentious, partition or territorial reconfiguration of\n\n16 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nsome formerly colonized lands, most notably in what had been British India and in Southwest Asia. In other cases, colonial territorial configurations outlived their creators. While newly independent states would frequently reconfigure internal jurisdictional boundaries, the international political boundaries inscribed by colonial powers oftentimes remained intact, despite having been imposed arbitrarily, as a matter of administrative convenience, or based upon flawed and ethnocentric principles. Thus, even if they bore little relation to political, social, linguistic, or ecological relationships on the ground, such spatial constructs— and the abbreviated history they carried with them— persisted, both as a consequence of and an impetus for modern cartography.17 As geographer Matthew Sparke has aptly noted, “Cartography is part of a reciprocal or, better, a recursive social process in which maps shape a world that in turn shapes its maps.”18 Thus it was that the membership of the Organization of African Unity, created in 1966, agreed to abide by the boundaries established by the colonial powers in the years following the Berlin Conference of 1885.19 Precedent existed in such matters: while the boundaries of many of the fledgling republics of Latin America born of independence movements in the early nineteenth century would change over the course of that century, leaders of those movements initially applied the legal principle of uti possidetis juris (Latin for “as you possess under law”) to ensure that existing colonial contours would serve as the international boundaries for their new states.20 Yet those contours— and the criteria used to determine them— were themselves not easily determined or agreed upon, and boundary changes and conflicts were commonplace through much of the nineteenth century.21 Moreover, in many instances the newborn states shared with their Spanish predecessor an inability to assert administrative control beyond the bounds of the centers of political life. To use the possessive when discussing Mexico’s far north or Chile’s or Argentina’s Patagonia is to engage in a useful, but fictional, cartographic shorthand. These were regions where the postcolonial state had little purchase until the arrival of global capital and the development of new transportation and military technologies later in the century. The fact that formerly colonized subjects did not escape the boundaries created by colonial powers does not, of course, mean that newly formed states were somehow inauthentic or colonies in postcolonial drag. Boundaries may be static (and even that is open to debate at some level) but their meanings are not. Regardless of how dramatically they obscured or overwrote other existing territorialities, boundaries created by colonial powers acquired a reality and a meaning over time to many living within their bounds. The intervening decades or centuries between the creation of a colonial territory and its demise\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 17\n\nwere never mere interregnums, nor did the violence of colonialism and the imposition of new property regimes and ethnic identities necessarily prevent colonized subjects from developing affective attachments to new territorialities, new properties, and new identities. Whatever their initial artificiality, the passage of time gave them weight. Thus, while one can readily agree that postcolonial national maps naturalize what are historical and social colonial constructions, it is important to recognize that they do not remain solely ideological and repressive fictions. The anticolonial imaginary was often geographic, and such spaces often constituted what were perceived to be necessary geographies of decolonization. He overstated the case, but writer Albert Memmi was not entirely amiss when he argued that “being oppressed as a group the colonized must necessarily adopt a national and ethnic form of liberation.”22 Not surprisingly, in most cases the national and ethnic form of liberation took shape in part through reference to colonially imposed boundaries. That such was the case highlights the fact that processes of decolonization, like colonization itself, rarely unfolded among equals. At least in the twentieth century, the colonized intelligentsia and the individuals who in many instances led anticolonial movements and/or composed the first generation of postcolonial leadership were often educated in the metropole or by metropolitan teachers, and so the political systems, models, and aspirations they held were often ones associated with the metropole.23 If many postcolonial states did not— and perhaps did not want to— escape the territorial boundaries established by their colonial predecessors, anticolonial leaders and the inheritors of independence could at least decolonize their spaces in other ways, including rewriting the landscape toponymically and recasting the past. Like novels, art, and music, maps became a means through which to re-present and develop a postcolonial identity liberated from colonial determinations. Maps and atlases thus helped perform the hard cultural work of decolonizing the land, the past, and, in the famous phrase of Kenyan intellectual Ngugi wa Thiong’o, the mind.24 Take, for example, the case of toponyms on maps. Decolonization meant that colonizers would no longer dictate the terms of representation: neither politically nor, in this instance, poetically. Naming constituted a basic strategy of imperial and colonial control.25 Thus, with decolonization a veritable tide of toponymic change washed much of the globe, at least in the twentieth century. In some cases only the country name changed: British Honduras may now be Belize, but while there one can still travel through Roaring Creek, Bamboo Camp, and Double Head Cabbage. In other cases, new administrations oversaw name changes not only to their nations but also to cities, towns,\n\n18 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\ndistricts, streets, and natural features. New names simultaneously overturned those imposed by colonizers and fostered a renewed interest in, and affirmed the validity of, local and regional dialects and national languages. Thus, in many instances spellings, rather than names per se, changed. Whether it be the resuscitation of the hamzah (’) and the macron (ī) in Oceanic place names or the slight modification to Calcutta, a quintessentially colonial city, the idea was to shift language away from an imposed Europeanization. Toponyms and languages matter not solely for the imprint they leave and the impression they make but also for the knowledges they hold, the identities they evoke, the history they convey. Place names are often mnemonic devices that sustain genealogies, ground cultures, and write histories.26 In all of these cases, language becomes a key site of anticolonial struggle. As the Irish patriarch in Translations, Brian Friel’s remarkable play on the English mapping of Ireland in the 1840s, remarks: “English [ . . . ] couldn’t really express us.”27 The names applied to regions or nonstate spaces can challenge colonialist frames of reference and further efforts to decolonize not only the mind but the past. Take for example the subtle but powerful difference in perspective that might be evoked by using Oceania or Pacific Islands. Tongan intellectual Epeli Hau‘ofa poignantly noted, “There is a world of difference between viewing the Pacific as ‘islands in a far sea’ and as ‘a sea of islands.’ The first emphasizes dry surfaces in a vast ocean far from the centers of power. . . . The second is a more holistic perspective in which things are seen in the totality of their relationships.”28 Hau‘ofa’s vision here is emphatically decolonial and cartographic: it is a rethinking of the relation of water, land, and sky and a conceptualization of the space of the ocean itself as connective tissue such that oceanic states no longer appear as small and isolated outposts too remote to achieve economic independence from wealthier nations and too dispersed to meaningfully cohere.29 Although it is important to note that indigenous names are not themselves somehow “neutral” in their meaning and representation, Hau‘ofa has history on his side. Many of Oceania’s inhabitants have long traversed and settled swaths of ocean as if they were a liquid prairie. Outrigger canoes— varying in length from nine feet for vessels used in lagoons to thirty feet for double-hulled vehicles with sails intended for long-distance, interisland travel— turn the ocean into a conduit rather than a barrier, a vast plain webbed by routes to island configurations “arranged in blocks or groups rather than widely spaced, isolated specks of land.”30 Outrigger canoe navigators, orienting themselves through reference to stars and horizon points, sidereal compass technology, and a deeply learned ability to read the ocean and sky, traveled vast distances, in the process establishing fishing and hunting grounds,\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 19\n\nfigure 1.3.

From this horizontal perspective, the ocean was less a limit or endpoint of a culture or society than a fullfledged part of it, a point captured by none other than navigator and explorer James Cook, who felt compelled to pose the following rhetorical question in his journal in 1778: “How shall we account for this nation spreading itself so far over the Vast ocean?”32\n\n20 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.4. Tupaia’s world? The Society Islands, James Cook, from an original chart by Tupaia. The chart is a drawing by Cook based on the information and an initial image made by Tupaia. The scale is impressive: according to David Turnbull, the space represented in the map here is approximately the size of the continental United States.\n\nCook had already made some effort to learn an answer when he took on board the Endeavor in 1769 a navigator and priest named Tupaia from the island of Raiatea (near Tahiti). Tupaia died while on board but at least a portion of his geographic knowledge was put down on parchment and copies made, including one in the work of Johann Rheingold Forster in his Observations Made during a Voyage around the World (1779) (fig. 1.4). So here is Tupaia’s map . . . or is it? Anthropologist Margaret Jolly captures the quandary well: Though he is the author, this map is not his indigenous view. We will never know the details of that view, but his vision was likely rather differently “situated knowledge.” I suspect it located the observer not soaring high above the islands, powerfully riding on the confident coordinates of longitude and latitude, plotting a changing global position relative to east and west, north and south, but rather lying low in a canoe, looking up at the heavens, scanning the horizon for signs of land, and navigating the powerful seas with the embodied visual, aural, olfactory, and kinesthetic knowledge passed down\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 21\n\nthrough generations of Pacific navigators. His knowledge would have been communicated to other Tahitians through genealogical stories and chants, through the materials of the canoe and the sails, and through the embodied practice of navigation.33\n\nThe point here is not to argue over whether Tupaia did or did not create the map but rather to emphasize that Hau‘ofa’s “Oceania” asks us to acknowledge— historically and linguistically— such theoretical and practical knowledge, not as a means to articulate radical difference but in order to move beyond colonial legacies that have cast “a nation spread over a vast ocean” as little more than isolated and distant relations stranded on tierra firme . . . as little more than so many “Pacific Islands.” As well as place names, postcolonial administrations and populations have produced maps and atlases— national, cultural, and political— as part of a broader effort to connect a place to a past. They helped foster (whether as resurrection or invention) a nationalist historical narrative. Cartographers in places diverse as Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, and Iran inscribed— and reinscribed— a distant past onto modern maps of the nation in an effort to stress the nation’s temporal longevity and cultural coherence, or to visualize and legitimize irredentist aims.34 Similarly, Indian intellectuals in turn-of-the-century British India recast the map of the colony as a female adorned with archaic and culturally specific items in order to link history and geography and thereby “foster the sentiment of belonging and possession.”35 More recently, players for the Chilean soccer club Palestino— founded by Palestinian immigrants in 1920— sport not only jerseys with the colors of the Palestinian flag, but also numbers on their shirts in which, controversially, the “one” is in the shape of Palestine’s geographic configuration prior to the creation of Israel. By the mid-twentieth century such efforts were often pursued through the production of national atlases, what geographer Mark Monmonier has called the “symbol of national unity, scientific achievement, and political independence” par excellence.36 Atlases served as a powerful means of cultural and political self-representation. Frequently designed for broad public consumption and reflecting concerted efforts to inculcate a particular image of a place and its past in order to forge collective unity, national atlases combined modern technological forms and formats with attention to cultural specificity and particularity. Thus atlases would often celebrate (or, at times, idealize) pasts that preceeded the colonial era, narrating how the country took shape beyond the confines of colonialism. These creations frequently carry with them the specter of invented tradi-\n\n22 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\ntion. As historian Jeremy Black has noted, they can suffer from a “habit of seeking to portray the long-term history of states whose territorial extent and ethnic composition were often the work of European conquerors and therefore relatively recent.”37 As important a point as this is, some caution is warranted here. For one, we should not too quickly jump to the conclusion that always everywhere Europeans made colonial boundaries and affiliations while their subjects merely watched. Subjects they may have been; passive they were not. Second, such an argument might be taken to mean that therefore these efforts at decolonial history and place making are somehow contrived. Well . . . yes, but the whiff of artifice lingers around all nation-states, regardless of their purported longevity. In fact, one might suggest a corollary: the more ancient a past claimed, the stronger the smell. Third, such a perspective tends to forget that the formation of modern European states often unfolded in relation to colonial expansion, to the degree that one might argue that the nation-states of Europe were in fact at least partially a product of the colonies. And finally, there was a past (a history, if not History) prior to the arrival of the colonials. In the aftermath of decades or generations of colonial rule, how does one write that past? More to the point, how does one write such pasts— violently occluded, suppressed, or ignored by colonizers— in deeply political and persistently neocolonial contexts? On what space do such pasts get to unfold? The very creation of such nationalist pasts— of Histories that locate recent states deep in time— was in part an effort to situate the colonized in historical time; an effort to respond to, and overcome, colonizers’ models of the world that had cast the colonized as essentially timeless and premodern.38 Rather than anachronistic and essentialist projections, such historical geographies might more productively be seen as simultaneous efforts to account for those neglected pasts and to engage in a dialectical process of cultural recreation in the wake of generations of colonial rule and cultural, social, and political oppression.39\n\nIII. OCCUPIED: INTERNAL COLONIALISM\n\nThe more troubling aspect of such efforts is not their supposed historical and spatial infidelities. It is, rather, their potential for social and political exclusion. Who wields such visions of the past and to what end? Decolonization did not necessarily entail political, social, or cultural equality for all those living within a given empire’s or nation-state’s bounds. Leaders of anticolonial movements could be more intent on protecting and perpetuating the interests of a particular class or sector of society than on implementing broad social change. In this\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 23\n\nthey shared the experience of European elites who, during and after the French Revolution, used notions of national sovereignty largely as a means to hold on to their status.40 Other examples abound, from Lat Dior and his Wolof kingdom in Senegal to the political powers in postcolonial Vanuatu to the marginalization of Berber speakers in northwest Africa.41 Or take the Creole elite who garnered independence from Spain in early nineteenth century Latin America, men such as Agustín de Iturbide; some have argued that they can hardly have been considered colonial subjects and that the transition from Spanish to national rule heralded little change for the majority of the indigenous and poor mestizo inhabitants.42 A significant number of the anti-imperialists in Cuba and Puerto Rico who sought liberation from Spanish rule still held dreams of a nation purged of blacks.43 And lest we forget, the Age of Liberty was also the Age of Slavery. In the United States liberation from imperial rule perpetuated slavery rather than hastened its demise: remaining British colonies would abolish slavery some three decades prior to its end in the United States.44 Such lessons were not lost on Frantz Fanon, who, a century later, would strike an angry and suspicious tone when envisioning Algerian and African independence: “The changeover will not take place at the level of the structures set up by the [national] bourgeoisie during its reign, since that caste has done nothing more than take over unchanged the legacy of the economy, the thought, and the institutions left by the colonialists.”45 At the expense of the majority of the populace, they “inherit the unfair advantages which are a legacy of the colonial period.”46 Clearly there were changes in the shift from colonial to independent rule. In most of Latin America, formal caste distinctions disappeared; in the wake of the ravages of a decade of wars, new opportunities arose for peasants and Indians (often one in the same) to regain or expand landholding; slavery was abolished, as early as the 1820s in some areas, and by the 1850s in all countries except Brazil and Cuba. Even so, for the mass of working people, urban and rural, there was often limited change in the social hierarchy after independence. We might speak of independence for particular polities, but for many inhabitants of former colonies this did not necessarily translate into self-rule. Similarly, for long-marginalized ethnic, cultural, and linguistic minorities, the transfer from colonial to national rule could appear as no transfer at all, being little more than a shift from external to internal colonialism. The Creole elites of much of Spanish America may have celebrated their nations’ native pasts, as Mexican cartographer Antonio García Cubas did here in an 1885 plate from his Atlas (fig. 1.5), but they seemed to be, at best, at a loss when it came to their\n\n24 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.5.

The same could be said regarding the struggle for sovereignty in what became the United States. In the twentieth century, similar cases abound: take, for example, South Africa, where members of the minority white population created atlases that purported to represent the whole country even as the regime of apartheid\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 25\n\nfound its fullest expression.48 The Portuguese colony of East Timor declared independence in late November 1975; in December of that same year, Indonesian forces invaded. The Bougainville Rebellion of 1988 pitted an armed insurgency seeking independence against the military forces of Papua New Guinea, itself only recently liberated from Australian rule in 1975. Ethiopia’s annexation of Eritrea in 1962 ushered in language and educational policies that smacked of old colonial habits to many Eritreans. The decades-long war that followed eventually ended with recognition of Eritrean independence in 1993. In Sudan the three southernmost provinces were home to a missionaryeducated elite cultivated by British colonial machinations that sought to “retribalize” Sudan. This elite found itself with little access to the state and rebelled against the Khartoum-based government at the very moment of Sudanese independence.49 The simultaneous persistence and reworking of colonial technologies, epistemologies, and categories of difference is captured vividly in a 1969 map, a sheet of which is shown in figures 1.6a and 1.6b. The Sudanese authorities took a 1946 British colonial map of tribal and provincial boundaries and reinscribed it thickly with racial categories and boundaries. The Sudanese Survey Department labeled those groups of the southern provinces, still resisting Khartoum, as “Negroid,” and those in the remaining provinces, with two exceptions, as “Arabic.” One of those exceptions was Darfur, the populace of which the Survey Department categorized as “Negroid” but situated within an administrative space deemed “Arabic.” The intricacies of such anticolonial movements around the globe during the 1950s and 1960s inspired marginalized populations in countries that had long since been formally decolonized, including the United States. This should hardly come as a surprise: were the differences between the racial hierarchies that held sway in many colonies and the virulent Jim Crow laws in the United States really that marked?50 Thus, by the 1950s and 1960s, in the midst of a “cold war,” black militants in the United States questioned the narrative teleology of “freedom” proffered by a nominally liberal state that still tolerated segregation and racial violence; instead, they found inspiration in the racial tolerance purportedly advocated by Soviet Russia. The equation of social justice with racial justice— of the intimate link between racial and class prejudice— explains Stokely Carmichael’s appreciation of Fidel Castro as “the blackest man in the Caribbean.”51 Meanwhile, in the late 1960s and 1970s, Chicano nationalists spoke of “internal colonialism” and identified Aztlán as the ancestral homeland of the Aztecs and, therefore, as the ancestral home of people of Mexican descent living in, as Rudolfo Acuña provocatively phrased it, an “occupied America” (figs. 1.7 and 1.8).52 They needed no further explanation\n\n26 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.6a.

AN EMPIRE OF NATION- S TATES\n\nAll of this raises a question: To what degree is the nation-state itself a perpetuation, rather than supercession, of colonialism? A “poisoned gift,” as Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri put it?54 As numerous authors have observed, the nation-state form was not necessarily the only— or primary— option for anticolonial movements. Yet too frequently, as Fred Cooper notes, “because we know that the politics of the 1940s and 1950s did indeed end up producing nation-states, we tend to weave all forms of opposition to what colonialism did into a narrative of growing nationalist sentiment and nationalist organization. That the motivations and even the effects of political action at several junctures could have been something else can easily be lost.”55 Scholars have made similar arguments for insurgent politics in nineteenth-century Latin America.56 Lost are the alternative political possibilities that circulated that did not take the liberal state as their starting and ending point. Indeed, simultaneous with late nineteenth-century anticolonial struggles a remarkable, cosmopolitan, and transnational movement opposed to the imperialism of both colonial\n\n28 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.8.

The most important leftist movement of the era, anarchism was the primary oppositional force challenging capitalism, imperialism, oligarchy, and autocracy, and it linked anticolonial leaders across hemispheres, from Manila to Havana, from Cairo to Bengal, from Edo to Moscow.57 Anarchism would confront opposition from both the left and the right as the twentieth century progressed, particularly by the 1930s, and not surprisingly so given the devotion of both liberals and communists to the nation-state. Thus, nationalism— at times, but certainly not always, a virulent ethnonationalism— often emerged as the counter to colonial rule. New forms— domestic forms, for lack of a better word— of colonialism arose, ones that sought to force “an isomorphism between national populations and territorial domains.”58 New minoritized populations were created; others persisted through the transfer of power. This meant for many already marginalized, or newly marginalized, populations that the nation-state appeared on the horizon\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 29\n\nas little more than another form of labor capture, cultural repression, resource exploitation, and territorial expropriation. James Scott argues: the encounter between expansionary states and self-governing peoples [that occurred in Southeast Asia] . . . is echoed in the cultural and administrative process of “internal colonialism” that characterizes the formation of most modern Western nation-states; in the imperial projects of the Romans, the Hapsburgs, the Ottomans, the Han, and the British; in the subjugation of indigenous peoples in “white-settler” colonies such as the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, and Algeria; in the dialectic between sedentary, town-dwelling Arabs and nomadic pastoralists that have characterized much of Middle Eastern history.59\n\nIn such cases, the nation-state appears as a form of colonial persistence, a perpetuation of, rather than emancipation from, colonial ontologies.60 Indeed, in certain cases one would be hard pressed to find the difference between colonial and national cartographic techniques and the manner in which they were applied, particularly in relation to long-marginalized populations whose relationships to any state form— whether colonial or national— were invariably conflictual and unequal.61 Historian Jeremy Black, one of the few writers to have attempted to wrestle broadly with decolonization and cartography, writes that “the cartographic processes and devices employed elsewhere in the world are very much those of the West. Western science and techniques remain central, and there has been no real attempt to revive or devise different cartographic methods.”62 I am sympathetic to Black’s point— indeed, it goes to the heart of both the loose abstraction and brute materiality of colonialism, and I will pursue its implications in a moment— but it does require at least some qualification. It is worth recalling, for one, that the technologies used by colonizing powers did not necessarily develop prior to, or in isolation from, acts of colonization and the activities of the colonized themselves. Claims of technological diffusion— that located the origins and development of “science” in the metropole— were (and remain) integral components of self-serving colonial ideologies that emphasized “difference” in order to legitimate subjugation, despite the fact that such “differences” were produced through, rather than prior to, colonial relations. (Indeed, such claims were essential components to the very constitution— the very fabrication— of something called “the West.”) These were retrospective claims that suppressed the realm of interchange, overlap, and reciprocal interaction— the entire world of dialogic,\n\n30 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\ntranscultural engagement— that characterized how colonial science often functioned and developed on the ground.63 Colonial cartographic routines drew upon local practices, knowledges, and mapping operations; meanwhile, colonized peoples participated in mapping enterprises and populated cartographic bureaucracies, as agronomists, as surveyors and draftsmen, as informants and guides, and in a multitude of other roles.64 Indeed, this helps to explain to some degree the remarkable continuities in colonial and postcolonial cartographic technologies, practices, personnel, and modes of representation. Postcolonial governments around the globe often took the cadastral, geodetic, and topographic surveys of previous colonial administrations and put them to use for new political and social programs. Continuities in personnel were common also, whether it be in the composition of survey crews in postrevolutionary Mexico or in postcolonial Ghana.65 In Nigeria, Northern Rhodesia/Zambia, and Swaziland, the British Directorate of Overseas Surveys continued working on large-scale topographic surveys after independence.66 This should not be surprising. The same technologies and skills that went into generating colonial boundaries or creating settler properties were used to affirm postcolonial boundaries, to expropriate or confirm properties, or to undertake vast programs of land reform.67 While such reforms were not always necessarily associated with formal decolonization, they were often part of a larger set of initiatives undertaken by many young (and some not so young) governments to assert power and ownership over national assets and to fulfill the promise of self-determination and sovereignty. This was as true for, say, postrevolutionary Mexico or Bolivia— long independent from formal colonial rule— as it was for only recently liberated Nigeria or Tanzania. Colonial cartographic technologies, regardless of purported origin, could be used for myriad purposes. Technologies were rife with subversive possibility. Kingdoms, states, and populaces could, and did, appropriate various mapping technologies associated with colonizing powers to their own ends— in some cases to stave off colonial encroachments, in other cases to expand their own territorial bounds, and yet in other instances to defend highly localized forms of land tenure or sovereignty. In other cases such technologies were used to visually represent an alternative nationalist imagination to that plotted out by both colonial and postcolonial regimes, as Sumathi Ramaswamy has demonstrated for the case of Lemuria, or to purport historical or legal territorial rights, as seen in the Lakota logo-map shown in figure 1.9.68 Although such technological and epistemological appropriations (forced appropriations, perhaps) could be cast as part of a narrative of loss, a shift in perspective might suggest we see them as, in Ramaswamy’s felicitous phrasing, “hijackings,” a term\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 31\n\nfigure 1.9.

Having said that, colonialism was never a relationship of equals, and the power imbalances cannot be ignored. Strategies of cartographic appropriation, as geographers Joel Wainwright and Joe Bryan have argued, “do not reverse colonial social relations so much as rework them.”72 Colonized populations found themselves in situations in which they had little choice but to engage to some degree with the idiom of the state and its emphasis on property and contract, thus becoming physically and epistemologically enclosed.73 Cartographic technologies may have been useful in carrying out radical land reform programs, for example, but the basic premises of modern land surveying left little room for forms of engaging with the land that did not conform to the specifics of nominally Western property norms. Different ways of understanding, occupying, and working space were made to disappear— largely through the law— and different ways of representing space dismissed in courts as unscientific, unreliable, or simply illegible. For example, connections to and tenure in land among some aboriginal peoples of Australia is expressed and determined through “knowledge of dreamings,” in which “stories, songs, dances and sacred objects relating to the dreamings are the very title deeds. [ . . . ] In contrast with the commodity view of rights to land, an Aboriginal person’s rights to land are not capable of being bought and sold, because the self can-\n\n32 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nnot be traded.”74 Or take the case brought to court in 1987 by the Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en peoples in the Canadian province of British Columbia, regarding issues of self-government and territorial jurisdiction, in which they drew on very different conceptualizations and practices of space and cartography from that proffered by the Canadian state.75 They used oral traditions and songs as a means to evoke a historical geography. Both in form and content these challenged the standard and imposed criteria for geographic and historical evidence followed by the court.76 Their efforts were initially not successful, revealing the difficulties faced by populations attempting to challenge colonialism’s legacies outside of its own epistemological formations (fig. 1.10). Thus, as Curtis Berkey notes, “the challenge for Native peoples and their lawyers is to develop maps that incorporate traditional ways of knowing, while at the same time adhering to cartographic procedures that are acceptable in an alien legal system. In this way, courts may be persuaded that the truth contained in Native maps is worthy of the same respect as the official maps of the government.”77 Participatory and community mapping projects, at times controversial, have highlighted both the promise and problem of trying to navigate through one of the most persistent realities of colonialism: that colonizers unequally set the terms of ontological and epistemological engagement.78 Such projects can simultaneously confront and challenge colonial logics and generate a dialogue between tradition and modernity, among the past, present, and future— factors that are an integral part of any collectivity. “By definition,” writes Joe Bryan with respect to participatory community mapping, “maps present indigenous traditions in new ways, to new audiences, creating new understandings of community and territory.”79 The point is essential if we are to move beyond stale arguments that celebrate stasis as the sine qua non of authenticity. Holding “culture” or “custom” in a state of stasis is no less a colonial view. The question of “custom” is never outside the political context in which it is invoked. This is not to suggest it is deployed purely instrumentally but that “custom,” much like “modernity,” is a relational and contextual concept.80 More bluntly, determining what is native and what is foreign is always a fraught— that is to say, political— exercise. Thus, instead of equating the authentic with the pure or unsullied, a strategy of conservative enclosure if there ever was one, or, conversely, suggesting no such thing as authenticity is possible, we might instead think about authenticity in the terms eloquently laid out by anthropologist Sherry Ortner: Authenticity is another highly problematized term, insofar as it seems to presume a naïve belief in cultural purity, in untouched cultures whose histories\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 33\n\nfigure 1.10.

I make no such presumptions; nonetheless, there must be a way to talk about what the Comaroffs call “the endogenous historicity of local worlds” [ . . . ] in which the pieces of reality, however much borrowed from or imposed by others, are woven together through the logic of a group’s own locally or historically evolved bricolage.81\n\nSuch a perspective is useful in avoiding the pitfalls of a static and romanticized ethnocentrism (what Michael Watts has trenchantly critiqued as the romance of community) that obsesses over spatial fixity rather than mobility and separation rather than connection.82 Rather than lamenting change with an implicit narrative of decline, such an understanding of authenticity works to wrestle with the constant struggle between continuity and change, how it unfolds, and on whose terms. It situates the colonized as subjects and agents of their own history, as active participants in historical time. Jon Parmenter captures the stakes: Persistent conceptions of early American space as a surface upon which Europeans acted and Native peoples reacted have yielded narratives that obscure the contemporaneous temporalities and heterogeneities of space for nonEuropean actors. Such accounts fail to acknowledge the coeval yet vastly different experience of the Iroquois (and other indigenous) peoples. Subordinated to the self-producing narrative of the emergence of the United States, the Iroquois have been denied their own historical trajectories and effectively (though artificially) held still while others have done the moving.83\n\nAs well as being held historically still, so too have non-European actors been held geographically still. For example, despite the fact that Oceania inhabitants were (and are) quite mobile, in the historiography it is the Europeans who do the moving and the Oceania natives who stay in place.84 Movement on their part tends to be read as an indicator of declension, not expansion. It is recognizable state actors who occupy center stage, who move historically and geographically, who act: “the” British, “the” Spanish, “the” French, and so forth. The inexorable logic of manifest destiny leaves little room for nonstate spaces or different imperial spaces. Yet postcontact “indigenous imperialism” is hardly an oxymoron. The Sioux were a dominant power in the northern plains for much of the nineteenth-century, asserting control over spaces where others also lived (the Pawnee, Ponca, Otoe, and Omaha, among others).85 Thus, one might look at the Black Hills Alliance logo-map shown above\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 35\n\nas simultaneously— and not paradoxically— an imperial and anti-imperial representation. Or take Pekka Hamalainen’s recent, trenchant study, which shows in compelling detail how it was in fact the Comanche who were the dominant empire of the south-central plains of North America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, not the European settlers. In a form of what he calls “reverse colonialism,” the Comanche from the period 1750 to 1850 were able to “expand, dictate and prosper, and European colonists [forced to] resist, retreat and struggle to survive.”86 Hence the need for a map of a place of which few have heard: “la Comanchería” (fig. 1.11). Whether because they were fixated on the birth of nations, mired in exceptionalist extravaganzas, or obsessed with the fetishizing of cultural difference, historians have ignored the possibilities that indigenous polities could be imperial, powerful, political— in a word, human— and shape in proactive ways the modern history of North America. In effect, the past has been colonized by an empire of nation-states.87\n\nV. FIVE- S IXTHS OF THE WORLD\n\nHas the present, too, been in some sense colonized by the nation-state? To what degree has the understanding of the nation-state as the antithesis of the colonial state masked a reworking of, rather than an end to, imperial relations? Let me return again to the work of J. F. Horrabin, who, writing in 1937, captured the dilemma succinctly: Modern imperialism . . . does not always proceed by the method of armed conquest and annexation of territory. It has discovered that economic “penetration,” leaving the political independence of the penetrated country nominally intact, is occasionally sufficient for its purposes. In a very real sense, therefore . . . such “penetrated” (and dependent) countries may be accounted colonial possessions of other states. But to have included all these in our catalogue would have been to map five-sixths of the world.88\n\nI share Horrabin’s frustrations. Exactly where to draw the line in examining colonialism and its purported demise is not easy. To expand the definition too far is to make the very concept of “decolonization” analytically anemic. It is to also risk conflating different forms of imperialism and subsequent forms of decolonization. At the same time, to limit the discussion to political independence— and the transition from formal colonial status to formal\n\n36 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.11. Indigenous empire.

It would be, in the pithy words of the authors of a classic statement on the problem, “like judging the size and character of icebergs solely from the parts above the water-line.”89 Independence and decolonization are not necessarily the same thing, and all too often decolonization could take shape as largely\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 37\n\na rearticulation of forms of dependence: that is to say, of forms of colonial power.90 Even the claim of political independence raises questions. After all, colonial holdings were never homogeneously administered or defined. There were “repertoires of imperial power”: dominions, commonwealths, and protectorates were all imperial designations that, to varying degrees, sought to blend subordination and autonomy.91 These may have avoided the most oppressive of colonial relations, but they remained forms of imperial oversight nonetheless and should not be excluded from discussions of decolonization, as historian Anthony Hopkins has persuasively argued.92 The creation of the Commonwealth was in large part meant to sustain beneficial relations of economic assistance and favorable terms of trade in the midst of postwar decolonization.93 But it also provided perhaps a bit of psychological relief for the dislocation generated by empire’s demise. Evoking his childhood in Essex and along the Thames, historian Simon Schama recalled how he would watch “the ships move purposefully out to sea toward all those places colored pink on our wall map at school, where bales of kapok or sisal or cocoa beans waited on some tropical dock so that the Commonwealth (as we had been told to call it) might pretend to live up to its name.”94 Certainly there was much more pink to satisfy the eye on a map of the Commonwealth than there would be on a map of the colonies, as the Colonial Office seems to have concluded. Figure 1.12 shows a map from the 1964 Colonial Office List. Rather than the lonely colonies meagerly scattered on its map of two years earlier (see fig. 1.2), here the image of the global place and reach of England is reasserted by emphasizing the Commonwealth member states. The map, not surprisingly, bears a striking resemblance to those produced around 1910, at the apex of Britain’s imperial reach. A comforting image, perhaps, especially for those who still found in empire much about which to crow.95 The chairman of council of the United Empire Society in 1958 had the following to say when explaining the society’s name change, from the United Empire Society to the Royal Commonwealth Society: “This is an exciting and challenging moment in our history. Our proposed name change is not a retreat from Empire. It is a proud assertion of what British Imperialism has created, namely a great commonwealth of free nations.”96 But of course, not all former colonies were reborn as free nations. Canada’s trajectory from colony to full independence spanned decades, culminating finally in 1982, followed shortly thereafter by the publication, in 1987, of the remarkable Historical Atlas of Canada.97 The point is myriad forms of political life thrive both between and outside the poles of nation-state and colony.\n\n38 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nStewart Firth’s accounting of the status of many island communities in Oceania is revealing: Guam is officially an “organized unincorporated territory” seeking to become a “commonwealth” of the United States; American Samoa is a “US unorganized unincorporated territory”; the Northern Mariana Islands are a US commonwealth that, by many people’s reckoning, is still part of the US Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; Tonga is an independent kingdom; Tokelau is New Zealand territory; the Cook Islands are a self-governing state in free association with New Zealand; Wallis and Futuna are an overseas territory of France; Kiribati is an independent republic; and so on.98\n\nIt would be tempting to see in this a kind of truncated decolonization: that is, to view such myriad political forms cynically, as yet more instantiations of colonial rule reconfigured in such a way so as not to offend enlightened sensibilities. Certainly this is indeed partially the case. The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization as recently as 2009 still considered Guam to be a colony.99 Its history had been wedded to that of other former Spanish possessions which came under the control of the United States in the aftermath of the Spanish-Cuban-American War of 1898 and occupied revealingly peripheral locations on one map in Rand McNally’s postwar Imperial Atlas (fig. 1.13). What to do with such possessions, and their populations, proved a thorny issue for the self-described “empire of liberty.” In the case of Puerto Rico, the Supreme Court, in a moment of inspired verbal gymnastics, determined that the populace of newly acquired Puerto Rico was “foreign [ . . . ] in a domestic sense.”100 To this day the status of many former colonial possessions in the Pacific remains complicated. Many have been and continue to be defined by the strategic military objectives of their former masters: Japan, France, the United States, and, to a lesser degree, England. Cold War concerns of the United States ensured that archipelagoes such as Micronesia would not garner full independence but rather a kind of loose autonomy— a Compact of Free Association— overseen by the strategic needs of the United States, even if the US secretary of war insisted that the islands “are not colonies; they are outposts” (fig. 1.14).101 But such a position should not be held without some measure of recognition for the voices of the formerly colonized themselves, who thought carefully and critically about the positives and negatives of full political independence.

Similar debates characterize parts of Oceania that were formerly under\n\n40 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.12.

Indeed, at the very height of decolonization, in the 1950s and 1960s, intellectuals in parts of Africa and Latin America began to write of neocolonialism, questioning the determinations of what constituted the end of colonial rule through the lens of international political economy. Was it purely an issue of political self-determination and formal structures of political power? Had colonial rule collapsed with the flight of the colonial powers? To what degree had national autonomy severed the unequal relationship of dependency between metropole and periphery, or north and south, or colonizer and colonized? How could, for example, the promise of self-determination be fulfilled if confronted with the strategic threat of capital flight?105 Critics of capitalism\n\n42 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.14.

Thus, even as colonial empires crumbled, a variety of voices argued that the demise of colonialism might be called into question by the persistence of capitalism. Within Latin America intellectuals such as Raúl Prebisch (1946), Andre Gunder Frank (1967), Eduardo Galeano (1971), and Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Enzo Faletto (1969) generated historical analyses and interpretations that offered trenchant explanations for a world still deeply colonized by tracing historical networks and spatial grids of capitalist dependency, in the process highlighting the structural relationship between “development” and “underdevelopment.”106 That such perspectives came out of Latin America is no surprise. There, despite a century of formal political independence, countries had struggled to free themselves of the yoke of European and, increasingly, US economic and political power.107 So much so, in fact, that Frantz Fanon invoked Latin\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 43\n\nAmerica’s historical experience in his writings on Algerian decolonization: “The national bourgeoisie of certain underdeveloped countries has learned nothing from books. If they had looked closer at the Latin American countries they doubtless would have recognized the dangers which threaten them.”108 To be clear, there was no “scramble for Latin America” comparable to the “scramble for Africa,” in which European powers annexed and carved up the continent.109 Even so, politically freed from colonial rule, Latin American statesmen and elites had to contend (or ally themselves) with new imperial formations, namely, British and subsequently US commercial hegemony and its attendant political machinations and occasional interventions. Despite the US-issued Monroe Doctrine of 1823, it was initially the British who were most powerful in “postcolonial” Spanish America. They owned the large homes in many of Spanish America’s primary cities; maintained men-of-war off the coasts of various nation-states to protect their commerce; negotiated the best treaties of friendship, commerce, and navigation with newly emergent nationstates in return for political recognition; and mapped the lands and resources to which they would informally lay claim. Indeed, the musings of a British foreign secretary in 1824 were both prescient and a cogent summation of the state of things: “Spanish America is free, and if we do not mismanage our affairs sadly, she is English.”110 And to some degree “she” was, at least until the latter half of the nineteenth century when US hegemony grew substantially in the hemisphere. US hemispheric hegemony brought with it a more recognizably colonial set of relations at times, most dramatically with the Spanish-Cuban-American War of 1898, the subsequent occupation of Cuba and the Spanish Pacific, and the annexation of Puerto Rico. US readers followed the paths of empire in an array of cartographic and ethnographic publications— with revealing titles such as the American Colonial Handbook and Our Islands and Their People— assembled to help the populace assimilate these new possessions.111 Roosevelt’s 1904 Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, which legitimized US intervention in Latin American countries to protect business interests or collect debts, drew on the language of paternalism and barbarism in affirming the neocolonial relationship. So too did Roosevelt’s secretary of state, Elihu Root. The two hemispheres complemented each other, he noted: the people in the south needed North American manufactures, and North Americans needed the south’s raw materials. “Where we accumulate,” remarked Root, “they spend. While we have less of the cheerful philosophy which finds happiness in the existing conditions of life, they have less of the inventive faculty which strives continually\n\n44 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nfigure 1.15.

US imperial aspirations affected other countries in the hemisphere in more subtle, if just as important, ways. Mexico, for example, could never shrug off its proximity to the northern colossus, and patterns of US development and investment exercised substantial influence in the country. Mexico’s revolution (1910–1920) was one that in some ways sought to surpass the limits imposed by the geopolitical and economic realities of early globalization and the age of empire.112 Revolutionaries sought not only political change but also the elim-\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 45\n\nfigure 1.16.

But they also sought to curtail the influence of foreign capital, investment, and ownership in the country. Foreign capital’s presence was manifest in the north, where owners and managers settled, intermarried, and hobnobbed with regional elites. In the Yucatán Peninsula, such presence was more latent but felt nonetheless. Much of Mexico’s populace carried with it histories and memories of repeated foreign interventions, by the US military, Napoleon III’s troops, and gringo Rangers, among others. “Neocolonial” is too strong a term for the relationship, but the perception of foreign control and influence existed nonetheless.113 The revolutionary governments, in an assertion of sovereignty, assumed control over all mineral and subsoil rights and maintained the right to expropriate\n\n46 ·\n\nRaymond B. cRaIB\n\nforeign companies. They also engaged in a far-reaching agrarian reform. In all of this, maps were crucial, and the revolutionary state hastened to train a new generation of land surveyors and agronomists loyal to the state and its revolutionary project. Along with rural schoolteachers, surveyors and agronomists became the pivotal figures in a new era characterized by its cultural and economic nationalism, as can be discerned from their presence in much postrevolutionary nationalist art (fig. 1.16).114 Other revolutions followed, revolutions that might be situated within the language of anticolonialism or national liberation.115 Guatemala’s democratic aperture and October Revolution of the 1940s, and the agrarian reform law 900 passed by Jacobo Árbenz in 1952, sought to put an end to the egregious and arbitrary power of an entire class of agrarian lords, led by the US-based United Fruit Company. While there was little in terms of foreign enterprises to expropriate, the reforms to land and mining in Bolivia in the early 1950s were justified in part by President Victor Paz Estenssoro as the beginning of the end to four hundred years of oppression.116 During the 1959 overthrow of Fulgencio Batista’s US-coddled regime in Cuba, revolutionaries self-consciously evoked the anticolonial insurgencies of a half century prior. Such revolutions occurred in tandem with, and drew inspiration from, anticolonial insurrections elsewhere, building on an earlier transcontinental precedent set in 1927 in Brussels with the first meeting of the League Against Imperialism (attendees included future leaders of independence movements from around the globe as well as a number of Latin American intellectuals, such as Víctor Rául Haya de la Torre, from Peru, and the Mexican José Vasoncelos, who spoke on behalf of Puerto Rico.)117 Such efforts after World War II ran parallel to, and often up against, newfangled attempts to create structures that would ensure a system of free trade and capitalist longevity— structures, such as the United Nations, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund, that effectively proved Karl Polanyi’s point that the invisible hand of the free market depends on the long arm of state intervention.118 They also confronted a bipolar world in which the Soviet Union and the United States sought to shape the political and economic relations of countries in order to ensure control over and access to a range of primary resources, without being encumbered by formal colonial rule.119 Thus, Mohammad Mossadeq’s attempted nationalization of oil in Iran and Jacobo Árbenz’s agrarian reform efforts in Guatemala both met with an increasingly common form of Cold War neocolonial response: CIA-sponsored coups d’état (1953 and 1954, respectively) and the imposition of authoritarian regimes committed to protecting foreign direct investment and the interests of foreign\n\ncaRtogRaphy and decolonIzatIon\n\n· 47\n\nfigure 1.17a.
