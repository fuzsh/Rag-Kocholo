Each one focused on building long-term campaigns that targeted my company's prospects and interrupted them to pay attention to a message. I would not hire those agencies today. In the alwayson 24/7 world of the web, buyers use search engines and social media to look for products themselves and at their convenience. At the same time,\n\nthe lines between PR and marketing have blurred to be unrecognizable. It's time for a new type of agency, one built to take advantage of the communications revolution, one that helps companies get in front of buyers when they are ready and eager to engage. In his engaging Marketing Agency Blueprint, Paul Roetzer shows you how to transform your firm to thrive in the real-time world we live in today.”\n\n–David Meerman Scott, Bestselling author of The New Rules of Marketing & PR “It's about time. There have been countless websites, books, and events for marketers to adapt to the current marketing revolution, but never one for agencies and service providers. Well, this is it. The Marketing Agency Blueprint is a must-read for any group or individual providing marketing services to clients.” –Joe Pulizzi, Founder, Content Marketing Institute “Paul Roetzer's The Marketing Agency Blueprint paints a clear picture for the inevitable transformation of twenty-first century marketers, and then lays out a succinct roadmap for others to follow. If your goal is not just to survive, but to thrive and gain a competitive advantage in the midst of new media realities, this may just become your new marketing bible.”\n\n–Dustin S. Klein, Publisher and executive editor, Smart Business Magazines & Events; Coauthor/contributing editor,\n\nThe Benevolent Dictator “I've worked with Paul for more than 10 years, and am continually impressed with his vision and drive. My faith in him and his agency led me to take a risk and evolve my marketing efforts. I am an old-school numbers guy, and the proof is in the results. What Roetzer presents in The Marketing Agency Blueprint is the future of the marketing services industry.”\n\n–Kenneth Paine, CEO, Industrial Heat Sources and Hy-Tech Products “Marketing has gone through a massive transformation. This creates a significant opportunity for agencies. Millions of organizations need help in navigating these new, fast-moving waters. The Marketing Agency Blueprint is a practical, insider's guide that should be required reading for anyone building the next-generation marketing services firm.”\n\n–Dharmesh Shah, Cofounder and CTO, HubSpot “Inbound marketing ranks among the most powerful, quiet trends of the last decade. Paul's experienced this change firsthand and writes eloquently and actionably on how marketers and businesses of all stripes can earn amazing returns by investing in the channels of search, social, and content.”\n\n–Rand Fishkin, CEO, SEOmoz “Paul Roetzer is a young lion of marketing who realized early on how technology and new media make the traditional agency model as dated as an episode from Mad Men. Roetzer champions marketing as an evolving discipline where value creation is the basis of success. He sees modern marketing as a marriage of talent and analytics. The result is cost-effective delivery of great marketing that can level the playing field between large and small competitors. His ideas are proven through practical application in the marketing agency he founded. Roetzer's book is a seminal view of how marketing services can and will be delivered in the future. It is a must-read for the next generation of marketing professionals–and the customers they serve.”\n\n–Gary Christy, Brand Leader, Westfield Insurance\n\nCopyright©2012 by Paul Roetzer.

And to my wife, Cheryl, whose patience and unwavering support have made it possible for me to follow my dreams.\n\nForeword When I started HubSpot in June 2006 with my business partner, Dharmesh Shah, our experiences with marketing agencies led us to almost entirely avoid working with them. In fact, we designed our original business model around selling our marketing software directly to end customers, and developed an internal marketing team that would not be dependent on agency assistance. Our decision to circumvent marketing agencies did not result from questioning their skills or capabilities, but rather from their failure to acknowledge the impending shifts in consumer behavior. I felt as though many marketing agencies were, and still are, trying to cling onto the Mad Men marketing methodology. They want to sit in rich mahogany corner offices with 21-year-old scotch on ice, and brood over their grandiose and flowery advertisement campaigns. They rely too heavily on traditional outbound marketing techniques, such as television advertisements and cold calling, which allow them to safely distance themselves from the nitty-gritty operations side of marketing and direct contact with the end consumer. However, the detached Don Drapers of the marketing world cannot simply rely on creating deep and lofty brand awareness campaigns any longer. Consumers have now assumed control over their purchasing processes. With the help of devices like DVRs, satellite radio, and caller ID, consumers no longer tolerate irritating outbound marketing efforts designed to interrupt their daily lives. Instead, they know what they want to purchase, and strongly object to businesses that try to force-feed them messages. With millions of Internet pages at their fingertips, consumers actively research their own product information online. They contribute to forums, follow industry thought leaders on Twitter, and even write their own blogs about products and services. By filtering the excessive marketing clutter produced by outbound techniques, the Internet has changed consumers’ buying behaviors in ways we never thought possible. Because of this dramatic shift, we believed that it was time for marketing agencies to concentrate on providing inbound marketing strategies to their clients. As Dharmesh and I explained in our book, Inbound Marketing, this involves creating an integrated online process that uses original content to provide educational and salient advice to consumers, helping them with their purchasing decisions. These “hybrid” agencies—as Paul coins them—could help clients develop original content (blog posts, whitepapers, etc.) that would attract interested and engaged prospects, who would begin to associate and rely on those businesses as active thought leaders in their respective industries. This would significantly bolster the client's online reputation through indexed pages and inbound links, leading to an increased level of website traffic. With systems in place to track the progress of their inbound marketing campaigns, these agencies would be able to adapt strategy based on solid metrics to ensure improvements over time. Agencies like PR 20/20 are the breaths of fresh air for which the marketing world has been gasping. Although he started his agency to specialize in traditional PR and marketing services, Paul possessed the foresight to see the inevitable shifts of the business world. He was brave enough to make the switch to an inbound-oriented strategy early, and executed it perfectly. Unlike the mad men of today, Paul became the marketing Renaissance man; he understood that marketing consultants could not succeed as one-trick (or in this case, service) ponies, and that collaborations with companies like ours would lead to excellence. When he joined the HubSpot movement in October 2007, he voraciously consumed all things HubSpot. By 2008, Paul became one of our most adept product users, and PR 20/20 became the first agency to join our Value Added Reseller (VAR) program. All of this work, driven by a hunger for knowledge and drive to innovate, added up to incredibly significant gains for PR 20/20. Starting as a oneman shop in late 2005, Paul now employs 10 dedicated employees. What is even more impressive is that, through testing its methodologies on itself, PR 20/20 grew revenue by nearly 500 percent in just four years; increased its average website visits from less than 1,000 per month to more than 8,000; boosted blog subscriptions by 1,400 percent; and has totaled 12,000 inbound links and more than 900 indexed pages. In addition to these successes, the agency has also perfected its inbound marketing service offerings for clients. In 2010, PR 20/20 launched the industry's first service packages that bundled website development, brand marketing, search marketing, social media, content marketing, and public relations for a set monthly fee.\n\nTo truly drive change in the industry, Paul understood that it was necessary to educate and improve the marketing-services world at large. He became one of HubSpot's leading inbound marketing evangelists, and began speaking nationwide on topics including blogging, content marketing, social media, and inbound marketing strategy. With the help and support from agency partners like PR 20/20, the HubSpot VAR program now accounts for 20 percent of our sales revenue. Based on demand, we are forecasting that our revenue from agencies will be 40 percent by the second quarter of 2012. We now take tremendous pride in working with savvy marketing agencies that not only purchase HubSpot for their clients, but also frequently for themselves. With more than 170,000 marketing agency contacts in the HubSpot database, we have high hopes that many more agencies will fully embrace the inbound marketing methodology, and believe that these agencies will be the next generation of Madison Avenue marketing all-stars. As Paul explains, these hybrid agencies will master a new kind of business model, where a sales team, software tools, refined business infrastructure, and new marketing processes all work in unison to support the marketing agency's core consulting services. In a time when others were unwilling to accept the apparent shifts in the marketing services industry, Paul's commitment to changing the course of his agency, and the agency world at large, is incredibly commendable and truly impressive. This book is particularly special because you will read about Paul's personal experiences as a business owner and marketer, rather than try to decipher the ideological musings from some business scholar or analyst. No matter the maturity of your agency, Paul comprehensibly dissects his success so that you can replicate it. All professionals in the marketing-services field should read this book because it clarifies the confusion around the roles and responsibilities of marketing agencies in an inbound marketing world. The marketing-services industry is at a turning point where an agency must choose whether to, as Paul states, “disrupt or be disrupted.” So the question now is, which side will you choose?\n\n—Brian Halligan CEO and cofounder, HubSpot\n\nAcknowledgments In 2005, at the age of 27, I became an entrepreneur in pursuit of a better way. My business partner, Larry Ondercin, believed in me enough to fund the startup phase, and four months later we hired our first employee, Christina Capadona Schmitz (@christinacs), who took a chance and bought into a vision when I was still working out of coffee shops. We assembled an amazing team of highly motivated professionals, and created a culture that refused to accept traditional wisdom and conventional solutions. The Marketing Agency Blueprint would not be possible without the entire PR 20/20 team—Christina, Keith Moehring (@keithmoehring), Laurel Miltner (@laurelmackenzie), Tracy DiMarino (@TracyDiMarino), Dia Dalsky (@DiaDalsky), Christy Hajoway (@ChristyBarks), Jessica Donlon (@JessicaDonlon) and Laura Pinter (@lipinter). Their work, commitment, sacrifice, and friendship mean the world to me. The book also has been inspired by countless people, some of whom I know personally, and others whose work, writings, and teachings I have admired through the years. It would be impossible to recognize them all, but here are some of the entrepreneurs, professionals, authors, and teachers who have influenced my life, business, and writing. Chris Brogan Clayton M.

Tellis Fred Wilson Sergio Zyman\n\nIntroduction We are on the cusp of a truly transformational period in the marketing- services industry. The old guard, rooted in tradition and resistant to change, will fall and new leaders will emerge. The industry will be redefined by marketing agencies that are more nimble, tech savvy, open, and collaborative. Digital services will be ingrained into the DNA of every agency, and blended with traditional methods to execute integrated campaigns. Agencies will create and nurture diverse recurring revenue streams through a mix of services, consulting, training, education, publishing, and software sales. They will use efficiency and productivity, not billable hours, as the essential drivers of profitability. Their value and success will be measured by outcomes, not outputs. Their strength and stability will depend on their willingness to be in a perpetual state of change, and an ability to execute and adapt faster than competitors. The depth, versatility, and drive of their talent will be the cornerstones of organizations that pursue a higher purpose. This is the future of the marketing-services industry. A future defined and led by underdogs and innovators. You have the opportunity to be at the forefront of the transformation.\n\nThe Origin In February 2004, I came to a life-changing realization—the marketing- agency model was broken and had been for years. Although I was only four years into my career at that time, a number of contributing factors had become obvious to me: Billable hours were inefficient at best. Professionals were more worried about meeting hour quotas than delivering the level of service and quality needed to produce measurable results for clients. There was little differentiation between firms, and a lack of innovation within the industry. Training and education were stagnant. Firms and universities were teaching the same systems, principles, and services that had been applied for decades. Request for proposals (RFPs) were a waste of time and energy, for both clients and agencies. Standard measurement systems, such as press clippings, impressions, reach, ad equivalency, and PR value were meaningless, and they had no real connection to bottom-line results. The industry was ripe for disruption.\n\nThe Opportunity to Emerge Fast-forward to today, and many of the same challenges exist. Traditional firms—public relations (PR), advertising, search engine optimization (SEO), and web—are fighting to remain relevant by grasping for new services, such as social, mobile, and content, rather than focusing on what really matters, including pricing, technology, staffing, infrastructure, processes, and purpose. As a result, there are unparalleled opportunities for emerging agencies and consultants to transform, disrupt, and thrive within the developing marketing services ecosystem. The agencies and professionals with the will and vision to adapt and evolve will rise, and many traditional and digital-only firms will become obsolete.\n\nCauses for Change The forces that are fueling transformation can be narrowed down to three primary catalysts—change velocity, selective consumption, and success factors—which we will explore throughout the book:\n\nChange Velocity The rate of change, continually accelerated by technology innovations, has created growing demand for tech-savvy, forward-thinking firms. Specifically, trends and shifts in consumer behavior, business processes, software, data analysis, communications, and marketing philosophies have affected the need for evolved services and consulting. Consider the impact and meteoric rise of cloud computing, virtualization, social networking, mobility, and group buying as examples. We live in a real-time world, which demands real-time agencies. Although change velocity presents challenges, it also provides significant advancement opportunities. Technology has made it possible to create remarkably efficient agency management and client services systems that lower operating costs, while increasing productivity and profitability. Agencies have access to a wealth of reliable software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms in the areas of time tracking, project management, customer-relationship management (CRM), lead nurturing, website content-management systems (CMS), sales, accounting, data storage, campaign management, monitoring, analytics, enterprise social networks, virtual meetings, and communications. Not only does this reduce the barrier to entry, but it makes it possible for emerging firms to more quickly compete with, and usurp, slower traditional firms.\n\nSelective Consumption\n\nSelective consumption is the basic principle behind inbound marketing, the philosophy made popular by HubSpot, a fast-rising Internet marketing software company. In essence, consumers are tuning out traditional, interruption-based marketing methods, and choosing when and where to interact with brands. They are conducting billions of Internet searches each month, downloading case studies and ebooks, opting into e-mail newsletters, watching online videos, listening to podcasts, following brands and professionals on social networks, joining online communities, posting product reviews, and reading blogs, and they are increasingly doing it all from their mobile devices. As a result, business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) organizations in every industry are shifting budgets away from print advertising, trade shows, cold calling, and direct mail toward more measurable and effective inbound marketing strategies that cater to consumer needs. Savvy firms are capitalizing on the shift by expanding and integrating their service offerings in the areas of search, mobile, social, content, analytics, web, PR, digital advertising, and e-mail marketing. They also are diversifying revenue streams and driving new business through affiliate relationships and value-added reseller (VAR) partnerships with marketing software companies.\n\nSuccess Factors Marketing campaigns are not about winning awards for creative, building the flashiest websites, gaming Google for higher rankings, generating mounds of media coverage, or negotiating the lowest cost per thousand (CPM) in order to interrupt the largest audience. The job of a marketing agency is to produce results that impact the bottom line. It's that simple. Although traditional marketing firms rely on impressions, reach, advertising equivalency, PR value, and other arbitrary measurements of success, marketing firms now have the ability to consistently produce more meaningful outcomes—inbound links, search engine rankings, click-through rates, website traffic, landing page conversions, content downloads, blog subscribers, and leads—that can be tracked in real time and directly correlated to sales. These success factors are how firms should and will be judged.\n\nAccelerating Transformation I have spent more than seven years building a new agency model at PR 20/20 because I passionately believe there is a better way. We have worked closely with technology companies such as HubSpot to develop more results-driven services and more efficient processes, drawn on the teachings of industry luminaries such as David Meerman Scott (@dmscott), and been influenced by the business models of innovative organizations such as Apple, Google, Salesforce, and 37Signals. We are far from perfect, and we certainly do not have all the answers, but it is time we share what we have learned in order to accelerate change. This is not a book about who we are, but rather what I believe we, as marketing agencies, have the potential to be. The Marketing Agency Blueprint presents 10 rules for building tech-savvy, hybrid agencies that are more efficient, influential, and profitable than traditional firms, and, most importantly, are capable of delivering greater results and value to clients. The book explores lessons learned building PR 20/20, and draws on my own experiences working in a traditional marketing firm. It also integrates knowledge and resources from the leaders and innovators who are transforming the marketing-services industry.\n\nThe Value Imperative The Marketing Agency Blueprint, with its supporting resources at www.MarketingAgencyInsider.com, is designed to help entrepreneurs build their agencies and futures, and stimulate a more open and collaborative agency ecosystem. One of my favorite quotes, which has come to encapsulate my philosophy on business and life, is from Tim O'Reilly (@timoreilly), founder of O'Reilly Media, “Create more value than you capture.”1 That is exactly what I hope to accomplish with this book. I encourage you to connect with me on Twitter (@paulroetzer), and join the Marketing Agency Insider community on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook. Together, we can transform an industry.

This term, coined by Harvard professor and bestselling author Clayton Christensen (@claychristensen), and commonly talked about in technology circles, is a very real issue for marketing agencies. According to Christensen, disruptive innovation, “describes a process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves ‘up market,’ eventually displacing established competitors.”1 Disruptive innovation is already happening in the marketing-services industry, and it is going to change everything, including pricing and service models, measurement methods, tools and platforms, higher education, industry accreditation, marketing budgets, organization charts, and career paths. Think about the firms coming up that have superior knowledge and capabilities in the high-demand areas of search, mobile, content, and social. Do you think the status quo is sustainable for traditional marketing firms? The upstarts and innovators may not immediately attack the core larger enterprise markets sought after by the big agencies, but before you know it, the collective ecosystem of emerging agencies will have built a diverse and collaborative empire that will shift the power in the industry. Then, it is only a matter of time. Whether you are an emerging agency seeking to disrupt or a traditional firm on the wrong end of the impending evolution, here are several things to remember about disruptive innovation: Disruptive business characteristics include: lower gross margins, smaller target markets, and simpler products and services. It often comes from the outside, and once you realize what is happening, it is probably too late. Success requires an uncommon tolerance for risk and a desire to embrace the unknown. Victory favors those who are bold and decisive in their actions. Traditional agencies that are slow to adapt will fail, and many existing industry experts will become irrelevant. This will be good for the industry. Unparalleled opportunities will arise for marketing agencies and professionals, and new career paths will be defined. The underdogs and innovators will become the leaders. Pricing strategy is a key component to disruption. Agencies motivated to change will shift away from the inefficient legacy system of billable hours, and move to more results-driven, value-based models accessible to the mass market. This presents the opportunity for agencies and independent consultants to disrupt the industry with lower prices, and potentially higher profit margins.\n\nA Broken System I started my career in the marketing industry at a traditional PR firm. In those days (1999–2005) we charged a flat rate of $125 per hour, and billed in quarter-hour increments. The flat rate meant that clients paid the same hourly rate for my work as they did for time logged by our most senior personnel. This was easier to track and report internally (when people actually completed their timesheets) than a tiered hourly rate, but from a client's perspective, I always struggled to understand how paying a junior associate and a senior executive the same $125 per hour made any sense. Where is the value in that? Then again, I also never bought into the tiered-rate model. Even today I cannot comprehend how firms justify charging upward of $964 per hour for a senior executive's time, which, according to the 2009 American Association of Advertising Agencies (4A), was an average rate for large U.S.-agency chief creative officers.2 Even more shocking to me is that there are corporations willing to pay those excessive fees. This is the core issue of what I call the salary-rate fallacy.\n\nThe Salary-Rate Fallacy A standard formula used by agencies to determine billing rates is to apply a salary multiple, commonly a factor of two or three. According to communications industry consultants StevensGouldPincus, the most profitable PR firms should target 35 percent of revenue for base salaries, and 50 percent of revenue for total labor costs, including salaries, bonuses, and freelance/outsourced labor. 3 So, in theory, if employees generate three times their base salaries in revenue, then firms will fall within target profitability ranges. Firms may use variations when determining hourly rates, and take additional factors into account, but a simple salary multiple enables them to account for overhead expenses and employee compensation, while leaving room for net profit margins. Target net profit margins vary greatly based on agency size, growth rate, and life stage, but, most likely, they will fall in the range of 10 to 25 percent, depending on which benchmark report you reference. In order to understand the deficiencies of this approach, let's take a look at an example of how an agency professional's hourly rate would be calculated using a 3× multiple. In this scenario, we will assume the professional's production rate, or the time he is billable, is approximately 57 percent (or 100 hours per month). The remaining 43 percent of nonrevenue-generating time may be accounted for through administrative tasks, account management, business development, professional development, and networking. Here is how it breaks down:\n\nAssuming there are 1,200 hours of billable work to be done in the year, this formula seems easy enough, and makes financial sense, at least for the agency. The problem is that the formula is completely agency driven. It is tied exclusively to outputs, not outcomes, and assumes that all agency activities—account management, client communications, writing, planning, consulting, creative—are of equal value. Thus, the fallacy: A marketing agency executive making X ($150,000) per year is worth Y ($375) per hour. The fact is that the amount a professional is paid does not have a direct correlation to the quality or value of the services they provide, especially when you consider the impact of change velocity, selective consumption, and success factors, which were discussed in the introduction. And yet, we have an entire industry built on this pricing concept. Maybe the executive's time is worth $375 per hour to build advertising creative or to consult on crisis communications situations, if that is what he built his career and salary on, but now client needs are rapidly evolving (change velocity). They are demanding different services (selective consumption) and measuring return on investment (ROI) in new ways (success factors). Clients are willing to pay a premium for experience and knowledge they do not have, but the unfortunate reality is that young professionals, who have grown up in a digital world, may be more qualified to provide consulting and services in high-demand areas such as social media, SEO, and mobile. It is almost a reverse of how the industry has traditionally worked. Clients would pay for inefficiencies of junior account executives while they learned the craft and gained experiences, but the labor and hourly rates were cheap. Now clients pay for the inefficiencies of senior executives to learn the digital game, but their hourly rates are not coming down. In addition, as costs increase to run and grow the agency, including rising employee salaries, there are only two obvious options to maintain or increase profits: (1) raise hourly rates or (2) demand professionals work more hours, neither of which creates greater value for clients. The salary-rate fallacy is the core reason that billable hours are a broken system. Unfortunately for many traditional firms, it is the basis for their financial structure and incredibly difficult to change. Even for firms working off retainers, rather than project-based hourly rates, in order for the agreements to make financial sense, retainers still must be based on an estimated number of service hours using the hourly rate formula. For example, if an agency has a $5,000 per month retainer, the number of hours that will be dedicated to the account each month could look like this:\n\nIf the agency exceeds its monthly allotment, they either absorb the losses or request more budget. The other, less desirable options are to push more hours to cheaper junior staff with less experience, record the time against other projects with available budgets, or make it up by shorting time spent on the account during the next month. In other words, traditional retainers do not really solve what is wrong with billable hours.\n\nThe Cost of Inefficiency To further explore the challenges of the billable-hour model, consider the case of a press release. What do you think a press release is worth? The correct answer, like any product or service in a free market, is whatever a client is willing to pay. However, in the traditional model, the cost comes down to two primary factors: hourly rate and the producer's efficiency. So let's examine the practical application of billable hours in an agency.\n\nScenario 1 Professional A is an assistant account executive and an exceptional copywriter who requires minimal oversight. She is assigned a press release that will be distributed on a national wire service. She completes a strong original draft that is reviewed internally with no edits, and it is then quickly approved by the client. As a result, the cost is relatively straightforward.\n\nScenario 2 Now let's look at what happens to the price had Professional B, who also has an hourly rate of $150, been assigned the same press release. Although she wrote a few releases in college, this is her first real-world project. In addition to her raw writing skills, Professional B is easily distracted. She is addicted to her Twitter stream and has e-mail alerts that pop up every two minutes, so she rarely focuses on her tasks for\n\nextended periods. As a result, she takes a bit longer than Professional A, and the quality is subpar, requiring multiple revision rounds before it even goes to the client for approval. The cost for the first draft:\n\nHowever, we are not done yet. We also need to account for the one hour of a senior associate's time to edit and revise the original draft, 15 minutes to review the edits with Professional B, 30 minutes for Professional B to make the edits, and another 30 minutes for the senior associate to edit and approve the final version. Oh, and the senior associate's hourly rate is $250 an hour. So, the final cost looks like this:\n\nThere is zero added value for the release from Professional B, yet, the client pays nearly three times more for the exact same deliverable. The client is actually penalized, and forced to pay for the agency's inefficiency and professional development. The model is broken.\n\nInefficiency Factors There are countless factors that can affect a professional's efficiency, but distractions, time tracking, and motivation are three of the biggest culprits.\n\nDistractions Marketing agency professionals are multitaskers. At any given moment, they are connected through an array of channels competing for their attention—Twitter, Facebook, Internet, TV, chat, e-mail, phone, text, Skype, Intranet—not to mention face-to-face time and meetings. In essence, they are always distracted or anticipating distraction, and, therefore, they are never performing at their peak and never achieving flow. Yet clients are expected to pay full hourly rates when, in reality, professionals rarely are focused solely on the project at hand. I know if I were paying someone for their creative work, I would rather they spent 60 uninterrupted minutes straight on my project than 60 minutes over three hours with calls, e-mails, tweets, and instant messages in between. I will take efficiency with higher levels of creativity and attention every time. Distractions lead to higher costs and lower quality.\n\nTime Tracking Time tracking is not exact by any means. Although agencies and professionals may have the best of intentions for accuracy, it is easy to accidentally leave the meter running or even to forget to start the meter as you battle distractions and jump from one project to the next. As a result, it is common to estimate or round your time in logical increments. This means clients commonly pay for time that never happened. A five-minute phone call tracked as 15 minutes may not be a big deal once, but multiply that out over a 12-month campaign, and you are looking at hours of wasted time and money. Plus, professionals responsible for billable-hour quotas certainly do not want to miss any client time, so they try to account for every activity, no matter how mundane. This time adds up and can eventually start to take valuable hours away from more meaningful and measurable work. My experience was that, over time, clients would often avoid calling, or even stop keeping us in the loop on key strategic discussions because they did not want to incur the charges for us to have a chat or read and compose an e-mail. So agencies make a few dollars to fulfill billable-hour goals, but lose out on long-term opportunities. This is the type of shortsighted thinking that will doom agencies.\n\nMotivation There is little motivation for agencies or their professionals to complete work more efficiently. The value of employees to an agency, and, therefore, their ability to advance and build wealth, is directly tied to how many hours they log and how many of those hours actually get billed to clients. As a result, professionals often are more worried about meeting hour quotas or staying within monthly retainer limits than they are with delivering the level of service and quality needed to produce measurable results for clients. Going back to the press-release example, which professional looks better on paper based on the standard model? Professional A, who finished the release in three hours for $450, or Professional B, who took more than seven hours with the help of her supervisor for a cost of $1,262.50? Well, if the client had the budget available to allow for the inefficiency, Professional B comes out ahead and the client never knows the difference. Low-quality work should not cost the client more, but that is exactly what happens. Either that or the agency eats time as professional development, but that is not something most agencies are eager to do. Just think what an agency could accomplish, and how much value it could bring to its clients, if it rewarded professionals for retention and growth of accounts, rather than how many hours they bill in a year.\n\nThe Power of Transparency There is a certain mystery to billable hours and agency services. Clients are not always sure exactly what they are getting or what it costs. This works for agencies because billable hours are an imperfect mix of art and science, and as long as the agency produces results, clients are happy. However, there are those times when things do not go so smoothly. Maybe the client anticipated a return on investment sooner, does not feel like\n\nthe account is getting enough attention, or is just too demanding and unrealistic. There is also the possibility that the agency may have slightly overpromised to win the business and just cannot deliver to the expectation levels that were set. All of a sudden, invoices are being scrutinized a little more closely. The client's chief financial officer (CFO) takes a keen interest in the growing monthly expense, and now the chief marketing officer (CMO) has to explain the value of the agency to his executive team. The problem is that he has no idea. After four months at $10,000 per month, he has invoices full of activities but nothing tangible to share with his bosses to justify the relationship. The mysterious nature of billable hours is not that much fun for either party at this point. Now the agency team has to invest nonbillable (in theory) hours reviewing and explaining invoices, and scrambling to demonstrate some meaningful and measurable impact they have had. Even though both sides entered the engagement with the best of intentions, the relationship becomes tenuous, and time and energy that should be focused on producing outcomes is diverted to saving the account. This scenario, which played out continuously over my first five years in the industry, was a primary motivating factor in my desire to create a different agency model. I became obsessed with the idea of making services tangible with clearly defined costs, features, and benefits, almost like buying a product off a retail shelf or signing up for a software service. My theory was that, if clients understood exactly what they were getting and agreed ahead of time what it was worth, then we could remove the mystery from the equation and focus on delivering value and results. Transparency would build trust, remove the friction from the client-agency relationship, and make it simpler to sell services to the mass market. The problem was that the billable-hours model was the only one I had ever known. How would I build an entirely new financial model and productize a service business?\n\nThe Move to Standardized Services and Set Pricing My solution was to standardize services, and apply set prices based on a number of variables. In essence, I believed it was possible to achieve economies of scale in the production and delivery of services, much like a manufacturing company does with products. If we could lower the cost of services over time by improving efficiency, then, in theory, we could increase profits, possibly even above industry benchmarks. Set prices would enable us to bundle services into packages designed to fit specific market segments, such as franchise owners, and it would dramatically reduce time spent building new business and account development proposals. Plus, we would be able to make marketing agency services more affordable and effective to the underserviced market of small businesses in the United States and around the world. Everyone wins. It seemed so obvious, but I had no idea how to actually build a financially viable business model. So I set out on a 21-month journey from February 2004 to November 2005 to make it happen.\n\nValue-Based Pricing I took the approach that if you can define the scope, which is possible with nearly every marketing agency service, then you can standardize the service and assign a set price. Although some services, such as website projects and marketing plans, are more complex than others, the vast majority of agency services can be standardized by clearly defining the scope of what is to be done.\n\nSample Standardized Service Standardized services, such as the following case-study example, commonly include description, features, benefits, and set price: Provide prospects and customers with powerful examples of how your products or services deliver value and results. Case studies are ideal website content for your visitors, make great marketing and sales tools, and can be used as editorial submissions. What Makes a Good Case Study?\n\nSatisfied, recent customer. Unique or high-profile application (company, product, event, etc.). Clearly defined challenge and solution. Impressive, quantifiable results. Innovative or customized solution. Hi-res photos available. Customer resources willing and able to be interviewed. Limited legal concerns with trade secrets/proprietary information disclosure. Story highlights key product/service benefits (speed, efficiency, productivity, profitability). What's Included? Following a standard outline of challenge, solution, and results, PR 20/20's professional marketing copywriters will craft a case study for publishing on your corporate website, blog, or media room. Approximately 700 words. Optimized with priority keywords and written with buyer personas’ key needs in mind. Additional fees apply for graphic design and strategic planning if you plan to use case studies in print or PDF form as sales support. Average turnaround: 15–20 business days.\n\nPrice = $1,000.\n\nThe guiding principle was that set prices had to be value based, meaning they were to be determined based on perceived and actual value rather than the number of billable hours something takes to complete. So if a trifold brochure was priced at $2,500, then it did not matter if it took 15 or 35 hours to produce, the client would pay $2,500. The burden was on the agency to build systems and processes, and put the right talent in place, to profitably deliver at the set price. In the traditional billable-hour model, the basic formula to determine cost is hourly rate × billable hours. It is simple, but as we have seen it is also inefficient and favors the agency's needs over the client's. On the other hand, the value-based pricing model takes seven primary variables into account: 1. Estimated hours. 2. Hourly revenue target (HRT). 3. Costs. 4. Perceived value. 5. Builder vs. driver. 6. Loss leader. 7. Service level. In most cases, you will be able to determine prices by simply calculating estimated hours × HRT, but you want to take the other variables into account before finalizing the price.\n\nEstimated Hours At peak efficiency, how many hours will it take the agency to complete a project? Keep in mind peak efficiency is the key here, and one of the main differences from the traditional model. For services to be value-based, clients should not pay for agency inefficiencies. They should be charged for the estimated time in which the agency is capable of completing the service. The actual time invested will vary project to project, but if your estimates are accurate, and your team works efficiently, it should average out over time. The best way to determine estimated hours is by referencing historical timesheets. Let's say you want to standardize blog post copywriting. Pull reports from the last 10 blog posts your agency has completed, and look at the average hours needed. If you do not have timesheets to reference, analyze the scope of the service, and forecast time to complete based on your experience and educated best guess. I can tell you from more than six years experimenting with this model, value-based pricing is about testing and revising. You will get some pricing very wrong, and you will get burned a time or two, but as long as you have the right tracking and reporting systems in place, you can quickly adjust and move on. It is important to note that the value-based model does not eliminate the need for timesheets. Accurate time tracking actually becomes more essential in order to monitor efficiency and productivity, evaluate employee performance, produce activity reports, and evolve pricing. We will talk more about time-tracking systems and software in Chapter 4.\n\nHourly Revenue Target (HRT) How much revenue does the agency need to generate per hour of client work to achieve profit goals? For solo practitioners, the HRT will probably be similar to your hourly rate, but, for agencies with multiple employees, you will need to consider additional variables such as expenses, growth goals, payroll, and target profit margins. In essence, the HRT is similar to a flat rate in the traditional billable-hour model, but now it is only one of seven factors taken into consideration when determining service prices. My best advice is to talk with your accountant or financial advisors to determine your agency's HRT, but following is a very simplified way to look at calculating it using the industry standard benchmark of revenue per employee. We will assume an agency has five full-time professionals with varying client-service hour capacities. For example, the CEO may be forecasted for 50 hours per month, whereas the assistant account executive is targeted for 140 hours per month. The agency's annual revenue per employee goal is $120,000, which translates into $600,000.\n\nSo, if the agency delivers 5,880 client-service hours, it would need to earn $102 per hour in order to achieve its annual revenue goal of $600,000 ($600,000/5,880 = $102 per hour). Again, this is not the only option to calculate HRT, but it provides a basic structure to determine a starting point.\n\nCosts Are there any costs associated with the production and delivery that will be built into the price? This may include fees from partner agencies for services such as graphic design, video production and editing, or licensing fees. I suggest considering these costs when determining your HRT. For example, you may decide that, on average, it takes your agency eight hours to write a 1,000-word sales sheet, and your HRT is $105. Your price would be $840, but that does not take graphic design fees into account. So you contact your preferred designer and negotiate a fixed cost of\n\n$500 on design. Now you have a price of $1,340, which you can leave as is, or round up to $1,400 to account for markup or to give yourself a little flexibility on your time estimate. Is a 1,000-word, professionally designed sales sheet worth $1,400? That question leads us to our next factor, perceived value.\n\nPerceived Value What is the fair market value? What are clients willing to pay for the service? In many cases, this is the most important factor to consider. By drawing on your own experience and researching what other agencies are charging, you can often settle on pricing that fits market demands. Revisiting the example sales sheet, you may determine that $1,400 is too low. You have been charging clients $1,800 to $2,200 for the same job for the last two years and have had nothing but rave reviews. So put the price at $2,000 and move on to the next one. You have now created a value-based price that meets client needs, and gives you the chance to earn more than your HRT of $105. Use your time-tracking system to ensure that future jobs are actually getting completed on time and on budget, and adjust the set price as needed. In some cases, clients will put tremendous value on project work that has no measurable impact on the bottom line. This may be because they simply do not have the resources or knowledge internally to deliver the services your agency is capable of providing, or because of basic supply and demand rules. If your agency has capabilities that are scarce and in high demand, then you are in a strong pricing position, and I suggest you take advantage of the fundamental economics working in your favor.\n\nBuilder vs. Driver Is the service designed to set the foundation for future success (builders) or to produce short-term results (drivers)? This directly affects the perceived value and what clients are willing to pay. For example, if a client comes to your agency for support to create and grow the company's social media presence, it is going to take time before your services have any real impact. You have a lot of building to do, and, therefore, the client may not consider the services as valuable. On the other hand, say a client comes to you with a sales database of 25,000 prospects, and your agency plans and conducts a webinar that generates 1,000 qualified leads. That is driving real business results that organizations highly value. We will talk more about builders and drivers in Chapter 8.\n\nLoss Leader Is the service designed to entice first-time clients with attractive pricing? Is it proven to create cross-sell and up-sell opportunities? In retail, loss leaders are products sold at lower prices in order to drive sales of more profitable items. For example, we originally used PR and marketing plans as loss leaders, assuming they would convert into ongoing campaigns. We would charge a few thousand dollars and invest 100 hours or more of our top talent's time building incredibly comprehensive and valuable plans. Project-based clients would thank us, use the plan to justify hiring more staff, and then take everything in-house. We have learned that plans as loss leaders are a bad idea, so I do not suggest replicating that approach. I highly recommend requiring clients to commit to contracts of six months or more before providing detailed strategic plans. This goes for the business development process as well. Do not give away the whys and how-tos just to win accounts. If prospects or clients want plans for free, they will never truly value your agency's services and knowledge. This is a primary reason that requests for proposals (RFPs) are often so detrimental to agencies, and such a flawed system. Agencies invest significant time and energy developing creative and strategic concepts for prospects, and the organization only compensates the firm that wins the bid. RFPs are an archaic process that devalues agency experience and expertise.\n\nService Level Will basic-, intermediate-, or advanced-level talent produce and deliver the service? Even if you are no longer charging hourly rates, there is an hourly cost associated with every employee, so do the math. A senior account executive making $75,000 per year in total compensation—salary, benefits, and bonuses—costs the agency approximately $32 per hour, while an assistant account executive earning $30,000 costs approximately $13 per hour. These hourly rates are based on 260 business days per year at nine hours per day, or a total of 2,340 hours.\n\nWork that primarily requires basic-level service should cost less in the value-based model, and high-level services should cost more. Consider the service-level factor in the example of an e-mail newsletter and a crisis-communications plan. Assuming both are completed in 10 hours, which is more valuable? I would argue that the crisis communications strategy, which requires advanced capabilities to devise, should be priced at two-to-three times the e-mail newsletter, which can be completed efficiently by an assistant account executive. Remember, we are pricing on perceived value, and a strategic plan to mitigate risk and protect your client's brand is gold. When demand exists for advanced expertise, you have the opportunity to create and capture tremendous value. Always make your profits where they are justified.\n\nRevenue-Efficiency Rate Although estimated hours to complete a service are heavily weighted in the value-based pricing formula, prices are no longer based on how many hours it takes the agency to deliver services. Efficiency becomes the primary driver of success. So rather than relying on straight billable-hour reports to determine agency performance, we came to focus on revenue-efficiency rates (RER). Simply stated, the RER measures how efficiently your agency turns one hour of service into X dollars in revenue, with X being the HRT. The RER formula is relatively straightforward, once you know your target HRT. Let's say that your agency strives to generate $100 in\n\nrevenue for every client service hour. The goal is to deliver the service as close to 100 percent efficiency as possible in order to achieve your desired profits. As we discussed in the previous section, you want to take costs into account as well. Here is how to calculate the RER of a completed project: RER = [(Price – Costs)/Hours]/HRT.\n\nSample 1: Website Project\n\nThis is excellent. The agency's gross profit (or revenue after subtracting vendor fees) on the project was $12,000, and it invested 120 hours to complete the project. That means that it generated $100 for every hour of service for a 100 percent efficiency rating. Assuming that the services were provided by an account executive earning $45,000 per year, or approximately $19 per hour ($45,000/2,340 hours), the agency has plenty of room in there to cover operating costs, employee compensation, and a nice profit margin. Now let's look at an example of how this can go wrong.\n\nSample 2: Marketing Plan\n\nMarketing plans can be time intensive, and they often drain significant agency resources to execute. In this scenario, the HRT is $100, and, like the website project, it takes the team 120 hours to complete the project. At set price of $5,000, the revenue-efficiency rate is only 42 percent. In other words, the agency only generates $42 per service hour. To make matters worse, the marketing plan requires heavy senior-staff involvement, which costs the agency more to deliver the service. The agency can absorb the inefficiencies as long as it is being delivered as part of a larger contract and campaign, otherwise it can be a major problem. But what is the alternative? Charge the client for all 120 hours at whatever the hourly rate is? If we assume a billing rate of $150 per hour, then it would be $18,000 for a marketing plan that will be outdated by the time it is presented. Are there clients willing to pay that much for a plan? Even if there are, will you be comfortable with the value they will get from it, knowing how quickly plans change? I would argue that with a 12-month contract in place, this is potentially a loss leader worth taking. Your goal is to build long-term client relationships, and this gives your team the chance to immerse itself in the industry and put a solid foundation for success in place. However, do not make a habit of taking on low-efficiency projects like this.\n\nWhen Do Billable Hours Make Sense? Even knowing all the challenges with billable hours, when variable scope is involved, they may be the only viable solution. This applies to services such as consulting time and media relations, which can be very difficult to forecast, given their dependence on variables such as ever-changing client needs and demand from third-party audiences. For example, a PR firm may forecast 20 hours to make targeted pitches to 10 high-priority journalists, and coordinate any follow-up communications and interviews. If it takes 15 hours to research, craft, and distribute the 10 pitches, 5 hours are left for any additional work. However, when all 10 journalists respond and request supporting materials and onsite interviews, the agency realizes it dramatically underestimated hours. My solution would be to define the known scope—research, craft, and distribute 10 highly targeted pitches—and commit to a value-based set fee for that first phase, regardless of how long it actually takes to complete. Then, have a contingency allotment of service hours available based on media demand. Although still integrating billable hours, this approach is preferred for a few reasons: Clients know exactly what it will cost to develop and send the pitches, and they agree to the value of that work, knowing it does not come with any guarantee of results. In other words, they see the value in the outputs provided by your firm, which they would prefer not to handle inhouse. The up-front set fee forces your professionals to be focused and work as efficiently as possible, knowing that if it takes longer than forecasted, the agency, not the client, is losing time and money. The hourly-rate contingency will only be activated if the client will gain additional value from your services, because it only comes into play when the media responds and expresses interest.\n\nFocus on Recurring Revenue There is an enormous, albeit unstable, market for project-based services. The success of solutions such as Logoworks, crowdSPRING, and the HubSpot Services Marketplace has demonstrated a rising wave of interest in affordable marketing support. As a result, agencies and\n\nprofessionals that figure out models to profitably meet growing demand for project work stand to prosper. However, project-based work is less predictable, making it incredibly difficult to forecast workflow, expenses, staffing, and income. In other words, if you are planning to stay a solo practitioner or if you are building a distributed network of contractors, project-based opportunities may be exactly what you need. However, for those of you focused on building an agency, success depends on your ability to create recurring revenue from a diverse and stable client portfolio. The goal should be to sign up the majority of your client base to long-term contracts, preferably 12 months or more, and to have 80 percent or more of your annual revenue coming from those contracts. This ensures a predictable and steady cash flow, assuming clients pay their bills on time, and it gives you the confidence to invest in growth and take the calculated risks needed to innovate and excel. While building your contract base, your largest client should not account for more than 20 percent of your annual revenue. This rule is flexible if it is a long-time loyal client that has grown organically over time, but never for newer, high-risk accounts. You take on too much exposure, to borrow an insurance industry term, when you rely so heavily on one account. No matter how good you are, there are too many variables out of your control that can lead to an account loss. We have had solid contract accounts disappear overnight due to bankruptcy, mergers and acquisitions, internal shakeups, and poor management decisions. On the other hand, we have also had to drop clients for a variety of reasons. You have to protect yourself and your employees. When accounts leave, you are stuck with the overhead, and you either need to quickly replace the business or make difficult decisions to cut back expenses, which may include staff reductions. You can mitigate your risk and give yourself the freedom to walk away from deadbeat accounts by having a well-balanced portfolio.\n\nChapter Highlights The traditional billable-hour system is tied exclusively to outputs, not outcomes, and assumes that all agency activities—account management, client communications, writing, planning, consulting, creative—are of equal value. The amount professionals are paid does not have a direct correlation to the quality or value of the services they provide, especially when you consider the impact of change velocity, selective consumption, and success factors. Distractions lead to higher costs and lower quality. Transparency in pricing builds trust, removes friction from the client-agency relationship, and makes it simpler to sell services to the mass market. If you can define the scope, you can standardize the service and assign a set price. The burden is on the agency to build systems and processes, and put the right talent in place, to profitably deliver services at set prices. The value-based pricing model takes seven primary variables into account: estimated hours, hourly revenue target (HRT), costs, perceived value, builder vs. driver, loss leader, and service level. Accurate time tracking in a value-based pricing model becomes more essential in order to monitor efficiency and productivity, evaluate employee performance, produce activity reports, and evolve pricing. If prospects or clients want plans for free, they will never value your agency's services and knowledge. Your goal should be to sign up the majority of your client base to long-term contracts, preferably 12 months or more. The largest contract client should not account for more than 20 percent of your annual revenue. Efficiency is the primary driver of success.\n\nChapter 2 Transform into a Hybrid A real-time world demands real-time agencies.\n\nEvery Firm Is A Tech Firm Hybrid agencies will come to rule the marketing world. These emerging leaders are tech savvy, offer integrated services, hire and retain versatile talent, and profit from diversified revenue streams. They thrive on change, and continually apply shifts and advances in technology to strengthen their businesses, evolve their services, and deliver greater value to clients. As change velocity accelerates, traditional agencies unwilling or unable to adapt will quickly be left behind. Meanwhile, more nimble upstart firms are utilizing technology to construct efficient agency-management and client-services models. Whereas legacy systems slow down large, established agencies, hybrid firms can activate software and introduce processes that lower operating costs, increase productivity, and drive profitability. They are able to build more scalable models that largely operate in the cloud, capitalize on advances in online communications and mobility, and rely on their social graphs to create a more open and collaborative agency ecosystem. The cloud, which metaphorically refers to the Internet, has given agencies access to affordable hosted solutions for time tracking, project management, customer-relationship management (CRM), lead nurturing, sales, accounting, data storage, campaign management, monitoring, analytics, website content-management systems (CMS), enterprise social networks, technology infrastructure, virtual meetings, and communications. These cloud applications, which run on third-party servers rather than internal networks and local computers, become the backbone to more\n\ndynamic and innovative agencies. Systems and processes that used to take years to build on internal networks can now be activated and integrated in real time, often for small monthly fees.\n\nTechnology-Driven Services As selective consumption—the principle that consumers choose when and where to interact with brands—continues to drive marketing strategies and budgets, agencies must seek opportunities to bundle their services through value-added reseller (VAR) and affiliate programs. The HubSpot VAR Program is a perfect example of the opportunities that exist around technology-driven services. In February 2010, HubSpot cofounder and CEO Brian Halligan (@bhalligan) introduced their VAR program and began investing significant company resources in training and certifying marketing agencies on the use of its inbound marketing software. Certified partners—more than 500 agencies in more than 15 countries—are given access to educational resources, selling tools, training programs, and private online communities that facilitate customer interactions and peer-to-peer communications. In addition, partners who resell the HubSpot software receive a 20 percent margin on each license for the life of the customer. Agency partners are featured in the HubSpot Services Marketplace,1 an online directory that connects providers with organizations seeking marketing support. HubSpot uses a Customer Happiness Index (CHI) score, which is automatically calculated by its software, to grade partners based on the marketing success of their clients. HubSpot and non-HubSpot customers can search the Marketplace for services including: Do inbound marketing for me Call to action button design Landing page design Lead nurturing Social media marketing Blog article writing On-page search engine optimization (SEO) Pay-per-click (PPC) Video production Premium content Website design According to HubSpot's Jordyne Wu (@jordyne), director of business development, the Marketplace has referred more than 2,500 transactions to VAR partners totaling more than $4 million in service revenue for the agencies. My firm was HubSpot's first partner agency as part of a beta program that began in spring 2008. We tapped into HubSpot's training and methodology to evolve our traditional PR and marketing services into the emerging areas of search marketing, social media, and content marketing. Our value-based pricing model made it possible to effectively bundle and promote service packages designed specifically for the needs and goals of HubSpot customers. Without investing a single dollar or minute in the development of our own software, we were able to accelerate our growth and drive sales by expanding our digital services and marrying them with a third-party solution. It is partnerships like these that agencies can use to disrupt and thrive in the new marketing world.\n\nInsight into the HubSpot VAR Program I asked HubSpot's Peter Caputa (@pc4media), director, Value Added Reseller Program, to share his thoughts on the program and the growth opportunities that exist for agencies moving forward:\n\nRecently, a prospective partner said to me, ‘There's no one out there like HubSpot who is trying to help marketing agencies be better marketing agencies.’ There are so many challenges that marketing agencies face that are externally imposed, such as the changing landscape of services they must learn and deliver, as well as internal challenges including client acquisition, profit margins, and account retention. From working with hundreds of agencies of all types and sizes, we've discovered ways to help agencies with these challenges and for several years have been packaging up training and support services on top of our core product to help them. Most agencies and consultants lack the time to even do their own marketing, let alone do the research and development to know where the market is heading, what services they should offer, and how to offer them efficiently so that they can help clients maximize their return on investment. More than 170,000 people who are either self-employed as marketing consultants, or who work at a marketing agency, have downloaded the thought-leadership content that our marketing team has produced. With data from more than 5,000 customers using our integrated marketing platform to both execute and measure their online marketing activities, we have insight into what works and what doesn't. When we publish guidelines, share tools, and provide best practices that are specific for agencies, thousands of agencies download the information and share it with their peers. Sharing this with our partners has made it possible for them to sell, measure, and deliver ROI to our mutual clients, making it a win-win-win. While many of our longstanding partners have seen a 200-plus percent growth in revenue, there is still a huge opportunity for agencies, as evidenced by the more than 30-plus new partners that come on board each month, and the thousands who report that they are still struggling with how to build their marketing agency. We're tripling down on our partner program this year based on our successes and the demand.\n\nThe Challenges of Becoming a Product Business The most profitable and efficient opportunity for most agencies is in third-party software integration; however, there are a number of reasons marketing service firms may venture into proprietary product development, including: pursue perceived market opportunities, create recurring revenue streams, differentiate from competitors, improve internal processes, and increase valuation. Although some marketing firms, such as SEOmoz, an SEO software company, have successfully transitioned from a predominantly servicebased to product-driven business, it is a challenging proposition for most. In an April 24, 2011 TechCrunch article, “What Should You Do With Your Crappy Little Service Business?” 2 Mark Suster (@msuster), a two-time entrepreneur and venture capitalist at GRP Partners, articulated why service businesses should not become product businesses. Although the post specifically addresses technology service providers, the same principles and reasoning apply to marketing agencies. “This is where many service businesses make mistakes and go pear shaped. They get ‘product business envy’ because they read too much TechCrunch about their product brethren raising money at crazy valuations and getting sold at even crazier ones. So they set out to build a product business within a services company,” said Suster. He goes on to describe the three main problems that arise, which can negatively impact an agency's core service business. 1. Agencies do not realize how difficult product businesses are to build, and they falsely assume their successes selling services will translate into a competency selling products. 2. Increased costs associated with product development create larger exposure risks in down markets, thus destabilizing the business. 3. As resources are funneled into the product side, firms can lose sight of their core business—services. The moral of the story: Be cautious when pursuing shiny objects. Do not let delusions of grandeur or product envy cloud your vision for building a strong service-based agency.\n\nThe Tech-Firm Transformation Evolving into a technology-driven service firm, an essential component of every hybrid agency, requires two common elements: immersion and integration. Let's examine how each plays a role in an agency's transformation:\n\nImmersion Agencies, particularly their leaders, must have an insatiable appetite for knowledge about the technology industry, and a desire to be early adopters of products and services. Agencies that understand technology trends and innovations are able to more readily adapt their own business models, continually increase efficiency and productivity, evolve client campaigns, and make strategic connections of seemingly unrelated information. This requires professionals to: Read the essential publications, such as TechCrunch, Engadget, GigaOM, Gizmodo, Silicon Valley Insider, All Things Digital, and Wired. Watch the technology trendsetters, such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, and Twitter. Monitor for news that affects client campaigns and look for opportunities that apply to agency services and agency management. Follow and engage with influencers, including media, bloggers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs. Attend conferences and webinars in search of inspiration and ideas. Seek out events that deal with start-ups, mobility, and enterprise technology. To understand the value of technology immersion, let's take a look at how changes to Google's algorithm—admittedly, pretty geeky stuff to follow—directly affect marketing agencies. Although SEO professionals and webmasters are commonly in tune with Google news, I would argue that the search giant's moves are equally important to PR, advertising, web, and content agencies. In February 2011, Google began rolling out its Panda algorithm changes. The goal, as stated on the official Google blog, was simple: “To give people the most relevant answers to their queries as quickly as possible.”3 The first rollout impacted 12 percent of Google queries, and was designed to reduce rankings for low-quality sites in favor of sites that featured valuable original content, such as research, reports, and thoughtful analysis. We will stop there for a minute. Google, which controls approximately 65 percent of the search market, was telling companies in very plain terms that duplicate, low-value content is bad, and original, high-value content is good. This was not anything new, but for years outlaw agencies have built their businesses preying on clients’ needs for short-term results at any cost. They use unethical black-hat SEO tactics, and flood the Internet with low-quality content, in an effort to boost search-engine rankings and drive website traffic. These agencies are a black eye on the marketingservices industry. They sell shortcuts, not long-term solutions. Agencies that had not taken note of Google's moves yet hopefully were on high alert at this point. However, just in case companies were not making the connections, Google, which usually is relatively tight-lipped about its algorithm changes, made another announcement in April 2011 on its Webmaster Central Blog.4 This change, which affected all English-language Google users around the world, incorporated user feedback signals to help people find better search results. Google claimed it affected approximately 2 percent of U.S. queries. Then, in May 2011, Google provided very pointed guidance on how to build high-quality sites, and explained how the Panda change was just “one of roughly 500 search improvements” they were expecting to rollout in 2011. Their advice to marketers in general, and spammers, scrappers, and content farms in particular, was this:\n\nSearch is a complicated and evolving art and science, so rather than focusing on specific algorithmic tweaks, we encourage you to focus on delivering the best possible experience for users.5 Google went on to offer 23 questions that organizations can ask themselves in order to assess site and content quality.\n\nGoogle's core message, which has not changed through the years, is to create lots of valuable content that people will want to link to and share. Therefore, in order to grow smarter and faster than the competition, organizations (your clients) must continually publish multimedia content online through blogs, podcasts, videos, optimized press releases, case studies, white papers, ebooks, and bylined articles. As a result, savvy agencies have been listening and building services around demand for high-quality content creation. However, it does not stop there. Remember the lesson of selective consumption and the importance of recurring revenue in building a strong agency. Agencies have to construct campaigns that cater to consumers’ evolving needs and demands. They have to help consumers find the information and products they are looking for when they are looking for them. Content creation is just the beginning. How will the content be spread (social media, e-mail, and PR), found (SEO), and consumed (web and mobile)? In other words, this one example of Google's algorithm change, which professionals who were immersed in the technology world saw first, demonstrates the need to constantly adapt and integrate services across traditionally detached marketing disciplines. Digital and traditional services have to be aligned, and specialized agencies must begin working more closely together for the sake of clients and each other. It is the only way to create stable recurring revenue from campaigns, and achieve the success factors that matter to clients today.\n\nIntegration Being immersed in the tech industry is the first step, but, as we saw in the Google Panda example, you must have the willingness and ability to change your agency's services, processes, and infrastructure to accommodate market shifts. This requires the consistent investment of time and money, often without an expectation of ROI. The key is to take calculated risks, and learn to trust your instinct. My agency's relationship with HubSpot started this way. In fall 2007, when we first signed on as a customer, I had no idea how we were going to use their software, but, at the time, I felt the industry was rapidly moving toward search, social, and content. I had read about HubSpot in a tech article, and I saw them as a vehicle to train our team in new methodologies and to eventually differentiate us from other firms. It was only a matter of months before we began to recognize the true potential of bundling our services with their software and expanding our capabilities to provide more measurable impact on our clients’ businesses. I have had similar experiences with other software platforms after first reading about them in tech blogs, and learning about them at technology conferences. Applications such as Yammer, Basecamp and Highrise (both 37Signals products), GoToMeeting, Skype, TweetDeck, and Evernote have changed the way we do business. Although you will invest a lot of time and energy in testing platforms that are not a fit, you should always be experimenting and looking for ways to improve efficiency and increase the value delivered to clients. We will talk more about technology and core agency platforms in Chapter 4.\n\nMeet the Demand for Digital Services The demand for digital services is immense, and growing. According to the Ad Age 2011 Agency Report, digital services accounted for an estimated $8.5 billion, or 28 percent, of U.S. agency revenue in 2010.6 In addition, Forrester has reported that interactive marketing spending on mobile marketing, social media, e-mail marketing, display advertising, and search marketing will near $77 billion by 2016, representing 35 percent of all advertising dollars.7 However, it is becoming more difficult to differentiate these dollars. Every agency, or at least the ones that will still be relevant in the coming years, is a digital agency. Although the resources dedicated to social, search, mobile, web, e-mail, and other digital strategies will vary, interactive marketing should be fully integrated into every program and budget. Having a digital division or group within an agency is not sufficient. Your agency's future depends on its ability to adapt, deliver measurable and meaningful results, and develop professionals who are capable of providing consulting and services across multiple disciplines. Although there are tremendous opportunities to build businesses focused on niche markets and services, the generalists who excel at blending interactive and traditional strategies, will control the power and budgets.\n\nResist the Dark Side of Digital There are no shortcuts to success. Building your digital capabilities is a process that requires significant time, training, and experience. If you want to move into blogging, social media consulting, SEO, video, e-mail marketing, mobile, and other high-demand areas, prove you can make it work for your agency first. Invest the resources now to launch a blog, engage in online communities, gain a following, experiment with new content-publishing channels, conduct webinars, boost search-engine rankings, and generate leads through custom-built landing pages. Focus on creating value, and use it to demonstrate your expertise and advance your agency. The market is moving fast, with growth opportunities everywhere, but do not come into it unprepared and try to sell services you are not qualified to deliver. Agencies can quickly get themselves in trouble when they overpromise clients to win new business. Never lose sight of your ethics and reputable business practices in pursuit of a dollar. The cost to your agency, and the reputation you have spent your career building, is far too great. Let's examine the case of JCPenney to see what happens when digital services go wrong, and explore four lessons agencies can learn from the debacle.\n\nJCPenney Wears the Black Hat In an exceptional piece of modern-day investigative journalism by David Segal, the New York Times uncovered an elaborate JCPenney linkbuilding scam, orchestrated by its former black-hat SEO firm. Allegedly unbeknownst to JCPenney, the firm built thousands of spammy paid links to JCPenney.com for key search terms such as area rugs, dresses, and furniture. The result was top rankings in Google for JCPenney products that most likely drove millions of organic site visits during the 2010 holiday season —a critical time for the retailer, which had seen sales sink to 2001 levels and was still reeling from the death of its catalog business. According to the Times, the number-one spot in Google for dresses alone could have generated as many as 3.8 million organic visits per month.\n\nThe Times had an SEO expert, Doug Pierce, head of research at Digital Due Diligence Advisors (formerly with Blue Fountain Media), analyze JCPenney's remarkable organic performance. Pierce described the program “as the most ambitious attempt to game Google's search results that he has ever seen.” The Times turned over its findings to Google, which took “strong corrective action,” according to Matt Cutts, head of Google's webspam team, resulting in significant drops in JCPenney's organic rankings.8 So what can agencies learn from the JCPenney fiasco when building their digital services? Here are four takeaways: 1. Google will win: Google's webspam team is on a mission to protect the quality of Google's search results. They are smarter than SEO professionals and far more powerful. So it is best to play by the rules. Like anything else in life and business, just because the other guys are getting away with it (for now), does not mean it is all right to cheat the system. 2. Don't be desperate: Decisions driven by desperation can be very dangerous to your agency's long-term health. Do not let client demands for short-term results, underperforming campaigns, or financial pressures force you to sacrifice your integrity. 3. There are no shortcuts or guarantees: Pleading ignorance when Google catches you will get you nowhere, so make sure your practices are ethical and that they pass the “icky” test—that feeling you get in business when something just does not feel legitimate and most likely is not. Authentic SEO requires time, and a combination of on-page optimization—page titles, URLs, page descriptions, ALT text, headers, copy —link building from credible sources, and regular content publishing on your clients’ domains. Commit to doing it right over time, and you will reap the rewards. 4. Focus on content and the long tail: Content publishing is the most powerful strategy available to build inbound links, boost searchengine rankings, drive website traffic, and generate leads. Concentrate your services on attracting organic traffic from long-tail keyword phrases. The long tail applies to the collective strength of lower search volume, longer keyword phrases in the demand-curve tail, and their ability to outproduce a relatively small number of top traffic-driving keywords at the head of the curve (or header phrases). For example, marketing agency would be considered a header term, whereas how to build a hybrid marketing agency would be a long-tail phrase.\n\nThe Greatest Opportunity for Growth: Content Although agencies have been clamoring for their share of digital budgets and influence in the areas of search, mobile, and social, content publishing has largely been overlooked. Agencies that provide strong, multimedia content services are a rare and valuable asset in the new ecosystem. Powerful, action-oriented content has become an essential part of every marketing strategy, and it offers an enormous opportunity to differentiate and grow your agency and your clients’ businesses. There are undisputed benefits to blogging—more indexed pages, inbound links, website visitors, and social media reach—and tremendous lead-generating potential in ebooks, case studies, webinars, white papers, and original reports. The general rule is, the greater the value of your content, the greater the return on your investment. However, continually producing premium content worthy of links and leads is not easy. It requires significant time and resources, executive support, long-term vision, internal expertise, and often a willingness to share the knowledge businesses once held sacred. More than anything, it requires the ability to be effective business copywriters, generating content that engages audiences and motivates them to take action. There are many talented writers and content services available, but few that possess the wide range of capabilities needed to satisfy the core elements of effective business copywriting. Public relations agencies, communications pros, freelancers, former journalists, and traditional publishers are all in the conversation as possible sources, but many have yet to step up and evolve their capabilities to meet the growing demand for results-driven online content. Let's take a look at seven core elements of effective business copywriting, and some tips on what to look for when hiring writers:9 1. Strategic: Online content has to connect to business goals and brand messaging. Hire writers that understand marketing strategy, and how to deliver copy that integrates across web, search, social, and PR strategies. 2. Brand centric: A brand is the sum of experiences and perceptions. When someone hears a company name, or sees its logo, what comes to mind? It may be based on their last interaction with a customer-service representative, the referral of a friend, or a lifetime of personal experiences with its products or services. Words, images, and actions define your brand every day and, with selective consumption, websites and online content may often serve as the first—and possibly only—opportunity to make an impression. Business copywriting must convey core brand messages, tell an organization's story, and create positive perceptions that motivate action. 3. Buyer-persona focused: Great copywriting makes personal connections with readers. Copy needs to speak directly to buyer personas, address their pain points and bring value. Therefore, copywriters—whether internal or outsourced—must have a clear understanding of your client's target audiences, and know how to engage them. 4. Optimized for search engines: Online content must be crafted for visitors, but optimized for search engines. Ideally, business copywriters will have core SEO knowledge and capabilities. 5. Technically sound: Technically sound copy is concise and powerful. It uses proper grammar and is written at the appropriate reading level. It is also consistent in person, voice, tone, and format. Copywriters need strong technical writing skills and the ability to apply these skills whatever the task, medium, or subject matter. 6. Creative: Never underestimate the value of quality creative writing. Although many of the other elements we have discussed can be learned, business-savvy creative writers are in high demand and scarce supply, and can be an invaluable asset to your agency. 7. Results driven: Copywriting needs to be tied to organization objectives, and should play a key role in delivering results, such as generating leads, educating key audiences, and positioning as an industry leader. Copywriters should be invested in tracking the content's success through metrics such as pageviews, content downloads, social media reach, and leads. This enables future content to be strategized based on past performance, and can encourage the incorporation of new ideas and topics, to drive traffic and capture audiences.\n\nUnderstand Your Role in the Ecosystem The evolving marketing-services ecosystem consists of six agency classifications: disruptors, traditionalists, softservers, specialists, connectors, and soloists. Each plays an essential role in the development of a more open and collaborative community. Let's first take a look at the marketing agency profiles, then visualize how the ecosystem functions.\n\nDisruptors Disruptors will be the dominant players in the new ecosystem. They are the most advanced of the hybrids in terms of technology integration, diversified services, and talent versatility. Disruptors are always pushing to evolve services and pricing, and they have the most aggressive growth goals. Unlike their traditional-agency brethren, disruptors are risk takers that fight to remain nimble, always thinking like start-ups and acting like underdogs. Few firms have emerged to date that embody all the elements of these leading hybrid agencies. As a result, tremendous opportunities exist for the agencies with the will and drive to develop model firms.\n\nServices: Able to build fully integrated marketing campaigns that adhere to the principles of selective consumption. This includes content publishing, social media consulting, SEO, online advertising, mobile marketing, website development, e-mail marketing, lead nurturing and analytics, as well as evolved forms of PR and brand marketing. Core capabilities will center on digital services, with a mix of traditional activities as needed. Some services will be outsourced to partner agencies, including soloists and specialists, especially in the early years as they develop talent and advance internal capabilities. Staff: Versatile professionals with strong backgrounds in marketing, communications, and business. A high value will be placed on expert copywriters who are trained in authentic on-page and off-page SEO methodology and can function as Internet marketing consultants. All employees are heavily engaged in social media. We will further investigate staffing in Chapter 3. Pricing: Value based with wider appeal to the mass market of small businesses. Results: Leading marketing agencies consistently produce more measurable outcomes, including inbound links, website traffic, leads, and sales. Quickly shifting away from arbitrary metrics such as media impressions, reach, advertising equivalency, and PR value. Technology: Fully immersed in the technology industry. Will breed a new generation of tech-savvy, entrepreneurial-minded professionals. Cloud platforms play a key role in their growth and adaptability. Infrastructure: More agile and tolerant to risk than traditional marketing service firms. Built to be highly scalable in terms of number of clients and employees, geographic markets, and revenue streams. Leadership: Prototype founders have 5 to 10 years of agency experience, with exposure to a diverse collection of accounts and industries, and strong insight into agency management. They will be digital natives who understand what is broken within the current agency model, and have the drive and desire to do it differently. There is significant financial risk, so the ideal professional lives a modest lifestyle, has solid personal savings, and, ideally, has some level of bank- or angel-investor funding to provide a 12- to 18-month runway to figure things out. We will go further into funding and financials in Chapter 4. Growth: Dramatically more aggressive growth models due to mass-market appeal. A wave of mergers and acquisitions of complementary firms—PR, SEO, advertising, web developers, e-mail marketing, mobile marketing—is possible, although most will look to remain independent and grow within the collaborative ecosystem. Market focus: The industry leaders will have a mass-market focus and international appeal (the Internet has no borders), but, like any emerging industry, there will be plenty of room for smaller agencies to prosper by concentrating on niche market segments and/or services.\n\nTraditionalists The unfortunate truth is that traditionalists are the irrelevant aristocracy. They are still influential due to their large networks, established client rosters, and legacy brands, but they have minimal impact on the emerging disruptor class. Their archaic business models are difficult to evolve, and, therefore, they will struggle to compete as more companies seek innovative approaches to interactive marketing needs. The advertising and PR industry conglomerates are not going anywhere soon, but in the meantime, disruptors will gladly chip away at the underserviced small-to-midsize business (SMB) markets, and begin infiltrating larger enterprises one division at a time, slowly undermining the traditionalists’ influence and authority. Following are characteristics of traditionalist agencies: Current market leaders with solid reputations and brands, and respected leadership teams. Strong in traditional services, but struggling to profitably integrate digital services. In many cases, they may have divisions or groups internally that specialize in digital; however, digital services and thinking are not ingrained throughout the agency. Staffed with some of the industry's best and brightest young talent, but stand to lose A players to emerging firms that offer more innovative cultures. Top traditionalist professionals are also prime candidates to launch disruptor firms. Maintain top-heavy staffing models with high-paid executives and partners. This makes it difficult to evolve pricing models and build more efficient, value-based services. Stuck in legacy systems that inhibit their ability to make the drastic infrastructure changes needed. Some top traditionalists have the resources to acquire upstart disruptors in an effort to remain relevant, but many will look to merge or get acquired as competition intensifies.\n\nUnless these firms make dramatic changes, they run the risk of becoming obsolete over time. A subcategory of traditionalists will develop that successfully evolve into tech-savvy, hybrid agencies but lack the vision and growth goals of disruptors. They will be able to maintain strong, profitable businesses as long as they can retain their top young talent, but these professionals will be highly motivated to find more dynamic career paths with disruptors and softservers.\n\nSoftservers Softservers are a relatively unknown yet quickly evolving breed. Technology companies, which concentrate on marketing software development, are building service divisions, either based on customer demand for advanced product expertise, or out of necessity to improve utilization and performance, thereby reducing churn rates—a key metric for software companies.
