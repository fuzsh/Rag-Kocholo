Daly, the most tireless modern apologist for the emblem, has conservatively estimated that there are ‘perhaps as many as two thousand’ emblematic titles in all European languages. Collectively these can be seen to impinge on every aspect of Renaissance and Baroque culture.1 The inference from this has frequently been that emblems might be used as a peep-hole into the cultural assumptions of the period. This surely places too great a burden on the narrow shoulders of a form that began life as no more than a series of terse epigrams. The pervasiveness of the emblem surely leads us in a different direction: that the emblem itself can only be understood in terms of the broad cultural assumptions that produced it. This present book attempts to do so by setting the emblem against the backdrop of a shared European neo-Latin culture of festive celebration. My original aim was to offer an alternative to studies of emblems, which were either synchronically or unhistorically conceived, or which were essentially motif studies, which unrealistically pretended to unlock the coded conceptual allegories of Renaissance and Baroque art or to deliver the ‘meaning’ of literary texts. My method was to have provided a historical overview of the form. Beginning with the sixteenth century, each chapter would unfold successive ‘centuries’ of emblems. The Ariadne’s thread through this labyrinth was bibliographical: dates of first editions would determine where a work was discussed. Orderly and rational though this might appear, it did not take long to realize that it was based on the naïve assumption that the calender was a real guide to generic developments. ‘Origins’, for instance, had the disconcerting habit of receding, or paradoxically appearing much later than one had at first believed. ‘Beginnings’ could coincide with a first edition, but equally emerge in a later editorial innovation. Nor were later editions or texts an infallible ‘advance’ over their predecessors. Woodblocks and copperplates archived in the printing-houses could be taken up and reused. And symbolic forms persistently\n\n10\n\nthe emblem\n\nreplicated themselves through ingrained rhetorical habits of imitation, so that a ‘new’ emblem book could accommodate persistent survivals of traditional habits of thinking, writing and reading. The regulation, ordering and systematizing of symbolic forms might induce innovation, but equally could act as a conservative brake on novelty. It was clear that notions of chronology had to be reconfigured and rethought. As with origins, the ‘end’ of the emblem tends to be grossly exaggerated. Rosemary Freeman in her history of the English emblem book was confident enough to date the demise of the emblem. This was, apparently, in 1686, when John Bunyan dedicated his emblems to boys and girls. Yet, inconveniently, emblems continued to be published and sold. Since the myth of their ‘decline’ has been so persistent, some consideration of the influence of a new, juvenile readership on the development of the genre was needed, and the adoption of the form by writers and artists in the twentieth century needed to be examined. New readers produce new emblems. With the advent of amatory and devotional emblematic sub-genres at the beginning of the seventeenth century, a traditional image stock was recirculated within a different context. Miniature forms were elaborated according to evolved rules, where, in a species of semiological overcoding, a more restricted application procured innovation. Ends are often dictated by distinct purposes and designs. All writers and artists were under obligation to an epideictic rhetoric of praise and blame. This social function dictated that many emblem books subserved occasional and local circumstances, particular historical events and perceptions of a national history. Grounded in a historical moment, emblems can be misunderstood, or be totally incomprehensible, unless there is an awareness of the immediate temporal context. Chronology, the moment of utterance, is a clue to meaning. Nor did the early modern period compute and record time in the same way we do. The culture of holiday mirth that surrounds calendar festivals shapes the form and content of many emblem books. And, while annual festive celebrations inform some emblem books, so others are modelled according to a more sombre teleology of world history: the prophetic, apocalyptic endgames of the four last things. Many of the strategies and conclusions of this study may be genre specific, but they may have implications for the way we read other early modern literary forms.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThere will inevitably be objections to what I have done in the following pages, and for that I am pleased. What I have attempted is to place emblems into a context of ways of thinking and ways of feeling, ways of conceptualizing what we are and what we might be. But in a single volume, no one can do everything (non omnia possumus omnes). The materials I discuss are a matter of choice, and inevitably some will complain that my system of choice is erected on a narrow base. My motto in all of this might be ‘Obscura promens’ (Horace, Odes, I, xxxiv, 14): I have brought the obscure into undue prominence, and exalted the unworthy. Some readers will find far too much Palmer, Whitney, Quarles, Wither and Stevenson, but most of my readers will be Anglophone and will probably assimilate these examples quite readily. I make no apology for the number of examples drawn from Alciato. He was the gold standard of emblematic writing, and his influence runs through the whole tradition. His book remained in print for 350 years. Unfortunately no English translation does justice to his robust Latinity. I have no ambition to write a book on the ‘English Emblem’. The English examples I discuss are there not because they are English, but because they are good examples of a Europe-wide phenomenon. I attempt to provide a polyglot cultural context against which these can be seen. Any notion of a narrow national ownership of this tradition is ludicrous. Unless it can be seen against the background of a neo-Latin, pan-European tradition, it becomes virtually invisible. And the same might be said of various vernacular European linguistic appropriations. Except, of course, that some vernacular cultures in particular locations planted the form in vernacular soil and made it thrive. I resist any temptation to extend the polyglotism of this theory to encompass oriental ideograms, much less to authentic Egyptian hieroglyphs. When anti-matter confronts matter, when authentic philology confronts linguistic speculation of the highest possible imaginative order, all inevitably must fly in fumo.\n\n12\n\nthe emblem\n\nClaude Mignault, attempting in his oft-reprinted preface to Alciato’s Emblemata omnia to win assent for his argument, disarmingly concludes his Syntagma de symbolis with a quotation from Horace (Epistles, I, vi, 67–8): ‘si quid novisti rectius istis / candidus imparti; si non his utere mecum (If you know something better than these precepts, share it, my brilliant fellow; if not, join me in following these). I can do no better than commend the sentiment to my readers. That I have done what I have done has only been made possible by my conversation and friendship with many scholars in this field. They will know my extreme debts. I mention with particular warmth Bob Cummings, Marc van Vaeck, Karel Porteman, Peter M. Daly, Michael Bath, Alan Young, Daniel S. Russell, Pedro Campa, Jean-Michel Massing, Dietmar Peil, Wolfgang Harms, Karl-Josef Höltgen. All have generously shared their compendious erudition in matters emblematic, die et noctu. To my mentor, Alastair Fowler, I owe a particular debt: neither knew quite where the clue would lead, when he introduced me to this emblematic labyrinth. Among others, I would particularly wish to mention Lyndy Abraham and Sabine Mödersheim. Various libraries and librarians have also been of enormous assistance: Edinburgh University Library; the Herzog August Bibliothek, Wolffenbüttel; Glasgow University Library; the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris; the British Library; the Bodleian Library; Cambridge University Library; the National Library of Wales; Queen’s University, Belfast; the Founder’s Library of the University of Wales, Lampeter. In all of this my wife, Shawn, has exhibited the thoroughly emblematic virtue of patientia. She read the complete text and made innumerable suggestions for its improvement. To her I owe more lessons in the Counter-Reformation principles of lætitia and fristitia than anyone could deserve.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHad I a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths, and a voice of iron, I could not sum up all the forms of emblems, or rehearse all the names of devices.1 No one is compelled to perform the impossible.2\n\n‘To think is to speculate with images’, pronounced Aristotle.3 Centuries later, Coleridge would buttress the principle with a specious etymology: ‘To think is to thingify’.4 The Renaissance and Baroque periods would have little reason to disagree with either view. But their images were not – or at least not exclusively – those pale shadows of sense impressions the Greek philosopher meant. The image stock that sustained these Early Modern thought processes derived from a complex visual and verbal culture. Actual buildings, books and objects – galleries, libraries, and collections of ancient artefacts, inscriptions and archaeological finds – provided part of the mental furniture. And since there were no restraints imposed by any viable formal theory of image production, the generation of new imaginative forms and structures was technically limitless. The sources that fed the image-making faculty were wonderfully varied and philosophically irreconcilable, though some hardy spirits would attempt the feat: GraecoRoman, Judaeo-Christian, archaeological, theological, literary, historical, artistic, heraldic, mythological (see illus. 1), scientific, astrological. This fantastic repertory of images and mythologies, a heady cocktail of fact and fiction, firm articles of faith and will-o’the-wisp nonsense, lent form and substance to unspoken assumptions, inarticulate unconscious hopes and fears that went to make up a culture in the process of being formed. The fabric of medieval faith and thought was eroding under a steady tide of religious, political and intellectual upheaval and change. Yet, the anxieties created by enormous innovations – the Reformation, the discovery of the New World, new astronomical theories – exerted a pressure on the cultures of Europe to look afresh at the things that sustained\n\n14\n\nthe emblem\n\n1\n\ntheir imaginative life. But the image stock of the past was to assert a continuing pressure. The scholarly reader was probably more likely to glean his knowledge of astronomy from a better edited text of Hyginus than from Copernicus (illus. 2). The culture of the Renaissance and the Baroque oscillated between past and present. The classical world of Greece and Rome was dead, but still exerted a powerful influence. The present was in the process of being born. More accurately and insistently, it required articulation. The past was drawn into that present. But wherever the images came from, thought of whatever kind would be absolutely dependent upon them. In some cases, the images were fragments stored against impending ruin, in others, they nourished the hope of a new imaginative synthesis, a new beginning. Any approach to the terms ‘symbol’ and ‘symbolism’ of the Early Modern period has to begin by admitting that both terms had already become blurred in antiquity, and the situation did not get any better as time went on. Antiquity bequeathed a linguistically contaminated term that led to the point where at least seven different meanings could be assigned to the word.5 When the emblem emerged as a distinct literary form in the first half of the sixteenth century, its species of symbolic representation was also called a\n\nintroduction\n\n15\n\nsymbolum. Being a new invention, however, the emblem was free to define itself. Thus, it could be ‘a species of epigram’,6 or ‘a symbolic, identifying attribute held by an allegorical personification’. The Oxford English Dictionary can define the term as a verbal construct, ‘fable or allegory that might be expressed pictorially’, or as an image, ‘a drawing or picture expressing a moral fable or allegory’.7 Flags, identifying marks, familial or national coats of arms,\n\n2\n\nmottoes, even war-cries, might all spring to mind as possibly relevant. The taxonomical question becomes further muddied when we look at closely related linguistic forms in various vernacular traditions: impresa in Italian and empresa in Spanish in many cases also refer to what we would commonly accept as emblems. Symbola, like their vernacular equivalents devises, or devices, could\n\n16\n\nthe emblem\n\nalso refer to emblems or to imprese or to both. ‘Poosees’ (posies) became an English appropriation of the term emblema. The hieroglyph inspired and formed the basis of emblematic constructs. Collections of learned imagery, iconologies, images of gods and goddesses were also sources for, or drew on, emblems and emblem books. I say nothing at this time of the parable, the illustrated beast fable, the illustrated proverb, the reverses of medals, the rebus or the enigma. A cautionary case, which illustrates the depth of the problem, is the term theologia symbolica. To a seventeenth-century German Protestant theologian, it would have referred, not to a book of Christian symbols, but to theological arguments concerning the Creed. What one can say with certainty, however, is that around the beginning of the sixteenth century, a number of essentially new symbolic forms were invented or rediscovered. Variously described as imprese, emblems, iconologies, symbologies, Imagini de i Dei, Mythologia, hieroglyphs, symbola or icones, these works collectively bear witness to a systematic programme of composing, compiling, transposing and recording allegorical imagery. The task was taken up by humanists, theologians, courtiers, heralds, academics, antiquarians, philologists, rhetoricians, esoteric philosophers, alchemists, hermeticists, Jesuit educators, poets, artists, literati, mystics, architects and polemicists of every colour of sectarian persuasion. Together they presided over a major shift in sensibility that fundamentally altered the perceptions of the Middle Ages and lasted until the dawn of Romanticism and beyond. One cannot understate the variety as well as the pervasiveness of emblematic modes of thought and expression during this period. Without exaggeration, from Catholic Spain to the Protestant Netherlands and from England to Russia the emblem impinged on every aspect of European Renaissance and Baroque life – and death. Over 2,000 titles of printed books in who knows how many editions, manuscripts and various printed ephemera are only part of the surviving legacy of a phenomenon that decorated every aspect of domestic and civil life, however noble, however menial. Yet this terrain still remains largely uncharted. There are bibliographical maps, but they are incomplete or unreliable.8 The essential tasks of analytical and descriptive bibliography, textual history, the construction of stemmata on which textual authority might have been firmly established, have not, in the majority of cases, even begun. Modern editions tend to be in the form of facsimile reprints, expensively preserving the errors and typographical idio-\n\nintroduction\n\n17\n\nsyncrasies of individual copies, even down to the accidents at the press, the ink blots and scribbles left by early readers, which render, on occasions, the printed text illegible.9 These reproductions further distort, blur and degrade to varying degrees the quality of the original. When the book is particularly fat, reproduction of some openings render the text illegible in the inner margin of the recto and the outer margin of the verso. Biblio-biographical information on authors, artists, engravers and publishers exists, but the record is patchy and has never been collated. Historical and theoretical certainties hardly exist; philosophical and epistemological orientations are unreliable. Academic ground-work that took place for ‘respectable’ literary and art-historical national traditions at the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth failed the emblem and its related kinds, partly because of its bastard and uncanonical status. It was neither Literature nor Art, although it was spawned and secretly nourished by both. There exists an eloquently specific, but, I would claim, a representative example of just this kind of collusion and obfuscation from a period at the end of the nineteenth century, when much of the scholarly work that went to the establishing of national literary disciplines was being done. In Britain, for example, the New English Dictionary and the Dictionary of National Biography were being compiled. At this time Edmund Gosse wrote of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Moral Emblems, that ‘these volumes were decidedly occult. … [T]hey leave something to be desired. Non ragionam di lor, ma guarda, if you be lucky enough to possess them, e passa.’10 By implication, the dark quotation from Dante’s Inferno, iii, 51 (‘I will not speak of them, but look and pass on’) consigns the poems to a place somewhere on Lethe’s far bank. But no reader who had actually seen these little booklets could easily recognize them from Gosse’s description: they are anything but occult. Of course, Gosse knew that his statements were almost certain to go unchallenged, partly because of his secure position within the literary establishment of the day, but also because few readers would have actually laid eyes on the texts in question. At this date, they were extremely scarce, and had only appeared in their first, limited, ephemeral editions. Even the British Museum did not hold a full set. But Stevenson had sent Gosse copies of all the productions of Lloyd Osbourne’s press. Gosse knew that what he wrote of them was sheer hokum. His specious misrepresentation was deliberately designed to exclude them from consideration as part of Stevenson’s legitimate output. Gosse recommends the\n\n18\n\nthe emblem\n\nbooklets only to the bibliophile and the collector, not to read them, but to ‘possess’ them. It is time to explore the emblem phenomenon more fully. Barriers between Literature and other kinds of writings and inscriptions, we are led to believe, have been eroded. Let us, therefore, explore this illegitimate phenomenon, even though the way may sometimes be dim. Theorists are at best blind guides. Answers to questions may not always be satisfactorily forthcoming. Fortitude and patience are required. What is an emblem? What is a symbol? Nothing, one might think, could be more natural than to ask this at the outset. Let us rehearse, by way of dialogue, some assumptions, and confront them with the facts as they are found in real examples of the form. The emblem consists of three parts – a ‘lemma’ or motto, a picture, and a following explanatory text. But this three-part structure is not the exclusive property of the emblem. It occurs in texts that are certainly not emblems. Illustrated Ovids, Aesops, Virgils, and fable books (see, for example, illus. 3) have a page layout that consists of a title or caption, the picture, and a following text, which teases out the implied narrative of the picture. The format existed before emblem books as such were invented, and derived from a healthy manuscript tradition. Of course, it is not unlikely that this format might well have influenced the decision of the printer of the first published emblem book to commission pictures to add to the motto and text that the author provided. But a three-part structure is not all that makes an emblem. Nor did emblem authors feel constrained by the mystic number Three: there are various layouts: two, four, six, eight, or more parts have seemed variously viable. It was not for nothing that Jacob Cats christened one of his books of emblems Proteus! However many parts it has, one, at least, must be a picture? Yes … except sometimes the picture is lacking. The emblem is then said to be ‘naked’. Surely this is a printer’s oversight, or an attempt by the press to save money? Sometimes it might be doubted if an illustration ever formed part\n\nintroduction\n\n19\n\n3\n\n20\n\nthe emblem\n\nof the author’s intention. Even within the same book, some emblems may have pictures, others not. How long should an emblem be? Doesn’t it have a short accompanying verse epigram? Yes, except when the verse is prose, and the text – whether verse or prose – can stretch from a pithy distich to several pages. But does the verse epigram ‘accompany’ the emblem, or is the epigram the emblem? These are works of mysterious, esoteric symbolism. The ‘darkness’ of these books is often greatly exaggerated. But the emblem was never meant to be obvious. There may, indeed, be some deliberate obfuscation, for it had to have something plus in recessu quam in fronte More that is hidden than is openly displayed. Authors with an interest in the occult did appropriate emblematic formats for obscure purposes. But it is more usual to find that the imagery is very plain and taken from ordinary, everyday objects: a mop or a comb might serve as the basis of an emblem. In these designs, of course, it has to be realized that cleanliness is often next to godliness. I have seen some emblems that contain music. Yes … and the format of many printed emblems resembles that of the seventeenth-century song books. But music is not always or necessarily part of an emblem. But there are, indeed, musical emblems. Well, I know this much: these are usually works of morality or devotion. In many cases, yes. But they could also be works of social satire, esoteric science, philology, or libidinous speculation. Content is no certain guide. Emblemata or ‘emblem books’ formed no discrete category in Early Modern libraries. Some books of emblems were shelved in the poetry section, others catalogued as legal or medical, still others as ethics, or politics, or divinity, or natural history. Occasionally in early libraries multiple copies of the same book were each classified in different sections. Emblems could also be found within larger works of reference: rhetorical manuals, educational treatises, encyclopaedias, dictionaries, and scientific reference works on botany, ornithology, herpetology, etc. Nor was the emblem – whether ‘naked’ or otherwise – always to be found between the sheets of a printed volume. Sometimes it was part of\n\nintroduction\n\n21\n\nsome public celebration, festive, gratulatory or funerary; sometimes it formed the basis of a sermon; sometimes it decorated the interior or exterior of religious or civic buildings. It is apparent, even at this stage, that we have taken the wrong track. What is an emblem? is not even a good question. It implies that the answer lies in the same eternal present as the question, and that there is an emblem, a normative type, that the emblem is one thing at all times in all places. But before a barrage of excepts and buts begins, polite enquiry ought to cease. This game of verbal tennis might continue endlessly, each observation countered by negative qualifications or ever-more subtle refinements. One quickly realizes that a few superficially innocent enquiries have yielded so many answers, many of which are stale, flat and unprofitable. This question can prompt those who know into a Prufrockian evasiveness (‘Oh do not ask what is it …’), or a Faustian horror (‘Homo, fuge! Oh turn from these labyrinthine, dusty, theoretical arguments!) The question Quid emblema sit? is the very riddle of the Sphinx, that dies when answered. One might wander endlessly within the Early Modern academies of critical interrogation of the form. The answer one gets from earlier records is not consistent. Authorities repeat the solemn pronouncements of their predecessors – even those of the medieval schoolmen – without any noticeable advance or improvement. What is most disturbing is the constantly defeated expectation that these pronouncements should bear at least passing resemblance to what we find when we actually see the thing itself. Even in this present century, normative, formalist approaches to the problem – the Germans’ hunt for the fabulous Idealtypus,11 which never did nor ever could exist in nature, only in a speculative museum to be looked at by academic specialists – have suffered, when applied to the actualities of the case. It does not survive the kind of rhetorical enquiry that even schoolboy rhetoricians of the Renaissance would have subjected it to: the time when; the manner how; the place where. Not even the fertile hunting grounds of the Renaissance emblematists – the deep forests of Germany, or the wildernesses of North Africa and Ethiopia – have yielded a satisfactory specimen! It exists only as a convenient subterfuge, the product of hypothetical reasonings, that can be arrived at only by setting aside all the historical facts. We must be wary, too, of applying a post-Romantic or Postmodern critical theory to a period that constructed visual, lexical, and typographical space in radically different ways to our own. Yet the Victorians had\n\n22\n\nthe emblem\n\ntheir emblem books (see illus. 4), which repeated or redesigned those of earlier centuries. There are, too, Postmodern emblems: notably those of Ian Hamilton Finlay.12 Some Surrealist experiments, in which objects were signed and given a new name, have much in common with many emblematic procedures.13 Although proceeding in an independent direction without reference to the emblem, when a poet such as Bernadette Mayer can write of the ‘obfuscated poem’ that it ‘bewilders old meanings while reflecting or imitating … a beauty that we know’, she asserts, knowingly or unknowingly, a fundamental continuum between a Postmodern poetic and the best traditions of the art of the emblem. Then, as now, it is just as true to say that to be alive as a poet is to be in conversation with one’s eyes 14 These broad kinships show the futility of attempting to establish synchronically viable generic markers that would reconcile different productions at different times under the same broad label. ‘Exceptions’ co-existed at the same date, even within the same volume. Nor can we take refuge in the feeble construction of emblematic subspecies – the love emblem, the Jesuit emblem, the humanist emblem, the alchemical emblem, the heart emblem, the impresa – where different but consistent rules and conventions might apply. Each sub-genre, it will be found, replicates in miniature the contradictions that run through the entire corpus. Literary practitioners did not think of generic ‘rules’ as tyrannical edicts. Ben Jonson robustly rejected the notion that ‘authenticity’ can only be achieved by adherence to certain ‘laws’. ‘I can conceive of no such necessity’, proclaims Cordatus, Jonson’s alter ego, a character ‘of a discreet and understanding judgment’. Speaking of comedy, a not irrelevant consideration, since it has been argued by more than one person that the emblem to be considered a genus jocosum, he states: If those lawes … had beene deliuered vs, ab initio, … there had beene some reason of obeying their powers: … yet how is the face of it chang’d since! … [it is] augmented … with all liberty, according to the elegancie and disposition of those times, wherein [various authors] wrote? I see not then, but we should enioy the same license, or free power, to illustrate and heighten our inuention as they did; and not bee tyed to those strict and regular formes, which the nicenesse of a few (who are nothing but form) would thrust upon vs.15\n\nintroduction\n\n23\n\n4\n\nAs with comedy, there were no ‘lawes’ laid down to govern emblematic composition ab initio. Indeed, ‘liberty’, ‘license’, ‘free power … to illustrate and heighten’ were also the hallmarks of the emblematist’s art. Part of the emblem’s distinction – as was recognized early on – was its diversity. To slightly paraphrase Gabriel Rollenhagen’s prefatory epistle to his first readers, changing his words, but not his sense, to apply his statement specifically to emblems: ‘But just as there is great diversity in virtually every other thing in spite of their being put together under the same genus, such is also the case with emblems’. 16\n\n24\n\nthe emblem\n\nIn answer to the question with which we began – What is an emblem? – it may be safest to assume a somewhat radical, nominalist position: everything that was called an emblem was indeed an emblem. Even here we are insufficiently liberal, for we really ought to embrace its various synonyms: emblema, emblemata, emblème, Sinnbild, Sinnebeeld, Sinnepoppen, Zinneminnebeeld …. At this stage the faint-spirited might wish to give up, and simply concede that different linguistic and national traditions had their own way of dealing with this particular word-image collocation and abandon them to their own devices! But even were one to respect discrete linguistic boundaries, one would find that these terms within the same linguistic borders would have to be stretched to encompass some local variation: – the emblèmes of Lyon are not necessarily those of Paris; the Florentines and the Romans dealt with these matters in different ways; Nuremberg is not Frankfurt; the academic emblemata of Leuven are not those of the more commercially orientated Antwerp printers. Yet the portability of the printed book, and the various swift communication networks across Europe, could ensure that a book printed in Lyon could normally be available in Geneva, Antwerp or Madrid in a short space of time and could there make its contents known. We probably need to go even further and accept for the sake of argument whatever definition, and whatever fabulous and unlikely explanation that early writers gave for the beginnings, origins developments of the form, as well as relations to their various cognate manifestations, even though with the benefit of hindsight we now know these to be philologically and linguistically mistaken, if not totally fanciful. The polymath Athanasius Kircher, for example, pursued his deluded symbological and philological investigations back beyond the Tower of Babel to the lingua adamica!17 Luca Contile, more modestly, traced the history of symbols to the time of Noah – the divine impresa, a rainbow with the motto NEQVAQVAM VLTRA INTERFICIETVR OMNIS CARO AQUIS (From henceforth all flesh shall not be rooted out by the waters of the Flood).18 Others cite the secret writings of the Egyptians via the esoteric tradition of Moses, Zoroaster, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato and Proclus. Others claim to be heirs to a line of occult wisdom enshrined in the oral tradition of the Cabala, which began with a theosophical school established by God himself with the help of the archangel Raziel. He instructed selected angels in the art, who in turn instructed Adam. These imaginative constructions of the form, however dubious or ludicrous, formed part of their real\n\nintroduction\n\n25\n\nthinking about the genre, influencing the way it was uttered and its uses. Whatever was thought to be the case actually changed the form itself. All this, of course, is simply part of the stubbornly healthy refusal of genres to conform to static theoretical constructs. All literary forms change, mutate, evolve and eventually die, sometimes to be resurrected in more glorious embodiments. And the emblem has, as we have indicated above, proved to be particularly vigorous in adapting itself to different uses: academic, pedagogical, satiric, decorative. It became the plaything of such various and mutually irreconcilably different groups as Jesuits, Lutherans, Behmenists, Paracelsians, Aristotelians, Neoplatonists and alchemists. It flourished in the courts of absolute monarchs, as much as under republican rule. Its pervasiveness and its progress went unchecked by local outbreaks of iconoclasm and iconophobia. The rage for book-burning and the hysterical violence against objects of wood and stone seem to have been directed more against the medieval legacy of images of saints than against contemporary images of vices and virtues. Nor should we be surprised that emblems should be any less flexible than most other forms. They were spawned under the aegis of the Sphinx, whose stony features twist into a smile at our attempt to bind this Proteus. The following chapters will seek to illustrate by particular examples some of the ways in which this form spectacularly adapted itself to diverse uses over the centuries. The mistake that so many theoreticians make is that they look for a normative embodiment of the form, which denies the very flexibility that gave the genre life. One hesitates, for various reasons, to invoke the magisterial put-down of Dr Johnson against those who sought to apply Neo-Classical ‘rules’ to Shakespeare – ‘the petty cavils of petty minds’ – but it is all but irresistible when applied to the field of emblematics. If the emblem was not generated from a theoretical matrix, where did it come from? The best approach that I can suggest to this question of image generation is to look at the customs and practices that went into making the emblem. And both were as various as they were pervasive and obtrusive. No domestic or public space was left unfilled by some appropriate emblematic decoration. Each part of the day from dawn until the evening announced finis coronat diem (The end crowns the day) and afforded opportunities for reflection. As one progressed from the bedroom, to the hall, to the library, to the garden, ceilings\n\n26\n\nthe emblem\n\ncould catch in mid-career a falling Phaeton, or a fireplace suspend a Quintus Curtius at the apex of his heroic leap; overmantels might display a merchant’s profession; on walls, tapestry hangings showed the cardinal and the theological virtues; curtains, cabinets, and bed-hangings might depict the exploits of Cupid or the loves of the gods; windows instructed the eye as much for what was written on them as for what could be seen through them; pictures of famous worthies of the past inspired the viewer to present emulation; vases, statues, pillars, rings, clothing might represent private resolutions; table ornaments, trenchers and glassware would remind the diner of the tortures of Tantalus or the advisability of Temperance – at such feasts, the motto surely was Gustate et videte (Oh taste and see); inlaid cabinets might celebrate the Labours of Hercules or of Cupid; furniture, mosaic floors, swords, armour, flags, standards, might form spurs to valour and noble enterprise. Even the smallest room in the house – the newly-metamorphosed Ajax – and the humble chamberpot did not lack appropriate emblematic adornment. Certainly, in the first half of the sixteenth century it was fashionable to wear emblematic badges or to have some mute sign embroidered on cloaks, caps or sleeves. Some of these images and words were from the pages of printed emblem books. Others became part of printed books, many of which have not survived. Nor are we necessarily dealing with actual houses and buildings. Some of these things existed only within the mental architecture of a memory theatre. No opportunity was lost to surprise the eye and the mind into moral reflection. Wise words, witty sentences, allegorical images and visual puzzles – a Saturn’s head, Hercules’ Hydra, Oedipus’ Sphinx, Cupid’s bow – waited in ambush to remind one of moral duties or religious truths. This scope and perspective on the individual marked this symbolism off from medieval patristic readings of the creation as universal sign. A striking phrase from some better author – Virgil, Ovid or Horace – a proverb, a biblical verse could be joined to an eyecatching image to constitute a miniature religious sermon or moral essay wrought into the material fabric of an individual’s daily life. This was attention-seeking poetry addressed to someone, and demanded or challenged interpretation. Discrete traditions normally kept apart – the Classical and the Christian, fabulous myth and the scientific observation of the natural world – were collapsed together in a mutually illuminating flash of understanding. If what was discovered was not always new, it was at least reinforced by copious and various repetition. Knowl-\n\nintroduction\n\n27\n\nedge was, after all, a process of remembering, recollecting, recuperating and reminding. Nature was observed through the ‘spectacles of books’, for reading could only be useful if it moderated and shaped perception and understanding. The duties, offices, and potential pitfalls of every station in the social, secular hierarchy from prince to servant, and of every stage in the human progress from the cradle to the grave, from infant to corpse, were prescribed in symbolic form and outlined according to a moral heraldry. Princes and courtiers more than most other stations in life were subjected to emblematic targeting. They were surrounded by the symbolic attributes and appendages of power – the orb, the sceptre, the rods of office, flags, standards – and instructed in the mysteries of state from the entries that greeted their arrival to the masques that entertained them after dinner. Political resolutions and treaties were preserved in visual form on standards and medals. The royal personage would display his personal ambitions and desires in coded form in the decoration of his palace (see illus. 5). François I’s famous, amorous salamander adorned each nook and cranny of his palace at Fontainebleau. It was a mark of ownership that he stamped upon his dwelling. But, as it also declared his noble, but secret passion, it also managed disconcertingly to obtrude his private desires on public, ‘official’ space. The effect is thoroughly Manneristic. In detaching an image from one sphere of existence (here, the private, the amorous, the personal) and attaching it to another (the political, the official, the public), it is quintessentially emblematic. It tests, and perhaps serves to define, boundaries and limits by embarrassingly, if artfully, overreaching them. But also, more generally, in respect of the less privileged, the new-born babe was surrounded by emblematic gratulation, even if it took no more grand form than a ‘Latin’ christening-spoon; schoolchildren cut their wits on emblematic exercises; the dragonguarded maid, the torch-bearing lover, the yoked newly-weds commended with pomegranates (see illus. 6), the wife with her tortoise, the lion-hearted soldier, the blindfolded or clean-handed judge, the scholar, whose learned tomes rivalled the elephant in the term of their gestation, and the dove-like widow did not lack for emblematic advice. Last, of course, the corpse was attended with customary suits of woe to its final resting place in a well-wrought urn or a half-acre tomb adorned with emblematic trappings. In cypress-planted churchyards, hieroglyphic serpents twisted themselves into stony hoops, biting their tails in defiance of depleted\n\n28\n\n5\n\nthe emblem\n\nforeword\n\n29\n\nhourglasses and eyeless skulls – an ancient intimation, or pious hope, that the triumph of eternity would succeed the triumph of time. There could be few surprises in a world in which each stage of life had its expectations penned and delimited by churchmen, jurists, moralists and teachers. It must have all been very comforting – and severely controlling.\n\n6\n\nLife was essentially emblematic because, to some degree, many aspects of daily experience were self-consciously presented as part of an emblematic theatre, in which no event could be presented without an accompanying gloss. For this reason human history, legend and myth needed to be taught and remembered, because these fictions and constructions of the past repeated themselves in essence, and could, in turn, throw light on present events and\n\n30\n\nthe emblem\n\nhappenings. Time had penned its lessons; men and women repeated them. Yet even the most mundane or trivial aspect of everyday life could afford a useful moral to the curious and inquisitive eye. There was literally nothing under the sun that was not emblematic – at least potentially. The four elements, the heavens, fourfooted beasts, birds, fishes, plants, stones and insects could all instruct the ‘eye of understanding’. What made this symbolic universe different from the medieval ‘Book of Nature’ was the active participation of the individual within the construction of significance. Abraham Fraunce, following Luca Contile, noted that ‘The one and the same image of any animal or plant can be used to unfold various ideas conceived within the mind’.19 This symbolic process originated within, and was generated by, the human mind. It was not a gift from God. Instead of a world divided Thomistically into the celestial and the mundane, one is presented with a curious knot that ties together the creation, so that spiritual realities can be seen within the created world as impinging on the individual, in so far as that individual participated within larger social and religious networks and within his or her own cultural history. The very terrain of the individual soul could be mapped. Not only physicians, but preachers and moralists became cosmographers: the physical world rendered tangible by a process of forged analogies that linked the invisible world of moral, spiritual, political and psychological entities. It was not so much a matter of a leap of faith, but a metaphorical leap that could be triggered by any number of rhetorical ploys, or by a Neoplatonic awareness of parallel emanations that descended from the world of the divine to the physical universe as perceived by the senses. This moralists’ map bore some relation to what has familiarly been called the ‘Book of Nature’ or the ‘Great Chain of Being’, which stretched in an ordered hierarchy from the Throne of God through the Choirs of the Blessed Angels and the celestial spheres, down to the smallest, though far from insignificant, pebble on the face of the earth. Even Hell itself might inversely replicate such an order. This world picture was a conservative, medieval survival, and the notion of a simple, ordered scale of creatures corresponding to established moral, political and spiritual meanings bore only a superficial relation to the complex harmonies that the Renaissance and Baroque mind could form from occult correspondences between the visible and the invisible. For this later age\n\nforeword\n\n31\n\nthe ‘Book’ was more like a folio volume, its indices compendious and various, and its author, God, more a Baroque concettist than a simple preacher. Nor was there only a single book in this library exclusively concerned with Christian devotion. One image (illus. 7) from Otto Vænius’s Emblemata horatiana shows that the humanist revival of Classical learning provided a repertory of Classical moral virtues that could exist alongside the Christian message. Hardly a polished mirror, which reflected exclusively Christian, spiritual truths, it was a dark glass, a cipher, a labyrinth of significance. It was, moreover, alive. At this time the earth began to move. The planets danced, the stars sang. Nature was also wittily pregnant. ‘All things are big with jest’, exclaimed the poet George Herbert. Later, it would ‘breathe’, ‘whisper’, ‘intimate’. Emblem books were not reprints of the old ‘Book of Nature’ of fixed allegorical types, but made from moveable type and formed of metals – those infernal practices of the printing house, the casting of molten lead, the scraping and cutting of woodblocks, or the corrosive, sulphurous and nitrous burnings on copper plate – to reveal, in William Blake’s phrase, the ‘Seven deadly Sins of the soul’. This art was no easy transcription from the world of nature, but the result of The secret of dark contemplation By fighting and conflicts dire With terrible monsters Sin-bred Which the bosoms of all inhabit.20 One thinks of the earlier Anton Wierix plates in which Christ ‘searcheth out the monsters lurking in the darke corners of the hart’ and sweeps away the ‘viper, serpent, [and] toad’.21 Symbolic equivalences were an art of the fugue, where a simple theme could be twisted and restated in different keys and registers: the sunflower (illus. 8), which followed the sun in its daily journey across the sky, might show the influence of the heavenly on the mortal and transitory world, or the secret harmonies that connected our rooted but transitory earthly existence to the immortal. In terms of human spirituality, this motif might show how the soul, trapped in its mortal body, attuned itself to divine influence; or, in the world of the Court, it could intimate the courtier’s attendance on the monarch, or, in erotic allegory, a lover’s reverential devotion to the distant object of desire. In one emblem (illus. 8), Camerarius combines half a line from Virgil with a Christian message. Nor does this list exhaust the potential\n\n32\n\n7\n\nthe emblem\n\nforeword\n\n33\n\n8\n\n34\n\nthe emblem\n\napplications of a single symbolic motif across discrete bands in the spectrum of existence, ranging from the privately intimate to the overtly public. Replicated over the range and variety of potential motifs, the number of variations that might be played on such an instrument is exponentially increased. Understood in this way, one might endorse Christopher Smart’s rapturous observation, ‘flowers are musical in ocular harmony’. The emblematic conceit, derived in some cases from the harmonies of a traditional keyboard of correspondences, was based on a conservative world view; in other cases writers wandered within the zodiac of their own wit, seeking analogies and individually dissonant metaphors in other worlds and other seas. It is important to remember that the universe during this period was constantly expanding, and changing. Our epistemological map has certainly changed since the Renaissance. Not only do the mental sets of the twentieth century differ from those of the artists, writers and scholars who produced the first emblem books, but the mental map was being revised and redrawn even during the period in which emblem art was being produced. It ought to be obvious that the symbols and the symbolic philosophy of the early sixteenth-century humanist were not those of the seventeenth-century Jesuit, the Enlightenment philosophe or the Victorian sage. But even within a shorter historical span there were radical disparities and shifts in emblematic meanings and usage. Tension between the innate conservatism of conventional arts of visual representation and swift changes brought about by the sudden expansion of knowledge in the Renaissance meant that within the sixteenth century we see a number of different uses of the same emblematic design, and a process of adaptation and change, of competing modes and fashions of symbolism. Differences of ideology, geography and vernacular traditions could at times override the false impression of unity within an international Neo-Latin culture. This richness and diversity of the emblematic tradition makes normative definitions suspect, while providing a rich and polysemous visual repertory of signs and meanings. When Martin Gerlach produced his Allegories and Emblems in 1882, he could not merely repeat the iconographic codes of the past centuries. He had to find ways of presenting entirely new concepts, as in ‘Electricity’ (illus. 9). Although this was a new concept, he could also use this as something of an excuse to display the female form, by appealing to the conventions of seventeeth-century allegory. The emblem was actively engaged in negotiations with all aspects of the culture of its time – literary,\n\nforeword\n\n35\n\n9\n\n36\n\nthe emblem\n\ntheological, political, popular and artistic – and these various demands required it to be various, aware of its different potential exploitations. Our safest procedure is to allow the emblem practitioners to answer for us. They invite us to step through their ornate frontispieces and command our attention: Aspice (Look!), Vide (See!) and, ultimately, Elige (Choose!).\n\none\n\nTalking with the Dead: The Beginning and Before the Beginning This chapter deals with the beginnings of certain symbolic forms: the emblem, the hieroglyph, the impresa. Or rather, it might better be said to deal with certain myths of their creation. As Daniel Russell has persuasively shown, there was a vigorous visual and verbal culture that was emblematic in all but name before the ‘emblem’ was officially invented.1 We should be careful not to overestimate the importance of accredited ‘beginnings’. Yet, for all the Renaissance preoccupation with origins and with pedigree, the earliest form in which a book was uttered, the manuscript or the first edition, did not necessarily prescribe its public future appearances, much less the ways an author would be later read and used. Nor, given the large license accorded the printing trade in the early modern period, could there be any guarantee that a book’s first public utterance would correspond with the author’s intentions. Nor would later readers in succeeding decades have been aware of the publishing history of the book they had recently bought. There may have even been an expectation that the book in their hands would have materially departed from the author’s copy. Although the printing trade was by inclination conservative in its practices, the publisher would naturally have been conscious of current tastes and fashions in the art of the book and would be inclined to issue a book in a form that would appeal to the contemporary reading public. Who would actively prefer the crudely executed woodcuts of an earlier generation, when finely executed copperplate engravings were in fashion? There is no doubt that pedigree conferred authority, but this was more likely to spring from the printer’s imprimatur, or from the materiality of the book itself, than from a mere author. When dealing with these early symbologies, modern readers should be careful not to be narrowly bound to definitions, which place an excessive reliance on printed ‘origins’. It is a needless truism to state that the early modern period was in a state of change and flux. But some literary historians, when dealing with the emblem, impresa and hieroglyph, tend to forget\n\n38\n\nthe emblem\n\nthis.2 Whatever such theorists state or piously wish, symbolic forms did not remain as they were first pronounced. Nor did the different genres stay chastely separate. There was inevitably interpenetration and cross-pollination. Beginnings, of course, were important; how otherwise could these things be? But it was soon realized that no one was bound by the ‘earliest’ conception of a genre, or the ‘earliest’ construction of a particular meaning attached to a particular symbol. These ‘earliest’ meanings could be discovered by a process of scholarly interrogation and contested inference. But there was no lexicon that systematically gave the dates, places and authors that identified a particular symbolic equivalence at any particular time. The situation was altogether too fluid to allow such a thing. The grammar of symbolic forms was in the process of being intuited. And what should prevent anyone, at any date, attaching a different symbolic equivalence to any object? After all, in emblematic composition part of the challenge was to see how far one could go in extending the application of a given symbol, or in developing a copious thesaurus of images to express the same idea. Given this possibility of the construction of new meanings, there seems no reason why the earliest significance should weigh more heavily than a later. Authority, in this as in so many other areas, was severely contested. But we have to begin somewhere, and the beginning, wherever that is and however we might construct such a notion, seems the most logical place.\n\nAndrea Alciato: Emblematum pater et princeps Rarely can the birthdate of a genre be established so precisely, and its ‘father’ so clearly identified, than in the case of the emblem. Notwithstanding all its lookalike proto-manifestations, on 9 December 1522 the academic lawyer Andrea Alciato wrote to Francesco Calvo, a printer, announcing the invention of a new species of literary composition: ‘During this Saturnalia, I have composed a little book of epigrams, to which I have given the title Emblemata’.3 Alciato saw these ‘emblems’ as recreative and entertaining: a relief and respite from serious academic work during the holiday period. He also hoped that these elegant trifles might entertain his intimate circle of erudite, humanist friends. The festive, saturnalian provenance of these compositions is not to be underestimated and was to exert an enormous influence on the tone and substance of the emblem tradition as a whole. I propose\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n39\n\nto deal with this in detail later, in chapters Six and (in particular) Seven. Alciato certainly seems to have had no intention to publish these works. In all probability, this may well have more than a little to do with their festive provenance, their Rabelaisian, even Fescennine, mirth. Private jests uttered in a Bacchanalian setting rarely translate well when reproduced in the sober light of print. Such intimate ‘mysteries’ are not intended for publication. Nor, during a period in which a manuscript culture was still vigorous, is there any reason to expect that the printed format was the most acceptable or usual means of publication. The holograph – now presumed lost – was for a small, intimate, intellectually elite group of erudite, humanistically trained readers, who would appreciate the poems for the festive utterances they were. Modern scholars would dearly love to know what this manuscript looked like. In their later published and printed form, the emblems were usually set out as in ‘Maturandum’ (We must make haste; illus. 10): a short motto or lemma above a woodcut; the pictura (here, the slug-like remora wound around an arrow). Beneath would be a short epigram, describing the significant parts of the image, here unpacking the comical paradox that a creature proverbially a symbol of sluggish inertia can possibly recommend haste.4 This tripartite layout became the most usual format for the emblem. Yet, it is highly unlikely that Alciato’s first holograph presented it in this way. It is probably wise not to be over-confident about the lost manuscript’s exact form and content. But we can make some likely inferences on the basis of the bibliographical evidence of subsequently published editions and the likely processes of textual transmission that lay behind it. In the absence of truth, the best we can hope for is a likelihood of truth. Alciato published some epigrams in 1529 in a collection of Latin translations made from the Greek Anthology.5 These texts are identical to some of the subscripted epigrams in the Emblemata, except that the texts do not have mottoes. The Latin anthology was, admittedly, a different publishing venture with different aims, but it is a legitimate inference that these texts may be those referred to in the earlier letter to Calvo, or that the emblemata described therein may have closely resembled them. On this basis, we might assume that, in at least some earlier states of Alciato’s emblems, there was no lemma or motto. Such a structure is generically feasible.Some of the first published emblem books, for example, La Perrière’s, also lack any sort of motto.6 If there was no motto to the first holograph emblems, it is even\n\n40\n\nthe emblem\n\n10\n\nless likely that there was an image.7 To judge from the evidence of authorially approved printed editions of the Emblemata, Alciato’s original manuscript epigrams were ‘naked’ – i.e., devoid of pictures. When Alciato published his complete works at the end of his life, they appeared simply as lemmatized epigrams.8 This format, therefore, had the author’s sanction. During his lifetime and in the early posthumous editions many of his emblems appeared in exactly this way,9 though he seems also to have been prepared to acquiesce to the provision of woodcuts. It was far from unusual for later editions of the emblemata or for Alciato’s imitators to adopt an unillustrated format that simply consisted of a lemmatized epigram. It should therefore come as no surprise if the author’s original holograph lacked visual material. After all, the image implied or described by the epigram was plain enough to anyone who could read the Latin. Or, if it was not plain, that\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n41\n\n11\n\nwas the author’s intention. There is a calculated ambiguity in some of the emblems that meant they could not be visually construed with absolute confidence. In one example (illus. 11), we see the tomb of the mighty Aristomenes. However, the eagle in different editions is found either chiselled into, or sits on top of, the monument. The precise visual specifics are not clear, for the Latin, ‘insideas’ can bear both possibilities with equal justice. Woodcut artists could not indulge in the Latin text’s imprecision. They had to choose what to depict. Alciato seems to have had no particular preference, for finally it is immaterial whether the eagle is a sculpted effigy or incised onto the lid of a sarcophagus. Here the erudite and the learned had the advantage over the illiterate artisans who designed and cut the woodblocks for the printed texts. Few artists at this date could read any learned tongue. For Alciato’s first intended readership, the image was easily visualized\n\n42\n\nthe emblem\n\nthrough the words of his poem, and any provision of a graphic image would have been an otiose tautology. Alciato’s Emblemata appeared for the first time as a distinct work in printed form in 1531, almost a decade after the letter to Calvo. How the manuscript came into the hands of the Augsburg printer Heinrich Steyner is not known. When they were thrust into an unprepared world in print form, their appearance came as a complete shock to the author. He even tried to have the volume suppressed. It may have been that he was embarrassed by the public appearance of things he had intended strictly for private circulation. These were the licensed jests of the Saturnalia, uttered festivis horis (at a time of convivial merriment).10 The term festivus also implies that the poems were witty, even salacious. They were not meant to be repeated or released to the larger world. For works that were meant for the private amusement of some friends to be put abroad in print was a betrayal, a breach of decorum. Some of their humour, we will see in a later chapter, could be so very broad that it caused some of his later commentators to blush. But we are in no position to judge the strength of the author’s annoyance, for the book appears to our casual observation to be exactly what an emblem book should look like: a collection of poems with mottoes and accompanying woodcuts. Such was the success of Steyner’s inspirational publishing coup that the design he hit on became the most usual form in which a publication of this kind would be issued for the entire history of the genre. But this was probably not the book our author invented. It appears, from Steyner’s prefatory address to the reader, that it was the printer’s own idea to commission the illustrations. A valid implication from this is that there were no illustrations before, and that Alciato’s text consisted only of mottoes and epigrams. Six emblems remained inexplicably unillustrated in Steyner’s edition, those printed on the openings on sigs e4v / e5r and f2v / f3r, and these might be regarded as more accurate reflections of the copy text, which Steyner had acquired. For the rest, he had simply taken over the author’s manuscript, however he may have come by it, and fitted it to the existing popular publishing formats of the illustrated fable, the illustrated bestiary, the Bilder-bibel and collections of illustrated proverbs, which were designed for a more general readership.11 This was the emblem’s first gigantic stride towards a distinctly popular culture. And the emblem never fully recovered. Whatever other reason Alciato may have had for suppressing the volume, there can be no doubt that Steyner’s edition was a\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n43\n\ntravesty of Alciato’s erudite, humanist emblems. Their utterance in this form must surely have embarrassed the learned jurist. They looked distinctly popularist and down-market. Also, given the iconological inexactitude of Steyner’s commissioned woodcuts, it is inconceivable that they could have derived from an author’s sketch or verbal directions to an artist. Even the specifications of the images described in the words of the epigrams are ignored or misunderstood. The artist–designer seems to have regularly misconstrued the iconography and meaning of the Latin, often in such a way as to fly directly in the face of the text’s precise details. There was also an unacceptable number of embarrassing typos, which the printer hastened to put right by issuing a new edition within weeks of the first. Inevitably, while correcting some compositorial blunders, he added new ones. Yet, for all its faults, from this modest beginning sprang the most frequently reprinted emblem book in history. It appeared in over 200 editions in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries alone, and almost immediately was translated into the vernacular. It spawned Latin imitators, and its repertory of images was appropriated by the material culture and reproduced in tapestry hangings, plasterwork and domestic ornament. Others, prompted by Alciato’s example, repeated or extended this image stock. Even in 1531 it was too late for Alciato to put the genie back in the bottle. The emblems were in the public domain and they could not be recalled. The distinguished, academically respectable, Parisian printer, Christian Wechel, persuaded the injured author to entrust him with the printing of a new, corrected edition with cuts by Jollat, which he would commission at his own expense. From 1534 until 1542 a series of editions of the Emblemata flowed from the Wechel press, along with a French translation by Le Fèvre and a German one by Wolfgang Hunger. During this time Jollat’s woodblocks, which had initially largely followed the designs of Steyner’s artist, Jörg Breu, with all their faults, were progressively modified and corrected. New cuts with a different iconography were substituted for the old (see illus. 14, 15, 16). All these changes brought the blocks more strictly in line with the images described in Alciato’s epigrams. It is tempting to think that Alciato himself had a hand in the process. That Alciato approved of Wechel’s enterprise is indicated by the fact that he continued to communicate newly composed emblems to the press: in 1534 nine emblems that had not appeared in Steyner’s edition were incorporated into the Wechel text, and two new emblems were added at the end of the\n\n44\n\nthe emblem\n\n1542 edition. Alciato went on composing emblems for the rest of his life, and collaborated with a number of publishers, sometimes happily and sometimes not. In June 1546 some 86 hitherto unpublished emblems, complete with illustrations, were issued from the Venetian press of the heirs of the distinguished Aldus (illus. 12). How the texts came into their hands, and the dates of their composition, are far from certain. It may be, but this is the purest conjecture, that Alciato, or those who placed these emblems with this publish-\n\n12\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n45\n\ning house, wanted to associate the emblemata with the Aldine press. In the first years of the century, the great Aldus Manutius was in the forefront of the current interest in Egyptian hieroglyphics and was the first to put Horapollo into print. As it was thought by many to provide the key to Egyptian hieroglyphic wisdom encoded in an ideogrammatic picture script, the text exerted enormous influence on the development of the emblem tradition as a whole.12 But the 1546 edition of the Emblemata is fraught with unanswered questions. Again, it is not known whether the author’s holograph, if that was the copy text, contained illustrations, but on previous evidence, this is unlikely. At about the same time Alciato was negotiating with the Lyon printer Sebastian Gryphius over an edition of his Reliqua opera. These included all the emblemata from both the Wechel series and the new Aldine texts. In Gryphius’s edition they all appeared without illustrations as ‘naked’ emblems. Gryphius passed the text of the complete series of emblems to his former apprentice, Jean de Tournes, who went on to publish the emblemata in a single volume composed of two books, the first comprising the Wechel suite, the second the Aldine emblems. Jean de Tournes commissioned new woodcuts for ‘Liber I’ from the renowned Bernard Salomon. ‘Liber II’ was not furnished with cuts. The implication is that custom and practice had associated the earlier suite of emblems with the tripartite illustrated form, but the author’s copy of the new emblems, as communicated to him by his fellow Lyon printer, had no such visual embellishment. Jean de Tournes was probably unaware of the illustrated Venice edition, which seems to have exerted little influence on the subsequent iconography of Alciato’s emblems. Thuilius, Alciato’s most diligent editor, appears to have been unaware of it. For ‘Liber I’ Salomon adopted some of the iconographic detail from Jollat’s illustrations to the Wechel editions, but did not hesitate to change or reinterpret Alciato’s epigrammatically defined images. Jollat’s brilliantly spirited designs became the models that many subsequent artists would follow. Towards the end of Alciato’s life, the bookseller Guillaume Rouillé, in collaboration with the printer Macé Bonhomme and the artist Pierre Vase, brought out an edition of the Emblemata omnia, which provided illustrations for 211 of the 212 hitherto published emblems.13 Alciato’s Emblemata proved to be a title that both de Tournes’ and Rouillé’s publishing houses would keep in print well into the next century. What emerges from this compressed publishing history of the Emblemata during Alciato’s lifetime is that it would be a mistake to\n\n46\n\nthe emblem\n\nassume printed versions were faithful or even consistent reproductions of the author’s first poetic thoughts as embodied in his original manuscript(s). The printed book had a life of its own, and its shape and destiny was controlled by various hands – booksellers, printers, artists, compositors and editors. Each would assume an almost total authority over one part of the production process. Consultation seems to have been a difficult concept. If it occurred, it was probably after, rather than before, the event. The author’s role, once he had wittingly or unwittingly supplied the initial text, seems to have been at best marginal, one more concerned with damage limitation than anything else. The process of innovation and change to the published format was not arrested with the author’s death. New cuts with different iconographic motivations were commissioned, and the book acquired a body of annotation and commentary. I will deal with some of these changes in chapters Two and Three. Suffice it to say, if Alciato were to have returned to the world and sought to buy a copy of his emblems some 80 years after his death, he would scarcely have recognized the book as his own. We might also go further and make the not unfair assumption that, even in his own lifetime, he regarded the subsequent public appearances of his poetic offspring with some bemusement. At various times he seems to have allowed, if not actively approved, different visual interpretations of his epigrams. It was probably a matter of indifference to him, as long as the artists’ interpretations did not render his text totally ridiculous. After all, the humorous, the preposterous, the exotic and the strange were not altogether removed from his original sense of festive emblematics. It is also worth mentioning that he had no financial interest in the publication of his emblems. But, even if the publishers, printers and artists do not seem to have cared very much, it seems legitimate to ask what Alciato’s original intentions might have been. Although he left no formal theoretical utterance that sets this out with any clarity, we can infer certain things from the different states of the printed emblems, which represent initial misunderstanding and subsequent correction to and accommodation of the author’s ideal intentions. In Alciato’s letter to Calvo we witness a lawyer’s fussiness over what amounts to the announcement of a new genre – this libellus is, after all, Alciato’s poetic child. There is even something affectionate in his choice of the diminutive. Though internal evidence suggests he must have begun composing these epigrams around 1517, at that time the book cannot have been large. If not a libellu-\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n47\n\nlus (a very little book), it was indeed small. It probably contained fewer than the 104 emblems that were published by Steyner in 1531. It had a long way to go before it would assume, under Thuilius’s editorship, the mammoth proportions of Tozzi’s 1,000-page Padua edition of 1621. Alciato’s choice of the name emblemata for his contribution is revealing. At that time absolute novelty was neither desirable nor a recommendation, so Alciato decided to dignify his new creation with a classical pedigree, and thereby sought to confer on it some species of cultural legitimacy. He hit on a Greek word with a sound Ciceronian provenance: emblema, from a Greek verb meaning to set in, or on, to put on, to graft on.14 But the new name was always going to cause problems. Classically, it referred to mosaic tiles, or the grafting of a shoot onto a stock, or detachable decorative ornaments. Never had it been thought of as a kind of literary composition or epigram, though it had been applied to a mannered, precious style of speaking or writing.15 In this latter sense there may even be a sense of knowing self-mockery in Alciato’s choice of the name. When Cicero had used the term,16 he was referring to encrusted ornaments stuck onto plate or vases for decoration. In classical times, it seems, these could be removed from the object (the Ciceronian context implies that they were indeed purloined by violence – ‘ripped off ’). They could be transferred to another object. Instead of incurring the expense of having many elaborately decorated objects, in the interests of domestic economy one could have emblemata, which could dress up everyday household objects for special occasions. The implications for Alciato’s ‘emblems’ are many. This imagery is decorative and designed to impress. It is not for the everyday. There may be, further, a hint of deception, dishonesty, even pretentiousness. In the re-application of these emblemata, something plain and ordinary could speciously acquire an appearance of greater worth than it normally had. The decoration disguises the object. It is deliberately made to seem other than it is. Metaphorically, then, emblemata are veiled utterances. The rich design appropriated from somewhere else might merely clothe a simple idea with a portentousness it does not deserve. Or, the applied ornament might reveal a hitherto unsuspected significance. Meaning is generated by dislocation: the familiar, everyday or commonplace is changed by virtue of being placed in another context: it has become the bearer of unsuspected meaning, a metonym for a previously hidden reality. We cannot be sure what Alciato’s intentions were for the new\n\n48\n\nthe emblem\n\ngenre, though we can make some guesses. From his dedicatory epigram to Peutinger, the preface to almost all the editions of the Emblemata, it seems he considered his emblems as poems – epigrams that cleverly describe images, statues, pictures and similar kinds of visual shows. He was happy enough for the images so described to be taken up and used as patterns for badges and decorations. But this task he relegated to artisans. As a scholar and a poet, Alciato styled himself, with whatever degree of self-mockery, as ‘vates’ (a bard): 17 he was more interested in the fact that images could acquire or be endowed with meaning, could be used to communicate ideas. His intention was ‘to describe in each epigram some object from history or the natural world in such a way that it might be endowed with some chosen significance’.18 The nub of the emblem, however, lay in its gnomic allegory – not so much its image, but the compressed verbal utterance of a Pythagorean symbolum.19 Alciato tells us that sometimes the emblem is based on puzzling occurrences in nature, hidden arcane secrets, the sacred wisdom of the ancient sages, the true doctrines concealed beneath the fictitious cortex of a fable, or the learned sayings of philosophers or historians.20 The epigram would be occupied in setting out and explicating the meaning of such recondite facts and problems not so much because they were difficult and strange and required explanation, but because they implied some useful advice that might be applicable to one’s everyday life. This advice was rendered memorable, because it could be summed up in a corresponding image. These images were ‘invented’ in the sense that contemporary rhetoricians used the term. They were not so much ‘made up’ as found (from the Latin verb invenio, find). As a true scholarly humanist, in his poetic work, as in his legal scholarship, Alciato was keen to return ad fontes (to primary sources): historical facts, archaeological records, the literary evidence, etymological inferences or grammatical analysis. He did not disdain the traditional poetic euhemeristic allegories of the gods, demi-gods or heroes or physical allegories of the forces of Nature that ‘Poetry’ from earliest times was held to wrap in ‘Fables and darke stories’.21 Alciato’s emblems sprang from an essentially verbal culture. His ‘In Occasionem’22 (see illus. 13) does not confront a statue, as much as a verbal description of an artefact elicited by a process of question and answer. It is the verbal artificers, the ancient poets, who exert a shaping force on his imagination when he confronts the creatures that lurk in the recesses of rumour and imagination: Scylla, whose white waist is girt with barking monsters, exultant\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n49\n\nDiscord, impious Rage, the snake-eating hag, Envy.23 These are no new inventions, but memories of, and appropriations from, a classically biased education. They provide archaeological literary sites that the emblematist could visit and pillage with profit. The process is one of inexact repetition, for the original is wrenched from its narrative context, fragmented and put together to form a newly constituted verbal artefact. Instead of an image or a memorable phrase being tied inextricably to a given meaning, the essence of this species of symbolism is its extricability. The processes of\n\n13\n\ndetaching words or images from one context and transferring them, with whatever violence, to another are the means by which a chosen significance can be achieved or enhanced. There is a subtle, sardonic distance between the initial recognition of what is already known, and known to have once belonged to someone else, and the coming to terms with the novelty of its relocation. Alciato deliberately emphasized the shock value of this tactic by his wilful roughness of metre, a deliberately licentious poetic style that won admiration and provoked imitation.24 Elsewhere an emblem might be based on a material object – a statue, a monument, a painting, an inscription. The tomb of Aristomenes (illus. 11) is a case in point. The epigram expresses curiosity as to why an eagle should adorn this sarcophagus. The questioner is soon told that the eagle is on this tomb because it is an appropriate sign of the fearless qualities of the dead hero that lies beneath: just as the eagle is pre-eminent among birds, Aris-\n\n50\n\nthe emblem\n\ntomenes is among men. The enigma, if there really ever was one, is soon solved. Yet what is important here is not only the simile that links the bird and the man, but the ontological status of the image itself. It has value because of its physical actuality in validating some moral or spiritual reality. Elsewhere, in similar vein, we have among the emblems little images (sigilla certa) on the tomb of Archilochus (Emblem 51), marble embodiments of the waspish tongue that characterized him in life. Niobe, too, presents a witty case of habeas corpus for the jurist: her tomb does not contain a body, for her body is its own sarcophagus (Emblem 67).25 These symbolic images are material entities – it matters little whether they are described in words or physically present to the eye. The emblem reminds us both of the materiality of the sign, and of the materiality of meaning itself. In still other architectural encounters, question and answer dialogues structure the iconographic interrogation of pieces of ancient statuary. Indeed, we might say that in the corpus emblematum the whole known universe is placed under interrogation. It is not surprising that Alciato should have been a lawyer. But Alciato is particularly drawn to the monumental. Through tactile admiration of the workmanship of the past a hidden allegory is literally anatomized, tied to particular attributes and body parts. This technique is familiar in the epigrams of The Greek Anthology, which Alciato used as the basis of ‘In Occasionem’ (illus. 13) and elsewhere. The famous classical statue stands on tiptoe, wears winged sandals, holds a razor in her hand, the back of her head is bald, a long forelock famously hangs before her face. Each of these details is interpreted in relation to the central concept she embodies: Opportunity. The iconographic syntax is based on a visually structured model. It is the opposite of what we would usually term ‘abstract’, for there is no abstraction here that does not correspond to some obtrusive visual fact. The description is pointed in such a way that the details require, even demand, elucidation and explanation. In Alciato’s epigram and in the Anthology the statue stands in a civilized portico (‘pergula aperta’). But it could not be long before such powerful images would break free from such containment. In the 1583 pictura here reproduced, Occasio towers over sea and land, dwarfing the tiny ships that sail past her ankles. The artist has added his own iconography, for the craft that sustains her in her ocean voyage is none other than Fortune’s wheel. Her habitation amid the waves also associates her iconographically with Fortune. Further, her image accommodates an even more popular\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n51\n\niconography. As she outbraves the elements of wind and tide, she embodies the vernacular form of una fortuna: a storm, a tempest. It is entirely unlikely that such a figure would patiently endure a passing scholar’s polite enquiries in the civilized retirement of a Renaissance garden. Part of what we see in the gap between Alciato’s ‘In Occasionem’ epigram and the woodblock cutter’s interpretation is a manifestation of the cultural difference that divides one half of the sixteenth century from the other, and a widening separation between a learned, erudite, literary iconography and the more popular forms of contemporary visual culture. This mismatch between the author’s ideal classical image and those provided by the artists did not arise simply because the author, after his death, could no\n\n14\n\nlonger control what went on. Nor can we attribute this to the production of new editions that were less in touch with the author’s original intentions. That Alciato’s iconography was genuinely neoteric – or, at least, unknown or unusual, in that it recovers and reintroduces elements from classical antiquity hitherto not generally current – had caused problems from the beginning. The first state of Jollat’s woodcut for Alciato’s emblem ‘Anteros, id est amor virtutis’ (illus. 14) was modelled on Jörg Breu’s woodcut for Steyner’s edition, and, while it corrects some of Breu’s blunders, it perpetuates his principle error. Ubi sunt pennae? (Where are your wings?) asks the epigram. But the question is rendered faintly ridiculous by the pictura, for Jollat’s Anteros is fledged in truly magnificent fashion. The point of Alciato’s epigram is that this virtuous Love is far different from the conventionally flighty and fickle Cupid. The blunder shows not only the artist’s misunderstanding of Alciato’s text, it also indicates that in no way could the artist have been following an author’s manu-\n\n52\n\nthe emblem\n\nscript containing an image to accompany the epigram. Any accompanying image, however roughly drawn, would have made clear the author’s meaning. Jollat’s error was quickly corrected. A second Wechel edition appeared in the same year, 1534, and in it Anteros’ splendid wings were clipped by the simple expedient of chiselling away the offending parts of the woodblock. In the process the overhanging limb of the tree, in whose shade the god sat, was also lopped. It may be that the author himself drew attention to the error, or the mistake was caught in-house. But, whatever happened, for the first time in its printed form the epigram’s question, ‘ubi pennae?’, makes sense, when referred to the pictura. The corrected state of the block was used for all subsequent Wechel editions, and served as a model for the later designs from other presses. So conservative were these that even Jollat’s totally redundant background tree was retained. The significant thing here is that correction is made retrospectively. This is not a case where there is a decline in iconological exactitude, as each subsequent edition departs one step further from the author’s holograph. The later editions are more accurate than the first edition, as each subsequent variant is gradually brought into line with the author’s intention. The second Wechel edition did not complete these processes of emendation, correction and revision. Alciato’s ‘In adulatores’ (On sycophants) is a case in point (illus. 15). This was one of the non-illustrated lemmatized epigrams in Steyner’s edition. Jollat did not have Jörg Breu’s design to follow, and was free to interpret the image as he wished. Steyner’s text, however, offered a hanging side note, which refers the reader to Pliny’s Historia naturalis,26 which describes the exotic beast thus: ‘It has a tail that tapers towards the end and curls in coils like a viper, and crooked talons.’27 It may well be that this marginal note derived from Alciato’s holograph, and that this was as far as he was prepared to go in giving actual visual cues to his readers: he expected them to bring to mind the visual specifics laid down by classical precedent. Jollat did his best to render such specifications to our view, and in its first state his woodcut for this emblem is thoroughly uninhibited. He depicts a fierce monster, with eagle-like claws, a scaly body, prominent snout and sharp teeth. Further, the 1534 text is further muddled by a significant typo, which renders the motto as ‘In adultores’ (On adulterers): the protruding snout, stiff tail, and fishy scales may well have been thought congruent to such a predatory beast. However compelling, this imaginative creation totally ignores the point of\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n53\n\nAlciato’s epigram, which is based more on Plutarch and Erasmus than Pliny,28 and is concerned with court flatterers, not marital infidelity. In a new edition in 1536 the misprint in the motto was corrected, and the earlier woodcut was scrapped. A more plausible, egregiously smiling chameleon was substituted, and the connection between the animal’s hypocritically adaptable behaviour and the mores of the court was established in visual terms by the provision of a fortified tower in the background (illus. 16). The implica-\n\n15\n\ntion is that the chameleon is to be found not only in its wild natural habitat, but its human equivalent is equally at home in the prince’s court. The revised design, whether it originated from the author’s advice to the printer or from Le Fèvre’s attentions as a translator or correcteur to the press, is probably immaterial. The effect was to bring the pictura in line with the author’s ideal intention. Had there been authorial directives from the beginning, these expensive corrections would not have been needed (the revised design was retained in all later Wechel editions). However, a castle background was not considered de rigueur for subsequent woodcut designers at other presses. What we may conclude from the above is that the printers and publishers packaged the author in a different format than he envisaged. When the illustrators took his matter in hand they seem to\n\n54\n\nthe emblem\n\nhave seen this as an invitation to create the author’s imagery in terms of their own visual conventions: they came at it from a different iconographic tradition, that of the popular fable books, illustrated proverbs and a popular tradition of mythography, which provided renditions of the images of classical gods and goddesses in the image and likeness given to them by the sixteenth century. And, although the trade was fundamentally conservative in these matters, one artist did not necessarily feel absolutely\n\n16\n\nbound by the example of his predecessors. The emblem was quickly accommodated to other aspects of this popular contemporary visual culture: that of the heraldic device, the fable, the parable, adages, proverbs, the enigma and the rebus. Alciato’s text, on the other hand, was classically learned and with an antiquarian bent. The first emblems, in more than one way, belonged to a different, earlier age. He recovered a number of ancient images from the past, which were strange to the workers at the press, who simply drew what they knew and thought they saw. But in other ways, too, it had more in common with the literary culture that prevailed at the turn of the century than that of the 1530s.29 To some extent, Alciato’s first emblems had more in common with Pierio Valeriano’s Hieroglyphica and the excitement engendered by the mystery of the Egyptian sacred script, not to mention Francesco Colonna’s erotic novella, the Hypnerotomachia – his encounters with ancient ruined architecture, his tactile admiration\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n55\n\nof cunning workmanship, its visual and verbal puzzles, his adventures with typography, and the delight in the broken and the fragmentary. The rest of this chapter will look at this cultural context. But it is important not to over-generalize. Alciato’s complete emblems were composed over a long period, and they reflect and preserve different literary enthusiasms that he indulged at different periods of his life: hieroglyphs; the artful epigrams of The Greek Anthology; fantasy archaeology; historical narratives; fables and jests. These represent not so much a palimpsest, but the growth rings of a poet’s mind, which reflect the shaping influences on the emblem genre. The reading public at large – as opposed to the intellectual elite for which the manuscript was first designed – was left to puzzle out meanings in the new emblematic construct, which brought them in touch with a territory that was at one and the same time familiar and unfamiliar. But Alciato’s success was that he looked forward as well as back to the erudite labours of the beginning of the century. He did not leave his readers with dry-as-dust conundrums. He discovered a syntax and a grammar of symbolic forms, which encouraged others to imitate him. Or, to use another metaphor, Alciato was the Euclid that provided exemplary symbolic axioms on which a geometry of meaning could be postulated. The underpinning principle of these would be homo omnium mensura: in all his emblematic equations the key point of reference is the human. The punishment of Prometheus, after all, taught him that ‘What is above us has nothing to do with us’.30 This definition of the scope and focus of the emblem was formulated in a theoretical preface to a later emblem book as ‘ut in mundo, sic et in homine’ (As it is in the world at large, so also with humankind).31 The emblem is frequently built on an actual or an implied simile, which relates even the most surprising objects back to the private, the public, the moral, the social, the ethical, the physical, the spiritual, or the financial. In this the emblem has much in common with the Parabolae of Erasmus. As such, they are based on a wide reading of classical and contemporary authors. Animals, trees, flowers and almost everything else assume symbolic roles expressing human values, emotions and ideas. The whole world becomes a literary device, a rhetorical strategy, for exploring these. They are bookish, but always the emblems are concerned with the business of living. Alciato commends the sound and healthy, he reproves the sick and the vicious. The phrase from the Roman comic poet Terence could well be used to sum up\n\n56\n\nthe emblem\n\nAlciato’s attitude: ‘Homo sum; humani nihil a me alienum puto’ (I am a man; therefore I think nothing human is foreign to me).32 In the course of this book, we will see how true that can be.\n\nEgyptian Mysteries It was thought that the Egyptians had contrived a means of evading the curse that followed the fall of the Tower of Babel, by preserving their esoteric wisdom in picture script. The carved stone monuments presented a lasting record, and the symbolism was thought to erect a hedge around their learning, rendering their meaning comprehensible to the learned, while baffling the vulgar and the profane. These hieroglyphic obelisks and pillars were veritable mountains covered with strange characters formed of birds, beasts, discrete human body parts, agricultural implements and kitchen utensils. The ancient provenance of these objects gave them enormous authority. They could not help attracting attention, if only by their sheer bulk, and they continued to exert a mysterious fascination on the Renaissance and Baroque mind. An enduring paper monument to this is the massive three-volume folio of Athanasias Kircher, Oedipus Aegyptiacus (illus. 17). This ‘Egyptian Oedipus’ was none other than Kircher himself, master, according to the fulsome dedicatory verses that prefix the volume ,of ‘chain’d mysterious emblemes, holy rites, / Close riddles, obscure symbols’. The English poem is found on signature ‘+++++2v’ of volume i. Attempts were made early to crack the symbolic code. Greek and Roman authors left a number of tantalizing, scattered references to this ancient script that suggested that it was nothing less than a cryptic record of arcane, sacred knowledge, a whole system of law, theology, philosophy and esoteric wisdom in carved, visible shapes.33 The Roman general Ammianus Marcellinus assumed that ‘individual characters stood for individual nouns and verbs; and sometimes they meant whole phrases’.34 Diodorus Siculus had earlier tried to read this picture script, and was regarded as something of an authority. He saw it as a series of transferred metaphors. Thus, the falcon, the swiftest of birds, became a sign for swiftness, or something done quickly; the crocodile, an evil creature, became a metonym for evil. Ammianus Marcellinus added that ‘scientifically’ recognized and agreed properties of living things and objects (‘rationes physicae’) stood for concepts by a similar process of metaphorical transference:\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n57\n\n17\n\n[B]y a vulture they represent the word ‘nature’, because, as natural history records, no males can be found among these birds; and under the figure of a bee making honey they designate ‘a king’, showing by this imagery that in a ruler sweetness should be combined with a sting as well.35 ‘Et similia plurima’ (And many similar things more) the Roman general added, possibly becoming a little impatient with all of this. These were inferences drawn from a number of scattered interpretations. One can imagine the excitement when, in 1419, a manuscript attributed to ‘Horapollo’ did surface (illus. 18). It purported to be the key to deciphering the Egyptian mysteries and it represented a huge increase in the repertory of interpreted images. We now know it to be a late antique forgery, and the meanings it assigns are ingenious fantasies. But the Renaissance regarded it with unquestioning belief as a sacred text, on the basis of which a lexicon of visual signs could be generated. Ammianus Marcellinus could not have even suspected the huge collection of plurima that\n\n58\n\nthe emblem\n\nPierio Valeriano Bolzani and his imitators would provide, based on these few classical clues. Writers of emblems could not but be drawn to this cognate body of symbolism. Alciato’s first description of his collection of emblems in the letter to Calvo as a libellus nudges us towards the possible ‘Egyptian’ provenance of his book: for the Latin, libellus, could refer to a papyrus scroll. We know Alciato had studied hieroglyphics at Bologna with Filipo Fasanini, the Latin translator of Horapollo, and Karl Giehlow has persuasively demonstrated that Alciato used Fasanini’s translation when composing his emblems.36 The fash-\n\n18\n\nionable enthusiasm for things Egyptian at this time can only be compared to the rage for such things a millenium-and-a-half earlier, when Sylla introduced the cult of Isis to the ancient Roman matrons. Apuleius’ description of her rites (illus. 19) in Book ii of the Metamorphoses, includes a fancy-dress parade of mythological figures – Ganymede, Bellerephon, Pegasus, satyrs – as well as a monkey with a Phrygian cap and a bear dressed as a fine lady. Dionysus of Halicarnassus adds a host of other sacred and profane figures in his description of the Roman festivals: the Sileni, the images of the gods and goddesses with their symbolic trappings, the Graces, the demi-gods, Hercules, Aesculapius, Pan. These remind us of emblems as much for their cast list as for the shared sense of the ridiculous and spirit of festive jollity. Apuleius’ image of an ass with wings glued to its back forms the source of one of Vænius’s love emblems.37\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n59\n\n19\n\nThe ‘Bible’ of hieroglyphic symbolism must surely be the Hieroglyphica of Valeriano. Although not an emblem book itself, it was the source of many emblems. The emblem and the hieroglyph were believed by some to be cognate forms.38 And there are many interconnections. Valeriano and the emblematist Achille Bocchi were friends, and Book VII of the Hieroglyphica is dedicated to him. Thomas Palmer, the first English emblematist, did little more than turn selected passages of Valeriano’s Latin prose into English eights and sixes.39 As if to emphasize their connection, or their confusion in many minds, the fact that although the first published texts of Horapollo and their Latin translations appeared in non-illustrated form, from the 1550s editions of the\n\n60\n\nthe emblem\n\nHieroglyphica employed the common tripartite structure of many published emblems (illus. 20). Valeriano’s attitude to this inherited body of symbolic lore is found in Book VI under the chapter heading ‘arcana tegenda’ (The sacred mysteries must be concealed): ‘the Egyptians had sculptures of Sphinxes in all their temples, to indicate that divine knowledge must be protected from the vulgar by enigmatic symbolism’.40 He believed that God himself was held to communicate with us in just such a sacred script. In the Old Testament the Mysteries of the Gospel were thought to have been delivered to the Children of Israel under the veil of allegorical types and figures, so God’s great\n\n20\n\ntalking with the dead\n\n61\n\nbook of Nature was believed to contain mysterious impressions of the Creator, natural hieroglyphs, significant images that declare His glorious Being. These witty contrivances of the Egyptian priests were designed to bring the human race to a greater knowledge of the meaning of God’s works and of the Creator himself. For those approaching the Hieroglyphica with such lofty expectations, what is revealed when the mysteries are unveiled must come as something of a disappointment. Indeed, at first glance, it is hard to know what the excitement was all about. Valeriano certainly expanded on what he found in Horapollo. He works his way systematically through the whole animal world, starting with the King of Beasts and so on down through the created universe. Browsing through his pages, we find that an angry man was depicted by a lion eating his prey, … a religious person by a lion running away from a cock, … a whore by a lion with a woman’s head: her face is fair, her speech pleasant, her charms powerful, but she preys mercilessly on a man’s body and fortune. The merciful were shown as a lion with a lamb lying at its feet, … an impatient lover as a lion devouring a heart. The elephant signified a king, because it never bows its knee. It is an enemy to serpents, as rulers are to the serpents of the state. It hates swine and filthy creatures, therefore the Egyptians saw it as the promoter of Justice, Peace, and moral Virtue; it was resolute in overcoming difficulties, merciful to the humble, and punished those that resisted royal authority. The elephant, because it was believed to do obeisance to every new moon, was made a hieroglyph of Piety. A priest was depicted by a cynocephalus, a kind of dog-headed ape, riding on a fish in a river: the river is the inconstant world, th"
