Soundway Records reissues a limited 1000 copy run of Nenad Jelić and Laza Ristovski’s seminal new age album Opera from 1986. Combining percussion-laden rhythms with synthesisers, vocal samples, and at times unexpected acoustic instruments, the album became a cult classic amongst fans of fourth world and avant garde music. Nenad Jelić is one of the most original artists to appear on the Serbian music scene, a percussionist obsessed with melody and silence, a multidisciplinary instrumentalist. A member of the line-up of musicians which released the cult album Balkan Impressions, he was one of the originators of the World Music movement in Serbia.
