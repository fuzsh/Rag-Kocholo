        "text": "Picking up the intermittent thread of wild musical brews concocted deeply behind the Iron Curtain. This one came out on state-owned PGP (imprint of Radio Television Belgrade) in the final years of Socialist Yugoslavia. As with Perestroika era in simultaneously unravelling Soviet Union this was politically and culturally milder period, hence the tolerance for weirder music that wouldn't necessarily find state sponsorship earlier. An easier era of growing socio-cultural liberalism preceding disastrous ethnic conflicts and civil war of the 1990s. Or so it seems on the outside. I'm sure the reality was much more complicated...\n\nBut let's not dwell on politics. This feels like a Serbian answer to Trevor Horn's larger-than-life production for various Zang Tumb Tuum acts of the 1980s. Super-producer's tool of choice Fairlight CMI is not used on this one (most likely due to budgetary constraints). However, his signature production is replicated via unspecified \"computer synthesizer\" operated by the keyboardist Laza Ristovski. All that you'd expect from the pioneering sampler - brash orchestral stabs; woozy pitch-shifted choral pads; ethereal bells; p-funk bass; overdriven 'hard rock' guitar tones - is dutifully recreated. Despite mimicking studio techniques of synth pop these sounds are deployed to a much less dance-oriented outcomes. There are nods to traditional music - most obviously Serbian and Romani music, but according to the authors reaching as far as Portuguese urban balladry known as fado. Why fado? I don't know. But its lyrical laments share a certain motivic DNA with Romani music, so maybe that's the connection. Also, in Jelić's arsenal there are exoticizing sonorities on local version of psaltery and an arsenal or radiant idiophones, so one can 'geolocate' to Hassell's phantasmagoric fourth worlds and - on such languid new age inflected shufflers as \"Rumba Balcana\" - over-idealised sunset routines of Balearic cafés. This one is surely the product of its time, but in the most charming way."
