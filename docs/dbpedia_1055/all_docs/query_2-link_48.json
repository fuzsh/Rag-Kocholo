        "text": "I'm also immensely appreciating this seroes. It's made me aware of a few bands that I didn't know existed, and reminded me how great a lot of the others were. For those not familiar, the Yugo prog music scene was to Eastern Europe as Italy was to Western Europe(that is to say, the best!). I expect to see Tako, Ipe i Laza, Soncna Pot, Miha Kralj and others soon. And regardless of what Richard says, that first Gordi LP, Covek, is a killer!\n\nDah (\"Breath\") were formed in Belgrade, in 1972. The members were Zlatko Manojlović (guitar), Branko Marušić Čutura (vocal, guitar), Branko Gluščević (bass) and Radomir Dubičanin (drums). Dah were searching for inspiration in the mythical and literary themes. They appeared at Ljubljana's Boom Festival 1973. After debut single released, Čutura left the band, so Dah continued as a trio with Manojlović as a vocalist.\n\nDah released debut album entitled Veliki cirkus (\"Big Cirkus\") in 1974. The band enjoyed some kind of international success with their hit single Shoshana during their sojourn in Belgium, in 1975. In Belgium, the band used the name Land and featured some new members: Tommy Schpalteholtz and Villy Pulz. The singl Shoshana was released on Polydor, and it raised to No. 1 at the Radio Morocco's tip list. In Luxembourg, the band played some sessions with Dutch prog band Focus. Upon return to Yugoslavia in 1976, Dah released second full-lenght album Povratak (\"Return\"). Dah disbanded soon after Povratak was released. Zlatko Manojlović continued as a solo artist, and with the band Gordi in 1977.\n\nProlog / Prohujalo sa vihorom (\"Prelude / Gone With The Wind\", 1974)\n\nVeliki cirkus (\"Big Cirkus\", 1974)\n\nOsećaj (\"Feeling\", 1976)\n\nSmak (\"Endtime\") is (imo) the best Yugo-prog band. They released eight full-lenght studio albums and three EPs; two albums were re-recorded in English. They were founded in 1973, in Kragujevac, by guitarist and composer Radomir Mihajlović nicknamed Točak (\"The Wheel\"). Other members were Slobodan \"Kepa\" Stojanović (drums), Zoran Milanović (bass), Boris Arandjelović (vocals) and Lazar \"Laza\" Ristovski (keyboards); that's the line-up who relased their first s/t album which featured magnificent side-long instrumental composition Put od balona (\"A Path That Is Made With Baloons\") recorded in one-take. At the second album Crna dama (\"Black Lady\"), recorded in Morgan Studios, London, in 1977 (it was the same studio where Jethro Tull recorded Songs from the Wood), Laza Ristovski left the band to joined Bijelo Dugme, and Smak's new keyboardist become classical music graduated keyboardist Miki Petkovski, and that was Smak's best line-up. On the third album Stranice našeg vremena (\"The Pages of Our Time\") (1978) Miki Petkovski was replaced - after one of many fights in the band - with keyboardist Tibor Levay. After the albums Rock Cirkus and Zašto ne volim sneg (\"Why I Don't Like Snow\"), Smak officially disbanded, though they continued to play gigs from time to time and to record new albums.\n\nSmak's reputation as the greatest (prog) concert attraction in Yugoslavia began with their gig as an opening act for Deep Purple in Belgrade 1975; and although Smak then was virtually unknow band with just one single released, then Deep Purple's manager was asking the boys from Smak to join Deep Purple at their world tour as an opening act, but due to the fact that Točak was terribly suffering of stage fright at whole of his career, he got scared of so much gigs in Japan and so on, and the band sadly rejected that fantastic opportunity.\n\nTheir style was pretty hybrid, but always top of the notch.\n\nPut od balona (\"A Path Made of Baloons\", 1975) instrumental\n\nTegoba (\"Burden\", 1977) instrumental\n\nMatter of Love, 1978, from English version of Crna Dama (\"Black Lady\")"
