        "text": "Bijelo Dugme formed around Goran Bregovic in 1971 under the band name of Jutro. After a few singles and a few years, the band adopted the name Bijelo Dugme.\n\nAs Bijelo Dugme, the band became one of the most important rock bands in Yugoslavia making music througout the 1970's and 80's and undergoing a number of line-up changes before ultimately disbanding in 1989. In 2005 the band came together for a series of reunion concerts, one of which resulted in a live recording being released.\n\nGoran Bregovic is the most prolific and well known member of the band as he had numerous solo recordings and composed music for film.\n\nOriginal member Vlado Pravdic was previously a member of Indexi.\n\nOriginal singer Å½eljko Bebek left the band in 1984 to launch a solo career."
