Aerodrom (in English: Airport) had a similar style of heavy rock (quite mainstream, really) to these groups, though perhaps a little more symphonic at times. Indeed I prefer Aerodrom to Parni Valjtak, particularly their first album Kad Misli Mi Vrludaju.\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1981):\n\n1KAD MISLI Ml VRLUDAJU1979JUGOTON LSY 66072 2TANGO BANGO1981JUGOTON LSY 66117\n\nAtomsko Sklonište\n\nSergio Blažić - lead vocals\n\nDragan Gužvan - electric guitar, vocals\n\nPaul Bilandžić - organ, vocals\n\nDruno Langer - bass\n\nSaša Dadić - drums\n\n\"Atomic Shelter\" were from the Croatian city Pula. Infarkt (1979) came in a cardboard cover with a lavish large booklet full of photographs of the band. Their music was \"no frills\" fast heavy rock, modelled on Deep Purple, Bachman Turner Overdrive (both circa 1972-74) and the like. This is hardly progressive rock, as you know all the chord progressions and guitar versus organ battles from countless other records. Turn off your mind and you might still enjoy their enthusiastic drive. The lyrics are a completely different story, as Atomsko Sklonište were enraged and critical. Their best album Mentalna Higijena (1982) dealt with political manipulation and suppression. From V Vremenu Horoskopa (1980) onwards they abandoned the keyboards and acquired a more \"modern' heavy rock sound (no signs of new wave, though).\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1980):\n\n1NE CVICAY GENERACIJO1978RTV LD 0433 2INFARKT1979RTV LD 0510 3U VREMENEMU HOROSKOPA1980RTV LD 0588 4ATOMSKA TRILOGIJA (LIVE)1980RTV LD 0643 5EXTRAUTERINA1981RTV LD 0721 6MENTALNA HIGIJENA1981RTV LD 0819\n\nALBUMS AS ATOMIC SHELTER:\n\nA1SPACE GENERATION1983RTV LD 0887 A2THIS SPACESHIP1987RTB 2122910 A3CRIMINAL TANGO1990RTV LD 1873\n\nBijelo Dugme\n\nŽeljko Bebek - lead vocals\n\nGoran Bregović - guitars, harmonica\n\nVlado Pravdić - organ, moog, pianos\n\nZoran Redzić - bass\n\nIpe Ivandić - drums\n\nBijelo Dugme from Sarajevo were the most commercially successful Yugoslavian rock band of the 70's. Some of their concerts were attended by more than 100,000 eager rock fans. The leading forces in the group were guitarist and composer Goran Bregović and vocalist Zeljko Bebek. At first, the group was known as Jutro, but they changed name to Bijelo Dugme (White Button) in 1974. Their early singles merged glam rock with heavy rock, which proved to be an effective formula. Their first LP Kad Bi' Bio Bijolo Dugme (1974) contained a couple of long tracks in a heavy progressive style that will appear as kitsch to some listeners (with semi-classical overtones, thus giving a nod to Uriah Heep and Deep Purple). One of the other tracks was a Yugoslavian remake of Chuck Berry's \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\".\n\nŠta Bi Dao Da Si Na Mom Mjesto (1975) veered in the direction of soft heavy rock (aka stadium rock) and manifested their success on the home market. Eto! Baš Hoću (1976) was perhaps their best (and most straight-forward) rock album. Bitanga I Princeza (1979) introduced a softer kind of pop-rock with some orchestrated tracks. Doživjeti Stoti (1980) continued this trend, but was a far more banal album (particularly the adhesive synthesizer backdrop). At the start of the 80's, Bijelo Dugme (as a commercial measure) attempted to adapt new wave influences into their music to match the changing times. In the final analysis, Bijelo Dugme doesn't stand the test of time too well (as they always looked for commercial success) and more lasting statements were left by the likes of YU Grupa, Dah, Drugi Načim, Korni Grupa, Bulldožer, Time and I.S.P.\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1980):\n\n1KAD BI' BIO BIJOLO DUGME1974JUGOTON LSY 63016 2ŠTA Bl DAO DA SI NA MOM MJESTU1975JUGOTON LSY 63046 3ETO!

Pljuni Istinu U Oči (1975) was a kind of musical cabaret incorporating pastiches of different musical genres. A large booklet was attached to the cover, simulating a newspaper much in the same style as Jethro Tull's Thick As A Brick. However, the musical content is more in line with Floh De Cologne, The Fugs, Plastic People and Mothers Of Invention. Original copies on Alta are very hard to find, but a 1981 re-issue on Helidon should be easier to obtain.\n\nZabranjeno Plakatirati (1977) was more stylistically integrated, with five long tracks of weird heavy progressive music with slight jazz touches. The vocals might be disturbing to some (screaming and theatrical), but this is arguably their best musical effort.\n\nThe mini album Žun Bili Pa Vidjeli (1979) and the full-length Izlog Jeftinih Slatkiša (1980) were even more eccentric than past efforts, within minutes covering anything from rockabilly to new wave and from jazz-rock to vaudeville. Unfortunately I don't understand the language, which really is the most important ingredient on all their albums.\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1980):\n\n1PLJUNI ISTINU U OČI1975ALTA ATLP 109 2ZABRANJENO PLAKATIRATI1977HELIDON FLP 05-013 3ŽIVI BILI PA VIDJELI1979HELIDON FLP 05-017 4IZLOG JEFTINIH SLATKIŠA1980HELIDON FLP 05-019\n\n1 RE-ISSUED ON HELIDON (FLP 05-028) IN 1981.\n\nMARKO BRECELJ SOLO:\n\nA1COCKTAIL1974RTV LP 1062\n\nA1 CONTAINED QUITE ORDINARY SONGS WITH AN ORCHESTRAL BACKING.\n\nDag\n\nDragan Popović - guitar, vocals\n\nAleksandar Milovanović - guitar, vocals\n\nGrujica Milovanović - vocals, percussion\n\n+ lots of guests\n\nTheir album is so rare that most Euro-rock collectors don't know about it. It contains pastoral folk-rock a la Spring, Moody Blues, CS&N and Ilous & Decuyper, and features arrangements for three voices with sitar and violin. Side two has three extended tracks and shows them at their best. Indeed, it's a very good album although no masterpiece. 1 believe they came from the Belgrade-area.\n\n1SEĆANJA1974RTB LPV 5238\n\nDah\n\nZlatko Manojlović - vocals, guitar, mandolin (1-2)\n\nBranko Gluscević - bass (1)\n\nVelibor Bogdanović - drums (1)\n\nZdenko Pomper - bass (2)\n\nSteva Milutinović - drums (2)\n\nDragan Mihailović - violin (2)\n\nVeliki Circus (1974) is a very' good hard rock power trio album, comparable to the less blues-based material of Cream (or for the specialists: the majority of releases on the Little Wing label). Indeed, Manojlović's compositions are good examples of how plain powerful rock can be as valid as \"serious\" progressive or jazz-rock. The flexible rhythm section also works really well.\n\nPovratak (1976) was recorded by another line-up and you can easily tell the difference - it's still good but lacks the spark that made the predecessor really stand out.\n\n1VELIKI CIRCUS1974JUGOTON LSY 63015 2POVRATAK1976DISKOS LPD 712\n\nZLATKO MANOJLOVIĆ SOLO (UP TO 1980):\n\n1ZLATKO I NJEGOVE GITARE1980RTB LP 5390\n\nDemoni\n\nThe group was formed after several ex-members of the outstanding group Fir© returned from The Netherlands to Yugoslavia.

Their style was strongly influenced by Deep Purple (their period featuring Ian Gillan) and Uriah Heep. Similarly, the lead vocals of Požgajec were high-pitched, powerful and trembling. The electric guitar is predominant, with organ and flute in lesser roles. It contains six tracks in all, ranging from the original \"Lile Su Kic\" (with a sad, eastern-flavoured melody graced by multi-tracked flutes) to \"Na Mom Dlanu\" almost paraphrasing \"Child In Time\".\n\nThe group later evolved into Nepončin, following a similar path. The 1982 re-union album is rather weak and of little interest.\n\n1DRUGI NAČIN1975RIB 55-5252 2PONOVNO NA PUTU1982SUZY LP 377\n\n1 HAS BEEN REPRINTED SEVERAL TIMES.

This is simply one of the best and most violent power trio albums ever made, featuring a fuzz guitar sound hardly surpassed even by Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Liberman or High Tide. The seven tracks cover the whole spectrum of guitar onslaught from fast-moving hard-rock songs to the 13-minute instrumental inferno title track. That particular track is so powerful that the album should be issued with a warning sign.

More than 10 LPs have been released, although only the earliest are of relevance here. Galija (1979) and Druga Providba (1980) contained soft, song-based progressive rock. They are quite enjoyable overall but also bordering on the tedious.

The group was fronted by the singer and guitarist Drago Mlinarec, who wrote most of the 13 tracks. Those of you who know his solo albums will instantly recognise his style here - conventional pop-folk-rock songs, with only slight beat influences to indicate it was recorded as early as 1968. The album is mega-rare, but of historical rather than musical interest.\n\nThe Grupa 220 collection released in the 80's contained tracks recorded prior to Naši Dani.\n\n1NAŠI DANI1968JUGOTON LPSY-V-753 S11967/68 ORIGINALI1987JUGOTON LSY 63268\n\nSEE ALSO: DRAGO MLINAREC\n\nGrupa 220 (II)\n\nHusein Hasanefendić - guitars, vocals\n\nJurica Paden - guitars, vocals\n\nNenad Zubak - bass, vocals\n\nIvan Stančić - drums\n\nGrupa 220, Mark II, was formed by Drago Mlinarec after he returned from his military service around 1970. Some singles were released under the Grupa 220 moniker, before Mlinarec started his solo career. The group provided the backing to his early 70's albums, but they also recorded on their own. Slike (1975) is a very rare album of melodic heavy rock fronted by twin guitars (reminiscent of early Wishbone Ash). The group then changed their name into Parni Valjak, but never matched the standard of the 1975 album.\n\n1SLIKE1975SUZY LP-319\n\nGRUPA NEPOCIN\n\n.SVIJET PO ROJEM GAZIM1977RTB\n\nIgra Staklenih Perli\n\nZoran Lakić - keyboards, voice\n\nVojislav Rakić - guitar, sound control\n\nPredrag S. Vuković - percussion, visual control\n\nDraško Nikodijević - bass, voice\n\nDragan Šoć - drums\n\nIn 1977 this mind expanding group played their first concert of \"spherical psychedelic rock music\" in Belgrade (their home city). ISP's music was predominantly instrumental with lots of almost spiritual improvisation. Their sound might be compared to Pink Floyd, Can, Tangerine Dream and Hawkwind. Their debut album was recorded in August 1978 at RTB's 24 track studio. The sessions were ridden by several disastrous accidents. Amongst others, the master for two tracks were destroyed, causing the finished album to have a running time of only 28 minutes. It started with ghostly organ tones on \"Gošterov Trg\", strongly related to the late 60's sound of Richard Wright (of Pink Floyd) and Peter Sjardin (of Group 1850). The track eventually grows into an energetic rocker with almost punkish overtones. The instrumental \"Solarni Modus\" had classical overtones and seemed out of place in this context. \"Putovanje U Placo\" featured howling psychedelic guitars steeped in echo effects. \"Pečurka\" was a very different interpretation of Can's 1971 track \"Mushroom\". The grand finale was \"Majestetski Kraj\", which displayed the archetypical, hypnotic ISP-sound. The production was not quite up to standard, leaving the band dissatisfied with the whole work. Still this is an important Yugoslavian rock album.\n\nIn the Spring of 1980 ISP recorded their second album Vrt Svetlosi (Garden Of Light). Unfortunately things fared even worse this time around, soon causing the band to split. The material wasn't up to the standard of their first album and a serious shortage of studio time made matters even worse!\n\nIt was true that ISP had failed to fulfil their full potential on these albums. However, three posthumous releases did something to rectify the picture. The earliest home recordings of ISP appeared on Inner Flow (1992), released on Thomas Werner's (an expert on Yugoslavian rock and general culture) label Kalemedgan. The album is a kind of scrapbook from the band, containing bits and pieces mostly recorded on ordinary MC cassettes (the sound quality ranges from tolerable to terrible) from 1976 to 1979. This sounds similar to listening to bootlegs containing Pink Floyd's radio recordings around 1968-69. Quite a lot of the material is good (reaching a spiritual peak in \"Magic\"), but check out the two other Kalemegdan albums first.\n\nSoft Explosion Live (in Belgrade 1978) contained superior versions of most of their debut album and is the best place to start. Drives was an original \"experiment in time travelling\", according to the band. Using 1977 tape recordings as a basis, Pedja and Joshua added new sounds in 1991 (mostly recording live on two tracks along with the tape playback). The experiment worked well, apart from a few irritating tape dropouts.\n\n1IGRA STAKLENIH PERLI1979RTB LP 5339 2VRT SVETLOSTI1980RTB 2120070 3SOFT EXPLOSION LIVE (1978)1991KALEMEGDAN KD 1 4INNER FLOW (1976-1979) 1992 KALEMEGDAN KD 2 5DRIVES (1977/1991)1993KALEMEGDAN KD 3\n\n500 COPIES WERE ORIGINALLY RELEASED OF 3 AND 4.

Through the years up to 1978 Indexi released a large amount of singles and EPs, but no proper LPs until Modra Rijeka (1978). This was a highly accomplished concept album (based on the poems by Mak Dizdar) including some spoken parts. Rut do not. let this detract from its value as the music is excellent progressive rock. The band continued recording well into the 80's. Sve Ove Godine sums up their career nicely with selections from 1965 to 1986, ranging from beat, psychedelic, pop-rock, heavy-rock and even progressive rock.\n\nS1INDEXI 1974 JUGOTON LSY 61096 S2INDEXI 2 1976 DISKOTON LP 0270 1MOORA RIJEKA 1978 JUGOTON LSY 68042 S3SVE OVE GODINE (4LP) 1986 DISKOTON LP 8180\n\nS3 ALSO MADE AVAILABLE AS A 2CD SET IN 1990.

Stylistically, it fits into the melodic progressive genre with slightly symphonic ornamentations by electric guitars and organ. This sounds more like 1972 than 1977 (if compared to the UK bands). Clearly it's among the best 20 (or so) LPs from Yugoslavia, although the vocals can be annoying at times.

For a short time he was a member of Indexi, but formed his own group in 1968. In their early years only singles and EPs were recorded, some of which later resurfaced on the posthumous Mrtvo More.\n\nAfter two years of inactivity, Kovač started a new Korni Grupa formation in 1971.\n\nKorni Grupa (1972) represented the first progressive rock album in Yugoslavia and, as such, remains a milestone. Its five tracks were dominated by Ković's piano and the distinctive voice of Zlatko Pejaković (who would eventually become a pop singer). The real highlight was the three-part composition \"Put Za Istok\".\n\nNot An Ordinary Life (1974) was recorded in Italy with better sound equipment and more careful production. The material ranged from the complex jazzy progressive rock of the title track to the sentimental (but memorable} ballad \"Generation 1942\". \"Fall Off The Land Of Woman\" was a re-recording of \"Bezglave Ja-Ha Horde\" from their first album. This is one of the best Yugoslavian rock albums ever made, really a great achievement. The Italian edition had English lyrics, unlike the domestic release.\n\nRegretably Korni Grupa disbanded in 1974, leaving behind them almost 20 singles and EPs. The double album Mrtvo More (1975) collected the worst of them (ie: the most commercial tracks), but also two sides of excellent live material recorded in 1974.\n\nSome years after, a more interesting postscript appeared. 1941 was a concept album recorded in 1971 for a Belgrade TV station, but not released until 1979. There was no track separation on the Album, just a continous flow of vocal and instrumental segments. The lyrics were written by Branko Ćopić, while the music, as usual, was written and arranged by Kovač. Featured vocalists were Dado Topić and Josipa Lisac. The album is quite \"Italian\" in spirit, but usually considered to be weaker than Korni Grupa's two first albums.\n\nThe solo albums of Kovač veered in the direction of jazz-rock.\n\n1KORNI GRUPA1972RTB 5222 2NOT AN ORDINARY LIFE1974RICORDI SMRL 6130 (l) 2NOT AN ORDINARY LIFE1974RTB 5842 3MRTVO MORE (2LP)1975RTB 5253/5254 41941 (1971)1979RTB 5374 S1PRVO SVETLO NEOBICNOG ZIVOTA1995KOMUNA (CD)\n\n1 RE-ISSUED ON CD BY SAGLAS IN 1997.\n\n2 RELEASED AS \"KORNELYANS\".

The first album had a nice balance between instrumental and vocal tracks, ranging from soft, pastoral mellotron rock to high flying fusion with guitar and keyboard duels. Most importantly, the tunes are memorable and engaging (some fusion groups sound like they're only performing a kind of technical exercise).\n\nTheir second album was more energetic, heading in a more definitive fusion direction.\n\nRučni Rad (1979) again contained some vocals and some elements of soft symphonic rock.\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1980):\n\n1LEB I SOL1978RTB 5319 2LEB I SOL 21978RTB 55-5335 3RUČNI RAD1979RTB 55-5372 S1ANTHOLOGY (2CD)1994THIRD EAR\n\nLisac, Josipa\n\nThe first album by this talented female vocalist may interest some readers, as most members of the group Time (first line-up) provided the backing (Vedran Bozić, Brane Zivković, Tihomir Asanović, Dado Topić and Ratko Divjak). The tracks have tasteful arrangements with careful additions of strings and occasionally brass. Elements of Yugoslavian folk and progressive rock arc evident on most tracks.

After completing his military service he started his solo career as a singer, guitarist and songwriter. These albums are made up of folk-rock and melodious rock, sometimes reminding one a Yugoslavian version of The Band (diving into domestic folklore rather than Anglo-American). Best was A Ti Se Ne Daj (1971), recorded with the second line-up of Grupa 220. These young Zagreb musicians later recorded Slike in 1975, without any involvement from Mlinarec. Pjesme S Planine (1973) and Rodjenje (1975) were Mlinarec at his closest to progressive rock. The latter had an interesting two-part 16-minute composition with natural sound effects and some extended instrumental parts. The late 70's albums were not up to the standard of the previous ones and will only be of interest to the pedantic collector. Sabrano (1980) consisted of re-recordings of favourite tracks from his earlier albums.\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1980):\n\n1A TI SE NE DAJ1971JUGOTON LPYV-S 50926 2PJESME S PLANINE1972JUGOTON LPYV-S 60995 3RODJENJE1975JUGOTON LSY 63002 4NEGDJE POSTOJI NETKO1977JUGOTON LSY 68037 5SVE JE U REDU1979JUGOTON LSY 66057 6TAKO LAKO1979JUGOTON LSY 66079 7SABRANO1980JUGOTON LSY 66115\n\nNepočin\n\nIsmet Kurtović - guitar, flute, vocals\n\nHalil Mekić - guitar, vocals\n\nDamir Šebetić - keyboards\n\nBožo Ilić - bass\n\nBranko Knežević - drums\n\nKurtović and Mekić had previously recorded an album with Drugi Način and Nepočin continued their style of guitar-based, melodious heavy rock, though not quite as effectively.

Kepa - drums, percussion (1-4)\n\nMiodrag M. Petkovski - (2)\n\nSmak's eponymous first album is among the highlights of Yugoslavian rock, bridging the bold YU Grupa and Black Sabbath heavy-rock influences with a more elaborate progressive rock. The four tracks on side one are nice heavy progressive numbers filled with energetic guitar and organ, but even belter is the ambitious 20-minute \"Put Od Balona\" with multi-layered keyboards (organ and Roland synthesizer feature most frequently, but there are also pianos and mellotron). R. T. Tocak's solo album was similar to the heaviest parts of Smak's first album and is recommended to guitar lovers.\n\nCrna Dama (1977) was a more polished effort and might be labelled \"jazz-influenced, soft heavy-rock\" (this is no contradiction, really!). Parts of it remind me of late 70's Foreigner (which is hopelessly unhip, but not as bad as later Foreigner-albums). Smak incorporated longer instrumental parts, though, and continued in this direction on their subsequent albums, Rock Circus included run-of-the-mill soft-rock with few inspiring moments. Smak were from Kragujevac.\n\n1SMAK1975RTV LP 1079 2CRNA DAMA1977RTB LP 55-5307 S1ULAZAK U HAREM1977RTV LD 0421 3STRACINE NESEG VREMENA1978RTB LP 55-5336 4ROCK CIRCUS1980RTB 2320010\n\n1 RE-ISSUED ON CD AS \"THE BEST OF SMAK\" RTV (DD 0234) WITH THREE EXTRA TRACKS FROM SINGLES.\n\n2 ALSO IN ENGLISH VERSION AS BUCK LADY AND RELEASED IN GERMANY ON BELLAPHON IN 1978.\n\nS1 IS A SINGLES COMPILATION.\n\nRADOMIR TOČAK MIHAJLOVIĆ & SMAK:\n\nA1TOČAK & SMAK1976RTV LP 1152\n\nLAZAR RISTOVSKI AND IPE IVANDIĆ (THE DRUM PLAYER FROM BIJELO DUGME):\n\nB1STIZEMO1978RTV LD 0475\n\nSončna Pot\n\nLado Jaksa - sax, clarinet, mellotron, keyboards\n\nJordan Ganceu - bass, keyboards\n\nRatko Divjak - drums\n\nThis very obscure group recorded one rare album that should interest some readers.

These became key elements of the Tako-sound, highly reliant on Djordje Ilijin's instrumental talents on synthesizer, electric piano and flute. Combined with Dukić's guitars it's tempting to compare their sound to early Camel (or even Focus when stripped of their baroque classical doodlings) Tako's first album was hampered by a rather \"flat\" sound (when compared to expensive studio productions from the West) but is still worthy of your attention - particularly the ambitious, 16-minute track \"Druga Strana Mene\".\n\nU Vreci Za Spavanje (1980) was a much improved effort with regard to the technical quality, but also featured stronger material. Djordje Ilijin's solo album is quite close to the Tako-sound.\n\n1TAKO1978RTV LD 0495 2U VRECI ZA SPAVANJE1980RTB 2120305\n\nDJORDJE ILIJIN SOLO:\n\n1ZABRANJENO PRISLUSKlVANJE1983SUZY LP 408\n\n1 & 2 RE-ISSUED ON VINYL BY KALEMEGDAN (KD4 & 5) IN 1993 WITH NEW COVER DESIGNES.\n\nTeška Industrija\n\nVedad Hadžiabdić - guitars\n\nGoran Kovačević - vocals\n\nGabor Lenđel - keyboards\n\nAleksandar Kostić - bass\n\nMunib Zoranić - drums\n\nA Bosnian progressive heavy rock group and among the better of this genre. Their first single \"Šta Je Rekla Ana\" was published in the Autumn of 1975, paving the way for Ho-Ruk (1976), their best album by far. Influences from Uriah Heep and Deep Purple are present (as with other heavy Yugoslavian rock groups such as Bijelo Dugme on their early albums, Smak and Drugi Načim). Teška Industrija's strength was a kind of finesse, shared with certain Italian heavy progressive groups, regarding the rich vocals {no heavy metal screaming) and elaborate use of multi-tracked electric guitar melody lines, supplemented by string synthesizers and a distant organ.\n\nTheir eponymous second album contained many of the same features, but had a notably weaker melodic content. Zasviraj I Za Pojas Zadjeni (1977) was in some respects their most powerful album, with good tracks such as \"Grijeh\". The standard was variable, though, sometimes sinking down to bland pop-rock.\n\nI have also listed the solo albums of Seid Vajta Memić, the first vocalist of Teška Industrija. His albums contained soft folk-rock.\n\nALBUMS (UP TO 1980):\n\n1HO-RUK1976JUGOTON LSY 63052 2TEŠKA INDUSTRIJA1976JUGOTON LSY 66009 3ZASVIRAJ I ZA POJAS ZADJENI1977JUGOTON LSY 63071 S1SEID MEMIĆ - VAJTA & T.I.1981JUGOTON LSY 61578 S2TEŠKA INDUSTRIJA1994KRIN MUSIC (CD)\n\nS1 CONTAINS RECORDINGS FROM 1975-76.\n\nS2 CONTAINS TRACKS FROM 1, 2 & 3\n\nSEID MEMlĆ VAJTA SOLO:\n\n1ZLATNA RIBICA1979DISKOTON LP 0416 2VAJTA 2 - PONOČNI VALCER1980DISKOTON LP 8001\n\nTime\n\nDado Topić - lead vocals, bass (1-3)\n\nVedran P.

Time's first album was quite similar stylistically to Korni Grupa's first album, containing a mixture of jazzy heavy rock (\"Istina Mašina\") and thoughtful ballads (\"Pjesma No. 3\"). The most progressive track was the 10 minute \"Za Koji Život Treba Da Se Rodim\", displaying virtuoso Hammond organ from Asanović and electric guitar from Božić. This is one of the earliest and best Yugoslavian rock albums.\n\nThis chasm between soft rock ballads and hard rock widened on Time II (1975), which was split between one side of each. \"Da Li Znas Da Te Volim\" belongs to the first category and remains one of Time's most famous and finest songs. The album didn't list any personnel.\n\nTheir final album was much more consistent in sound, but sadly focused on Topic's funky pop-rock aspirations (at times even reminding me of the 70's Stevie Wonder). Still the eight songs attained quite a good standard. Time finally stopped in 1978 after six years and more than 30 line-up changes.\n\n1TIME1972JUGOTON LPY 60978 2TIME II1975RTB 55-5251 3ŽIVOT U ČIZMAMA S VISOKOM PETOM1976RTB 55-5292\n\n1 RE-ISSUED ON CD WITH 2 BONUS TRACKS BY CROATIA RECORDS (5 04371 3) IN 1993.\n\n2 & 3 RE-ISSUED ON ONE CD NAMED \"DADO TOPIC & TIME\" BY KRIN MUSIC IN 1996.\n\nDADO TOPIĆ SOLO:\n\nA1NEOSEDLANI (2LP)1979RTB LP 5352/53 A2SAPUTANJE NA JASTUKU1980RTB 2120410\n\nTIHOMIR POP ASANOVlĆ SOLO:\n\nB1MAJKO ZEMLJO1974JUGOTON LSY 63003 B2TIHOMIR POP ASANOVlĆ1976JUGOTON LSY 63055\n\nT.

YU Grupa from Zemun (near Belgrade) were the Black Sabbath of the region, but thankfully omitted Ozzy's fake occultism. \"War Pigs\" would prove to have a devastating signification for Yugoslavia in the future, but way back in 1973 the Black Sabbath vibes only brought good fortune to YU Grupa's first album - excellent hard rock filled with aggressive guitar riffs and unpretentious songs.\n\nKako To Da Svaki Dun (1974) saw the addition of a second guitarist. The prevailing twin lead guitar interplay brought a more melodic approach, vaguely similar to early Wishbone Ash at times.\n\nYU Grupa's third album was again a power trio effort which returned to the \"no frills\" hard rock, Yo Zlato (1976) was a purposeful collection of singles from 1971-75 and two album tracks from their debut.\n\nMedju Zvevdama (1977) involved three lead guitarists but drifted towards conventional rock and marked a qualitative downward trend.
