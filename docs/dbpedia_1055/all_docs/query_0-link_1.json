        "text": "This is a list of new-age music artists with articles on Wikipedia.\n\nNew-age music is broadly defined as relaxing, even \"meditative\", music that is primarily instrumental. Unlike relaxing forms of classical music, new-age music makes greater use of electronica and non-Western instrumentation. There is some debate on what can be considered \"new-age music\"; for example several musicians in Celtic music or Smooth jazz have expressed annoyance at being labeled \"new-age musicians\". For more on that debate, see the article on new-age music. In addition, several musicians object to the label because they fear it implies a connection to the New Age movement.\n\nA\n\nPhilip Aaberg – pianist\n\nWilliam Ackerman – guitarist\n\nAcoustic Alchemy -band\n\nPaul Adams – guitarist and multi-instrumentalist\n\nAdiemus – band\n\nAeTopus – project by composer/producer Bryan Tewell Hughes\n\nOmar Akram – composer, pianist\n\nAzam Ali – singer, songwriter\n\nAlpha Wave Movement – composer, synthesizer music\n\nAmethystium – band\n\nAncient Future – World music band\n\nDarol Anger – violinist, composer\n\nRomina Arena – vocals, composer, songwriter, producer, piano, violin, guitar\n\nDavid Arkenstone – composer\n\nDiane Arkenstone – composer, pianist, keyboardist\n\nArmik – flamenco guitarist\n\nCan Atilla – pianist, songwriter, violinist\n\nAustralis – composer, producer\n\nPaul Avgerinos – composer, producer\n\nAyana – singer, songwriter\n\nB\n\nB-Tribe – a Spanish trio\n\nEmily Bear – pianist, composer\n\nHennie Bekker – pianist, composer\n\nBenise – flamenco guitarist\n\nThomas Bergersen – composer\n\nDaniel Berthiaume – composer, guitar and keyboards\n\nBiddu – vocalist, music producer\n\nTim Blake – keyboardist\n\nJo Blankenburg – composer, pianist\n\nBlue Stone – band\n\nMoya Brennan – composer, singer\n\nThom Brennan – composer\n\nJim Brickman – pianist\n\nPeter Buffett -pianist, composer\n\nMarkus Burger – pianist, composer\n\nJohn Burke – pianist\n\nRichard Burmer – composer, keyboardist\n\nRay Buttigieg – composer\n\nC\n\nWendy Carlos – composer, keyboardist\n\nStephen Caudel – composer, guitarist, keyboardist, arranger\n\nCeltic Woman – band\n\nCeredwen – duo\n\nSheila Chandra\n\nCraig Chaquico – guitarist\n\nCheckfield – duo, composer, guitarist, keyboardist\n\nSuzanne Ciani – composer, pianist\n\nClannad – band\n\nMichael Colina – composer, producer, pianist, keyboardist, engineer\n\nAl Conti – composer, pianist, keyboardist\n\nJesse Cook – flamenco guitarist\n\nRandy and Pamela Copus – duo known as 2002\n\nCorciolli – composer, musician\n\nCoyote Oldman – band\n\nMichael Cretu – composer, MIDI keyboard, guitar\n\nCusco – band\n\nCFCF\n\nD\n\nDadawa\n\nScott D.
