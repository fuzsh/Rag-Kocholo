        "text": "ULTIMA THULE / AUDION EAST-EURO DISCOGRAPHY\n\nEast-Euro Discography\n\na guide to progressive and experimental music from\n\n\"Behind The Iron Curtain\"\n\nby Steve & Alan Freeman © 1986-2016\n\ncover of the 1994 printed edition\n\nThe original introduction...\n\nAs promised back in Audion #18, here we present our exhaustive discography of progressive and experimental music from the former \"Iron Curtain\" European countries. This is something that we believe has not been catalogued before, and thus it should prove to be an indispensable guide to all fans of adventurous music. With the unique political and social climates in these countries, it seems unlikely that the unique music that emanated from there would ever have existed; revolutionary bands like SBB, Collegium Musicum, Osjan, Gunesh, Phoenix, Gorizont, or Kolinda, to name just a few!\n\nAs you can well imagine, with no documented catalogues to work from, this was not an easy listing to compile by any means, and also in no way do we claim it to be complete, as the proliferation of quality music in Eastern and Central Europe is so great and very much an ongoing thing. Also, much of it is so hard to find, what with most of the LP product listed here now being deleted, and a lot of it is extremely rare! Thus, without any proper international distribution for such music, it's so easy to miss out on things.\n\nSo, what we've attempted to do is: list all groups, musicians and composers of interest who have released something, in the fields of progressive, adventurous or experimental musics, the type of things you would expect to see in the pages of Audion. I have, however, omitted the more mainstream rock and new-wave acts. So if something isn't here, consider that it's probably not listed because it's too commercial. I was going to compile a list of items to avoid, but such a task would be too vast. And, after all, what would be the point?\n\nThis new edition...\n\nThis is a new unpublished version of the Audion East Euro Discography. Originally authored by Alan Freeman and edited by Steven Freeman, and published in 1993 as a magazine (now out of print). It was then revised and updated by Steve Freeman a decade later with the intention of doing a new printed edition. Back in 2003 however the shear volume of reissues and the lack of online resources meant it was impossible to keep updating and revising for a publication and thus it was put on hold. Steve continued to add some more info up to 2011, and since then a few missing albums, catalogue numbers and dates have been added, with the addition of interesting items from a \"research binge\" compiled by Alan Freeman in 2015 and a final revision adding everything else I could think of in July/August 2016 when editing this html version.\n\nThese discographies generally cover all rock, prog, jazz and fusion (plus some electronic and contemporary music) of the late 1960s through to the early 1980s in all related genres. From the 80s onwards often only those of the prog/fusion/underground genres that continued or were established later are covered. The discographies here generally cut-off at around 2000 (with some exceptions) with release updates and some reissues to circa 2003. The countries covered are those behind the former \"Iron Curtain\" and all the former Soviet States of the USSR (which when including states like Turkmenistan does go beyond geographical Europe).\n\nA last addition here is the review and article snippets from Audion Magazine and The Crack In The Cosmic Egg, which are shown in italics. Many of these are from the early \"Behind The Iron Curtain\" articles, or from other reviews and features, much of it written 20-30 years ago (so take that into account please with descriptions and terminology) of which some are abridged to avoid too much duplication.\n\nFor simple html compatibility the discography does not use country specific special characters, but only those accessible from a standard English keyboard. Countries here are represented as they are now (to the best of our knowledge).\n\nThe East Euro context...\n\nThe main reason for making this discography available is that, against all the odds, and with very state controlled censorship, some amazing music slipped through that may never have existed in a standard capitalist music industry. It was an era of unlikely inventions with the jazz and arts fronts trying to make some sense of it and legitimise it all in some way. Thus you had the unlikely things happening like a Czech beat band working with a jazz orchestra creating a music unlike anything anywhere else, Transylvanian, Bohemian and Balkan cultures mixing with rock, jazz and electronic musics, with many unique innovations. There is no other publication or resource that investigates the scene from the viewpoint of an experimental music fan, so it made sense to revise and expand it as much and as informatively as possible. Of course, this is all amongst the huge trudge of safe pop, and dreadful drivel. Hopefully this discography makes sorting out the gems that little bit easier. And, what's more, this edition is completely free!\n\nTop 30\n\nA recommended beginner's guide to rock and fusion albums\n\nCollegium Musicum - Konvergencie / Convergencies\n\nEast - Az Aldozat [Szodoma] / The Victim [Sodom]\n\nElectra - Adaptionen\n\nEnergit - Energit\n\nFermata - Fermata\n\nFiryuza - Firyuza\n\nFlamengo - Kure V Hodinkach\n\nGunesh Ensemble - Looking At The Earth\n\nHorizont - Letniy Gorod / Summer In Town\n\nIgra Staklenih Perli - Igra Staklenih Perli\n\nIn Spe - In Spe\n\nJazz Q Praha - Pozorovatelna / The Watch-Tower\n\nKaseke - Poletus\n\nKornelyans - Not An Ordinary Life\n\nModry Efekt - Svitanie\n\nNiemen / Aerolit - Katharsis\n\nPhoenix - Formatia Phoenix / Cei Ne-Au Dat Nume\n\nThe Plastic People - Egon Bondy's Happy Hearts Club Banned\n\nProgres 2 - Dialog S Vesmirem\n\nReportaz - Reportaz\n\nKrzysztof Sadowski And His Group - Three Thousand Points\n\nSBB - Nowy Horyzont\n\nSepsis - Liturgia Bezumia\n\nSezon Dozhdei - Vozvrashenie\n\nSkaldowie - Krywan Krywan\n\nSolaris - Marsbeli Kronikak / The Martian Chronicles\n\nSoncna Pot - Soncna Pot\n\nStern Meissen - Reise Zum Mittelpunkt Der Menschen\n\nTako - Tako\n\nMichal Urbaniak - Super Constellation\n\nCountries\n\nBulgaria\n\nCzechoslovakia: Czech Republic, Slovakia\n\nEast Germany / DDR\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nUSSR: Russia, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan\n\nYugoslavia: Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia, Slovenia, Yugoslavia\n\nno info known: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Herzegovina, Montenegro\n\ninfo key\n\nbold type = a useful beginner's guide of highly recommended and/or best albums by an artist.\n\nLP: usually vinyl album, MC: Music Cassette, CD: Compact Disc, 7\": single, etc.\n\n> = featured on various artist release (elsewhere in this discography if no release info is given)\n\n/ = either: A / B sides of a record/single, or foreign / English versions of title\n\n# = the referenced line-up relates to the album indicated below\n\n© = known copyright year of the release (dates in front will be recording dates)\n\n\"title in quotes\" = own translation (except Cyrillic titles with are transliterated)\n\ntext like and many more usually indicates a discography cut-off at 1980 (or as deemed appropriate)\n\nBELARUS\n\nFormer USSR state during the Eastern bloc years (aka Byelorussia), landlocked between Poland, Russia and other countries.\n\nAPPLE TEA\n\nIgor Satsevich (bass guitar), Alexander Sapega (drums), Oleg Doroshin (guitar) and Sergei Lapkovski (keyboards).\n\nLightweight jazz-fusion in ECM vein with Scandinavian edges, and a little Chick Corea in the piano.

Initially they were a reasonably good progressive band with strong keyboards and folk influences, hints of Procol Harum and Kornelyans, with the debut about half excellent.

Well, one could say they were the most seriously \"classical\" avant-garde ensembles to exist in that world of early Nurse With Wound, seamlessly bridging Dadaism, electronics, improvisational elements and electroacoustic reconstruction. And, that they came from Yugoslavia made it all the more fascinating, with a bizarre mixture of cultural elements. Musica Elettronica Viva and Nuova Consonanza are other good reference points to the bizarre sonic/cosmic creations of Acezantez, which utilised all manner of percussives, keyboards, voices and occasional solo instruments like trumpet, tuba and violin. The underlying humour in it adds that Dada edge, which is mostly in the vocal elements, though some cliched folk and popular styles are hinted as if they wash in from occasionally opening windows. The whole of the original album has this otherworldly magic that cannot be simply described in such a review, it's altogether too unique.\n\nACEZANTEZ (LP: Jugoton LSY 66020) 1973+1976 © 1977\n\nDUBRAVKO DETONI WITH ACEZANTEZ (CD: Paradigm PD 11) © 2000 - reissue with 3 bonus tracks [1973-1975]\n\nAERODROM\n\nJurica Padjen (guitar, vocals), Zlatan Zivkovic (guitar, piano), Mladen Krajnok (keyboards, vocals), Remo Cartagine (bass), Paolo Sfeci (drums)\n\nHeavy symphonic from Zagreb, similar to Parni Valjak, at the start.

Well, what can a female vocalist/violinist and a drummer do? Quite a lot actually. Though the musical fabric is loose, this is exceptionally inventive engaging and expressive music: quirky, fragmented and powerful, brilliant gibberish and sung vocals from Iva, spectacular rhythmic and solo violin, plus amply dynamic and wide ranging percussives from Pavel.

It's a pity they couldn't think of a group name, though. So, the legacy of the Plastic People Of The Universe lives on, here with a really strange collection of folk, jazz and mangled rock mutations, typical of the radical Czech sound, and a hell of a lot more creative than anything since the very early Plastic People recordings. This is dark, unconventional rock, with liberal doses of Central European culture. There are strange bits of poetry juxtaposed against radical music, along with freaky jazz edges, Gothic and dark symphonics, and the most peculiar of songs. It's fascinating, if not immediate, stuff that's totally uncommercial whilst totally musical.

The second album PIKNIK had a very different funky and brassy feel.\n\nAudion extract: Probably feeling cornered by Kratochvil's music, ex-Jazz Q guitarist Lubos Andrst formed Energit together with keyboardist Emil Viklicky. Their debut was even better than anything Jazz Q produced. Still with that spacey edge, but with lots or energy too - Energit lived up to their name! With a great rhythmic base, ever changing but riffing structure, the 17 minute \"Rano\" recalls both classic Miles Davis and Terje Rypdal, but with electric sax as winds soloist. Their second PIKNIK was a very different affair, this featured lots of winds, shorter composed pieces as opposed to the free-riffing of the first, often more what one would expect from George Gruntz or Manfred Schoof. Latterly, Andrst pursued a solo career, Viklicky worked with the piano trio Klavesova Konclava and later in Okno with Bill Frisell.\n\nENERGIT (LP: Supraphon 1 13 1787) 12/1974 © 1975 #\n\nMini Jazz Klub 6 (7\" EP: Panton 33 0392) 14/6/1976 © 1976\n\n> JAZZROCKOVA DILNA 2\n\nPIKNIK (LP: Panton 11 0695) 1-2/1978 © 1978\n\n> BRATISLAVSKE DZEZOVE DNI 77\n\n> BRATISLAVSKE DZEZOVE DNI 78\n\nETC...\n\nVladimir Misik (vocals, guitars, kazoo), Pavel Fort (guitars), Petr Pokorny (guitar), Jan Hruby (violins, tambourine), Anatloi Kohout (drums, percussion)\n\nVladimir Misik, formerly with the pop / beat band George & Beatovens in 1968 and then Flamengo, formed Etc... as his all-purpose rock and fusion band with a constantly changing cast of musicians and collaborators.\n\nVLADIMIR MISIK ETC...

Most of what I've heard by his band however has been less than impressive, a mixing of jazz-rock and blues with little merit or distinction. Far better were an earlier band he was involved with, namely Flamengo. Their 1972 album KURE V HODINKACH has just been reissued. A kind of jazzy parallel to M.Efekt I suppose. or even bands like Colosseum or Tasavallan Presidentti, Flamengo's style was an intricate and finely crafted progressive- fusion featuring lengthy instrumental breaks and solos from numerous instruments.\n\nwith Petr Novak: Ja Budu Chodit Po Spickach / Povidej (7\": Supraphon 043 0296) 5/6/1967 © 1967\n\nwith Karel Kahovec: Vyber Si Palac / Svou Lasku Jsem Rozdal (7\": Supraphon 043 0329) 6+7/1967 © 1967\n\nPani V Cernem / Nahrobni Kamen (7\": Supraphon 043 0345) 7+9/1967 © 1967\n\nDzban / Poprava Blond Holky (7\": Supraphon 043 0362) 6+10/1967 © 1967\n\nwith Karel Kahovec: Co Skrývas V Ocich / Zavrazdil Jsem Lasku (7\": Supraphon 043 0457) 6/1977+2/1968 © 1968\n\n> NIGHT CLUB '68\n\n> 2.

They eventually become the vehicle of Chic Corea inspired keyboardist Martin Kratochvil, making a synth fronted fusion in the ECM type style. Jazz Q were a revolutionary fusion band, pioneering the Czech jazz-rock sound.\n\nAudion extract: Jazz Q (aka Jazz Q Praha) were one of the foremost and innovative of Czech jazz-rock groups. Arguably in similar realms to Nucleus at the start, they developed a sophisticated fusion with. a very spacey sound, especially on THE WATCHTOWER which had just five tracks of rather understated atmospheric jazz. Vocalist Joan Duggan, who was a guest here, had a greater role in the album SYMBIOSIS which moved dangerously close to soul at times. In time, keyboard player and leader Martin Kratochvil took over the band completely, putting his keyboards at the front of the sound and moving the Jazz Q style closer to the likes of Return To Forever with albums like ELEGY and TIDINGS. If these had been released on ECM, Jazz Q would have become a household name.\n\n> ZURICH JAZZ FESTIVAL 1971 (2LP Germany: MPS Records 33 21277-7) © 1971\n\nPOZOROVATELNA / THE WATCH-TOWER (LP: Panton 01 0285/11) 29/1/1973 © 1973 #\n\nSYMBIOSIS (LP: Supraphon 115 1356) 3-10/1973 © 1973 (CD: Bonton 71 0671-2) © 1998 - 1 bonus track\n\nMini Jazz Klub 5 (7\" EP: Panton 33 0381) 9/1976 © 1976\n\nELEGIE / ELEGY (LP: Supraphon 115 1983) 2-3/1976 © 1976\n\n> JAZZROCKOVA DILNA\n\n> JAZZROCKOVA DILNA 2\n\nwith Marta Elefteriadu: Horizont / Horky Vitr (7\": Panton 44 0593) 27/10/1977 © 1978\n\nwith Oskar Petr: Obchodnik S Destem / Blues Podzimniho Dopeldene (7\": Panton 8145 0004) 28/2/1979 © 1979\n\nwith Oskar Petr & Zuzana Michnova: Podzinmy Obnicky / Plavec Dlouhych Trati (7\": Supraphon 1145 2295) © 1979\n\nPecet' / Kresadlo (7\" EP: Panton 8135 0007) © 1979\n\nZVESTI / TIDINGS (LP: Supraphon 1115 2450) 11-12/1977 © 1979 (LP: Amiga 8 55 723) © 1980\n\nHODOKVAS / FEAST (LP: Supraphon 1115 2604) 3/1979 © 1980\n\n> JAZZ A LA CARTE\n\nHVEZDON / ASTEROID (LP: Supraphon 1115 3525) © 1984\n\nwith Jana Koubkova: Zly Sen / Ovci Vlna (7\" EP: Panton 8135 0217) 1/1984 © 1984\n\nwith Jana Koubkova: Jsem Sva (7\": Panton 8143 0217) © 1984 - B-side only\n\n> BAZAREM PROMEN\n\n1974-75 LIVE (CD: Bonton 71 0030-2 911) © 1991- official issue of a bootleg\n\nJAZZROCKOVA DILNA\n\nJoan Duggan (vocals), Lubos Andrst (guitar), Martin Kratochvil (electric piano, Moog), Jan Martinec (soprano sax, violin), Petr Kolinek (bass), Josef Vejvoda (drums), Jiri Tomek (percussion)\n\nImpromptu session band featuring Jazz Q members.\n\n> JAZZROCKOVA DILNA\n\nJESTE JSME SE NEDOHODLI\n\nPetr Lisku (vocals), Stanislav Filip (guitars, synthesizer), Karel David (bass, vocals), Ivo Horak (guitar), Petr Hromadka (drums, synthesizer) #\n\nOff-beat and highly inventive rock fusion, comparable to RIO bands like Debile Menthol, Etron Fou, etc.\n\n> CZECH!

EFEKT, aka BLUE EFFECT] Originating as a blues and beat group, and fronted by the uniquely styled guitarist Radim Hladik. After successful excursions into jazz fusion, later albums developed a dynamic progressive and space-rock style akin to Eloy or Progres 2 at their best. Modry Efekt are justly classed as one of the finest of Czech 70s progressives.\n\nAudion extract: As far as I know, the earliest exponents of Czech rock were a band called Modry Efekt, or in English - The Blue Effect. An early white blues band, M.Efekt, led by talented guitarist Radim Hladik, had a penchant for invention. Although this wasn't realised at first, co-operation with the Prague jazz-rock group Jazz a changed the bands direction entirely. CONIUCTIO crossed psychedelic rock and jazz most powerfully, long tracks with great energy and lots of Radim's superb guitar. Obviously invigorated by the new musical freedom open to him Radim's next project was a great big band jazz-rock spectacular: NOVA SYNTEZA, and its companion NOVA SYNTEZA 2 which followed 2 years later, combined the power of M.Efekt's music with a huge jazz orchestra. The effect was a powerful, superbly crafted and innovative music, a veritable playground for Radim's amazing guitar. As if to signify a new era, a move to progressive realms, the next album was simply entitled MODRY EFEKT & RADIM HLADIK (an export issue of this released with the title A BENEFIT OF RADIM HLADIK). Like the first NOVA SYNTEZA this was an instrumental album, predominantly featuring lengthy tracks full of invention, power and an abundance of solos. Subsequent albums, which featured Synkopy keyboard player and vocalist Oldrich Vesely, were firmly within the progressive/space-rock mould, none more powerful than the spectacular SVITANIE, and then onto the realm Eloy or East with SVET HLADACU and 33 - both of which contain heavily synthesized instrumentation, really great guitar and a unique song style\n\nSlunecny Hrob / I've Got My Mojo Working (7\": Panton 04 0201) 1/2/1969 © 1969\n\nSnakes / Sen Neni Vecny / Sun Is So Bright / Blue Taxi (7\" EP: Panton 03 0203) 1/2/1969 © 1969\n\nFenix / Stroj Na Nic (7\": Supraphon 043 0857) 9/1969 © 1969\n\nMEDITACE (LP: Supraphon 113 0689) 4-8/1969 © 1969, English vocal version: KINGDOM OF LIFE (LP: Supraphon 113 1023) 1969-1970 © 1971\n\nNOVA SYNTEZA (LP: Panton 11 0288) 20/7/1971 © 1971, (CD: Bonton 71 0552-2) © 1997 - plus 3 tracks from KINGDOM OF LIFE\n\nEldorado / Divko Z Kamene (7\": Supraphon 043 1459) 20/11/1972 © 1973\n\n> HALLO, NR. 9\n\n> HALLO, NR. 10\n\nNOVA SYNTEZA 2 (LP: Panton 11 0489) 8/1973-4/1974 © 1974 (CD: Bonton 71 0608-2) © 1997 - plus Eldorado / Divko Z Kamene single\n\nA BENEFIT OF RADIM HLADIK (LP: Supraphon 113 1586) 3-6/1973 © 1974, aka MODRY EFEKT & RADIM HLADIK (LP: Supraphon 113 1777) © 1975, (CD: Bonton 495274-2) © 2000 - plus their HALLO contributions\n\n> STARE POVESTI CESKE\n\nSVITANIE (LP: Opus 9116 0541) 1/1977 © 1977 #, (CD: Opus 91 2629-2 311) © 1998 - plus their STARE POVESTI CESKE contribution\n\nSVET HLADACU (LP: Panton 8113 0068) 9-12/1978 © 1979, (CD: Bonton 494002-2) © 1999 - plus 3 singles\n\nZena V Okne / Zname Se Dal (7\": Supraphon 1143 2432) © 1980\n\n33 (LP: Supraphon 1113 2897) 10/1980 © 1981\n\nNezna / Zahada Jmeli (7\": Supraphon 1143 2730) © 1980\n\nDoktor / Cajovna (7\": Supraphon 1143 3381) 4/1986 © 1987\n\nKampa / Uhel Pohledu (7\": Supraphon 11 0265-7311) © 1989\n\nMODRY EFEKT & JAZZ Q\n\nRadim Hladik (guitar, effects), Jiri Kozel (bass, guitar, bells), Vlado Cech (drums), Jiri Stivin (flutes, alto sax, piccolo, wood blocks, effects), Martin Kratochvil (piano, organ, trumpet), Jiri Pellant (bass), Milan Vitoch (drums, bells)\n\nFiery psychedelic-sounding jazz-rock.

Existing since the late 1960s, and often very radical, the early recordings sound quite psychedelic and amateurish, yet have an angry and appealing charm. Nowadays they play a far more tame music.\n\nAudion extract: Kissing Spell reissues - The most notorious of Czech underground bands, and thus the most publicised internationally, most of the PPU back-catalogue was previously issued on CD by the now defunct Globus International label. But it was still a surprise to see a few PPU reissues coming out on the generally British psych oriented Kissing Spell label. These three seem to be the start of a series, all with a complete make-over, new presentation, and historical booklets in English for the first time! MAN WITH NO EARS documents the early history of the band, often as a really crappy beat combo with the attitude of punk bands a decade later. A few Zappa numbers (and other familiar covers) translated into Czech also feature. The big chunks of talking are of course a waste of space to non-Czech ears. And those songs sung in English are turgidly torturous. Maybe they were sometimes deliberately bad, and it seems the audience agreed shouting abuse at them. Only the latest tracks on this disc appealed to me. But such was the underground political/musical climate of Czechoslovakia circa 1969-1972. The notorious international debut EGON BONDY'S HAPPY HEARTS CLUB BANNED recorded in 1976 still remains one of their finest moments, yet after a number of CD issues previously this seems to be the first to be sourced from the master tapes, yet still doesn't quite sound the same as the original LP to me. But, whatever, this was the definitive refined mixture of polit-rock, RIO fusion with a great deal of unique innovation. Kind of Zappa meets Henry cow with a good deal of Balkan style culture thrown in. It's totally eclectic and often tongue-in-cheek, and it all works even if you don't understand any of it. I'm not so sure if the bonus tracks were such a wise choice though. BEEFSLAUGHTER (previously issued as HOVEZI PORAZKA) turns out to be an album I'd previously overlooked, possibly due to it being an originally unreleased album dating from 1982-1984, in between the disappointing LEADING HORSES and MIDNIGHT MOUSE. Remarkably this is quintessential PPU firmly in the mould of the classics EGON BONDY'S... and PASSION PLAY, but on a more intricate and technical level. Uniquely PPU, true, but it also reminds me of many earlier French acts like Komintern's LE BAL DU RAT MORT or Maajun's VIVRE LA MORT DU VIEUX MONDE, and I guess the subject matter here is similarly wry and anarchistic.\n\nEGON BONDY'S HAPPY HEARTS CLUB BANNED (LP, France: Invisible S.C.O.P.A. 10001) 1976 © 1978 # (CD, France: Buda 82478-2) © 198?, (LP/CD: Globus International 210128-1318/2318) © 1992 (CD, UK: Kissing Spell KSCD 803) © 2004 - different mix, plus 7 bonus tracks\n\nPASIJOVE HRY VELIKONOCNI / PASSION PLAY (LP, Canada: Bozy Mlyn BM 8001) 1978 © 1980 (LP/CD: Globus International 210129-1318/2318) © 1992 (CD: Globus International 210214-2318) © 1998\n\nTHE 100 POINTS (MC, USA: Eurock EDC01) 1977 © 1980, aka KOLEJNICE DUNI (CD: Globus International 210217-2) © 2000 - 5 bonus tracks [1978-1982]\n\nLEADING HORSES (LP, Canada: Bozy Mlyn BM 8301) 1981 © 1983 (LP/CD: Globus International 210131-1318/2318) © 1992\n\nMIDNIGHT MOUSE / PULNOCNI MYS (LP, UK: Freedonia 1436) 1984 © 1987 (LP/CD: Globus International 210133-1318/2318) © 1992\n\nBEZ OHNU JE UNDERGROUND (LP/CD: Globus International 210122) 4/12/1992 © 1992\n\nFRANCOVKA (LP/CD: Globus International 210126-1318/2318) 1974-1979 © 1992\n\nELIASUV OHEN (LP/CD: Globus International 210127-1318/2318) 6/1972+6/1974+2/1976 © 1992\n\nSLAVNA NEMESIS (LP/CD: Globus International 210130-1318/2318) 1979 © 1992\n\nHOVEZI PORAZKA (LP/CD: Globus International 210132-1318/2318) 1983-1984 © 1992 (CD: Globus International 210218-2318) © 1997, aka BEEFSLAUGHTER (CD: Kissing Spell KSCD 809) © 2004\n\nELIASUV OHEN (8LP/8CD: Globus International GE 0251-0266) © 1992 - limited edition box-set with book & T-Shirt\n\nVOZRALEJ JAK SLIVA (CD: Globus International 210211-2) 1973-1975 © 1997\n\nJAK BUDE PO SMRTI (CD: Globus International 210215-2) 1979 © 1998\n\n1997 (CD: Globus International 210240-2) © 1997\n\nand more since!\n\nPRAZSKY VYBER\n\nMichal Kocab (pianos, clavinet, synthesizer), Ondrej Soukub (bass), Vratislav Placheta (drums), Ladislav Malina (drums), Zdenek Fiser (guitar), Martin Koubek (guitar), Jiri Niederle (tenor/soprano saxes) #\n\nInitially a jazz-rock band formed by Michal Kocab.
