        "text": "In the Balkans, wind instrument kaval has been present in rural areas as a shepherd instrument. Data about the presence of kaval in Serbian tradition were not wider known or studied for quite a long time. The renewed interest for playing and building in Serbia kaval took place, by concurrence of circumstances, in Belgrade during the 1990s under the influence of Macedonian two-part bourdon playing and within the course of revelation of neo-Byzantine Orthodox Church Chant. The paper has been founded on the new approach to the data about renewed kaval repertoire in Serbia and on the narratives about it. In the text the following aspects will be studied comparatively: 1) common musical components of Macedonian bourdon kaval play, of neo-Byzantine Church Chant and of kaval and ney practices on the Near East, and 2) semantics of playing and the sound of revived kaval in Serbia in comparison to the symbolic of kaval and ney in Sufi tradition on the Near East.\n\nThis work focuses on the role of the composer Vladimir (Vlada) Jovanović in the renewal of church Byzantine music in Serbia from the 1990s until today. This multi-talented artist worked and created art in his native Belgrade, with creativity that exceeded local frames. This research emphasizes Jovanović’s pedagogical and compositional work in the field of Byzantine music, which mostly took place through his activity in the St. John of Damascus choir in Belgrade. The author analyzes the problems in implementation of modal church Byzantine music, since the first students did not hear it in their surroundings, as well as the responses of the listeners. Special attention is paid to students’ narratives, which help us perceive the broad cultural and social impact of Jovanović’s creative work.\n\nIn the focus of this paper lies Byzantine church music as a field for ethnological and anthropological research. In this respect, music is observed as a cultural practice which has an impact on interpersonal communication. The aim of it is to point to all the possible ways in which knowledge and scientific approach from the fields of ethnology and anthropology can be applied to Byzantine church music. When studying this kind of music, it is necessary to perceive a wider social context and a complex network of different factors which affected and are still affecting its creation and development. Research can be conducted on several levels, depending on the what is placed in the centre of the research - the creators of music, music as an audible-meaningful message or its listeners-the receivers of the message. It is necessary to apply a comparative method – in terms of different social and cultural settings – in order to perceive the role of Byzantine church music in the intercultural dialogue.\n\nThe paper treats music tradition and musical practices of the majority of settlers in Belgrade in the 1990s, who arrived in large compact groups and whose musical practices were most markedly pronounced. This majority of newcomers consisted of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) from the war-stricken territories in the 1990s. Thus, the situation of these settlers was quite specific: it involves the \"phenomenon of forced migrations caused by wars and interethnic conflicts at the territory of former Yugoslavia\" (Ladjević, Stanković 2004: 3). The great majority of newcomers were Serbs, refugees from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as IDPs from Kosovo and Metohija. War and destruction were devastating for the traditional musical heritage in the regions where it occurred. In the new conditions and new surroundings, it was renewed in some cases, while in others it was denied and got fused with other music genres. It may be observed that refugees from the western parts of the former Yugoslavia in their musical practice in Belgrade rely considerably on their traditional rural idiom. Settlers from the south parts of Serbia, on the other hand, keep standard features of the town songs. There are also the two main tendencies in music-making in the new settings: the one - to keep and renew the features of the musical idioms of the home counties, and the other - towards the \"new-composed\" genre, including acceptance of the new elements of group identity.\n\nIn the focus of this paper lies Byzantine church music as a field for ethnological and anthropological research.

This paper contributes to this particular interdisciplinary genre by contextualising and describing a well-known children’s choir in Serbia that practices and performs in the Belgrade Orthodox Cathedral (Saborna Crkva). This church occupies an important geographic, political and religious position in the culture of historical Belgrade. There has been a choir in this space operating continuously since 1853, The First Belgrade Singing Society, Prvo Beogradsko Pevacko Drustvo (PBPD), and in 1981 the children’s choir (DHPBPD) was founded. In this paper we historically locate the church and choir and describe the present activities of the children’s choir. This latter we do through an interview with the director and some illustrative observations of two sisters who are participants in the choir. The concluding discussion includes an exploration of musical culture, community and identity. We use the Vygotskian concept of perezhivane to link the emotional experience of the children with the adult culture and history to explain why participation in the children’s choir has been such a significant part of cultural learning and identity formation."
