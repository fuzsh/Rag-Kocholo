        "text": "cogsncogs said:\n\nI just don't see much of that excitement today, it mostly sounds all the same to me. Music made for people with short attention spans and memories, hehe. Here today gone next month. Trendy, trendy.\n\nsounds about right to me\n\nBut then again with all the cool changes in a progressive rock song you could say were the ones who have short attention span because we get bored to quick if a song is samey.\n\nWhen i listen to a hip hop or r&B song on the radio i will probably turn it off but it can even sound like the song that was played 3 minuites before and that might be a rock song..\n\nI dont think the people that create new exiting music get a chance in the music biz maybee....\n\nRecord companies say ahh let's just make a quick $$$...£££\n\nI play the quitar and sing and i have to admit i quite often start making up a new song and realise it's very similar to a song i heard on the radio that day or on TV.\n\nHow do we make up original music when everythings related to what we have already heard ect...\n\nNow i sometimes have this thought say you give a indian or someone from a tribe a guitar who has no experiance of any other music than where he lives. Would he come up with something original ? lol\n\nMark25 said:\n\nI have a very short attention span and zero memory! But like Pink Floyd, Barclay James Harvest, Yes, Marillion, etc. If someone would like to suggest some of the \"better/original\" alternatives from the huge list above for my to try, given my taste, that's cool!\n\nThanks, Mark\n\nAs you can tell i realy like nektar\n\nif you want heavy theres the album sounds like this it's pretty good for live in the studio & if you get it on vynal it's probably worth quiet a bit.\n\nalso there other albums are prog with keyboards and quite good melodys in the music\n\nThers a lot out there actualy a amazing amount of matireal to lsten to or find in record shops.. Little gems forgotten greatness.. ha ha\n\ncogsncogs said:\n\nWell this a short list of some of my favs, I hope some of this fits into your listening critque. If not give me a little better description of you tastes! If you haven't already done so, go to Amazon.com and search any one these prog bands and you'll find some band lists and suggestions.\n\nCheers\n\nWayne\n\nThere all not bad at all a lot i still have to listen too\n\nhow about steve hillage ?\n\nMark25 said:\n\nthanks for all the feedback guys I won't expand anymore Wayne, as most of the other stuff i like is not really prog rock and i don't want to threadjack (any more than i have already!). I find most of the other music i listen to is because it sounds good on my system, (Fleetwood mac or Dire straits live)or to be more sociable, (Air, Moon safari).\n\nThe unique attribute that defines some of the music in the above list for me is that it sounds as fresh and exciting as the first time i heard it. Like PF DSOTM, i first heard it about 20 yrs ago, i remember the event well! But if could only listen to that album for the rest of my life, no problem. People who prefer \"modern\" music (or don't like my type of music) freely admit there is no album that has that effect on them.\n\nIt's nice to see people's opinions almost concuring, quite unusual for this forum! good thread Rixsta.\n\nMark\n\ncheers man\n\nyou are right some of the 70's prog sounds like it was done yesterday as in yesterday the only sound that to me is dated are any old effects used on the rrecording of an album and some keyboard or meletron sounds.. but that don't bother me.\n\nThe last album i heard classic rock\n\ndeep purple - machine head\n\nsounds so fresh...\n\nHardly any songs stand the test of time anymore..\n\nIf there are any women here how about renaissance ?\n\nim a man but the singer from renaissance i realy like her voice it reminds me of the film \"sound of music\"\n\ngood band"
