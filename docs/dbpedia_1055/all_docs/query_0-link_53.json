        "text": "Early life\n\nLazar Ristovski was born in Novi Pazar, as his father, a Yugoslav People's Army officer, was stationed there at the time. When Ristovski was two years old, the family moved to Kraljevo, which is where he grew up.\n\nEarly career (1970-74)\n\nRistovski formed his first band, Bezimeni (The Nameless), when he was fourteen. The band made only one recording, the song \"Maštarenje\", which was released on various artists album Veče uz radio (Evening by the Radio) in 1975. In the summer of 1974, Bezimeni performed in Bečići, where a well-known clarinetist Boki Milošević heard their performance. After Milošević's invitation, Ristovski moved to Belgrade and became a member of Milošević's orchestra.\n\nSmak (1975-76)\n\nDuring the autumn of 1974, Ristovski started performing with Kragujevac-based progressive rock band Smak, but became their official member as of January 1975. With Smak he recorded their debut self-titled album (1975), the EP Satelit (Satellite, 1976), Radomir Mihajlović's first solo album, R. M. Točak (1976), and several singles.\n\nBijelo Dugme, Laza i Ipe (1976-78)\n\nIn October 1976, Ristovski was persuaded by Goran Bregović to join Sarajevo-based hard rock band Bijelo Dugme as the band was getting ready to start recording their third studio album Eto! Baš hoću! (There! I Will!). Ristovski was a replacement for their regular keyboardist Vlado Pravdić, who had to serve the mandatory army stint. With Bijelo Dugme he recorded the album Eto! Baš hoću! (1976) and the live album Koncert kod Hajdučke česme (1977).\n\nAs Bregović left for his own army stint in November 1977, thus putting the band on hiatus, Ristovski and Ivandić decided to start working on a side project. Naming their act Laza & Ipe, they recorded the symphonic rock-oriented album entitled Stižemo (Here We Come) in London during February and March 1978. The album, featuring lyrics by Ranko Boban, was recorded in London with Leb i Sol leader Vlatko Stefanovski on guitar, Zlatko Hold on bass guitar, and Goran Kovačević and Ivandić's sister Gordana on vocals. The album was well received by the critics, and Ristovski and Ivandić decided to leave Bijelo Dugme.\n\nOn 10 September, the same day for which the beginning of the promotional tour was scheduled, Ivandić, Kovačević and Boban were arrested for owning hashish, which ended Laza & Ipe activity. At the beginning of 1978, Ristovski worked with the band Vatra, but eventually returned to Smak in late 1978.\n\nBack to Smak, the beginning of solo career (1978-81)\n\nIn 1980, Ristovski recorded the album Rok cirkus (Rock Circus) with Smak. During the same year, Ristovski released his debut solo release, a 7\" single with the songs \"Tražiš oproštaj\" (\"You Seek Forgiveness\") and \"Andželika\" (\"Angelica\"), both composed by Tugomir Vidanović. Members of Mama Co Co and Vatra were involved in the single recording.\n\nIn 1981, he recorded another album with Smak, Zašto ne volim sneg (Why I Don't Like the Snow), however, the band disbanded shortly after the album release. After Smak disbanded, Ristovski took part in the recording of Smak former vocalist Boris Aranđelović's solo album Iz profila (1982).\n\nSolo career (1982-85)\n\nRistovski's debut solo album Merge was released in 1982, and became the best-selling instrumental music album in Yugoslavia 1983. Until his return to Bijelo Dugme in 1985, he released three more solo albums: 2/3 (1983), Roses for a General (1984) and Vojnički dani (Army Days, 1984).
