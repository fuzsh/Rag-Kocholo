        "text": "I'd like to start the thread with Sarajevo's Indexi, i.e. with this live version of their 1974 song Da sam ja netko ( translate \"If I were someone\") that perfectly shows how \"monumental\" their sound really was. Also, Indexi's originality is unquestionable, as their take on the 70s sympho-rock was a beautiful proggy blend of pop and rock beats and ex-Yugoslav Zabavna muzika ( translate \"Fun music) which was like a quite inventive mix of Italian 'San Remo', German 'Schlager' and 'French Chanson' (surely I'll post some songs of Zabavna muzika later on in this thread just to \"prove\" that relation to the Yugo-prog).\n\nIndexi Da sam ja netko, live in Belgrade 1999\n\nTranslate:\n\nIf I were someone\n\nIf I were someone\n\nI'd call up all the boys\n\nI'd give them toys and\n\nLet them spend the whole day\n\nChasing around and playing\n\nThey would do wonderful things\n\nTheir days would be too short\n\nStudents would love their schools\n\nIf I were someone\n\nI'd erase wrinkles from all mothers\n\nI'd make the fathers love them\n\nTo return them love gone by\n\nAnd to peacefully live by the hours\n\nIf I were someone\n\nPeople wouldn't, wouldn't curse life\n\nAll the roses they would give to the wife\n\nOh, how living would be and how loving would be\n\nand how good it would be\n\nOh, how living would be and how loving would be\n\nand how good it would be\n\nIf I were someone\n\nI'd erase wrinkles from all mothers\n\nI'd make the fathers love them\n\nTo return them love gone by\n\nAnd to peacefully live by the hours\n\nIf I were someone\n\nPeople wouldn't, wouldn't curse life\n\nAll the roses they would give to the wife\n\nOh, how living would be and how loving would be\n\nand how good it would be\n\nOh, how living would be and how loving would be\n\nand how good it would be\n\nIf I were someone\n\nCroat Tihomir \"Pop\" Asanović was the first \"keyboards-wizard\" in ex-Yugoslavia. This song is from his Majko Zemljo (transl. \"Motherland\") the album from 1974. Ostavi trag (transl. \"Leave the Trace\") is a jazz-rock ballad-like song that features great Josipa Lisac as a lead female vocalist and her performance is quite magnificent. A proggy synth is also here, but the real Asanović's improvement comes with his unearthly e-piano solo. At the closing part, there's a beautiful soprano saxophone solo, which evokes some Coltrane-like atmosphere to me.\n\nTihomir Pop Asanović Ostavi trag\n\nTransl.\n\nLeave the Trace\n\n[Intro]\n\nAs I search for a way to your world\n\nLeave a trail in your path\n\nWhen you are not there, the sun loses its radiance\n\nWithout the stars of the night, it will have no end\n\nDo you know the end\n\nTo know...\n\n[Verse 1]\n\nThis morning is a day\n\nLike a star's dream\n\nOn your way I found your trail\n\nNow that you're here\n\nThe time will come for us\n\nSpend your life there every hour\n\nDo you know?\n\nHis life every hour I'm looking for a way every hour I seek the way night and day to your world\n\nAccording to your world, leave a mark\n\n[Outro]\n\nA clue, you know Leave a trail A clue, you know\n\nLeave a trail\n\nA clue, you know\n\nSmak's music was the Serbian version of something that on the West would being called 'technical rock' back then (e.g. the Yes' Relayer era), although the nature of Smak's proggy stuff was so hybrid that David Moss, a Chicago's percussionist who collaborated with the band, was tagged them as \"hybrid-rock\"; indeed, their catalogue is a crazy cocktail of musical styles that somehow work well together and always sound \"progressive\". This is a live version of their song Daire (transl. \"Tambourine\"), from their second album titled Crna dama (transl. \"Black Lady\") from 1977. Listen loud!\n\nSmak Daire, live in Belgrade 2015\n\nTambourine\n\nFrom a place far away\n\nTambourine is heard\n\nFloating down the moonriver\n\nGypsies are coming\n\nFrom a place far away\n\nA spark in the eye\n\nIs it a dream or is it real\n\nGive me a tambourine\n\nA song is rushing through me\n\nLanterns are shining\n\nPeople are on fire\n\nDewy tulips\n\nlying on the chest\n\nLanterns are shining\n\nA spark in the eye\n\nIs it a dream or is it real\n\nGive me a tambourine\n\nA song is rushing through me\n\nIf I die now\n\nBuy a tambourine\n\nPlay it to me gently\n\nBut don't let it harm me\n\nIf I die now\n\nA spark in the eye\n\nIs it a dream or is it real\n\nGive me a tambourine\n\nA song is rushing through me\n\nThe self-titled debut album of Zagreb's Drugi Način (transl. \"Other Ways\") offers a typical 70's Yugo-Prog with a good atmosphere. Drugi Način the album from 1975, is one of the greatest prog-rock records released in the former Yugoslavia. From that album, here's the song Stari Grad (transl. \"Old City\"). As a murky and other-worldly, \"symphonic\" and heavy, this epic has an intro that features the spoken words and bell sounds. This is a song about passion, an old cathedral, the bell sounds, the dance of light. The frontman Branko Pozgajec's singing is beautiful as well as and his flute playing.\n\nDrugi Način Stari Grad (from Drugi način, 1975)\n\nTranslate:\n\nOld City\n\nDo you remember the day\n\nWe met up at the Old City\n\nSurrounded by ruinous cathedral walls\n\nIlluminated by candle light\n\nConnected through music\n\nI am here again\n\nI listen to Bach once more\n\nWhere are you?\n\n(Chorus x2)\n\nShould I have told you then\n\nTo come up to the Old City again?\n\nThose pale images of the gray cathedral\n\nPlay of light, a vision bright and naked as a wave\n\nAs a wave, as a wave\n\nI forgot about Bach in the moment in which\n\nI saw in your eye a shade\n\nA trace of a tear, a tender glance\n\nA voice was born out of strange sounds\n\nAnd your soul got a shape\n\nLight as a dream, as a dream\n\nAs a dream, as a dream\n\nTender hands warm as a breath\n\nAnd a tango\n\nA fragile touch, a fragile touch\n\n(Chorus)\n\nWorld of flowers, hands of paper\n\nAn image of happiness and memories\n\nLight from the candles\n\nSound of the bells, the bell sound, the bell sound\n\nA white day and a harsh touch\n\nAnd again the brink of dream and reality\n\nBrink of reality, brink of reality\n\nBird cackling over my head\n\nClouds, heaven and a long journey\n\nLong journey, long journey\n\nTime was formed in 1971 in Zagreb, Croatia, former Yugoslavia, when the singer Dado Topić, who had previously been active in the Korni Grupa, formed a new band there himself. As early as the next year, the apparently quite popular group was able to record and release a LP. The album Time, released in 1972, was one of the first full-blown prog-rock records released in ex-Yugoslavia, together with the debut of the Korni Grupa (also known as Kornelyans). Topić and colleagues have delivered a really strong debut album. Powerful production and varied instrumentation is both rocky and proggy, provided with powerful, but very pleasant Dado's vocals. A superb organ soloing by the aforementioned Tihomir Pop Asanović is also offered on this album without a weak moment. Occasionally the flute plays itself in the foreground, otherwise Hammond and the electric guitar dominate the action.\n\nIn this long epic song, Za koji život treba da se rodim (transl. \"Which life should I have been born for\"), a Mellotron is heard for the first time on a record from Yugoslavia. It's a multipart epic, with philosophical lyrics about the meaning of life, through \"the point of view of the unborn child who asks for what life he should be born for\" (Dado Topić).\n\nTime Za koji život treba da se rodim (from Time, 1972)\n\nTranslate:\n\nWhich life should I have been born for\n\nWhich life should I have been born for\n\nWhich judgement day should I live for\n\nAnd which God should I pray to\n\nAnd which woman should I love\n\nWhose love should I be happy for\n\nWhose wounds should I be bleeding for\n\nOn which candleholder should I be the candle\n\nWhich woman should I be naked for\n\nI won't ever know these things\n\nWhere the roads of my life are taking me\n\nWhose wish it is, for us to be born, live and die\n\nWhose sky should I be the rainbow for\n\nWhose nights should I be light for\n\nWhich song should I be the sadness for\n\nIn whose glass should I be the liquor\n\nWhose autumn should I be a harvest for\n\nWhich painting should I be the brush for\n\nOn whose lips should I be the curse\n\nWhich branches should I be the leaf for\n\nTime performs the song Istina Mašina (\"Truth Machine\") from the debut album, live in Zagreb 1987.\n\nTime Istina mašina, live in Zagreb 1987\n\nTranslate\n\nTruth machine\n\nSome strange sounds\n\nthe music and colours\n\nare coming from the world\n\nthe unreal and yours\n\nYou're not Aphrodite\n\nyou were born here\n\nthe sparkle of icons\n\nyou took it all away\n\nYou're like a machine\n\nyou numb the glow of everything\n\nyou're foreign to the people\n\nyou're the end of the lies\n\nYou come and disappear\n\nif I'm dear to you\n\nwith your touches\n\nleave a track on me\n\nWith the holy ambrosia\n\nwe'll get our bodies drunk\n\nfight in fear\n\ndo what you wanted\n\nYou're like a machine\n\nyou numb the glow of everything\n\nyou're foreign to the people\n\nyou're the end of the lies\n\nOn your skin\n\nI'll leave a track\n\nthe truth of me\n\nyou'll get to know now\n\nOmega was formed as a school band in Budapest in 1962, and their first single was released in 1966. Until the early 1970s there were various line-up changes before a stable formation developed: János Kóbor (vocals), László Benkő (keys), György Molnár (guitar), Tamás Mihály (bass) and Ferenc Debreczeni (drums). This line-up was active until 2014, when Mihály retired. In the 70s, Omega played a sympho-rock that made them one of the most famous \"progressive\" bands in the Eastern Europe. Some of their albums have also been released sung in English by Bacillus Records (Bellaphon) (e.g. 200 Years After The Last War, 1974, or Time Robber, 1976). Here they play live their song Gammapolis from the same titled album from 1979.\n\nOmega Gammapolis live in Budapest, 1994\n\nGammapolis\n\nNow it's more than thirty-five long years\n\nThat on this earth I've had to be\n\nIt's time to leave\n\nFor another world\n\nGammapolis waits for me\n\nGoodbye, my friends, I'm going on my way\n\nI tried to teach you how to see\n\nBut I know, I'd never make you understand\n\nThat Gammapolis waits for me\n\nSo long my love, you shade my earthly life\n\nYou tried to make it good for me\n\nBut you thought I was crazy when I used to say\n\nThat Gammapolis waits for me\n\nWhen you gaze up at the midnight sky\n\nFar above, reality\n\nAnd you can see with heavenly eyes\n\nWhere Gammapolis waits for me\n\nThe original Modrý Efekt (transl.\"Blue Effect\") consisted of Radim Hladik (guitar), Vladimir Mišik (vocals), Miloš Svoboda (guitar and vocals), Jirži Kozel Mužik (bass guitar) and Vlado Čeh (drums) ). Already without Svoboda, the band recorded the album Meditacija in the summer of 1969. After Mišik's reluctant departure in 1970, keyboardist and singer Lešek Semelka lent the band his characteristic voice. The band toured in Poland, and when they returned to the Czech recording studio, they experimented in the jazz-rock genre with Martin Kratochvil's Jazz Q ensemble and the Czechoslovak Radio Jazz Orchestra, with which Modrý Efekt performed at the 1971 International Jazz Festival and in 1974 in Prague and offered live performances of the studio projects New Synthesis and New Synthesis II.\n\nIn 1972, Kozla was replaced by Semelka's former teammate Josef Kůstka, but after recording New Synthesis II, Semelka and Kůstka left and formed the band Bohemia. Adequate replacements were keyboardist and singer Oldřich Veselý and bass guitarist Fedor Frešo. When Semelka returned in 1977, the first Czech \"supergroup\" continued without a bass guitarist as a quartet with two vocals and a keyboardist (Veselý and Semelka), guitarist Hladik and the drummer Čech. With this line-up, Modrý Efekt recorded the successful album Svět hledačů (transl.\"The world of searchers\") at the end of 1978.\n\nHere is the live version of their beautiful cover of traditional Czech song Ej, padá, padá rosenka (transl. \"Hey, the dew falls, falls\"), from their album Svitanie (transl.\"Dawning\"), originally released in 1977.\n\nModrý Efekt Ej, padá, padá rosenka, live in the Prague television studio, 1978\n\nTransl.\n\nHey, the dew falls, falls\n\nHey, the dew falls, falls\n\nHey, the dew falls, falls\n\nYou should sleep, my little eyes\n\nMine should sleep, yours should sleep as well\n\nWe should sleep, my soul, both of us.\n\nHey, November falls, falls,\n\nPlease greet my beloved hundred times,\n\nGreet my beloved, the gray dove,\n\nAnd tell her that I will not return.\n\nHey the rain is falling,\n\nWhy are you sad Janicek?\n\nWhy are you sad,\n\nWhy are you crying,\n\nDear loved one?\n\nIn 1972, Belgrade's Korni Grupa (also known as Kornelyans), who had been active since 1968, released a self-titled debut LP. Unlike the band's numerous singles from that time that are mostly pop-rock, there is a proggy jazz-rocking on the album, determined by Josip Boček's first-class guitar playing and Kornelije Kovač's no less brisk keyboard interludes (e-piano, organ, piano). The band scurries ahead, fast and complexly interwoven, driven lively by the diversified rhythm department.\n\nMoj bol (transl. \"My pain\") the song is even more jazzy, also because Kovač mostly touches the keys of an acoustic piano. Even if the singer Zlatko Pejaković is more into crooning here, there are even a few free-chromatic moments where he is allowed to screech diagonally in between. This is arguably the best song on the debut.\n\nKorni Grupa Moj bol (from Korni grupa, 1972)\n\nTranslate:\n\nMy Pain\n\nIt's sunny that morning away from me\n\nThat morning is life meant nothing without you\n\nLove\n\nWithout you, love\n\nGreat eyes in powder\n\nWarm shoulder in powder\n\nThe flame of passion in powder\n\nUsually a morning passes by strange domes from which dark smoke billows.\n\nAnd I can smell someone's skin.\n\nI recognize you, my dear ....\n\nAnd we will all do it once\n\nGo on that journey, once\n\nWe are waiting our turn like some quiet children\n\nIn the last minute\n\nThis is an honorable mention. It has been 50 years since Belgrade's Yu Grupa released their debut 7-inch single Nona. Yu Grupa means Jelić brothers and a value of more than half a century of perseverance. Alike many heavy-rock bands from the West, the YU Grupa went through the entire length of the heavy-rock maze, as they had shown clear and clever proggy tendencies in their take on the heavy-rock genre in the early 70s - for instance, they were the first band that incorporated the influences of the Balkans folklore in their music - that later on being focused on success with catchy yet excellent, melodic, riff-based rock songs, as through their prism the honesty has been always refracted into the real quality whatever they were doing.\n\nYu Grupa Nona (7-inch single, 1971)\n\nTranslate:\n\nNona\n\nWandering thoughts\n\nOn my body\n\nYou seek comfort\n\nIn the palm of my hand\n\nI can feel your breath\n\nOn my face\n\nYour hands when\n\nThey are on my body\n\nDays, nights\n\nSarajevo's Bijelo Dugme is known mostly due its proggy heavy-rock hits, but also for its ballad-like songs that are majestically composed by the band's leader and guitarist Goran Bregović, greatly sung by Željko Bebek and with a grande Mellotron choir in action, but also with the whole arsenal of Laza Ristovski's keyboards, like in this song, Sanjao sam noćas da te nemam (transl. \"Tonight I dreamt that I don't have you\") from Eto! Baš hoću! (transl. \"I really want\") LP recorded at AIR Studios in London, and released on Jugoton records in 1976. In my opinion, Sanjao sam... is one of the most beautiful symphonic rock ballad-like songs from the golden era, not only from the Eastern Europe. This is a version from a de-luxe box-set containing all their albums; the remix was done by Abbey Road Studios in London and the sound is really great.\n\nBijelo Dugme Sanjao sam noćas da te nemam (from Eto! Baš hoću!, 1976)\n\nTonight I dreamt that I don't have you\n\nTonight I dreamt that I don't have you\n\nthat I'm lying awake on beds of snow\n\nand quietly, quietly\n\nsome other woman\n\ncalls out my name trough the night\n\nbad dream\n\nIn my dreams I saw a white lily\n\nblack horses and a celebration without any singing\n\nand quietly without a sound\n\nthey go away somewhere\n\nsome dear people\n\nWhere, oh where\n\nbad dream\n\nHey, night stop\n\nlet the dawn break\n\n(let the dawn break)\n\nIn September 1977, the keyboardist Lazar \"Laza\" Ristovski from Serbia, and the drummer Goran \"Ipe\" Ivandić from Bosnia, at the time of recording of their collaborative album Stižemo (transl. \"We Arrive\"), were officially the members of Bijelo Dugme who had played that summer in front of 100,000 people at the free open-air one-day festival held in one of Belgrade's parks, and then made a break in their activity. Laza and Ipe decided not to sit idly but to ensuing their own proggy ideas and hence they recorded their album in London's Matrix Studios (and mastered in Trident Studios in London's Soho, as it was the beautiful times when Yugoslav record companies paid for their artists all recording and staying costs in England).\n\nThe album was released in the early 1978. Among others, the guest musicians included Vlatko Stefanovski, the guitarist of Skoplje's jazz-rock band Leb i Sol, and Ipe's sister Gordana as a female vocalist, who sang in this excellent ballad-like sympho-rock song Ko sam ja (transl. \"Who Am I?\")\n\nLaza Ristovski (1956 - 2007) & Ipe Ipandić (1955 - 1994)\n\nLaza i Ipe Ko sam ja (from Stižemo, 1978)\n\nWho Am I\n\nWhen we have no sleep\n\nThe night hides everything\n\nOur memories and hopes\n\nWho knows\n\nWho Am I?\n\nWhen the night dies\n\nWhen glowworms disappear\n\nAnd calm everything down\n\nWhen time takes everything\n\nAnd when some people wakes up\n\nI'm asking\n\nWho knows\n\nWho am I?\n\nBijelo Dugme performs live - with the Čarolija (transl.\"Bewitchment\") children's choir - their song Pristao sam biću sve što hoće (transl.\"I've agreed to be everything she wants...\") in Belgrade, 1980. Actually, it was the last symphonic rock song composed by Bijelo Dugme, which in the eighties turned to the songs created in another style, a mixture of pop, folk-rock, hard-rock and, in keeping with the then new fashion, New Wave instead of sympho-rock, which wasn't uninteresting blend per se, but quite different from this.\n\nBijelo Dugme Pristao sam biću sve što hoće live in Belgrade 1980\n\nI've agreed to be everything she wants\n\nHere I am selling my soul to my devil\n\nAnd I will remain just a black dot\n\nAfter this game when they break me\n\nWhen they peacefully break me.\n\nI've agreed to be everything she wants...\n\nLa la la la la la la la la la\n\nI thought beasts were afraid\n\nOf this fire that follows my trail\n\nAnd I thought that.\n\nAnd now I wear whatever they make me\n\nNothing will be named after me\n\nNothing will be named after me\n\nI've stopped counting misconceptions\n\nI have no one to return home to\n\nAs long as I sing, so long I exist\n\nPast friends, future friends\n\nRemember me by my songs\n\nRemember me by my songs."
