        "text": "Croatian musician Jurica Pađen has been successfully building his career on the music scene for 40 years, and has written more than 170 compositions so far.\n\nHe grew up listening to The Beatles, so he doesn't hide that it was their music that motivated him to enroll in music school. He played the classical guitar, and already after finishing junior music school, he started playing and composing his first rock and roll songs. After graduating from the music school, he joined \"Group 220\", from which \"Parni valjak\" was later formed. After leaving \"Parni valjka\", in 1978 he founded the group \"Aerodrom\", with which he recorded five studio albums, and in 1987 he became a member of the group \"Azra\", where he was for three years.\n\nHe founded the group called \"Pađen band\" in 1994 with Tomislav Šojat. The \"Fallen Band\" has three albums behind it, one of which is intended for the foreign market, but at the beginning of this century, it reunited the group \"Aerodrom\" with which it still works today.\n\nPađen confirmed his status as a rock legend back in the 80s of the last century, and he managed to stand out as a studio musician, so during his 40-year career he had the opportunity to play with numerous musicians, including: Arsen Dedić, Gabi Novak, Alka Vuica , Goran Karan, the group Film...\n\nAs someone who loves film music, he also released two albums of instrumentals dedicated to those who love the sound of the guitar, and he even received the Porin award for the \"All stars\" project, on which many of his colleagues were guests.\n\n\"These 40 years have passed quickly. In fact, there was always something going on, so it was varied and dynamic. I collaborated with a lot of excellent musicians, so all that together means that it was interesting\", Pađen tells \"Magazin\" that when he started his career, the rock genre was at its peak.\n\n\"Rock went much better at that time. It was obviously a different climate, a different taste of the audience reigned, the digital era was just around the corner. People were buying records. Today, there is so much hyperproduction that culture does not keep up with civilization. Civilization is developing rapidly in terms of technological progress, while knowledge and culture lag behind to a considerable extent. It is also one of the problems of the modern world, that there is much less space for culture, than for that technological progress that is taking faster steps. And then, in the abundance of information that today's children receive, and schools also did not play the role they were supposed to educate children, because listening to music is also a kind of knowledge and education, everything lost its meaning. The one who listens is almost as important as the one who creates it. Because of this hyperproduction of various contents that have absolutely no quality in them, people are overwhelmed and miss what is worthy of attention in the crowd. Not enough time is devoted both in schools and at home to teach children to listen to quality music\", believes Pađen, adding that today children are forced to have more clicks, and anyone can have a large number of views, they just have to pay.\n\n\"When they turn on the search engine, the first thing that pops up for them is the most Googled and most visited on that list. And the people who make that music make sure that when it comes to reviews, it's at the very top. The band 'Aerodrom' recently received an offer to buy a million or more views with associated comments. After we got that offer, I watch how Paul McCartney or U2 and some other popular bands release a hit single, and on the YouTube service they have maybe a million, and barely. And some of our singers or girls, let's call them, get 20 million views today. And then, normally when someone sees that half the world has 20 million views, they automatically go there because they think it's good. To a large extent, fraud is present, as in everything. Obviously, this is a time of great fraud. It is inherent in the human race. There are few who won't take advantage if you give them the opportunity to cheat,\" asserts Pađen.\n\nEven at the beginning of his career, Pađen confirmed his status as a rock great, although in the 80s it was not easy to stand out from the multitude of bands and authors.\n\n\"Qualitatively, the competition was much stronger. Today, anyone can record a song, and why not, as a last resort, make a video and upload it to YouTube. It competes with the team itself. However, at that time you had to be a good musician, you had to have a good command of the instrument, first you had to prove yourself live in front of the audience how you play, and only then would the record company give you the opportunity to record something. In terms of quality, there was much better competition than today, so that also forced you to be as good as others in order to survive. It was both a stimulus and a motivation at the same time\", recalls Pađen and points out that the most important thing in music happened in the world from the time of the \"Beatles\" until some time in the 80s.\n\n\"All these after are variations. At that time, it was not possible to conclude that this is a business that will give huge money. People were playing, they didn't even know what music copyright was. They played because they loved it. They were not under the pressure of discographers and producers who today have taken over the entire business and work with the easily replaceable Sandi, Madni, Bandi, I don't know how they name them. Today, it changes like clockwork. You couldn't replace \"The Beatles\" with another band. They were strong and creatively talented, as were the Rolling Stones, Zeppelin, Hendrix. They were irreplaceable. Today, the scene is dominated by very easily replaceable stones in that mosaic, and because of that, the quality has dropped. The producers keep the money and the performers and change them, one month one, the next another, until it comes to the point that every day a singer appears and has a hit for that day. What Andy Warhol said 'Everyone will have 15 minutes of fame'. It's a really genius joke\", he explains how the music scene of Pađen works today.\n\nAs someone who during his career had the opportunity to play in other, big bands, he remembers that period for the friendship, but also the opportunity to collaborate with great musicians from that time.\n\n\"I don't know who I didn't hang out with and play with in that period, from Dugmet to Bulldožer via Valjko. I played with a lot of great artists and of course I profited from all that because I learned a lot by watching what and how they do. I got that experience which is irreplaceable because there are no such people anymore, you cannot create them, they are created by themselves. Today, you mostly have products that are created by someone else, and they were people who learned on their own, even from each other, so the quality of music and musicians from that time was incomparable to what it is today. That is why today it is a liquid one that reminds of an industry where only stamping is done, like making clothes or hamburgers. \"I figured out where it was going a long time ago, so I wrote the album 'Hamburger city',\" reveals Pađen, who as a studio musician collaborated with big names from the ex-Yu scene.\n\n\"As soon as they called me, they knew who they were calling and why. I always created what was going to be on those recordings myself. They gave me space because they had confidence in the final outcome. I always had a lot of freedom with whoever I worked with. Each collaboration was a pleasure because I was also a creative part, not just a reproduction of someone's idea,\" says Pađen.\n\nFriendships with musicians are still very important to him today, although many with whom he liked to spend time live outside Croatia.\n\n\"In Zagreb, I have a circle of people I hang out with and listen to, sometimes we meet at my place for dinner and we play. Neno Belan, Massimo Savić, Husein Hasanefendić Hus can come, I also had Peter Gabriel's guitarist - David Roots. A lot of them passed through my house because there is always a good vibe, a relaxed atmosphere, something to eat is always prepared, and after that we pick up our guitars and play until late at night. Of course that was before this corona situation and the earthquake. Now all that has died down, we only hear each other on the phones, sometimes\", says Pađen and reveals what is on the repertoire at those get-togethers.\n\n\"Then we sing songs that we all know and these gatherings last for hours. Of course, the Beatles, Stones, Hendrix, as well as old evergreens like 'Vollare', 'Wild World', 'Moon river', 'Summertime', 'Like my fire' and many others are unavoidable. So, evergreen and the best rock songs in history that were written and close to us,\" he concludes.\n\nCreation gives me the meaning of life\n\nWhen the group \"Aerodrom\" is mentioned, the audience is most often associated with the songs \"Fratelo\" and \"What did you put in the coffee\", even though Pađen wrote a large number of hits during his career.\n\n\"According to the number of visits on the Internet and the number of minutes played, 'Ordinary love song' is also at the top. They listen to 'Digni me visoko', then the ballad '24 sata', 'Put the right thing in the right place', 'Cancelled flight', while from this recent period there is a song that has been played a lot and was on the regional top list for 11 weeks. The sun laughs at me'. However, among all those songs, \"Greetings from the Bardo Plain\" is special for me, on which the late Laza Ristovski played keyboards. He was a guest on that entire album \"Trojica u mraku\" from '86. years. I think it's a rare song in approach and harmonically, with lyrics, it's extremely good and no one knows about it. There are a few other tracks like that that I think have undeservedly gone under the radar. The track \"Pogrešan dan\" is also on the same album. Although, there is interesting music on my instrumental album as well\", he boasted.\n\nHowever, Pađen is not one of those musicians who live off old fame, but his newer songs are also enjoyed.\n\n\"I could afford the luxury, given that my old songs are playing more and more, to not release anything. But it's not my goal to rest on my laurels. I feel alive when I create something new. I can't live without activity, and the activity that fulfills me best and where I am 100 percent is when I make a new song. I can't even compare working in the studio with that pleasure. That's why I make new songs, not money. There is no money today anyway, new songs are hard to accept by the public, but I am happy that my newer ones are also listened to. Creating new songs is what keeps me alive and what keeps people playing. I always say that the Stones and Paul McCartney don't play because they lack music, they have ten generations to come, but that's what gives them the meaning of life. People need to work in order to understand their meaning\", explains Padjen.\n\nInstrumental music can sometimes say more than a track with lyrics\n\nPadjen also released two albums of instrumental music, wanting to leave his mark in that way as well.\n\n\"This kind of music is not really highly valued in our country, but it didn't matter to me. For my second album of instrumental music 'All stars' I got Porin, and I also have fantastic guests including Branimir Štulić, Hus, Nikša Bratoš, Vedran Božić, Zele Lipovača, Neno Belan, Massimo. It's a team of my friends and people I've played with. I wanted to have them all in one place. On the YouTube channel, the composition \"Friendly Gate\" for an instrumental has a large number of views, although we are not talking about purchased clicks (laughs). Obviously there are people who follow it, but regardless I wanted to express myself only with the guitar. I love film music, I went to listen to Ennio Morricone when he was in Zagreb. After all, the whole classic is based on instrumentals. It only matters what someone has to say to you. Whether he will tell it through melody, words depends on his preferences. \"Instrumental music can sometimes say more than a track with lyrics,\" Padjen is sure."
