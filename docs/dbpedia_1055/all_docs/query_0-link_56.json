        "text": "Ranked By\n\n4.8K votes\n\n844 voters\n\nVoting Rules\n\nVote on your favorite Instrumental Rock bands and artists.\n\nFor instrumental rock bands, the key to success lies in the music. While this may seem obvious, unlike other rock bands, instrumental rock bands have few, if any lyrics to express themselves. Thus, the music they create speaks volumes more than any lyrics can. While the instrumental rock was at its peak during the 1950s and 1960s, there hasn't been a shortage of good instrumental bands that have emerged since then. To some, instrumental rock can also be called post-rock. Instrumental rock artists, at least presently, are widely regarded as virtuosos especially those who play guitars.\n\nSo, who are the instrumental rock bands and instrumental artists on this list? You'll see familiar names like Stevie Vai, Joe Satriani, Buckethead and Booker T and the MGs. All of these instrumental rock bands played an important role in shaping and pushing rock music beyond the traditional song structure. At the same time, some of these artists' music was so strong that it had to be played on mainstream pop and rock radio.\n\nThat said, take a look at this list and you'll see the best instrumental rock bands and top instrumental rock artists. This should serve as a great point of reference if you're a fan of instrumental rock bands. This list answers the questions \"who are the best instrumental rock bands of all time?\" and \"who is the greatest instrumental rock musician ever?\"\n\nMost divisive: Yngwie Malmsteen\n\nOver 800 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of The Best Instrumental Rock Bands/Artists\n\nThe Ventures, an American instrumental rock band formed in 1958, are best known for their iconic surf-rock sound and guitar-driven melodies. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, they have solidified their place as one of the most influential and successful instrumental bands in history. Their hits like \"Walk, Don't Run\" and \"Hawaii Five-O\" paved the way for countless musicians to follow in their footsteps, showcasing the enduring power of skillful instrumentation in defining a genre.\n\nRenowned for his virtuosic guitar playing and innovative techniques, Joe Satriani has made a lasting impact on the world of instrumental rock music. Beginning his solo career in the mid-'80s, Satriani's work quickly gained widespread acclaim with breakthrough albums like Surfing with the Alien and Flying in a Blue Dream. His dazzling fretwork and emotive playing style earned him multiple Grammy nominations, setting a high bar for instrumental guitarists around the globe.\n\nInitially forming as the backing band for singer Cliff Richard, The Shadows emerged as one of the most successful British instrumental rock bands of the 1960s. Their trademark \"Apache\" and \"Wonderful Land\" exhibited their signature clean guitar tones and melodic precision, capturing the hearts of millions around the globe. Often cited as an influence by later bands like The Beatles, The Shadows laid a foundation for the British Invasion era in rock music history.\n\nAs pioneers of Memphis soul music, Booker T. & the M.G.'s created an infectious blend of funk, blues, and soul throughout their storied career. Their tight interplay between organ, bass, guitar, and drums produced timeless classics such as Green Onions, illustrating the group's groove-oriented mastery of instrumental rock. As both potent sidemen at Stax Records and chart-topping bandleaders in their own right, they have left an indelible mark on popular music.\n\nKnown for his lightning-fast fingerpicking skills and signature KFC bucket hat-and-mask persona, Buckethead has carved out a unique niche within the realms of instrumental rock music. With an eclectic oeuvre spanning over 300 solo albums across various genres, Buckethead's unrelenting creativity never ceases to amaze. Collaborating with acts ranging from Guns N' Roses to Les Claypool, he has left a lasting impact on both mainstream and experimental music scenes.\n\nDubbed as the \"King of Surf Guitar,\" Dick Dale revolutionized the world of instrumental rock by melding Middle Eastern scales and reverb-drenched guitar tones into a new genre known as surf rock. With blistering tracks such as \"Misirlou\" and \"Let's Go Trippin',\" Dale inspired generations of musicians with his pioneering sound. His aggressive style and innovative use of equipment set a new standard for guitarists in both performance and technology."
