        "text": "Soundway Records reissues a limited 1000 copy run of Nenad Jelic and Laza Ristovski’s seminal new age album Opera from 1986.\n\nCombining percussion- laden rhythms with synthesisers, vocal samples, and at times unexpected acoustic instruments, the album became a cult classic amongst fans of fourth world and Avant Garde music. Nenad Jelic is one of the most original artists to appear on the Serbian music scene, a percussionist obsessed with melody and silence, a multidisciplinary instrumentalist. A member of the line- up of musicians which released the cult album Balkan Impressions, he was one of the originators of the World Music movement in Serbia. For fans of: Jon Hassell and Brian Eno (Fourth World), Michal Turtle, Harold Budd, Boards of Canada, Gigi Masin and Actress."
