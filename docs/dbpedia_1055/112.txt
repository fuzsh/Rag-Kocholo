Soundway Records reissues a limited 1000 copy run of Nenad Jelić and Laza Ristovski’s seminal new age album Opera from 1986. Highly recommended!!

Combining percussion-laden rhythms with synthesisers, vocal samples, and at times unexpected acoustic instruments, the album became a cult classic amongst fans of fourth world and avant garde music.
