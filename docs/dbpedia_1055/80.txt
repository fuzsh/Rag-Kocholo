Soundway records reissues a limited 1000 copy run of nenad jelic and laza ristovski's seminal new age album 'opera' from 1986

Nenad jelic is one of the most original artists to appear on the serbian music scene, a percussionist obsessed with melody and silence, a multidisciplinary instrumentalist. A member of the line- up of musicians which released the cult album balkan impressions, he was one of the originators of the world music movement in serbia.
