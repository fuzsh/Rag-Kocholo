Since most pieces are displayed near the windows  the sheer curtains let the bright sunlight through  creating a most unusual effect  especially on jewels.    Much to my dismay  photography was strictly forbidden  so I will use images from various sources to illustrate the jewels shown.      Some well-known pieces from the Al Thani Collection were shown  such as the  Rose  brooch of Princess Mathilde Bonaparte  by Mellerio dits Meller  c. 1864-65.     img src  https   i.postimg.cc Yp7xsq0P Broche Rose de la Princesse Mathilde Bonaparte Mellerio vers 1.jpg  border 0      The Al Thani Collection  2018.

It was a wedding gift from King Victor Emmanuel III to his daughter Princess Maria Francesca  1914-2001  on her 1939 wedding to Prince Louis of Bourbon Parma.

Possibly French  early 19th century. Wedding gift from Henri of Orl ans  Duke of Aumale.

The one thing I dislike about the Collection is its strange policies  no photos  even the auction notices of some of these objects are no longer illustrated   few scientifically-researched information available about the artworks  especially regarding provenance   and expansive catalogues  not to mention little communication to the press  save for a few photos with brief notes and extensive copyright mentions!
