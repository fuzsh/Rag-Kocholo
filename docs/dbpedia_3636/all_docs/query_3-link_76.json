        "text": "After the dissolution of the monarchy and the exile of the royal family, Italy passed a law which banned all male descendants of the House of Savoy from entering Italy. In what year was the law lifted?\n\nOnly the descendants of the former Kings of Italy (VE III & UII) were barred from the country. This effected solely three persons at the time: King Vittorio Emanuele III, King Umberto II and Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples (to be eventually joined by his son Emanuele Filberto).\n\nThe members of the Savoy-Aosta and Savoy-Genoa branches were still free to live in Italy; some examples are the current Duke of Aosta and the late 4th Duke of Genoa and his younger brother the Duke of Bergamo.\n\nThe ban was lifted in 2002.\n\nItaly's exiled royal family shunned as they return - Telegraph\n\nThe ban was estabilished by a provision of the republican Constitution; it affected \"the ex-kings of the House of Savoy, their spouses and their male descendants\". Therefore not only King Vittorio Emanuele III, King Umberto II, Prince Vittorio Emanuele and later his son Emanuele Filiberto were affected by it, but also Queen Elena (the wife of Vittorio Emanuele III) and Queen Maria José (the wife of King Umberto II).\n\nLater in 1988 the ban was temporarily lifted for Queen Maria José, who was allowed to make some short visits to Italy. The reason for it was that, since King Umberto II had died five years earlier, she wasn't any longer the \"spuse of an ex-king of the House of Savoy\" and therefore no longer bounded by the ban."
