        "text": "King Umberto II of Italy was the last King of Italy and the last monarch of the nearly thousand years old House of Savoy. He reigned only for 34 days from May 9, 1946 to June 12, 1946, for which he earned the moniker 'the May King'. However, he had been in power since 1944, when his reluctant father King Victor Emmanuel III was forced to transfer his constitutional powers to his son, who was considered as a better option than his father who was deeply influenced by Fascist leader Benito Mussolini. His father, who still retained the title of King, eventually abdicated the throne when a public opinion poll before the referendum on the abolition of the monarchy showed that the majority of the Italians wanted a republic. After losing his throne, Umberto was advised to use military force to prevent the formation of a republic, but he decided against inciting a civil war and lived the rest of his life in exile."
