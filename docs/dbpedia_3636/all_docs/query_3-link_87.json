        "text": "Maria Francisca is the only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Braganza. Her father, Dom Duarte Pio, is the heir to the now defunct Portuguese throne, following the founding of the Portuguese Republic in the revolution of 1910. In 1952, Duarte Pio’s father, Duarte Nuno, was the first Portuguese royal to move back to the country following the revolution and exile of the monarchy and today, the family enjoys a somewhat semi-official role in Portuguese society.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the Downton-worthy, star-studded wedding of Michelle Dockery and Jasper Waller-Bridge\n\nThe great and the good gathered at Orleans House, a Palladian villa in southwest London, to toast the nuptials of Dockery and Waller-Bridge\n\nThe groom is a respected lawyer who told CNN Portugal that he intends to take a backseat with royal duties, while supporting his wife (whom he calls ‘Chica’) and continue in his career. 'Chica becomes my biggest priority. This, in addition to accompanying Chica in everything I can and is asked to do, necessarily implies having a normal couple's life and dynamics and continuing to work for my family.' The couple have been together since 2019, announcing their engagement last year.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe guest list was an estimated 1200, with friends of the couple alongside innumerable European royals and aristocrats as well as the President of Portugal. Guests included Princess Miriam al-Ghazi of Jordan, Dowager Princess of Turnovo, the Duke of Württemberg, Prince Sebastien of Luxembourg, Prince Guillaume and Princess Sibilla of Luxembourg, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna of Russia, Crown Prince Leka II of Albania, the Count and Countess of Paris, Prince Ludwig and Princess Sophie of Bavaria, Prince Philipp and Princess Isabelle of Liechtenstein and Princess Anna Cecilia of Bourbon-Parma and Count Rodolphe de Causans.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the gilded, aristocratic wedding of Archduke Alexander of Austria and Countess Natacha Roumiantzoff-Pachkevitch\n\nThe royal wedding was a glittering affair at the Eglise Saint Pierre in Belgium this weekend, attended by princesses, princes, grand dukes and duchesses\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe illustrious attendees were spotted arriving at the Basilica de Mafra on Saturday afternoon. The vast and ornate church is set within the Palácio Nacional de Mafra, a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the historic palaces of the dormant Portuguese monarchy. Alongside the preserved royal apartments is a stunning Baroque basilica, which hosted the grand royal wedding in all its glory.\n\nThe bride arrived outside the Basilica in a coach adorned with gypsophila, accompanied by her father, who later walked her down the aisle during the Roman Catholic ceremony. She opted for a minimalist, long-sleeved ivory gown by Luzia do Nascimento, and added a splash of regal drama with Queen Amélie's diamond tiara; which belonged to the last Queen of Portugal. It was also worn by the bride's mother, on her wedding day.\n\nHer new husband, who can now style himself as the Duke Consort of Coimbra, looked dapper in a traditional morning suit with a cornflower blue tie. The pair, who are rumoured to be planning a move to London, looked blissfully happy as they stepped out into the sunshine to greet crowds of well wishers.\n\nThe post ceremony reception was held within the historic Palácio de Mafra, where guests gathered within the central court to toast the newlyweds with champagne as they cut their impressive multi-tiered wedding cake with a sabre.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIt was then a real family affair for the evening reception; which was hosted in the grounds of the bride’s parents' house in São Pedro de Sintra, Lisbon. Hundreds of guests attended the black tie gala of dinner and dancing and the bride changed from her more formal gown into a simple white halter-neck column dress, also by Luzia do Nascimiento, very similar to the Stella McCartney reception dress sported by the Duchess of Sussex for her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry.\n\nRead More\n\nInside the star-filled, Venetian wedding of Anya Taylor-Joy and Malcolm McRae at the 15th century Palazzo Pisani Moretta\n\nThe former Tatler cover girl was married in a palazzo off the Grand Canal in a custom-made Dior creation embroidered with hummingbirds, thistles and writing which no doubt centred on special meanings for the couple\n\nThe Infanta added a dash of colour to her look with a fetching emerald and diamond hair brooch and matching drop earrings. Both are family heirlooms and the groom had in fact taken a diamond from this collection to create the Infanta’s engagement ring.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from."
