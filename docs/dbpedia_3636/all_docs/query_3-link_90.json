        "text": "Anne of Brittany, Queen of France’s death on January 9th greatly worried the French, for, in all the years that she had been to Charles VIII and Louis XII she birthed no living sons, and only three daughters(all by her second husband) lived past infancy; Claude, Duchess of Brittany, Princess Marie of France and Princess Renée of France, so Louis XII decided that he would marry his eldest daughter, Claude, off to her second cousin, Francis, Duke of Valois who he chose as his successor. Also in France, after three miscarriages and one stillbirth over the past six years, the twenty-three-year-old, Duchess of Bourbon, Suzanne(married to Charles de Bourbon), finally gave birth to a living child on January 27th, a boy named Peter after her late father. As the year went on, it became apparent that Isabella of Castile’s health was in decline, for while she continued to travel around her kingdom, and write to her children as much as she could she began to delegate more and more responsibilities to her son, Juan III of Aragon, in his capacity as Prince of Asturias. Still, she would keep a stubborn grip on life for months, and in June she was pleased to hear that her daughter Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England gave birth to her fourth child, Prince Edward of England on June 6th. Even after this she contemplated her own mortality and was rumored to have visited her late husband’s tomb and tell the long-dead Ferdinand of their children’s accomplishments. On September 16th, Isabella saw all of her children(and she would meet her great-grandson Ludovico when he and his parents were in attendance) for what would be the last time, for they all came to the Alcázar of Segovia, to celebrate the wedding of her grandson, Ferdinand, Prince of Girona to Princess Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII, who was also in attendance. Ferdinand and Mary seemed to get along well, and if anything, the two certainly found one another attractive, and there was no doubt that the marriage was consummated. Still, death waited for no one, not even the most Catholic Queen of Castile, who died at the age of sixty-four(presumably of Uterine Cancer) on November 26th at the Alcázar of Córdoba, and she as able to say goodbye to Juan, Margaret and their children personally. One modern rendition of her response to Juan’s weeping is,”Do not worry for me my angel, for I die happy, for you and your sisters, and your children have all brought me such joy. I know you will rule Castile well my son, as you have Aragon, your father would be so proud of you son, and of your son Ferdinand as well, I believe that he will be a father soon enough.” The months after Queen Isabella I of Castile’s death were filled with grief and lamentation, but shortly after she as entombed on December 21st, Mary of England, Princess of Girona proved the Queen right, for she revealed that she was likely with child. Thus, Juan III became the first man to rule over both Castile and Aragon, time would tell if he could manage both kingdoms.\n\nIsabella of Castile, visiting Ferdinand II of Aragon's tomb\n\nMary of England, Princess of Girona\n\nFerdinand, Prince of Girona\n\nHouse of Trastámara\n\nJuan III of Castile and Aragon(also Prince of Asturias)(b.1478, r . from 1492 in Aragon, r. from 1514 in Castile) m.

This unfortunate event for the French would be followed less than three months later with a birth in Scotland, for on April 10h, Margaret Tudor, Queen of Scots finally gave birth to a baby that would live past infancy, in the form of James, Duke of Rothesay, which brought great relief to the Scots, for the succession was now a little more secure. In Italy, on April 14th, the Duchess of Ferrara, Bona Sforza gave birth to her second child with Alfonso I d’Este, who they named Eleanora, after his late mother, Eleanor of Naples. Also, on May 4th, Maria of Aragon, Duchess of Savoy went into labor for the last time, giving birth to a son who she and Duke Philibert named Emmanuel. Just a few weeks later Duke Philibert made yet another match with the House Von Wittelsbach, by betrothing his eldest daughter Margaret to Duke William IV of Bavaria. The Duke also arranged for his second eldest son Louis to marry Leonora Sforza, eldest daughter of Duke Ludovico Sforza of Milan. Also, Anne De la Tour d’Auvergne, Countess of Auvergne in her own right, married Gaston De Foix, Duke of Nemours, after she wasted two years trying to marry his late uncle, King Louis XII of France after she herself was jilted when her first betrothed Charles IV, Duke of Alençon broke their betrothal three years ago to wed Gaston’s older sister, Germaine, the Dowager Duchess of Longueville( who was left a childless widow when he died in 1508). In Milan meanwhile, Duke Ludovico Sforza, while going for a ride on May 25th, suddenly caught a cause of Influenza, and died two days later on May 27th. On June 11th, in England Catherine of Aragon went into labor again, giving birth to a daughter, named Elizabeth, after both her and Henry’s late mothers. Shortly after this Henry VIII of England arranged for an advantageous match for Arthur Prince of Wales, in the form of Anne of Cleves, the newborn daughter of John III, Duke of Cleves and Julich-Berg, whose eldest daughter Sybille was unavailable due to her betrothal to the heir to the electorate of Saxony, John Frederick. While Cleves did not exactly provide the most powerful of allies, The Duke of Cleves had astutely managed his lands(and was one of the few prominent rulers not married to Catherine or Henry’s sisters), and offered a sumptuous dowry in exchange for the betrothal. Meanwhile, at the Alcazar of Toledo(restored in 1512 by Isabella I of Castile) on July 17th, Mary of England, The Princess of Asturias gave birth to a daughter, whom she and Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias decided to name Margarita, after his mother, and Mary’s grandmother and this birth seemed to have alleviated some of the great sadness following Isabella of Castile’s death. Tragically, however, the thriving baby girl died just two months later, on September 20th. This death, for obvious reasons, devastated the girl’s parents, but Juan III of Spain( technically Castile and Aragon, but there was de facto unification) seemed to feel the loss even more, as it came less than a year after the death of his mother, and she was thus far his only granddaughter. Alarmingly, the already slim King (even by today’s standards) refused to eat anything save for a small bowl of broth and some bread, and some in court noted that he practically looked like a skeleton. Everyone in his family tried to get him to stop, pleading with him and using gentle persuasion, but that all failed. Finally, two weeks later, his second eldest daughter, the eleven-year-old Infanta Maria(known for her directness) entered his silent chambers and bluntly unleashed a tirade about how selfish he was to try and starve himself to death and add yet more grief to his family. Juan, though surprised at this, relented, and started eating normal meals again, and it seemed that this would have no permanent effects on his health. Also, in Poland, the death of Sigismund I’s Queen Consort, Barbara Zápolya, after giving birth to their youngest daughter Anna, on October 2nd, necessitated remarriage. Sigismund decided narrowed down two main candidates: Anna of Brandenburg, the eldest daughter Joachim I, Elector of Brandenburg, and niece to King Christian III of Denmark, and Eleanor of Austria, the conspicuously unwed granddaughter of Maximillian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Ultimately, he chose Eleanor, as she could wed him after his year of mourning (though he would opt for a little over a year instead) and was a more prestigious match. Thus, it was agreed that in July of 1517 he would marry Eleanor of Austria. In Italy, Lucrezia Borgia gave birth to her second child by her thrid husband on November 21st, a boy named Esteban, while Giovanna of Naples and Gioffre Borgia had a son of their own on December 1st, named Ferdinand.\n\nFrancis I of France\n\nClaude of France, Duchess of Britanny and Queen of France\n\nJohn III, Duke of Cleves and Julich-Berg\n\nAnne de la Tour d’Auvergne, Countess of Auvergne\n\nBarbara Zápolya, Queen of Poland\n\nAs the winter months turned to spring it became apparent that the fragile peace that had endured after The Second Italian War may soon end, for France’s new King, the young and confidant Francis II of France believed that bold action was required for French influence to truly be cemented in Italy. Thus, in February he wrote to the Serene Doge of Venice, Leonardo Loredan, requesting that he ready his troops for war in Italy. The Serene Doge was naturally hesitant, but complied, as he knew his republic only held Cremona due to French support, and he had been given incentive through the marriage of his youngest daughter, Carla, to Charles, Duke of Vendôme, which had occurred during the previous year. Still, winter, was a terrible time to start a war, and it would take months for the French to decide the best time to strike. Meanwhile, in Castile, on May 17th, Juan III’s second son, Infante Juan Carlos was wed to Princess Magdalena of Navarre just one day after his 15th birthday. Despite high hopes for the match it Juan Carlos and Magdalena clearly did not like each other very much (likely because of the seven-year age difference) and the two seemed rather cold towards one another. Still, Juan Carlos was made Duke of Cadiz, by his father, and he seemed to manage his lands decently enough. In Savoy meanwhile, Duke Philibert’s mistress, Teresa de Bivero had a second bastard child by him on June 1st, a boy named Nicolas. Meanwhile, in Portugal on June 4th, Catherine Tudor, Princess of England landed at Lisbon where she was greeted happily by her future mother-in-law Isabella of Aragon, Queen of Portugal, and she was scheduled to marry Miguel, Prince of Portugal on December 26th, shortly after her fifteenth birthday. Ultimately on June 9th King Francis I of France delivered his declaration of war to Duke Massimialno of Milan, and King Ferdinand III of Naples, announcing that he would invade the realms based on his ancestral claim. On July 24th, he, at the head of a 34,000 strong army(including Swiss mercenaries), after brushing aside the Savoyard garrison at the Maddalena Pass, swept into Milan, and started looting the Milanese countryside. Massimiliano, Duke of Milan soon met the French with an army of 22,000 men(which included troops from other Italian states, save the Papacy, which stayed mostly neutral, only providing monetary support to the Milanese) at Brescia on August 17th. The battle went rather predictably, and the outnumbered Milanese were crushed, with ten thousand men killed, and another four thousand captured, while the French only lost two thousand men. Fortunately, Duke Massimiliano was able to escape with what was left of his battered army to Milan, where he thought to make a last stand against the French. Still, he saw the writing on the wall, and knew that assistance(From the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdoms of Spain) likely could not arrive on time and didn’t want the townspeople to suffer through a pointless siege. Thus, with a heavy heart he decided that he and his family would flee with what was left of his army to the lands of his cousin, Alfonso I d’Este in Ferrara. Meanwhile, the French king, after capturing Milan in September, stayed there with he and his men, even after hearing the news of the birth of his eldest child, Princess Louise. Also, 14,000 French troops, under the command of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon(whose wife Duchess Suzanne had died in June giving birth to fraternal twins, Anne and Charlotte), put Chambéry, the capital of the Duchy of Savoy to siege in October. Meanwhile, King Henry VIII of England, had landed at Calais, and with 30,000 men under his command(including 4,000 Burgundians) trounced a much smaller French army at Guinegate(known as the Battle of The Spurs). However, England’s northern border was (seemingly) undefended, and King James IV of Scotland, despite being married to the king of England’s sister, Margaret, invaded with a force of 34,000 men on August 17th. Catherine of Aragon, Queen of England, was left regent in Henry’s absence, and knew that she would have to fight off this invasion, and using what she learned under her mother, and Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, gathered an army of her own, and with Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey, his own son Thomas Howard, and Edmund Howard led the 26,000 strong English army to meet the Scots on the battlefield at Flodden. Right before the battle, Catherine, in full body armor gave a speech exalting the courage of the Englishmen under her command, and that together, they would push the Scots out of England, once and for all. The English troops were naturally emboldened by this praise, and with their northern rout cut off the Scots charged upon the English vanguard. The English, after hours of fighting destroyed the numerically superior Scots, who with their pikes, and charging downhill into a marsh, had a distinct disadvantage, and ten thousand scots were killed, including their king, who, after receiving an arrow to the shoulder, was killed by an English Billmen, and numerous other notable Scots died, including Matthew Stewart, 2nd Earl of Lennox, who Catherine of Aragon killed personally when she knocked the sword out of his hand with her shield, and stabbed him in the throat with her sword. English casualties were comparatively light, with only about 1500 men killed. This battle more or less ended Scottish involvement in the War of The Holy League(with Spain, The Holy Roman Empire, Burgundy, Portugal, Milan, Naples and other Italian states opposing the French). The battle would also prove fortuitous for the Howard family, for the elder Thomas Howard would be restored to his family’s Duchy of Norfolk for his part in the victory. Catherine of Aragon for her part earned the respect and adoration of the English people for repelling the Scots. In the beginning of December, the siege of Chambéry had to be lifted as constant raids on the French siege camp, coupled with an outbreak of Typhus killed 3,000 French troops. Ultimately, the Duke of Bourbon’s army stayed near the border with Savoy, preventing any Savoyard forays into French territory. Meanwhile, near their respective borders with the French Spanish and Imperial troops prepared to intervene in the war, with the Prince of Asturias determined to put his training under Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba to good use, and help Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo, 2nd Duke of Alba, lead troops against the French,\n\n, while the Kingdom of Navarre remained strictly neutral, as Henry, Prince of Viana was betrothed to the French king’s elder sister Marguerite, while Princess Magdalena was married to Infante Juan Carlos, Duke of Cadiz. In Portugal, after a fleet of modest size was sent to meet with the Spanish fleet in the Bay of Biscay, Princess Catherine Tudor of England married Miguel Prince of Portugal. Amongst those in attendance was her older sister, Mary, Princess of Asturias, who was very close with Catherine, for they both resented their older sister Margaret’s overbearing and arrogant attitude towards them. The bride and groom, despite the awkwardness of youth, seemed to get along well, for they both had a quiet, devout nature.\n\nJames IV, King of Scots\n\nLeonardo Loredan, Serene Doge of Venice\n\nCarla Loredan, Duchess of Vendome\n\nCharles, Duke of Vendôme\n\nPrincess Magdalena of Navarre, Duchess of Cadiz\n\nInfante Juan Carlos, Duke of Cadiz\n\nCatherine of England, wife of Miguel, Prince of Portugal\n\nMiguel, Prince of Portugal\n\nThomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, and English Commander at the Battle of Flodden\n\nCatherine of Aragon, Queen of England, rallying the English troops at the Battle of Flodden\n\nAs the year began, the war naturally slowed down, for the deprivations of winter made warfare all but impossible. Still, on February 1st Margaret Tudor, the Queen Mother of Scotland, gave birth to King James IV’s posthumous son, Alexander, Duke of Ross, while she was regent of Scotland(and in this position she directed what was left of the Scots army to stay in Scotland in case of an English invasion). She even found an ally in John Stuart, Duke of Albany, for while she wanted Scotland to exit the war, and he wanted it to continue, they agreed that a defensive strategy was best(in fact, the two would marry in the next year, as part of an agreement to be coregents) Meanwhile, in March, after receiving the tragic news that his wife Mary of England suffered a miscarriage and that his father had taken ill with influenza(though he would live), Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias marched twenty thousand Spanish troops through Aragon, and soon crossed the border into France and seized Narbonne after crushing its small garrison. It was also during this occasion that he proved himself as a commander, for he personally took to the field and slew four French soldiers, and after taking the city gave orders to his soldiers not to loot it. The citizens of Narbonne were grateful, yet Ferdinand’s reasoning had little to do with mercy, he believed that pillaging the city would provoke uprisings, and waste time that would be needed to advance further into French territory. Meanwhile, in April, the army under the Duke of Bourbon launched an opportunistic attack on Franche Comte, which had little in the way of defense for the Imperials were more preoccupied in defending the Burgundian Netherlands, and in working with the English in Normandy. As a result, much of Franche Comte would be occupied throughout the war and the French would stubbornly hold onto it. In Italy, King Francis continued to try and solidify his hold on Milan, and the people there were indifferent towards him, for unlike Charles VIII he did not advocate for widespread pillaging. However, he would move with his army to take Genoa, and was successful, though he lost three thousand men in the process, thus he started to levy local Italians into his army, with some two thousand being forced to join the French. However, the Venetians had a very different experience in the war, for as soon as Ferranti troops put pressure on their garrison in Cremona, Maximillian I, Holy Roman Emperor marched a force of sixteen thousand men through Carinthia, and took border settlements such as Gradisca. Soon enough, twelve thousand Venetians met Imperial troops on the battlefield near Treviso, on May 21st and initially gave a good account of themselves. Unfortunately for the Venetians, the Imperial Landsknechts were able to hold their own against the Venetian Pikemen, and the Imperial Knights routed the Venetian cavalry. To make matters worse for the Venetians, in their haste to ward off the Imperial troops they choose to fight on very flat terrain, which meant that the occupied Venetian pikemen could be attacked(on the flanks and rear) with near impunity by the Imperial Knights, and ultimately, the Imperial army won. Total casualties in this battle were six thousand Venetians killed, while another four thousand were captured, and the Imperial army only suffered about eight hundred deaths. Also, on June 21st, as Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias led his men to put Montpellier to siege, they started to be harassed by a French force of eleven thousand men, so Ferdinand decided to take half of his men to drive them off. He and his ten thousand men were, after a couple of hours of fighting, able to fight off the French under Charles, Duke of Vendome, who after losing half of his men to Spanish Tercios launched a well-ordered withdrawal. The Prince of Asturias’s force lost about two thousand men but in the process managed to drive off the French who threatened to attack their siege camp. Tragically for the French, the elder of the King’s two daughters, the two-year-old Princess Louise, died of measles on September 21st. Also, on October 31st, in Wittenburg Martin Luther, released his ninety-five Theses, denouncing the corruption of the Catholic Church.\n\nAs the year began, Charles of Austria, son of Philip IV of Burgundy, and grandson of the Emperor Maximillian was wed to Anne of Bohemia and Hungary, on February 2nd. The match was a happy one and provided a key alliance on the Empire’s eastern flank. Also, in Spain, Ferdinand Prince of Asturias made it a point to visit his wife Mary in January, and just a few months later she announced to the Spanish court that she was with child for the third time. In Denmark, on February 21st, King Christian II of Denmark and Isabella of Austria, Queen of Denmark brought their first child into the world, a boy named John, after Christian’s late father and Isabella’s uncle, the King of Spain. On February 28th King Francis of France welcomed the birth of his eldest son, Francis by his wife Claude. The war continued, albeit sluggishly in the spring, for an unusually high amount of rain throughout Europe meant that roads often became a quagmire of mud, and that some were swept away altogether. Still, by June, The Prince of Asturias and his men managed to compel the people of Montpellier to surrender, thus an important French city fell to the Spanish. In exchange for their surrender, the Ferdinand spared the city from looting, again, as he viewed it impractical in a war that needed to proceed quickly. Still, in July his father visited him, Juan III of Spain gave his son orders to dig in around the area and prepare to ward off a French counteroffensive. While Ferdinand, was initially content to do so, and indeed brushed aside a few small French raiding parties, by August it soon became apparent that there would be no major push to retake Montpellier, he was disgruntled, and claimed that,”In the time we wasted being cautious, we could’ve taken Toulouse and put Nice to siege.” Ferdinand would return to his father’s court in September, as it became apparent that Mary was in the final stages of her pregnancy. Eventually, on October 12th, Mary of England went into labor, and much to the joy of the Spanish people, gave birth to a living son, named Juan, after his grandfather. In Ferrara, Bona Sforza gave birth to her fourth child by Alfonso I D'este, a girl named Isabella. In Venice meanwhile, the Holy Roman Emperor continued his offensive against Venice, and took nearly all of it’s land, save for the city itself and Cremona. Also, in December, as reports of his granddaughter, Eleanor’s pregnancy came in, on December 31st he received word that his wife, Bianca Maria Sforza, Holy Roman Empress died in Burgundian court, likely of cancer. The French meanwhile continued to consolidate their hold on Milan, for several minor attempts to attack Ferrara were rebuffed. Near Savoy the war was a stalemate, as neither side had enough men in the regime to launch more than small scale skirmishes. Thus, the war continued on, with its outcome still uncertain.\n\nCharles of Austria\n\nAnne of Bohemia and Hungary\n\nKing Sigismund I of Poland\n\nEleanor of Austria, Queen of Poland\n\nKing Christian II of Denmark\n\nIsabella of Austria, Queen of Denmark"
