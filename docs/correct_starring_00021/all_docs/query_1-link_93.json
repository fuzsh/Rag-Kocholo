I’m so sorry … but Corbin had his work cut out for him and I couldn’t just kick him out as soon as he finalised a gameplan for me reconnecting with Zac now, could I?\n\nLol, I totally could have but that would be really poor form! Even for me.\n\nWhile reaching out to Corbin for help means that he no longer owes me – I’m the one that convinced Ken Ortega to cast him in HSM – I truly believe it will be worth it. Corbs was patient, kind and smart as a whip, proving why we’ve been such close friends for more than a decade.\n\nThen he refused to tell me who wins Battle of the Network Stars because – and I quote – “I don’t think you should start gambling again since you lost your last two homes.”\n\nYuck.\n\nI mean, sure, he is right and it is very sweet … BUT GIVE ME THE INFORMATION I NEED TO EVEN UP WITH MY BOOKIE, DAMMIT.\n\nAnyway … despite that late breaking drama, it was so nice to see Corb again, talk about our concern for Misch and devour some glorious Chicken Corbin Bleu.\n\nCordon Bleu is one of those dishes that need no spruiking – salty smoked ham, gooey bubbling cheese and the crisp crumb work together to create perfection. I mean, bacon and cheese? You can’t go wrong.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nChicken Corbin Bleu\n\nServes: 2.\n\nIngredients\n\n2 chicken breasts\n\n4 slices swiss cheese\n\n8 slices smoked ham\n\n1 egg, whisked\n\n½ cup flour\n\n1 cup panko breadcrumbs\n\nsalt and pepper\n\nolive oil\n\nfries\n\nMethod\n\nPreheat oven to 180°C.\n\nSlice a pocket into each chicken breast where the tenderloin joins the breast. Stuff a couple of slices of cheese and ham into the pocket, close the fold and secure with some toothpicks.\n\nPlace the egg, flour and seasoned breadcrumbs in three bowls. Dip the breasts in the flour, followed by the egg and then the breadcrumbs. Transfer to a baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and bake in the oven for half an hour, or until golden and browned.\n\nServe with fries and devour, immediately."
