Bleu signed a contract with Hollywood Records, a Disney-owned label.[O] His debut album Another Side, was released in May 2007.[1][150] The album debuted at No. 36 on the Billboard 200 album charts, selling 18,000 in its first week. Bleu, who admires Prince, Michael Jackson, and Justin Timberlake, cowrote five songs on the album. One of those tracks was titled \"Shake It Off\", an ode to the musician Prince.[151] In 2007 he toured in support of Another Side with the teen sister duo Aly & AJ.[152]\n\nBleu worked with Ne-Yo on \"I Get Lonely\", and with other performers such as Matthew Gerrard and Eric Hudson. A music video for his first single, \"Push It to the Limit\" premiered on the Disney Channel, and was used to promote the movie Jump In! \"Push It to the Limit\" reached the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, and his second single, \"Deal With It\",[P] was originally written and sung by Jay Sean.

The album's first single, \"Moments That Matter\", was performed by Bleu at Kids' Inaugural: \"We Are the Future\".[158]\n\nIn 2017, Bleu signed a one-album recording contract with Ghostlight Records to distribute his Holiday Inn, The New Irving Berlin Musical soundtrack music,[9] was released digitally on June 2, 2017.[159] The album featured twenty-one songs, and was produced by Kurt Deutsch with Todd Whitelock serving as coproducer and Universal Stage Productions as executive producer.[160]\n\nBleu released his two-album recording contract with Ghostlight Records to distribute his Kiss Me, Kate soundtrack music,[161] the 24th cast album recording for Roundabout Theatre Company, since launching the musical theatre program with She Loves Me in 1993.[162]\n\nIn an interview with Paul Wontorek, Bleu said he is naturally a lyric baritone.[163] He added that he is a fan of Brian d'Arcy James and gets vocal influences from him.[163]\n\nBleu has been a supporter of Do Something.[164] On March 16, 2010, he was added to the \"Broadway Wall of Fame\".

The contradiction between Bleu's high notability on Wikipedia and low real-life notability comparative to the aforementioned historical figures made the creation of these pages unusual.[169][170] Years later, a Reddit user found that these translations were likely done by a single user whose IP addresses on Wikipedia locate to Saudi Arabia. By 2019, Bleu had dropped to #5 on the list of biographies, but increased in Wikipedia notability, by then being available in 213 languages.[171]\n\nBleu has supported various charitable organizations and causes during his career.[172]\n\nIn 2011, Bleu worked for charities such as Starlight Children's Foundation,[173][174] the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.[172] In May 2011, he attended the Do Something Awards kickoff event.[175]\n\nTitle Year Role Director(s) Notes Ref(s) Soldier 1998 Johnny Paul W.
