        "text": "Does it really matter what a critic thinks when it comes to \"High School Musical 2\" on the Disney Channel?\n\nThe original film that premiered last summer became a surprising and instant phenomenon, bringing millions of eyeballs to the cable channel, selling more than 7 million DVDs and a nearly equal number of soundtrack CDs. It has spawned a touring ice show and a stage version aimed at high school students, which already has been presented by the Manatee Players and at The Backlot in Sarasota. A professional national tour opened last week in Chicago.\n\nIt would be foolish to expect a sequel to be less successful.\n\nIt follows the successful formula of \"HSM,\" but thanks to a larger budget, is bigger and more splashy.\n\nIt's a combination of the old Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney, \"Let's-put-on-a-show\" movies and \"Grease\" dressed up and sung to a modern musical beat.\n\nAll of the original stars are back for more high school rivalry between the good guys and rich wannabe superstar Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale), who wants everyone to love (or worship) her, but doesn't know how to make it happen.\n\nWhat Sharpay really wants is Troy Bolton (Zac Efron), the high school basketball star who also proved he could be a stage star in the original film. But he's dating the brainy Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) since they fell in love while singing together in their school's annual musical.\n\nIn \"HSM 2,\" school is out for the summer and Sharpay arranges a job for Troy at the ritzy country club where she, her out-of-touch brother, Ryan (Lucas Grabeel), and their parents play in the sun. Sharpay figures she can keep Troy away from Gabriella for the summer, but Troy arranges for all his friends to get jobs, too.\n\nRivalries and backstabbing take new twists as Sharpay comes up with new schemes to build a relationship with Troy, threatening the club's summer musical in the process.\n\nLove triumphs in sweet and bouncy songs and big production numbers. In the first film, the athletes sang and danced on a basketball court. This time, they show off their moves on a baseball diamond and in the club's swimming pool.\n\nThe music is pleasant and the dancing has the kind of hyper-kinetic energy to fit high school kids. Kenny Ortega once again directs and shares choreography duties with Charles Klapow and Bonnie Story.\n\nThe cast displays some smooth moves and pleasant voices. Efron, who is currently in the film \"Hairspray,\" actually sings in \"HSM2.\" His voice was dubbed the first time around.\n\nDon't be surprised if the kids have all the music and lyrics memorized within an hour or two after the film's debut at 8 p.m. today. And they'll probably be glued to the Disney Channel for repeat airings this weekend."
