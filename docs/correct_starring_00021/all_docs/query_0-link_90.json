        "text": "One of Disney's most successful endeavors of the 2000s, the High School Musical franchise wasn't just one of the most-watched projects on the Disney Channel, it also launched nearly as many teen pop stars as The Mickey Mouse Club did in the '90s. The High School Musical films starred Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman. High School Musical 2 arrived in summer 2007, and the movie and its soundtrack spawned some of the year's most popular pop culture artifacts. A third High School Musical movie was scheduled for 2008. ~ Heather Phares"
