        "text": "Who could've predicted the star-making success of Disney Channel's coming-of-age teenage musical romantic comedy, High School Musical? Kenny Ortega's TV movie was once simply a Romeo & Juliet retelling where two separate high schoolers with two different personalities fell in love through their mutual appreciation and talents for theater. It had a quiet release amid the channel's other programming in early 2006. But soon enough, it became the most commercially successful Disney Channel Original Movie ever, generating a whopping 7.7 million viewers and a very devoted fanbase.\n\nIt wasn't long before a sequel was made, then one for theaters, and it elevated the careers of all its principal performers, particularly Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and Corbin Bleu. Now, the High School Musical legacy lives on with a spin-off show, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, which is streaming on Disney+.\n\nIf you're wondering what the High School Musical cast is up to now, we're here to help! Let's see what the high-profile stars have been doing since their time back in East High.\n\nZac Efron (Troy Bolton)\n\nAs Troy Bolton, East High School's popular varsity basketball team captain who decides to take part in the school musical, Zac Efron found his star-making role in High School Musical.

He also front-lined the streaming service's documentary series, Down to Earth with Zac Efron, and voiced Fred Jones in Scoob! earlier this year. Additionally, Efron filmed another reality TV series, Killing Zac Efron, for Quibi, though its status is unknown since the short-lived company has folded. Currently, the actor is in production on Gold. Efron is also set to star in King of the Jungle, as well as Disney+'s recently-announced Three Men and a Baby remake.\n\nVanessa Hudgens (Gabriella Montez)\n\nIn the role of Gabriella Montez, a transfer student who forms an attraction towards Troy Bolton after a fateful New Year's party sing-along, Vanessa Hudgens also rose to fame through her leading part in High School Musical.
