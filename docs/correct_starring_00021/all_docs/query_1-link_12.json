        "text": "A charismatic young performer with an instantly recognizable mane of frizzy hair, actor/singer/dancer Corbin Bleu was launched into global stardom in 2006, thanks largely to his role in The Disney Channel's pop culture juggernaut, \"High School Musical.\" Though the TV movie was his highest profile project to date, it certainly was not his first, and judging from the fan reaction to his every move, it definitely would not be his last.\n\nBorn Feb. 21, 1989 in Brooklyn, NY, Bleu was the child of performing parents - his father was Jamaican-American actor David Reivers (a recognizable face from numerous national television commercials and episodic series); his Italian-American mother attended the prestigious High School of the Performing Arts in New York City. Bleu began appearing in front of a camera at age two in numerous television commercials, including spots for Life cereal and Hasbro toys. By the time he reached four years-old, Bleu's professional experience had expanded to include a stint with the Ford Modeling Agency, through which he landed print advertising and fashion work in parenting magazines. He also broadened his experience by developing an interest in ballet and jazz dance.\n\nIn 1996, Bleu moved to Los Angeles with his family and booked a recurring role on the short-lived police drama, \"High Impact\" (ABC, 1996-97). Supporting roles in a variety of TV and movie projects soon followed, including the series \"ER\" (NBC, 1994-2009) and films \"Mystery Men\" (1999) and \"Galaxy Quest\" (1999). Meanwhile, he continued his education, both as a theater major at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, and as a dance student at the Debbie Allen Dance Academy.\n\nWhile still a high school freshman, Bleu landed the second lead in the teen action-comedy \"Catch That Kid\" (2004) with Kristen Stewart. That same year, he also began filming \"Flight 29 Down\" (NBC, 2005-2006), a well-liked adventure series from the Discovery Kids network, about a group of students stranded on a desert island (the show was frequently described as a teen alternative to \"Lost\"). \"Flight 29 Down\" filmed in Hawaii, which meant plenty of travel for Bleu and his family, but despite the punishing schedule, he managed to appear in several high school theater productions and win the Theater Student of the Year award.\n\nIn 2005, Bleu joined the cast of \"High School Musical,\" an original Disney Channel TV-movie helmed by director/choreographer Kenny Ortega (\"Dirty Dancing,\" 1987). Bleu played Chad, best friend to the film's lead, Troy (Zac Efron), and participated in several major song-and-dance numbers - most notably \"Get'cha Head in the Game,\" which required him to pull off some complicated synchronized basketball moves. Despite the lack of name leads, the movie became one of the highest rating productions for the channel, and its soundtrack broke records on the Billboard charts; \"Get'Cha Head in the Game\" was also nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics.\n\nFollowing the release of \"High School Musical,\" Bleu kept busy promoting the film in various countries, including England and Australia. His screen appearances were relatively light during this period; he appeared on two popular kids' programs, \"Hannah Montana\" (The Disney Channel, 2006-11) and \"Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide\" (Nickelodeon, 2004-07), before landing his first lead in the Disney TV-movie \"Jump In!\" about double-dutch jump rope competitions. He also performed a song for the production's soundtrack and enjoyed a rare opportunity to perform alongside his father, who played his character's dad.\n\nFor most of 2006, Bleu's energies were devoted to musical endeavors; he recorded his first solo album, Another Side, which was slated for release in 2007, and toured with most of his \"HSM\" co-stars in the \"High School Musical Concert Tour,\" for which he performed his numbers from the movie as well as his solo material. The entire group, including Bleu, re-united once again for the sequel, \"High School Musical 2: Sing It Or Nothing!\" (2007).\n\nIn 2013, Bleu co-starred in the online reboot of the long-running soap \"One Life To Life\" (ABC 1968-2012), following a return to Broadway in a successful revival of the hippie-era musical parable \"Godspell.\" Also in 2013, Bleu was cast as contestant on the popular reality competition series \"Dancing With The Stars\" (ABC 2005- ). He and partner Karina Smirnoff placed second behind \"Glee\" (Fox 2009-15) star Amber Riley."
