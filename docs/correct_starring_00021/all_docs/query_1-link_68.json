        "text": "Federle said: \"I've been a long-time fan of Corbin’s, obviously from the High School Musical series and beyond, and it usually starts by saying, 'How can we play with the theme of how meta our show is and get new eyeballs on the show, or do something for the really nostalgic millennials who grew up on the show?'.\n\n\"And Corbin was so gracious and I think as soon as I spoke to him directly and said, 'Would you like to play a slightly jaded, villainous version of yourself?'.\n\n\"And so he was in on the joke and was such a leader on set and so kind to the young people who are in the show now who were the age he was in the original movie. And I think all of the guest stars this season, everyone who's been teased in the trailer so far, they were just so fun, they came and played with us and it really was like summer camp.\"\n\nMore like this\n\nBleu isn't the only guest star this season - we also know that Modern Family's Jesse Tyler Ferguson will be making an appearance, playing an old family friend of Olivia Rodrigo's character Nini.\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series season 3 starts on Disney Plus on Wednesday 27th July, with seasons 1 and 2 available to stream now. Sign up now for £7.99 per month or £79.90 for a full year.\n\nCheck out more of our Drama coverage or visit our TV Guide to see what's on tonight."
