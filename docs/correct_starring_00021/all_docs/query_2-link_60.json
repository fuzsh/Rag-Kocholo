        "text": "Disney's High School Musical - 2\n\nBook by David Simpatico: Songs by Matthew Gerrard and Robbie Nevil and David N. Lawrence and Faye Greenberg and Randy Petersen and Kevin Quinn and Jamie Houston and Andy Dodd and Adam Watts\n\nBased on the Disney Channel Original Movie written by Peter Barsocchini\n\nSynopsis\n\nIt's the last day of junior year, and the East High gang can't wait to get the summer started.\n\nThings have been smooth sailing for Troy and Gabriella since their star turn in Juliet and Romeo, but Sharpay vows to win Troy's heart this summer - by any means necessary.\n\nWith all of the Wildcats desperate for cash, Troy gets a surprise phone call that work has arrived! At the Lava Springs Country Club, owned by the Evans family, Sharpay revels in her summer kingdom, surrounded by the club staff and her adoring \"Sharpettes\".The celebration is cut short when not only Troy, but the entire Wildcats gang, shows up for duty! Mr. Fulton, the assistant club manager, assigns them jobs, starting with cleaning up the kitchen. Sharpay arranges for Troy to caddy on the golf course for Mr. Evans, who teaches him a few lessons about success. Since Mr. Evans heads the local college scholarship committee, Troy agrees to sing with Sharpay in the club talent show.\n\nIn the dining room on her break, Kelsi plays a song she wrote for Troy and Gabriella. Among the Wildcats now, Troy gets swept up into the excitement of the song and despite his promise to Sharpay, agrees to sing it with them for the employee number in the talent show. Fulton informs Troy that he's been promoted to assistant golf pro, which comes with honorary membership status and an extreme makeover.\n\nIn the midst of his new job and practises with the college basketball team, he begins neglecting his friends. During rehearsal for Ryan and Sharpay's talent show number, we discover that Sharpay has secretly replaced Ryan with... Troy. Emotions explode, friendships disintegrate, numbers are pulled from the talent show, and Troy is left with only one ally - Sharpay.\n\nDuring the second week at Lava Springs, Troy rehearses Kelsi's revamped song with Sharpay and the Sharpettes.\n\nAt the staff baseball game, the Wildcats are missing their team leader, but Gabriella recruits a new ninth man - Ryan. The dubious Chad challenges \"dancer boy\" Ryan, who not only gets Chad to dance, but helps the Wildcats win the game. Now officially part of the team, Ryan teaches the gang a new number for the talent show. Sharpay, feeling her Star Dazzle Award under siege, directs Fulton to yank the employees from the talent show. This is the last straw for Gabriella, who confronts Sharpay, quits her job, and breaks up with Troy.\n\nA few days later, the confused and heartbroken Troy confides in Coach Bolton about his dilemma. Backstage at the Fourth of July Talent Show, Troy decides to set things straight. He gets his old job back from Fulton (who then quits), tells Sharpay that as an employee he can't sing with her, and apologises to the Wildcats. Finally seeing the error of her ways, Sharpay arranges for Gabriella to come back and sing with Troy and for Ryan to do his number with the Wildcats, earning him the Star Dazzle Award.\n\nNow reconciled, the entire company celebrates the summer.\n\nMusical Numbers\n\nPrologue / Countdown\n\nWhat Time Is It?\n\nWhat Time Is It?
