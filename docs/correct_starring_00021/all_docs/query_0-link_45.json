        "text": "OG Wildcat Corbin Bleu appeared on the July 25 broadcast of Good Morning America to discuss his return to the High School Musical franchise in the forthcoming season of Disney+’s High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.\n\nBleu originated the role of Chad Danforth in the Disney Channel movie musical and its two sequels. He’s also a familiar face on the Broadway stage, having appeared in In the Heights, Godspell, Holiday Inn, and Kiss Me, Kate.\n\nThe performer appeared with costar Joshua Bassett during the talk show appearance. Speaking about the cast and his cameo, Bleu said, “They’re so insanely talented, and I feel like they uphold the legacy so well, and I’m just so happy to be part of it and feel like they welcome me into the cast.”\n\n“I can’t get away from it,” Bleu commented about starring in musicals—specifically his latest role in Muny’s Mary Poppins. “It was my first time back on stage in three years, since the start of the pandemic, and I need it to fuel my soul. I really hope I can make it back to New York sometime soon.” Watch his full interview in the video above.\n\nThe upcoming season of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series will also feature Broadway favorite Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Nickelodeon star JoJo Siwa. Premiering on the streamer July 27, the new season will send the Wildcats of East High to Camp Shallow Lake, where they will put up a production of Disney's Frozen."
