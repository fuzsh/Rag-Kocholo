        "text": "The High School Musical: The Musical: The Series cast invites viewers to be their guest in the upcoming episode, premiering this Friday. Billboard is sharing an exclusive first look at the cast’s performance of the classic “Be Our Guest” from the 1991 Disney animated children’s film Beauty & The Beast, which is the spring musical the East High Wildcats are producing during the second season of the Disney+ series.\n\nCarlos (Frankie A. Rodriguez) leads the ensemble as the suave candelabrum Lumière who lures in Ashlyn (Julia Lester), playing the main character Belle in the musical, to the lively dinner. And Olivia Rodrigo’s character Nini helps serve up the show while dressed as a fork.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nThe season 2 finale of HSMTMTS will air next Friday, July 30, which is the same day the official soundtrack will be available via Walt Disney Records. The 29-track project will include more reimagined Beauty & the Beast songs, as well as “In a Heartbeat,” Disney’s first queer love song, and “Even When/ The Best Part,” Rodrigo and Joshua Bassett’s duet, with their individual songs — Bassett’s “Even When” and Rodrigo’s “The Best Part” — also listed separately.\n\nSpotify will curate two different “Storylines” and “Canvas” experiences for the soundtrack. The Storylines will be informative cards containing the stories about key songs, while “Canvas” will be videos pulling from key scenes from the TV series. Meanwhile, Spotify’s official High School Musical playlist will have short “Clips” of the cast breaking down their favorite songs and moments from the last season.\n\nWatch the HSMTMTS performance of “Be Our Guest,” and catch the track list for the season 2 soundtrack, below.\n\nHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series Soundtrack Season 2 track list:"
