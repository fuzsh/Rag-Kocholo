        "text": "By Ali Khatib\n\nPiedmont Players theatre\n\nSALISBURY — “High School Musical 2” is one of Piedmont Players theatre’s biggest productions, garnering a wonderful audience young and old alike.\n\nThis captivating sequel to a beloved show is sure to fill you with a multitude of emotions, ranging from the most humorous and light-hearted of moments to those full of anticipation.\n\nThe production details the life of the Wildcats beyond their chaotic school year, into an even more rambunctious summer. Watching the ways that the cast members took each character and made it individual to them is just one of the reasons to come see this amazingly exciting show.\n\nThe chemistry the cast has as a whole is truly captured with the relationship between Troy Bolton (Markus Byrd, a newcomer to PPT) and Gabriella Montez (Alonnah Murphy, a graduate of Northwest Cabarrus High School).\n\nThese incredibly talented young actors show just how much they care for this show and always help tie together a scene — whether it be when the two lovers are alone on stage or when the whole cast is partaking in an extremely well-choreographed dance number, artfully directed by PPT’s one and only Gwen Matthews.\n\nThis show isn’t just filled with the Wildcat family’s successes, but it also highlights the conflict between characters many know all too well from the movie, Sharpay Evans (Emma Shelton), and her one-of-a-kind brother, Ryan Evans (Henry Thomas).\n\nTroy helps get his friend jobs at Lava Springs Country Club, run by Oberon T. Fulton (Garret Jennings), who has fallen victim to Sharpay’s games.\n\nThis is where Evans’ and the rest of the Wildcats meet. Sharpay, as usual, resorts to trickery and deception to steal Troy away from his true love, Gabriella. And in a constant struggle with his future, Troy loses sight of what’s most important to him.\n\nSharpay and her devout Sharpettes (Meredith Swaim, Caroline Sobolowski and Berkley Loeblein) bombard Troy with the opportunity of a full scholarship, which Troy just can’t resist. He breaks his promise to Gabriella about singing an original song, written by Kelsi Nielsen (Lillian Huebner), with her in the talent show and plans to sing with Sharpay instead.\n\nNot only does he drift away from Gabriella, but he grows apart from his best friends, Chad Danforth (Michael Meres), Taylor Mckessie (Emma Theriot) and Zeke Baylor (Micah Cross). After contemplating what is worth more to him, Troy reconnects with Gabriella and his friends to perform at the talent show.\n\nAfter overcoming all of these obstacles, the characters put on an amazing talent show performance — which was one of, if not the, best scenes in the show.\n\nI also just have to give props to Martha Cox’s (Kaylee Hawley) insane break-dancing, hip-hop, baby-sitting, super-duper star dance moves. In the aftermath of the talent show, Sharpay realizes what she was doing and decides to really become a “new woman,” making amends with Gabriella, Troy and the rest of the Wildcats.\n\nThe ensemble not only engaged in all of the scenes, but they really sold the Wildcat family as unified and helped pull all the scenes together.\n\nThe show would not be what it was without Thomas Gushlaw, Ben Moleta, Cooper Fleeman, Alex Blumenthal, Kevin Liechman, Kailan Oglesby, Erin Amstien, Shelby Bryant and especially Kari Fuller, who all did an absolutely wonderful job as the ensemble.\n\nKarli put all the more enthusiasm into her performance and knew just how to make me smile.\n\nTo come and see this wonderful show, purchase your tickets by calling 704-633-5471. Shows are at 7:30 p.m. Thursday through Saturday.\n\nAli Khatib is a rising freshman at North Rowan High School."
