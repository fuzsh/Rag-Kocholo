        "text": "Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, Corbin Bleu and Monique Coleman—the stars of High School Musical—reunite to celebrate the global sensation’s 10-year anniversary during a special telecast of the movie Wednesday, January 20 (8:00 p.m., ET/PT) on Disney Channel. The group taped the nostalgic interstitial segments today at a high school gymnasium in suburban Los Angeles. Their fellow star Zac Efron will join the telecast in a pre-taped message to High School Musical fans.\n\nRadio Disney’s Ernie D also interviewed the cast, to be seen during a “Radio Disney Insider” presented Thursday, January 21 on Disney Channel and the Radio Disney app.\n\nSubsequent telecasts of the movie and its sequel, High School Musical 2, will be presented Thursday, January 21 and Sunday, January 24 on Disney Channel. Freeform will present High School Musical on Saturday, January 23 (4:30 p.m. EST) and Sunday, January 24 (2:00 p.m. EST).\n\nGary Marsh, President and Chief Creative Officer, Disney Channels Worldwide, said, “Seeing the cast of High School Musical back together again reaffirms what made it special 10 years ago. It’s their optimism, their dedication and their extraordinary talent—as a group—that made this such an exceptional movie and cultural phenomenon. Ten years later, the movie continues to delight audiences around the globe, not just for its memorable song and dance numbers, but for its universal themes that continue to resonate with fans everywhere – express yourself, believe in yourself and always follow your dreams.”\n\n(DOWNLOAD HERE)\n\nRemembered fondly by a generation of kids and families, and renowned for inspiring viewers to learn, engage, explore and participate in music, dance and theater, the now iconic Disney Channel Original Movie premiered January 20, 2006, delivering 7.7 million Total Viewers in the U.S.—at the time, the highest ratings for any telecast ever on Disney Channel. Around the world that year alone, it reached over 100 million unduplicated viewers. It also broke new ground as the first-ever TV movie soundtrack to reach #1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart and went on to become the #1 album of 2006 as well as the #1 soundtrack and #1 Kids’ album of that year.\n\nHigh School Musical, a contemporary “break into song” production, tells the story of two high school students, Troy, a popular basketball player, and Gabriella, a shy, brainy newcomer, who share a secret passion for singing. When these two seemingly polar opposites decide to join forces and go out for the lead roles in the school musical, it wreaks havoc on East High’s rigid social order. In a desperate effort to maintain the status quo, the school’s various cliques conspire to separate the pair and keep them from performing. But by defying expectations and pursuing their dreams, Troy and Gabriella inspire other students to go public with some surprising hidden talents of their own.\n\n(DOWNLOAD HERE)\n\nHigh School Musical received two Emmy Awards, the Television Critics Association Award, an Imagen Award (recognizing the positive portrayal of Latinos in entertainment media), a Billboard Music Award for Soundtrack of the Year, an American Music Award and a Producer’s Guild of America Award. Kenny Ortega received a career achievement honor from the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, an Imagen Award, a Diversity Award from the Multicultural Motion Picture Association, an ALMA Award and two Director’s Guild of America (DGA) Awards for the movie.\n\nDisney Theatrical Productions licensed the script for local student theatre productions through Music Theatre International (MTI). In its first 15 months (2006-07), an estimated 2000 middle and high schools produced a licensed amateur stage production of High School Musical and a related gran program from Disney and NAMM (National Association of Music Merchants) Foundation encouraged more kids to get involved in music and the arts. A documentary/musical from Academy Award-winning documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple followed the process of Fort Worth, Texas, students producing a stage adaptation of High School Musical.\n\nThe movie also inspired professional touring stage productions, High School Musical: The Ice Tour produced by Feld Entertainment, Kenny Ortega and Disney Theatrical Productions, a best-selling junior novel, consumer products, a themed show at Disneyland Parks and Resorts in Anaheim, Orlando and Paris, and a sold-out, 52-date arena concert tour in North America and Latin America.\n\nHigh School Musical stars Zac Efron as Troy Bolton, Vanessa Hudgens as Gabriella Montez, Ashley Tisdale as Sharpay Evans, Corbin Bleu as Chad, Lucas Grabeel as Ryan Evans and Monique Coleman as Taylor McKessie, Alyson Reed as Ms. Darbus, Olesya Rulin as Kelsi, Chris Warren, Jr. as Zeke and Bart Johnson as Coach Bolton.\n\nHigh School Musical was written by Peter Barsocchini and directed and choreographed by Kenny Ortega. Bill Borden and Barry Rosenbush served as the executive producers. High School Musical is a production of First Street Films."
