        "text": "Corbin Bleu began acting and modeling as a toddler, appearing in commercials and print ads. Before the age of ten, he moved with his family to Los Angeles and began to make appearances on television. A steady stream of roles continued into the early 2000s, and they gradually became increasingly prominent. He took a lead role in 2004's Catch That Kid, was part of 2006's High School Musical, and took yet another lead role on 2007's Jump In, which continued his affiliation with Disney. \"Push It to the Limit,\" his recorded debut as a singer, was included on its soundtrack. Another Side, his debut album, was released later in 2007. ~ Andy Kellman"
