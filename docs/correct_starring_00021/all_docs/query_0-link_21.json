And I'm honestly just grateful. I'm grateful to have been a part of such a beautiful thing.\"\n\nRelated: Look Back at All the 'High School Musical' Cast Reunions Over the Years\n\n\"When I look back on it now,\" he continues, \"it is my childhood, and it is something that I would never trade for the world.\"\n\nThough people sometimes ask if the attention he gets for HSM gets old, he replies, \"There was a time where I was trying to distance myself from it to try to do other things. But at this point now when I look on it, I feel like it's just a completely different person that I can look at, and go, 'We did that.' \"\n\nRevealing that there is in fact a cast group text, Bleu says he \"still gets to see everybody here and there,\" adding that former costars Monique Coleman and Lucas Grabeel both came to see him in his role of Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors on Broadway recently,\n\nRelated: 'High School Musical' Cast: Where Are They Now?\n\nAs for stepping into the part of ill-fated Seymour in the classic musical (written by longtime Disney collaborators Alan Menken and Howard Ashman), Bleu says it's \"a production that I've always wanted to do — but never knew that I would actually have the opportunity to do.\"\n\nIt's a show he's loved since he was a kid, he adds, in a medium he has a passion for, as well.\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"Theater is my joy and my love,\" he shares. \"The theater community — I love the people.
