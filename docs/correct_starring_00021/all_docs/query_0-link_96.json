        "text": "Actor Corbin Bleu has fondly reflected on his High School Musical days and dished on who from the cast is still chatting today nearly two decades since the start of the beloved Disney franchise.\n\nCorbin - who previously starred as the iconic basketball player and Troy Bolton's best friend Chad Danforth - has opened up about his rise to stardom and the special place the Disney Channel musicals hold in his heart today. Backstage at his Broadway show Little Shop of Horrors, the 35-year-old actor says he is still \"grateful\" to all his new and old fans for keeping the franchise alive and is happy to still be in touch with many of his former castmates.\n\nIn an interview with People, Corbin sweetly said: \"There are new generations that continue to experience it, and be introduced to it,\" and added: \"And I feel like at this point, it's just a part of the musical theater canon. And I'm honestly just grateful. I'm grateful to have been a part of such a beautiful thing.\"\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Tony McFarr, Chris Pratt's stunt double, dead at 47 as mother says death is 'shocking'\n\nREAD MORE: What is the Avril Lavigne conspiracy? Melissa body double conspiracy theory explained\n\nThe talented crew including Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and more have all paved their own paths to success since the movies with many continuing to pursue successful careers in the entertainment industry. And while they all tackle their own projects, many of the former crew are still rooting one another on 18 years later.\n\nTo the delight of long-time fans, Corbin confirmed that there is in fact still a cast group text that \"still gets to see everybody here and there.\" He added that who of his former co-stars Monique Coleman, who starred as Taylor McKessie in HSM, and Lucas Grabeel, who played Ryan Evans, both recently came out to watch him as he starred in the famous Broadway play the Little Shop of Horrors.\n\nAnd while Corbin admitted he at one point tried to distance himself from his role in the teen musical, he now embraces the period in his life that brought him to where he is today. He said: \"It is my childhood, and it is something that I would never trade for the world,\" and added: \"There was a time where I was trying to distance myself from it to try to do other things. But at this point now when I look on it, I feel like it's just a completely different person that I can look at, and go, 'We did that.'\"\n\nAnd when he was asked if there would ever be a High School Musical reunion in the horizon, Corbin teased \"never say never.\" And added that if they ever did do a reboot, he has a token souvenir he is ready to bring back with him. He admitted: \"I have that basketball that I used for all three movies.\""
