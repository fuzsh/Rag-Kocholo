Chad Danforth, made one of the biggest life-changing decisions recently, and it will give you all the feels. The actor upgraded from the cast's senior year prom and got married last weekend on Saturday (July 23) to his long-time girlfriend, actress Sasha Clements.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe HSM star shared the first Instagram photo of their wedding today and it's picture perfect.
