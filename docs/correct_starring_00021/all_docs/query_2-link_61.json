Based on Disney Channel’s blockbuster TV movie, Disney’s High School Musical 2 JR. can be performed as a follow-up to Disney’s High School Musical JR. or as an introduction to everyone’s favorite Wildcats.\n\nAt the Lava Springs Country Club, popular girl, Sharpay, reigns supreme while the Wildcats get to work — literally! Featuring every ounce of the light-hearted fun that made High School Musical a household name, this buoyant sequel follows our East High favorites as they face the realities of the adult world and begin to grow up. Friendships are tested, summer romances go haywire and the meaning of success is redefined."
