        "text": "Corbin Bleu is taking us back in time. The High School Musical star recently took a trip with his wife of three years to revisit an iconic location from High School Musical 2: Entrada at Snow Canyon in Utah, where the 2007 sequel took place!\n\nIn the sequel, the HSM gang spends their summer break working at a fictional country club called Lava Springs, which is owned by Sharpay’s wealthy family. While there are plenty of ups, downs, and relationship dramas, everything works out for the Wildcat crew in the end, and they celebrate the lessons they’ve learned before heading back to school. Remember that epic pool party finale with an appearance from Miley Cyrus?\n\nCorbin posted a few cute pics from his stay to Instagram, writing, “So fun going down memory lane and staying at @entradasnowcanyon in Utah! As many of you can guess this is where we filmed HSM2 and I hadn’t been back since! It was awesome being able to show my wife a piece of my past and to be reminded of some hilarious memories.”\n\nThough the film was released over a decade ago, it’s apparently still near and dear to fans’ hearts — and they’ve been seen trying to recreate some of the performances! “The staff also let me know that to this day they have to ask kids to not jump from the waterfall like we did,” Corbin wrote. His HSM2 costar Monique Coleman commented on the post with nostalgic feels of her own, writing “OMG! Soooooo many memories.” We totally agree."
