        "text": "“High School Musical” was an unlikely hit.\n\nThe original movie’s unassuming nature, earnest cast, and simple premise made it a pleasant, campy surprise. The film played off the sweet chemistry between the two leads and teased audiences with “almost”-kisses, leaving them wanting more. Where “HSM 1” was full of charm and naiveté, “High School Musical 2” is sadly lacking.\n\nNot that it matters, since, regardless of what snooty critics or appreciators of “real” theater say, “HSM 2” is undoubtedly going to be a sure-fire hit.\n\nIt’s summer vacation and Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) is still bitter over losing not only the lead role in the winter musical, but any chances with Troy (Zac Efron). So, she pulls some strings to get Troy hired at her daddy’s glitzy country club, Lava Springs in hopes of luring him away from Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens).\n\nTroy, in turn, gets the rest of his school friends hired there as well. Not fazed, Sharpay uses her daddy’s connections to take advantage of Troy’s worries about college. Before he knows it, Troy’s spending more time with Sharpay and her family than his own friends. He’s even singing with her in the annual talent show. In the end, Troy must predictably decide what’s important and where his true loyalties lie.\n\nThe problem with “HSM 2” is its lack of freshness and originality. Almost every song seems like Disney just took the first movie’s soundtrack, changed a few notes and stanzas and inserted it into the sequel. It makes the music in the movie seem forced, the exception being “HSM 2″‘s answer to the first movie’s basketball bonanza “Get’cha Head In The Game”, the baseball themed “I Don’t Dance”, an infectious duet between Chad (Corbin Bleu) and scene-stealer Ryan (Lucas Grabeel).\n\nThe plot of the second movie is essentially the same as the original despite the different settings.\n\nIn the beginning, Gabriella and Troy are happy together and sing a duet – “What I’ve Been Looking For” in the first movie and “You Are the Music in Me” in the second.\n\nAfter their initial period of happiness, Troy does something that drives them apart causing Gabriella to sing a song about leaving him – HSM 1’s “When There Was Me and You” and “HSM 2″‘s “Gotta Go My Own Way.”\n\nTroy then has an epiphany and rushes back into the arms of the forgiving Gabriella where they sing a trite albeit catchy duet – “Breaking Free” in the first film and “Everyday” in the second. Going along with the theme of teamwork and friendship, both films end with big, elaborately choreographed numbers – “We’re All in This Together” in HSM 1 and “All for One” in “HSM 2.”\n\nBecause of this, “HSM 2” comes off as a formulaic cash cow. It’s like giving a child all the candy it wants until it becomes sick. There’s finally that kiss between Troy and Gabriella and a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo with tween superstar Miley Cyrus. While it’ll satisfy its target demographic to no end, there’s something lacking, where, instead of a soul, there’s nothing more than the contrived emotionless plastic of a well-oiled money-making machine."
