“I can’t get away from it,” Bleu commented about starring in musicals—specifically his latest role in Muny’s Mary Poppins. “It was my first time back on stage in three years, since the start of the pandemic, and I need it to fuel my soul. I really hope I can make it back to New York sometime soon.” Watch his full interview in the video above.
