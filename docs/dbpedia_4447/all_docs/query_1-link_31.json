        "text": "Bulldog Scottish Aviation Bulldog, arriving at Shoreham Airshow 2012 Role Basic trainer with aerobatic capability\n\nType of aircraft\n\nManufacturer Beagle Aircraft/Scottish Aviation First flight 19 May 1969 Introduction 1971 Status Active Primary user Royal Air Force Produced 1969–1982 Number built 328 Developed from Beagle Pup\n\nThe Scottish Aviation Bulldog is a British two-seat side-by-side (with optional third seat) training aircraft designed by Beagle Aircraft as the B.125 Bulldog.\n\nThe prototype Bulldog flew on 19 May 1969 at Shoreham Airport. The first order for the type was for 78 from the Swedish Air Board. Before any production aircraft were built, Beagle Aircraft ceased trading and the production rights for the aircraft, with the Swedish order, were taken over by Scottish Aviation (Bulldog) Limited. All subsequent aircraft were built at Prestwick Airport by Scottish Aviation, and later by British Aerospace.\n\nThe first 58 aircraft (known as the SK 61A and SK 61B) were delivered to the Swedish Air Force in 1971. Twenty more aircraft were delivered to the Swedish Army as FPL 61C in 1972, although these were transferred to the Air Force in 1989 as SK 61C. By 2001 all the Swedish aircraft had been withdrawn from military service. 26 were bought in 2004 by the Hungarian company AVIA-Rent.\n\nThe largest customer was the Royal Air Force, which placed an order for 130 Bulldogs in 1972, entering service as the Bulldog T.1 in 1975. It was used by the Royal Air Force as a basic trainer, in particular as the standard aircraft of the University Air Squadrons and, later, Air Experience Flights, providing flying training. The aircraft was also used by the Royal Navy for Elementary Flying Training (EFT) at RAF Topcliffe.\n\nThe RAF sold off its remaining Bulldog trainers in 2001 as general aviation light aircraft for a low price. They were replaced by the Grob Tutor.\n\nThe following Bulldog models were produced:[1] [2]\n\nBulldog Series 1\n\nOne prototype built by Beagle Aircraft (G-AXEH), one built by Scottish Aviation; now in the collection of the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune, East Lothian.\n\nBulldog Series 100\n\nModel 101: Export model for Sweden.

Five built.\n\nModel 104: Refurbished second prototype (G-AXIG)\n\nModel 121: Primary trainer for the Royal Air Force. RAF designation Bulldog T.1. 130 built, five of which transferred (sold) to the Armed Forces of Malta in 2000.\n\nModel 122: Export model for Ghana. Six built.\n\nModel 122A: Export model for Ghana. Seven built.\n\nModel 123: Export model for Nigeria. 37 built.\n\nModel 124: Company demonstrator (G-ASAL).

The Bulldog was designed so that it could be fitted with four hard points. These armaments were tested on company demonstrator aircraft G-ASAL. They were never used in RAF service although some weapons training was done on the Bulldog trainers in Sweden. Although hardpoints are available, there is no provision for production weapons launch control systems in the Bulldog.[11]\n\nUp to a 290 kg (640 lb) bomb load.\n\nMatra pods with SNEB 68mm rockets.[12](Various other rocket types were tested)\n\n.30 in (7.62mm) machine guns.\n\nUK portal\n\nAviation portal\n\nAircraft of comparable role, configuration, and era\n\nAermacchi SF.260\n\nCessna T-41\n\nPAC CT/4 (Pacific Aerospace Limited)\n\nSaab 91 Safir\n\nUtva 75\n\nValmet L-70 Vinka\n\nGrumman American AA-1\n\nZlín Z 42\n\nRelated lists\n\nList of aircraft of the Royal Air Force\n\nEllis, Ken (2016).
