        "text": "Baggage handlers Swissport and Menzies, two of the three that operate at Edinburgh Airport, have moved unclaimed luggage to the site.\n\nBetween them, the companies work for airlines including Air Canada, Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, United, and Delta Air Lines.\n\nPassengers can visit the warehouse to collect their missing luggage between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. each day, the airport said. They require their luggage tags and ID to access the area.\n\nIf passengers can't collect their bags, Menzies said they would be sent by courier to their home address, or \"retagged for an appropriate flight\", using WorldTracer, a service used by airlines to reunite customers with lost baggage.\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"We understand the frustration and distress delayed baggage can have on people and our dedicated team is working hard to reunite baggage with passengers as soon as possible,\" Menzies said.\n\nAirlines have faced operational chaos this summer because of a combination of bad weather, technical problems, and understaffing. This has led to flight delays, cancellations, long lines at security, and lost luggage.\n\n\"Your airline's contracted handling agent is responsible for baggage, not Edinburgh Airport, and passengers with any queries should contact the relevant agent,\" the airport says on its website."
