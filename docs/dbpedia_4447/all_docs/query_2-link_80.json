        "text": "You have the legal right to claim compensation from the airline if your checked-in luggage is delayed, lost or damaged.\n\nYou only have the right to claim for a problem with cabin baggage if it’s the airline’s fault.\n\nImportant\n\nYou’re more likely to get compensation if you act quickly. You should:\n\nreport the problem to the airline straight away\n\ncheck deadlines - you may have to claim within 7 days of your flight\n\nIf you have travel insurance or home contents insurance that covers luggage, you’re likely to be better off making an insurance claim instead. You’ll probably get more money and find it easier to claim this way.\n\nWhat you could get from the airline\n\nWhat you can get from the airline is usually limited to money for:\n\nthe bare essentials you need if your luggage is delayed, eg toiletries and underwear\n\npart of the cost of replacing or repairing lost luggage and contents\n\nIf you have to collect delayed luggage yourself, you may be able to get the airline to pay for transport costs.\n\nAirlines often want receipts for everything included in your claim, and they won’t usually pay:\n\n‘new for old’ replacement for anything lost or damaged\n\nfor anything valuable, fragile or perishable in checked-in luggage\n\nmore than around £1,000 total compensation - and it’s usually a lot less\n\nfor stress, inconvenience or other things that happen because of a problem with your luggage, eg you miss a connection\n\nif your luggage was faulty\n\nReport the problem\n\nReport the problem to the airline straight away - you don’t legally have to do this, but if you do you’re more likely to get any compensation you claim from the airline.\n\nAfter you’ve reported the problem\n\nYou’ll still have to make a claim for compensation after you report the problem, unless the airline decides to pay you upfront, eg for expenses while your luggage is delayed.\n\nYou’ve already reported the problem if you filled in a ‘property irregularity report’ (PIR) at the airport - this is the form you get from customer services in the baggage claims hall.\n\nIf you didn’t report the problem at the airport, contact the airline or use their website to report the problem - and get the airline to confirm in writing that you reported it.\n\nKeep a copy of your PIR or written confirmation to help with your claim.\n\nDeadlines for claiming\n\nMost airlines follow these deadlines, but it’s a good idea to check with the airline.\n\nIf your luggage is delayed or missing, the airline has 21 days to find it and get it to you. If you get your luggage back within 21 days, you can still claim compensation for delayed luggage. If you don’t, claim for lost luggage.\n\nDocuments you’ll need\n\nAsk the airline what documents you’ll need - they’d usually expect you to have:\n\nyour boarding card\n\nyour luggage labels (these have a bar-code and number to identify your luggage)\n\nproof you reported the problem, eg your PIR form or email from the airline\n\nreceipts for things you had to buy because of a delay\n\nproof of purchase for lost or damaged things, eg receipts or credit card statements\n\nphotos of any damage to your luggage or contents\n\ncost estimates for any repairs you’re claiming for, eg from a luggage repair business\n\nMake a claim\n\nAsk the airline how they want you to send your claim. If they don’t have a claim form, you’ll probably have to write a letter to the airline’s customer service department.\n\nIn your letter, say you’re “claiming compensation under the Montreal Convention” - this will show the airline that you know your rights. Also make sure your letter includes:\n\ndetails of your flight - dates, flight number, departure and destination\n\nwhat happened to your luggage\n\nhow much money you’re asking for\n\na detailed description of everything that’s damaged or lost\n\na list or everything you had to buy because of a delay\n\ncopies of all the documents you need\n\nKeep a copy of your claim and original documents - you’ll need these if you’re not happy with the airline’s response and you want to take your claim further.\n\nIf you flew with more than one airline\n\nIf you had connecting flights with different airlines, you can claim compensation from any of them - but most airlines expect you to claim with the last airline you boarded.\n\nThe airline can’t say it’s not their responsibility or refuse to handle your claim because other airlines were involved. If they do, contact the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) for advice about what to do.\n\nIf you’re not happy with the airline’s response\n\nIf you’re not getting anywhere with the airline you can take your claim further.\n\nFirst try complaining to the CAA - use the form on the CAA website to ask them to take up your complaint with the airline.\n\nThe CAA will only consider your luggage complaint if the airline or airport involved is not a member of an approved alternative dispute resolution (ADR) scheme.\n\nCheck if the airline or airport is a member of an ADR scheme on the CAA website.\n\nAs a last resort, you can take your case to the small claims court within 2 years of the flight - this can be expensive and time-consuming. You should only do this if you think your claim is worth the stress and time of going to court. Read our advice on preparing for the small claims court if you need more help.\n\nFurther help\n\nFind out how to make a claim on your insurance policy or contact the Citizens Advice consumer helpline on 0808 223 1133 if you need more help - a trained adviser can give you advice over the phone. You can also use an online form.\n\nIf you’re in Northern Ireland, contact Consumerline."
