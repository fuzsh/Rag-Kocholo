        "text": "How to get here\n\nAir\n\nScotland’s largest airport, welcoming 14.7m passengers in 2019, Edinburgh Airport works with 40 airlines serving 100+ destinations across the globe. There are over 30 flights a day to London with a flight time of 1 hour. Other key hubs include Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Paris and New York which operate multiple flights/day with national air carriers.\n\nThe journey time from the airport into central Edinburgh is 30 minutes, with direct tram and bus services running every 7 minutes between 5:30 and 23:00.\n\nRail\n\nEdinburgh has two railway stations in the city centre. Waverley is the main station with all trains stopping there and is the most convenient for delegates attending events at the University of Edinburgh. Edinburgh has direct routes to many UK cities, including 25 trains a day to London, with an average journey time of 4 hours 15 minutes.\n\nHaymarket train station is located to the west of the city centre with only some trains stopping there.\n\nBook train travel: Trainline\n\nBus\n\nFor delegates travelling to Edinburgh by bus, the main bus station is centrally located at St Andrew Square, which is less than a mile to the Old Town Campus and 1.6m to the Pollock Estate. National bus travel can be booked via National Express, Citylink and MegaBus.\n\nAt a local level, the city is served by an award-winning local bus service from Lothian Buses. All our venues are well connected, with buses offering single and day tickets with contactless payment via card or device.\n\nTrams\n\nEdinburgh Trams currently run from Edinburgh Airport to York Place in the city centre (an extension to Newhaven to the north of the city is currently under construction). Delegates using this service should alight on Princes Street or at St Andrew Square for closest access to our venues. Tickets should be bought in advance from machines at each stop.\n\nOn foot & bike\n\nEdinburgh is a very compact and beautiful city, making it ideal for walking or cycling. We actively encourage our delegates and visitors to explore the city under their own steam, to take in the sights, soak up the unique atmosphere of each neighbourhood and experience the city first-hand. There’s an ever growing network of cycle paths in and around the Southside of Edinburgh and cycle parking is available at all our venues. CycleStreets can help you plan your journey.\n\nBy car\n\nIf you do need to attend an event with us on the Pollock Estate by car, free on-site parking is available, including 18 electric car charging points. These are allocated on a first come, first served basis."
