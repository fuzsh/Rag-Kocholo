        "text": "Loganair has outlasted dozens of British airlines since it was founded 60 years ago, but it's been a bumpy ride along the way.\n\nWhen Willie Logan took over a tiny air taxi firm in 1962, he probably had no idea that it would grow over time to become the UK's biggest regional airline.\n\nThe acquisition allowed the Muir of Ord-born businessman to travel around the country visiting building projects run by his civil engineering firm.\n\nRenaming the company Loganair, he became the proud owner of one aircraft - a Piper Aztec - based at Renfrew Airport.\n\nBut it didn't take long for the business to take off.\n\nIn October 1963, Loganair's first scheduled flight took place between Dundee and Edinburgh's Turnhouse Airport, catering for contractors working on the Tay Road Bridge.\n\nA year later, the airline won a contract to deliver newspapers and prescription drugs to the Western Isles.\n\nIt was the start of what was to become a growing list of lifeline routes, including air ambulance services, for some of Scotland's most remote communities.\n\nIn 1976, Loganair flew several Shetland ponies to Fair Isle after 80 years of their absence on the island.\n\nSheep have also taken to the skies with the airline. Veteran pilot Capt Eddie Watt recalls the day he flew a ram lamb from the island of Foula in order to \"protect the ewes from an unexpected suitor\".\n\nHe explains: \"With his feet tied together and a black bag tied over his back end, I had to fly him over to the Shetland mainland, where he was picked up by another crofter who had the space to contain him until the time was right.\n\n\"He was a good passenger and seemed to enjoy the flight.\"\n\nCapt Geoff Rosenbloom, who flew with Loganair between 1966 and 1970, vividly remembers the day he flew a coffin from Stornoway.\n\n\"As I was flying, I started hearing noises coming from it.\n\n\"It was rather disconcerting until I realised that it must have been caused by a change of pressure in the plane. It was an odd experience.\"\n\nIt was left with a fleet of only five Britten-Norman Islanders and a single Twin Otter aircraft.\n\nIt took until 1997 for the company's future to be secured when Loganair chairman Scott Grier led a management buyout.\n\nCurrent Loganair chief executive Jonathan Hinkles has said it was perhaps the closest the airline ever came to extinction.\n\nThe airline continued to grow, however. After 14 years as a franchise partner of British Airways, Loganair began a new partnership with Flybe in 2008.\n\nJonathan Hinkles explains: \"The Covid pandemic posed an existential threat to the entire airline industry, but Loganair was one of very few airlines to keep flying throughout. We had a job to do, and we did it.\n\n\"At the beginning of the pandemic, I said to our team that I didn't know whether we had a river or an ocean ahead of us to cross, but that we just had to keep swimming until we reached the other side.\n\n\"It was only in April of this year - as the final UK travel restrictions and face-covering mandates were lifted - that I felt we could really say we'd reached the other side.\"\n\nHaving flown solo since its split with Flybe, the airline now flies more than 70 routes throughout the UK, Isle of Man, Ireland, Norway and Denmark, and serves 34 UK airports.\n\nIt continues to look ahead to the future, having recently announced an order for eight new ATR turboprops.\n\nOver its 60-year lifespan, Loganair has had five different sets of owners.\n\nIt is now looking for its sixth.\n\nIn October the airline announced it was looking for a buyer, after its current owners decided to retire.\n\nMr Hinkles is confident that the Loganair name will live on, whichever company takes it over.\n\n\"I think it is one of the enduring strengths of the company, and it is a name synonymous with service to communities.\n\n\"Our growth over the last few years hasn't changed or diluted that commitment - it's simply meant that we've been able to bring the same brand of service and ethos to more communities.\""
