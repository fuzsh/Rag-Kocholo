        "text": "If you are a U.S. citizen traveling internationally, you will need a passport valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay for entry into Scotland; however, you do not need a visa for the short duration of this tour.\n\nIf you are a citizen of another country traveling internationally, you should contact the British embassy or consulate of your home country to determine what travel documentation is required.\n\nPlease note that longer stays abroad for any purpose may require additional travel documentation.\n\nWe recommend that you make at least two photocopies of all travel documents that you bring with you. Include copies of the photo page of your passport that contains the date of issuance, the date of expiration and your citizenship. Secure one set of copies in the safe in your room while traveling and leave one set behind with someone at home who will assist you in the event your documents are misplaced, lost or stolen.\n\nCruise Regulations\n\nInternational Maritime Security guidelines require that your passport information be provided to us prior to your embarkation. You need to provide this information to us as soon as you book your cruise or boarding may be denied.\n\nAIRFARE: Airfare to and from this destination is not included in the journey cost. If purchasing your air elsewhere, it is very important to provide us with your confirmed arriving and departing flight information no later than 3 weeks before your arrival date. Flight information can be submitted to Tauck (or verified, if you've already provided it) in the My Account section of Tauck.com.\n\nTAUCK AIRPORT TRANSFERS are included at the start and end of the journey between the airport and the Tauck hotel. Airport transfers are available for any pre tour or post tour hotel stays immediately consecutive to the tour, providing flight information is received in the Tauck office no later than three weeks in advance. Details on locating your transfer upon arrival to the tour start city will be included in your final documents.\n\nAIRLINES and CHECKED LUGGAGE: Due to space limitations during your Tauck journey, we ask that you please limit your checked luggage to one average-size suitcase per person. Besides complying with the Tauck restriction noted above, you should also be sure to research and comply with all airline baggage restrictions relating to your flights to and from your Tauck journey. Airlines have become much stricter in enforcing size and weight limits in recent years, and are free to revise luggage policies without notice. Researching and complying with airline luggage restrictions is the responsibility of the guest, and Tauck cannot be held responsible for any costs or disruptions to travel caused by the failure to research and comply with airline policies. PLEASE NOTE that if you are booked on a tour that includes on-tour flights, the checked luggage weight restrictions for these flights may be lower than the weight restrictions for your international flights.\n\nChecked Luggage – General\n\nDue to space restrictions, we ask that you please limit your checked luggage to one suitcase per person weighing no more than 50 pounds (23 kg) and with overall dimensions (length + width + height) not exceeding 62 inches (158 cm).\n\nBesides complying with the Tauck restriction noted above, you should also be sure to research and comply with all airline baggage restrictions relating to your flights to and from your Tauck journey. Airlines have become much more strict in enforcing size and weight limits in recent years, and luggage exceeding airline standards for size or weight may result in expensive overage fees or other consequences.\n\nAirlines are free to revise luggage policies without notice, and certain airlines have different baggage allowances for different classes of service. Researching and complying with airline luggage restrictions is the responsibility of the guest, and Tauck cannot be held responsible for any costs or disruptions to travel caused by the failure to research and comply with airline policies.\n\nTauck luggage tags will be provided by your Tauck Director on Day 1 of your itinerary. Please do not attach a Tauck luggage tag to any carry-on items, as the Tauck tags designate luggage that is to be handled and transferred by ground operators and hotel staff during your journey.\n\nCarry-on Luggage – General\n\nAlthough oversize bags and wheeled, carry-on luggage are popular for airline travel, they are often not convenient or appropriate for motor coach travel or for many on-tour flights. Most modern sightseeing motor coaches offer limited space for numerous or larger items. Space under seats or in the overhead rack is typically small, and designed to accommodate items like coats, hats, purses, and small camera bags, etc.\n\nFor your day-to-day travel while on tour, we recommend that you limit your hand luggage to a small, soft-sided carry-on piece, and only those items you need handy during the day such as purses, make-up, medications, cameras, film, etc. Items too large to fit under the motor coach seat or in the overhead rack must be stored in the luggage bays beneath the motor coach, and may not be accessible during daytime travel.\n\nBringing the right clothing for your trip is important – we've partnered with New Headings (Necessary Gear) who provide an \"easy-to-use, one-stop shop\" for your Tauck travel needs, specifically selected for this trip. Click here to visit their site.\n\nYour journey is designed with leisure in mind. Dress for comfort and convenience with a wardrobe that is adaptable and allows for layering. Generally, during the day, casual, comfortable, cotton clothing is recommended. Cool weather at higher elevations or at night will require warmer, layered clothing. Formal wear is never required.\n\nIn the ship's main dining room, slacks and a collared shirt are acceptable for gentlemen, and for women, slacks/skirt and a blouse are appropriate. We have found, however, that the international mix of travelers on board tend to dress somewhat more formally than one might expect. Thus, you may prefer to wear a jacket and tie or a cocktail dress for special evenings like the Captain's welcome and farewell dinners aboard the shipand for the special welcome and farewell dinners at the beginning and end of your journey. For dinner and throughout the evening, guests should refrain from wearing swimming shorts, bathing suits, t-shirts, tennis shoes or flip-flops.\n\nValet laundry and dry-cleaning services are available for a fee at the hotels. Onboard, valet laundry and pressing services are available for a fee.\n\nWe recommend that you pack an adequate supply of your prescription medication in its original container to last through your entire journey, together with a copy of your doctor's prescription or a letter from your health-care provider on office stationery explaining that the medication has been prescribed for you, a list of the generic names of your medication, your travel documents and a change of clothing in your carry-on bag to avoid any inconvenience in the event that your flight or luggage is delayed. No medications are sold on board the cruise ship other than those prescribed and stocked by the ship's physician.\n\nHairdryers are available at the hotels and aboard the ship. For safety reasons, curling and clothes irons are not permitted aboard the ship.\n\nFollowing is a list of recommended items to pack for a cruise:\n\nComfortable walking shoes (VERY IMPORTANT)\n\nHiking boots for those who choose to hike\n\nTrekking poles or a walking stick\n\nWater shoes or sneakers for those who choose to go on the rib boat (recommended)\n\nRainwear, such as a raincoat and rain hat, plus a collapsible umbrella, waterproof shoes/boots\n\nLong pants, fleece jacket or warm sweater; light sweater for warmer days\n\nWarm hat, gloves and socks (It can be cool and windy on the Scottish Isles)\n\nSport coat for men (with tie suggested for Captain's dinners) and slacks/dress for women for evening wear\n\nCamera, lenses, batteries, chargers and extra memory cards\n\nBinoculars\n\nSunglasses\n\nSunscreen and hat\n\nSmall flashlight\n\nDaypack for your photographic equipment or other belongings\n\nWashcloth - not all European hotels provide washcloths, so you may want to bring one along. A package of pre-moistened towelettes is an excellent alternative.\n\nTravel alarm clock/cell phone with alarm functions (many hotels do not have clocks in the rooms)\n\nPrescription medicines (an adequate supply to last your entire journey), and written copies of your prescriptions from your doctor. While it may be possible to refill prescriptions during your journey, the availability of refills cannot be guaranteed. What's more, refilling prescriptions in foreign countries can be difficult and time-consuming.\n\nCopies of your travel documents that should be secured in the safe in your ship cabin while traveling"
