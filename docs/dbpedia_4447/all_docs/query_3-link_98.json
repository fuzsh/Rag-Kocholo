        "text": "A major airport in Scotland has scrapped its rules surrounding how much liquid passengers can bring in their hand luggage. As of yesterday(April 26), those flying out of Aberdeen International Airport will no longer be relegated to a 100ml limit for liquids, nor will they have to be separated into plastic bags.\n\nThe change comes as the travel hub has installed new scanners that are slowly being rolled out across the UK. Aberdeen is the third airport in the UK to bring in the new equipment, following Teeside International and London City Airports.\n\nEarlier this month, the government announced it would be extending the date that all airports must bring in this new “cutting edge” technology, which has been announced as this June. While this is likely to make trips through airport security safer and easier, it’s important to know that the rule still remains in other airports and guidelines may differ for your return trip.\n\nREAD MORE: Will Scottish airports be ready to ditch the 100ml liquid rule ahead of June deadline?\n\nTherefore, it is important to check what the process is at both your departing and any other airports you will travel through or from before you set off.\n\nHere’s what you should know about the change.\n\nWhy is the 100ml liquid rule for hand luggage being scrapped?\n\nAberdeen, Scotland’s third largest airport, has changed its rules on hand luggage liquids after installing the latest Next Generation Security Checkpoint (NGSC) scanners.\n\nThese new devices detect items with great accuracy, eliminating the need for flyers to remove them from their baggage. Not only do they make the 100ml rule non-applicable, it also means that electrics like laptops, tablets and more can remain in carry-on bags.\n\nWilliam Wallace, Security Manager at Aberdeen International Airport, said: “We are delighted to have the NGSC scanners operational at Aberdeen. We are well ahead of the deadline set by the Government thanks to all the hard work from our staff and contractors.\n\nHow much liquid can I now bring through security?\n\nAnyone travelling through Aberdeen can now pack up to two litres of liquid in their carry-on.\n\nThe airport’s current website guidelines state: “Passengers can travel with containers with up to two litres of liquid inside. Explosive or flammable liquids, and those that are considered toxic, are not permitted in either hand or hold luggage.”\n\nDoes the 100ml rule still apply at Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports?\n\nAs of now, Scotland’s other major airports still require passengers to follow the 100ml hand-luggage rules, but this will likely change either before or by the government deadline of June 2024."
