This illustrated history tells the story of the independent airlines servicing Scotland, from the pre-war pioneers to BEA and Loganair in the post-war period, and covering the many airlines to operate from Scottish airports with varying degrees of success. Scotland's Airlines covers oil-related charters, the Scottish air ambulance, as well as companies based elsewhere but constituting major carriers in Scotland."
