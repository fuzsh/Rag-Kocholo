        "text": "Holidaymakers have been warned of potential travel disruption this weekend as UK transport networks continue to feel the impact of Friday’s global IT outage.\n\nFlight delays and cancellations are among the disruption expected to continue into the weekend after the outage, with experts warning it could take weeks for systems to fully recover.\n\nA morning flight from Inverness to Gatwick is one such flight that's been affected on Saturday. A statement from airline group Easyjet confirmed the cancellation of flight EZY846 from Inverness to Gatwick on its website, stating that the cancellation was “outside of our control”.\n\nA statement from Easyjet Operations Control read: “We’re sorry that the flight has been cancelled. This is due to air traffic control restrictions.\n\n“The disruption to your flight is outside of our control and is considered to be an extraordinary circumstance. Following the global IT outage yesterday, we expect there may still be some disruption in airports today.\n\n”Please continue to check the status of your flights here on Flight Tracker for the latest information.\n\n”While these circumstances are outside of our control, we are sorry for any difficulty or inconvenience caused by this and we would like to reassure you that we are doing everything possible to minimise the impact of the disruption.\"\n\nTravel association Abta urged holidaymakers to check with providers if there are “any extra steps” they may need to take.\n\nThe Port of Dover said early on Saturday that it was dealing with “hundreds of displaced” airport passengers and urged customers to ensure they had a booking before arrival. It also posted on X that approach roads were “slow moving”, with a 60-minute wait time in the buffer zone.\n\nFerry operator DFDS said on X that there were wait times of up to 120 minutes at Dover border controls and 30 minutes at check-in.\n\nA flawed update rolled out by CrowdStrike, one of the world’s largest cybersecurity providers, knocked many businesses offline around the world on Friday, causing flight and train cancellations and crippling some healthcare systems.\n\nCrowdStrike chief executive George Kurtz said he was “deeply sorry” for the situation and said CrowdStrike was “actively working” with those impacted.\n\nIndustry expert Adam Leon Smith of BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, warned it could take “weeks” for all computers and systems to be fully restored, while Mr Kurtz said it would take “some time”.\n\nSome 167 flights scheduled to depart UK airports were axed on Friday, with others delayed, while 171 flights due to land in the UK were cancelled, following the technical glitch.\n\nAviation analytics company Cirium said 5,078 flights – or 4.6% of those scheduled – were cancelled globally on Friday, including the 167 UK departures.\n\nAway from travel, the National Pharmacy Association warned disruption to pharmacy services is likely to continue through the weekend, even when systems are back online, as outlets deal with a backlog of medicine deliveries.\n\nProfessor Ciaran Martin, the founding chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), also said it was hard to estimate how long it would take to recover from the outage.\n\n“The underlying problem is fixed and the fixes are being implemented,” he said.\n\n“Some industries can recovery quickly. But others like aviation will have long backlogs. That said, I’d be surprised if we were still facing serious problems this time next week.”\n\nExperts warned users to “remain vigilant” against potential scams as systems recover.\n\nCrowdStrike’s stock tumbled in value when the US markets opened on Friday as investors digested the impact of the outage.\n\nShares slid by over 8% at the start of trading, knocking around 10 billion US dollars (£7.8 billion) off its market value. The largest financial markets in the US and UK fell during the trading session as other companies were also affected.\n\nThe flawed update caused major infrastructure to grind to a halt with computer systems knocked offline, and many devices were showing the so-called “blue screen of death” as they got stuck in an endless cycle of trying to reboot themselves, affecting key sectors across the country.\n\nThe outage caused disruption in “the majority of GP practices”, NHS England said, and ambulance services also reported increased pressure on 999 and NHS 111 services with calls from patients who were unable to contact other NHS providers because of the IT issues.\n\nAcross England, GP surgeries reported being unable to book appointments or access patient records as their EMIS Web system went down.\n\nIn the UK, Sky News briefly went off air on Friday morning and Britain’s biggest train company Govia Thameslink Railway warned passengers to expect disruption because of “widespread IT issues”.\n\nAround the world, banks, supermarkets and other major institutions reported computer issues disrupting services, while many businesses were unable to take digital payments or access key databases.\n\nMicrosoft deputy chief information security officer Ann Johnson described the outage as “a very major issue” and could not predict how long it would take to get all customers back online."
