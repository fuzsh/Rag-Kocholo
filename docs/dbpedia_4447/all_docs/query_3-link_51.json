        "text": "Edinburgh Airport\n\nWith 15 million passengers passing through its doors every year, Edinburgh Airport (EDI) is the busiest in Scotland and among the busiest in the UK. But finding your way around is very straightforward, as everything is in one terminal. The check-in desks and arrivals hall are both on the ground floor, while the departures area is on the first floor.\n\nAnd you’ll have no trouble getting cheap flight tickets from Edinburgh Airport, as there are dozens of airlines to compare. Big names include American Airlines, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, but several low-cost carriers – like easyJet and Wizz Air – also offer Edinburgh flights.\n\nShopping and dining\n\nIf you fancy a bite to eat before your flight, you’ll have plenty of choice. You can grab a sandwich from Costa, Caffè Nero or Pret, or head to Krispy Kreme for something sweet. When you feel like something more substantial, Hudson St Grill or The Sir Walter Scott Wetherspoon have got you covered. All Bar One’s the place for cocktails, while Scottish sensation BrewDog serves up a variety of beer. There are also three airport lounges, if you want to unwind in style.\n\nShopaholics will be happy, too. Edinburgh Airport has all sorts of brands, ranging from high street favourites such as Accessorize and Next, to designers labels like Jo Malone, Kurt Geiger and Michael Kors. Plus, there’s Heritage of Scotland and Tartan Weaving Mill for those all-important gifts.\n\nGetting into Edinburgh\n\nEdinburgh Airport is about eight miles west of the city centre, and has a number of transport options. A 25-minute taxi into Edinburgh costs roughly £40, or you can hop on a local bus right outside the terminal. The Airlink 100 runs every 15 minutes and reaches St Andrew Square in half an hour – and a ticket costs no more than £5. Alternatively, you could buy a return tram ticket for about £9. There’s a tram from Edinburgh Airport every 15 minutes which goes to popular places like Haymarket, Princes Street and York Place.\n\nAirport hotels\n\nIf you’ve booked a red-eye flight and want to stay close to the airport, there are two Hilton hotels just a stone’s throw away. Hampton by Hilton is a short walk from the terminal, while Doubletree by Hilton offers a free two-minute shuttle to the terminal.\n\nGlasgow Airport\n\nJust 48 miles away from Edinburgh, Glasgow Airport (GLA) is Scotland’s second-biggest airport, serving nearly nine million passengers each year. You’re bound to get a good deal on flights, as more than 20 airlines operate from Glasgow, including Aer Lingus, Emirates and KLM.\n\nThere’s just one terminal and, to make things even easier, there’s also the Glasgow Airport App. If you download it, you’ll be able to see live flight notifications, a terminal map, and discounts for the airport’s shops and restaurants. You can even pre-order food – perfect if you’re in a hurry.\n\nShopping and dining\n\nGlasgow Airport has a great choice of bars, cafés and restaurants. You’ll find popular chains like Frankie & Benny’s, Starbucks and Wetherspoons, alongside stylish spots like Caledonia Bar and Beardmore Bar & Restaurant. Alternatively, if you fancy some VIP treatment, book your spot in the UpperDeck Lounge. You can stay in this relaxing space for up to three hours, as you enjoy snacks, drinks and great views of the runway.\n\nThere’s a small selection of shops here, too. If you forget any travel essentials, make tracks for Boots or WHSmith. There’s also an Accessorize, M&S Simply Food, JD Sports, Sunglasses Hut and – of course – a duty free shop.\n\nGetting into Glasgow\n\nCentral Glasgow lies eight miles east of the airport, and is easily reached by taxi or bus. You can expect a taxi to cost about £36, with the journey taking around 25 minutes. Or you could catch the Glasgow Airport Express 500 – a bus service which runs every half an hour, stopping in central spots like Bothwell Street, Central Station and Buchanan Bus Station. An adult return ticket costs about £15, but discounted family tickets and groups tickets are also available.\n\nAirport hotels\n\nIf you need a hotel near Glasgow Airport, you’ll have several to choose from. There’s a Holiday Inn and a Holiday Inn Express within a five-minute walk of the airport. Or you could book the Courtyard by Marriott, Premier Inn or Travelodge, which are all less than a 10-minute walk away."
