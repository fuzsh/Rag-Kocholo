        "text": "General Information\n\nThe Residents Fare Card allows people whose main residence is on Barra, Vatersay, Coll or Tiree to book residents fare tickets on the Transport Scotland subsidised air services between Glasgow Airport and Barra and Tiree. Students that are studying away from home, but whose main residence is on Barra, Vatersay, Coll or Tiree can also get a Residents Fare Card.\n\nIn order to apply for a Residents Fare Card you need to provide, along with an original completed application form, proof of residence confirming that the address you are applying for is your main/permanent residence. Proof of residence is two official documents from different sources that clearly show that they have been sent to you with your full name and address and dated within 6 months. The documents can be photocopies, scans or photos as they are non-returnable and will be confidentially destroyed. We do not accept hand written documents or documents from third parties where the only purpose of the document is to state residency. Please note for an applicant that is 16 years old, we only require one proof of residence.\n\nThe Residents Fare Card will be valid from 25 October 2023 to 24 October 2027 in line with the grant period for the air services from Glasgow to Barra and Tiree. Applicants will not be able to use their Residents Fare Card before 25 October 2023 even if the date of travel is after that date.\n\nFrom 25 October 2023 to 24 October 2024, Residents Fares are capped at £91 for Barra and £81 for Tiree. The cap will increase by £2 each year. The airline operating these services can choose to sell tickets cheaper than this however they can’t charge people with a valid Residents Fare Card more than this. People without a valid Residents Fare card will be charged the commercial rate for their tickets which might be higher than the capped amount.\n\nThe Scottish Government reserves the right to terminate or vary the residents fare at any time without notice. The termination or variation will have immediate effect, irrespective of the proposed date of travel.\n\nConditions\n\nOnly those whose permanent/main residence is on Barra, Vatersay, Coll or Tiree (including students studying away from home) can apply for a Residents Fare Card. Second home owners and those whose do not have a residence on Barra, Vatersay, Tiree or Coll are not eligible. Students that are studying away from their permanent/main residence need to provide a copy of their student card along with their proof of residence and inform us the expected length of their studies. If it is subsequently found that an applicant does not meet the eligibility criteria then their card will be cancelled.\n\nPeople under the age of 16 can be included in one or more cards of people who are the legal guardian, parent or carer of those persons under 16 years of age.\n\nChanges\n\nIf at any point you move house and are no longer a resident on Barra, Vatersay, Tiree or Coll then you must cancel your Residents Fare Card. To cancel your card please email info@residentsfare.com or write to Residents Fare, PO Box 5715, Inverness, IV1 9AS\n\nAny changes to your personal details, including, change of address, change of name, addition or removal of dependents, should be notified at once to the Administration Team at: PO Box 5715, Inverness, IV1 9AS, on Freephone 0800 032 2890 or info@residentsfare.com. Failure to inform the Administration Team could result in your card being cancelled, due to incorrect information being held and the card becoming invalid.\n\nCompliance and Misuse\n\nMembers should book Residents Fare tickets only for themselves or for any dependents included in their card. Members should not book Residents Fare tickets for anyone else or allow their card to be used for this purpose.
