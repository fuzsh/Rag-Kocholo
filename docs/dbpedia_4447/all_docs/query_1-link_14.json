        "text": "Flying into Edinburgh\n\nImmigration and passport control\n\nIf you're arriving on an international flight you will go through immigration and passport control when you arrive at the airport.\n\nThis part of the terminal is controlled by UK Border Force and they take all decisions around passport control, immigration, and procedures within the hall.\n\nWhile airport staff will be there to provide support where it is needed, we do not manage the process and it is ultimately the responsibility of staff employed by the UK Government.\n\nPlease note, as of July 2024 fastTrack passport control has been withdrawn following changes brought in by UK Border Force.\n\nFind out more about the arrivals process on the UK Government website.\n\nMake sure you've got your passport and any other relevant documents ready to be inspected.\n\nMore information on the different types of documentation can be found on the UK Government website.\n\nThe immigration hall is split into three different areas. These are:\n\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss nationals. This includes all EU countries, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.\n\nNon-EEA (all other nationalities). Make sure to fill out a landing card before you go to one of the passport desks. You can get these either on board your flight or from a member of staff in the immigration hall.\n\nEEA and Swiss nationals with chipped passports. Good news – anyone with an electronic chip in their passport can use the electronic passport gates for a faster journey through immigration.\n\nThe UK Government has introduced an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - essentially a digital permission to travel - for some nationalities. This is required for entry to the UK.\n\nFor information on who can apply for an ETA visit the UK Government website.\n\nConnecting flights & stopping over\n\nDo I need to...\n\nInternational to UK flights.\n\nUK to International flights:\n\nWe don’t have anywhere to sleep inside the terminal, but there are airport hotels just outside. If you leave the airport when stopping over you’ll need to go through passport control.\n\nBaggage reclaim\n\nAfter passport control you can go straight to baggage reclaim.\n\nYou normally need to collect bags and check them in again if you are connecting to another flight, but check with your airline.\n\nNeed more info on customs? Check out the UK government’s advice.\n\nArriving on a domestic flight\n\nPassengers arriving on domestic flights can go straight to baggage reclaim.\n\nAirlines and their appointed handling agents are responsible for the processing, transporting, and delivering bags."
