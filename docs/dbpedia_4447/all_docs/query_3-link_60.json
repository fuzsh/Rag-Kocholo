        "text": "People have been playing golf on the Old Course—the oldest and most iconic in the world—since the 15th century. Still, it remains public, so even tourists can play a round there, though bookings do have to be made months in advance.\n\nHome to more than half of Scotland’s distilleries, Speyside is the site of the Malt Whisky Trail. The nine distilleries on the tour can be visited in any order, with Glenfiddich and Glenlivet garnering particularly rave reviews.\n\nTom Kitchin (aptly named) is the Michelin-starred chef of one of Edinburgh’s highest-ranked restaurants. The Kitchin’s specialties—like its signature dish, pig’s head meat with langoustines.\n\nThe award-winning Ubiquitous Chip gets its name from Scotland’s inaccurate reputation for a lack of fine cuisine. Its chef gives resolutely Scottish ingredients a French twist.\n\nLooming over the city from its craggy Castle Rock perch, Edinburgh Castle has played a central role in Scottish history both as a royal residence and a mighty military stronghold.\n\nOne of the only medieval cathedrals in all of Scotland to have made it through the Reformation intact, the Glasgow Cathedral is a brilliant example of Gothic architecture. Home to one of the finest post-war collections of stained glass windows in Britain, its cemetery (the Necropolis) is a beauty also worth exploring.\n\nEntry/exit requirements\n\nTo get information regarding passports and all necessary visas, please visit the country travel advice and advisories of the Government of Canada.\n\nVaccination\n\nTo obtain information concerning vaccines, please visit the Government of Canada’s travel website or ask your health professional about vaccination requirements."
