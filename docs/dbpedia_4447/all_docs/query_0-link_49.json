        "text": "Jeff Hirsch is thrilled to be leading this trip to Scotland and take you to the wild landscape of the Highlands, and the Western Isles. He invites you to join him on this amazing journey. The number of participants is limited to twelve, so sign up early before the trip is full. This itinerary features the Highlands, Isle of Skye, and Lewis & Harris in the Outer Hebrides. Each day will be at a relaxed pace, allowing enough time to photograph the diverse landscape as well as taking in the local history, people, and culture.\n\nOn the Outer Hebrides you will be based at Breascleate on the west coast of Lewis, midway between Callanish and Carloway. Callanish has become an icon of the archaeology of Scotland, inspiring many artists, poets, and photographers. The pale and sometimes ghostly stones have an extraordinary affinity with their landscape. Both to the north and south you will encounter many beautiful and exciting photo opportunities.\n\nHarris and Lewis are not separate islands, despite usually being talked of as if they are. Harris is the southern third of the largest and most northerly of the Western Isles, most of which forms Lewis. Some say the distinction between the two dates back to a split in the MacLeod clan which dominated the Western Isles for centuries. Others simply point to the range of high mountains that impeded land access between Lewis and Harris, turning them into virtually separate islands. There are numerous sandy beaches and little coves, extensive moorland interspersed with lochs, and many historical sites throughout this sparsely populated area, including Callanish.\n\nA ferry trip across the sea takes you to the tiny village of Uig, on the Isle of Skye. From your home base explore the Trotternish Peninsula and beyond. A few of the highlights include the spectacular Quiraing range, the Old Man of Storr, lochs and the colorful village of Portree. a basalt uprising that is the dominant feature of the.\n\nAs you leave Skye there is a meeting point of three sea lochs on the west coast of the Scottish mainland. Here you will find the very photogenic Eilean Donan Castle. Continue on to Fort William and the Highlands. Photograph the architecture, landscape, waterfalls, lochs, and vast mountain ranges.\n\nAccommodations are at quaint inns or lodges, all rooms having private bathrooms. Breakfasts will be taken at the lodges, while lunches will usually be picnics in the field or pub lunches, with dinners at local restaurants, those meals included are listed in itinerary. The food is both delicious and wholesome. Transportation will be in a comfortable bus.\n\nThe trip is suited for people of all photographic levels, and there will be plenty of time to work individually with participants to address specific photographic concerns. This is primarily a photo tour, concentrating on shooting rather than critique. Participants should be in good physical condition if they wish to partake in hikes over rough terrain."
