        "text": "CHANDLER, Ariz. — The City of Chandler is hosting a series of public workshops this fall to discuss the new Downtown Region Area Plan and solicit feedback from community stakeholders. This update will focus on exploring and defining ways the downtown area has changed while looking to the future. This update also will create a community-built vision to guide Chandler with the downtown’s development and growth more accurately and holistically.\n\nThe August workshops titled “Visioning: Help Shape Chandler’s Downtown Region” will be held at the Downtown Chandler Library, 22 S. Delaware St., Copper Room. Staff will provide an overview of the update and then divide into groups to provide input while answering a series of targeted questions from city staff and the project consultant. The August Visioning workshops will be held on:\n\nSaturday, Aug. 17 | 9 a.m. to noon. This session also will feature a Washington Street alignment update from 9-10 a.m.\n\nMonday, Aug. 19 | 4:30-6:30 p.m.\n\nThose unable to attend in person will have an opportunity to attend upcoming outreach meetings scheduled for Sept. 7 and 10 and Nov. 15 and 16. Additional details on these workshop themes will be provided in the coming weeks. Chandler residents and stakeholders also are encouraged to take an online questionnaire to share feedback at Downtown Region Update.\n\nThis updated Downtown Region Area Plan will combine two existing area plans: the South Arizona Avenue Plan, adopted in 2006 and amended in 2008; and the Chandler Redevelopment Element, adopted in 1995.\n\nFor more information about the planning process and future public engagement opportunities, or to sign up for updates via email, visit Downtown Region Update. For additional questions, contact City of Chandler Senior Planner Alisa Petterson at 480-782-3060.\n\nMedia contacts:\n\nStephanie Romero\n\nPublic Information Officer, City of Chandler\n\n480-782-2231"
