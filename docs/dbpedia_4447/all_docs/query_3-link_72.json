        "text": "A MAJOR Scottish airport is set for a shake-up - and it's good news for holidaymakers.\n\nA project is underway at Edinburgh Airport to deliver an \"improved experience\" for passengers departing from the popular hub.\n\nThe IT team is upgrading two large screens before and after World Duty Free while a fresh look has been applied to all displays.\n\nThe new system also allows the development of features such as language translations for certain flights and destination weather.\n\nThe investment comes as part of the airport's operating replacement project and is one of several improvements being delivered for passengers during summer 2024.\n\nStephanie Battye, IT Service Delivery Manager, at Edinburgh Airport said: \"This is a brilliant change for passengers, it gives them consistency throughout the terminal.\n\n\"We've replaced all the screens in the terminal, so what we've done is improve it not only from a look and feel perspective, but we've also replaced our hardware and made it consistent throughout.\n\n\"This opens up a world of opportunity to us. It is a brand new platform with the potential to introduce key functionality if and when we choose to do so.\"\n\nA number of other projects are currently in the works at the airport.\n\nImprovements include new food and beverage outlets, more water fountains in the departure lounge, more electric vehicles operating on the airfield, and more space in the check-in hall.\n\nIt comes days after airport bosses confirmed that strict liquid rules wouldn't be scrapped in time for the summer holidays.\n\nWe also told how a huge change means holidaymakers can whizz through ahead of their flights.\n\nThe airport issued an update on its Twilight Bag Drop which will see the service increase its hours and days.\n\nIt is available to passengers flying with Ryanair, easyJet, Jet2, and British Airways.\n\nThe free service allows passengers on morning flights to come to the airport the night before to check in their luggage, meaning they can head straight to security on the day of their flight."
