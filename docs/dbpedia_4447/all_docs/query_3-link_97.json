        "text": "President Trump’s organization entered into a business partnership in 2014 with a Scottish airport that recently directed a United States Air Force Crew to an overnight stay at one of Trump’s resorts — something the president denied any involvement in, according to a New York Times report.\n\nUnder the 2014 arrangement, the Trump Organization agreed to try to boost private and commercial air traffic to Glasgow Prestwick Airport in exchange for helping to send flight crews to the Trump-owned Turnberry resort, according to documents obtained by the paper.\n\nTo help obtain the extra business, Turnberry — which is 20 miles outside the airport — was added to an existing list of hotels that Glasgow Prestwick would normally book for arriving crews, the documents revealed.\n\n“As a list of hotels that we use for our business, being honest, Turnberry was always last on the list, based on price,” Jules Matteoni, a manager at Glasgow Prestwick, wrote in June 2015 to executives at Trump Turnberry.\n\n“Yesterday’s proposal places Turnberry in a favorable position and gives us food for thought in our placement of crews moving forward.”\n\nOn Monday, the airport confirmed to the Times the arrangement with Turnberry.\n\n“We provide a full handling service for customers and routinely arrange overnight accommodation for visiting aircrew when requested,” the Prestwick airport said in a statement. “We use over a dozen local hotels, including Trump Turnberry, which accounts for a small percentage of the total hotel bookings we make.”\n\nSince Trump took office, the partnership has raised some eyebrows — especially since a seven-member United States Air Force crew who flew into Glasgow Prestwick in March ended up staying at Turnberry.\n\nTrump took to Twitter on Monday to clear the air.\n\n“I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!). NOTHING TO DO WITH ME,” Trump wrote.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for United States military crews to land in Glasgow Prestwick, as the United States Air Force and the airport had a separate arrangement in place, even before Trump became president, the Times notes.\n\nUnder that existing arrangement, American military planes refuel at the Scottish airport, which helps arrange local overnight stays for the arriving crews.\n\nAir Force trips to the airport, however, have increased each year Trump has been in office, the Times says.\n\nIn 2017, 180 of the American military planes landed at Prestwick. So far this year, 259 of them have stopped the airport, according to the Times.\n\nOf the 259 Air Force trips, 220 of them included overnight stays. It’s unclear how often crews from those stays were sent to Trump Turnberry."
