        "text": "The snowy tops of Macdui, Sronna Lairige, Braeriach, Angel’s Peak (Sgor an Lochain Uaine) and Cairn Toul are photographed from an Aerofilms plane.\n\nThe company started photographing Scottish landscapes, towns and industries in the late 1920s, selling the images as postcards and business promotional materials.\n\nTaking off from Wick airfield on 21 May 1941, Flying Offcer Michael Suckling was in search of the Bismarck, one of Germany’s largest and most powerful battleships, most recently spotted near Norway.\n\nSuckling managed to find the Bismarck hiding in a fjord near Bergen and take this photograph. Suckling hand-delivered his image to London and the Royal Navy set off to find and destroy this prestigious enemy target.\n\nRAF photographers capture the rings of Ben Hiant, a collapsed volcano in Ardnamurchan.\n\nThis image was taken by a crew training in photographic reconnaissance. It was one of 300,000 photographs taken by the RAF National Survey of the UK between 1946 and 1951, creating a mosaic map of the whole country.\n\nDuring the Second World War, airfields scattered the coast and nearby inland areas of Scotland. RAF photographs taken during and after the War recorded the size, layout and facilities of each one.\n\nThe first image shows Baldoon Airfield, Wigtown opened in 1941 but regular floods meant that the airfield was often unusable. The tarmac runways visible here were laid in 1942.\n\nThe second image shows Fearn Airfield, Balintore. In 1943, Fearn Airfield on the Moray Firth coastline was transferred from the RAF to the Royal Navy. The airfield was renamed HMS Owl and used for torpedo training.\n\nThe civilian airfield at Machrihanish was too small for military operations so a second airfield was built nearby.\n\nAircraft based at Machrihanish patrolled the Atlantic Ocean for enemy submarines and protected convoys of ships bringing supplies to Britain.\n\nDyce was the home of No. 8 Operational Training Unit which trained pilots to take aerial reconnaissance photographs.\n\nThe RAF at Dyce also provided defence against attacks from German-occupied Norway.\n\nThe distinctive two-mile stretch of West Sands provides a backdrop to the Old Course of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The town’s medieval streets - North, Market and South – form a clear triangle converging at the town’s ruined cathedral near East Beach.\n\nTo the far right, a new street layout emerges as homes are built for the town’s expanding population.\n\nThis image from the HES Archives records the natural environment of Belhaven Bay, the town of Dunbar and Torness Nuclear Power station beyond, while also capturing the dog-tooth patterns of First World War trenches in the grass beside the forestry plantation on the right.\n\nSandwood Bay is on the north-west coast six miles south of Cape Wrath, facing the full force of Atlantic storms.\n\nThe 1.5-mile white sand beach is separated from the freshwater Sandwood Loch by dunes and is only accessible by a four-mile walking track.\n\nTwo earth ramparts separated by a ditch created an enclosure for the farmers who lived at Rispain Camp around 60BC.\n\nThis Iron Age farmstead is so well-preserved that archaeologists used to think it was a more recent medieval structure.\n\nFrom the town of Broadford in southern Skye the softer rounded curves of the Red Cuillins provide a foreground to the jagged peaks of the Black Cuillins.\n\nCommercial services from the airfield discontinued in 1988, but the site is often used for filming."
