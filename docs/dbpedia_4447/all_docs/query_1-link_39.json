Longer lines are possible so allow extra time.”\n\nChicago O’Hare International Airport advised passengers to check their flight status directly with their carrier due to the tech issues. “Longer lines and wait times are possible, please allow extra time,” it said.\n\nJohn F.

Iberia Airlines, the flag carrier of Spain’s airline, told CNN their systems started working again at 9:30 a.m. local time (3:30 a.m. ET), adding there were still some delays.\n\nPrague Airport said the issues have affected its global check-in system, delaying flights.\n\nIreland’s Ryanair also confirmed a disruption to the airline’s network, advising passengers to arrive at least three hours before their scheduled departure time.\n\nAir France, the country’s flag carrier, said the IT issue had disrupted its operations — although flights already in the air are not affected.\n\nTurkish Airlines said it was experiencing problems with ticketing, check-in and reservations. “Our teams are working diligently to resolve the issue,” the airline said.\n\nCentral and South America\n\nPanama-based Copa Airlines said it is also one of the global airlines impacted and some flights might be delayed following the large-scale third-party software outage, according to a post on X on Friday. The airline asked passengers to “go to the airport at least 4 hours before your departure.”"
