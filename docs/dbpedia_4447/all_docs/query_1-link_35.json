        "text": "The CAA supports the right for all air passengers to be treated with respect and dignity. When leaving the UK by air, it is necessary for all passengers to pass through airport security controls, where both persons and bags will be screened. This is an essential process to safeguard the travelling public, staff and the aviation industry. The following provides information and advice for transgender, non-binary and intersex passengers.\n\nBuying tickets and checking-in: When making an airline reservation, you will be required to provide your name, date of birth and gender, which must match the details on your government issued travel document. This proof of identity may also need to be produced when you check in for your flight. It does not matter if your current gender presentation is not the same as that given on your travel documentation or the accompanying photograph, but the information on your ticket must align with that on your passport or other travel document, otherwise you may not be allowed to travel. If another person has booked your ticket, ensure they book using the information on your travel document. See www.gov.uk/changing-passport-information/gender for further information on passports.\n\nPacking your Hold and Cabin Baggage: All cabin baggage must be screened by X-ray equipment as a minimum and may also be hand searched by airport Security Officers. UK airports are required by law to conduct this screening. Cabin baggage is subject to different regulatory measures than hold baggage and it is advisable to check regulations before travel. Where possible consider packing all but items that are essential for the journey in hold baggage, for example any item containing liquids, gels or powders. This includes gel-filled prosthetic items apart from those worn on the body for the journey. Prescription liquid medication in containers of more than 100ml may be carried in Cabin Baggage but must be removed for separate screening, unless you are specifically advised otherwise by the airport, and must be accompanied by medical confirmation, such as a letter from a medical professional or prescription, with names matching travel documentation. This can be carried in addition to the usual one-litre bag that is allowed for toiletry and cosmetic items. At the same time, please note carefully the items, particularly dangerous goods, that your airline advises should not be packed in Hold baggage.\n\nSecurity: All passengers must be screened before going into the departure lounge usually by a Walk Through Metal Detector, a Security Scanner, or both. In order to speed up the journey, you should ensure that all metallic items are removed, including footwear containing metal, belts, watches and large pieces of jewellery and ensure all pockets are empty. Any alarms will require further screening, usually by hand search or Security Scanner. If a hand search is required, you may ask for a search in private and have a companion with you if you wish. A Security Officer should always ask for your consent before beginning a hand search. The Security Officer may also request that you undergo a search in private; this is always in an area or room away from public view, where a hand search will take place and possibly with a hand-held metal detector or other hand held security equipment.\n\nA Security Scanner will highlight anything unusual that it detects may be being carried on the body by a passenger. It will not display an actual image, but will indicate for the Security Officer an area for further investigation on an outline of a generic figure. No identifiable or personal features are visible on the screen. If you think you know what may have caused the alarm, you may wish to explain to the Security Officer what the item that has indicated may be. In many cases, especially where the Security Officer understands what has caused the alarm, a hand search of the area may be sufficient. However, the Security Officer may request a private search if they do not feel that the cause of the alarm can be resolved in this manner. Passengers may opt out of screening by Security Scanner if they wish: however unless a medical reason for this can be evidenced, such as medical device that is attached to the body, then the airport is required to carry out an enhanced hand search in private. This may entail the loosening or removal of clothing in order that the Security Officer can satisfy themselves that no prohibited articles are carried on the person. All such searches are carried out with a witness and a companion may accompany you if you wish."
