I think it was a Werramatic.\n\t\n\tWe were on a family holiday to Ayr in Whit Week in 1969, or was it 1970? The occasion for this visit to a packed Prestwick Airport was to see the first 'Jumbo' 747 Aircraft to land at the Airport. I've since tried to find the date for this, but with no success so far. For my fellow bus enthusiasts out there, the bus in front of the camera looks to be a Duple(Midland) bodied Bedford J2. The minicoach just visible on the right is registered FSD900D, a 1966 Bedford CAL with Martin Walter 11-seat coachwork owned by Meek's, Prestwick. For car enthusiasts, there are plenty to pick from including a nearly new 'G' registered Ford Corsair and just past the white Mini is an American styled car. Over on the right, near the Airport entrance is a white Austin/Morris 1100/1300 police car.\n\t\n\tI will post these early slides in my collection in memory of my late father(1928-2000). I would request, as with all my photos  that they are not copied or downloaded in any way, shape or form. © Peter Steel in memory of G. Steel c.1969.",
