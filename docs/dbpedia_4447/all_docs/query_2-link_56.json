        "text": "Planning your visit\n\nI’ve submitted the Contact Us form and been directed here, but my question isn’t answered.\n\nIf your question hasn’t been answered by any of the FAQs on our website, and you have submitted your question to us via the Contact Us form, we’ll get back to you as soon as possible by email. Please submit your enquiry to us just once as multiple submissions can add to the backlog and may delay our response time.\n\nWhat do I need to know about visiting?\n\nSome of our places are currently operating an advance booking system for all visitors. Please visit the individual property page to check if you need to book your time slot.\n\nPlease follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, and take great care to leave no litter behind.\n\nWe also ask that you do not park in our car parks overnight. Motor homes and caravans should use official sites, as our rural car parks have no cleaning or waste disposal facilities.\n\nPlease keep access roads clear at all times, even if the main car park is full. It is a good idea to have a back-up plan in place in case a property is busy when you arrive.\n\nDoes my National Trust for Scotland membership give me access to National Trust places?\n\nYes. A National Trust for Scotland membership opens up a whole world of heritage for members to explore. We have reciprocal membership agreements with similar organisations around the globe, granting Trust members free or concessionary entry.\n\nLearn more about where you can explore with your membership.\n\nIf you’re visiting a reciprocal organisation, it’s recommended that you bring both members’ membership cards if you have a joint or family membership. Without both cards you may either be charged or refused entry.\n\nI am visiting from the USA – can I become a member?\n\nWe encourage Americans to purchase a membership through the National Trust for Scotland Foundation USA.\n\nAn NTSUSA membership provides all the same benefits of joining in Scotland, and it is tax-deductible. In addition, you will be able to continue your connection to Scotland once you return to the US, with invitations to special lectures and events.\n\nI have a disability – does the Trust offer Essential Companion cards?\n\nEveryone is welcome at Trust places. We know that many historic places and the countryside can present difficulties for people with accessibility requirements. We’re constantly reviewing our facilities to ensure that all our visitors can enjoy them. We recommend contacting the place you’re planning to visit in advance for detailed access arrangements.\n\nVisitors with accessibility requirements are not charged a different admission price and any necessary companion(s) is admitted free. We offer Essential Companion cards for our members, making it simpler for a carer or companion to gain free entry. You can request these by getting in touch with us via our Contact Us page. The card is in the name of the member with accessibility requirements, allowing them to choose who they bring. We will offer multiple cards if more than one carer or companion is required. We welcome all assistance dogs.\n\nWe have an ongoing programme of accessible content development. Detailed accessibility guides for the most visited Trust places are available on our Accessibility pages as well as links to useful resources.\n\nWe’d love you to visit the Euan’s Guide website to review the accessibility of Trust places and tell us (and others) what’s good and where we need to do better.\n\nCan I use my Young Scot card at National Trust for Scotland places?\n\nYes, you can! Holders of a valid Young Scot card can visit our places for just £1. Please see the terms and conditions for more details.\n\nPlease note that this offer is not valid for school group visits. Please see our Learning pages for more information on school visits.\n\nDo you have electric vehicle charging points?\n\nFour of our places currently have electric vehicle charging points:\n\n1 at Robert Burns Birthplace Museum with two charge points\n\n2 at Culzean (each with two charge points)\n\n1 at Brodie Castle with two charge points\n\n1 at Culloden with two charge points\n\nCan I bring my dog?\n\nDogs are part of the family and we know many people like to bring them on a day out. We love to have dogs at our places – we do ask that they’re kept under proper control, and that their owners clean up after them.\n\nThere are some areas where dogs can’t go (unless they’re assistance dogs) including buildings that are open to the public, walled gardens, most cafés and restaurants, and shops. Please check with staff if you’re unsure. Dogs (including assistance dogs) are not allowed on St Kilda.\n\nOut in the countryside where there is livestock, dogs must be kept on a short lead or under close control to keep everyone safe. For more information please visit the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.\n\nCan I hold my wedding, party or corporate event at a Trust place?\n\nYes! The Trust hosts hundreds of events every year, from small, intimate weddings and parties to half-marathons with hundreds of participants. If you’re interested in using a Trust location as a venue, contact the property manager early in the planning process, to discuss details and to help your event run smoothly.\n\nIf you’re planning an indoor event, our historic buildings are a great choice – you can find out more on our Venue Hire pages. Our teams will work with you to create your perfect event, and guide you through any considerations of using a historic location.\n\nIf you’re planning an outdoor event at a Trust place, or a large-scale event that passes through Trust land, please contact the relevant Trust place as soon as possible.\n\nFor outdoor events, we need to know: how many people would be attending; whether the relevant licences have been secured from the local authority; whether you plan to put up any temporary structures (parking, signs, toilets, etc); and information about your health and safety provision and insurance cover. Once we have this information, we’ll be able to decide whether we can host your event and whether there’ll be a charge.\n\nAs an apolitical charity, we do not permit any political events, whatever their purpose.\n\nVisiting our places\n\nCan I take pictures?\n\nYou can take as many pictures as you like, for personal purposes, out in the grounds at all our places. Don’t forget to share them with us on social media and tag the featured place and the National Trust for Scotland #ForTheLoveofScotland!\n\nIf you want to fly a drone at any of our sites, you’ll need to contact the Filming Manager, even for our countryside places (see question below for more details). We only allow drone operators with appropriate public liability insurance in place, so please make sure you have that before getting in touch. Please be aware that there are restrictions on drone use at different times of year at some places because of the wildlife that lives and breeds there. Please follow any onsite signs or advice from Trust volunteers and staff relating to restrictions.\n\nWe’re also pleased to say that you can take pictures inside these places: Alloa Tower, Bachelors’ Club, The Battle of Bannockburn, Barry Mill, Broughton House, Canna, Culzean Castle, Drum Castle, the Georgian House, Glencoe, the Hill House, Hill of Tarvit Mansion, Holmwood, House of Dun (except Aberdeen Art Gallery loans), Hugh Miller’s Birthplace Cottage & Museum (except Miller House Museum), Inverewe, Mar Lodge Estate, Moirlanich Longhouse, Robert Smail’s Printing Works, Souter Johnnie’s Cottage, the Tenement House and Weaver’s Cottage.\n\nDue to loan conditions or security considerations, internal photography at other places is only allowed if the property manager agrees. To keep our collections safe, we never allow tripods, selfie sticks or flash photography.\n\nCommercial photographers should contact the Trust’s Filming Manager to arrange visits on filming@nts.org.uk. For more information, see our Filming pages.\n\nCan I buy images from the Trust?\n\nWe have had to suspend our sale of images at the moment.\n\nCan I fly a drone at Trust places?\n\nBefore flying drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles), you’ll need permission from the Filming Manager. We also ask that you have public liability insurance of at least £2 million in place and have obtained a Flyer ID and Operator ID from the Civil Aviation Authority. All drones should be marked with your Operator ID. For commercial operators, drone usage must be carried out by a pilot accredited by the Civil Aviation Authority.\n\nThe Trust welcomes drone usage on its properties but there may be areas and times where drones are not allowed, for example: during events, close to protected buildings or during wildlife breeding seasons. These rules are in place to keep wildlife and our buildings safe, and to create an enjoyable visitor experience for everyone.\n\nIf you’re planning to bring your drone to a Trust place, you must make sure that you follow any advice about areas where you cannot fly. You must also agree to follow all legal requirements for flying a drone and abide by the Drone and Model Aircraft Code 2019.\n\nTo apply to fly a drone on a Trust property, please contact the Trust’s Filming Manager by emailing filming@nts.org.uk, who will respond within a week.\n\nPlease also read our Policy on the use of small unmanned aircraft (drones) at Trust places.\n\nCan I use a metal detector on your land?\n\nWe only allow metal detecting when the activity is part of a programme agreed and managed by our Archaeology team. We do run regular events involving the public in digs and other research work.\n\nI’m hoping to see a specific item or display – will it be on loan?\n\nThe Trust does loan items to other exhibitions or venues from time to time. When we do, we try our best to do this when most of our places are closed. If you’re planning a visit to see a specific item, we suggest contacting the place you’re going to visit to check if it’s being loaned out from its usual home.\n\nIs there anything I need to bear in mind when visiting the countryside?\n\nOver a million people visit our countryside places each year, whether it involves bagging a Munro or taking the family for a walk in our beautiful woodlands and parklands. Many of our places have waymarked walks, orientation panels and trail leaflets to help you enjoy your visit, plus viewing hides to allow you to get closer to wildlife.\n\nWe aim to provide a safe and healthy environment for visitors to our places. At all our sites, the responsibility for the safety of visitors should be seen as one that is shared between the National Trust for Scotland and the visitor. We aim to minimise risks in ways that are compatible with our conservation objectives.\n\nYou can help by:\n\nObserving all notices and signs during your visit.\n\nFollowing any instructions and advice given by our staff.\n\nEnsuring that children are properly supervised at all times.\n\nKeeping dogs on a lead or under close control.\n\nWearing appropriate clothing and footwear (this includes wearing insect repellent and covering skin in areas prone to midges and ticks).\n\nTaking great care to minimise the risk of starting wildfires.\n\nI would like to make a complaint.\n\nIf you have a complaint, please see our complaints policy. We’re sorry that you’ve had a bad experience and we’ll make sure your complaint gets to the right people, quickly."
