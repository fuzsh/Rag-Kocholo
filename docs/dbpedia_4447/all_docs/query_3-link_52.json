        "text": "WELCOME TO\n\nTHE SCOTTISH AERO CLUB\n\nScotland's Oldest and Largest Aero Club\n\nFlying in the Heart of Scotland\n\nThe Scottish Aero Club is a vibrant and active club based at Perth Airport and is Scotland’s original and largest flying club.\n\nThe amalgamation of The Scottish Flying Club, founded in 1927, which was based in Renfrew and The Strathtay Aero Club, founded in 1936, which was based at Perth, the two clubs merged in 1956 to form The Scottish Aero Club. Over the years, the Club has gone from strength to strength.\n\nPerth Airport is centrally located between Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow and has three runways; two tarmac and one grass. Consequently, there are very few times when wind direction prevents flying. The airport also features an operational tower, modern clubrooms, an onsite lodge and a cafe.\n\nThe location of the airport means it is the perfect location for flying around and exploring Scotland – one of the most spectacular countries in the world to fly!\n\nDiscover more about the Club, opportunities to learn to fly, aircraft hire and flying into Perth within these pages.\n\nHappy Flying!\n\nSAC Ladies Day 14th September 2024\n\nIn conjunction with our training partner, Alba Airsports, we are delighted to announce the SAC 2024 Ladies Day on 14th September 2024.\n\nFor further details, please click on the link below to go to our Events page.\n\nRescheduled SAC Annual Fly-In 20th & 21st September\n\nThe Annual Fly-In will now be held on the weekend of 20th & 21st September following the disappointment of the cancellation of our August date. This will also coincide with the AST Open Day and the arrival in Perth of the Goodwood Spitfire!\n\nFor further details, please click on the link below to go to our Events page.\n\n* Non-Flying Visitors to the Scottish Aero Club\n\nThe Scottish Aero Club is an organisation set up and operated for its members and is a private flying club.\n\nWe are delighted when non-members visit us and wish to tour the hangar and our facilities. However, when visitors arrive unannounced, this is, unfortunately, not always possible.\n\nWe recommend, therefore, that anyone wishing to visit the Club contact us beforehand to arrange a visit by telephoning on 01738 550055 or by email at office@scottishaeroclub.org.uk."
