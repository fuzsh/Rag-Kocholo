        "text": "Scapa Flow\n\nIn the early hours of 14 October 1939, the German submarine U-47, commanded by Lt Gunther Prien, slipped between the blockships of Kirk Sound and sank HMS Royal Oak, at anchor in Scapa Flow. This image, taken almost a year later, on 8 October 1940, shows the location of several elements in the Orkney defences developed after that episode: two anti-aircraft batteries west of St Mary's and a military camp to the east, coastal defence gun batteries on Burray and Lamb Holm and the extended chain of blockships in Kirk and Holm Sounds.\n\nHillington\n\nDefended by three barrage balloons (annotated 'a'), this image shows the Rolls Royce aero-engine factory at Hillington on 23 March 1941. This factory manufactured engines for Spitfire fighters, among other types, and was vital to the British war effort. A housing scheme under construction is visible to the south of the factory and anti-glider obstacles can be seen in fields to the north.\n\nArdeer\n\nThis image of the ICI explosives works at Ardeer and the Royal Ordnance Factory at Irvine, sites which do not appear on any contemporary maps, was taken on 9 January 1941. Twelve barrage balloons are visible, protecting the sites from low-level aerial attack. Plumes of smoke can be seen, rising from the power station and chemical works at the heart of each site, blown by the north-easterly wind.\n\nRannoch\n\nVery early in the Second World War, the Luftwaffe had collected aerial photography of large tracts of the British Isles, as their reconnaissance aircraft were able to operate at heights far above the ceiling of British fighters. This image of the Rannoch hydro-electric power station was taken on 24 September 1940 and the key elements of the scheme were carefully annotated by photographic interpreters.\n\nRAF Dyce\n\nNow Aberdeen International Airport, RAF Dyce was occupied by Hawker Hurricane fighters of 145 Squadron, Royal Air Force, when this image was taken on 21 September 1940. A number of aircraft can be seen on the eastern side of the airfield, where a civilian airport was first established in 1934 (numbered '10' on the image). In the north-western corner of the airfield, neat rows of bell-tents (numbered '8') are situated adjacent to the foundations of more permanent accommodation buildings, under construction.\n\nLater in the Second World War, Dyce was home to 8 Operational Training Unit, which trained crews for photographic reconnaissance work. The station remained in RAF use until 1957.\n\nRAF Drem\n\nThree grass runways are visible in this image of RAF Drem, taken on 22 July 1940. Used intermittently from 1916 to 1939, Drem served as a fighter and night-fighter station during the Second World War before closing in 1946. The thoroughness of much German photographic interpretation work is illustrated by this image, where each aircraft dispersal pen and four defensive pillboxes are noted.\n\nRAF Skeabrae\n\nThough appearing to be under construction when this image was taken, on 2 May 1941, Skeabrae was opened to aircraft in October 1940. It exhibits contrasting tactical awareness in that blister hangars for aircraft are well dispersed around the site in groups of three, to reduce the risk of destruction from enemy attack, while the accommodation and technical buildings are grouped tightly together on the western perimeter.\n\nThe only RAF station in Orkney, Skeabrae was reduced to Care and Maintenance status after the Second World War and closed in 1957.\n\nAberdeen\n\nDuring the Second World War, Aberdeen was a vital harbour for warships operating in the North Sea, as well as merchant ships moving around the coastline of the UK. It was also the location for important shipbuilding and repair facilities, which have been identified and annotated on this image from 14 September 1940. German photographic interpreters made one error, however; whilst they identified a gun battery on the coastline to the east, they did not recognize that the adjacent Torry fort housed an additional two guns."
