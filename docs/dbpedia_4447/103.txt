Scotland's natural beauty is known around the world but one chartered flight company is offering people the chance to see it from a different point of view.

Hebridean Air Services operate flights between Oban and the Hebrides, offering a lifeline services to islanders. They also help certain island children get to and from school, if it is a tricky land and sea commute.

As well as these routes, they also charter flights for customers who wish to see Scotland's breathtaking landscapes from the air. Most of their flights run to and from Oban, heading to Mull, Jura, and Islay, as well as the smaller islands of Tiree, Coll, and Colonsay.

Other routes include flying between Lewis and Benbecula, which sees the plane cruise over Harris and North Uist as well as dozens of tiny, uninhabited islands. Their account on X, formerly Twitter, is a treasure trove of stunning snaps, providing a bird's eye view of hills, beaches, lochs, and villages.

Martin McWilliam previously told the Record: "It’s fair to say that the weather on the inner Hebrides can vary quite a lot throughout the year and no two days are the same. We operate in a part of Scotland that on a good day has scenery second to none and I would hope that the pictures we post show this.

"Our pilot, Yak, takes the pictures as he flies between the Islands and he is always bragging that very few people have a view from their office like he has – can’t really disagree with him."
