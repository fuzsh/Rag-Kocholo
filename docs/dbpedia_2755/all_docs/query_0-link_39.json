The show is about a group of goats living on the Green Green Grassland and a clumsy wolf who wants to eat them.\n\nThe cartoon became enormously popular with Chinese schoolchildren after its debut in 2005. Cashing in on the cartoon's success, the producer made an animated feature film in 2009. It generated a box office revenue of 79 million yuan (approx. US $11.5 million) during Chinese New Year that year. It is aired on over 40 local TV stations, including Zhejiang Television, CCTV and Aniworld Satellite Television, Hong Kong's TVB and Taiwan's Momo Kids. The show was also aired in India, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia and North America. As of 2011, an English dub has been aired in Taiwan. In 2010, Disney gained the license to broadcast the show on their Disney Channels.[1] Alpha terminated the contract with Disney before the expiration date in September 2016 at the expense of US$2 million, thus Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf has had nothing to do with Disney since then.\n\nToon Express Group, a subsidiary of Alpha Animation and a Creative Power Entertaining's sister company,[2] owns the copyrights to the characters.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf had 510 episodes when it premiered (2005–2007). After it became moderately successful, Creative Power Entertaining created more than 2,000 episodes, including 60 exclusive Olympics episodes in 2008 and an addition of 20 more episodes to the first season in 2009.\n\nIn January 2009, its first movie Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf – The Super Adventure was launched in China. Based on the 530-episode television series, The Super Adventure stars the same characters but in a very different scenario with the goats joining forces with their old nemesis, Wolffy, to defeat their common archenemy – bacteria.[4] It broke the domestic box office record for a Chinese animated film, collecting 30 million yuan (US$4.39 million) during its opening weekend. On the first day of release alone, the movie made 8 million yuan. According to Beijing News, the weekend's revenue was well ahead of the previous record holder for domestic animation, Storm Rider Clash of the Evils – the adaptation of the Storm Riders comic brought in 25 million Yuan in two weeks when it was released the previous summer.[5]\n\nDescribing the Pleasant Goat movie as a \"dark horse\", Zhao Jun, general manager of China Film South Cinema Circuit Co. Ltd., predicted the film would make at least 60 million yuan in total box office revenue. A manager of the Beijing-based Stellar International Cineplex said the movie theatre's biggest hall, which had been scheduled to screen Red Cliff II, was reassigned to show Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Super Adventure in order to meet popular demand.[6]\n\nIn 2010, a second movie, Desert Trek: The Adventure of the Lost Totem, was released. One of the original tracks in the movie, \"Left hands and Right hands\" (Chinese: 左手右手), was sung by Yang Peiyi, who had previously sung at the 2008 Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony.\n\nIn 2010, Creative Power Entertaining Corporation (CPE) said that it had reached a television license broadcast agreement with Disney affiliate Buena Vista to air its products. With this deal, the popular Chinese cartoon show for children will be aired on Disney channels in 52 countries and regions and in more than 10 different languages, marking a milestone for China's animation industry.[1]\n\nThe third movie, Moon Castle: The Space Adventure was launched in 2011. The fourth movie Mission Incredible: Adventures on the Dragon's Trail followed in 2012.[7] The fourth film reached the highest box office of the film series at 167.619 million yuan.[8]\n\nThe fifth film, in 2013, was The Mythical Ark: Adventures in Love & Happiness, the sixth film in 2014 Meet the Pegasus, and the seventh film in 2015 Amazing Pleasant Goat.[9] All seven movies are themed on the Chinese zodiac of the year in which it was released, and incorporate the zodiac animal in their Chinese names; the animals, sequentially, are the ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, and goat. In addition, all movies were released in the month of January, around Chinese New Year. With the box office revenue of each film decreasing and Amazing Pleasant Goat only reaching 67.815 million yuan, CPE decided to slow down the yearly release. The ninth film, titled Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf 3D Movie, is expected to release in 2023.\n\nTwo live-action animated films of the series, titled I Love Wolffy and I Love Wolffy 2 respectively, were also released but neither reached a box office of 80 million yuan. A third live-action animated film is not planned.\n\nInvestment banker Francis Leung, who planned to buy Toon Express Group, expressed the potential to make Pleasant Goat a television show that would, as stated by The Wall Street Journal, \"parallel the popularity of Mickey Mouse and Hello Kitty\".[10]\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the year 3010 on the fictional Goat Calendar, the ancestor of the goat clan, Ruan Mianmian (or Old Mandy), arrives at Green Green Grassland to escape the wolves. The goats built a tall iron gate outside their village and called it 'Goat Village'. This leaves the wolves to try and break in any way they can. One day, a wolf suggests that they exercise until they are thin enough to squeeze through the bars. With this strategy, the wolf ancestor, Wu Dalang (Fitter), manages to get through, only to die after swallowing a huge rock covered in wool, mistaking it for a big sheep. After this incident, the wolves learned not to make the goats of Green Green Grassland angry, for there will be consequences.\n\n503 years later in the year 3513, the descendant of Wu Dalang, Wolffy, moves to the opposite of the river separating the forest and the Goat Village with his wife Wolnie. Wolffy demonstrates poor hunting ability and is scorned, being regarded as not a proper wolf. They move there in hope of finding a way to eat the goats, as tales told by ancestors say that the goats there are the best and tastiest.\n\nThe goats live in the Green Green Grassland happily. The main characters are depicted as school-aged goats that attend school under the tutelage of Slowy, the village elder. Weslie and his friends are portrayed as playful primary school kids, each of whom has his/her own unique characteristic. Tibbie is a fashionable young female goat who is always worrying about her looks and esteem. Sparky is a young male goat who likes to work out; he has a crush on Tibbie. Paddi is a cute male goat who likes to relax. Paddi is one of the most popular characters in the series. There are many other young, anonymous goats, as well as their teacher Slowy, an old goat referred to as the \"Village Chief\", who is a scientist and develops machines to protect their school. He is slower than a snail and uses a walking stick.\n\nWolffy and Wolnie live in a castle far from the village and are constantly trying to hunt the goats for food. However, the goats in this time are intelligent and powered with technology. Each episode, Wolffy concocts a plan to catch the goats. Among the goat students, a smart male goat named Weslie always finds a way to ruin Wolffy's plans and save the goats. With the effort of Weslie and his friends, Wolffy never captures any goats. At the end of each episode, Wolffy always promises to come back, each time shouting his catchphrase: 'Darn goats! I will definitely come back again!'\n\nThe conflict between Wolffy and Weslie never ends. Although Wolffy fails all the time, he never gives up. While he is mean to the goats, he is a nice and timid husband to Wolnie and a great dad to his son, Wilie. Wolnie is somewhat impatient and enjoys making her husband do all the work. She rarely tries to catch the goats herself (failing every time as well), but always yells at her husband. She likes fashion, is fixated on eating goats, and loves to hit Wolffy with her frying pan. Despite this fact, deep down Wolnie still loves her husband.[11]\n\nCharacters\n\n[edit]\n\nGoats\n\n[edit]\n\nHappy[12] or Weslie[13] (喜羊羊; Xǐ Yángyáng; 'Happy Sheep')\n\nVoiced by: Zu Liqing [zh]\n\nWeslie is the main character of the series. He is a school-aged goat living in the Goat Village of Green Green Grassland and the son of singer Li Yangyang (丽羊羊). He wears a blue ribbon around his neck with a bell, which is a present from his parents. Weslie is an archetypal hero character; he is positive, intelligent, and always supportive of his friends. He takes a leadership role in his class and among his peers and is Slowy's assistant. Weslie is observant and intelligent, and in general, is the often the first to detect danger and see through Wolffy's plots and traps. He also seems to be quite calm and forgiving, as he forgives Wolffy and his family at the end of the first movie for betraying them by sending them a trap-gift. He loves to play pranks, much to his friends' agitation. He also enjoys being treated with offers by Tibbie. He and Wolffy become friends in the \"Mighty Little Defenders\".\n\nSlowy[12] (慢羊羊; Màn Yángyáng; 'Slow Sheep')\n\nVoiced by: Gao Quansheng\n\nSlowy is an adult goat that serves as a village elder. His name is pun on \"slow and steady\", implying that while slow, he also harbors a steady wisdom. He functions as the only adult figure in the story, and not only serving as the head of the lamb village, but also as the schoolmaster. He often uses trickery to teach his students valuable lessons about life, and often sends them on assignments. There is a small plant on top of his head that grows whenever he thinks. Outside of the school yard, he is shown as a goat of many pursuits, creating wacky inventions and performing questionable experiments with humorous results. In addition, when he thinks too hard, his head will begin to grow leaves.\n\nHis character design is partially inspired by Albert Einstein, with wild frizzy hair, a mustache, and a pair of spectacles.\n\nLazy,[12] Lance or Paddi (懒羊羊; Lǎn Yángyáng; 'Lazy Sheep')\n\nVoiced by: Liang Ying\n\nA small, gluttonous goat wearing a yellow drool bib. He hates working and likes to sleep, but due to his lazy nature, he is often the first caught by Wolffy. He is also very greedy and is often either sleeping or eating. Paddi is one of the most intelligent of all of the goats, although this is concealed by his laziness. He also has a habit of falling asleep whenever Wolffy kidnaps the goats. He is sometimes a bit selfish. He has been revealed to hold a varying number of hidden talents throughout the show, such as diving. Wolffy's son, Wilie, has an attachment to him, and will often address him as \"Brother Paddi\". Originally, Paddi was intended to be the main protagonist of the show, but due to 'Lazy' having a negative connotation, Weslie was made the main protagonist instead.\n\nMae, Beauty[12] or Tibbie[14] (美羊羊; Měi Yángyáng; 'Beautiful Sheep')\n\nVoiced by: Deng Yuting\n\nA female goat in Green Green Grassland, who always wears pink bows on her horns and pink shoes and a pink scarf with a white line. She is one of Slowy's students and is generally liked by all the goats in Green Green Grassland. Tibbie is shown to be the most emotional goat and often cries, needing to be calmed down by her friends. Tibbie is shown to dislike caterpillars, roaches, or bugs, but she likes applying make-up, cooking and crafting flower wreaths, attracting other animals to her beauty. Tibbie is usually gentle, kind, and sweet to her friends, but is serious when she is angry. Her best friend is Jonie and likes to do various activities with her, such as dressing up in pretty clothes.\n\nFray, Fitty[12] or Sparky (沸羊羊; Fèi Yángyáng; 'Boiling Sheep')\n\nVoiced by: Liu Hongyun, Yan Yanzi [zh]\n\nSparky is the only dark-skinned goat. He is a school-aged goat that attends the same school as Weslie. Sparky is depicted as a jock character. He is the strongest of his group and enjoys sports and showing off his strength to others. He is quick-tempered and quick to act, often charging headlong into dangerous situations. He likes to pick on Paddi, but occasionally still treats him as a friend. Sparky's best friend is Weslie and likes to help him get rid of Wolffy when he tries to attack the goats. Despite his strength, he is still physically weaker than Wolffy. He is very afraid of cockroaches.\n\nRany, Genting[12] or Jonie (暖羊羊; Nuǎn Yángyáng; 'Warm Sheep')\n\nVoiced by: Deng Yuting\n\nShe is a docile and kind female goat who is class president of Weslie's class in school. She is revealed in the Olympics special to possess mountain goat genes, effectively making her the strongest goat in Goat Village above Sparky. She is the most sensible goat, but can sometimes be talkative. She is friends with Jay, and best friends with Tibbie. Like Tibbie, Jonie is usually gentle and kind. She tends to scold the boy goats (Weslie, Sparky, and Paddi) but still hangs out and cares for them. She has a small pink heart-shaped satchel that she wears as well as a matching ribbon and red shoes. She has a purple pet owl called 'Nuan-Nuan' (warm-warm).\n\nStacy (花羊羊; Huā Yángyáng; 'Flower Goat')\n\nVoiced by: Yan Yanzi\n\nShe was Slowy's first love when they were young. In one episode, the goats bring Stacy to Goat Village through the time machine Slowy invented. She paints her horns pink and wears pretty pink petaled flowers (with yellow smiley faces in the middle) on them. She wears a purple purse, pink shoes, and a pink choker. She has short ponytails with bells on them. As an adult, she had pretty bangs. Tibbie became slightly jealous of her because she was more beautiful when she was in Goat Village. She is gentle and sweet, with a soft voice and a beautiful tone. She is also mentioned by Slowy in the sixth movie.\n\nHan (韩羊羊; Hān Yángyáng; 'Han Goat')\n\nHan is Weslie's younger brother. He got 100 points in the exam, he is the village chief's assistant, and as smart as Weslie.\n\nRunning\n\nRunning Sheep is the leader of the sheep tribe. He is not only handsome in appearance, but also has various magical abilities.\n\nOld Mandy (软绵绵; Ruǎnmiánmián; 'Soft Goat')\n\nHe is the first village chief of the Goat Village and the ancestor of the Sheep Clan. Slowy, Xiyu Daoyang, etc. are all Ruan Mianmian's apprentices and are the great heroes among the sheep.\n\nSmarc (智羊羊; Zhiyangyang; 'Smart Goat')\n\nThe father of Weslie, the husband of Lily, and the adoptive father of Bingbingyang, the greatest scientist in the universe, wearing a magnifying glass in his left eye, an aviation expert of the Sheep Clan, and has developed a variety of fighter jets, bombers, and missiles for the Sheep Clan. He also created the Candy Kingdom. He first appeared in Pleasant Goat and Big Big Wolf: The Year of the Rabbit, and fell into the dragon world due to a malfunction of the space-time accelerator.\n\nLily (丽羊羊; Lìyángyáng)\n\nWeslie's mother and Smarc's husband. Before joining Smarc on the space mission, she was a well-known singer. She normally wears a sparkling blue dress, and also wears bells (identical to the one that Weslie wears on his neck) as earrings.\n\nWolves\n\n[edit]\n\nWolffy[12] (Chinese: 灰太狼; pinyin: Huī Tàiláng; lit. 'Grey Wolf')\n\nVoiced by: Zhang Lin\n\nWolffy is the main antagonist of the series. Like the Goats, his name is a literal pun, as \"太狼\" or 太郎 is a common Japanese given name meaning \"first son\", with \"Grey\" being his family name. Wolffy is the 250th generation grandson of Wu Dalang, the ancestor of the wolf clan, and the king of the wolves of the Green Green Grassland. He is very smart but conceited, claiming that he is the greatest inventor in the Green Green Grassland. He wears an orange cap with a yellow patch and has a scar under his eye. Wolffy is a middle-aged, hen-pecked husband who lives with his demanding wife, Wolnie, in a castle on the outskirts of Goat Village in Green Green Grassland. Wolffy is usually motivated solely by fear of his wife, and he is constantly under her demand to bring home goats for food. He is a good cook and always makes delicious dishes for his family.\n\nA rather bumbling character, he always concocts elaborate plans and creates fanciful traps to catch the goats, with limited success. He usually ends up being outwitted by the goats, and is often unable to find loopholes in his overly complex plans. His failures to obtain food are met by angry scoldings from his wife and slapstick violence, such as being hit over the head with a frying pan. Even so, his love for Wolnie never wavers. Since he is always unable to catch any goats, his wolf identity (like a nationality, which provides social security and medical benefits[15]) has been revoked many times by the wolf pack.\n\nWolffy himself lacked any real desire to catch the goats at first, and only did so in an attempt to appease and impress his wife. He will readily abandon his hunt should some other means appear that will likely impress his wife more. His catchphrase (which he utters in one form or another each episode) is \"Darn goat! I'll definitely come back/ I'll come back for sure/ I'll be back/ I'll get my revenge!\" (mostly \"I'll be back\" in later seasons, which is based on The Terminator). He always catches frogs or makes salad for meals as he cannot catch any goats. He and Happy (Weslie) become friends in the \"Mighty Little Defenders\". In China, sometimes he is seen as a respectable cartoon character by older generations because of his faithfulness to his wife and persistence on catching goats despite repeated failure.[citation needed]\n\nIn one episode, Wolffy invites his uncle to stay, but he fears losing face in front of him because of Wolnie's violence. He convinces his wife to pretend to be submissive while the uncle was there. However, at the end of the episode when the uncle leaves, Wolnie gives him a good thrashing \"to compensate for all the time she missed out on hitting him\".\n\nWolnie[12] (Chinese: 红太狼; pinyin: Hóng Tàiláng; lit. 'Red Wolf')\n\nVoiced by: Zhao Na\n\nThe narcissistic wife of Wolffy, who dresses in a red robe with black and white trims. She wears red lipstick, make-up, and two hoops on her feet. She is overly-demanding and abusive towards her husband, hitting him with her frying pan whenever his schemes fail. However, she still genuinely love him and deeply cares for his safety. Additionally, she is shown to be intelligent; while her husband can think of outlandish inventions to catch goats, her simple ideas are the ones that are actually successful.\n\nHowie or Wilie[16] (Chinese: 小灰灰; pinyin: Xiǎo Huīhuī; lit. 'Little Grey')\n\nVoiced by: Liang Ying\n\nHe is the son of Wolffy and Wolnie. He is a cute pup with big eyes. He is approximately 2–6 years old in human years. He is a crybaby, but is very innocent. He likes to go out hunting with his father but gets lost most of the time. He plays a large role in the first four movie, The Super Adventure, Desert Trek: The Adventure of the Lost Totem, Moon Castle: The Space Adventure, and Mission Incredible: Adventures on the Dragon's Trail.\n\nHe also forms a mostly one-sided friendship with Paddi, and affectionately calls him \"Brother Paddi\". Their relationship is highlighted in the second and fifth movie. He has an attachment to Paddi, but he also likes the other goats, addressing Weslie as \"Brother Weslie\", Tibbie as \"Sister Tibbie\", and so on.\n\nAfter he is expelled from the wolf school, his father reluctantly enrolls him in the goat school, where he becomes friends with all the other goats, occasionally aiding them in their struggle against Wolffy.\n\nHuang Tailang (Chinese: 黄太狼; pinyin: Huáng Tàiláng; lit. 'Yellow Wolf')\n\nVoiced by: Zhang Lin\n\nWolffy's grandfather. Like his grandson, he is often abused by his wife (usually via getting things thrown at his head).\n\nHei Tailang (Chinese: 黑太狼; pinyin: Hēi Tàiláng; lit. 'Black Wolf')\n\nWolffy's Father. He was the previous villain of Goat Village before the goats found a way to hex him with a cursed invention, resulting in his falling into a burning fire and meeting his end, but in rescue across time, his death was different.\n\nJay (Chinese: 蕉太狼; pinyin: Jiāo Tàiláng; lit. 'Banana Wolf')\n\nVoiced by: Liu Hongyun\n\nHe is a large, mild-mannered wolf who is a vegetarian obsessed with bananas. He befriends Jonie, who likes to provide him with bananas. He was forced to marry Fragrant Wolf, but after he realizes Fragrant was as cruel as Wolnie when they were at the Central Carnival Park, he decided not to and fled from his wedding saying, \"I DON'T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" (Even Wolffy warned him not to marry Fragrant because he got married the exact same way with his wife as Banana almost married Fragrant.) He is the nephew of Wolffy.\n\nXiang Tailang (Chinese: 香太狼; pinyin: Xiāng Tàiláng; lit. 'Fragrant Wolf')\n\nVoiced by: Deng Yuting\n\nXiang Tailang is the cousin of Wolnie. She is a young female wolf with rainbow hoop earrings and a pink dress. She has a crush on Jay, and almost marries him, but ends up marrying Ye Tailang (Wolffy's cousin) at her wedding, who was secretly in love with her. Her name is likely a reference to Xiang Fei, a favored concubine of the Qianlong Emperor. Her weapon tends to be two irons. She is very cruel, much like her cousin Wolnie.\n\nWu Dalang (Chinese: 武大狼; pinyin: Wǔ Dàláng; lit. 'Martial Wolf')\n\nThe ancestor of the wolf clan and the archrival of Old Mandy, the ancestor of the goat clan. In episode 499, it was revealed that he was the one who gave Wolffy his scar during a time traveling shenanigan.\n\nOthers\n\n[edit]\n\nCrazy Brother or Jolly (Chinese: 潇洒哥; pinyin: Xiāosǎ Gē; lit. 'Cool Bro')\n\nVoiced by: Zu Liqing\n\nJolly is an egg with a face. He has a carefree and easygoing personality but is not always intelligent. An occult enthusiast and a joker, his catch phrase is \"I'll put a curse on you!\" while drawing circles into the ground with a stick. (Once, the drawn circle lit up and granted him powers to shoot laser beams out of his hands.) He enjoys teasing Paddi's pet by saying: \"you unfinished egg!\" Jolly also has many costumes that he changes into in special occasions. He and his brother, Darky, can merge and become an ultimate powerful egg. (When this happens, the resulting combination looks like Jolly but with a red cape and a red underwear on his head.)\n\nBlack Commander, Darky or Darton (Chinese: 黑大帅; pinyin: Hēi Dàshuài)\n\nVoiced by: Gao Quansheng\n\nJolly's, black-egg younger brother. Has lightning powers and was evil for some time and was a team with Wolffy.\n\nNote that both Darten and Jolly are their names from the lost Disney, Britanic English dub from \"Great War in the Bizarre World\". (Chinese: 古古怪界大作战; pinyin: Gǔ gǔguài jiè dà zuòzhàn; lit. 'Battle in the Wonderland') A story arc consisting of 60 episodes, episodes 281 to 340 out of the 530 of the original donghua.\n\nBig Humphrey (Chinese: 包包大人; pinyin: Bāobāo Dàrén)\n\nVoiced by: Gao Quansheng\n\nAn elephant that serves as the mayor and chief of justice of Green Green Grassland, which encompasses the Goat Village and the Wolf Castle as well as all the other places of residence in Green Green Grassland. His character is a parody of Bao Zheng, a Chinese figure revered for his fairness and judicial judgment in court.\n\nTiger (Chinese: 泰哥; pinyin: Tài Gē; lit. 'Ti Bro')\n\nVoiced by: Gao Quansheng\n\nSo far the only tiger in the series, Tiger is strong, well-muscled, and loves to show off his muscles. His Chinese name is a play on the English word Tiger. It also sounds similar to the Chinese rendering of boxer Mike Tyson.\n\nFlat-beak Allen (Chinese: 扁嘴伦; pinyin: Biǎn Zuǐlún; lit. 'Flat-mouth Lun')\n\nA rather narcissistic duck.
