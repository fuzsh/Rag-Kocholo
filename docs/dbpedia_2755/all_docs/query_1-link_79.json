        "text": "In case you want an introduction for Batman: The Animated Series, click here. Want to follow along in timeline or production order? Click here.\n\nAs we move into 1993, we get some of the series’ best episodes as well as some insight into the beginning of Robin’s career. I don’t really have anything clever to say, so let’s get right on with it and close out February 2019 with a bang!\n\nFor those following along with the timeline order, all of the episodes of the series proper have now been placed so you should be able to keep up without a hitch. Be warned, there are general SPOILERS for the series and Batman media below.\n\nRobin’s Reckoning Part 1\n\nDirector: Dick Sebast Writer: Randy Rogel\n\nProd. Number: 032 Airdate: 02/07/93 DCAU Date: 01/08/93 [Present Day] 07/15/84-07/20/84 [Flashback]\n\nSummary:When Robin finds out Batman is preventing him from going after the man who killed his parents, he threatens to go rogue in his anger.\n\nReview:“Robin’s Reckoning” is one of the most acclaimed episodes in the series to the point it even won an Emmy. However, I’ve always appreciated its genius at an arm’s length. The script doesn’t have that much going on while the flashbacks are more or less a conventional Robin origin story. What’s always set it apart though is the beautiful animation by Spectrum under Dick Sebast’s wonderful direction. The artfully done death of the Flying Graysons is a series high point and enough to earn this episode masterpiece status. (★★★★★)\n\nChronological Placement: This is next up in production order after “The Cape and Cowl Conspiracy.” The whole two-parter takes place over one night. Robin mentions “homework” so it would need to take place at the earliest on this January weekend in 1993, because school wouldn’t be in session on New Year’s and he probably stays in on most weeknights.\n\nThe number of days the episodes’ flashback takes over is approximate. The year Dick was orphaned is 1984 based on Zucco saying in Part II how he’s been waiting 9 years to get Batman off his back. This jibes with Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm having Bruce become Batman in 1983 and the real world creation of Robin in 1940 nearly a year after Batman’s creation in 1939.\n\nNote that Alfred’s hair has already turned white since the Phantasm flashbacks while Jim Gordon’s hair is still brownish-red. Other nice continuity touches are Batman’s costume being the same as his original costume in the comics, Arnold Stromwell being the biggest mob boss in Gotham as established in “It’s Never Too Late,” and the Robin Hood mural in Dick’s bedroom at Wayne Manor.\n\nFrom a meta-textual perspective, this is also the first adaptation of Robin’s origin on film. There was previously a radio adaptation in the 1940s where his parents were secret agents assassinated by Nazis that was never picked up.\n\nRobin’s Reckoning Part 2\n\nDirector: Dick Sebast Writer: Randy Rogel\n\nProd. Number: 037 Airdate: 02/07/93 DCAU Date: 01/09/93 [Present Day] 07/22/84 [Flashback]\n\nSummary: As Batman and Robin separately close in on Tony Zucco, Robin thinks back to how he almost caught his parents’ killers\n\nReview: While this second part retains the splendid animation, direction, and voice acting of the first, it is not as strong as its predecessor mainly due to all the time spent with Tony Zucco. He must be one of the most ineffectual and annoying villains in the whole series. True, it’s thematically interesting to make the man who orphaned Robin’s parents some stupid punk who cut his parents’ rope as a cheap intimidation tactic. However, that means we’re stuck watching 40 minutes of this idiot who in no way justifies the assertions that he successfully eluded the Dynamic Duo for 9 years or that Batman was afraid that Zucco was more likely to kill Robin, a professional superhero, than Joker or any number of his rogues gallery.\n\nBack To The Future’s Thomas F. Wilson played Zucco as an imitation of John Travolta’s Danny Zuko in Grease, which makes him sound even stupider. I’ve always preferred The Batman’s Robin origin to this episode in part because Mark Hamill made their Zucco more of a credible threat. But I suppose “Robin’s Reckoning” is quite good otherwise. (★★★★1/2)\n\nChronological Placement: The present day aspect of this episode takes place over one night and ends here at sunrise. This places this episode in the early morning. The flashback scenes take place an estimated two days after the last episode’s flashbacks to give some time for Bruce and Dick to be closer as shown here.\n\nNow, some might wonder why I’ve chosen June 15thas the date of the Graysons’ murder. Wait, they’re not? Well, whatever. Here’s my rationale.\n\nMy first instinct is to match the Post-Crisis On Infinite Earths date of Halloween for their murder as that was canon in the comics while the show was in production. However, this was only canonical Post-Crisis in relation to Dick having a birthday in late October the week before his parents’ death. However, the credits in these episodes identify Dick as being 10 (Part 1) or 9 (Part 2) when this happened. Dick would have to be turning 11 at the youngest in 1984 to be at least 18 when he starts college in 1991, meaning he can’t just have turned 10.\n\nTherefore, Dick must have had his 10th birthday months earlier in 1983 and be 10 going on 11 in the flashbacks for this timeline to make internal sense. Luckily, this matches with the Pre-Crisis dates of June 15th being the death of the Graysons and November 11th being Dick Grayson’s birthday, so we’ll set those as canonical here unless any new info shows up.\n\nFor more fun DC Comics dates, check out this link.\n\nTony Zucco is 26 in the flashbacks and 35 in 1993, per the computer data showed in Part 1 if anyone cares. I don’t.\n\nThe Laughing Fish\n\nDirector: Bruce Timm Writer: Paul Dini\n\nProd. Number: 033 Airdate: 01/10/93 DCAU Date: 01/11/93-01/12/93\n\nSummary: The Joker poisons all of the fish in Gotham’s waters so that he can get a copyright on all fish products. When the patent office says he can’t, Batman must stop him from bumping off their employees.\n\nReview: What might have been an unremarkable episode becomes the Joker’s signature appearance made by the definitive Timm/Dini team. Adapted from Engelhart and Rogers’ “The Laughing Fish” with a shark-fueled climax out of O’Neil and Adams’ “The Joker’s Five-Way Revenge,” this exemplifies what makes the Joker so scary. Whether it’s the GCPD, the patent office, your TV, or your own home, he will destroy every institution and sacred place that allows society to securely operate. His hilarious jokes often skewer ideas such as the nuclear family that Batman and the audience idealize, a topsy-turvy rejection of conventional thinking. Unlike most comedians who stop at that, the Joker’s punchlines are always murder as the sanctity of human life is the one taboo he hates the most.\n\nBesides boasting terrific direction by Timm including a traveling POV shot, this episode is also in my opinion the definitive appearance of Harley Quinn. Not defined solely by her sex appeal, she’s allowed to be funny and fight back against the Joker while still being completely in his thrall. My favorite Harley Quinn moment ever is when Joker tells her she can be his little mermaid. She gets excited until he slips a giant fish costume on her top half. Her black eyes narrow in the darkness as Arleen Sorkin deadpans “You’re really sick, you know that, boss.”\n\nPerfection. (★★★★★)\n\nChronological Placement: It’s next in production order and there’s a reference to Gotham’s “cold waters,” making a January placement reasonable. There’s some rain, but it rains sometimes in January. The entire episode takes place across a day and a half.\n\nMore interestingly, this is the first chronological appearance of Harley Quinn. While she was created for the episode “Joker’s Favor” which was also her first appearance in airdate order, I feel you might have read my small essay on why that episode is placed 26 episodes after its production number on the timeline.\n\nBecause of that, we’ll just focus on the in-episode clues that this is Harley’s first appearance. The title card-less beginning reveals the Joker’s been on the loose for a while as Batman’s been waiting for him to make his move. While unusual in that he usually breaks out for directly stated reasons, this jibes with “Mad Love” telling us Harley Quinn broke him out in her first outing with no reason other than to get him free. Note that Joker also has to introduce her at the patent office as no one seems particularly frightened of her. She also seems to be stressed out by his criminal shenanigans and her hatred of fish, suggesting she’s relatively new to this.\n\nWhatever order you’re watching, this episode also marks the first time Joker seemingly died at the end of an adventure. Here, he’s almost eaten by a shark.\n\nNight Of The Ninja\n\nDirector: Kevin Altieri Writer: Steve Perry\n\nProd. Number: 034 Airdate: 10/26/92 DCAU Date: 06/23/93-06/26/93 [Episode] 05/09/82-06/09/82 [Flashback]\n\nSummary: Batman discovers that a ninja robbing Wayne Enterprises is a rival from his training days in Japan. Will he be unable to defeat him as he was unable to then?\n\nReview: This episode sees the debut of one of the few original villains to make multiple appearances in the series. Kyodai Ken isn’t the deepest character, but he does put Batman into an unusually vulnerable spot. Batman likes to refer to Bruce Wayne as if he was a different person who died when he was 8, but people like Kyodai Ken who knew him before the cowl know the truth. The Dark Knight is an identity Bruce had to construct and Kyodai Ken’s emasculation of him threatens to destroy it.\n\nThis episode gives us some good insight into the fragility of his identity as Dick Grayson and Alfred speculate about what’s eating at their isolated house mate. Robin in particular uses some dumb slang that punctures the pomp of the episode. He also helps distract Summer Gleeson so Batman can shift from fighting as Bruce Wayne to fighting as Batman. That shift in fighting style and identity as Batman re-asserts his true self is fascinating.\n\nThis is as good a time as any to discuss Summer Gleeson. Appearing in 20 episodes and both movies, Gleeson’s spunky presence was a welcome source of exposition. This episode is probably her shining hour as she takes a page out of the Lois Lane playbook to discover more about Bruce Wayne.\n\nThe obvious question about her existence is why the creators didn’t go with Vicki Vale, whom she greatly resembles. It’s likely that the creators knew that having Vicki Vale would distract from Catwoman as Batman’s main love interest in the first season so they ignored her. The fact Batman Returns did the same probably supports that theory. (★★★★1/2)\n\nChronological Placement: I was all set to place this episode in production order in January 1993 when I notice the calendar in Summer Gleeson’s office is opened to June. Sigh. Guess I don’t need any disclaimers about the weather since this is firmly placed in June 1993.\n\nThe episode is four days long so moving the airdate back syncs the party at the climax up with a Saturday so that works. The summer date explains why Robin is present all four days as he would have just wrapped up his sophomore year at Gotham State.\n\nThe flashbacks are a little trickier. I concur with Watchtower Database that Batman trained in Japan between 1981 to 1983. I’ll ignore the fifteen years reference in the comics because I’ll write a post soon about how counting those as automatically canon is ridiculous. Because of Mask Of The Phantasm being set in 1983 and the flashbacks in “Zatanna” being 1981 at the earliest, I’ll set Bruce’s Japan training in 1982.\n\nAs for the arbitrary dates, that required true detective work. The episode tells us Kyodai Ken has been robbing Wayne companies for two weeks. Since he seems like the kind of guy who invests his action with meaning, he likely chose the anniversary of Wayne getting him kicked out of the dojo as the commencement of his crimes. This indicates June 9th, 1982 was when their last confrontation happens. The two-day period remembered earlier in the episode will be placed a month earlier because why not? I’m not sure how long Bruce trained in Japan.\n\nOne last note: I like to think Wayne Cosmetics was a purchased and rebranded Daggett Cosmetics from “Feat Of Clay.” Of course, that might also have sat abandoned until “Batgirl Returns.”\n\nCat Scratch Fever\n\nDirector: Boyd Kirkland Writer: Buzz Dixon (Teleplay) Sean Catherine Derek (Story)\n\nProd. Number: 035 Airdate: 11/05/92 DCAU Date: 01/25/93-01/26/93\n\nSummary: Free to walk the streets, Catwoman goes looking for her missing cat. She uncovers a plot to infect Gotham’s streets with a plague through stray animals. Batman stops it after fighting a basset hound.\n\nReview: An episode so bad that it got both Sean Catherine Derek and animation studio AKOM fired off the show. Seriously, the scenes of Catwoman dancing here are sub-Goddess of Spring levels of rubber-arm floppiness. Storywise, this is the episode where Catwoman’s looking for her cat and Batman fights a dog. That’s it, really.\n\nAt the risk of going more in-depth, this episode exemplifies how this show did wrong by Catwoman. At the beginning of the episode, she is sentenced only to probation as she is hailed as a hero by Gotham City. Doing this takes all the bite out of the idea that Batman can’t be with her because she’s a criminal. They appear to occupy the same moral status as well-intentioned vigilantes here. The show tries to replace this with the “Lois Lane loves Superman, not Clark Kent” angle with her preferring Batman to Bruce Wayne, but that’s somehow lamer here than it was there. She spends the rest of the episode looking for her cat, falling into trash cans, and letting Batman fight all her battles for her. Shame that Adrienne Barbeau’s voice acting and a good costume design are wasted on these terrible stories.\n\nHonestly, the snow and the Batman/Catwoman flirtation are all that stops me from giving this episode a half star. Batman at least fought the Penguin at the end of “I’ve Got Batman In My Basement,” not a basset hound. (★)\n\nChronological Placement: Since “Night of the Ninja” takes place in June, this is next up in Production Order. The fact this is one of the few episodes in the series where it snows supports a January placement. The writing and backgrounds are sloppy in this episode so the amount of days it takes is being estimated at two. Airdate is used as an approximate guide even though there doesn’t seem to have been heavy snowfall or a blizzard in the New York City area in 1993.\n\nThe sentencing scenes might strike readers of my ramblings as strange due to it being placed six months after “The Cat And The Claw.” Normally, when an episode ends with a character in a jail cell in their debut appearance a la “Pretty Poison” or “Heart Of Ice”, I’ve placed it as one month after their debut. However, characters such as Poison Ivy and Mr. Freeze would not only be considered insane, but actively dangerous. Selina Kyle is neither of those things so perhaps her case took the normal route through the courts while those others were expedited as special cases. Or maybe those flashbacks do take place 4-6 months after the bulk of those episodes. Whichever explanation floats your boat.\n\nThe Strange Secret Of Bruce Wayne\n\nDirector: Frank Paur Writer: Judith & Garfield Reeves-Stevens (Teleplay) David Wise (Story)\n\nProd. Number: 036 Airdate: 10/29/92 DCAU Date: 01/21/93 [Prologue] 01/29/93 [Episode]\n\nSummary: Dr. Hugo Strange discovers that Bruce Wayne is secretly Batman. Hoping to make a quick profit, he invites The Joker, The Penguin, and Two-Face to bid on his terrible knowledge.\n\nReview: This episode breaks my heart. When I was a kid, this was one of my favorites: a flashback to Batman’s origin, psychological trauma, a Golden Age villain, and a team-up of Batman villains completewith solid Joker jokes. As an adult however, I can now understand why this episode doesn’t have a high reputation among fans. The story has huge leaps in logic such as: a machine that can read thoughts, Strange putting together the auction in a day, the villains walking around in bright daylight, and Dick pretending to be Bruce. Add in cheesy one-liners and really bad animation from AKOM and you get an episode that I’m still giving 4 out of 5 stars out of nostalgia. (★★★★)\n\nChronological Placement: This episode is next up in the production order and takes place presumably on a Friday as Bruce Wayne is heading in for a weekend retreat and Dick Grayson only tags along at the very end. The first scene I set about a week earlier on Friday, seeing as Robin again pops up out of nowhere as opposed to their partnered weekend patrols. The winter date isn’t insurmountable as most of the episode takes place at a tropical Roland Daggett-owned vacation resort that you need to apparently fly from Gotham City to get to. The Joker himself says “Arkham is nice this time of year,” presumably because it’s preferable to the cold.\n\nNormally, I would be opposed to placing five episodes in one month such as I have in January 1993 but “Robin’s Reckoning” is a two-parter that explicitly takes place over one night. That means that Batman still only had four exceptional adventures this month so it isn’t too implausible.\n\nBack for the episode, this marks the first time multiple villains have gotten together since we saw most of them in Arkham Asylum in “Fear Of Victory” and the first time they’ve fought Batman together. It makes sense that Hugo Strange would contact Joker first as he has not only fought Batman at least seven times before this, but was still on the loose after faking his death at the end of “The Laughing Fish.” The arrest of Harley Quinn in that episode explains her absence.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Joker brought Penguin and Two-Face along or if Strange contacted them separately. Both of them have only been the main villain of one episode by this point, but it’s likely that the flashbacks of them fighting Batman in “Almost Got ‘Em” have already occurred. They would need to in order to make them elder statesmen of the Rogues Gallery that they are seen as here. Because of this, we can conclude that Penguin has fought Batman at least three times before this and Two-Face two (dun dun) times.\n\nHeart Of Steel Part 1\n\nDirector: Kevin Altieri Writer: Brynne Stephens\n\nProd. Number: 038 Airdate: 11/16/92 DCAU Date: 02/12/93-02/14/93\n\nSummary: After a robot suitcase breaks into his company, Bruce Wayne must visit Karl Rossum to learn about his mysterious computer HARDAC.\n\nReview: This episode feels like an episode of Batman ’66 where Marilyn Monroe guest starred and all the jokes were played so straight they weren’t funny. I know I can sometimes go on and on about these episodes, but I’m writing this an hour after rewatching it and already I’m struggling to retain my memory of it. Shout-outs to Transformers, R.U.R., Blade Runner, and more are cool and all, but I don’t think HARDAC really feels like much of a Batman villain. All I remember is the silly stuff. Batman spending five minutes fighting a suitcase. Bruce Wayne dating a robot. Batman trapped in the Batcave. All very dull. Also, it has weirdly dirty animation with a lot of dust on certain shots in the official restored version.\n\nThe once and future Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, makes her first appearance though so that’s nice. Let’s acknowledge that it’s uncomfortable that her first scene has Bruce making a comment about how she’s grown while she’s holding a teddy bear, in light of their later romantic relationship. Ew. (★★)\n\nChronological Placement: This episode takes place over three days. As noted above, this episode is the first appearance of Barbara Gordon. When she comes to visit on the second day, Gordon mentions “she made dean’s list,” which suggests at least a small amount of time has passed since a semester ended at her school. Her saying her father’s hands are like ice as if he’d been outside support the naturally occurring winter date of placing it in production order.\n\nThe fact that Barbara’s staying for a couple days suggests that she’s come home for President’s Day Weekend, which was February 15th in 1993. That just happens to be close enough to the approximate airdate to work.\n\nHeart Of Steel Part 2\n\nDirector: Kevin Altieri Writer: Brynne Stephens\n\nProd. Number: 044 Airdate: 11/17/92 DCAU Date: 02/15/93\n\nSummary: When Commissioner Gordon, Mayor Hill, and other prominent Gothamites are replaced by HARDAC’s robots, Barbara Gordon must team up with Batman to save her father.\n\nReview: Now this episode is more like it! A giant computer still isn’t really the ideal Batman villain but fighting robots allows for some extreme deaths.\n\nThe censors would allow the creative teams to kill robots in a way they couldn’t real people so the writers and storyboard artists really went to town on them. They drop a ton of elevators on them, throw Harvey Bullock into the Bat-Signal, blow Commisoner Gordon up with a grenade, etc. We even follow one elevator falling down story after story in a stunningly edited and animated sequence.\n\nBarbara gets a much better showcase here as she proves her mettle on her first case with the Dark Knight, predictably faring better on her first case than Dick did in “Robin’s Reckoning.” No wonder she would become Batman’s most trusted ally in The New Batman Adventures. (★★★★)\n\nChronological Placement: This episode directly follows Part 1 and takes place all day on Presidents’ Day 1993. See the above entry for that reasoning. A major event here is the original Bat-Signal from “The Cape And The Cowl Conspiracy” is destroyed.\n\nBarbara goes back to her university this year, but transfers to Gotham University presumably over the summer before her next appearance in “I Am The Night.”\n\nIf You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Rich?\n\nDirector: Eric Radomski Writer: David Wise\n\nProd. Number: 039 Airdate: 11/18/92 DCAU Date: 02/18/91 (Prologue) 02/21/93 (Episode) 06/18/93 (Epilogue)\n\nSummary: As Wayne Enterprises prepares to absorb an unethical video game company, Batman and Robin must save its owner from his former employee, Edward Nigma aka The Riddler.\n\nReview: The Riddler is one of the most beloved villains from the 1960s show, no doubt. However, much like Catwoman and Penguin, he has had trouble finding a place in Batman’s now darker mythos. While those two have been able to get gritty with it, the Riddler remains a foe based on puns, puzzles, and non-lethal death traps.\n\nBecause of this and the difficulty of coming up with good riddles, the creative team on this show rarely used him. However, their version is perhaps the most faithful to the comics of them all. Smallville’s John Glover brings a cool, detached air to his performance while the character often appears on giant view-screens and in shadows. This makes him seem like a distant god of logic.\n\nThe episode itself feels like an old Bill Finger and Dick Sprang comic centered around a giant prop. That is, with added hokey jokes and outdated references to video games. The animation can get a little strange-looking at times here as well. Despite it all, I love how Batman and Robin try to show each other up here and the little scary story tag with the corrupt CEO at the end. This is series co-creator Eric Radomski’s first episode as director, so we can thank him for playing up the creepy atmosphere.\n\nI am also duty-bound to tell you that the word ”SEX” is explicitly spelled out in the amusement park when Batman & Robin get there. (★★★★★)\n\nChronological Placement: This episode directly follows “Heart Of Steel” in both production order and airdate order so luckily no contradictions prevent that from being the case here. However, since we used President’s Day Weekend on “Heart Of Steel,” Robin’s presence on the weeknight of Bruce Wayne’s work-day must mean it’s the following Friday, the 21st, at the earliest.\n\nThe episode takes place over the course of one day. The prologue is said to take place two years prior so the date is just a rough estimate as the anniversary of Nygma’s firing isn’t mentioned in the episode.\n\nRiddler is one of the few Batman villains to not be caught by Batman after his first appearance. The tag shows that he’s been lying low for months, so June seems an happy median between February and his second appearance in October. Robin would be out of school then so the day of the week doesn’t really matter there.\n\nJoker’s Wild\n\nDirector: Boyd Kirkland Writer: Paul Dini\n\nProd. Number: 040 Airdate: 11/19/92 DCAU Date: 02/28/93 -02/29/93\n\nSummary: When a millionaire uses The Joker’s image to theme a casino, The Joker breaks out to wreak vengeance on it. Little does he suspect he’s being used.\n\nReview: This Dini-penned Joker episode begins with him whistling “Merry Go-Round Broke Down” and ends with him watching Bugs Bunny cartoons. In between, there’s even more Looney Tunes references as Joker is at his most Bugs Bunny-esque here. Much like how Bugs would destroy opera singers and prospectors who crossed him, Joker sees a casino based on him and is compelled to destroy it. It is his brand after all.\n\nThe difference here is that Joker is supposed to be an arch-villain. Oliver Sava in his A.V. Club reviews of the show points out that so much of the evil seems to stem from the upper classes. While Batman’s parents were upper-class socialites murdered by a lower-class mugger, his Rogues Gallery seems to exist solely as lower-class scientists and crooks victimized through the indifferent cruelty of the upper-class. The Joker gets a taste of this in this episode thanks to Cameron Kaiser, played by Clash Of The Titans star Harry Hamlin. He also gets some excellent sparring matches in with Poison Ivy and Bruce Wayne. The latter is a comic highlight in their relationship on this show.\n\nIf there is a flaw here besides AKOM’s mediocre animation, it’s that The Joker coming off as heroic or sympathetic in this somewhat ruins the mystique of the character. Besides, the premise is rather outlandish. Who could imagine someone in 2019 taking a serial killer and selling him as a hunky heartthrob movie star or releasing a whimsical movie about a mass-murder on the 50th anniversary of the mass-murder? It’s absurd. (★★★★1/2)\n\nChronological Placement: The episode largely takes place on the opening night of the casino, so presumably a Friday. The fact that Joker is watching Looney Tunes aka “Saturday Morning Cartoons” the morning afterwards supports this. A February date seems weird considering the greenery around the asylum, but see the entry on “Tyger, Tyger” for why that doesn’t matter.\n\nJoker himself is in Arkham after the events of “The Strange Secret Of Bruce Wayne.” Harley is acknowledged but does not appear in this episode as she is presumably still working her way through the justice system after her first arrest in “The Laughing Fish.” Poison Ivy, Scarecrow, and the Mad Hatter make their first appearances since “Fear Of Victory,” “Dreams In Darkness,” and “Perchance To Dream” respectively. Our first confirmation that Hatter did go to Arkham Asylum is this episode. This episode also mentions Dr. Bartholomew after he first appeared in “Dreams In Darkness.”\n\nIn Kaiser’s scrapbook, we not only see confirmation of the Jack Napier alias and Harley Quinn’s existence but also three headlines: “Joker Robs US Mint,” “Joker Declares War On Dragon Gang,” and “Batman Tops Joker.” Since previous episodes and “Mad Love” indicate there’s been at least three times he’s fought Batman, these headlines might refer to one to three of those incidents. There is also a replica Jokermobile, though whether that was made for the casino or if the Joker ever had a Jokermobile is anyone’s guess.\n\nOne last note: the woman on Bruce’s arm at the opening appears to be the same woman who throws a drink in his face in Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm.\n\nTHIS WEEK’S TIMELINE\n\nThe timeline this week is rather straightforward. Again, we’re only listing episodes by when their main events take place and not by flashbacks or prologues/epilogues.\n\nRobin’s Reckoning Part 1\n\nRobin’s Reckoning Part 2\n\nThe Laughing Fish\n\nCat Scratch Fever\n\nThe Strange Secret Of Bruce Wayne\n\nHeart Of Steel Part 1\n\nHeart Of Steel Part 2\n\nIf You’re So Smart, Why Aren’t You Rich?\n\nJoker’s Wild\n\nNight Of The Ninja\n\nCheck out the main timeline to see where they all fit. We’ll be pacing ourselves a bit more to get through the rest of the series, so next week expect only five episode reviews. But they’re all incredibly complicated so that’s fun!"
