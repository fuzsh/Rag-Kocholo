Chill, relaxed.\n\nDecides to retire after a good run of reliable leaking. Reddit threads salute her for her service.\n\nZippo starts talking shit. Calls her names or something.\n\nMidori comes out of retirement, starts leaking everything she knows. Feral. Unhinged.\n\nFlip 2 and 3 and you basically have it. We don't know what happened between her retirement and her coming back with sources at multiple new companies but yeah\n\nIs there any more context to this? Did Midori have to correct some info shared, or something else?\n\nNate literally just got through saying a couple pages ago that people were getting upset at all the leaks, and then she tweeted that.\n\nSimilar to when @Derachi made a thread about his theory that she might be part of a viral marketing stunt by Sega and she relatively quickly tweeted that she doesn't work for Sega. She's possibly watching what's being said about her in forums and responding on twitter.\n\nD36\n\nI stand proud, because I can cook!\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,564\n\nAm I allowed to say that I love that we have a girl leaker?

How does that affect NDAs, I have no idea lol. The only people that have mentioned switch 2 are kickstarters because why not, but will any company say \"this game is coming to the successor\"? Yeah, someone will, and my bet is on ubisoft\n\nSuperfirebros447\n\nCappy\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nLuckyNumber69\n\n6.9 out of 10\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,569\n\nThis whole thing of leaking supposed codenames for games is legit one of the stupidest things I've ever seen from a leaker/insider/whatever lol. It's so useless. Like, if it was just one or two codenames, it wouldn't be that bad, but this account just continues to do it over and over one after the other. How would they even have knowledge of all of these codenames anyway?\n\njoveroy\n\nMoblin\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,571\n\nMidori said the game is related to the recent rumors, so a 2D Zelda starring Zelda as the main protagonist is coming.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,572\n\nLmao she’s still going with the codenames.\n\nEdward and Anna lololl\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,573\n\nMidori said the game is related to the recent rumors, so a 2D Zelda starring Zelda as the main protagonist is coming.\n\nWhere did the 2D game come from?\n\nRaccoon\n\nFox Brigade\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,574\n\nall of these codenames are clearly bullshit\n\nAPileofBananas\n\nMoblin\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,576\n\nShe seems to think it is Zelda related due to the name being similar to Link's Awakening's codename \"Richard\". Though that was named after the character named Richard in the game (who is originally form For Whom the Frog Bell Tolls). I don't see there being any connection between Richard and Edward unless I am forgetting about something.\n\nMight be best to assume that this is an assumption on her part unless she provides additional information.\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,577\n\nMidori back at it again\n\nWe're getting that Nintendo-developed AAA Fullmetal Alchemist game holy fuck\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,579\n\nMidori back at it again\n\nCurious that she thinks it's connected to Zelda. I don't think this is really an obvious fit for the series. Most games have used spins on playing cards (usually King, also Jack, Joker, Queen), though there's also a fair amount of outliers like Triforce Heroes=Alice, SSHD=Shoebill, LA remake=Richard. So there's not really a hard-and-fast rule we could apply to try and pin down what this could be\n\nLike most of Midori's codename leaks, not really sure this is useful for much besides potentially being able to look back and go \"oh yeah, turns out she was right\" at some future point\n\nHockeyBird\n\nPokémon Trainer\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,581\n\nMakes sense. If you run into a guy dressed up as Link at your local renaissance fair, what's his name most likely to be? That's right. Edward.\n\nMy apologies to all the Edwards out there for revealing your secrets.\n\nSiG\n\nChain Chomp\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,583\n\nWhy is there so much drama around leakers?\n\nI have a feeling Nintendo has a pretty tight lockdown on their future projects. I'm not sure these codenames are necessarily for their big projects.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,584\n\nSo because Richard was Links Awakening we assume Edward is a new 2D Zelda?\n\nHocot8\n\nBounty Hunter\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,585\n\nbut like...how does she have this info? I feel like this would be risky to the source, no?\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,586\n\nI remember in one of the recent company leaks a spreadsheet with project codenames. I wonder if she managed to get that from Nintendo?\n\ngoldrogerii\n\nTektite\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,587\n\nbut like...how does she have this info? I feel like this would be risky to the source, no?\n\nProbably not since codenames don't really tell you much about the project.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,588\n\nElsa= Nintendo Switch Sports\n\nAnna= ???\n\nRichard= Links Awakening\n\nEdward= ???\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,589\n\nThis feels like a reach unless I'm missing something obvious. LA remake was codenamed Richard because of the character in the game; is there another Zelda game with an Edward, or some reason to think of \"Edward\" as being connected to \"Richard\" (I get what she's going for with the Anna/Elsa angle on Switch Sports, but can't think of a famous Richard/Edward pairing)\n\nHocot8\n\nBounty Hunter\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,591\n\nProbably not since codenames don't really tell you much about the project.\n\nThat doesn't really address my confusion about where this info comes from.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,592\n\nShe’s not totally correct with her theory\n\n• Ocarina of Time 3D - Queen\n\n• A Link Between Worlds - Jack\n\n• Majora's Mask 3D - Joker\n\n• Breath of the Wild - U-King\n\n• Link's Awakening (Switch) - Richard\n\nJack was a Link Between Worlds and other names are used for 3D games too. This mainly just confirms a Zelda game- not that it’s 2D.\n\nBullwine85\n\nMoblin\n\nPronouns\n\nHe/Him\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,594\n\nAs much as I'm loving Midori's unhinged arc, there is a part of me worrying that she may be flying a bit too close to the sun.\n\nDark Cloud\n\nWarpstar Knight\n\nMay 30, 2024\n\n#7,595\n\nAs much as I'm loving Midori's unhinged arc, there is a part of me worrying that she may be flying a bit too close to the sun.\n\nWell that’ll be her problem.
