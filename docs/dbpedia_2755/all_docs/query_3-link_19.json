        "text": "Post by Hugh Beaumont on\n\nI thought I'd make the thread generic, since there's so many of them, these days. Less clutter. Anyway, Iron Man or, namely, Tony Stark:\n\nLooking great, I'd say. And here (supposedly) is the new, second costume. (There's a first costume - a much more primitive silver one that Downey is making in the first pic. Stark later upgrades to the following suit.)\n\nAn excellent likeness. Perfection. I feel really good about this movie. Hopefully, the story won't suck.\n\nPost by mightyjack on\n\nIron Man was my hero when I was a kid, I have every comic book from the original run and a lot of the early Tales Of Suspense as well. I'm as happy as a little girl to see those pics and can hardly wait for the release (Please don't suck, please, please)\n\nI LOVE super hero flicks. I love 'em more than comic books these days (Which I don't buy ro read anymore -sad-)\n\nPost by Torgo on\n\nIronicly enough, the guy directing Iron Man has history with Marvel comic movies. Not as a director, Jon Favreau played Foggy Nelson in Daredevil.\n\nI loves me a superhero movie. There's just something about a guy running around in tights, kicking everybody's ass that is timeless. You name a movie, I probably own it. I have all the Marvel films (yes, even Man-Thing...I never watched it, but I own it. Even though it sucked, I'm probably going to pick up Ghost Rider as well), all the Batmans, all the Supermans, all the Ninja Turtles, Hellboy, the Mask, Mystery Men, and Constantine. I also have a fair few non-comic book superhero films as well, such as the Matrix trilogy, the Incredibles, and RoboCop.\n\nEver since I first saw that animated series, Spider-Man's been my favorite (though in retrospect, Batman's animated series was superior). Batman in close second. Third is and always will be the Tick, who sadly doesn't have his own movie (but he deserves one. And they better not screw it up when that day comes), but I own the near complete first season of the animated series on DVD as well as the live action series.\n\nI'm a bit less warm to non-hero comic book movies, though. I loved Road to Perdition and American Splendor, but I loathed Sin City. Didn't care for V for Vendeta either. I think I'm going to skip 300. However, Spider-Man 3 I'm going to see opening day, the same with the Dark Knight next year.\n\nPost by Don Quixote on\n\nThis will be awesome. As long as it isn't like that crappy direct-to-video version of Iron Man.\n\nI really hope Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer will be better than the first one. I liked the first one, but it lacked a lot of the depth that I felt it could've had.\n\nPost by Hugh Beaumont on\n\nOne caveat about Silver Surfer: Galactus is going to be represented by a large cloud. Now, I guess a giant, planet-sized guy in purple armor would look kind of silly on the big screen, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Still, a cloud? That kind of deflates the coolness factor a bit.\n\nTorgo, about The Tick, I kind of hope that he never gets a movie. I just don't see it being handled well. I mean, the live-action series was okay, but it was a huge downgrade from the quality of the animated series. I'd hate to see what a Hollywood movie studio and director would do to it, even if Ben Edlund kept watch over the project.\n\nThanks for posting those pics, Ratso. I had seen the movie pic of the original suit, but I never saved it. Incidentally, I hear that Stan Winston is handling the Iron Man suits, so it's no wonder that they look pretty decent."
