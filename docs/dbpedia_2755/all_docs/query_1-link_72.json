        "text": "MUNCIE — It was a bittersweet Tuesday for several former employees of Joker's Wild, as the south-side topless bar was leveled to make way for a new fast food restaurant development.\n\nAbout one dozen people, including the former owner and a handful of those who worked for him, were on site to watch the property on the southeast corner of Madison and 15th streets be demolished. A Burger King will be built on the property and is expected to open by the end of summer.\n\nIn addition to the onlookers associated with Joker's Wild, franchisees from Burger King were on hand for the demolition, which began around 6:45 a.m.\n\nThe building was where former owner Jim Harty spent nearly 30 years of his life working, but he said he thinks it was the right time for some changes.\n\n\"It's really a bittersweet day; the old building needed to come down,\" Harty said. \"It's going to be a good thing for the south side of Muncie.\"\n\nHe said there's a good chance his bar was the last of its kind in the city, given both a lack of demand for the establishments and ordinances that state such venues must be at least 500 feet away from a school and 1,000 feet away from a place of worship.\n\n\"The bar business isn't what it used to be. ... It's hard to make a dollar and it was time to get out,\" he said. \"I had a great 29 years in the business. It was time for something different to come in here.\"\n\nHarty said most all the memorabilia — including the dancer pole — was removed, with much of it going to a soon-to-open south-side country bar or to former employees.\n\nA few former dancers who attended the demolition said the tear down of the building was like losing a member of their family.\n\nSharon Miller, who identified herself as a former dancer and employee for Joker's Wild, said it took an emotional toll when she first caught a glimpse of parts of the building coming down.\n\n\"I cried when I first got here and ... and (saw) it coming down,\" Miller, who worked at the club for at least nine years, said. \"We made a family here. We stuck by each other. ... It was different for us because we all worked here and enjoyed it.\"\n\nWendi Hershey, a friend of some of the former dancers, said she thinks the club was a good place to work for those who needed to make money to support their families.\n\n\"Most people believe the bad things about strip clubs ... they aren't necessarily true,\" Hershey said. \"A lot of the girls who worked here went on to do bigger and better things. Some are modeling now. ... Some are married. It really served as a catalyst for them.\"\n\nAfter the building's final wall came tumbling down Tuesday morning, some made their way over to the rubble to pick up bricks as mementos. As she carried bricks back to her car, Miller told The Star Press the destruction she saw was heartbreaking.\n\n\"It kind of feels like home is gone,\" she said."
