        "text": "'Jag the Joker', or 'Jokers Wild', is the name typically given to a promotional game popular in many hotels and clubs throughout Queensland.\n\nThe Charitable and Non-Profit Gaming Act 1999 allows a promotional game to be conducted by a publican or a club licensee. By definition, a promotional game is a game conducted to promote goods and services.\n\nOffice of Liquor and Gaming Regulation (OLGR) Inspectors have identified the game in various forms, some of which are in breach of the Act.\n\nJag the Joker, or Jokers Wild, should generally have the following characteristics in order to meet the requirements of the Act:\n\nEntry to this type of game must be free.\n\nThe game is set up by placing 53 playing cards (including a joker), face down on a board within a glass case, or otherwise covered for security purposes.\n\nThe board is positioned on a wall visible to patrons, but unable to be accessed by the general public.\n\nThe terms and conditions of the game are displayed next to the board. These would usually indicate:\n\nthe time and place of the draw\n\nthe procedures to be followed\n\nand\n\nthe requirement that a person must be present at the draw to be eligible to win a prize.\n\nThe value of the major prize and any consolation prize should be clearly displayed. These prizes are supplied by the publican or by the club.\n\nA player enters the game by receiving a free ticket after purchasing a product. The price of the product must not exceed the usual price for which it is sold.\n\nEach week a ticket is drawn out and the holder turns over a card.\n\nIf the Joker is revealed, the person wins the major prize. If not, the person may receive a consolation prize.\n\nThe game continues with a weekly draw until the Joker is revealed.\n\nThe prize pool may increment each week, such increments being provided by the publican or the club.\n\nNote: You should seek independent legal advice if you are in doubt about the legality of any game conducted on your premises."
