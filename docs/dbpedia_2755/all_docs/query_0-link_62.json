        "text": "The Liberty logo and label graphics have changed several times over the years, mostly when ownership of the label changed hands. The original ownership of Waronker and Bennett used a drawing of the top part of the Statue of Liberty as a logo, with \"Liberty\" below it. About the time the company was sold to Avnet, the logo changed to a wide crest that incorporated the Statue of Liberty motif. When Avnet sold the company back to Bennett, the logo was changed to a box with rounded corners containing the Statue of Liberty. Finally, TransAmerica used a square-corner box with a silhouette of the Statue within.\n\nThe first Liberty label was blue-green with silver printing. \"LIBERTY\" above the center hole with a drawing of the Statue of Liberty above the logo, \"LONG PLAYING MICROGROOVE\" at the bottom of the label. The stereo issues had black labels with silver printing, with similar graphics except at the bottom of the label was \"LONG PLAYING STEREOPHONIC\" and there was a large \"STEREO\" designation under the logo. This label was used from the start of the company to the third quarter of 1960, approximately LRP- 3140/LST-7140.\n\nThe promotional issue of the monaural label was white with black printing; the graphics were the same. The promotional issue of the stereo label was light blue with black printing.\n\nSince the LRP-3000 series predated stereo by several years, at first all albums were mono. When stereo became a novelty in mid-1958, Liberty started a new series, the LST-7000 series, to issue the stereo counterparts. At first, there was no particular correspondence between mono and stereo catalog numbers for the same album; in fact, there were both mono-only and stereo-only albums being issued. After less than 30 stereo albums had been issued, Liberty simplified their catalog numbering system by making the mono and stereo numbers correspond (LRP-3086 became LST-7086, etc.). A cross-reference of stereo number to mono number is available by clicking this link.\n\nThe second Liberty label was black with silver printing. \"LIBERTY\" in white on a gold crest to the left of the center hole, the left quarter of the label being rainbow colored. Written vertically just to the right of the colored part was \"LIBERTY RECORDS, INC. LOS ANGELES 28, CALIFORNIA\". This label was used until the first quarter of 1966, approximately LRP-3415, LST-7415. At that point, Liberty changed their logo; the new logo appears on albums as early as LRP-3417/LST-7417, but some later numbers still have the old logo. Apparently, which logo was used depended upon when the artwork was done during the transition period.\n\nThe early promotional issues of the second Liberty label were white with black printing. Graphics were the same, but there is no color on the label, and the left quarter of the label, which had the rainbow color on commercial issues, was horizontally striped black and white. Later, the background color of the promotional label was changed from white to a creme color, with the same graphics. Liberty used this same promotional label for both mono and stereo promo issues even long after the regular label had changed to the rounded- box logo variation, probably due to using up the promo label stock on hand.\n\nThe third label was black with silver printing. The Liberty logo was in a white, rounded-cornered box to the left of the center hole with a drawing of the Statue of Liberty. The left quarter of the label was rainbow colored. \"LIBERTY RECORDS, INC. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA\" was written in a vertical line to the left of the center hole. Promotional issues were creme colored with black printing, the left quarter of the label being rainbow colored. This label was used to the forth quarter of 1969, approximately LST-7620.\n\nThe forth label was almost the same except that the vertical writing was dropped and at the bottom of the label was \"LIBERTY/UA INC. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA\". The logo also changed from the rounded-cornered box to a square-cornered box with a silhouette of the statue of liberty. This label was used in 1970 and 1971.\n\nWe would appreciate any additions or corrections to this discography. Just send them to us via e-mail.

Liberty made a big splash by offering over a dozen titles in stereo, and they were one of the earliest major labels to issue stereo LPs. These included several titles from their back catalog, and a few albums issued in stereo only. Earlier albums with stereo numbers, then, were either reissues of albums originally issued in mono, or delayed releases.\n\nThe following two records were apparently released in stereo only as there are no corresponding monaural release.\n\nLST-7008 - Mr. Accordion - Dom Frontiere [8/58] Flight of the Bumble Bee/Valse Brillante/Sarabande (Minuet 1 & 2)/Hora Staccato Minuet/Scherzo/To a Wild Rose/Minute Waltz/Nutcracker Suite/Op 71A\n\nLST-7018 - Swinger's Holiday - Vic Schoen Orchestra [8/58] Heartaches/My Heart Swings/Six Days Before Never/If I Love Again/Paradise/That Old Black Magic/I Fall in Love Too Easily/Autumn Leaves/Nine Penny Theme/Swingin' Holiday/I'll Always Be In Love With You/Marion\n\nLRP-3081/LST-7001 - Forbidden Island - Martin Denny [1958] Cobra/Port Au Prince/Exotica/Tiny China Doll/Bali Hai/Narcissus Queen/Sim Sim/Goony Birds/Primitiva/March Of The Siamese Children/Sukara/Forbidden Island\n\nLRP-3082 - Keyboard Magic - Ami Aloni [1958] Autumn Leaves/It's Only A Paper Moon/Summertime/Over There/Side By Side/Golden Earrings/Don't Blame Me/Blue Moon/Makin' Whoopee/Sometimes I'm Happy/Shine On Harvest Moon/Clementine\n\nLRP-3083 - Yours Forever - Billy Ward with Vic Schoen Orchestra [1958] Stardust/If You Please/Music Maestro Please/Eatin' N' Sleepin'/I'll Never Ask For More Than This/Do It Again/Deep Purple/These Foolish Things/Don't Say I Love You/Lucinda/Smoke Gets In Your Eyes/Yours Forever\n\nLRP-3084/LST-7005 - Fantastica - Russ Garcia Orchestra [1958] Into Space/Nova (Exploding Star)/Lost Souls Of Saturn/Monsters Of Jupiter/Water Creatures of Astra/Venus/Red Sands Of Mars/Goofy Peepl of Phobos/Volcanoes of Mercury/Birth Of A Planet/Frozen Neptune/Moon Rise\n\nLRP-3085/LST-7026 - Polka Festival - Bruno \"Junior\" Zielinski [1958] Originally released in mono, the stereo album was issued in 1959.

With the approach of LP number 3100, Liberty decided to make a change to a more organized mono/stereo numbering system. The monaural releases started with a 3, and the stereo releases started with a 7 followed by the same three digits. The stereo series had reached 7029 by this time, so from this point on, back catalog stereo releases for the 3030-3099 numbers also used this system when possible (e.g., LRP-3060/LST-7060.)\n\nLRP-3100/LST-7100 - Julie Is Her Name, Volume 2 - Julie London [1959] Blue Moon/What Is This Thing Called Love/How Long Has This Been Going On/Too Good To Be True/Spring Is Here/Goody Goody/One I Love Belongs To Somebody Else/If I'm Lucky/Hot Toddy/Little White Lies/I Guess I'll Have To Change My Plans/I Got Lost In His Arms\n\nLRP-3101/LST-7101 - Sophisticated Savage - Augie Colon [1959] Colon/Tierra Va Tembla/Okolehau/I'll Always Be In Love With You/El Doctor/Tabu/Tambo/Manuela Boy/Tu Has Sabido/Minahahal Sinsamba/Peanut Vendor\n\nLRP-3102/LST-7102 - Hypnotique - Martin Denny [1959] Jungle Madness/On A Little Street In Singapore/Voodoo Dreams/Chines Lullaby/Hypnotique/St. Louis Blues/We Kiss In A Shadow/Summertime/Scimitar/American In Bali/Japanese Sandman\n\nLRP-3103/LST-7103 - Sing to Me of Love - Vicki Benet [1959] Boy Next Door/How Long Has This Been Going On/Our Very Own/I Didn't Know What Time It Was/Shade Of Blue/Heartstring Melody/Love Me/More Than You Know/There's A Small Hotel/The Nearness Of You/Love Is Here To Stay/That's All\n\nLRP-3104/LST-7104 - Exotic Dreams - Ethel Azama [1959] Ringo Oiwake/Two Ladies In De Shade/Shady Lady Bird/Lazy Afternoon/Friendly Island/Green Fire/Kawohikukapulani/Speak Low/Mountain High Valley Low/Happy Talk/Nightingale/Autumn Leaves\n\nLRP-3105/LST-7105 - London by Night - Julie London [1959] Well Sir/That's For Me/Mad About The Boy/In The Middle Of A Kiss/Just the Way I Am/My Man's Gone Now/Something I Dreamed Last Night/Pousse Caf/Nobody's Heart/Exciting Life/That Old Feeling/Cloudy Morning\n\nLRP-3106/LST-7106 - Hula-La-La - Chick Floyd [1959] Samoan Knife Dance/Hula-La/O Makalapua/Farewell My Tane/There's Still A Lot Of Steam inKilauea/Pukarua/Late At Night/Tahiti Les Tropiques/Nani Waimea/Moon Of Manakoora/Aloha I Love You\n\nLRP-3107/LST-7107 - 12th Street Rag - Jad Paul [2/59] 12th Street Rag/For Me And My Gal/Melody Of Love/Under The Double Billboard March/Ballin' The Jack/Limehouse Blues/When You And I Were Young Maggie Blues/Begin The Beguine/Liebestraum For Banjos/Alabamy Bound/Diga Diga Doo/Mocking Bird\n\nLRP-3108/LST-7108 - Inferno! - John Buzon Trio [1959] Caravan/Ill Wind/Smoke Rings/Mambo Rock/Mr. Ghost Goes To Town/Moonlight/Tzena Tzena Tzena/Blues In My Heart/The Sheik Of Araby/Idaho/Diga Diga Doo/Love's Serenade\n\nLRP-3109/LST-7109 - Bongo Fever - Jack Costanzo [1959] Bongo Fever/Sweet And Lovely/Quiere/Bei Mir Bist Du Schon/Harlem Nocturne/Salta Perico/Garden Of Allah Bongo/Birk's Works (B Flat Minor Blues)/Asi Asi/La Cumparsa/Consternation/Besame Mucho\n\nLRP-3110/LST-7110 - Sondi - Sondi Sodsal [1959] Sondi/Rose Rose I Love You/Buddha Knows/China Night/Siamese Cat Song/Love Dance/Burma Trail/Buffalo Song/Bali Ha'i/Love Is A Many Spendored Thing/Song Of India/Sayonara\n\nLRP-3111/LST-7111 - Afro-Desia - Martin Denny [1959] Tsetse Fly/Ma 'Chumba/Jungle Drums/Cubano Chant/Baia/Swamp Fire//Temptation/Simba/Mumba/Aku Aku/Raftero/Siboney\n\nLRP-3112/LST-7112 - Guitars - Al Viola [1959] When You're Smiling/Moonlight In Vermont/I'll Always Be In Love With You/And The Angels Sing/You And The Night And The Music/Blue Skies/Route 66/Take Me In Your Arms/Sophisticated Lady/Always/One I Love Belongs To Somebody Else/Lover\n\nLRP-3113/LST-7113 - Pagan Love Song - Billy Ward [1959] Pagan Love Song/Moonlight And Shadows/Trade Winds/I'll Weave A Lei Of Stars/Bird Of Paradise/Hurricane//A Lei A Candle And A Prayer/Blue Hawaii/Behave Hula Girl/Magic Island/Hawaiian Wedding Song (Here Ends the Rainbow)/Aloha Oe\n\nLRP-3114/LST-7114 - Hot-Cha-Cha - Don Swan & Orchestra [1959] Ain't She Sweet/Third Man Theme/I Found A Million Dollar Baby/Ain't We Got Fun/I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me/Minka/If I Could Dream/Dream A Little Dream Of Me/Butterfly/Stardust/Where's The Melody/Laura\n\nLRP-3115/LST-7115 - Half-Time - University Brass Band with Russ Garcia [1959] Medley: California -Lights Out/Ohio State - Across the Field/Maine - Stein Song/Georgia tech - Rambling Wreck From Georgia Tech/Wisconsin - On Wisconsin/Army - Caissons Go Rolling Along/Chicago - Wave the Flay/Michigan - To the Victors/Illinois - Illinois Loyalty/S.M.U. - She'll be Comin' Round the Mountain/Northwestern - Go U.
