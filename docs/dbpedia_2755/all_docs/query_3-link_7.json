        "text": "While this is primarily a site about superhero comics, there’s nothing that says I can’t talk about adaptations of superhero comics.\n\nSo let’s do ranking of the DC movies, with a few rules.\n\nA) I will be ranking them on three criteria: how good it was as a movie, how good it was as an adaptation, and how much entertaining it was to me. Think of the latter as the “so bad it’s good” category, which is VERY useful for most of these.\n\nThe “total score” will be the some of those three, on a 0-10 scale.\n\nB) No animated movies. Mostly because I haven’t seen A LOT of those.\n\nC) None of the ones that started out as a serial and were later released as a movie. I’ve seen some of those and I don’t think they can be judged by the same criteria of a full movie.\n\nAlso, the following movies are not included in the list because I just haven’t seen them yet.\n\nSwamp Thing (1982)\n\nThe Return Of Swamp Thing (1989)\n\nJonah Hex (2010)\n\nBirds Of Prey (2020)\n\nZack Snyder’s Justice League (2021)\n\nThe Flash (2023)\n\nBlue Beetle (2023)\n\nAnd if at the end of this post you think my taste in movies is trash… why do you think I review comics instead of movies?\n\nSUPERMAN\n\nSuperman And The Mole Men (1951)\n\nYes it feels like a serial and it’s basically a backdoor pilot for the George Reeves TV series, but it WAS released as a full movie so it counts.\n\nMovie score: 3/10\n\nAdaptation score: 5/10\n\nEntertainment score: 2/10\n\nTotal score: 3.3/10\n\nYeah it’s not very good. It lacks the charm of the TV series (which is WAY better) and it’s quite boring for a long stretch of the runtime. An interesting time capsule just if you’re into the history of comics and/or of 50s cinema.\n\nSuperman (1978)\n\nWould we even HAVE superhero movies without this one?\n\nMovie score: 10/10\n\nAdaptation score: 9/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 9.6/10\n\nStill the gold standard for Superman. Doesn’t quite get the top score in everything because Lex Luthor is a terrible adaptation… but damn is this a good movie. No wonder it’s still the blueprint for Superman adaptations.\n\nAlso I consider the scene with Superman’s reaction to the death of Pa Kent to still be THE best scene in a superhero movie.\n\nSuperman II (1980)\n\nIt’s kind of weird to consider it a separate movie from the first; not only they were filmed together, they feel like a single movie.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 9/10\n\nEntertainment score: 9/10\n\nTotal score: 8.6/30\n\nSlightly better than the first movie in terms of actions, but it doesn’t hit the same emotional chords. Superman is still great, Lex still sucks, and without this movie we wouldn’t give any attention to General Zod.\n\nSuperman III (1983)\n\nI can’t think of another superhero movie more confused about what it’s supposed to be.\n\nMovie score: 1/10\n\nAdaptation score: 5/10\n\nEntertainment score: 4/10\n\nTotal score: 3.3/10\n\nThe movie that does the impossible: making Richard Pryor unfunny.\n\nThe movie grids to a halt whenever he shows up and he seems to take every possible chance to avoid provoking even the slightest chuckle. The only entertaining parts are those with Evil Superman, but even Christopher Reeves can’t save this one… it’s a boring embarrassment.\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)\n\nNow this is a FUNNY embarrassment. There’s a difference.\n\nMovie score: 3/10\n\nAdaptation score: 5/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 5.3/10\n\nWe are definitely in “so bad it’s hilarious” territory here. Sure, as a movie it’s absolute trash, but as a source of unintentional comedy? *chef’s kiss*\n\nSuperman Returns (2006)\n\nSometimes I feel like I’m the only person who liked this movie.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 9/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 9/10\n\nLex Luthor is the only blemish on the adaptation score, but Kevin Spacey’s version is WAY better than Gene Hackman. Brandon Routh is no Christopher Reeves, but I liked his interpretation.\n\nThe action is great, the plot makes WAY more sense than the first two movies… I don’t know what people were expecting.\n\nMan Of Steel (2013)\n\nI don’t think I have ever hated a movie more than this one.\n\nMovie score: 1/10\n\nAdaptation score: -10/10\n\nEntertainment score: 3/10\n\nTotal score: -2/10\n\nThis the polar opposite of what Superman stands for, and the fact that there are so-called Superman fans defending it makes me question humanity.\n\nAt least Lois Lane is pretty cool and the action is fine if you’re into destruction porn.\n\nBATMAN\n\nBatman (1966)\n\nThis one most definitely IS based on the TV show, but it was released as its own movie.\n\nMovie score: 2/10\n\nAdaptation score: 1/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 4/10\n\nI’m not the biggest fan of the TV series. In fact, I can’t stand most of it. That being said, this movie is hilarious and COMPLETELY INSANE.\n\nBatman (1989)\n\nIt’s easier to find Batman media NOT influenced by this one than the other way around.\n\nMovie score: 10/10\n\nAdaptation score: 8/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 9.3/10\n\nNo perfect score by changing the lore; I could excuse everything because it gets the vibe SO well, but making the Joker the killer of Batman’s parents is too much for me.\n\nI’m also one of the few who doesn’t really buy Michael Keaton’s interpretation of Bruce Wayne, although his Batman is great.\n\nBatman Returns (1992)\n\nYou can blame this one for the trend of adding more and more villains to the sequel.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 7/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 8.3/10\n\nWhere the first movie was “Batman with a Tim Burton touch”, this one feels like “Tim Burton with a touch of Batman”. In terms of adaptation, Batman himself is slightly closer to the comics… but Catwoman goes in a completely different direction, and I don’t know WTF he was thinking with Penguin.\n\nStill a good movie and still a blast, though.\n\nBatman Forever (1995)\n\nTalk about a wild change in direction!\n\nMovie score: 6/10\n\nAdaptation score: 4/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 6/10\n\nControversial opinion, but I think Val Kilmer plays a good Bruce Wayne. He’s just stuck in a movie that is not exactly well-written.\n\nTwo-Face and Riddler have only a surface-level resemblance to their comic book counterparts, but Jim Carrey’s enthusiasm makes it entertaining enough.\n\nBatman & Robin (1997)\n\nPut this one in ice. Forever.\n\nMovie score: 1/10\n\nAdaptation score: 0/10\n\nEntertainment score: 7/10\n\nTotal score: 2.6/10\n\nYeah I can’t defend this one. It’s not even as entertaining as the predecessor because a lot of scenes reeeeeally drag.\n\nBatman Begins (2005)\n\nThe movie that ensured Batman superfans would be even more insufferable than they already are.\n\nMovie score: 10/10\n\nAdaptation score: 10/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 9.3/10\n\nThat being said… yeah it’s a masterpiece. I’m not even detracting points for changing Ra’s Al Ghul’s origin, because technically speaking it’s STILL compatible.\n\nHowever I simply cannot take Batman seriously with that voice. Whenever he’s supposed to sound threatening, I laugh.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nAs if the Batman superfans were not ALREADY insufferable with the first one.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 10/10\n\nEntertainment score: 7/10\n\nTotal score: 8.3/10\n\nUnpopular opinion: if it wasn’t for the Joker, this would just be an okay movie. I found Batman and especially Bruce Wayne to be BY FAR the weakest part of the movie.\n\nThat being said… while the movie thinks it’s clever than it actually is, Heath Ledger and Aaron Eckhart are enough to elevate the weakest parts.\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012)\n\nIf you thought I was too harsh on The Dark Knight… I think this one genuinely sucks.\n\nMovie score: 6/10\n\nAdaptation score: 5/10\n\nEntertainment score: 3/10\n\nTotal score: 4.6/10\n\nThe only reason it’s not a trainwreck is that it’s made by a good director. But because the previous ones were good, this one gets a pass for stuff that would be mercilessly mocked everywhere else.\n\nForget Bane’s goofy voice (which is even more hilarious than Batman’s): this is a movie where the city sends THE ENTIRE POLICE DEPARTMENT into the sewers, where they stay isolated for months.\n\nThe Batman (2022)\n\nThat’s the year and not the running time. Easy mistake to make, it does feel like 20 hours and 22 minutes at times.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 7/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 7.6/10\n\nThis would be higher if it wasn’t so freaking long. Not because of the runtime, but because basically every single scene drags on 30 seconds longer than it should… and at the end you’re begging for the movie to finally end!\n\nIt might sound strange, but despite that I still think this is a good movie. Batman himself is relatively accurate (I think he does more detective work in this one than in all previous movies combined), plus the Penguin and Catwoman are great. Too bad Riddler has nothing to do with the character.\n\nBonus: not only it has the best Batmobile chase ever, it might have the best car chase scene ever.\n\nWONDER WOMAN\n\nWonder Woman (2017)\n\nThis movie has absolutely no business being this good. None whatsoever.\n\nMovie score: 9/10\n\nAdaptation score: 8/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 9/10\n\nThe “No Man’s Land” scene remains one of the top five scenes in a superhero movie. A lackluster finale, that I think isn’t even as bad as people seem to think it is, is its only blemish.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 (2020)\n\nThis movie has absolutely no business being this bad. None whatsoever.\n\nMovie score: 3/10\n\nAdaptation score: 6/10\n\nEntertainment score: 6/10\n\nTotal score: 4/10\n\nPedro Pascal’s performance is the only saving grace of this movie. Is there a cut where he’s the only character? Because I’d watch THAT movie again!\n\nAQUAMAN\n\nAquaman (2018)\n\nAnother movie that has no business being as good as it is. And it’s not even a masterpiece.\n\nMovie score: 7/10\n\nAdaptation score: 8/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 7.6/10\n\nI’m not the biggest Aquaman fan, but if you’re coming from the Peter David era of the character this doesn’t seem to be a bad adaptation.\n\nAquaman And The Lost Kingdom (2023)\n\nThe DCEU ends in a meh.\n\nMovie score: 5/10\n\nAdaptation score: 7/10\n\nEntertainment score: 6/10\n\nTotal score: 6/10\n\nThe first one was saved by a good plot, good chemistry between characters, and Jason Momoa’s charisma.\n\nThis one has a nonsense plot, zero chemistry between everyone except Patrick Wilson and Momoa, who in half of the scenes is not even trying.\n\nSHAZAM\n\nShazam! (2019)\n\nHoly Moly was this a pleasant surprise.\n\nMovie score: 9/10\n\nAdaptation score: 7/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 8.6/10\n\nThis is mostly adapting the most recent version of Shazam, of course. But having him keep the mind of Billy Batson even when he’s in Captain Marvel form is still different enough from decades of legacy that it hurts the score. But at least they give Billy a personality, something that is not always guaranteed with the character.\n\nAnd for all the jokes, I still think that the scene where Billy confronts his mother makes this movie WAY more adult that all the edgelord tryhard Snyder movies.\n\nBlack Adam (2022)\n\nThey should hold classes on how NOT to write a movie, and this one should be its main thesis.\n\nMovie score: 0/10\n\nAdaptation score: 1/10\n\nEntertainment score: 9/10\n\nTotal score: 3.3/10\n\nDoctor Fate is the only character with a slight resemblance to his comic book counterpart.\n\nThis is a really bad movie, and a really DUMB movie.\n\nYou will laugh the entire runtime at how bad and how dumb it is.\n\nShazam! Fury Of The Gods (2023)\n\nEven Shazam doesn’t seem convinced on the poster.\n\nMovie score: 7/10\n\nAdaptation score: 6/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 7/10\n\nIt doesn’t hold a candle to the original, and it retreads way too many points of the first one. Perhaps I’m too kind because I saw this one after Black Adam, but it’s passable.\n\nSOLO HEROES\n\nSupergirl (1984)\n\nForget Crisis, this is what killed Supergirl for decades.\n\nMovie score: 2/10\n\nAdaptation score: 2/10\n\nEntertainment score: 5/10\n\nTotal score: 3/10\n\nThis is a fascinating trainwreck, but a trainwreck nonetheless. There is some enjoyment from the “so bad it’s good” perspective… what else can you expect from a movie whose premise is having the heroine search for a lost artifact that could destroy her planet if she fails… and then she FORGETS ALL ABOUT IT FOR THE REST OF THE MOVIE?\n\nSteel (1997)\n\nAnother one who is not convinced on the poster. Or who can’t act.\n\nMovie score: 1/10\n\nAdaptation score: 0/10\n\nEntertainment score: 7/10\n\nTotal score: 2.6/10\n\nIt’s badly written, INCREDIBLY badly acted, and it looks like it had less of a budget than the 1940s serials. But if you’re in the right state of mind, this movie is absolutely hilarious.\n\nCatwoman (2004)\n\nIts terrrrrrible.\n\nMovie score: 0/10\n\nAdaptation score: 0/10\n\nEntertainment score: 7/10\n\nTotal score: 2.3/10\n\nIt has absolutely nothing to do with Catwoman, sure, but it’s one of the most incompetent movies you will ever see and the director had the good sense to never direct another movie after this one.\n\nStill a riot to laugh at.\n\nConstantine (2005)\n\nControversial opinion: I like this movie! If only they called it something else, instead of a title character that is completely different from the source material, it would be a classic.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 0/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 6/10\n\nI’m serious, call this one ANYTHING ELSE and it’s a very solid movie. As a Constantine adaptation, it’s absolutely dreadful.\n\nWatchmen (2009)\n\nWeird to count it as a “solo movie”, but it’s not part of a larger franchise.\n\nMovie score: 8/10\n\nAdaptation score: 7/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 8.3/10\n\nSnyder completely misreads the fact that YOU’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ROOT FOR RORSHACH, sure, and misunderstands the idea behind the violent parts of the source material.\n\nThat being said, I have to admit that he did manage to adapt a comic that was widely considered (by myself included) to be impossible to adapt.\n\nIt looks worse than it is because you’re comparing it to a masterpiece, but on it’s own it’s a good movie.\n\nGreen Lantern (2011)\n\nYou’ll believe a franchise can flop.\n\nMovie score: 4/10\n\nAdaptation score: 2/10\n\nEntertainment score: 7/10\n\nTotal score: 4.3/10\n\nThis movie wants to be Iron Man so badly it’s embarrassing. Starting the trend of DC movies trying to launch a franchise before delivering a good movie… and while some critics have perhaps been a bit too harsh, this is definitely NOT a good movie.\n\nEntertaining to make fun of? Sure.\n\nIf only they had taken their time, maaaaybe it could have worked. But it jumped the gun trying to introduce too much stuff too quickly.\n\nHey, at least Kilowog was alright.\n\nJoker (2019)\n\nWhy should Batman fans be the only ones allowed to be insufferable?\n\nMovie score: 10/10\n\nAdaptation score: 1/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 7/10\n\nIt’s overrated by people who think this is the best movie ever made. It’s under-rated by people who find those insufferable. It’s nothing really new to people who have actually seen Taxi Driver.\n\nAnd it’s terrible in so many ways as an adaptation.\n\nDespite having all of THAT against it… it’s still one hell of a movie.\n\nTEAM-UP MOVIES\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)\n\nAlso known as “Batman v Superman: nobody wins”.\n\nMovie score: 0/10\n\nAdaptation score: -5/10\n\nEntertainment score: 5/10\n\nTotal score: 0/10\n\nThis one manages to be even worse than Man Of Steel for being the opposite of what both Superman AND Batman stand for! Wonder Woman is the only SLIGHTLY redeeming quality, but even she can’t balance this one.\n\nSuicide Squad (2016)\n\nWith a title like that, you’re tempting fate.\n\nMovie score: 2/10\n\nAdaptation score: 0/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 3.3/10\n\n“Everything that could possibly go wrong in a production: The Movie”.\n\nBut as an unintentional comedy this is hilarious! I don’t mind watching this again to laugh about how incompetent it is at everything it tries to do.\n\nJustice League (2017)\n\nThe tagline “You can’t save the world alone” is missing its conclusion: “And neither can we”.\n\nMovie score: 6/10\n\nAdaptation score: 0/10\n\nEntertainment score: 8/10\n\nTotal score: 4.6/10\n\nMost of it a middle-of-the-road superhero movie that nobody would pay attention to… if it wasn’t about some of the most important superheroes ever.\n\nWonder Woman is fine, Aquaman is passable and Batman is WAY better than his previous trainwrecks. But Cyborg is left with nothing to do and the Flash… I still don’t understand what the heck were they thinking with the Flash.\n\nPlus, as much as Marvel gets criticized for having weak villains: who would pick Steppenwolf as the first JLA villain???\n\nThe Suicide Squad (2021)\n\nAlso known as “the good one”.\n\nMovie score: 10/10\n\nAdaptation score: 4/10\n\nEntertainment score: 10/10\n\nTotal score: 8/10\n\nThis is why you hire James Gunn. You might get stuff wildly different from the source material, but he’ll give you something very entertaining, very moving, and very well-directed.\n\nThis results in the following Top Threes:\n\nSUPERMAN\n\n1) Superman (1978): 9.6/10\n\n2) Superman Returns (2006): 9/10\n\n3) Superman II (1980): 8.6/10\n\nBATMAN\n\n1) tie, Batman (1989) and Batman Begins (2005): 9.3/10\n\n2) tie, Batman Returns (1992) and The Dark Knight (2008): 8.3/10\n\n3) The Batman (2022): 7.6/10\n\nSOLO HEROES\n\n1) Wonder Woman (2017): 9/10\n\n2) Shazam! (2019): 8.6/10\n\n3) Watchmen (2009): 8.3/10\n\nTEAM-UP MOVIES\n\n1) The Suicide Squad (2021): 8/10\n\n2) Justice League (2017): 4.6/10\n\n3) Suicide Squad (2016): 3.3/10\n\nAnd as a whole…\n\nALL TIME HIGH\n\n1) Superman (1978): 9.6/10\n\n2) Wonder Woman (2017): 9/10\n\n3) tie, Batman (1989) and Batman Begins (2005): 8.3/10"
