        "text": "The world is kind of a crazy place right now, on the off chance you had not noticed yet. The majority of us are stuck in our homes for our safety and that of others. For that reason, many people are turning to the cinema for a source of entertainment, distraction, and a source of hope. It serves as a reminder of how the world was before the pandemic, and what it will return to someday in the indefinite future. We can live vicariously through movies, experiencing a wide range of activities and emotions that are hindered by the pandemic. For that reason, I have decided to type up some recommendations, similar to what I did with my best of the decade list, to watch while you are stuck inside.\n\nThese are not a themed list for relatable quarantine viewing, merely some of my all-time favorite films. My top 50 to be precise. As a huge film geek, it was challenging to narrow this down to 50. But these are the films that throughout the years have been the most engaging, entertaining, or emotionally resonant for me: the movies that show the power of the human spirit, the range of human experiences, from love, terror, loss, grief, or joy. Each is a masterwork in their own right, so here I am just going to try to explain why they are such affecting and timeless works of art and represent the best of the art form that you ought to check out while you are stuck inside. Hopefully, they can be as impactful for you as they have been for me.\n\n50. Rashomon (1950) dir. Akira Kurosawa\n\nAkira Kurosawa’s Rashomon is a genuinely revolutionary film that revolutionized subjective storytelling, the capacity of movies to utilize an unreliable narrator, and narrative framing. It begins with a framing device of three strangers, trapped in the remains of a house, taking refuge from a torrential rainstorm. They all discuss what they have heard about a recent trial, where a bandit was accused of murdering a traveling samurai and raping his wife. Each of the strangers tells the perspective they heard, and the audience is treated to multiple versions of the same story. We see the events according to the surviving wife, hear the bandits account of what happened, the testimony of a nearby villager who witnessed it, and even from the ghost of the samurai (summoned by a shaman). What unfolds is an examination of the human condition, the way that we can lie to ourselves about our intentions and actions, and the subjectivity of our own perspectives. It is thrilling, philosophically compelling, and incredibly entertaining from minute one. Kurosawa’s direction is fluid and dreamlike, changing in style to mimic the inner perspective of the tale of each character. Yet, the best part of all is the film’s lack of easy answers. It challenges the very idea of objectivity and truth, whether humans are moral or monsters. It raises these weighty questions, yet somehow finds a way to avoid easy sentimental answers yet affirm humanism at the same time. It is essential viewing.\n\n49. Harakiri (1962) dir. Masaki Kobayashi\n\nHarakiri is a wonderfully subversive use of classical samurai iconography to criticize the clinging to traditional values of honor and restrictive social structures. Brimming with humanism and compassion for the oppressed, it begins in the manner of any classic samurai film, drawing us in with the mystery of a wandering samurai arriving at a noble’s estate, seeking to commit harakiri (a suicide ritual to prevent dishonor). The samurai seems to be in good spirits and humorous, making us wonder, “why is he here to kill himself?” What unfolds masterfully uses our knowledge of its genre against us, showing us scenes in continuous flashbacks, then later flipping our sympathies by revealing the full context. What is played as drama or dark comedy becomes torturous horror when everything is explained.\n\nThe heart of this film is a burning desire to tear down oppressive societal norms. The film asks, “what use is a tradition if it hurts people?” Its compassion is with the poor and oppressed, and it seeks to show how the traditional samurai film holds up this societal structure as admirable while hiding the seedy underbelly. Harakiri subverts this by doing the opposite. The violence is not heroic, it is drawn out, chaotic, and brutally bloody. The hero does not seek to kill; he just wants justice and tries to avoid killing when necessary. The nonviolent scenes are brutally oppressive, with fixed wide-angle cameras and a sterile estate that most of the film takes place in representing the impersonal and rigid nature of the society while in contrast, the brief spurts of violence switch into chaotic filmmaking full of sweeping camera movement, windy textured environments, and stylized dutch angles representing how violence turns the world askew. Tatsuya Nakadia’s central performance is full of humor and empathy but also a burning rage that grabs the attention of the camera at every moment. Kobayashi’s eye for composition makes even the restrained and constrictive visuals of the main scenes compelling and rich, with a deep focus and texture that make the world feel living and breathing. While the immediate concept of the film sucks you in, its stunning cinematography and engaging critique of the Japanese traditions that the samurai films epitomize are what make it a classic.\n\n48. Don’t Look Now (1973) dir. Nicolas Roeg\n\nThis story begins with the tragic death of a child and only gets more emotionally harrowing from there. The film follows John and Laura Baxter, a couple who meet in Venice in an attempt to renew their relationship after the sudden accidental death of their daughter. While in Venice, they encounter a pair of sisters, one of which claims to be a psychic and who claims to have a message from their daughter from beyond the grave. Don’t Look Now is a film about grief and the obsession of not being willing to let someone go. It is a film filled with foreboding and dread, where messages from the afterlife are just as creepy as they are heartwarming.\n\nThe city of Venice, with its winding streets and canals, is the perfect setting for this gothic story. The town, like the characters, feels empty and hollow. On the surface, they appear lifelike, but inside they are shells of their former selves, merely going through the motions. This feeling is exemplified perfectly in a sex scene between the two leads (performed with silent nuance by Donald Pleasance and Julie Christie), which at first seems romantic, but as we delve deeper, we feel the hollowness of it. The act of intimacy itself reinforces the emotional distance between them; the slow realization is done wordlessly but is communicated with such emotional clarity that it is heartbreaking. As the film becomes more and more overtly supernatural, the empty streets feel haunted by the ghosts, both emotional and literal, of the past. It is a profoundly unsettling and creeping piece of horror filmmaking that elevates the genre with remarkable emotional intelligence, superb direction with art-house sensibilities, and two emotionally vulnerable lead performances.\n\n47. Airplane! (1980) dir. David Zucker, Jerry Zucker, Jim Abrahams\n\nComedy, in general, ages poorly. That is a core element of the genre; humor is something that is so very of the moment that comedy often serves as a time capsule for the values, cultural identities, and sensibilities of the past. This phenomenon goes beyond jokes becoming more socially unacceptable with age but also includes even the style of comedy itself (for example, see how the Judd Apatow walk-and-talk stoner comedies of the ’00s are on their death knell now). Yet Abrahams, Zucker, & Zucker’s absurdist comedy classic Airplane one of the rare comedies that transcend its moment in culture, becoming a timeless achievement in comedy. It is clever to a fault, relying on wordplay, sight gags, subverted expectations, and dichotomy for its humor instead of only pop culture references or obscenity. Jokes are flying a mile a minute here, often so many that there are dozens in the background that aren’t even highlighted by the film, adding to the rewatchability. To top it all off, it is aided by the comedic talent of the legendary Leslie Nielson. Frankly, it is hard to analyze comedy and how it works without just ruining the joke. So instead of writing more about it here, I am just going to challenge you to go watch a couple of scenes from this on YouTube and remind yourself how many classic comedy gags come from this. While several iconic films from this era, including the filmmakers own The Naked Gun, Monty Python’s The Holy Grail and The Life of Brian, or Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein would have all been worthy inclusions in this spot, none for me are so intelligently written, bizarre, ironically quotable, or endlessly hilarious as Airplane!\n\n46. Legend of the Drunken Master (1994) dir. Liu Chai-Liang\n\nJackie Chan is a living legend. A hyper-talented martial artist and an obsessive perfectionist in front of and behind the camera, Chan revolutionized action filmmaking with his unique style and screen presence. His use of props and the environment, humor and visual gags, and utter commitment to doing his own stunts (no matter how dangerous) all make Chan’s films uniquely his own, and The Legend of the Drunken Master is the best of his considerable filmography. He returns to his role as Wong Fei-hung, a young and reckless master of the drunken boxing style. His lack of self-control has gotten him into trouble many times and brought dishonor onto his family and he becomes entangled in a conflict with artifact smugglers. This is Chan’s best film because of the perfect story to utilize his talents as an actor. He effortlessly conveys the battle between the chaos of the drunken boxing fighting style (combined with the character’s increasing drunkenness in each fight) and Wong’s inner struggle for control. His humor and talent for physical comedy are on full display, but the seriousness of some of the subject matter allows for some rare, more dramatic moments from him as well.\n\nThe power of the performance is complemented by a great script full of small moments of characterization and a constant brisk pace between set pieces, and some of the best action sequences of Chan’s career (many of which he insisted on choreographing himself to improve) that are captured in beautiful wide shots and precise edits that highlight the action in every moment. This all crescendos perfectly into the finale, which is the best one-on-one martial arts fight ever put to film and serves as the cherry on top of one of the best pieces of action cinema ever made.\n\n45. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) dir. Shane Black\n\nA movie that served as one of Robert Downey Jr.’s comeback roles, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a delicious piece of dark comedy/post-modern noir that pulls from classic tropes of the genre while also finding new ways to twist it in unpredictable and entertaining ways. With a reflexive narration, femme fatal’s, and the seedy neon underbelly of Los Angeles all harkening back to the classics, but Shane Black is never one to play it straight. He finds ways to twist the tropes into an entirely new genre, that of the buddy action comedies that he cut his teeth on in the ’80s. The result is equal parts Double Indemnity and Lethal Weapon and manages to be a remarkably entertaining piece of genre cinema.\n\nDowney Jr. has become famous for his snarky comedic chops, thanks to the Marvel films. Still, his ability to be sardonic has never been better shown than here, and Val Kilmer is incredible as “Gay Perry,” the gay private detective that plays the straight man in this duo. He manages to maintain the serious and threatening edge while also finding the humor in every moment. Black’s writing is among the best in the business at managing to find moments of characterization through humor, and the script drips with style and craft. The moments of action are captured with remarkable efficiency and clarity, especially considering this is Black’s feature directorial debut. It works as the best pieces of post-modern cinema do, both as a hilarious commentary on the genre and a great example of the genre itself.\n\n44. Do the Right Thing (1989) dir. Spike Lee\n\nSpike Lee burst onto the scene with infectious energy and righteous indignation in 1989 with his debut feature, Do The Right Thing. It captures a full cast of eclectic characters who live in a neighborhood in Brooklyn on the hottest day of the year. The heat is an oppressive force, one that brings old resentments and deep racial and gender tensions to the forefront. This film is remarkably ageless in the way it uses the block as a microcosm for the racial issues in America, and how it has not lost a single bit of its relevance, poignancy, or nuance in the 30 years since it was released. Spike Lee’s energetic and kinetic filmmaking emerges fully formed here, and the vast cast is remarkably fleshed out. Like in all of Lee’s best work, every single character is likable, with Lee having compassion for every one of them despite not excusing any of their faults. Lee is furious at the injustices of the world, and the brilliance of the film is how he refuses to give any easy answers.\n\nThere are many ethical and political questions raised by Do the Right Thing, yet it never fails to be entertaining in every moment as well. Spike Lee himself provides tremendous youthful energy as he also stars in the lead role, and the supporting cast is stacked beyond belief. It is hilarious and also brewing with tension, without ever making light of the subject matter or taking away from its seriousness. Lee is far more interested in raising questions than answering them, which is for the best anyway. To try to posit a solution for the vast racial divides and centuries of violence in America would be condescending and simplistic. Instead, Do The Right Thing thrives on the ambiguity, highlighting every perspective, showing it with empathy and understanding while also demonstrating its flaws. This interest in duality is perfectly demonstrated by the films ending. Before the credits roll, we are shown two quotes. One is from MLK, advocating for pacifism in the face of injustice. The other is from Malcolm X, citing the need for violence as self-defense in the face of oppression. There are two paths forward, just like the iconic Love and Hate brass knuckles that Radio Raheem wears. They do battle with each other, and we are left to decide for ourselves which wins at the end, which is the right thing.\n\n43. In the Mood For Love (2000) dir. Wong Kar-Wai\n\nWong Kar-Wai’s lush and sensuous masterpiece In the Mood For Love is a far cry from your typical tale of romance. Instead, it is a tale of longing and repression. It is a film about ironic dualities, about being surrounded by people, unable to get a moment’s privacy, yet still feeling completely alone. Of have formed a deep bond, yet because of social constraints, being unable to act on it. It follows two neighbors, named Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan, who discover that their spouses are having an affair together and form an emotional and romantic bond from that but are conflicted about whether they should act on that desire. They cannot bring themselves to commit the same act of betrayal as their spouses, no matter the intensity of their romantic connection. This lack of contact and restraint imbues every other interaction between the couple with significance. Even the smallest glance, a gesture, a brush of a hand as they pass each other in an alleyway become elevated to acts of extreme romantic longing.\n\nThis constraint is reinforced by the film’s gorgeous cinematography, captured in beautiful slow-mo and luscious colors that perfectly capture the feelings of desire and romantic longing. The film is remarkably quiet, communicating very little through words as instead using its cinematography (full of shots that visually isolate the characters from each other or trap them within a frame within the frame of the shot such as a window, doorframe, or pane of glass to give a sense of claustrophobia and voyeurism)and the warm soundtrack full of strings with a bittersweet repeated motif that is forever burned into my brain, and the smallest gestures from actors Maggie Chung and Tony Leung (who make brilliant use of their body language to communicate volumes about these stoic and reserved characters).\n\nThis is a film that is both melancholic and deeply warm. It shows the power of bonds that can be formed in the most unusual of circumstances, yet also reminds us that not every feeling can be acted on, no matter how much we desire it. It deals with the power and personal significance that simple actions can be given with enough repetition, yet also can show the hollowness of grand gestures. It is psychologically complex, yet straightforward from minute one. It captures the duality of love and the complex circumstances that often surround it. There is a heartbreaking sense of finality and fate to the whole affair, like the characters have no control over the events that they are forced into, yet are left to process the sadness and longing that they are thrust into.\n\n42. Parasite (2019) dir. Bong Joon-ho\n\nBong Joon-ho’s critically acclaimed class satire and Hitchcockian thriller Parasite took the world and the film community by storm last year. It became the first international film to win Best Picture, along with Best Director and Best Original Screenplay (all of which it immensely deserved). Yet it is such a great film that even all those accolades do not do justice to its quality. Bong Joon-ho is one of the most delightful and exciting filmmakers of our time with the way he has used various forms of genre filmmaking (such as monster movies in The Host, murder mysteries in Memories of Murder, dystopian action in Snowpiercer, etc.) to dissect modern society, capitalism, and the ethical problems of our time. In this regard (and in every sense for that matter), Parasite is his masterpiece. His sights are aimed directly at the evils and alienation of capitalism and the modern class system, and his analysis takes no prisoners. The truly impressive thing is that he manages to take these insights and core themes of the story and weave them into the film in an entirely approachable, entertaining, and even subtle way. So much of the storytelling and thematic power comes from the visual language of the film and the way it contrasts the life of the rich to the poor. A rainstorm is presented as calm and relaxing for the wealthy family, but we slowly pan down to the lower levels of the city and see the devastation that such an event can be to the poor. The careful juxtaposition of privilege and comfort with tragedy and a struggle for survival get the film’s point across without a word of dialogue.\n\nCrafted with the utmost precision, Parasite is a masterclass in film construction from every perspective. It perfectly juggles tones as it continually switches tones between humor and tension, satire and thrills. It is exceptionally well-edited, constantly introducing new information a mile-a-minute that comes into play later without the film ever tipping its hand. Every moment is setting up something else that comes into play later. While the film is unpredictable with many twists and turns, everything is perfectly set up and established so that when you think back on the film, you don’t see how it could have ended every other way. With its brilliant visual language, gorgeous framing and lighting, and consistently beautiful shot composition, it is reminiscent of the best films of Hitchcock or Spielberg, with every cinematography and editing choice being the best and most efficient choice for the given situation. Every performance in the cast is excellent, making the most of even the smallest moments. A unique and complete cinematic vision in every respect, Parasite is extremely of the times and a wild, entertaining ride from beginning to end.\n\n41. The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) dir. Wes Anderson\n\nWes Anderson’s filmography is rife with duality. His worlds are idiosyncratic and like a fairy tale, yet the muted and emotionless style hides strife and heartbreak. Never is that more true than in The Grand Budapest Hotel, Anderson’s most idyllic and stylized work, which also hides a tragic undercurrent of fascism and sadness. During world war Europe, with the threat of a Fascist army on everyone’s lips, this is a film about a dying era. Ralph Fiennes plays Gustav H., a concierge who takes his code of honor and politeness to the extreme. He represents a kind of gentleman of a bygone time that no longer exists, and Anderson plays this contrast for both laughs and melancholy.\n\nThe whole film is bittersweet, starting with a framing device years later when the Grand Budapest is a dilapidated hotel, and most of the main characters who we spend the majority of the runtime with inside of flashbacks are long dead. This is a daring way to construct a film since in the wrong hands, it could backfire and disconnect the audience from the characters and story. However, it perfectly leans into Anderson’s strengths as a filmmaker, as he constructs this rosey nostalgic world of the past built by Gustav H. and finds ways to contrast it with the brutal reality of the encroaching modernity to hilarious ends. This film is Anderson’s funniest film by far and also manages to be remarkably emotional under the surface. The undercurrent of Shakespearean tragedy adds so much depth to this film and makes it extremely rewatchable. It is witty, creative, beautiful, and always hilarious. The film is Gustav H. personified, laughing at the absurdity of the new world where his strict code and style have become a relic of history.\n\n40. The Godfather (1972) dir. Frances Ford Coppola\n\nHere we are, with The Godfather. Frances Ford Coppola’s gangster masterwork has been praised to no end, so there is little that I cannot say here that has not already been said. Coppola effortlessly breathes life into this underworld, with his constant use of contrasts, blocking, and the production design of the environments communicating so much more about the characters than any amount of exposition could. The film is epic in scale, establishing this massive criminal underworld while also using that world to guide an intensely personal story of power and the slow corruption of Michael Corleone. Guided by Al Pacino at his career-best and a mesmerizing Marlon Brando as his father Vito, The Godfather is a perfect work of cinema. It is tense, beautifully composed, and precisely edited from beginning to end. It showcases the highest potential of cinema as a medium, and if you somehow have not seen it by now, I urge you to do so.\n\n39. Moonlight (2016) dir. Barry Jenkins\n\nWhen watching Moonlight, I am reminded of a quote from Roger Ebert, that films are like empathy machines that make us see things from the perspective of those who are different than us, to walk a mile in their shoes, and spend two hours seeing the world through their eyes. Moonlight tells the story of the life of a young black man, Chiron, as he struggles with accepting his own identity and sexuality. Director Barry Jenkins blew all of our collective minds with his first feature film, which he decides to tell through three vignettes that take place during defining moments during Chiron’s life. Thanks to the brilliant casting and performances by all three iterations of Chiron, it believably feels like one character throughout the film. The use of the vignettes explores the idea of defining moments in our lives and explores the way that small actions can shape our entire future. The film lives and breathes empathy and compassion, as Jenkins captures every moment with a flowing and dreamlike camera that feels like a distant memory and a haunting score by Nicholas Britell accentuates every moment with beautiful melancholy. Moonlight will stand the test of time as one of the greatest directorial debuts and as a testament to the power of perspective and compassion in cinema.\n\n38. Hero (2002) dir. Zhang Yimou\n\nMartial arts legend Jet Li’s talent is on full display in the Chinese historical epic Hero. It follows Li as an esteemed warrior who has slain multiple assassins who were attempting to kill the emperor. His reward is meeting the emperor himself, who asks him to recount his tale of defeating them. What sets Hero apart from the many other Chinese wuxia martial arts films through a simple conceit. It plays into the subjectivity of our hero telling the stories of these fights to the emperor. Each is designed around one specific color. There are set-pieces designed around a bold blood-red, burning autumn yellow, a serene green color, a rainy grey, and more. Each color choice goes beyond the stunning color and production design, reflecting our lead characters’ state of mind and emotions surrounding the fight itself. This story of war doubles into itself to reflect on the art of storytelling itself, without ever letting that metaphor get in the way of the central melodrama and emotions of the story or the visceral nature of the intricately staged combat. Yimou stages each battle with a focus on clarity, showcasing the level of talent from the stacked cast, including Li, Donnie Yen, Maggie Chung, and Tony Leung. Yet he also understands how action serves character development, with each battle and strike serving as an extension of the character’s own emotions: their hate, love, jealousy, and a desire for peace, which adds even more layers onto this delectable and visually stunning experience.\n\n37. Mirror (1975) dir. Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nAndrei Tarkovski is the undisputed master of poetic art-house cinema. His films ignore character, plot, and even story logic in favor of mimicking emotion, memory, and atmosphere. The Mirror is his crowning achievement: an older dying man reminisces about distinct, defining moments in his life. These memories are constructed as a loose series of vignettes, invoking a dreamlike quality to the whole affair. We see a variety of moments. Moments with his mother, going off to war, fleeting glimpses of the supernatural, and in the films most hauntingly beautiful moments, a child witnessing the burning down of a family barn. Tarkovski’s craft is incredible, using his camera and the texture of his images to invoke an emotion or a feeling. There is a texture, a feeling, to every image, ranging from melancholy to beautiful. While this film can be a challenging experience, as all Tarkovski’s work is, those who invest the time in it will find it a truly unique and rewarding experience.\n\n36. M (1931) dir. Fritz Lang\n\nGerman expressionist Fritz Lang burst out of the silent film era with M, his first picture with sound and one of the first films to make real use of sound as something besides a cheap novelty. M tells the story of a German town gripped with fear of a serial child killer and tackles the subject of serial killers with more nuance and intelligence than even most modern films do. We begin the film immersed in the town’s paranoia. We do not see the killer for the entirety of the first act. Instead, we hear him. We are introduced to him through a musical motif, a tune he whistles as he walks. We instantly associate the motif with the presence of the killer, allowing him to dominate the film and create an atmosphere of intense danger without even being on-screen. The movie is full of artful shadows and dutch angles that harken back to Lang’s work in silent films.\n\nAs the case develops and the body count grows, the police go to more extreme methods to try to track him down. This leads to the criminal elements of the town to search for the killer as well, to relieve the immense police pressure on their organizations. It leads to some incredibly tense set-pieces as we are put in the shoes of the killer, as he goes from being the hunter to the hunted and attempts to evade capture. It culminates in a culminating final sequence that turns the film on its head, as the killer (a darkly humorous but also menacing Peter Lorre) pleads the angry mob not to kill him. It tests the empathy of the audience, as we go on a journey throughout the film from seeing the killer as a sociopathic killing machine, to a hunted man, to a sick, pathetic person utterly destroyed by his harmful desires. The film’s switch to a proto-courtroom drama is incredibly compelling, and haunting in how it demonstrates the futility of revenge even against the evilest people. It challenges free will with arguments of determinism and even questions the concept of moral responsibility itself. But in the end, M is a classic for both its compelling ideas but also its incredible cinematic craft.\n\n35. Autumn Sonata (1978) dir. Ingmar Bergman\n\nIngmar Bergman’s dive into the resentments, emotional traumas, and challenges of parental relationships in Autumn Sonata channels his challenging relationships with his own parents. It follows a married woman(Liv Ullman) whose mother (Ingrid Bergman, in her only collaboration with Ingmar Bergman, no relation) comes to visit after a seven-year absence. What unfolds explores the way that family dynamics are perceived differently by each person, how we can bring out the worst in those we love, and what happens when unspoken resentments come bubbling to the surface. It is nightmarishly claustrophobic and unrelenting as off-handed comments spiral into lengthy arguments and pouring salts into old wounds. The film is a chamber-piece film with a limited cast, as many of Bergman’s movies are. It is made the most impactful by the cutting emotional and philosophic dialogue, vulnerable and theatrical performances, and Bergman’s striking eye for imagery and direction with the help of his frequent collaborator, cinematographer Sven Nykvist. The film is hard to watch, but the beautiful yet suffocating way it is shot, the all-star cast, and painfully honest script make Autumn Sonata a film that challenges the viewer and leaves a significant emotional impact.\n\n34. The Exorcist (1973) dir. William Freidkin\n\nThe Exorcist is a masterclass in dread and generating fear. There are many reasons for this: the intimate fear of a child being possessed, its unflinching depiction of evil corrupting youthful purity, the haunting gothic imagery captured by Friedkin’s camera, and the iconic score. Yet, perhaps the most crucial element to making The Exorcist terrifying is how many steps it takes to establish a sense of realism. The tormented family are not religious zealots, but non-believers who seek out medical and psychological explanations first. The priest is a trained psychiatrist who is losing his faith and doesn’t believe in demons. Friedkin’s handheld, documentarian style adds a feeling of authenticity to the whole affair. The film spends a lot of time establishing the fact that every reasonable step and defense has failed Reagan, which makes the realization that there is something otherworldly going on here. The slow pace and character work compared to other genre films leave the viewer immensely invested in the outcome, which plays out in the final act with the titular exorcism that remains intimate yet biblical in proportion.\n\n33. Her (2013) dir. Spike Jonze\n\nSometimes films are simply ahead of their time, and that is the case with Her. This transcends being a romance film by using low-key sci-fi elements to explore the nature of romantic connection, as well as how technology and modern life isolates us as people. Spike Jonze uses very subtle world-building through the use of color grading and production design to create a wholely organic world that feels like it could be an extension of (or future of) our own. Every moment feels all too human and relatable, even though the story is one that none of us have experienced. Joaquin Phoenix’s lead performance as Theodore in this movie is vulnerable to its core, finding a way to communicate the character’s tenderness, loneliness, and fear with tremendous subtlety considering for most of the film he is essentially acting alone and talking to his phone. Scarlett Johannson also delivers a masterclass performance as she voices Samantha the AI, infusing every word and vocal inflection with the boundless meaning that comes with someone learning about the world and experiencing emotions for the first time with only her vocal performance. Every moment of Her is tinged with the beauty and melancholy of doomed romance, from the insecurity of attachment to the sad but beautiful realization that you both have grown beyond the relationship. The film is a shining example of how science fiction can be used to heighten other genres. The result is heartbreaking, subtle, funny, and insightful into the experience of love.\n\n32. A Clockwork Orange (1971) dir. Stanley Kubrick\n\nCinematic master Stanley Kubrick uses the dystopian sci-fi setting of A Clockwork Orange to explore ideas of morality and free will. This profoundly disturbing film has been highly controversial for its depiction of violence and sexuality, but it does so with immense care and purpose. We follow Alex, a teenager who leads a gang of his friends on excursions of ultraviolence, rape, and debauchery. After killing a woman, he is thrown in prison and subjected to an experiment that looks to condition him to become sick at even the thought of violence or sexuality. Kubrick’s directing and production design are remarkably sterile and detached, an internalization of the main character’s detached view of the world around him. For all of Kubrick’s reputation as a cold filmmaker, but this is a remarkably subjective film, shot entirely from the perspective of our main character. It is a thought-provoking exploration of free will, as we see multiple views on morality all try to use Alex to prove their point. Is morality a societal issue, where the warped society he has grown up him has caused his lack of empathy? Can morality be enforced by indoctrination by a power like the government? Can someone really change at all, or are they bound to devolve back into their old harmful habits? We see all of these ideas explored through Alex’s story throughout the runtime, and it makes the film a deeply disturbing but highly worthwhile piece of storytelling.\n\n31. The Big Lebowski (1998) dir. The Coen Brothers\n\nThe Big Lebowski is one of the greatest comedy films of all time, peppered with hysterical dialogue that makes use of repeated lines and motifs, brilliant performances, and a plot that twists a classic detective noir story into a parody of that very genre. Our protagonist, Jeffery “The Dude” Lebowski, tries to navigate a twisting kidnapping mystery involving mistaken identity and trying to get his rug replaced after some thugs break into his house and pee on it. The Coen’s comedic timing makes this film an all-time classic, letting dozens of gags fly by in the background, which significantly rewards rewatches. Its plot is practically impossible to follow, but that is part of the charm. The nonsensical mystery adds to the hilarity of the situation as these bumbling characters completely misunderstand what’s going on, and the events themselves are so silly and ludicrous that they are impossible not to laugh at. The film is instantly iconic and quotable: from The Dude and Walter not letting Donny in on a conversation, the angry nihilists, Walter’s constant escalations and Vietnam references, and so many more moments. It is interesting ideologically in the way it weaves philosophies into the various characters outlooks like many of the Coen’s films do and lampoons edgy nihilists in a way that will never be outdone. It is one of those extremely rare comedies that gets funnier each time you watch it, so check it out whether you have never seen it or seen it dozens of times.\n\n30. Halloween (1978) dir. John Carpenter\n\nJohn Carpenter is perhaps the greatest master of the horror genre, and no film of his is more influential than Halloween. A taut, suspenseful horror film that kicked off the slasher movie craze that dominated the box office for the next decade. While not the first film to mess with the concept (with forebears including Psycho, Peeping Tom, and Black Christmas), it crystalized the formula. Halloween manages to show the peak potential of the subgenre thanks to Carpenter’s controlled use of background details to slowly build tension and fear as Michael Myers stalks his victims, stunning widescreen cinematography that evokes the iconography of the American suburbs with a sinister twist, and Carpenter’s instantly iconic moody score. It is a far cry from the tropes that the slasher is identified with: with little on-screen blood, a focus on dread over jump scares, actually likable teenage characters, and a real sense of morbid fear. It is lean, evocative, and an exquisite piece of genre filmmaking whose place among the film canon is well-earned.\n\n29. Apocalypse Now (1979) dir. Frances Ford Coppola\n\nThe old saying goes, “war is hell,” but in Apocalypse Now, it is more like purgatory. Vietnam is treated as this dreamlike place, equally filled with serene beauty and nightmarish violence. In this film, it is a reflection of the duality of the souls of the soldiers — the capacity for love and tenderness, but also the utmost depravity. Coppola’s vast and ambitious adaptation of Heart of Darkness stands head and shoulders above other war films by using its setting to explore the psychology of its characters. The images are striking, with exaggerated shadows and stunning lighting. As the soldiers delve further into purgatory, the film becomes more nightmarish and philosophical. It changes its focus from the hellish nature of war to the battle over the soul of the soldiers. Once they arrive at Colonel Kurtz’s cult compound, they are faced with a final test of their resolve and humanity in one of the most memorable final acts in the history of cinema.\n\n28. Scream (1996) dir. Wes Craven\n\nIt is hard to put into words exactly how influential, defining, and thrilling of a horror film Scream is. Coming during the mid-90’s drought of horror where the slasher excesses of the ’80s had gone on for so long even the greatest franchises in the sub-genre (including director Wes Craven’s Nightmare on Elm Street franchise) had run themselves into the ground with endless repetitive and cash-grabbing sequels, Scream came along and changed the game. It completely re-defined the slasher genre, bringing a deconstructive and meta approach to the mainstream. Every moment in this film, every shot, every set-piece, is so well-done and copied that it has reached iconic status. As a result of this, it is easy to forget how revolutionary and effective the film is because of how often it has been copied, ripped off, and spoofed.\n\nThe brilliance of Scream is two-fold. First, it is simply a superbly crafted film that manages to be efficient, intellectually stimulating, and thrilling in equal measure. It feels like an intersection of the greatest talents, from an all-star cast, with insightfully witty writing from Kevin Williamson, and of course Wes Craven’s mastery of the horror genre and the way he uses the camera and editing to manufacturing tension. But it is also brilliant for the way it is perhaps the only film I have ever seen that lands the sweet spot of deconstruction. It directly calls out the cliche’s of the genre in a hysterical way but goes beyond surface-level winking at the audience by deconstructing the genre through its cinematic choices. The story, the directing, score, editing, and even the performances play into dissecting the genre. And on top of it ALL, Scream uses the deconstruction to make the movie scarier. It participates in the tropes as it calls them out, it leaves the audience uncertain about when it will subvert or play it straight. It is, for my money, the greatest mix of intellectual horror whose themes critique the genre and society itself, and mainstream, edge-of-your-seat horror. It is the best mix of both of these because both of these elements actively make the other part better.\n\n27. Vertigo (1958) dir. Alfred Hitchcock\n\nAlfred Hitchcock is one of the most respected film directors of all time. He has made dozens of films that could be considered classics: Rear Window, Psycho, North By Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Rope, The Birds, Notorious, Dial M For Murder, Rebecca, Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, I could go on for hours. Yet none of them are quite as gripping as his psycho-sexual thriller Vertigo. It tells the story of retired detective John Ferguson (James Stewart), who comes out of retirement at the behest of a friend to investigate his wife’s bizarre behavior. This film is a bit self-inserting, with a famously obsessive director making an entire film about obsession and desire. It features some of Hitchcock’s best storytelling, from the lush and symbolic use of color, the layered performances, and some very tense set-pieces that make great use of its locations. As it evolves into something far more twisted and disturbing than we initially realized, the film takes us on a wild ride from start to finish.\n\n26. Jaws (1975) dir. Steven Spielberg\n\nWhat is there to even say about the brilliance of Jaws that hasn’t been said a million times already? It is a miracle of filmmaking, done on a shoestring budget, and many of the most exciting moments (such as the lack of presence of the shark) were done purely because of technical malfunctions. Spielberg broke onto the mainstream with this incredible adventure/horror hybrid. While it is remembered for Spielberg’s iconic direction and the tense but vibrant score, it is the quiet moments that make Jaws memorable. It is at its best when its characters are just existing together, like when Chief Brody has dinner with his family, or when he, Quint, and Hooper gather around the table and share drinks and memories. The character work is what makes it an iconic film more than anything else, as well as makes it endlessly rewatchable.\n\n25. Taxi Driver (1976) dir. Martin Scorsese\n\nMartin Scorsese is perhaps our most talented living director, and none of his films are more impactful than Taxi Driver. A grimy look at the criminal underbelly of New York City through the eyes of a growingly unhinged sociopath, this film is one of the most unnerving pieces of genre filmmaking ever made. It is so effective because of how it implicates the audience in the events of the film. We see from the very beginning how Travis Bickle is a sociopath. We know the danger under the surface of Robert DeNiro’s surface-level charm to see how there is always a menace in every scene. While the film does make you sympathize with Travis’ lack of social skills, embarrassing situations, and past trauma, yet unlike many of the movie’s imitators (cough Joker cough), we are meant to sympathize with the other characters around him. He may be our lead character, but the film never seeks to make him a hero. His scenes of violence are filmed like a horror film, lingering on the violent and bloody suffering in his wake, and the final moments where it shows the positive public reaction are meant to churn your stomach as people take his actions the wrong way and glorify him. The camera is detached from his perspective, and the film spends the time building empathy for the supporting characters caught up in his obsession. It takes a clear stance on Travis’ twisted morality. It is incredibly tense, disturbing, and a slick and stylish piece of ’70s filmmaking and the best example of one of the great talents in the modern cinematic landscape.\n\n24. The Seventh Seal (1957) dir. Ingmar Bergman\n\nThe Seventh Seal is a film of extremes, with the theatricality of the staging and monologues and the dreamlike structure serving you heighten the emotion and atmosphere of the experience. The entire human condition is its focus: love, loss, grief, anger, faith, and rebellion. For a film so grand in scope, it is remarkable how watchable it is, which is mostly to the credit of Bergman’s precise writing and tonal control. The philosophical monologues are cutting in their angst but also deeply honest and emotionally compelling in their desperation for answers, never dipping too far into edginess for its own sake. The film’s dry wit and humor are also expertly employed, managing to walk the delicate tightrope of comedic relief without letting the humor dampen the emotional impact of the drama.\n\nThe backdrop of the Black Plague is the perfect setting; even though Death is personified into a character, it also feels ever-present. Death is more than a role; it is a specter that haunts this story as each character is haunted and continuously reminded of their mortal condition. The imagery is likewise deeply gothic, with Bergman’s talent for framing and image composition, making scene after scene iconic from visuals alone. Each shot is deeply moody, feeling like the Medieval paintings we see in the church early in the film. Bergman’s stunning visual style is already evident and formed here, even before he began his collaboration with cinematographer Sven Nykfist that would define the rest of his career. He and Gunnar Fischer shoot the film with a playful, theatrical style, heightening the stage-play feeling of the script and performances with intense, layered composition and artificial lighting.\n\nThe performances are also genuinely iconic. The squire’s quick wit and false bravado masking his inability to cope with the meaninglessness of his existence, the knight’s righteous demand for meaning and certainty from an absent god, deaths cold and calculated demeanor which cracks ever so slightly when the futile resistance of people amuses him. Every character feels archetypical and iconic, entrenched in the annals of film history. It is a testament to the craft of this film in every regard that even now, 60 years later, it is as compelling as it was that day. It has not lost its emotional impact due to its cultural status. It is an ode to those who will not accept the easy answers, who lash out angrily against a world that refuses to answer them. I am left with an image of Sydow in the church, venting to the priest (a disguised Death) “Why can’t I kill God in me? Why does He live on in me in a humiliating way — despite my wanting to evict Him from my heart? Why is He, despite all, a mocking reality I can’t be rid of?” This is a film for those who feel the same. The people who try to make sense of it all, unable to let go yet also unsatisfied with the answers we are given. The knights. The squires. Even the circus performers.\n\n23. Alien (1979) dir. Ridley Scott\n\nThe vast emptiness of space is contrasted with the dingy, wet interiors of the Nostromo, a cargo vessel whose crew chooses to respond to a distress signal on a foreign planet. The blue-collar team doesn’t realize the danger they are in until its too late: when an alien organism bursts from the chest of their captain in a scene that remains shocking even today. This sets the tone for the rest of the film, as this ruthless killing machine hunts them down one at a time, and the crew’s human imperfections are contrasted with the perfect efficiency of the creature. There is an incredible sense of dread as the film progresses, with the dark and damp production design making every corner of the ship feel like a potential hiding place for the alien. Ridley Scott crafts the film with the utmost attention to detail, having his camera float detached through the Nostromo’s corridors and staging each scare with a sense of care uncommon in most horror films, which are punctuated by Jerry Goldsmith’s iconic avant-garde score. Sigourney Weaver’s performance as Ripley is iconic for a reason, instantly relatable in her intelligence and tenacity without sacrificing a human sense of fear within the situation. She knows she is in danger, but forces herself to do what she has to survive anyway.\n\n22. Hereditary (2018) dir. Ari Aster\n\nHorror is trauma, and there has been no horror film this decade that hammers that point home better (or emotionally traumatized me) quite like Ari Aster’s debut feature Hereditary. This film is impressive on a thousand fronts. The restrained approach to scaring the audience through careful attention to detail and slow-burning dread, further emphasized by the constant themes of fatalism and lack of free will for the characters through dialogue and the recurring motif of the dollhouses, the way that the film carefully knows how to limit the perspective of the audience to that of the characters through cinematography to build dread and increase the effectiveness of the scares when they do happen, I could go on about this film for ages. Toni Collette is jaw-dropping in the scale and nuance of her performance, selling every moment and every type of emotion, from the subtle family tension, the spiraling anxiety, grief, or burning anger. The energy and power of her performance are among the best of the decade, and it truly anchors the rest of the film. Aster instantly became one of the most exciting filmmakers of our time, using his formalist control over the camera and confident sense of tone and pace to emphasize the atmospheric discomfort and tension between the characters, keeping us in that moment for far longer than most filmmakers would dare, trusting that the audience is along for the ride of discomfort and terror (look no further than a particularly horrifying scene involving a car accident to show the power of his restraint and style).\n\n21. The Silence of the Lambs (1991) dir. Jonathan Demme\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs is my go-to example of a perfectly executed film. Its premise, the brilliant and amoral Dr. Lector assisting a rookie FBI agent in hunting down a serial killer of women, while also plotting and manipulating his way towards escape at every moment, could quickly flip into camp, cheese, or exploitation territory. Yet, thanks to Demme’s tight tonal control, expert craft, a nuanced script adapting Thomas Harris’ novel, and some iconic performances, it perfectly navigates its way to becoming one of the most effective yet accessible psychological thrillers of all time. It is an example of perfectly efficient writing and directing, where on multiple viewings every single line of the script, every shot, edit, and music choice seems ideal for generating the reaction it wants from the audience. Demme plays us like a fiddle. Anthony Hopkins commands the screen in such a way that his presence is felt in every frame and moment, despite only appearing on-screen for 16 minutes. His charisma and intelligence perfectly capture Hannibal’s charming yet manipulative nature. At the same time, Jodie Foster does a beautiful job of projecting an aura of strength, desperately attempting to hide a vulnerable core.\n\n20. Children of Men (2006) dir. Alfonso Cuaron\n\nSometimes films are shockingly prescient, and such is the case with Children of Men. Alfonso Cuaron’s post-apocalyptic thriller dives into humanity’s response to tragedy and our species extinction when the entire human race suddenly becomes infertile. It follows Clive Owen, a former activist is confronted with his own moral compromises when he is asked by a former lover to escort an immigrant woman who has miraculously become pregnant across the border to safety. Its commentary on fascism, the treatment of immigrants, and the choice between nihilistic selfishness and selfless love for your fellow man in times of crisis have only become more relevant with every passing year. Cuaron’s craft is astounding, with several breathtaking long-takes following the characters through the chaos of war zones and some deeply intimate framing during the more intimate scenes. It is thrilling, heartwarming, and engaging on a political, philosophical, and emotional level.\n\n19. The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) dir. Wes Anderson\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums is Wes Anderson at his most emotionally warm and intimate. It tells the story of the Tenenbaum family (Royal, his former wife, and their three children) and those connected to them as they attempt to reconnect and come to terms with their past emotional traumas. With a stacked cast (Gene Hackman, Ben Stiller, Gwenyth Paltrow, Luke & Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Anjelica Houston, and more), and Anderson’s style is perfect for the world of the film. The restrained, emotionless delivery of most of the lines perfectly demonstrates their emotionally stunted worldview, while also making the moments where they break through the artificiality for authentic emotional connections all the more impactful. It is darkly funny throughout but is tempered by a genuine empathy for all involved, which sets it apart from many other films like it. Its payoff is heartwrenching, and its nuanced take on family connection and forgiveness makes it a classic.\n\n18. The Shining (1980) dir. Stanley Kubrick\n\nThe Shining is a labyrinthian film, full of twisted psychoanalytic family drama, political undertones, and nightmare logic. It is a famously layered film, with symbolism, metaphors, or lingering details that have spawned a thousand fan theories. Yet, what has made it a timeless landmark in horror cinema is its effectiveness. Kubrick creates such a sense of claustrophobia and dread through his camera, as it stalks our characters through the winding passages of the hotel that defy any sense of logic or geography. The hotel twists and distorts to fit the trauma of the family moving in, escalating their existing tensions to the point of violence and evil. At the same time, it turns their nightmares and anxieties against them. The production design is uncanny, capturing a bygone relic while also maintaining a sinister and twisted design that never quite makes sense.\n\nJack Nicholson is depraved and unhinged, capturing the sense of a man barely holding in his demons even from the very first scene. His manic energy captivates every scene, but Shelly Duval’s terrified reactions complement it. There are a thousand little details that make The Shining so compelling to watch. Kubrick’s famed perfectionism was turned up to 11 on the shoot, and the results are undeniable. It creates an uncanny sense of morbidity and fear that grips the audience throughout the runtime. We can feel the hotel watching us and closing in, it feels inevitable. We know that there is no escape from the Overlook hotel, but thanks to the brilliant script, we hope against all the odds against that inevitability.\n\n17. Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) dir. The Coen Brothers\n\nThe Coen Brothers are my favorite filmmakers. They have been making riveting films for three decades now, with a filmography full of such masterpieces as No Country for Old Men, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Tho, and A Serious Man. Yet with Inside Llewyn Davis, they show even more introspection and emotion than hey had in any film before, or since. Llewyn (played by a career-best emotive and melancholic Oscar Isaac) is a folk musician trying to make it in the ’60s, and the film follows his artistic pursuits and personal struggles. But the film is about more than that. It is about depression and the spiraling negative effect that loss has on people, as well as the toll and grind of artistic success. Brunel Debonnell’s cinematography is hazy, full of murky shadows and plumes of cigarette smoke, perfectly capturing the oppressive drabness that depression feels like. While the usual Coen Brothers humor is present, this film is more somber. It addresses the cyclical nature of life and the amount of struggle that positive change takes. It tackles whether positive change is even possible at all, and how we must relish in even small victories and improvements. After all the toil that we see Llewyn struggle through, his final musical performance of “Fare Thee Well” never fails to bring me to tears.\n\n16. Shame (2011) dir. Steve McQueen\n\nNo film that I can think of tackles the pain and alienation of addiction more than Steve McQueen’s Shame. It follows Michael Fassbender as Brandon, a sex addict trying to maintain control over his urges and live a functional lifestyle. When his sister Sissy (played with emotional power by Carey Mulligan) comes to visit, throwing off his routine and bringing up memories of the past he tries not to remember. Shame is a very quiet and detached film, letting the expressiveness of Fassbender’s mesmerizing performance tell most of the story while McQueen’s brilliant visual storytelling sets the mood and leaves the details implied for the attentive viewer. As Brandon’s life spirals out of control, this film is brutally emotional without ever being manipulative, preferring the emotional honesty of its depiction instead of schmaltzy sentimentality or tearjerking. It is compelling and spot-on in its understanding of how trauma is the root core of addiction. The craft of the film is laudable, creating a detached and sterile feeling for most of the movie through cinematography and production design to represent Brandon’s alienation from everything and everyone, only to rip it away at the end for a few moments of breathtaking intimacy. While not an easy film to watch by any means, Shame is one of the most impactful films I have ever seen.\n\n15. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015) dir. George Miller\n\nThis film is among the best that action cinema has to offer. Mindblowing in its scope, vision, and manic energy, Mad Max: Fury Road is pure adrenaline from the first minute, and it never lets up. George Miller’s pitch-perfect visual storytelling and editing allow for all of this utter chaos to be easy to follow despite multiple parallel threads of action that support dozens of characters in huge scale set-pieces. This is a perfect action from an editing perspective, keeping up high octane energy in every scene, creating a rhythm to the action that perfectly flows with the story. Every set-piece is a pyramid of details, with dozens of connective action beats supporting each other as the characters work together to complete intricate goals, and the film never fails to connect those dots and makes sure the audience understands what is going on during every moment of frenetic chaos. Despite rapid cutting, every moment is clear and easy to understand. Gorgeous visual effects and a pulse-pounding score compliment this masterwork of a film, while Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy imbue their characters with such heart and emotion despite having barely any dialogue thanks to amazing physical performances. Deeply heartfelt and political without needing a word of dialogue to convey it, Fury Road has it all and will be an example of the heights that genre filmmaking can reach for decades to come.\n\n14. Before Sunset (2004) dir. Richard Linklater\n\nBefore Sunset is the middle film in Richard Linklater’s Before Trilogy, which tells the story of a romantic relationship between Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celene (Julie Delphy) over two decades. Each film is set 9 years apart and takes place over the course of 24 hours. This film picks up 9 years after Jesse and Celene’s first meeting: after spending one magical day together, they had not had any contact since. They missed their scheduled meet-up and did not have any contact information for the other. They both thought they had moved on until by chance they bumped into each other in France. This film is beautiful in how it immediately slips back into the romance and longing of the first film. It captures the feeling of reconnecting with an old friend. Jesse has quit smoking long ago (likely at the behest of his wife), yet upon seeing Celene light up, he smirks and asks for one, taking a long drag from the cigarette and savoring it, as the feeling reminds him of times past. Times when he didn’t feel trapped in a loveless marriage, when he wasn’t so cynical, and when he believed in love.\n\nThe whole film is full of moments like that. Linklater never draws attention to these little moments, preferring to pepper them in the background and focusing on the naturalism and intimacy of the moment. Hawke and Delphy’s chemistry is like lightning in a bottle, two actors who lived and breathed to make their relationship feel authentic (helped by the fact that they helped write the script to ensure the dialogue was authentic to their character’s inner voice). The two wander the beautiful streets and canals of Vienna together, wanting to act on their passions yet feeling constrained by societal pressures. They are older, wiser, and realize the unlikely nature of their connection, but their love for each other cannot be denied. It draws on the magic of what could be. It is warm and compassionate, and more than anything, sincere and human.\n\n13. The World’s End (2013) dir. Edgar Wright\n\nEdgar Wright is one of the most exciting and energetic filmmakers, and The World’s End, the conclusion to his thematically connected “Cornetto Trilogy” is his crowning achievement. It follows a group of 5 childhood best friends who return to their hometown to do a pub crawl they failed to do as teens, only to find out that almost everyone has been replaced by lifelike robots. It takes the same razor-sharp satirical approach to sci-fi films like Invasion of the Body Snatchers that Hot Fuzz took to buddy-cop movies and Shaun of the Dead did to zombie films, but with an even more clear eye for character and empathetic pathos for each character despite their deep flaws. Its insights into addiction and messages of undying love and friendship prove to be incredibly affecting, while the lightning-quick jokes and terrific action make this a fantastic and entertaining experience. No one in the film industry edits a film as effectively as Edgar Wright does, using his editing to make jokes, provide insight into characters, and keep the plot rolling at a supersonic pace. This film flies by at a mile-a-minute, while somehow making room for every emotional moment time to breathe and (like every Wright film) loads every single scene with piles of symbolism and information for an attentive viewer. Humanistic and hilarious, The World’s End is a masterpiece, and I am not sure Wright will ever be able to top it.\n\n12. Barry Lyndon (1975) dir. Stanley Kubrick\n\nThere is no better counterargument to the criticism “style over substance” than Barry Lyndon, Kubrick’s story of the rise and fall of a power-hungry and greedy nobleman. This is Kubrick’s most emotional and human film and is so while also being Kubrick’s most aesthetically sterile and detached film. I believe that the emotional and thematic/intellectual impact of the film even come from that presentation. One of the first things you notice about Barry Lyndon is the gorgeous, painting-like cinematography. Indeed, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott designed the cinematography to resemble 18th-century oil paintings. They capture incredibly detailed and deep images, with layers upon layers of immaculately staged people, naturalistic lighting, and deep textures. The use of an extreme long-take style of shooting with minimal camera movement also adds to the similarities to paintings. However, this style of shooting not only creates stunning images and aesthetic accuracy to the period but non-verbally enhances the theme of the film.\n\nBarry Lyndon critiques the 18th-century aristocracy and its desire to separate itself from the violence and barbarism of 18th-century existence by living sterile lives full of art, strict societal hierarchies, and artificial material decadence. However, Barry Lyndon argues that these practices strip the aristocrats of their emotions, and ultimately their humanity. It does this by depicting the aristocracy in a similarly extreme way. They are depicted as figures in paintings; people who are trapped in a detached, stifling societal structure, just like the purposely artificial presentation distances the audience from the figures in the film. It alienates the viewer just like the society of the 18th-century bourgeoisie alienates them from themselves. It should be noted that the few moments where these societal rules are broken are the moments where its artifice is broken.\n\nThe artificiality of the film also plays into Barry’s character arc. He has little agency, and that is the point. He is a man who is just pushed through life, chance having its way with him. He is a pawn in the game of fate, and the craft of the film reinforces this as he and the other characters are stifled and dwarfed by the wide-angle, static takes which make it seem like the world is overwhelming to our characters and they are minuscule in the face of it. This leads to some of the most emotionally affecting moments in Kubrick’s filmography as we cannot help but feel for Barry as he is kicked around by fate and has the things he cares about most taken away from him repeatedly. The film also manages to find humor in this trap through a sense of irony, as even its brutally nihilistic ending epilogue finds a pitch-black moment of humor in the pointlessness of it all (“Good or bad, handsome or ugly, rich or poor, they are all equal now”). Speaking of the film’s sense of humor, it finds humor throughout in very dry ways. It keeps the film entertaining despite the film’s deliberate pacing over its 3-hour runtime. It is a dry and witty takedown of a particularly hedonistic period of history while managing to find beauty and humor among all the fatalistic tragedy.\n\n11. All That Jazz (1979) dir. Bob Fosse\n\nThis is a film so ambitious that it is hard to believe it exists. Its themes are universal, but it is so bold, personal, and singularly intimate in the way it approaches its subject that it blows me away every time. Director Bob Fosse channels everything about himself into his main character, Joe Gideon: a famous musical theater director and choreographer, womanizer, struggling father, and general asshole. Fosse’s insecurity, creativity, vulnerability, fear, and joy for life are all present here and channeled into Roy Schieder, whose expressiveness and captivating screen presence perfectly embody why people would love someone like Gideon (or Fosse).\n\nHe injects every bit of the surrealism of a stage production into the film, as an angel (played by Jessica Lange) looks back on his life with him, and the line between reality and stage performance begins to blur. It is a stunning film that amazingly pulls off conceptualizing Fosse’s mortality, ego, and sense of self with bittersweet humor, emotional honesty, and profound love for even the mundane aspects of life. It accumulates in a heartbreaking musical number as Gideon on his deathbed comes to mental terms with his own legacy and relationships to others through all the glitz and glamour of a stage production. Scheider channels every bit of emotion into the rendition of Bye Bye Life, and the mix of surreal ’70s abstraction with the brutal realism of slowly losing one’s life is the purest distillation of the human condition and our awareness of our mortality that I have ever seen put to film, and it is still mesmerizing 40 years later.\n\n10. Persona (1966) dir. Ingmar Bergman\n\nA famed actress named Elisabet Vogler (Bergman’s frequent collaborator Liv Ullman) has a psychotic episode and falls entirely silent. Her nurse Alma (Bibi Anderson) takes her out to the country to care for her privately in hopes of rehabilitating her and restoring her ability to speak. So begins Bergman’s experimental psychological thriller Persona, one of his most experimental and emotionally mature films. The film explores the concept of identity and selfhood, whether it is self-created, only meaningful in relation to others, though it is more interested in blurring the lines in an existential manner. It is decidedly art-house in approach, doubling down on Bergman’s dreamlike style and the dream logic of his films, at one point even pulling back and revealing the crew filming the scene and shattering the illusion of the film itself, negating the separation between the image and the audience. It deconstructs the nature of performance itself, as they are performing for each other and us as well as we are implicated in the story through the multiple ruptures in the narrative and 4th wall breaks.\n\nThe film is also one involving isolation, featuring only the two actresses for the majority of the runtime. The power dynamics between the two are constantly shifting as they reveal information about themselves, deceive, manipulate, and twist the proverbial knife into each other in lengthy diatribes and monologues. The longer they spend in isolation, the more their relationship turns into something abusive and terrifying. Bergman’s lengthy collaboration with cinematographer Sven Nykvist is full of stunning and haunting images, but none are better than the stunning photography of Persona. With exaggerated, impressionistic lighting, stunning silhouettes, and incredibly staged images, so much of Persona’s story is told visually. It remains not only an engaging intellectual experience but also a visceral and entertaining story from start to finish. It is Bergman’s highest achievement and remains a must-see film for anyone interested in the art of cinema.\n\n9. Die Hard (1988) dir. John McTiernan\n\nDie Hard is a perfect screenplay, masterful in its pacing, characterization, and efficiency. Every scene is the best possible version of itself, with incredible performances, witty and quotable dialogue, a sense of geography and staging that is missing from modern action cinema, and an iconic score. Bruce Willis’ performance as John McLane is authentic and vulnerable in a way that action heroes rarely are: he is in constant danger, always narrowly escaping every moment by the skin of his teeth. This vulnerability creates a legitimate sense of danger and stakes, as we are immediately shown the skill and ruthlessness of the terrorists, which makes us realize precisely how out of his depth John is. He also manages to overcome the tremendous obstacles with a relatable sarcasm and exasperation that makes him relatable and endearing.\n\nEvery set-piece is finely crafted, with clear staging that makes use of the variety of settings within the Nakatomi’s levels. Every moment effortlessly walks the line between tension and humor. It flies by, while also managing to be endlessly rewatchable. The release of Die Hard signaled the death of bombastic ’80s action with invincible, muscle-bound heroes because of how well it subverted the tropes of the time with a likable but human protagonist. It changed the landscape of action cinema forever and still stands as a shining example of it.\n\n8. The Dekalog (1989) dir. Krzysztof Kieslowski\n\nThe power of The Dekalog is hard to capture with mere words. It is a film of contradictions and of the natural complications and ambiguity that makes life so frustrating yet so beautiful at the same time. Dekalog tells ten independent yet interconnected stories. Each chapter is titled after one of the Roman Catholic 10 Commandments, their everyday challenges, and the choices that they are faced with to explore these moral dilemmas and the interconnected nature of them. The film’s scope involves the grandest of questions, yet explores those ideas through the most small-scale, intimate scenarios. There are not philosophic monologues exploring the profundity of the scenarios, instead, it is explored through the subtle complexities of the character’s relationships and the scenarios they find themselves in. Each tale is one exploring grand questions of philosophy, religion, and morality, yet the core of each story is the deep compassion for humanity and respect for the complexity of the eternal mystery surrounding the answers to these questions. Kieslowski is firm in his insistence that the question is more important than the answer, and that these problems are so complex and core to the human experience that any concrete solution would be a disservice to the nuance of our existential questions. We are rarely given the full story at the beginning, as the film slowly pulls back the curtain time and time again as if to condemn the audience’s judgment of any character’s actions by slowly revealing the interior depth of their motivations. Kieslowski uses the film not only as a tool for exploring philosophical ideas in a relatable way but as a way to teach empathy. Each character is drawn wholistically, without judgment in a way that invites us to consider other people in the same way, acknowledging the struggles, motivations, and causes that underlie behavior that we disapprove of.\n\nThe 10 hours spent watching this film is among the most rewarding you could have when it comes to consuming cinema. It is quiet and reserved on the surface, but within are enough philosophical problems to fill volumes of literature that are explored in an entirely relatable and unpretentious manner. The thematic content never overshadows the characters, but instead are intrinsically connected in the same vein as the grandest examples of cinema-as-philosophy, such as Bergman, Tarkovsky, or the Coen brothers. The organic and naturalistic style of the film sucks you in, letting the nuance of the film’s content soak over you. The Dekalog feels like a filmmaker confronting the most significant questions from the history of humanity. Confrontation with moral quandaries, nihilism, the existence of God, and confronting the absurd. The beauty of the film is how it stares in the face of these unanswerable problems, how it refuses to turn away by giving easy answers. Instead, it responds by embracing the absurd, finding a connection with each other within the coldness of the world, of creating our own meaning within the grey uncaring void of the universe. That powerful assertation of subjective humanity makes The Dekalog a masterpiece, a timeless piece of cinema and art. To borrow from Camus, The Dekalog imagines Sysiphus happy despite the eternal curse of his fate, and it asks that we do so as well.\n\n7. Synecdoche, New York (2008) dir. Charlie Kaufman\n\nThis one is not a fun film to watch. Charlie Kaufman’s Synecdoche, New York, is a devastating and challenging film to watch. It tackles the inevitability of death, the sadness of our mortality, and the anxiety and depression that characterize the existence of so many. It is a confusing film, mixing surrealism, absurdism, and incredibly dark comedy in equal measure as it tells the story of a dying theater director, Caden Cottard (played by the legendary Phillip Seymore Hoffman). Caden’s marriage is fractured and distant, a variety of diseases increasingly debilitates him, his friends and relationships leave him unfulfilled, and he has recently received a MacArthur grant and pours the money into a self-inserting theater piece of unprecedented scale.\n\nCharlie Kaufman’s writing has always been remarkably idiosyncratic, and his unique and anxious perspective has never shown through more than here in his directorial debut. It is an exceptionally weird film. Time blurs and folds in on itself. At one point, a woman buys the home that she will die in from a housefire in the future, and the house is already burning slowly. She remarks that she is concerned about the fire, and the real estate agent remarks that it is an incredible opportunity because “not everyone gets to choose how they die.” Caden remarks that it has been a week since his wife left, yet someone else responds that it has been a year. The film’s story begins to eat itself, as the theater production becomes massive in scale, and the actors who have been hired to play the real people in Caden’s life have actors hired to play them playing the real people. It is a strange experience in all regards, one that defies all traditional story logic and plot progression, but that is the point.\n\nIt is Kaufman at his most unrestrained, channeling his existential angst and self-loathing and fear of his mortality into this film. It is composed of hundreds of unique moments, each profound in their own way, yet not seeking to be interconnected. It aims to be a mood piece, capturing the essence of what it feels like to channel yourself into your art and lose yourself in that creation. It is mythic in scale, yet universal in its message. It is one of the most ambitious pieces of art I have ever seen. It could have easily faltered and become pretentious, and perhaps it is anyway. But more than anything, it is aching and alive. It is a battle cry for life itself, a call against inaction, and a pleading to find the beauty even in the misery and pain of life. It may be a challenge, but it is the kind of film that will stick in your mind for weeks after you finish it.\n\n6. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) dir. Michel Gondry\n\nIf you truly loved someone, yet knew the relationship would almost certainly end in heartbreak, would you do it anyway? Is the passion of your love and happiness worth the eventual pain? That is the question that Michel Gondry asks in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It follows Joel (Jim Carrey at his most awkward and emotionally vulnerable), a lonely introvert who meets a girl who is the polar opposite of him, named Clementine (Kate Winslet). They fall in love, then proceed to fall out of love. One day, Joel sees her, and she does not recognize him. She has had a procedure done that erased all memories of him. After researching this procedure, he decides to go through with it as well, to erase the heartbreak he is feeling.\n\nWhat follows is an examination of our human condition, whether it truly is better to have love and lost. It probes into the nature of memory, love, and connection to others. We follow Joel’s trip in his mind through his memories as they are erased, and the dreamlike and surreal imagery highlighting the imperfect nature of consciousness. It is bittersweet, like the way that we can recall a painful memory and laugh despite the pain. The film is beautiful and touching in the way it depicts the beauty and pain of romantic love. It hides neither from us, and at the end of the film, it asks us what we, like Joel and Clementine, would do. There is no perfect choice, but we must learn to live with the pain.\n\n5. Call Me By Your Name (2017) dir. Luca Guadagnino\n\nNo other movie this decade has left an impact on me quite like Call Me By Your Name. Luca Guadagnino adapts Andre Aciman’s novel with a careful touch and precise attention to detail. Focusing on the beauty and impact of first love and of exploring your own identity, Call Me By Your Name subverts so many queer cinema tropes. There is no antagonist here, no bigoted disapproving relatives, only time itself is the enemy. Elio and Oliver only have a short time together, and the film takes its time with their falling in love and subtle flirtation, making us feel the limited time they have and imbuing every moment with precious meaning and emotionality. Timothee Chalamet is transcendent and heartwrenching in the physicality of his performance, while Armie Hammer delivers introspective emotion in every glance and word. This film is perfect in every aspect, demonstrating the power of cinema as a medium. It is so good that I wrote a massive essay diving into the power of the film, Guagagnino’s subtle cinematography and visual storytelling, the performances, and themes. Instead of writing more about it here, I will just link to that: https://medium.com/@danielhassall/the-beauty-and-artistry-of-call-me-by-your-name-18267c6af8b1\n\n4. The Thing (1982) dir. John Carpenter\n\nThe Thing is a timeless piece of horror cinema, not for its perfect scares or slimy practical gore effects, but its suffocating sense of paranoia and claustrophobia. Carpenter wisely leaves the audience in the dark just as much as the characters; we never know who we can trust or who has been replaced by this shapeshifting alien. Everyone is suspicious, and the way that their community of researches falls apart under the weight of their suspicions and existing tensions makes for a riveting watch. Kurt Russell’s MacCready is the perfect horror protagonist, competent yet also wholly outclassed by the threat he faces. The whole cast plays the bewilderment and fear brilliantly, and Carpenter uses their performance to create this permeating sense of danger and dread throughout the entire film. The low electronic score resembles a heartbeat, which makes the monster always feel present, lurking in the background of every scene and around every corner. Carpenter knows how to craft a horror film, slowly ramping up the film’s pace and crafting tense set-pieces with well-utilized jump scares to compliment the sense of paranoia. The setting is perfect for the story, with the suffocating darkness and whipping wind making the characters feel truly isolated and alone. At least, alone from any source of protection or salvation.\n\n3. Seven Samurai (1954) dir. Akira Kurosawa\n\nHow does a film made in 1954 stand out as the greatest that the action genre has to offer, even compared to modern masterpieces with so many more resources at their disposal? Kurosawa’s patience when it comes to pacing and his attention to detail are the keys to making the action as thrilling as it is. He takes so much time establishing the geography of the town that our titular seven samurai are defending that we always know where everything is in relation to the characters, regardless of how chaotic the battle becomes and how many parallel storytelling threads there are. The character’s personalities are so perfectly established and explored by giving each of the major character moments and critical decisions throughout the film so that we never once question their choices, and it seems more like a chess match than a war-time battle.\n\nThe time the film spends explaining battle strategies is a bold choice (in that it adds to an already lengthy runtime) but pays off both because it invests the audience in the macro scale of the battle while also creating more dread and tension by showing the audience how hugely the odds are stacked against our heroes. These little choices, taking the time to plant these details, lay the groundwork for the story to work so efficiently later and creates much of the emotional impact of the film. Seven Samurai is a very lengthy film, clocking in at an intimidating 3 hours 27 minutes, but the pacing is flawless. With so many characters in the cast, and many of them serving as archetypal roles (which are so well done here that they are considered trope today), a great deal of the attachment we develop for these characters comes from the nuances of their performance. Each actor in the film takes the physicality of a typical Kurosawa performance and builds upon it with a great deal of subtlety. Each physical quirk or habitual movement is carefully planted by Kurosawa and the cast to give us insight into who these characters are and what they are feeling. A cast full of Kurosawa regulars such as Mifune, Shimura, Inaba, and Chiaki all conveys so much more with their performances than is there on the page.\n\nUltimately, the quality of the craft of the film, the pacing, perfect action, superb performances, and the careful writing all make Seven Samurai a classic. But this film is more than that. What makes it stand out from other classics? What makes it as heartwrenching, ageless, and powerful is the heart of the film: Kurosawa’s humanism and compassion for his characters. That is the key for all of Kurosawa’s films: he cares for every one of his characters, letting the events of the story probe into their deepest insecurities, without ever losing empathy for them. From Master Shimada’s carefully guarded control over his past trauma and losses to Katsushiro’s deep insecurities about himself and his worth, even the villager’s cowardice and disdain for the samurai is approached from a perspective of understanding. Kurosawa understands that violence is a blade that cuts deep and indiscriminately, traumatizing all it touches. There is no better example of this than Kikuchiyo, whose journey from an egotistical and indulgent braggart to a hero full of righteous anger at the injustice he encounters and empathy for the villagers remains the greatest example of a heroes journey in cinema history.\n\nThe film does not shy away from the sacrifices and losses experienced, even emphasizing the futility of the samurai’s struggle, but it never doubts the necessity of their battle. Even if the villagers are unappreciative, cowardly, and greedy, the samurai recognize the need that they are protected. For better or worse, they are human, like the rest of us, and that alone makes them worth fighting for. This is the real reason Seven Samurai retains its power and impact all these years later. It understands the sacredness of human life, no matter its flaws, and uses this humanism, combined with all-time great technical achievements, to show the audience what Akira Kurosawa believes is worth fighting and dying for: each other.\n\n2. Chinatown (1974) dir. Roman Polanski\n\nChinatown is essentially a perfect movie, one that fires on all cylinders and uses every tool at its disposal to create the best cinematic experience it can. It is so rare to see a movie so adeptly weave and control its narrative, withhold its secrets, foreshadow and set up its twists, and put you in the perspective of its characters. Robert Towne’s script is full of twists and turns as our main character (the hardened, but not as cynical as he would like to be, private detective Jake Gittes) tries to uncover a conspiracy that goes far beyond what he could ever imagine or handle. Yet the film manages to masterfully set up each piece of the puzzle, with minor bits of information or character reactions presented to us without any grandstanding, preventing us from paying too much attention to them until they all click into place for our main character as well. The storytelling is masterful, and for a neo-noir story that plays on the tropes of a very complex genre like Chinatown does, it is not only necessary but works to significant effect.\n\nAs far as Polanski’s direction, it is likewise a masterclass (it is unfortunate that one of the greatest directors of all time also happens to be a total monster, but his skill is undeniable). While not particularly showy, his style is first and foremost functional, with each shot and edit conveying the most possible information about characters, their inner thoughts, relationships and feelings for each other, power dynamics within scenes, etc. The blocking and staging are similarly intricate. And he does all this while crafting shots that are all visually interesting and create an atmosphere of oppressive heat and paranoia, fitting for this story of corruption, crime, and conspiracy set against a hot Los Angeles summer.\n\nIt goes almost without saying that the performances are phenomenal across the board, but I briefly want to mention the two leads, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Both are pitch-perfect. Jack walks around with a specific swagger and charisma that perfectly portray his character’s competence at his job but also overconfidence and complete lack of awareness of the overarching conspiracy until it is all too late. He riffs on the archetype of noir films, the hard-boiled detective. While he may try to be hardened and cynical, instead, you can tell through the nuances of Nicholson’s performance that Gittes cares far more than he lets on or even wants to. Dunaway perfectly embodies someone also attempting to maintain control and composure, as she says what she thinks Gittes needs to hear, trying to control the narrative and protect her secrets yet occasionally cannot help but break composure due to the trauma she has endured. While this could be cheesy, she keeps it restrained enough to be realistic.\n\nOverall, Chinatown is cinematic perfection. It plays with and actively subverts every trope of noir detective films, delivering a white-knuckle thriller with the level of subtext and emotional complexity of a character study thanks to the detail and nuance of the script and direction. It is engaging from the open to the closing shot, with every twist and turn keeping the audience on its toes and the edge of their seats. It is endlessly rewatchable and deserves the highest praise and a place among the greatest of the greats in the cinematic canon.\n\nNo Country For Old Men (2007) dir. The Coen Brothers\n\nAdapted from Cormac McCarthy’s novel, the Coen Brothers No Country For Old Men is an astounding film, and it holds the title of my favorite movie of all time. It is a quiet film, with lengthy stretches without any dialogue and entirely without a musical score. Yet this does not prevent it from being a pulse-pounding thriller or a nuanced examination of the nature of evil. It follows three men: a working-class man named Lewellyn (Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon the remains of a standoff between drug lords, looting a case of money from a corpse, a psychopathic hired killer named Anton Chigurh hired to kill him and retrieve the cash (Javier Bardem), and an aging Sherrif (Tommy Lee Jones) who is merely trying to stop the bloodshed and pick up the pieces. Each represents a worldview of sorts, with Lewellyn representing a modern pragmatism, Chigurh representing a pure, unflinching nihilism and chaos, with Jones taking the perspective of someone who views the world in black and white morality, unable to understand the dark and violent world he now finds himself in.\n\nThe film is brutally tense, with the Coen’s camera controlling the audience’s perspective, planting little details with their precise shot choices, framing, and editing to make every single decision seem inevitable without a word of dialogue. The violence is brutal and chaotic, but the insane and thrilling battles and escapes that make up the cat-and-mouse game that occupies most of the runtime are not the focus of the film. The focus is on how people can adapt to this new world, to overcome the death of traditional morality and cope with the void of meaning they find themselves in. The film is careful not to give any easy answers. Still, the assured hand with which the Coen brothers tackle this subject without ever letting it take away from the efficiency and terror of this lean thriller makes every moment the best possible version of itself. It doesn’t give any answers, nor should it. It leaves its characters questioning as the audience does, simply trying to make sense of it all."
