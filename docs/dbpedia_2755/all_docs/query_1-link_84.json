        "text": "Happy Sunday, everyone! We hope you're having a great summer so far and visiting as many theme parks as possible! (I know we're trying to, lol)\n\nWe did just get back from an awesome trip to Six Flags Great America just outside of Chicago, however, today we wanted to bring you a very special update about one of our home parks: Six Flags Fiesta Texas!\n\nAs you may already know, SFFT announced last year that they planned to add a new Joker themed pendulum swing ride in Summer 2019! And today, that ride opened for technical ride previews! We were amongst the first guests to experience this record-breaking ride and we're very excited to share some details with you!\n\nThe Joker Carnival of Chaos is tied for the tallest and fastest ride of its kind. Created by Zamperla, this swinging thrill ride sends riders to heights of 172-ft and speeds of 75 mph!\n\nThe ride itself was awesome! It gave several different kinds of intense g-forces the entire way through! When swinging forward and back from the air, the ride pushes you to its fastest speed of 75 mph! This experience gives you stronger g-forces since it's pulling you through the pendulum motion. And at the peak? AWESOME AIR TIME! Not to mention, throughout all of this, you're continuously spinning.\n\nAs we mentioned above, The Joker shares those record-breaking stats with 2 other rides of its kind at sister parks in Six Flags Great Adventure and Six Flags Magic Mountain. However, what we have in Six Flags Fiesta Texas that those parks don't is THE SHED!\n\nThe Joker Carnival of Chaos has an AWESOME fun house in the middle of its queue that park-goers and employees have nicknamed the shed. We were excited about what would be in the shed leading up to its opening today, and I have to say, we were not disappointed. We videoed the entire thing if you want to walk through with us below, but if you're like us and want to wait to be surprised on your own walk-through then skip the next video!\n\nIn addition to the new Joker ride, Fiesta Texas also renovated their existing swing ride, Whirligig, into the new appropriately themed Super Villains Swing!\n\nWhile there isn't an elaborate fun house queue for this ride, you can still see villain boards and facts along the way and even banners throughout the entire area that really help tie this new section together.\n\nIn conclusion, this another huge win for Six Flags Fiesta Texas! It's been so exciting as theme junkies to watch this park do such awesome things over the last couple of years. We had first of its kind- Wonder Woman Golden Lasso Coaster, newly renovated and awesomely-themed queue and ride- Pirates of the Deep Sea, and now Joker Carnival of Chaos and Super Villains Swings! We're loving the direction this park is going in, and as always, we can't wait to see what they do next!\n\nSix Flags Fiesta Texas will be running technical ride previews until Carnival of Chaos' official opening in mid-August so make sure you stop by to see The Joker and his villainous friends! ;)"
