        "text": "Joker\n\nScene-By-Scene Breakdown\n\nRebecca Sapolsky\n\ngointothestory.blcklst.com\n\n1 — (over black) news anchor giving the daily update and top story — day 18 of the garbage strike. Zoom in on a man (Arthur Flick, 30’s) putting on clown makeup in a full mirror. He tries to laugh, but tears up. He puts his fingers in the corners of his mouth to put it up into a grin, then pulls them down into an exaggerated frown. Back up into a grin, with a makeup stained tear running down his face.\n\n2- New York City, late 70’s, outside of Kenny’s Music Shop. Arthur’s is now in full clown makeup and costume, dancing and spinning a “Everything Must Go!!” Sign. A live musician plays a somewhat cheery tune on a piano next to him. Pedestrians are walking by and ignoring him. A group of teens insult him, grab his sign, and run down the street. (3) Arthur gives chase, running into traffic and panting heavily. The teens run down an alley. One hits him with the sign, shattering it and knocking Arthur to the ground. They then proceed to beat him up, then run away, leaving Arthur gasping for air and holding himself.\n\n3- Arthur is in the middle of a laughing fit, but there is pain in his eyes and face. He tries to stop laughing several times, but cannot. A social worker (middle-aged woman) waits patiently for him to stop, as if she is used to these fits. When he does stop, he asks “is it me, or is it getting crazier out there?” She responds with a clinical look at the economic depression, but Arthur’s smile says he was looking for a deeper answer. She asks him about his journal. He becomes nervous when she asks to see it. He explains that he’s also been using it as a joke diary for funny thoughts or observations. She opens it to find pornographic images violently scribbled on alongside entries about his hopelessness and his death. She hands back the journal, then asks Arthur if it helps to have someone to talk to. He responds, “I think I felt better when I was locked up in the hospital.” He asks for an increase in his medications, but the social worker reminds him he is on 7 different kinds. He says he doesn’t want to “feel so bad anymore.”\n\n4- Arthur takes the bus home. A small child frowns at Arthur, and Arthur starts to play peek-a-boo with him and makes him laugh. The mother yells at Arthur to stop bothering her child. Arthur goes into one of his laughing fits and hands her a card explaining his neurological condition.\n\n5- He exits the bus to a dirty street in early evening, lined with heaps of garbage bags and enters a run-down looking pharmacy.\n\n6- Arthur walks down a dark alley filled with graffiti, then trudges up a long set of stairs.\n\n7- He walks his block, to enter a large and imposing apartment building.\n\n8- Arthur enters the dreary lobby, and opens a mailbox labeled “P. Fleck”. It is empty.\n\n9- He opens the battered door, throws the small white bag from the pharmacy on the table, then hangs up his coat. Off-screen, his mother (Penny Fleck, 60’s) asks if he’s checked the mail, over the sound of a newscaster reading the headlines. Arthur pulls out three bottles from the white bag and opens them.\n\n10- Arthur carries a tray with dinner to his mother who is watching the news while in bed and in full day-makeup. Penny is concerned that Thomas Wayne, her former long-term employer, hasn’t answered any of her letters. Arthur changes the subject by nudging her to eat. She returns to the topic by saying everyone on the news says Wayne will make a great mayor, a smile spreading on her face. They both then settle down to watch Live with Murray Franklin. The camera zooms in on Arthur’s face as he imagines he is transported to the live set…\n\n11- The small jazz ensemble plays Murray (late 60’s) on, to wild cheers and clapping from the crowd. TURN to Arthur, in the crowd, standing and applauding. BACK TO Murray, who starts his monologue. Arthur laughs his distinctive laugh at one of Murray’s jokes, and yells “I love you, Murray” to which Murray says back “I love you, too.” Murray calls for the lights to come up and Arthur to stand up. They talk back and forth about their mutual growing up in single-parent households, then invites Murray to come down to the stage, where Murray raises his hand and he is given a rousing round of applause by the audience. Murray goes to commercial, then thanks Arthur for sharing his story. He says to Arthur, You see all this, the lights, the show, the audience, all that stuff? I’d give it all up in a heartbeat to have a kid like you” and they embrace.\n\n12- CUT back to Arthur, sitting on the bed with his mother, but still wrapped up in the fantasy.\n\n13, 14- Arthur is in the locker room of his day job, shirtless. He is very thin, and there are noticeable bruises from the beating he received the day before. Randall (mid 50’s) greets the other performers as he walks in with his dry-cleaned costume. He sees Arthur’s bruises and asks if he’s ok. Randall sympathizes with Arthur about how “savages” are making it unsafe on the streets, then hands him a gun to protect himself. Arthur protests, saying he’s not supposed to have a gun. Randall brushes it off, saying “you can pay me back some other time.” Arthur is then called into his boss’s (Hoyt) office by Gary, who is a little person. Randall cracks a joke about his height, and Arthur laughs while walking to Hoyt’s office (while buttoning up his shirt), but then abruptly stops when he turns the corner. Camera turns to follow Arthur into Hoyt’s office. Hoyt engages in 10 seconds of small talk, then tells Arthur he has gotten too many complaints and reprimands him about not returning the sign. Arthur starts to tune him out and a demented smile spreads across his face.\n\n15- Arthur is in the alleyway, violently kicking and stomping the piled-up garbage to vent his frustration. He slumps down on the pavement, hugging his knees into his chest\n\n16- Arthur is slowly trudging up the long stairway to his house.\n\n17- He checks the mailbox. Empty.\n\n18- He enters the elevator, head hanging low. A female voice yells “Wait!” And she stops the door with his foot for his neighbor (Sophie, 20’s). She enters hold a bag of groceries, followed by her daughter (Gigi, 5). There is an uncomfortable silence as the elevator dings for each floor it passes. The elevator slams, shakes, and continues upward. Gigi giggles. Sophie mutters how awful the apartment building is, and Gigi imitates her. Sophie pretends to shoot herself in the head with her fingers while looking at Arthur, who gives her a knowing smile. She smiles back as the elevator dings for their floor and the doors open. Sophie and Gigi exit first, then Arthur, who heads the opposite way. Arthur turns, shouts “hey” to her Sophie’s attention, then does a more violent version of the finger gun to himself. She gives a half-smile, then heads into her apartment.\n\n19- Arthur is giving his mother a bath. She wonders if the mailman is throwing away the letters. Arthur asks why they’re so important. She thinks Thomas Wayne will help them because he “is a good man” and would be sick if he knew how they were living. Arthur tells his mom not to worry about money because his stand-up is ready for the big clubs. She asks him “But, Happy, what makes you think you could do that?… Don’t you have to be funny to be a comedian?”\n\n20- The TV is playing an old black and white movie. Arthur is shirtless and smoking. He fondles the gun on the coffee table in front of him. Arthur aims it at the TV, then an armchair and makes a gunshot noise. He stands up and does a grotesque dance to the music from the TV, with the gun in his hand, pretending to be at a club talking to a woman. He accidentally fires the gun when he aims it at an imaginary rival. He panics and falls to the floor, then scrambles to the TV to turn up the volume in a vain attempt at covering the noise of the gun. It wakes Penny in the next room, who yells to check if Arthur is ok. He tells her it was the war movie on TV, while pacing and gripping his head, and then goes into Penny’s room to apologize.\n\n21- Outside a playground, Arthur is watching Sophie drop Gigi off at school. He tries to hide his face as she exits the school yard.\n\n22- CUT TO: A subway train is pulling into a station. Arthur’s is seen through the cars as they pass, with his hood still up to cover his face.\n\n23- CUT TO: Sophie in one of the cars, sitting and reading a book. Arthur watches her through the window of the next car.\n\n24- Overhead shot of the subway train heading towards downtown Gotham.\n\n25- CUT TO: Sophie walking through the streets, with Arthur following a short distance behind. She enters a large archway. Arthur hesitates, walking back and forth while deciding whether to follow her in.\n\n26- An audience is laughing at a comedian on the stage of a darkened nightclub. He is telling jokes about his sex life with his wife. The camera zooms in on Arthur’s, who is at a table by himself, writing down ideas and laughing at off-moments in the joke.\n\n27- CUT TO: Arthur writing in his journal about mental illness. He is back in his apartment, at night, alone at the kitchen table and smoking, with only the pendant light illuminating him. He writes deliberately and in large letters: ‘People expect you to behave as if you DONT’ with a smiley face in the O of don’t. The doorbell buzzes. It is Sophie, asking if Arthur followed her that day. He hesitates, not knowing what to say, but then says “yeah” with an expectant look on his face. Sophie gives a slight smile and wishes he had robbed the workplace. He says he has a gun and could do it tomorrow. This makes her chuckle and she tells him, “You’re so funny, Arthur.” He tells her he does stand-up and invites her to a show. She says she’d like that and walks away. Arthur has a look of swagger on his face, watches her walk back to her apartment, then shuts the door.\n\n28- A recording of “If you’re happy and you know it” is playing while Arthur, dressed as a clown with a doctor’s coat on, is dancing and pantomiming the words. He is entertaining a children’s ward at the hospital. As he is stomping his feet, his gun comes clattering out of the pants and onto the floor, in front of all the children and staff. He tries to pick it up before anyone notices, but he yelps and kicks it away, drawing more attention to himself and the gun. He hides it in the coat and puts a finger to his lips, as if this is a secret between himself and one other person.\n\n29- Arthur is in a phone booth, talking with Hoyt about why he brought the gun into the hospital. He tries to brush it off as a prop, but Hoyt sees through it. He also says Randall told Hoyt that Arthur tried to buy a gun off of him last week. Hoyt fires him and hangs up. Arthur slams his head into the phone booth glass, smashing it.\n\n30- Arthur is still in full clown makeup and costume (which looks very much like the traditional Joker makeup) on the subway home. Three well-dressed and obviously inebriated men (Wall Street Three) get on the train at the next stop. Two are discussing a woman at the bar, and one offers the only other woman passenger his fries. She is reading a book and trying to ignore them. She says “no, thank you” but he continues to talk to her, with his friends joining in. The first man starts throwing fries at her to get her attention, and she looks at Arthur with a pleading look. He shakes his head and gives a short chuckle, knowing what would happen if he steps in. The three are laughing at the woman, but then turn to Arthur when he starts his distinctive laugh. None of the other passengers know how to react for a few seconds, which gives the woman a chance to walk to the next train car. The Wall Street Three then realize they have a new mark, and start to laugh and sing “Send in the Clowns.” One takes the wig off Arthur’s head, places it on his, and starts mocking his laugh. They confront him, with one grabbing Arthur’s arms and the other punching. Arthur tried to kick him away, but that angers him, and he knocks out Arthur. They start kicking him, much like the teens in the alleyway. A gunshot and one of the Three goes down. Arthur points his gun at another and fires twice. The third starts to run and Arthur fires, but doesn’t kill him. The third one runs to the next car, yelling for help, blood trailing behind him. Arthur is still enraged, but also starts to realize what he’s done and points the gun at his own head. He grabs his bag as they pull into the Ninth Avenue station. Both the third man and Arthur exit their train cars. Arthur follows him as he is limping towards the stairs to the outside. He shoots him in the back, which makes the man fall. Arthur then catches up with him and empties the gun into his body. He has a ringing in his ear (which we hear as well) and keeps repeating “shit” until he starts running up the stairs to excuse what he’s done. He keeps running down an alleyway, under a tunnel, down the street and into a public toilet. He slams the door and hold it closed, expecting someone to be giving chase. He then falls into a reverie, dancing a ballet of sorts under the blinking florescent lights, ending with arms spread and looking at himself in the large dirty mirror.\n\n31- Arthur exits the elevator in his apartment building, tosses his bag aside, knocks on the door of Sophie’s apartment, and when she opens it, he grabs her and kisses her passionately which she returns with equal emotion. The door closes.\n\n32- Arthur is cleaning out his locker at Ha Ha’s while the other employees talk about the murders, which has made the news. Gary tells Arthur he’s sorry he got fired, and Randall agrees, which makes Arthur toss an item angrily over his shoulder. The other clowns chime in, asking him why he would do that and if shooting himself is part of his new act. Arthur tells everyone to ask Randall, since it was his gun. Randall tries to confront Arthur, but he walks away and honks an oversized horn. He returns two seconds later saying he forgot to punch out, and proceeds to punch the time clock off the wall.\n\n32- Arthur takes some of his clown makeup and when he walks by a sign in the stairwell leading from Ha Ha’s that says, “Don’t Forget to Smile!” Crosses out the ‘Forget to’ and trots down the stairwell, kicking the door open on the way out.\n\n33- CUT TO: Arthur’s empty pill bottle scattered on the table, with a news anchor in the background talks about the murder of the Wall Street Three. Arthur dumps out the last two pills from a bottle. On the TV, Thomas Wayne is being interviewed, and Penny asks Arthur to come watch. The Three worked for Wayne. The host then asks Wayne about the growing support of the murderer and the “anti-rich” sentiment that seems to be growing in Gotham. Wayne responds that is why he’s running for mayor, because “Gotham has lost his way.” When asked about the clown mask, he ridicules the idea, saying the murderer was envious of their wealth and cowering behind a mask. Arthur leans back on the sofa, his legs jittering, and lets out a short laugh. Penny tells him it’s not funny.\n\n34- Arthur is at his weekly session with his social worker. He talks about a song he heard the other day, about a man named Carnival which is ironic to him because his clown name at work is Carnival. He starts to tell her about how he never felt seen and he doubt his own existence, but she interrupts him to say she has bad news to tell him. He doesn’t acknowledge that, but just keeps going saying she doesn’t listen to him and asks the same questions every week without ever really hearing him. Arthur then tells her very seriously and methodically that he does exist and that “people are starting to notice.” She tells him that funding has been cut and the offices are being closed. This is their last meeting. Arthur’s only response is “okay.” She drops her clinical persona to say the powers that be don’t give a shit about him or her. His only response is to ask how he will get his medication now.\n\n35- CUT TO: the closed-circuit TV in the back room of Pogo’s comedy club, showing the current act on stage. Arthur is pacing nervously in the narrow hallway, looking over his notebook of jokes and ideas. He starts his slow walk to the stage, up a narrow stairwell lit by red lights. We hear the comic thank the audience, to laughs and applause from the audience. Arthur is introduced to the crowd and he walks on to polite applause. He grins and lets out a big sigh, clearly nervous. He then starts his nervous laugh and tries to get out “hello, it’s good to be here” but laughs even more and bends over with his back to the audience to try to stop the laughter. The audience makes no noise while he tries to get out the first joke and nearly chokes on his own laughter. There are a few small chuckles, and we see Sophie in the crowd, smiling. He points to her, then leafs through his notebook, where the audience can see some of the pornographic images he glued in. The song “Smile” starts playing over his words, and all we hear is laughter and applause from the crowd, Sophie included. Arthur looks pleased.\n\n36 — Arthur is walking through a crowded street with Sophie while “Smile” still plays. Arthur stops at a newsstand when he sees a headline “Killer Clown On The Loose” with a drawing of a grotesque clown with jagged, sharp teeth. He imitates the toothy grin from the drawing. Sophie comes to his side and says the guy who did it is a hero. “Three less pricks in Gotham City, only a million more to go” which makes Arthur smile, until he sees a taxi drive by with a passenger wearing a clown mask, and he smiles for a different reason.\n\n37- CUT TO: a donut shop, with Sophie and Arthur inside. Sophie is laughing and Arthur is enthralled with her.\n\n38- Arthur enters his apartment. ‘Live with Murray Franklin’ is ending broadcast for the night Arthur dances around to the music, even picking up his mother who had fallen asleep in front of the TV. Arthur tells his mom he had a big date. She asks him to mail her latest letter to Thomas Wayne. Curiosity gets the better of Arthur and he opens it to read what it says. The words that come into focus are “Dearest Thomas” and “I realize this might open me up to ridicule but I need your help. Your son and I need your help.” He scans the rest of the letter, then glares at the TV.\n\n39- Penny slams his bedroom door on Arthur, begging him to stop being angry. He speaks to her in his practiced calm voice to get her to talk to him. She said they were in love, but couldn’t be together “because of appearances.” She says she couldn’t tell anyone because she “signed some papers” and that people would talk about all of them.\n\n40- Arthur is riding the commuter train with lots of men in suits reading the paper. He tears out the photo of Wayne and his family alongside the announcement of his campaign for mayor, and tucks it into his journal.\n\n41- We see Arthur walking along behind a stone wall. He spots a young boy (Bruce Wayne, 10) standing in a gazebo by himself. Arthur slowly shrinks down behind the wall, then pops back up again with a red clown nose on. He resumes walking again, making eye contact with Bruce, who follows him out along the wall towards the gate. Arthur appears with a magic wand, and pretends that the wand isn’t working. He hands Bruce the wand, which goes limp in his hand. He hands it back to Arthur, who “fixes” it. Arthur does a little tap dance, then waves the wand at Bruce and flowers appear from the end of the wand. He hands them to Bruce again, the kneels down up against the gate. He introduces himself to Bruce and Bruce tells him his name. Arthur grabs Bruce’s face through the bars and pushes his mouth into a grim smile. A butler (Alfred Pennyworth, 50’s) runs up, grabbing Bruce away from Arthur. Arthur says they have nothing to worry about and he’s there to see Mr. Wayne. Alfred gives back the wand/flowers to Arthur telling him it’s not funny. Arthur tells him his mother worked for Wayne and her name is Penny Fleck. Alfred’s voice changes, becomes softer, and says “you are her son.” Arthur says he knows everything about them, but Alfred draws closer and tell Arthur they were not together, and she was delusional. Alfred laughs when Arthur insists that Wayne is his father, then grabs him around the throat, choking Alfred. He lets go when he locks eyes with a frightened Bruce, then runs.\n\n42- Arthur is walking down the street to his apartment building when he realizes his mother is being taking out on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. The EMTs try to ask him questions while trying to resuscitate her, but he goes silent.\n\n43- Arthur is outside the hospital, smoking. Two detectives approach him, addressing him by his last name. They tell Arthur they asked Penny a few questions and she became hysterical. They ask him about bringing the gun to the children’s hospital and why he got fired. He tells the detectives he was told he wasn’t funny enough. He tells them he has to go back in to tend to his mother, but before he can go in, they ask if his laughing condition is real. He says, “what do you think” and slams into the Exit Only door, and finally gets into the building.\n\n44- Arthur and Sophie are at Penny’s bedside. Penny has numerous machines and a ventilator hooked up to her. Sophie tells Arthur that Penny will be ok. She kisses Arthur on the forehead, then walks out to get them two coffees. Murray is on TV, and Arthur leans forward to grab his mother’s hand and watch. Murray shows an amateur video of Arthur’s act at Pogo’s. Murray calls him some kind of joker. Arthur laughs at himself telling the jokes, but we don’t hear the crowd laughing.\n\nMurray makes fun of him and turns him into a joke on his monologue. Arthur’s face turns into pain and simmering rage.\n\n45- CUT TO: Arthur laying in his mother’s bed at home, listening to the TV news headlines, surrounded by his cigarettes, the gun, and the newspaper from the newsstand. He sits up and pays attention when he hears about the protestors dressing up like clowns, and rallying outside of Wayne Hall. Thomas Wayne’s soundbite is a condescending view of the protestors, ending with “I’m their only hope.”\n\n46- Arthur wanders into the protest in front of Wayne Hall, surrounded by people in clown makeup. A fight breaks out between the protestors and police, which gives Arthur the chance to duck under the barricades and into the Hall.\n\n47- Arthur emerges from an interior door wearing an usher’s uniform.\n\n48 — He enters a packed auditorium of people in black-tie, where they are watching a Charlie Chaplin in “Modern Times.” He loses himself in the moment until the audience laughs. He scans the crowd until he finds Wayne and his family in one of the boxes. When Wayne gets up, Arthur runs up the stairs to try to find him.\n\n49- Wayne is in the men’s room. Arthur enters and takes off his uniform. He tries to talk to Wayne but tells him “I don’t know what to say.” Wayne chuckles and says, “do you want an autograph or something?” When Wayne goes to the sink, he can see in the mirror that Arthur has moved up behind him. Arthur introduces himself and Wayne recognizes his name from the incident at the house the previous day. Wayne chuckles at him and says “I’m not your father. You were adopted and I never slept with your mother.” Wayne then says Penny was committed to Arkham Asylum when Arthur was a little boy, which sets off Arthur. Wayne says, “she’s crazy” and Arthur goes into a laughing fit. When Arthur won’t stop laughing, Wayne punches him in the nose and as he walks away, says if he touches his son again, he’ll kill Arthur.\n\n50- CUT TO: Arthur leaning on the sink in his apartment. The phone rings, but the answering machine clicks on. Detective Garrity leaves a message asking Arthur to call him while Arthur empties out the refrigerator of food and eventually the shelves as well. Arthur then climbs in and shuts the fridge door behind him. The phone rings again, but now\n\n51- Arthur is laying in bed listening for the message on the machine. It’s Shirley Woods, who is trying to book Arthur on Murray Franklin’s show. Arthur looks skeptical, but agrees to go on the show.\n\n52- Arthur is riding at the back of a bus, the back window covered in graffiti.\n\n53- He crosses the street to Arkham State Hospital\n\n54- Arthur is riding in an elevator with a man who is tied down to a stretcher, screaming and thrashing. Music is playing so we don’t hear the screams.\n\n55- Arthur is waiting in a yellow hallway while the clerk (Carl, 30’s) searches for records Arthur asks for. Arthur asks how someone ends up in Arkham. Carl answers that some have committed crimes, some are crazy, and some just have nowhere else to go. Arthur says he understands, and that he’s done some “bad shit” lately and really doesn’t feel badly about it. As Arthur keeps talking, Carl becomes more alarmed and tells him maybe he should get some help through city services. Arthur turns his hand into a puppet and says in a high voice “They cut all those.” Carl finally finds Penny’s file in the box. He reads her diagnosis from the file: delusional psychosis and narcissistic personality disorder, and found guilty of endangering the welfare of her own child. Carl pauses and looks at Arthur, but won’t tell him what else is written in the file. He cannot release the file to Arthur, so he grabs the file through the slot in the grated window and headbutts the window to startle Carl, who lets go of the file. Arthur runs down the hall, and into the stairwell. He pauses a few flights down to see if anyone is following him. No one is, so he opens the file. He focuses on the words “extremely bizarre behavior” and “physical abuse.” Arthur then finds the adoption application with a voice-over from the doctor who diagnosed her, reminding her that she did adopt Arthur. She said Wayne did it to keep their child a secret. The doctor confronted her with the physical abuse of Arthur and herself from a boyfriend. Arthur also finds newspaper clippings about the abuse. Young Penny says she never heard him cry. Arthur starts to laugh, but it then turns into crying.\n\n56- Arthur walks through the pouring rain to his building.\n\n57- He enters the elevator, and thinks back to the first interaction with Sophie, where she puts her fingers to her head and pretends to shoot.\n\n58- Arthur walks to Sophie’s door, opens it, and walks through her apartment, touching her belongings. Sophie is settling Gigi down to bed, and gasps when she sees Arthur sitting on her sofa. She demands to know why he’s there and that he’s in the wrong apartment. He is acting catatonic. She asks him if his name is Arthur and that he needs to leave. She is scared. She asks if she can call his mother, if she’s home. Arthur looks at Sophie, like he doesn’t understand why she would ask that. He then puts his fingers to his head, and flashes back to all the times she was with him but we see she really wasn’t.\n\n59- He storms out of Sophie’s apartment, marching down to his own.\n\n60- Arthur is dry now, and in the middle of a laughing fit mixed with crying.\n\n61- Arthur is back at his mother’s side in the hospital. He confronts her while she is still incapacitated, calling her Penny. He says the laughing condition is the real him. He stands up and walks over to her, telling her he used to think his life was a tragedy, but it’s really a fucking comedy. He takes the pillow from behind Penny’s head and suffocates her. He turns to face the sun streaming through the window.\n\n62- Murray Franklin’s intro music plays over the TV, but then stops and is rewound. Arthur is studying how guests enter through the curtain so that he can practice his entrance, and then his interview with Murray. He goes over and over it, making adjustments. He starts to tell a knock-knock joke, and pulls a gun from his waistband, and pretends to shoot himself to imagined applause. With his head fallen back, he has a look of peace on his face that hasn’t been seen the whole movie.\n\n63- As Murray’s theme song “That’s Life” plays, Arthur dyes his hair green and dances around his bathroom in his underwear, triumphantly.\n\n64- He meticulously applies his clown make-up.\n\n65- Arthur studies a photo of young Penny, with the words “Love your smile… -TW” on the back. He crushes it up and throws it down.\n\n66- The music dies down to a background song from the radio. The doorbell buzzes several times. Arthur searches the bureau for something, and grabs a pair of scissors from a drawer, then goes to answer the door.\n\n67 — Randall and Gary are at the door. Arthur welcomes them in. They ask him why he’s wearing clown makeup. He tells them his mom died and he’s celebrating. He also tells them he’s stopped taking his medication. Randall says they came because the detectives have been talking to him and he wants to know what Arthur told them because they’re friends. Arthur slips the scissors from his pocket and stabs Randall in the throat and in the eye, then throws him against the wall and slams his head against it several times. Gary is sobbing and asking him why. Arthur’s white makeup is splattered in blood. He tells Gary about going on the Murray Franklin show that night. Gary keeps asking why, and Arthur tells him he can leave. Gary starts to walk by him, but Arthur jumps at his as a joke and Gary runs to the door. The chain is on, so he keeps struggling to get out and politely asks Arthur to help him. Before he opens the door, Arthur tells Gary he was the only one who was ever nice to him, then kisses him on the head and lets him leave.\n\n68- Rock ’n’ Roll (Part 2) plays as Arthur walks down the hall. He enters the elevator and turns to reveal the full costume and makeup of the Joker.\n\n69- He struts and dances down the long staircase he has been trudging up every other time we’ve seen him. The rock and roll anthem slowly fades into a more sinister orchestral song. The detectives are watching him from the top of the stairs and they shout for him to stop for some questions. He runs and they follow.\n\n70- He runs down the street, trying to avoid them. But he does not see the taxi headed towards him and is hit, cracking the windshield. He tumbles off and keeps running. They all run up the El stairs. He jumps on the train that is departing the station, surrounded by many others in clown costumes headed for the protest. The detectives reach the train, demanding it be opened. They get in and try to find Arthur on the crowded train. Arthur starts a fight on the train and steals a clown mask from a passenger. He tries to back away into the crowd, but the detective keeps his gun trained on him. A random passenger grabs the gun and it goes off into the passenger, which causes the other passengers to attack the detectives and let Arthur get away, but not before doing a little dance at them.\n\n71- Arthur walks with purpose and authority down the subway station hallway while police run towards the violence.\n\n72- People are lined up outside the Live with Murray Franklin theater.\n\n73- The news in on the TV in the green room. Arthur watches while in front of a makeup mirror. He’s written ‘Put on a happy face’ on the mirror in lipstick. Murray and his producer (Gene, 50’s) enter to talk about the show. Gene keeps telling Murray this is a bad idea. When Murray asks Arthur is wearing the makeup, Arthur says he doesn’t know anything about the protests and is wearing it because it’s good for his act. Murray downplays Gene’s concerns and says they’ll go ahead with the segment. Murray goes over the rules of being a guest, and before he leaves, Arthur asks him to call him Joker because that’s what Murray called him on the show. Murray agrees. Arthur reclines in the makeup chair, holding the cocked gun up to his chin.\n\n74- Murray is talking to Dr. Sally, then segue into again showing the clip of Arthur at Pogo’s while Arthur is smoking backstage. He does not look nervous like he did before.\n\n75- Arthur does a slow dance while waiting for the curtains to part. Murray tried to diffuse the potentially explosive situation over Arthur’s makeup by saying everyone on the show is sorry about what is happening, but everyone could use a good laugh.\n\n76- Joker comes on with a flourish, dancing and spinning his way over to Murray. He kisses Dr. Sally on the lips and sits down. When Murray says, “that was quite an entrance,” there is silence from Arthur and nervous laughter from the audience. Arthur finally speaks: “This is exactly how I imagined it.” Murray asks Joker to explain his outfit, and to confirm that it’s not a political statement. Joker agrees and says he’s trying to make people laugh. Murray asks how that’s working out for him and Joker goes into his distinctive laugh, but is able to control it and stops abruptly. Murray asks if he’d like to tell a joke and the audience applauds. Joker pulls out the journal. He pauses on the quote from the beginning of the movie: “I hope my death makes more cents than my life” which makes him pause. Murray jokes about him not talking, and Joker says “ok, here’s one. Knock, knock.” It’s a joke about a death, and the trombone player plays “wah, waaaah” but Dr. Sally admonishes him for telling a joke like that, and Murray agrees with her. Joker apologizes and says it’s been a rough few weeks since he killed the Wall Street Three. The audience gasps. Murray says he’s waiting for the punchline, but Joker says he’s serious. Gene is off-camera and motioning for the segment to end. Murray frowns at Joker and demands to know why they should believe him. Joker says he has nothing left to lose and nothing can hurt him anymore. He says killing the men was funny and that comedy is subjective. Murray questions whether Joker started this movement to become a symbol, and Joker retorts with “do I look like the kind of clown that could start a movement.” He killed them because they were awful and everyone is awful, and it’s enough to make anyone crazy. He starts ranting about they mattered, but he doesn’t and has always been ignored, and that Thomas Wayne hadn’t talked about them on TV, it wouldn’t have mattered. That Thomas Wayne expects everyone to listen and obey him. Murray admonishes him and tells him not everyone is awful. Joker stares through him and tells him he is awful because he played the video and invited him on the show only to make fun of him. Murray says he’s the awful one because he caused the riots, he’s caused people to go to the hospital and get killed. Then Joker asks to tell one more joke. He then screams at Murray and shoots him in the head. The audience is screaming and he laughs. He stands up, shoots him in the chest, then paces and turns it into a little jig. He then goes down to the camera, and says Murray’s closing catchphrase into it: “Good night. And always remember, that’s…” then dead air. Which pans back to\n\n77- all the broadcast coverage of Murray’s death and the aftermath of rioting.\n\n78- a police car is driving with Arthur in the back seat admiring and laughing at all the carnage happening on the streets. Rioting. Fires. Looting. The police officers tell him to shut up and call him a freak. Joker says, “isn’t it beautiful?” Arthur’s head smashing into the glass separating him from the front seat. An ambulance plows into the side of the police car, which sets off the rioters even more. A person in a clown mask exits the front seat of the ambulance, looking into the back seat of the police car. Another clown protestor joins the first and the recognize Joker from his TV appearance. They gently pull him through the broken window and place him on the hood of the police car. He appears to be dead.\n\n79- Citizens are trying to make their way out of the theater and through the streets as rioters run through, smashing things and starting fires. We come upon Thomas Wayne and his family, trying to hurry away from all the protestors. Thomas leads them down an alleyway.\n\n80- A protestor in a clown mask follows them. He tells Wayne “you get what you fucking deserve” and shoots him in the chest. Martha Wayne screams. She gets shot and the protestor grabs her pearl necklace as she falls to the ground. Bruce watches all this happen.\n\n81- Joker comes to, coughing up blood. He looks around at the mayhem and all the rioters asking him to get up. They cheer for him as he stands on the hood of the car. He poses and dances for them and for himself as they cheer and applaud. He feels the blood coming out of his nose and mouth, then pulls his lips into his characteristic grin, which makes the crowd go even wilder. He tears up, feeling loved for the first time.\n\n82- He poses, as if a symbol or statue for all the masses, while the crowd cheers for him. FADE TO BLACK, but Joker is laughing.\n\n83- Arthur is having a laughing fit. He is in Arkham Asylum, in an all-white room with the social worker. She asks, “what’s so funny?” He says he’s thinking of a joke while\n\n84- we are shown an image of Bruce Wayne, standing in the alleyway next to the bodies of his parents.\n\n85- She asks what is it, but he says, “you wouldn’t get it.” Arthur starts whisper-singing ‘That’s Life’.\n\n86- Arthur is walking down the hall, leaving bloody footprints behind him. He starts to dance to the song in his head. He turns a corner, but then runs the other way, pursued by an orderly.\n\nTHE END"
