        "text": "So we are already into the second half of the year (time flies) and we’ve already seen a few very interesting new releases. While not as exciting as this time last year in my opinion, there has been some films that are very worthy of discussion. Some of these were actually released during the festival circuit last year, but they entered major distribution this year – the only exception to this criteria I’m not including is “Birds of Passage”, which I actually caught mid summer last year in my home country, and since it was our net at the Oscars for 2018 I still consider it a 2018 release. Also, I’m mainly considering films that were released from January to June, so no “Midsommar” (which sadly hasn’t been released yet where I live). I also haven’t been able to watch “Toy Story 4” yet, but from what I’ve heard it might be the only fourth part in a movie franchise that is actually good.\n\nAnyway, usually I would now talk about some honourable mentions, but I don’t think I’ve seen enough films this year that deserve this categorization to actually make a whole session. There are still, however, a couple that were or almost were pretty good and I’ll discuss them briefly: “Brightburn” – some great acting and cool scenes, but ultimately disappointing considering the potential of its premise, needed to flesh out Brandon’s character more; “The Beach Bum” – unique, funny and some times straight up outrageous, while boasting an excellent performance by Matthew McConaughey but kind of feels hollow at the end (though you could argue it was done in purpose to reflect the main character); “Booksmart” – probably gonna get criticized for this, but this movie didn’t do much for me, it’s well vast and Olvia Wilde does a great job directing, but the humour was very hit and miss and for all its progressive ideas it does lack nuance ; and of course there’s “Avengers: Endgame”, which I reviewed earlier, a film that brings the Infinity Saga to an end, but also goes a little too much into nostalgic territory (albeit doing it right for the most part), and it takes Marvel’s greatest villain and doesn’t do him enough justice. Also, for kids stuff I really enjoyed both “Shazam!” And ” Detective Pikachu”.\n\nOkay, so with that out of the way, let’s get started with the top 10 Films of the first half of 2019:\n\n10. The Dead Don’t Die (Jim Jarmusch)\n\nAn excellent cast and a very talented auteur at the helm, even with all its great moments one can’t help but feel somewhat disappointed by Jarmusch’s latest film. A zombie flick doesn’t sound like your standard material for an indie director, but after what he did with vampires in “Only Lovers Left Alive” I had high hopes for this. It tells the story of a zombie outbreak from the perspectives of several residents in a small town. It has some very hilarious scenes, there ‘s some unexpected stuff going on, and it’s wonderful cast all give excellent performances all around. The thing is, the film has too many characters for a runtime of around 100 minutes. You could cut out a couple of the subplots to better focus on some of the most interesting characters (I’d day Driver, Murray, Swinton and Waits were the most interesting aspects), or alternatively make the film’s run to be up to two hours maybe, and you’d have a better movie all around. Regardless, the film is a very entertaining piece and does deserve your time.\n\n9. The Perfection (Richard Sheppard)\n\nPerhaps somewhat ironically, “The Perfection” is far from perfect. A psychosexual thriller about musical prodigees years after they’ve left a shady music academy. The film seems that it kind of struggles to decide what type of story it wants to be, it twists and turns in many unexpected ways, some lackluster but some devilishly good. I’ve seen people criticize this film because it isn’t “realistic”, but this isn’t the type of movie you should judge on its level of realism. It is convoluted and far fetched, but it still does achieve what it sets out to do: to be a disturbing and provocative mindf*ck of a movie. Also, Allison Williams’ performance deserves a shout out. It has tonal and pacing issues (another example of a film that could’ve benefited from an extra 10-15 minutes), and like I said it is somewhat convoluted, but as a thriller in the vein of Korean revenge cinema Italian giallos I’d say it is pretty effective. Again, not necessarily a “great” film, but the only reason it sits above “The Dead Don’t Die” is that it doesn’t have a proven outstanding director from whom you’d expect more.\n\n8. Monos (Alejandro Lanés)\n\nI may not be considering “Birds of Passage” as an entry for this year, but Colombia has another great recent film among its ranks that hopefully sparks some attention. It tells the story of a group of youngsters in a mountain terrain far away from civilization, being trained and indoctrinated to fight an illegal war. The film never specified if they belong to the guerrillas or the paramilitary organizations, and I liked it all the more for not taking a political stance. The film is a surreal fever dream, a descent into he’ll well within the Colombian jungles. The imagery is beautiful and brutal, the sound design is extremely immersive, the story is great throughout and the actors all give their best. If I had to signal one flaw it’d be some of the character’s lack of characterisation, but I’d say it’s not a big issue. I caught the film at the Berlinale earlier this year, and I’d recommend to anyone to go out and see it, the future of Colombian cinema seems bright.\n\n7. The Miracle at the Sargasso Sea (Syllas Tzoumerkas)\n\nAnother film I caught at this year’s Berlinale, a Greek mystery film with its surrealist moments and an appeal in the tradition of the country’s Greek wave. It tells the story of a detective, played by the great Ageliki Papoulia, who is transferred from Athens to a small coastal town, where, many years later, she must solve the apparent suicide of a local musician, for which she must uncover some of the town’s disturbing secrets. It is a complex film with several heavy topics, but it managed to handle them (mostly) with great care and respect. Papoulia gives an excellent performance in the central role, and her character offers perhaps a new heroine mould in this sort of surrealistic neo-noir genre. I’d say the film’s major weaknesses are its first scene (which isn’t particularly bad but it feels from another movie altogether) and it’s last (which kind of robs the ambiguity of the main character’s arc), but all in all a pretty good and well made film, alas I’d hesitate to recommend it since it is a hard watch and may play out more as an acquired taste.\n\n6. I Am Mother (Grant Sputore)\n\nAs you may know, I’m a big fan of thought provoking science fiction, and this year’s “I Am Mother” offers exactly that. It tells of an A.I. known as “Mother” (voiced by Rose Byrne), which is activated one day after an extinction event that wiped out humanity, and is tasked to raise a new generation of humans. Years pass and a new offspring, simply known as “Daughter” (Clara Ruggard) starts her path into adolescence, when a mysterious woman (Hilary Swank) appears, meaning that Daughter is in fact not the only human alive, what leads her to ask questions about the nature of her situation. This film poses all sorts of philosophical and ethical questions, is tense and thrilling, extremely well executed, perfectly acted and it develops into very unpredictable territory. Ruggard gives a breakthrough performance, and both Swank and Byrne deserve major recognition for their roles. If you’re a fan of thought provoking science fiction that’s also thrilling and narratively compelling you should check this one out.\n\n5. Her Smell (Alex Ross Perry)\n\nA musical drama starring Elisabeth Moss as a troubled rockstar whose self-destructive behaviour compromises her career and personal relationships. A relatively small film, it is in reality a very compelling and at times heart breaking narrative, even if it steps sometimes into melodrama territory. Elisabeth Moss gives what is perhaps the best performance of her career as the troubled Becky, a towering shift that’ll sadly get ignored in the award season since this is a low profile film. The music is pretty great, some sort of mid 2000s rock-pop mixed with some sentimental ballades for good meassure. I once saw a film by Perry starring Moss as well at a film festival (“Queen of Earth”), and after finding out that there was a new collaboration between the two I decided I had to watch it as soon as possible, and I’ve gotta say that “Her Smell” not only lived up to that expectation but also surpassed it.\n\n4. Us (Jordan Peele)\n\nJordan Peele follows up his breakout hit “Get Out” with another smart horror filled with tons of social commentary. Lupita N’yongo stars as Adelaide, a woman who years ago had a disturbing encounter at a house of mirrors at the beach in Santa Cruz as a kid. Now, years later, she and her family visit Santa Cruz again, only to be met by doppelgängers, dark reflections of themselves. Peele’s sophomore effort solidifies him as a true talent to be reckoned with, showing his mastery of the genre and his ability to handle complex social issues. Unlike “Get Out”, which is pretty straight forward with its commentary, I’d argue that in “Us” it is left somewhat more ambigous, albeit such an ambitious and complicated project does leave a sense that it’s reach extended its grasp. I’d argue that his first film is a much tighter outing that knows and embraces its limitations, whereas “Us” does suffer a little from being too ambitious. Regardless, it is still an excellent horror film that comments on the american reality and issuses such as inequality, social mobility and gaining social status at the expense of others.\n\n3. Ash is the Purest White (Jia Zhangke)\n\nI came into this film expecting a gangster/crime drama from a chinese perspective, but what I got was something much more rewarding. It tells the story of Qiao, whose boyfriend Bin is a mob boss with a lot of influence. One night, a biker gang attacks them in attempt to dethrone Bin, so Qiao steps in, firing a gun into the sky, what scares them off but also calls the attention of the police; Qiao is arrested. She’s released after five years and here’s where the real drama begins: we see from her perspective how she’s unable to adapt to a rapidly changing world. China’s development as a country has been one of the fastest ones in history, and this film thematizes that with particular care for the people who aren’t really able to keep up. If anything, the film plays out like a gangster film for the first 30 minutes, but afterwards it becomes a deeply personal drama about this woman trying to understand this world. A character study which pays careful attention to the small nuances of interpersonal relationships in such an environment, which effectively shows why Zhangke is one of China’s most celebrated modern auteurs.\n\n2. Long Day’s Journey into Night (Bi Gan)\n\nThe director of 2015’s surprise film “Kaili Blues” is back with another exploration of cinematic time that boasts great technical prowess. The film tells the story of a man who returns to his home town for the funeral of his father, while reminiscing about an old friend called Wildcat, and starts searching for a long lost love. This film had a particularly interesting marketing campaign in China: it was released at New Year’s eve and it was marketed as the ultimate romantic film, with special interest on the final scene as the clock would strike midnight and signal the beginning of 2019. It became the highest grossing opening for a chinese film, yet the box office returns decreased afterwards because, as it turns out, the film was something completely different to what was marketed. Viewers expecting a romantic drama were flabbergasted by an out of the ordinary and far from straight forward art film that played with time perception and memory. The last hour of the film is a single continous shot that flies through different locations, meetings with characters from different eras, and defies traditional story expectations. This final sequence alone makes it worth while, if anything because of the great technical aspect (not to mention its in 3D), but also how the film handles its themes and the particular way it tells its story makes this an unforgetable film experience.\n\n1. High Life (Claire Denis)\n\nIn what is perhaps my favourite film of the year as of now, Claire Denis directs a talented cast that includes Juliette Binoche, Robert Pattison and Mia Goth in a nightmarish mix of science fiction, horror and art house sensibilities. A group of criminals are sent to space as a punishment in a mission to harvest energy from a black hole. Unbeknownst to them, they are there to be used as guinea pigs for sexual and reproductive experimentation, in an effort by Dr. Dibs (Binoche) to achieve artificial insemination. This is a very disturbing film that may appear inaccesible at first (for the first 40 minutes or so I was struggling to understand what the hell was going on), but once you get a semblance of an idea for what is happening things will start falling into place. The film is full of surreal and nightmarish sequences that make it unforgettable. The performances are all around great, Goth demonstrating she’s excellent for such dark tales as she did in “Nymphomaniac”, “The Survivalist” and last year’s “Suspiria”, and Pattison keeps solidifying his status as an indie star (which does give hope for the future Batman). But of course, the MVP of the picture is Juliette Binoche, twisted as she is sensous, disturbing yet oddly charming, stealing the spotlight in every scene she’s in. Claire Denis has crafted one of the most unforgettable films of the year, bringing her talent and unique vision to the science fiction genre, the result being what could be this year’s best.\n\nSo there you have it.

Also, check out my Letterboxd to see this list develop as the year goes by and I watch newer films. Here’s to hoping that the second half of 2019 brings even more great films. Until next time!\n\nIts been over a year since I tackled the arguably 20 Best Science Fiction Films of All Time, so perhaps its a very good time to revisit the genre and talk about the best that the present century has to offer. Being a genre that intrinsically works thematically with human’s relationship to technology, as our own technological development continues to grow so does our understanding of our relationship towards it, as well as our own fears and desires with regards to it. Also, the evolution of science and our comprehension of the universe as a whole and our place within it brings up a series of complicated questions that genre has widely speculated about. For the last two decades science fiction cinema has delved into many of these issues, and many others as well relevant to our present day. Let’s take a look at what could very well be the 10 best science fiction films this 21st century has to offer.\n\nHonourable mentions: “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence” (Steven Spielberg, 2001), “Donnie Darko” (Richard Kelly, 2001), “Minority Report” (Steven Spielberg, 2002), “Time of the Wolf” (Michael Haneke, 2003), “Serenity” (Joss Whedon, 2005), “A Scanner Darkly” (Richard Linklater, 2006), “Man from Earth” (Richard Schenkman, 2007), “Wall-E” (Andrew Stanton, 2008) “The Road” (John Hillcoat, 2009), “Inception” (Christopher Nolan, 2010), “Planet of the Apes” reboot (Ruppert Wyatt – Matt Reeves, 2011 – 2017), “Looper” (Rian Johnson, 2012), “Cloud Atlas” (Wachowskis – Tom Tykwer, 2012), “Upstream Color” (Shane Garruth, 2013), “The World’s End” (Edgar Wright, 2013), “Snowpiercer” (Bong Joon-ho, 2013) “Interstellar” (Christopher Nolan, 2014), “Mad Max: Fury Road” (George Miller, 2015), “Blade Runner 2049” (Dennis Villeneuve, 2017), “Annihilation” (Alex Garland, 2018)\n\n10. Hard to be a God (Aleksei German, 2013)\n\nKicking off the list we have a russian black-and-white film based on a novel written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky (the writers behind the story that inspired Tarkovsky’s “Stalker”), directed by the late Alekei German. Bleak and very brutal, the film tells of a group of Earth scientists that travel to a planet similar to our own with the difference that they are perpetually stuck in the middle ages. The population has prevented the rise of the rennaissance by brutally murdering anyone with intellectual leanings. The plot is hard to follow on first viewing, but the stark cinematography creates a unique visual style that, coupled with a bleak yet thought-provoking narrative, make for a very unforgettable viewing experience.\n\n9. District 9 (Neil Blomkamp, 2009)\n\nA film that utilizes its allegorical nature to touch on real world issues like racism and Apartheid. Set in Johannesburg, where 30 years prior an alien spacecraft landed carrying several malnourished extraterrestrials, who are then relocated by the South African governement to an area known as District 9, a slum where unrest and tensions towards the alien population will grow over the years. The protagonist is Wikus (played by an excellent Sharlto Copley), who during a search of an alien home accidentally sprays himself with a mysterious substance that slowly starts turning his biology into that of the aliens. For a film released about a decade ago the visuals hold up today surprisingly well, Blomkamp’s direction is excellent from start to finish and the social commentary, while not really that subtle, remains sharp and relevant even today.\n\n8. Arrival (Dennis Villeneuve, 2016)\n\nDennis Villeneuve’s 2016 “Arrival” gives a unique spin to the classic genre. In the film twelve mysterious spacecrafts arrive on different points of the planet, but the aliens aren’t here to conquer or wage war against humanity, they are here to open a communication channel. Of course, to communicate with an alien species with their own understanding of language is not going to be easy, so the U.S. army employs linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) to try to overcome this language barrier. The film tackles a variety of complex topics such as language, human communication and the nature of time. Villeneuve shows off his expertise as a director and storyteller, developing new aisles in a genre that he handles with utmost respect.\n\n7. Her (Spike Jonze, 2013)\n\nSpike Jonze’s “Her” is a love story for the technological era. It follows Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), a lonely man who works writing letters of personal nature for people who find this difficult and is in the middle getting divorced from his wife (Rooney Mara). He installs an AI that names itself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johanson), which has the ability to develop emotionally and psychologically. After bonding and finding in Samantha a connection that he seldom finds in other people, Theodore soon falls in love with his AI and the two start a relationship. This is a film that delves into human emotions and interpersonal relationships, about the loneliness and isolation of an ever changing world, anchored by an excellent performance by Phoenix and great voice talent by Johannson.\n\n6. Moon (Duncan Jones, 2009)\n\nBack in 2009, Duncan Jones’ feature debut “Moon” made somewhat of a splash within the sci fi community. It follows Sam Bell (played by Sam Rockwell), an astronaut on a three year mission by himself on the moon to mine an alternative source of fuel due to fuel scarcity back on Earth. After suffering an accident on an expedition, he discovers that he might not be totally alone as first thought, revealing a dark secret of the company for which he works for. This is a great movie all around: the cinematography is great, the set design is amazing, and Sam Rockwell’s central performance deserves a lot more credit than what it actually gets. Dealing with issues of identity and morality, Duncan Jones’ first film announced him to the world as a very talented filmmaker… a bar that, sadly, he perhaps set too high for himself.\n\n5. Primer (Shane Garruth, 2004)\n\nPerhaps the most complicated time travel film to ever be made, “Primer” is an extremely low budget film written, directed by and starring Shane Garruth, a former engineer, who used his scientific knowledge to craft the very well tought out and highly complex mechanics of time travel. It follows two friends and colleagues, both engineers, who by working on their own scientific experiments accidentally discover – or rather invent – a time loop scenario that allows them to travel six hours into the past, while their past selves still exist during this time period. Like stated before, the mechanics are very complicated, and Garruth never dumbs down the scientific terms for the audience’s benefit, so this might be a frustrating watch for some viewers, but it can be highly rewarding by paying close attention and multiple viewings.\n\n4. Under the Skin (Jonathan Glazer, 2013)\n\nA low budget scottish production consisting of the simple premise of Scarlett Johanson playing a mysterious alien woman who drives around Glasgow picking up men, takes them back home to apparently sleep with them, what in fact turns out to be a sort of predatory practice. The film may not be big on visual effects or high concept storytelling (though there are some visually striking sequences in there), but it does delve deep into classic sci fi themes such as the question of what it means to be human through an art house lense. Johanson’s performance is very subdued and even tender, her character far from a simple alien monster, is instead a nuanced and complex being that undergoes one of the most interesting developments for a non-human character within the genre.\n\n3. Children of Men (Alfonso Cuarón, 2006)\n\nDystopian science fiction as bleak as it gets, though its not devoid of a glimmer of hope. In the year 2027 humanity has become infertile, what has lead to a collapse of most global economies, with the UK being the last one standing. An influx of refugees has been pouring into the country. Theo (Clive Owen) is contacted by former wife Julian (Julianne Moore) so he helps a young refugee named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitee), who just may carry humanity’s last hope in the face of its impending extinction. This is still arguably Cuarón’s masterpiece, an intelligently crafted sci fi thriller, shot through the director’s and Lubezki’s characteristic impressive long takes, and featuring what could be Clive Owen’s best performance. Cuarón presents a very harsh picture of what could be humanity’s future in one of the century’s best efforts in the genre.\n\n2. Ex Machina (Alex Garland, 2015)\n\nAlex Garland’s take on Artificial Intelligence is one for the ages. The film follows Caleb (Domhall Glesoon), a programmer who wins an office contest to visit the isolated house of Nathan (Oscar Isaac), the CEO of the company he works for. Nathan has been working on an AI called Ava (Alicia Vikander), and Caleb is there to make a Turing test on her, meaning he has to determine if she could pass as a human or not. Like many other sci fi classics before, “Ex Machina” tackles themes of humanity’s relationship with technology and what it means to be a human being, delving into actual discussions regarding topics of consciousness and artificial intelligence. All the while Garland creates a compelling and thrilling narrative anchored by the dynamic between its three main players, building to a climax that guaranteed won’t be easy to forget.\n\n1. Melancholia (Lars von Trier, 2011)\n\nPerhaps not a traditional science fiction film, in that it doesn’t concern futuristic technologies or beings from another world. Instead, Lars von Trier’s “Melancholia” tells an end of the world story but told in a very small scope. It tells the story of two sisters, Justine (Kirsten Dunst), who in the middle of her wedding party suffers a depressive episode, and Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), who sees herself as responsible to care for her sister in this state. All the while, Melancholia, a newly discovered rogue planet, approaches the Earth. For large portions of the movie, “Melancholia” plays more like a psycho-drama than a sci fi ordeal, yet as the impending disaster looms we are treated to classic genre themes like humanity’s reaction on the face of their inevitable doom. Boasting excellent performances by Dunst and Gainsbourg, and shot with the director’s highly stylized visual flair, Von Trier crafts what is definitely one of the best films of the present century (and of his career), let alone the science fiction genre.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it.

Until next time!\n\nTraditionally, the western genre has presented a romanticized image of a particular time period in north american history. The frontier society, somewhere between mid and late 1800s, has been portrayed as the basis of contemporary north american civilization, a place where values like honour, loyalty and justice go a long way. Nevertheless, it is widely accepted that this depictions of the old west couldn’t be further from the truth. During the 60s and 70s, in the midst of great social unrest and political turmoil, a new subgenre of Western arised, which would shed a light and put into question all the myths and legends that the classic westerns of old championed. This current would be known as the revisionist western, also known as late or even anti-western (I previously touched upon this subject in my essay On Classic, Anti and Neo Westerns). Whereas previously the heroes and villains were easily distinguishable and traditional values and individualism always thrived over unfairness and cinicism, now the wild west is painted in a much more ambiguous light. With all this in mind, let’s take a look at ten examples of this category and their revisionist aspects. Note: I’m only including american revisionist westerns, that means that Spaguetti/Italo Westerns such as the ones from Leone and Corbucci don’t really qualify, not because they aren’t revisionistic in their own right (they are and very much so), but because I’m interested in the american perspective towards their own history and legends for this piece.\n\n10. High Plains Drifter (Clint Eastwood, 1973)\n\nA film that puts a spin on the classic western plot of a stranger riding into town and joining forces with the townspeople to stop a band of bandits. Its directed by and stars Clint Eastwood as the mysterious drifter, who the people of the town see as their only salvation. Yet, it soon becomes clear that Eastwood’s character is no saint, his actions are far from righteous and he’s driven by a twisted sense of revenge. Eastwood causes more trouble instead of solving it, and the film really shows how this trope of the stoic stranger coming to save the town hides a huge amount of egoism. While the film does ask a little too much of our suspension of disbelief, it is a very well crafted picture and its revisionism hits the nail on the head.\n\n9. Blazing Saddles (Mel Brooks, 1974)\n\nThe one film on this list that’s actually light-hearted and a comedy in essence, it doesn’t openly criticize depictions of the old west as much as it satirizes them. It stars Cleavon Little as Bart, the very first black sheriff in the town of Rock Ridge, and Gene Wilder as Jim, also known as the Waco Kid, the only person in town who accepts him initially. The pair go through lots of over the top adventures and ultimately have to stop the attorney general, who plans to destroy the town so a railroad can be built. This film really fits into the postmodern tradition, constantly engaging in meta humour and breaking every fourth wall in sight. Its revisionism stems from the limited portrayal of black communities in classic westerns, an issue they handled with great charm and wacky situations.\n\n8. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (George Roy Hill, 1969)\n\nPaul Newman and Robert Redford star as the infamous outlaw pair Butch Cassidy and Harry Longabaugh, a.k.a. the Sundance Kid, a couple of criminals on the run from the law after a series of train robberies. The two title characters are legends of the west, so the film goes on to deconstruct what makes them legends in the first place. They are supposed to be celebrated gunmen, yet they reject gun violence. When engaged in duels they resort to trickery and conniving, methods that in the classic westerns of old would be considered as dishonourable. Then there’s the famous “Raindrops” scene, which shows a very innocent side to two supposedly hardened criminals. In a very anti-western fashion, the outlaws become the heroes and the law is the corrupt villain.\n\n7. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (Sam Peckinpah, 1973)\n\nIn the first and certainly not the last film directed by Sam Peckinpah you’ll see on this list, James Coburn stars as Pat Garrett, the sheriff of Lincoln County, who is assigned to track down his old friend Billy the Kid, played by Kris Kristofferson. The conflict between these two men and their ideologies lie in the center of the film, and through this we see a very gritty and cruel wild west, where ideals like friendship and loyalty are rendered irrelevant through a corrupt legal system. The amazing soundtrack was composed by Bob Dylan, who also stars in the film as a member of the Kid’s gang, yet, while the scene featuring “Knocking on Heaven’s Door” is one of the most iconic scenes in film history, seeing Dylan in the film was kind of distracting and it broke with the immersion, his character doesn’t add much to the story and I think he’s better off as a musician as an actor. However, this shouldn’t detract from the film’s overall quality and its thought provoking material.\n\n6. The Assasination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (Andrew Dominik, 2007)\n\nCertainly the newest film on this list, you might think that the title reveals everything you need to know about this film, but in truth the story is so rich and nuanced that you have to pay close attention to grasp everything that’s going on. Brad Pitt stars as outlaw Jesse James and Cassey Affleck stars as Robert Ford, a young man whose obsession with the western hero turns deadly. The film is a slow burn, one of the slowest for a western film, yet by the end it becomes clear that Jesse James was not the Robin Hood-type of hero he is made out to be, and Robert Ford is not a coward by any means. A huge staple of the revisionist western subgenre is the deconstruction of legends, and even if this film came out way after the initial wave of anti-westerns, it certainly fits the bill.\n\n5. Ride the High Country (Sam Peckinpah, 1962)\n\nA film that can be considered somewhat of an early late-western, this was one of Peckinpah’s first incursions into wild west territory. While aesthetically it differs to most of the later films that fall into this category, thematically it would pioneer many of the issues that would be explored in later years. It tells the story Steve Judd (Joel McCrea), an ex-lawman, Gil Westrum (Randolph Scott), a once legendary sharpshooter, and Heck Longtree (Ron Starr), Gil’s young apprentice, as they are hired to carry a shipment of gold through the mountains. Along the way they meet a young girl named Elsa (Mariette Hartley), run into trouble and incur into moral debates as to what they should do with the gold. Beyond its portrayal of morally ambiguous heroes, the film tackles a subject characteristic of the late-western: that of aging heroes that cannot cope with the new state of the world.\n\n4. Unforgiven (Clint Eastwood, 1992)\n\nClint Eastwood’s second entry in this list and probably the greatest western he ever directed. Eastwood stars as Will Munny, an aging former outlaw who takes on a last job to earn a huge amount of money. He’s assisted by Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman), and they’ll cross paths more than once with sadistic sheriff “Little” Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman). As with the previous entry, this film deals with an aging western “hero” that struggles to come to terms with the current state of the west. Munny isn’t a fast shooter, his hands are shaky and struggles to mount a horse, thus is the idea of the gunslinger (popularized by Eastwood himself) demystified. The main representative of the law in the film is Daggett, a psychopathic figure that’s nonetheless a god-fearing citizen. Logan is a pacifist and doesn’t revel in violence. The film takes a number of classic western tropes and ideals and subverts them, painting a much more grounded picture that the ones we may find in the westerns of the 40s and 50s.\n\n3. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (John Ford, 1962)\n\nThe case of this film is particularly interesting, since its directed by John Ford, the man who practically edified many of the tropes and conventions that revisionist westerns would seek to subvert and criticize. It tells the story of Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart), a senator who arrives at a frontier town which is being terrorized by bandit Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin); the only man who stands up to him is Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). After a reluctant start, both men will work together to bring Valance down. Much like the aforementioned “Ride the High Country”, this film might be best described as an early late-western: it plays out in a somewhat traditional fashion, yet by the end the central legend is demystified and, perhaps more importantly in its message, it presents in Stewart’s character the idea of a civilized society that works in accordance with a centralized form of government.\n\n2. McCabe and Mrs. Miller (Robert Altman, 1971)\n\nRobert Altman famously said once that he despised the western genre, so when he set out to make this film it was no surprise that it would run against all conventions. In the center of the movie is John McCabe (Warren Beatty), a gambler and self-described business man who comes to a frontier town to open a brothel. While his business is doing all right, he meets Constance Miller (Julie Christie), an experienced prostitute who teaches him more than a few things on how to run and expand his business. The pair starts doing pretty well, until a big mining company wants to buy them off. This is probably the film that differentiates itself the most from the rest: its not about outlaws and sheriffs, it doesn’t concern banks or train robberies, nor is it about legends and gunfighters. Instead, it is a film that talks about the economic state of America and how big businesses crush the little man. It is bleak and gritty, yet the cinematography is visually striking and Leonard Cohen’s soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful. I firmly believe that only Altman could’ve pulled off a film like this.\n\n1. The Wild Bunch (Sam Peckinpah, 1969)\n\nPeckinpah’s masterpiece and a masterstroke in western revisionism, 1969’s “The Wild Bunch” concerns an aging group of outlaws, who are forced to flee to Mexico after a railroad robbery goes horribly wrong when a former member of the bunch sets them up. It deals with the classic theme of old heroes struggling with the modernized world that surrounds them and has ots to say about the modernization of western society. On one side of the frontier they face a corrupt railroad owner who wants them dead, a sign of the rising corruption in corporate America, and on the other side they face Mapache, a corrupt leader of the mexican army who also wants them dead, a sign of the corruption of institutions. Peckinpah’s aesthetic tackles violence in a very raw and sterilized fashion, putting into question the whole glorification of violence that the westerns of old championed as necessary for society’s progression. The bunch are relics of a much simpler past, yet they refuse to go down quietly and instead choose to fight against this new corrupt world order until their last breath. Aesthetically accomplished, narratively compelling and thematically very thoughtful, Peckinpah’s film is most likely the revisionist western par excellence.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you liked it. I recently had to write a paper for university on the subject and learned lots of new perspectives on the matter. There’s certainly many other films that I’ve missed or that I haven’t seen, so feel free to leave your recommendations in the comments. Also, if there’s a good response I could do a similar list for Italowesterns in the future, so do tell me if you might be interested. Anyway, if you could share this with your friends, family or anyone you know that might be interested I would deeply appreciate it, and don’t forget to hit the follow button to stay up to date with this blog’s contents. Until next time!\n\n2019 is already almost a month old and I’ve been delaying this for a good while now. I was waiting to see if I could watch as many films as possible, but of course that is never enough and many great entries get left out. Some of the movies I haven’t had the chance to see yet include: most of the Oscar fare, namely “A Star is Born” (Bradley Cooper), “Vice” (Adam McKay), “Green Book” (Peter Farrelly), “First Man” (Damian Chazelle), “If Beale Street Could Talk” (Barry Jenkins), then there’s foreign contenders “Capernaum” (Nadine Labaki) and “Never Look Away” (Florian von Donnersmarck), as well as “Mirai” (Mamoru Hosada), very sadly “Spider Man: Into the Siderverse” (Persichetti, Ramsay, Rothman), indie darlings such as “Leave no Trace” (Debra Granik) and “Eighth Grade” (Bo Burnham) and my biggest regret, I haven’t watched my own country’s “Pájaros de Verano” (Ciro Guerra and Cristina Gallego).\n\nSo yeah, with that out of the way, lets get into the honourable mentions: “Upgrade” (Leigh Whannell), “Bohemian Rhapsody” (Bryan Singer), “Thoroughbreds” (Cory Finey), “Everybody Knows” (Asghar Farhadi), “Under the Silver Lake” (John Robert Mitchell), “Mandy” (Panos Cosmatos), “Searching” (Aneesh Chaganty), “Ralph Breaks the Internet” (Moore, Johnston) and yeah, gotta mention it, “Avengers: Infinity War” (Russo brothers).\n\nPs.: given that the Oscar nominations were announced yesterday, I’ll be writing about that on the weekend, though I have something different in mind this time around, so that’s why I’m taking a little more time to put that together.\n\nAnyway, without further ado, here are my 20 favourite films of 2018:\n\n20. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (Coen brothers)\n\nAnthology films can be a hit or miss type of situation, but the Coens never disappoint. Six different tales set in the wild west, ranging from comically silly to action packed to actually quite profound. Maybe not every story is as good as the rest, in particular the fifth one, “The Girl who Got Rattled”, comes to mind as the anthology’s weakest link, but the other five are solid enough to earn this film a spot on this list. I found the title story to be very enjoyable, especially Tim Blake Nelson’s charismatic performance as the outlaw Buster Scruggs, but I’d say y favourite was probably Meal Ticket: perhaps very little happens, but its this character driven narratives that the brothers make shine, not to mention the excellent performances by Liam Neeson and Harry Melling. The film surprised a lot of people by earning three nominations yesterday, myself included, but I’m glad it didn’t get shut out.\n\n19. Suspiria (Luca Guadagnino)\n\nI might be in the minority here, but personally I didn’t really like Argento’s 1977 original. Its visually grandiose and the production design is really something, but the acting was pretty bad, the dialogues are cheesy and the climax is really underwhelming. Yet, I was still quite curious when they announced a remake to be helmed by Luca Guadagnino, and I’ve gotta say I enjoyed this one quite a lot. The colour palette may be watered down and it goes in a very different direction than the original, especially by the ending, but I thought this was a very well executed horror film. Dakota Johnson was much more engaging than Jessica Harper, and the elevation of Sara’s character, played by the great Mia Goth, made the story all the more compelling. Yet it was Tilda Swinton, as always, who really steals the show. Then again, I was kind of disappointed that her Madame Blanc dind’t have a more active role during the finale. Either way, the film’s creepy imagery and instances of body horror, topped off with great acting, some very assured camera work and a nicely unsettling score by Thom Yorke make this one a great entry.\n\n18. The Death of Stalin (Armando Ianucci)\n\nA historical and political satire about the state of the Soviet Union after the passing of leader Joseph Stalin. A pretty solid movie with a great cast, great production design and a very well written script. it might not be the most historically accurate film ever made, but that’s a usual story with historical dramas. Steve Buscemi is excellent in this film and definitely deserves more recognition than what he’s getting, as do Jeffrey Tambor and Simon Russell Beale as well. Armando Ianucci delivers his characteristic brand of political humour, this time aimed at a specific period in history, and the results were outrageous enough to cause bans in more than a few post-soviet countries. Perhaps they took it too personal there, I’d say this is a film that its at its best when it doesn’t take itself too seriously.\n\n17. Bad Times at the El Royale (Drew Goddard)\n\n“Bad Times at the El Royale” finds seven strangers crossing paths at the El Royale hotel exactly by the border between Nevada and California, and when a storm traps them all secrets will be revealed and all hell will break loose. The movie is framed and edited in an interesting way, jumping in and out of different characters’ perspectives and showing their sides of the story. And while this aspect of Goddard’s direction works for the most part, perhaps its biggest problem was that it was too convoluted, and therefore it didn’t land with audiences and critics that well. However, I found it a very well put together film that kept me invested til the end, with an excellent ensemble cast and some very cool twists. Yes, it has its flaws, particularly on the writing department, but that doesn’t detract from this one being one of the most fun experiences I had in a cinema last year. Click here to read my full review.\n\n16. A Quiet Place (John Krasinski)\n\nI talked about this film on my best of first half of 2018 list, and here we are, six months later. “A Quiet place” was definitely one of the stand outs of last year, a great monster film but first and foremost a great story about a family’s efforts for survival. Set in a post-apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by extremely sound-sensitive creatures, John Krasinski himself and Emily Blunt are excellent as we see their efforts to keep their family safe. The premise in itself is pretty interesting and the execution was vey well done, though there’s always a couple of small moments that make you question how tight the movie’s inner logic actually is. Regardless, the film is fantastic at capturing the human element of the apocalypse. I was really sad that Emily Blunt got snubbed at the Oscars, I really think she deserved a nomination for this one. Still, they got a deserved nod for Sound Editing, so they didn’t get complete shut out.\n\n15. Hereditary (Ari Aster)\n\nProbably the horror movie of last year, Ari Aster’s directorial debut definitely made an impact. The story follows Annie (Toni Colette) right after the passing of her mother. As she and her family try to come to terms with the situation, very strange and increasingly disturbing events begin to take place around them, as lots of dark secrets come to light. The plot takes some very unexpected and bleak twists, and by the end when everything falls into place there’s a lingering sensation of tragic inevitability. Colette delivers a power house performance, if someone deserves to be among the nominees for Best Actress it is her. Her co-stars, Ganriel Byrne and, most surprisingly, Alex Wolff, also deliver great, poignant performances. All in all, a greatly acted, extremely tense and positively disturbing horror film.\n\n14. BlacKkKlansman (Spike Lee)\n\nSpike Lee’s new take on the state of racism in America, both back in the 70s and today, is a great achievement that reivindicates Lee’s recent bad spell. It tells the real story of african american police officer Ron Stallworth (John David Washington) as he infiltrates the KuKluxKlan. Adam Driver stars as his white double. The film is very poignant in its criticism while never forgetting the fun of its premise, it shines a light at the omnipresence of racism while at the same time homaging blaxploitation. The characters are very well fleshed out and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life, newcomer John David Washington doing a solid job and Adam Driver deservedly landing an Oscar nomination. I’ve gotta say that the final resolution felt too cheap for me, they had just raised the stakes and it all solves rather nicely in the next scene. Then there’s this montage that, while I understand its purpose, I think cements the film as a product of our era, something that will be decisive if the film is to pass the test of time or not. But beyond those two points, “BlacKkKlansman” is one of the best of the year.\n\n13. Annihilation (Alex Garland)\n\nA film that was released back in february still managed to stay with me until the end of the year (even if many people seem to have forgotten it). Bad returns at the box office (due to Paramount’s stupid decision to pull the film’s international release) and the public’s controversies aside, “Annihilation” was a very well shot film with lots of interesting ideas. It follows a group of five scientists as they investigate a phenomenon known as the shimmer, an area where a meteor fell and now he laws of physics are acting weird. The cast is great, particularly Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh, who in my opinion both deserved to be at least in consideration for nominations. The film aptly mixes science fiction and horror, two of my favourite genres, and manages to deliver some of the most unforgettable scenes of the year. It might not have been extremely popular nor did it make big bucks, but it is still a better film than at least half of the Best Picture nominees this year. You can read my review for this film here.\n\n12. Sorry to Bother You (Boots Riley)\n\nA surreal dark comedy that critizices capitalism. Lakeith Stanfield stars as Cassius “Cash” Green, a down-on-his-luck type of character who starts working as a telemarketer and soon finds out a loophole that will take him to the top, what takes a toll on his relationships, until he finds out that the company he’s working for has got more than a few shady secrets. Boots Riley’s directorial debut is one for the ages, pointing poignant criticism at the system while it embraces its absurdist nature. Stanfield turns in a very solid performance worth lots of merit, and Tessa Thompson excels as his more radical girlfriend. The rest of the cast also do a very fine job, with Steven Yeun as a union organizer and Armie Hammer as the film’s capitalist villain. Yet, the films biggest strength lies in its writing, a truly original and compelling screenplay with sharp satire that gives lots to think about.\n\n11. Climax (Gaspar Noe)\n\nGaspar Noe is back with his characteristically provocative narratives filled with sex, violence and neon lights. “Climax” tells of a group of dancers in a remote french school as they celebrate a completed tour. Little do they know someone has spiked their sangria with LSD, from which all have drunken from, and before they know it hey initiate a challenging descent into hell. The movie displays a technical prowess with regards to its cinematography, which shares an excellent simbiotic relationship with the dance on screen. The dance numbers are amazingly choreographed and the dancers are really talented. When all the madness begins there’s no stopping it. With all the great horror films of 2018, I think this might have been the most visceral. Noe really has a talent to challenge its audience, has been doing it time and time again, the difference with this one and his previous films being that here he’s packed all the insanity in a limited 96 minute run time, which in turn favours the film even more. A hard watch, but a very rewarding one nonetheless.\n\n10. The House that Jack Built (Lars von Trier)\n\nAnd we’re into the top 10 now, with another film that is hard to watch yet very rewarding. Lars von Trier is back with this story about a serial killer who regarded every one of his murders as art, framed in five different episodes and an epilogue that recontextualizes everything. You know what to expect from a Von Trier film and this didn’t disappoint, for better and for worse. Beyond all its graphic violence (though in all honesty I was expecting something worse), the film has lots to say about society and human nature. There are some very funny moments in there too, to my surprise. Also, Matt Dillon deserves a lot more credit than what he gets for his excellent performance as the derranged Jack. The film gets too pretentious at times (a moment where von Trier inserts clips from his previous three films as two main characters have a discussion about art’s importance to mankind come to mind), and I felt the epilogue dragged a little bit, but overall it is a masterfully crafted dark and yet utterly hilarious film.\n\n9. Isle of Dogs (Wes Anderson)\n\nBack in July I listed this one as my favourite movie of 2018, now its shows up in my top 10 once again. This one was my favourite animated film of the year (though I still have to watch “Into the Spiderverse”, and I’ve heard many people say they were expecting “Isle of Dogs” to be their top animated movie of the year, until Spider Man took its place). Set in a dystopian future where Japan makes all dogs illegal and sends them to a trash island, a young boy goes there trying to find his old dog. The movie is really sweet and funny, has an awesome story with awesome characters, and on the technica level it does everything right. Wes Anderson really shines with this one, maybe even making a case to why animation is the medium for him and his peculiar aesthetic. A talented voice cast and a great score by Alexander Desplat round up an excellent animated effort. You can read my full review here.\n\n8. Cold War (Pawel Pawilkowski)\n\n“Ida”‘s director Pawel Pawilkowski is back with this lyrical love story based on his parents’ marriage. It tells the story of aspiring singer Zula (Johanna Kulig) and Wiktor (Tomasz Kot), the musical director who discovers her, as the fall in and out of love over and over in Poland after WWII at first. To tell the truth, I wasn’t expecting to like this film as much as I did. “Ida” was great back in its day, but I didn’t think that a romance movie would keep me so interested and moved. Both leads give excellent performances, particularly Kulig, who also gets the chance to wow us with her singing abilities. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, capturing the tragic yet magical beauty of that perod of time aswe jump from one european country to another. The music, composed by Marcin Masecki, really elevates the beauty of what we see on screen. While before watching it I thought it might be on the cheesy side, the narrative really surprised me with its raw portrayal of a destructive relationship. It landed three Oscar nominations to everyone’s surprise, yet they are very well worthy.\n\n7. First Reformed (Paul Schrader)\n\nWriter-director Paul Schrader, screenwriter of masterpieces such as “Taxi Driver” (1976) and “Raging Bull” (1980) and helmer of others such as “American Gigolo” (1980), is back this year with a meditation on faith, the church and climate change. Ethank Hawke delivers a career best performance as he stars as Reverend Ernst Toller, pastor of a small church with fading attendance. He’s approached by Mary (Amanda Seyfried), who asks him to give her ambientalist husband some spiritual advice. A riveting drama about a priest struggling with his faith and the role of the church in today’s society, this film can be best described as Bergman’s “Winter Light” (1962) meets Scorsese’s “Taxi Driver”. Schrader’s screenplay might be one of the best of the year, and it very deservingly landed an Oscar nomination, though it hardly has a chance of winning. The ending was controversial, and why I can see the reasons behind people’s criticism and thought that that final shot lasted a little bit too long, I thought it was the best logical conclusion to what had transpired before.\n\n6. Burning (Lee Chang Dong)\n\nLee Chang Dong’s arthouse character piece evolves into a mystery that is never resolved. The film follows Lee Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), an aspiring writer, as he meets a girl with whom he went to school with named Shin Hai-mi (Jeon Jong-seo), and he quickly forms an obsession. She asks him to feed her cat while she’s in Africa as social aid, and when she comes back she’s with Ben (Steven Yeun), a confident well to-do guy who volunteered as well. Jong-su befriends Ben, but deep down he rescents him because he has the attention of Hai mi. “Burning” is one of those movies you have to see for yourself, because no summary will be able to describe what this movie is about. Based on a short story by Haruki Murakami, its story and character deconstruction are very well written and executed. If I had one complaint, there’s a certain subplot that gets hinted at the beginning, then arises in one scene, only to never be mentioned again afterwards, and for a movie with a 150 minutes runtime it does feel somewhat unneccesary. But other than that, “Burning” is yet another masterpiece of South Korean cinema.\n\n5. The Other Side of the Wind (Orson Welles)\n\nMost people seem to have forgotten that one of cinema history’s most respected filmmakers finally had his last film completed, which n turn was a densely packed meditation on the filmmaking craft and art in general. Presented as a documentary-fiction hybrid about the last day in the life of a director as he struggles to complete his latest film, it stars John Huston in a towering performance as director J.J. Hannaford, Peter Bogdanovich as his prodigy and Olga Kojar as the mysterious actress in the film within the film. This film exists in a temporal vacuum: it was released in 2018, but for all intents and purposes it is a 70s movie. Most people seem to be ignoring the film when listing their year’s best lists because it doesn’t align to today’s politics, but it isn’t fair to judge this one by today’s standards. Then again, it probably isn’t fair to judge it by 70s standards either. What one can do is judge it by Orson Welles standards, and in that regard it is a piece of cinema very worthy of belonging to one of history’s greatest filmmaker’s canon. Click here to read my full review.\n\n4. Roma (Alfonso Cuarón)\n\nThe most beloved film of the year comes from the mind of Alfonso Cuarón, working in his native Mexico for the first time since 2001’s “Y tu mamá también”. “Roma” is set in Mexico City in 1970, a period of political turmoil for the country, and is told through the eyes of Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), a maid for a high society family. This film might just have the most beautiful cinematography of the year, executed by Cuarón himself, every single frame of the film is a marvel to look at, and several of its scenes count as some of the best we saw all year (the forrest fire and the climax at the beach in particular). The story of Cleo is told in a very tender and empathic way, and first time actress Aparicio fits naturally into the role. “Roma” jointly leads the Oscar nominations this year, something very rare for a foreign language film, and it has great chances of winning, something even rarer. Though not necessarily my choice, I would be very pleased if it does end up winning the big prize. Til then anything can happen, but let’s not forget “Roma” already won the Golden Lion at Venice.\n\n3. Shoplifters (Hirokazu Kore-eda)\n\nI debated for a long time which one I preferred between this one and “Roma”, but ultimately I decided for “Shoplifters”. Hirokazu Kore-eda’s very human drama tells the story of a poverty-stricken family that relies on shoplifting to survive, as they kidnap a little girl to take her away from her horrible family and welcome her as one of their own. The film can be best described as beautiful simplicity, with a style reminiscent to legendary filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu. The sense of closeness to this family the film achieves within the spectator is something very rare nowadays. The characters feel very much alive, their struggles become the audience’s struggles, and their joys become the audience’s joy. Its a very emotional movie, full of small nuances and subtle storytelling. It might not be as big as “Roma”, but if that were to win Best Picture then maybe “Shoplifters” got a shot in its own category (though there’s always “Cold War” that could run away with the award).\n\n2. You Were Never Really Here (Lynne Ramsay)\n\nAnother film that seems to be completely forgotten by everybody. Back in June I placed this one as number 5 on my list, but the film has grown on me a lot since then, in fact every time I think about it the more am I convinced of its greatness. It tells the story of Joe (a tour de force by Joaquin Phoenix), a suicidal army veteran who works as a mercenary, mainly by tracking down paedophilia rings and rescuing little girls. He’s hired by a politician to rescue his daughter, but this job may be even more sinister than it first appears. This is a very brutal and violent movie, and I can see why many people got turned off by it, but the amount of prowess in directing, writing and acting on display is something to behold. Ramsay executes with chirurgical perfection a violent tale on top of a very deep character deconstruction, held together by Phoenix in what could be the role of his career. Got definitely snubbed in categories such as Best Picture, Director, Actor, Adapted Screenplay, Score (Jonny Greendwood once again composing one of my favourite scores of the year), perhaps even Editing and Cinematography. They’ll say the movie is too small for the Oscars, no money for marketing, I’ll say this one is above them.\n\nAnd now, my favourite film of 2018 was of course…\n\n1. The Favourite (Yorgos Lanthimos)\n\nRecently I wrote a review where I explain more about why I loved this film so much, so go check that out. All I can say is that Lanthimos, a filmmaker I’ve been following for a while now, not only met the high expectations I had going into this movie, he surpassed them. Set in 1708 as Britain finds itself in war against France, the film focuses on Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), her confidante and advisor Sarah Churchill (Rachel Weisz) and Sarah’s cousin Abigail (Emma Stone). The film explores the power dynamics between these three ladies. The first that one has to talk about here is the acting: all three leading actresses deliver performances that rank among the best of the year, I really hope Colman gets Best Actress and one of Weisz or Stone for Best Supporting Actress (I’d go with Weisz tbh). The cinematography is very inventive and unconventional, the production design is a marvel to look at, as so are the costumes. Every single aspect of the film worked in perfect unison with each other. One might think that this being a period piece you’ve got everythign figured out, but trust me, Lanthimos knows how bring something radical to the table, and damn does he know how to craft an ending. Rooting for this one to win big on Oscar night, though somehow I doubt it’ll happen.\n\nSo that’s that, my top 20 films of 2018. Overall it was a great year for cinema with all sorts of movies coming from all sorts of directions. The year started strong and remained strong overall, these were the ones that I liked the most. There’s still lots of stuff to watch though, and the Academy Awards take place in a month from now. Like I said, I’ll be uploading my take on this year’s nominations later this week, but with a little twist, so keep an eye out for that. As always, thanks for reading and I hope you liked it. You can be of big help by sharing this with your friends and family, and don’t forget to follow to stay up to date with this blog’s contents. Until next time!\n\n2018 is oficially over, that means we now enter this weird period where you don’t know if any film you watch counts as last year’s or this one’s. It is a time to recap what made 2018 such a great year for movies, but before we get to that (since there’s still a lot of stuff out there that I’d like to see before tackling that head on) we should take a look at awaits us in this new year.\n\nOn the blockbuster front there’s a lot to be excited about: conclusions to both the Avengers saga and the new Star Wars trilogy (the last movie might have divided the fan base, but I’ll be damned if the movie doesn’t kill at the box office), Marvel has also solo outings for its first female-led superhero film “Captain Marvel” and a sequel to Tom Holland’s spidey titled “Spider-Man: Far from home”, there’s also the last 20th Century Fox X-Men film to look forward to, namely “Dark Phoenix”, a new reboot for “Hellboy” (directed by Neil Marshall, who’s directed a few episodes on three series that I love, namely “Hannibal”, “Westworld” and “Game of Thrones”), and Ryan Reynolds stars as Pikachu in a sort of odd-ball detective story set in a world where people and Pokemons co-exist in “Detective Pikachu” (kind of reminds of me of Roger Rabbit). Then there’s “Toy Story 4” of course, but to be honest I’m a little apprehensive towards this one since Pixar doesn’t really have the best track record with sequels, but then again the “Toy Story” franchise is the only exception, so let’s just hope for the best. Disney has also a couple of “live-action” remakes for its classics “Dumbo”, “The Lion King” and “Aladdin”, but while it is true that those films look visually stunning based on the promotional material we’ve got, I don’t think I’ll be attending the theater to see those, mainly because of Disney’s shameless prostitution of its own beloved titles (but I guess that’s a subject for another day perhaps). And how could we forget the sequel to 2017’s surprise horror hit “It”, which has already rounded up a stellar cast to play the grown versions of the children, and there’s even a new Terminator sequel that plans on retconning everything since T2 back in 1991, and if the last Halloween movies is something to go with then this might turn out to be exactly what the franchise needs. All in all, it is an exciting year to be a film fan.\n\nAnyway, those are the biggest projects and franchises from the big studios of the industry, however we all know that the very best films of the year will come out of nowhere. In any case, there are five movies that I’m currently more excited to see beyond the ones I already mentioned, so here they are, in order of release.\n\nGlass (M. Night Shyamalan, January 18th)\n\nThis one is dropping pretty soon in a couple of weeks from now, so it is kind of weird to include it on the main list (maybe I should have gone with “Endgame”?), but I wanted to talk about a little before it got released. Now, Shyamalan doesn’t have the best track record, he’s spent the majority of the last two decades putting out bad film after bad film after bad film, but there are a couple of movies in his canon that are really great cinematic pieces, and those are: “The Sixth Sense”, “Unbreakable” and “Split”. This new entry into his filmography is a sequel of the latter two, which makes it exciting enough. The idea of seeing Bruce Willis’ indestructible hero take on James McAvoy’s multi-personality villain, while Samuel L. Jackson’s Mr. Glass is pulling the strings behind their backs, it just sounds too good to miss. Ana Taylor Joy is also back for this one, which is great considering the hot streak of awesome movies she’s been in lately. Of course, this could all backfire, it is Shyamalan after all, but let’s just hope “Split” wasn’t a one-off thing and more of a solid return to form.\n\nUs (Jordan Peele, March 15)\n\nThe mastermind behind “Get Out” is back with another tense, nail-biting thriller. The trailer looks awesome and it promises a ride full of suspense, horror and a good dose of a psychological edge. Its about a family who apparently are being stalked by a group of people that turn out to be their doppelgangers, but if Peele’s last film is anything to go by we can safely bet that there will be a lot more to this under the surface. It stars Lupita Nyong’o and Elizabeth Moss, two actresses that I’m really excited to see work with Peele. The talent is there, the intriguing premise is there, the ambiguity regarding the plot is also there. All in all, the potential for this film to be one of spring’s most important hits is huge, let’s hope it lives up to it.\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood (Quentin Tarantino, July 26th)\n\nTarantino follows up his 2015 “The Hateful Eight” by tackling the Manson family murders. Based on that sentence alone I’m already sold. Add to that a cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, Al Pacino, Burt Reynolds, Kurt Russell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Dakota Fanning and Luke Perry and how can you resist to that. Now, I do think that Tarantino is a tad overrated by milleannials, and his two previous work have been a little lacking in quality compared to his earlier films (though there’s a clear reason for that: the untimely death of editor Sally Menke, to whom Tarantino himself referred to as his most trusted collaborator), but with a cast like that and a subject matter with which Tarantino can go crazy “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” is a film you don’t want to miss.\n\nJoker (Todd Philipps, October 4th)\n\nIf you’ve read my post of a rebooted DCEU you know I’m a big fan of the Joker and that I’m all for giving him his own movie. Nevertheless, I was a little apprehensive when they announced this movie. The painful memory of Jared Leto in “Suicide Squad” still lingered at the time, and Warner Bros. were losing their credibility in all matters DC. However, what really got me curious were the people behind the project: Todd Phillips, director of “The Hangover”, will be helming the project, so you know from he get go that we’ll have some really dark humour in our hands; then there’s Scott Silver, who wrote the screenplays of “8 Mile” (2002) and “The Fighter” (2010), which means he will probably give the film its street edge, so to speak; and there’s of course Martin Scorsese, who is producing, though it is unclear to which degree he will be involved; finally there’s Joaquim Phoenix as the Joker, a prospect that I am really excited about, since just recently he delivered one of the very best perfomances of 2018 in “You Were Never Really Here”, so I’m really looking forward to seeing where he takes the Joker.\n\nThe Irishman (Martin Scorsese, TBA)\n\nA new Scorsese film is always a reason to rejoice, now add to that the fact that he’s reuniting with Robert DeNiro since 1995’s “Casino”; now add to that Joe Pesci who also starred and thrived in “Casino” and, more importantly, in “Goodfellas”; now add to that the first time in history that Al Pacino will be working with Scorsese; add to that a cast rounded by such talents like Bobby Cannavale, Harvey Keitel, Ray Romano and Anna Paquin; and on top of all that the scrip is being written by Steven Zaillian, screenwriter of “Schindler’s List” (1993), “Gangs of New York” (2002), “American Gangster” (2007) and “The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” (2011). Need I say more? Netflix is distributing and they haven’t announced a release date yet, but I’m pretty sure post-production will be completed in the coming months and that it will be ready for an end of year release, just in time for an award push.\n\nSo there you have it, my five most anticipated upcoming movies of 2019, their releases ranging fromjust in a couple of weeks to we have virtually no idea to when it will drop, so yeah, it already seems that this will be a very exciting year for cinema. Also, regarding the end of the year list, I think I will have it up around the final week of January probably, but until then I’d like to call your attention to Letterboxd: most of you probably already know about it, but Letterboxd is a community for cinephiles where you can rate, review and list your favourite movies. There I have an ever changing list of the best of 2018, as well as a list for my all time favourites, so if you’re interested you can always check that out and add me over there, since I’m still new to it and don’t know many people. But the site is awesome, definitely worth checking out.\n\nUsually on this blog I keep my focus on feature length films, with the exceptions being when I talk about film festivals (sometimes). Yet, there are whole aspects of the filmmaking world that go well beyond features, and to claim that the real cinematic art lies purely on over an hour long movies that would be an utter farce. That’s why today I want to talk about short films and their place in film history. These ten shorts are not only great and acclaimed world wide, but they have the very special honour of being very influential to the history of movies, more so than many well beloved feature length films. Unlike my other lists, where I usually rank the movies in question in order of how I personally appreciate them, today I’ll list these shorts chronologically, since we’re focusing on their degree of influence and not necessarily their quality (though all of them very well deserve to be considered among the best that cinematic art has to offer). So here they are: 10 historically influential short films.\n\n1. A Trip to the Moon (George Méliès, 1902)\n\nEverybody knows this one, and for good reason. It wasn’t Méliès first film, but it is definitely his most well known, even today after more than a century has passed. Inspired by Jules Verne novel “From the Earth to the Moon”, Méliès timeless classic is widely considered to be the very first science fiction film of all time. In the very best spirit of the early period known as cinema of attractions, Méliès employs all his experience and power as an on-stage magician to create illusions with moving images, bringing an almost surrealistic world to life like it had never been seen before and thus creating the very first classic in film history.\n\n2. The Great Train Robbery (Edwin S. Porter, 1903)\n\nWhile Georges Méliès was making the very first science fiction film in history, american Edwin S. Porter was creating the very first western. Many consider this to be the first truly narrative film in history (since “A Trip to the Moon” is more in the vein of attactions cinema): it tells the simple story of a group of bandits as they attempt to rob a train. Still, the film pioneered many techniques still used today such as cross-cutting, constant camera movement and in-location shooting. Such techniques have been further developed in the years after, but needless to say, this short helped establish one of the most important genres in film history.\n\n3. The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin, 1915)\n\nChaplin’s character the Tramp is undoubtly one of the most recognizable and important figures of the medium, appearing in well over a dozen films of Chaplin’s filmography, including some of his most reknowned such as “The Kid” (1921), “The Gold Rush” (1925), “The Circus” (1928), “City Lights” (1931) and “Modern Times” (1936). The character made his debut in 1915 with the eponymous film, where in the space of 30 minutes he works in a farm, falls in love with a girl, helps defend the farm from bandits, and after realizing he doesn’t belong he takes off in the search of new adventures. An unforgettable character, just as sincere in his first outing as he would always be.\n\n4. Steamboat Willie (Walt Disney, 1928)\n\nSpeaking of iconic characters, there’s no way that Mickey Mouse’s first ever screen appereance would be left out of this list. Even though it wasn’t the first ever short to feature Disney’s icon to be produced, it was the first ever to be distributed to the public. Notable here is also the use of sound in the film (presumably the very first animated film to use it): Mickey’s crazy musical adventures on this short helped creat the term “mickey mousing”, used to describe when image and sound are fully synchronized. So there are two main reasons why this film is influential: it is Mickey Mouse’s debut and for its clever and revolutionary use of sound.\n\n5. Un Chien Andalou (Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí, 1929)\n\nProbably one of the most acclaimed short films ever made, this was legendary director Luis Buñuel’s first ever cinematic endeavor. Pairing up with fellow surrealist Salvador Dalí, the two created a film that goes beyond simple comprehension. Dream-like sequences, a messed-up chronology, no discernible plot whatsoever and a series of unsettling and suggestive images build up the core of what is probably the most important cinematic entry of the surrealist movement. Over the years it has inspired countless artists and filmmakers, who weren’t able however to replicate the brilliance of Buñuel’s and Dalí’s original.\n\n6. Meshes of the Afternoon (Maya Deren, 1943)\n\nMaya Deren’s “Meshes of the Afternoon” is widely regarded to be one of the building blocks of the american avant-garde film movement of the late 40s, 50s and early 60s. With an unconventional narrative and a vertical concept of time as Deren herself puts it in her essay “Cinematography: the Creative Use of Reality”, the film repeats images and motifs that somehow add to a bigger picture even if a wider sense of reality gets muddier time and time again. In regards to experimental and avant-garde cinema, Deren’s works (especially Meshes) has been cited as an inspiration, including the films of a certain David Lynch, not to mention the whole movement that blossomed out of it.\n\n7. La Jetée (Chris Marker, 1962)\n\nKeeping up with the experimental spirit (and we still have a few other entries to go), we’ll now be looking at Chris Marker’s sci fi short “La Jetée”: told entirely through still fotos and with a voice over narration, it focuses on a time travel experiment in the aftermath of World War III. Marker, a member of the Left Bank group of filmmakers, a movement parallel to the French New Wave, created a unique film that explores deep ideas such as free will and our relation to the past. A number of hugely popular modern films have credited “La Jetée” as an influence, such as “Terminator” (James Cameron, 1984), “Back to the Future” (Robert Zemeckis, 1985) and “12 Monkeys” (Terry Gilliam, 1995), and its not difficult to see why.\n\n8. Mothlight (Stan Brakhage, 1963)\n\nAs far as influence on mainstream cinema goes, this one may not appear to be the most obvious choice. However, it does have a right to be considered as influential for one of the most experimental types of cinema: the one that dispenses of the camera. With “Mothlight”, Brakhage, a central figure of the american avant-garde, took several moth limbs and flower petals and compressed them between two strips of 16mm splicing tape. The result is a collage film of sorts, rapidly edited, displaying a variety of everyday objects that we’re quick to disregard. It may not seem like the most glamorous project, but as far as experimental films go this one has the highest spirit.\n\n9. Lucifer Rising (Kenneth Anger, 1972)\n\nKenneth Anger, another prominent figure of the american avant-garde movement and a precursor to queer cinema, directs this hellish tale about the summoning of the devil by a group of egyptian gods. Accompanied by a mystical soundtrack with rock n’ roll moments by Bobby Beausoleil, we see rituals and odd indivuals juxtaposed with images of nature, both beautiful and terrifying. Anger’s film boasts with several experimental techniques and visceral satanic imagery, something that would be replicated by both experimental and horror filmmakers as well as for music videos in the years since.\n\n10. Luxo Jr. (John Lasseter, 1984)\n\nReturning now to more “normal” cinema, I saved the last entry for the very first short of one of today’s biggest animation empire, Pixar. “Luxo Jr.” presents two desk lamps, a big one and a small one, as they play with an inflatable ball. These lamps would become Pixar’s own icon. Owned by LucasFilms at the time, it wasn’t the first short they produced, but it was the first to ever be released theatrically, and every year the theatrical runs for each Pixar film makes a big splash at the box office and award season. As a first of a long series of great cinematic outings and first building brick of the powerhouse that Pixar is today, “Luxo Jr.” earns its place on this list.\n\nAnd that’s that, 10 influential short films that have carved their place in film history. Do you agree with this list or are there any others that you feel have been left out? Do leave a comment telling me what you think, and if you could share this post with your friends and family it would be of great help. In the meantime I just wanna say thanks for reading and I hope you liked it. Until next time!\n\nIt is already that time of the year again, Halloween is upon us and that means its time to talk about horror cinema. Last year I made a list of what I consider to be the best horror movies of all time, and while I have watched plenty of other films of the genre since then, both old and new, and the idea of making a revised version of the list was really tempting, I decided to go modern and focus on the great horror pieces that this new century has to offer. I’ve said before that mainstream american horror has found a sort of revival in the last few years, and beyond that there are plenty of gems from all over the world in the genre. The 21st century has a lot to offer with regards to the genre, and here we’re goinna discuss 10 of the very best. Of course there are still several worthy movies that I haven’t had the pleasure of watching yet, so probably some of the best may be missing. I’ve left out movies such as “Shaun of the Dead” (Edgar Wright, 2004) and “The Cabin in the Woods” (Drew Goddard, 2012) since I consider them to be more comedy than horror. I was also tempted to include Haneke’s “Funny Games” (2007), which is very well horror, but since I believe it not to be a remake but rather a companion piece to the 1997 one, even if its almost identical on a shot-for-shot level, I decided against it. Also I left out movies such as “Insidious” (2010) and “The Conjuring” (2013, both by James Wan), which are pretty decent horror movies but in all honesty I find them to be a tad overrated. And I would like a very special honorable mention to Takeshi Miike’s “Audition”, which premiered originally in Japan in 1999 but came to the west in 2000, placing the film on a limbo that makes it difficult to include in such a list.\n\nOther great movies that didn’t make the cut: “The Devil’s Backbone” (Guillermo del Toro, 2001), “The Others” (Alejandro Amenabar, 2001), “The Ring” (Gore Verbinsky, 2002), “The Descent” (Neil Marshall, 2005), “The Host” (Bong Joon-ho, 2006), “1408” (Mikael Hafström, 2007), “The Mist” (Frank Darabont, 2007), “The Orphanage” (Juan Antonio Bayona, 2007), “Drag Me to Hell” (Sam Raimi, 2009), “Sinister” (Scott Derickson, 2012), “Oculus” (Mike Flanagan, 2013), “It Follows” (David R. Mitchell, 2014), “The Invitation” (Karyn Kusama, 2015), “Hush” (Mike Flanagan, 2016), “It Comes at Night” (Terry Edward Schults, 2017), “Hereditary” (Ari Aster, 2018), “A Quiet Place” (John Krasinski, 2018).\n\nAnd now, these are the imo the 10 best horror films of the 21st century:\n\n10. Raw (Julia Doucournau, 2017)\n\nA movie that certainly indulges into its own appetite, this french-belgian co-production works as an allegorical coming-of-age tale about a girl’s sexual awakening as well as an effective horror about cannibalism. Justine, a lifelong vegetarian, begins her studies at veterinary school, where her older sister Alexia also studies. After basically being forced to eat meat for the first time in her life at a freshman ritual, she starts developing a craving for flesh that goes well beyond just the animals. there are some pretty gory and disturbing moments sprinkled throughout, but the film’s real strength lies in the twisted tenderness of the story. Garance Marillier delivers an excellent performance as the confused Justine, making her character one of the main reasons to watch this movie, and that’s saying a lot considering all the blood and sex to be found all over the place.\n\n9. REC (Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, 2007)\n\n“Paranormal Activity” might be the film that ushered a new era of found-footage films in the late 2000s, but the one that truly deserves the label of the scariest of the lot is 2007’s spanish film “REC”. A television reporter and her camera tag along with a group of firefighters as they get a call about an old woman being trapped in her apartment, but as they arrive the woman becomes aggresive and attacks them. Turns out she’s been infected by some sort of virus that soon starts turning everyone into zombies, and we as an audience are in for the ride through the subjective view of the camera man. I remember watching this as I was 14 or 15 and how it scared the hell out of me. The shaky cam effect really takes you into all the horror, achieving levels of claustrophobia and paranoia that wouldn’t have been possible if it’d been handled with a more traditional approach. As far as zombie-movies and found-footage-movies go, “REC” is definitely one of the best.\n\n8. Thirst (Park Chan-wook, 2009)\n\nBack in the late 2000s as vampires became popular in mainstream media again, korean auteur Park Chan-wook tried his hand at the (sub)genre and achieved great results. The movie follows a priest by the name of Sang-hyun, who volunteers for an experimental treatment against a disease knwon as the Emmanuel Virus. The experiment fails and he is infected fatally. However, he soon recovers in record time and becomes somewhat of a celebrity becase of this. As he’ll soon find out, he’s actually been turned into a vampire, what ultimately makes him lose what little remained of his faith and intensifies his feelings of existential loneliness, that is until he meets Tae-ju, the wife of a childhood friend of him with whom he quickly falls in love. The director’s mastery for brutal and bloody stories is in top form here, creating a modern vampire story that poses existential questions about faith and morality while always delivering on its blood-thirsty premise.\n\n7. Get Out (Jordan Peele, 2017)\n\nLast year hit-horror, filled with poignant social commentary, outstanding performances and a very well crafted screenplay, Peele’s directorial debut is without a doubt one for the ages. It follows Chris as he goes to his white girlfriend’s family house to meet her parents. Worried about what they’ll think when they find out he’s black, to his surprise they’re actually very thrilled upon his arrival. Nevertheless, as things start to unravel and all the farcical amability starts wearing thin, Chris realizes that his fears weren’t actually wrong at all and he would have probably been better off had he never accepted the invitation in the first place. Praised worldwide and flooded with awards, “Get Out” is one of those rare horror movies that’s commercially succesful, artistically accomplished and socially relevant.\n\n6. Goodnight Mommy (Veronika Franz and Severin Fiala, 2014)\n\nAn austrian horror film that definitely doesn’t receive the credit it deserves, it tells the story of twin boys Elias and Lukas as their mother comes home after an operation. Her behaviour is somewhat weird and temperamental, what leads the boys to believe that she isn’t really their mother and is actually an impostor. The movie is tense and unsettling from start to finish, from the get go you simply know that there’s something twisted going on below the surface. It takes its time to establish and develop its quite simple story, and the payoff is huge when it all comes crashing down. It aptly delves into psychological territory and even has its moments of body/torture horror, never releasing the tension for the audience until the end when all the pieces fall together. It is a slow burner, but boy do I love it when a horror movie take sit time to set everything up and it pays off wickedly by the end.\n\n5. 28 Days Later (Danny Boyle, 2002)\n\nThe movie that redefined the zombie genre for a generation, Danny Boyle’s vision of a post-apocalyptic Britain may look dated but its impact still lingers on. Cilian Murphy stars as Jim, who one day awakens from a coma in a hospital just to find everything in ruins. After exploring a little and being saved by two strangers he realizes that the world has been infected by a virus that turns people into zombies (who, for the first time in cinema history, are able to run!), thus signifying the fall of society. Boyle’s chosen aesthetic may be somewhat B-moviesh, but the struggles of its characters are extremely real and human and thematically the film is bolder than most zombie movies have ever been, before or since. Add to that great performances from its cast and the aforementioned small change to the zombie mythology that ultimately makes them way scarier and you have one horror movie for the ages.\n\n4. The Babadook (Jennifer Kent, 2014)\n\nJennifer Kent’s feature debut is one of the creepiest and tensest psychological horror films of the century. It tells the story of Amelia and her six year old son Samuel, who have recently experienced the loss of their husband and father, respectively. Samuel has a very active imagination and has a knack for getting into trouble, what is slowly withering down Amelia mentally. One night, when Samuel asks her to read him a bed time story, Amelia discovers a pop up children’s book that she hadn’t seen before. This book, however, is filled with disturbing content about a “spirit” called The Babadook. Soon the book starts taking a toll on both Amelia’s and Samuel’s psyche. The two main reasons why this movie is so great as it is are Jennifer Kent’s excellent, assured direction and Essie Davis tense and complex performance. Many viewers felt disappointed about this film because it was marketed as a traditional supernatural monster movie, instead what they got was a smart, extremely well crafted and unsettling psychological horror, that very well counts as one of the best this century has to offer.\n\n3. The Witch (Robert Eggers, 2015)\n\nAs far as period supernatural horror films go, Eggers’ 2015 “The VVitch” is without a doubt one of the best. It tells the story of a New England family as they’re cast out of their puritan community for a difference in believes and try to build a new life in a farm. When the youngest son Samuel disappears while being in the care of the eldest daughter Thomasin, the whole family spirals into a web of religious paranoia as they encounter forces that are seemingly out of this world. Another slow burner, one that keeps its focus on the characters (especially Thomasin) and masterfully plays with its horror elements, imbuing them with enough delicious ambiguity. Anna Taylor-Joy is a delight in the central role, as so are Ralph Ineson and Kate Dickie as their parents. The film manages tension and suspense extremely well, all the time tackling real world issues that might be more relevant today than we’d wish to admit.\n\n2. Antichrist (Lars von Trier, 2009)\n\nLars von Trier might be one of the most gifted directors still working today, but he’s also one of the sickest. 2009’s “Antrichrist” tells the story of a husband and a wife, played by Willem Defoe and Charlotte Gainsborough, whose infant son dies when he falls out of a window while they were having sex. Afterwards she’s extremely depressed; he, being a psychiatrist, decides that the best treatment for his wife is for them both to retreat to the woods and deal with it together. Once they’re there, the behaviour of the woman starts to become ever more unsettling, culminating in one terrifyingly unforgettable final act. The film was controversial upon release because of its extreme graphic violence, though to say that a von Trier film is controversial is somewhat redundant. It is heavily astheticized and there’s some heavy use of symbolism that sometimes doesn’t quite fit, but still, “Antichrist” is without a doubt one of the most disturbing film experiences you’ll ever see.\n\n1. Let the Right One In (Tomas Alfredson, 2008)\n\nWithout a doubt one of my favourite vampire movies of all time, and most certainly the one that most aptly balances a tender coming-of-age story with chilling horror. Alfredson’s beautiful masterpiece tells the story of Oskar, a socially awkward 12 year old boy with an appetite for the macabre who lives in a Stockholm suburb with his mother. He faces constant bullying from classmates and has a tough time dealing with his parent’s divorce. It all changes when he meets Eli, a mysterious girl of apparently his same age that moved into their appartment complex. Shot with gorgeous cinematography of cold swedish landscapes, Alfredson knows where the heart of the story lies: not in the horror, though he does manage these elements outstandingly (unlike Matt Reeves in the american version, who does not only focus heavily on this but does so in an unsatisfying fashion), the true heart lies in the relationship between the two leads, two tormented souls that hate what they are but that ultimately find solace in each other. Beautifully bleak and extremely heart touching while at the same time managing to be very horrifying, “Let the Right One In” might very well be the very best horror movie the 21st century has to offer.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed it.

Until next time and happy Halloween!\n\nThe Film Noir tradition lived its classic era in the 40s and 50s. Great directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Billy Wilder, John Huston and Orson Welles made some of the most iconic and unforgettable films that deserve this label. Today, we’re listing down ten of my favourite noirs of the classic era. Note that this list focuses mainly on the Hollywood noirs of this period, not on the neo-noir revivals nor its original french designation. A little bit of history: the first movement to be considered as film noir was what we know today as french poetic realism, where directors such as Jean Renoir and Marcel Carné worked on social dramas that often revolved around a criminal world and the fall of a hero. This influence came to America, accompanied by the aesthetic principles of german expressionism (after all, due to the extreme migrations out of the third reich many of the great directors the Weimar republic came to Hollywood and left their own print), and that coupled with the angst and anxiety felt on the post-war era, a new film tradition was born. Wheather its a genre, a style or a movement, no one can agree on that. Lets take a look at these 10 noir films and see if we can get our own definition out of it.\n\nPlease note: the following films I have not yet seen, though I do intend to in the future, and therefore they won’t feature on the list – “The Killers” (Robert Siodmak, 1946), “In a Lonely Place” (Nicholas Ray, 1950), “The Asphalt Jungle” (John Huston, 1950), “The Big Heat” (Fritz Lang, 1953), “Kiss Me Deadly” (Robert Aldrich, 1955), among others.\n\nAnd some honourable mentions: “Laura” (Otto Peminger, 1944), “Detour” (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1945), “Notorious” (Alfred Hitchcock, 1946), “The Lady from Shanghai” (Orson Welles, 1948), “The Killing” (Stanley Kubrick, 1956).\n\nAnd now without further ado, here are my 10 favourite film noirs:\n\n10. Rebecca (Alfred Hitchcock, 1940)\n\nHardly as noir-esque as the other films on this list, since back in 1940 it was still early days for the movement/style/tradition, but still boasting some of the main themes and classic tropes. The film follows a young woman played by Joan Fontaine, who meets and quickly falls in love with Maximilian de Winter (Laurence Olivier), a rich aristocrat with a troubling past. They get married and the new Mrs. de Winter goes to live in her new manor, but the memory of the first Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, still remains quite vivid for most of the inhabitants of the manor. As it turns out, there are more than a few missing pieces of the puzzle that’ll shed a light on Rebecca’s untimely death. It does not follow the classic noir plot, but it does delve into a pessimistic mood and world view, plays cleverly with its black-and-white cinematography and different women may play he part of the femme fatale at different stages of the film, without fully embracing this persona. Not as great as Hitchock’s later films -and later noirs- but still a worthy addition to this list.\n\n9. Out of the Past (Jacques Tourneur, 1947)\n\nConsidered as a classic example of what a noir narrative should look like, with virtually every trope being on fantastic display: the stoic hero whose past comes back to haunt him, the complicated conspiracy that drives the plot, the letal femme fatale pulling the strings, you’ve got it all. The film tells the story of Jeff Markham (Robert Michum), now going by the name of Jeff Bailey, a previous private detective who retired after a job involving the mysterious Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer) went wrong. He now owns a gas station and wants to marry Ann, a good local girl (Jane Huston). Sadly, this has to wait, as he is contacted by Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), his former employers, who still believes Jeff owes him a result after that last job. It is a great example of a noir story and all of its players. The performances are spot on, the dialogues are sharp and witty, and even if it has a slow start once the story picks up momentum there’s nothing that can stop it from reaching its explosive finale.\n\n8. The Maltese Falcon (John Huston, 1941)\n\nJohn Huston’s directorial debut was one for the ages with this crime mystery that quickly established itself as one of the best entries the noir canon has to offer. Humphrey Bogart stars as Sam Spade, a private investigator who gets thrusted into a hunt for an ages old relic known as the Maltese Falcon by the duplicitous Ruth Wonderly (Mary Astor). A thriller about conspiracies, murder and a treasure hunt, Huston’s first picture is one of the immediate titles that jumps to the head when someone says film noir. Bogart fits into his role seamlessly and embodies the noir detective perfectly, something that he’d do and refine more than once later in hs career. Also great in their supporting roles were Peter Lorre, Walter Huston and of course Mary Astor. The Maltese Falcon may be one of the earliest examples of a McGuffin in action (though I believe Hitchcock was already using it, at least as far back in 1939 with “The 39 Steps”), and it is a perfect example of how to execute such a plot device and get the best out of your narrative and characters through it.\n\n7. The Night of the Hunter (Charles Laughton, 1955)\n\nThis was sadly the only film that Charles Laughton got to direct in his life before his untimely death. What could have been if he’d been able to build upon the greatness of his debut feature? Now, the status of “The Night of the Hunter” as a film noir is indeed often discussed and controversial. On the surface it doesn’t appear to be your typical noir: the setting is rural instead of the bleak urban landscape we get in most films of the tradition, there’s no classic noir hero and instead we rely on two children to solve the mystery, neither is there a femme fatale pulling the strings of everything going on. Still, if we take these tropes to be rather cosmetic instead of definitory, and if we go by the premise that the essence of film noir rather lies on its themes and atmosphere, then Laughton’s masterpiece may very well fit the bill. The tone is as bleak as any other film in this list, and while it may delve into religious themes, something a little unusual for noir at the time, it manages to tell its story about deceit and moral corruption in spectacular fashion -and that, in essence, is what constitutes film noir.\n\n6. Shadow of a Doubt (Alfred Hitchcock, 1943)\n\nOne of Hitchcock’s most underrated films, “Shadow of a Doubt” starts Joseph Cotten as Charles Oakley, a man who’s in Santa Rosa for a visit to his family. His young niece, Charlie Newton (Teresa Wright), has deep love for her uncle. However, as the police start looking for the Merry Widow Murderer, suspicion begins to boil in her that her uncle may not be as wonderful as she thinks. Unsurprisingly, the film is an excellent exercise on suspense and built of tension. Hitchcock slowly feeds the audience with new information, letting them put the pieces together, and even if the answer may seem obvious we , as Charlie, don’t want to believe it. Cotten’s performance finds the perfect balance between charismatic and mysterious, likeable and ominous. And Wright’s young unlikely hero is one that seems to sadly been forgotten by most. She asserts herself as a curious and nobly tenacious character, and is ultimately a true hero, even greater than many other less shiny examples in the genre.\n\n5. Touch of Evil (Orson Welles, 1958)\n\nConsidered by many as the very last noir of the classic period, and one of Orson Welles greatest features, “Touch of Evil” certainly caputred the zeitgeist and marked the close of a very interestig period of american cinema. Charlton Heston stars as Mike Vargas, a police officer stationed at the mexican border. After a bomb explodes on the US side of the border, being planted on the other side, Vargas takes an interest in the investigation. Unfortunately for him, this puts him at odds with police captain Hank Quinlann (played monumentally by Welles himself). Their morality and honour codes could not be further apart from one another, and their conflict may put the entire investigation in jeopardy.
