Mainly the MCU but last year I looked over the Misc Marvel movies as well. I had fun with that, as it allowed me to look at some stuff I had never seen before and re-visit a few movies to see if they hold up. Doing that gave me the idea for today’s post.\n\nThis one’s self explanatory, we’re looking at DC’s side of film. Their film roster is kind of the opposite of Marvel in terms of how they’ve grown. Marvel was spotty at first before getting way better and more consistent, while DC started off generally really good, but became more uh, hit or miss with people in the 2010’s. They are getting more praise now though.\n\nThey’d had quite the history and I want to honor that, from the Dark Knight’s to the Superman 4’s. Now, I’m specifying theatrical because I know they have a ton of direct to video animated movie so I wanna say those are being left off. Perhaps another time…or next year.\n\nAnyway, how does DC’s films fare? Which are the best and worst? I know you’re totally dying to hear my thoughts on Steel. Let’s go!\n\nThis, is A Look at the Theatrical DC Movies\n\nSuperman and the Mole Men (1951):\n\nSuperhero Month: Superman and the Mole Men\n\nWe start with one I already reviewed! Click that link to see what I thought of this one. In short, predictably corny with some charm but overall it just kind average and forgettable. Not terrible for being the first superhero movie though. Now onto the rest!\n\nBatman (1966):\n\nAnd here’s our first actual movie. We go from a start to a series, to a film version of an already existing one. I’ve only seen bits and pieces of the the Adam West series but I have seen this movie twist now at least.\n\nThere really isn’t much to say about this one, it’s simply good campy fun. The 60’s Batman stuff always has a charm to it, and this movie all of it. From the silly gadgets, to the over the top villains. There’s some fun stuff here, with the bomb scene being my favorite part just got for that classic line. And you can’t forget the bat shark repellent.\n\nThat said, it does feel like an extended episode at times. That charm can only take you so far and it does feel too long, especially near the third act. Then the ending feels a bit too weirdly abrupt. It is all quite fun but it could have been trimmed.\n\nWeirdly enough, I like this a bit more than the animated takes, Return of the Caped Crusaders and Batman vs Two Face even though they are shorter. They are still fun though, check them out.\n\nIn short, it’s some overlong but solid campy fun. If you haven’t seen it and like this kind of stuff, it’s worth a watch. …And yeah that’s all, I swear I’ll say more about the others, since they have more to them,\n\nRating; Good\n\nSuperman (1978):\n\nRequested Reviews #2: Superhero Edition\n\nAnother one I covered, and by request no less. Still a highly enjoyable one, even with the cop out ending. And speaking of Superman…\n\nSuperman II (1980):\n\nNow for the sequel. There isn’t too much to say for this one, sorry to say. I like it but not like a ton and not as much as the first one. It’s still good fun like the first, for the same reasons. It also has Zod, who is awesome and enjoyable. There’s some an interesting thing with Lois actually finding out Clark is Superman which adds something extra and was nice to see.\n\nBut it is slow to start and I don’t think there’s much that rises above simply “enjoyable”. Plus, it is jarring cutting between scenes of Lois and Superman having just done it and Zod doing evil stuff. Oh and yes, that mind wipe kiss is super dumb. Why do these movies have such dumb resolutions?!\n\nOf course, I am aware of the production troubles and the Donner cut, but I didn’t quite feel why watching it cuz…eh. Maybe someday but not today. (This was the original Snyder cut, damn it) But overall, it is a fun sequel with a good villain, just nothing super special. Still, not bad for a sequel.\n\nRating: Good\n\nSwamp Thing (1982):\n\nI hate to keep the “there’s not much to say” train rolling….but yeah, this one was just really average for me. It does nothing too wrong but nothing too right either. Which is a bit odd given that Wes Craven directed it.\n\nIt’s pretty competent and perfectly watchable but just left me with a big feeling of…eh? The characters aren’t that interesting and not much stands out. Swamp Thing himself is good, getting some nice moments but that’s about it. It’s just all…middle of the road, with some cool bits here and there.\n\nI see how some can flat out like it since there’s nothing too bad and there’s just stuff to like here, just not enough for it to be above middling. It….exists, that is all.\n\nRating: Average\n\nSuperman III (1983):\n\nAka the bad Superman movie that isn’t Superman 4. Since this isn’t as hated as 4, I figured this could be a pleasant surprise or just average. While it wasn’t exactly too terrible, it was pretty mediocre. It has some good ideas and moments here and there. The stuff with Lana is charming, even if it doesn’t quite so anywhere and Evil Superman is fun.\n\nThere’s decent bits like that but so much of this just drags. Richard Pryor takes up too much of this, which would be fine if he was funny, but he just isn’t. More focus on corny comedy is acceptable in theory but so much of it is just cringey in a bad way. The opening is a good omen for the rest of it, although that was dumb that it was kind of amazing.\n\nThe villain is weak and it didn’t need to be 2 hours, I started checking out hard in the 3rd act. So while it has some charms here and there, it’s mostly overly and drag-y, with bad comedy. It may not be horrible, but it’s largely not a good story and just not good. Skip it, it’s mostly bleh with some good bits here and there.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nSupergirl (1984):\n\nIf I recall correctly, this was the first female-lead superhero movie and it sadly started the trend of them being not very good. It’s better than Elektra and a certain other one we’ll get to, but that’s not saying a ton.\n\nKara is likable enough but not super interesting most of the time, and the story was just kind of there. This is another one where I was checked out by then end. But then there’s the villain, who is a witch. Yes. Shes weirdly fun in some parts but for the most part she was pretty lame.\n\nThe love interest is also weak and there’s a love triangle and love potion thing with the him and the villain too that was super dumb. So much time was wasted on stuff like that. There’s some enjoyable action bits but that isn’t enough to save it.\n\nIt’s better than Superman 3 and our next one but it’s still not very good. It has some charms in places but it doesn;t take long to crash and become fairly mediocre. A Supergirl movie had promise but sadly it didn’t turn out well this time, And yeah, it’s just meh, not really worth the watch.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nSuperman IV: The Quest for Price (1987):\n\nAh yes, the most hated one of them all, at least in terms of Superman ones. And it’s…kinda bad but I didn’t hate it. I think I had been desensitized by the reviews of it I’ve seen so nothing surprised me. That and as dumb as it all was, nothing was anger inducing.\n\nAt a certain point, I was accepted what was going on. Not that it makes, say, getting rid of all nuclear weapons any more plausible but you get what I mean. Some of it was at least ironically enjoyable, like nuclear Man and his silver nails.\n\nMy least favorite bits were honestly this subplot where this rich woman hits on Clark, as it goes nowhere and is cringe-y. Otherwise, the rest was either was just whatever or so dumb it was kind of amusing. Still a mess and not good, just not the most painful thing ever.\n\nHonestly, I kind of liked it more than 3. Sure, 3 had better good stuff and all that but it had even more cringe-y humor and dragged so much more. At least this was only 90 minutes. But either way, neither are that good. But if I had to chose, I’d watch this again, it’s better riff materiel.\n\nSo yeah, bad but not painfully so, it’s just dumb.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nThe Return of Swamp Thing (1989):\n\nI have even less to say for this than the first one. The tone is lighter so there’s more humor, and I was hoping to lie it more as a result. But I actually liked it less to be honest. It again an uninteresting story and characters but honestly lame humor most of the time. Not to the point of being annoying but it’s not exactly funny either.\n\nI was fairly bored for most of it, despite some of the silliness going on. It has some fun moments with Swamp Thing again but not much that rose above average. It’s about the same as the first but the good parts are generally weaker and the weak points are even lesser now.\n\nI can see some liking this about as much but I was largely unimpressed. Also, it’s on YouTube legally but YT decided to be crappy and buffering a lot. This did not help matters at all. So yeah, on the higher end of this rating for sure, but still weaker than I was expecting.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nBatman (1989):\n\nOh finally, another good one. This one was pretty big at the time and is still pretty beloved, although it is simpler compared to Nolan stuff we would get much later. So there are times when I think if this is truly as good as I remember it being from the one time I watched it.\n\nThankfully, it is still really good. It’s true it’s not super complicated and I do prefer when there’s a bit more to it but this is all totally good. Their goal was just to have people take Batman seriously since Adam West was the most well known on screen Batman at that point and they succeeded.\n\nGranted, there’s some cheesy and dated stuff like the Prince soundtrack but everything else is dripping with moody atmosphere., That really makes this movie, ontop of Micehal Keaton being a pretty great Batman. You also have Jack Nicholson being a ton of fun as Joker. There’s also Bob. Bob is cool.\n\nThere’s not much in terms of action but the climax is a lot of fun. I will say that I wish that Joker just started as the Joker, as the transition from him being a normal bad guy to being crazy just because of that whole vat of whatever is a bit wonky. There’s other small rushed things like that but otherwise the pacing is pretty solid for a two hour movie.\n\nI know some will dislike my comment about this being simpler and me preferring when there’s more to it since A. it doesn’t need to be super complicated to be good and B. there’s enough here for what it is. I get that so it’s not a big slight. It’s not one I totally love but it is really enjoyable in all it’s dark and moody goodness.\n\nIt is a case of a director being restrained being for the better given what would come next, making a good showcase of Burton’s style without going overboard. Overall, still holds up a really solid movie.\n\nRating: Very Good\n\nBatman Returns (1992):\n\nBatman Returns\n\nBeen a while but here’s another one I reviewed ages ago. I still feel the same. It looks great and the acting and all that is really good but the story is a huge mess. I mean dang, there’s so many ideas that it all just kind gets crammed together. I honestly think this would be dislike more if the technical and such weren’t as strong.\n\nBut the flaws do help make it enjoyable in a weird way. So being generally badly written but fun with how odd it gets, and well made makes it an odd middle ground one. Far from good but has its charm and is far from forgettable, that’s for sure.\n\nRating; Average\n\nBatman Mask of the Phantasm (1993):\n\nYeah, this movie is the main reason I allowed the scant few animated movies on here. Despite being an extension of one of the most acclaimed animated series ever, Warner Bros just threw this out there after making it theatrical at the last minute. It bombed despite solid reviews and has now grown to be really beloved.\n\nAnd just like with the show, I have to agree with the praise. As far as flaws, they are mostly small things. Like how it can feel a bit extended episode-y at times, leading to some stretched out bits here and there. For a little while, the present scenes are a bit flat compared to the flashbacks. But once it reaches the climax, those issues clear up.\n\nI wish they had given a theatrical budget from the start so they can go more all out with some parts, but it still manages to feel theatrical overall. It helps that the series was already pretty cinematic, especially in the animation. That animation does manage to be even better than it already looked, with more elaborate set pieces along with the striking art style, which is cleaned up a tad here.\n\nStory-wise, this tells a really good love story with Batman, something the series hadn’t done before. It’s also something even the live action movies struggle with but they nailed it here. The romance with Andrea is well developed, and the flashbacks are the highlight as we see how he started out and fully turned into Batman. As I said, the present story is a bit dry at first but it improves once we see this all ties together.\n\nThe reveal of the Phantasm is brilliant. I didn’t see it coming the first time I watched it and it ends up making perfect sense and it really elevates the story into being something special. This kind of twist can be tricky to pull off but it really makes the story for me. It’s an overall good Batman story that explores his past further and gives us some interesting moments.\n\nThe ending is great too, leaving things on kind of a downer note. I love how they weren’t forced to down things down, if anything it’s a bit darker than the show. There’s even a bit of blood! Speaking of natural transitions, I wasn’t sure about Joker’s involvement at first but while he is clearly only here since he’s the Joker, they did justify him pretty well.\n\nPlus, he’s always great to see anyway. Overall, much like the series, this is a great take on Batman that tells a strong story with solid animation. It tells a story we hadn’t seen up to that point and has a really strong finish to make everything better.\n\nThis is now seen as one of the best Batman movies overall and I do have to generally agree with that. They went above and beyond with this one and it holds up very well. It’s weird to compare it to some of the others but the fact that I can has to say something. So yeah, I dig it.\n\nRating: Great\n\nBatman Forever (1995):\n\nBatman Forever\n\nI still maintain that is so much better than Returns that it’s not even funny. Sure, it has some clunky stuff like bad CGI and a fair share of corny moments. Also, Two Face kinda sucks here. But it makes up for it with a pretty decent story and actually focusing on Batman this time around. Not exactly the smoothest movie ever but it’s decently constructed and balances the elements a rad better than what came before and directly after it.\n\nI won’t argue for it being amazing or anything and I get certain complaints ut overall, I think it’s pretty good. Not great, but good.\n\nRating: Good\n\nBatman & Robin (1997):\n\nOh hey, it’s everyone’s favorite! Jokes aside, this one is interesting. It was hated at the time for how goofy it was but seems to have a following these days due to some people being able to appreciate that. Plus, they feel bad for Joel Schumacher. Having finally watched it, it’s…meh.\n\nI can see what is going for and it works sometimes. Mostly with the villains, who are hamming it up big time and can be fun for that reason. Even Arnold’s ice puns are kind of hilariously bad. I have no idea what Uma is trying to do with the performance her but it is weirdly entertaining.\n\nThe problem is that everything else is pretty boring in comparison. Batman and Robin hardly get much development and what we get is a lot of annoying bickering that is not fun. The stuff with Alfred is actually okay, I liked seeing more focus on him. But everything else with Batman/Bruce drags which shouldn’t be the case.\n\nGeorge Clooney is alright but he’s hardly acting here, just kind of being himself. Say what you will about every other live action Batman, they were trying a lot harder to be Batman. Batgirl is here too and she’s pretty meh. There’s also a random attempt at a feminist thing with her and…well, I could only think about how the internet would react is this came out now and that would be all kinds of hilarious.\n\nFrankly, my biggest problem is how long it is. Something like this should not be two hours, it’s the same problem Superman 3 had. Put all that together and you have something that has some cheesy charm but doesn’t quite work as a whole. Besides, the corny stuff was done to appease parents and marketing teams, that stuff was not exactly done with creative intentions. So that defense doesn’t quite work, even if it does end up working as a sort of Adam West homage at times.\n\nAlso, Bane is in this. Sort of.\n\nOverall, it’s certainly not the bane of my existence or anything and I get the appeal, but I don’t really care for it overall due to being too mixed with the elements and overstaying its welcome. I can respect some of it but yeah, still not very good. Sorry.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nSteel (1997):\n\nHere’s the DC movie that basically killed them for a fair bit, while our last one got the ball rolling. Honestly, this movie isn’t so much horribly painful as it is just…lame. It has a guy becoming a superhero to fight injustice…and that’s it. The story doesn’t get much more complex than that.\n\nThat’s not a bad thing on its own but the execution is all very…well lame. It’s straight forward with nothing terribly interesting, which also applies to the characters for the most part. The exception is Sparky who is fairly likable and I sorta wish the movie was about her instead. The opening with her getting cripples is honestly okay and made think this won’t be as mediocre. Sadly, it was not to be.\n\nThe other positive is the score, especially the main theme. It’s pretty good, better than this movie deserve, frankly. The worst thing about this one is the dialogue. There’s so many cheesy one liners that it gets to be too much. Those kind of lines can work but this movie uses them way too much. Also, no disrespect to Shaq, but he’s pretty bad here.\n\nThere’s some goofy fun to be had here and there but it was mostly in one ear and out the other for me. Not painful by any means, it’s simple pretty lame. Steel is the very definition of…\n\nRating: Meh\n\nDC took a long break after Steel, but hopefully their comeback was a good one.\n\nCatwoman (2004):\n\n…Well so much for that. This is the worst one, just gonna say that. This makes even Superman 4 look like a masterpiece. I watched this a couple years ago as I threw it on a Twitter poll and I don’t really feel like watching it again.\n\nFrom what I recall, it’s just so sloppy. The editing is really bad, cutting so damn quickly which makes it hard to get invested. The villain and her motivation is ridiculous, and that outfit is not doing Catwoman any favors.\n\nThere’s some ironically funny moments due to how silly it is but it’s mostly sloppy, dumb and boring. Halle Berry does do a decent job with what she’s given, but that’s about it for positives. The small bits of iron enjoyment and such don’t even come close to making up for how weak the rest is.\n\nI didn’t rate it lower than what I’m giving it for reasons I don’t recall. Guess it just didn’t anger me all the time like most movies I give a lower rating. That still, it’s hardly an endorsement. Could be a fun group watch with friends but that’s about it. It’s bad.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nToo kind? Maybe, whatever.\n\nConstantine (2005):\n\nOut of all of these, this is the one I knew the least about. Outside of some whispers, no one really brings it up an I’ve never felt compelled to look into it. I am pretty unfamiliar with the character in general which adds to it. So I had no expectations going into this. Having watched it, I kinda see why, it’s very…okay.\n\nUnfortunately, I can’t quite article what didn’t work for me. It’s all there, I mean you get Keanu Reeves a detective who looks into the supernatural and ends up in this plot with demons and stuff. The direction is good, the effects are decent, and the acting is solid. Aside from Kenau, there’s also Peter Stormare and Tilda Swilton having memorable moments.\n\nI guess I just didn’t feel that connected to anything. The plot works okay for what it is and they do try to have nice moments and flesh things out. But other things don’t really developed and I didn’t care about the characters too much, they were just kind of there. But there’s enough decent moments for others to possibly be more attached. The reception is mixed and I can see why, it’s the kind of thing you’ll find pretty enjoyable or just okay.\n\nI can’t say anything to justify it being not being a bit higher since it’s not I can point to any bad moments or whatever. It just a general feeling of being fairly cool but perhaps relying more on than that anything else. Either way, I find it to be a perfectly watchable but middle of the road offering. Worth at least one look for curiosity but nothing that’ll stick with you for long I’m afraid.\n\nRating: Average\n\nBatman Begins (2005):\n\nAh yes, the movie that helped change superhero movies quite a bit. Yeah, the next one really did it but this the ball rolling. It also still blew people away at the time with how serious and mature it was compared to what people had come to expect. The reception is a bit mixed now, some have it as their underground favorite of them while some see it just a solid warmup for a way better sequel.\n\nThat’s where I fall in. It’s quite good but does have some of the expected shortcomings that would be ironed out in the next movie. For one, the villains are surprisingly weak. Liam Neeson got a good job but otherwise Raj is just kinda there, not leaving an impact. Scarecrow lead to some cool bits but otherwise he too doesn’t really leave an impression. Which is a big shame given memorable he is things like Batman TAS and the Arkham games.\n\nThe action and editing isn’t that good, even if that has been slightly overblown by some. The love interest is also pretty dull. There’s just certain things that come off as kind of underdeveloped compared to Batman himself. Thankfully, it’s able to make up for that.\n\nBruce’s development is well handled. We see how he goes from someone trying to make sure no one has to go through what he did, to becoming Batman proper. It’s pretty compelling stuff and I think for once the runtime is mostly warranted. More than I remembered to be honest.\n\nAlfred also adds a lot here. While Bale’s Batman is kind of goofy due to the voice, his Bruce Wayne is pretty solid. It manages to justify making an entire movie for the backstory due to how well they developed it. I will say that watching it for the first time after the others did make it perhaps less impressive than it would have been had I seen it first but it still holds up.\n\nIt did have kinks to iron out but Nolan still created something solid here. Batman is well developed and the style is solid enough to make up for some weaker elements. So yeah, not amazing but still pretty good.\n\nRating: Good\n\nSuperman Returns (2006):\n\nThis one is interesting. It was supposed to be this big Superman comeback but it under-performed at the box office (although that’s due to not being able to double the huge budget) and the reception was middling. So they didn’t more, leaving this as a weird sore thumb. People just seem to be whatever on this one, with some liking it here and there.\n\nI can see both sides here because this one is just kind of okay, but it has a lot to like. It’s a follow up to the original first two movies and ignores the rest. What a shame, was hoping for the revenge of Nuclear-Man. Superman left for 5 years to see if he can find signs of Krypton and after coming up short, he returns to see how much has changed.\n\nMy main issue is that they really should have done a reboot first than do this kind of thing. This has to reintroduce things and kind of follow up the first two at the same time and it’s kind of clunky. Him leaving is kind of brushed off as a thing that happened, not much time spent on exploring why or how Lois came to doing a whole thing on why they don’t Superman. I get why, it’s just not explored enough.\n\nThe actual plot aside from that is just a bunch of stuff I didn’t care about. It’s way too long for something like that and it drags quite a bit, especially in the second half. They also a death fake out thing that drags out so much even though you know what’s gonna happen in the end.\n\nThat said, there’s some really good moments here. They captured the heart of the Christopher Reeve movies fairly well and there’s some fun set pieces and good moments of heart. And while they do look a bit too young, I thought Brandon Routh and Kate Bosworth were fine in the roles. Lex manages to be decently fun and threatening, and I keep forgetting this is where that WRONG meme comes from.\n\nThe effects and score are pretty solid as well. I feel like there’s a really good movie in here, it’s just brought down by some dull bits and tying a bit too hard to be like the first two, as it becomes a bit too re-hashy. You could have rebooted it and done new things while still keeping the heart. But this is what got and it sure does exist.\n\nDespite how long it is, it was okay to watch and had some solid highlights here and there. It has a sincerity to it I can appreciate these days but it doesn’t fully come together. It isn’t sure exactly what it wants to be overall and that does hurt it. But if you haven’t seen it, it’s worth a look if you’re curious. Just don’t expect anything super memorable.\n\nRating: Average\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008):\n\nHere it is, the big one. It’s actually kind of weird to think it’s only been a little over 10 years since this came out. Yeah, that’s quite a big of time but sometimes it feels like this came out even longer ago because how much this has impacted comic book movies. It basically changed the superhero movie scene, even if that meant some people took the wrong lessons for it.\n\nAnd I won’t be contrary, it’s pretty great. Sure, I can nitpick all I want. The voice kind of sucks, making it slightly hard to take Batman seriously compared to everything else. He seems to be able to survive literally anything. Two Face weirdly isn’t as interesting when he becomes Two Face. Rachael is a dull love interest and her death is just kind of brushed it off in the end.\n\nBut I can look past those. Yes, the hype can be annoying and all that but I still think this is a damn strong movie. Joker does steal the show big time. Heath Ledger is just so damn scary here and the character is able to have interesting layers without even telling us much.\n\nSome the physiological stuff can be a bit try hard but most of it is really interesting. Even more so than Batman Begins, this transcends the genre with how it plays out kind of like a legal drama at points that happens to have Batman in it. That can create a slight disconnect at times but that’s not a big deal.\n\nIt is a shame that this did help start the stigma that comic book movies aren’t “real movies” unless they are closer to this but ah well. One small underrated thing about these is the humor. There’s some small amusing bits that manage to fit well. My favorite is this:\n\n“A bit of a fighter in you, I like that”\n\n“Then you’re gonna love me”\n\nThe action is greatly improved from Begins, creating some really solid sequences. The direction is tight and the length is justified. This movie basically speaks for itself at this point and yeah, it’s pretty good to say the least. I get if some are tired of the hype these days but it holds up quite well, even with all the imitators that came after.\n\nA fine film to be sure.\n\nRating: Great\n\nWatchman (2009):\n\nThis is not one I was looking forward to, for a couple reasons. One is how long it was, and that’s without factoring in the alternate versions. The other is that the nature of this being one of those deeper deconstruction stories had me worried it’d be too dour or depressing for me to really care about anyone. Plus the possibilities of it not being as smart as it thinks it is.\n\nThankfully, those weren’t issues in the end. Despite how ling it is, it went by faster than I expected and generally warranted to due how to the story is. For the most part, they use the time to flesh out the characters and such more, rather than it getting super self indulgent. It didn’t need to be longer though, although I hear there’s some cut stuff from the comic that other versions put back in I guess.\n\nDespite the darkness and the very flawed characters, they manage to make them interesting enough to be worth getting invested in. And there’s some nice moments with them alongside the assholes and the more messed up stuff. It all wrapped up nicely ending in the end and the set up was an interesting one.\n\nWhile there is some try hard stuff here and there, the themes are well realized and it’s all pretty engaging. Zack Snyder’s direction really shines here, this movie looks great and the style and substance go hand and hand. It helps that from what I hear, they mostly just stuck to what was already there in the comic. I read that some people that hadn’t read found the movie hard to get into but I’m in that camp and I understood it all fine.\n\nIf I was ever lost, kit’s due to my own short attention span, that’s all. I don’t quite any big complaints, the only reason i didn’t love is that it’s not totally mt thing I guess. I like these kind of comic book movies, but I prefer the characters in say, the Nolan Batman stuff and found myself not getting totally attached to everything here.\n\nOverall, it was really well made, engaging and solid all around. Just a really solid movie, that’s all I got for this one.\n\nJonah Hex (2010):\n\nI watched this one for my superhero movie a bit back and didn’t end up doing it. This movie is just so…forgettable. Changes aside, this should be a really cool and fun movie. I like gritty westerns and the ideas present here should have made a cool take on one. The main problem is the pacing.\n\nNot that it’s too slow, just the opposite actually. It’s under 80 minutes without credits which is way too short for a movie like this. It’s so rushed as they clearly just wanted to get this over with. As a result, nothing is developed and nothing leaves an impact. Maybe getting the directors of Crank to write this was a mistake.\n\nJosh Brolin is good and nothing is really painful here per say. It’s just that it’s super forgettable and uninteresting. It’s not even close to awful, it just fails to leave any kind of impact. I remember exactly nothing and I felt the same right after finishing it a couple years back.\n\nIt just kind of exists, and it’s not even good at doing that. I expect more the director of Horton Hears a Who. Yes, really.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nGreen Lantern (2011):\n\nGreen Lantern\n\nMan, this takes me back. Feels like ages ago when I reviewed this. Looking back, it wasn’t too bad. It’s not very good and full of wasted potential, but it’s not terrible. There’s some fun bits and I’ve seen worse at this point. I get why it became a laughing stock but eh, it’s just kinda mediocre in the end.\n\nRating: Meh\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises (2012):\n\nI’m not linking my crappy old general review as this deserves a better review to replace it. The reception of this one has been interesting over the years. It got plenty of critical love but there’s always been some vocal detractors and nowadays I tend to hear that a bit more often.\n\nAnd I hadn’t heard that many complaints that don’t feel like super pity nitpicks that come from them just not actually engaging with the materiel. I’m just saying, there’s a reason CinemaSins happened to start around this time. There’s some fair critiques here and there but I keep hearing people being hung up on such dumb things, like the ever so infamous “How did he get back to Gotham” or whatever.\n\nAnyway, I quite loved it at the time and watching it again….I really like it but I don’t love it as much. Yet I’m not quite sure why, I actually don’t have many real complaints per say. It’s just closer to Batman Begins on this go around, although I do like this more.\n\nIt’s still all really engaging, seeing Bruce get to his lowest put. The best stuff is in the pit, it’s really solid and well executed. Bale gets quite a bit to work with here and he handles it well…but man that voice will never not be distracting. Anne Hathaway’s Catwoman is really good too.\n\nAnd Bane is a big standout, he’s really imposing and works well as our villain. While his voice is a bit silly, it wasn’t too distracting now that I’m so used to it. It all just works, and once again the runtime is generally earned.\n\nThat said, this one does drag a bit more. That’s the thing, between the really engaging stuff there’s a lot of just okay stuff that doesn’t grab me a ton. It’s slower to start and I’m not sure why. There’s nothing wrong with anything here, mostly, so I’m not sure what it is about this compared to when I first watched it.\n\nAs for actual complaints, the Talia thing is kind of interesting also somewhat overly complicated and weird. And the very ending was a mistake, they should have left it up in the air if he survived instead of what they did. DC keeps making this mistake with the death teases for some reason.\n\nSo yeah, I weirdly didn’t love it as much this much but I still really enjoy it. I don’t understand the more petty problems and to me this is all quite solid. Perhaps a bit lesser than the last one but topping that one is a tall order so there’s no major missteps here. Oh and the direction and such is arguably even better in places. Same goes for the score.\n\nI may not consider it super great like before, but it managed to rise to the occasions for the most part.\n\nRating: Very Good\n\nMan of Steel (2013):\n\nGenerall Review: Man of Steel\n\nOh boy. This review is clunky in places, as at times I just got angry at bits literally just because everyone else was doing it. That said, my generally thoughts do stand. Looking back, I beg for this discourse compared to what we have now.\n\nIt was so split down the middle back then, it’s kind of funny looking back now. I still think it’s just okay. It has some strong stuff here and there and some good ideas. Even with the flawed execution, I can appreciate the vision here and do see the good intentions. A darker Superman isn’t bad on principal, as honestly it’s more overly dramatic than full on dark, until the end anyway.\n\nBut the structure is handled in a wonky way, and it just tries too hard to be deep. I get what they were doing with those two infamous moments but they didn’t feel fully earned. I do feel people still overblow things like the killing and the damage. You’d swear this ended with Superman going on an killing spree for no reason which is of course not at all what happens.\n\nBut yeah, certainly a mixed start to the DCEU and sadly it would only get worse from there.\n\nRating: Average\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016):\n\nGeneral Review: Batman v Superman\n\nFirst odd, I didn’t watch the Ultimate Edition, I just didn’t feel like it. I hear it is better by fixing some plot issues and such but doesn’t really fix my other problems. I feel like I was a bit too nice at the time but mostly everything else still stands.\n\nDespite of its major problems, especially the ending, I do think there’s plenty to like here. It just bites off more than it can chew and tries to setup so much and cram so many different plot elements. There’s also things like the Martha thing that I actually do totally get, the execution is just a bit awkward.\n\nIt’s far from the travesty it’s made out to be but it’s also far from a masterpiece too. It’s s shame this wasn’t executed better but ah well.\n\nRating: Average\n\nSuicide Squad (2016):\n\nGeneral Review: Suicide Squad\n\nThe overhated DC train continues! Once again I may have been slightly too nice but still again, my points stand. This was more entertaining than the last couple but also messier. It not trying to be as epic and deep did make easier to stomach though. I mean, screwing this up just isn’t as big of a deal.\n\nThere’s still some enjoyable stuff here and Harley Quinn was still nailed, even if she would be written better later. Oh and I just gotta say this: People really exaggerate the editing. It’s certainly not that good but far from totally horrible. Call me when you’ve seen Taken 3 or whatever.\n\nOnce more, DCEU was so close in places but yet so far. At least they got it next time.\n\nRating: Average\n\nThe LEGO Batman Movie (2017):\n\nGeneral Review: The Lego Batman Movie\n\nYep, it counts. Not much to add here, still a really fun Batman take. It seems like the animated Batman things tend to be give us some of the most faithful stuff. And it still holds up on repeat viewings. With the LEGO movies, I always appreciate them even more as I watch more, as I catch jokes I missed so chance.\n\nGood stuff.\n\nRating: Very Good\n\nWonder Woman (2017):\n\nGeneral Review: Wonder Woman\n\nFinally, the first good one. It’s not amazing or anything but it’s still pretty solid. They got Wonder Woman really right and crafted a solid ride. I even think the third act if fine, I have problems but I don’t see what makes it so bad for some.\n\nMy review stands more for this one so I’ll stop now, still good stuff and I’m looking forward to the sequel, when it eventually comes out lol.\n\nJustice League (2017):\n\nGeneral Review: Justice League\n\nSo….let’s address the elephant in the room first. That damn Snyder cut actually exists after all. …And by that I mean there was a rough version and they will be filling in the blanks. So it only kind of exists, huh. Frankly, I’d rather watch a movie about the making of all this instead of the actual Snyder cut.\n\nSeriously, it’s wild how we got here. This movie was an uphill battle given how the DCEU started and then Zack had to leave, leading them to hire Joss to create the thing we have now. Then bitter fans got up in arms over his original versions and now it’s gonna happen. At least the poor social media manger at the Warner Bros Twitter account can rest easy now.\n\nAnyway, this is another that is less terrible than people say but I don’t quite care as much. It was just so middling for a lot of it. There’s some fun bits but it doesn’t leave much of an impact overall. And boy does that CGI look worse every time I see clips of it. I barely even remember this one, really.\n\nWe’ll see how that Snyder cut turns out, at least it will be more respectable than what we have now.\n\nTeen Titans Go! To The Movies (2018):\n\nGeneral Review: Teen Titans Go! To The Movies\n\nI’ve actually watched this one two other times since I first saw it. Granted, one was in a stream and the other was with my brother and I wanted to see his reactions. Still, for something as flawed as this that has to say something. It has another really funny parts to make up for the kinks. Perhaps I’m too nice to TTG these days but this still ain’t too bad. …Moving on.\n\nAquaman (2018):\n\nIf you told me a decade ago that the Aquaman movie would not only exist but also be the Batman/Superman movie, I wouldn’t believe you, but here we are. Of course, this is no master-work but it’s good.\n\nMostly because they know exactly what kind of movie this is. It’s in a weird zone where it does take itself a bit seriously but also not too seriously at the same time. It tries to be epic but also know this is still an Aquman movie after all. This movie just goes for it, giving us some wild images like an octopus playing the drums.\n\nSome dodgy bits aside, the effects are good and the world is well realized. James Wan directs it all well and it seems like he’s made the transition from horror to action quite well. Aquaman is decently developed and I thought the villains worked alright compared to what I expected from this kind of thing.\n\nScriptwise, it’s fairly standard and isn’t deep in the slightest. That’s fine and for the most part, it wasn’t super boring or painful. There’s some wonky bits of humor here and there but otherwise this flowed fine. Although it is hurt by being two hours, which is too much for a movie as simple as this one.\n\nSo while it’s nothing great, it is a fun action spectacle that goes for it and becomes a wild fun ride. I can see how some can find it just too silly but I got along with it fairly well. It’s just a lot of good goofy fun.\n\nRating: Good\n\nShazam (2019):\n\nOf the DCEU movies thus far, this is easily my favorite. It’s not only a lot of fun, but it has quite a bit of emotional stuff that was frankly more meaningful than in the movies that were made to be super deep.\n\nIt does a good job of capturing exactly what a kid would do if he became a superhero, as they mess around in funny ways. The comedy is pretty strong, with some fun charecter moments. The kid actors are all solid, and both Asher Angel and Zachary Levi sell their roles pretty well. The tone balancing can be a tad iffy when we have things like that woman just becoming dust as well other things the villain does, but it’s not too big a deal overall.\n\nSpeaking of the villain, I mostly quite liked him. He’s really sympathetic with how he got screwed over by his family and then the wizard (He’s the real villain, I swear) but also pretty threatening. His family drama makes for an interesting parallel with Billy. Although he does become a more generic baddy by the third act, so he’s not perfect, still he is solid.\n\nI really like the friend, he has some really funny moments and I think the cliche stuff where Billy gets getting a bit ego-y works okay for the larger story. But the highlight is certainly the drama with Billy. He got separated from his Mom at a young age and has been trying to find her, being quite stand off-ish to his foster family as a result of being too into trying to find her.\n\nThe reveal of what happened with mom is really heartbreaking and well done. Not to mention refreshing in terms of what ends up happening in the end. That stuff is good enough that this almost got to a higher rating. But it is held back a bit, mostly by getting too long, especially with the climax going on forever. Sure, it gets really fun, but drags quite a bit.\n\nThere’s some other sloppy pacing bits, like it taking too long to get more into the meat of things. But even with that, this movie really works. As everyone has said, it’s Big as a superhero movie and it manages to be even better than that sounds.\n\nWith good characters, solid comedy and solid drama, this is a very fun and solid ride. Again, easily the DCEU’s best thus far.\n\nOkay, so what’s next? ….Oh boy.\n\nJoker (2019)\n\n“Comedy is subjective”\n\nHey, it’s the movie no one has any opinions on. Right off the bat, I am not going to talk about the…culture behind the movie because I know you are all sick of it. I just want to talk about the movie itself. And it’s…fine.\n\nI say I wanna ignore the culture behind it but I will admit it affected my opinion ever so slightly. This is the kind of movie that is best viewed in a bubble, without knowing a lot of the discussions going on about it, including from the makers. That said, I think I’d feel the same in a general sense.\n\nThis is trying to be a deep character study, exploring how someone like Arthur Fleck can become The Joker. It’s basically a studio movie trying to be an art house picture. I’ll start with the positives of this. It does raise some good points about so-I mean the system that makes it so poor people like Arthur are ignored. I can certainly agree with all that.\n\nThe stuff with his mother is interesting, including the reveal that she may have been complacent in some bad stuff. While a lot of the attempts to be shocking and dark generally didn’t affect me since I’ve seen it all before, one bit with him and her did get to me.\n\nWhile it can be overbearing, which I’ll get back to, the score really sells a lot of this. I honestly think if it wasn’t there, not quite as many people would have gotten into this since it carries a lot of scenes. Joaquin Phoenix helps too. He can be a bit over the top as a result of the direction but otherwise he really transforms in this role and was pretty effective.\n\nSo there’s a fair bit to appreciate. But at the same time, man does it try way too hard. This being a dark movie for general audiences isn’t a bad thing but it does lead to the movie spelling things out for us. There’s often a lot of nothing going on, basically just Arthur doing stuff.\n\nAs good as that score is, sometimes they blare it to make up for the lack of anything going on. Parts of this have an aura of self importance, like it thinks it’s so much deeper than it really is. I do agree with some of what it brings up but a lot of it doesn’t go much deeper than the surface level.\n\nWhile getting someone who can do dark comedy makes perfect sense, Todd Phillips was not the best choice since the direction can be a bit too indulgent. I do like that some parts are left to interpretation, even if some things again get spelled out too much.\n\nFor as much as there is to appreciate, it feels like the movie just tries too hard to be the next deep comic book movie. It wanted to be The Dark Knight (or The King of Comedy for that matter, but I haven’t seen that one) but its closer to Ang Lee’s Hulk, although I did like this one more by my reviewing standards.\n\nAs a whole, it’s perfectly fine given what it is trying to do. It has some points, the cinematography is good, the score works most of the time and Jaquin is good. But it drags on too much and feels a bit too self indulgent, which takes away from could have been a more meaningful movie.\n\nI will say that I do appreciate what it represents for DC. They were willingly to do outside of the DCEU and do something different and I think we need more things like this. So if the success of this ones leads to better things for them down the road, I’m cool with it.\n\nAs for this movie, I don’t think it’s neither a brilliant masterpiece or pretentious nonsense. It’s just…fine. …Certainly didn’t deserve most of those Oscar nominations though.\n\nRating: Decent\n\nAnd finally..\n\nBirds of Prey (2020)\n\nWe get to end our marathon with this. Harley gets her own movie where she breaks up with Joker, goes against Black Mask, then meets over people I guess. As everyone has said, this is more Harley than Birds of Prey, hence how it got renamed to Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey later on. Not that it helped it much.\n\nStill, this was a really fun one. Director Cathy Yen is allowed to go hog wild here, and it’s really enjoyable. I still enjoyed Margot Robbie in Suicide Squad and she’s allowed to flourish more here as she becomes her own person. Some may find her shtick annoying but I thought it mostly worked.\n\nIt’s kinda Deadpool-esque but it is able to do its own thing in the end. That sandwich bit is the best love story ever told. She does kinda hog the development from everyone else but the others are good too. Huntress is awesome and Black Canary and Rene were fun as well.\n\nThe other show stealer was Ewan McGregor as Black Mask. He was clearly having fun and he was great too much. The story isn’t much, pretty simple at the end of the day but it works but what they are going for. It is kind of messy as it has to juggle so much so it is far from the tightest movie ever.\n\nThe style is good, with a great soundtrack and some fun energized action. It can be sloppy at times but the style and the fun stuff makes it a highly enjoyable watch. I wish it had done better but at least it got made at all.\n\nIt shows more of how DC is willingly to more wild and if they do more movies like this and less like Joker, I’m hyped for their future. It’s a good note to end on. Not exactly super deep or tight, but it is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it. Shazam is still my favorite DCEU so far though. (Also, crazy how this will ended up being one of the only 2020 movies lol)\n\nRating: Good\n\nAnd those were the theatrical DC movies. Overall, quite the interesting bunch. You can really see them experimenting over time with what works and what doesn’t. There’s been some clunkers, usually resulting in them not really knowing what they’re doing. But we’ve got some real gems in here too.\n\nThese days, they’ve got a better grasp at how to both appeal to an audience and get the critics on board. They’ve borrowed some from Marvel’s book but have also done their own thing too and are more willing to experiment a tad. I have solid hopes for their future.\n\nIf you’re wondering, my least favorite was Catwoman and my favorites were Mask of the Phantasm and The Dark Knight. Predictable, I know but whatever. As for the future, next is Wonder Woman 1984, which this was a tie-in for before that moved. I didn’t feel like moving this though.\n\nThen James Gunn will get a crack at Suicide Squid, and Matt Reeves will bring us Robert Pattinson as Batman. Those sound pretty promising so I’m excited for them. I think that’s all I got for this one, I have fun with these but am not looking forward to just how many I’ll cover when/if I do all those direct to video ones.\n\nGuess we’ll cross that bridge eventually, if at all. Anyway, that’s it for this one.\n\nSee ya."
