They're essentially the replacement of trophies from previous games and that never stopped Mewtwo/Lucas from being playable. Not to mention he would have to be a Spirit since he's the face of his franchise. It would be like if Isaac or Chrous Kids weren't spirits but they still had spirits from their series.\n\nThat being said, I don't have much hope for my boy unless his series miraculously gets revived out of the blue.\n\nI want to believe that because of Geno.

I admit this is something I kind of made up. But I’m basing this off of what I call “The Corrin Precidence”. They absolutely could have given Corrin a stage in 4 based off of Fates. But they didn’t. This signals to me that if they come with a stage, it means they’re from a new franchise. And look at that, all 5 characters (except the Plant) come with stages. Now, this is obvious circumstantial evidence. But if I end up right then hoooo boy.\n\nI think if we get a first party character from a franchise that is already in th game, they will be a la carte like Plant. No stage. Maybe a song or two. Plus, as long as it’s coming to Switch, Nintendo might want to promote it. First party or no.\n\nI don't think Plant can be used as evidence considering signs point to it having been meant for the base game and all. After that you're just left with Corrin, and that's setting a precedent out of only a single data point. In addition, Fates was a 3DS game. Any new stage would need brand new assets to work on Wii U. Three Houses and Sword and Shield are Switch games, and can have assets ported over like they did for Breath of the Wild and Odyssey.\n\nIn other words, I don't think there's really anything supporting this theory.\n\nThe dlc being only third parties is something fans drummed out themselves. Having no first parties is against the whole \"Nintendo fighting game\" concept. Only third parties that are major to videogaming history get in. (only echoes and bayonetta have beaten this, tho bayonetta was a one time thing)\n\nThere are still 67 Nintendo characters in the game, and even if the whole pass was third party, there'd only be what, fifteen third parties? It'd still be a Nintendo fighting game.\n\nAlso it's fairly easy to make \"rules\" if you list the ones going against the \"rules\" as exceptions.\n\nScoliosis Jones\n\nKept you waiting, huh?\n\nJoined\n\nAug 7, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n9,582\n\nLocation\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nNNID\n\nScoliosisxJones\n\n3DS FC\n\n1762-3194-1826\n\n#7,536\n\nIf Banjo is in, I think it’s entirely plausible that Minecraft content gets in through a Creeper and Steve Mii costumes.\n\nCalling it. It makes sense if that’s what Verg heard (even if he just spews what he hears from others for cred), and could be confused for playable character status.\n\nHonestly just waiting for the latest info, because my mind has never even allowed myself to think it was possible, but if this happens, then my childhood will be effectively entirely available in this game.\n\nI couldn’t really even be mad.\n\nI was thinking of a possible scenario though. With Microsoft on Monday, and they tweeted about a “special guest” at their conference, if Doug Bowser shows up, i’m going to **** myself because what could follow would be outrageous.\n\nNot that that’s likely, but it’s possible.\n\nSide note: If you have 67 Nintendo characters and can’t connect with any of them or enjoy their gameplay, considering they are the biggest of the biggest Nintendo characters then I...really don’t know what to tell you.\n\nThere frankly aren’t any Nintendo characters that bring the hype like K.Rool or Ridley. Call me biased, but that’s how I see it.\n\nLast edited: Jun 6, 2019\n\nProfessor Pumpkaboo\n\nLady Layton| Trap Queen♥\n\nJoined\n\nSep 10, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n80,751\n\nLocation\n\nIDOLM@STER Side M Hell, Virginia Beach\n\nSwitch FC\n\nSW: 5586-2837-4585\n\n#7,537\n\nImagine 4000 HP gone in half a second.

It makes sense if that’s what Verg heard (even if he just spews what he hears from others for cred), and could be confused for playable character status.\n\nHonestly just waiting for the latest info, because my mind has never even allowed myself to think it was possible, but if this happens, then my childhood will be effectively entirely available in this game.\n\nI couldn’t really even be mad.\n\nI was thinking of a possible scenario though. With Microsoft on Monday, and they tweeted about a “special guest” at their conference, if Doug Bowser shows up, i’m going to **** myself because what could follow would be outrageous.\n\nNot that that’s likely, but it’s possible.\n\nIt doesn't have to be a special 'guest'. It could just be a surprise that people arent expecting, like say a banjo game.\n\nI think a minecraft mii costume makes the most sense if banjo's in. We might even see a master chief one for gunner ;p\n\nScoliosis Jones\n\nKept you waiting, huh?\n\nJoined\n\nAug 7, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n9,582\n\nLocation\n\nBuffalo, New York\n\nNNID\n\nScoliosisxJones\n\n3DS FC\n\n1762-3194-1826\n\n#7,540\n\nIt doesn't have to be a special 'guest'.

He’s a Microsoft character now, so he’s not really a “guest” and he’s not really all that “special”.

After that you're just left with Corrin, and that's setting a precedent out of only a single data point. In addition, Fates was a 3DS game. Any new stage would need brand new assets to work on Wii U. Three Houses and Sword and Shield are Switch games, and can have assets ported over like they did for Breath of the Wild and Odyssey.\n\nIn other words, I don't think there's really anything supporting this theory.\n\nThere are still 67 Nintendo characters in the game, and even if the whole pass was third party, there'd only be what, fifteen third parties? It'd still be a Nintendo fighting game.\n\nAlso it's fairly easy to make \"rules\" if you list the ones going against the \"rules\" as exceptions.\n\nMaybe. But still.... I don’t know.

I get its a bit of a meme here, but singling out users in a manner like this (especially if they're banned, said they're leaving, etc.) is generally something I'd say people should avoid.\n\nPosted by Loli Hunter XD\n\nView attachment 226248\n\nNot singling you out specifically, and I know some have probably said this already in the past, but please don't point out/bring attention to stuff like this even if it's just for ****posts. We're still taking things seriously when it comes to underage users/content that would attract stuff like what happened before. Posting characters/fanart/etc. is one thing that gets borderline sometimes, but I trust people here to have better judgment/be mindful of what is pushing the line. What seemingly most of us would think others are cool seeing, some feel less than comfortable with.\n\nAs a reminder, we're still working on our improvements/more permanent thread coming very soon. Thanks to everyone for bearing with us, hope I can give a more detailed update ASAP.\n\nLast edited: Jun 6, 2019\n\nKirby Dragons\n\nSmash Hero\n\nJoined\n\nAug 30, 2014\n\nMessages\n\n5,039\n\nLocation\n\nAnother Dimension\n\n#7,558\n\nIf you ask me, having only third-parties on the pass would be a loss when not all the good first-parties have been added yet.\n\nWyoming\n\nConnery, Sean\n\nJoined\n\nJun 27, 2013\n\nMessages\n\n3,810\n\nSwitch FC\n\n7748-5364-3982\n\n#7,559\n\nI'm confused as to how information on a new Banjo-Kazooie release could be confused for Banjo in Smash.\n\nGuess it depends how the source worded it/what they think?
