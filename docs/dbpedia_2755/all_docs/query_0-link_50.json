It started with one offer from Brisbane, then a couple more from other Aussie cities wanting the same timeframe. As our dream of spending 4 – 6 weeks in Australia became a real plan for 2017, we happily accepted those offers and decided to try to add Tasmania and New Zealand by sending out offers of our own. Success! Just when we thought we were all set, a family from Sydney wrote that they needed an emergency replacement exchange for their Colorado ski trip. Their airfare was already purchased and could we help? Sure! For a grand finale, a couple from Fiji was looking for a last-minute exchange at the exact same time that we were going to be away at a non-simultaneous exchange in Norway last summer. That was the perfect icing on our multi-layered Oceanic cake.\n\nSo, for 4 1/2 months of our 5 month adventure we will stay in a local’s home in exchange for them staying in our home. The other 2 1/2 weeks we’ll be staying on a scuba diving live-aboard, chartering a sailboat and staying at bed and breakfast inns on various road trips.\n\nThe real topper has been how genuinely friendly ALL the people have been! And remarkably, not only those we’re exchanging homes with. Several who weren’t interested in exchanging have offered local advice and even dinner invitations! We’re betting that time with locals will be as memorable as the penguins, koalas, kangaroos and scuba diving!\n\nHow can we afford this?!?\n\nThe only way we could possibly manage this five month / three country / 8 flight adventure financially is via home exchange. Everyone understands the dramatic cost savings for lodging (and usually car rental too), but we love the additional benefits: a kitchen, washer/dryer, entertainment systems, wi-fi and space for both of us to work, sightseeing advice, and living like a local in a home with personality. Tom is even exchanging golf clubs at several homes! Lifelong friendships are an additional bonus! It will be a fantastic journey and would not have come together without homeexchange.com.\n\n[ngg_images source=”galleries” container_ids=”155″ exclusions=”7551,7552,7553,7554,7557,7558,7559,7560,7561,7562,7549,7550″ display_type=”photocrati-nextgen_pro_masonry” size=”370″ padding=”5″ ngg_triggers_display=”always” captions_enabled=”0″ captions_display_sharing=”1″ captions_display_title=”1″ captions_display_description=”1″ captions_animation=”slideup” slug=”home-exchanges” order_by=”alttext” order_direction=”ASC” returns=”included” maximum_entity_count=”10000″]\n\nHome exchange logistics\n\nWe’ve had 20 home exchange experiences so far and this will be the first time we’ve organized so many on one trip. These exchanges will be a mix of simultaneous, non-simultaneous, and hospitality. Some are in the heart of cities or suburbs; others are along beaches or rural settings. Most include a car and we include our car for their stay in Colorado. You wouldn’t believe the spreadsheets we have created to track all the details, including phone numbers, addresses, directions, special requests, and when they will be visiting our home. Are you curious about how home exchange works? Read our stories here.\n\nRemember that our home in Colorado has the opposite seasons to all these “down under” locations which added a challenge for scheduling. Most don’t want to come to Colorado in our winter unless they are skiers. So that is why most of the exchanges are non-simultaneous. Two of the homeowners have already stayed in our home while we were in Scandinavia, some will be here while we’re in their homes and others will schedule their Colorado visit later. Pretty cool, eh? For our trip, we are hitting the southern locations in January through early March and then moving north later in the trip to follow the best weather.\n\nWe’ll share fun photos, videos, stories and reviews along the way, so please join us on your favorite social media: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and here at Romancing the Globe Travel Blog. Add your suggestions!\n\nYour advice, please!\n\nSuggestions for excursions or experiences?\n\nNational Parks, Tours, Wildlife Sanctuaries, Museums, Coastal small towns, Great Ocean Road, Beach cafes, Wineries, lodging in Whitsundays, Australia and lodging near Queenstown/Fiordland, New Zealand.\n\nSuggestions for golf courses?\n\nEspecially in the Brisbane, Sydney and Perth areas where we have the most time. New Zealand, too!\n\nSuggestions for SCUBA diving?\n\nGreat Barrier Reef, outer islands and also the west coast north of Perth, Ningaloo Coast. Live-aboards?\n\nWhat local non-profit organizations do you know about?\n\nWe’ve been invited to be Ambassadors for Visit.org so we keep our eyes open for non-profits that have a good reputation for doing great work in the community and allow visitors or volunteers, but don’t exploit children or animals.\n\nWe’re interested in visiting or learning about animal rescues / nature conservations, etc. and local non-profit organizations that support animals, humans, nature, or indigenous culture awareness.\n\nPlease, let us know if you’re aware of any.\n\nWhat lesser known areas should we visit?\n\nYour suggestions changed our plans to include Tasmania and fly to/from Perth rather than drive.
