"I happen to be in LOVE with this store. I don't even live that close, but any costume needs I go there for and they have it all. Prices are the same as other Halloween stores that pop up this time of year. Costumes are already out of bags to try on. They pretty much have it all. I LOVE the store, the staff, the products, everything! CHECK THEM OUT! :)"

"Love Joker's Wild in North Reading. Especially love the staff, Julie and Alex!!!! They were such a big help and super friendly! THANK YOU Ladies dor all your Halloween Help! We will be back just because of you Julie and Alex you were amazing!!!"

"If you don't find a costume or the perfect accessory here, then it probably doesn't exist."

– Kelly M. , Weymouth MA – yelp

"This place is amazing, any costume you could possibly want for any occasion you will find here! Stocked with more adult costumes than you will find anywhere else! I purchased amazing scary contacts here for Halloween 2017 (see pic). I will definitely return here, was so happy to come across this place. The staff is super friendly and helpful too!"

"It's like The Garment District of the North Shore. Except smaller and strictly costume related. If you're looking for a REAL costume, skip the chain stores and head to Joker's Wild--they'll hook you up. Sure it's more pricey, but you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a Raggedy Andy costume prefixed in a plastic bag, then stick with Wal-Mart."

– Jeffrey H., Washington DC – yelp

"The store is a cosplayer's paradise, and offers bundles of top of the line factory-made outfits for Comic-Con, and a guaranteed wash-out of anything mass-produced by Rubies."

– Steve P., North Reading MA – yelp

"I can always count on these guys to have everything I want. And let's face it, what others would wear on Halloween, I'd wear to work or just when I'm out and about. Of course when fall hits and Halloween is right around the corner, this is THE place to go. Depending on where you live, there is another location in Danvers that is equally cool."

– Ellen W., Wakefield MA – yelp

"This store is huge, and there's a wide variety of interesting costumes."

– Kellyanne L., Haverhill MA – yelp
