Rye Rye has released a visual accompaniment to her new single, the Robyn-featuring “Never Will Be Mine”. The video, which you can watch above, opens with the 20-year old MC walking the streets of Los Angeles in a generally low key, yellow get up before the camera pans on to our favorite Swede, who is clad in what has to be one of the most colorful jumpsuits on the planet. So, yeah, Robyn wins again.

“Never Will Be Mine” is set to appear on Rye Rye’s debut LP, ­Go! Pop! Bang!, which is seemingly never actually going to be released.
