        "text": "Reading this on mobile? Click here to listen\n\nIn the rush to hail Psy's horse-riding moves in Gangnam Style as 2012's ultimate dance craze, people seem to be forgetting about the Scissor Sister's brilliantly ridiculous Let's Have a Kiki, the instructional video to which is better than any zumba workout. Basically, for the chorus, you just point skywards, then put your arms in front of you as if you're shutting a door, point skywards again and then wiggle your bum about. Simple. In the UK the song has yet to move past \"viral hit\" (although the band are performing it on Strictly Come Dancing this weekend, so that might change). It recently peaked at No 1 on the US Billboard club chart, however, and this rollicking reworking, courtesy of Toddla T and premiered in this space, might help that continue. It's one of those remixes that sort of does away with most of the original song (hence the name change), in this case replacing the chorus and verses with a fairly graphic feature from Spank Rock and an urgent admonishment from Rye Rye (\"Calling all sluts to the dancefloor\"). All together now: \"I wanna have a kiki, bitch.\""
