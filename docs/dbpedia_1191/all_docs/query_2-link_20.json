That was wild\n\nOh hell no she should get payed.\n\nlol at her casually admitting she possibly knew things about the allegations against Diplo ðŸ™ƒ\n\nYeah just read the rest ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬\n\nWHEW what a blast from the past omg! I havenâ€™t heard rye ryeâ€™s name in like 10 years\n\nHello! Your entry got to top-25 of the most popular entries in LiveJournal!\n\nLearn more about LiveJournal Ratings in FAQ.\n\nyassssssssssssss\n\nI feel like...her lyrics kind of go against the original song in some way? Or at least it's a different message.\n\nYou had me until the last one sis, but do get your credit and coin\n\nShe should get her credit and a fair compensation.\n\nAlso, girl, delete that last tweet. Not a good look.\n\nI saw a Rye Rye vinyl at a West Virginia TJ Maxx like five years ago and I thought it was the most random thing, literally the only vinyl in the entire store.\n\nThe Dom Rimini Nasty Boy remix of \"Hardcore Girls\" was my jam back in the day. Hope she gets properly acknowledged and paid. She didn't record that for charity.\n\nEdited at 2022-07-07 04:58 pm (UTC)\n\nShe has people and has never gotten credit for anything. You need new people.\n\nAnd you thought being loyal to an abuser and he would somehow shine back on you.\n\nSome hard lessons to learn.\n\nKeep at it I'm sure they will write a check quick but still no edit credit.\n\nYikes at that last tweet, but I think it also shows the power dynamic of why people stay loyal to abusers, especially in the entertainment industry. She just said it outloud.\n\nIf I'm not making sense, forgive me. I'm still trying to wake up from my meds.\n\nYou're making sense, bb. It's true. She most likely didn't say anything, because of Diplo's position in the industry. Also she's a Black woman, so there's another layer of why she decided to stay mum. He's a powerful white man and we know how those who speak out often get treated by the industry and the public.\n\nEdited at 2022-07-07 01:05 pm (UTC)\n\nI hope that now that she opened the gate, that she'll slam open that door and spill since he acts like she doesn't exist.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - slinkydinks Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - slinkydinks Expand\n\nMakes me think of Doja and her contractual loyalty to Dr.Puke\n\nMTE\n\nLove the songs she did with Laganja Estranja and Bassnectar, give her her money!!!\n\nI love Iâ€™m gonna celebrate my legendary ass voice ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†\n\nJust remember her from this. Classic!\n\nthe rest of those tweets yikesðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬\n\nEdited at 2022-07-07 01:56 pm (UTC)\n\nðŸ˜‚ Why is this moment literally the only thing I remember from this movie??\n\nI wonder when Diplo and his constant grooming of male and female POC is going to come out, it's been like an open secret and I don't get it.\n\nthat last tweet. men will never stand up for you, why cover for them? ugh."
