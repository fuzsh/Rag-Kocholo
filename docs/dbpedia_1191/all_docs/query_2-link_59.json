        "text": "\"REALLY @Drake MY VOCALS AGAIN?\" Rye Rye tweeted. \"& NO CREDIT? I really wanna be flattered but I feel like it’s trolling ATP OMG …one of my fave artists doing this I don’t know how to feel anymore. But thank you for reminding me that my 15 year old vocals are still legendary. This is not funny this sent me into a deep depression and made me angry inside the first time. Now I gotta relive this again after I was semi trying to push through. WTF I wanna be happy but like how.\n\nRye Rye's Original Tweet About Drake Sample\n\nMore Tweets From Rye Rye\n\n\"That s**t takes nothing at all,\" she went on. \"When I used the 'anything you can do I can do better' sample in my song it was my label job to CLEAR that before it came out. This for all the ppl saying it’s the producers. Yea ultimately BUT if you’re on a major they should be clearing all samples prior to releasing. And I’m not venting to social media thinking it’s gonna get me paid. But some ppl can see it and offer help/advice. Also it’s my voice ppl know it and bringing it to my attention so I can speak on it if I want tf yall weird af. \" For more news and updates on Rye Rye, Drake, and For All The Dogs, log back into HNHH."
