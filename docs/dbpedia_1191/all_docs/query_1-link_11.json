        "text": "Scene 1\n\nSynopsis:\n\nProspero releases Ferdinand and gives him Miranda as his bride-to-be. To celebrate the prospect of their union, Prospero instructs Ariel to have the spirits under Prospero’s control perform a masque. During the masque, Prospero remembers the threat posed by Caliban and stops the masque. He joins Ariel in driving off Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo with spirits in the guise of dogs.\n\nEnter Prospero, Ferdinand, and Miranda.\n\nPROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝\n\n1670 If I have too austerely punished you,\n\n1671 Your compensation makes amends, for I\n\n1672 Have given you here a third of mine own life,\n\n1673 Or that for which I live; who once again\n\n1674 5 I tender to thy hand. All thy vexations\n\n1675 Were but my trials of thy love, and thou\n\n1676 Hast strangely stood the test. Here afore heaven\n\n1677 I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,\n\n1678 Do not smile at me that I boast ⌜of her,⌝\n\n1679 10 For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise\n\n1680 And make it halt behind her.\n\nFERDINAND 1681 I do believe it\n\n1682 Against an oracle.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1683 Then, as my ⌜gift⌝ and thine own acquisition\n\n1684 15 Worthily purchased, take my daughter. But\n\n1685 If thou dost break her virgin-knot before\n\n1686 All sanctimonious ceremonies may\n\n1687 With full and holy rite be ministered,\n\n1688 No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall\n\n1689 20 To make this contract grow; but barren hate,\n\n1690 Sour-eyed disdain, and discord shall bestrew\n\np. 123\n\n1691 The union of your bed with weeds so loathly\n\n1692 That you shall hate it both. Therefore take heed,\n\n1693 As Hymen’s lamps shall light you.\n\nFERDINAND 1694 25 As I hope\n\n1695 For quiet days, fair issue, and long life,\n\n1696 With such love as ’tis now, the murkiest den,\n\n1697 The most opportune place, the strong’st suggestion\n\n1698 Our worser genius can shall never melt\n\n1699 30 Mine honor into lust to take away\n\n1700 The edge of that day’s celebration\n\n1701 When I shall think or Phoebus’ steeds are foundered\n\n1702 Or night kept chained below.\n\nPROSPERO 1703 Fairly spoke.\n\n1704 35 Sit then and talk with her. She is thine own.\n\n⌜Ferdinand and Miranda move aside.⌝\n\n1705 What, Ariel, my industrious servant, Ariel!\n\nEnter Ariel.\n\nARIEL\n\n1706 What would my potent master? Here I am.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1707 Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service\n\n1708 Did worthily perform, and I must use you\n\n1709 40 In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,\n\n1710 O’er whom I give thee power, here to this place.\n\n1711 Incite them to quick motion, for I must\n\n1712 Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple\n\n1713 Some vanity of mine art. It is my promise,\n\n1714 45 And they expect it from me.\n\nARIEL 1715 Presently?\n\nPROSPERO 1716 Ay, with a twink.\n\nARIEL\n\n1717 Before you can say “Come” and “Go,”\n\n1718 And breathe twice, and cry “So, so,”\n\n1719 50 Each one, tripping on his toe,\n\n1720 Will be here with mop and mow.\n\n1721 Do you love me, master? No?\n\np. 125\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1722 Dearly, my delicate Ariel. Do not approach\n\n1723 Till thou dost hear me call.\n\nARIEL 1724 55 Well; I conceive.\n\nHe exits.\n\nPROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝\n\n1725 Look thou be true; do not give dalliance\n\n1726 Too much the rein. The strongest oaths are straw\n\n1727 To th’ fire i’ th’ blood. Be more abstemious,\n\n1728 Or else goodnight your vow.\n\nFERDINAND 1729 60 I warrant you, sir,\n\n1730 The white cold virgin snow upon my heart\n\n1731 Abates the ardor of my liver.\n\nPROSPERO 1732 Well.—\n\n1733 Now come, my Ariel. Bring a corollary\n\n1734 65 Rather than want a spirit. Appear, and pertly.\n\nSoft music.\n\n1735 No tongue. All eyes. Be silent.\n\nEnter Iris.\n\nIRIS\n\n1736 Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas\n\n1737 Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats, and peas;\n\n1738 Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,\n\n1739 70 And flat meads thatched with stover, them to keep;\n\n1740 Thy banks with pionèd and twillèd brims,\n\n1741 Which spongy April at thy hest betrims\n\n1742 To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy\n\n1743 broom groves,\n\n1744 75 Whose shadow the dismissèd bachelor loves,\n\n1745 Being lass-lorn; thy poll-clipped vineyard,\n\n1746 And thy sea marge, sterile and rocky hard,\n\n1747 Where thou thyself dost air—the Queen o’ th’ sky,\n\n1748 Whose wat’ry arch and messenger am I,\n\n1749 80 Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,\n\n1750 Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,\n\np. 127\n\n1751 To come and sport. ⌜Her⌝ peacocks fly amain.\n\n1752 Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.\n\nEnter Ceres.\n\nCERES\n\n1753 Hail, many-colored messenger, that ne’er\n\n1754 85 Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;\n\n1755 Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers\n\n1756 Diffusest honey drops, refreshing showers;\n\n1757 And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown\n\n1758 My bosky acres and my unshrubbed down,\n\n1759 90 Rich scarf to my proud Earth. Why hath thy queen\n\n1760 Summoned me hither to this short-grassed green?\n\nIRIS\n\n1761 A contract of true love to celebrate,\n\n1762 And some donation freely to estate\n\n1763 On the blest lovers.\n\nCERES 1764 95 Tell me, heavenly bow,\n\n1765 If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,\n\n1766 Do now attend the Queen? Since they did plot\n\n1767 The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,\n\n1768 Her and her blind boy’s scandaled company\n\n1769 100 I have forsworn.\n\nIRIS 1770 Of her society\n\n1771 Be not afraid. I met her deity\n\n1772 Cutting the clouds towards Paphos, and her son\n\n1773 Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have\n\n1774 105 done\n\n1775 Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,\n\n1776 Whose vows are that no bed-right shall be paid\n\n1777 Till Hymen’s torch be lighted—but in vain.\n\n1778 Mars’s hot minion is returned again;\n\n1779 110 Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\n\n1780 Swears he will shoot no more, but play with\n\n1781 sparrows,\n\n1782 And be a boy right out.\n\np. 129\n\nJuno descends.\n\nCERES 1783 Highest queen of state,\n\n1784 115 Great Juno, comes. I know her by her gait.\n\nJUNO\n\n1785 How does my bounteous sister? Go with me\n\n1786 To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be\n\n1787 And honored in their issue.\n\nThey sing.\n\nJUNO\n\n1788 Honor, riches, marriage-blessing,\n\n1789 120 Long continuance and increasing,\n\n1790 Hourly joys be still upon you.\n\n1791 Juno sings her blessings on you.\n\n⌜CERES⌝\n\n1792 Earth’s increase, foison plenty,\n\n1793 Barns and garners never empty,\n\n1794 125 Vines with clust’ring bunches growing,\n\n1795 Plants with goodly burden bowing;\n\n1796 Spring come to you at the farthest\n\n1797 In the very end of harvest.\n\n1798 Scarcity and want shall shun you.\n\n1799 130 Ceres’ blessing so is on you.\n\nFERDINAND\n\n1800 This is a most majestic vision, and\n\n1801 Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold\n\n1802 To think these spirits?\n\nPROSPERO 1803 Spirits, which by mine art\n\n1804 135 I have from their confines called to enact\n\n1805 My present fancies.\n\nFERDINAND 1806 Let me live here ever.\n\n1807 So rare a wondered father and a wise\n\n1808 Makes this place paradise.\n\nJuno and Ceres whisper,\n\nand send Iris on employment.\n\nPROSPERO 1809 140 Sweet now, silence.\n\np. 131\n\n1810 Juno and Ceres whisper seriously.\n\n1811 There’s something else to do. Hush, and be mute,\n\n1812 Or else our spell is marred.\n\nIRIS\n\n1813 You nymphs, called naiads of the windring brooks,\n\n1814 145 With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,\n\n1815 Leave your crisp channels and on this green land\n\n1816 Answer your summons, Juno does command.\n\n1817 Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate\n\n1818 A contract of true love. Be not too late.\n\nEnter certain Nymphs.\n\n1819 150 You sunburned sicklemen, of August weary,\n\n1820 Come hither from the furrow and be merry.\n\n1821 Make holiday: your rye-straw hats put on,\n\n1822 And these fresh nymphs encounter every one\n\n1823 In country footing.\n\nEnter certain Reapers, properly habited. They join with\n\nthe Nymphs in a graceful dance, towards the end\n\nwhereof Prospero starts suddenly and speaks.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1824 155 I had forgot that foul conspiracy\n\n1825 Of the beast Caliban and his confederates\n\n1826 Against my life. The minute of their plot\n\n1827 Is almost come.—Well done. Avoid. No more.\n\nTo a strange, hollow, and confused noise,\n\n⌜the spirits⌝ heavily vanish.\n\nFERDINAND, ⌜to Miranda⌝\n\n1828 This is strange. Your father’s in some passion\n\n1829 160 That works him strongly.\n\nMIRANDA 1830 Never till this day\n\n1831 Saw I him touched with anger, so distempered.\n\nPROSPERO, ⌜to Ferdinand⌝\n\n1832 You do look, my son, in a moved sort,\n\n1833 As if you were dismayed. Be cheerful, sir.\n\np. 133\n\n1834 165 Our revels now are ended. These our actors,\n\n1835 As I foretold you, were all spirits and\n\n1836 Are melted into air, into thin air;\n\n1837 And like the baseless fabric of this vision,\n\n1838 The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\n\n1839 170 The solemn temples, the great globe itself,\n\n1840 Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\n\n1841 And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\n\n1842 Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\n\n1843 As dreams are made on, and our little life\n\n1844 175 Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.\n\n1845 Bear with my weakness. My old brain is troubled.\n\n1846 Be not disturbed with my infirmity.\n\n1847 If you be pleased, retire into my cell\n\n1848 And there repose. A turn or two I’ll walk\n\n1849 180 To still my beating mind.\n\nFERDINAND/MIRANDA 1850 We wish your peace.\n\n⌜They⌝ exit.\n\nEnter Ariel.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1851 Come with a thought. I thank thee, Ariel. Come.\n\nARIEL\n\n1852 Thy thoughts I cleave to. What’s thy pleasure?\n\nPROSPERO 1853 Spirit,\n\n1854 185 We must prepare to meet with Caliban.\n\nARIEL\n\n1855 Ay, my commander. When I presented Ceres,\n\n1856 I thought to have told thee of it, but I feared\n\n1857 Lest I might anger thee.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1858 Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?\n\nARIEL\n\n1859 190 I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking,\n\n1860 So full of valor that they smote the air\n\n1861 For breathing in their faces, beat the ground\n\np. 135\n\n1862 For kissing of their feet; yet always bending\n\n1863 Towards their project. Then I beat my tabor,\n\n1864 195 At which, like unbacked colts, they pricked their\n\n1865 ears,\n\n1866 Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses\n\n1867 As they smelt music. So I charmed their ears\n\n1868 That, calf-like, they my lowing followed through\n\n1869 200 Toothed briers, sharp furzes, pricking gorse, and\n\n1870 thorns,\n\n1871 Which entered their frail shins. At last I left them\n\n1872 I’ th’ filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\n\n1873 There dancing up to th’ chins, that the foul lake\n\n1874 205 O’erstunk their feet.\n\nPROSPERO 1875 This was well done, my bird.\n\n1876 Thy shape invisible retain thou still.\n\n1877 The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither\n\n1878 For stale to catch these thieves.\n\nARIEL 1879 210 I go, I go.He exits.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1880 A devil, a born devil, on whose nature\n\n1881 Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,\n\n1882 Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;\n\n1883 And as with age his body uglier grows,\n\n1884 215 So his mind cankers. I will plague them all\n\n1885 Even to roaring.\n\nEnter Ariel, loaden with glistering apparel, etc.\n\n1886 Come, hang ⌜them on⌝ this line.\n\nEnter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all wet, ⌜as\n\nProspero and Ariel look on.⌝\n\nCALIBAN 1887 Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole\n\n1888 may not hear a footfall. We now are near his cell.\n\nSTEPHANO 1889 220Monster, your fairy, which you say is a\n\n1890 harmless fairy, has done little better than played the\n\n1891 jack with us.\n\np. 137\n\nTRINCULO 1892 Monster, I do smell all horse piss, at which\n\n1893 my nose is in great indignation.\n\nSTEPHANO 1894 225So is mine.—Do you hear, monster. If I\n\n1895 should take a displeasure against you, look you—\n\nTRINCULO 1896 Thou wert but a lost monster.\n\nCALIBAN\n\n1897 Good my lord, give me thy favor still.\n\n1898 Be patient, for the prize I’ll bring thee to\n\n1899 230 Shall hoodwink this mischance. Therefore speak\n\n1900 softly.\n\n1901 All’s hushed as midnight yet.\n\nTRINCULO 1902 Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool!\n\nSTEPHANO 1903 There is not only disgrace and dishonor in\n\n1904 235 that, monster, but an infinite loss.\n\nTRINCULO 1905 That’s more to me than my wetting. Yet this\n\n1906 is your harmless fairy, monster!\n\nSTEPHANO 1907 I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o’er\n\n1908 ears for my labor.\n\nCALIBAN\n\n1909 240 Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,\n\n1910 This is the mouth o’ th’ cell. No noise, and enter.\n\n1911 Do that good mischief which may make this island\n\n1912 Thine own forever, and I, thy Caliban,\n\n1913 For aye thy foot-licker.\n\nSTEPHANO 1914 245Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody\n\n1915 thoughts.\n\nTRINCULO, ⌜seeing the apparel⌝ 1916 O King Stephano, O\n\n1917 peer, O worthy Stephano, look what a wardrobe\n\n1918 here is for thee!\n\nCALIBAN\n\n1919 250 Let it alone, thou fool. It is but trash.\n\nTRINCULO 1920 Oho, monster, we know what belongs to a\n\n1921 frippery. ⌜He puts on one of the gowns.⌝ O King\n\n1922 Stephano!\n\nSTEPHANO 1923 Put off that gown, Trinculo. By this hand,\n\n1924 255 I’ll have that gown.\n\np. 139\n\nTRINCULO 1925 Thy Grace shall have it.\n\nCALIBAN\n\n1926 The dropsy drown this fool! What do you mean\n\n1927 To dote thus on such luggage? ⌜Let ’t⌝ alone,\n\n1928 And do the murder first. If he awake,\n\n1929 260 From toe to crown he’ll fill our skins with pinches,\n\n1930 Make us strange stuff.\n\nSTEPHANO 1931 Be you quiet, monster.—Mistress Line, is\n\n1932 not this my jerkin?⌜He takes a jacket from the tree.⌝\n\n1933 Now is the jerkin under the line.—Now, jerkin, you\n\n1934 265 are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin.\n\nTRINCULO 1935 Do, do. We steal by line and level, an ’t like\n\n1936 your Grace.\n\nSTEPHANO 1937 I thank thee for that jest. Here’s a garment\n\n1938 for ’t. Wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king\n\n1939 270 of this country. “Steal by line and level” is an excellent\n\n1940 pass of pate. There’s another garment for ’t.\n\nTRINCULO 1941 Monster, come, put some lime upon your\n\n1942 fingers, and away with the rest.\n\nCALIBAN\n\n1943 I will have none on ’t. We shall lose our time\n\n1944 275 And all be turned to barnacles or to apes\n\n1945 With foreheads villainous low.\n\nSTEPHANO 1946 Monster, lay to your fingers. Help to bear\n\n1947 this away where my hogshead of wine is, or I’ll turn\n\n1948 you out of my kingdom. Go to, carry this.\n\nTRINCULO 1949 280And this.\n\nSTEPHANO 1950 Ay, and this.\n\nA noise of hunters heard.\n\nEnter divers spirits in shape of dogs and hounds,\n\nhunting them about, Prospero and Ariel setting them on.\n\nPROSPERO 1951 Hey, Mountain, hey!\n\nARIEL 1952 Silver! There it goes, Silver!\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1953 Fury, Fury! There, Tyrant, there! Hark, hark!\n\n⌜Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo are driven off.⌝\n\np. 141\n\n1954 285 Go, charge my goblins that they grind their joints\n\n1955 With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews\n\n1956 With agèd cramps, and more pinch-spotted make\n\n1957 them\n\n1958 Than pard or cat o’ mountain.\n\nARIEL 1959 290 Hark, they roar.\n\nPROSPERO\n\n1960 Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour\n\n1961 Lies at my mercy all mine enemies.\n\n1962 Shortly shall all my labors end, and thou\n\n1963 Shalt have the air at freedom. For a little\n\n1964 295 Follow and do me service.\n\nThey exit."
