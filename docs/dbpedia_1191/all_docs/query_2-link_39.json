The earliest record of the song may be a chapbook with the title Ridges of Rye printed in Glasgow by J. & M. Robertson in 1799.\n\nArchie Fisher sang The Rigs oâ Rye on the Fisher Familyâs 1966 Topic album Traditional & New Songs From Scotland. Norman Buchan noted on the album sleeve:\n\nA love song from the great singing area of Scotland, the North-East. In the 1920s Superintendent Ord published his Bothy Ballads. Despite his puritan excisions it remains one of the best collections of such songs. Like Greig before him, but without his scholarship, he collected them from the ploomen and kitchie deems of Aberdeenshire. Perhaps because of the larger size of the farms in the Buchan area, the right number of workers were available for a ceilidh in the bothies and the songs remained here long after they tended to die out elsewhere. This song—and others like it—with its narrative line, its pretended betrayal, and its specific references (Brechin and Montrose) is worth contrasting to the rather abstract love-songs of Burns and undoubtedly guides us as to the kind of material from which his songs were created.\n\nSara Grey and Ed Trickett sang Rigs of Rye in 1970 on their eponymous Folk-Legacy album Sara Grey with Ed Trickett. Sara Paton noted:\n\nSara learned this lovely Scottish song from Archie Fisher who recorded it on The Fisher Family. A Glasgow organist named J.B. Allan collected the song from an ex-Aberdeenshire plowman and it was then published in John Ordâs Bothy Songs and Ballads (1930). G. Malcolm Laws, listing Two Rigs of Rye as O11 in his American Balladry from British Broadsides, refers to versions from England, Michigan, and Maine—the last (found in BFSSNE, see below) sounding quite different with its Americanised language and unhappy ending.\n\n“Rig” is a form of “ridge”, meaning a raised strip of land between the furrows of plowed field. Brechin and Montrose are two neighbouring towns in northeast Scotland.\n\nThe song has also been recorded by Gordeanna McCulloch on The Clutha. Printed references include Sing Out, XXII No. 6, Bulletin of the Folk-Song Society of the Northeast, No. 1, 1930 (as Sweet July), and Folk Songs and Ballads of Scotland, edited by Ewan MacColl.\n\nBarbara Dickson was recorded singing The Rigs oâ Rye live in some folk club, possibly The Elbow Room, Cuckold, or the Brig, Leeds, in between 1969-73. This recording was included in 2013 on her album B4 Seventy-Four: The Folkclub Tapes. A June 1968 recording from Braes in the parish of Portee, Isle of Skye, can be heard on Tobar an Dualchais. She also sang The Rigs oâ Rye on the 2019 Fylde Guitars tribute anthology Strings That Nimble Leap.\n\nThis video shown Barbara Dickson singing The Rigs oâ Rye at Sandy Bellâs in Edinburgh in 2007, accompanied by Troy Donockley on guitar:\n\nThe Clutha sang The Rigs oâ Rye in 1974 on their Topic album Scots Ballads, Songs & Dance Tunes. Don Martin commented in the liner notes:\n\nFrom John Ordâs Bothy Songs and Ballads. Noted down by J.B. Allan, a Glasgow organist, from the singing of an ex-Aberdeenshire ploughman. The simple romantic sentiments of country songs of this type should not be confused with the contrived luxuriance of products of the kailyaird school.\n\nDick Gaughan sang Rigs oâ Rye in 1977 on his Trailer album Kist oâ Gold. He noted:\n\nA very popular song at the time I started singing publicly. Canât recall now where I learned it but it is included in several collections of songs from the North East of Scotland and it is part of the core repertoire of many singers in that part of the world.\n\nJane Turriff sang Rigs oâ Rye at West Church Hall, Kinross Festival in 1979. This recording by Allan Palmer was included in 1996 on her Springthyme CD Singin Is Ma Life and in 2000 on the EFDSS anthology Everybody Swings. The original albumâs booklet noted:\n\nThirty-five versions of Hamish Hendersonâs favourite Jane Turriff song appear in the Greig-Duncan collection, including this fine verse:\n\nThis couple they are married noo,\n\nAnd they have bairnies one or two,\n\nAnd live in Brittany the winter through,\n\nAnd in Montrose in summer.\n\nJane: “Oh itâs a great song, itâs a great song. Itâs ma grandmaâs song I learned aff o ma Ma.”\n\nRobin Dransfield sang The Rigs oâ Rye in 1980 on his Topic album Tidewave. A live recording from the Medway Folk Centre, 14 November 1972 was included as bonus track on the albumâs CD reissue.\n\nA recording of Fred Jordan singing The Rigs of Rye made by Dave Bryant in 1978 or 1979 was included on his Veteran anthology A Shropshire Lad. Mike Yates noted:\n\nIt is not surprising that Fred should have picked up this fine Scottish song, which he probably first heard in a folk club or festival. At one time it must have been extremely well-known throughout Scotland, with Gavin Greig collecting at least 35 sets. John Ord, who included the song in his 1930 collection of Bothy Songs and Ballads, was clearly unaware of Greigâs work when he wrote, “This fine old country song appears to have been missed by all the well-known collectors.” A chapbook version, dated 1806 and titled The Ridges of Rye, is housed in the Glasgow University Library.\n\nThe Tannahill Weavers sang The Rigs oâ Rye in 1996 on their Green Linnet album Leaving St. Kilda. They noted:\n\nA classic ballad of love over money, although you do get the impression that the hero would rather have both.\n\nNorman Kennedy sang The Rigs o Rye at live concerts in Aberdeen in 1996. This recording by Tom Spiers was included in 2002 on Kennedyâs Tradition Bearers album Live in Scotland.\n\nNiamh Parsons sang Rigs of Rye in 2002 on her Green Linnet album Heartâs Desire. She noted:\n\nI learnt this from my friend Declan Fay. He has a great eye for songs and has been suggesting them to me for nearly 20 years. He learnt this from the singing of Robin Dransfield.\n\nJune Tabor sang The Rigs of Rye on her 2007 Topic CD Apples. She commented in her sleeve notes:\n\nLike the broken token ballad (e.g. The Plains of Waterloo), the classic Scottish love song The Rigs of Rye, in which a girlâs resolve and loyalty are put to the test, shows at least a belief in the power of true love, whatever the reality might have been.\n\nThe Australian family group The Fagans learned The Rigs of Rye from the singing of Robin Dransfield when they lived in England in 1981. They recorded it in 2009 for their CD Milk and Honey Land.\n\nJim Taylor sang Rigs oâ Rye live at the Fife Traditional Singing Festival, Collessie, Fife in May 2009. This recording was included in 2010 on the festival CD Thereâs Bound to Be a Row (Old Songs & Bothy Ballads Vol. 6). The albumâs booklet tersely noted:\n\nThis beautiful love song has long been popular, with thirty-five versions in the Greig-Duncan collection.\n\nAndy Turner learned The Rigs of Rye from Dick Gaughanâs album and from the words in Ordâs book Bothy Songs and Ballads. He sang it on 27 July 2012 as the week 49 entry of his project A Folk Song a Week.\n\nThis video shows Shelagh McDonald singing Rigs oâ Rye at Aâ the Airts, Sanquhar, Dumfries & Galloway, on 29 March 2013:\n\nGeorge Duff sang The Rigs oâ Rye in 2016 on his CD The Collier Laddie.\n\nDougie Mackenzie sang The Rigs oâ Rye on his 2019 Greentrax album Along the Way. He noted:\n\nA young lad is testing his lass to be sure of her love. This much-loved song can be found in the Greig-Duncan collection Vol 5.\n\nIona Fyfe taught Rigs oâ Rye on 5 May 2020 in her Traditional Ballad Workshop #2 on her Patreon page.\n\nLyrics\n\nSara Grey sings The Rigs of Rye\n\nâTwas in the month of sweet July,\n\nBefore the sun had pierced the sky,\n\nI sat between two rigs of rye,\n\nAnd I heard two lovers talking.\n\nThis lad said, “Lassie, I must away;\n\nI have no longer time to stay.\n\nBut Iâve a word or two to say,\n\nIf youâve got time to tarry.\n\n“Your father of you he takâs great care,\n\nYour mother combs doon your yellow hair;\n\nYour sisters say that youâll get nae share\n\nIf you gang wiâ me, a stranger.”\n\n“Let my father fret and my mother frown;\n\nMy sistersâ words I do disown.\n\nThough they were deid and below the ground,\n\nI would gang with you, a stranger.”\n\n“Oh, lassie, lassie, your fortuneâs smaâ,\n\nAnd, though it may be nane at aâ,\n\nIâm noâ a match for you at aâ.\n\nGo lay your love on some other.”\n\nThis lassieâs courage began to fail,\n\nHer rosy cheeks they grew wan and pale,\n\nAnd the tears camâ trickling doon like hail\n\nOr a heavy shower in summer.\n\nHeâs taâen his handkerchief, linen fine,\n\nHe s dried her tears, and he s kissed her syne,\n\nSaying, “Lassie, lassie you will he mine;\n\nI said it all to try thee.”\n\nThis lad being courage hold,\n\nA lad scarcely nineteen years old,\n\nHeâs ranged the hills and the valleys oâer,\n\nAnd he s ta en his lassie with him.\n\nThis couple they are married noo,\n\nAnd they have bairnies one and two,\n\nAnd they live in Brechin the winter through,\n\nAnd in Montrose in summer.\n\nDick Gaughan sings Rigs oâ Rye\n\nTwas in the month o sweet July\n\nAfore the sun had pierced the sky,\n\nTwas in below yon rigs o rye\n\nThat I heard twa lovers talkin.\n\nThe lad said, “Lass, I must away,\n\nI have nae langer time tae stay.\n\nBut Iâve a word or two tae say\n\nIf yeâve the time, love, tae tarry.”\n\n“Yer faither o you he taks great care,\n\nYer mither ties up your gowden hair.\n\nYer sister says ye will get nae share\n\nIf ye gang wi me, love, a stranger.”\n\n“Let my faither fret an my mither froun,\n\nMy sisterâs words I do disown.\n\nTho they were deid an below the grun,\n\nI wad gang wi ye, love, a stranger.”\n\n“O lassie, lassie, yer fortuneâs smaa,\n\nPerhaps it will be nane at aa.\n\nYeâre no a match for me at aa,\n\nGae lay ye yer love on some ither.”\n\nThe lassieâs courage began tae fail,\n\nHer lips grew wan an her cheeks grew pale.\n\nHer tears cam tricklin doun like hail\n\nOr a heavy shower in the simmer.\n\nAn the laddie he bein o courage fine,\n\nHeâs taen her up an heâs kissed her syne,\n\nSayin, “Lassie, lassie, ye will be mine,\n\nI said it aa for tae try ye.”\n\nAn the laddie he bein o courage bauld,\n\nA lad scarcely nineteen years auld.\n\nHeâs ranged the hills an the valleys ower\n\nAn heâs taen his bonnie lassie wi him.\n\nAn this couple thae are mairriet nou\n\nAn thae hae bairnies, ane or two,\n\nThae live in Brechin the winter thro\n\nAn in Montrose in the simmer.\n\nJane Turriff sings The Rigs of Rye\n\nIt wis in between twa rigs o rye,\n\nWhen I heard two lovers talkin;\n\n“I hear my love you are going away,\n\nAn no longer here you mean to stay.”\n\n“I will give to you, five hundered pounds\n\nIf youâll marry me a poor stranger;\n\nLet mammy weep, let daddy frown,\n\nLet sisterâs words fall to the ground;\n\nBut I will lay down five hundered pounds,\n\nIf youâll marry me a poor stranger.”\n\nFor it wis in between twa rigs o rye\n\nWhen I heard two lovers talkin;\n\n“I hear my love you are going away,\n\nNo longer here you mean to stay;\n\nBut I will lay down five hundred pounds\n\nIf youâll marry me a poor stranger.”\n\nThe tears came fallin from her eye,\n\nLike a heavy shower in summer bloom;\n\nBut he held his hankie rollin fine\n\nAnd he kissed her cheeks and dimples fine.\n\n“I hear my love you are going away,\n\nNo longer here you mean to stay,\n\nBut I will lay down five hundered pounds,\n\nIf youâll marry me, a poor stranger.”\n\nFred Jordan sings The Rigs of Rye\n\nâTwas in the month of sweet July\n\nBefore the sun had pierced the sky\n\nâTwas down among the rigs oâ rye\n\nI heard two lovers talking.\n\nSaid the laddie, “Lassie I must away\n\nI have no longer time to stay\n\nBut Iâve a word or two to say\n\nIf youâd with me tarry,\n\n“Oh, your father of you, oh, he takes great care\n\nYour mother combs down your golden hair\n\nWell your sister says that youâll get no share\n\nIf you go with me, a stranger.”\n\n“Let my father fret and my mother frown\n\nMy sisterâs words I do disown\n\nThough they were dead and beneath the ground\n\nIâd go with you, a stranger.”\n\n“But, lassie, lassie, your fortuneâs small\n\nAnd maybe will have none at all\n\nAnd youâre no match for me at all\n\nGo lay your love on another.”\n\nThis lassieâs courage began to fail\n\nHer rosy cheeks they grew wan and pale\n\nAnd tears came trickling down like hail\n\nOr a heavy shower in the summer,\n\nBut heâs taken his handkerchief linen fine\n\nHeâs wiped her teardrops from her eyen\n\n“Oh, Lassie, lassie you will be mine\n\nI only meant to try you.”\n\nThis couple now, they married are\n\nAnd they have bairnies one and two\n\nAnd they live in Brechin the winter through\n\nAnd in Montrose in the summer.\n\nJune Tabor sings The Rigs of Rye\n\nâTwas in the month of sweet July,\n\nBefore the sun had pierced the sky;\n\nDown between two rigs of rye\n\nI heard two lovers talking.\n\nSaid he, “Lassie, I must away,\n\nAlong with you I cannot stay,\n\nBut Iâve a word or two to say\n\nIf youâve the time to listen.”\n\n“Of your father he takes great care,\n\nYour mother combs your yellow hair;\n\nBut your sisters say youâll get no share\n\nIf you follow me, a stranger.”\n\n“My father may fret and my mother may frown,\n\nMy sisters too I do disown;\n\nIf they were all dead and below the ground\n\nI would follow you, a stranger.”\n\n“Oh lassie, lassie, your portionâs small,\n\nPerhaps it may be none at all.\n\nYouâre not a match for me at all\n\nSo go and wed with some other.”\n\nThe lassieâs courage began to fail,\n\nHer rosy cheeks grew wan and pale;\n\nAnd the tears come trickling down like hail,\n\nOr a heavy shower in the summer.\n\nThis lad he being of courage fine,\n\nHeâs dried her tears and heâs kissed her eyes,\n\nSaying, “Weep no more lass, you shall be mine,\n\nI said it all to try you.”"
