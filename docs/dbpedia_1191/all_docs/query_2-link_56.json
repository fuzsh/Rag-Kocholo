Ev'ry lassie has her laddie; Nane, they say, has I; Yet a' the lads they smile at me, When comin' thro' the rye. Amang the train there is a swain I dearly lo'e mysel', But whaur his hame, or what his name, I dinna care to tell.\n\nSecond verse\n\nGin a body meet a body Comin' thro' the town, Gin a body greet a body, Need a body frown? Ev'ry lassie has her laddie; Nane, they say, has I; Yet a' the lads they smile at me, When comin' thro' the rye. Amang the train there is a swain I dearly lo'e mysel', But whaur his hame, or what his name, I dinna care to tell.\n\nContent Disclaimer\n\nSome of the images and language that appear in the digital collections depict prejudices that are not condoned by the University of Mississippi.
