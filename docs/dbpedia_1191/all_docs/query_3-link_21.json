        "text": "Reading this on a mobile? Click here to view\n\nWhen MIA shouted about this Bad Girls remix on Twitter last month (\"BAD GIRLS REMIXES COMING SOON !!!!!!\" she said, quietly), it was four months after the original had been released as a single and five months since it appeared in demo form on her Vicki Leekx mixtape. Now, we're not ones to start throwing around phrases like \"flogging a dead horse\" or \"get on with the next single MIA\", but she basically seems to be dragging her feet with the follow-up to 2010's Maya. Still, getting Missy Elliott out of what appears to be her semi-retirement is worth celebrating and her verse on Switch's remix is great. Adding some much-needed energy to an intro that floats along on a bed of tweaked drum claps and a looped sample of MIA's son Ikhyd, Missy leaps out of the blocks, spitting lines like \"you get smashed just like ham sandwiches\" as if she's never been away. Not to be outdone, Rye Rye (who's signed to MIA's NEET label) arrives midway through, holding her own over a double-tracked beat and strange sci-fi noises. In fact, it's only MIA that lets the side down slightly, her new verses in the song's final third not quite as energised as her peers.\n\nIf you'd like to own the remix then why not splash out $50 on a gold-plated USB stick that comes on a gold chain? As well as including this remix and some behind the scenes footage of the amazing video, it also features additional mixes by Danja and Leo Justi, one of which includes a collaboration with Azealia Banks."
