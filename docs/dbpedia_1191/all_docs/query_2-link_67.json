        "text": "Last time I covered Swedish songwriter Armadillo King he was wandering around rather aimlessly in his hat, trying to make sense of life in general, and the result was a excellent single called ‚ÄòBorrowed Time‚Äô. I‚Äôd definitely recommend you listen if you missed it the 1st time.\n\nGiven his character and alter ego, I doubted whether we‚Äôd be seeing too many summer pop hits celebrating the July sunshine and barbecues on the beach but here he is with a summer release, albeit catapulted back 150 years over in the American Mid West, which at least that means he‚Äôs still allowed to wear a big jacket and that ever familiar headwear.\n\n‚ÄòDeadwood Rye‚Äò is the name of the song, and there‚Äôs a video to go with it too, which brings the character he portrays to life. It‚Äôs a fairly simple premise, his alter ego ‚Äútrying to get through a regular life, but somehow being roped into some parallel, precarious scenario‚Äù. And I certainly know how he feels, having once had to cross a road in Manila.\n\nAnyway on this occasion he‚Äôs the hard drinking, gun touting bandit style character that apparently he once was in a previous life, and whilst the song isn‚Äôt quite as memorable musically as ‚ÄòBorrowed Time‚Äô, it paints a really vivid picture, and the song has a melodic swagger to it, as if‚Ä¶. well as if it‚Äôs actually best sung whilst half drunk.\n\nThe sepia tinged video itself is fairly straight forward, but works well as an accompaniment to the track, and in just a few songs Armadillo King has done a really effective job in building up the persona and image of the character he‚Äôs portraying. Although for some reason I always find it very unnerving when someone points a gun in my direction via a TV or IPad screen. Am I the only one who ducks?\n\nI look forward to future tracks, he‚Äôs an interesting songwriter and always welcome on these pages."
