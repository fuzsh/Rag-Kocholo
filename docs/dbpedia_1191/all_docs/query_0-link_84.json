        "text": "Ryan Jones began his music career at the age of 5, taking piano lessons from his mother and continuing his musical education into his teens with guidance from Darrel DeCounter, John Anderson’s keyboard player. By 18, he had picked up the acoustic guitar and started writing music with his college roommates.\n\nAfter spending 22 years as a Manager and Director of Operations at luxury resorts across the southeast US, including Horseshoe Bay Resort in Texas, Ryan decided to return to his passion for music in 2018. He officially began performing in late 2019.\n\nPrimarily a country artist, Ryan plays both original songs and covers from artists such as Kenny Chesney, Morgan Wallen, and Garth Brooks. Ryan loves sharing his music with others and has performed at various venues, including restaurants, bars, breweries, and private events throughout Texas and the southwest.\n\nThis concert is free and open to the public.

After graduating from Texas A&M, she embarked on her songwriting path, culminating in the release of her first acoustic album in 2018.\n\nErica Daniels’ music resonates with life’s memories and emotions, offering a personal yet universally relatable perspective.

See y’all there!\n\nJames Hearne, a stalwart of Philadelphia’s indie rock scene, has carved a path as a rock journeyman with his powerhouse vocals and woodsy guitars.\n\nFormer frontman for bands like The Sobriquets and The Way Home, James recently traded the Hudson Valley for the vibrant Austin music scene. His debut LP, “Through Private Wars,” is a testament to his life on the road, capturing the essence of endless travels, deep love, dodgy choices, and hard-living.\n\nDrawing comparisons to the likes of Jason Isbell, Sturgill Simpson, and Ryan Adams, Hearne’s music blends soulful steel-sliding barn-burners with intimate, brittle ballads. His songwriting and dynamic performances have earned him recognition as a notable singer-songwriter talent. With a sound that feels both timeless and deeply personal, Hearne’s work invites listeners into his world, demanding repeated listens on long drives and quiet nights.\n\nThis concert is free and open to the public.
