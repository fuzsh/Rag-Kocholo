        "text": "Rye Rye\n\nThe Baltimore rapper Rye Rye has been announcing her debut album, “Go! Pop! Bang!” (N.E.E.T./Interscope) since 2009, when she was still a teenager. At the time her brash, rapidfire rhymes and skeletal electro tracks had been embraced by M.I.A., who took her on tour and signed her to her label. Then pregnancy, motherhood and newer material put the album in limbo. Three years later, “Go! Pop! Bang!” reflects its long germination. The oldest songs are only on the deluxe version and the Baltimore-style synthesizer jabs are less of a novelty, though they still pump up the songs. Rye Rye also picks up more current developments: a pop-rock song with Akon, a hefty Euro dance anthem from RedOne (Lady Gaga’s producer), and a perky come-on of a single, “Boom Boom,” that improves on a 1998 hit by the Dutch dance-pop group Vengaboys. Even at a venerable 21 years old, Rye Rye is still fast and sassy, with a perky bite in her voice and a cheerleader’s unstoppable pep. What she has on her mind are partying, clothes, guys and one-upping the competition, which all lead straight to the dance floor.\n\nMaga Bo\n\nHand-played percussion and hard-nosed voices are the rocket fuel for Maga Bo’s “Quilombo do Futuro” (Post World Industries), a cultural manifesto riding on rhythm. Make that rhythms. Maga Bo, a widely traveled American D.J. and producer who relocated to Rio de Janeiro in 1999, uses kinetic Afro-Brazilian beats as the album’s foundation and superstructure. But his tracks also mix in drum-machine sounds, stray ricocheting electronics, Brazilian guitars and glimmers of soundsystem bass music like Jamaican dancehall as well as Brazilian baile funk. Atop them — rapping, chanting and singing their own lyrics — are voices that can keep pace with the syncopations or sail above them. In Portuguese and occasionally English, Maga Bo’s collaborators often praise culture as survival mechanism and resistance tactic, while the beats constantly prove them right.\n\nSigur Ros\n\nThe mists have thickened around the songs on “Valtari,” the first Sigur Ros album since 2008. Jonsi, its lead singer, apparently got uptempo songs out of his system on his 2010 solo album, “Go.” It’s back to slow motion for “Valtari,” the kind of exalted, processional melodies and inexorable crescendoes Sigur Ros has been known for from the start. But on this album, the band almost takes its tunes for granted. Each of the new songs looms within a larger, obsessively detailed ambience, a realm of magnified creaks and rustles, children’s voices, tinkling music boxes and shadowy orchestras. It’s as if the band’s old pure musical sanctuary has been overgrown and started to crumble, with different light and air glinting through the cracks."
