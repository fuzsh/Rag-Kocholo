        "text": "But it seems that Drake didn't get permission from some artists. Synth-pop group Pet Shop Boys stated on X (formerly known as Twitter) shortly after the album dropped that Drake did not \"credit\" them for using a line from their 1984 single \"West End Girls\" on \"All the Parties.\"\n\n\"It's six, our town a dead-end world,\" Drake sings on the track. \"East End boys and West End girls, yeah.\"\n\n\"Surprising to hear @Drake singing the chorus of 'West End girls' in the track 'All the Parties' on his new album. No credit given or permission requested,\" the account for the band, which consists of Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe, wrote on Friday.\n\nSimilarly, female rapper Rye Rye took to the social media platform and accused the 36-year-old of using her vocals on \"Calling For You,\" which features 21 Savage.\n\n\"REALLY @Drake MY VOCALS AGAIN? & NO CREDIT? I really wanna be flattered but I feel like it's trolling ATP OMG â€¦one of my fave artists doing this I don't know how to feel anymore but thank you for reminding me that my 15-year-old vocals are still legendary,\" she wrote.\n\nIn a follow-up post, she claimed that the vocals are from \"Shake It To the Ground\" by Rye Rye and DJ Blaqstarr.\n\nRelated stories\n\nRepresentatives for Pet Shop Boys, Rye Rye, and Drake did not respond to requests for comment made outside regular working hours.\n\nThis isn't the first time Drake has found himself in hot water for not asking for permission. In September, Halle Berry made it known that she was unhappy that the rapper had used a photo of her to announce his song \"Slime You Out\" featuring SZA without asking her.\n\nDrake posted a photo of Berry, 57, covered in green slime at the 2012 Kids' Choice Awards on Instagram to announce the song's release on September 14.\n\nBerry did not take too kindly to the use of her image, sharing a quote on Instagram that hinted at her disapproval: \"Sometimes you have to be the bigger guy... Even if you're a woman!\"\n\nShe subsequently confirmed that the post was directed at Drake in the comment section, responding to a user who asked her for her \"thoughts\" on Drake using her photo by saying: \"Didn't get my permission. That's not cool I thought better of him ! Hence my post today.\""
