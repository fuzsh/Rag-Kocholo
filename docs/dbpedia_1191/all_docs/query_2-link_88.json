        "text": "Scottish Song By Robert Burns\n\nComin' Thro' The Rye is a poem written in 1782 by Robert Burns (1759-1796). The words are put to the melody of the Scottish Minstrel, Common' Frae The Town.\n\nThis is a variant of the tune to which Auld Lang Syne is usually sung - the melodic shape is almost identical, the difference lying in the tempo and rhythm.\n\nThere exists much debate regarding the meaning of the words \"Comin' thro' the rye\".\n\nG. W. Napier, in an 1876 Notes and Queries, wrote that,\n\nThe original words of \"Comin' thro' the rye\" cannot be satisfactorily traced. There are many different versions of the song. The version (below) which is now to be found in the Works of Burns is the one given in Johnson's Museum, which passed through the hands of Burns; but the song itself, in some form or other, was known long before Burns.\n\nAlso:\n\nThe rye certainly refers to the growing crop, not a district.\n\nAlso:\n\nOne can imagine also that, going with a fair companion through a rye-field, the temptation might, to many youthful minds, be strong to take a kiss from their sweetheart; but one can scarcely believe such a thing occurring to anyone in wading through a rivulet.\n\nThe protagonist, \"Jenny\", is not further identified, but there has been reference to a \"Jenny from Dalry\" and a longstanding legend in the Drakemyre suburb of the town of Dalry, North Ayrshire, holds that \"comin thro' the rye\" describes crossing a ford through the Rye Water at Drakemyre to the north of the town, downstream from Ryefield House and not far from the confluence of the Rye with the River Garnock.\n\nWhen this story appeared in the Glasgow Herald in 1867, it was soon disputed with the assertion that everyone understood the rye to be a field of rye, wet with dew, which also fits better with other stanzas that substitute \"wheat\" and \"grain\" for \"rye\". An alternative suggestion is that \"the rye\" was a long narrow cobblestone paved lane, prone to puddles of water.\n\nIt is perhaps worthy of note that the Rye Water ford at Drakemyre is just 23 miles (37km) from the Brig O' Doon, made famous in the Tam O' Shanter poem, also written by Robert Burns.\n\nIt seems probable that the original song referenced the crop, Rye, and possible that Burns had in mind the river when he revised the song.\n\nPerhaps the protagonists could agree that Burns used a fair amount of poetic licence when writing his version of this, much older song, whose full meaning may never be known.\n\nThe title of the novel The Catcher In The Rye (1951) by J. D. Salinger comes from the poem's name. Holden Caulfield, the protagonist, misinterprets a part of this poem to mean \"if a body catch a body\" rather than \"if a body meet a body.\" He keeps picturing children playing in a field of rye near the edge of a cliff, and him catching them when they start to fall off.\n\nRelated Scottish Country Dances\n\nComing Through The Rye\n\nAll The Lads They Smile At Me\n\nComing Through The Rye Lyrics By Robert Burns\n\nComing Through The Rye Lyrics, Most Usually Sung (Ilka Lassie)\n\nEven the \"cleaner\" version of the Burns lyrics (above) is quite bawdy, and it is this one, or an \"anglicized\" version of it, that is most commonly covered.
