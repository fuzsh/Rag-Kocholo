Working as songwriter and producer with Petite Noir, Denai Moore and Damon Albarn over the last five years it became natural to involve his own voice in his music. When we started receiving demos from Clem, featuring hazy beach boys harmonies we knew his music was daring to evolve.\n\nSongs of Vienna, out October 15, is an album of the year. It feels like the world at the moment... saturated with history and daring to leap into the future for answers. These songs work as intimate pop records - a young man moving to London and reflecting on his home town. Or treaties on a symbolic Vienna: colonialism, social democracy and the climate disaster. But the album is refreshing, full of life and sonically unmatched: with live instrumentation and choirs brewed into his electronic compositions, Clemens has made a brave leap forward.

Keszler’s instrumental performances are framed by panoramic recordings of New York City and the Odyssey Cave. Expansive music that takes on forms difficult to describe outside of the loss and wonderment that defines our age → more\n\n30.04.21\n\nProud to announce KUČKA’s debut album is out today.
