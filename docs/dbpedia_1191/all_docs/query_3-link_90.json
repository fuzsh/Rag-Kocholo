She suggests she might have a secret admirer, or even admirers.\n\nGin a body meet a body\n\nComin through the rye\n\nGin a body kiss a body\n\nNeed a body cry?\n\nChorus\n\nIlka lassie has her laddie\n\nNane, they say, hae I\n\nYet aa the lads they smile at me\n\nWhen comin through the rye\n\nGin a body meet a body\n\nComin through the toon,\n\nGin a body greet a body\n\nNeed a body froon?\n\nAmang the train there is a swain\n\nI dearly loe masel\n\nBut what's his name an where's his hame\n\nI dinna care to tell\n\nGin a body meet a body\n\nComin frae the well\n\nGin a body kiss a body\n\nNeed a body tell?\n\nBlialam says, 'This version of the classic Burns song was prepared for the first ever Music School Burns Supper. There is a visual element to the live performance that you'll just have to imagine.\n\n'The recording features Goldilocks and the Three Bears with Whistlin' Swanee Ellis.'"
