        "text": "Some people may say that country music is dead.\n\nAt first listen, Rye Davis' most recent release, Cut to Tape, will prove that to be untrue with distinguishing vocals and powerful lyrics we can all relate to. The Kentucky native released his first album, A Story to Tell, in 2018 with great success. That album included such hits as \"She'd Know\" and \"They All Know My Name.\" Davis, along with wife, creative partner and manager, Brandy co-wrote all of the songs on both the previous album and the new EP. Taylor Kropp, a long-time friend, plays a major role in this project as both producer and musician, on electric guitar. They are joined by Scott Neubert on pedal steel guitar. The new EP, Cut to Tape, is composed of five songs and takes off with \"If You Wanna Rock and Roll,\" which embodies a high-speed honky-tonk feel with powerful dueling electric and steel guitars. Davis portrays to us the story of life on the road with its trials and tribulations that all musicians face in the name of keeping music alive and well. This song is the most autobiographical on the EP as the lyrics state \"out here on the highway is the only life I know, and you ain't got time for nothing else if you wanna rock and roll.\"\n\nDavis has an impressive talent for storytelling in his songs that are so true to his life and experiences, as he plays in the area of 150-175 shows per year and has for the past three years. As a full time musician, Rye has played mostly regional shows in order to maintain his farm life as much as he possibly can, with the exception of the past year where he has branched out and has received an abundance of support from his fans, old and new.\n\nThis next song, \"Save you a Seat,\" is my favorite on this EP with its hard-hitting sentiments and stern vocals. Davis talks about hypocrisy and how we are constantly judged by others for our actions, especially in society today. Immediately, he grabs our attention with the bold lyrics, \"I'm tired of you acting like you're better than me, with your preaching and your teaching, and your hypocrisy.\"\n\nThe most intense song of the lot, \"King Me,\" was released as a single to promote the EP. This song carries a moderate tempo and contains a Bluegrass/90's country feel, reminiscent to the dusty boards of a small dancefloor. This song was written about Brandy's late grandfather, Charles Wills, and grasps the truths and hardships of aging parents, dementia, Alzheimer's, and growing old, told to us through a game of checkers.\n\nIn “Everyday America,” the fourth song on the EP, Rye Davis delivers a ballad or anthem of sorts, which is giving glory to those who drive the Nation and who are all too often overlooked for their hard work. With honorable mention, as the last song on the album, \"Stone to Stone\" gives the idea of enduring love enveloped in a steadfast relationship, from buying a wedding ring to buying a headstone. The humble harmony and charming lyrics \"her left hand and his last name, and a promise made of stone\" leave you reflecting on life as a married couple growing old together and the loss we inevitably face."
