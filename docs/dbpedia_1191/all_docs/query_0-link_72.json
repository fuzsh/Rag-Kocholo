Sharp: One Hundred English Folksongs Ralph Vaughan Williams, A.L. LLoyd: The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs Mike Yates: Travellerâs Joy\n\nJohn Barleycorn is the personification of barley, and the song describes the process used to plant, harvest and brew the barley for beer. It was recorded in many versions by lots of musicians.\n\nCecil Sharp collected John Barleycorn on 31 August 1909 from ‘Shepherd’ Hayden of Bampton, Oxfordshire [VWML CJS2/9/2124] . Ralph Vaughan Williams and A.L. Lloyd included this version in their 1959 book The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs.\n\nA.L. Lloyd sang John Barleycorn in 1956, accompanied by Alf Edwards on English concertina, on English Drinking Songs. This recording was also included in 1994 on his Fellside anthology CD Classic A.L. Lloyd. Lloydâs first three verses and the second half of his fourth verse are nearly identical to Haydenâs but verses 5-6 are completely different. Lloyd noted on the latter album:\n\nThe song is related to the ancient idea of the Corn King. Perhaps too neatly so, hence the suspicion that it may not be a genuine piece of primitive folklore. It is old (it was already in print c.1635) and has been passed on by generations of country singers. The tune is a variant of Dives and Lazarus.\n\nA group of boggins at the Hood Game in Haxey, Lincolnshire, sang John Barleycorn in a 1950s recording made by Peter Kennedy and SÃ©amus Ennis. A shortened version was included on the anthology Songs of Christmas / Ceremony (The Folk Songs of Britain Volume 9; Caedmon 1961; Topic 1970).\n\nO.J. Abbott from Hull, Quebec, sang The Barley Grain for Me in a 1957 field recording made by Edith Fowke that was included in 1961 on his Folkways album Irish and British Songs From the Ottawa Valley. Edith Fowke noted:\n\nThe story of the death and rebirth of John Barleycorn has a long and interesting history. The first known printed version was as a broadside in 1620 which was described as “a pleasant new ballad about the murther of John Barleycorn”. The great seventeenth-century diarist. Samuel Pepys, had a copy of it which he reckoned was old then. In 1786 Robert Burns produced a poem which he noted “is partly composed on the plan of an old song known by the same name”. It has been suggested that the story had its origin in ancient vegetation rituals which originally involved human sacrifice to ensure the resurrection of the crops. However, most of the ballads are simply detailed accounts of the planting, reaping, threshing, milling, and brewing of the barley grain.\n\nThe ballad has been collected fairly frequently in Britain, but very rarely in North America. Mr. Abbott learned it from Owen McCann who worked with him on Skeadâs farm along the Ottawa River some sixty years ago. I have been unable to trace the place named in the first line: most versions speak of “three farmers in the north” or “three kings from the west”. This version seems to have come from Ireland rather than England. It is fairly similar to The Barley Corn given in Irish Street Ballads, page [89].\n\nMike Waterson sang John Barleycorn on the Watersonsâ 1965 LP Frost and Fire. He sang ‘Shepherd’ Haydenâs version from The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs with verbs changed from past tense to present perfect. Mike Watersonâs recording was also published on the Topic Sampler No. 6, A Collection of Ballads & Broadsides and in 2004 on the Watersonsâ 4 CD anthology Mighty River of Song. A.L. Lloyd noted on Mikeâs original recording:\n\nSometimes called The Passion of the Corn. Itâs such an unusually coherent figuration of the old myth of the Corn-king cut down and rising again, that the sceptical incline to think it may be an invention or refurbishing carried out by some educated antiquarian. If so, he did his work long ago and successfully, for the ballad was already in print in the early years of the seventeenth century, and it has been widespread among folk singers in many parts of the English and Scottish countryside. Cecil Sharp obtained this version from Shepherd Hayden of Bampton, Oxfordshire [on 31 August 1909, VWML CJS2/9/2124] .\n\nFred Jordan sang John Barleycorn in a recording made by Bill Leader and Mike Yates in a private room in The Bay Malton Hotel, Oldfield Brow, Altringham, Cheshire, in 1966. It was included in the same year on his Topic album Songs of a Shropshire Farm Worker and in 1998 on the Topic anthology They Ordered Their Pints of Beer and Bottles of Sherry (The Voice of the People Series Volume 13). Another recording made by Mike Yates in 1965 was included in 2003 on his Veteran anthology A Shropshire Lad. The Topic albumâs notes commented:\n\nIn ancient Egypt, harvesters performed a ceremony in which they begged forgiveness of the corn before they reaped it. Indeed everywhere men have seen a divine power in corn, and sometimes cutting it has seemed close to the killing of the Gods. The Passion of the Corn is depicted with astonishing clarity and coherence in the old John Barleycorn song, which has already found its way into print in the early years of the seventeenth century. Fred Jordan learnt it from his father.\n\nMartin Carthy sang John Barleycorn in 1966 on Songs From ABC Televisionâs “Hallelujah” and, accompanied by Dave Swarbrick, on their 1967 LP Byker Hill. This version is quite similar to Mike Watersonâs, see the lyrics below. It was reissued on the compilation album This Is... Martin Carthy. Another version is on his 1974 album Sweet Wivelsfield. A live recording from Memphis Folk Club, Leeds dating from 1973 can be found on The Carthy Chronicles. He also sang it live in studio in July 2006 for the DVD Guitar Maestros. Martin Carthy noted on his original album:\n\nA.L. Lloyd in The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs points out that if John Barleycorn is a folklore survival of the ancient myth of the death and resurrection of the Corn God, it is remarkable if only for its coherence, but, he says, it could be the work of some more recent writer which was somehow absorbed into the tradition. It is certainly powerful enough to be the former but also quaint enough (not to use the word in its pejorative sense) to be the latter. It might be interesting to speculate further of the three men coming from the West (sunset—the place of death?) bringing with them the promise of live (for no matter what they do they succeed only in giving John Barleycorn new life) and the Three Wise Men coming from the East (sunrise—the place of life?) to see Jesus, bringing as gifts the promise of death. It is found all over the British Isles; this version was taken down in Bampton, Oxfordshire, by Cecil Sharp.\n\nand in the Carthy Chronicles:\n\nForget the academic stuff about death and rebirth, fertility symbols and corn gods! The reason that this is one of the best known and most popular of all ballads—and one which has crossed a great many musical thresholds—is that itâs actually about that other activity which most commonly accompanies the singing of traditional songs—drinking!\n\nDave and Toni Arthur sang The Barley Grain for Me in 1967 on their Transatlantic album Morning Stands on Tiptoe. They noted:\n\nThe earliest known copy of this song is in the Pepysian Collection printed in Blackletter by Henry Gosson (1607-1641). In the Roxburghe Collection it is entitled A Pleasant New Ballad to Sing Both Even and Morne, of the Bloody Murther of Sir John Barleycorne. Since then it has been widely published and H. Such printed a version Sir John Barleycorn. It has been collected many times in England over the last 70 years.Theories have been put forward that the song is a pagan survival of vegetarian rituals dealing with the death and resurrection of the corn god.The version sung here was collected from O.J. Abbott in the Ottawa River Valley and appears to be of Irish origin rather than English. A similar song is The Barley Corn in Irish Street Ballads, page 176.\n\nThe Young Tradition sang John Barleycorn in 1968 on their last LP, Galleries. Their version was collected by Cecil Sharp from John Stafford of Bishops Sutton on 27 August 1906 and printed in Folk Songs From Somerset 4 (1908) [VWML CJS2/10/1068, RoudFS/S150195] . This track was included in 1994 on the Ronco anthology The British Folk Collection as the first Young Tradition track reissued on CD. They also sang it on 17 November 1968 at their concert at Oberlin College, Ohio, that was published in 2013 on their Fledgâling CD Oberlin 1968. Heather Wood noted on the original album:\n\nFrom the Cecil Sharp collection. One of the many songs which we picked up by a process of osmosis.\n\nBob Hart sang John Barleycorn at home in Snape, Suffolk, on 8 July 1969 to Rod and Danny Stradling. They included this in 2007 on his Musical Traditions anthology A Broadside. A 1972 Bob Hart home recording made by Tony Engle was published in 1973 on his Topic album Songs From Suffolk. A.L. Lloyd noted:\n\nThe Passion of the Corn was a sacred drama in the minds of ancient Egyptians, and since remote times agricultural peoples have begged the pardon of the grain before they cut it. Our Barleycorn song has become a semi-comic affair, yet it still keeps some of its old ceremonial aura. The song was already in print by 1620, and it has stayed green ever since.\n\nTraffic recorded John Barleycorn as the title track of their 1970 album John Barleycorn Must Die with verses nearly identical to Mike Watersonâs. In fact, Steve Winwood learnt the song from the Watersons. This track was also included in 1975 on the famous anthology Electric Muse: The Story of Folk into Rock. This video shows Steve Winwood singing John Barleycorn in 2012 or earlier:\n\nThe Broadside sang John Barleycorn on their 1971 album of Lincolnshire folk songs, The Gipsyâs Wedding Day. They noted:\n\nOne of the songs traditionally sung at Haxey in connection with the famous Hood Game, held every 6th January. This ancient and widespread ballad in celebration of barley juice is very suitable to that occasion.\n\nThe Songwainers sang John Barleycorn in 1971 on their eponymous Argo album The Songwainers. They also sang it in June 1976 at the festival Eurofolk â76 in Ingelheim, Germany. They noted:\n\nSurely one of the most popular songs of the Folk Music ‘revival’ both with singer and listener. This again is our own arrangement, taken from Fred Jordanâs text and set to a popular C19 harvest hymn-tune, Wir pflÃ¼gen und strÃ¤uen, attributed to [Johann Abraham Peter] Schulz (1747-1800).\n\nDerek and Dorothy Elliott sang John Barleycorn in 1972 on their eponymous Leader album, Derek & Dorothy Elliott.\n\nSteeleye Spanâs version of John Barleycorn on their 1972 album Below the Salt is again similar in the beginning to the previous versions but differs in the last verse. They recorded John Barleycorn a second time in 2002 for their CD Present. A live recording from The Forum, London on 2 September 1995 was released on their double CD The Journey. Their singer Maddy Prior recorded John Barleycorn in 2003 for her solo album Lionhearts; this track can also be found on her anthology Collections: A Very Best of 1995 to 2005. Their first recordingâs sleeve notes commented:\n\nAdam, Cain and Abel staggered manfully across the field carrying a plough, a harrow and a grain of wheat … John Barleycorn—mysterious intimations from above told them to dig three deep furrows and bury him—this done they returned home and started to draw up plans for the first ale house.\n\nVulcanâs Hammer sang John Barleycorn to Fred Jordanâs tune on their 1973 album True Hearts and Sound Bottoms. A live recording at Stone Church in 1975 was included in the same year on their album The Two Magicians.\n\nErnest Austin from Great Bentley, Essex, sang John Barleycorn in a recording made by Tony Engle in November 1973. It was published in 1974 on the Topic album Flash Company, and in 2010 on the Veteran anthology of traditional singers from Essex, The Fox & the Hare. John Howson noted on the song:\n\nThis complete version of the classic country song tells the story of the life-cycle of the barley grain used in brewing beer. One of the earliest known versions was a black letter broadside printed by Henry Gosson (1607-41) which can be found in the Pepys Collection. It became popular with eighteenth century printers and later on sequels such as Hey, John Barleycorn and Little John Barleycorn appeared. The song became popular all over rural England and not surprisingly was found throughout East Anglia.\n\nI recorded two other fine versions in Suffolk from Tom Smith of Thorpe Morieux (Songs Sung in Suffolk) [and] Roy Last of Mendlesham Green (Who Owns the Game?), and early collectors also found the song prevalent in Essex. In 1904 Ralph Vaughan Williams collected it from a Mr Peacock at Ingrave, and in 1911 Clive Carey noted it down from both George Wright and Harry Smith in Thaxted. Then in the early 1960s Sam Steele recorded Billy Rash of West Wratting on the Cambridgeshire/Essex border singing the song and the excellent Essex singer Reg Bacon of Radwinter, whose version can be heard on Heel & Toe.\n\nBob Blake sang John Barleycorn in a recording made by Mike Yates at Broadbridge Heath, Sussex in 1974 that was included in 1987 on the Veteran Tapes cassette of traditional singing in Sussex, Ripest Apples (VT107), and in 2001 on the Veteran CD anthology of “traditional folk music from rural England”, Down in the Fields.\n\nTom Smith of Thorpe Morieux (b. 1918) learned John Barleycorn from his father Bert Smith and sang it in a John Howson recording on the Veteran Tapes cassette Songs Sung in Suffolk Vol 2 (VT102, published in 1987-89), on the 2000 Veteran CD Songs Sung in Suffolk, and on the CD accompanying The Folk Handbook (2007).\n\nAustin Flanagan sang The Barley Grain at home in Luogh, Doolin, Co. Clare, in August 1974. This recording made by Jim Carroll and Pat Mackenzie was included in 1998 on the Topic anthology Troubles They Are But Few (The Voice of the People Series Volume 14).\n\nBarry Skinner sang John Barleycorn in 1974 on the Argo album The World of the Countryside.\n\nRoy Bailey learned John Barleycorn from The Constant Lovers, edited by Frank Purslow, and sang it in 1976 on his album New Bell Wake.\n\nThe John Renbourn Group sang John Barleycorn in 1977 on their Transatlantic album A Maid in Bedlam.\n\nLouis Killen sang John Barleycorn in Winter 1977 at the Eldron Fennig Museum of American Ephemera; this recording was published in the following year on his album Old Songs, Old Friends.\n\nThe McCalmans sang John Barleycorn at Forrest Hill Bar (Sandy Bellâs) or Pan Audio Studios in Edinburgh for the 1977 album Sandy Bellâs Ceilidh. It was later reissued by Greentrax on cassette and CD.\n\nBill Price sang John Barleycorn in 1978 on his Autogram album I Sing As I Please. He noted:\n\nAn Irish version of the John Barleycorn saga. I canât remember where I first learned it but probably in Canada. It has changed a lot over the years.\n\nFairport Convention sang John Barleycorn, with lyrics quite similar to Mike Watersonâs, on their 1978 album Tipplers Tales (where else?). There are also several live recordings, e.g. on Forever Young (Cropredy 1982), The Boot (Cropredy 1983), and The Cropredy Box (Cropredy 1997).\n\nLike The Young Tradition, Tickawinda sang John Staffordâs version of John Barleycorn. They recorded it for their 1979 album Rosemary Lane.\n\nChris Foster sang Jack Barleycorn on the 1980 anthology Folk-al-Pint, which was produced by John Goodluck, presenter of the same-named weekly Radio Orwell programme. He also sang it on his 2003 Tradition Bearers CD Traces where he noted:\n\nI was given this song by Jumbo Brightwell from Suffolk. He was a superb traditional singer and a lovely man.\n\nAndy Turner first learned John Barleycorn from Steeleye Spanâs album. He and Ian Giles sang the classic Shepherd Hayden version collected by Cecil Sharp, though, in 1983 on Magpie Laneâs first album, The Oxford Ramble, and he sang it as the 10 June 2016 entry of his project A Folk Song a Week. This video shows Andy and Ian at the very first Magpie Lane gig at Holywell Music Room in May 1993:\n\nAndy Turner also sang a version of John Barleycorn collected in the 1970s by Gwilym Davies on Magpie Laneâs 2000 CD A Taste of Ale. Andy Turner and Chris Wood recorded another version on a demo tape in ca. 1985 which he used as the 22 October 2012 entry of his project A Folk Song a Week. This version was collected from Bert Edwards of Little Stretton, Shropshire, by Peter Kennedy and printed in the latterâs book Folksongs of Britain and Ireland, and is similar to Fred Jordanâs version.\n\nPete Morton sang John Barleycorn with ‘Shepherd’ Haydenâs words in 1990 at the Folk Festival Sidmouth, in 1992 on his Harbourtown album Mad World Blues, and in 1998 on his Harbourtown album Trespass. He noted on the last album:\n\nIâve loved this song since I first heard it in a pub in Leicester many moons ago. Turned me on to traditional folk and re-incarnation.\n\nBarry Dransfield sang John Barleycorn in 1994 on his Rhiannon CD Be Your Own Man. This track was also included in 2007 on the anthology Old Wine New Skins. He noted on his album:\n\nFirst heard this by Stefan Sobell when we played together in the Sixties. He makes great instruments now but he was a very good performer then. Also heard this over the years from Steve Winwood and The Watersons. Drink up, itâs your round!\n\nRobin Laing sang Robert Burnsâ John Barleycorn in 1997 on his Greentrax CD The Angelsâ Share. He noted:\n\nThis is Burnsâ version of a very old traditional song. I found the tune in a whisky glass one pleasant April evening.\n\nSingle malt whisky is made from malted barley. The magical nature of its treatment is evoked by this personification of barley into John Barleycorn.\n\nCoope, Boyes & Simpson sang John Barleycorn on their 1998 CD Hindsight. They noted:\n\nFor those of you who have not witnessed the ritual event of the Haxey Hood (6 January each year in Haxey village) this involves a protracted game the object of which is to transfer a cylindrical leather Hood from the middle of a muddy field to one of four local pubs—itâs a bit like a cross between Rugby and trench warfare. Before and after the event, participants traditionally sing a series of songs, one of which is John Barleycorn. We particularly like the words of this version.\n\nDavy Steele sang John Barleycorn: A Ballad in 1998 on the Linn anthology The Complete Songs of Robert Burns Volume 5. In a BBC page on Burnsâ poem John Barleycorn, Pauline Mackay commented:\n\nJohn Barleycorn is one of Burnsâs earliest productions. However, it did not appear in print until the Edinburgh edition of Poems Chiefly in the Scots Dialect (1787). The poet himself noted that the song was “partly composed on the plan of an old song known by the same name”.\n\nThis folk allegory depicts the personification, death and transubstantiation of John Barleycorn from plant to whisky, referred to here as “his very heartâs blood”.\n\nThe New Scorpion Band sang John Barleycorn in 1999 on their first CD, Folk Songs and Tunes From the British Isles. They noted:\n\nAlthough most of us no longer work on the land, the power of this extraordinary and ancient song remains undiminished. The song was first printed as a blackletter ballad in the reign of James II, but may well be much older. The spirit of the grain personified. Our version was collected by Cecil Sharp from John Stafford of Bishops Sutton in Somerset [VWML CJS2/10/1068] .\n\nDuncan Williamson of Ladybank, Fife, sang John Barleycorn to Mike Yates in 2001. This version was included in 2002 on Yatesâ anthology Travellersâ Tales Volume 2 and in Yatesâ EFDSS book of songs of English and Scottish Travellers and Gypsies, Travellerâs Joy. A live recording from the Fife Traditional Singing Festival, Collessie, Fife in May 2006 was included a year later on Festival anthology Some Rants oâ Fun (Old Songs & Bothy Ballads Volume 3). Mike Yates noted in the EFDSS book:\n\nListening to Duncanâs sprightly version of this song, it is easy to see why many of the early folklorists saw John Barleycorn as a representation of the death and resurrection of the old corn god. Modern thinking has been summarized by the historian Stephen Wilson: “We may abandon the corn spirit but not the ethic of fecundity which it stood for.” See The Magical Universe: Everyday Ritual and Magic in Pre-modern Europe (London: Hambledon and London, 2000).\n\nA black-letter broadside version, printed by Henry Gosson (1607-41), can be found in the Pepys Collection, and several eighteenth-century broadside versions exist. English Edwardian collectors noted many versions (Cecil Sharp collected sixteen), although it appears to have been less well known in Scotland. Robert Burns knew a fragment of the song, which he enlarged into a poem, and Gavin Greig collected a single text (without tune) which is basically Burnsâs poem.\n\nFinest Kind sang John Barleycorn on their 2003 album Silks & Spices. They noted:\n\nA widely sung epic tale of mutilation, death and resurrection, which happily doubles as a recipe for mankindâs greatest thirst quencher. The same version of this song was recorded in 1970 by Traffic on an album called John Barleycorn Must Die, and was a considerable hit in the UK. Ian [Robb] confesses to some minor meddling with the tune; the originally transcribed version can be found in Ralph Vaughan Williams and A.L. Lloydâs The Penguin Book of English Folk Songs.\n\nThe Tabbush Sisters sang John Barleycorn on their 2003 album This Close….\n\nJim Causley sang John Barleycorn in 2005 on his WildGoose CD Fruits of the Earth. He noted:\n\nI first discovered this gorgeous version of the song on a dreadful CD of songs collected in Somerset by Cecil Sharp and performed by a classical male quartet featuring a counter tenor—lovely! Great songs though and this one was sung to Sharp in August 1906 by a Mr John Stafford of Bishops Sutton in the Mendip Hills [VWML CJS2/10/1068] . It has a big place in my heart and the last verse never fails to give me goosies, to quote Norma Waterson!\n\nTim Radford sang John Barleycorn on his 2005 CD Home From Home. He noted:\n\nAs a child, whenever we went on a journey in the car or on a train in the South of England we would came across huge signs in fields announcing “You are now entering the Strong Country” this being the local Strongs Brewery of Romsey; one of their beers was “Barleycorn” and this was my first encounter with the word, and I think about that every time I hear this song. I also love the way the song describes the production of beer as the life and death of a man.\n\nThis song was collected throughout Hampshire and Dorset by the Hammonds and Gardiner and is even common in North America. My text is from Mr. Miller of Wootton Fitzpaine, Dorset, via Frank Purslowâs book The Constant Lovers, but my tune is probably influenced by a Roy Bailey version.\n\nChris Wood sang John Barleycorn, “after the singing of Martin Carthy”, in 2005 on his CD The Lark Descending. He noted\n\nIt was playing this song with Martin Carthy that finally lifted the scales from my eyes. “An English man of power” is how Martin introduced Sir John and night after night each performance drew me deeper into the passion of the corn.\n\nTim van Eyken sang Barleycorn “after Fred Jordan” in 2006 on his Topic CD Stiffs Lovers Holymen Thieves. This track was also included in 2009 on Topicâs 70th Anniversary anthology, Three Score and Ten.\n\nRon Taylor and Jeff Gillett sang John Barleycorn in 2006 on their WildGoose CD Both Shine as One. They noted:\n\nProbably the most violent song on the album, but itâs all metaphorical (so thatâs all right!) Words as sung by ‘Shepherd’ Hayden of Bampton in Oxfordshire, collected by Cecil Sharp in 1909; tune learned by Ron from Dave Swarbrick in Sidmouth, 1969 (although it may have changed slightly since!)\n\nPaul Weller and Martin and Eliza Carthy sang John Barleycorn in 2007 on The Imagined Villageâs eponymous first CD, The Imagined Village.\n\nThe Lark Rise Band recorded John Barleycorn in 2008 for their album Lark Rise Revisited.\n\nTim Laycock sang John Barleycorn on his 2010 CD of folk songs and tunes from Dorset, Sea Strands. He noted:\n\nAnother song from the repertoire of William Miller of Wootton Fitzpaine, who the Hammond brothers visited in April 1906, braving the hills of West Dorset on their bicycles. They also collected a version of John Appleby from Farmer Miller, and Henry Hammond wrote to his friend and fellow collector George Gardiner as follows: “I am going to get John Appleby on Monday God willing; I am not bursting my kidneys but I nearly burst myself altogether by falling off my bike going down a steep hill on which I encountered a big stone which did ‘my ruin prove’. I have wrenched my left shoulder, and am just off to see Cooper medicus of Lyme Regis. My brother R is riding to Bridgwater today.”\n\nJon Boden sang John Barleycorn as the 13 April 2011 entry of his project A Folk Song a Day. He noted in his blog:\n\nAnother ‘big song’ that Iâve only just got around to learning. There are so many good versions around, to choose from, but this is basically Carthyâs version I think.\n\nMark T sang John Barleycorn in 2011 on his CD Folk Songs & Ballads.\n\nMary Humphreys and Anahata sang John Barleycorn on their 2012 album A Bakerâs Dozen. Mary Humphreys noted:\n\nThe tune only was collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams from cement-worker Llewellyn Mallion of Fen Ditton in 1906 [VWML RVW2/3/195] . It was probably sung to him in the now defunct pub The Harvest Home at Green End, next door to where Mr Mallion lived. His two brothers Bill and Harry both were farm workers and supplied songs to Vaughan Williams on other occasions. He would have been familiar with the seasonal round of the ploughboyâs year, and there is no denying he would have been partial to a drop of the old John Barleycorn served next door. The text is one compiled from many sources and is not specific to Cambridgeshire.\n\nArthur Watson sang John Barleycorn in 2012 on Shepheard, Spiers & Watsonâs Springthyme album Over the Hills. They noted:\n\nThe character of John Barleycorn in the song represents the spirit of the harvest, and of the alcohol made from it—whisky and beer. In the song, John Barleycorn suffers from the ploughing of the ground, the reaping of the crop, the milling of the grain and the conversion of the grain into alcohol.

They noted:\n\nThis clever song is a brilliant take on the murder ballad tradition, replacing the figure of the spurned and murdered lover with the mythical figure of John Barleycorn. John is brutally murdered and reborn as delicious beer. It has a fiendish melody: performed fast it is a real challenge to sing! We wanted to bring the great energy and tempo of this track to the project. Itâs also a very English version of a myth of death and rebirth, Winter and Summer which we share with many others.\n\nOld Blind Dogs sang John Barleycorn on their 2021 album Knucklehead Circus.\n\nFilkinâs Ensemble performed John Barleycorn on their 2023 EP Live From ‘The Folk’.\n\nLyrics\n\n‘Shepherd’ Hayden sings John Barleycorn\n\nThere were three men come out of the west\n\nTheir fortunes for to try,\n\nAnd these three men made a solemn vow,\n\nJohn Barleycorn should die.\n\nThey ploughed, they sowed, they harrowed him in,\n\nThrowed clods on his head.\n\nAnd these three men made a solemn vow,\n\nJohn Barleycorn was dead.\n\nThen they let him lie for a very long time\n\nTill the rain from heaven did fall,\n\nThen little Sir John sprung up his head\n\nAnd soon amazed them all.\n\nThey let him stand till midsummer day\n\nTill he looked both pale and wan.\n\nAnd little Sir John he growed a long beard\n\nAnd so become a man.\n\nThey hired men with the scythes so sharp\n\nTo cut him off at the knee.\n\nThey rolled him and tied him by the waist,\n\nAnd served him most barbarously.\n\nThey hired men with the sharp pitchforks\n\nWho pricked him to the heart.\n\nAnd the loader he served him worse than that\n\nFor he bound him to the cart.\n\nThey wheeled him round and round the field\n\nTill they came unto a barn\n\nAnd there they made a solemn mow\n\nOf poor John Barleycorn.\n\nThey hired men with the crab-tree sticks\n\nTo cut him skin from bone,\n\nAnd the miller, he served him worse than that\n\nFor he ground him between two stones.\n\nHereâs little Sir John in a nut-brown bowl\n\nAnd brandy in a glass\n\nAnd little Sir John in the nut-brown bowl\n\nProved the stronger man at last.\n\nAnd the huntsman, he canât hunt the fox\n\nNor so loudly to blow his horn,\n\nAnd the tinker, he canât mend kettles nor pots\n\nWithout a little of Barleycorn.\n\nA.L.

Abbott sings The Barley Grain for Me\n\nOh three men went to Deroughata\n\nTo sell three loads of rye;\n\nThey shouted up and they shouted down\n\nThe barley grain should die.\n\nChorus (after each verse):\n\nTirey igery ary ann, tirey igery ee,\n\nTirey igery ary ann, the barley grain for me.\n\nThen the farmer came with a big plough,\n\nHe ploughed me under the sod,\n\nThe winter it being over\n\nAnd the summer coming on\n\nSure the barley grain shot forth\n\nHis head with a beard like any man.\n\nThen the reaper came with a sharp hook,\n\nHe made me no reply;\n\nHe caught me by the whiskers and\n\nHe cut me above the thigh.\n\nThen the binder came with her neat thumb;\n\nShe bound me all around,\n\nAnd then they hired a handyman\n\nTo stand me on the ground.\n\nThen the pitcher came with a steel fork;\n\nHe pierced it through me heart,\n\nAnd like a rogue or a highwayman\n\nThey bound me on the cart.\n\nThen they took me to the barn and\n\nSpread me out on the floor;\n\nThey left me there for a space of time,\n\nAnd my beard grewâ through the door.\n\nThen the thresher came with a big flail;\n\nHe swore heâd break my bones,\n\nBut the miller he used me worse,\n\nHe ground me between two stones.\n\nThen they took me out of that and\n\nThey threw me into a well;\n\nThey left me there for a space of time,\n\nAnd me belly began to swell.\n\nThen they sold me to the brewer\n\nAnd he brewed me on the pan,\n\nBut when I got into the jug\n\nI was the strongest man.\n\nThen they drank me in the kitchen and\n\nThey drank me in the hall,\n\nBut the drunkard he used me worse,\n\nHe lashed me against the wall.\n\nMike Waterson sings John Barleycorn\n\nThere were three men come out of the west\n\nTheir fortunes for to try,\n\nAnd these three men made a solemn

cheerful Spring came kindly on,\n\nAnd showârs began to fall;\n\nJohn Barleycorn got up again,\n\nAnd sore surprisâd them all.\n\nThe sultry suns of Summer came,\n\nAnd he grew thick and strong,\n\nHis heed weel armâd wiâ pointed spears,\n\nThat no one should him wrong.\n\nThe sober Autumn enterâd mild,\n\nWhen he grew wan and pale;\n\nHis bending joints and drooping head\n\nShowâd he began to fail.\n\nHis colour sickenâd more and more,\n\nHe faded into age;\n\nAnd then his enemies began\n\nTo show their deadly rage.\n\nTheyâve taen a weapon, long and sharp,\n\nAnd cut him by the knee;\n\nThey tyâd him fast upon a cart,\n\nLike a rogue for forgerie.\n\nThey laid him down upon his back,\n\nAnd cudgellâd him full sore;\n\nThey hung him up before the storm,\n\nAnd turnd him oâer and oâer.\n\nThey filled up a darksome pit\n\nWith water to the brim,\n\nThey heaved in John Barleycorn,\n\nThere let him sink or swim.\n\nThey laid him out upon the floor,\n\nTo work him farther woe,\n\nAnd still, as signs of life appearâd\n\nThey tossâd him to and fro.\n\nThey wasted, oâer a scorching flame,\n\nThe marrow of his bones;\n\nBut a Miller usâd him worst of all\n\nFor he crushâd him between two stones.\n\nAny they hae taen his very heartâs blood,\n\nAnd drank it round and round;\n\nAnd still the more and more they drank,\n\nTheir joy did more abound.\n\nJohn Barleycorn was a hero bold,\n\nOf noble enterprise,\n\nFor if you do but taste his blood,\n\nâTwill make your courage rise.\n\nâTwill make a man forget his woe;\n\nâTwill heighten all his joy:\n\nâTwill make the widowâs heart to sing,\n\nThoâ the tear were in her eye.\n\nThen let us toast John Barleycorn,\n\nEach man a glass in hand;\n\nAnd may

dead.\n\nChorus:\n\nOh-oh, oh-oh poor Barley,\n\nOh poor Barleycorn.\n\nIt would cut the heart from a dying man,\n\nTo hear John Barley groan.\n\nAnd then the spring it entered mild,\n\nAnd showers began to fall.\n\nJohn Barleycorn got up again,\n\nAnd he so surprised them all.\n\nAnd then the summer entered warm,\n\nAn he grew strong and tall.\n\nHis head well hung with pointed spears,\n\nNo one could do him wrong.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nAnd then October entered mild,\n\nAnd he grew worn and pale.\n\nHis bending head and drooping joints,\n\nShowed heâd began to fail.\n\nHis colour sickened more and more,\n\nAs he grew into age.\n\nAnd then his enemies began,\n\nTo show their deadly rage.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nThey laid him out upon the floor,\n\nTo work him further woe.\n\nAnd as the signs of life appeared,\n\nThey tossed him to and fro.\n\nThey filled up a deep and darksome pit,\n\nWith water to the brim.\n\nThey heaved and pulled John Barley,\n\nTo let him sink or swim.\n\nThey roasted oâer a scorching fire.\n\nThe marrow of his bones.\n\nBut a miller used him worst of all,\n\nFor he crushed him between two stones.\n\nAnd then they took his very heartâs blood,\n\nAnd drank it round and round.\n\nAnd as the more and more they drank,\n\nTheir joy did more abound.\n\nJohn Barleycorn is a noble man\n\nOf gentle enterprise.\n\nAnd if you do but taste his blood,\n\nWill make your courage rise.\n\nâTwill make a man forget his woes,\n\nWill tiding all of his joy.\n\nWill make the widowâs heart to sing,\n\nThough tears be in her eye.\n\nSo hereâs to dear John Barley,\n\nEach man a glass in hand.\n\nAnd may his great prosperity,\n\nNever fail in all Scotland.\n\n(Chorus)\n\nTim Radford sings John Barleycorn\n\nTwo hired men came from the north, their victory to try\n\nAnd they did make a solemn vow John Barleycorn should die.\n\nChorus (after each verse):\n\nTo me right fol dol the diddle lol the day\n\nTo me right fol the diddle dol the dey.\n\nThey ploughed the ground and harrowed him in, threw clods upon his head\n\nThen they did both rejoice and sing, John Barleycorn is dead.\n\nThere he lay all underground, till rain on him did fall\n\nThen Barleycorn sprung up again and so he done âem all.\n\nThere he stood till midsummer, till he grew pale and wan\n\nAnd Barleycorn he grew a long beard and so became a man.\n\nThey hired men with scythes so sharp to cut him off at knee\n\nAnd the women with their forks and rakes they used him bitterly.\n\nThey hired men with prongs so sharp to stab him to the heart,\n\nAnd like a thief or felon, they did bind him to a cart.\n\nThey wheeled him round and round the fields till they came to a barn\n\nAnd there they made a mow of him to keep him from all harm.\n\nThen hired men with long staffs came To beat him skin from bone,\n\nBut the miller he served him worst than that for he ground him between two stones.\n\nPut brandy in a keg, me boys, put cider in a can,\n\nBut Barleycorn in an old brown bowl will floor the strongest man.\n\nHeâll turn your gold to silver, your silver into brass,\n\nHeâll make a boy become a man, and a man become an ass.\n\nArthur Watson sings John Barleycorn\n\nThere came three men oot fae the west,\n\nThree men baith great and high;\n\nAnd they hae swore a solemn oath,\n\nThat John Barleycorn should die.\n\nChorus (after each verse):\n\nOh! Oh! John Barley,\n\nOh! John Barleycorn,\n\nIt wad break the heart o a dying man,\n\nTae hear John Barley moan.\n\nThey hae ploughed him deep intae the grund,\n\nPut sods upon his heid;\n\nAnd they hae swore a solemn oath,\n\nThat John Barleycorn wis deid.\n\nAye, an gentle spring cam kindly on,\n\nAnd showers began tae faa;\n\nJohn Baleycorn rose up again,\n\nAye, an sair surprised them aa.\n\nAye, an sultry summer soon it cam,\n\nAnd the sun it brightly shone;\n\nJohn Barleycorn grew a lang, lang beard,\n\nAye, and so became a man.\n\nThey hae taen a scythe baith land an shairp,\n\nCut him aboot the knee;\n\nAnd theyâve tied him fast upon a cairt,\n\nLike some rogue for a felony.\n\nThey hae roasted him ower the scorching fire,\n\nTill the marra ran fae his bones;\n\nAnd the miller used him worse than that,\n\nHeâs crushed him between two stones.\n\nAye, but John Barleycorn was a hero bold,\n\nAnd of noble enterprise;\n\nIf ever you do taste his blood,\n\nItâd mak your courage rise.\n\nSo let us toast John Barleycorn,\n\nEvery man wi his gless in his hand;\n\nAye, an may his great prosperity,\n\nNever fail in aa Scotland.\n\nThe Dovetail Trio sing John Barleycorn\n\nThere were three men come from the west and they were all a-dry.\n\nThey made a vow, a solemn vow, John Barleycorn should die,\n\nAh poor boy, John Barleycorn should die.\n\nThey ploughed the land, they harrowed it well, scratched cloths all over his head.\n\nThey made a vow, a solemn vow, John Barleycorn was dead,\n\nAh poor boy, John Barleycorn was dead.\n\nThey let him lay a little while âtil a shower of rain did fall,\n\nThen Barleycorn sprang up a green blade and soon surprised them all,\n\nAh poor boy, and soon surprised them all.\n\nThey let him stand âtil midsummer âtil he grew pale and sore,\n\nThen they hired men with scythe sticks in to cut him down at his knees,\n\nAh poor boy, to cut him down at his knees.\n\nThey hired men with pitch forks in to prick him to his heart.\n\nThey pitched him and they loaded him and they bound his to a cart,\n\nAh poor boy, they bound him to a cart.\n\nThey carted him up and down the field, they carted him to the farm.\n\nThatâs how they served John Barleycorn, and they swore theyâd done him no harm,\n\nAh poor boy, they swore theyâd done him no harm.\n\nThey hired men with great sticks in, to beat him out at once.\n\nSwish, swash went onto his head and the flesh flew from his bones,\n\nAh poor boy, the flesh flew from his bones.\n\nThey put him into a sack, poor boy, and tied him up with a string.\n\nBut Barleycorn untied himself and he soon got out again,\n\nAh poor boy, he soon got out again.\n\nThey put him onto a kiln, poor boy, for to roast his bones.\n\nBut now they served him the worst of all, they crushed him between two stones,\n\nAh poor boy, they crushed him between two stones.\n\nThey put him into a tub, poor boy, for to scold him there.\n\nBut Barleycorn ran out below, he soon became strong beer,\n\nAh poor boy, he soon became strong beer.\n\nPut wine into a glass, poor boy, put cider into a can,\n\nPut Barleycorn into a pint mug and heâll prove the noblest man,\n\nAh poor boy, heâll prove the noblest man."
