        "text": "Happy Friday friends! Today I am starting a new series with you that I am vv excited about…\n\nLyrics & Libations\n\nLyrics & Libations combines two of my favorite things – cocktails and music. Once a month, I will be sharing a cocktail recipe paired with song. I am hoping that L & L will provide you a simply way to decompress from the week and add a little balance to your day! The drinks and music won’t always be calming or meant to relax. Sometimes I might make you something with tequila (because, surprise I LOVE tequila) and pair it with some Kanye (because, surprise #2 I love Kanye… not as much as Kanye loves Kanye, but you get it).\n\nLet’s get started.\n\nIt’s been a long day. Everything leading up to getting to your front door has been a struggle. You get home, put on your favorite comfy slippers, dim the lights and sink into your perfectly conformed to your butt cheeks, leather chair. But before you can get to your “happy place”, you need to pour yourself the perfect Rye Whiskey Old Fashioned and put on a song that will take you away, “In a Sentimental Mood”, by Duke Ellington, featuring John Coltrane. Ellington originally composed the piece in 1935, but the most famous version was done with Coltrane in ’63. Smooth, peaceful, relaxing and just what you need: The Perfect Old Fashioned and The Perfect Song. Take it away, Duke.\n\nToday’s pairing is an ode to my husband. Pat’s birthday is on Monday and a Rye Whiskey Old Fashioned is his drink of choice. I cannot think of a better way to celebrate! While most people prefer a bourbon old fashioned, Pat is partial to rye; rye whiskey is a little spicier and rougher edged compared to bourbon’s sweet flavor. We use Bulleit Rye which is incredibly smooth and translates into a cocktail that is perfect to sip.\n\nMaking an old fashioned is quite simple. Grab your cocktail shaker, add 2 parts rye, one part water, 1/4 part simple syrup, a few good shakes of bitters, and ice; shake vigorously for 5 seconds. In a rocks glass, pour the mixture over a large ice cube and top with a cherry. Lastly, take a slice of orange peel and pinch it to release the natural flavors and oils; run the peel around the rim of the glass and add it to the drink.\n\n[one_half padding=”0 5px 0 28px”] [/one_half][one_half_last padding=”0 28px 0 5px”] [/one_half_last]\n\nTell me: What is your favorite cocktail? Are there any drinks you would like to see on Lyrics & Libations?\n\nIf you make this rye whiskey old fashioned (and listen to ‘In a Sentimental Mood’!), post a picture on social media and use the hashtag #HBNlyricsandlibations for a chance to be featured!\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Bloglovin’ | Pinterest | Twitter\n\nPrint\n\nHappy Birthday Pat and cheers to the best year yet!"
