        "text": "Addicted To LoveRobert Palmer\n\nThe models in Robert Palmer's iconic \"Addicted To Love\" video were chosen in part because they couldn't play music, so they're all playing and moving to different rhythms.\n\nDeep In The Heart Of TexasPerry Como\n\nThe seemingly inoffensive song, \"Deep In The Heart Of Texas,\" was banned by the BBC when it was released in 1942. They deemed the song too catchy, with authorities in wartime Britain concerned that factory workers would be distracted if they heard it during a shift.\n\nThere Are Too Many of UsBlur\n\nBlur's \"There Are Too Many of Us\" was inspired in part by a siege in an Australian chocolate caf√© that Damon Albarn witnessed, which resulted in the death of the gunman and two hostages.\n\nBack In The U.S.S.R.The Beatles\n\nThere was a rumor in the Soviet Union that The Beatles had secretly visited the U.S.S.R. and given a private concert for the children of top Communist party members. They believed the song \"Back In The U.S.S.R.\" was written because of the concert. Actually, some fans still believe so.\n\nTendernessGeneral Public\n\n\"Tenderness\" by General Public was partly inspired by the outbreak of AIDS, which at the time was thought to be contagious.\n\nWaterlooABBA\n\nIn Belgium, where the Battle of Waterloo took place, \"Waterloo\" by ABBA was a huge hit, #1 for five weeks.\n\nKissFact or Fiction\n\nKiss is the subject of many outlandish rumors - some of which happen to be true. See if you can spot the fakes.\n\nAlan Merrill of The ArrowsSongwriter Interviews\n\nIn her days with The Runaways, Joan Jett saw The Arrows perform \"I Love Rock And Roll,\" which Alan Merrill co-wrote - that story and much more from this glam rock pioneer."
