Already a huge success in native Russia, Timur Bekmambetov made a name for himself stateside with 2008’s action blockbuster Wanted. His unique, innovative style already makes him a visionary, but he’s not content to just direct. Bekmambetov is also just as eager to find new talent on the rise with his production company, Bazelevs. His most recent U.S. production was the contemporary thriller, Unfriended, and next month audiences will get to see the insanity that is Hardcore Henry.

Bekmambetov sat down with Modern Horrors shortly after the SXSW Film Festival premiere to talk Hardcore Henry, Unfriended, and what’s on the horizon.
