        "text": "Though he’s been busy finishing off his latest directorial job, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, Timur Bekmambetov has also found time to act as producer for other people’s films. His production company, Bazelevs, has just made its latest purchase, picking up Woogles from Chronicle writer-turned-producer Max Landis.\n\nNoted WWE fan and bouncy castle enthusiastLandis has been frighteningly productive, and Woogles is based on his original idea. The actual writing load will be handled by Nick Antosca and Ned Vizzini, who have spent most of their recent time working on MTV’s telly adaptation of Teen Wolf.\n\nVariety wasn’t able to dig up the actual plot line, though we do know that the film isn’t about an obscure-sounding sexually transmitted disease, but is actually an edgy family adventure. It’ll also employ the VFX talents of the Bazelevs CG team, which coincidentally provided some of the effects for Chronicle.\n\n\"We are very excited to bring Max, Nick, and Ned's vision to life,\" Bekmambetov says. \"Bazelevs considers itself a place for great, young talent to grow, and we look forward to working with this team.\"\n\nAntosca and Vizzini have also been working on another TV pilot and this isn’t his Vizzini’s first taste of film; he wrote the book that formed the basis for** It’s Kind Of A Funny** S****tory in 2010."
