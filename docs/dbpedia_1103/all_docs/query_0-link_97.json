        "text": "The Box Office:\n\nHardcore Henry opens in America on April 8th courtesy of STX Entertainment. The film made a buzzy debut last week during the SXSW festival, although it also played at last year’s Toronto Film Festival. The picture is the brainchild of Ilya Naishuller, who wrote, directed, and co-produced the film alongside Timur Bekmambetov. It will open head-to-head with Melissa McCarthy’s The Boss (Universal/ Comcast Corp.) and the Thomas Jane/Kate Bosworth horror title Before I Wake (Relativity).\n\nIt is one of eight movies being offered by the brand-new STX distributor in 2016. This is just their fourth release following their buzzy opening act that was The Gift last August and follows the star-studded miss The Secret in their Eyes and The Boy. By the way, and this deserves its own post, The Boy was incredibly leggy for a horror film and ended up out-earning Zoolander 2. This relatively star-less (sorry Sharlto Copley) novelty may break out, or it may be the next Shoot Em Up. But its cult status is all-but-guaranteed.\n\nThe Review:\n\nHardcore Henry delivers exactly what it promises, for better or worse. You want a 90-minute feature told entirely from the first-person point-of-view as a mute and unseen (by us) protagonist engages in a series of hyper-violent action scenarios? Yeah, that’s precisely what this Ilya Naishuller project delivers. The film is very much the living/breathing embodiment of a video game movie, bathed in the language of first-person shooting games and dedicated to providing an experience that resembles playing a video game “for real.”\n\nAs a film, it’s pretty thin, but it is an often remarkable technical exercise with just enough narrative invention to justify itself as more than a demo reel. If anything, the film has a little too much plot. But for a good 2/3 of its brief running time, it’s an exhilarating and oddly engaging bit of carnage-filled debauchery. The film refreshingly takes its time before getting to the mayhem, with nearly a full reel’s worth of story and would-be exposition.\n\nIn fact, one of the highlights comes right at the start when Henry (or really, “you’) helps his scientist wife (Haley Bennett) escape from a doomed airship via an escape pod that sends the viewer plummeting into a busy Russian city with a little vertigo involved. This segment, which introduces the damsel-in-distress (this movie is not going to win awards for gender representation) and the core villain (a colorful telepath played by Danila Kozlovsky), also introduces what turns out to be a needlessly convoluted backstory. Said backstory eventually causes the movie to collapse upon itself in the exposition-heavy third act.\n\nAfter your wife gets recaptured, the action kicks into gear, and you get a solid hour or so of non-stop action. It is no small accomplishment that this film pulls off the sensation of putting you in the proverbial driver’s seat. Each action sequence looks and feels different from the previous one. I’m partial to the extended foot chase myself, but you may prefer one of the many shoot-outs or the vehicle chase where our mute protagonist hops from car to truck to motorcycle to what-have-you slaughtering his enemies as he goes.\n\nHelping you along the way in the video game-ish “Okay, now you need to go here!” narrative is Sharlto Copley, who appears in various incarnations to offer exposition, provide something resembling character, and then get gruesomely dispatched only to reappear a short time later. Yes, there are periodic bouts of what amounts to “motion blur,” but I was impressed by what I saw, both regarding practicality and creativity. But sadly the film runs out of gas well before the end, with a protracted and seemingly never-ending exposition dump that seems to exist mostly to stretch the movie to what approaches feature-length. I have no interest in spoiling what is revealed, but the revelations don’t improve the picture movie while stopping its momentum right near the finish line.\n\nI wish the movie didn’t feel the need to pile on would-be complications. I wish the film didn’t indulge in the worst video game stereotypes in regards to toxic masculinity (almost all the women are naked, imperiled, and/or dead). Plus, you’ll miss the kind of colorful characters that pepper something like Crank (“you” are no Jason Statham). But this is more of a technical exercise and a “Can we do this?” challenge than a conventional motion picture. And it has a surprisingly great musical sequence to boot.\n\nHardcore Henry undoubtedly indulges in some of our worst impulses, since its primary conceit is that “you” are the person running around the city slaughtering nameless foes with zero moral consequence. But it is to the film’s credit that it works as a viewing experience, one that A) won’t make you motion sick and B) feels a lot more engaging than the mere act of watching someone else play a video game. I have zero desire to see a bunch of movies that look and feel like Hardcore Henry, but I am okay with one that pulls off this particular effect and does it well.\n\nHardcore Henry delivers on its specific promises. It is a true one-of-a-kind film going experience, albeit one that I hope remains somewhat “one of a kind.” The stunts are superb, the action is varied and creative, and the film pulls off its intended effect with style to spare. So yeah, if this looks like the kind of movie you’d enjoy, you probably will. All others need not apply."
