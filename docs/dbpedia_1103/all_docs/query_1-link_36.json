        "text": "Hardcore Henry, which was picked up by STX Entertainment for $10M in Toronto last year, has just gotten an April 8 release date. The action thriller, previously titled Hardcore, was shot in a disruptive first-person, in-your-face POV. The picture was one that was getting lots of attention at Toronto from the studios in what was said to be an eye-popping wild ride.\n\nIt will be in theaters during a time when a lot of college kids are just coming off of Spring Break. The 18-to-25 year- olds are the core audience on the picture so STX will be having an aggressive screening campaign and is planning high-profile events to showcase the film. One of the strategies implemented by STX is to think of the movie release schedules for its product as a 52-week-a-year business.\n\nThe picture will go up against the Universal comedy The Boss and (for the time being) Before I Wake from Relativity. It also will be in theaters a fair time after Warner Bros.’ Batman v. Superman: Dawn Of Justice which bows March 25.\n\nThe movie’s name was changed because, according to STX, the title Hardcore was unavailable for commercial use as it was used by another film (I can imagine which one).\n\n“Hardcore Henry is one of the most original, adrenaline-filled movie-going experiences to be presented in theaters in a long, long time,” said Oren Aviv, president and chief content officer for the STX Entertainment Motion Picture Group in making the announcement. “This film puts moviegoers into the story and experience in a fun and visceral new way with a first-person perspective that we really have not experienced before.”\n\nThe film was shot completely from the hero’s perspective. In the words of STX: “You remember nothing. Mainly because you’ve just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who’s got her? His name’s Akan (Danila Kozlovsky); he’s a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You’re also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Sharlto Copley.) He may be on your side, but you aren’t sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity.”\n\nThe film was produced by Timur Bekmambetov, Ilya Naishuller, Inga Vainshtein Smith, Ekaterina Kononenko and written and directed by Naishuller. The cast includes Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, Andrey Dementyev, Dasha Charusha, and Sveta Ustinova.”"
