        "text": "With the nationwide release of Hardcore Henry just a month away, another trailer for the adrenal-charged, first-person POV action flick has arrived, and it’s as feverish as the first. You can check it out below.\n\nIn the film’s first trailer, we learn that Henry, past and body destroyed, has been brought back to life by his wife. However, shortly after being restored, things get complicated. People are after his technology and his wife is kidnapped. In order to get her back, he’ll need to take down an army. All seen through the eyes of Henry, the rock ’em, sock ’em action unfurls as Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me Now” plays on. Actor Tim Roth also makes a cameo.\n\nAs for the newly delivered, just-as-action-packed-as-the-first trailer, we are introduced to Henry’s heavy breathing. Since he’s unable to speak, this sound proves Henry is indeed alive and will likely be prevalent throughout. The other thing the second visual introduces are the opinions of websites like Indiewire, Collider and Nerdist who refer to the film as revolutionary, and say it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen.\n\nDirected by Russian-born filmmaker Ilya Naishuller, the notion of shooting the film from a first person perspective was inspired by a music video Naishuller shot for his punk band Biting Elbows. Producer/director Timur Bekmambetov (Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter) saw the video and encouraged Naishuller to translate it into a feature.\n\nHardcore Henry had its premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival where it picked up a People’s Choice Award. In addition to Tim Roth, the film stars Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, Andrey Dementyev, Dasha Charusha, and Sveta Ustinova. Three cinematographers worked on the in-your-face project: Seva Kaptur, Feodor Lyass, and Pasha Kapinos. Produced by STX Entertainment, the film will have its U.S. premiere at SXSW next week before its nationwide theatrical release on April 8.\n\nAn image from HARDCORE HENRY courtesy of STX Entertainment"
