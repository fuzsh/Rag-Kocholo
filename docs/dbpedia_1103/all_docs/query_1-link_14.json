Five minutes later, he's being shot at, his wife has been kidnapped, and he should probably go get her back. Who's got her? His name's Akan; he's a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. Henry's also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow and everyone wants him dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy."
