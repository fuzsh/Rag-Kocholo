        "text": "‘Hardcore Henry’ Blasts Film Conventions With First Person Perspective\n\nAmanda Nolan\n\nAction fans will get a chance to experience something new with the release of the high-octane “Hardcore Henry.” While other films have experimented with a first-person point of view before, “Henry” utilizes the technique throughout the entire film. The style is reminiscent of FPS (first person shooter) video games such as “Call of Duty.”\n\nBesides the visuals, the movie also has a game-like premise. Waking up in a laboratory, Henry/the viewer has no idea what is going on. As a woman (Haley Bennett, “The Equalizer”) tinkers on his body, she informs Henry that he has no memory and that she is his wife. He apparently has been regenerated, cyborg-style, with super human/machine upgrades. Before she can activate his voice, she is abducted. Henry must figure out a plan to rescue her and is soon entangled with a powerful bad guy, Akan (Danila Kozlovsky), who is attempting to take over the world. Akan’s mercenaries are at every turn, and Henry is not giving up without an ultra-bloody and extreme fight.\n\nThe audience sees through Henry’s eyes as he falls from buildings, rides in high-speed chases and blasts his way through his mission. Assisting Henry is Sharlto Copley (“District 9,” “Chappie”), a sidekick of sorts who adds bits of humor to the action extravaganza.\n\nThis will be the debut film for Ilya Naishuller. Cutting his teeth on music videos – two in particular, “The Stampede” and “Bad Mother*****” (for the band Biting Elbows) – inspired the film. Not only did they draw millions of views, the videos caught the attention of Russian filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov. He contacted Naishuller to develop a full-length film using the first-person technique. The movie has received buzz since it premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in the fall of 2015.\n\n“Hardcore Henry’s” style is achieved with the use of GoPro cameras. In an interview with Collider, Naishuller talks about the challenges involved with pioneering this type of filmmaking: “Ultimately, I wanted to sit in the theater and watch a POV film that’s great. The film was created on set. We had a film and everybody knew what they were doing but every day had a huge amount of improvisation to feel like we got it in the end. We would come to set every day and we’d start shooting 20 minutes later. We would just go out there and shoot a crappy take, realize a thousand things that were wrong with it and then fix them. It was a huge amount of trial and error.”"
