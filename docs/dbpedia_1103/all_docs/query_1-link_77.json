The whole film is viewed through the eyes of Henry, a part cybernetic part human super warrior and is non stop action, including dozens of gruesome killings.\n\nIt is so near ridiculous that it is charming in its own way and a blast to watch if you are into this type of film.\n\nThink of it as John Wicks but from the eyes of Wick.\n\nDon't take it seriously, just laugh and cringe."
