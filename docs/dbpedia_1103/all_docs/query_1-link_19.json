        "text": "BURBANK, Calif. and STOCKHOLM, March 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As STX Entertainment prepares for the release of its wildly original action film Hardcore Henry, the studio has partnered with independent game developer, creator and publisher Starbreeze, which will integrate an all new character from the film and two new heists into its award-winning and phenomenally popular game PAYDAY 2.\n\nStarbreeze's successful PAYDAY franchise has more than 9 million active players worldwide. The Hardcore Henry promotion began on March 24th with the availability of a Jimmy Character Pack and a special online trailer directed by Hardcore Henry's visionary filmmaker Ilya Naishuller. The integration will move into full gear on March 31 and will marry the best action, characters and content gamers love when Starbreeze and STX team up to release two new full-throttle Hardcore Heists, allowing for intense and immersive interplay between the game and the forthcoming motion picture.\n\nThe Jimmy Character Pack DLC is free for all PAYDAY 2 players and will welcome Hardcore Henry's mysterious and multi-talented character Jimmy to the game's gang of heisters.

I'm so psyched to have Ilya direct our Payday-crew and introduce Jimmy in such a bombastic way,\" said Bo Andersson Klint, Starbreeze CEO. \"We're ecstatic to be able to expand our entertainment industry cross collaborations with this STX Entertainment partnership.\"\n\n\"Hardcore Henry and PAYDAY 2 are the perfect marriage of entertainment properties, and we hope that gamers join us on this amazing thrill ride,\" said Oren Aviv, President and Chief Content Officer of STX Entertainment.\n\n\"Ilya Naishuller is a one-of-a-kind talent who has re-defined the way motion pictures are experienced, and we are thrilled to continue to break new ground with him in interweaving the movie and gaming worlds with this unique marketing program with Starbreeze,\" said Jack Pan, President of Marketing for the STX Entertainment Motion Picture Group.\n\nABOUT THE MOTION PICTURE - HARDCORE HENRY\n\nStrap in. Hardcore Henry is an original film that was shot completely from the hero's perspective. You remember nothing. Mainly because you've just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who's got her? His name's Akan (Danila Kozlovsky); he's a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You're also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Sharlto Copley). He may be on your side, but you aren't sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You're likely going to need it…\n\nAudiences discovered Hardcore Henry at last fall's Toronto International Film Festival, where it became an instant breakout sensation, and was recently selected as a Headline Premiere at the world-renowned SXSW Film Festival. Hardcore Henry will be released nationwide on April 8, 2016.\n\nThe film is produced by Timur Bekmambetov, Ilya Naishuller, Inga Vainshtein Smith, Ekaterina Kononenko and written and directed by Ilya Naishuller. The cast includes Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, Andrey Dementyev, Dasha Charusha, and Sveta Ustinova.\n\nABOUT THE HARDCORE HENRY DLC/PAYDAY2\n\nJimmy Character Pack DLC – FREE\n\nJimmy - a new playable character brought to life in the new film by actor Sharlto Copley\n\nHeather Submachine Guns\n\nBallistic Knives\n\nThe Maniac Perk Deck\n\nTwo Masks\n\nThe Hardcore Heists DLC - FREE\n\nHardcore: The Boiling Point Heist\n\nHardcore: The Murky Station Heist\n\nWhite Streak Pistol\n\nElectrical Brass Knuckles\n\nFour Masks\n\nFour Patterns\n\nFour Materials\n\nTen Achievements\n\nFor more information regarding the Hardcore Henry DLCs, please visit www.overkillsoftware.com/games/hardcorehenry\n\nFirst launched in 2011, PAYDAY is a cooperative first-person shooter computer and video game franchise with more than 9 million players on PC, SteamOS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One.\n\nABOUT STX ENTERTAINMENT\n\nSTX Entertainment is a fully-integrated global media company specializing in the production, marketing, and distribution of talent-driven motion picture, television and multimedia content.
