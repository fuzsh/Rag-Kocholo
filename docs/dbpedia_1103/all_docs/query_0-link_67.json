        "text": "By putting the viewer in a first-person perspective as numerous death-defying stunt scenes are performed, there's no denying that \"Hardcore Henry\" is both a technical marvel and a revolutionary approach to narrative filmmaking the likes of which I've never seen attempted before. But with all its heart-pounding action and thrill-a-minute sequences of excessive violence, I had trouble keeping my eyes open, and not quite for the reasons I expected to.\n\nThanks in part to a thumbnail preview featuring a pair of bikini-clad women in medium close-up, a 2013 music video for Russian indie band Biting Elbows netted over 33 million views on YouTube, catching the attention of numerous social media users including producer Timur Bekmambetov (\"Wanted\"). Filmed entirely with the helmet-mounted GoPro cameras originally adopted by extreme sports enthusiasts, the clip managed to duplicate the POV style used in numerous video games, only in flesh and (lots of) blood. Bekmambetov convinced band frontman and video director Ilya Naishuller to expand the concept into a full-length movie, and assisted by rabid fans willing to help crowd fund the project, they were off and running.\n\nTake \"Robocop\" and replace the hero with one of the psychotic criminals who shot poor officer Murphy to pieces in the beginning of the film, and you've got the basic story for \"Hardcore Henry.\" Played by various stuntmen who wore the camera (depending on their particular skill set), Henry is a tatted-up maniac whose super scientist girlfriend Estelle (Haley Bennett, \"The Equalizer\") puts his mostly-destroyed body back together with enhanced cybernetic parts just in time for her to be kidnapped by telekinetic villain Akan (Danila Kozlovsky, \"Vampire Academy\"). For the remainder of the movie, Henry runs around through various types of terrain killing Akan's goons in an effort to both rescue Estelle and recover his own memory.\n\nOnce the \"wow\" factor of \"Hardcore Henry\" wears off - and it does so fairly quickly - all that's left to keep the audience's interest is a wonderfully zany turn by Sharlto Copley (\"District 9\"), who plays various incarnations of Jimmy, a helpful character who keeps dying and returning in different disguises. Rather than being disoriented by the camera gimmick, which actually isn't as nauseating as you might guess, I found the endless scenes of gunplay and combat to be somewhat hypnotic, resulting in my nodding off a few times near the end of the second act. When Henry is outdoors in natural light, the wild stunts work best, not unlike watching a Fail Army clip or an exciting Vine. But stretched out over 90 minutes, even the most unbelievable visual feats lose their punch, and even moments of extremely graphic Troma-style gore don't seem to matter anymore.\n\nI've seen some very kind reviews that compare \"Hardcore Henry\" to last year's Oscar-winning \"Mad Max: Fury Road,\" which I find to be horribly misguided attempts at communicating the only thing the films have in common: loads of impressive stunt work accomplished without the aid of CGI. The scant female characters in \"Henry\" are the complete opposite of the ones in \"Fury Road,\" and the final shot of Naishuller's film only amplifies the misogyny that runs rampant in the online gaming community his film will likely be embraced by. It's not a POV that I subscribe to, and not one that I found entertaining to be placed in.\n\nFollow Andrew Shearer on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/abhcinema."
