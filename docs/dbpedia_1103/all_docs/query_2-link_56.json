        "text": "Russian director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, known for directing Wanted and the remake of Ben-Hur, and producing the innovative films Hardcore Henry, Searching, and Unfriended: Dark Web, is bringing us a new film that is the first of its kind.\n\nV2. Escape From Hell will be the first film shot vertically, instead of the classic landscape format. This goes along with some of the other projects he has made, which were stories told from the point of view of a computer screen, tablet, or phone.\n\nThis film will be made in the era that Tik Tok and Snapchat videos are all shot in this format, except that we will be getting a full-length film shot this way. I’m not sure about this, but as long as the story is great, then I’m sure it’ll be fun to watch.\n\nHere’s the synopsis via Deadline:\n\nSecond World War pic V2. Escape From Hell will star Russian actor Pavel Priluchny as Mikhail Devyatayev, a captured Soviet pilot who leads an escape from a German concentration camp by hijacking an aircraft. The story is based on real events, the 75th anniversary of which was recently marked in February.\n\nThe film is set to begin in Russia next week, and will be produced for both Russia and the U.S. Are you interested in checking out V2. Escape From Hell in theatres?"
