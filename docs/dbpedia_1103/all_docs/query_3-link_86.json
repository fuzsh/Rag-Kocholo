        "text": "Alan Ritchson (Reacher, Fast X) is set to star in the upcoming action thriller Motor City, which comes from director Timur Bekmambetov (Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter).\n\nRitchson will take on the role of John Miller in the story, “a Detroit man released from prison, who unleashes a rampage of brutal vengeance on those who framed him. It explained that the movie will be “characterized by immersive visual storytelling, with stunningly choreographed and stylized action sequences.”\n\nBekmambetov is known for creating super cool stylized action sequences and it will be fun to see what he ends up doing with this next film project. Also, it’s good to see Ritchson land another big film project. Reacher definitely put him on the map and I think we’re going to start seeing more and more of him in new projects. Motor City seems like it will be a great project for him to be a part of.\n\nRitchson will next appear in Fast X, and the Lionsgate drama Ordinary Angels, opposite Hilary Swank. He also recently wrapped production on Black Bear Intl.’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare from director Guy Ritchie.\n\nBekmambetov said in a statement: “We have an incredible script that takes us into a gruesomely dark world. I’m thrilled to bring this story to life on the big screen. With the help of our amazing cast and the talented production team, we’re poised to create a cinematic spectacle.”\n\nProducers Greg Silverman and Jon Berg said: “Timur is a visual composer; he is one of the most innovative auteurs of our time with the ability to create stylistic action sequences. Having worked with Alan before on the upcoming ‘Ordinary Angels,’ his range and balance of the physical and emotional is what makes him an exciting new generation action star.”\n\nProducer John Friedberg added: “I love this script, it’s incredibly exciting and fast-paced and will be just the sort of distinctive action movie that audiences around the world are looking for. And having recently worked with Alan and seen what he is capable of, he is clearly going to be the next heavyweight action star.”"
