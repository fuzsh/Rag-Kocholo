        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: It took a few days, but bidders have found a movie worth fighting over. It’s the Ilya Naishuller-directed film Hardcore, which premiered in Midnight Madness on Saturday at the Ryerson Theatre. I’m hearing that Paramount, Lionsgate and Dimension are vying for worldwide rights and that the bidding is seven-figure minimum guarantee and wide-release screen commitment of 800-1000. Pic’s being sold by WME Global, and it’s expected to be settled by late tonight or tomorrow morning. Sharlto Copley, Haley Bennett and Cyrus Arnold star and Timur Bekmambetov is among the producers.\n\nWhat’s cool about it is the film is shot in first-person POV, video game style, and there is plenty of violence dragging through the streets of Russia. The official logline: You remember nothing. Mainly because you’ve just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry and congratulations, you’re now a cyborg. Five minutes later, your wife has been kidnapped and you should probably go get her back. Who’s got her? His name’s Akan, he’s just a psychotic megalomaniac with telekinetic powers, and a never-ending army of mercenaries. You’re also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, Russia and everyone wants you dead. Everyone, except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Copley). He might be on your side. Good luck Henry. You’re very much likely to need it…\n\nHere’s the trailer:"
