        "text": "“Wanted” and “Ben-Hur” director Timur Bekmambetov has become known in recent years for helping start a trend – the ‘Screen Life’ genre. That is, a film where the events unfold entirely on a desktop or phone screen.\n\n“Searching,” “Unfriended” and “Profile” have all used this technique and Bekmambetov served as producer on all three of those films. Bekmambetov also produced 2015’s “Hardcore Henry,” the first major feature shot entirely from a first-person perspective.\n\nNow he’s trying something new again, a $10 million WW2-set film titled “V2. Escape From Hell” which is being dubbed “the first blockbuster movie made entirely in a vertical format”.\n\nSocial media platforms like TikTok and Snapchat have seen the rise of ‘vertical content’ thanks to smartphone usage, and now this film is being made with that audience in mind.\n\nBased on real events, Pavel Priluchny stars as a captured Soviet pilot who leads an escape from a German concentration camp by hijacking an aircraft.\n\nFilming begins next week in Russia with two versions to be produced – a Russian one and an English-language international version. The latter is targeting an early 2021 release and will contain some different scenes including London bombing raids."
