        "text": "More than ten years ago, found footage films were all the rage. With more people using video calls on tablets, phones, and computers, these found footage films evolved to the next level of cinema. In fact, director and producer Timur Bekmambetov created his own screen capture technology called Screenlife for this type of filming and used in his upcoming film Profile.\n\nThe Profile movie is based on a true story about a journalist, who went deep undercover to be recruited by ISIS for a revealing article about their tactics. The story is based on the novel “In the skin of a Jihadist” by Anne Erelle, who was the French reporter and had to change her name as a result.\n\nHere’s the brief synopsis:\n\nProfile follows an undercover British journalist in her quest to bait and expose a terrorist recruiter through social media, while trying not be sucked in by her recruiter and lured into becoming a militant extremist herself. The unconventional thriller plays out entirely on a computer screen in Screenlife format, pioneered by Timur Bekmambetov.\n\nValene Kane and Shazad Latif star in this undercover thriller that’ll put you on edge since start to end. Timur Bekmambetov directed the movie from a script written by Bekmambetov, Britt Poulton, and Olga Kharina.\n\nALSO CHECK OUT: Federico Alotto on Terrorism Espionage Film Code Karim | BHFF 2021 [Exclusive Interview]\n\nLRM Online’s Gig Patta talked with director, producer and writer Timur Bekmambetov on Screenlife, the actors, and the real story behind this fascinating tale.\n\nTimur Bekmambetov gained a cult following after his hit Russian vampire franchise Night Watch and Day Watch, which became an international blockbuster. Since 2005, he directed many action hits, including Wanted, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, and Ben-Hur. With his Screenlife technology, he helped produced films such as R#J (Romeo and Juliet), Unfollowed, Searching, and Unfriended.\n\nFocus Features releases Profile in theaters this Friday, May 14.\n\nWatch the exclusive interview below.
