        "text": "Focus Features last month acquired global rights to Profile, the well-regarded thriller directed and written by Timur Bekmambetov that sets its action entirely on a computer screen. The format is called Screenlife, which Bekmambetov pioneered and first put to use with 2014’s Unfriended, which grossed about $65 million worldwide off a $1M budget for Universal.\n\nA producer on Unfriended, Bekmambetov directed and co-wrote Profile, which had its world premiere at the Berlin Film Festival and won audience awards both there and later that spring at SXSW. It follows an undercover British journalist (Valene Kane) in her quest to bait and expose a terrorist recruiter (Shazad Latif) through social media, while trying not to be sucked in by her recruiter and lured into becoming a militant extremist herself.\n\nBekmambetov penned the script, inspired by a true story, with Britt Poulton and Olga Kharina. Bekmambetov and Kharina are producers under their Bazelevs banner. Focus has set a May 14 U.S. release date for it; Universal is distributing internationally excluding CIS/Russia.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nLast summer, Universal and Bekmambetov inked a deal to partner on another five Screenlife features in various genres, so there’s more of this coming.\n\nCheck out the trailer above."
