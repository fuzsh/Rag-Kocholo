Mainly because you've just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who's got her? His name's Akan; he's a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You're also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy. He may be on your side, but you aren't sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You're likely going to need it...",

        "text": "Effective January 1st, 2009, The Dove Foundation Review Team has ceased reviewing all NC-17 rated movies and certain extraordinarily explicit R, PG-13 and PG-13 Horror rated films. This decision was reached due to the fact that Dove reviewers are parents or grandparents with conservative values. As such, we feel that we can no longer expose these dedicated and caring people to movies that contain distasteful and appalling stories that are focused on graphic horror and violence, and/or gratuitous depictions of explicit sex and nudity. “Hardcore Henry” is considered to be such a film. Our report is therefore limited to the business information (title, rating, distributor, producer, director, actors, etc.), synopsis, and the content chart."
