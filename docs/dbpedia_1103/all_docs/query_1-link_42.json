This is the kind of entertainment that gamers and cinephiles will recommend to their friends.\"\n\nStrap in.Hardcore Henry is an original film that was shot completely from the hero's perspective. You remember nothing. Mainly because you've just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry. Five minutes later, you are being shot at, your wife has been kidnapped, and you should probably go get her back. Who's got her? His name's Akan (Danila Kozlovsky); he's a powerful warlord with an army of mercenaries, and a plan for world domination. You're also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, and everyone wants you dead. Everyone except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Sharlto Copley). He may be on your side, but you aren't sure. If you can survive the insanity, and solve the mystery, you might just discover your purpose and the truth behind your identity. Good luck, Henry. You're likely going to need it…\n\nHardcore Henry will be released nationwide on April 8, 2016.\n\nThe film is produced by Timur Bekmambetov, Ilya Naishuller, Inga Vainshtein Smith, Ekaterina Kononenko and written and directed by Ilya Naishuller. The cast includes Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, Haley Bennett, Andrey Dementyev, Dasha Charusha, and Sveta Ustinova.\n\nAbout Fathom Events\n\nFathom Events is the event cinema distribution arm of AMC Entertainment Inc., Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and Regal Entertainment Group (known collectively as AC JV, LLC), the three largest movie theater circuits in the U.S., and is recognized as the leading distributor of alternative content.
