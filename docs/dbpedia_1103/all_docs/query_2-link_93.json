        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nStarring Chris Pratt and Rebecca Ferguson, sci-fi thriller Mercy is taking shape, with Kali Reis and Rafi Gavron among the actors joining its cast.\n\nFor the past few months, Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov has quietly assembled what could end up being one of the starriest sci-fi films of 2025. In January, Amazon MGM bought up the global theatrical rights for Mercy – which is unsurprising, given the package: it has Chris Pratt and Rebecca Ferguson attached as its stars, and Hollywood veteran Charles Roven as its producer.\n\nIn the weeks since, more and more names have been added, including Annabelle Wallis (who starred in the gleefully twisted Malignant) and Kali Reis, who made a strong impression in the hit series True Detective: Night County. Most recently, Deadline reports that four more actors have been added to the roster: Rafi Garon (A Star Is Born), Chris Sullivan (This Is Us), Kenneth Choi (9-1-1) and Kylie Rogers (Beau Is Afraid).\n\nBekmambetov has a proven track record as an action director – his biggest hit was 2008’s Wanted – while the script sounds as though it has some sort of enticing high concept behind it. Written by Marco van Belle, it’s “set in a near future where capital crime has increased,” and follows “a detective (Pratt) who is accused of a violent crime and forced to prove his innocence” according to its short synopsis.\n\nIt sounds like a futuristic take on The Fugitive, in other words, though we suspect there’s more to the plot that is being held back for now. In a statement earlier this year, Amazon MGM boss Jennifer Salke expressed her excitement over the project, and made it clear that it’s destined for cinemas rather than Amazon’s Prime streaming platform.\n\n“From the moment Chuck Roven brought us Mercy and we read Marco van Belle’s script, we knew the film was meant for the big screen,” Salke said. “As our relationship with The Terminal List and The Tomorrow War’s Chris Pratt continues to extend across film, we can’t wait to watch him bring this action-packed story to life, guided by Chuck and the vision of director Timur Bekmambetov. We could not imagine a better star and filmmaking team to execute on and deliver what is sure to be a gripping thrill ride and look forward to audiences being able to experience it in theatres.”\n\nMercy is due for release on the 15th August 2025. We’ll bring you more as we get it."
