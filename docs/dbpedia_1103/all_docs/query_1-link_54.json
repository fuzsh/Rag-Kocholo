        "text": "NEW YORK, March 25, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Sony Music Masterworks will release the soundtrack and score to STX Entertainment's much buzzed about, adrenaline-fueled action film Hardcore Henry, which hits domestic theatres nationwide on April 8th. The digital version of the soundtrack and the score by Dasha Charusha will be available on April 8 followed by a CD version of the soundtrack on April 15. Vinyl will be released in early summer.\n\nWinner of the \"People's Choice Award Midnight Madness\" at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, and a Headline Premiere selection at the SXSW film festival, Hardcore Henry is an unflinchingly original, first-person action film where YOU are the main character, Henry. You have just been rescued from the brink of death by your wife, who is kidnapped moments later. You have no memory, and no idea why the people who took her want you dead. Your mission is find her, solve the mystery of your existence & discover the truth behind your identity.\n\nThe film, which stars Sharlto Copley, Danila Kozlovsky, and Haley Bennett, was written and directed by Ilya Saishuller, and produced by Timur Bekmambetov, Ilya Naishuller, Ekaterina Knonoenko and Inga Vainshtein Smith.\n\nThe music on the soundtrack is as inventive and electrifying as the action in the movie. Recalling many memorable moments from the film, the soundtrack features songs from Queen, The Temptations, The Sonics, Devendra Banhart, The Drums and The Stranglers, along with songs written for the movie from writer/director Ilya Naishuller's band Biting Elbows, and Dasha Charusha, who also appears in the film. Dasha Charusha also composed the score to the film.\n\nFor more information on Hardcore Henry please visit:\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96EChBYVFhU\n\nWebsite: http://stxmovies.com/hardcorehenry/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HardcoreHenry/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hardcorehenry\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hardcorehenry/\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nSTX Entertainment is a fully-integrated global media company specializing in the production, marketing, and distribution of talent-driven motion picture, television and multimedia content.
