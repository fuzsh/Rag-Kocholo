        "text": "Chris Pratt has landed another big movie role as the actor is set to star in a new sci-fi project titled Mercy, which is being helmed by Timur Bekmambetov and produced by Charles Roven (Oppenheimer). The film project is set up at Amazon MGM. Pratt and Bekmambetov previously worked together on the action film Wanted.\n\nThe film is set in the near future “when capital crime has increased. The pic follows a detective (Pratt) who is accused of a violent crime and forced to prove his innocence.” This isn’t a concept we haven’t seen before, but the talent that’s attached to the film is what makes it interesting.\n\nJennifer Salke, head of Amazon MGM Studios said in a statement: “From the moment Chuck Roven brought us Mercy and we read Marco van Belle’s script, we knew the film was meant for the big screen. As our relationship with The Terminal List and The Tomorrow War’s Chris Pratt continues to extend across film, we can’t wait to watch him bring this action-packed story to life, guided by Chuck and the vision of director Timur Bekmambetov. We could not imagine a better star and filmmaking team to execute on and deliver what is sure to be a gripping thrill ride and look forward to audiences being able to experience it in theaters.”\n\nRoven added: “I could not be more thrilled to partner with Amazon MGM Studios on the release of Mercy. I have a longstanding working relationship with both motion picture and marketing chiefs Courtenay Valenti and Sue Kroll— whom have institutional knowledge of theatrical and proven track records of success at the box office. I am looking forward to reuniting with them in this new capacity, along with Jen Salke and the rest of the terrific team at Amazon MGM.”\n\nBekmambetov. also commented saying: “Amazon is the ideal partner for telling this crucial story about the future challenged by artificial intelligence and for engaging in this conversation with a wide audience. I’m happy to reunite with Chris Pratt on this project, who, since the release of Wanted, has become one of the highest-grossing actors of our time. Collaborating with Chuck Roven will help us create an epic cinematic experience.”\n\nThe movie is being written by Marco van Belle (Arthur & Merlin), and the movie will start production in spring."
