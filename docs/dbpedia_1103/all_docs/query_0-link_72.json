        "text": "As the one recognizable face who gets significant screen time in “Hardcore Henry,” Sharlto Copley (“District 9”) works his role for all that he can, appearing in a variety of guises. One minute he’s a lethal secret agent, the next he’s a braniac tech geek, then a coked-up hedonist in a leopard-print Speedo. Copley’s most entertaining look is vintage British punk rocker — which is fitting, since watching the movie’s anarchic, all-GoPro aesthetic feels like the contemporary cinematic equivalent of catching a Sex Pistols show.\n\nIf that sounds like your cup of spiked tea, then you’ll probably dig this wild action experiment, which spun out of a hyperviolent music video that Russian multi-hyphenate Ilya Naishuller shot for his band, Biting Elbows. Russian-Kazakh producer-director Timur Bekmambetov caught the viral clip and encouraged Naishuller to expand the approach into a full-fledged feature. The pair’s affinity is easily spotted in the finished product, which has an anything-goes energy and a foreign idiosyncrasy similar to Bekmambetov’s “Night Watch.” But the film also goes heavy on the sort of substandard performance elements you’d expect from a first-person shooter game or an intro short for a theme park ride.\n\nOur look at the world through Henry’s eyes starts in a futuristic medical lab, as he awakens, amnesia-stricken, to sexpot scientist Estelle (Haley Bennett, “The Equalizer”) lovingly outfitting him with cyborg limbs. Just after she informs Henry that she’s his wife — but conveniently, before he can get his audience-distancing voice module installed — they’re attacked by a paramilitary squad. When the goons nab Estelle, Henry has no choice but to trust Copley’s Jimmy, a mysterious Samaritan who seems to know the big picture, as well as the manual to Henry’s various gnarly A/V ports. Unfortunately, Jimmy gets killed, magically reincarnated, then killed again — and again and again — before he can fully share.\n\nThe rest is just Henry’s frenetic, gory quest for answers, punctuated by the odd run-in with Akan (Russian actor Danila Kozlovsky), an undercooked megalomaniac who’s like Andy Warhol playing Magneto. When the action is at its sharpest, such as with Henry’s mid-chase leap from a detonating truck onto the back of a motorcycle, it’s spectacular. Other times, it can be as wearying as generically hyper-edited Hollywood fare. If only Naishuller included more moments like an escalating last-act reveal by Copley, or Tim Roth’s micro-cameo as Henry’s dad. The legitimately dramatic POV shots can work as well as the chaotic ones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n★ ★\n\nHARDCORE HENRY\n\nWritten and directed by Ilya Naishuller.
