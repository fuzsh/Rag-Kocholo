Mainly because you’ve just been brought back from the dead by your wife (Haley Bennett). She tells you that your name is Henry and congratulations, you’re now a cyborg.\n\n5 minutes later, your wife has been kidnapped and you should probably go get her back. Who’s got her? His name’s Akan (Danila Kozlovsky), he’s just a psychotic megalomaniac with telekinetic powers, and a never-ending army of mercenaries. You’re also in an unfamiliar city of Moscow, Russia and everyone wants you dead. Everyone, except for a mysterious British fellow called Jimmy (Sharlto Copley). He might be on your side. Good luck Henry. You’re very much likely to need it.\n\n‘Hardcore Henry’ is directed by ILYA NAISHULLAR and produced by TIMUR BEKMAMBETOV (Wanted). The film stars SHARLTO COPLEY (District 9), DANILA KOZLOVSKY (Vampire Academy), HALEY BENNETT (The Equalizer), ANDREY DEMENTIEV, DASHA CHARUSA and SVETA USTINOVA.\n\nA release date is set for April 8th, 2016.\n\nRelated"
