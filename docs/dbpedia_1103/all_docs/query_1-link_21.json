        "text": "Hardcore Henry is not like other movies.\n\nDirected and written by Ilya Naishuller, frontman of Russian indie rock band Biting Elbows, and produced by Night Watch and Wanted director Timur Bekmambetov, it's a non-stop action caper filled with cyborg soldiers, clones, and an insane telekinetic warlord bent on world domination.\n\nIt's also shot entirely in first-person on GoPro cameras, channeling video game influences to create something unique in cinema – a visceral experience that puts you right in the heart of the film's adrenaline-fuelled madness. And while \"you\" star as Henry, the film sees the likes of The Equalizer's Haley Bennett, District 9's Sharlto Copley, and Russian actor Danila Kozlovsky in key roles.\n\nWIRED speaks with Naishuller on the movie's groundbreaking production, the impact of gaming, and the state of filmmaking in modern Russia.\n\n**WIRED: What were the biggest challenges of shooting Hardcore Henry on GoPros?**Ilya Naishuller: Well, production itself is pretty similar [but] every department had to update their working methods. For the actors, you're not acting with a partner as much as against a person wearing a camera rig. The camera was mounted at around the mouth area, and as humans we look at the eyes. The eyes are looking around the guy who's shooting for Henry, his eyes should be darting around. And obviously there's the biological impulse to look at the eyes. So on the second day we gave big reflective glasses to the guy playing Henry so that it wasn't distracting.\n\nThe stuntmen also found it difficult. You have a moving camera and no angle and you have to work around that, there's no cheating. There were a lot of rehearsals and a lot of room for improvisation on set; a lot of trial and error. It wasn't the most conventional way to make a film. I've been lucky that Timur and I knew this was not going to locked into a number of days because shooting was like R&D.\n\nWe knew we would be coming back to reshoots all the time. Every film is hard to make; there's no such thing as an easy film. But this was made more difficult by having no points of reference. I don't mean to sound too self-important but we're pioneering something that hasn't been done before. It's a new language and you have to learn the words before you can string sentences together.\n\n**Many gamers will be used to the first-person perspective, but did you do anything to mitigate potential motion-sickness for cinema-goers?**We did lots of tests; shooting, fighting, driving, jumping, climbing. We would look at stuff and see where we could push it as far as we could to make what we wanted. The biggest challenge technically was figuring out how we were going to stabilise the picture without resorting to CG or computer enhanced stabilisation because that would have eaten too much of our frame.\n\nSo we built rigs from scratch that we would mount on the cameraman who was playing Henry's head. [They had] a magnetic stabilisation system in the front which took quite a few prototypes to correct. We got the final prototype while we were two weeks into filming and that's when we got into our groove of how we would make it work.\n\nOf course, the idea of making a 90 minute POV film, you can't start out rough. That's why the film begins the way it begins – there's quite a bit of time before the shit hits the fan and we're in full motion. Had we started the film with a scene as strong as the finale, audiences would have a rough time.\n\n**Given the perspective, could you see Hardcore being ported to virtual reality?**All you get from VR is a screen in front of your eyes. There's no control with this. You can't control your perspective and VR isn't the most comfortable thing right now. I honestly don't think the future will be a VR film so much as a film/game kind of hybrid where you have a controllable world that you can move through except some of it will be filmed. It's like if you remember those 90's games that weren't very good – the FMV games – one of those, except with proper control and much better, that's where the future is.\n\n**Gaming is a clear influence on the movie – which titles were inspirations?**I'm sure there are a lot more references in there subconsciously than consciously. I played a lot of Left4Dead, I love that game. One of the most specially-built things in the movie was the guard hut on the roof at the end of the movie; that should be reminiscent of the guard hut in Left4Dead's first campaign. I got my production designer a copy and said \"if we're going to do a guard hut, this is what it should be like\". It's not 100 per cent similar but you've got a lot of elements – the medkit design was in there. I've played games all my life, I'm a big fan of FPS and strategy games.\n\nThere are a lot more things in the film that [aren't deliberate] but people pick up on – \"oh, that jump into the dumpster from the building is very Assassin's Creed\". I've never played Assassin's Creed but I've seen videos of it at some point so that kind of makes sense. Was that a conscious choice? No, but it's a pleasant surprise almost to find that you're borrowing from some great films and video games.\n\nBut at the same time we were filming the script, the crew were like \"why don't you make the first kill with a crowbar?\" And people were like \"yeah, a Half Life reference!\" That's what we wanted to avoid. The idea wasn't to make a film for video gamers, but a film for filmgoers and if they happen to like video games then they get an extra kick out of it.\n\n**Besides this and some of Timur Bekmambetov's films, we don't tend to get a lot of Russian cinema released in the west. What's the film scene like in Russia?**It's not very good, to say the least. What happened was when Timur released Night Watch in 2004, Russians started thinking \"wow, we're going to have new cinema\". Nothing got made in the 90s; there were a couple of small things in the 80s. We got to Night Watch and everyone was like \"oh shit, we can actually make good films and blockbusters!\" and film makers started creating. Of course, you had quite a few bad apples who made some shitty films and marketed them well, so you have a shit-ton of shitty comedies with the word \"love\" in the title. People's belief and respect in our nation's film-makers just dropped.\n\nSo now it's an uphill battle and those assholes are still making shitty movies and making our life difficult. It really pisses me off because we have plenty of talented people with a lot to offer the world. I'm afraid it's just me. Maybe life's hard because people do not trust their own countrymen to make good films any more.\n\nI don't think there's an easy solution. Fine, film making is a business, that's understood. It's the most expensive art form in the world. The difference in America is that the studio wants to make money as the first and foremost thing but at the same time they care about making something good, that gets good reviews, not just for the money. The money is primary but the second concern is quality. A lot of people care about it more for the art and then other people [distributors, etc] hope to make some money off it.\n\nIn Russia, there is nobody that gives a shit about the art part. The typical Russian producer tries to make money on the filmmaking process itself. They're taking money from the government and then making a piece of shit and they try to make money from the release. It's ridiculous. How is that supposed to work? I don't have a solution but while people still go to see not-very-good films and get pissed off at the film makers and themselves, we're not really going to be moving too far ahead.\n\n**Given the differences in cultures, are there any moments you think could be harder for western viewers to accept?**Well, here's the thing: I'm Russian and we're known for being incredibly homophobic. We're taught to hate America and NATO and gays and lesbians – they're the worst things in the world, apparently. I was born in Moscow but from eight to 14 I lived in London, so in my mind I have both hemispheres. When writing the script I really wanted to have a big \"fuck you\" to homophobes in the sense of Jimmy [Sharlto Copley's character]. He's very theatrical, he does like musical numbers.\n\nThe idea was – and Sharlto's going to hate me for this – when I was writing, I kind of wanted to hint at Jimmy as gay, because I thought it would be great to have an action movie where the lead is not a macho-macho dude. Pretty much all these lines about him being \"straight as an arrow\" are because he's military, he's an ex-sniper, he's never going to admit that he likes musicals. But will there be a problem? I know that every time I hear that [Jimmy could be seen as homophobic or stereotypical], I get a bit upset because that was 100 per cent not my intention. But it is what it is – it's not a politically correct movie to begin with.\n\n**There are a lot of elements left vague – the villain's powers, Henry's past. Was that deliberate?**Absolutely. I know where he got those powers and it's explained in a comic book that will be online pretty soon. I'm so tired of the over-exposition of every Hollywood movie where we have to have the origin story of everybody in the fucking cast. Sometimes it's good to have a little mystery. But there is a line in the movie that explains it. There's a comedic line, but honestly people going \"I wonder where he got his powers?\" is not the most critical thing in the world. The same with Henry; I know his background.\n\nI actually had a flashback scene explaining who he was but then I realised that it's clear he has a military background – obviously he's not a ping-pong player. He knows how to kill people, he has the muscle memory. You don't need to spoon-feed the audience. I get pissed off that most big movies don't respect the audience because they want to get the four quadrants and make sure that everybody in the theatre has to know exactly what's happening 100 per cent of the time. I don't think there's a lot of fun in that.\n\nHardcore Henryis in cinemas Friday 8 April.\n\nThis article was originally published by WIRED UK"
