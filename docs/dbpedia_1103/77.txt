Director Timur Bekmambetov will receive the International Filmmaker of the Year Award at CinemaCon, the official convention of the National Association of Theater Owners, which will be held April 23-26 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

Bekmambetov, who is currently directing and producing the live action adaptation of Seth Grahame-Smith’s novel Abraham Lincoln:Vampire Hunter, will be honored during the convention’s International Day, set for April 23.

“With some of the highest grossing films in Russian history, Timur Bekmambetov has brought a unique narrative to international film audiences since his feature film debut Peshavar Vals (Escape from Afghanistan) took a violent and realistic look at the war between Russia and Afghanistan,” CinemaCon managing director Mitch Neuhauser said. “From the fantasy films Night Watch and Day Watch to the action blockbuster Wanted, Bekmambetov has thrilled audiences around the globe with his cinematic point of view.”

Lincoln is also being produced by Tim Burton and Jim Lemley and is slated for release by Fox on June 22.
