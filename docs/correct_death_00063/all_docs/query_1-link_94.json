Harding was born on November 2, 1865, in Corsica, Ohio. He was the son of Dr. George Tryon Harding Sr. and Phoebe Elizabeth Dickerson. When Warren was 14, his family moved to Caledonia, Ohio, where he attended the local school. In 1882, he graduated from Ohio Central College. After graduation, he worked as a teacher, insurance salesman, and journalist.\n\nIn 1884, Harding bought the Mario Daily Star newspaper. On July 8, 1891, he married Florence Kling DeWolfe.\n\nHarding’s political career began when he was elected to the Ohio State Senate in 1899. From 1904 to 1906, he served as the Lieutenant Governor of Ohio after losing his gubernatorial run. By 1914, Harding was elected as a U.S. Senator. He was then nominated as the Republican Party’s Presidential candidate during the 1920 election.\n\nHarding won the 1920 presidential election with 60% of the popular vote and majority of the electoral votes. It was the first election to be broadcast on the radio and the first time women could vote.\n\nPresidency & Death\n\nOn March 4, 1921, Warren G. Harding took his oath as the 29th President of the United States at the East Portico, U.S. Capitol.\n\nIn May 1921, Harding signed the Emergency Quota Act, which limited the number of immigrants entering the U.S. In the same month, he also signed the Emergency Tariff Act, intended to raise tariffs to protect domestic products and end the post-war recession. In addition, the Budget and Accounting Act was signed in June. It created the Bureau of the\n\nBudget and the General Accounting Office under the Treasury Department. The law also obliged the President to submit an annual budget to Congress.\n\nIn July, Harding ended the war with Germany and Austria through a separate treaty instead of signing the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nThe Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act, which granted federal funds to states for maternal and childcare was signed later in September.\n\nThe Washington Naval Armament Conference was held in Washington, D.C. It was attended by U.S., Japan, Great Britain, France, Italy, China, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal.\n\nIn the same year, he signed the Revenue Act reducing the income tax of wealthy Americans. The Federal Highway Act was also signed, improving and expanding the highway systems.\n\nIn February 1922, the radio was first installed in the White House. Harding was also the first President to be heard on the radio during his dedication of the Francis Scott Key site. Key was the author of the Star Spangled Banner.\n\nPresident Warren Harding and His Cabinet Members\n\nPresident Harding’s Cabinet members included Charles Evans Hughes as the Secretary of State, Andrew W. Mellon as the Secretary of Treasury, John W. Weeks as the Secretary of War, Edwin Denby as the Secretary of the Navy, Albert B. Fall (1921-23) and Hubert Work (1923-) as the Secretary of Interior, Henry C. Wallace as the Secretary of Agriculture,\n\nHerbert C. Hoover as the Secretary of Commerce, and James Davis as the Secretary of Labor.\n\nHe allowed the farmers to buy and sell land through cooperatives under the Capper-Volstead Act of 1922. He also signed the law which created the Federal Narcotics Control Board.\n\nIn June 1923, Harding and the First Lady visited Alaska and the western states. They embarked via train from Washington to Portland and Oregon to San Francisco. It was believed that he developed pneumonia from his transcontinental trip.\n\nOn August 2, 1923, Harding died suddenly of a heart attack while staying at the Palace Hotel. His body was transferred cross-country through a funeral train. On August 8, a state funeral was held. His body was interred at the Marion Cemetery before it was re-interred to the newly-completed Harding Memorial in Marion, Ohio, in 1924. President Herbert Hoover dedicated the memorial on June 16, 1931.\n\nMuch of his correspondence was burned by his wife after his death. Speculations of corruption during his term came to public knowledge. Some of the big scandals involving his appointed officials include the Teapot Dome scandal, the Veteran’s Bureau scandal, Prohibition Bureau scandal, Shipping Board and the Office of Alien Property scandal, and Harding’s appointment of Harry M.
