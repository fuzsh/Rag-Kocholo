        "text": "Florence Kling Harding was a divorcée who had a son from her first marriage that she had given up to be raised by her parents by the time she met Warren Gamaliel Harding in 1890 when he was the owner and editor of the Marion Star newspaper in Marion, Ohio. Florence was instantly attracted to the handsome Harding, but the feeling wasn’t immediately reciprocated. Harding was five years younger than Florence and already had a reputation as a notorious womanizer. However, Florence was persistent in her advances and Harding was practically incapable of turning women down — his father, Dr. George Tryon Harding, once told him, “Warren, it’s a good thing you wasn’t born a gal. Because you’d be in the family way all the time. You can’t say no.” — and they were married in July 1891. It’s impossible to know whether Harding truly fell in lover with Florence, or if he saw her as a potential key to unlock his burning ambition, but it’s worth noting that Florence very quickly went to work running nearly every aspect of Harding’s newspaper business and helping turn it into a success financially. And that Harding was relentlessly unfaithful to his wife throughout their marriage. Warren and Florence never had a child together, but Harding fathered an illegitimate daughter with a young girl from their hometown of Marion, Ohio just a year before he was elected President (Harding’s daughter, Elizabeth Ann Britton, kept a low profile and avoided publicity throughout her life and died in 2005).\n\nBut despite Harding’s extensive infidelity and the scandals and allegations of corruption swirling around Harding’s Administration, Florence Harding — now First Lady — tirelessly attended to the 29th President of the United States after he fell ill during his cross-country Voyage of Understanding in the summer of 1923. She remained near his bedside as Harding rested and hoped to recuperate at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco in early August 1923. When they had first arrived in San Francisco on July 29th after canceling all planned events in California due to Harding’s illness, the President’s doctors were worried by his condition, which they had described as “grave”. Originally announced as “ptomaine poisoning” with severe indigestion caused by crabs or seafood that Harding had eaten while visiting Alaska, the bulletins released by his medical advisers noted that the President’s breathing was labored and he had a dangerously rapid pulse. After taking X-rays, the doctors also diagnosed Harding with pneumonia and were worried about the effects of his illness on his heart. But by August 1st, Harding’s fever had broken and his pulse and breathing were closer to normal. Although they had expected to remain in San Francisco for at least two weeks while Harding recovered, the President was in good enough spirits on August 1st to talk about traveling to Catalina Island where he was originally scheduled to go on a deep-sea fishing trip with his friend and supporter William Wrigley Jr.\n\nAs President Harding rested in Room 8064 of the Palace Hotel on Thursday, August 2, 1923, he was feeling better than he had in days. To the members of the Presidential traveling party that visited him throughout the day Harding acknowledged that he was tired but said that he felt “out of the woods.” In the afternoon, Harding and Secret Service agent Colonel Edmund Starling spoke again about deep-sea fishing off of Catalina Island before returning to Washington, D.C. and Harding joked about how he hoped to have better luck there than in Alaska where he didn’t catch any fish.\n\nEarly in the evening of August 2nd, Mrs. Harding brought in a copy of the latest edition of the Saturday Evening Post and thumbed to a story by Samuel George Blythe called “A Calm Review of a Calm Man”. With allegations of corruption bearing down on several of Harding’s closest aides and Cabinet officials, the President had been depressed and unable to find silver linings in the clouds gathering over his Administration. But as the First Lady read Blythe’s article out loud to him, Harding was pleased to actually hear some positive reviews about the President’s governing style. “That’s good,” said the President. “Go on; read some more.” As Mrs. Harding was reading, the President closed his eyes while reclining on the bed with his head propped up by the pillows. When she finished reading, the First Lady left Harding’s room and went to her nearby room in the suite while the President was seemingly sleeping.\n\nOne of the nurses attending to the President, Ruth Powdery, filled a glass with water in the bathroom and brought it to Harding so that he could take his medication before going to sleep for the night. The nurse was walking towards Harding when she noticed that his face suddenly twitched and his mouth dropped open. As the President’s head fell limply to the side and he slumped over the nurse called for Mrs. Harding who rushed into the room and instantly screamed for a doctor. Commerce Secretary Herbert Hoover and Interior Secretary Herbert Work ran into the room almost immediately along with Harding’s personal physician, Brigadier General Dr. Charles E. Sawyer, but it made no difference. It was 7:32 PM on August 2, 1923 and President Harding was dead. He was 57 years old.\n\nDr. Sawyer quickly declared that Harding had died of a cerebral hemorrhage, but there was some disagreement by others present about the exact cause of death. As other doctors arrived on the scene the distraught First Lady asked whether any of them could do anything for the President and it took nearly an hour before she could be convinced that Harding was actually dead. With the doctors disagreeing about whether or not the President had died of a stroke or a heart attack or some other cause, there was a push to conduct an autopsy in order to make a final determination. However, Mrs. Harding was adamantly opposed to allowing an autopsy to be performed on President Harding. She even refused permission for an artist to make a death mask of her late husband. Florence Harding’s actions in the wake of her husband’s death would later lead to allegations that she may have poisoned the President — either to punish him for humiliating her by engaging in numerous extramarital affairs or out of mercy to prevent his reputation from being further tarnished by the many scandals of his Administration. The rumors about Florence Harding possibly poisoning Warren G. Harding have never been backed by any solid evidence, but some of Mrs. Harding’s actions immediately after the President’s death were unusual. After Harding’s body was returned to Washington, D.C. and he was lying in state in the East Room of the White House, Mrs. Harding reportedly sat next to his open casket for several hours overnight while saying to the dead President’s face, “No one can hurt you now, Warren.”\n\nIn Plymouth Notch, Vermont, telephone services were turned off at night in 1923. At a farmhouse in this small rural area of Vermont, Colonel John Calvin Coolidge Sr., who was a justice of the peace and a notary public, was hosting his son and daughter-in-law, who had come to town for a few days of vacation. The Colonel’s son was the Vice President of the United States, Calvin Coolidge, and while he had learned of President Harding’s illness a few days ago, he was under the impression that Harding was improving and would make a full recovery. On August 2, Calvin Coolidge had helped his father with some yard work around the farm and went to bed fairly early. Late that night, Colonel Coolidge heard someone knocking on his door and answered it while Vice President Coolidge was still sleeping. Since there was no way to contact the Coolidge household by phone, the nearest telegraph operator rounded up two members of the Vice President’s staff who were staying nearby and a reporter and drove to Plymouth Notch. When Colonel Coolidge opened the door at about 10:30 PM, the men handed him a note for the Vice President that read, “The President died instantly and without warning and while conversing with members of his family at 7:30 PM. His physicians report that death was apparently due to some brain embolism, probably an apoplexy.”\n\nThe Vice President and his wife, Grace, were awakened shortly afterwards by his father calling for them and they headed downstairs. When Coolidge saw the look on his father’s face and heard the tone of his voice, he realized that President Harding was dead. “The only times I have ever observed that before,” Coolidge said of his father’s demeanor that night, “were when death had visited our family. I knew something of the gravest nature had occurred.” A special phone line was opened for Coolidge at a store near his father’s farm so that Coolidge could speak to Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Hughes recommended that Coolidge take the Presidential oath of office as soon as possible, seconding the opinion of the Attorney General, who had sent a telegram to Coolidge suggesting the same thing. The Secretary of State told Coolidge that he could be sworn in by any notary and Coolidge told Hughes, “My father is a notary.”\n\nColonel John Coolidge searched through his private library for a copy of the Constitution, which had the exact wording of the Presidential oath of office. A kerosene lamp was lit in Colonel Coolidge’s sitting room and at 2:47 AM on August 3, 1923, Calvin Coolidge was sworn in as the 30th President of the United States by his own father. When asked later what he was thinking at that moment, Coolidge remembered, “I thought I could swing it.” After he was sworn in, President Coolidge went upstairs and promptly went back to sleep. The new President and his family traveled to Washington, D.C. later that day to await the return of President Harding’s body, which was traveling on the same train that had taken him on his “Voyage of Understanding” as it crossed a country in deep mourning and the nation prepared for a State Funeral."
