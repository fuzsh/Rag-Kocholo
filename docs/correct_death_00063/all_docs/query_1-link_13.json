        "text": "I spent part of last week in San Francisco. While there, I heard a story. It’s actually more like a legend. I can’t believe it’s not common knowledge. Did a sitting U.S. President die in a speakeasy, in the arms of a woman who wasn’t the first lady?\n\nI love this stuff. History often doesn’t remember public figures as real people who make mistakes, embarrass themselves from time to time, have senses of humor, etc. This is a concept I have fun with in my latest novel, Bastards of the Revolution.\n\nAnd of all the mistakes to make, the mistake that causes your death might be the worst. No one wants to be remembered for that. Anyway…\n\nI went to a bar after dinner with friends last Wednesday in San Francisco. It was House of Shields. Near the corner of Market and New Montgomery. It’s vibe-y and storied without feeling old or retro.\n\nOur visit was one of convenience. We had dinner just around the corner. And I’ve been in House of Shields a handful of times. It’s across the street from the Palace Hotel. I wasn’t staying there on this trip, but I have in the past.\n\nAnd House of Shields is a pretty popular place to get a drink if you’re staying there. I’ve been there when it’s empty as well as when it’s crowded. And it’s usually just fine. Nothing remarkable. A constant in an ever-changing world. But this visit was different.\n\nHouse of Shields opened in 1908. The inside of the bar looks like the Titanic. Mahogany walls. Ornate light fixtures. It’s cozy but not cramped. Dark but not foreboding. It’s a dive bar, but a classy one.\n\nBut I saw something I hadn’t before. Something seemed out of place. A picture on the wall. Warren G. Harding. But why? In the ranks of U.S. presidents, he’s not much. Wilson or FDR are also era-appropriate statesmen. National treasures of their days. Wouldn’t their pictures make more sense?\n\nI wondered aloud, “Warren G. Harding?” One of my friends spoke up. He lives in the bay area. “Oh. They say he died in here.”\n\nI was intrigued. Everyone knows that Harding died at the Palace across the street. Just kidding. I had to look it up. But that’s my point. In my generation, only history professors and bar trivia geniuses remember him.\n\nIn 1923, Harding was traveling the west coast. He wasn’t feeling well in Seattle. The visit in Portland was cancelled, and his entourage made its way to San Francisco. He was attended by doctors, and died in the presidential suite at The Palace. His wife was reading to him. At least, that’s the official story.\n\nBut there are enough questions about his personal life to bring intrigue to his death. He loved women. One article I read claimed that “he liked sex so much, if he were a woman, he’d always be pregnant.” There is at least one known child out of wedlock.\n\nHis presidential term wasn’t without scandal either. Harding appointed friends to powerful positions in government. And at the time of his death, the scandals were about to break.\n\nApparently, his wife knew all about all it. She was a powerful personality. The alpha in the relationship, some say. And she let her displeasure be known. Several theories say she poisoned him.\n\nAs for House of Shields, life went on when prohibition hit. Like any successful business, it adapted. It became a brothel and speakeasy, frequently hosting elite clientele. Many of those patrons entered through underground tunnels allegedly dug from the Palace Hotel’s laundry room.\n\nAnd if you ask anyone at House of Shields today, the official story of Harding’s death is just a cover. Forget falling ill in Seattle. Forget poisoning.\n\nIn this neighborhood of San Francisco, the accepted story is this: The President died of a heart attack with a prostitute at House of Shields. His body was carried through the tunnels back to the Palace and staged in his room.\n\nI hunted for any piece of remaining physical evidence to support this story. The tunnels are the obvious choice. But 100 years later, they’re urban legend.\n\nI’ve found articles that claim any tunnel that existed between the Palace and House of Shields is now sealed off at both ends. I’ve found other articles that claim staff members of House of Shields will show you the tunnels if you’re VIP enough.\n\nWhen I asked one bartender if there were tunnels, he answered, “Not anymore.”\n\nUnwilling to give up, I tried the other bartender with the same question. He said, “Kinda. Not to the Palace, but still tunnels from what I can tell. I’m new.”\n\nI looked around. The door to the cellar was open. I whipped out my phone, dreamt up an on-the-spot story about looking for the restrooms, and started for the stairs. But the staff was on to me before I even hit the top stair. A bartender appeared from nowhere to shut the door. Here’s the best I got:\n\nFrom what I’ve read, it’s well documented that Harding died in bed at the Palace. And most historians seem to agree. But if he didn’t, how would we really know?\n\nI love that question. Look back at the leaders of previous generations. We preserve their most eloquent moments: speeches, appearances, diplomatic visits, etc. For the ones who came before photography, we see paintings of them at their most poised. Only at their most beautiful.\n\nBut they weren’t always like that. There’s no way George Washington lived his whole life without saying something that made him sound like an idiot. When you read between the lines, Andrew Jackson seems like a complete asshole. Was Harding a hard-partier? It’s easy to imagine.\n\nThis is one of those stories that proves how tricky it is to preserve human history. Even when we document something, all it takes is a tiny bit of doubt to make other generations wonder about the truth.\n\nWhy is that? Here’s the answer. Sometimes it’s more fun to believe a story than to believe the truth. And the farther in time we get from the thing that happened, the more room there is for stories about it.\n\nIn this case, the surviving evidence mostly points to Harding dying in his hotel room. But next time I’m in House of Shields, that’s probably not the story I’ll tell."
