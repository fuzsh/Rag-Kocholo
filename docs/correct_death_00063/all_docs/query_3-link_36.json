        "text": "Transcript\n\nOn April 14, 1922, The Wall Street Journal broke a story about bribes, corruption, and secret deals worth millions in oil money in the American West. The secretary of the interior was implicated in these crimes. The next day the Senate launched an official investigation. This revealed that Interior Secretary Albert Bacon Fall had secretly leased federal oil reserves to the executives of Mammoth Oil Company and Pan-American Petroleum Company without giving other companies a chance to bid for these coveted drilling rights, estimated to be worth as much as $100,000,000. In exchange, both executives, Harry F. Sinclair and Edward L. Doheny, had given Fall cash, bonds, and even six cows and two boars for his ranch in New Mexico. The executives alleged that the money was an “interest-free loan.” The scandal takes its name from the richest oil reserve involved, Teapot Dome, in Wyoming. The reserve was named for a nearby natural landmark, Teapot Rock, and was thought to contain as much as 200,000,000 barrels of oil. The two other reserves were located in California. These oil reserves had been set aside for the U.S. Navy. In 1919 the U.S. was consuming more than 90 percent of the oil it produced. Automobiles that ran on gasoline, a petroleum product, were quickly gaining popularity, and so were great big petroleum-powered ships. The Navy needed oil to fuel these ships, but the oil reserves granted by Congress weren’t supposed to be tapped unless there was a wartime emergency. President Woodrow Wilson held the line on drilling these reserves. Oil barons actively campaigned for Warren G. Harding, hoping for a reversal of the previous administration’s conservationist policies. After Harding was elected, he nominated Albert Bacon Fall as secretary of the interior. Fall was part of the Ohio Gang, a group of high-ranking politicians who would later become embroiled in scandals during Harding’s administration. Fall suggested that ownership of the reserves be transferred to his department. On paper this made sense, and it was done. Meanwhile, every oilman in the West was looking for a way to access these federally protected oil reserves. But Fall made a deal with his friends, Sinclair and Doheny. The scheme unraveled when oilman Leslie Miller (who would go on to become governor of Wyoming) spotted trucks bringing equipment into Teapot Dome. Miller alerted Senator John B. Kendrick of Wyoming, and a special investigation commenced. Fall was sentenced to prison, becoming the first cabinet member to be convicted of a crime in office. The oilmen escaped relatively unscathed. Sinclair was jailed for six months, and Doheny was acquitted. President Harding died in 1923, and the trials of the men involved didn’t conclude until 1930. Some historians think Harding might have been impeached for his role in the scandal if he had lived, but there has never been any evidence that he knew about the wrongdoings. The oil reserves were returned to the government and eventually sold years later—legitimately."
