        "text": "VOA Learning English presents America’s Presidents.\n\nToday we are talking about Warren Harding. He was the 29th president of the United States.\n\nHarding was very different from the 28th president, Woodrow Wilson.\n\nWilson supported change; Harding promised “a return to normalcy.”\n\nWilson took steps to protect American workers; Harding often worked to protect business owners.\n\nWilson was slow in supporting voting rights for women, and in accepting African-American people as equal to whites. Harding supported women’s suffrage and civil rights for African-Americans.\n\nYet both men were popular during their years in office.\n\nToday, however, historians usually think of Wilson as one of America’s best presidents. But Harding is remembered as one of the worst.\n\nEarly life\n\nWarren Harding was the eighth president from the state of Ohio. His parents were both doctors.\n\nHarding spoke about having a happy childhood, growing up on a farm with his brothers and sisters. Some of his favorite early activities were performing in a band.\n\nLater, Harding – along with two friends – bought a newspaper. The paper became successful for several reasons.\n\nHarding was kind to his employees and shared the company’s profits with them. He also tried not to publish stories that criticized politics or politicians from any party. Finally, he married a woman who had an excellent head for business.\n\nFlorence Kling Harding led the newspaper’s circulation department. She also helped to direct her husband’s political career.\n\nIn time, Warren Harding became a state senator, a lieutenant governor of Ohio, and then a member of the U.S. Senate. He especially liked being a senator – and many of the other lawmakers liked him.\n\nOne reason is because Harding rarely took a controversial position on any issue.\n\nInstead, he accepted most of the ideas of the Republican Party. He was also good-looking and had an excellent speaking voice.\n\nThese qualities helped earn him the Republican presidential nomination in 1920. A few months later, he easily won the national election.\n\nPresidency\n\nPresident Harding took office shortly after World War I ended. He promised to make Americans feel calm again, and also improve the nation’s prosperity. Two of Harding’s goals were to support business and to limit immigration.\n\nHe succeeded on both issues. His administration reduced taxes for big businesses and wealthy people. It also increased tariffs -- taxes on foreign imports.\n\nAnd the Harding administration put in place new rules on immigration. The rules made it easier for immigrants from northern Europe to enter the country, but harder for immigrants from Russia, eastern and central Europe.\n\nHarding also took steps to improve the effectiveness of the federal government.\n\nBut his administration is remembered mostly for its problems.\n\nAt the beginning of his term, Harding reportedly told friends that the job of being president was too much for him. He appeared to want to do well, and he worked hard. But he turned over most of the responsibility to his friends in the cabinet.\n\nA few were very able. But some were dishonest. They abused their positions to gain wealth for themselves and their families.\n\nOne of the most famous examples of corruption during Harding’s administration is known as the Teapot Dome Scandal.\n\nThe name “Teapot Dome” comes from a rock in the state of Wyoming. The rock looked like a teapot. Scientists correctly believed that oil could be found in the ground underneath it.\n\nAt the time, the U.S. navy depended on oil to fuel its ships. So, the federal government claimed the land in case the navy needed to use the oil in an emergency.\n\nBut a cabinet official who was a friend of Harding took control of the land. He gave a private company permission to search for oil on it in exchange for a large amount of money.\n\nSome lawmakers became suspicious. So they opened an investigation.\n\nIn time, lawyers proved the act of corruption. Harding’s friend was the first person to be found guilty of a crime while serving as a cabinet official.\n\nBut President Harding did not live to see his friend go to jail.\n\nThe investigation was just beginning when Harding took a trip to the West Coast to campaign for his policies.\n\nSome say that Harding was also trying to escape the problems in his administration. He reportedly told one reporter that worrying about what his friends were doing kept him awake at nights.\n\nDuring the trip, Harding showed signs of not being in good health. Doctors thought he could have food poisoning or pneumonia. He was taken to a hotel in San Francisco, California. For a day, he appeared to be feeling better.\n\nHe was sitting up in bed. And then suddenly, his body shook and collapsed. He died instantly.\n\nReports at the time differed on the cause of Harding’s death. Some even said that his wife poisoned the president to protect him from being punished for the wrongdoing in his administration.\n\nBut most historians think that he had long suffered from heart failure, and was struck by a heart attack. He was 57.\n\nLegacy\n\nMillions of Americans mourned over Warren Harding’s death. They stood beside railroad tracks as his body traveled from California back to Washington, DC.\n\nThe following year, Florence Harding also died. She and her husband are buried together under a grand memorial in their hometown in Ohio.\n\nBut in the years after his death, Harding’s public image worsened. More corruption scandals in his administration came to light. And some historians have criticized him for not having a clear idea about how he wanted to lead the country.\n\nIn 1927, a woman published a book saying she had a long, but secret relationship with Harding, both before and during his presidency. She also said he was the father of her daughter. Genetic testing has confirmed her claim.\n\nMore than 30 years after her book was published, a lawyer discovered love letters from Harding to a different woman. They confirmed that he had a long romantic affair with the wife of one of his friends. Harding had also been married at the time.\n\nThese reports, as well as the corruption during his administration, damaged Harding’s public image. But he also seemed to know that he would not be remembered as one of the best occupants of the White House.\n\nInstead, he tried to be likable and modest. He called himself “a man of limited talents” who was “not fit for the office” of president.\n\nI’m Kelly Jean Kelly.\n\nKelly Jean Kelly wrote this story for Learning English.
