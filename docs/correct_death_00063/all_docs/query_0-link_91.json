        "text": "The Aug. 10, 1923 Humboldt Times newspaper was filled with memorial tributes honoring the late President Warren G. Harding, who died Aug. 2 of that year in San Francisco of an apparent heart attack. Harding’s funeral took place Aug. 10, 1923, in Marion, Ohio, close to where he was born in 1865.\n\nOn the day of the funeral, myriad local stores, including Hinks in Eureka, were closed for several hours coinciding with the service time. The Humboldt County Lumber Manufacturers Association announced that all local lumber mills and camps were ceasing operations from 2 to 2:05 p.m. on that day “out of respect to the memory of the late President Harding.” Churches also held special memorial services, including a 9 a.m. service on the morning of the funeral at the St. Bernard’s Parish church in Eureka and an afternoon service at the Ferndale Congregational Church, where the Rev. Mrs. Heath gave a short program about the president’s life.\n\nA day later, the newspaper returned to its regular slate of local news. On the Sports page, an article ran about the Ford Garage Baseball Team losing its fourth straight game to a team from the logging company town of Falk. The Aug. 11, 1923 Humboldt Times also reported that William Jewett, a “well-known Eureka automobile man of the firm Lundblade and Jewett,” was honored with a banquet at the Eureka Inn for his retirement.\n\nThe paper said, “The dinner was attended by 65 automobile men from the bay district to whom invitations were sent out last week. Speeches were heard from some of the best automobile men in the country and from representatives of all branches of the industry.”\n\nOn Aug. 12, 1923, the Humboldt Times noted that under the “Wimsett System,” the Eureka Peoples Finance and Thrifty Co., one of a series of statewide banking institutions, had been organized with C. W. Hirschler named as local general supervisor. The new savings and loan office was located at 330 E St., Eureka, the paper said.\n\n“The capital of the local branch is $100,000, the entire control of the bank being vested in Humboldt people,” according to the Humboldt Times.\n\nOn Aug. 14, 1923, the newspaper ran an article about the “bigger and better” Stockmen’s Association of Humboldt County rodeo and barbecue taking place Aug. 18 and 19 in Fortuna.\n\n“An elaborate program for two days has been mapped out by an active committee under the direction of H. W. McWhorter, the president of the association; J. W. McClellan, the vice president; and Charles W. Moore, the general manager of the rodeo,” the Humboldt Times said.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1923, “aged local woodman” Olaf Christiansen, 86, died from stomach cancer, according to the newspaper.\n\n“He was an old-time mill man, having been in the lumber business here over 28 years,” the Humboldt Times said. The paper added that Christiansen — a native of Norway — was survived by his wife and one brother.\n\nThe week’s news wrapped up on a frightening note, with the Aug. 16, 1923 Humboldt Times stating that, “Poison which paralyzes and may prove fatal to humans and kills chickens, cats and dogs in a half hour is contained in Little River (near McKinleyville), according to reports from local physicians and Dr. J. W. Logan, county farm adviser. The poison is all the more dangerous … because no antidote has as yet been discovered and the origin is more or less mysterious.”\n\nThe newspaper reported that a local doctor, Edward Holm of Eureka, had recently “passed the crisis of a dangerous illness caused by the eating clams (from the water).\n\n“With an hour after partaking of the boiled clams, he became ill and the next morning had reached a condition bordering on paralysis. Improvement began from then on, but it is believed that if there had been more of the poison that serious consequences may have followed,” the Humboldt Times said.\n\nThe newspaper added that, “The cases of chickens eating the clam residue were not so favorable. In Arcata, 40 hens who had been fed on the scraps from the kitchen where the clams had been prepared for cooking, died within 20 minutes. Cats and dogs that partook of the residue were dead within an hour.”\n\nHeather Shelton can be reached at 707-441-0516."
