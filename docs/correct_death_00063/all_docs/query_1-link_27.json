        "text": "“Warren Harding died here” doesn’t quite have the tourist draw of “Washington slept here,” but for the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, the distinction of being the only hotel where a president of the United States drew his last breath is enough to put it into the pantheon of presidential sleep spots.\n\nScores of hotels around the country can lay claim to a little White House luster, having bedded down famous men before, during or after their stints in the White House.\n\nBut there are places that have earned a tighter tie with presidential history. Here’s a collection of must-stay presidential hotels.\n\nThe nation’s capital is crammed with hotels containing presidential lore. The Hay-Adams near the White House was built on the site of homes of John Adams’ grandson and Abraham Lincoln’s private secretary. Along with introducing air conditioning to the sweltering summer capital, it was used as a fundraising spot related to the Iran-Contra Affair during President Ronald Reagan’s term.\n\nBarack Obama moved in for two weeks before his inauguration when the Bush administration said the usual guest lodging, Blair House, was unavailable. For a true slice of American history, nothing can beat the Willard. Just down from the White House, it has hosted presidents going back to Zachary Taylor. Lincoln snuck into town after his 1860 election (Washington was basically a Southern town and many in the capital were friendly to the Secessionist cause) and used the Willard as his pre-inauguration headquarters. Lincoln’s bill is on display in the hotel’s small museum. Ulysses S. Grant, the Civil War general turned president, had the habit of making strolls to the Willard to enjoy a cigar. Men seeking to influence legislation or gain political appointments would hang out, hoping they could elbow their way to the president to make their case. The crowd that loitered in the lobby were dubbed “lobbyists.”\n\nNo smoking is allowed at the hotel on the south end of downtown Chicago, an ironic policy given that it was plumes of cigar, cigarette and pipe smoke that gave the hotel its place in presidential history. Chicago was a frequent choice for political conventions before World War II. It was often a choice to keep politics away from the East Coast power centers and to bring in as many people as possible, with its excellent rail connections and numbers of hotel rooms. The Blackstone was a center of the wheeling and dealing.\n\nThe hotel’s pinnacle came during the 1920 Republican convention. The convention was deadlocked and the action moved to a group of power brokers who gathered behind closed doors at the Blackstone. On the 10th ballot, Warren Harding was proclaimed the nominee. Raymond Clapper, a wire reporter, wrote that the victory had come in the “smoke-filled rooms” of the power brokers. Adding to the mystique, the hotel was a favorite of Chicago mobster Al Capone. The Blackstone fell into disrepair. It closed in 2000 but reopened as a Renaissance property in 2008 with modern amenities and an emphasis on the business trade and community events.\n\nThe hotel was new when the 1906 earthquake struck, sending the most famous opera singer of the day, Enrico Caruso, running into Market Street, reportedly in his bedclothes. The hotel was gutted by the fire that raged after the earthquake. Three years later it reopened as the city’s premier hotel address. In 1923, it hosted President Warren G. Harding. He had been ill with flu-like symptoms when he left for a trip to the Northwest. He was scheduled to go to Yosemite, but the weak chief executive was taken to San Francisco and installed in room 8064. While his wife was reading to him, Harding passed away, most likely from a heart condition. Mrs. Harding would not allow an autopsy. The Palace has been reborn under the Starwood Luxury Collection brand as one of the city’s finest.\n\nAcross the street from the Alamo is an old hotel with cool-blue tiles and cream-colored Corinthian columns in the atrium. The Menger is where former Assistant Navy Secretary Theodore Roosevelt stayed while assembling his Rough Riders to fight the Spanish in Cuba. Roosevelt trained his troops on a makeshift parade ground that’s now Roosevelt Park. Roosevelt was selected as William McKinley’s running mate in the 1900 election. A year later, Roosevelt became president when McKinley was assassinated and remade himself into a tough warrior-politician while staying at the Menger.\n\nThe Mission Inn, the amazing citadel in Riverside, has drawn more than a century of Republican politicians, going back to Benjamin Harrison, who visited the forerunner of the hotel. You’ll find a copy of the chapel in Assisi, Italy, and staircases and walkways that seem to be geometrically improbable. Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to stay the night, in 1903. Two of the country’s most interesting presidential artifacts are on display. First is a massive, carved wood chair with sturdy legs and bowed armrests that was built for a visit by rotund President William Howard Taft. Though generations of hotel visitors have taken their turn to be seated, there are reports that the chief executive himself declined to use a chair designed to accommodate his girth. The second spot is the hotel’s bar, which in the late 1940s was a meeting and reception room. It’s where Richard Nixon from nearby Whittier married his girlfriend, Pat. The room was later converted into the Presidential Lounge, with portraits of the presidents who have visited over the years. You can now have a cocktail in the room where the Nixons wed. Nancy and Ronald Reagan honeymooned at The Mission Inn.\n\nMore than two dozen presidents have stayed at The Greenbrier in West Virginia, a popular mountain getaway from Washington’s summer. It had an underground nuclear bunker to serve as the secret gathering place for the Congress in event of atomic war. You can tour the bunker.\n\nThe turreted Windsor Hotel in Americus, Ga., was the unofficial headquarters of the White House during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, who was from Plains.\n\nOne of the oddest photos of a president is of the taciturn Calvin Coolidge wearing a full Indian headdress while on tour in the western United States. You can still sample part of “Cool Cal’s” vacation destinations at the State Game Lodge, the 1927 “summer White House” in Custer State Park, S.D. Dwight Eisenhower also stayed there in 1953."
