        "text": "Florence Harding (born August 15, 1860, Marion, Ohio, U.S.—died November 21, 1924, Marion) was an American first lady (1921–23), the wife of Warren G. Harding, 29th president of the United States. Energetic, strong-willed, and popular, she was an important influence on her husband’s business and political careers.\n\nDaughter of Amos and Louisa Bouton Kling, Florence Kling grew up in comfortable circumstances, but her rebellious streak often put her at loggerheads with her stern father. After attending local public schools, she enrolled in the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music before returning to Marion, Ohio, where her father objected to her group of friends and acquaintances. At age 19 she became pregnant with the child of Henry DeWolfe. She later claimed that she had eloped with him and that he left her shortly after the child’s birth in 1880 (she retained custody of the child). Although her account was accepted by most historians, some later scholars questioned whether the marriage, as well as the divorce she said she had obtained in 1886, really took place.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll-American History Quiz\n\nIn 1890 Florence’s attention was attracted by the young Warren Harding, who had moved to Marion with his parents in the early 1880s and purchased the local newspaper, The Marion Star, in 1884. Nearly five years her junior, he did not appeal to Amos Kling any more than her other friends had. Despite his protests, the couple married on July 8, 1891, and Kling reportedly was estranged from his daughter for seven years.\n\nSoon after their marriage, Florence began working at the Star, where she oversaw circulation, advertising, and home delivery. One of the paperboys she supervised was Norman Thomas, who later became a socialist leader and journalist in New York City. According to Thomas, the Star’s success owed much to Florence’s “energy and business sense.”\n\nIt was during this period that Warren developed a romantic attachment to one of Florence’s best friends, Carrie Phillips. Their relationship, which caused considerable gossip in Marion, ended after Warren was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1914 and the Hardings moved to Washington, D.C. There were rumours of subsequent liaisons, however, including one with Nan Britton, who later claimed in her book The President’s Daughter (1927) that she and Warren had taken trips together while he was a senator and that he had fathered her child. In 2015 genealogists announced that DNA tests had confirmed that Harding was the father.\n\nIn 1920 Warren won the Republican nomination for president. Encouraged by her newspaper experience, Florence helped to make important decisions about the campaign’s dealings with the press, and as first lady she cultivated a close and friendly relationship with the country’s major newspapers. A firm believer in making the White House more accessible, she opened the mansion to public tours, often joining them herself, and invited thousands of guests to garden parties and other gatherings. Although never a leader in the feminist movement, she penned some remarkably revealing letters about how women could handle careers of their own; in one of them she wrote that, if the wife’s career is important, “then the husband may, with no sacrifice of self respect or of recognition…permit himself to be the less prominent and distinguished member of the combination.” She also consulted astrologers and appeared to take their predictions seriously. Her insistence on concealing her own considerable health problems—including several bouts of nephritis—and those of her husband left Americans unprepared for news of his sudden death on August 2, 1923, while she was at his bedside reading to him."
