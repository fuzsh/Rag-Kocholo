        "text": "ABOUT US ​\n\n​Opened in 1908, The House of Shields is one of San Francisco's oldest bars and has been called the place \"where time stands still.\" It has never had a clock on premises, and in keeping with tradition, it still doesn't.\n\nThe House of Shields has a rich history and a few mysteries to its name. It was a speakeasy during the Prohibition era, and is rumored to have a secret passageway where patrons of the Palace Hotel could sneak across the street for a forbidden beverage (we won't confirm or deny)."
