        "text": "WASHINGTON — In the years after President Warren G. Harding’s death, most of his papers disappeared. As the story goes, his wife, Florence, burned them all.\n\nWith a dearth of source material, rumor flourished.\n\nHarding, people wrote, had affairs, including with a woman who wrote a tell-all 1927 memoir professing to have borne his love child. Harding, they whispered, had committed suicide. Harding, they murmured, had been poisoned by his wife.\n\n“Basically, there was no one to speak for Harding,” said Library of Congress archivist Karen Linn Femia.\n\nMost of Harding’s papers were closed for 40 years by the Harding Memorial Association before they were opened for research in 1964.\n\nStill, misinformation marred his reputation. History remembers Harding primarily as the president linked to the Teapot Dome scandal, in which Harding’s interior secretary was convicted of accepting bribes and illegal loans in exchange for leasing public oil fields to cronies.\n\nHarding’s attorney general and his Veterans Bureau director had scandals of their own. Nobody linked Harding directly to them, but after the president died from a reported heart attack, few were willing to put their political capital behind a man who could not defend himself.\n\nWhat Harding had done during his two years in office was largely forgotten, including establishing the country’s first formal budgeting process, which cut the government budget in half in two years.\n\nHe also helped the nation emerge from a postwar economic decline, championed the eight-hour workday and backed anti-lynching laws.\n\nNow, it’s possible that the very thing that Harding’s family hoped to keep a secret might be a key to restoring his legacy.\n\nAbout 1,000 pages of letters between Harding and a lover, Carrie Fulton Phillips, were released to the public last week, and they reveal a man with intense ardor, but also with more intelligence and thoughtfulness than many in the public have perceived.\n\nThe letters don’t span Harding’s presidency — he and Phillips cut off their affair before then — but they do cover some of the Republican’s tenure as a U.S. senator.\n\nThe letters — occasionally steamy, with Harding writing of Phillips’ “thrilling lips … your matchless breasts … your incomparable embrace” — also include important historical context that counters Harding’s reputation as a lightweight.\n\n“It is astonishing, the amount of misinformation about Harding,” said James Hutson, the Library of Congress’ manuscript-division chief.\n\nThe letters show a senator who faced enormous pressure — from both his lover and his German-American constituents back home in Ohio — to oppose the United States’ entry into World War I, but who stared down those foes and voted for declaring war anyway.\n\nAnd they shine a light on Harding as a person.\n\nOhio lawyer and historian James D. Robenalt, author of The Harding Affair: Love and Espionage during the Great War, said Harding wrote to Phillips about his affection for a partially blind, three-legged dog that would show up at his back door.\n\n“These are the sorts of details that give you a feeling for the person,” Robenalt said.\n\nIt’s this sort of information that provides some relief to Richard Harding, the president’s grand-nephew.\n\nHis family remembers Harding as Uncle Warren, the man who taught his nieces and nephews to ride bikes and throw baseballs, and who left $10,000 to each niece and nephew for their education.\n\nThe family does not deny Harding’s long love affair with Phillips but is a bit squeamish about the occasionally explicit letters being put in the public domain.\n\n“It is our hope and your responsibility to not be distracted by the sexually explicit prose that fills parts of these letters, but instead to use all the information in them to reassess the measure of the man,” Richard Harding said.\n\nWhat the letters do reflect is an incredibly passionate romance between Phillips and Harding, whose wife, Florence, was ill with kidney disease. “This woman appears to be the love of his life,” Robenalt said of Phillips.\n\nBut that love had repercussions. Harding’s political ambitions might have been tempered by the affair.\n\nRobenalt said Harding could have been elected president as early as 1916. Instead, Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, who lost to Woodrow Wilson and later served as Harding’s secretary of state.\n\nRobenalt said that Harding’s love affair — and Phillips’ disapproval of his political aspirations — might have deterred a 1916 campaign for the White House. “The world changed because of this relationship,” he said.\n\nAnd had the affair been exposed, it could have been devastating for Harding, not just because of his infidelity, but also because of Phillips’ deep — and vocal — sympathy for Germany during World War I.\n\nThe two fought bitterly over Harding’s April 1917 Senate vote to enter World War I.\n\n“You say … that I ‘have helped to betray my country,’??” Harding wrote in a letter believed to have been written shortly after that vote. (Harding rarely dated his letters.)\n\n“It does not lessen my ordinarily high regard for your opinion to reply that I have voted in the best conscience and highest sense of duty which I am capable of feeling. … A vote is an inalterable record — no dodging, no escape. … If it is a blunder, if it is a betrayal, I shall have to pay.\"\n\nTo see the collection, go to www.loc.gov/collection/warren-harding-carrie-fulton-phillips-correspondence.\n\njwehrman@dispatch.com\n\nWarren G.
