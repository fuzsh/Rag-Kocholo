He died before the full investigation of the scandal was completed.[1]\n\nHis death was unnatural - He had the symptons of cornary problems just before his collapse and probably also had pneumonia. His physician was present when he passed on.[20][21]\n\nLegacy\n\nHarding County, New Mexico was named in President Harding's honor.\n\nSources\n\n↑ 1.00 1.01 1.02 1.03 1.04 1.05 1.06 1.07 1.08 1.09 1.10 1.11 Wikipedia: Warren_G._Harding\n\n↑ The Four Mysteries of Warren Harding\n\n↑ Wikipedia US Civil War\n\n↑ 1880 Federal Census\n\n↑ 1880 Federal Census\n\n↑ Upstairs at WhiteHouse, no primary source found\n\n↑ Upstairs at WhiteHouse, no primary source cited\n\n↑ 1880 Federal Census\n\n↑ 1910 Federal Census\n\n↑ 1880 Federal Census\n\n↑ Upstairs at WhiteHouse\n\n↑ Upstairs at WhiteHouse, no primary source cited\n\n↑ 1880 Federal Census\n\n↑ Upstairs at WhiteHouse\n\n↑ 1910 Federal Census\n\n↑ Upstairs at WhiteHouse\n\n↑ Wikipedia Marshall Eugene DeWolfe\n\n↑ About2.com\n\n↑ Whitehouse.gov President Harding\n\n↑ The Four Mysteries of Warren Harding\n\n↑ Strange Death of Harding\n\nFreemasons\n\nFind A Grave Memorial# 445\n\nWhitehouse.gov President Harding\n\nNNDB for President Harding\n\n[http://americanhistory.about.com/od/warrengharding/a/ff_w_harding.htm\n\nAbout.com Warren Harding\n\nabout2\n\nPublic Library Harding\n\nMiller Center Harding\n\nWikipedia US Civil War\n\nWikipedia Mrs Harding\n\nWikipedia Marshall Eugene DeWolfe\n\nThe Four Mysteries of Warren Harding\n\n*Footnote referral from Wikipedia, discusses the scandels associated with Warren Harding\n\nStrange Death of Harding\n\nBio of Harding\n\nbritanniaca\n\nUpstairs at the WhiteHouse\n\nRoyal Ancestry\n\nBrainerd, Lawrence.
