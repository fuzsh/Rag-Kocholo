        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1865–1923). “Back to normalcy” was the campaign slogan of Warren G. Harding, 29th president of the United States. War-weary American voters of 1920 liked the idea so much that they elected this Ohio newspaper publisher by a plurality of 7 million votes. Harding died August 2, 1923, before his term ended, but his conservative policies were followed by other Republican presidents during the prosperous 1920s.\n\nGrowing Up in Ohio\n\nBorn in the village of Corsica, later Blooming Grove, Ohio, on November 2, 1865, Warren G. Harding was the eldest of eight children of George Tryon and Phoebe Dickerson Harding. The growing family had a hard time making ends meet in the trying days following the American Civil War. The father worked as a farmer, a country doctor, and a general “trader.”\n\nWarren grew into a strapping, big-boned, handsome youth. He learned the chores of the pioneer farm—felling trees, splitting rails, chopping wood, planting and harvesting crops. When his father traded for an interest in a village newspaper, the lad taught himself typesetting.\n\nSchooling and Early Career\n\nHe started school in a little red schoolhouse in Caledonia, Ohio. When he was 14 he went to an academy in Iberia, called Ohio Central College. Though he had to drop out to earn money, he graduated in 1882. A popular student, he edited the yearbook, played an alto horn, and entered speaking contests.\n\nWarren also played his alto horn in the town band in Caledonia and later in Marion, Ohio, where his family moved. He became manager of the Marion Citizens’ Cornet Band. The story goes that he was so eager to lead the band in contests at county fairs that he plunged it into debt to buy uniforms. The investment proved a good one, for the Marion band won third prize in a state band festival in competition with units from Ohio’s large cities. The $200 award paid off the debt. Warren also played substitute first base on the town baseball team and joined in the other sports and amusements of a small town.\n\nLike many other 19th-century statesmen, he began his career by teaching school for a term. He later called it the hardest job he ever had. In Marion he tried his hand at reading law and selling insurance. He was only 19 when he found his life’s calling—newspaper work. Politics lost him his first job as a reporter on the Mirror, a Democrat weekly paper. Warren was already a strong Republican. As a supporter of the “plumed knight,” James G. Blaine, in the 1884 campaign, he dared to wear a Blaine campaign hat to work.\n\nHarding Buys the Marion Star\n\nWithin a few weeks, however, young Harding had become a publisher. A bankrupt daily paper, the Marion Star, was available to anyone who could pay the sheriff $300 and take over the mortgage. Warren persuaded two young friends to invest in the project and borrowed his own share from his recent employer, the publisher of the Mirror.\n\nThe survival of the daily, with its broken equipment, scanty advertising, and 10-cents-a-week subscription price, has been called a “minor miracle.” Warren at times did every task around the office from washing the inky rollers to writing editorials and selling printing and advertising. He pioneered in selling advertising as a business builder. His political activities helped increase revenues from official printing and advertising. As Marion grew, the fortunes of the Star improved. Harding was an enthusiastic Marion booster—active in all moves to bring in new industries that would increase population.\n\nMarriage to Florence Kling DeWolfe\n\nOn July 8, 1891, Warren married Florence Kling DeWolfe, divorced daughter of a Marion banker. Florence Harding’s business ability and ambition proved important factors in her husband’s success. She went to his office to help while he was ill. She stayed to take charge of the circulation department and other aspects of business management. The Star prospered and her husband had time for politics.\n\nYoung Harding enjoyed practicing his oratory at county political meetings. (He later coined the word “bloviate” for the rousing, “flag-waving” public speaking common in his youth.) At one of these rallies, when Harding was only 35, he met Harry M. Daugherty, a Columbus lawyer and political leader. Daugherty’s enthusiastic support later was to take Harding to the White House.\n\nIn 1898 Harding was elected to the state senate. His party loyalty and his ability to get party agreement on programs gained him popularity. He became lieutenant governor in 1904 but met defeat when he ran for governor in 1910. In 1914 he was elected U.S. senator from Ohio.\n\nA Popular Senator\n\nIn Congress he quickly gained popularity. He was placed on important committees. He voted for the two constitutional amendments of the period—the 18th, or Prohibition, Amendment, and the 19th, giving women the right to vote. On domestic issues he usually voted according to Republican policy. After America entered World War I he voted to give special war powers to the Democratic president, Woodrow Wilson.\n\nAfter the war, President Wilson asked for ratification of the Treaty of Versailles. Harding allied himself with the “strict reservationist” group of the Republican senatorial majority. The treaty included the Covenant of the League of Nations, which these senators held would limit national sovereignty. They proposed reservation after reservation and finally defeated the treaty on November 19, 1919.\n\nNomination and Election as President\n\nIn 1920 Americans were upset by the restrictions, sacrifices, idealism, and disappointments of the war years. Business, though enjoying high profits, wanted relief from war regulations and high taxes. Labor held that its wartime gains had been wiped out by the mounting cost of living.\n\nA business decline came in the spring of 1920. It brought unemployment and the collapse of farm prosperity. The people blamed their troubles on Wilson and the Democrats.\n\nRepublican senators felt that Wilson had extended the power of the presidency at the expense of the legislative branch. They wanted one of their own men in office. Although Harding had never gained much voter support, he felt his plea for a “return to normalcy” for the country would make him a favorable candidate. Harding announced his candidacy for president, with Harry Daugherty as his campaign manager. At the Republican nominating convention in Chicago, neither of the chief candidates, Gen. Leonard Wood or Governor Frank O. Lowden of Illinois, could gain a majority. Leaders met and selected Harding as their compromise candidate. He was nominated on the next ballot. Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts was selected as the vice presidential candidate. The Democrats nominated Governor James M. Cox of Ohio for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York for vice president. On November 2, 1920, Harding was elected president.\n\nIn Washington the Hardings opened the gates of the White House, locked since before the war. They welcomed their friends and well-wishers. Harding followed as many of his hobbies and interests as he could. He was an enthusiastic golfer and he also enjoyed boxing, motoring, fishing, baseball, and card playing. The Hardings had no children.\n\nLegislative Program and Cabinet\n\nAfter his inauguration, the new president called a special session of Congress and recommended a conservative program. It included strict government economy, the creation of a federal budget system, higher tariffs, tax reduction, restriction of immigration, and aid to veterans and farmers. A cooperative Congress quickly passed a joint resolution declaring World War I officially ended. Other legislation included the budget and accounting bill and a temporary tariff bill. The Fordney-McCumber Act of 1922, with the highest tariffs in history, and an immigration restriction bill, setting a quota for aliens from each country, were also passed.\n\nHarding’s administration was also responsible for the Washington Conference of 1922, at which treaties limiting and reducing naval strengths among world powers were negotiated. Congress adopted a liberal program of care for disabled veterans, but when it passed a soldier’s bonus bill, Harding vetoed it on economic grounds. His chief service to labor occurred when he personally induced “big steel” to drop the 12-hour day.\n\nHarding’s Cabinet was a mixture of distinguished men and personal or political friends. He had great and unquestioning confidence in them all. The chief accomplishments of his term reflected the leadership of Charles E. Hughes, secretary of state; Andrew Mellon, secretary of the treasury; and Herbert Hoover, secretary of commerce.\n\nForeign and Economic Affairs\n\nHughes presided at the Washington Conference on Limitation of Naval Armaments, which Harding called for November 12, 1921. The principal naval powers invited were Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. Invitations also went to China, Belgium, Portugal, and The Netherlands. Hughes boldly proposed that there should be a naval building holiday for ten years. He also proposed that several United States, British, and Japanese ships should be scrapped and that the ratio in capital ships power between these nations should be 5-5-3 respectively. The Hughes program was largely adopted. Other treaties provided for the maintenance of China’s territorial integrity and sovereignty and the principle of the “open door.” Japan agreed to withdraw from Shantung.\n\nUnder Secretary Mellon both the national debt and federal tax rates were reduced. Congress, however, refused to cut taxes on high incomes as much as Mellon requested.\n\nOil Leases and Other Scandals\n\nHarding’s faith in certain appointees proved misplaced. He named Albert B. Fall, a former senatorial associate, secretary of the interior. Fall induced Edwin Denby, secretary of the Navy, to transfer naval oil reserves to the control of the interior department. Harding signed the executive order making the transfer. Fall then leased drilling rights in the Elk Hills, California, and Teapot Dome, Wyoming, reserves to friends who were oil promoters. When a senatorial committee investigated the transaction it appeared that he had received large “loans” and blocks of Liberty Bonds from the lessors. In the meantime Fall had resigned from the Cabinet. He was later prosecuted and, after long delay, convicted for his part in the affair. He served nine months in prison. The leases were canceled in 1927.\n\nOther scandals arose regarding graft by the Alien Property custodian and the director of the Veterans’ Bureau. Harding’s friend Attorney General Daugherty resigned and was tried on charges of corruption.\n\nPresident Harding was spared the pain of most of these revelations. Early in 1923 he had a severe attack of influenza, followed by other disorders. His wife’s health was also poor. Harding was concerned over the Republican loss of seats in both houses of Congress in the 1922 election. He decided that a speaking tour would be helpful alike to his health and to his popularity. Accompanied by his wife and a party of 65, he set out on a transcontinental trip that included a visit to Alaska. Instead of helping him relax, the trip exhausted him. He became ill in Seattle and was taken to San Francisco, where he died on August 2 under somewhat mysterious circumstances. Calvin Coolidge became president. Florence Harding immediately returned to Washington and burned all of Harding’s papers.\n\nHarding had been a popular president, and he was deeply mourned. He was buried in a memorial tomb erected in Marion by public gifts."
