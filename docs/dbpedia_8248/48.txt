A federal appellate court Friday upheld U.S. District Judge Michael J. McShane’s order that counties across Oregon release criminal defendants from jail if they’re not appointed a lawyer within seven days of their initial court appearances.

The seven-day rule had been on hold but now will go into effect unless the state appeals the 2-1 decision by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
