        "text": "The Governor’s Council on Aug. 7 confirmed four of Gov. Maura T. Healey’s picks for Superior Court judgeships: John C. Fraser, Keren E. Goldenberg, Matthew J. Nestor and Deepika B. Shukla.\n\nAll of the candidates secured unanimous approval, except Nestor, from whose vote Councilor Marilyn M. Petitto Devaney abstained. Devaney said she received calls and letters with concerns about the nominee, but that the process was too short for members of the public to weigh in.\n\nThe other three nominees each received the backing of all seven councilors.\n\nShukla is chief of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Springfield, where she supervises cases in western Massachusetts and has represented the U.S. in prosecutions of violations of excessive force, hate crime, terrorism, fraud, and violent crime statutes, according to Healey’s office. She previously was a plaintiffs’ civil rights attorney at the Connecticut Fair Housing Center and in private practice.\n\nGoldenberg focuses on criminal defense cases in her Belmont solo practice. She was previously a trial attorney with the Committee for Public Services in Lowell and with the Legal Aid Society of New York City. Healey’s office said Goldenberg is a member of the “murder list” for the CPCS and the Criminal Justice Act panel for the U.S. District Court in Boston.\n\nFraser is a co-founder and the manager at Fraser Law Office in Andover, where he practices criminal defense and civil litigation.\n\nNestor’s hearing was held seven days after Healey nominated him on July 17, which Devaney said was not enough time for members of the public and the council.\n\nNominees fill out questionnaires to submit to the Governor’s Council, and Devaney said on Aug. 7 that those surveys are due eight days before the hearing — which in this case was before he was nominated. She pointed to the questionnaire issue as an example of an ongoing trend of the council quickly moving nominees through the appointment process.\n\n“There are people who wanted to speak in opposition to this nominee, but they didn’t know he was appointed, and they looked at the website to see who was going to have a hearing and they saw that this nominee’s name was up and his hearing was over,” Devaney said.\n\nCouncilors in July called for Healey to quickly fill judicial vacancies, especially on the Superior Court, which has been stretched especially thin.\n\nDevaney called for the council to delay its vote on Nestor for one week, but the vote continued on a motion by Councilor Terrence W. Kennedy. Councilors Joseph C. Ferreira, Christopher A. Iannella, Eileen R. Duff, Kennedy, Paul M. DePalo and Tara J. Jacobs voted for Nestor’s nomination.\n\nNestor already sits on the bench, as a longtime District Court judge. He oversaw the state Securities Division and was a civil litigator and assistant district attorney in Suffolk County earlier in his career.\n\nSee also:"
