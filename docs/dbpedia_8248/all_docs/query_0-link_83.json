        "text": "A federal judge in Portland has been appointed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secretive panel that approves or denies wiretaps and other forms of eavesdropping in terrorism and espionage investigations.\n\nU.S. District Judge\n\n, who served as the U.S. attorney for Oregon at the time of the 2002\n\n, became the newest judge appointed to the surveillance court, according to published reports.\n\nA staffer in Mosman's office confirmed the appointment on Friday, but declined to elaborate. Mosman could not be reached for comment.\n\nNews of the appointment has circulated since it was reported in the\n\n.\n\nThe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, enacted during the Carter administration in 1978, created the highly specialized court. A 2001 amendment to the law, a portion of the U.S.A. Patriot Act, extended the number of judges assigned to the court from seven to 11.\n\nMosman, the newest member of the FISA court panel, took office as a judge in Portland's U.S. District Court in 2003, having been nominated by President George W. Bush.\n\nHe is the presiding judge in the case of United States v.\n\na city of Portland employee charged in March with giving money and advice to a man who blew himself up in the massive 2009 bombing at the headquarters of Pakistan's intelligence agency.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if Mosman's appointment last month to the court in Washington, D.C., will have any impact on his caseload in Portland."
