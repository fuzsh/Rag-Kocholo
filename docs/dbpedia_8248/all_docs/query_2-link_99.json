Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Stephen E. Whitted, AG No. 47, Sept. Term, 2021 (filed Aug. 1, 2024).\n\nMaryland Appellate Court\n\nAppeals; circuit court in banc: Where a party argued that Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article § 12-303 applies only to appeals to the appellate courts, and not in banc review in the circuit court, its argument was rejected. Section 12-303 permits interlocutory appeal to the circuit court sitting in banc in any circumstances where interlocutory appeal to the Appellate Court is permissible. Bajaj v. Bajaj, No. 1267, Sept.

Maryland courts have repeatedly stated that parents may not waive the obligation of child support. Houser v. Houser, No. 2220, Sept. Term, 2022 (filed Aug. 1, 2024).\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit\n\nEmployment\n\nHonest belief\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where a company terminated a man’s employment because it honestly believed he was misusing leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, it prevailed on his FMLA claims.\n\nCASE: Shipton v. Baltimore Gas & Electric Company, Case No. 23-1360 (filed July 31, 2024) (Judges Harris, Benjamin, FLOYD).\n\nFACTS: Michael Shipton appeals the district court’s order granting summary judgment in favor of his employer Baltimore Gas & Electric, or BGE, on claims related to use of rights conferred under the FMLA.\n\nLAW: Shipton first argues that the district court misapplied the “honest belief doctrine” to this case. The Fourth Circuit has expressly declined to address the application of the “honest belief doctrine” to FMLA interference claims or retaliation claims. The court again declines to address the doctrine today. Notably, in the district court below Shipton did not argue the district court erred in applying the doctrine.\n\n“It is well established that this court does not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal, absent exceptional circumstances.” Shipton does not point to any “exceptional circumstances” that necessitate this court’s review of this issue for the first time, and this court cannot find anything in the record that demonstrates “a reason sufficient to clear this high bar.”\n\nShipton next argues the district court erred in awarding summary judgment on the interference claim because the court failed to consider that Shipton later submitted a request due to neuropathy (where it originally specified leave for hypoglycemia), and the request was approved. The record demonstrates conflicting paperwork, and therefore Shipton’s argument that just because he submitted a later request nullifies the claim of misconduct is incorrect. Because the FMLA allows for an employee to be terminated for misconduct, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment as to the interference claim.\n\nShipton’s FMLA retaliation claim cannot prevail either. As the undisputed evidence shows, Shipton submitted certifications that he took FMLA leave for hypoglycemia and later submitted letters from the same healthcare providers that he had not experienced hypoglycemia for over two years. After BGE investigated and found his medical paperwork and statements contradictory, it believed he was misusing leave.\n\nShipton also cannot show a genuine dispute as to indirect evidence under the McDonnell Douglas burden-shifting framework. Shipton argues that BGE’s reasoning was pretextual because BGE employees made up “false” allegations that Shipton was misusing his FMLA leave and inappropriately considered his FMLA leave during performance reviews. However, the evidence in the record demonstrates that BGE believed he was misusing leave. While he may not have been actually misusing leave and clarified his FMLA certification after the fact, this inquiry only has the court determine whether the employer’s reason was legitimate and nondiscriminatory at the time and not “whether the reason was wise, fair, or even correct.”\n\nShipton filed suit in 2020, and the default statute of limitations under the FMLA is two years. However, if the employer engaged in a willful violation of the FMLA, the limitations period is extended to three years. Because BGE attempted to get to the root of conflicting medical certifications and paperwork, those statements do not rise to an FMLA violation, let alone a willful violation. Shipton therefore is not entitled to the extended statute of limitations for his claims made under the FMLA.\n\nLastly, Shipton argues the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Exelon Corporation, Exelon Business Services Company and the individual defendants on the ground they were not Shipton’s “employer” under the FMLA. While Shipton argues that there is substantial evidence that the three individual named defendants played a part in events that culminated in Shipton’s termination, he does not point to any evidence they had “sufficient responsibility or stature within the [defendant employer] to warrant the imposition of personal liability under the FMLA.”\n\nAffirmed.\n\nMaryland Supreme Court\n\nNegligence\n\nChoice of law\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where two experts testified, without opposition, that a woman was injured in Virginia during a liposuction procedure, Virginia’s damages cap applied to her medical malpractice and failure to obtain informed consent claims filed in Maryland.\n\nCASE: Doctor’s Weight Loss Centers Inc. v. Blackston, No. 17, Sept. Term, 2023 (filed July 31, 2024) (Judges Fader, Watts, Hotten, Booth, Biran, Gould, EAVES).\n\nFACTS: This case arises from a liposuction procedure that Dr. Alva Roy Heron Jr. performed on Shelly Blackston at his office in Alexandria, Virginia. During the procedure, she experienced excruciating pain, which Dr. Heron treated with additional injections of the local anesthesia he had administered prior to beginning the procedure.\n\nAfter the procedure, Ms. Blackston returned to her home in Maryland, where the pain continued. Within a few days, an infection manifested, and she required hospitalization and underwent several procedures to treat that infection. As a result of the procedure, Ms. Blackston suffers from permanent physical and emotional injuries.\n\nMs. Blackston filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice and failure to obtain informed consent in the Circuit Court for Prince George’s County. The jury awarded Ms. Blackston non-economic damages of $2,000,000, economic damages of $60,000 and medical expenses of $240,900.\n\nThe circuit court reduced the non-economic damages to $755,000, consistent with Maryland’s statutory cap on non-economic damages. The Appellate Court of Maryland reversed, however, holding that Virginia’s damages cap applies because Ms. Blackston was infected and, therefore, first injured (completing her claim) in Virginia.\n\nLAW: To determine which state’s substantive law applies, because the case was filed in a Maryland court, the court turns to Maryland’s choice of law rule, lex loci delicti. Ms. Blackston sued petitioners for medical negligence and failing to obtain her informed consent. The elements of each tort make clear that both require that the plaintiff have sustained injuries and, therefore, that neither tort is “completed” until the occurrence of an “injury” that is attributable to the defendant’s wrongful conduct. Thus, critical to resolving the choice of law issue is the following question: as to each cause of action, what constitutes a sufficiently cognizable legal “injury”?\n\nBased on the expert medical testimony admitted at trial, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that Ms. Blackston sustained an injury in the form of an infection in Dr. Heron’s Virginia office, where the procedure was performed. Based on testimony from Drs. Ramineni and Frank that the infection itself “started” and was “introduced” during the procedure while Ms. Blackston was in Virginia, this court agrees with the Appellate Court that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the part of the jury’s verdict that is dependent on whether she was injured in Virginia or Maryland. The court stresses that there was no challenge to the admissibility of that testimony that would permit this court to assess its reliability. As a result, the question is whether evidence admitted at trial can sustain the jury’s verdict, not whether that evidence was correct or scientifically valid. As discussed, the evidence was sufficient.\n\nJudgment of the Appellate Court of Maryland affirmed.\n\nSanctions\n\nAttorney discipline\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where an attorney violated rules of professional conduct while engaged in pro se litigation with his former wife, her new husband, her attorneys and judges who ruled against him, he was suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in Maryland.\n\nCASE: Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland v. Stephen E. Whitted, AG No. 47, Sept. Term, 2021 (filed Aug. 1, 2024) (Judges Fader, Watts, Booth, Biran, GOULD, Eaves, Hotten).\n\nFACTS: The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland filed a petition for disciplinary or remedial action against Stephen E. Whitted. The Commission charged Mr. Whitted with violations of the Maryland Attorneys’ Rules of Professional Conduct, or MARPC, the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct, or GRPC, and the Washington Rules of Professional Conduct, or WRPC. Following a hearing, the court found by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Whitted violated WRPC 3.1 (meritorious claims and contentions) and 8.4(a) (misconduct). The hearing judge also found three mitigating factors and six aggravating factors.\n\nMr. Whitted excepted to multiple findings. The Commission excepted to three findings.\n\nOral argument was held before this court on June 3, 2024.\n\nLAW: Most of Mr. Whitted’s exceptions to the hearing judge’s findings of fact are of the “failure to find” variety—that is, he complains that the hearing judge did not make findings that align with his characterization of the various litigation events discussed above.\n\nThese exceptions have no merit. The hearing judge was tasked with determining the facts relevant to the specific charges of misconduct, not to relitigate the many state and federal proceedings where Mr. Whitted had received adverse rulings. And the hearing judge was within her discretion not to credit Mr. Whitted’s testimony on such matters and to decline to ascribe the significance Mr. Whitted attaches to such matters.\n\nMr. Whitted also excepts to the hearing judge’s findings that detail the events in the custody and child support litigation in Georgia. He claims that such findings are irrelevant because the charges under the GRPC were dropped. The court overrules this exception for two reasons. First, the findings provided history and context to the pending charges and are therefore relevant. Second, Mr. Whitted does not contend that any such findings were not supported by the evidence.\n\nThe hearing judge found, by clear and convincing evidence, that Mr. Whitted violated WRPC 3.1 (meritorious claims and contentions) and 8.4 (misconduct). Mr. Whitted excepts to both findings on general and specific grounds. The court finds that each violation was supported by clear and convincing evidence and thus overrules Mr. Whitted’s objections to each.\n\nMr. Whitted challenges the hearing judge’s failure to also find the mitigating factor of remorse. The hearing judge had an ample basis to find that Mr. Whitted was not remorseful for his actions. As such, his exception is overruled.\n\nThe hearing judge concluded that monetary sanctions imposed against Mr. Whitted for bad faith litigation conduct in the Washington courts was a mitigating factor proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The Commission points out that Mr. Whitted has not paid the sanctions assessed against him. Thus, the rationale for treating such sanctions as a mitigating factor—that the goal of protecting the public may have been advanced somewhat by such sanctions—does not apply here. Accordingly, the Commission’s exception to the hearing judge’s finding that the sanctions imposed by the courts of the State of Washington is a mitigating factor is sustained.\n\nThe hearing judge found that the Commission proved by clear and convincing evidence six aggravating factors. Mr. Whitted’s exceptions to those findings are overruled. The hearing judge declined to find the aggravating factor of submission of false evidence, false statements or other deceptive practices during the attorney discipline proceeding. The Commission excepts to the court’s failure to find this factor.\n\nThe court finds that because Mr. Whitted recycled the same misrepresentations in these proceedings, the same clear and convincing evidence that supports the WRPC 8.4(c) violation likewise supports the aggravating factor of false evidence, false statements or other deceptive practices. The court therefore sustains the Commission’s exception to the hearing judge’s failure to find this aggravating factor. While the Commission excepts to the hearing judge’s failure to find “a likelihood of repetition” of Mr. Whitted’s conduct, the court cannot find that the hearing judge’s failure to find this aggravating factor was clearly erroneous.\n\nWhitted’s conduct, though egregious and harmful, was cabined to his pro se representations. There is no suggestion of misconduct by Mr. Whitted in any professional capacity. That fact, combined with the lack of any prior discipline and his character and reputation, leads the court to conclude that although Mr. Whitted should be sidelined, a sanction short of disbarment is warranted. Accordingly, effective immediately, Mr. Whitted is suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in Maryland.\n\nMaryland Appellate Court\n\nAppeals\n\nCircuit court in banc\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where a party argued that Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article § 12-303 applies only to appeals to the appellate courts, and not in banc review in the circuit court, its argument was rejected. Section 12-303 permits interlocutory appeal to the circuit court sitting in banc in any circumstances where interlocutory appeal to the Appellate Court is permissible.\n\nCASE: Bajaj v. Bajaj, No. 1267, Sept. Term, 2023 (filed July 31, 2024) (Judges WELLS, Leahy, Eyler, Deborah)\n\nFACTS: Following a four-day merits hearing limited to issues of custody and access, the court found that the mother had deliberately estranged the minor children from father. But due to the strength of the minor children’s alienation from father, the trial court denied father’s requested 2-2-5-5 division of physical custody on the basis that it was not in the minor children’s best interest to be parted from mother for five days at a time. The court also ordered a holiday schedule granting father periods of custody longer than five days.\n\nFather requested in banc review of the custody order. A panel of the circuit court held that the trial court had abused its discretion as it did not explain how the terms of the custody order could be reconciled with its own fact-finding.\n\nLAW: Mother contends that the in banc panel lacked jurisdiction to consider the custody order. She argues that the Maryland Constitution, and Maryland Rule 2-551 do not permit in banc review to be taken from non-final orders of the trial court. She contends that Maryland Code, Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, or CJP, § 12-303, which allows for appeal of certain types of interlocutory orders of the trial court, does not apply to in banc review in the circuit courts. This court finds no support for this approach in the court’s appellate case law interpreting Article 4, Section 22 and Rule 2-551.\n\nThe statutory provisions which grant appellate jurisdiction to this court, CJP § 12-301 et seq., control the grant of appellate jurisdiction generally, not only in the appellate courts, but to in banc tribunals as well. Further, there is no question that provisions of Subtitle 3, Title 12 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article other than CJP § 12-301 define the statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction; in general, the court applies these to in banc panels with the same force as to an appellate court.\n\nWhile it appears that neither this court nor the Supreme Court have had occasion to say so directly in previous cases, it clearly follows that appeals which would typically be heard in the Appellate Court pursuant to CJP § 12-303 may also be heard by an in banc panel. This court holds that CJP § 12-303 permits interlocutory appeal to the circuit court sitting in banc in any circumstances where interlocutory appeal to the Appellate Court is permissible.\n\nMother next argues that, because Father was not “deprived” of custody entirely, the custody order was not entitled to an interlocutory appeal. But this court does not read CJP § 12-303(3)(x) to require complete denial of custody or access for interlocutory appeal to be proper. Consequently, in banc review was permissible in this case.\n\nTurning to the in banc court’s decision, this court agrees that there is a logical disconnect in the trial court’s reasoning: given its finding that it was not in the minor children’s best interest to be apart from mother for periods of five days or more, it left unexplained why it would be in their best interest to be in father’s custody for longer holidays such as father’s two-week summer access. The in banc panel ordered the modest remedy of remand to the circuit court for reexplanation and reconsideration of its order. This was an appropriate manner of clarifying the trial court’s reasoning.\n\nJudgment of the in banc panel of the Montgomery County Circuit Court affirmed.\n\nContract\n\nWaiver\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where the circuit court held the wife waived a requirement that husband sign their Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement Agreement by a specific deadline, but the record did not show any waiver, the circuit court’s contrary order was reversed.\n\nCASE: Pattison v. Pattison, No. 110, Sept. Term, 2023 (filed Aug. 1, 2024) (Judges GRAEFF, Nazarian, Eyler, James).\n\nFACTS: This is the second appeal filed in this court by wife in connection with her divorce from husband. In the first appeal, wife challenged the ruling of the circuit court that the Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement Agreement signed by the parties was valid and enforceable. Wife also challenged the circuit court’s order awarding husband attorney’s fees in the amount of $22,752.50. This court dismissed the appeal because a final judgment had not yet been entered in the parties’ divorce case. This appeal was noted after a Judgment of Absolute Divorce was entered.\n\nLAW: Wife contends that the circuit court erred in granting husband’s motion to enforce the agreement. She asserts that the agreement was delivered to husband’s counsel with the condition that it be signed on September 25. She argues that the agreement expired at the end of that day when the condition was not met, and therefore, there was no contract or final agreement.\n\nThe circuit court appeared to find, however, that given the unambiguous language in the agreement, it did not need to address wife’s argument that the failure to meet the time condition resulted in no contract being formed. This court disagrees with that analysis.\n\nHusband does not dispute that he did not sign the agreement until September 28. Husband argues, however, that there was not a valid condition precedent to formation of a contract in this case for several reasons. First, he argues that, because the condition asserted by wife was made in a letter, and the letter was not admitted into evidence, there was no evidence establishing that there was a condition imposed that the agreement be signed on Sept. 25, 2020. The record belies that contention.\n\nHusband next argues that the condition precedent to the formation of a binding contract was not effective because the time condition was not contained in the agreement, and it was given only in a separate letter. He cites no authority, however, to support that position.\n\nHusband finally contends that, even if the letter properly imposed a time condition, the condition was not clear and unambiguous. He initially asserts that there was “no explanation of what ‘today’ meant.” Moreover, he asserts that, given that the documents were not sent to his counsel until 3:51 p.m. on Sept. 25, 2020, and that the next sentence after the time condition was: “I will assume that we will have the initial Guaranty signed by Mr. Pattison by close of business day Monday,” he thought that all the documents needed to be signed by Monday, September 28.\n\nHowever the letter stated that the agreement was delivered in settlement of the parties’ disputes “on condition that the Agreement and Note be executed by [husband] today,” with the assumption that the parties would have a “final guaranty signed by [husband] by close of business on Monday.” The plain language of this letter was unambiguous and clearly indicated that wife was including a condition precedent to a binding contract, i.e., that husband sign the agreement and the note that day, Friday, September 25. Accordingly, a reasonable person would have understood the letter to mean that the agreement was conditioned on it being signed by the end of the day Friday, September 25.\n\nThe circuit court found that, even if there initially was a condition precedent that the agreement had to be signed on September 25, wife, by her conduct, waived that condition. It stated that husband’s counsel indicated on September 25 that husband would not be able to sign the agreement until September 28, and there was no evidence that wife rejected the offer to sign on September 28.\n\nThis court has reviewed the evidence presented and found no evidence to support the court’s findings in this regard. Husband did not testify that his counsel conveyed to wife’s counsel that he was unable to sign the agreement until Monday, and counsel did not testify. There has been no contention here of an express waiver by wife of the condition to sign by September 25. Moreover, the court’s review of the evidence indicates that there also was no conduct indicating an intent to waive the condition.\n\nAnd because this court construes the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to be based on its finding that wife breached the agreement, this court reverses the order that wife pay husband’s attorney’s fees.\n\nJudgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County reversed.\n\nCriminal\n\nJUVRA\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where a defendant filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to the Juvenile Restoration Act, the General Assembly has created a balancing test, requiring courts to consider the 11 factors without any one factor receiving special weight.\n\nCASE: Trimble v. State, No. 1834, Sept. Term, 2022 (filed Aug. 1, 2024) (Judges Reed, Beachley, GETTY).\n\nFACTS: James Russell Trimble was convicted of first-degree murder, first-degree rape, two counts of first-degree sexual offense, two counts of kidnapping and one count of sexual assault in 1982, when he was a few months shy of his 18th birthday. In 2022, he filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to the Juvenile Restoration Act, or JUVRA.\n\nThe JUVRA allows an individual “convicted as an adult for an offense committed when the individual was a minor” to file a motion to reduce the duration of their sentence if the individual was sentenced before Oct. 1, 2021, and has been imprisoned for at least 20 years for that offense. The circuit court denied his motion.\n\nLAW: Trimble contends that the circuit court placed too much emphasis on the severity of his crime and thus did not effectuate JUVRA’s purpose. In his view, the proper application of Md. Code, Crim. Proc., or CP, Art. § 8-110, requires the circuit court to give the most weight to CP § 8-110(d)(5), “whether the individual has demonstrated maturity, rehabilitation, and fitness to reenter society sufficient to justify a sentence reduction,” because JUVRA was enacted to provide sentence reductions for rehabilitated juvenile defendants.\n\nWhile Trimble is correct that Maryland’s juvenile justice statutes have an overarching philosophy of promoting amenability and rehabilitation, there is nothing in CP § 8-110 that indicates that rehabilitation should be given the most weight when considering a motion for sentence reduction. The statute does not have enumerated purposes by which to determine how to weigh its factors. In the absence of such guidance, the General Assembly has created a balancing test for JUVRA motions, requiring courts to consider the 11 factors in CP § 8-110(d) without any one factor receiving special weight.\n\nAlthough an individual’s rehabilitation is certainly a part of the equation for determining whether the interests of justice are better served by a reduced sentence, rehabilitation is not the only element of that consideration. Each of the remaining nine factors enumerated in CP § 8-110(d) could contribute to the interests of justice determination in any given case, as could any unenumerated factor a court deems relevant.\n\nThus, all that is required of a circuit court is that each factor is considered in the court’s decision and that its decision is issued in writing. The court did so here by enumerating and addressing each factor in CP § 8-110(d) based upon the evidence presented. It was not required to weigh the rehabilitation factor more heavily than any other factor.\n\nTrimble points to rejected amendments that would have excluded people serving life sentences without parole or those convicted of certain serious crimes from pursuing sentence reductions under JUVRA. Because the General Assembly rejected those amendments, Trimble argues, it would be contrary to the legislature’s intent to deny a JUVRA motion based primarily on the severity of the underlying crime. The court finds that Trimble places too much weight on rejected amendments.\n\nTurning to the circuit court’s decision, it states “Trimble was three or four months shy of his 18th birthday at the time of the killing of Nila Rogers. This factor weighs against reducing the sentence.” Trimble argues that the circuit court misapplied 8-110(d)(1), “the individual’s age at the time of the offense.” Trimble asserts that the legislative intent behind JUVRA indicates that the defendant’s age can only be used as a mitigating factor, not as an aggravating factor.\n\nNothing in § 8-110 indicates that a court must only consider the movant’s age as a mitigating factor. Given that the movant’s status as a minor is a prerequisite for a motion to reduce their sentence, considering age as a factor would be duplicative of the eligibility determination if the circuit court could not use its full discretion to weigh age as either for or against sentence reduction.\n\nTrimble also believes that the court reached an incorrect conclusion regarding his rehabilitation and misunderstood his Antisocial personality diagnosis. However, the circuit court has great discretion in considering a JUVRA motion to reduce a sentence, particularly where there is conflicting evidence.\n\nJudgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County affirmed.\n\nDomestic relations\n\nChild support\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Where the parents agreed that the father would have no obligation to support their five-year old child, but the circuit court nevertheless ordered the father to make monthly child support payments in accordance with the Maryland child support guidelines, it did not err. Maryland courts have repeatedly stated that parents may not waive the obligation of child support.\n\nCASE: Houser v. Houser, No. 2220, Sept. Term, 2022 (filed Aug. 1, 2024) (Judges ARTHUR, Shaw, McDonald).\n\nFACTS: The parents of a five-year-old child agreed that the father would have no obligation to support the child even though the mother would have primary physical custody and the father’s income is more than twice the mother’s. The circuit court refused to accept the agreement. Instead, the court ordered the father to make monthly child support payments in accordance with the Maryland child support guidelines.\n\nThe parents appealed. Because mother and father both contended that the circuit court had erred and that it had violated their constitutional rights in ordering father to pay child support, the court asked the Attorney General to file an amicus brief. He did, arguing: (1) that a court must follow the guidelines unless it would be unjust or inappropriate to do so and (2) that Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), does not require a court to endorse an agreement in which the parents have agreed to forgo child support.\n\nLAW: Although a court may depart from the guidelines when they generate an unjust or inappropriate result, Maryland courts have repeatedly stated that parents may not waive the obligation of child support. By adhering to the guidelines unless it would be unjust or inappropriate to do so, courts can avoid the possibility that they may approve putative agreements that result from pressure, fear or other power imbalances.\n\nAgainst this body of authority, mother and father argue that the court erred in awarding child support because, they say, they had voluntarily withdrawn the issue from consideration. The court disagrees. They purported to withdraw the issue of child support only after the court told them that it would not approve an agreement to waive child support altogether. In these circumstances, allowing the parents to withdraw the issue of child support would be tantamount to allowing them to waive the child’s right to support, which they cannot do.\n\nMother and father next argue that the guidelines apply only in “contested” cases, but that their case was not “contested” because they had reached an agreement to waive the child’s right to support. This argument is nothing more than a variant of their fallacious argument that the court could not award child support because they had “withdrawn” the issue.\n\nThe parents next argue that the legislature “acknowledged and approved of the ‘bargaining’ of child support.” They cite Maryland Code, Family Law, or FL, § 12-202(a)(2)(iii)(1), which permits a court to depart from the guidelines if an agreement provides for other forms of financial support for a child. But they point to no agreement by which father undertook to provide other forms of financial support for the child.\n\nMother and Father go on to assert that under FL § 12-202(b)(1)(i) “[a] court may decline to establish a child support order if the parent who would have the obligation to pay child support . . . lives with the child who would be the subject of the child support order and is contributing to the support of the child.” They claim the benefit of this provision because the child lives with father 39 percent of the time. The parents did not make this argument in the circuit court, so it is not preserved for appellate review. But even if it were preserved, their argument would seem to permit a court to dispense with child support in most, if not all, cases in which the parents have shared physical custody. That could not be what the guidelines intended.\n\nThe parents’ final argument is that the circuit court violated their federal constitutional right, as fit and proper parents, to determine how much to spend on the support of their child. Nothing in Troxel undercuts the court’s earlier statement that parents have “no liberty interest” in avoiding validly imposed financial obligations to their children. Other courts have identified this same distinction between a parent’s liberty interest in the care, custody and control of a child and a parent’s legal obligation to support a child.\n\nJudgment of the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County affirmed."
