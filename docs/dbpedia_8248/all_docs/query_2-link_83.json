        "text": "Am I giving up anything by filing a claim or not filing a claim?\n\nMembers of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class who did not exclude themselves by the deadline will be bound by the terms of the Class Settlement Agreement, including the release of claims against the Defendants and other released parties identified in Paragraph 30 of the Class Settlement Agreement, whether or not the members file a claim for payment.\n\nThe settlement will resolve and release claims by class members for monetary compensation or injunctive relief against Visa, Mastercard, or other defendants. The release bars the following claims:\n\nClaims based on conduct and rules that were alleged or raised in the litigation, or that could have been alleged or raised in the litigation relating to its subject matter. This includes any claims based on interchange fees, network fees, merchant discount fees, no-surcharge rules, no-discounting rules, honor-all-cards rules, and certain other conduct and rules. These claims are released if they already have accrued or accrue in the future up to five years following the court’s approval of the settlement and the resolution of all appeals.\n\nClaims based on rules in the future that are substantially similar to – i.e., do not change substantively the nature of – the above-mentioned rules as they existed as of preliminary approval of the Settlement. These claims based on future substantially similar rules are released if they accrue up to five years following the court’s approval of the settlement and the resolution of all appeals.\n\nThe settlement’s resolution and release of these claims is intended to be consistent with and no broader than federal law on the identical factual predicate doctrine.\n\nThe release does not extinguish the following claims:\n\nClaims based on conduct or rules that could not have been alleged or raised in the litigation.\n\nClaims based on future rules that are not substantially similar to rules that were or could have been alleged or raised in the litigation.\n\nAny claims that accrue more than five years after the court’s approval of the settlement and the resolution of any appeals.\n\nThe release also will have the effect of extinguishing all similar or overlapping claims in any other actions, including but not limited to the claims asserted in a California state court class action brought on behalf of California citizen merchants and captioned Nuts for Candy v. Visa, Inc., et al., No. 17-01482 (San Mateo County Superior Court). Pursuant to an agreement between the parties in Nuts for Candy, subject to and upon Final Approval of the settlement of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class, the plaintiff in Nuts for Candy will request that the California state court dismiss the Nuts for Candy action. Plaintiff’s counsel in Nuts for Candy may seek an award in Nuts for Candy of attorneys’ fees not to exceed $6,226,640.00 and expenses not to exceed $493,697.56. Any fees or expenses awarded in Nuts for Candy will be separately funded and will not reduce the settlement funds available to members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.\n\nThe release does not bar the injunctive relief claims or the declaratory relief claims that are a predicate for the injunctive relief claims asserted in the pending proposed Rule 23(b)(2) class action captioned Barry’s Cut Rate Stores, Inc., et. al. v. Visa, Inc., et al., MDL No. 1720, Docket No. 05-md-01720-MKB-JO (“Barry’s”). Injunctive relief claims are claims to prohibit or require certain conduct. They do not include claims for payment of money, such as damages, restitution, or disgorgement. As to all such claims for declaratory or injunctive relief in Barry’s, merchants will retain all rights pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which they have as a named representative plaintiff or absent class member in Barry’s, except that merchants remaining in the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class will release their right to initiate a new and separate action for the period up to five (5) years following the court’s approval of the settlement and the exhaustion of appeals.\n\nThe release also does not bar certain claims asserted in the class action captioned B&R Supermarket, Inc., et al. v. Visa, Inc., et al., No. 17-CV-02738 (E.D.N.Y.), or claims based on certain standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business.\n\nThe full text of the Release for the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class is set forth in Question 23. The Release describes the released claims in legal language. You should carefully read the Release and if you have questions about the Release you may:\n\nCall Rule 23(b)(3) Class Counsel listed in Question 16 at no charge.\n\nTalk to a lawyer, at your own expense, about the release and what it means to you.\n\nRead the complete Class Settlement Agreement and the complaints in the Barry’s, Nuts for Candy, and B&R Supermarket cases, which may be viewed here.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhat is the full text of the Release for the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class?\n\nFor the full release and all the terms of the Settlement, please review the Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement, available here.\n\n29.

In addition to the effect of the Rule 23(b)(3) Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment entered in accordance with this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement, including but not limited to any res judicata effect, and except as provided hereinafter in Paragraphs 34 and 37 below:\n\nThe Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties hereby expressly and irrevocably waive, and fully, finally, and forever settle, discharge, and release the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties from, any and all manner of claims, demands, actions, suits, and causes of action, whether individual, class, representative, parens patriae, or otherwise in nature, for damages, restitution, disgorgement, interest, costs, expenses, attorneys’ fees, fines, civil or other penalties, or other payment of money, or for injunctive, declaratory, or other equitable relief, whenever incurred, whether directly, indirectly, derivatively, or otherwise, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, in law or in equity, that any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party ever had, now has, or hereafter can, shall, or may have and that have accrued as of the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date or accrue no later than five years after the Settlement Final Date arising out of or relating to any conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party that are or have been alleged or otherwise raised in the Action, or that could have been alleged or raised in the Action relating to the subject matter thereof, or arising out of or relating to a continuation or continuing effect of any such conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act. For avoidance of doubt, this release shall extend to, but only to, the fullest extent permitted by federal law.\n\nIt is expressly agreed, for purposes of clarity, that any claims arising out of or relating to any of the following conduct, acts, transactions, events, occurrences, statements, omissions, or failures to act are claims that were or could have been alleged in this Action and relate to the subject matter thereof:\n\nany interchange fees, interchange rates, or any Rule of any Visa Defendant or Mastercard Defendant relating to interchange fees, interchange rates, or to the setting of interchange fees or interchange rates with respect to any Visa-Branded Card transactions in the United States or any Mastercard-Branded Card transactions in the United States;\n\nany Merchant Fee of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party relating to any Visa-Branded Card transactions in the United States or any Mastercard-Branded transactions in the United States;\n\nany actual or alleged “no surcharge” rules, “honor all cards” rules, “honor all issuers” rules, “honor all devices” rules, rules requiring the honoring of all credentials or accounts, “no minimum purchase” rules, “no discounting” rules, “non-discrimination” rules, “anti-steering” rules, Rules that limit merchants in favoring or steering customers to use certain payment systems, “all outlets” rules, “no bypass” rules, “no multi-issuer” rules, “no multi-bug” rules, routing rules, cross-border acquiring rules, card authentication or cardholder verification rules, “cardholder selection” rules or requirements, PAVD rules, rules or conduct relating to routing options regarding acceptance technology for mobile, e-commerce, or online payments, or development and implementation of tokenization standards;\n\nany reorganization, restructuring, initial or other public offering, or other corporate structuring of any Visa Defendant or Mastercard Defendant;\n\nany service of an employee or agent of any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party on any board or committee of any Visa Defendant or Mastercard Defendant; or\n\nany actual or alleged agreement (or alleged continued participation therein) (A) between or among any Visa Defendant and any Mastercard Defendant, (B) between or among any Visa Defendant or Mastercard Defendant and any other Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party or Parties, or (C) between or among any Defendant or Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party or Parties, relating to (i)-(v) above or to any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party’s imposition of, compliance with, or adherence to (i)-(v) above.\n\nFor purposes of clarity, references to the rules identified in this Paragraph 31 mean those rules as they are or were in place on or before the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date and rules in place thereafter that are substantially similar to those rules in place as of the Settlement Preliminary Approval Date.\n\n32. Each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party further expressly and irrevocably waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles and releases, any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party may have or that may be derived from the provisions of applicable law which, absent such waiver, may limit the extent or effect of the release contained in the preceding Paragraphs 29-31. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party expressly and irrevocably waives and releases any and all defenses, rights, and benefits that the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party might otherwise have in relation to the release by virtue of the provisions of California Civil Code Section 1542 or similar laws of any other state or jurisdiction. SECTION 1542 PROVIDES: “CERTAIN CLAIMS NOT AFFECTED BY GENERAL RELEASE. A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” In addition, although each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party may hereafter discover facts other than, different from, or in addition to those that it or he or she knows or believes to be true with respect to any claims released in the preceding Paragraphs 29-31, each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party hereby expressly waives, and fully, finally, and forever settles, discharges, and releases, any known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, contingent or non contingent claims within the scope of the preceding Paragraphs 29-31, whether or not concealed or hidden, and without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of such other, different, or additional facts. Rule 23(b)(3) Class Plaintiffs acknowledge, and the members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class shall be deemed by operation of the Rule 23(b)(3) Class Settlement Order and Final Judgment to have acknowledged, that the foregoing waiver was separately bargained for and is a key element of this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement.\n\n33. The release in Paragraphs 29-32 above does not bar an investigation or action, whether denominated as parens patriae, law enforcement, or regulatory, by a state, quasi-state, or local governmental entity to vindicate sovereign or quasi-sovereign interests. The release shall bar a claim brought by a state, quasi-state, or local governmental entity to the extent that such claim is based on a state, quasi-state, or local government entity’s proprietary interests as a member of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class that has received or is entitled to receive a financial recovery in this action. The release shall also bar a claim, whether denominated as seeking damages, restitution, unjust enrichment, or other monetary relief, brought by a state, quasi-state, or local governmental entity for monetary harm sustained by natural persons, businesses, other non-state, non-quasi-state, and non-local governmental entities or private parties who themselves are eligible to be members of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class.\n\n34. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraphs 29-33 above, the release in Paragraphs 29-33 above shall not release:\n\nA Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party’s continued participation, as a named representative or non-representative class member, in Barry’s Cut Rate Stores, Inc., et al. v. Visa, Inc., et al., MDL No. 1720 Docket No. 05-md-01720-MKB-JO (“Barry’s”), solely as to injunctive relief claims alleged in Barry’s. As to all such claims for injunctive relief in Barry’s, the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties retain all rights pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which they have as a named representative plaintiff or absent class member in Barry’s except the right to initiate a new separate action before five years after the Settlement Final Date. Nothing in this Paragraph shall be read to enlarge, restrict, conflict with, or affect the terms of any release or judgment to which any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party may become bound in Barry’s, and nothing in the release in Paragraphs 29-33 above shall be interpreted to enlarge, restrict, conflict with, or affect the request for injunctive relief that the plaintiffs in Barry’s may seek or obtain in Barry’s.\n\nAny claims asserted in B&R Supermarket, Inc., et al. v. Visa, Inc., et al., No. 17-CV-02738 (E.D.N.Y.), as of the date of the parties’ execution of this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement, that are based on allegations that payment card networks unlawfully agreed with one another to shift the liability of fraudulent payment card transactions from card-issuing financial institutions to merchants beginning in October 2015.\n\nAny claim of a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party that is based on standard commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of business under contracts or commercial relations regarding loans, lines of credit, or other related banking or credit relations, individual chargeback disputes, products liability, breach of warranty, misappropriation of cardholder data or invasion of privacy, compliance with technical specifications for a merchant’s acceptance of Visa-Branded Credit Cards or Debit Cards, or Mastercard-Branded Credit Cards or Debit Cards, and any other dispute arising out of a breach of any contract between any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties and any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties; provided, however, that Paragraphs 29-33 above and not this Paragraph shall control in the event that any such claim challenges the legality of interchange rules, interchange rates, or interchange fees, or any other Rule, fee, charge, or other conduct covered by any of the claims released in Paragraphs 29-33 above.\n\nClaims based only on an injury suffered as (i) a payment card network competitor of the Visa Defendants or the Mastercard Defendants, or (ii) an ATM operator that is not owned by, or directly or indirectly controlled by, one or more of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties.\n\n35. Except as provided above in Paragraph 34, upon the Settlement Final Approval Date each of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Parties agrees and covenants not to: (a) sue any of the Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Parties on the basis of any claim released in Paragraphs 29-33 above; (b) assist any third party in commencing or maintaining any private civil lawsuit against any Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party related in any way to any claim released in Paragraphs 29-33 above; or (c) take any action or make any claim until five years after the Settlement Final Date that as of or after the Settlement Final Approval Date a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Released Party has continued to participate in, and failed to withdraw from, any alleged unlawful horizontal conspiracies or agreements relating to the claims released in Paragraphs 29-33 above, which allegedly arise from or relate to the pre IPO structure or governance of any of the Visa Defendants or the pre IPO structure or governance of any of the Mastercard Defendants, or any Bank Defendant’s participation therein. For the avoidance of doubt, however, nothing in this Paragraph shall preclude a Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party from taking any action compelled by law or court order.\n\n36. Each Rule 23(b)(3) Settlement Class Releasing Party further releases each of the Visa Defendants, Mastercard Defendants, and Bank Defendants, and their counsel and experts in this Action, from any claims relating to the defense and conduct of this Action, including the negotiation and terms of the Definitive Class Settlement Agreement or this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement. Each Visa Defendant, Mastercard Defendant, and Bank Defendant releases the Rule 23(b)(3) Class Plaintiffs, the other plaintiffs in the Class Actions (except for the plaintiffs named in Barry’s), Rule 23(b)(3) Class Counsel, Rule 23(b)(3) Class Plaintiffs’ other counsel who have participated in any settlement conferences before the Court for a Class Plaintiff that executes this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement, and their respective experts in the Class Actions, from any claims relating to their institution or prosecution of the Class Actions, including the negotiation and terms of the Definitive Class Settlement Agreement or this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement, except for any claims relating to enforcement of this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement.\n\n37. In the event that this Superseding and Amended Class Settlement Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraphs 61-64, or any condition for the Settlement Final Approval Date is not satisfied, the release and covenant not to sue provisions of Paragraphs 29-36 above shall be null and void and unenforceable.\n\nBack to Top"
