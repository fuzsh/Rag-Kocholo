        "text": "This is a comprehensive list of all Article III and Article IV United States federal judges appointed by President Donald Trump as well as a partial list of Article I federal judicial appointments, excluding appointments to the District of Columbia judiciary.[1]\n\nThe total number of Trump Article III judgeship nominees to be confirmed by the United States Senate was 234, including three associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United States, 54 judges for the United States courts of appeals, 174 judges for the United States district courts, and three judges for the United States Court of International Trade. Trump did not make any recess appointments to the federal courts. Twelve circuit courts of appeals judges were confirmed during Trump's first year in office, which was then a record,[2] that has since been surpassed by his successor, Joe Biden[citation needed].\n\nIn terms of Article I courts, Trump made 26 appointments: 10 for the United States Court of Federal Claims, seven for the United States Tax Court, six for the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, two for the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, and one for the United States Court of Military Commission Review. Trump designated Susan G. Braden, Margaret M. Sweeney, and Eleni M. Roumel as chief judges of the Court of Federal Claims.\n\nOn the Article IV territorial courts, President Trump made one appointment.\n\nTrump with his first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.\n\nTrump with his second Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nTrump with his third Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\n\n[edit]\n\n# Justice Seat State Former justice Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Confirmation\n\nvote Began\n\nservice Ended\n\nservice 1 9 Colorado February 1, 2017 April 7, 2017 54–45[SC 1] April 8, 2017 Incumbent 2 1 Maryland July 10, 2018 October 6, 2018 50–48[SC 2][V 1] October 6, 2018 Incumbent 3 6 Indiana September 29, 2020 October 26, 2020 52–48[SC 3] October 26, 2020 Incumbent\n\nUnited States courts of appeals\n\n[edit]\n\n# Judge Circuit Nomination\n\ndate Confirmation\n\ndate Confirmation\n\nvote Began active\n\nservice Ended active\n\nservice Ended senior\n\nstatus 1 Sixth March 21, 2017 May 25, 2017 52–44[A 1] May 25, 2017 Incumbent – 2 Sixth May 8, 2017 July 20, 2017 51–47[A 2] July 21, 2017 Incumbent – 3 Eleventh May 8, 2017 August 1, 2017 66–31[A 3] August 2, 2017 Incumbent – 4 Eighth June 7, 2017 September 28, 2017 95–1[A 4] October 12, 2017 Incumbent – 5 Seventh May 8, 2017 October 31, 2017 55–43[A 5] November 2, 2017 October 26, 2020 Elevated 6 Sixth May 8, 2017 November 1, 2017 60–38[A 6] November 2, 2017 Incumbent – 7 Tenth June 7, 2017 November 2, 2017 56–41[A 7] November 3, 2017 Incumbent – 8 Third June 19, 2017 November 2, 2017 53–43[A 8] November 20, 2017 Incumbent – 9 D.C.
