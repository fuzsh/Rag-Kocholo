The Master Calendar now comprises two separate calendars: the first covering August 2024 through January 2025, and an archived calendar below it spanning September 2023 through July 2024. Additionally, we’ve updated the abbreviations for certain cases in the Key of Cases, specifically the DC 2020 Election Interference Case and the Georgia removal cases. These changes are reflected only in the new calendar.\n\nWe have also added new appeals to the Master Calendar. First, Trump’s classified documents case in Florida: On July 15, 2024, Judge Cannon granted Trump’s motion to dismiss the superseding indictment based on the alleged unlawful appointment and funding of Special Counsel Jack Smith. The government filed its notice of appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals two days later, and the briefing schedule is now set. Second, Mark Meadows has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari following the 11th Circuit’s decision to dismiss his bid to move his state criminal case in Georgia to federal court. Third, the defendants in the New York civil fraud case have filed appeals against Justice Engoron’s September 2023 summary judgment and his February 2024 final decision. The Appellate Division, First Department, has granted NY Attorney General Letitia James’s request to consolidate these appeals, which will now proceed with a single record and set of briefs. Fourth, defendants are appealing Judge McAfee’s order regarding their motions to disqualify DA Willis. Although each appellant has an individual case number and docket, all oral arguments will be heard together. The respective dockets (Case numbers A24A1595-A24A1602) can be accessed here.\n\nFinally, please note that during a period when the Master Calendar was not updated, additional briefing and other deadlines were set in several cases. Most of these deadlines are not reflected in either of the calendars below as they have either passed, been stayed, or are no longer applicable due to the cases being on appeal.\n\nTurning to the full calendar below, it is largely self-explanatory for readers who simply want to dive in.

Circuit Court of Appeals judgment that denied Trump’s presidential immunity argument and remanded the case to the D.C. Circuit. On the same day, the D.C. Circuit issued its formal mandate to the district court, with Judge Chutkan regaining jurisdiction over the case. As it stands, Chutkan has stayed deadlines for the government’s motion in limine and the defendant’s motion for a CIPA Section 6(a) hearing, and will set additional deadlines following the August 16 status conference.\n\nFor those who are checking our calendar frequently, and simply want to know what the most recent updates are since the prior version we published, those updates are listed below.
