        "text": "Between 2006 and 2014, Special Operations Group (SOG) personnel create, develop, and mentor the Judicial Security Unit (JSU) which is a specialized unit of the Afghan National Police. SOG expands the JSU into more than 1,000 officers who are responsible for the security of the Afghan Supreme Court, its Justices, and 13 other courthouses in Kabul. SOG's program advances court security and judicial protection into all 34 provinces in Afghanistan.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2009, the Special Operations Group (SOG) deploys personnel to Baghdad, Iraq to support the Regime Crimes Liaison Office and the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs. SOG personnel establish the first Central Criminal Court of Iraq, develop a protection force for the Iraqi Courts and play a critical role in the security and operation of the Iraqi High Tribunal during the prosecution of Saddam Hussein and his regime.\n\nWounded Knee, part of the Pine Ridge Reservation, is seized by followers of the American Indian Movement on February 27. U.S. Marshals Service volunteers from all ranks work toward a resolution. On May 8, after 10 weeks, U.S. Marshals take control of the situation. U.S. Marshal Lloyd Grimm (D/NE) and an FBI agent are wounded and two Native Americans die.\n\nRuby Bridges is escorted to her New Orleans elementary school on November 14 by Deputy U.S. Marshals who are called upon to help integrate the educational institutions of the city. The opposition to her entry and her protectors inspire artist Norman Rockwell to create an illustration, later becoming famous, entitled \"The Problem We All Live With,\" for Look magazine. In 2000, Ms. Bridges is appointed an honorary Deputy U.S. Marshal.\n\nTHE McDONOGH THREE\n\nIn addition to Ruby Bridges, three other girls: Gail Etienne, Tessie Prevost, and Leona Tate, were concurrently escorted to a separate school then known as McDonogh #19. At the time, it was believed that this school would receive more protestors. The old school has since been converted to a museum."
