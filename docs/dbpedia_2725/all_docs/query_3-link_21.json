We discover that despite his multiple offenses -- maybe 50 children over those years -- he is still working…\n\nDeliver Us From Evil is a documentary that portrays the story of a Catholic priest named Oliver O'Grady who was relocated to several parishes by the Catholic Church in an attempt to cover up his rape of dozens of children in the United States during the 70's. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary, Features, unfairly losing against An Inconvenient Truth (2006). However, justice will be served someday...\n\nIt's a literally impossible task to watch and subsequently review a documentary without letting one's personal feelings to be either totally or partially involved. This documentary does not provide mere entertainment. It essentially looks for a reaction from the audience, regardless of their religion or their atheistic beliefs. However,…"
