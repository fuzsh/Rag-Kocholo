She has been working in post-production in documentary film and television for over 10 years, with directors including Amy J. Berg, Cameron Crowe, Rory Kennedy, and Mikaela Shwer.\n\nHer editing credits include the Critics' Choice Award-winning documentary feature David Crosby: Remember My Name (Director A.J. Eaton). Producer Cameron Crowe has referred to it as \"the best editing experience I've ever been involved in,\" and Rolling Stone magazine called the film \"one of the best rock docs of all time.\"\n\nMost recently, Veronica was an editor on the feature documentary Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me for Apple TV+, directed by Alek Keshishian.\n\nVeronica is most drawn to intimate storytelling that focuses on mental health, resilience, and healing."
