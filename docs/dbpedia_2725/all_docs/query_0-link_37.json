        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe film chronicles O'Grady's years as a priest in Northern California, where he committed his crimes. After being convicted of child molestation and serving seven years in prison, O'Grady was deported to his native Ireland. Berg interviewed him there in 2005 for the film. Additionally, the film presents trial documents, videotaped depositions, and interviews with activists, theologians, psychologists, and lawyers; it suggests that Church officials were aware of O'Grady's crimes, and they took steps to conceal them to protect him and the church.\n\nReception\n\nThe Irish Independent criticized Berg for having filmed children in Ireland without the knowledge of them or their families.\n\nThe film was very well received by critics, earning a 100 percent \"Fresh\" critics rating from Rotten Tomatoes, achieving the status of the best-reviewed film of 2006.\n\nAftermath"
