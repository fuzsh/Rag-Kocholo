        "text": "On March 9, 2020, 48-year-old Corey Feldman, best known for his work as a child actor in films Stand by Me and The Goonies, will release a documentary titled My Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys.\n\nThe second ‘Corey’ refers to Corey Haim, who Feldman appeared alongside in 1987 film The Lost Boys. Feldman says it wasn’t long before Haim confided in him that he’d “allowed himself to be sodomised” on the set of the film Lucas.\n\nThe documentary, which will air just once at the same time worldwide via a global stream on March 9, will feature interviews with former co-stars of the Coreys, including Keith Coogan, Jamison Newlander, Susie Feldman, and the late Kristoff St John, speaking about the topic of child abuse in Hollywood.\n\n“I am able to say the names of who did what and the details of who did what,” Feldman confirmed about the film.\n\nMy Truth: The Rape of Two Coreys will be aired in a worldwide stream on March 9, 2020. Post continues below.\n\n“There is going to be people who are going to be very unhappy that this is coming out. People who want it silenced. Nothing can stop it at this point. That’s why we’re only showing it one time. We want to get it out. I’ve done my job, I’ve kept my promise.”\n\nBut this isn’t the first time Feldman has attempted to tell his story about an alleged pedophile ring operating in Hollywood.\n\nIn 2011, Gabe Hoffman and Matthew Valentinas approached director Amy J. Berg, a director known for her work exposing the systemic paedophilia in the Catholic Church, and asked if she would help them make a documentary exposing the sexual exploitation of young people in Hollywood.\n\nBerg told the story of five alleged victims, including Corey Feldman, in the documentary Open Secret which was released in 2014.\n\nFor her work on Deliver Us From Evil, a documentary film that exposed Catholic priest Oliver O’Grady, who molested and raped at least 25 children in Northern California, Berg received an Oscar nomination.\n\nFor an Open Secret, she couldn’t even find a distributor.\n\nIt was rejected from a number of film festivals, dubbed “the film Hollywood doesn’t want you to see”.\n\nThe team uncovered evidence of a paedophile ring in Hollywood, which included managers, agents, publicists and directors.\n\nMost of the film focuses on Marc Collins-Rector, a co-owner of Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), who preyed on young boys and teenagers. He has subsequently been convicted of child sexual abuse.\n\nChild actor Evan Henzi appears in the documentary, telling of how at 11 years old, his manager Martin Weiss began assaulting him. In 2012, Weiss pleaded no contest to two counts of child molestation.\n\nThe documentary also features an interview with Vanity Fair journalist John Connolly, who states that an article investigating pedophilia in Hollywood was due to be published in Details magazine, but was dropped at the last minute.\n\nFlavorwire commended the “quietly horrifying” film, which “details the trauma and the abuse of power inflicted on young men with stars in their eyes”.\n\nYou can watch Open Secret online for free, right here.\n\nIn an interview in May of 2016, Feldman told The Hollywood Reporter that predators within the industry “groom” their victims, who are passed “back and forth” between them.\n\nFeldman claims he was molested by multiple older men, and his friend, Corey Haim, was raped at the age of 11. In 2010, Haim died from pneumonia, stemming from a lengthy battle with drug addiction.\n\nIn 2013, Feldman discussed his alleged abuse on US daytime television program, The View.\n\n“I’m saying that the people who did this to both me and Corey are still working… that they are still out there… and they’re some of the richest most powerful people in this business,” Feldman said to an aghast Barbara Walters.\n\n“Are you saying that they’re paedophiles and they’re still in this business?” she asked.\n\n“Yes,” he responded.\n\nWalters held her hand to her head, sighing, before Feldman continued, “Be careful what you wish for… that’s what I’ll tell you… don’t go into it with naivety…”\n\nAlthough Feldman was also friends with accused sex offender Michael Jackson when he was young, he says the pop star didn’t abuse him.\n\nSpeaking to Rolling Stone in April 2019, Feldman said he believed he could bring down a paedophile ring that he had been aware of since he was a child.\n\n\"Right off the bat, I can name six names, one of them who is still very powerful today. [It’s] a story that links all the way up to a studio [and] connects paedophilia to one of the major studios,\" he said.\n\nFeldman is hardly the only person to advance these allegations.\n\nIn 2016, actor Elijah Wood told The Sunday Times that, \"organised sexual abuse of children in Hollywood is rife\".\n\nMuch like the case of Harvey Weinstein, many young men claim that child sexual abuse is, like the title of the documentary suggests, \"an open secret\".\n\nRead more:\n\nIf you think you may be experiencing depression or another mental health problem, please contact your general practitioner or in Australia, contact Lifeline 13 11 14 for support or beyondblue 1300 22 4636.\n\nIf this post brings up any issues for you, or if you just feel like you need to speak to someone, please call 1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732) – the national sexual assault, domestic and family violence counselling service.
