        "text": "A visit years in the making, AIDC is thrilled to welcome the award-winning bad-ass feminist and queen of the true crime documentary, Amy J. Berg, in 2020.\n\nDescribed by the Guardian as “the documentarian to fear”, her passion for truth and justice makes her one of the most interesting and relevant directors of our time. She also loves dogs!\n\nIn addition to her own incredible oeuvre, Berg’s impressive repertoire of A-list collaborations makes her a fitting guest for AIDC’s year of collective intelligence.\n\nTo give you a primer for her AIDC appearance, we’ve created a list of films to introduce (or refresh) you and help kill off those long summer days as you wait in anticipation for AIDC 2020.\n\nThe Case Against Adnan Syed\n\nIn 2014, Sarah Koenig changed podcasting forever with the release of the widely successful first season of Serial, raising questions around the conviction of Adnan Syed in the murder of his girlfriend. In 2019, Berg worked with Koenig to bring the podcast to the screen, exploring additional theories and evidence in the lead-up to a new appeal. Nominated for an Emmy Award earlier this year, this four-part series is a must-see for lovers of true crime.\n\nWatch on Google Play"
