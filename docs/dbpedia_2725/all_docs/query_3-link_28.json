Understanding the Complex\n\nIn the context of the film \"Every Secret Thing\" by Amy Berg, the concept of a complex is particularly relevant in understanding the behavior and motivations of the characters. In psychology, a complex is a core pattern of emotions, memories, perceptions, and wishes in the personal unconscious organized around a common theme, such as power or inferiority. There are various types of complexes, including the Oedipus complex, Electra complex, and inferiority complex, each of which can manifest in different ways and influence individual thoughts and behaviors.

By understanding the different types of complexes and how they operate, viewers can gain insight into the underlying psychological dynamics at play in the story.

In essence, understanding the complex enriches the viewing experience by illuminating the hidden psychological forces at work in the film, adding depth and dimension to the characters and their relationships.\n\n2.1. Definition and Types of Complexes in Psychology\n\nA complex in psychology refers to a pattern of emotions, memories, perceptions, and wishes that are organized around a common theme. These themes can stem from early experiences, societal influences, or cultural conditioning. Complexes can be both conscious and unconscious, and they often shape an individual's behavior, thoughts, and emotions. There are various types of complexes, including inferiority complexes, Oedipus complexes, hero complexes, and mother complexes, to name a few. An inferiority complex, for example, is characterized by feelings of inadequacy and a lack of self-worth. This type of complex can lead individuals to overcompensate in certain areas of their lives or develop defensive mechanisms to protect their fragile self-esteem. On the other hand, an Oedipus complex involves unresolved feelings for one's opposite-sex parent and feelings of rivalry with the same-sex parent. This complex was famously introduced by Sigmund Freud and is said to influence an individual's romantic relationships and attitudes towards authority figures. Hero complexes, on the other hand, involve an inflated sense of self-importance and a desire for admiration, while mother complexes stem from unresolved feelings towards one's mother and can impact one's relationships and sense of identity. Understanding these different types of complexes is crucial in the field of psychology, as it allows for a deeper understanding of human behavior and the underlying factors that drive it.\n\n3.
