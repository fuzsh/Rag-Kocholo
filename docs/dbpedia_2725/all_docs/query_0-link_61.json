        "text": "Recent years have seen a number of lawsuits and investigations into the sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests. While these investigations may have been quite small to begin with, the publicity surrounding them has been so intense that it has encouraged other abuse survivors to come forward and with each revelation of clerical abuse comes more lawsuits, more investigations, more publicity and more abuse survivors coming forward. The ensuing snowball effect has been so drastic that it has effectively transformed a minor embarrassment to one of humanity’s oldest institutions into something of the order of an existential threat: How can the Catholic Church continue to claim moral authority when it has used that authority to protect men who rape children? As the scandal has grown, it has inspired a number of fictional and documentary films including this one by Alex Gibney, the Oscar-winning director of Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room and Taxi to the Dark Side.\n\nMuch like Kirby Dick’s Twist of Faith and Amy J. Berg’s Deliver Us From Evil, Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God begins with a small scandal. In this case the scandal involves the priest in charge of an American school for the deaf who used his position to molest the boys in his care. Grounding himself in a series of often incredibly moving interviews with the priest’s victims, Gibney follows the scandal up the Church hierarchy from priest to monsignor, monsignor to bishop, bishop to cardinal and finally all the way to the Pope himself. Indeed, one of the things that distinguishes Gibney’s film from those of Dick and Berg is that while all three films suggest that the Catholic Church shielded priests from prosecution in an attempt to protect the Church’s reputation, Gibney argues that this practice had been a matter of deliberate policy since the 19th Century and that this policy continued under the direct authority of the man who would become the recently-retired Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nSomewhat disappointingly, while Gibney makes much stronger claims than many of his fellow filmmakers, his analysis is more concerned with attributing blame than with understanding the processes at work. For example, Berg’s Deliver Us From Evil places the rape and molestation of 25 Irish children in the wider context of Church culture and how that culture not only encourages people to turn a blind eye to rape but also some decidedly toxic attitudes towards homosexuality and women. Though Mea Maxima Culpa does touch on the issue of Church Culture and allows one talking head to suggest that there might well be something about the Church that actively encourages the recruitment and promotion of sexual predators, Gibney’s interest is obviously elsewhere and so the film simply raises the idea of a connection and then promptly moves on. This lack of deeper analysis is rather unfortunate as the number of films about this particular topic mean that there is a sense of déjà vu about a lot of the material that Gibney covers. As cold as it may sound, there are only so many films you can make about abuse survivors seeking justice from an indifferent and hypocritical bureaucracy before something new needs adding to the mix.\n\nWhat Gibney does bring to the mix is the idea of building the film around a series of interviews with deaf people. One of the film’s more disturbing motifs is that the abusive priest got away with raping and molesting deaf children because their frequently non-deaf parents struggled to communicate with them."
