        "text": "Nick and Warren wrote an original score for West of Memphis, a 2012 documentary film produced by Peter Jackson and Damien Echols, and directed by Academy Award nominated filmmaker Amy J. Berg.\n\nThe film is a documentary produced in collaboration with the multiple Academy Award winning team of Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh, and tells the untold story behind an extraordinary and desperate fight to bring the truth to light; a fight to stop the State of Arkansas from killing an innocent man. Starting with a searing examination of the police investigation into the 1993 murders of three 8 year old boys in the small town of West Memphis, Arkansas, the film goes on to uncover new evidence surrounding the arrest and conviction of the other three victims of this shocking crime – Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley. All three were teenagers when they became the target of the police investigation; all three went on to lose 18 years of their lives – imprisoned for crimes they did not commit."
