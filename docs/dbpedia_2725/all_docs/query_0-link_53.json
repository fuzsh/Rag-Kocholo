        "text": "Nothing is creepier than creepy children and teenagers, and the ones in “Every Secret Thing” are first-rate examples. The story may be fictional — it’s based on a Laura Lippman novel — but by the end of this movie you’ll be warier than ever of the local youngsters.\n\nRonnie (Dakota Fanning) and Alice (Danielle Macdonald) enter the juvenile prison system as young girls after kidnapping and somewhat inadvertently killing a baby. They are released at 18 and return to their hometown, and soon another baby disappears. The authorities (Elizabeth Banks and Nate Parker play the lead detectives) don’t have to look too hard for suspects, but determining just who, if anyone, is guilty, and of what crime, is a tangle not easily unraveled."
