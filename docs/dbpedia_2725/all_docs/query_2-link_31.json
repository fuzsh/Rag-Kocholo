        "text": "Former Nickelodeon writer Amy Berg slammed her ex-boss Dan Schneider as a “psychological tormenter” following the release of the bombshell documentary “Quiet on Set.”\n\nBerg, who served as Schneider’s assistant before he left for UPN, said she worked with him for less than a year, but it was enough to know he was “f–king a–hole.”\n\n“During my year with Dan, I wasn’t aware of any physically inappropriate behavior,” she began her lengthy statement shared on X early Monday.\n\n“What I can confirm, however, is that he was a f–king a–hole. A psychological tormenter. He introduced me to panic attacks and the stress of working for him caused me to develop a significant heart arrhythmia.”\n\nBerg revealed she had to undergo surgery to fix the issue, but at that point she had “lost all of” her 20s.\n\n“He stole these years from me,” she wrote.\n\nAlthough Berg went on to write for hit Nick shows such as “Kenan & Kel” and “All That” under the leadership of “extraordinary humans” Kevin Kopelow and Heath Seifert, she claimed Schneider, 58, ruined her personal life.\n\n“I became a shut-in due to the fear of having a medical crisis away from home. I was unable to cultivate relationships or nurture friendships,” she shared.\n\n“And to this day I carry with me an anxiety disorder that fiercely rears its head when faced with other manipulators.”\n\nBerg concluded her statement by saying she would not watch “Quiet on Set,” which aired Sunday on Investigation Discovery and Max and continues Monday, because she not only has “no interest” in reliving her experiences but she also does not “want to be in a situation” where she would “feel inclined to defend Dan in any way.”\n\nA spokesperson for Schneider tells Page Six that the Nickelodeon king is “truly sorry” for negative experiences he created for his staff.\n\n“Dan expected and asked a lot from his teams. They worked long hours and consistently made successful shows. In the challenges of production, Dan could get frustrated at times, and he understands why some employees found that intimidating and stressful,” the rep explains, adding that “many” of the people he worked with “still tell him” how much they enjoyed his shows.\n\n“But he also knows some people did not have a positive experience, and he is truly sorry for that. Dan knows he should have done better and feels awful about anyone who saw him at his worst, instead of his best.”\n\nKnown for hits such as “Good Burger,” “Zoey 101, “Victorious” and more, Schneider has come under fire in recent years as his former stars leveled accusations of sexual harassment against him.\n\nThe famed children’s network abruptly cut ties with Schneider in 2018 after 25 years so he could “pursue other opportunities and projects” amid reports he was “under a cloud of suspicion over the treatment of some younger stars of his shows.”\n\nPage Six broke the news at the time that he walked away with a $7 million payout.\n\n“Zoey 101” alum Alexa Nikolas claimed in 2022 that Schneider sat in a fitting room as she changed her clothes.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\n“Whenever I had wardrobe fittings, [Schneider] always had to be in them,” she said on “Real Pod.”\n\n“Thank God there was a curtain, but he was literally [sitting] on [a] chair right outside of the curtain.”\n\n“Zoey 101” star Jamie Lynn Spears, meanwhile, glossed over the scandal in her memoir.\n\nSocial media users also previously have highlighted Schneider’s strange tendency to tweet pictures of his young female stars’ feet. He also shared seemingly inappropriate videos of his actresses, including one of Ariana Grande as a teen in a skimpy outfit dousing herself with water.\n\nGrande’s rep never responded to Page Six for comment on the image."
