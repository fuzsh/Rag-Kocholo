        "text": "An Open Secret is a 2014 American documentary film directed by Amy J. Berg exposing child sexual abuse in the film and tv industry in California, starting as early as the 1980’s.\n\nRelease[]\n\nAn Open Secret premiered on November 14, 2014 at Doc NYC. It screened at Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2015, and began a limited theatrical release in the United States on June 5 of that year.Producers were encouraged about its commercial potential because a pirated version was viewed 900,000 times. However, the film received no television deal or video-on-demand distribution. According to Gabe Hoffman, who financed the film: \"We got zero Hollywood offers to distribute the film. Not even one. Literally no offers for any price whatsoever.\"\n\nOn October 12, 2017, Hoffman and Valentinas released the film for nine days on Vimeo \"to commemorate serial predator Harvey Weinstein finally being exposed.\" It went viral, and free viewing was then extended for a longer period due to the interest shown in the film, with over three million viewings garnered on various social media platforms in the first two weeks.\n\nAt the time of its Vimeo release, the producers said they were seeking further distribution of the documentary. It has not been released to home video, but can be found on YouTube."
