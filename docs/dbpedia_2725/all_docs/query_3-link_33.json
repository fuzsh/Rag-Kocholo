        "text": "An Open Secret, Amy Berg‘s controversial documentary about the sexual abuse of minors in Hollywood, has secured a theatrical release and will begin a 20-city run in the U.S. on June 5, beginning in Denver and Seattle.\n\nThe film also will make its market premiere at the upcoming Cannes Film Market, where it will screen for the first time for international buyers.\n\nEsponda Productions and Disarming Films are joining forces with Vesuvio Entertainment and Rocky Mountain Pictures to bring the the film to both U.S. audiences and the international market.\n\nBerg’s film, which paints a broad picture of sexual abuse in the entertainment industry, touches on the 2014 allegations that Michael Egan III made against prominent Hollywood figures. Egan subsequently withdraw the lawsuits he had filed. The movie premiered at New York Doc Fest last November, but given its highly charged subject matter, the prospects for its theatrical release did not seem guaranteed at the time.\n\nThe film was executive produced by Gabe Hoffman and Matthew Valentinas, who, after hearing account of sex abuse in Hollywood, turned to Disarming Films’ Berg, an Oscar nominee for Deliver Us from Evil, which looked at sex abuse in the Catholic church.\n\n“This is clearly one of the most controversial and most important films of 2015, and sheds light on one of the dirtiest secrets in Hollywood,” said Greg H. Sims, CEO of Vesuvio Entertainment, which will distribute the film in partnership with Rocky Mountain Pictures."
