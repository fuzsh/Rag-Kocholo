        "text": "We, the sisters of Mary Morning Star, are an international contemplative community. We live at the former Franciscan Friary in the center of Waterford city. At present, we pray in a small oratory in the convent which is too small for us to be able to welcome others. For this reason we are beginning building works to transform part of the friary into a larger chapel, so that people can come to join us for prayer. This will be a chapel for daily adoration, Mass and the singing of Godâ€™s praises in the Divine Office.\n\nNovena to St Therese of Lisieux\n\nWe would like to place this fundraising appeal under the patronage of St Therese. We hope that in the nine days before her feast (on the 1st of October) we could raise the 25,000 euro that we still need to complete the building works. Please join us in praying for her intercession and if you can give a little to help us we would be so grateful! We keep you in our prayers!\n\nTo donate, and obtain further information, please click HERE\n\nThank you for supporting contemplative life in Ireland!\n\nFor more about our community please visit :mariastellamatutina.org"
