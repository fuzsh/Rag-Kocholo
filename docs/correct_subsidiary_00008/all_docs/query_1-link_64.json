        "text": "538’s pollster ratings are calculated by analyzing the historical accuracy and methodological transparency of each polling organization’s polls. We define accuracy as the average adjusted error and bias of a pollster’s surveys. Error and bias scores are adjusted for polls’ sample sizes, how far before the election they were conducted, the type of election polled, the polls’ performance relative to other polls surveying the same race and other factors. Transparency Scores are based on our accounting of how much information organizations release about how each of their polls were conducted.

Elliott Morris. Transparency Score initially developed by Mark Blumenthal. Quantitative editing by Holly Fuong. Story editing by Nathaniel Rakich. Copy editing by Alex Kimball."
