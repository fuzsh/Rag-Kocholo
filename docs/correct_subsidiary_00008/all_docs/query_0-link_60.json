        "text": "St. Jude Children's Research Hospital\n\nThe Hub Intranet Redesign\n\nSt. Jude’s revamped intranet helps frontline heroes find the info they need faster\n\nSt. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s mission is to cure childhood cancer, and achieving that goal requires a workforce equipped with the tools, resources, information and community to keep them thriving and saving lives. For its ambitious intranet overhaul, St. Jude has earned the Grand Prize for Best Overall Intranet in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nFacing a cluttered intranet with over 6,800 pages and frustrated employees, St. Jude’s communications team embarked on an eight-month overhaul project shaped by user needs and employee feedback.\n\nTheir goals were to create “a digital workplace that is user-friendly, with features that enhance productivity, encourage collaboration, patient care, basic science laboratory research and administrative services.”\n\nThe result was the St. Jude Hub. The changes included:\n\nReducing page count by 82%, meaning employees spent less time sifting through outdated content and more time focusing on their critical roles in fighting childhood cancer.\n\nAn improved search function with intuitive filters, allowing employees to quickly find the information they need. As a result, employees spend an average of 41 seconds less browsing search result pages than they did before the change.\n\nA customizable experience that allows employees to mark favorite pages and save important documents, forms and links for quick access.\n\nA responsive mobile experience that is available as a native Microsoft Teams application, which helps frontline workers access the Hub on the go.\n\nThe “St. Jude Today” daily digest, which keeps employees informed about upcoming events, campus news and employee achievements.\n\nAn internal “phonebook,” which allows for easy colleague and department searches. It has seen significant usage since its launch.\n\nSince launch, the hub has seen a user adoption rate of 99.5%, with more than 40,000 daily page views.\n\nThe hub is not just a repository of information, though – it’s a powerful tool that empowers employees, fosters collaboration and strengthens the fight against childhood cancer. Congratulations to the team for developing this award-winning experience.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nMagenta Giving 2023\n\nT-Mobile unites employees and makes a splash with ‘Magenta Giving’ campaign\n\nT-Mobile’s “Magenta Giving” campaign aimed to foster a sense of pride and connection among T-Mobile employees while aiding communities across the U.S. This communications initiative has earned the Grand Prize for Employee Communication Campaign of the Year in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nThree years after a major merger and following the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the communications team at T-Mobile needed to create a sense of unity among its employees. Launched in April 2023, “Magenta Giving” reinforced T-Mobile’s culture and provided a platform for employees to connect with their passions and communities.\n\nFor employees in main offices, in-person volunteers were encouraged to join events aimed at addressing hunger, educational equity and the environment. Participants packed meals for Harvesters, an organization that seeks to improve access to nutritious food; planted trees at Farmer Frog, which cultivates community gardens in underserved neighborhoods; and assembled kits for students at City Year, which prepares students in underserved schools for graduation, college and their careers. Leaders in T-Mobile’s different locations connected with similar local activities such as donation drives and volunteer events.\n\nTo encourage participation, the communications team developed regular emails with video messages from leadership, informative intranet content, a dedicated “Magenta Giving” landing page, social media updates on Slack and digital signage placed across the country.\n\nAdditional facets of the campaign included:\n\nGiving accounts and matching: T-Mobile Foundation seeded employee giving accounts with $23 each and doubled volunteered hours with a $20 per hour match.\n\nEducational webcasts: Sessions about T-Mobile’s philanthropic partners, such as Project 10Million and Welcome.US, educated employees about making a difference.\n\n“Magenta Giving” champions: These designated employees within each team promoted ways to give, generated excitement and encouraged participation.\n\nAs a result, T-Mobile employees and the organization’s matching donated over $1.9 million to 7,041 nonprofits, surpassing the campaign’s goals. Employees spent more than 16,000 hours volunteering and serving their local communities. The campaign was met with overwhelmingly positive feedback, with 95% of employees surveyed wanting to participate again next year.\n\nAnd it isn’t over: After a successful inaugural year, “Magenta Giving” is shaping up to become a tradition at T-Mobile.\n\nCongratulations to T-Mobile’s communications team for leading this initiative.\n\nGenesys\n\nComms Driving Company Strategy\n\nGenesys’ workforce ‘flies in formation’ around the world\n\nGenesys’ dedicated employee communications team has been recognized with the Grand Prize for Employee Communications Team of the Year in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards due to its creative approach in aligning a globally dispersed workforce with the company’s vision.\n\nIn this post-pandemic world, 95% of Genesys’ 6,500 employees continue to work remotely across over 50 countries, making a sense of community and a universal understanding of the company’s strategy, purpose and values critical for success. Genesys’ seven-person communications team, with three internal communications specialists and four executive leads, stepped up to connect this dispersed employee population.\n\nThey drew upon Genesys’ core value concept — “Fly in formation” — to develop an education campaign, events, a content plan and an engagement strategy.\n\nIn January, they launched an all-employee education campaign, ensuring everyone understood the upcoming fiscal year’s strategy. This included distributing the CEO’s vision statement and a one-page plan outline, followed by a comprehension test and contests to incentivize listening and understanding.\n\nA kickoff event included keynotes from the CEO, who shared the vision; the chief product officer, who showcased technology leadership; and the chief customer officer, who highlighted customer wins.\n\nThe team deployed messaging to support the mission across its intranet, called One Genesys, in addition to a weekly newsletter, quarterly company all-hands meetings and executive communications that emphasized driving growth, customer success, technology innovation, sustainability and key performance metrics.\n\nMeanwhile, to unify leaders and provide them with clarity on the company’s direction, the communications team provided a private communication platform and coordinated regular meetings with the CEO for people of VP titles and higher. They tapped these leaders for employee spotlights to build appreciation and a sense of human connection.\n\nEmployee engagement initiatives included an April Fool’s Day email prank from the chief product officer, a virtual party celebrating the One Genesys Portal’s second birthday with surprise appearances by social media stars, a “Genesys Got Talent” competition and employee photo albums capturing company events.\n\nAs a result of their efforts, surveys show 92% of employees understand the company’s future plans, and 90% feel informed about goals and priorities. Quarterly all-hands meetings achieve an average of 4,000 attendees and a high satisfaction score, the One Genesys portal has an 80% monthly readership, and the weekly newsletter has a 69% open rate.\n\nCongratulations to the Genesys communications team for their efforts in helping the workforce feel informed, connected and empowered to contribute to the company’s success.\n\nThe Leukemia & Lymphoma Society\n\nCommunications\n\nHow the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society ushered in a new era\n\nWhen president and CEO Louis J. DeGennaro retired after 18 years at the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS), the organization needed to build trust in its new CEO, E. Anders Kolb, board of directors, and executive and leadership teams. Its ability to reassure and establish a rapport among employees, patients and their families, volunteers, donors, partners and more is the reason it’s being recognized in the Alignment with External Communications category in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nA mixternal communications plan began in early 2023, as LLS shared the name of its new president and CEO with employees, patients, volunteers, supports and external constituents on March 8, a few months before his May 1 start date. Part of that included showing how DeGennaro would stay on in an advisory role for two months until his retirement on June 30.\n\nThis initial phase ensured that employees and constituents understood the selection process for identifying the new CEO and his new vision.\n\nIn announcing Kolb internally, LLS created a post on its intranet and a teaser email that gave staff a heads-up before a live webinar. Their first time “meeting” him was through a showing of an Oprah-style fireside chat with a board of directors member in the webinar, which Kolb and DeGennaro both joined to show a united front.\n\nExternally, constituents were notified with targeted emails or phone calls directly, plus the announcement was shared as a news release and across social channels. An edited-down version of the fireside chat video was also shared.\n\nAfter Kolb completed his first 100 days, the team followed up with his achievements and opportunities to elevate him through interviews.\n\nThe response, both internally and externally, exceeded expectations for the LLS team, including:\n\nThe internal “Meet Our New President and CEO” email received 800 opens. The LLS has around 1,000 employees.\n\nA news release blog post on the site saw around 5,000 pageviews.\n\nA “My First 100 Days” post had 964% more viewership than other blog posts.\n\nKolb’s LinkedIn went from 16 to 594 followers in two months.\n\nEarned media surrounding the change received over 76 million impressions.\n\nCongratulations to the team for the way it handled the transition.\n\nProvidence\n\nProvidence Annual Report to Our Communities\n\nProvidence’s annual report spotlights its highs in detail\n\nThe Providence Annual Report to Our Communities highlighted its record-breaking $2.1 billion investment in community benefit, showing how it’s strengthening the communities it serves. This effort has earned it recognition in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Annual Reports category.\n\nThe annual report tells community impact stories about the caregivers and partners who brought hope to those in need, upholding Providence’s charitable mission. It focuses on four areas of how the organization is creating healthier communities: foundations of health, removing barriers to care, promoting community resilience and innovating for the future.\n\nTouched by many departments and teams across the organization, they collaborated to plan the launch, socialization and promotion of the annual report, ultimately driving traffic back to its website. Through a unified narrative on the community benefit programs, investments and initiatives around meeting the diverse needs of those it serves, the content is targeted based on audience and location.\n\nThe campaign included 31 written stories that showed the impact of investments on its communities, three long-form videos, 10 short-form videos for social media distribution, 14 internal newsletters and inclusion in patient newsletters, a social media campaign for sharing all the assets, infographics and more.\n\nThese efforts yielded successful results, such as:\n\nThe annual report site received over 1,700 caregiver visits between June 2023 and August 2023, with an additional over 12,700 public visits.\n\nArticles reached more than 59,000 caregivers, with almost 5,000 engaging further.\n\nEarned media reached more than 10 million readers.\n\nPhotos and video assets on social media drove more than 2 million impressions, almost 450,000 video views and nearly 5,000 engagements.\n\nThis was the first time the Providence communications team came together to design the annual report on this scale. Still, the results established a level of success for the team to aspire toward in future efforts.\n\nCongratulations to the Providence team on this top-notch report.\n\nDiscover Financial Services\n\nInclusions Matters\n\nDiscover’s commitment to DE&I is setting an industry standard\n\nBy sharing stories of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), Discover Financial Services commits to what it sees as its responsibility to create a culture where differences are valued and respected, which is why it’s being recognized as part of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Article Series category.\n\nDiscover shared honest, vulnerable personal stories of individuals across the company in a monthly message series, emphasizing its belief that people should feel valued, like they belong, and free to be themselves. According to its nomination form, the company hoped to expand and influence an understanding of why DE&I is so important to our culture.\n\nThe name Discover chose to represent this series was Inclusion Matters.\n\nTo start, Discover worked closely with DE&I partners and employee resource group (ERG) leaders to identify employees whose stories to tell. From there, it wanted to handle telling the stories in a unique way, going beyond an interview that may obscure the authenticity and voice of the storyteller. By sharing nine questions with each person, they got guidelines to follow but could still tell their own stories in their own way without it coming across as an interpretation of their tale.\n\nSince the company wanted to turn this into a series, it determined that a steady cadence of employee stories was the best approach. A story appeared on its intranet on the third Wednesday of every month and was amplified through internal emails, ERG pages, companywide announcements and digital monitors in its various locations.\n\nThe impact of these DE&I-focused stories was further driven home by ensuring an understanding of signature months and celebrating stories that aligned with those themes, such as sharing a story of an employee who was the child of a transgender woman during Pride Month.\n\nSo far, the series has been the most popular messages delivered internally, with the nine messages shared through September 2023 having been viewed more than 141,000 times. Through its Viva Engage platform or intranet, these stories have an average of over 6,200 views and have received almost 3,000 likes and 645 comments of encouragement. Through August 2023, an engagement index of 60.04 was seen.\n\nThese stories have resonated with the Discover team on a deep level, showing the success of this initiative and providing a sense of value and freedom to be themselves for employees.\n\nCongratulations to the Discover communications team for this powerful initiative.\n\nSonic Automotive, Inc.\n\nInternal Communications for the Launch of Gympass, an Employee Well-being Application\n\nHow Sonic Automotive supported employee wellbeing\n\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, local dealership leaders and human resources partners gave feedback about an increased desire to prioritize employee wellbeing at Sonic Automotive, Inc. By shining a spotlight on its Be Healthy principle in such a way. It is being honored for its efforts in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Benefits Communication category.\n\nTo bring this plan to fruition, Sonic Automotive created a platform through Gympass, tasking the communications team with becoming experts on the platform so they could relay it to the company’s more than 10,000 employees and encourage them to engage with it. The company had a goal of getting 3-5% of activations (300-500 employee accounts) within the first six months. The plan was to launch Gympass on April 10.\n\nOnce it was decided to use Gympass to achieve the goals of its Be Healthy campaign, the team had two months to formulate a communications plan. This began with utilizing any and every communications channel available to inform employees about the platform, including email, an internal application called Workplace by Meta, physical materials and digital outreach. Internal culture committee ambassadors called the Connections Team, also disseminated information. For instance, posters were sent to each location with information about the platform and a QR code, and digital screensavers were deployed to all company devices on April 1.\n\nOnce it went live, an email and Workplace post was sent to all employees in addition to communications directly from Gympass. On April 13, employees were reminded of the platform through a town hall hosted on Workplace, with subsequent posts shared in the first month. After about a month, a live Q&A was held in Workplace with Gympass’ customer support team to answer employee questions.\n\nAlong with the platform, Sonic Automotive also created its first-ever employee resource group, Well @ Work, to help support employees’ physical, mental and financial wellbeing.\n\nDuring the two-month period of promoting Gympass, the 15 Workplace posts saw over 3,300 total views and 974 unique views, which ended up being about 18% of the total Workplace user base and 64% of monthly active users. Additionally, the company received positive testimonials from employees.\n\nAs of June, there had been 3,430 member downloads of the application, approximately 31% of invited users. They also saw 2,849 gym check-ins across 159 gyms and 113 cities, far surpassing its initial 300-500 enrolled user goal.\n\nCongratulations to Sonic Automotive for accelerating its commitment to wellbeing.\n\nBusinessolver\n\nWorkspace Anywhere\n\nBusinnessolver found a lasting solution during an unprecedented time\n\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic first began in 2020, Businessolver confronted challenges that most businesses faced: maintaining a productive — and healthy — workplace for employees. That’s why the company shifted to a fully remote model through its Workspace Anywhere policy, which has landed it a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Best Remote Work Experience/Culture category.\n\nIn the three years since it first implemented the policy, it has expanded its talent outreach to all 50 states rather than only being confined to the metropolitan areas near its offices. It now has more than 1,500 full-time employees based in 42 states.\n\nIn implementing its remote-only strategies in 2020, the company checked in weekly via virtual employee communications and with Employee Pulse surveys. Pre-pandemic saw 85% of pulses at blue or green (feeling happy and productive in their roles), compared to 90% today.\n\nAnother way the organization has helped make the transition seamless for its employees was by getting in on yet another pandemic-era trend: implementing AI to create transcripts of member calls to help its member services team better serve members. Plus, its AI assistant, Sofia, can work directly with members to help them better understand their coverage and the platform. This “Tech with Heart” approach allows the company to ensure clients have a level playing field to access coverage and wellness options.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in transitioning to a fully remote workplace was building a more transparent and communicative environment. This included weekly debriefs through its What’s Goin’ On internal communications and the daily Businessolver Way, team standups and e-learning modules and more individual communications, like one-on-ones with managers.\n\nThe business finalized its transition in March 2020 and has seen only positive results since. This includes employee engagement improving by 5% between 2020 and 2021, more than 86% of the team feeling supported by the company and that it promotes wellbeing and over 97% sharing that they feel productive working remotely.\n\nClearly, the team is aligned with this new business model.\n\nCongratulations to Businessolver for taking RTO to the next level.\n\nCisco (We Are Cisco)\n\nWe Are Cisco Blog\n\nCisco’s blog is all about building connections\n\nThe We Are Cisco blog prioritizes storytelling to connect the world with its employees by crafting personal connections and sharing employee-generated content through a #WeAreCisco social campaign. In doing so, it’s been honored in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Blog category.\n\nBeyond just offering glimpses into life at Cisco, the blog also hosts an annual #LoveWhereYouWork contest where employees post on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn and the internal Webex Space to share why they love their jobs. Winning submissions are then awarded prizes over the span of weeks.\n\nSince the blog doesn’t focus on any single topic, it highlights a range of Cisco employee experiences: a sense of belonging within its Inclusive Communities, internships, opportunities to give back and career growth.\n\nThe team identifies whether a story is a good fit for the blog and then fosters a relationship with that employee so it can be shared with a larger audience. The Cisco team provides guidelines but ensures that the post is written in the employees’ words, works with them on edits and maintains their unique voices.\n\nAfter a post goes live, the We Are Cisco team will amplify it through social media posts across its social channels and LinkedIn page. A social media ambassador, through Sprinklr, then amplifies their colleagues’ posts to extend the post’s reach.\n\nBetween September 2022 and September 2023, the blog published 50 stories that received 115,000 views. The top three posts focused on employee wins: a #LoveWhereYouWork winner, a collaborative piece on why employees love the company and a piece highlighting learnings from a first year at Cisco.\n\nBut Cisco doesn’t measure success solely based on numerical metrics. The comments it has received on posts have been supportive, engaging and inspiring, showing the true value of the initiative for the company.\n\nCongratulations to the team at Cisco.\n\nTransUnion, Inc.\n\nTransUnion Internal Communications Team\n\nHow TransUnion’s communications team led it through an extensive transition\n\nWhen TransUnion acquired three companies between December 2021 and April 2022, bringing on about 4,000 new employees, the communications team had to integrate people, processes and systems across three companies. This integration process earned TransUnion a win in the Change Communication category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nFrom the first day of these integrations, TransUnion sought to keep employees motivated and engaged to support its 42 different workstreams and unite over 12,000 employees under the “One TransUnion” mindset.\n\nThe strategy was based on three pillars: inform and connect employees with accurate information; engage, train and educate employees on the “TransUnion way”; and inspire and demonstrate the employee value proposition.\n\nIt focused on:\n\nRetaining talent to keep employees engaged and productive.\n\nCreating a playbook that targeted both integrated and heritage teams at every level.\n\nIntegrating the different technology systems so they all fold into the technology infrastructure.\n\nCrafting a strategy that integrated processes across all teams from the newly acquired companies.\n\nAdjusting the “business as usual” communications strategy to reach new employees considering accessibility, relevance, context, purpose and persona.\n\nThe team created an employee onboarding campaign that saw more than 80% engagement, aligning and leveling employees across the organization during six months, which required 100% engagement and a 20-month-long campaign with over 15 campaigns and a toolkit of support assets.\n\nFor TransUnion, the integrations are performing as expected so far.\n\nFeedback from employees over 100 days has been mostly positive, with more than 80% expressing excitement to see how their organization will fit within the larger company.\n\nThe three “Connect” intranet sites created have also received more than 150,000 visits.\n\nThe All In onboarding series had a high engagement.\n\nThe total 112 “Scoop” newsletters received more than 10,000 page visits.\n\nTransUnion communications plan aligned close to 4,000 employees and contractors and received much positive direct feedback.\n\nCongratulations to the TransUnion team on this successful initiative.\n\nWray Ward\n\nEmpoWWer Service-Grant Program\n\nWray Ward is a champion of the Charlotte creative community\n\nWray Ward builds awareness, drives interest and creates engagement for its clients as well as local nonprofits and community organizations, serving as a voice for these organizations and underserved members of the communities they help. This dedication and support for nonprofits earned the agency a win in the Community Relations category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nAfter launching its EmpoWWer service and grant program in 2018, Wray Ward has raised more than $700,000 in donations, which support 15 nonprofits in Charlotte, N.C., where the organization is based. Wray Ward creates marketing communications strategies for these organizations using these funds.\n\nThe program is supported by the pillars of creativity, shelter, and advancement to help the nonprofits accomplish their missions, including combating systemic racism and gentrification, supporting local teachers, fostering youth confidence, supporting local artists, providing free housing for patients who need medical care and more.\n\nEach year, Wray Ward selects three or four nonprofits to work closely with, including brand photography, a new logo, a social media campaign or a video series. Employees can volunteer to participate in the EmpoWWer project, and many have continued to participate after the project ended.\n\nFor its 2022-2023 participants, Wray Ward worked with:\n\nUnited Way of Greater Charlotte requested a marketing strategy to increase understanding and support for its mission.\n\nIn working with United Way, Wray Ward evolved the brand with new design elements, photography and messaging to go with its new name. The agency also created workplace campaigns and strategies for social, email marketing, public relations and more.\n\nPFLAG Charlotte, which wanted to promote its LGBTQ+ and gender-affirming resources.\n\nWray Ward created two videos about its workshops, supplied communications and PR tools and crafted a social media plan and rebrand launch event.\n\nCharlotte Art League, which wanted to create awareness around its public gallery and visual arts offerings through a new logo and brand ethos.\n\nThe agency refreshed its logo, offered photography guidelines and best practices, and created PR, communications and social media strategies.\n\nThe agency’s measure of success is its ability to help these organizations reach their business goals and the positive feedback they receive.\n\nCongratulations to Wray Ward for its commitment to benefiting its community.\n\nJK Design\n\nThe Children's Place 2022 Environment, Social & Governance (ESG) Report\n\nHow JK Design crafted an ESG report that tells a story worth aspiring to\n\nSustainable business practices have been an integral part of The Children’s Place development from a brick-and-mortar storefront to becoming the largest children’s specialty apparel retailer. In working with the company, JK Design upheld these values and scored a win in the CSR/ESG Report category of Ragan’s Employee Communications Awards.\n\nThe 2022 report outlines the retailer’s ESG strategy, progress and targets while also showing its commitment to sustainability and responsible business practices in a way that is engaging and memorable to employees, investors and candidates.\n\nWorking with JK Design, the goal was to tell a cohesive story, making the complex data accessible and clear. After a workflow was established between the two teams, The Children’s Place chose a “whimsical, fingerprint-inspired style rooted in its playful, youthful spirit,” according to the nomination form.\n\nIn creating the report, JK Design delivered a compelling package with interactive navigation, simplified content, a visually digestible design with thoughtfully deployed white space, vibrant people and nature-focused photography, infographics and data tools, and testimonials from employees.\n\nTo share it with key stakeholders, The Children’s Place executed a communications plan that included:\n\nAn ESG webpage on its corporate website where anyone could download the full report, which has been downloaded approximately 1,400 times so far.\n\nA press release, which lives on the NewsPlace section of its site.\n\nAn email from the CEO to its 870 employees.\n\nAn article in the employee newsletter and intranet site.\n\nHighlights in the Q2 2023 investor relations deck.\n\nStakeholders have expressed appreciation for its accessible, digestible nature and were impressed by the information found in the report.\n\nCongratulations to JK Design for this well-earned win.\n\nSeattle Children's Hospital\n\nSeattle Children's Email Communications: Evolving Every Day\n\nSeattle Children’s Hospital reaches busy employees efficiently via email\n\nUnsurprisingly, the workforce at Seattle Children’s Hospital is exceedingly busy at any given time of the workday and, therefore, relies on email for company communications to effectively do their jobs. The strategies it deploys in reaching its 14,000-person workforce have earned it an honor in the Email Communication category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nThe organization regularly reevaluates its efforts of communicating with its employees, finding the outlets and channels to reach the right people efficiently. Therefore, messaging is highly targeted and personalized for its audiences. This includes:\n\nInHouse newsletter sent to all members weekly, which saw 700,000 emails sent across 50 campaigns over the last fiscal year.\n\nProvider updates are sent to all MDs, ARNPs, residents, fellows and more weekly.\n\nLeadership Message sent to supervisors and higher weekly.\n\nCentral Broadcasting, which are single-topic emails reserved for emergencies.\n\nFurther, over the course of a six-week period, Seattle Children’s Hospital saw more than 39,000 sessions, over 279,000 events and a 62.51% engagement rate on its intranet from just one newsletter.\n\nTo continue improving upon the process, the hospital worked with an outside vendor to survey employees to understand what was working and what needed improvement. The biggest piece of feedback that came through this effort was that people want more visually appealing messaging, so the team is working to onboard a new platform that will be quicker and have improved visuals.\n\nMoving forward, the team will continue to improve upon and finesse its strategies to continue meeting employees’ communication needs.\n\nCongratulations to Seattle Children’s Hospital on this well-deserved win!\n\nInternational Monetary Fund\n\nInternal Communications Division\n\nThe IMF expertly navigates transitions and major global events\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has weathered considerable change, including global events like the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple wars, and inflation, as well as internal change, like transitioning to a hybrid work model and a wave of retirements. Its efforts in welcoming new employees and communicating with its existing workforce have earned it a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Employee-Generated Content category.\n\nWith so much going on in the world and within the walls of IMF’s offices, the company wanted to emphasize a people-centered, empathetic communications strategy. To start, the team launched an Insider series in 2022 to spotlight priority issues and strengthen the IMF community by featuring staff voices. This multichannel digital platform included videos, blog articles (called Insider Voices), podcasts and events.\n\nInsider Videos combine talk show-style interviews with updates so staff can learn the latest news that isn’t accessible through other communications platforms. Since its March 2022 launch, 19 episodes have been produced on diversity, equity and inclusion, gender, climate and more.\n\nThe video series has led to increased viewership of all internal videos. Insider Videos have been played over 5,500 times and received more than 16% more views on average than other internal videos.\n\nInsider Voices are conversational and informal, a place for staff to write about both professional and personal issues that are important to them. The blog has seen more than 8,000 views and has been lauded by staff.\n\nInsider Events are virtual, interactive discussions on current policy topics where participants can engage with speakers. Since its launch in January 2022, there have been nine events on topics such as debt, inflation and more. Events have garnered 1,800 virtual attendees.\n\nThe Insider Voice Podcast offers staff perspectives on topics in engaging conversations. The newest offering, the podcast, has released five episodes since April 2023. So far, the podcast episodes have received 1,500 plays.\n\nAs it continues to develop and tweak the format, IMF is sure to continue resonating with its workforce.\n\nCongratulations to the team for this well-deserved win.\n\nOrbia\n\nOne Orbia - Where Purpose Comes To Life\n\nBringing Orbia’s Purpose-Driven Story to Life\n\nWith a common purpose to advance life around the world, Orbia had a pressing need and opportunity: to elevate, celebrate and cultivate its present and future workforce of over 20,000 passionate, purposeful employees working across six business and over 50 countries to ensure food and food security, information access and connectivity and decarbonization and the energy transition. Orbia’s commitment to bringing this purpose to life for all its employees has earned the company a win in the Employer Branding category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nStarting with extensive internal research and conversations led by Orbia’s People team, Orbia’s employees revealed a common story of being driven by the company’s purpose to advance life around the world in their everyday work, everywhere they were located: in fact, in a 2021 survey, 86% of employees said they saw a parallel between their daily activities and Orbia’s purpose. Orbia’s purpose was a clarion call to brave, responsible and inclusive dreamers, doers and builders who were committed to changing the world, and became the foundation for Orbia’s first employer brand and employer value proposition (EVP) of “where purpose comes to life.”\n\nFrom this EVP-led foundation, the Orbia team developed a visual language that utilized footprints and mirrored surfaces to reflect individual and collective steps made everywhere by employees to bring purpose to life, according to the company’s nomination form. Employee stories were identified as key components of the employer brand identity, and were collected in multiple formats and over 20 languages from team members around the world.\n\nIn advance of launching the employer brand and EVP, the Orbia team empowered over 200 champions across the company with brand messaging, materials and training to enable them to engage their colleagues and show up as ambassadors for the company’s brand story. Before the employer brand was launched, champion efforts had resulted in a 500% increase in intranet page views related to the effort without any further marketing.\n\nOnce Orbia’s employer brand and EVP was launched to the Orbia community through a virtual event in June, more than 100 locations hosted local viewing parties for over 16,000 onsite employees over 2,000 virtual employees (two times the viewership of the company’s average town hall). Following the launch festivities, 1,000 employees asked for the recording, the corresponding email about the initiative resulted in eight times the typical open rate, and social media posts announcing Orbia’s employer brand and EVP launch received an average of 9,000 views per post and a fourfold increase in clicks as well as double the engagement on Viva Engage with 23,305 views. External platforms saw a 27% increase in new followers.\n\nBeyond activating the company’s internal community, Orbia’s employer branding and EVP initiative also caught the attention of future purpose-driven talent. Orbia’s Careers site saw a significant 17% increase in traffic and a 33% increase in users, with 33,200 new applications and 28,000 new Careers portal subscriptions following this historic launch.\n\nCongratulations to the Orbia team for this well-deserved win!\n\nCorvias\n\nLeadership Development Program Launch\n\nCorvias is fostering a culture built around care and generosity\n\nCorvias anchors its success to three principles: being the best place to work, delivering high levels of service and giving back to its communities. In doing so, its efforts have earned it a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Executive/Leadership Communication category.\n\nThis initiative can be traced back to a 2022 employee engagement survey, which revealed a fragmented culture. So, the CEO appointed a working group to get to the root of the issue, learning that it came in part from different leadership styles and preferences.\n\nTo help create alignment, the team created a Leadership Development Program that was aligned with its three core principles to help identify common challenges for leaders and how to develop those careers to make the strongest leaders for the organization possible. In doing so, its goal was to receive at least 50% of attendance in training programs, improve engagement among leaders by 5% and see a 10% increase in culture sentiment from the prior year’s employee survey.\n\nIn accomplishing this mission, the team deployed three strategies:\n\nLeverage communication channels to get feedback that can influence the training programs.\n\nManagers and leaders made up a steering committee to influence definition of Corvias culture, while also gathering feedback from leadership and managers.\n\nCreate opportunities for more interactions between leaders and executive leaders.\n\nThroughout the year, executives to joined teams calls, scheduled visits with operational leadership and included operational leaders in executive leadership meetings.\n\nEnsure the leadership team is aware of learning and development opportunities.\n\nThe company CEO, CFO and COO held a kickoff event to introduce leaders to its 15 Leadership Principles, which created more natural pathways for collaboration, conversation and joining training events.\n\nAt award press time, Corvias has held nine Leadership Principle sessions (with over 75% attendance), six Next Level Leadership trainings (seeing 56% employee attendance) and three New Leader Foundation sessions (with attendance from 75% of eligible employees) since first creating the program. Instructional videos for the Leadership Playbook have been viewed 213 times among 226 enrolled leaders.\n\nCongratulations to Corvias for this well-deserved win.\n\nBrooks Running\n\nBrooksLife Feature Story\n\nBrooks Running is charting a course to help those in need with its storytelling\n\nBrooks Running has multiple communications channels to connect employees with company news, events and information. When an employee suggested a grassroots effort to support the people of Maui after the August wildfires, the company took on the challenge of telling a unique story. This effort has earned Brooks a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Feature Article category.\n\nThe article “Brooks Springs Product Donations to Maui” highlighted a group of employees who gathered footwear and apparel items for the victims of the wildfires. The piece focused on how these employees went above and beyond and the impact of these donations on the community.\n\nThe idea for the story came from a VP of sales, who shared how the employees had been coordinating these donations. A content lead coordinated quotes and information via emails, calls and video chats. And story sources weren’t just centered around employee narratives — the team reached out to people on the ground, including a woman involved in the Maui running community who distributed donated goods or a man whose home in Lahaina had been destroyed.\n\nThe 1,900-word article was shared with Brooks employees in North America on Sept. 8. In less than a week, it received 245 views (slightly under 40% of its North American workforce), 31 likes and five comments. It also yielded lots of internal buzz and sharing.\n\nBefore the story was published, 400 pairs of shoes and 550 apparel items had been donated, with an additional 150 pairs of shoes sent since publication.\n\nCongratulations to Brooks for this winning effort.\n\nThe Kroger Co.\n\n2023 Open Enrollment Campaign\n\nThe Kroger Co.’s human resources department is making sure everyone feels represented\n\nAcross The Kroger Co.’s more than 100,000-member consolidated plan, its human resources team has partnered with the Total Rewards Center of Excellence to promote the open enrollment benefits. Its work reaching both union and non-union participants earned Kroger a win in the HR Communication category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nThe HR team’s biggest challenge has been communicating with union and non-union employees through the typical channels in a broad sense. And since the 2023 open enrollment period was active, all employees had to reenroll on the company portal regardless of union status.\n\nBoth teams set three goals for the campaign:\n\nEncourage 75% of eligible participants to finish enrollment by the deadline and 85% by the extended deadline, which would be a 5% increase from the prior year.\n\nProvide compelling stories about the benefits the company offers.\n\nEnsure associates understand medical benefit options.\n\nThe goal was to provide everyone with educational resources and use storytelling to demonstrate how the tools work. Its theme was: “Life is a great adventure, and your benefits are ready to support you along the way. Let’s make sure they fit your needs this Open Enrollment season.”\n\nTo start with accomplishing this mission, the teams created a mailer to reach eligible employees at home showcasing the company’s benefits and led four town halls to share information about benefits. HR and leaders also provided resources to teams who requested them. To emphasize the importance of enrollment, robocalls were used to follow up with associates who hadn’t enrolled yet.\n\nMore than 80% of eligible employees enrolled by the deadline, and 87% for the entire campaign duration, an almost 10% increase from the prior year.\n\nBut perhaps more valuable than data and metrics is that employees reported that they felt more prepared for the benefits enrollment period and better understood the process — including the mailers, which one leader said they engaged with it more than other enrollment communications materials in her career.\n\nCongratulations to Kroger’s comms team for this well-deserved win!\n\n3M\n\n3M Forward Virtual Fairs\n\n3M showed employees the science behind the positive impact it has on the world\n\nHeading into a challenging 2023 business environment, 3M knew it had to reenergize employees and illustrate the company’s impact. To do so, the company created opportunities for its scientists and engineers to share firsthand how it’s tackling challenges, earning it a win in the Innovation in Internal Communications category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nIn creating the project, the organization wanted to find a way to show how it’s confronting difficult topics like climate change, shifting demographics and the merging of physical and digital worlds. The biggest challenge was doing so in a way that would reach its global employees, many of whom work on hybrid schedules of their choosing or entirely remotely, which is why a virtual campaign across all digital channels (Outlook, SharePoint, Teams and Viva Engage) made the most sense.\n\nThe 3M team held three monthly 3M Forward Virtual Fairs during the summer. These fairs covered 19 topics and were led by subject matter experts in their respective fields. June focused on climate and sustainable packing solutions, July on industrial safety and automation, and August on automotive electrification and digital innovations.\n\nThey sent out newsletters and emails to promote events to its more than 90,000 employees.\n\nA landing page and content hub on SharePoint held topic information and links to the individual sessions.\n\nViva Engage held an “In Case You Missed It” content break after events for employees to catch up and keep engagement up afterward.\n\nDuring a two-hour event, scientists and engineers presented and answered questions from employees in 30-minute sessions via moderated Teams meetings.\n\n“Your presentation made me feel proud to work at 3M, create technology that improves devices that we will all use in the near future,” said a Spain-based sales representative. “Seeing that innovation example of the reflective polarized lens, and such a successful business, gives me stamina to continue going on.”\n\nNormally 3M sees lower participation on its intranet during the summer, but almost 3,700 participants were involved across 49 countries, with 40% coming from outside the U.S. On the SharePoint hub, these videos got another 4,600 views, totally almost 8,300 views.\n\nReceiving such positive feedback and seeing those results creates a template for 3M to use for important company moments in the future.\n\nCongratulations to 3M for this well-deserved win.\n\nCampbell's\n\nWhat the Tech? Email Campaign\n\nCampbell’s digital workplace team is capturing employee attention\n\nUsing email to communicate with all its employees, particularly by IT, to showcase new technologies, Campbell’s digital workplace team is ensuring that everyone is educated about its tools. These efforts earned the team a win in the Internal Email category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nThrough short, pithy emails, the team captivates attention immediately by dividing emails into “What’s happening?” and “What do I need to do?” sections. By highlighting the important information to readers in this way, the team can absorb what they need to know and can seek out additional information through external links in the emails, which take employees to instructional videos.\n\nThe team sends three different email templates from its “What the Tech” address with those questions in them: “Know IT,” which offers suggestions, best practices and upcoming events the tech team wants employees to know about; “Do IT,” which has actions that employees can take to upgrade their devices; and “Watch IT,” which shares important information for employees and also how to distinguish phishing scams from team emails.\n\nDepending on the emails that the tech team is sending out, they can also cater them to a smaller distribution list, depending on the content in the email.\n\nOver the five months that the “What the Tech” emails have been sent out, they have reached more than 450,000 recipients. The digital workplace team gets feedback and quantitative results to determine what is and isn’t working in the campaign. For instance, in one email sent about a new program to download (PDF X-Change Editor Plus), viewership of the download instructions hit 374 views after having gotten no views beforehand and the viewership of the third-party educational platform, QuickHelp, hit 2,281 views, an over 8,000% increase in total views.\n\nCongratulations to this innovative team.\n\nDennis Group\n\nBread & Butter Magazine\n\nBreaking news: Dennis Group’s internal magazine is a hit with employees\n\n“Bread & Butter,” the Dennis Group’s internal magazine, shares companywide news and efforts to improve communication with its 700 employees, who span three countries and eight offices across North and South America. This effort has earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Magazine category.\n\nThe move came after employees requested more frequent communication and transparency. The marketing team didn’t want to just create an electronic newsletter — instead, it saw a magazine as a way to tell captivating, long-form stories with interesting visuals that would jive with its dynamic team.\n\nOn top of creating this magazine, the team of seven is also working on lead cultivation, sales support, trade shows, internal communications and other marketing efforts, so they’ve honed the process to be as efficient as possible. Various departments share ideas for content, including employee recognition, project spotlights, photo galleries and feature stories, which are then trimmed down to 12-16 pieces of content per issue. Before the marketing team moves forward on creating it, the legal, senior leadership and HR teams all sign off and flag any potential issues.\n\nOnce articles have been edited and drafted, the design team builds the magazine, which is then sent over to the same departments for a final review and is translated to Portuguese to also reach that employee audience.\n\nOn average, emails related to “Bread & Butter” have an open rate of 86%, an average of 28% email click-through rate and 10 minutes of engagement time for the online magazine. For the reach of the actual print magazine, 675 copies have reached an average of 450 impressions for each online magazine, which is 65% of the company.\n\nBeyond that, though, the feedback from employees has been overwhelmingly positive, reflecting the initiative’s overall success. Plus, people have proactively contributed to the magazine and offered ideas and content.\n\nHaving an actively engaged workforce doesn’t hurt with keeping the momentum going.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nDelta Dental of California\n\nUpleveling Our Leaders\n\nHow Delta Dental is “upleveling” its engagement strategies companywide\n\nWhen Delta Dental of California’s executive and internal communications teams met in 2023, they wanted to connect and empower employees by giving them the right tools to communicate best with their teams. In doing so, they set their people leaders up across the company with sessions and webinars. This effort has earned the team a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Manager Communication category.\n\nTo do this, the company created monthly People Leader Webinars (PLWs) to educate leaders and give them the resources so they could motivate their teams. It includes a business update, topics and a live Q&A to build up people leaders’ skills and confidence. According to survey results, the webinar has increased participants’ knowledge of the company’s finances (88%), enterprise initiatives (94%) and many came away feeling like the company is more organized and informative (84%).\n\nThrough People Leader Listening Sessions, senior-level leaders can connect with mid-level leaders to learn where they and their teams are at. The series started with the president and COO Sarah Chavarria and members of the presidential leadership team meeting with 60 people leaders in Alpharetta, Georgia, offering a chance to hear from a large portion of the company’s workforce. Almost 150 joined the first listening session, and as a result, changes were made to focus on coaching and improve upon the Delta Dental experience.\n\nDelta Dental’s People Leader Hub got a makeover, creating a space where people could find tips, resources on leadership and the team’s philosophy. A survey found that 38% of respondents use the hub weekly and 47% monthly. An email with links to the hub saw an average increase of 160 site visits.\n\nThe teams also refreshed the Talent Development and Learning newsletter to create development programming, which shared targeted resources and information about program offerings. This resulted in a 59% average open rate for the newsletter, with half responding that they were happy with the topics covered, which was shown when the Percipio learning platform saw a 9.2% increase in utilization after it was included in the newsletter.\n\nOverall, this “upleveling” has touched upon many aspects of the company so far.\n\nCongratulations to this exceptional team!\n\nHilton\n\nGlobal Internal Communications\n\nHilton is inspiring team members on a global scale\n\nHilton refreshed its internal communications channels using data and insights between mid-2020 and the end of 2022, transforming its communication with members. This effort earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Measurement and Data category.\n\nThe company was focused on recovery coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, and what better way to do so than by reworking communications efforts between team members and the organization?\n\nAn audit found that team members were being asked to consume up to 32 pieces of content per week across Hilton’s primary channels, nearly one piece per hour. This didn’t include communications like emails, webinars or above-property efforts. Unfortunately, according to the submission write-up, this often led to lower engagement and “likely diluted the impact” of its offerings.\n\nTo resolve that, the team focused on trimming down its output, instead creating less frequent and more effective efforts that would target the right people at the best time and frequency to meet their needs. To do so meant that data was at the core of the effort, adapting as needed based on their findings and ultimately ensuring they would give team members the most relevant, engaging content.\n\nA big part of this effort was transforming the department to look like a more traditional newsroom with an editor-in-chief who oversaw weekly editorial meetings to fuel new ideas for content. There were also quarterly metric reports with analytics and social media data, setting benchmarks to reach each quarter.\n\nPlus, the acquired data also helped update the way the platforms worked, including redoing its intranet homepage, The Lobby, in 2022 so it had more space for team member stories and became mobile-friendly. In addition, the NOW channel was adjusted to prioritize information that was useful to hotel leaders. From this research, for instance, the team learned that Tuesdays tended to generate the highest engagement for members and that 30- to 60-second videos drove the most traction.\n\nBy Q2 2023, Hilton had reduced outgoing communications by 80%, and as a result, The Lobby saw an average of 447,000 member visits, an increase of 64% year over year. Further, content engagement also went up to 17%, made up of over 9,000 members interacting with the content. Its NOW channel also saw 115,000 hotel leaders register, with 41,000 actively participating, an increase of 27% in registrations and 6% in active users year over year.\n\nOverall, team members are using community channels to share ideas and tips more than ever, with almost three-quarters of content being user-generated.\n\nCongratulations to this exceptional comms team!\n\nCBRE\n\nServing Up Ethics with Creativity, Innovation & Espresso\n\nCBRE refreshed how it shares ethics and compliance information with its teams\n\nFor CBRE’s “Ethics Over Espresso” video series, its chief ethics and compliance officer, Elizabeth Atlee, spoke candidly with guests about ethics and governance to shape and preserve the company’s culture. This initiative won a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Mission and Values Communication category.\n\nAccording to Atlee, “The policies and information we need to share can be dry. That makes getting the message across to employees — and ensuring they internalize it — difficult at times.”\n\nBecause of this challenge, a campaign of videos was created to leverage Atlee’s personality and expertise, where she humanizes a featured topic alongside a subject matter expert. In the series, the hope was to prevent financial, operational and reputational loss due to unethical employee behavior; build a relationship between Atlee and the viewers; encourage employees who witness misconduct to speak up; and deliver information in a creative, engaging way.\n\nThrough detailed prep, production, and promotion, the video series created educational and innovative pieces. Once the videos were live, a news article with a call to action for contacting Atlee was also published on the CBRE intranet homepage and corresponding posts were sent out through internal social networks.\n\nThe first episode went live in September 2022 and has published six episodes since. Views are up 273% since that first episode, with the average time spent watching at 78%. The intranet pageviews have increased by 41% since the first episode, and time spent on the intranet increased by 25%. Overall engagement impressions have gone up 4,854% since the first episode.\n\nCBRE’s team has learned what goes into a successful video campaign that keeps viewers coming back.\n\nCongratulations to CBRE for this well-deserved win!\n\nPrologis\n\nThe Weekly - Building a Culture of Communications\n\nPrologis revamps its internal communications strategy\n\nAfter its most tenured member joined the team in August 2021, it became clear to the Prologis team that there wasn’t a clear strategy for its internal communications. That’s why it launched a weekly newsletter titled “The Weekly” in May 2022. By taking this initiative, the Prologis team is being recognized in Ragan’s Employee Communications Awards for Newsletter.\n\n“The Weekly” serves as a singular place for employees to find information about company updates, bringing news and events together to keep employees connected. It also helped to boost engagement and viewership of the stories published on its intranet.\n\nThe team created a template that was on-brand with the company’s look. Employees chose the newsletter’s name so they felt more invested in the project. Overall, the newsletter has a more casual tone that makes the content more digestible and accessible.\n\nThis created a path for collecting stories that led to relevant, high-quality content for each edition. By establishing a consistent presence in employee inboxes, it became an integral communications tool for the company.\n\nAs the team tweaked it to improve it, engagement ticked up for open rates (around 70%), click-through rates, time spent reading, and intranet viewership of stories (increasing by between 15% and 19%). The email platform Poppulo featured “The Weekly” as an example of what “good” looks like during its annual customer conference.\n\nPlus, employee feedback has been positive, with many saying that having essential information in one streamlined offering helps them stay up to date on updates and events.\n\nSince its launch, “The Weekly” has provided useful information to employees and driven unity, connected the overall company and shared Prologis successes.\n\nCongratulations to this innovative team!\n\nCBRE\n\nEffective Allies in Engaging, Supporting and Inspiring Employees\n\nCBRE is creating people-centered campaigns to celebrate its employees\n\nCBRE’s communication team is finding ways to engage and celebrate new hires, employees and managers by working closely with the people (human resources) team. This initiative has earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Partnership with Human Resources category.\n\nCampaigns are created to be personalized and create a sense of support and belonging for each employee. Through four campaigns — Annual Essential Learning, Global Onboarding, Manager Resources and Performance Management — each included intranet hubs, articles and ads; internal social media; targeted emails and newsletters; media walls in its offices; screensavers; and printed materials.\n\nFor new hires, a 2022 employee experience survey got feedback to influence its onboarding experience, which resulted in a more welcoming and transparent approach. This included an introductory video, an intranet article that highlighted new employees’ first days, inclusion in existing newsletters, resources for employees on the hub page and email guidance timed to each onboarding milestone. The intranet story “New Hires Get a New Welcome” received over 3,800 views in five months, and the onboarding hubs saw more than 56,100 pageviews over that same period.\n\nExisting employees shared a desire for my development opportunities, which resulted in a series of courses and required training, known as the “I Am Essential” campaign. In 2023, almost three-quarters of employees were expected to complete training, and it received over 1,000 ad clicks the year before.\n\nThe team also created a Performance Management campaign that allowed existing employees to set goals, receive year-end reviews and hold conversations with their managers throughout the year to check in on that development. Those 2022 year-end review campaigns were the second most successful of that year, with 98% of managers completing reviews and 89% of employees having set goals by December 2022. Come mid-year 2023, almost half of managers did their reviews, a 20% increase from the last year.\n\nLastly, the communications team created a Manager Hub intranet site with articles, resources, training and information, which received over 118,000 views in the last year and saw 5,000 documents downloaded. A special newsletter, the Manager Briefing, reached almost 22,300 managers and had a 78% open rate. A Leadership Fundamentals course catered to managers was also available.\n\nAccording to Chief People Office Alison Caplan, “CBRE’s people are being welcomed, prepared and guided better than ever before.”\n\nCongratulations to CBRE for this powerful initiative.\n\nOptus\n\nInternal leadership podcast\n\nOptus CEO’s internal podcast offers a ‘fly on the wall’ opportunity to connect\n\nEach season consists of five 30-minute episodes in conversation with CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin and can be found on Optus’ app, LifeAtOptus. Rosmarin offers thought leadership and engages employees with insights, earning Optus a win in the Podcast category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nThe bi-monthly podcast episodes aim to support leaders in growth, inspiration and purpose. They are timed with the Singaporean financial year and are timed with Optus’ parent company. Push notifications through the app alert leaders to new episodes, along with an email that summarizes the key takeaways from each episode.\n\nBeyond that, there is an incentive for employees who are completing the Optus 12 Hours of Learning initiative, which helps with career development and learning. Listening to the podcast episodes count toward those 12 hours needed.\n\nFor the third season, which is currently in production, the team is utilizing data and analytics to better inform how to finesse future seasons and targets with personalized communications. Listeners are encouraged to submit guest requests to Rosmarin, which will be featured in future episodes. This season will feature five global business executives, its strongest guest lineup yet.\n\nSince launching, the podcast has received over 9,000 plays as of July 2023. Following a survey sent to listeners, they rated it 4.32 out of 5 for content, 4.16 out of 5 for length and 4.47 out of 5 for ease of access.\n\nIn the future, the team plans to continue tweaking the process so they can find elements to improve upon.\n\nCongratulations to the team behind this podcast!\n\nHoneywell PMT\n\nTag Your Voice\n\nHoneywell PMT elevates communications beyond the traditional methods\n\nThe Honeywell PMT “Tag Your Voice” campaign aimed to equip managers with the right tools and resources and also encourage employees to participate in the survey. This effort has earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Pulse Survey category.\n\nThe campaign aimed to increase its Voice of Employee (VOE) engagement score (from 69 to 72) with a more than 89% response rate. The strategy was based on three pillars: educate, engage and maintain awareness.\n\nThe educating pillar offered leadership messaging that outlined the action plans and accomplishments since the last survey.\n\nBy fostering engagement, the team launched a short-term campaign on its internal social network, Yammer, highlighting personal stories through a video series.\n\nIn maintaining awareness, the team sent email reminders to employees and a daily scorecard to leaders and HR. The team kept the momentum going with messaging and Ask Me Anything sessions to target people within the organization.\n\nPMT’s CEO kicked off the VOE survey with a message that highlighted the importance of sharing their voice. The team created engaging content with fun facts about voices, world puzzles of famous voices and video testimonials that supported that messaging. In one video testimonial, for example, a leader with a high VOE score shared how he handled feedback from his team.\n\nTo keep awareness up and action on the internal plans going, the team created a VOE Council to oversee the process and find practical actions. Another Ask Me Anything series was launched to explore those results and receive answers from the leadership team.\n\nThe survey saw a 92% response rate, a seven-point increase from the prior year, with an engagement score that increased by four points. Employees left more than 26,000 comments, a threefold year-over-year increase, and engaged with Yammer posts over 80 times, 10% of all Q1 interactions. The videos received more than 115 views, with a 50% retention rate.\n\nOn the leadership’s side, messages related to the VOE saw an over-open rate of 75%, surpassing other PMT emails, which are at 58%. The Ask Me Anything series had almost 250 participants, who consumed more than five days’ worth of content.\n\nNot only did PMT’s VOE campaign exceed its goal, but it also saw a spike in employee engagement and awareness of the survey.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nPayoneer\n\nRecruitment Video Feed\n\nPayoneer used data to influence how it captures the attention of new talent\n\nWhen candidates apply for jobs, according to Talent Board data, they want to understand the company’s culture, the nature of employees’ experiences and feel an overall connection to the company they’re applying to. Payoneer interpreted this and turned out a video project that involved its global teams, earning a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Recruitment category.\n\nThe initiative’s goal was to solidify Payoneer as “an employer of choice,” according to its nomination form, by sharing its story through employees’ experiences while also building trust. The company saw video as an efficient way to generate brand awareness, build value, connect with candidates and drive traffic to the site.\n\nThe team created 150 short videos that brought in employees and management across its U.S., China and Israel offices, highlighting an individual who spoke about their experience at the company and what it meant to work there. Potential candidates could browse a career site where all the videos were listed and categorized under topics like Tips for Candidates, Tech, Career Development, Compliance and Risk, Our Culture and more.\n\nAfter talent applies, the human resources team could interact with talent by sending messages, sharing relevant videos, amplifying messages and more.\n\nThis initiative’s effects have resonated throughout the company’s global offices, empowering teams by providing new recruitment tools. Existing employees were also able to reflect on and share their stories and become brand ambassadors. Potential employees were able to get more deeply immersed in connecting with the company.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nCisco (We Are Cisco)\n\n2023 #LoveWhereYouWork Contest\n\nCisco is helping its employees recognize why they love where they work\n\nCisco’s people-first workplace environment has yielded it recognition as the No. 1 Best Workplace in over a dozen countries, according to surveys from Great Place to Work. Because of that, employees are eager to share their experiences working at the company through the #LoveWhereYouWork contest. This initiative has earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Social Media category.\n\nThe contest, which ran for four weeks between April 10 and May 5, 2023, strengthened the company’s brand awareness by sharing authentic stories, building a We Are Cisco brand content library, boosting employee morale, building connections among coworkers and inspiring creativity by asking for content around new topics and initiatives.\n\nEmployees were encouraged to share why they love working at the company via LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram and an internal Webex Space platform, where they competed for monetary prizes. Categories were developed through social listening based on trends that employees were already posting, which encouraged them to explore different mediums like videos and content focused on company initiatives.\n\nThe contest coincided with Cisco’s recognition in the top space for Fortune’s Best Workplace in the U.S. list for the third year in a row. Contest participants received Polaroid instant cameras, and momentum remained high as communications went out regularly to its 80,000 employees directly. There were also shoutouts at virtual meetings, digital signage in the offices, announcements in Webex Spaces, updates on the Employee Connection site and posts on its social media channels.\n\nThe team went through all the top finalists in each category, with fourth place finalists’ content aggregated into the employee portal so they could vote on their favorites (which also resulted in $10,000 in donations each). Winning stories were uploaded to the company’s content library, onto the brand’s social media and into blog posts.\n\nThe team received almost 2,500 pieces of content, with LinkedIn as the most active platform where a third of entries were found. The content library is now home to 1,420 pieces of content. The blog post saw over 11,000 pageviews and over 50 comments, the Instagram Story sharing the winners’ blog article had a 5% click-through rate, and the LinkedIn post announcing the winners had over 2,000 reactions and more than 50 shares.\n\nIt’s an initiative that will have everyone keeping their eyes on the company’s social media for more.\n\nCongratulations to the team for this well-deserved win!\n\nChildren's Hospital Colorado\n\nDifferenceMakers Storytelling Campaign\n\nHow Children’s Hospital Colorado pivoted to positivity\n\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the Children’s Hospital Colorado team wanted to celebrate its team members and move away from focusing on the crisis. Instead, they wanted to reconnect team members to the company’s culture and focus on what every team member brings to the company. This initiative has earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Storytelling category.\n\nNot only was it a stressful time in the medical field, but the company also wanted to boost staff retention after following trouble keeping employees on staff. Inspired by its “Here, It’s Different” campaign, the organization created the DifferenceMakers to highlight team stories.\n\nThose highlighted were nominated, interviewed, profiled and photographed before pieces were published across its intranet with video profiles. The profiles ran every other week over the course of the year, debuting on Team Member Appreciation Day in September 2022, and they were also featured in all Colorado locations’ digital monitors, appeared on yard signs and T-shirts, and had their own logos. With the T-shirts came a tag that had a QR code redirecting to the internal microsite.\n\nThe initiative has received 65 nominations so far, with 24 team members featured as DifferenceMakers. The campaign site has been viewed more than 9,800 times.\n\nWhen stories are published, they are also featured in organization-wide newsletters, consistently performing as the most popular items. For instance, a recent profile had a click-through rate of 54.77%, compared to an average of 4.52% for other newsletter items. Among other initiatives, DifferenceMakers has contributed to a spike in employee engagement based on internal surveys.\n\nOn Team Member Appreciation Day in 2023, they ran a weekly DifferenceMakers profile instead of every other week. A message from the CEO featured the top profiles and excerpts on digital monitors.\n\nInitially, the idea was to run the initiative for only a year, but due to its success, it’s been instilled as a permanent campaign.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nHoneywell Process Solutions\n\nWeekly #SafetyMoment\n\nHow Honeywell Process Solutions prioritizes employee safety\n\nHoneywell Process Solutions (HPS) wanted to raise awareness about its safety practices and procedures while also ensuring its employees were educated on the topics. In doing so, the team recognized that there was an opportunity to highlight leadership. This initiative has earned a win in Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Visual Storytelling category.\n\nThe team compiled over 50 #SafetyMoments topics to serve as one slide packed with captivating visuals and a thought-provoking question. The idea was that these slides would serve as conversation starters at the start of meetings, internally and otherwise, on topics including how to use everyday equipment, handrail use, stress management and workstation adjustment.\n\nThe initiative needed leadership participation and buy-in, so each #SafetyMoment was distributed weekly and sponsored by a business leader. In doing so, that leader contributed an interpretation of the topic, a personal photo and a statement about why safety is important to them. Each message was sent to employees in a weekly email and recorded as an article on the company’s SharePoint site. Email open rates have been over 60%.\n\nMore than 20 weekly #SafetyMoments have been distributed to the employee base (made up of over 10,000 employees). Both leaders and employees alike have contacted the team with commentary and photos. And spurred from that have been trainings across HPS to implement the campaign.\n\nThe slides from #SafetyMoments have been used during Safety Week (Sept. 18-22) at conferences, town halls and customer events.\n\nCongratulations to HPS!\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise\n\nGrilling Around the Globe Video Series\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise reintroduced “fresh thinking” to its workplace\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Communications wanted to approach the 2022 through 2023 year with optimism and fun in returning to the workplace following the isolation that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. Their efforts of solidifying its business and cultural priorities and bringing team members back into the office have earned HPE a win in the Amazing Workplace Culture category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of creating this initiative was ensuring that all 60,000 team members spanning 55 countries felt the messaging was relevant to them. In an Anthony Bourdain-style travel show, “Grilling Around the Globe” was meant to showcase its diverse employee base, unique facilities and customer offerings.\n\nThe series’ resident “Grilling Guys” traveled to sites around the world to “grill” team members on why they love working for HPE; the unique qualities of their worksite; how the products, people and innovations of the company are helping them to advance in their professional and personal lives; and how the company has impacted the region and local partnerships.\n\nIn the past year, the team has visited locations in Germany, Texas and Mexico. After selecting a location, the team works with local ambassadors to identify spokespeople, stars and subject matter experts for interviews and as local guides.\n\nFollowing each episode, team members joined together for culture-building events. The episodes would air on HPE channels, primarily geared toward internal audiences.\n\nA recent episode was in Guadalajara, timed to go live at the start of Hispanic Heritage Month. Every team member who commented on the content was entered into a raffle. Then, at a September all-team meeting, a host from the region plugged the program and raffle.\n\nThe series is the best-performing content on HPE Insider, with more than 30% of views by its 60,000 team members. Pieces of content continue to break records for views, likes and comments. The pieces are also externally promoted on LinkedIn, where they were the highest-performing content of the quarter, seeing nearly 1,000 likes and almost 130 shares.\n\nThe series intends to continue into 2024 with trips planned to India, Poland and Japan.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nNissan\n\nNissan INSIDERS\n\nNissan employee INSIDERS program drives engagement and reputation\n\nIn 2023, Nissan U.S. formalized its employee ambassador program, offering brand ambassadors a slew of experiences, including trips to sporting and cultural events. The program’s success has resulted in Ragan Communications honoring Nissan U.S. for Brand Ambassador Program in the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of the 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nMany companies have brand ambassadors where select employees enjoy C-suite access, early looks at new products and other perks. In exchange, ambassadors help create culture, bolster employee engagement and build a reputation for the company as a great place to work. In addition to sending informal messages, ambassadors frequently post company-curated social content.\n\nNissan U.S. had an ambassador program called INSIDERS, and it worked well. However, in 2023, the internal communication department decided formalizing the effort would make it more effective. The plan included offering ambassadors high-value incentives and creating a small group of the most enthusiastic ambassadors, called Master Ambassadors.\n\nMoreover, Nissan began requiring all INSIDERS receive formal training. In addition, the company started measuring its INSIDER program to assess its value.\n\nThe exclusive opportunities for INSIDERS included travel to auto shows, conferences, sports, and media and marketing events, including the NCAA Final Four. In addition, INSIDERS were offered exclusive ride and drive experiences in new Nissan vehicles. Moreover, they also received additional opportunities to connect with corporate leadership, both in-person and through virtual events.\n\nIn return, INSIDERS engaged employees personally and via social media. More than 130 INSIDERS participated in social media challenges, sharing more than 3,000 posts since April 2023 and creating a LinkedIn audience of over 32,000 connections. Employees responding to Insiders’ social posts were incentivized with opportunities for prizes.\n\nThrough measurement, Nissan found the INSIDERS and Master Ambassadors programs improved employees’ work experience while also increasing brand awareness, loyalty and trust. Plus, the social media component increased its corporate reputation. INSIDERS gained 47 new members in 2023, bringing the total to 203 employees and representing every Nissan U.S. facility.\n\nCongratulations to Nissan U.S.\n\nInfineon Americas\n\nDiversity & Inclusion Commitment\n\nInfineon Technologies builds strategy around key DE&I initiatives\n\nInfineon Technologies is a global semiconductor leader in power systems and IoT. Infineon drives decarbonization and digitalization with its products and solutions while also focusing on employees and building out a holistic diversity and inclusion program. Their efforts have won Ragan’s Employee Communication Award, Class of 2024, in the DE&I and ESG Commitments category.\n\nInfineon has implemented a range of DE&I initiatives that promote inclusivity and leverage diverse perspectives, focusing on creating an environment where every employee feels valued, heard and respected. The DE&I strategy includes three long-term targets: improving organizational effectiveness, advancing an inclusive culture and creating an equitable work environment.\n\nKey achievements from Infineon’s DE&I initiatives in the last year include:\n\nLaunched six new employee resource groups (ERGs) to support community and employee engagement. These employee-led groups bring together 33 leaders who plan, execute and promote their monthly meetings and activities.\n\nA step forward (0.5% increase year over year) toward the goal of having 20% of leadership positions worldwide filled by female colleagues by 2030.\n\nCelebrated 48 educational sessions for Diversity Days, a week-long series of events focused on DE&I, with 4,455 employees participating in sessions that taught how DE&I can be a bridge for better connections with their colleagues.\n\nExpanded DE&I intranet pages, which attracted over 25,000 unique page views.\n\nThe DE&I and internal communications departments partnered on various strategies to publicize and raise awareness with employees, including weekly newsletters, internal social media posts and onsite signage and flyers. Additionally, DE&I learning opportunities abound, including mentorship programs, intercultural training sessions and educational opportunities, and virtual and in-person events in order to create the best Infineon for everyone.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to remain in contact with their manager or local DE&I representatives with any feedback. Additionally, the company offers a biannual Engagement Pulse Check (employee engagement survey) as an opportunity for employees to speak up directly.\n\nCongratulations to Infineon Technologies on their achievements.\n\nMastercard LAC\n\nDecrypted Series in LAC\n\nMastercard Latin America/Caribbean communicators ‘decrypt’ crypto for staff\n\nWith cryptocurrency booming in Latin America, Mastercard communicators in Latin America and the Caribbean tapped company experts for an engaging multiplatform series that explained crypto and the company’s strategy around it. Its success resulted in recognition in the Employee Education/Training Program within the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of Ragan’s Employee Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nThe exponential growth of digital currencies in Latin America presented a major opportunity for Mastercard Latin America and the Caribbean’s (LAC) internal communication team. Mastercard’s 1,200 employees in the region, who knew crypto was becoming a top business priority, were eager to understand this rapidly evolving phenomenon.\n\nOn the other hand, crypto is filled with arcane terminology and nuance. Offering an educational series for employees that included complex material would fail unless it was presented in an accessible manner.\n\nAccordingly, Mastercard LAC’s internal communications team responded with “Decrypted,” an accessible, five-part educational series that tapped crypto industry leaders and the company’s own crypto experts.\n\nThe team presented the topic in a variety of ways, including short introductory videos; a weekly Ask Me Anything (AMA) session with experts that was live, taped and offered on demand; and follow-up material located on a dedicated Decrypted intranet landing page, where all series’ content was stored. In addition, quizzes and weekly challenges helped further make crypto come alive for employees.\n\nThe series of videos and AMAs covered five crypto-related topics and tied them to Mastercard’s business strategy. These included LAC’s crypto trading wave, digital currencies, crypto exchanges and the future of finance, NFTs beyond digital art and decentralized finance.\n\nThe series was publicized in more than 15 internal newsletters, emails and other materials. More than 400 employees visited the Decrypted landing page and on-demand open rates hovered at 70%. An average of 350 employees participated in each live AMA session, which 100% found useful, with 98% saying the content was easy to understand. Mastercard was so pleased with the program, it decided to take the series global in 2024.\n\nFelicidades to Mastercard LAC.\n\nNorthrop Grumman\n\nNorthrop Grumman B-21 Raider: Unveiling the Future of America’s Defense and Deterrence\n\nNorthrop Grumman highlights employees at bomber unveiling\n\nOn Dec. 2, 2022, Northrop Grumman unveiled its B-21 Raider, the U.S. Air Force’s first new strategic bomber in almost 30 years. The aircraft shared the spotlight with thousands of employees who developed and built it. The gala ceremony and myriad events leading up to it earned the communication team honors for Employee Engagement in the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nCommunicators often say their families and friends don’t understand what they do for a living. In the case of thousands of employees at Northrop Grumman working on classified programs, such as the Air Force’s newest bomber, B-21 Raider bomber, the law stipulates they couldn’t tell anyone.\n\nHowever, a few months before the aircraft’s gala unveiling on Dec. 2, 2022, employees were cleared to speak about the new aircraft. From the moment communicators got to work, planning events and ultimately the aircraft’s unveiling, they ensured a spotlight would also shine on the thousands of employees who built it.\n\nNot only did select employees attend the unveiling — along with thousands of VIP military and civilian guests, members of Congress, millions of online viewers, Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — but they played critical roles throughout the event. An employee sang the national anthem, several towed the bomber from its hangar to the viewing stand and others pulled the shroud from the aircraft. Earned and owned media materials and other program collateral emphasized B-21 employees’ contributions.\n\nBeyond that, employee ambassadors were sprinkled throughout the crowd and encouraged to tell guests their stories about the aircraft. Other employees were engaged before the ceremony as volunteer planners.\n\nThe initial announcement of the event to employees, distributed via internal newsletters, was clicked a record 22,000 times. Offsite employee watch parties garnered nearly 3,000 viewers across Northrop Grumman sites.\n\nAdditional content created for internal company distribution powered employee engagement rates 245% higher than quarterly averages while driving more than 150,000 visits to Northrop Grumman’s external B-21 web pages, a 105% increase in traffic to the company magazine.\n\nLots of companies say their employees are their most valuable asset, but few have demonstrated that more effectively than Northop Grumman. Congratulations to Northrop Grumman communicators and, of course, the B-21 team.\n\nUniversity of Miami\n\nPowered by You, University/UHealth Marketing and Communications Team\n\nUniversity of Miami’s ‘Powered by You’ doubles participation rate in employee survey\n\nUsing a series of PR and marketing tactics, the University of Miami, its medical school and health system more than doubled employee participation in 2023. This success earned them recognition for Employee Engagement in the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of Ragan’s Employee Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nInternal communicators understand how difficult it is to obtain staff participation in employee surveys. It’s a common issue for employers ­­— the scourge of quiet quitting and disengagement from work is coupled with a resistance toward employee engagement surveys. Ironically, these surveys are critical tools that can enhance the work experience while also retaining and recruiting top talent. Indeed, engagement was the impetus behind a 2023 employee survey from the University of Miami (The U), its Miller School of Medicine and health system UHealth.\n\nYet participation in a previous survey was just 36%. As such, communicators were tasked with raising awareness and participation. The PR pros’ first steps included naming the campaign, and they chose Powered by You Faculty and Staff Survey.\n\nNext, they sought a survey provider with experience in the academic and medical sectors. Perceptyx fit the bill and promptly began work on a 29-question survey probing topics such as inclusivity, work culture, engagement and career advancement among the 18,000-plus faculty and staff.\n\nMeanwhile, communicators were busy crafting pre-survey publicity materials, including letters and videos from senior leaders, social media posts, window clings and elevator wraps. Moreover, there were roadshow presentations, pep rallies, stickers, pizza parties, informational sessions and a pair of activations: a circular sidewalk installation featuring the “Powered By” slogan with the letters “You” displayed in 3D above it and a photobooth aimed at providing a fun, interactive way to encourage participation.\n\nOn a more serious side, a comprehensive toolkit for managers was also created. It included a wealth of pre- and post-survey materials to help managers guide their teams.\n\nThe results were a 74% response rate on the survey, more than double the 2018’s rate. In addition, it was well above Perceptyx’s benchmark for academic institutions.\n\nCongratulations to the University of Miami.\n\nPepsiCo Beverages North America\n\n‘She Is PepsiCo’ National Campaign Spotlights Women on the Frontline and Illustrates Why Representation and Recognition Matters\n\nPepsi uses delivery trucks as ‘vehicles’ for honoring women employees\n\nPepsiCo Beverages North America used its most visible asset as a “vehicle” to honor 28 of its frontline women employees. The program’s success garnered honors for Employee Recognition/Reward Program in the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nTo honor 28 women frontline associates in the U.S. and Canada who work for PepsiCo Beverages North America, communicators borrowed a tactic from advertising, deploying the company’s most visible asset as the tribute’s centerpiece. Accordingly, photos of each of the 28 employees honored during “The She Is PepsiCo” campaign were wrapped around a delivery truck. Each truck was unveiled during a gala ceremony for local dignitaries, company officials and, of course, employees.\n\nNot only that, but each honoree received a diecast model of the truck that carried her image. Photos included views of the women working as forklift operators, machinists, quality control agents and, yes, delivery truck drivers.\n\nTo build awareness for the program, communicators created content in internal newsletters and social media posts. In addition, earned, owned, and social media campaigns about the frontline honorees were timed with International Women’s Day on March 8. More than 350 stories resulted. In addition, Pepsi executives posted on LinkedIn announcing the campaign, highlighting its efforts and the frontline women, furthering external awareness and strengthening internal support.\n\nThe resulting buzz promoted not only the women’s roles as supply chain leaders, but as exemplars of sustainability and their dedication to fellow employees and communities.\n\nThe effort also spurred recognition of the frontline women beyond the campaign. For example, in Cheverly, Md., the mayor gave honoree Lisa Little a key to the city and declared March 15 as Lisa Little Day. More than 11,000 company associates viewed campaign assets, which were highlighted during global town halls with PepsiCo Beverages North America’s CEO and became the most-watched webcast each quarter.\n\nCongratulations to PepsiCo, for this inspiring campaign.\n\nSyngenta\n\nSyngenta for FFA: Supporting the next generation in agriculture\n\nFriendly competition helps Syngenta Resource Group smash fundraising goals\n\nFriendly competition between Syngenta divisions helped a resource group break fundraising records for FFA, formerly Future Farmers of America. That helped the Syngenta FFA resource group become its alumni chapter of the year and earned it honors in the Employee Resource Groups section of the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nMany Syngenta employees participated in FFA throughout high school and college. So, in 2022, senior management easily approved the creation of a Syngenta Alumni and Supporters Business Resource Group.\n\nSyngenta’s Dawn Dietz, head of North America Seeds Sales Service Operations, became the resource group’s first leader. The group’s initial target was fundraising for Give FFA Day, a 24-hour period during which FFA members, alumni and supporters donate and solicit funds for the organization. Donations of all sizes are magnified when they become part of this larger giving effort.\n\nFor the resource group’s initial Give Day, Dietz and her team ensured all Syngenta U.S.-based employees received awareness-raising content. The materials included a brief history of FFA and how anyone can support the organization with time and/or funds. The team announced a donation goal of $10,000, along with an online link and encouraging words. More than double that amount — $25,000 — was raised, with Syngenta coming in second in corporate donations.\n\nAs you can imagine, this fired up the resource group for 2023’s FFA Give Day. Dietz issued a challenge on video, pitting her Seeds division against the Crop Protection unit. Both Dietz and the Crop Protection region president created videos urging fellow employees to turn up the heat on the competition.\n\nThis time, Syngenta’s resource group set the target for Give Day at $25,000. Some 240 gifts resulted in a total of $103,085, helping FFA surpass its $500,000 goal as it received more than $700,000 in total, which will support the development and education of farming and agricultural students.\n\nFFA awarded the Syngenta resource group its Alumni Chapter of the Year honor at the November 2023 National FFA Convention. Congratulations to Syngenta.\n\nAres Management\n\nAres in Motion - Employee Engagement and Volunteer Program\n\nAres mounts comprehensive effort to prepare employees for charitable activities\n\nAs the pandemic subsided, Ares Management Corporation leaders decided a special effort was needed to encourage employees to resume volunteering, such as prior work done through its Ares in Motion program. The success of Ares’ work has resulted in an award from Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards in the Employee Volunteer Program section of the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category.\n\nAres Management Corporation, a global alternative investment manager, submitted its work in four areas of employee engagement.\n\nFirst, to promote engagement and volunteerism post-pandemic, Ares piloted Summer of Service (SoS), a 2022 effort centering on empowering employees to help their communities through volunteering. The company partnered with 25 nonprofits, which engaged 596 Ares employees as volunteers.\n\nAs with all its campaigns, Ares measured its efforts, partnering with True Impact, a social impact analytics firm.\n\nIn 2023, the pilot designation was removed — and an added twist saw senior executives participating. This demonstrated leadership buy-in and support that inspired team members worldwide. As a result, the number of SoS volunteers rose from 596 in 2022 to 866 in 2023 (a 45% increase).\n\nIn another effort, Ares encouraged staff to join nonprofit boards with a 2022 program that provided board training and placement. Ares collaborated with the firm BoardLead to recruit, match, train and support employees for nonprofit board service.\n\nTo date, 101 employees have participated, with 15 placed on nonprofit boards.\n\nA third program, “Community Conversations,” offers a virtual fireside chat series that exposes Ares employees to nonprofit leaders. Guest lecturers have included Dolores Huerta, founder of the Dolores Huerta Foundation, and Erin Gore, CEO of World Central Kitchen.\n\nLastly, Ares measured and documented its work, conducting a nine-month global study with Edge Research about the interplay of workplace volunteer programs on individuals’ professional development and skills. More than 5,000 employees in five countries were surveyed. A report titled “Philanthropy, Purpose and Professional Development: Why Workplace Volunteering Matters” includes quantitative and qualitative data examining how organizations and communities benefit from employee volunteerism.\n\nCongratulations to Ares Management Corporation and its Ares Charitable Foundation.\n\nTelemundo\n\nHealth & Wellness: Tu Bienestar\n\nTelemundo takes a holistic view of employee wellbeing\n\nThere’s little doubt the pandemic shined a spotlight on employees’ relationship with the office, and to address that, NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises focused on improving the physical and mental health of staff at its Telemundo Center headquarters in Miami. Adding healthy food choices, meditation classes and massages are among the reasons Ragan is honoring Telemundo in the Employee Wellbeing Program section of the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives category of the 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nIt’s a given that physically and mentally healthy employees improve morale and are more productive. In addition, staff appreciate when their employer provides tools for making healthy choices. That was some of the thinking behind NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises’ healthy lifestyle effort.\n\nTelemundo approached this from a holistic viewpoint. So, in addition to offering healthier choices in the employee cafeteria, Telemundo provided educational content about nutrition, mental health and exercise.\n\nSpecifically, Telemundo offered a range of nutritious meal choices, and immune-boosting wellness shots were also available. During National Nutrition Month, it provided complimentary fruit for employees. Incidentally, this was so well received, it’s become a 365-day program.\n\nActivity programs include sound bowl meditation, breathwork and chair yoga. Again, owing to demand, those classes now are offered bi-weekly. Moreover, the employee newsletter and internal site include health and wellness information, including a Zen, Health and Wellness section.\n\nThe monthly speaker series has touched on goal setting, holistic health and overcoming negative thinking. And Telemundo has enhanced its physical space, adding a Zen Lounge and an outdoor green space (which can fit up to 100 people) in 2023. While employees are visiting the green space, they can consult their Calm App, which Telemundo offers for free, along with a slew of health-related tools and activations, including a 24-hour gym discount, massages and counseling.\n\nWith all these options, it’s important Telemundo has flexible scheduling, allowing staff to accommodate fitness routines or attend wellness workshops during the workday. The results have included employees reporting reduced stress levels through focus groups and post-event surveys. On top of all that, demand for wellness programming has increased 200% since 2022.\n\nCongratulations to all of NBCUniversal Telemundo Enterprises.\n\nProvidence\n\nCo-Caring Nursing Model\n\nCovenant communicates the advantages of its remote nurse program\n\nA successful collaboration is less meaningful when it’s not communicated. Fortunately for Covenant Medical Center and health system Providence, a successful pilot program that inserted a remote nurse was communicated internally and externally, leading it to be recognized in the Hybrid Workplace Strategy subcategory in the Employee Experience Campaigns/Initiatives of Ragan’s 2024 Employee Communications Awards.\n\nWhile it’s hard to believe, some organizations still doubt communication is important for success. The collaboration between Covenant Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, and Providence offers evidence of communication’s importance.\n\nThe collaboration was a hybrid strategy for alleviating the nursing shortage and improving patient/caregiver experiences. Its tactics were relatively simple: p"
