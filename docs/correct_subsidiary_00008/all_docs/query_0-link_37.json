Ratings may be subject to change.\n\nPortfolio Positioning as of 03/31/2024\n\nWe continue to focus on carry opportunities during the period as yields remain elevated. In an environment of “higher for longer”, our primary focus has been identifying investment opportunities with attractive carry. We view CCCs as an attractive source of carry; with much of the investor base crowded in the safety of BBs, we are finding better value in lower-rated credits. The Fund remains primarily overweight single-Bs relative to the benchmark, while underweight BBs. We see strong relative value in the loan market relative to high yield given the yield differential of loans over bonds.\n\nWe have added exposure to cyclical areas given recent economic and consumer resilience. We are focused on consumer resiliency, short-dated refinancing candidates, high carry, and selective cyclical exposure. The top two sector allocations remain Technology and Healthcare, which have benefited from shifts in secular trends following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we have recently been adding to sectors such as Services and Basic Industry which present cyclical exposure that should benefit from continued economic growth in the U.S. On the other hand, we reduced allocations to sectors like Media, Consumer Goods and Utilities over the period.\n\nWe remain constructive on bank loans which have benefitted from a moderation in inflation and resilience in consumer spending. We believe that the impact of prior rate hikes is now largely reflected in issuer financials, yet we expect higher carry from elevated short-term rates to continue. Normally, a decline in policy rates has been associated with lower investor interest in floating-rate exposures, but we believe the demand generated by the CLO investor base and historic CLO issuance will continue to provide a meaningful technical tailwind. However, we remain wary of the lowest tier of risk given the high volume of liability management exercises from issuers and lenders alike which we expect to continue to meaningfully weigh on recoveries.\n\nPortfolio Details as of 06/28/2024\n\nTotal Net Assets\n\n$5.15 B\n\nAverage Effective Duration\n\n0.23 Years\n\nAverage Maturity\n\n5.3 Years\n\nAverage Modified Duration\n\n0.5
