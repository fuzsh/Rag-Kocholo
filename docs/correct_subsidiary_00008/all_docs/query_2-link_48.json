The team elaborated on the methodology employed and the rationale behind the reorganization, aiming to bring resources closer to the classroom and offer more direct support for student learning. While not explicitly questioned about the District Accountability Committee and School Accountability Committees, the team managed to provide insights into the collaborative efforts underway between the community and the school district."
