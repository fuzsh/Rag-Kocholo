        "text": "MEALS\n\nOn the Mt. Rainier Four Day Climb, you will need three days of climbing food, including three mountain lunches, one dinner, and one breakfast while on the mountain.\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nNutrition while training and nutrition while climbing are two very different things. You may follow a specific nutrition regimen while training to aid your desired outcomes, but once it comes to the climb, calories are what count the most. While climbing, you are trying to maximize energy and performance over a short period of time.\n\nOur food priorities when climbing are:\n\na high-calorie intake\n\na variety of flavor profiles (sweet, salty, sour, etc.)\n\ndurability/packability\n\nenjoyment\n\nCaloric requirements will vary widely from climber to climber based on physical size and metabolism. It is important for you to know what your body requires. One of the normal, albeit disconcerting, adjustments to altitude is a slight loss of appetite. Bring food you enjoy. If you don't love a food at home, you certainly won't like it on the mountain!\n\nAt Camp Muir, hot and cold water will be provided for your meals, drinks, and refilling water bottles. When planning your menu, don't bring any items that require extensive preparation, cooking, or simmering. We are able to provide you with boiling water but do not have the ability to actually cook food items.\n\nThings to keep in mind as you plan your meals:\n\nHow much space the food will take in your backpack\n\nHow well the food will hold up throughout the trip in your backpack\n\nHow much waste does the food produce\n\nConsider repacking items into smaller Ziploc bags to minimize the space in your pack. Your food will get crammed into your backpack, jostled around, exposed to extreme temperatures, and even sat on (by you, of course!). What holds up better in these conditions, two slices of bread or a bagel? When packing, it is essential to consider the waste you will produce on the climb; after all, you have to carry it off the mountain. We've already mentioned repacking items to minimize space. Repacking items can also eliminate waste!\n\nMOUNTAIN LUNCHES\n\nMountain lunches, aka snacks, are eaten during short breaks throughout the day. We continually snack to keep our energy levels up while we climb. We typically take rest breaks every hour or so to adjust our clothing layers, eat, and hydrate. Avoid packing any items that require preparation or hot water at each break. In terms of quantity, aim to bring 1 lb. of climbing food per day. We suggest using snack or sandwich size Ziploc bags to portion out snack food.\n\nThe importance of having foods that you genuinely enjoy cannot be overstated. Eating properly is the key to maintaining strength while in the mountains. To combat the loss of appetite at altitude, we aim to have a variety of foods that stimulate the whole palate, from sweet to sour to salty. See the sample menu and packing list below for ideas!\n\n• Cold pizza • Bagel sandwich • Tortilla wraps • Chips • Trail mix • Peanut butter pretzels • Chocolate covered pretzels • Apple slices • Crackers • Cookies • Candy bars • Protein bars • Chewy candy • Veggies and hummus PRO TIP:\n\nFeel fancy! Charcuterie (cured meat, cheese, and crackers) makes a great mountain lunch!\n\nBreakfast\n\nSingle-serving instant oatmeal, Cream-of-Wheat, or granola make a good main course fare. A variety of granola bars, pastries, fruit, and a hot drink mix of coffee, tea, cocoa, or cider are suggested. Plan on eating a breakfast that tastes good and that you find filling. See the sample menu and packing list below for additional ideas!\n\n• Instant hot cereal (Oatmeal, Cream-of-Wheat, Cream-of-Rice, etc.) • Granola or cereal • Freeze-dried breakfast (Mountain House, Peak Refuel, Mountain Zora, and Katadyn's Alpine Aire all have breakfast options) • Add-ins such as individual servings of peanut butter or honey, raisins or craisins, or a few tablespoons of powdered milk can put your mountain cereal game over the top. PRO TIP:\n\nThink outside the box. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (on bagels) or ramen make great breakfast options!\n\nDinner\n\nThis meal will give your body the initial fuel it needs during your summit attempt. Spend time considering your options so that you go to bed nourished and ready for the climb ahead of you. Freeze-dried entrees are very convenient mountain dinners. Pay attention to the caloric quantity – it varies from meal to meal. See the sample menu and packing list below for more ideas!\n\n• Freeze-dried entrée (Mountain House, Peak Refuel, Mountain Zora, and Katadyn's Alpine Aire have a wide variety of options) • Instant soups (including Cup-o'Noodles and ramen) • Cold pizza • Cold fried chicken • Pasta salad • Bagel sandwich PRO TIP:\n\nHave a tasting party of freeze-dried entrees to test them out before your climb.\n\nBEVERAGES\n\nStaying hydrated on the climb is crucial. You will have access to ample cold water while at camp for drinking and replenishing water bottles. When climbing, you will want to ration how much water you drink at each rest break to ensure you have water throughout the entirety of your climb. You can expect breaks to occur approximately every hour or so of climbing.\n\nJust as with food, it is important to have a variety of things to drink that excite your taste buds. You may love water, but it may not sound good at 10,000'! Drink mixes such as Gatorade, Kool-Aid, Liquid IV, Nuun, etc., are great for flavor. Hot beverage options are also an important component to consider while at camp. Coffee, tea, cocoa, and cider are great ways to warm up in the evening before bed, when you wake up for your alpine start on summit day, and to recharge once back at camp.\n\n• Drink Mixes (Gatorade, Kool-Aid, Liquid IV, and Nuun are great for flavor variety) • Instant Coffee (Starbucks Via is a great option for being pre-portioned) • Assorted Tea • Instant Cocoa • Instant Cider PRO TIP:\n\nSkip the water bladder and practice rationing your water while training.\n\nSAMPLE MENU\n\nThis is an example of what someone may eat for each meal on the Mt. Rainier Four Day Climb. Use this to guide and inspire your own meal planning.\n\nDAY 1 — ORIENTATION | NO MOUNTAIN MEALS NEEDED DAY 2 — MOUNTAINEERING DAY SCHOOL | 1 MOUNTAIN LUNCH • Bagel sandwich with salami, cheese slices, and mustard • Apple slices • Oreos • Protein bar DAY 3 — CLIMB TO CAMP MUIR | 1 MOUNTAIN LUNCH, 1 DINNER Lunch, in several parts • Salami, cheese, crackers • Hummus and crackers • Peanut butter pretzels • Goldfish • Sour Patch kids • Trail mix • Candy bar • Chips Dinner • Mountain House beef stroganoff • Veggies and hummus • Hot cocoa DAY 4 — SUMMIT DAY AND DESCENT | 1 BREAKFAST, 1 MOUNTAIN LUNCH Breakfast • Instant oatmeal with one packet of honey, one packet of peanut butter, and some raisins • Coffee Lunch, in many parts • Salami, cheese, crackers, or bagel (sandwich) • Hummus and crackers • Peanut butter pretzels • Goldfish • Sour Patch kids • Trail mix • Candy bar • Apple slices • Protein bar • Chips\n\nSAMPLE PACKING LIST\n\nThis is an example of quantities when thinking about packing the food listed in our Sample Menu. While it is important to keep in mind space and weight, it is also important to pack enough food. When in doubt, err on the side of packing more food. Better to take food off the mountain with you than to go hungry. Besides, you can always share or trade food with your teammates! Use this packing list as a guide for your own meal packing so you won't forget anything (a salami sandwich without mustard is a sad sandwich).\n\nZiploc bags (sandwich size) for portioning food\n\nBagels (2 – 3)\n\nSalami, pre-sliced (1 package)\n\nCheese, pre-sliced (1 package)\n\nOreos or other cookies* (1 – 2 lunch-size packs or about 8 Oreos)\n\nChips (2 small lunch-sized bags)\n\nApple slices (1 apple)\n\nPeanut butter pretzels or crackers* (enough to portion into 2 Ziplocs)\n\nCandy Bars (2 – 3 assorted), ones with nuts/peanut butter and chocolate, are great for combining quick energy and lasting energy\n\nGoldfish* (enough to portion into 2 Ziplocs)\n\nChewy candy such as Starbursts or Sour Patch Kids (1 – 2 packages)\n\nTrail mix* (enough to portion into 2 Ziplocs). Target and Trader Joe's have excellent trail mix options\n\nM&Ms (1 – 2 bags), great for snacking or for adjusting the chocolate-to-nut ratio in your trail mix\n\nCrackers* (enough to portion into 1 – 3 Ziplocs)\n\nHummus (2 individual packets)\n\nFreeze-dried dinner entrée\n\nVeggies such as carrots and celery* (enough for 1 Ziploc)\n\nInstant oatmeal (2 packets)\n\nEnergy Gels or Chews (5 – 6 total)\n\nGranola and/or Protein Bars (2 – 3 bars)\n\nHot cocoa (1 – 2 packets)\n\nTea (1 – 2 packets)\n\nInstant coffee (1 – 2 packets)\n\nNuun (2 – 3 packets or tablets)\n\nCondiments\n\nMustard (1 – 3 individual packets)\n\nMayo (1 – 3 individual packets)\n\nHoney (1 packet)\n\nPeanut butter (1 pouch)\n\nRaisins (1 kids lunch size box)\n\nSugar, as needed for your coffee/tea\n\nInstant creamer, as needed for your coffee/tea\n\n*Portion these items into Ziploc bags for snacks. This will allow you to pull them out easily during our rest breaks to refuel your body.\n\nPRO TIP:\n\nPackage your sandwiches without the condiments into a Ziploc bag. Add the condiments (in their individual packets to the bag). When it's time to eat, pull out the one bag, top your sandwich with the condiments, and enjoy!\n\nGUIDE PICKS\n\nRMI Guides climb A LOT. They've eaten a lot of food in the mountains and know what food they absolutely LOVE and what to leave behind. Here are some of their favorite foods to pack:\n\nJames Bealer\n\n\"I don't go on a climb without packing lots of Oreos!\"\n\nPete Van Deventer\n\n\"I am a big fan of baguette sandwiches. Prosciutto, brie or a good hard cheese, slices of cucumber, and a touch of butter on the bread!\"\n\nDominic Cifelli\n\n\"Anything fresh, pizza, a sub, some fruit, etc. That's how I stay on top of my game in the mountains.\" OR \"Anything I'd crave on my couch at home. Chips, chocolate, and cheese. If I wouldn't eat it at home, I probably wouldn't want it at altitude!\"\n\nJackson Breen\n\n\"I like to have something salty and savory to compliment the sweeter options. My go-to is leftover nachos wrapped in tin foil. Make sure you leave the sauce out, or you'll have a soggy mess on your hands!\"\n\nBEN LUEDTKE\n\n\"I bring a Twinkie with me on every climb to the summit. And I never forget my baby Nalgene with coffee for the first portion of the climb!\"\n\nDustin Wittmier\n\n\"Caffeinated Nuun tablets! They make water more palatable, and I prefer the caffeinated variety for a boost in the middle of the night.\"\n\nWhittaker Mountaineering Meal Packages: Well-Balanced Meals Designed By Climbers For Climbers\n\nReserve Your Meal Package\n\nPayments\n\nDeposit Payments: A non-refundable deposit payment of $450 per person secures your reservation.\n\nDeposit payments may be made via MasterCard, Visa, American Express*, e-check/ACH, check from a U.S. bank, or wire transfer**.\n\n**Wire transfers must cover all fees charged by your bank.

Credit/debit cards are not accepted for payments of $10,000 or more.\n\nCancellation\n\nThe $450 per person deposit is non-refundable and non-transferable.\n\nAll cancellations require written notification. Once the RMI Office receives your written notification of cancellation, the following policy applies:\n\nIf you cancel 120 or more days before the start of your program, the $450 per person deposit will not be refunded.\n\nIf you cancel less than 120 days before the start of your program, no refunds or credits will be issued.\n\nDue to the time-sensitive nature of these programs, and the amount of preparation time required for this program, we strictly adhere to our policy and cannot make exceptions for any reason.\n\nCancellation Insurance\n\nWe highly recommend travel insurance for this trip. Please see our Travel Tab for details.\n\nChange of Date\n\nDate changes are subject to availability and apply only to the current climbing season. Date changes may be requested at anytime up to 90 days prior to your departure date for a $200 fee per person. No date changes are allowed less than 90 days before departure.\n\nRisk Management\n\nPlease clearly understand that mountaineering is inherently a hazardous sport. Managing risk is RMI’s number one priority. Our guides manage significant hazards inherent in mountaineering, but they cannot eliminate them. Objective hazards include rockfall, icefall, avalanches, slides or falls by individuals and rope teams on steeper slopes, weather-related problems including cold, heat, high winds, and other unnamed dangers that can occur while climbing.\n\nYou are choosing to engage in an activity in which guided and non-guided climbers have been injured and killed. While those accidents are indeed infrequent, they may occur at any time and be out of our control. We ask that participants acknowledge the risks and hazards of mountaineering and make their own choices about whether or not to engage in this activity.\n\nSummit Attempt\n\nRMI cannot guarantee that you will reach the summit. Weather, route conditions, your own abilities, or the abilities of other climbers may create circumstances that make an ascent unsafe, and you or your entire group may have to turn around without reaching the summit.\n\nFailure to reach the summit due to a person’s own lack of fitness or to any of the events associated with mountaineering (such as weather, route conditions, avalanche hazard, team dynamics, etc.) are not Rainier Mountaineering, Inc.’s responsibility and will not result in a refund, credit, or reschedule.\n\nParticipant Responsibilities\n\nMountaineering is both an individual challenge and a team endeavor. Each Participant is required to share in the responsibility of the safety and success of the team. For this reason, we ask that each Participant:\n\nPossess the necessary physical and mental fitness required for this program.\n\nReview and understand all program information.\n\nUpdate the RMI Office if there are any changes to your health or medical information before departure.\n\nBe properly attired and equipped as outlined in the Equipment List.\n\nAct in a considerate manner toward all team members.\n\nHelp minimize our environmental impact and follow appropriate Leave No Trace practices.\n\nDescribe yourself, honestly and accurately, in terms of fitness, health, skills, abilities, and equipment to your guide staff.\n\nCommunicate with your guide staff if there are any changes in your medications or health while on your program.\n\nAdhere to the advice of your guide staff.\n\nContinue to self-assess throughout the program, evaluating your fitness, health, skills, and abilities in terms of the demands required of the program.\n\nRMI reserves the right to dismiss the Participant from a program or to send the Participant to a lower altitude at any time if the RMI Guide Staff determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant is not physically, technically, or psychologically prepared for, or capable of participating in the program, or for any other reason that may compromise the safety, health, or well-being of the Participant or the entire group. If this decision is made, the Participant will not receive any refunds or credits and will be financially responsible for all additional costs associated with an early departure, including, but not limited to, evacuation, transportation, hotel reservations, meals, etc.\n\nZero Tolerance Harassment Policy\n\nRMI does not tolerate harassment or mistreatment of our participants or employees. Inappropriate conduct under this policy may include conduct that creates a disrespectful, intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating, or offensive environment for a participant or employee. Engaging in such conduct is a violation of this policy.\n\nRMI may consider conduct to violate the policy even if it falls short of unlawful harassment under applicable law. When determining whether conduct violates this policy, we will consider whether a reasonable person could conclude that the conduct created an intimidating, hostile, degrading, or demeaning environment.\n\nViolating this policy may result in removal from a program and refusal to provide services indefinitely. We place the utmost value on the safety of our participants and employees. Please report any incidents to RMI management.\n\nAge requirements\n\nAll participants must be 18 years old at the time of registration.\n\nPhoto Release\n\nRMI’s Photo Release outlines the terms and conditions for using your likeness in photographs, videos, or other digital media.\n\nI hereby grant Rainier Mountaineering, Inc. (RMI) or its affiliates permission to use my likeness in a photograph, video, or other digital media (“photo”) in any and all of its publications, including web-based publications. By granting permission, you allow RMI to utilize these media for lawful purposes.\n\nHere are the key points:\n\nAuthorization: You authorize RMI to edit, alter, copy, exhibit, publish, or distribute the photos.\n\nOwnership: All photos become the property of RMI and will not be returned.\n\nCompensation: You will not be compensated for these uses.\n\nRights: RMI exclusively owns all rights to the images, videos, and recordings and to any derivative works created from them.\n\nWaiver: You waive the right to inspect or approve printed or electronic copies.\n\nRelease: You release Rainier Mountaineering, Inc. and its assigns and licensees from any claims arising from these uses, including defamation, invasion of privacy, rights of publicity, or copyright.\n\nHold Harmless: You hold harmless, release, and forever discharge RMI or its affiliates from any and all claims, demands, and causes of action which I, my heirs, representatives, executors, administrators, or any other persons acting on my behalf or on behalf of my estate have or may have by reason of this authorization.\n\nGeneral Policies\n\nRMI’s program schedule and itineraries are subject to change or adjustment based on a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, route conditions, weather, group strength, terrain, other environmental factors, and many other factors. RMI has complete discretion to change plans to accommodate any of these or other factors, including but not limited to increases in program fees, changes to program schedule or itinerary, and changes to guides or staff, as necessary for the proper and safe conduct of the program. Once the program has started, the Lead Guide will decide on any changes to the itinerary, including ending the program early if the continuation of the program may compromise the safety, health, or well-being of the group.\n\nWe reserve the right to cancel any program due to inadequate signups, weather, route conditions, or for any other reason. In such a case, we will make every effort to reschedule the Participant on a different program date. If rescheduling is not possible, we will issue the Participant a refund for all program fees paid to RMI, less any non-refundable payments made on behalf of the Participant in preparation of the program and prior to the cancellation of the program. These non-refundable portions of the program include, but are not limited to, the Cost Recovery Fee and Entrance Fee paid to the National Park Service. RMI cannot be responsible for any non-refundable expenses the Participant incurred in preparation for the program (i.e., airline tickets, hotel reservations, rental cars, equipment purchases or rentals, etc.).\n\nOnce a program begins, there are no refunds or credits for weather-related cancellations or for a program that may end early due to weather, route conditions, or any other circumstances that may compromise the health, safety, or well-being of the group. Furthermore, if the Participant decides for any reason not to begin a program or to discontinue a program at any time, no refunds or credits will be issued. The Participant will be responsible for all additional costs associated with an early departure, including, but not limited to, evacuation, transportation, hotel reservations, meals, etc.\n\nLand Costs are provided as a package, and refunds or credits will not be issued for any unused costs.\n\nThe Participant understands and agrees that RMI assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any travel and hospitality services provided to the Participant by other companies in connection with the program, including, but not limited to, the services provided by airlines, hotels, rental cars, and transportation companies. In addition, RMI is not responsible for any act, error, omission, or any injury, loss, accident, delay, irregularity, or danger by a supplier of travel or hospitality services to the Participant in connection with the RMI program. The Participant will be responsible for all costs associated with any travel delays, missed connections, or missing baggage that requires additional arrangements (separate transportation, hotel accommodations, meals, etc.) to be made on your behalf for you or your baggage to rejoin the program."
