        "text": "Thank you for reading the mission status reports. For at least the next couple of decades, and probably much longer, Dawn's status is that this former interplanetary ambassador from Earth is an inert celestial monument to the power of human ingenuity, creativity, and curiosity in orbit around one of the alien worlds it unveiled, a lasting reminder that our passion for bold adventures and our noble aspirations to know the cosmos can take us very, very far beyond the confines of our humble home.\n\nAs we have been predicting for months, Dawn will deplete its supply of hydrazine propellant any day now. When it does, the spaceship will lose the ability to orient itself, so it will not be able to point its solar arrays at the Sun or its antenna at Earth. We described in the Aug. 21 Dawn Journal that this was most likely to occur between the middle of September and middle of October, but that it could be earlier or later. (The May Dawn Journal explained the reasons for the uncertainty in the exact data.) Now we can conclude with high confidence that the end will be later than that window! We still expect it to be very soon, but in the meantime, Dawn remains fully healthy.\n\nDawn relies on hydrazine propellant to control its orientation in the zero-gravity of spaceflight. The explorer will continue operating until the last of the hydrazine is spent, most likely in September or October. It will struggle briefly, but the long and successful mission will be at its end. A pair of Dawn Journals in August describe what will happen to the spacecraft, both right away and for decades to come, as well as the feelings that one member of the team (yours truly) may experience when this extraordinary extraterrestrial expedition concludes.\n\nAs Dawn thrust yesterday, its smooth orbital path took it briefly down to an altitude of about 75 miles (125 kilometers), the closest it has yet been to Ceres. Also, as the spacecraft maneuvers lower, it takes less time to complete each orbit. In the science orbit it left last week, one revolution required 37 hours. Today it takes about 28 hours for each loop around the dwarf planet. After thrusting concludes in the new orbit, it will take Dawn just over 27 hours for each revolution, as we explained in the April Dawn Journal.\n\nThe explorer has completed five of the ten planned revolutions of photography and spectroscopy. Each elliptical orbit around the dwarf planet takes one and a half days as the altitude ranges from about 280 miles (450 kilometers) up to 2,900 miles (4,700 kilometers). (The small difference between this minimum altitude and the one in the previous mission status report is a result of a refinement in how we present the orbital information in a nontechnical way. The orbit is exactly what mission controllers designed.)\n\nDawn is continuing to thrust with its ion propulsion system to lower its orbit around Ceres in preparation for taking new pictures and conducting other scientific observations next month. (The March Dawn Journal has an overview of the plan.) As explained in the April 17 mission status, this maneuvering makes each peak in the spacecraft's elliptical orbit lower than the one before. And in the April 5 mission status, we saw that the elliptical orbit reached 24,300 miles (31,900 kilometers) before ion thrusting began. Today Dawn will sail up to a peak again, but now it will be only 7,300 miles (11,800 kilometers).\n\nToday is the 211th anniversary of the discovery of Vesta, the first stop on Dawn's deep-space mission of exploration. For two centuries, that enigmatic world, the second largest in the main asteroid belt, appeared as little more than one of the myriad glowing jewels in the nighttime sky. In 2011-2012, Dawn transformed it into a complex, fascinating world, finding it to be more closely related to the terrestrial planets than to typical asteroids. Some of the discoveries are summarized here.\n\nIn its elliptical orbit around Ceres, Dawn will descend today from 14,300 miles (23,100 kilometers) to 12,200 miles (19,600 kilometers). It takes the spacecraft a month to complete one orbital revolution. At 12:01 AM PST tomorrow, the ship will glide silently over the terminator, the boundary between night and day on the dwarf planet. (You can visualize that boundary in more familiar terms if you are accustomed to being on a planet. If you were at that location on the terminator on Ceres, or the equivalent point on Earth or any other planet, it would be sunrise, where night turns to day as the planet rotates.)\n\nAs Dawn measures cosmic rays, it is ascending in its elliptical orbit. Its average altitude today is 22,300 miles (35,800 kilometers). For comparison, that is the altitude of geosynchronous orbit at Earth. In geosynchronous orbit, satellites circle Earth once per day, the same rate at which Earth turns on its axis. Because Ceres' mass (and hence the strength of its gravitational pull) and the length of its day are different from Earth's, synchronous orbital altitude around the dwarf planet is different. With the Cerean day of a little more than nine hours, synchronous orbit is 450 miles (720 kilometers). Dawn descended through that altitude in November 2015 and ascended past it in September 2016.\n\nIn its elliptical orbit around Ceres, Dawn dipped down to 3,280 miles (5,270 kilometers) on July 22. That is the closest it has come to its gravitational master since Nov. 29, 2016. The spacecraft spent more than eight months much lower than that, orbiting only 240 miles (385 kilometers) above the alien landscapes of rock, ice and salt. The flight team flew the probe higher to pursue ambitious new science objectives in three different sets of orbits (as described in October andNovember 2016 and May 2017).\n\nFollowing conjunction, when Dawn and Ceres moved far enough from the sun that reliable communications could be established this week, the spacecraft transmitted details of its condition and its activities during the period it was out of contact with Earth. The flight team verified that Dawn is healthy and has continued to execute its assignments at Ceres. The probe's primary responsibility now is still measuring cosmic rays so scientists can refine their measurements of the atomic constituents of the dwarf planet down to about a yard (meter) underground.\n\nMission controllers cannot communicate with Dawn now, as it is much too close to the Sun. The spacecraft is actually 3.7 times as far as the Sun, but from our terrestrial perspective, they are at practically the same place in the sky. Dawn is less than one solar diameter from the brilliant star. The May Dawn Journal describes this alignment, known as conjunction, and suggests how you can use the sun to direct your mind's eye at Earth's distant ambassador to the cosmos.\n\nAs Ceres (with its companion Dawn) and Earth move in their separate orbits around the sun, they are now on nearly opposite sides of our solar system's star, an alignment known as conjunction. From today until June 12, radio signals between Dawn and Earth may be distorted by passing close to the sun on their way back and forth. Therefore, communications are not reliable. The May Dawn Journal describes conjunction in more detail.\n\nThe team discovered the situation during a scheduled communications session on April 24, diagnosed the problem, and returned the spacecraft to its standard flight configuration, still with hydrazine control, on April 25. The failure occurred after Dawn completed its five-hour segment of ion thrusting on April 22 to adjust its orbit, but before the shorter maneuver scheduled for April 23-24. The orbit will still allow Dawn to perform its opposition measurements. The reaction wheel's malfunctioning will not significantly impact the rest of the extended mission at Ceres.\n\nThe Dawn operations team has been well prepared to deal with the loss of the reaction wheel. The spacecraft is outfitted with four reaction wheels. It experienced failures of one of the wheels in 2010, a year before it entered orbit around Vesta, and another in 2012, as it was completing its exploration of that fascinating world. (See issues with these devices). When a third reaction wheel stopped working this week, the spacecraft correctly responded by entering one of its safe modes and assigning control of its orientation to its hydrazine thrusters.\n\nTo complete its delicate orbital maneuvering, Dawn will adjust its trajectory. Based on the latest navigational data, the flight team has developed a plan to thrust with the ion engine for about five hours on April 22 and a little more than four hours on April 23-24. These trajectory correction maneuvers will bring the spacecraft's orbit closer to the line from the sun to Occator Crater on April 29, as described in the February Dawn Journal. When Dawn crosses that line, it will photograph the bright central region of the crater, and scientists will use the pictures to investigate detailed properties of the material on the ground. (See the March Dawn Journal for an explanation of the science behind this.)\n\nThe Dawn navigation team is studying the spacecraft's new orbit to determine whether a trajectory correction maneuver is needed. As always, they will use the probe's radio signal, from which they can determine Dawn's distance and its velocity toward or away from Earth (but not across the line of sight), as well as the ship's detailed records of its recent ion thrusting and every time it fired a hydrazine jet to control its orientation. (The hydrazine is never used to modify the orbit, because it is far less efficient than the ion engine, but it does alter the orbit a little.) Navigators also will use Dawn's photos of Ceres, taken on April 15 and very early today, which will help pin down its location in orbit.\n\nHigh above Ceres, Dawn is making good progress thrusting with its ion engine to swivel the plane of its orbit around the dwarf planet. Having reached the peak of its elliptical orbit this week, the spacecraft is starting to fall to lower altitude as Ceres exerts its relentless gravitational pull. Over the course of the day today, Dawn will descend from 32,930 miles (52,990 kilometers) to 32,780 miles (52,750 kilometers). The objective of the complex maneuvers (which are explained in detail in the February Dawn Journal) is to modify the ship's orbit so that it will pass through the line from the sun to the bright center of Occator Crater on April 29 at an altitude of 12,400 miles (20,000 kilometers). The March Dawn Journal explains how photographs from that special position may provide insight into the nature of the reflective material covering the ground.\n\nEarlier today, Dawn began 8.5 days of ion thrusting. This is the third and largest of the four maneuvers the spacecraft is executing to change its orbit around Ceres, as explained in theFebruary Dawn Journal. During this thrust period, Dawn will swivel its orbit by almost 90 degrees. These complicated orbital operations are designed to allow the probe to fly directly between the sun and Occator Crater's famous bright region. Photographs taken from that vantage point may allow scientists to discover properties of the material on the ground, even at the microscopic level. (See the March Dawn Journal for the science behind this remarkable capability.)\n\nRotating the plane of Dawn's orbit is most efficient when the spacecraft is at high altitude and traveling slowly. That's why the two previous maneuvers propelled the ship to high altitude. (The three diagrams in February may help clarify this.) Over the course of the day today, Dawn ascends from 32,810 miles (52,810 kilometers) to 32,950 miles (53,020 kilometers). As it soars higher and higher, the spacecraft is slowing down under Ceres' relentless gravitational pull. Just as a ball thrown high goes slowest at the peak of its arc, Dawn's average orbital velocity today is only 44 mph (71 kilometers per hour). At this low speed, the daily change in altitude is less than it has been recently. Therefore, we are rounding off the altitudes today to the nearest 10 rather than the nearest 100. On the night of April 5, Dawn will reach the crest of its orbit, 32,990 miles (53,090 kilometers) above the dwarf planet.\n\nDawn's orbit today carries the spacecraft from an altitude of 31,000 miles (49,900 kilometers) to 31,500 miles (50,700 kilometers). On March 28, the spacecraft took pictures of Ceres to help navigators plot its course in this highly elliptical orbit as accurately as possible. Their results are being incorporated into final preparations for the resumption of ion thrusting on April 4 to swivel Dawn's orbit. As described in the February Dawn Journal, this will be the third of four segments of maneuvering to allow the explorer to take special photos of Ceres at the end of April. Scientists will use the pictures to measure how bright the center of Occator Crater is when viewed along the same direction as the incoming sunlight. The March Dawn Journal explains how this can provide insight into fine details of the material on the ground.\n\nLast night, orbiting more than 8,900 miles (more than 13,400 kilometers) above Ceres, Dawn completed the second of four periods of ion thrusting. As explained and illustrated in the February Dawn Journal, after powering its way in orbit, the spacecraft now has so much momentum that it will coast upward for nearly a month. Over the course of the day today, the ship will sail from 9,100 miles (14,600 kilometers) to 11,100 miles (17,900 kilometers).\n\nOn March 8, Dawn began five days of ion thrusting. This is the second of four thrust periods the spacecraft is executing over two months. The maneuvering will change its orbit around dwarf planet Ceres to let the spacecraft fly through the imaginary line from Occator Crater to the sun at the end of April. Today Dawn reaches down to about 6,300 miles (10,200 kilometers), the lowest altitude of its current orbit, even as it is using its ion engine to fly higher. (For details, including diagrams of the orbit changes, see the February Dawn Journal.)\n\nDawn is continuing to measure cosmic rays to improve the accuracy of its measurements of Ceres' atomic composition. Today the ship's orbit takes it from 9,200 miles (14,800 kilometers) above Ceres to 8,400 miles (13,500 kilometers). Tomorrow night Dawn will be at the correct orbital location to begin the second segment of its ion thrusting maneuvers to change its orbit so it can make special measurements of the bright material in Occator Crater at the end of April. (The February Dawn Journal has the full story.)\n\nDawn smoothly executed its Ceres observations on Jan. 27, including the first photography in three months. The spacecraft transmitted its new spectra and some of the pictures to Earth on Jan. 30. Today it is beaming more of the pictures home. It will send the last of the data next week. Dawn is also continuing to perform its primary assignment of measuring cosmic rays to improve the census of the atomic species it made when it was at a lower altitude.\n\nIn a communications session with the Deep Space Network on Jan. 17, mission controllers observed that Dawn was in safe mode, as explained in the Jan. 19 mission status update.Shortly after that update was posted, the team guided Dawn out of safe mode. Since then, all telemetry confirm that it is healthy. The team radioed additional instructions on Jan. 20 and 21 to return the robotic probe to its standard configuration. Later this week, it will resume measuring cosmic rays to improve the quality of earlier measurements of nuclear radiation from the dwarf planet. Meanwhile, the investigation into the software glitch that triggered safe mode is continuing.\n\nDawn has been orbiting Ceres and measuring cosmic rays to improve the quality of earlier measurements of nuclear radiation from the dwarf planet. Throughout its nine-year interplanetary mission, the spacecraft's main computer has constantly performed calculations about its location in the solar system. On Jan. 14, software detected a discrepancy in those calculations and called for safe mode, a standard configuration used to ensure the spacecraft is safe and stable when it encounters conditions its programming cannot accommodate. During the next communications session with the Deep Space Network on Jan. 17, mission controllers observed that Dawn was in safe mode.\n\nThis morning Dawn completed a month of ion thrusting to change its orbit around Ceres. It is scheduled to initiate a telecommunications session this afternoon to report on its status. Navigators then will begin making accurate measurements of its orbit, but the spacecraft should be in an elliptical orbit that stays more than 4,500 miles (7,200 kilometers) above Ceres. From this altitude, it will be able to measure the cosmic ray noise in order to improve the data on Ceres' nuclear radiation it accumulated during eight months at an altitude of 240 miles (385 kilometers). (This is explained in the November Dawn Journal).\n\nOrbiting Ceres at an altitude of about 920 miles (1,480 kilometers), Dawn is traveling over the alien landscapes at about 400 mph (645 kilometers per hour). After ion thrusting concluded last week, navigators measured the parameters of the orbit very accurately. The actual orbit is so close to the planned orbit that the expected refinements in the timing of observations are unnecessary. To optimize the quality of the data to be collected, engineers are making small adjustments to the direction the spacecraft will point its sensors for some of the measurements. Science observations will begin on Oct. 16.\n\nDawn concluded its ascent on schedule last night by stopping its ion engine at 11:02:48 p.m. PDT. When it began the spiral climb on Sept. 2, the spacecraft was in a 5.4-hour orbit at an altitude of 240 miles (385 kilometers). Now it is in an 18.9-hour orbit about 920 miles (1,480 kilometers) above Ceres. Navigators will measure its orbital parameters carefully to pin down the details. Mission controllers will use the results to refine the timing of Dawn's new observations of the dwarf planet, which are scheduled to begin on Oct. 16.\n\nDawn is on course and on schedule as it uses ion engine #2 to spiral upward. The spacecraft's average altitude today is about 485 miles (780 kilometers). In a higher orbit, Dawn travels more slowly and each revolution takes longer. Yesterday the ship passed above the altitude at which it takes as long to circle Ceres as Ceres takes to rotate on its axis. One Cerean day is nine hours and four minutes. Now even higher, Dawn's orbit period has increased to more than nine-and-a-half hours.\n\nDawn is steadily raising its orbit, and all systems are functioning well. Shortly after 4:30 p.m. PDT today, the spacecraft will pause ion thrusting and rotate to point its main antenna to Earth for a telecommunications session with NASA's Deep Space Network. Mission controllers at JPL will transmit an updated flight plan to guide Dawn through the next week of maneuvering. Thrusting will resume about 4:00 a.m. tomorrow. This pattern is followed each week as the distant probe flies to its next science orbit. (We explained the reason for these regular updates here.)\n\nDawn has had another very productive week of operations, but it has still more to do. Occasionally Dawn executes small maneuvers with its ion engine to keep the orbit synchronized with the observation plans. These orbit maintenance maneuvers (OMMs) are always performed in two windows separated by eight or nine days. The first part of the latest OMM was on June 9. Today the spacecraft will complete the OMM, this time with two thrust segments. Starting about 4:00 PM, it will use its ion engine for a little over an hour, and then it will thrust once more for 44 minutes starting shortly after 1:00 AM tomorrow. The combined effect of all three thrust segments is to change Dawn's velocity by about 0.8 mph (1.3 kilometers per hour).\n\nEvery three weeks, the flight team evaluates Dawn's orbit to determine whether an adjustment is needed. These \"orbit maintenance maneuvers\" (OMMs) were described in the February Dawn Journal. Most of the OMMs have not been necessary and so were canceled. Now a small refinement is needed, and the first part will be executed this afternoon starting shortly after 4:00 PM. Dawn will thrust with its ion engine for about an hour. The spacecraft will perform more small maneuvers on June 17 and 18.\n\nDawn is completing another productive week of Ceres observations, taking pictures for topography and collecting spectra for the atomic and mineralogical composition. It will send more data to Earth on May 7-8. While pointing its camera and spectrometers at Earth, the spacecraft broadcasts a radio signal through an auxiliary antenna. That signal is used for precise tracking of Dawn's orbital motion to map the variations in Ceres' gravitational field, which provides insight into the interior structure of the dwarf planet. (All these methods of learning about Ceres have been described in recent Dawn Journals.)\n\nDawn's main computer is using software controllers installed five years ago this week, shortly before the spacecraft arrived at Vesta. And exactly two years earlier, they also loaded new software. (Follow the link to find out how you can get a copy of the software for your own use, or simply put your computer or smartphone in the main asteroid belt, send us the coordinates, and we'll install it for you.)\n\nThe spacecraft will start executing an orbit maintenance maneuver (OMM) shortly after 5:00 PM PDT today. It will thrust with its ion engine for a little more than two hours, and then about 1:00 AM PDT on April 2 will begin thrusting again for the same duration. Following that, Dawn will resume its observations of Ceres. The second half of the OMM will consist of two more thrust segments on April 9-10. (OMMs are explained in more detail in the February Dawn Journal.)\n\nDawn is healthy and continuing its observations of Ceres. After transmitting data to Earth on March 18 and 19, the spacecraft began a new set of measurements. Now, instead of looking straight down, it is pointing its sensors a little bit to the left as it circles Ceres. This provides a slightly different perspective on the alien landscape and may reduce the rate at which the probe consumes its dwindling hydrazine propellant. (Hydrazine is essential for Dawn's operation.)\n\nAs the flight team was working on the details of the orbit maintenance maneuvers described in the March 7 status report, they determined that the current orbital parameters are satisfactory. Therefore, rather than take the spacecraft's time away from observing Ceres to perform the maneuvers to achieve a small improvement in the orbit, they have decided to let it continue to point its sensors at the dwarf planet without these interruptions.\n\nDawn's exploration of Ceres is continuing to go extremely well. As explained in the February Dawn Journal, the flight team occasionally needs to adjust the spacecraft's orbit to keep it synchronized with the intricate plans for observing the dwarf planet. They have now determined that Dawn should perform a set of \"orbit maintenance maneuvers\" for this purpose. Mission controllers are now working on the details to send to the spacecraft, and it will use its famously efficient ion engine to thrust for almost 1.5 hours on March 9, then wait for 6.5 hours and then thrust again for shortly over an hour on March 10. It will perform two additional maneuvers on March 17 of just over an hour and just under an hour, with two hours between them.\n\nTomorrow is the seventh anniversary of Dawn flying past Mars, robbing the Red Planet of some its orbital energy around the sun in order to help fling the spacecraft on its way to more distant and exotic destinations. Dawn achieved a cosmic bull's-eye in gaining that gravitational boost. The equivalent change in the spacraft's speed was 5,800 mph (9,400 kilometers per hour). In exchange Mars slowed down by a rate of one inch (2.5 centimeters) per 180 million years to keep the solar system's energy account balanced. Dawn has been to four planetary bodies, starting on Earth in 2007, sailing past Mars in 2009, orbiting protoplanet Vesta in 2011-2012, and residing since last year at dwarf planet Ceres, its final home.\n\nApproximately every three weeks, the flight team analyzes the spacecraft's orbit to determine whether to adjust it with the ion engine. (We mentioned this in the mission status reports on Jan. 19 and 21, and the February Dawn Journal will include an explanation.) Based on their latest assessment, Dawn's orbit continues to be so good that no minor corrections are warranted. The present orbital parameters match very well with the plans for new pictures and spectra. This is the second time in a row that \"orbit maintenance maneuvers\" were deemed unnecessary.\n\nDawn has photographed about 90% of Ceres from this low altitude orbit. Many people who share our fascination with that distant alien world ask about new pictures of the famous bright area (or famously bright area) at the center of Occator crater, but Dawn has not observed it yet. That is just the way the orbit has worked out. Mission planners did not design the orbit or the schedule of observations and telecommunications to view any specific targets. Rather, as mentioned in the January Dawn Journal, the team designed them so that over the course of six weeks, the probe would see most of the surface. As we will see in the February Dawn Journal, the first few weeks of LAMO don't contribute to this pattern, so the beginning of the six week period was January 10. By simple coincidence, Dawn will not have the opportunity to see Occator until the very end of that period. Therefore, we all wait patiently. After Occator is photographed, the standard process for releasing images will be followed. The need for accuracy and scientific review of the data sometimes slows the release of some products, but all of the data are released to the public after the science team has performed the necessary analysis and interpretation for scientific publication. It will be worth the wait!\n\nOne year ago today, the spacecraft was 147,000 miles (237,000 kilometers) from Ceres, using its ion engine to approach the alien world. Later in the day, it took its second set of pictures to navigate to the uncharted destination. Those were its photos to surpass the resolution provided by the Hubble Space Telescope. Now Dawn's sharp pictures show about 830 times the detail that Hubble's images revealed. The Jan. 29, 2015, Dawn Journal described the navigation pictures and even looked ahead to the improvement we would achieve in the current low altitude orbit. The last year has been a fantastic period of discovery.\n\nThe spacecraft's orbit around the dwarf planet is close enough to what mission planners had specified for this period that it is not necessary to perform the pair of orbit maintenance maneuvers described in the Jan. 19 mission status update. Instead, the spacecraft will continue pointing its sensors at Ceres during the windows that were scheduled for the maneuvers. The next decision on whether to perform orbit maintenance maneuvers will be in three weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, the flight team is using the latest navigational measurements to determine Dawn's orbit very accurately and calculate what it will be for the next few weeks. Based on these and other analyses, the mission director will decide tomorrow whether Dawn should perform an orbit maintenance maneuver. If so, mission planners already have windows in Dawn's intricate schedule on Jan. 23-24 and Jan. 31-Feb. 1. (Orbit maintenance maneuvers in this low altitude orbit are always done in pairs separated by about eight days.)\n\nAfter completing its orbit maintenance maneuver on Jan. 8, Dawn spent much of the weekend with its main antenna aimed at Earth as it revolved around Ceres, beaming its latest data to NASA's Deep Space Network. Then around 9:00 AM PST on Jan. 10, the spacecraft turned to point its science instruments at the ground beneath it and resumed its program of observations of the dwarf planet. It will continue until 7:00 PM PST on Jan. 13, when it is scheduled once again to start transmitting the precious measurements stored in its memory.\n\nAfter devoting much of the week to observing Ceres, Dawn will execute a pair of burns with its ion engine today to modify its orbit. Starting a little after 1:00 PM, the ship will thrust for less than two hours, wait about six hours as it continues to revolve around Ceres and then thrust again for less than two hours, finishing around 11:00 PM. With its uniquely efficient and gentle ion engine, these small orbit maintenance maneuvers will keep the explorers' orbital motion aligned with the plan the flight team has devised for systematically studying the alien world from this low orbital altitude of 240 miles (385 kilometers). Dawn will spend most of the weekend sending its pictures and other data to Earth. When it has finished on the morning of Jan. 10, it will begin collecting still more data.\n\nAfter using its ion engine for almost 11 hours on Dec. 31 - Jan. 1 to adjust its orbit slightly, keeping it synchronized with the plan for mapping Ceres, the spacecraft resumed its observations. Since then, it has been taking more pictures and measuring spectra of infrared light and two kinds of nuclear radiation. It has also been sending a radio signal that engineers and scientists use to track its orbit in order to map the interior structure of the dwarf planet. (The radiation and orbit measurements are explained in the most recent Dawn Journal.)\n\nOn Dec. 14, mission controllers activated Dawn's two operable reaction wheels to help conserve hydrazine propellant for pointing and turning the spacecraft. The plan to keep the wheels off until now was devised in 2013 following the failure of the other two wheels in 2010 and 2012. Since then, the wheels have been powered on only for a test of the current control scheme (explained in the November 2013 Dawn Journal) and routine maintenance. They are performing well, but engineers understand that the other two gave no indications of any problems until immediately before they faltered. As long as the wheels do function, they will provide a bonus reduction in hydrazine use.\n\nLater today mission controllers will power on two of Dawn's reaction wheels. (Two others failed in 2010 and 2012.) Engineers cannot confidently predict how long the two units will operate, but as long as they do, they will reduce the expenditure of hydrazine propellant, extending the spacecraft's lifetime in this final phase of the mission. When either one fails, Dawn will return to using only hydrazine to control its orientation. (The November Dawn Journal explains this in more detail.)\n\nYesterday while the flight team was preparing Dawn's flight plan, the spacecraft tested its backup camera. Controllers occasionally run the camera through a series of tests to verify that it remains in good condition should the primary camera have a problem. (The test of the camera was performed eight years to the day after its first operation in space.) Although the results have not been analyzed in detail yet, all indications are that the backup is in excellent condition.\n\nDawn completed ion-thrusting on schedule on Dec. 7 and continues to be healthy and operating well in its new orbit. Over the last two days, the flight team has determined that the spacecraft did an excellent job in maneuvering to its planned orbit at an average altitude of 240 miles (385 kilometers). To match Dawn's orbital motion with the intricate plan for observing Ceres, the probe will use its ion engine to perform a small adjustment (known as a \"trajectory correction maneuver\") to the orbit. Long before the spiral descent began, engineers had calculated that such a maneuver was likely and already had a window planned for this purpose on Dec. 11-13. (This was described in the November Dawn Journal.) They are now developing the detailed flight plan for the spacecraft.\n\nDawn is scheduled to conclude ion-thrusting for its spiral descent shortly before noon today. At that time, it will be orbiting about 240 miles (385 kilometers) above Ceres, closer than the International Space Station is to Earth. After it turns to point its main antenna to Earth, navigators will begin to measure its orbital parameters very accurately. During the next two days, they will analyze the orbit carefully and decide on Dec. 9 whether to make an adjustment at the end of the week. (It is likely such a trajectory correction maneuver will be needed.) The November Dawn Journal explains this in more details.\n\nAll of Dawn's ion thrusting throughout its interplanetary journey of more than eight years has now provided the equivalent of 24,500 mph (39,400 kilometers per hour), far more than any spacecraft has achieved with its own propulsion system. Because of the principles of motion for orbital flight, whether around the sun or any other gravitating body, Dawn is not actually traveling this much faster than when it launched. See here for an explanation of this curious phenomenon.\n\nDawn transmitted the last of its measurements from mapping cycle #5 yesterday and started its sixth mapping cycle today at 1:40 a.m. PDT. Mapping cycle #6 will consist of 12 flights over the sunlit terrain, during which the explorer will aim its sensors at the scenery farther behind than in the third mapping cycle but not as far to the right. The pictures will add to scientists' determination of the topography of this alien world. This will be the last set of observations made at the current altitude of 915 miles (1,470 kilometers).\n\nMission controllers formulate the flight plan for the spirals with extra maneuvering time in case it's needed to stay exactly on course. The descent has been going so well that they instructed the spacecraft to coast for almost 23 hours on Aug. 9 and 10. Observations in the next mapping phase cannot begin early for several technical reasons, including the complexity of advancing the carefully timed computer instructions already prepared and the schedule for the Deep Space Network. Therefore, mission planners are keeping the ship close to the originally planned trajectory rather than getting ahead.\n\nToday the spacecraft is orbiting 1,600 miles (2,600 kilometers) above the ground. As with all of Dawn's complex maneuvers from each mapping orbit to the next, the spacecraft is not taking a perfect spiral path for technical reasons. The altitude does not change as much over the course of the day today as it does some other days. Nevertheless, the probe is accurately following its carefully designed course.\n\nIn lower orbits, the spacecraft circles Ceres more quickly, not only because the distance around the orbit is shorter but also because it travels faster in the dwarf planet's tighter gravitational grip. (For more on this, see this Dawn Journal explanation.) In the previous mapping orbit (at 2,700 miles, or 4,400 kilometers), it took slightly more than three days to complete one revolution. Now the orbital period is a little less than two days. When Dawn is in its next mapping orbit (at 900 miles, or less than 1,500 kilometers), each loop will take about 19 hours.\n\nOn June 30, shortly after turning on its ion engine to begin the gradual spiral down to the next mapping orbit, its protective software detected the anomaly. Dawn responded as designed by stopping all activities (including thrusting), reconfiguring its systems to safe mode and transmitting a radio signal to request further instructions. On July 1 and 2, engineers made configuration changes needed to return the spacecraft to its normal operating mode. The spacecraft is out of safe mode, using the main antenna to communicate with Earth.\n\nOn June 20, Dawn completed transmitting the results of its fifth set of observations. After 10:00 PM PDT that day, it traveled once again 2,700 miles (4,400 kilometers) over the terminator from the night side to the day side of Ceres. The probe is now collecting more pictures and spectra in infrared and visible. After its orbit takes it to the dark side later today, it will turn to point its main antenna to Earth to relay its latest results.\n\nDawn is now on its fifth flight over the sunlit side of Ceres in this phase of the mission. It is operating well as it takes more pictures and spectral measurements. The explorer will continue its observations until tomorrow morning when it will pass over the south pole. Then when it flies once again over the unilluminated side, it will send the data to Earth.\n\nDuring the fourth observing period on June 15, the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer’s internal computer detected an unexpected condition and stopped collecting data. The main spacecraft computer then powered the device off. The same events occurred in 2011 as Dawn was approaching Vesta. This time, as was the case four years ago, engineers and scientists concluded that the most likely cause was a cosmic ray strike. When it was powered back on for the fifth observing cycle, the spectrometer resumed normal operation.\n\nAs Dawn flew 2,700 miles (4,400 kilometers) over Ceres’ north pole this morning, the spacecraft passed from the night side to the day side of the dwarf planet. That marked the beginning of the new mapping phase, and Dawn began taking photos and making other measurements on schedule. Circling Ceres every 3.1 days, Dawn will make extensive scientific observations when it is over the sunlit side and will transmit its findings to Earth when it is over the side in darkness. The pictures will be three times as sharp as those from the first mapping orbit. This mapping phase is scheduled to continue for eight revolutions, providing plenty of opportunities to gather a wealth of data.\n\nDawn completed the maneuvering to reach its second mapping orbit and stopped ion-thrusting on schedule this morning. Since May 9, the spacecraft has reduced its orbital altitude from 8,400 miles (13,600 kilometers) to 2,700 miles (4,400 kilometers). The orbit period has correspondingly decreased from 15.2 days to 3.1 days. Dawn is scheduled to begin its new observations on June 5, as explained in the most recent Dawn Journal. First, however, the mission control team will measure the actual orbit parameters accurately and transmit them to the spacecraft.\n\nDawn remains in good health as it has been reshaping its orbit around Ceres. Today the spacecraft orbits from 3,100 miles (5,000 kilometers) up to 3,400 miles (5,500 kilometers) and then will start to descend again. Meanwhile, it paused ion-thrusting this afternoon to point its main antenna to Earth for a routine telecommunications session. Engineers have refined the flight profile based on analyses of the recent optical navigation pictures as well as measurements of the orbit from the radio signal and other data. Controllers are transmitting the new information to Dawn, and it will resume thrusting tomorrow.\n\nDawn remains on course for its complex flight from the first mapping orbit to the second. Last week, the spacecraft descended every day. After dipping down to 4,400 miles (7,100 kilometers) on May 17 and 18, now the ship is slowly ascending as it continues to reshape its orbit around the dwarf planet. It will sail up to nearly 5,200 miles (more than 8,300 kilometers) tomorrow before descending again.\n\nDawn is observing Ceres from the night side of the dwarf planet. On April 27 and 28, the spacecraft transmitted to Earth the data it had collected during its first science observations of the southern hemisphere. Its orbit is taking it north, and it passed over the equator on April 28. Although the ground directly beneath it is still in darkness, it is viewing the illuminated terrain of the northern hemisphere, much like a crescent moon.\n\nDawn is in the final stages of its approach trajectory to Ceres and will slip into orbit around the dwarf planet March 6, 2015. Dawn halted ion thrusting four times this month to take pictures of the dwarf planet for use in navigation. The spacecraft reached its closest distance to Ceres this past week. On Feb. 23 it was less than 39,000 kilometers (10% of the Earth-moon distance); Dawn will not be that close again until early April. This month's Dawn Journal and a new video: Destination Ceres: Breakfast at Dawn, explain Dawn's unique trajectory to Ceres and what we can anticipate when science orbits begin in April.\n\nDawn devoted November to ion thrusting, and it is now about three times as far from Ceres as the moon is from Earth. As Earth and Dawn follow their separate orbits around the sun, they are moving to opposite sides of the solar system's star. To learn how to use the sun to locate Dawn early in December, see the November Dawn Journal, which also describes the new route the spacecraft will take into orbit around the dwarf planet.\n\nDawn devoted November to ion thrusting, and it is now about three times as far from Ceres as the moon is from Earth.

To learn how to use the sun to locate Dawn early in December, see the November Dawn Journal, which also describes the new route the spacecraft will take into orbit around the dwarf planet.\n\nAs the spacecraft continues ion thrusting to reshape its orbit around the sun to match Ceres' orbit, it is moving ever closer to the dwarf planet. At the end of this month, Dawn is about 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers) from Ceres, closing in at less than 900 mph (0.4 kilometers per second). It is on course for arriving in orbit in early March 2015. A summary of the schedule for photographing Ceres during the approach phase in January and February is in the October Dawn Journal, and a more detailed description will be presented in November.\n\nThe spacecraft has completed another month of ion thrusting, bringing it ever closer to its rendezvous with Ceres. Dawn is now 3.0 million miles (4.8 million kilometers) from Ceres and approaching it at less than 1500 mph (2400 kilometers per hour). Dawn's fourth and final phase of orbital observations will be at 230 miles (375 kilometers) above the dwarf planet's surface. The three month low altitude mapping orbit is previewed in the August Dawn Journal, along with a brief look at what might happen after the conclusion of the planned mission.\n\nDawn continues its spiral outward from the sun, heading for Ceres. The spacecraft is gradually changing its orbit so that it matches Ceres's orbit around the sun. In a little more than a year, this will allow the probe to be captured by the dwarf planet's gravity. Thanks to its ion propulsion system, Dawn's gentle, graceful entry into orbit is very different from the tense, whiplash-inducing method used by conventional missions. To learn more, visit the latest Dawn Journal for the second in a series of previews of how the ship will accomplish its ambitious mission at the alien world of rock and ice.\n\nDawn is in an unusual part of its interplanetary trajectory during which coasting is preferable to ion thrusting. Engineers took advantage of this period to operate in a new \"hybrid\" mode, in which the spacecraft uses its two healthy reaction wheels plus its hydrazine-powered jets to control its orientation in space. This successful test paves the way for using hybrid when Dawn is in its lowest orbits at Ceres, where the system may extend the limited supply of hydrazine. Mission controllers also confirmed the health of the sensors that will investigate Ceres. Visit the Dawn Journal for details on Dawn's latest activities and intriguing milestones the spacecraft will pass in December.\n\nThe probe has thrust for 1,410 days so far in the mission, or 64 percent of the time since launch. Its effective change in speed is more than 8.7 kilometers per second (19,500 miles per hour), well in excess of what any other spacecraft has achieved under its own power. Thanks to the efficiency of the ion propulsion system, all this thrusting has consumed only 318 kilograms (701 pounds) of xenon propellant.\n\nDawn has devoted another month to thrusting with its ion propulsion system as it heads for Ceres. The spacecraft has now changed its speed by more than 7.7 kilometers per second (17,000 mph) since it was launched, far more than any other spacecraft. That's about the same that it takes for a rocket to go into Earth orbit, but that is not what Dawn's thrusting has accomplished, and it is not the spacecraft's speed. For an explanation of this extraordinary velocity change, see the latest Dawn Journal.\n\nDawn ended its extraordinarily successful 2012 by smoothly continuing to thrust with its ion propulsion system to its 2015 rendezvous with dwarf planet Ceres. In December, as Earth and Dawn followed their independent orbits, they were at their closest distance in more than a year. As the spacecraft continues its interplanetary adventure, you can locate its position in the sky using the moon as a guide on Jan. 21. For more details, see the most recent Dawn Journal.\n\nThe probe has thrust for 1,060 days so far in the mission, or 58 percent of the time since launch. Its effective change in speed is more than 7.1 kilometers per second (16,000 miles per hour), well in excess of what any other spacecraft has achieved under its own power. Thanks to the efficiency of the ion propulsion system, all this thrusting has consumed only 267 kilograms (587 pounds) of xenon propellant.\n\nOn August 25 - 26, at an altitude of 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles), Dawn pointed its instruments at Vesta one last time for some final bonus observations. It took pictures and made other measurements of the northern hemisphere to see a little more terrain that has become illuminated since Dawn's previous observations in July. As Vesta's seasons progress, the equinox was on August 20, so the sun is now north of Vesta's equator for the first time since Dawn has been at Vesta.\n\nControllers discovered the condition during a routine communications session on August 9. They are now replanning the departure and expect to resume ion thrusting at the end of next week. Escape from Vesta will be delayed by about 10 days, and then the spacecraft will be on its way to Ceres. (The flight from Vesta to Ceres was already planned to be performed with all the reaction wheels turned off.) To make up some of the time, most of the bonus departing observations will not be conducted.\n\nDawn has collected another complete set of images of the illuminated surface of Vesta. In this second of six planned mapping cycles, the spacecraft pointed the camera at an angle instead of straight down in order to acquire images for a topographical map. Today the probe began the third mapping cycle, now with the camera pointed both behind and a little to the left of the point directly beneath it. Dawn is continuing to acquire visible and infrared spectra as well. The strategy for mapping Vesta with new illumination is explained in the June Dawn Journal.\n\nDawn has resumed taking pictures of Vesta. As in the mapping performed in October 2011, the first five-day cycle of mapping will be conducted looking straight down. In addition, the spacecraft is continuing to scrutinize Vesta with its visible and infrared mapping spectrometer. In each orbit, lasting just over 12 hours, Dawn aims its instruments at the surface when it is over the day side of Vesta, and it points its main antenna to Earth to transmit the data when it is over the night side.\n\nDawn's complex spiral course from its low-altitude mapping orbit to its second high-altitude mapping orbit has been extremely smooth. It is now at the planned altitude of about 680 kilometers (420 miles). As described in the latest Dawn Journal, the spacecraft also needed to change the angle of its orbit plane from the sun, and that has been accomplished as well. Navigators now will make accurate measurements of the new orbit and then controllers will use the ion propulsion system to fine tune it to match exactly the conditions needed for the next intensive observation campaign, scheduled to begin on June 15.\n\nThe plan for Dawn's year at Vesta had the spacecraft spending 70 days in the low altitude mapping orbit. As explained in the January and February Dawn Journals, operations at Vesta have gone so well that the 40 days held as margin to resolve problems are still available. Therefore, they are being applied to extend this phase of the exploration of Vesta. Dawn's measurements are now going beyond what had been anticipated.\n\nAs the activities in the low altitude mapping orbit are intended to be highly repetitive, these mission status updates will be less frequent (thus saving your correspondent the effort of finding ways to restate what he wrote last week and this week). Updates will continue to be posted when events warrant and occasionally to reassure readers that the mission is continuing smoothly. More information about Dawn's work in this phase of the mission can be found in the Dawn Journals.\n\nOn Dec. 3, while the spacecraft was turning in preparation for a final brief period of ion thrusting to refine its orbit, protective software detected a discrepancy in the orientation and put the spacecraft into safe mode. The discrepancy was a result of the spacecraft computing and then using a turn rate that was slightly too high. The operations team quickly established that the spacecraft was healthy, and on Dec. 5 they commanded it out of safe mode.\n\nDawn is getting close to its targeted altitude of 210 kilometers (135 miles). Today it is at an altitude of about 245 kilometers (145 miles). In addition to lowering its altitude, the spacecraft has changed the plane of its orbit most of the way to the new target as well, and it is now less than one degree from the intended value. (See the latest Dawn Journal for an explanation of the shift in the orbital plane.)\n\nDawn has been continuing to change its orbit with its ion propulsion system. Today the spacecraft reaches down to an altitude of about 265 kilometers (165 miles). While more ion thrusting lies ahead to reduce the altitude, the craft will spend most of the time before its next science phase begins on December 12 using Vesta's gravity to change the orientation of its orbit. (The target altitude and orientation and the method of achieving them will be explained in the next Dawn Journal.)\n\nToday Dawn successfully concluded its fifth mapping cycle and the final one devoted to topographical mapping. It is now beginning the last mapping cycle of the high altitude mapping orbit. This sixth cycle is nearly identical to the first and was included in the plan in case there were problems with the the first. As it was successful, most of these observations will provide views very similar to the ones already returned.\n\nDawn has completed its second mapping cycle. Instead of pointing the instruments straight down, as in the first cycle, the spacecraft aimed them at an angle, simultaneously ahead and to the side as it orbited Vesta. The third cycle will acquire images at a different angle, with the craft pointing both back and to the side. During this topographic mapping, spectra continue to be acquired with the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer.\n\nDawn's mapping of Vesta from an altitude of about 680 kilometers (420 miles) is going very smoothly. It has completed its first cycle of 10 orbits in which the principal objective was to acquire images looking straight down. Today the spacecraft will begin a new cycle of observing the surface at an angle to provide images scientists will use to create topographic maps and stereo images. This mapping strategy is described in more detail in the September 27, 2010 Dawn Journal.\n\nDawn has observed Vesta during two passes over its illuminated face, each lasting about 34 hours. It acquired all the images planned with the camera. After the visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR) had successfully completed about 40% of its observations during the first orbit, its internal computer detected a temporary problem, so the rest were not performed. As explained in the latest Dawn Journal, plans included collecting more data than needed, so missing the observations is easily tolerated. During the subsequent communications session (while Dawn was over the night side), controllers verified the instrument was healthy and reconfigured it. VIR acquired all of the planned measurements during the second orbit. Scientists have confirmed that the data are of very high quality.\n\nDuring a communications session on July 20, engineers powered on the control unit that stopped operating valves on June 27. It had been off since then, with a different unit controlling the flow of xenon to the ion thruster. As they anticipated, the unit is now perfectly healthy, and it flawlessly completed all the tests they gave it. All evidence points to its temporary inability to control the valves as having been a result of a high energy particle of space radiation striking it. By turning it off and on again, the glitch was cleared. See the July 18, 2011 Dawn Journal for more details.\n\nOn June 27, an electrical circuit that controls valves in the system that feeds xenon propellant to the ion thruster stopped operating. Software detected the anomaly, halted the thrust, and canceled other planned activities to point the main antenna to Earth. Engineers discovered it during a routine communications session on June 28. After assessing the state of the spacecraft, they sent instructions to switch to a different valve control circuit and resume thrusting on June 30 following the receipt of the data from the Vesta observations. The change in the thrust schedule does not affect the plan for the intensive Vesta science observation phase, which begins in August.\n\nAs usual, Dawn thrust for most of the month, bringing its orbit around the sun still closer to Vesta's orbit. April 11 to 19 was planned as a coast period so controllers could load a new version of software to the spacecraft's main computer. The new software would allow the spacecraft to operate with only two reaction wheels in the event one of the three healthy wheels becomes inoperable. This was the fourth time the software has been upgraded in flight, and the entire procedure was executed flawlessly. The complex work was completed in only three days.\n\nDawn spent most of the month thrusting toward its Vesta rendezvous but stopped for the week of March 14 in order to perform several final tests. All of the science instruments were powered on and checked out, and each one proved to be in excellent condition. In addition, controllers updated the software in the two identical science cameras. One of the gamma-ray sensors was carefully heated for five days to restore its sensitivity after years of exposure to radiation in space.\n\nTo refine their measurements of the thrust from the ion propulsion system, engineers commanded Dawn to align a thruster with Earth. They stepped the thruster through 13 of the throttle levels the spacecraft will use at Vesta while measuring the Doppler shift of the spacecraft's radio signal. These measurements show the change in the radio frequency caused by the change in the spacecraft's velocity, thus revealing the thrust. This procedure was performed with two of the thrusters to allow navigators to develop accurate flight profiles for maneuvering from one science orbit at Vesta to another.\n\nMission controllers radioed new parameters to the spacecraft to allow it to use less of its hydrazine propellant. Hydrazine is fired through the small reaction control jets to help the spacecraft hold stable or rotate in the zero-gravity of spaceflight. Even before powering off the reaction wheels in August, at which point the reaction control system took over, engineers began working on methods to use the hydrazine more efficiently. The successful operation with the new parameters this month was the culmination of that work.\n\nThis month, Dawn controllers began formulating the specific instructions the spacecraft will use for operating at Vesta. They are beginning with the \"approach phase,\" which commences in May 2011 and concludes in August 2011, when Dawn has thrust to the first science orbit from which it will conduct intensive science observations. By the time Dawn actually begins the approach phase, most of the instructions for its year at Vesta will have been prepared.\n\nDawn thrust with its ion propulsion system for most of December and remains On course for Vesta. the spacecraft conducted a set of special activities during the week of November 30. The gamma-ray and neutron detector (GRaND), visible and infrared mapping spectrometer (VIR), and science camera all were operated and verified to be healthy. “A measurement of the relative alignment of VIR and the science camera did not yield the desired data because of a conflict between commands within VIR, but the instrument remained healthy. The VIR commands are easily corrected, and the calibration will be executed early in 2010. Upgraded software was installed in the primary and backup cameras. Other spacecraft engineering activities were completed successfully as well.\n\nDawn passed its second anniversary of being in space on September 27. It spent most of the month continuing to thrust with its ion propulsion system. It has expended about 104 kilograms (230 pounds) of xenon in its 392 days of thrusting since launch. The effective change in speed so far is more than 2.6 kilometers per second (5800 miles per hour), far more than most spacecraft ever achieve with their propulsion systems.\n\nDawn resumed its routine of long-duration thrusting with its ion propulsion system on June 8. The spacecraft is now following the same pattern it used for most of 2008, with only a single weekly interruption in thrusting to point the main antenna to Earth. Dawn had spent most of the time since October 31, 2008 coasting. In contrast, most of the time from now until arrival at Vesta will be devoted to thrusting.\n\nDawn was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth this month in an arrangement known as solar conjunction. The smallest separation between the Sun and the spacecraft was on December 12, when they were only about 1/3 degree apart as viewed from Earth. (To put this in perspective, the Sun itself appears to be 1/2 degree in diameter.) Communications were limited from December 5 to December 18, as the radio waves passing near the Sun experienced interference.\n\nOn November 4, the spacecraft successfully executed a procedure to calibrate the power of the solar arrays. The method was identical to that used in a test in September, but this time the arrays were rotated to point 60 degrees away from the Sun instead of 45 degrees. With the arrays not pointed directly at the Sun, their power output was reduced to a level the spacecraft could measure.\n\nDawn spent most of August continuing to thrust with its ion propulsion system. On August 8, it reached its greatest distance from the Sun this year of 1.68 times Earth's average distance from the Sun. For the rest of 2008, it will gradually travel closer to the Sun. The spacecraft's elliptical orbit will never bring it as close to the Sun as Earth's orbit. In 2009, it will resume moving away from the Sun.\n\nDawn spent most of January continuing with ion propulsion thrusting. A cosmic ray that hit an electronic component on January 15 caused an interruption in thrusting for a few days. Thrusting halted on schedule on January 22 so the operations team could update the software in the main computer. The changes account for the increasing distance from Earth by lowering the speed of communications with Earth when the spacecraft enters \"safe mode,\" the configuration called by software to resolve certain errors. Following the software changes, thrusting resumed on January 25.\n\nThis week was devoted to updating the software on the main spacecraft computer. This was planned before launch. Files were transmitted to the spacecraft, computer memory was checked, and other activities were conducted on Monday and Tuesday in preparation for rebooting the computer on Wednesday to start using the new software. On Tuesday night, the computer rebooted on its own. All diagnostic information has been returned from the spacecraft and the event is being investigated. With the new software operating as expected, controllers have verified that the spacecraft is healthy and activities are proceeding as scheduled.\n\nThe operations team conducted tests of special modes of the attitude control system while the ion propulsion system is thrusting. All tests showed excellent performance. Two of the three ion thrusters have been fully checked out. Tests began with the third thruster this week, and all were completed successfully. The device that emits electrons to ionize xenon was heated to drive off contaminants, and then the thruster ionized xenon (but was not commanded to accelerate it). In addition, the gimbal system that points the thruster in the required direction was operated for the first time in flight. The first test of thrusting with this thruster is not scheduled to occur until after other spacecraft tests are completed.\n\nOn September 11, Dawn and the mated third stage were moved from Astrotech to Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 17B where they were hoisted into place atop the second stage of the Delta launch vehicle. Brief tests of the spacecraft subsystems showed Dawn to be in good health. As part of the planned preparations for launch on September 26, the Kevlar cords that have held the solar arrays in their stowed position since prior to the planned June/July launch were replaced with fresh ones, and the new cords were adjusted to the correct tension for launch.\n\nEngineers completed calculations of the coordinates needed for the rocket to deliver Dawn to space for a launch on any day from September 7 through October 15. (The dates for Dawn's launch period will be established soon.) These data will be used to program the rocket and to compute the open and close times of the daily launch windows. Now, with the details of the new trajectory early in the mission, the operations team is refining commands it will use during the first few weeks of Dawn's flight.\n\nThe alignment of spacecraft components was verified and finalized this week, ensuring that antennas, ion thrusters, scientific instruments, and other devices are properly oriented. With mission control at JPL connected to the spacecraft at Astrotech in Florida, mission controllers conducted another successful simulation of the final 4 hours of countdown, launch, and the first 4 hours of spacecraft operations once Dawn is in space. (This was a test of the procedures used to control the spacecraft and assess its condition; the launch vehicle was not involved.)\n\nMission controllers completed a four-day simulation of the procedures to be used to command and monitor the spacecraft for the first firing of the ion propulsion system after launch. This activity, known as an operational readiness test, used a simulator of the spacecraft to provide realistic responses to commands as well as signals for engineers in mission control to interpret. This simulation included the steps that would be followed to check the validity of the commands if the launch were delayed by a day, which would cause the alignment of the ion thruster relative to Earth to change. (A launch delay can occur as a result of bad weather or problems during the final countdown that cannot be resolved during the daily launch window.) Meanwhile, the final comprehensive performance tests are being conducted on the spacecraft in Florida to verify that each subsystem is still working correctly."
