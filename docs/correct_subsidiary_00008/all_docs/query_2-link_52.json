        "meta_description": "Abstract. The convective lifecycle, from initiation to maturity and dissipation, is driven by a combination of kinematic, thermodynamic, microphysical, and radiative processes that are strongly coupled and variable in time and space. Weather radars have been traditionally used to provide various convective-cloud characteristics. Here, we analyzed climatological convective-cell radar characteristics to obtain and assess the diurnal cycles of three convective-cell types â shallow, modest deep, and vigorous deep convective cells â that formed in the greater Houston area, using the National Weather Service radar from Houston, Texas, and a multi-cell identification and tracking algorithm. The examined dataset spans 4Â years (2018â2021) and covers the warm-season months (June to September) in those years. The analysis showed clear diurnal cycles in cell initiation (CI) consistent with the sea breeze circulation and showed diurnal and normalized lifetime relationships in cell evolution parameters (e.g., maximum reflectivity, echo-top height, Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) channelÂ 13 brightness temperature, and the height of maximum reflectivity). The cell evolution is well represented by relationships between (1)Â the height and value of the maximum radar reflectivity, (2)Â the minimum GOES-16 channelÂ 13 brightness temperature and the maximum vertically integrated liquid, (3)Â the maximum reflectivity and columnar-average reflectivity, and (4)Â the echo-top ascent rate and cell lifetime. The relationships presented herein help to identify the cell lifecycle stages such as early shallow convection, vigorous vertical development, anvil development, and convective core dissipation. GOES-16 Aerosol Optical Depth values are also used as a proxy for cell initiation aerosol concentrations to investigate any potential relationships between initiation location and aerosol concentration. Overall, no significant relationships between initiation location and aerosol concentration were found for the three cell types investigated, but there are some minor differences in the pre-CI aerosol optical depth for vigorous deep convective cells.",

        "text": "2.1âDomain and data\n\nOur study domain was centered on the KHGX WSR-88D near Houston, Texas, and extended Â±â125âkm to the north, east, south, and west, creating a 250âkm by 250âkm domain. This region was selected because the coastline with the Gulf of Mexico generates regular landâsea breeze circulations which provide a forcing mechanism for CI. This domain also provides regions with relatively âpristineâ and âpollutedâ aerosol regimes. For example, the area to the northeast of Houston is generally downstream of pollution sources, such as the Houston metropolitan area itself and oil refineries near Houston, allowing for the advection of this polluted air over this sub-region. The area to the southwest of Houston is generally upstream and made up of mostly rural land even further upstream, allowing the air there to be far less polluted. However, the general flow pattern described previously does not hold true for all cases and is not accounted for in these analyses (i.e., events where there is easterly flow at the surface). As such, flow patterns that deviate substantially from the general flow will introduce considerable error into any aerosol concentration relationships presented herein.\n\nData from KHGX and GOES-16 were collected for the period of June through September for the years 2018â2021, when convective initiation occurred during local daytime (09:00â21:00âCDT (central daylight time)). Initiation during local daytime was chosen to increase the likelihood that sea breeze propagation was a primary forcing mechanism for CI and to enable the analysis of GOES aerosol optical depth (AOD) data.\n\nDuring the study period, the volume coverage patterns (VCPs) available to KHGX changed with the implementation of VCPs 215 (15 elevation angles from 0.5 and 19.5Â°) and 112 (14 elevation angles from 0.5 and 19.5Â°) and the removal of VCPs 11, 211, 21, and 221 (Radar Operations Center 2015; Zittel, 2019). Aside from these differing VCPs, different dynamic scanning techniques can adjust how the radar scans without changing the VCP (Chrisman, 2009, 2013, 2014, 2016). These differing VCPs and dynamic scanning techniques have an effect on the time required to complete a single VCP. Despite these variations in rescan time, the time required to complete any of these VCPs is on the order of approximately 5âmin. These different VCPs also collect slightly different sets of elevation data, which can substantially affect the uncertainty in any analysis of height or vertically integrated liquid (VIL; Greene and Clark, 1972; Amburn and Wolf, 1997) presented herein.\n\nThe horizontal radar reflectivity factor (ZH) from KHGX was collected during normal weather surveillance operations and regridded to a 250âkm by 250âkm domain with 500âm by 500âm horizontal spacing for each case day considered, which was then used to estimate the VIL, radar-derived echo-top height (ETH), and radar-derived profile depth (Hcell). GOES-16 channelÂ 13 cloud-top brightness temperature data (GOESBT) were regridded to the same grid as before and analyzed such that each 5âmin image was linked to the KHGX scan time nearest to each GOESBT product time. Since KHGX and GOES-16 do not scan at the exact same time, some error may be introduced by the difference between product times. However, since both KHGX and GOES-16 scan at approximately 5âmin intervals, the maximum difference between product times is approximately 2.5âmin. The calculation of GOES-16 AOD data requires cloud-free pixels. In many cases, the location of cell initiation already contains some form of cloud cover (be it low-, middle-, or upper-level clouds) at the time of initiation, which inhibits AOD generation. When AOD values are generated, they are classified as low-, medium-, or high-quality returns. To ensure a large enough sample size, AOD data denoted as medium or high quality were temporally averaged for the 30âmin preceding cell initiation at the location of cell initiation. We calculated VIL from the gridded ZH (with ZH capped at 56âdBZ, as done in Greene and Clark, 1972) data from KHGX using Eq.Â (1):\n\n(1) VIL ( dB ) = 10 â log 10 Ã â i = 0 i = ( i max - 1 ) 3.44 â 10 - 6 [ ( Z i + Z i + 1 ) / 2 ] 4 / 7 dh 1 kg m - 2 ,\n\nwhere imaxÂ is the total number of sweeps for a given VCP, ZÂ is the radar reflectivity of a given sweepÂ (i) in units ofÂ mm6âmâ3, and dhÂ is the vertical spacing between sweeps. VIL assumes a MarshallâPalmer drop-size distribution, which introduces uncertainty, since this relationship may not be completely valid for convective events in coastal regions. Other sources of uncertainty in VIL include beam spreading with increasing distance from the radar and data sparsity at high elevations within 30âkm of KHGX. The uncertainty because of beam spreading with distance has been shown to be relatively small, but VIL within 30âkm of the radar tends to be underestimated for 5âmin WSR-88D VCPs (Oue etÂ al., 2022).\n\n3.4âAnalysis of bulk cell type and normalized cell lifetime characteristics\n\nEven though the peak in CI has been shown to occur in the late morning or early afternoon, and the peak in intensity occurs in the early to mid-afternoon, there may be diurnal variability and differences in cell lifetime duration that are unaccounted for. To observe how these cells behave over the courses of their respective lifetimes rather than the course of a given day, we analyzed these cells by aggregating scans during specific periods of their lifetimes, aggregating all scans of all cells of each type, and normalizing each by its respective lifetime. These analyses allow for direct comparisons of case types, regardless of what times the cells initiated or how long they lasted.\n\nDownload\n\nDownload\n\nThe growth and decay of these cells can be seen by analyzing the changes in the distributions of dBZmax, HdBZmax, maximum VIL, GOESBT, and the average of the maximum radar reflectivity for all columns within a given cell (dBZavg). Shallow convective cells show low dBZmax overall at low HdBZmax over the course of the entire cell lifetime (Fig.Â 7). Cell growth and decay is apparent, as HdBZmax and dBZmax shift to higher values overall during the first half of the cell lifetime and then decrease back to a distribution that looks most similar to cell initiation at the end of the cell lifetime. Modest and vigorous deep convection show clear signals of the birth (Fig.Â 7b andÂ c), mature (Fig.Â 7e, f, h, andÂ i), and dissipation (Fig.Â 7k andÂ l) phases. Early in their lifetimes, these cell types are dominated by low dBZmax values at low HdBZmax, both of which increase considerably as the cells move into their mature phases. This trend is especially apparent in vigorous deep convection, where, early in the cell lifetime, there is a clear signal from initiation and some cells that have begun to grow (based on the secondary maximum at high dBZmax at high HdBZmax values). As these cells continue to mature, we see that HdBZmax remains high but that dBZmax begins to decrease. This is indicative of cells where the convective core has dissipated, leaving âorphan anvilsâ (Hitschfeld, 1960). However, HdBZmax appears to be slightly skewed by bright banding, as both modest and vigorous deep convection show rather unnatural-looking discontinuities in their distributions around 6âkm above radar level. These discontinuity features are especially apparent in Fig.Â 8b andÂ e.\n\nDownload\n\nFigureÂ 8 supports the idea that the feature seen in Fig.Â 7 around 6âkm above radar level is caused by the bright band, since there are no similar discontinuities in these distributions where GOESBT is warmer. However, this is one interpretation, and the discontinuities shown in Fig.Â 7 may instead be indicative of some ongoing storm physics. As with Fig.Â 7, Fig.Â 8 clearly shows the initiation, growth, and decay of these cell types. Shallow convective cells remain at a relatively warm GOESBT and a low maximum VIL throughout their lives, whereas modest and vigorous deep convection show clear growth from warm-GOESBT, low-maximum-VIL cells to cold-GOESBT, high-maximum-VIL cells. The rapid changes shown in Figs.Â 7 andÂ 8 during the early stages of vigorous deep convection show the quick vertical evolution of these cells. Also shown (as in Fig.Â 7) is the dissipation phase, where GOESBT remains cold but VIL drops off considerably. This further supports the idea that this is the period when the convective cores have dissipated, leaving orphan anvils behind.\n\nAs stated previously, dBZavg is the average of the column ZH maxima within a given cell, and dBZmax is the cell maximum ZH for a given time. To investigate potential anvil generation, the distributions of dBZavg versus dBZmax are analyzed (Fig.Â 9). During the anvil generation phase, we would expect cells to be at their most intense states, meaning they would have a high value of dBZmax. We would also expect an increasingly large region of low ZH to form high aloft in the storm. This region of low ZH will skew dBZavg lower, while dBZmax will remain unaffected until the storm begins to dissipate. When comparing shallow and deep convection with this information in mind, the presence â apparent in deep convection â of low dBZavg and high dBZmax could be interpreted as anvil generation. As with previous figures in this section, these anvil signatures are especially apparent in vigorous deep convective cells. Early in their lifetimes, deep convective cells have not had enough time to grow to a state where anvil generation is possible (with the exception of the most intense cells). The vast majority of cells exist very near the one-to-one line of dBZavg versus dBZmax, with only a small subset of cells showing the high dBZmax and lower dBZavg values indicative of cells that are growing and beginning to produce anvils (Fig.Â 9c). As cells move into the mature life stage, the low-dBZavg, high-dBZmax region, where strong-anvil-generating cells are present, becomes the dominant regime for these cells (Fig.Â 9f andÂ i). As cells decay, the distribution maximum shifts back down to near the one-to-one line (Fig.Â 9l), which would be suggestive of orphan anvils, given the analyses provided in the previous paragraphs. One feature of note in the vigorous deep convective cells during the dissipation phase is the secondary maximum at high dBZavg and high dBZmax. This feature represents the transition from the mature stage with a large dBZmax at a deeper depth within the clouds to the later stage (normalized lifetime: 0.75â1.0) with a lower dBZmax.\n\nDownload\n\nShallow convective cells reach their maximum ETH during approximately the first 10â% of their lives and appear to maintain this height until around 75â%, and then they gradually decrease in height until dissipation (Fig.Â 10a). Modest convective cells take substantially longer (â¼â35â%â55â% of the way through their lives) to reach their maximum ETH and then sharply decrease in height during the last 15â% (Fig.Â 10b). Vigorous convective cells, on the contrary, reach their maximum ETH quite quickly (within the first 15â% to 35â% of their lives), maintain a tall echo top, and finally gradually decrease in height to dissipation (Fig.Â 10c). The gradual decrease in ETH leading to dissipation is further indicative of convective anvils. In this case, we believe that this signal further supports the notion that we are observing convective-core dissipation, with orphan anvils left behind. Both HdBZmax and dBZmax show similar trends to ETH for all case types. Shallow convective cells reach their dBZmax and HdBZmax early in their normalized lifetimes (within the first 20â%â30â%), maintain those values, and then gradually decay to dissipation (Fig.Â 10d andÂ g). Modest convection shows a gradual increase in HdBZmax that looks nearly identical to its maximum ETH. It appears that these cells reach their HdBZmax anywhere from 35â% to 65â% of the way through their lifetimes. However, dBZmax is reached much earlier (within the first 20â% of their lifetimes) than HdBZmax is (Fig.Â 10e andÂ h). Vigorous deep convection reaches its HdBZmax much sooner in its normalized lifetime (between 10â% and 25â% of the normalized life), like ETH (Fig.Â 10f). As with modest deep convection, vigorous deep convection also reaches its dBZmax early in its life (within the first 20â% of its normalized life) and maintains this value until about halfway through its life, when dissipation begins (Fig.Â 10i). One feature that is seen in dBZmax and HdBZmax for both modest and vigorous deep convection is an apparent bimodality later in the cell lifetime (â³â0.4), as it appears that some cells maintain high values of dBZmax and VIL (not shown) at higher altitudes (â¼â9âkm) all the way up to dissipation (Fig.Â 10f andÂ i). This is particularly apparent in the modest deep cells. This bimodality suggests that some of the modest deep cells with lower ETHs were dominated by warm-phase precipitation processes (similar to the shallow cells), as HdBZmax was found to be below 6âkm throughout their lifetimes. This reasoning would explain why dBZmax and VIL remain so high all the way up to the end of the cell life, as these cells are deemed to have âdissipatedâ when they leave the domain, even though they may still persist for some time.\n\nCell echo base height (HEBase) was determined as the maximum ETH minus the radar-derived echo profile depth to estimate the precipitation bases of these cells. For shallow convection, HEBase remains relatively flat for the duration of the cell, whereas it shows an increase in height during dissipation for modest and vigorous deep convective cells (Fig.Â 10j, k, andÂ l). This signature is especially apparent in the vigorous deep convective cells. This increase in HEBase, in tandem with the minimal decrease in maximum ETH during the dissipation of both types of deep convection (especially vigorous deep convection), reinforces the idea that we are observing the generation of orphan anvils. The bimodality observed here may also partially be caused by some cells leaving the domain during their mature phases (prior to dissipation), despite the mitigation techniques we applied, but this is less certain than the reasoning given for dBZmax.\n\nDownload\n\nIn an attempt to quantify the vertical motion within vigorous deep convective cells, we approximated this quantity in three different ways. We used the maximum ETH, the HdBZmax during each scan, and the GOESBT at the time closest to the radar scan time along with the time between samples to calculate maximum ETH and HdBZmax âascent ratesâ as well as GOESBT âcloud-top lapse rates.â As shown in Fig.Â 11, there are maximum ETH and HdBZmax ascent signatures early and descent signatures late in the lives of these cells for all case types. GOESBT shows cooling during the same period when maximum ETH and HdBZmax ascend and warming during the same period when they descend. The near-identical timings and structures of these derived ascent rates suggest that these values may be good proxies for updraft intensity during the early parts of these cells' lives. However, the later portions of these cells' lives are dominated by the tops or high upper portions of these features (as shown in Fig.Â 11) and most likely do not represent downdraft intensity during dissipation. We suspect that, in vigorous deep convective cases, we may be seeing orphan anvils falling out as virga since the descent signature occurs quite late in these cells' normalized lifetimes, after their HEBase increases considerably. The maximum ETH and HdBZmax descent rates and the GOESBT warming rates match well late in these cells' lives, which further supports the idea that we may be observing anvil fall-out. Further analysis is necessary to validate these results. There is a hint of this signature as well for modest deep convective cells, but it is not as obvious. To further assess the quality of these approximations, analyses outside the scope of this study will be needed. One caveat to consider with these ascent rate results is the increasing uncertainty in ETH and HdBZmax with increasing range from KHGX. Since we have large sample sizes for all case types, this uncertainty may account for the large spread that is always seen. The large uncertainty for cells in the farthest portions of our domain muddle these results considerably. However, since the same signal is seen when looking at the GOESBT cloud-top lapse rates, the above analyses have more credence."
