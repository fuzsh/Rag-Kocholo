When you get to apply that, and millions of people benefit from what you build, it pushes you to stay out front and continue to build products people love.\" Having worked with Aaron LaBerge for many years, that curiosity -- along with deep technical knowledge -- are hallmarks of he and the super-talented teams he leads. Nice spotlight from his alma mater, just as the Gamecocks look to a Women's Basketball Sweet 16 -- and a potential perfect season. https://lnkd.in/gkv-tZ9J"
