        "text": "Vanilla Beane\n\nOwner and Operator of Bené Millinery & Bridal Supply\n\nVanilla Powell Beane is the owner of Bené Millinery & Bridal Supply in Washington, D.C. Her hats have adorned the heads of such luminaries as the late Dorothy Height, former president of the National Council for Negro Women, and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser. Though Bené Millinery sells hats made by other designers, each custom-made hat is designed by Beane herself. No two are exactly the same.\n\nAt 101, Beane still owns and operates Bene Millinery & Bridal Supply, which she opened in 1979. Customers range from church-goers, to derby-goers, to Washington’s well-heeled. She has created hats for movies, charity events, and even for a guest attending the Royal Ascot horse race in England. In 2018, a green turban, Beane’s personal favorite style of hat, was selected as part of Google’s 3D interactive exhibit curated at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. She was honored to see her hats displayed for the museum’s opening in 2016. Others have been on display at the National Museum of American History and the former Black Fashion Museum in Harlem.\n\nBeane’s most notable client was the late civil rights activist, and President Emeritus of the NAACP, Dorothy Height. At Height’s funeral in 2010, the iconic headpieces were mentioned by President Barack Obama: “We loved those hats that she wore like a crown.” One of these crowns is immortalized on top of a call box in front of Height’s southwest D.C. home. Another is depicted on a U.S. Postal Service stamp.\n\nBeane did more than dream of making hats—she manifested her dream into reality. In 1955, she took a job at the Washington Millinery Supply Company, a shop she frequented while working as an elevator operator in the same building. When preparation met opportunity, Beane was able to purchase the stock of millinery supplies from the shop owner when he retired. She then was able to build her own millinery business. Twenty years after she got her start, the award-winning “hat lady” who turned a hobby into a career, was inducted into the National Association of Fashion and Accessory Designers Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 2019, on her 100th birthday, Bowser declared September 13 “Vanilla Beane Day” in the District of Columbia.\n\nLeonard Green\n\nEntrepreneurship Division Adjunct Lecturer, and Chairman and Founder of The Green Group\n\nLeonard Green is a CPA, MBA, and entrepreneur-chairman and founder of The Green Group, a tax and financial services consulting firm.\n\nGreen has been an owner, advisor, and investor in more than a dozen businesses, including The Green Group, a commercial real estate firm, a thoroughbred racing stable, a publicly traded pet food brand, and a beverage company.\n\nHis business accomplishments have “led to my most meaningful position, as a Babson College professor, where I was able to teach over 1,500 students, acquainting them with over 75 entrepreneurs,” Green said. “Over the years, I have been amazed by the students’ intellect, creativity, and drive—they have taught me numerous life lessons.\n\nHe also feels strongly that “now is the time to reciprocate by financially supporting scholarships, internships, athletes, challenges, eTower” and numerous other extra-curricular activities meant to encourage and reward Babson College students.\n\nMore than anything, Green expresses enormous gratitude to those around him for his successes, including being honored by the ADE.\n\n“I want to thank Babson presidents Steve Spinelli, Len Schlesinger, and Brian Barefoot, and professors John Altman, Les Charm, Mark Rice, and Jeff Timmons for all they did in assisting me along the way. And, a special thanks to the members of The Green Group, especially Managing Partner Karlene Bauer and the many loyal professionals who worked with me for over 25 years. You are the best at what you do, and you have always gone the extra mile for me.”\n\nGreen also expressed his heartfelt gratitude for his children, Beth, Debbie, Jonathan, Marty, and Michelle, “for understanding that entrepreneurs do not adhere to standard business hours.”\n\n“Finally, I have been fortunate to participate in many successful business collaborations, but the most important partnership I have ever had, is being married to the love of my life, Lois Green.\n\n“I am humbled and privileged to be selected as a member of the Babson Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs. I consider it one of the greatest honors of my professional career. Hopefully, my story will inspire others to strive for greatness, just as the previous honorees have inspired me.”\n\nSara Blakely\n\nFounder and CEO of SPANX Inc.\n\nSara Blakely is the founder and CEO of SPANX Inc. The dynamic women’s brand has revolutionized an industry and changed the way women around the world get dressed.\n\nSpanx is known for inventing smarter, more comfortable, must-haves for women including bras, leggings, activewear, undies, Arm Tights™, and, of course, their famous shapewear which creates the perfect, smooth canvas under clothes!

He had the ability to instantly get to the heart of the matter and communicate in a way that was understandable and memorable.\n\nOriginally from Minnesota, Roger attended Babson College on a scholarship, and became the first in his family to graduate from college. After graduation he joined General Mills for a year before joining the Navy ROTC program and was then deployed to Vietnam as a supply officer. Following his service, he returned to General Mills. His success quickly attracted the attention of Frito-Lay and he was appointed brand manager for Funyuns. He went on to lead PepsiCo’s regional operations in Japan and Brazil and became chief executive of Pepsi-Cola USA at the unprecedented age of 38.\n\nRoger immediately launched the “Cola Wars” by signing a multimillion-dollar sponsorship deal with Michael Jackson. The campaign included Lionel Ritchie, Madonna, and Michael J. Fox and successfully grew Pepsi’s market share. This success led Coca-Cola to change its formula. Roger famously said on the day that Coca-Cola announced the change: “After 87 years of going at it eyeball to eyeball, the other guy just blinked.” Seventy-nine days later, Coca-Cola revived its old formula in response to customer outcry.\n\nAfter being named Chief Executive and Chairman of PepsiCo in 1996, Roger spun off the restaurant division, composed of Taco Bell, KFC, and Pizza Hut chains, as an independent public company. He oversaw PepsiCo’s acquisition of Tropicana, Quaker Oats, and Gatorade.\n\nAt PepsiCo, Roger devoted considerable time to mentoring talent by creating a Leadership Development program and the first frontline recognition program which celebrates hundreds of plant workers and route drivers from around the world. He gave generously to employees and their children through scholarships and other opportunities.\n\nFollowing his PepsiCo retirement in 2003, Roger was named Chairman for DreamWorks Animation. Roger also served as a board member of the National Geographic Society, the Environmental Defense Fund, and the American Film Institute.\n\nFor more than three decades, the generous philanthropy of Roger Enrico inspired the Babson Community. To date, Roger and Rosemary have supported 35 students through the Roger and Rosemary Enrico Scholarship, which was established to provide full-tuition, need-based scholarships for economically disadvantaged students from Dallas Public Schools. The scholarship is life-changing for the recipients.\n\nIn 2015, Roger was awarded The Babson Medal—the highest honor Babson bestows on an individual for outstanding achievement and commitment to the College. It is presented to a dedicated graduate or friend for distinguished service to the community and College.\n\nRoger also supported Babson Athletics through The PepsiCo Pavilion. The Pavilion serves as an indoor practice facility for Babson's varsity teams, as well as numerous intramural and recreational activities. It will be rededicated “The PepsiCo Enrico Pavilion” on November 15, 2018.\n\nRoger is survived by his wife, Rosemary, his son and daughter-in-law, Aaron and Catie, and three grandchildren, Daniel, Gisele, and Joseph.\n\nJesse Itzler\n\nCo-founder of Marquis Jet\n\nJesse Itzler only eats fruit until noon, loves Run-D.M.C., and enjoys living life “out of the box,\" actually, he doesn’t even have a box. He co-founded Marquis Jet, the world’s largest prepaid private jet card company in 2001, which he and his partner sold to Berkshire Hathaway/NetJets. He then partnered with Zico coconut water, which they sold to The Coca-Cola Company in 2013.

In addition to being nominated to serve on many distinguished boards, committees, councils, and juries, Mittal was named CEO of the Year in 2007 by Business Standard, and the Asia Businessman of the Year in 2006 by Fortune.\n\nHe earned a Doctor of Science degree (Honoris Causa) from the G.B. Pant University of Agriculture and Technology and is an alumnus of Harvard Business School.\n\nLee Man Tat\n\nChairman of Lee Kum Kee\n\nIn 1954, Lee joined Lee Kum Kee to assist his father, Lee Shiu Nan, in managing the business. Taking over the role as chairman in 1972, he built a renowned brand of Ethnic Chinese Enterprise through his determination and marked a new chapter of this reputable enterprise.\n\nWith endurance and innovative spirit, Lee is a business leader of foresight. His great aspiration and intelligence, coupled with constant entrepreneurship, have successfully led the company to grow and become a household name across the world. Today, Lee Kum Kee’s wide range of products is marketed to more than 100 countries and regions. Even though he ended his formal education at an early age, Lee has never given up his quest for learning and knowledge. He holds a strong belief in sharing the fruits of success and contributing to the community, including donations to educational and medical services. He is particularly supportive of educational causes in the People’s Republic of China.\n\nThroughout the years, Lee has received a number of significant international awards and recognition, including Strategic Development Advisor by Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2007; Senior Economic Advisor by Hong An Municipal Government, Hubei Province, in 2006; China Top Ten Men Award by the China Condiment Industrial Association in 2005; and the Hong Kong Business Mastermind Award by the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce in 2004.\n\nCurrently, Lee also serves as honorary chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Committee of Xinhui, adviser of the Overseas Chinese Committee of Hong Kong-Macau-Taiwan, Chinese People’s Political Consultative Committee of Zhuhai City, and president of the Federation of Hong Kong Guangdong Community Organizations.\n\nBorn in Macau in 1930, Lee’s hometown is in Xinhui of Jiangmen City in the Guangdong Province of the People’s Republic of China. Married to Ms. Choi May Ling in 1954, Lee has four sons and one daughter who work in the Lee Kum Kee Group.\n\nEllen Gordon\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer of Tootsie Roll Industries Inc.\n\nGordon's dedication and entrepreneurial spirit has perpetuated the success of a unique candy that was created more than 100 years ago into Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc., one of the top companies in the candy industry. She is president and chief operating officer.\n\nGordon is credited as being the second woman to ever rise to the presidency of an exchange-listed company, and her entrepreneurial management style has been the key to Tootsie Roll Industries’ success. Gordon encourages a family atmosphere at the company and believes in participatory management rather than directing from above. She promotes the cross-training of workers, saying that “cross-training not only makes them perform their job better, but also gives them a company-wide view.” Cost control is also an important aspect of Gordon’s management style along with long-term growth of the company. She has kept the company abreast of technological advances by focusing on automation, and strives to continuously improve production and minimize costs.\n\nHer ambition and achievements have stretched far beyond her company. She has served as a role model for many by finding equal success both personally and professionally. She began her undergraduate studies at Vassar College, married at the age of 18, and then continued her education at Wellesley College. She left college and raised four daughters while also leading Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. to new heights. Seventeen years later, she completed her degree work at Brandeis University.\n\nMarie Gray\n\nCo-founder of St. John Knits Inc.\n\nSt. John Knits, Inc. began in 1962 when Marie hand made a dress to impress Robert Gray, her fiancée at the time. He was so impressed with her that he brought the dress to several department store buyers and returned home with orders for 84 dresses. Currently, Marie is vice chairman and chief designer, and Robert is chairman of the board and chief executive officer. Their daughter, Kelly Gray, has been president since 1996.\n\nQuality and classic styling have always been the foundation of St. John Knits, Inc., and it is this focus that has brought the company the success it has enjoyed for many years. Over the past ten years, sales have grown from $37 million to $242 million, with 1998 third-quarter sales increasing by 24 percent over last year’s third-quarter sales. Third-quarter sales for company-operated retail boutiques also increased by 22 percent. Company lines include St. John Knits, St. John Sport, St. John Coat Collection, Griffith & Gray, accessories, and fragrance. Eyewear and watch lines have recently been added.\n\nAnother key to St. John’s success has been customer focus on businesswomen as a target market. This market has been the key to the company’s top quality reputation and steady growth. The company also has a unique approach to manufacturing. It owns and operates every design and manufacturing phase for its core product lines.\n\nRobert Gray\n\nCo-founder of St. John Knits Inc.\n\nSt. John Knits, Inc. began in 1962 when Marie hand made a dress to impress Robert Gray, her fiancée at the time.

The corporation has also grown to become a leading producer of technology-related trade shows and expositions.\n\nThe innovative flare that is characteristic of Son is the basis of Softbank’s success. His strategy of diversification has given Softbank a strong position in several key areas. The corporation’s mission is to be a premier infrastructure provider to the computer industry, creating the means by which the leading software developers, hardware manufacturers, and service providers can display, explain, and distribute their products.\n\nSoftbank is continually expanding into new areas. In 1988, it began multinational activities by establishing Softbank America, which coordinates Softbank’s business in North America. Over the past several years, Softbank has expanded to international markets through a series of joint ventures, partnerships, and acquisitions. For example, in 1990, a joint venture called Novell Japan was created with Novell, Inc. and involved companies such as Canon, Fujitsu, NEC, Sony, and Toshiba. Son has currently begun investing in various Internet companies and already holds a 31 percent stake in Yahoo! Inc.\n\nIn addition to the multifaceted role Son has at Softbank, he also serves on the board of directors of Cisco Systems, Inc., the leading global supplier of enterprise networks. Forbes Magazine has called him “Japan’s hottest entrepreneur,” and for the past two years has listed Son among the top ten of the “global power elite.” U.S. News & World Report has also named him “Japan’s most renowned digital-age entrepreneur.”\n\nRichard J. Egan P’89\n\nCo-founder of EMC Corporation\n\nRichard Egan founded the EMC Corporation in Hopkinton, Massachusetts in 1979. He identified a niche in the computer industry for computers with more memory at a better price than was currently the case, while working for Intel. According to the company profile, it is the only company worldwide to “focus entirely on rapidly delivering intelligent enterprise storage and retrieval solutions that enable companies and organizations to leverage their growing volumes of information into profitability, growth and competitive advantage.”\n\nEMC is the worldwide leader in designing, manufacturing, marketing and supporting high performance storage products. In 1996 EMC’s annual revenue surpassed $2.27 billion and the company currently employs 4,800 people in over 80 offices throughout the world. EMC’s largest breakthrough came in 1990, when it was the first company to introduce intelligent storage systems which bundle arrays of disks to handle the massive storage and rapid retrieval demands of IBM mainframe users. It has kept this advantage by developing a standard design called MOSAIC: 2000, which allows new technologies to be incorporated more rapidly and enhances portability to non-IBM environments.\n\nFrom 1979, Richard Egan held the position of president and chief executive officer, until 1992 when he became the chairman of the board and Michael Ruettgers was appointed president and chief executive officer. Mr. Egan has been active in the technology industry, specifically storage systems, since graduating from Northeastern University in 1961. He began his career in the Data Processing Division of Honeywell and moved on to The Draper Laboratory at MIT in 1963, where he aided in the development of the Apollo Guidance Computer. His first entrepreneurial adventure began when he co-founded Cambridge Memories, Inc. He brought this company to a profitable level before leaving to join Intel as the general manager of the Commercial Systems Division. He continues to hold the position of chairman of the board of the EMC Corporation and is very active in the educational and high-tech community of Boston.\n\nAbraham D. Gosman P’88\n\nFounder of The Meditrust Companies\n\nAbraham Gosman’s career has been that of a true entrepreneur. Even before he graduated from the University of New Hampshire, he began his first venture by developing an inexpensive way to attach alligator and lizard skin to shoes, thus, earning him the title of “the largest reptile laminator in the US.” He moved on to the heath care real estate industry in the 1960’s by purchasing large, rundown mansions and restoring them into nursing homes. By the 1980’s Mr. Gosman took his company, Mediplex, public and in 1985 established a spin-off company, Meditrust, of which he assumed the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. In 1986 he sold Mediplex to Avon Products for $220 million, while Meditrust continued to grow under his direction. Mediplex struggled under the Avon’s management and in 1990 Mr. Gosman repurchased the company for a mere $42 million. Once again, he turned Mediplex into a profitable company and in 1994 sold Mediplex again to Sun Healthcare for $320 million.\n\nMeditrust is the largest health care real estate investment trust in the nation, investing in health care related facilities, with a diversified investment portfolio made up of 65% nursing homes, 14% retirement and assisted living facilities, 12% rehabilitation facilities, 4% medical office buildings, 3% acute care hospitals, and 2% psychiatric, alcohol and substance abuse facilities. The company purchases these facilities then leases the facilities back to the original management, thus achieving Meditrust’s main goal of producing and distributing its’ income to shareholders. Meditrust is exempt from corporate income tax since it distributes at least 95% of its taxable income to shareholders.\n\nMr. Gosman has always achieved ideal industry positioning, and has led his company to total assets of approximately $2.3 billion and built a personal fortune estimated between $300 and $400 million. He established Meditrust with the intention to buy or develop high quality facilities and lease them back to the operator. These investments have proven to be well timed due to the growth of HMOs and the decline in in-patient hospital care, combined with the aging baby-boomer population and an increased concern in keeping health care costs down.\n\nAs in his business ventures, Mr. Gosman has become an enthusiastic philanthropist. He is a Fellow of Brandeis University; a Trustee of the Wang Center for the Performing Arts; a Board Member of the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach; a member of the Board of Visitors of Boston University School of Medicine; a Trustee of Boston University, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Recuperative Center Association and Beth Israel Hospital; and is a Director of the University of New Hampshire Foundation. In 1992, he was the first United States Naval Institute Commodore to receive the Ellis Island Congressional Medal of Honor. Mr. Gosman’s son, Andrew is a 1988 graduate of Babson College.\n\nWillie D. Davis\n\nFormer President and CEO of All-Pro Broadcasting Company\n\nWhether tackling education, business ventures, philanthropic service, or an NFL Superbowl title, “Willie” Davis excels with great skill and enthusiasm every time.\n\nAs President and CEO of All-Pro Broadcasting Company, Davis runs four radio stations including KACE in Los Angeles, the number two adult contemporary station and WLUM, Milwaukee’s highest rated top-40 station.\n\nYet Davis was managing challenges way before his radio days. Struggling through a childhood of poverty in Louisiana, he graduated with a BS from Grambling State University in 1956 as a Dean’s List student and captain of the football team.\n\nRunning with his athletic talent, Davis went on to play defensive end for twelve years with the NFL, ten of them as a Green Bay Packer with legendary coach Vince Lombardi. Davis holds the Green Bay Packer record for consecutive games played, never missing one in ten years.\n\nThis amazing feat of stamina was matched only by his success in the record books. He is a member of the five-time World Champion Green Bay Packers; team captain of Superbowl I and II; six-time selection to the NFL-All Pro team; and an inductee into the 1975 Green Bay Packer Hall of Fame.\n\nStill, his greatest athletic milestones were yet to come. In 1981 Willie Davis was selected to the NFL Hall of Fame and the following year was first recipient of the Vince Lombardi Varsity Scout Award. He was voted NFL Man of the Year in 1987 and honored with the Supreme Court Justice Byron White Award to athletes for outstanding service to country, community, and team.\n\nDavis’s football experience nurtured leadership and teamwork skills shaping him for the captain of industry he would become in the business world. While still playing the game, he actively prepared for the future, earning an MBA from the University of Chicago in 1968 and in 1969 retired from football to buy West Coast Beverage Company.\n\nAs president for 18 years, he acquired smaller distributorships and led the wine, beer, and beverage distribution company to steady growth, driving sales up from $2 million in 1970 to $20 million by 1988.\n\nDavis displays this same dedication and drive in boardrooms of the numerous corporations and civic organizations he serves. He is a director of Sara Lee Corporation; K-Mart Corporation; Dow Chemical Company; MGM Grand Incorporated; Alliance Bank; WICOR Incorporated; Johnson Controls Incorporated; LA Gear; Strong Fund; Rally’s Incorporated; Kauffman Foundations; University of Chicago; Marquette University; Occidental College; Milwaukee School of Engineering; and Winston-Salem University.\n\nIn 1984, he served as Director of the US Olympic Committee and President Reagan appointed him to the President’s Commission on Executive Exchange.\n\nLeo Kahn\n\nCo-founder of Staples Inc.\n\nAs an airforce navigator during World War II, Leo Kahn kept a sharp eye on the target. Today at age 80, he continues—with great vigor—to track and capture new markets.\n\nLast fall he opened the Boston region’s largest natural-foods supermarket. Nature’s Heartland in Bedford Mass., is bigger (at 41,000 square feet) with a more price conscious policy than its main competitor, Bread & Circus, owned by Whole Foods Market Inc. of Texas. The innovative store stocks a wide selection of natural and prepared foods. Hearth stone pizza, fresh sushi, and oven ready meals are served up daily for the health-sensitive take-out generation, an underserved $9.2 billion market that has doubled since 1990. Nature’s Heartland is Kahn’s second natural food venture. He was an investor in Fresh Fields Inc., which has 22 stores in Washington, Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia. In 1994 Kahn sold his stake in Fresh Fields.\n\nKahn says it’s easy to come up with new ideas. The challenge, he insists, is to make them work. After the War, he went into the retail grocery business and started what became Purity Supreme, Inc. The company operated with supermarkets, warehouse food and drug stores, and Mom and Pop convenience stores. In 1984 Purity, with annual sales of $800 million, was sold to Supermarkets General Corporation.\n\nLater, Kahn applied the discount warehouse concept to selling paper clips and notepads. He is co-founder and member of the board of directors of Staples, Inc., a retail office supply chain, now publicly traded and worth billions. His retailing expertise is shared in the boardrooms of numerous companies including Health Development Corporation, a chain of exercise centers; Big V Supermarkets; Grossman’s, Inc.; High Road Bicycle Stores; and Cambridge Soundworks. Before acquiring the golden touch in retailing, Kahn spent time as a journalist. He is a graduate of Harvard College and Columbia University’s School of Journalism; and was a beat reporter with the New Bedford Standard Times.\n\nPart of Kahn’s success is his intuitive sense of news and market trends. His advice to entrepreneurs is to grow with the concept. Entrepreneurs need to know when to change and when to be true to their original principles. Master this concept, Kahn is convinced, and you too will soar.\n\nLeslie C. Quick, Jr.\n\nCo-founder of Quick & Reilly\n\nIn 1974, Les Quick founded Quick & Reilly on the principles of customer before company and ethics before profitability.\n\nThe firm soon became the first member of NYSE to offer discount transaction fees to retail investors, and is currently listed as leading discount broker in the US behind Charles Schwab and Fidelity Investors. Since its inception, Quick & Reilly has increased growth and profitability each quarter, earning itself a spot in the best 200 small companies in America named in 1993 by Forbes magazine. Third Quarter Ended November 29, 1996 posted a 22% increase of net income to $18,437,000. Currently The Quick & Reilly Group, Inc., consists of three subsidiaries: Quick & Reilly, Inc., U.S. Clearing Corp., and the JJC Specialist Corp.\n\nThe company recently established a presence in the international market through their Quick & Reilly Limited subsidiary. It offers institutional discount brokerage services through an office near Zurich and an office in London. Combined, the subsidiaries represent 116 national brokerage offices, an execution and clearing service with a client base of over 300 firms, and a market for 280 New York Stock Exchange issues, representing 230 companies, including 44 S&P 500 corporations.\n\nIn 1950, Quick graduated from Widener University with an undergraduate degree in Business Administration. His business experience includes vice president and business manager of Forbes magazine and president of Leslie Quick Associates, a money management firm that Quick founded prior to the Quick & Reilly Group.\n\nThe company is a conservative, family-run business that has been deliberately slow to expand to avoid exposure in depressed business cycles, and bases the company’s success on low cost service for investors, strategic growth and acquisition and effective cost control. Since 1983 Quick & Reilly has provided their customers with convenient electronic access to trading services. Quick attributes strong results this quarter in part, to the successful launch of QuickWay Net, a 24 hour trading service on the Internet.\n\nThomas G. Stemberg\n\nCo-founder of Staples Inc.\n\nThomas Stemberg is founder, chairman of the board, and chief executive officer, Staples, Inc., pioneer of the office superstore industry with more than 620 office products superstores throughout North America, Germany, and the UK. Staples is one of the fastest growing specialty retailers in North America. In 1995 the company became the sixth publicly traded US company to reach $3 billion in annual sales in less than ten years.\n\nStaples employs more than 25,000 associates, both full and part time. For fiscal year 1996, Staples reported sales of $4.0 billion. Tom Stemberg has a formula for retail success: devote your career to developing and implementing bold new ways for customers to save money.\n\nStemberg, fresh out of Harvard College (’71) and Harvard Business School (as a George F. Baker Scholar, ’73), joined Jewel Companies’ corporate training program in 1973. He trained in every department of Jewel’s Star Markets stores, moved to headquarters, and rose to vice president of sales and merchandising in 1980.\n\nAt Star Market, Stemberg developed and launched the first line of generic, or unbranded, foods to be sold in the US. While most in the food industry dismissed the price-cutting idea as too radical, the overwhelming consumer response gained Star national headlines. Star’s success with that program spawned a national trend; generics are now offered by every major supermarket chain in the country. By 1982, Star Markets’ sales ranking in the competitive Boston market had risen from fourth place to a dead heat (with Leo Kahn’s Purity Supreme chain) for first.\n\nThat year, Stemberg moved on to Connecticut-based First National Supermarkets as senior vice president of sales and merchandising. In 1983, he was named president of its Edwards-Finast division. He led the company out of the doldrums, in part by opening a network of high-volume megastores under the Edwards Food Warehouse banner. The Edwards formula was simple: cut costs, buy in volume, and slash selling prices.\n\nThat’s the formula that Stemberg put to work in developing Staples, the Office Superstore, and in pioneering the deep discount office supply industry. With the backing of former supermarket adversary Leo Kahn, he founded Staples, Inc. in 1985, and opened its first store in May, 1986.\n\nStemberg serves as a director of PETsMART, another dynamic deep-discount retailer, and Duane Reade Drug Stores. He maintains close ties to his alma mater, Harvard; his many associations there include the post of co-chairman of Friends of Harvard Basketball. He serves on the Visiting Committee of Harvard Business School; the board of Overseers of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; and the Executive Council of the Archdiocese of Boston Inner City Scholarship Fund. Stemberg received the 1996 Torch of Liberty Award from the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nSir Richard Branson\n\nFounder of The Virgin Group\n\n“You will either go to prison or become a millionaire,” the headmaster told the young man. That was nearly 30 years ago, and while Richard Branson never made it to the “gaol,” he has most assuredly become a millionaire…many times over. He is founder and chairman of the Virgin Group of Companies, one of the United Kingdom’s largest private, multinational groups, consisting of airline, media, entertainment, and travel interests.\n\nBranson is filled with ideas. Where others see pitfalls and disaster, he sees opportunity and success. What he lacks in sophisticated knowledge of a business, he is able to coax from others. His first enterprise was a magazine called Student, which he started at age 16 by selling $10,000 in advertising over the telephone. It was a commercial failure, yet somehow, Branson had been able to attract such notables as Vanessa Redgrave and John LeCarre to write for it. A year later, he created a student advisory service center to help young people with medical, psychological, and legal problems.\n\nBy 1970, with ideas still bristling, Branson founded Virgin as a mail-order record company and then opened a record shop in London. In 1972, he built a recording studio and started a record label. His first big break came when his friend and composer, Mike Oldfield, recorded “Tubular Bells,” an album that sold more than five million copies. Over the years, such artists as Steve Winwood, Paula Abdul, Belinda Carlisle, Genesis, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, the Rolling Stones, Janet Jackson, and many other well-known performers helped make Virgin one of the top six record companies in the world. In 1992, Branson sold Virgin Records to Thorn/EMI for slightly less than one billion dollars.\n\nIn 1984, Richard Branson entered other ventures. One of those was Virgin Atlantic Airways. While the flying has not always been smooth for Virgin, Branson believes the future of the airline is secure. “The worst is definitely over,” he says. Confident of his prediction and his ability, Branson has expanded the range of products carrying the Virgin brand. He has licensed the Virgin name for use on personal computers, and has established joint ventures to market Virgin vodka and Virgin cola.\n\nWhile his business and management style embodies boundless energy –15-hour workdays are not uncommon – and a flair for the outrageous, Branson has made the time to serve as a trustee with several charitable organizations. Among these are the Healthcare Foundation, a leading charity organization instrumental in fighting AIDS through education. The Foundation has also become involved in a lobbying campaign, called “Parents Against Tobacco,” to restrict tobacco advertising and sponsorship in sports. Branson has helped to raise more than $50 million for these efforts.\n\nWhat does the Virgin name mean? “We’re a company that likes to take on the giants,” Branson says with his puckish grin. “In too many businesses, the giants have had things their own way. We’re going to have a lot of fun competing with them.” It may be fun for Branson, the man with a million ideas, but perhaps not for “the giants.”\n\nEly Callaway Jr.\n\nFounder of Callaway Golf\n\nEly Callaway was told by his father, “Don’t go to work for the family.” It seemed like strange advice at the time, since practically everyone else in La Grange, Georgia, worked for one or another of his Uncle Abner’s businesses. But the young man, a recent graduate of Emory University who had studied history and been president of his class, took his father’s advice and began to carve his own niche in the business world…and what a niche it is.\n\nJoining the U.S. Army Reserve, Callaway found himself at the Philadelphia quartermaster depot, the Army’s Central Apparel Procurement Headquarters since 1776. During World War II, he was the sole purchasing and contracting officer responsible for the Army’s procurement of cotton clothing. Perhaps more important, he became friends with Levi Strauss, Hart Schaffner & Marx, and executives at the Arrow Shirt Co. After the war, he went to work for Deering, Milliken & Company, a giant textile supplier, figuring that “the best thing I can do is get a job selling to the people I’ve been dealing with.”\n\nLeaving Deering, Milliken & Company in 1954, Callaway joined forces with a 1978 inductee into Babson’s Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs, Royal Little, founder and chairman of Textron. While at Textron, Callaway oversaw the merger of American Woolen and Robbins Mills. Later, when Textron sold Little’s division to Burlington Industries, Callaway went along, too. By 1968, he had become president of Burlington, “the biggest textile company on earth,” he would proudly proclaim.\n\nCallaway’s goal at Burlington, however, was the chairmanship – nothing less would do – and when this was not forthcoming five years later, he left Burlington and went west, to California, to make wine. Callaway gambled his own money (“I wanted to keep my friends,” he explains) and began raising grapes in an area that was considered by many to be nothing more than desert. His risk paid off in spectacular fashion in 1981 when he sold his successful vineyard and winery to Hiram Walker for $14 million.\n\nWhen he was past 60, Ely Callaway turned his attention to golf, one of his favorite pastimes – he had been a tournament champion in his youth. Unable to keep his restless entrepreneurial spirit under control, Callaway founded The Callaway Golf Company in 1983. As with every venture with which he had ever been involved, Ely Callaway made a total commitment to his new venture. Incorporating the company’s patented design concept, Callaway introduced the golfing world to Big Berth Metal Woods, Big Bertha War Bird, Big Bertha Irons, and the new line of Great Big Bertha Drivers and Fairway Woods. Today, Callaway Golf is the industry sales leader, and Ely Callaway is a master entrepreneur who has turned his dream into reality – “mainly due to sweat and lots of luck,” he says.\n\nA. Andronico Luksic\n\nFormer Chairman of the Luksic Group\n\nAndronico Luksic built his fortune by following a simple business dictum: “Follow the philosophy of the ant” – that is, focus on accomplishing little things, and soon you’ll move mountains. The Luksic Group has already moved some very big mountains.\n\nThe Group is into banking and brewing. It mints coins and mines copper. It serves school lunches and sells cellular phones. It encompasses six listed companies and scores of privately held companies. But is wasn’t always that way.\n\nAndronico Luksic bought his first copper mine in 1954. At the same time, he purchased a stake in a Ford dealership that served the booming copper economy around his hometown of Anofagasta, Chile. By the end of the 1950’s, he had expanded his dealership into an equipment leasing company, serving the big mines of the region, and he controlled the agency. He also used part of the proceeds from the mine sale to venture into fishing, buying out Star-Kist’s local subsidiary.\n\nHis businesses prospered during the 1960’s when he made several important investments in mining and other companies. It was during this period that he gained control of the Lota Schwager coal mines and Madeco, the dominant copper products maker. In the 1970’s, the arrival of the Unidad Popular government marked the beginning of the expansion and internationalization of Andronico Luksic’s businesses. He began looking at opportunities outside Chile, and in particular, in Argentina. He sent some of his executives to open a Ford agency and an iron-ore mine in Brazil. He established a packaging company in Colombia. In 1990, he bought a copper manufacturing company in Argentina and several other firms.\n\nToday, Andronico Luksic heads Chile’s first truly multinational corporation. The Luksic Group owns Chile’s largest brewery, Cia Cerveceria Unidas; Madeco, the copper products company; and a major food products group, Empresas Lucchetti. The Group’s assets also include the railway that ties the country’s copper belt to the sea, two large banks – Banco O’Higgins and Banco de Santiago – a telecommunications company, several mines, ranches, and one of Santiago’s finest hotels, the Carrera. Currently, the Luksic Group consists of more than 50 companies with assets of $9 billion.\n\nAndronico Luksic has demonstrated that hard work, determination, a keen eye for business, and the ability to “follow the philosophy of the ant” can bring success in a variety of areas.\n\nThe Honorable Craig R. Benson ’77, H’03\n\nCEO of Soft Draw Investments; former Chairman and CEO at Cabletron Systems, Inc.; Former Governor of the State of New Hampshire\n\nIf there is one thing that distinguishes the true entrepreneur, it is the ability to succeed in the face of adversity.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs struggle with limited resources, endure the treacherous start-up years, and eventually flourish. The founders of Cabletron Systems, Inc., a computer connectivity corporation in Rochester, New Hampshire, exemplify the triumphant spirit of the entrepreneur.\n\nTheirs is a textbook example of a start-up business. The company began in 1983 when S. Robert Levine, then an independent electronics contractor, was approached by a customer who requested lengths of cable that were shorter than what conventional suppliers were willing to furnish. Craig R. Benson B’77, a business contact of Levine’s, suggested that he buy a large order of cable, cut it, and fill the customer’s order. Levine and Benson would sell the remaining lengths of cable. The two hauled all of the cable into Levine’s Ashland, Massachusetts garage and, during their lunch hours, cut it into shorter lengths. The first year, they made a modest $100,000 doing exactly what they had done that first day in the garage.\n\nFrom there, the partners continued to provide connectivity cable to customers for what is now known as networking. They also began installing the networks and providing the hardware needed to control them. In 1991, Benson and Levine shared the honor of being named Inc. magazine’s “Entrepreneurs of the Year.” By January 1992, Cabletron’s growth and success had accelerated to the point that its corporate headquarters building was selected by President George Bush as one of the key stops on his New Hampshire primary campaign. “Welcome to Cabletron, Mr. President,” read the huge sign that greeted him as he entered Rochester.\n\nTheir distinct personalities and skills make them unlikely, but complementary, partners. The industry press refers to them as “the odd couple.” S. Robert Levine, president and chief executive officer of Cabletron and the student voted “least likely to succeed” in his high school class, is a powerhouse of energy and dedication. His maverick tactics add the character to Cabletron that distinguishes the company from its competition. Craig R. Benson, chairman and chief operating officer, is married and has two children. With a personality quite opposite from that of his partner, Benson is the financial driving force. His attention to cost details and professional management of the company’s rapid growth have been essential to Cabletron’s rise in the industry.\n\nBoth entrepreneurs have fought the bureaucracy that can accompany corporate growth, and focus on creating an environment that will position their employees to perform and respond to the needs of customers. Says Levine, “I hire dedicated people, brighter than me, and give them the chance to succeed.” Today, Levine and Benson’s Cabletron, once a garage start-up, proves that vision and dedication hold the keys to business success.\n\nArthur M. Blank ’63, H’98\n\nOwner and Chairman, Blank Family of Businesses; Co-founder of The Home Depot\n\n“I think of myself primarily as a servant leader. My job is simply to support the people in our stores, to create a workplace that excites them. If I do my job well, they’ll enjoy personal growth. And from that, the company will find financial growth,” says Arthur M. Blank ’63 H’98\n\nIndeed, the formula is working. The Home Depot, co-founded by Blank and Bernard Marcus, has grown since 1979 to 350 stores in the United States and Canada, with total sales in 1994 exceeding $12 billion, by far the largest home improvement retailer in the United States.\n\nBack in 1979, the picture did not look quite so optimistic for Marcus and Blank. Both had been dismissed by their hardware retail employer, but responded with resiliency. They joined forces to fill a need they had observed in the industry: a hardware store with value and customer service. Their new store, The Home Depot, was built around a commitment to the “do-it-yourself,” or DIY, business. Low prices, high volume, and, most importantly, service and quality remain the cornerstones of The Home Depot.\n\nEmployees are the other essential element in The Home Depot equation. They are encouraged to hold a stake in the company through stock ownership. Offsetting our conventional ideas about organizational structure, Marcus notes that, “the employee who rings up the sale is the highest guy in the company.” Employees describe The Home Depot as “our store” and shoppers as “our customers.” Home Depot employees are well-known for their loyalty. After Hurricane Andrew struck southern Florida in the fall of 1992, some employees barricaded themselves in their stores to prevent looting even before they had returned to their own homes. When the stores reopened, they sold plywood and other essential supplies at a loss.\n\nArthur Blank was already an entrepreneur as an undergraduate at Babson, where he ran both a landscaping business and laundry service, and has not lost the hands-on approach to management. Bernard Marcus, the son of Russian immigrants, put himself through the Rutgers College of Pharmacy and worked in pharmaceutical sales before switching to retail and then later to hardware retailing. He still loves nothing so much as walking through The Home Depot, meeting with customers. Both Blank and Marcus are frequently found wearing the distinctive orange apron (competitors refer to The Home Depot as “agent orange”) and jeans as they visit stores throughout the southern, western, and northeastern United States.\n\nPivotal to the continued growth of the company is their “work in process” attitude that leads to continuous improvement. When Marcus discusses The Home Depot employees, he says, “We listen to them. We care about them. We do the things they say are right. And when they show how stupid we are in the systems we have, we change the systems.” No wonder the company is among “America’s Most Admired,” according to Fortune magazine’s 1994 ranking.\n\nEdward C. Johnson III\n\nFormer Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Investments\n\nNed Johnson is a native Bostonian, a man who has propelled the business started by his father into an investment company known worldwide for its long-term performance.\n\nPerhaps he is not the first person one would expect to find promoting the Japanese concept of kaizen. But kaizen, or “making small improvements in all areas of the company over an extended period of time” in the words of Johnson, is an accurate description of the impact this business leader has had on Fidelity Investments.\n\nNed Johnson stays out of the public eye, preferring to spend quiet time with his wife and three children, collect art and antiques, and play tennis. Despite a low profile, he has earned the respect of his community, his business peers, and Fidelity employees, who look forward to Johnson’s visits to their department floor. Often, he offers work process suggestions and new ideas. His involvement in so many different aspects of Fidelity’s business is testimony to the leadership of this influential entrepreneur.\n\nEarly in life, Johnson demonstrated an interest in machines. He enjoyed taking them apart and examining them to understand how they functioned. Eventually, what most intrigued him was the power of computers, and he learned as much as he could about them. Today, it is clear that the application of information technology, spearheaded by Johnson himself, provides a strong competitive advantage to his successful company.\n\nJohnson joined Fidelity, the family business, as a stock analyst in 1957 immediately after receiving his bachelor’s degree from Harvard. Said his college roommate, “He wasn’t a scholar, but he was reading a Wall Street Journal before I even knew what it was.” So eager was he to be judged on his own merit, Johnson referred to his father as “Mr. Johnson” while at the office. From 1961 to 1965, Ned ran Fidelity’s Trend Fund, which ranked No.1 among growth funds throughout the period. In 1972, he was named president of the company.\n\nNed Johnson is credited with bringing about profound change, not only to this private investment company, but also to the industry at large. His innovations include the introduction of check writing on Money Market funds as well as identifying and entering the enormous market for supplying discount brokerage services to banks, insurance companies, and consumers. Johnson’s vision and risk taking have moved the company forward for more than 35 years and he has always had an eye toward the long-term success of the business. Under his leadership, Fidelity invested in new computers and telephone systems, even in 1974, a year when assets dropped by one-third. These investments positioned Fidelity to better serve its customers in the bull market of the 1980’s, using innovations such as toll-free investor services and walk-in investor centers across the United States.\n\nNed Johnson became chairman and chief executive of Fidelity in 1977, and today holds the positions of CEO, chairman of the board, and director, FMR Corp. Even so, he is a frequent visitor to the computer room for updates on new technology, and follows stocks and funds from his desktop. In the Boston offices, he has been known to join the legion of telephone representatives so that he can learn from the customers, who are the best source for Fidelity’s ongoing innovations.\n\nS. Robert Levine\n\nFormer President and CEO of Cabletron Systems Inc.\n\nIf there is one thing that distinguishes the true entrepreneur, it is the ability to succeed in the face of adversity. Successful entrepreneurs struggle with limited resources, endure the treacherous start-up years, and eventually flourish. The founders of Cabletron Systems, Inc., a computer connectivity corporation in Rochester, New Hampshire, exemplify the triumphant spirit of the entrepreneur.\n\nTheirs is a textbook example of a start-up business. The company began in 1983 when S. Robert Levine, then an independent electronics contractor, was approached by a customer who requested lengths of cable that were shorter than what conventional suppliers were willing to furnish. Craig R. Benson ’77, H’03, a business contact of Levine's, suggested that he buy a large order of cable, cut it, and fill the customer's order. Levine and Benson would sell the remaining lengths of cable. The two hauled all of the cable into Levine's Ashland, Massachusetts garage and, during their lunch hours, cut it into shorter lengths. The first year, they made a modest $100,000 doing exactly what they had done that first day in the garage.\n\nFrom there, the partners continued to provide connectivity cable to customers for what is now known as networking. They also began installing the networks and providing the hardware needed to control them. In 1991, Benson and Levine shared the honor of being named Inc. magazine's \"Entrepreneurs of the Year.\" By January 1992, Cabletron's growth and success had accelerated to the point that its corporate headquarters building was selected by President George Bush as one of the key stops on his New Hampshire primary campaign. \"Welcome to Cabletron, Mr. President,\" read the huge sign that greeted him as he entered Rochester.\n\nTheir distinct personalities and skills make them unlikely, but complementary, partners. The industry press refers to them as \"the odd couple.\" S. Robert Levine, president and chief executive officer of Cabletron and the student voted \"least likely to succeed\" in his high school class, is a powerhouse of energy and dedication. His maverick tactics add the character to Cabletron that distinguishes the company from its competition. Craig R. Benson, chairman and chief operating officer, is married and has two children. With a personality quite opposite from that of his partner, Benson is the financial driving force. His attention to cost details and professional management of the company's rapid growth have been essential to Cabletron's rise in the industry.\n\nBoth entrepreneurs have fought the bureaucracy that can accompany corporate growth, and focus on creating an environment that will position their employees to perform and respond to the needs of customers. Says Levine, \"I hire dedicated people, brighter than me, and give them the chance to succeed.\" Today, Levine and Benson's Cabletron, once a garage start-up, proves that vision and dedication hold the keys to business success.\n\nBernard Marcus\n\nCo-founder, former Chairman and CEO of The Home Depot\n\nLeon A. Gorman\n\nFormer President and Chairman of L.L.Bean Inc.\n\nOn the wall for all to see, are letters of complaint and praise from customers. Over the letters is a sign that reads “messages from the boss.”\n\nThis bold display supports the principles of Leon Leonwood \"L.L.\" Bean, who founded the business in 1912. Bean counseled, \"Sell good merchandise at a reasonable profit, treat your customers like human beings, and they'll always come back for more.\"\n\nIn 1912, Mr. Bean borrowed $400 to produce his now famous rubber-bottomed hunting boots. Bean designed the boots himself to keep his feet dry when he traversed the Main wilderness. The unique design quickly became popular with other outdoor lovers and the company became a successful venture. It employed 120 people and had annual sales of $3 million when Mr. Bean died in 1967 at age 94.\n\nHis grandson, Leon Gorman, became president upon his grandfather's death. A graduate of Bowdoin College, he came to Bean in 1961 after Navy destroyer service and a trainee job a Filene's department stores. He brought with him a new vision for the company. Hiring some aggressive young managers, Gorman pioneered the mail-order business that has sustained an annual growth rate of nearly 20 percent since he took the helm, and launched innovations in data base management and customer service. Now a giant specialty mail-order business, L.L. Bean serves as a model for the industry.\n\nL.L. Bean relies on the many people who perform tasks more efficiently than machines and \"who don't break down in the process,\" states John Findlay, Bean's senior vice president for operations. By emphasizing human potential, L.L. Bean has become the most successful and efficient mail-order business in the United States and perhaps the world.\n\nThey do it by placing a high value on the employee and the customer. Employee ideas are sought after and listened to, and have led to streamlining the distribution centers. Even seasonal employees are given substantial training. The company's ethical treatment of employees makes it an extremely desirable place to work - doubling the work force for the holidays poses no problem for L.L. Bean.\n\nTo L.L. Bean the customer is sovereign. L.L. Bean offers an unconditional guarantee: they will exchange anything for any reason. Orders are processed in two or three days, unlike most mail-order companies where two weeks is typical. And if customers have to call for any reason, they will find operators so friendly and courteous that they may feel as if they've made a new friend.\n\nUncommon in today's business climate, L.L. Bean remains a family held company. Three nephews, Bill, Jim, and Shawn Gorman are also currently employed with the company. It is unlikely that you will see LLBEAN on the New York Stock Exchange soon. Mr. Gorman has a broad smile when he declares, \"Everyone seems happy with the present arrangement.\" And they plan to leave it that way.\n\nEarl G. Graves\n\nFounder of Black Enterprise Magazine; Chairman of Earl G. Graves Ltd.\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of BLACK ENTERPRISE, Earl G. Graves reflected, “I think we've been the drum major in this country for black business and for black professionals. We've been able to show that, when given the opportunity, black people can be as good as anybody, and in many cases, better.”\n\nEarl G. Graves may be the best illustration of his own point.\n\nThe son of West Indian immigrants, Graves began his career as an administrative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Following the Senator's assassination, Graves established his own consulting company to advise corporations on urban affairs and economic development. Graves observed an increasing number of people like him - African-American professionals who needed information on careers, personal finance, and the unwritten rules of networking in corporate America. The visionary entrepreneur created BLACK ENTERPRISE to speak to this need.\n\nThroughout its 24-year history, BLACK ENTERPRISE has followed a mission of service. It has advised African-Americans about how to navigate business and government organizations to attain positions of influence, and how to bring success to their personal and professional lives. BLACK ENTERPRISE communicates the importance of black-owned businesses to the economy by each year listing the BLACK ENTERPRISE 100 industrial/service businesses in the country that are owned by blacks.\n\nIn his role as editor of BLACK ENTERPRISE, Earl Graves strives to influence the future as well as the present. He urges black professionals to safeguard the wealth and security of future generations with a simple formula: teaching their children the value of money.\n\nThe entire Graves family is closely involved in their businesses. Barbara Graves, now a professional grandmother, at one time ran every department by sales at BLACK ENTERPRISE. Two sons, Butch and John, work for the magazine and Michael works for Pepsi-Cola of Washington D.C.\n\nGraves' professional achievements are inspiration to all entrepreneurs. Today, he is the president and chief executive officer of Earl G. Graves, Ltd., the parent company of Earl G. Graves Publishing Company, publisher of BLACK ENTERPRISE magazine. He is also the chairman and CEO of Pepsi-Cola of Washington D.C., the largest minority-owned Pepsi-Cola franchise in the United States. He was recognized in 1972 as one of the ten most outstanding minority businessmen in the country by the President of the United States, and has received the National Award of Excellence for his achievements in minority business enterprise.\n\nHowever, the finest and most lasting tribute to Graves' economic, political, and social influence may be the fact that the gross sales of the BLACK ENTERPRISE 100 companies has increased from less than $450 million in 1970 to more than $9 billion today. The owners and managers of many of these companies would be the first to tell you how much of their success is due to Earl G. Graves.\n\nJacob Stolt-Nielsen, Jr. P’87\n\nFormer Chairman and CEO, Stolt Tankers and Terminals (Holdings) S.A.\n\nFor over a century, shipping and risk-taking have been characteristic of the Stolt-Nielsen family. In 1891, Botholf Stolt-Nielsen invested 60 percent of his savings in a deadweight steamer, and by 1899 he was the third largest ship owner in Norway. The family has owned ships ever since - through two world wars and good and bad economic times.\n\nJacob Stolt-Nielsen Jr. founded Stolt Tankers and Terminals in 1959. It was his interest in carrying a variety of cargoes aboard a single ship that led him to a position of prominence in the shipping industry and that gave rise to the world's largest parcel tanker company. His secrets included double-skinned tanks and independent pumps, pipes, and temperature controls for each tank. This breakthrough permitted the company to handle even toxic chemicals safely - although company policy is to refuse any such cargoes - or any of over 800 other liquids. Stolt-Nielsen's most sophisticated parcel tankers have 58 stainless steel and coated cargo compartments.\n\nStolt-Nielsen controls a variety of ancillary shipping operations. For example, the terminal division of Stolt Tankers and Terminals operates the terminals where the ships are berthed and liquids stored. Stolt Terminals are located throughout North and South America. There is also a transfer terminal in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Stolt Tank Containers, the company's fastest growing business, operates of 5,000 intermodal stainless steel tank containers. In the early 1970's, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen started two new marine businesses, seafood and underwater contracting. While part of the Stolt organization, they have operated independently since 1977. Stolt Sea Farm is an aquaculture company employing modern techniques to breed, farm, and process quality seafood in controlled environments. Stolt Seaway is a major marine and subsea contractor specializing in the installation, inspection, repair, and maintenance of underwater structures for the offshore oil and gas industry.\n\nFor over 100 years, Stolt-Nielsen has been called the first name in world-wide shipping. In the company's 1991 annual report, Jacob Stolt-Nielsen Jr. wrote, \"It would have been fun to show my grandfather one of our stainless steel chemical tankers today. It would also be fun to see what they will look like a century from now.\" In all probability, those tankers will also bear the Stolt-Nielsen name.\n\nRobert A. Swanson\n\nCo-founder of Genentech\n\nRobert Swanson is not easily deterred. In 1975, when he first became intrigued by the commercial potential of recombinant DNA technology, he confronted a wall of skepticism. Many scientists and businesspeople believed that commercialization was 20 years away. In a meeting with Herbert Boyer, a biochemist at the University of California at San Francisco, the two agreed to investigate the commercial feasibility of biotechnology. It was a move that gave birth to Genentech.\n\nFrom the beginning, Swanson realized the opportunities for recombinant DNA technology to create beneficial products. Under his guidance, Genentech provided broad applications of science to modern society, developing new products such as human insulin, interferons, human growth hormone, and thrombolytic agents. Recently, the company announced that is will"
