        "text": "Thank you to everyone who has submitted Lockdown poems. On Sunday 5 July 2020 there was a Poetry of the Lockdown event as part of Ledbury Poetry Festival Online. The event featured a fascinating selection of Lockdown inspired poems, including poets commissioned by LPF, Naomi Shihab Nye, Sarala Estruch, Suzannah Evans, Elaine Beckett and Kim Moore. They read alongside poets who submitted to Ledbury Poetry Festival’s online call out. Hosted by Chloe Garner.\n\nThese poems were written during Lockdown and the Coronavirus pandemic, at a time when it seemed the whole country, and in fact the whole world was going through the same crisis. Though of course everyone’s individual experience of this situation is unique. I am aware, as many people are, that for people and places in the world, the challenges are huge and sometimes extremely harrowing, compared to my own. Nonetheless, in reading these poems, I find reflections on, and insight into, my own experiences. As well as differences. Other ways of thinking about, or seeing, what is happening in this present time. I have found these poems extremely resonant, and I hope you will too.\n\nThank you to everyone for their contribution.\n\nChloe Garner, Artistic Director\n\nYour Poems\n\nThe Same Boat\n\nby Julie Sheldon\n\n‘We’re all in the same boat’ they say\n\nBut I would disagree\n\nSo many different sailing crafts\n\nUpon this stormy sea\n\nSome sail on ocean liners\n\nIn comfort, style, and ease\n\nRelaxing on their balconies\n\n….Sipping their G & Ts\n\nSome speed along in motor boats\n\nAs if it’s all ok……\n\nWith little care for smaller crafts\n\nWhich may get in their way\n\nSome struggle on their battleships\n\nWhere nothing’s going right\n\nEndlessly preparing…..\n\nFor the next relentless fight\n\nSome huddle in their lifeboats…\n\nAnd pray that they’ll be saved\n\nHoping for a calmer sea…\n\nAnd fearing every wave\n\nSome drift around upon their rafts….\n\nThey barely stay afloat\n\nThey’re praying for a change of luck…\n\nAnd chance to board a boat\n\nSome haven’t found their sea legs yet….\n\nAnd dread each wave and swell\n\nThey’re struggling to stay upright\n\nAnd don’t feel very well\n\nSo whilst you’re on your journey\n\nTo a safe and calmer port\n\nLook out for fellow sailors\n\nWho may need some support\n\nCould you throw them a life belt?\n\nOr a paddle or an oar?\n\nPerhaps you could help guide them\n\nA bit nearer to the shore\n\nThis poem was later made into a short film that is now on YouTube\n\nSome of the other contributions were read at a Zoom session in Ledbury’s online Festival in July 2020. Recordings of these are included with the following contributions where we have them.\n\nBubble Trouble\n\nby Julie Sheldon\n\nI am a single granny\n\nWith daughter, and a son\n\nI’ve got a newish lover\n\nAnd he’s a lot of fun!\n\nNow I can make a ‘bubble’\n\nBut which house do I choose?\n\nSomeone will be offended\n\nNo matter what I do\n\nDo I go to my daughter’s?\n\nAnd help wipe snotty noses\n\nOr do I see my lover?\n\nFor candlelight and roses\n\nDo I go to my son’s house?\n\nAnd risk an ear bashing\n\nOr shall I go to lover boy’s?\n\nAnd have some nights of passion\n\nAnd then, there’s my friend Maureen\n\nWho has nobody else\n\nSo shall I spend some time with her?\n\nAnd not think of myself\n\nAm I a granny dutiful?\n\nOn whom they can depend\n\nAm I a selfish lover?\n\nOr a dedicated friend?\n\nThis really is a problem\n\nThat I could do without\n\nIn fact, it was much simpler\n\nWhen I could NOT go out\n\nOh Boris! Why’ve you caused me\n\nSuch a lot of trouble\n\nI really don’t know what to do\n\nWith this flippin’ ‘social bubble’\n\nCatch a Virus\n\nby Clive Grewcock\n\nWhen I was at school we used\n\nPencils and blackboard and jotters,\n\nNow things are virtual,\n\nBut you can still catch a virus\n\nFrom coughing and snotters.\n\nSome of us\n\nby Julie Sheldon\n\nSome of us must stay at home\n\nAnd not go out the door\n\nSome of us are working\n\nLike we’ve never worked before\n\nSome of us are falling out\n\nWith siblings, Dads, and Mothers\n\nSome of us are reaching out\n\nAnd looking after others\n\nSome of us are keeping busy\n\nDoing lots of jobs\n\nSome of us have given up……\n\nWe’re turning into slobs\n\nSome of us are playing games\n\nAnd learning brand new hobbies\n\nSome of us are still ‘no good’\n\nAnd watching out for Bobbies\n\nSome of us have lots of friends\n\nTo text with and to phone\n\nSome of us have no one\n\nAnd feel that we’re alone\n\nSome of us feel positive\n\nAnd think that we’re in charge\n\nSome of us feel anxious\n\nAnd fear the world at large\n\nSome of us have footpaths\n\nTo cycle, walk, and jog\n\nSome of us have nowhere nice\n\nTo even walk the dog\n\nSome of us are welcoming\n\nNew babies being born\n\nSome of us have lost loved ones\n\nAnd cannot truly mourn\n\nNone of us will ever know\n\nWhat’s really going on\n\nNone of us will think the same\n\nWhen all of this is done\n\nAll of us can choose to spend\n\nOur days in fear and dread…..BUT\n\nAll of us can choose to plan\n\nFor better days ahead\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature?\n\nby Julie Sheldon\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nTaking back control\n\nQuestioning the actions\n\nOf every living soul\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nAsking us to stop\n\nTo think about our planet\n\nAnd treasure what we’ve got\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nSlowing us right down\n\nTime to look around us\n\nAnd see what can be found\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nAsking us to think\n\nWhat is it that we really need?\n\nLove, health and food and drink\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nGiving us the time\n\nTo be more understanding,\n\nGenerous and kind\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nAsking us to care\n\nTo think about each other\n\nAnd sometimes just be there\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nSending us this pain\n\nTime to re-evaluate\n\nBefore we’re all insane\n\nWhat if it’s just Nature\n\nSetting us a test\n\nTo try to save our planet\n\nLet’s do our very best!\n\nVeins\n\nby Emma Wells\n\nA Venetian network:\n\nmeet, fuse, form.\n\nWatery channelled communication;\n\naqua-hued veins – a circuitry of life,\n\ncommerce, love, society.\n\nGondoliers float, promising infatuation\n\non muddy churned inlets –\n\noverexposed to humanity.\n\nOur exploits.\n\nStripy candy costumes entice sugar-\n\ncraved tourists to taste the city’s sweetest wares;\n\nwhere love’s promise is sold\n\nat an extortionate price.\n\nLondon’s Underground:\n\na multi-hued snake\n\nweaving textures, colours, shapes.\n\nIts pathways are arterial veins\n\nrushing to and fro perpetually linking\n\nnerve endings,\n\nvital organs,\n\nsacred hearts in the palms of its metal soul.\n\nMedical corridors mimic veinal format –\n\neach cubicle a tiny blood clot hiding drama,\n\nrisk, suppressed panic.\n\nNurses, doctors, registrars skittle towards pins\n\nin a frenzy of duty, service, long shifts.\n\nSweat drips from their overplayed,\n\nuncool veins.\n\nCity airports heave with a throng of tourism –\n\neach department gate an exit. A blood outlet.\n\nDrops plummet from airborne wings as they rise\n\nto fruition,\n\ndistant climes…\n\nOnboard, a central veinal corridor acts\n\nas a skeletal backbone for all:\n\na bringing of nourishment, safety, scarlet-clad,\n\novertly wide, waxy smiles.\n\nTarmac veins cast steely maze-like patterns\n\nacross London’s aerial views –\n\nthe M25: a beating pulse, ventricles, a central pathway.\n\nTraffic jams mimic reduced fluency.\n\nMotor.\n\nFlow.\n\nJam.\n\nStop.\n\nFluid ceases to rotate, creating oxygen\n\nstarved passengers.\n\nCars line up heaving laboured breath –\n\ntoo long captured in tin-canned warmth.\n\nSocial media: the loudest heart thrum.\n\nShe beckons all focus, mind matter,\n\nconscious, current thought.\n\nThis siren winds her veinous, electronic\n\ncircuitry tightly amidst upheld fingers.\n\nWilling hostages. Compliant. Passively taken.\n\nPhone charge leads are fibrous veinal columns:\n\nconnecting, reaching, formatting a virtual,\n\nveinous world.\n\nIts orthography was perfect\n\nby Aurora B.E. Blue\n\nIts orthography was perfect,\n\nlock – down, protect the NHS, save lives, control the virus, social distance, stay alert,\n\n“wake up! put on masks! the time has come!\n\nBut beyond choking pollution, lungs fill with death,\n\nchanging day in, night out, dizzying times.\n\nKnock – Knock – who’s there? All the G’S outside our door, 1-5, popping away constantly!\n\nIt draws right angles in front of your eyes but some see through it all …\n\nStill Orangutans fall from trees …\n\nJaws are control – shaped.

The sky\n\nis the colour it does best.\n\nI have changed the contents\n\nof the cats’ litter trays and\n\ndisinfected what needs\n\ndisinfecting. Now I sit here\n\nin my brown leather chair,\n\nankles crossed on its matching\n\nfootstool, cup of cappuccino\n\nat my elbow, scrawling this.\n\nA small buzzing that’s not\n\nmy ears, a bee or wasp\n\nmy weak eyes can’t locate,\n\notherwise quiet in an old\n\nfarmhouse at the end of a long\n\nwell-pitted track a world\n\nand worlds away from other\n\npeople’s versions of isolation,\n\nsocially distanced by\n\nscribbles in a pad.\n\nDefenceless\n\nby Tess Biddington\n\nhttps://www.poetry-festival.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defenceless-TB.mp3\n\nChoosing January and\n\nfor the third attempt\n\nto withdraw the medication\n\nthat keeps the walls neutral\n\nand conforming for me, that\n\nsets the bar (no lower but\n\nno higher) those weevils\n\nare returning to the woodwork,\n\nchurning through old rot and\n\nmaking new.\n\nThere is so much\n\nto consume, forces and events\n\nallied to fight off the choking,\n\nchronic obstructions with\n\na weapon of its own. Maps\n\ncolour the insurrection’s\n\nmost brutal invasions; satellites\n\npick out the keloids, tiny scars\n\nin their rows on the red earth,\n\nwhere we are or will be buried.\n\nWe are made enemies, deprived\n\nof touch, faces barely readable,\n\nwe die alone\n\nour last breath no release.\n\nAnd, for days, sun pulls seedlings\n\nfrom their coats, wildflowers\n\nare named by chalk scrawls\n\non the pavement, birds teach us\n\ntheir songs, the Earth calms itself\n\nand we wait and shuffle\n\nin masked queues our skin warm,\n\nnothing\n\nelse to do but wait and look around.\n\nFaded Rainbows\n\nby Francis Charters\n\nWe thought it would be over before the month of May,\n\nThey said it was a type of flu, and would soon go away,\n\nBut now it really looks as if the crown of colds could stay,\n\nFaded rainbows.\n\nIt was the Chinese Cholera, from a burger made of bat,\n\nThen Italy and Spain got it, what did we think of that?\n\nWhen super-spreaders brought it here, we were really in the crap.\n\nFaded rainbows.\n\nAnd lockdown cost us billions, cash we could ill afford,\n\nBut furlough gave us income, and time of getting bored,\n\nA life quite low and leisurely became our just reward,\n\nFaded rainbows.\n\nBut Malvern is a pretty place to lockdown with a friend,\n\nMy kids bring life and laughter and a family to defend\n\nAnd Claire has kept her promise to love me to the end\n\nof faded rainbows.\n\nPlaguelock\n\nby Juhi Joshi\n\nThe sudden invasion of pathogens\n\nleft humanity in dungeons.\n\nAs we sit and witness the ordeal\n\nheaps of corpses are left

head!\n\nLondon Lockdown\n\nby Angela Wigglesworth\n\nOn 26th March the government finally took stock,\n\nAs lock down was announced, at 8 o clock,\n\nStay at home and isolate was their simple request,\n\nAnd listen to guidelines as they know what’s best,\n\nWe listen to the guidelines and fear for the months ahead,\n\nAnd get angry with those idiots who still go out instead,\n\nNow there are no pubs or bars left open, schools and gyms are closed,\n\nNot just in the uk, but all around the globe\n\nOur routines have all been changed, we work from home with regular naps,\n\nAnd Friday nights are spent indoors, on video calling apps,\n\nGirls dye their hair themselves, and boys shave theirs heads,\n\nWe’re running out of ventilators, and hospital beds,\n\nBut the NHS staff continue and their work is so admired,\n\nWorking long shifts, saving lives, even those who once retired\n\nOur minor day to day problems, no longer seem to matter, no one cares about their weight, or if their getting fatter\n\nWith death tolls rising everywhere – the uk, the us and China,\n\nThe least of your concerns, is waxing your vagina\n\nHow long will this lockdown last – we still have no idea,\n\nAccording to the news, it will be a while until the we’re clear\n\nNow is the time, for communities to come together,\n\nAnd pray this will all be over, in time for summer weather\n\nSo take shopping to elderly neighbours, but leave it at the gate,\n\nReminisce about the good times With your missed best mate,\n\nWe should get out while we still can, enjoy our daily walk,\n\nCall family often, with no reason, just to talk,\n\nAlthough these times are really tough, we must stay positive and excited,\n\nAs in the not too distant future, we’ll all be reunited.\n\nEverything\n\nby Paul Kidd Hewitt\n\nhttps://www.poetry-festival.co.uk/wp/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/everything-PKH.mp3\n\nIn the middle of this infinite black sea,\n\nAmongst millions of blazing stars,\n\nHanging delicately by a golden thread,\n\nYou and I are here,\n\nAnd that is everything.\n\nHaiku -The New Normal\n\nby Kamla Murti\n\nHaiku : 1\n\nThe New Normal\n\nThe dolphins swim,\n\nWhile rhino gallops down the lane\n\nIs this new normal?\n\nHaiku :2\n\nThe New Normal\n\nPeacocks strut in streets\n\nWhile I rejoice in peace\n\nIs this new normal?\n\nLockdown\n\nby Paul Ryan\n\nLockdown ended – but not for Me\n\nGonna have to have another cup of Tea\n\nStuck inside for at least another Month\n\nWatching Black Lives Matter\n\nAnd Statues that refuse to Move\n\nWhat a World we have Become\n\nPlease show Kindness to Everyone !\n\nFirst of April Twenty-Twenty\n\nby Jennifer Ridout\n\nFirst of April Twenty-Twenty\n\nIt’s April fool’s day today,\n\nBut nothing to laugh about.\n\nMore people will die from this virus.\n\nOf that I have no doubt.\n\nGoogle haven’t set up any\n\nJoke news articles this year.\n\nThey assumed we wouldn’t like them,\n\nBut they’d have brought some cheer.\n\nI didn’t see any on the telly,\n\nOr hear any on the radio.\n\nJust lots of talk of Covid-19.\n\nOur current invisible foe.\n\nGowns\n\nby Jennifer Ridout\n\nI’m trying to make sure,\n\nMy dressing gown doesn’t become\n\nMy ‘depressing gown.’\n\nI’m unlikely to wear\n\nA ballgown for a while.\n\nAll events are currently cancelled.\n\nI have little chance\n\nOf fitting back into\n\nMy wedding gown ten years on.\n\nI’ll do my best during this,\n\nNot to end up ill\n\nAnd wearing a hospital gown.\n\nTen Things to be Thankful For\n\nby Jennifer Ridout\n\nMy family are all safe and well.\n\nI am able to speak to them.\n\nI can enjoy more time with Owen.\n\nThe weather is warming up.\n\nThere are spring flowers to look at.\n\nMy mental health is good now.\n\nI know I can get through this.\n\nI have a good job to go back to.\n\nWe are fanatically stable.\n\nWildlife is recovering without us.\n\nYesterday I Spent\n\nby Jennifer Ridout\n\nYesterday I spent three hours,\n\nOn Facebook and shopping sites.\n\n(Trying to avoid the bad news)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent over £400,\n\nOn stuff I didn’t really need.\n\n(Most I’ll send back for refunds)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I also spent my money,\n\nOn presents for upcoming birthdays.\n\n(I’m sorted for up to October now)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent five hours,\n\nIdly watching telly.\n\n(Mainly CBeebies and This Morning)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent an hour,\n\nWalking in spring sunshine.\n\n(We spotted some new flowers)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent another,\n\nWeeding the vegetable patch.\n\n(Ready to plant seeds Dad gave us)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent twenty pounds\n\nOn books for homeschooling Owen.\n\n(Trying to keep us motivated)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent no time,\n\nWith family I don’t live with.\n\n(I didn’t even phone any of them)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent only moments,\n\nActually awake on my own.\n\n(Today I’ll get some me time for poetry)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent too much time,\n\nWorrying about the Corona virus.\n\n(It’s hard not to when it’s so bad)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent a while,\n\nSearching for moisturiser.\n\n(My hands are so dry from washing)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent too long\n\nBiting my nails and cuticles.\n\n(We’re to avoid touching our face)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent the night\n\nIn the spare room’s single bed.\n\n(I went to bed later than Phil)\n\n.\n\nYesterday I spent ages\n\nTrying to get to sleep.\n\n(Feeling bad that I’d wasted time)\n\nGood Friday\n\nby Jennifer Ridout\n\nThe sun was shining today.\n\nIt was warm in the garden,\n\nAnd on our walk along the river.\n\nWe set up ramps for Owen,\n\nTo drive his monster truck over.\n\nWe enjoyed a roast pork lunch.\n\nOwen discovered that he\n\nAbsolutely loves crackling,\n\nBut found the road parsnips,\n\nWe too ‘sugary’ for him.\n\nIt wasn’t the day we had planned,\n\nWith circus at the theatre\n\nAnd a big family get together,\n\nBut it was definitely a good Friday.\n\nSocially Distant\n\nby Jennifer Ridout\n\nWhen I was feeling really low,\n\nThis was the normal state of being.\n\nStaying at home with just Owen.\n\nI’ve been better at keeping in touch,\n\nIn the past fortnight than usual.\n\nI’m just glad we have the hand,\n\nThe technology to do so.\n\nIf this happened twenty years ago,\n\nLife would have been so different.\n\nNo video calls or online shopping.\n\nJust dial-up internet and a land line.\n\nMy son doesn’t really understand,\n\nAll that is going on in the world.\n\nI’ve kept news off round him.\n\nHe knows that we are trying to avoid,\n\nA nasty virus that is going around.\n\nHe’s missing his school friends.\n\nI’m sure they miss him too.\n\nAxel Scheffler has done illustrations,\n\nOf Julia Donaldson’s characters,\n\nComplying with the distancing rules.\n\nSupermarkets have put down marks\n\nOn the floor, so people stay apart\n\nFrom one another and stay safe.\n\nThere are often queues to get

and run away\n\nWith your precious minutes\n\nAnd theirs\n\nFear will conflict with reason\n\nAnd silence your sense of self\n\nEven though they are the cargo\n\nOf the very same vessel\n\nI tell myself these truths\n\nAnd yet sometimes I cannot control\n\nThe ringing in my ears\n\nOr the pounding of my heart\n\nI am told I can be trained\n\nI can learn to control\n\nI can ride above the wave\n\nFamiliarity is my friend\n\nBut will familiarity overcome fear?\n\nWill it not, suppress it for another time?\n\nUntil silence marks the return\n\nOf my old foe\n\nHow do I stop?\n\nHow do I change?\n\nFor I am afraid of life, and death\n\nAnd the role I am to play\n\nIn their power struggle\n\nIt’s My Cage – OK\n\nby Ian Rabjohns\n\nGet up, get going\n\nSpiders not in lockdown,\n\nDishes stacked, no Isolation there.\n\nThere’s weeds a growin’\n\nfaster than the veg’\n\nCake box down to just a tiny wedge.\n\nBut it can all go hang.\n\nI make the rules in My Cage.\n\nThe when’s and where’s and what’s\n\nof how things happen here.\n\nThis is my small world\n\nTucked away behind the hedge.\n\nTen to one no one will come today\n\nto take note of how I am.\n\nI’ll not be sending up red smoke.\n\nDon’t dread the internet gone dead.\n\nCan’t even do some work in my shed-\n\nwaiting for the swallows there to fledge.\n\nIt all hangs one thing on another\n\nlife’s demands, not government’ s commands.\n\nIf freedom came tomorrow, would I know?\n\nWould the sun glow differently somehow?\n\nMy isolation day would go on as before–\n\nBut maybe noise would creep in from the edge.\n\nThis Dance\n\nby Dagmar Seeland\n\nWe are still getting used\n\nto the rhythm of this new tune,\n\nthe steps we take to keep\n\nsix feet apart, as marked out\n\non pavements and shop floors,\n\nthose footprints, black on yellow,\n\nstage directions for we extras\n\nin this worldwide drama.\n\nWe shimmy past each other\n\nin supermarket aisles, line up\n\nfor cashiers behind perspex shields\n\ntwist to avoid the shop staff.\n\nRecently we waltzed through life\n\nnot caring where we trod.\n\nNow, moving to a different beat,\n\nWe struggle to find our feet\n\nflailing in this limbo.\n\nPerfect Storm\n\nby Ilse Pedler\n\nThe storm is a doctor in a teacup\n\nrain lashes down in sugar cubes,\n\nshe tries to hold back the milk wind\n\nwith a face mask made of snorkels,\n\nsees clownfish in her peripheral vision.\n\nAt the end of her shift she constructs\n\na ladder from discarded lemon wedges\n\nclimbs through a window to her bathroom\n\nshowers in waves of gratitude,\n\nhopes it is enough.\n\nThe New Normal\n\nby Kelly Hunter\n\nWe hang out of windows on Thursdays,\n\nbanging pans to show our support\n\nto a nation of nurses we had previously\n\nneglected.\n\nChildren learn not to hug.\n\nInstead they wave their small hands\n\nas we sidestep each other on pavements –\n\nlike dodging mines,\n\ntiny, human bombs.\n\nThe devil makes work for idle thumbs,\n\nso we find try to solace in small pleasures:\n\nrainbows, the postal service\n\nthe weekly saucepan lids\n\nAnd as the new normal carves its routine,\n\nand the nightly

days\n\nRainbows and sunny rays\n\nSo keep the rules up and play your part\n\nJump up and down it’s good for your heart\n\nWe known it’s cruel to stick to the rule\n\nBut you don’t want to be a

everything big and small\n\noh but just think of all the family time\n\ncracking up jokes and laughing all the same\n\nkaraokeing through the night\n\ndreaming of going back to school and seeing friends\n\noutside clapping for the NHS and all the key workers\n\nwalking through the countryside with family\n\nnever stopping and going the extra mile to help other people\n\nShielding\n\nby

and all of his cronies,\n\nand don’t let your mind fill with fear.\n\nJust think of the days when we’ll sit and gaze\n\nwhile sharing a bottle of beer.\n\nFun\n\nby Thomas Byford\n\nFun on the playground, fun everywhere,\n\nBalls being thrown in the air.\n\nSnacks being crunched anywhere,\n\nFun on the playground, fun everywhere.\n\nFriends chatting about their day,\n\nScreaming and shouting as people run away.\n\nChildren celebrating as they score a goal,\n\nFun on the playground, fun everywhere.\n\nBirds singing sweet songs in the raggedy trees,\n\nKids swinging on the tree trunk and skipping on the tyres,\n\nFun on the playground, fun everywhere.\n\nFreshly cut grass I can smell in the air,\n\nThe sound of footsteps anywhere,\n\nFun on the playground, fun everywhere.\n\nHome Privilege\n\nby Bryony Lewis\n\nIs it ok to be ok?\n\nDon’t say it too loudly, you’ll look callous\n\nDon’t extol the virtues of solitude, you’ll sound insensitive\n\nNo one cares how many blue tits visited your feeder today\n\nNo one needs your sourdough starter, you cold brew coffee,\n\nYour organic, home grown self satisfaction\n\nBecause we are all in this together\n\nUntil we are not\n\nSaving Grace\n\nby Margaret Healy\n\nToday I have been brave or stupid, I’ll let you decide\n\nTwelve weeks was just too long for me to stay locked up inside\n\nIt’s been so hard and something snapped, I’d had about enough\n\nLockdown life, for me at least, had proved to be too tough\n\nNormally outgoing, I am quite a cheery soul\n\nBut loneliness and solitude has taken such a toll\n\nAt eighty-four, I am at risk and vulnerable to the virus\n\nI understand the Government has a duty to advise us\n\nHowever, and I say this, knowing some folks won’t agree\n\nOther people don’t know what it feels like being me\n\nAnd so today, undaunted, I took myself outside\n\nWalking in the sun felt good, it cannot be denied\n\nI sat down on a bench just to take in nature’s glory\n\nA child nearby was listening as her mother read a story\n\nShe looked at me and asked if I would like to listen too?”\n\nI was already, but said “Thanks, I don’t mind if I do”\n\n“Me and mum come every day, she helps me with my reading”\n\nHuman contact, kindness too, that’s just what I was needing\n\nHer mother finished reading and reminded me again\n\nSee you here tomorrow then, around about half- ten\n\nI walked home feeling lighter with a smile upon my face\n\nA mother and her child might prove to be my saving grace\n\nSomething to look forward to and friendships made anew\n\nWith a little help, I think I’ll see this lockdown through\n\nLockdown Doggerel\n\nby David Winbow\n\nSmile at us, pass us, pay us\n\nas little as you can pay.\n\nYou skim off the best, we manage on less,\n\nbut it’s we who will save the day.\n\nSmile at us, pass us, avoid us-\n\nwe only stack the shelves,\n\nnurse the sick, empty the bins,\n\nwhile others save themselves.\n\nSmile at us, pass us, ignore us,\n\nbut remember what we did-\n\nwe kept the country on its feet,\n\nwhile others ran, and hid.\n\nSmile at the graves as you pass them,\n\nbut remember how we died-\n\nunprotected, doing our best,\n\nwhile others ran, to hide.\n\nSmile at us, pass us, despise us,\n\nbut what we say is true-\n\nwe were the backbone of Britain,\n\nwe deserved better than you.\n\nLove Amidst The Pandemic\n\nby Medina Valzado\n\nAs I was sitting, looking to the clearing,\n\nAs the first day of lockdown begin,\n\nThe sky is calm and inviting,\n\nIn the night I heard the ambulance crying…\n\nUnder the moonlight I can see\n\nthe empty streets where I used to be,\n\nI wish this deadly thing will end,\n\nso hugs and kisses will send…\n\nThe singing of the birds can be heard in the air,\n\nLike lullabies in my lonely ears,\n\nIt was the second day of lockdown as I can remember,\n\nWhen our crazy love happen…\n\nWe can hear the saddest melodies,\n\nas the pandemic cases rise,\n\nBut you comfort me with your sweet little flying kisses,\n\nAnd those red petal roses,\n\nLying in the dark corner of my room,\n\nWith these days of loom,\n\nMy love for you blooms and blooms,\n\nNo one can stop nor this doom…\n\nThis moment of langour is like a solitude,\n\nBut I found it felicitous instead of being bored,\n\nAs we exchange dulcet messages,\n\nIn the middle of this predicament…\n\nA moonlight tryst — to sneak for a call,\n\nIn lonely days of quarantine, the ebullience of happy lovers,\n\n—a silhouette of happiness,\n\nI found tranquillity amidst of this chaos,\n\nAs you promise me a love to eternity,\n\nfar beyond moon and back,\n\nto no limit plus more…\n\nA Clue On What To Do\n\nby Ilham Nagi\n\nIf only I were sent a clue,\n\nSomething like a sign on what to do:\n\nThat would help my daily life\n\nWhich at the moment is far from paradise,\n\nWe’re stuck at home away from friends,\n\nMaybe it’s time to make amends,\n\nEither look for your long lost hobby,\n\nOr jump around your back garden like a little froggy.\n\nLook around and be inventive,\n\nKeep active and be attentive,\n\nAll you have to think and say,\n\nIs you know what there’s plenty for me to do in a day!\n\nGo wild build your own creation\n\nWho knows you could even plan a future vacation.\n\nYour not the only one hoping for corona to go away;\n\nLet us pray that it will someday.\n\nWas this your sign your lucky clue?\n\nJust look around there’s plenty to do,\n\nYou just gotta to be the best of YOU.\n\nGranny’s little ones\n\nby Jacqui Anderson\n\nIn a fields near our house are buttercups and daisies\n\nWhere the moths and the butterflies dance with the fairies\n\nGrasshoppers and crickets sing out their song\n\nThe nights shine bright and the days are long\n\nOne day very soon the little ones will say Can we go round to the field and play\n\nWhere we’ll laugh with the fairy’s and play in the grass with our granny and Grandad at long long last\n\nUnder the microscope\n\nby Jacqueline Pemberton\n\nOn first sight it could have been\n\nan undiscovered planet,\n\nan exotic flower or a sea anemone,\n\nWe might have puzzled at its origin,\n\nBeen bewildered by its purpose.\n\nWhat might have been soft rose buds\n\nto scatter on a lover’s bed\n\nare lethal blooms; stamens spiked\n\nwith lipid poison to pierce our defences\n\nwhen we are at our weakest.\n\nThis blurred orb mutates on our screens\n\nfrom science lab to prime time T.V,\n\nExcreting globules like molten rock,\n\nMultiplying even as we hold our breath\n\nand close our eyes.\n\nIt is the wallpaper in our rooms,\n\nCurtains our mornings and our evenings,\n\nEmbeds itself into the woodwork,\n\nTucks into every frightened corner\n\nand steals the cushions of our dreams.\n\nLatching onto the lining of our lungs\n\nIt tears straight to the heart of us,\n\nHijacking cells in a forced and fatal coupling,\n\nA brutal consummation: a pitiless gestation.\n\nAn Arrangement With An Orangutan\n\nby Jayne Livesay\n\nGo mad, Orangutan\n\nSwing from the lampshade\n\nSwing from the washing line\n\nBut don’t forget our arrangement, Orangutan\n\nDon’t forget what

meant for posting\n\nGobble them whole, silver paper, the lot\n\nNo one can give us a roasting\n\nThe weather is too hot to stay in\n\nBut we’ve been told we must halt\n\nUntil unleased into the world again\n\nA world we once wanted to bolt\n\nOur arrangement, Orangutan\n\nDon’t forget our sign\n\nFor its time to bring out the cheese and crackers\n\nFor its time to crack open the wine\n\nThen we’ll

music\n\nGrinning from ear to ear\n\nForgetting normal life\n\nThere’ll be more reminiscence\n\nAs we’ll all have stories to tell\n\nScreens will no longer interest us\n\nSince we’re obsessed and uptight with it\n\nJewels will be seen as vanity\n\nAnd survival, a priority\n\nEven atheist will thank God\n\nWith genuine gratitude\n\nMedics will be remembered\n\nFor leading in the battlefield\n\nWhen soldiers were weak\n\nIndeed, they’re the unsung heroes of the front line\n\nLoneliness will become a normality\n\nAnd we’ll learn to embrace the slightest freedom\n\nCherry

the hospital wards are full with plenty\n\nWhen this is over, there will be spaces at the table\n\nFrom the elders, the ailing and the not so able\n\nMeanwhile the sun rises in the east and sets in the west\n\nThe tide still rolls in and out, Mother Earth knows best\n\nThe lambs are being born and seeds still sprout\n\nDespite this, we, man, woman and child, can’t go out!\n\nThe plants and flowers continue to bloom\n\nEven with the warnings, of doom and gloom\n\nThe air in the cities is getting cleaner by the day\n\nIs the hole in the ozone layer going away?\n\nMankind has came through this in times of the past\n\nWe will come through this, but some things won’t last\n\nAir travel, foreign holidays, may become a distant memory\n\nSomething that we did, when we were free\n\nWe must always live with faith and hope\n\nAnd keep washing our hands for twenty seconds with soap\n\nTake care of yourself, your spirit, body and mind\n\nAnd in the midst of it all, remember to be kind.\n\nThe unknown enemy:–\n\nby Datta Chanda\n\nThe unknown enemy of all,\n\nIs he big or is he small?\n\nSome say he is round and spikiest of them all,\n\nI also hear he is the deadliest of them all.\n\nHe is here, he is there,\n\nTravelling time to time in the air.\n\nYoung, old or small,\n\nHe doesn’t care at all.\n\nHe has made the roads clear,\n\nFor now, he is our greatest fear.\n\nThe birds are free,\n\nChirping on the wonderful tree.\n\nThe whales are swimming, the deer, galloping,\n\nWondering where the humans are who tried to destroy us all.\n\nBut I do believe our faith in god,\n\nWho is the mightiest of all,\n\nWill help us conquer this fear once in for all,\n\nI hope a wonderful better tomorrow is near for us all.\n\nOpen Skies\n\nby Alwyn Marriage\n\nSo huge, so

A field\n\nmarched by the battered stumps of maize,\n\nlit by hills, broad as the moon.\n\nThe cracks in April clay will yield\n\nrich oyster shells to feed poor days;\n\npipes; pigs’ skulls; best, we find soon,\n\nsmashed pottery. And most is blue,\n\nslipped from quick hands, a child’s, a maid’s,\n\nto flags. Were harsh words spoken?\n\nI brush a latticed rim while you\n\nscoop one white scrap whose two blue birds,\n\nsmudged lovers, soar unbroken.\n\nIn Victorian England, oysters were a cheap food.\n\nThe ‘Willow pattern’ on china depicts the story of two lovers, one rich, one poor. After death, the lovers are\n\nre-united as birds.\n\nDisabled\n\nby Hannah Hodgson\n\nIn Italy, our bodies were found decaying in care home beds.\n\nIn China, we died of starvation.\n\nIn America, our faces were obscured by a sacrifice the weak sign.\n\nIn England, we’re being murdered to save the economy.\n\nSupermarkets are rationing, NHS volunteers are being called up,\n\nhome sewn scrubs are replacing state sanctioned ones.\n\nFrailty scores mean I won’t get a ventilator.\n\nThe Government has forced me to become\n\none in a generation of victims.\n\nJust One Day\n\nby Kelly Nealon

said a sound\n\nYour ask how you’re doing\n\nYou answer you’re ok\n\nBut they know that’s not the case\n\nYour answers different today\n\nYour team know you better\n\nThan you ever thought they did\n\nThey care about you genuinely\n\nLike a mother with her kid\n\nThey offer you their friendship\n\nTheir support\n\nTheir Advice\n\nThey wrap their arms around you\n\nIt feels calm warm and nice\n\nThey ask you how you’re feeling\n\nYou can’t answer you don’t know\n\nYou need to take a minute wait a second take a mo\n\nIt’s hard for every one of us\n\nWe are all in this together\n\nA storm that each one of us\n\nSimply has to weather\n\nOne day this will all be over\n\nThis will all be done\n\nWe can all return to normal\n\nAnd have a little fun\n\nI’m thankful for the people\n\nShare your joy, your sadness your pain\n\nAnd give you reassurance it’ll be ok again!!.\n\nNot Visiting My Aunt\n\nby Heather Cook\n\nSo often have I sat\n\nwatching you kiss pot plants with your fingers\n\non long, slow, glowing afternoons.\n\nWe’d sit, knees almost touching,\n\ncups of tea forgotten,\n\nthe indoor peace enhanced by voices\n\nshrieking down the cobbled way.\n\nAnd now I cannot visit.\n\nAt first I railed against the rules,\n\nbut there have been some precious things –\n\nwords that might have never formed\n\nbetween the cooking and the washing up;\n\nshared words that found their place in letters, cards,\n\nand now shine quietly in my life.\n\nGardening in Lockdown\n\nby James Ryan\n\nEverybody is gardening in lockdown,\n\nSeems to be the only show in

these times\n\nby Brian Mostoller\n\nOnce again the world\n\nhas knotted us up\n\nand we jolt against the yoke\n\nto drag existence onward.\n\nThe fear of death always the whip.\n\nBefore this, we moved\n\nfast enough and busied enough\n\nto keep death from mind.\n\nWe buckled in with smartphones and\n\nearbuds and engines and airspeed.\n\nWe buckled in with the biggest,\n\nthe fastest, and the scariest roller coaster ever.\n\nBut now we have slowed, and he walks\n\nwith us, hand upon the yoke.\n\nYesterday, the Coronavirus forced a pent-up daughter and me\n\non a rare walk to the small college near our home.\n\nBlinded classrooms, peeling playbills, distant birds\n\nwe passed in silence . . . .\n\nBlinded and hitched\n\nwe are now forced to focus.\n\nOnce again we are\n\nre-minded of our role.\n\nWe have planted this field\n\nwith viruses, with investments, with violence, with love.\n\nNow we reap.\n\nSeed is always a part of the grain.\n\nAnd he has once again provided.\n\nFrom Pasteur, from Crashes,\n\nfrom Blood, from Eden\n\nwe are together again\n\nunder the sun’s slow rise\n\npulling a world\n\nfilled with\n\nhummingbirds perched on fountains\n\nwalks with daughters\n\nand lessons from a deserted college campus.\n\nLast Time\n\nby Clive Grewcock\n\nThis time\n\nI am on the outside of nature\n\nLooking out at the inside of the open wilderness,\n\nWatching nature sigh a breath and spread its wings.\n\nDoing what it should, with freedom at its own peace.\n\nNature will remember\n\nThis time\n\nWhen the pecking order has been shuffled\n\nAnd correctly re-aligned.\n\nWaiting on the inside for\n\nA time\n\nWhen I am ready to re-emerge, with\n\nNature looking out at me from its open wilderness.\n\nAm I like a specimen peering from behind glass?\n\nSometimes\n\nIt surrounds on a curious breeze or on the forceful\n\nWings of a weighty moth, dancing around my light,\n\nAnd is allowed to return inside to the whisper of the landscape\n\nSeeing more than me, as I am\n\nLooking at my reflection, waiting to be invited inside.\n\nValuing time.\n\nHave we used up our luck,\n\nHad our last chance with the cards we were dealt, blown it for this\n\nLifetime?\n\nIt is wild inside, in there. In the open wilderness.\n\nNature is a survivor and we might be forgiven\n\nTo venture back inside one\n\nLast time.\n\nStrange Times\n\nby Jennie Turnbull\n\nWhen the streets are silent\n\nbut the houses are full,\n\nand the shops are shuttered\n\nbut the delivery drivers busy,\n\nwhen we queue quietly outside\n\nsupermarket and chemist;\n\nwhen the children are home\n\nbut it is no holiday,\n\nand the kitchen is classroom,\n\nand the garden is gym,\n\nwhen screen time is so much more\n\nthan idle distraction;\n\nwhen the traffic is quieter\n\nand the songbirds rejoice,\n\nthe air is clearer\n\nand the sky is blue,\n\nand we’re grateful for window-box\n\ngarden and yard;\n\nwhen there is time to sit\n\nbecause there is nowhere to go,\n\nand there is time to play\n\nbecause we’re all at home,\n\nand we fight and we shout,\n\nand we laugh and we moan;\n\nwhen we sleep over lunchtime\n\nand lie awake at 4am,\n\nwhen we cry over kittens\n\nbut listen stunned to the news\n\nand we’re thankful to be safe\n\nlearning what essentials are;\n\nwhen we leave a parcel at your door\n\nand walk swiftly away,\n\nwhen we wave to you through glass\n\nthen call you later on the phone,\n\nwhen words of love must stand\n\nin place of the hug we’d rather share\n\nwe are novices navigating\n\nthis strange new land\n\nwhere distance is kindness\n\nand kindness is all.\n\nI’m Fat (my trouble with Lockdown)\n\nby Andy Walker\n\nThese scales aren’t right – they say I’m fat\n\nIt must be all those biscuits I’ve had\n\nMy clothes don’t fit – it’s so very sad\n\nAnd I can’t climb the stairs without feeling bad\n\nI’ve had enough, I must lose weight\n\nI can’t go on in this awful state\n\nDiets are no good, they really don’t work\n\nI’ll go without treats – although it’ll hurt\n\nSo out go biscuits and chocolate bars too\n\nI’ll eat more fruit and exercise I’ll do\n\nBut hold on – that seems too drastic\n\nMaybe my trousers just need more elastic\n\nNo, I really must get a grip and be strong\n\nI know being this fat is terribly wrong\n\nRight, where do I start – oh yes – some salad\n\nBut that meat pie would taste better on my palette\n\nOh, it’s all too much for my poor old head\n\nI need to go and lay down on my bed\n\nYes, that will help to sooth my headache\n\nBut first …. just another tiny slice of cake\n\nUntil we meet again\n\nby Andy Walker\n\nKeep well and strong each day my friend\n\nUntil we meet again\n\nYou’re in my prayers each day my friend\n\nUntil we meet again\n\nFor health and peace each day my friend\n\nUntil we meet again\n\nSuperheroes don’t need a cape\n\nby Ayaan Singhal( 9 year)\n\nNot flying in the sky,\n\nNot jumping from the high,\n\nNot a name or a sign,\n\nSaving lives, yours and mine.\n\nWorking day and night,\n\nTo make everything alright,\n\nWithout a sleep or a rest,\n\nAlways doing their best.\n\nClose encounters they have had,\n\nFighting a battle with the bad,\n\nDoctors, Nurses and everyone else,\n\nNot worrying about themselves.\n\nSaving lots of lives,\n\nWithout an armour or a drape,\n\nYES!

going to back down\n\nGovernment’s going to pay my tent\n\nBefore they start the crackdown.\n\nSo………….\n\nDon’t gimme no Wackaboob\n\nDon’t gimme no MotherSmother\n\nIf we all isolate\n\nCan we still love each other?\n\nWe are the Mother’s mothers\n\nOur choice to Wackaboob,\n\nIt’s time to isolate,\n\nSo we don’t lose one another.\n\nSisters on furlough\n\nAbout time our truth was spoke\n\nDo we want to go back to\n\nthe madness and the smoke\n\nOf pollution choking all our kids\n\nWorking 3 gigs to survive\n\nAnd you want to call that woke?\n\nSoldiers on the corner\n\nDoing county lines\n\nSell your sister for a ten bag\n\nBut the Feds don’t want to know\n\nThey’ve got the ‘rona boner\n\nWanna check if your buying wrongbow\n\nOr sunbathing in the park\n\nGotta be a loner,\n\nWe’re all just flying solo\n\nSo….\n\nWe are the Mother’s mothers\n\nJust have to Wackaboob,\n\nCorona’s here to stay\n\nSo one way or another\n\ngive up our dreams and say\n\nWe will

dissolve into hissy fits,\n\nOr lectures on snowflake millennials,\n\nYour snide and tested perennials,\n\n‘End the lockdown now,\n\nLong live the new normal’ is your siren cry,\n\nbut another, better

consume us,\n\nthe original sin that leads to the fall,\n\nIs that the legacy of the boomers?\n\nSo forget the status quo,\n\ntoo late now for reconciling,\n\nSit down uncle, you’re blocking my flow.\n\nRainbows in windows\n\nKelvin Smith\n\nAnxiety soared in my two-up two-down\n\nHanging around in my dressing gown,\n\nI searched for a smile but found only a frown\n\nThe street was so quiet, just like a ghost town.\n\nI sensed that depression was sinking in\n\nMy heart was thumping, my head in a spin,\n\nI looked in the mirror, i couldn’t even grin\n\nI hadn’t been eating, my face was so thin.\n\nI needed to talk but there was no one around\n\nSo erie and weary, during lockdown\n\nMy thoughts were deep and very profound\n\nI was too scared to get the bus into town.\n\nThen i saw a Rainbow with colours so bright\n\nThat a child had crayoned in a window of light\n\nFor the Nightingales fighting this horrendous plight\n\nIt made me believe it would all be alright.\n\nRainbows in windows made all my pain fly\n\nAnd lifted the spirits of all passers by\n\nRainbows in Windows express battle cry\n\nAnd call to the Heavens way up in the sky.\n\nLockdown Life\n\nby Sue Bicknell\n\nPinheads of burning sparks illuminate life and death.\n\nSpots of light squint through shuttered windows.\n\nFirefly stars peep in a blue black sky.\n\nPinholes of space windows to a world outside the range of knowing.\n\nLives lived beyond themselves.\n\nDeaths belonging to distant places.\n\nPintucks gathering memories beneath\n\nfolds of dreams that congregate\n\nin hidden creases of a life story untold,\n\nlived in solitary confinement.\n\nPinpricks of time prompt humanity to be\n\nmindful of past transgressions.\n\nAnticipate what may be to come,\n\nigniting a spark in the eye of the universe\n\nto brighten the future.\n\nThe Corona Virus Spring\n\nby Ron Carey\n\nThe Crab-apple Tree outside my room\n\nIs in full bloom\n\nGlorious branches reaching out towards the brilliant blue sky\n\nwhile the Sun stands by\n\nBritain is in spring\n\nIn the forest, a new woodsman, strides\n\nInvisible, no need to hide\n\nMajestic or of humble means\n\nHe does not distinguish in between\n\nYoung or old, he will cut them down\n\nYou cannot see him, but you may meet\n\nWhen a friend you happily greet\n\nWhile out walking\n\nOr at a bus stop talking\n\nYou will not feel the cut he’s making\n\nUntil one morning with your waking\n\nYou will feel his tickle in your throat,\n\nThen a dry cough you will note\n\nYour temperature goes higher and higher\n\nNow your body feels on fire\n\nHis hands grasp your lungs so tight\n\nFor each breath, you have to fight\n\nSo, in the forest do not roam\n\nStay safe, stay well, Stay at home\n\nPandemic Poem of Lockdown Life\n\nby Chelsea Duke\n\nFirst we’re told no handshakes, no kisses and no hugs.\n\nNext to go, amongst much else, was reusable coffee mugs.\n\nIt seems the nation runs on pasta, tinned toms, small bags of flour.\n\nPanic buyers stockpiling, shelves barer by the hour.\n\nWorse than that was yet to come, with toilet paper bagging.\n\n“My God, what’s next?” I hear you cry – yep, that’s right, no shagging!\n\nThey closed the shops, they closed the pubs, denied the Brits their beer.\n\nThen u-turned on the breweries. It could only happen here!\n\nThe schools were shut, the kids at home, twixt life and work no line."
