Kellner, nominee No. 09 on the 2024 Proxy Ballot, for the Board of Directors (“Board”).\n\nThis is not a solicitation of authority to vote your proxy. Please DO NOT send us your proxy card; National Legal and Policy Center is not able to vote your proxies, nor does this communication contemplate such an event. NLPC urges shareholders to vote against Mr. Kellner following the instructions provided on management's proxy mailing.\n\nThe following information should not be construed as investment advice.\n\nPhoto credits follow at the end of the report.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNational Legal and Policy Center (“NLPC”) urges shareholders to vote AGAINST Lawrence “Larry” W. Kellner on the 2024 proxy ballot for Exxon Mobil Corporation (“ExxonMobil” or the “Company”).\n\n1\n\nBut the most recent, most relevant, and most significant experience that Mr. Kellner brings – that was expected to be of greatest value to ExxonMobil and its shareholders – was his prominent role since 2011 as a director for The Boeing Company (“Boeing”), the last four-plus years of which were as Chairman.5\n\nDespite what were undoubtedly viewed by ExxonMobil directors as attractive qualifications in Mr. Kellner, his recent history as top director for Boeing highlights why he is unqualified and inappropriate to continue to serve on ExxonMobil’s board. Simply, Mr. Kellner’s entire tenure with Boeing, both as a board member and as Chairman, has been an unmitigated disaster. The aviation and defense contractor has flailed for well over a decade, and in the eyes of some observers, much longer.\n\nBoeing: Careless About Safety on Mr. Kellner’s Watch\n\nBoeing has undergone longtime scrutiny over its safety practices and record, but a recent series of high-profile aviation incidents have projected negative attention on the plane manufacturer.\n\nIn the most prominent case of late, on January 5, 2024, Alaska Airlines flight 1282 – a Boeing 737 MAX 9 – made an emergency landing after a door opening plug panel blew off the aircraft midair. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding and inspection of over one\n\n1 “Boeing Board Elects Former Continental CEO Kellner as New Director,” The Boeing Company, Oct. 4, 2011.

Boeing gave $100 million to the families victimized by the crashes. The U.S. Justice Department charged the company with fraud conspiracy, and Boeing agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in a settlement.12 The 737 Max was not cleared to fly again by the FAA until November 2020. Other nations gradually allowed the jet to return to service as well.\n\n·In December 2023 Boeing warned airlines to inspect the rudder control systems of their 737 Max jets for loose bolts in what should have been an advance warning for the Alaska Airlines incident.

The suit also alleges that an employee was asked to obscure quality problems — and was retaliated against when he raised a red flag about defects.” (NPR timeline report)\n\n·“The FAA announced that it would increase oversight of Boeing’s production and manufacturing, including via an audit of the 737-9 MAX production line.” (Axios)\n\n·“Boeing announced that some 50 undelivered 737 MAX jets would be reworked after misdrilled holes were identified on some fuselages.” (Axios)\n\n·“A self-described Boeing employee says the aircraft company, not Spirit Aerosystems, was the last to install the door plug on the 737 Max 9. ‘The reason the door blew off is stated in black and white in Boeing’s own records,’ the person writes on an aviation website. ‘It is also very, very stupid and speaks volumes about the quality culture at certain portions of the business.’” (NPR)\n\n·“Some customers say they’re reluctant to fly on the aircraft, their confidence shaken.... As potential passengers look for ways to know what plane they’ll likely be on, airlines and booking sites offer ways for customers to change planes, including omitting the Max 9 from flight search results.” (NPR)\n\n·“The FAA gave Boeing 90 days to create a plan to address its ‘systemic quality-control issues.’ The company said it was ‘totally committed to meeting this challenge’ and would develop the plan.” (Axios)\n\n·“The NTSB launched an investigation into a February United Airlines Boeing 737-8 flight in which the aircraft experienced ‘stuck’ rudder pedals after landing.” (Axios)\n\n·“Several other Boeing aircraft flown by United Airlines experience[d] issues, including flames spewing from an engine and a lost tire after takeoff.” (Axios)\n\n·“United Airlines confirmed in mid-March that a missing panel was discovered on one of its Boeing 737-800 planes after it landed.” (Axios)\n\n·“In early March the NTSB said it [hadn’t] received documents from Boeing crucial to its investigation into the door plug blowout — despite the documents being “requested numerous times.” (Axios)\n\n·“NTSB revealed that Boeing overwrote security camera footage of repair work done on the door plug of the Alaska Airlines plane that experienced the blowout.” (Axios)\n\n·“John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower, is found dead in Charleston, S.C., where he once worked at Boeing’s large 787 plant. Police are investigating after finding Barnett dead in a vehicle. The coroner’s office says he died\n\n4\n\n‘from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.’ Barnett was locked in a yearslong legal battle with Boeing. In a whistleblower complaint filed in early 2017, he accused his former employer of retaliating against him for raising safety concerns in the company’s commercial airplanes.” (NPR)\n\n·“The FAA’s audit of Boeing's 737 Max production line unveiled numerous issues with the company’s production process, including ‘manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.’” (Axios)\n\n·Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said there are “real concerns with quality control at Boeing.” (Axios)\n\n·“The FBI notified passengers of the Alaska Airlines flight that they…may have been victims of a crime.” (Axios)\n\nAnd yet another whistleblower “died suddenly” on April 30. Joshua Dean, a former quality auditor at Spirit Aerosystems, passed away after suffering a “sudden, fast-spreading infection.” According to the Seattle Times, “Dean had given a deposition in a Spirit shareholder lawsuit and also filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration alleging ‘serious and gross misconduct by senior quality management of the 737 production line’ at Spirit.”13 The company had fired him a year ago.\n\n13 Gates, Dominic & Rosenblatt, Lauren. “Whistleblower Josh Dean of Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems has died,” Seattle Times, May 1, 2024.

The Company is no longer providing financial guidance. According to Mr. Calhoun, “while we often use this time of year to share or update our financial and operational objectives, now is not the time for that.”19 Meanwhile, Airbus has extended its competitive lead over Boeing, and many have questioned whether the Company can still measure up to its European counterpart.20\n\nThe complete grounding of the 737 MAX family of jets in 2019 following two fatal crashes involving the MAX 8 caused significant damage to Boeing’s reputation and financial performance. 21 The Company was still in the early stages of rehabbing its image when the Alaska Airlines failure occurred.\n\nThe door blowout reinforced the reputation that Boeing is still incautious, and its quality has diminished even further. Shareholders are justifiably concerned (its stock price has plummeted 29 percent since Jan. 1, 2024), as the fallout among Boeing’s customers has started to roll in:\n\n·United Airlines announced that its first quarter earnings took an approximate $200-million hit due to the temporary grounding of the 737 Max 9,22 and asked its pilots to take unpaid time off due to delayed aircraft deliveries from Boeing.23\n\n·Southwest Airlines pulled out of servicing four airports and cut costs elsewhere, in part attributable to delayed deliveries of Boeing aircraft.24\n\n18 Terlep, Sharon. “Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun to Step Down in Wake of 737 MAX Struggles,” Wall Street Journal, March 25, 2024.

Called “thermal runaway events,” the widebodies were grounded while a fix was pursued.33 The incidents cost several airline customers millions of dollars due to reduced flights34 – sound familiar?\n\nKellner and Boeing were in hot pursuit of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credibility more than 10 years ago when the manufacturer came up with the Dreamliner. The 787, 10 years in development, was (prematurely) brought to market and sold as a “super-efficient” jet with “exceptional environmental performance.”35 Except the passion seemed not for protecting the planet, but instead for gaining access to massive amounts of subsidies for “green” technologies by state and federal governments.\n\nFailure Upon Failure for Mr. Kellner\n\nMost damning, Mr. Kellner was supposed be part of a leadership course correction that remedied the failures of Mr. Calhoun’s predecessor, Dennis Muilenburg, who was fired in 2019 after being “accused of leading a culture that put production deadlines and profits ahead of safety.”36 An authority on governance for ValueEdge Advisors, Nell Minow, told Fortune that “the [Boeing] board is a ‘serial offender’ that it ‘doesn’t learn from past mistakes…It’s a bad board, and it has been a bad board for a long time.’”\n\nOther experts cited in the article questioned whether Mr. Kellner and Mr. Calhoun, who was the board’s lead independent director during Mr. Muilenburg’s CEO tenure, were the answer to Boeing’s problems. Top proxy advisor Glass Lewis opposed Mr. Kellner’s election at annual meetings in 2020 and 2021, citing his role leading the audit committee during the 737 MAX 8 crashes. Vanguard voted against him in 2020, citing the committee’s “control failures.”\n\nAerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of Aerodynamic Advisory, a longtime observer of Boeing, noticed that late last year Mr. Calhoun dissolved the company’s strategy department, and wondered if the destruction of the business is intentional: “You know, it’s nothing short of horrifying. But it also sort of illustrates one of the strange aspects of this, the so-called crisis, which is that the problem is purely at the top. There are a lot of really good people at Boeing and\n\n32 “VIDEO: Green Technology Hobbling Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner?,” National Legal and Policy Center, January 24, 2013.

You just have some people who are really, really bad at their job at the top.”37\n\nMeanwhile the financial hits keep coming. In 2021, the board settled a shareholder lawsuit brought over the safety failures, agreeing to pay a settlement of $237.5 million.38 CNN reported in early May 2024 that “Boeing has lost $32 billion since 2019, with no end in sight.”39 It’s noteworthy that Mr. Kellner’s elevation to chairman of Boeing’s board occurred in 2019 – and the company’s share price has been roughly halved since that time.40\n\nNot all of Boeing’s maladies are safety-related either. Some are attributable to just bad business decisions. The company so far has lost more than $2 billion on its contract with the U.S. government to retrofit two 747s for Air Force One,41 and has suffered more than $7 billion in cost overruns for the Air Force’s KC-46 refueling tanker contract.42\n\nOther evidence indicates the priorities are in all the wrong places, unsurprisingly. An anonymous Boeing insider pointed to “elite dysfunction, financial abstraction, and a DEI (Diversity, Equity and Inclusion) bureaucracy that has poisoned the culture.”43 More:\n\nThe headquarters in Arlington (Va.) is empty. Nobody lives there. It is an empty executive suite. The CEO lives in New Hampshire. The CFO lives in Connecticut. The head of HR lives in Orlando. We just instituted a policy that everyone has to come into work five days a week—except the executive council, which can use the private jets to travel to meetings. And that is the story: it is a company that is under caretakers. It is not under owners. And it is not under people who love airplanes.\n\nIn this business, the workforce knows if you love the thing you are building or if it’s just another set of assets to you.\n\nA week after that insider’s revelation, the Wall Street Journal reported that “an internal Boeing review found that Chief Executive David Calhoun and other top executives took personal trips\n\n37 Rene, Stacey; Alloway, Tracy; and Weisenthal, Joe. “Richard Aboulafia on Troubles at Boeing: ‘I’ve Never Seen Anything Like It’,” Bloomberg, Feb. 22, 2024.

One way we’re doing so is through our annual Global Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (GEDI) Report.”\n\nConclusion\n\nThat’s pretty ironic given that Boeing just wiped out its strategy department!\n\nPerhaps the most absurd claim regarding ExxonMobil’s intentions for employing Mr. Kellner’s “abilities” relate to his service on the board’s “Environment, Safety and Public Policy,” and “Nominating and Governance” committees. The overwhelming evidence presented above demonstrates that Mr. Kellner should be kept as far away as possible from these committees, and indeed, entirely off the ExxonMobil board.\n\nFor these reasons, we urge shareholders to vote AGAINST Lawrence W. “Larry” Kellner,” nominee No. 09, for the Board of Directors on Exxon Mobil Corporation’s 2024 Proxy Statement and voting card.\n\n44 Tangel, Andrew & Maremont, Mark. “Boeing Reveals Executives Got an Extra $500,000 in Private-Jet Perks,” Wall Street Journal, April 11, 2024.
