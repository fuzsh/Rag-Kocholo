        "text": "On June 25, 2003, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) revoked Enron's market-based rate authority—effectively its license to trade wholesale energy—ruling that the company's Oregon-based West Power division had manipulated neighboring California's wholesale electricity markets via various “gaming” practices.Footnote 1 As a consequence, Enron was found to have severely disrupted energy markets through the western states, contributing to a prolonged shortage of electricity supply that would ultimately become known as the California energy crisis. Five years previously, California had dramatically reconfigured its energy supply industry, splitting up the large monopoly utilities and creating markets for electricity to be traded between various participants. The move was the first of its kind within the United States, following widespread liberalization of other regulated industries like natural gas, and the system initially performed well following its inception in 1998. However, by the spring of 2000, supply problems began to appear, leading to sharp rises in the cost of wholesale electricity.Footnote 2 These problems would escalate dramatically over the following year, resulting in rolling blackouts across the state, multiple regulatory interventions, and ruinously high energy prices for both the state's citizens and its utility companies.\n\nWhile similar practices were found elsewhere, Enron's manipulation of California's markets was particularly extreme.Footnote 3 Specifically, Enron's traders used their knowledge of the newly designed markets to artificially increase or decrease wholesale prices in their favor, which often involved submitting false supply-and-demand information, withholding available electricity, or scheduling energy they did not have. They also made use of flaws in the market's new computerized scheduling system, for instance, deliberately overloading parts of the grid to then receive payments for relieving it. Additionally, the FERC found that Enron had entered into undisclosed partnerships with numerous market participants, which allowed it to control energy scheduling and physical infrastructure. Not only did these actions exacerbate the state's high energy prices and supply issues, but they directly violated Enron's market-based rate authority and also contravened numerous rules set out in the protocols designed to govern the new system.Footnote 4 Perhaps most significantly, they led to the criminal guilty pleas of three of West Power's most senior traders: Timothy Belden, John Forney, and Jeffery Richter, who were convicted of intention to commit wire fraud. Belden's plea agreement acknowledged that “as a result of these false schedules, we were able to manipulate prices in certain markets, arbitrage price differences between the markets, obtain ‘congestion management’ payments in excess of what we would have received with accurate schedules, and receive prices for electricity above price caps.”Footnote 5\n\nIn this article, we engage with the organizational corruption literature as a specific theoretical basis for better understanding Enron's practices and involvement in the California energy crisis.Footnote 6 Corruption represents a misuse of one's position for personal or collective gain, and within a corporate context such behaviors tend to manifest as illicit transactions (e.g., bribery), agreements (e.g., price-fixing), deception (e.g., misleading investors), or manipulative practices (e.g., market abuse).Footnote 7 While the underlying social and economic causes of corruption have been extensively theorized, in-depth empirical investigations are less common, in part because of the challenges surrounding its observation. Accordingly, we have a fairly good idea about what makes organizations commit corrupt acts (often as a persistent and routine organizational practice), but we know relatively little about how corruption is conceived, managed, and coordinated over time. By extension, the role that outside organizations play is particularly unclear.Footnote 8 Clearly, acts like bribery or price-fixing involve external parties, but it is also conceivable that other forms of corruption extend beyond the context of a single organization. Given these gaps, as well as the regular calls for more empirical elaboration of the phenomena surrounding corruption, we provide a historical account of Enron's manipulation that is analytically structured around the elaboration of corruption as an organizational phenomenon.Footnote 9\n\nAs a concept, corruption is distinct from criminality or illegality, which depend on factors such as geographically specific laws, an appetite to prosecute or litigate, and a particular judicial interpretation. While corruption often involves the breaking of laws, it can also extend beyond the technically illegal to include wrongful activities that are judged to transgress broader social norms.Footnote 10 This is an important historical consideration, with legal proceedings subject to social, financial, and political conditions, as well as the evidence available at the time. Moreover, convictions for occupational crimes are comparatively rare, even when such behaviors were clearly widespread, because those behaviors often occupy an ambiguous space between ethically questionable and actively illegal.Footnote 11 Nonetheless, it has been widely recognized that Enron's actions in California deviated from acceptable social norms, both as a matter of ethical standard and as a point of law.Footnote 12 Thus, ours is an established case of wrongdoing, which offers an entry point from which to explore how organizational corruption was enacted over time within an organizational division and through its relationship to other market participants.\n\nOur analysis of these activities offers several contributions, the first of which is to add historical insight into Enron's history. Because Enron is notorious for the extraordinary accountancy scandal that emerged in late 2001, its involvement in the 2000–2001 energy crisis has been somewhat overshadowed. Thus, focus has fallen primarily on its Houston-based executives and the firm's wider political and cultural significance. For instance, Malcolm Salter shows how its leadership created conditions that embedded self-interested behaviors and compromised the judgments of those faced with ethically uncertain decisions.Footnote 13 Similarly, Gavin Benke uses Enron as a lens through which to explore broader trends of neoliberalism and globalization, underscoring that “two separate debacles in 2000 and 2001—the California energy crisis and the revelation of accounting fraud—transformed the company into a symbol for all the ills of the deregulation.”Footnote 14\n\nThe history we present also contributes to the literature on organizational corruption, constituting a historically informed theoretical narrative with both historical veracity and conceptual rigor (what Mairi Maclean, Charles Harvey, and Stewart Clegg call “dual integrity”).Footnote 15 Empirically, we add insight into the workings of a corrupt organization and how corrupt practices evolve over time, something a historical approach is uniquely placed to provide. In particular, we show the extent to which normalized corruption can be embedded within interorganizational processes and the adaptation of these practices in the face of increased public and organizational scrutiny. Conceptually, we develop the particular nature of Enron's corruption, which, while orchestrated by Enron as the primary actor, nevertheless was facilitated by a network of partner firms around Enron and could not have taken place without the active involvement of these network partners.Footnote 16 We label this “network-enabled corruption,” a type of corruption in which a dominant organization (in this case, Enron) coordinates with a network of partner organizations to achieve illicit ends. This accounts for situations where corruption is primarily organized and enacted by a single organization but sustained by other organizations that are a removed, but nonetheless vital, component. Interorganizational corruption in this form is less likely to be seen horizontally among collusive competitors and, as in our case, can exist within ostensibly legitimate market relations of service provider and client.Footnote 17 Similarly, it differs from other notions of networked corruption, which revolve around illicit transactional activities like bribery or rent-seeking, generally between private and public actors.Footnote 18 Thus, our narrative presents a materially different way of looking at corruption as an interorganizational phenomenon."
