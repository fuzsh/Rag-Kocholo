        "text": "“ If the devil can be redeemed, then anyone can. „ — Lucifer\n\nin \"Partners 'Til the End\"\n\nLucifer Morningstar, formerly known as Samael as well as his nickname, the Light-Bringer, is the titular protagonist of Lucifer. He is an Archangel and the younger identical twin brother of Michael. Following a failed rebellion against his Father, Lucifer was banished from Heaven and forced to oversee the torture of damned Human souls for eons as the Ruler of Hell. During his time as the King of Hell, Lucifer tempted Eve in the Garden of Eden, leading to Eve and her husband Adam being banished to live on Earth for the rest of their lives. After some visits to Earth, He would reunite with his old friend, Lilith in 1946 to help her find her ring. Lucifer was ultimately gifted the ring, along with Lilith's Immortality. Widely known as the Devil or Satan by Humans, Lucifer is blamed for the sins of mankind.\n\nOn one of Lucifer visits to Earth in 2011, he assisted Amenadiel in finding his necklace and eventually decided to abdicate his throne to become a nightclub owner in Los Angeles, operating an establishment called Lux. He forced his eldest brother to oblige due to the deal he made with him to help find his necklace and had his closest friend and senior lieutenant, Mazikeen join him, owing John Constantine a favor for helping her leave Hell during their search for the necklace. After having Maze cut his wings off, he repaid that favor during the Anti-Monitor Crisis before the Multiverse was destroyed and later reborn, allowing the former King of Hell to continue his carefree life.\n\nLucifer's life took a turn after he witnessed the murder of his friend Delilah. Feeling compelled to find the killer, he attached himself to Detective Chloe Decker, and ultimately solved the case with her. He manipulated his way into becoming a consultant for the LAPD, which gave him an outlet to punish evil doers on Earth instead of Hell. Lucifer also started seeking therapy from Linda Martin, temporarily becoming a lover. His relationship with the Detective becomes more intimate, after shockingly realizing that he becomes vulnerable in her pressence. He gets into conflict with Amenadiel, who seeks to bring him back to Hell, only for the brothers to team up to stop the corrupt cop, Malcolm Graham, after the latter resurrected him in a misguided attempt to do God's will. In an effort to protect Chloe, Lucifer was mortally wounded by Malcolm and before dying, makes a deal with God to protect Chloe in exchange for being a loyal son. Briefly returning to Hell, he is shown that his Mother escaped Her cell. His death is then reversed by God and after sending Malcolm back to Hell, he interprets what he saw as his part of the deal: return Goddess to Hell.\n\nAfter a long search for Goddess, they finally reunite, only for him to instead condemn Her to live among the Humans She despised as a loophole to punish Her so they could reconnect. Her presence eventually brought the attention of Uriel, forcing Lucifer to eradicate him with the Blade of Death to save Goddess and Chloe. Needing actual assistance from Linda because of this, he reveals his true self to her, causing her to distance herself from him, before eventually resuming their sessions. Lucifer and Chloe almost started a relationship before he discovered that God put her in his path for unknown reasons, causing him to break off any affection he has for her to protect her. When he learned his Mother's plan to return to Heaven to face God, he agreed to help reassemble the Flaming Sword, but his intention was to return Her home and have his parents fight it out as vengeance for their manipulations. However, realizing that their actions would culminate in a civil war, resulting in numerous of his siblings dead, he went against Goddess, and instead used the sword to cut through space itself, giving his Mother the opportunity to form Her own universe. This selfless act resulted in Lucifer unknowingly self-actualizing his wings back.\n\nWith his wings returned and his Devil face gone, Lucifer believed that a master criminal known as The Sinnerman was behind it all and set out to punish him. He also started a friendship with Charlotte Richards after her experience in Hell left her broken. After a long chase and misdirection, Lucifer learned that the LAPD's new lieutenant was not only the Sinnerman, but the world's first murderer, Cain, but had nothing to do with his latest conundrum. This led Lucifer to think that God did it all to foil Cain's plans, so Lucifer set out to help get rid of his mark so he could finally die before deciding to dissolve it when it put Chloe in jeopardy. He soon grew jealous when Cain and Chloe started dating, and later became engaged, so decided to tell her how he felt, but backed out when the latter called it off. After Cain murdered Charlotte and Amenadiel regained his wings, Lucifer realized that all the changes to his body were his doing, believing he deserved what he got. Once Lucifer finally killed Cain, his Devil face returned, as he believed he was a monster once again for breaking God's number one rule of not killing Humans. just as Chloe witnessed it.\n\nLucifer's relationship with Chloe took a turn after she initially betrayed him to send him back to Hell with the help of Father William Kinley. Though Chloe realized she was wrong, Lucifer couldn't bring himself to forgive her, and things only got worse when Eve showed up and the two resumed their former relationship. Lucifer and Chloe eventually reconciled and he returned to consulting for the LAPD. Unfortunately, because of Eve's influence, Lucifer started inflicting serious punishment on the guilty, before he realized what he was becoming and broke up with her to prevent a world ending prophecy. However, the prophecy came true when Demons started invading L.A., forcing Lucifer to return to Hell to keep them in line. Before leaving, Lucifer and Chloe admitted their feelings for each other and he resumed his rule over Hell.\n\nTwo months later (which, in Hell's time, were actually millennia), Lucifer was forced to return when Michael started wreaking havoc on Earth. His relationship with Chloe took another turn after she learned of her divine birth, and his own confidence was shattered when he discovered Michael manipulated him since the beginning. Lucifer and Chloe, however, were able to see past their issues and finally became a couple. However, Lucifer's mojo passed on to her, and he became invulnerable again whilst in the presence of his girlfriend, causing conflict in their new relationship. After Chloe was kidnapped by his twin and subsequently rescued, Lucifer was forced to finally confront his true feelings for her but was halted when Michael and Maze attacked him and Amenadiel. Their sibling squabble was broken up, however, when God showed up. After spending some quality time with God, Lucifer learned that He was going to retire, leading to a war between him and Michael over who would take His place, the former becoming determined to win after Michael caused Dan Espinoza's death. Though it seemed Michael was victorious after killing Chloe, Lucifer sacrificed himself to resurrect her from Heaven, finally admitting his love for her. Lucifer's selfless action resulted in his own resurrection as the new God with all present taking a knee before him.\n\nAfter weeks of procrastination, feeling that he is not the right person for the job, Lucifer abandoned his decision to become God. He is surprised when his future daughter, Aurora Morningstar, confronts him from her Timeline for answers on why he abandoned her and Chloe. Despite not being able to figure out why, Lucifer proved that he loved Rory and would never leave her intentionally, leading to their reconciliation. After helping Dan to deal with his guilt and ascend into Heaven as well as dissuading Aurora from killing Vincent Le Mec, Lucifer returns to Hell to help heal the damned souls of Hell so that they too could be redeemed. Decades later, after dying of old age, Chloe is reunited with Lucifer in Hell, willingly joining him as his eternal partner in Lucifer's mission.\n\nBiography\n\nHistory\n\nCreation\n\nSamael was one of the many Angels born to God and Goddess after the Big Bang, billions of years ago[1], but is special as not only is he an Archangel,[2] but also because of his status as \"The Lightbringer,\"[3] becoming the \"brightest of all God's Angels.\"[4] He was also the younger twin of Mi-ka-el,[5] but due to Samael's stature, the brothers grew to despise each other, his elder twin changing his name to Michael, not wanting it to rhyme with Samael's.[6]\n\nGrowing Up In Heaven\n\nAs an young Angel, he and his siblings admired, respected, and even feared their eldest brother, Amenadiel. He played and trained with his siblings, however, he and the other elder Angels often excluded Uriel from their activities.[7] Due to this, Uriel would pull pranks on Samael.[8] He was very close to his younger sister Azrael, nicknaming her Rae-Rae, and enjoyed pranking Amenadiel with her.[9] He was, however, jealous of his brother Hanjobadiel being considered the \"handsomest of them all.\"[10]\n\nBecoming The Devil\n\nSamael's Heavenly Rebellion\n\nSamael coveted free will, like humanity, and chose to rebel against God, who he viewed as controlling.[1] He told God directly that he was going to start a rebellion, but his Father just found it adorable.[11] Samael, changing his name to Lucifer in defiance of their Father, led his vast rebellion; Angels like Saraqael assisted him.[12]\n\nBanished to Hell\n\nHis rebellion ended in failure and he was cast down to Hell by God, banished from ever returning to Heaven or else be incinerated upon his return.[13] He was tasked to be its sovereign and to punish the souls of deceased sinners for all eternity.[14] When he landed in Hell, he discovered he had a monstrous face when he looked into a mirror and believed it was God punishing him for his rebellion.[15] Lucifer's reign would not be in solitude, as when his old friend Lilith gave birth to her children: thousands of Demons, she sent them to Hell to serve Lucifer as his army. One of them, Mazikeen, became Lucifer's best friend, bodyguard, and loyal soldier,[14] who he trusted enough to tell her about his twin Michael.[5] As a result, Lucifer owed Lilith a favor.[16]\n\nLucifer reluctantly ruled Hell for millennia, gaining an incredibly fearsome and terrifying reputation as the personification of evil, conceived in many cultures and religious traditions. He became known by many names and titles, including the Devil, Satan, Beelzebub, Old Scratch,[4] Abaddon, Belial, Prince of Darkness,[3] the Dark Lord, the Prince of Lies, and the Lord of Temptation. Though despising many of them, Lucifer actually liked Old Scratch.[4] He, however, came to despise his birthname, reminding him of his fall from grace.[3] His relationship with Azrael soured, as he felt like she abandoned him, never bothering to visit him while in Hell.[9]\n\nTempting Eve\n\nSometime after his fall, Lucifer met the first Humans, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. There, he introduced them to the knowledge between good and evil by eating the fruit from the Tree of Life.[1] While having a fling with Eve, Lucifer asked the first woman the one question no-one else bothered to ask her; if being Adam's wife was what she truly desired. His interest in what she wanted resulted in a close friendship with Eve. These acts, however, angered God enough to banish Adam and Eve from Eden and send them to Earth to live out there days.[17]\n\nWhen they had two sons, Cain and Abel, and the latter was murdered by his brother, he was sent to Hell and became it's first tenant.[18] After that, Lucifer became aware of Cain becoming the \"World's First Murderer\" and how he was cursed by his Father to walk Earth for a \"tortured eternity.\"[19] When Humanity grew in numbers, Lucifer commanded the Demons to stop possessing the bodies of deceased damned souls[20], not wanting them to cause havoc on Earth, killing Humans before their time. The punishment for disobeying him was incineration.[21]\n\nGiving his Mom the Cold Shoulder\n\nHundred years later, Goddess became a prisoner of Hell when she began causing plagues and floods.[22] After she was locked in Her cell, Lucifer never bothered to visit his Mother, giving Her the same cold shoulder that She gave him when God banished him.[1]\n\nVisits to Earth\n\nSocializing with Humanity\n\nThroughout the centuries, Lucifer would occasionally visit Earth, only for Amenadiel to always come to take Lucifer back to Hell.[23] In 1583 BC before the common era, Lucifer was responsible for the burning bush Moses encountered.[24] Lucifer befriended King Tutankhamen of Egypt before his death in 1323 BC and engaged in a \"human train\" orgy with Caligula numbering 37 people.[16] He spent time with Atilla the Hun, developing a fondness for Hungarian rum balls.[25]\n\nBetween 1599-1601, he gave constructive criticism to William Shakespeare while he was writing Hamlet, and was gifted a signed copy of one of his books as a thanks.[26] He reunited with Lilith in 1793 where the two attended Marie Antoinette's \"coming out party\" that led to her beheading.[16] Even though Lucifer \"de-pantsed\" Napoleon with Jophiel[12], he received a horse statue from the dictator.[27] He attended Sigmund Freud's bris in 1856[28] and became close friends with him[16], being gifted his personal journal before he died.[21] In 1892, he met writer Oscar Wilde and became a lover to the \"interesting bachelor.\" He gave him a quote about the stars that Oscar used in his hit play Lady Windermere's Fan. He came to regret giving him the quote, growing annoyed by all the people quoting it back to him.[29] Sometime before Grigori Rasputin's death, Lucifer started a \"private club for magicians\" with him that angered the Romanovs.[30]\n\nWhen a certain masochist went to Hell, Lucifer took part in his torture. He tortured him in every way he requested; burning, freezing, or simply hurting. However, after centuries, the soul mysteriously missed his daily punishment. However, when he returned from one of his trips to Earth for their next session of torture, the King of Hell was surprised to see the soul crying, begging he never forget him again, promising to be good. It was in that moment Lucifer realized this individual was so full of self-loathing and voided of self-respect that whatever attention he paid him gave meaning to his \"pointless existence,\" regardless of the manners of torture he inflicted on him.[31]\n\nHe avoided Franz Kafka's Hell Loop due to it being the most depressing.[16] Either before or during World War II, he visited Nazi Germany and mingled with them.[25] He reserved burning crotches for them and pedophiles,[24] and eventually developed a dislike of listening to Adolf Hitler's screams.[27] At some point after the war, Lucifer acquired a 22-bedroom castle in Austria that \"hardly got bombed\" during the conflict and met private investigator Jack Monroe after his tour at the Battle of the Bulge.[16]\n\nLucifer hated the rumor that associated him with goats, never figuring out how it started,[32] as he doesn't \"even like their cheese.\" He grew to despise Satanists, who worshipped how he is perceived as in The Bible; embodiment of evil.[33]\n\nRepaying His Debt\n\nReuniting with an Old Friend\n\nBy the year 1946, having not seen Lilith for 253 years, Lucifer was summoned by his old friend to New York City to get a drink at the club she worked at as a singer, the Garden Club. While traveling to Earth, Lucifer didn't arrive at the Garden Club exactly so was given a ride to the Big City. Once they arrived a block away from the club, he stepped out of the car, making a few flirtatious looks at women before skipping on to the street to his destination.\n\nMaking his way inside, he took a drink from a passing waitress and stopped at the club's bar. He didn't have to wait long for Lilith to take the stage and start singing I Want to Be Evil. When she references The Devil in the song, Lucifer chuckles and says to a patron that she was talking about him. He then enjoyed the rest of the show. After she finished, he raised a glass to her performance when she winked at him, then gulped it down.\n\nLucifer then moved towards her as she left the stage before he was halted by Paddy and Vincenzo of the clubs employees questioning what his intentions were with Tommy Stompanato's girlfriend. Lilith soon arrived to stop the potential conflict that would end with the men being beaten by Lucifer. He snickered at her implication about being the victor of the fight and two old friends left for her dressing room to talk in private.\n\nPouring them drinks while she changed, Lucifer recounted the last time they saw each other was at Marie Antoinette's beheading, commenting on what a shame it was that she was executed. He then questioned what Lilith had been up to in the last few hundred years, only to be saddened to hear that the ring that she took from the Garden of Eden before she was banished by his Father was recently stolen.\n\nLucifer opted to cheer her up, such as seeing Ernie Hemingway while he was in town. However, Lilith's change of attire confused him, believing they couldn't go out with her low cut backless black dressing gown. She instead deemed they were going to get the \"only thing in the entire Universe that means anything\" to her back, but he questioned why he would involve himself. Calling in her favor of sending her children to him, he agreed, calling the idea of The Devil solving crime ridiculous.[16]\n\nWorking with Jack Monroe\n\nNeeding professional help in finding Lilith's ring, Lucifer thought Jack Monroe was the best person to aide him. He let himself in to his P.I.'s office, where Jack greeted him asking what he wanted. He informed him of the missing ring, showing him the image of it on Lilith's ring from one of her posters. When Jack seemed disinterested in helping, Lucifer dropped a stack of cash to motivate him, which worked.\n\nHe took Jack back to the Garden Club to begin their search. He assured Jack that he could handle himself when the private investigator told him to let him deal with any trouble that came their way, but relented when he brought up his time in WWII. He then asked what \"ne'er-do-well\" they should interview first. Jack nodes to the bartender, Gertie, and the duo questioned her knowledge on the ring's location.\n\nThe bartender gave them information on a man dubbed \"Lucky Larry\" snooping around Lilith's dressing room when her ring disappeared. When she gave them his description ending with an eyepatch, Lucifer became annoyed that she didn't lead with that detail. Lucifer and Jack scour the bar for Larry, only for the latter to spot a mustache man that he believed was a \"rat just dying to squeal.\" Lucifer was ordered to stay at the bar while he talked with him, so he had himself a drink Gertie poured him.\n\nWith Benny only being willing to talk out back, Lucifer and Jack rendezvoused with the snitch outside, only to see no sign of him. Lucifer figured he \"turned tail and ran,\" but as Jack predicted, the man showed up behind them. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a setup and the two were ambushed by Paddy and Vincenzo, the latter sucker punching Jack. Lucifer asked the injured Jack if he still wanted him to stay out of the fight, feeling it was \"unsporting\" for him to do nothing.\n\nHe, however, changed his mind when Jack started fighting back. Before Lucifer could assist, the sound of whistling behind the men halted the fight. Coming out of the shadows was Tommy Stompanato, who threatened them with their lives if they kept asking questions in his club. He then turned his gaze towards Lucifer, deeming him lucky to be friends with \"Lily Rose,\" but demanded he not get \"too friendly\" with her. This just made Lucifer chuckle at his threat.\n\nReturning to Jack's P.I.'s office, Lucifer and Jack sat on the latter's coach where he was scorned for not helping Jack when he was punched. He defended his actions as obliging to his promise to not interfere with any fights. Taking a sip of alcohol straight from the bottle, he asked what their next move was. With the plan to check out Lucky Larry's usual hiding places in the morning, Lucifer decided to take this opportunity to \"trip the light fantastic\" with New York's \"best and brightest.\"[16]\n\nInvestigating Lucky Larry's Murder\n\nLucifer's night on the town was interrupted, unfortunately, when Lucky Larry dropped dead with a knife in his back at Jack's house. He arrived at the scene, with the NYPD already securing it. He began flirting with Jack's wife, Shirley Monroe in the dining room while her husband was on the phone with his informant. He offered to have some fun, but she remained faithful to her husband and politely declined.\n\nThey were joined by Jack, who warned Lucifer to stay away from his wife. He, however, figured Jack wouldn't mind since he noticed the man hadn't spoken to his wife since he arrived. Changing the topic to Larry's murder, Lucifer was informed that he got into a fight with a bratwurst heir dubbed \"Willy the Sausage Prince\" at the docks yesterday; Lucifer made a crack at the man's nickname. H then took note of the tension between Jack and Shirley when the man decided to stay at his office for the night before they went to question Willy.\n\nOn the way to the Sausage Prince's mansion, Lucifer asked what his wife did to get his \"trousers in such a twist,\" only to discover that she was a call girl his army friends hired to go on a date with him. Lucifer believed Jack was a lucky man to benefit from the experience that Shirley had gained from the men she was with before him. Jack, however, didn't see the appeal, so Lucifer questioned why he didn't just leave her if it bothered him so much.\n\nJack gave his explanation as still being in love with her, but voiced his doubts in his future with her due to their relationship starting off with a lie. Lucifer wasn't paying attention, finding his situation \"extraordinarily boring.\" He gave his advice to just forget about it, comparing problems to the likes of Bible salesmen and genital warts, but Jack just laughed at Lucifer's absurd advice.\n\nThe two finally arrived at the mansion where they interrupted William in the middle of having a self portrait of himself in a suit of armor done. Being offered mini sausages and tea by William's maid, Carmina, the duo sat down on his coach. Noting Segmund having a \"field day\" with the Sausage Prince, Lucifer demanded the location of Lilith's ring before searching the mansion himself when William claimed not to know what he was talking about.\n\nWhile Jack questioned the details of Willy's fight with Lucky Larry, Lucifer scoured the living room for the ring, but stopped to tell Willy that Larry stole his friend's ring and ended up murdered when he questioned why his fight with him was so important. He then resumed his search for the ring, even searching in a knight's armor's private section while Willy gave Jack the details of his relationship with Larry.\n\nSeeing the ring wasn't in the living room, Lucifer rejoined Jack as Willy told them how upset he was that Larry had them meet out on the docks, believing he stepped in feces. William's dimwitted attitude made Lucifer believe that he didn't have the brains to steal Lilith's ring; Jack agreed with Lucifer's assessment. After being given the location of Larry's apartment, Lucifer took one last look at Willy, believing there was a word to describe him but couldn't figure it out. He then left with Jack.\n\nLucifer and Jack entered Larry's apartment, Lucifer disgusted by the esthetic of the place, deeming it worse then Kafka's Hell Loop. While searching the apartment was a bust, Lucifer and Jack did \"role play\" of Larry's murder, Lucifer being the murderer. They were able to deduce that the killer stabbed Larry in the back while he tried to flee out the window, which created the blood splatter on it. Lucifer then discovered the tip of a Romeo y Julieta cigar that pointed them to Tommy Stompanato.[16]\n\nReaching a Dead End\n\nThey arrived at Stompanato's mansion where Lucifer questioned if Tommy murdered Larry and stole the ring back to impress Lilith, why hadn't he given her it back. The duo peered around a statue to see blood dripping from the staircase railing forming a buddle. They reached the railing to find Vincenzo murdered. Lucifer and Jack made it to Tommy's room to find him lying in his bed, heart ripped out and a Anubis mask covering his face.\n\nLucifer removed the mask to find a Eye of Horus painted over his left eye. While Lucifer looked for Tommy's missing heart on the floor, Jack discovered an identical knife to the one that killed Lucky Larry. Lucifer then discovered the ring case, only to be disappointed to find it empty. When asked what the symbol on his face was, Lucifer confirmed it as the hieroglyphic for the Eye of Horus. This gave Jack the idea to visit the Sacred Eye Book Store.\n\nEntering the book store, they looked around before being startled by one of the employees. Fooling the employee that they were there to attend the secret cult ceremony, Lucifer and Jack dressed in spare robes and entered a room full of knockoff sacred objects. They were again startled by the owner of the book store, Melvin the Magnificent, annoying Lucifer. He then requested a Ceremony of Anubis, which Melvin obliged.\n\nHe asked them to look to their right, and while they did, the backdrop of the Tree of Life changed into one portraying the pyramids with the Eye of Horus symbol on it; Lucifer was baffled at how the magician pulled that off. As he listed off what came with the package, Lucifer commented it never ending well for the chicken in sacrificial ceremonies. When he then offered the \"economy package\" that had a chicken heart pre-sacrificed. Lucifer didn't find it quite accurate, but figured Tutankhamen would've loved it.\n\nWhen Melvin started talking about death being power, Lucifer and Jack believed they found Tommy's murderer, so Lucifer used his Desire Exhibition on him to glean what he most wanted. He was, however, confused to hear it be a 1941 Pontiac Torpedo. Having enough of Melvin's games, Lucifer accused him of killing Tommy and stealing Lilith's \"very special ring.\" Melvin, unfortunately had an alibi of being here during Stompanato's murder window.\n\nJack then asked if he told any of his customers about the legend of Lilith's ring. Melvin confirmed to selling maps to Lilith's tomb for years but couldn't give them a name due to them all wearing robes that covered their faces. With this leading them to a dead end, Lucifer referred to their time with Melvin the Magnificent as a \"clucking waste of time.\"[16]\n\nLuring Out the Thief\n\nLucifer relayed the bad news to Lilith at her dressing room and tried to offer other ways to repay his debt now that there seemed to be no way to find the thief. Lilith still wasn't willing to give up on the ring as it reminded her of who she was and why she did the things that she did. Lucifer asked if that included sending her children to Hell, which only made her furious that Lucifer didn't appreciate the army she gave him; he shouted that he never asked for said army.\n\nHowever, after lowering his voice, he called them the one he never knew he needed as without them he would've spent his eternity in Hell alone. He told Lilith that he would forever be in her debt for giving him the only company he had in Hell and apologized that he couldn't get her ring back to repay his debt. With them both getting a drink, Lucifer sat on Lilith's coach and inquired how Humanity got it in there heads that it was her ring that gave her Immortality.\n\nShe took a seat opposite to him and revealed that after ditching the \"wet blanket\" Hernán Cortés in the Americas, she found herself in the company of Moctezuma before she was thrown into a volcano by his priests and when she survived, it was written on a stone tablet. This made Lucifer laugh at the mortals ways to explain the Celestial world. He then got the idea that since the ring wouldn't work, the thief would look for a way to make it work, coming up with a plan to fulfill his debt.\n\nHe had a \"high priest-cum-magic school freshman\" that he knew spread the word that Lilith's ring would only work if its attached to a \"gaudy bangle\" he had a jeweler make. He placed the bracelet on Lilith's right arm and briefed her on the plan: while she's on stage, Shirley will take the bangle to her dressing room's safe, where the thief will sneak in, only for Jack to be watching the entire time. He was confidant that by the end of the night the \"little piece of Eden\" will be returned to her.\n\nWhile waiting for the show to start, Lucifer was asked by Lilith if he'd ever connected with a Human during his many trips to Earth. Lucifer assumed she was referring to sex and started to brag about his orgy with Caligula, but she cut him off and clarified she was talking about an emotional connection. Disgusted by the notion, Lucifer believed it would take a miracle for him to want that and figured it would never happen as his Father wasn't \"handing those out\" anymore.\n\nAs part of the plan, Lucifer would accompany Lilith in a duet as a distraction for Jack to scope the crowd for the person who left to follow Shirely. After she handed the bangle to Shirley to place in her safe, he played the piano while Lilith started singing Someone to Watch Over Me. When she sat beside him, the two then started singing the remainder of the song together.\n\nAfter the performance, Lucifer and Lilith arrived in the dressing room, only to find Jack aiming his gun at Willy, who had the bangle. Lucifer was taken aback by this development, as he believed he didn't have it in him to kill Stompanato. They were then joined by Gertie, who aimed her tommy gun at them from behind, revealing she was the one who hired Lucky Larry to steal Lilith's ring.\n\nShe revealed her master plan to use the ring to save her husband, Bill from his cancer as she assumed it was the ring that saved Lilith from being killed after being caught in the crossfire between the Stompanato Boys and the Brooklyn Bridge Gang. Lucifer had enough of this \"ringamorale\" and shot Willy in the foot with Jack's gun to prove the ring doesn't grant immortality. As expected, Willy screamed out in agony and while Lilith and Gertie talked about why she did all this, Lucifer and Jack tended to William.[16]\n\nSaying Goodbye to Lilith\n\nAs Lucifer and Lilith watched Willy hulled away in a police car, Jack approached them asking if they either blame Stompanato for Gertie's crimes or arrest Gertie herself. They glanced at Gertie sitting by two officers and, feeling sympathy for her, chose the former so she can spend whatever time her husband has left with him. Lucifer was then left alone with Jack, who complimented their teamwork despite him being a \"odd duck.\" They tipped their hats in farewell and went their separate ways.\n\nLater, he and Lilith stood alone in a street corner, where he recounted the current events and how he has finally repaid his debt to her. He bid farewell till their next reunion in a couple hundred years, but Lilith declined. Thinking she was referring to living up his debt, Lucifer offered his castle in Austria, but she still declined, saying that Gertie was right in having a mortal life that made a connection meaningful.\n\nMuch to Lucifer's surprise, she decided to give up her immortality. Lilith put her immortality in the ring, turning the white rock black, and offers it to Lucifer. Taking it, he reminded her that there would be no going back once she goes through with this, but she remained steadfast in her decision, asking for one more thing from Lucifer.\n\nThough annoyed that \"it never ends\" with her, he asked if she would like him to bring her children up to say her goodbyes. Scowling, she blandly declined, not wanting all the hard work she put in making them perfect to be undone. She made Lucifer promise to never to tell them what happened to her. They gave each other a heartfelt last goodbye before Lucifer returned to Hell and Lilith went to live a normal life. Lucifer would never take the ring off, as it reminded him of his oldest friend.[16]\n\nMagic Castle Member\n\nWhen the Magic Castle opened in Los Angeles on January 2, 1963, Lucifer became a member on the day it opened its doors. In 1971, he refereed a drinking competition between Dai Vernon and David Copperfield, but couldn't resist competing, and ended up winning.[30]\n\nFaking The King's Death\n\nIn 1977, Lucifer made a deal with Elvis Presley to help him fake his death, presumably helping him get a new identity. Lucifer became the sole individual to know where \"The King\" relocated to.[34]\n\nCelebrating the End of the 90s\n\nHaving despised the 1990s with its frosted tips, dial-ups, and Creed, Lucifer never visited Earth during that time. The one exception was to celebrate the decades' end. During the '99 Falcons/Broncos Super Bowl in Miami, he had an orgy with 36 people for 15 minutes. During that time he used his desire mojo to bring out Esther Barnum's desires to be a rabbi.[28] This would be the last time Lucifer visited Earth for 12 years of its time.[23]\n\nMoving to Earth\n\nVacation to Los Angeles\n\nIn 2011, Lucifer decided to take another leave from ruling Hell and landed on a beach in Los Angeles, eventually moving there.[35]\n\nDeal with Amenadiel\n\nNeeding the help of his demon soldier, friend, and servant, Mazikeen, to help locate Amenadiel's lost necklace, Lucifer made a deal with John Constantine of Earth-1 to get her out; thus Lucifer owed Constantine a favor.[36] Following the retrieval of the necklace, Lucifer cashed in the favor Amenadiel owed him to leave him and Mazikeen alone on Earth.[23]\n\nSevering Ties with his Old Life\n\nTo ensure he could not be tempted to return to Hell, Lucifer rendezvoused with Maze at the beach he landed on when he arrived and ordered her to sever his wings. Sharing an intense gaze with her, he unfurled his Angelic wings and kneeled on the ground. Lucifer held in the pain he felt as Maze sliced through his skin, and gazed up at the sky. He gritted his teeth in a defiant grin for his Father, signifying him leaving his old life behind as his wings fell to the ground.[23]\n\nLucifer then opened the nightclub Lux with Maze's assistance.[14] He stored his wings in a container and housed it in a warehouse.[3] Now a resident of L.A., Lucifer went to Neil Palmer to retrieve the falsified paperwork he required to be a legal citizen without having been born on Earth.[37] Sometime later, he met Ozzy Osbourne and granted a great many favors for him.[5]\n\nAnti-Monitor Crisis\n\nSome years later, Lucifer became aware of the Anti-Monitor Crisis impacting the Multiverse, but was indifferent toward the situation. As he was leaving Lux through the back with two women, he found Constantine and his two compatriots waiting for him. With Constantine here to collect on the favor he owed him, he had the ladies return to the bar so he could conduct his business.\n\nEnthusiastically greeting \"Johnny,\" Lucifer was less then thrilled to see the warlock outside his bar on his Earth. Noticing Mia Smoak's beauty, Lucifer introduced himself as The Devil, though Mia didn't believe him, and used his mojo to discover what she truly desired. Learning that it was to save her father, Lucifer related with it being \"daddy issues,\" just like him and his Father.\n\nGetting back on the topic of why they were here, Lucifer learned they need his help in retrieving Oliver Queen's soul from Purgatory. Shrugging off the urgency of the current Crisis, he agreed to aide the trio, only because of Constantine helping Maze get to Earth. Before providing his assistance, he locked eyes with John Diggle and noted his \"tall, dark, annoyed by [him],\" demeanor reminded him of Amenadiel.\n\nDiggle demanded he cut out his foolishness and help them which only made Lucifer become attracted to his demeanor towards him. Always living up to his deals, Lucifer gifted them a Purgatory Teleportation Card to use to save Oliver's soul. He, however, warned them that they only had a limited time within Purgatory and their souls would be destroyed if they didn't return to the mortal plane before the card of him playing a piano with his Devil face faded away.\n\nHe bid \"Constantyne\" and his compatriots farewell, giving one last flirtatious look at Mia before returning to his activities as normal. After the Multiverse was destroyed, Lucifer returned to his life as normal once the Paragons and Spectre rebooted the Multiverse at the Dawn of Time; though Lucifer's history was altered so that he personally brought Maze to Earth.[36]\n\nBy 2016, Lucifer had settled into a hedonistic lifestyle in Los Angeles revolving around running Lux and making Faustian deals with various people in various industries in exchange for favors. But then one night he witnessed the murder of a close acquaintance. Lacking faith in the L.A.P.D., Lucifer inserted himself into the investigation, working with homicide detective Chloe Decker. After the case was solved, Lucifer decided to continue working with Chloe as an LAPD Civilian Consultant.\n\nThroughout the Series\n\nThis section is a stub. You can help by expanding it.\n\nAt the start of the \"Pilot\", Lucifer is pulled over for speeding. After bribing his way out, he continues to his nightclub, Lux. Later that evening, burnt-out singer, and old friend Delilah visits Lux to see Lucifer, and asks him if she had sold her soul to the Devil. He laughed and said that would imply the Devil was interested in her soul, that all her choices were on her. He then called in his favor telling her it would be difficult for her; \"Pull yourself together,\" then said she was wasting her talent, her life. As he walks her down the street, they are gunned down by a low-level drug dealer, and it kills Delilah, but merely angers Lucifer.\n\nLacking faith in the LAPD, which he calls a corrupt organization, Lucifer takes matters into his own hands and follows up on some leads of his own, which inevitably causes him to cross paths with detective, Chloe Decker, who had previously interviewed Lucifer as the witness to the shooting. Lucifer convinces her to allow him to accompany her on the investigation when he has leads for her to follow, though she remains oblivious to his true identity. Lucifer was vaguely disturbed and fascinated to find Chloe was immune to his \"charms\".\n\nThe investigation leads the duo to Delilah's producer, who reveals he had her killed to benefit from skyrocketing sales of her album after her death. Chloe shoots the armed producer who wounded then shoots Chloe. He also shoots Lucifer six times to no effect, while a dazed and frightened Chloe watches. Lucifer picks up the producer by the neck turns him to face the mirror and vows to punish him severely, leaving his fate ambiguous. Lucifer later visits Chloe at the hospital and tells her he's glad she's not dead. Amenadiel confronts him about the consequences of his actions, and the two snarl at each other and part.\n\nIn \"Once Upon a Time\", God presents an alternate universe that was completely identical to the original universe up to John Decker's murder. In this alternate reality John survived the ambush that would have killed him, and progressed to detective lieutenant in his career. Chloe remained an actress, starring as cop, Bonnie Generro, in four action movies, the result being Lucifer and Chloe did not meet on the night of Delilah's murder, and it was never properly solved by a lazy and corrupt Dan Espinoza. Lucifer remained an aloof and arrogant club owner, and in 2018 was planning to expand Lux to Las Vegas, with the aid of his lawyer Charlotte Richards. The Devil and the actress teamed up to solve the murder of her stuntman friend, with God pointing out sometimes it doesn't matter the circumstances, some are always drawn to the same people every time.\n\nEmbracing his Darker Impulses\n\nTo be added\n\nIncreasing Self-Hatred\n\nTaking the First Steps\n\nTo be added\n\nDemon Uprising\n\nReturning to Normal\n\nAfter placing Monopolize in holding, Lucifer and Chloe were approached by Ella who revealed an image of Halla still alive coming out of a Pazo Papollo's Pizza delivery car. He and Ella figured it was all a publicity stunt, to which Chloe agreed and suggested Lucifer go home and rest since there was no murder to solve. Agreeing with his partner, Lucifer hoped for a murder tomorrow to solve and headed back to Lux.[21]\n\nAn Unholy Reunion\n\nAfter the unexpected reunion, Lucifer returned to his penthouse and went to sleep on his sofa. He was awoken by Maze and Chloe. He questioned if he was still dreaming, but quickly realized he wasn't as the two women weren't naked. He then became annoyed that they woke him up just to tell him what he already knew about Demons being loose in Los Angeles and how Kinley sent them as a way to prevent the prophecy.\n\nHe assured them that he \"sent them packing\" and revealed said roaming Demons were the incompetent Dromos and Squee, which Maze shared his hatred with them, particularly Squee. While Maze went to make sure they returned to Hell, Lucifer went to get a drink from the decanter on the piano. He was then stunned by Chloe's suggestion he leave L.A. for a while, fearing the prophecy was really about Demons coming to the city.\n\nLucifer then asked how she and Maze got into this investigation in the first place but was shocked to hear that she was following a lead on Kinley without him. Interpreting this as Chloe still being afraid of him despite their progress in their relationship, Lucifer refused to listen to Chloe try to explain and suggested she leave. However, Chloe soon got a text, and much to Lucifer's horror, he found out that Charlie had been kidnapped.[21]\n\nCharlie's Kidnapping\n\nThe duo arrived at the penthouse, with Lucifer failing to get in touch with Amenadiel and Maze. He and Chloe were then greeted by the site of his home being trashed. Lucifer became furious, believing this was more retribution from the Demons by lashing out on his penthouse. However, after Chloe figured the Demons were in fact searching for something, Lucifer noticed his safe was open.\n\nUpon searching through its contents, Lucifer found that Kinley's vile was the only thing missing. When questioned why he kept it, he defended his actions as wanting to dispose of properly. He then came to the horrible realization that the Demons weren't seeking vengeance on him, but rather planning on replacing him with Charlie as Hell's new King, explaining how it can only be ruled by a Celestial.\n\nThey were then interrupted by Eve. Lucifer, however, was in no mood to deal with her desires to get back with him, and insisted she leave, before she revealed she had something on Dromos. Now all ears, Lucifer was dumbfounded to hear that Eve was the one who not only broke Kinley out of jail but was responsible for summoning Dromos into his body all in a misguided attempt to get him back. While furious with Eve putting his nephew in danger, Lucifer remained calm and asked where Charlie was. Unfortunately, Eve had no knowledge of where they were.\n\nDespite this setback, Lucifer and Chloe realized that the Demons were performing the ritual Kinley planned on him for Charlie. Still sore over Chloe's initial betrayal, Lucifer bitterly asked Chloe where Kinley planned on banishing him back to Hell, only to become annoyed that their search radius was narrowed down to the 2 to 3,000 churches in L.A.\n\nFortunately, upon further description from Chloe and Eve remembering Squee talking about one of the old civilizations, they were able to piece together they were headed to the \"oxymoronic venue\" of The Mayan to perform the ritual. With a location they headed to the elevator, but Lucifer, still angry at Eve for her recklessness, ordered her to stay in the penthouse so not to cause any more damage and left.[21]\n\nBattle at the Myan\n\nLucifer and Chloe returned to the precinct to wrap the case up. However, Ella came over to them at the former's desk voicing her confusion as to why many of the bodies that were at The Myan were thrashed. The two attempted to cover it up as the victims of Kinsley's supposed cult being into \"downright demonic\" stuff, which Ella decided to go with despite the evidence saying the bodies died twice.\n\nAfter she left, Lucifer voiced his belief that if it weren't for Ella's forensic skills, he would've lost his \"half-angel nephew.\" He then shared Chloe's frustration of not being able to tell their friend the truth but reminded her of Humanity's less than ideal reactions to discovering that the Celestial world existed, even if they believed deep down like Ella did.[38]\n\nA Heartbreaking Goodbye\n\nLucifer then returned to Lux, where he realized that he had to return to Hell to keep the Demons in line or else they would revolt again. He stood out in his balcony, observing the city he had come to call his home when Chloe approached him to let him know Charlie was home. She asked if it was over, and though Lucifer wanted say yes, he couldn't as it would be a lie.\n\nHe turned towards her and confirmed that they won tonight's battle, but it was just stopping \"one hole in a very flimsy boat.\" He explains that with the Demons now knowing he had no intentions of returning as Hell's king they would continue to rebel and probably make another attempt at Charlie or even Chloe herself as a means to hurt him.\n\nLucifer then told the distraught Chloe that she was right about the prophecy being about Hell coming to Earth and that to prevent it from coming true, he had to return to Hell to make the Demons toe the line. Much to his surprise, Chloe confessed her love for him and tried to convince him to stay. Though overjoyed to hear Chloe's feelings revealed, Lucifer remained committed to keep his loved ones safe.\n\nBefore he departed, he wiped the tears from Chloe's cheek and tells her that the priests were wrong about another part of the prophecy; Eve wasn't his first love, Chloe was and always has been. The two then kissed each other in a passionate goodbye kiss. Departing, Lucifer bid his first love a heartbreaking goodbye after she begged one more time for him to stay with her.\n\nHe then unfurls his restored angelic wings, now feeling worthy of them once again. He raised a hand to Chloe's cheek and said goodbye one last time before leaving her and everyone he loved forever. Sitting on his towering throne alone, Lucifer overlooked the grim, ash-covered realm of Hell, resuming his duties as its sovereign once again.[21]\n\nReestablished Ruler of Hell\n\nAn Unexpected New Resident\n\nLucifer is resigned when he returns to Hell, telling himself it's his duty to keep humanity safe, but he still longs for Los Angeles and to be reunited with the Detective. In an attempt to feel close to her again, he helps a newcomer to Hell solve his own murder for old times' sake.[39] Due to his position in the underworld, Lucifer is successful in gaining leads in the case, and when the opportunity arises, he sends Gromos to Earth to deliver those clues to Chloe through a recently dead killer.[39]\n\nLucifer reveals to the soul - Lee Garner - that souls punish themselves with their own guilt, and that no one is able to work through it. He visits Lee in the man's Hell loop and points out where the man's guilt lies, before departing to his throne. [39] Despite his desire to return to Earth, Lucifer remains in Hell.[39]\n\nReturning to Earth\n\nLearning of Michael's Schemes\n\nAfter departing with Lee in his Hell Loop, Lucifer wondered the corridors alone, when to his surprise, Amenadiel approached him. Though Lucifer was happy to see his eldest brother after all this time in Hell, he questioned why he was being paid this visit. He became concerned when Amenadiel's response was just that the time had come for Lucifer to return, knowing he wouldn't be asking for his help unless something serious had happened. Worried for Chloe's safety, Lucifer demanded to know what has happened in his absence.[5]\n\nLucifer agrees to return to Earth to deal with Michael, leaving Amenadiel in charge if Hell while he's away.[34]\n\nA Not So Happy Reunion\n\nWhen he reappeared at the precinct, where he thought \"burnt coffee and body odor never smelled so good\" he had to convince Chloe he was Lucifer and not Michael, and after a heartfelt embrace she informed him Michael told her she was a gift from God, then was furious when Lucifer could not deny it, and had never told her, their reunion was ruined.\n\nLucifer begins working with Decker again, but finds that he has also alienated Mazikeen, who attacks him in a rage for not taking her back to Hell with him. He remarks that she's no longer his servant and can return to Hell whenever she wishes, and that she could have asked Amenadiel to transport her.[34]\n\nBrother vs Brother\n\nLucifer eventually meets with his brother, Michael, and the two talk. Michael needles Lucifer's fears and chronic paranoia, suggesting all his actions, from the rebellion to the LA vacay, have been influenced by Michael's whispers. The two viciously fight, and when Lucifer gains the upper hand he tells Michael his next action was his decision alone, and carves a scar his face with one of Mazikeen's blades.[34]\n\nStory Time at the Penthouse\n\nLucifer still wanted to make things right with Chloe before he returned to Hell, so he invited her and Trixie to one of their game nights; Chloe never answered. Despite this, Lucifer got his penthouse ready for them, setting out a Monopoly board, food, and wine on the table. Hearing the elevator ring, he greeted the \"ladies,\" only to find Trixie had arrived without her mother.\n\nUpon hearing that Trixie was staying with Dan for the night, Lucifer became worried about Chloe's mental state and asked if she had spoken to her about being a gift from God, but she wasn't interested in \"grown-up problems.\" With Trixie already here, Lucifer offered the two of them play Monopoly anyway, but she declined, deeming it no fun with only two people.[16]\n\nChanges\n\nIn Detective Amenadiel, Chloe's struggle with the concept of 'gift from God' is finally resolved with the help of Amenadiel who tells her that the \"gift\" is not Chloe, but the fact that Chloe is the only mortal who can see Lucifer for who he truly is, and in turn, he chose to be vulnerable around her. She then went to Lucifer and told him if he chose to be vulnerable around her \"I choose to be vulnerable around you.\"\n\nAfter Lucifer and Chloe finally consummate their relationship, despite their happiness in each other, it's discovered that Chloe can mojo Lucifer and Lucifer finds that he is no longer able to draw out people's desires. The loss shakes Lucifer, who has never had to share before, and worries Chloe when he can't stop obsessing, and tells him that maybe it's a good thing, perhaps he has finally allowed her to make the tiniest dent in the huge wall he has built around himself.\n\nFollowing the loss of his \"mojo\", Lucifer feels he is useless in the partnership with Chloe, given he no longer contributes anything, but she points out his many contributions including the fact that he can speak all languages, and he is her own version of a Swiss Army Knife. The two settle things between them with Lucifer acknowledging \"what I call powerlessness is what everyone else calls Tuesday.\" Daniel then interrupts them and shoots Lucifer on Michael's orders after Michael had orchestrated Dan finally seeing a glimpse of his brother's devil face previously.[40] Lucifer, much to his and Chloe's shock, is no longer vulnerable, even around Chloe, and he is able to withstand the impact of the bullet.[41]\n\nSibling Squabble\n\nAfter Michael subverts Mazikeen by telling her about Lucifer keeping a secret about Lilith from her, Lucifer loses Mazikeen's allegiance, and she aligns herself with Michael. When the angels on Earth finally get down to battle, Lucifer and Amenadiel fight Maze and Michael. The battle is interrupted, however, when God appears on Earth to stop the fighting between his children.[41]\n\nHe and his brothers staggered at the sight of their Father in Human form before they all furled their wings. In response to Michael trying to play the victim of their conflict, Lucifer sarcastically remarked that as always he was responsible for anything bad and told their Father to blame him as He always did. He was then frustrated that Amenadiel chose to take full responsibility due to his stature as the eldest.\n\nLucifer snarked at the idea of being civil with his twin after God voiced His desire for His children to get along. He was then revolted as Michael embraced Amenadiel in his attempt to stay on their Father's good side. When Michael attempted to give him a hug, Lucifer refuses outright and vehemently. As he attempted to leave, the sound of his Father referring to him Samael made him stop in his tracks.\n\nFurious with both Michael and God, Lucifer listed all the despicable things his twin had done while on Earth, but was unable to call Chloe his love when he recounted him kidnapping her. He then exclaimed how Michael orchestrated his downfall and berated his Father for not being able to stop anything he did despite being omnipotent. With one last look at Amenadiel, Lucifer left the precinct in a huff.[6]\n\nBattle for Supremacy\n\nDeclaration of War\n\nWith LeMec taken care of, Lucifer went to Linda that night for a session over recent events. He started by informing her that he and Maze made LeMec and his crew suffer for killing Dan. When asked how that made him feel, he deemed his feelings were irrelevant compared to Dan's death. He then chuckled at Linda's astute observation of how important the grieving process was.\n\nHe complimented Linda on how good she was at her job, but believed that a therapist job shouldn't consist. He then clarified that he thought pain shouldn't exist entirely when Linda asked if he was referring to someone helping people cope. Lucifer then lost his temper when Linda said that pain was inevitable, but suffering was optional. He tells her that the system his Father established was broken.\n\nHe expresses his despair of Trixie having to suffer the loss of her father in such a horrific way. Then as he was about to reveal that Dan was in Hell, Lucifer decided to follow Amenadiel's decision and just deem that Dan shouldn't be dead in the first place. Lucifer deems the God's system has not only broken, but unjust. Lucifer was then told that it was impossible for him to control all the bad in the world, just how it affected him\n\nLucifer, however, said that Linda was wrong in what he could do. He confesses that he wanted to be God for the wrong reason in proving himself worthy of Chloe. However, after what Michael has done to claim the throne, he no longer wanted to be God, rather, he had to be God. Linda asked what he meant. Lucifer answered by declaring war on Michael for the throne of Heaven.[12]\n\nAla a Ala\n\nTo be added\n\nProving his Love\n\nTo be added\n\nThe New God\n\nDespite being seemingly incinerated for violating his banishment, Lucifer was mysteriously resurrected. He called down to Chloe to stop her from vengefully eradicating Michael with the Blade of Death and flew down next to her. Furling his wings, he reminded his girlfriend that this rage wasn't her and was given the blade to render judgement on to his twin.\n\nHe ordered his shocked brother to take a knee and face his sentencing. Lucifer reignited the Flaming Sword after the others arrived at the arched entrance to see the conclusion of the battle and Michael extended his wings in acceptance of his execution. However, Lucifer instead sliced Michael's wings off, declaring that there would be no more killing, giving Amenadiel a small nod, to which he returned.\n\nLucifer decided to grant his twin brother a second chance, having learned in his time on Earth that everyone deserved one, even people like the two of them. Chloe questioned how Lucifer survived, but he was just as surprised as she was. He then looked toward his gathered siblings and allies and became confused when Amenadiel took a knee before him, followed by his allies, brothers and sisters, and even Michael.\n\nWith everyone, minus Chloe, bowing before him, Lucifer finally came to the realization that he had succeeded in proving his worth having risked sacrificing his life to revive Chloe, and thus, his banishment from Heaven was lifted. He shakenly raised the Flaming Sword to signify his victory, slightly grinning at his success in taking their Father's place as the new Ruler of the Universe. Now the new deity, Lucifer looked on at his new subjects and muttered a \"Oh, my me!\", unsure of what to do next.[13]\n\nAftermath\n\nShortly after the battle, Lucifer imprisoned Michael in Hell to scrub its floors as a way to repent for his crimes on Earth.[42] He also freed Dan from his Hell-Loop, ordering the Demons not to torture him. He placed him in his own little Purgatory, playing ping-pong with Belios in a replication of the LAPD bullpen, while trying to help him figure out what lingering guilt he had that kept him from reaching Heaven.[30] He chose not to bring Dan back up to Earth as a Ghost to figure out his guilt because he knew it would've been more torturous for him to be around all his Human loved ones, especially Trixie, and not be able to interact with them.[28]\n\nPostponing Ascension to Godhood\n\nLast Night of Wonder\n\nTo be added\n\nHealer of Hell\n\nTherapy Session\n\nOnce Lucifer returned to Hell for good to become its healer, he created a therapy office that was an exact replica of Linda's. There he took on the role of a therapist to help the lost souls deserving of redemption deal with their guilt and make it to Heaven.[43]\n\nLong-Overdue Reunion\n\nDecades after Lucifer's return to Hell, Chloe Decker passed away, her daughter Rory at her side. After she expressed her desire to be reunited with Lucifer, she descended into Hell, where the she and Lucifer reunited.\n\nPersonality\n\n“ You know, Lucifer has a tendency to project his issues onto external sources when what he really needs to do is face his issues head on. „ — Linda Martin to Eve\n\nin \"Super Bad Boyfriend\"\n\nBeing the Devil and a Celestial Being who has been alive since the Dawn of Time, Lucifer's perspective of life is vast and as such, sees Human lives as ephemeral as memories and holds little value to them, considering from his point of view a human lifetime seems inconsequential (with notable exceptions). Therefore, he never runs when chasing his prey. Lucifer views his time on Earth as a vacation as much as a Human would consider a vacation to a wildlife park.\n\nCharming, eloquent and sophisticated, and fully aware of the fact, Lucifer carries himself with an air of supreme confidence, charisma, and egotism, even arrogance, which is due in part to his vast supernatural powers such as his Immortality, near-invulnerability, and knack for coaxing Humans to spill their hidden secrets to him. Because of this, Lucifer is always sure of success in whatever he does, regardless of whatever obstacles are in his way, and fears no consequences. On the rare occasions where he fails to get what he is after, Lucifer usually displays remarkable temper control, often viewing such happenings with amusement and curiosity rather than frustration. It takes a great personal betrayal, or attack on someone he cares about, such as Chloe Decker, to actually enrage Lucifer; when this happens, he can become ruthless and terrifying. When his anger is triggered, he will often have a vicious smile on his face, blazing red eyes, and sometimes, glimpses of his devil face shine through.\n\nAs a Fallen Angel, Lucifer is completely out of step with the social norms and societal rules of humans - or, more likely, he simply chooses to ignore them. As a result, Lucifer tends to be brutally honest with every Human he comes across and enjoys acting inappropriately in any situation, regardless of the circumstances. Humans, who are unaware of his true identity, typically perceive Lucifer as sarcastic, rude, insensitive, completely inappropriate, arrogant, and incredibly irritating, even though they feel compelled to tell him their darkest secrets, due to his power over desire.\n\nLucifer is openly pansexual[44] and sexually promiscuous. He has had sex with billions of men and women over the centuries he has been on Earth since the beginning of Human civilization. Almost all Humans find him sexually attractive, which he sometimes uses to his advantage when he strikes deals with them. Lucifer was said to have had 92 sexual partners in eight weeks; Lucifer himself notes he has \"tremendous stamina\", stating he can have sex ten times a day. Lucifer even says whoever he sleeps with is thoroughly exhausted to the point they sleep well through the night; he is also creative with sexual techniques. Referring to the 92 people previously, Lucifer considers the number \"a dry spell\", suggesting sex primarily takes up his time when not assisting Chloe. To his horror, Goddess claims Lucifer inherited his sexually prolific tendencies from her.\n\nDeep down, under his confident exterior, Lucifer appears to be somewhat insecure, and has vast issues with rejection and abandonment. He is hurt and angry when Amenadiel calls him evil, and hints that all their siblings see him that way, and challenges him to fight. When Chloe shows him genuine sympathy and concern regarding the scars on his back, he briefly displays an uncharacteristic gentleness and emotional vulnerability when she tried to touch them. When Linda Martin started to theorize that God sent Lucifer to Hell because he was the only one God trusted with the job, Lucifer's distain for being blamed for all Humanity's sins as a result of his Father's decision came to the surface.\n\nLucifer has a tenuous relationship with his Angelic kin as a result of his rebellion against God, but is completely unafraid of other Angels, such as Amenadiel, whom he treats with disdain and disinterest, despite the Angel's threats against him. During the bidding for religious artifacts, Lucifer and Amenadiel joked about St. Paul being too fat to fit in the chains shown at the auction, showing that they subconsciously care about each other, but immediately stopped when they realized they were getting along. After he killed his brother, Uriel, in order to prevent him from killing Chloe and their Mother, Lucifer was emotionally shattered. He also became very self-destructive, having no qualms about trying to force a sniper to kill him to punish himself for what he had done. This shows that despite being casted out of Heaven and strained relationship that came from it, Lucifer still loves his Angelic brothers and sisters dearly. This was also shown by the fact that he refused to let his Goddess return to Heaven, as he knew that there would be another war if She did and that more of his Angelic siblings would die. The true test of Lucifer's love for his siblings comes when he has a chance to eradicate his twin Michael, who he deeply despised for billions of years and had wreaked havoc on all of Lucifer's loved ones, chose to instead spare his life, not wanting anymore of his siblings to die.\n\nDespite his flaws, Lucifer is very loyal and cares about humanity. During his time on Earth, Lucifer has gained a penchant for using his great powers for good, not only punishing wrong doers, but also gaining justice for the innocent in the process.\n\nLucifer has said he hates his Father, often criticizing people when they mention Him, and gets annoyed with expressions containing the word \"God\". The mere mention of the name that God gave him, Samael, causes Lucifer great discomfort, as it reminded him of his neglect and abandonment by his Father. Lucifer's hatred of God extends to God's followers, as when Father Frank Lawrence came to Lucifer for help, he was quickly denied and Lucifer assumed Frank had something to hide. However, as he became closer to Frank, Lucifer showed a more vulnerable side, revealing to Frank that his distain for his Father comes from His abandonment of him. Despite all of Lucifer's disdain towards God, he in fact still loved his Father, and just wanted that love returned.\n\nAfter his rebellion, Lucifer subconsciously believed he was evil, self-actualizing the Devil Face to prove it. One of the few things that can truly annoy him is when people blame him when something goes wrong or when they say he made them do it, as deep down he does believe that as if it weren't for his failed rebellion, he wouldn't be portrayed as the embodiment of evil and used as a scapegoat for peoples' crimes. His self-loathing eventually got so bad that he created a Devil body and wings for himself to drive home the message that he ruins everything he touches. He was able to take the first steps to forgiving himself, forgoing the Devil body, and regaining his Angelic wings. He still maintained his Devil face, showing that in some ways he still sees himself in a negative way even after Chloe's complete acceptance of him and proving himself worthy to be God's successor.\n\nHe hates charlatans, people who don't actually believe what they preach, like Jacob Williams. He also dislikes Satanists (as \"the whole worship thing is more my father's bag\") and is associated with goats (which was a prank by Amenadiel). Another is being accused of lying: while Lucifer is one of the greatest manipulators in the Universe, he never knowingly lies. (His mother the Goddess confirms this, and Amenadiel and Mazikeen seem to take it as a given). Although he will use hyperbole when he is joking or teasing, if he says something in earnest it is the truth. He is quite proud of this and it offends him when others don't believe him.\n\nIn addition, Lucifer is extremely bold, with Amenadiel noting that he has never seen the former scared, with Lucifer only showing signs of fear after learning that his mother had broken out of Hell. Though realizing the significance of Pierce's identity as Cain also had Lucifer worried. He also displayed extreme worry when he saw his wings had changed. And when he began to morph into his Full Body Devil Form, he was worried about what he would become afterward.\n\nLucifer found himself drawn to Chloe when they met (aside from the vague memory of Hot Tub High School), finding her immunity to his charm intriguing if disturbing. Through their work together with the LAPD, Lucifer began discovering new sides to himself; he found avenging murder victims by capturing their killers more satisfying than outright punishing them. In addition, he grew less physically violent, preferring to intimidate criminals. Lucifer found himself willing to protect Chloe, even after learning her presence makes him vulnerable. Learning about her past and family, Lucifer grew closer to Chloe as he could identify with some of her past troubles. Ultimately, Lucifer realized he loved Chloe, with her love being what he truly desired. After the Cain incident, Lucifer awkwardly attempted to start a genuine romance between them; however, it was derailed thanks to Kinley and Eve. Despite their relationship being strained, Lucifer did maintain their work relationship. After saving Charlie from the demons, Lucifer realized the truth: despite Eve being his first lover, Chloe was the first woman he truly loved.\n\nLucifer still teased Daniel, but was more friendly with him; he even tried helping him cope with the knowledge of the Celestials, since Daniel was slowly spiraling after meeting God (plus a brief death). Though Lucifer was not above pulling an elaborate prank on Daniel for shooting him. Upon Dan's death and learning he was in Hell, Lucifer was stunned, \"it isn't fair\"; showing how much he saw Daniel as a friend. Lucifer's friendship with Daniel led him to alter Dan’s Hell Loop, leaving it as a Purgatory while they tried to find out why he was stuck in Hell after seeming to have already resolved his guilt. When Daniel became a Ghost trapped on Earth, Lucifer was patient and tried to help him further, showing that all antagonism was gone and he truly valued Daniel. He even tried to encourage Daniel to start a new life when he became accidentally possessed Vincent Le Mec’s body, and then encouraged him to see Trixie to give her a proper goodbye. Upon finding out that Dan had in fact made it to Heaven, Lucifer was truly pleased.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\n“ He was firing at you... Why aren't you... more dead?\n\nYou're having a very hard time with the immortal thing, aren't you? „ – Chloe and Lucifer\n\nin Pilot\n\nPowers\n\nArchangel Physiology: As one of the oldest and most powerful Angels, Lucifer is extremely powerful and has their powers, as well as their weaknesses. He's noted to have once been the greatest of God's Angels even by Amenadiel himself, with Lucifer proving to surpass his older brother's might when he actually wanted to fight him, and even when Michael had established himself as God's right-hand, Lucifer was still more powerful than his twin brother. Lucifer is capable of performing certain supernatural magical abilities, as well as being able to use Celestial items or weapons, such as his Pentecostal Coin and the Blade of Death, which Humans are unable to handle safely.\n\nSuperhuman Strength: Lucifer, like all Angels, is incredibly strong, capable of exerting immense amounts of superhuman physical force and has vast levels of superhuman strength when he so desires, the full extent of which remains unknown but said to be among the strongest of God's Angels. He is able to effortlessly overpower Humans, notably able to send a large man flying back over 30 feet through a glass wall with a one-handed light mere push, easily bending metal bars and punching through brick walls, sending a large man flying back over 60 feet with a mere push, and to lift other men high off of the ground by the throat without any issue, or more recently to hold back a 6,000-pound accelerating SUV while injured, and in the proximity of Chloe Decker. Lucifer's strength was most prominently shown when he fought Amenadiel and Michael, both of whom are known to be some of the strongest Angels, as well as in his scuffles with two Demons and Dromos, with him easily defeating them, flinging one of them away with a single strike and powerfully knocking the other down before swiftly overpowering and beating Dromos to make him bleed. And despite being stalemated by Mazikeen when holding back and after having been previously attacked by her, he later on proved to be tremendously stronger than her in their recent fight in the Los Angeles Police Department, knocking her unconscious with a strike, easily defeating her.\n\nSuperhuman Speed: Like all Angels, Lucifer is extraordinarily fast. He is much faster than Humans, Demons, animals, and other beings. He can appear and disappear with a blink of an eye. It is unknown how fast he is while running, but he has shown to be able to move super humanly fast.\n\nSuperhuman Endurance: Lucifer is shown to be barely affected by injuries the pain of injuries that would have been extremely painful to a normal human, even when in the vicinity of the detective, including stabs and burns and even gunshots. One notable example is in \"All About Eve\", when he stabbed all the way through his shoulder with a pool cue, while he appeared to be in a little pain, he was seemingly more annoyed than anything else.\n\nSuperhuman Reflexes: Lucifer, like all Angels, possesses extraordinary superhuman reflexes. He is able to effortlessly catch knives thrown at him at vast superhuman speeds at very close range by Mazikeen, and easily block, dodge, or deflect incoming damage from experienced Human fighters, Demons, and Angels.\n\nSuperhuman Dexterity: Lucifer possesses a super humanly accurate aiming ability, on one occurrence being able to accurately throw a tire on a running man, hitting his head and knocking him out. He was also able to throw it with just enough strength to only knock him out, without further damaging him.\n\nImmortality: Lucifer, like all Angels, is immortal, billions of years old, immune to age, disease and toxins, having lived since the beginning of creation. He has eternal youthful beauty and will live for all eternity without ever aging. He also cannot die of any natural cause. The only known things that can kill him are the Flaming Sword and Demon Daggers Forged In Hell.\n\nInvulnerability: Lucifer, like all Angels, has a highly durable body, which can withstand a vast amount of physical damage, as such Lucifer can't be damaged in any way by Humans. Bullets and knives bounce harmlessly off of his body, as shown several times throughout the series. Lucifer described being shot with guns as being just a little pressure of that of a flick or a \"nuisance\". Eventually, being in proximity of Chloe Decker impaired this ability, rendering him mortal and vulnerable. However, this issue has been resolved, as such Lucifer can use his invulnerability without limitation anymore.\n\nAccelerated Metabolism: While Lucifer can be affected by mind-altering substances, his tolerance for them is far higher than that of a Human. He's able to consume vast quantities of alcohol and drugs without negative effects. The effects also wear off much faster than with mortals, allowing him to sober up quickly after consumption has ended, as evidenced in Monster, where Lucifer complains that his \"pesky supernatural metabolism keeps getting in the way\" when he's trying to drown his emotions regarding Uriel. This ability seems to be impaired when Chloe Decker is in the vicinity, as seen in God Johnson, but not completely, as he still has difficulty getting drunk when Chloe is around. In season 4, he said that he can't be drunk on normal amounts of alcohol.\n\nRegenerative Healing Factor: As witnessed numerous times throughout the show, Lucifer heals much faster than humans do. He can heal any injuries within minutes to hours. On one occasion, he stated, \"at least I'm healing fast\".\n\nTemptation Inducement: Lucifer, being highly sexual, can easily make himself carnally irresistible to most women (and men), which he sometimes uses to his advantage when he strikes deals with them. However, some select few people, such as Chloe Decker, seem to be more resistant to this power, at least to an extent, as even she had some trouble hiding her attraction to Lucifer's naked body after first seeing it in Manly Whatnots, although this may not be a result of any powers that Lucifer may possess, but simple attraction. Ella, however, never viewed Lucifer in a carnal light, and said she loved him like a brother - perhaps a result of a lifetime of Azreal's influence on her.\n\nCosmic Awareness: During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Lucifer displayed some knowledge of the Multiverse and its existence due to the fact he told John Constantine that he wasn't happy seeing him again on \"his\" Earth.\n\nShape-Shifting: Lucifer is able to change his appearance into a form he refers to as his \"Devil Form\". That form varies on how strong his self-loathing is. It manifests as a red, monstrous, scarred, and burned-looking version of his normal appearance. Hairless and fiery, blazing, monstrous red eyes, which terrify mortals. He's able to push a mental image of this form into the minds of Humans to torture them, which is different from his physical manifestation of this form. He can also alter only his eyes to red, fiery orbs. His struggle with his feelings of guilt and self-hatred caused his Devil Form to change. This new form included sharp-pointed spinal spikes, a distortion of his torso, and Demon like wings. After taking the first steps towards forgiving himself, Lucifer only retained his Devil face.\n\nFlight: Lucifer's Angel Wings allowed him to fly. He could fly as fast or faster than the speed of light in which he would seemingly disappear from the Human eye, in a similar manner, akin to teleportation. He used these wings not just for travel, but for combat purposes, such as when he shielded the unconscious Chloe from gunfire, flew her to safety, and to take down and disarm criminals coming at him. After receiving a message that Chloe had been kidnapped, Lucifer spread his wings and traveled there within seconds and later to Caleb Mayfield's grave with Amenadiel. Lucifer again used his wings for combat while fighting Michael in the air for a period of time. He flew with Chloe to Central Valley then swiftly to San Francisco in search for Mira Barnum and while fighting Vincent Le Mec's crew, flew on top of a crate to attack one of them.\n\nDimensional Travel: Lucifer is able to traverse interdimensional barriers and travel between Heaven, Hell, and Earth. Throughout the centuries, he would dimensionally travel from Hell to Earth to have fun before eventually returning once Amenadiel showed up. He can physically take Demons from Hell and bring them to Earth or take them from Earth to Hell, or vice versa. He traveled back to Hell to rule for eternity in order to protect Humanity from rogue Demons, before eventually traveling back to the mortal plane to deal with his twin. Due to his banishment from Heaven, Lucifer was unable to travel there. However, after breaking his banishment to save Chloe's life and being brought back after incineration, Lucifer was freely able to return to his former home. He traveled there to see if Dan had made it to Heaven and to return the Blade of Death to Azrael. His last time traveling between dimensions was to return to Hell for good in his mission to redeem the lost souls deserving of redemption and to insure a time-loop remained intact.\n\nHealing: Lucifer is capable of channeling divine power to heal the injuries and harms of others. With his wings, he can instantly heal and cure any wound, injury, illness, disease, or sickness no matter what it is or how bad it is. He can instantly heal Humans, Demons, Angels, animals, and other beings.\n\nResurrection: Lucifer has the ability to resurrect the dead. He can do this by taking a soul and placing it in a deceased body. However, he has only limited control of this process; the soul will just land up in the closest, newest-deceased body, such as he did with Abel.\n\nSpirit Communication: Lucifer, like all Angels, can communicate with Ghosts. He was able to interact with Dan after his soul was placed on Earth from Hell, without being able to physically touch him.\n\nCelestial Communication: Lucifer can communicate with his Angelic siblings by praying to them. He frequently uses this ability to contact Amenadiel, such as to get him to slow time so he could prevent Nick Hofmeister from shooting Josh Bryant. He also communicated with both Uriel and Gabriel.\n\nDesire Exhibition : Lucifer displays the ability to draw out people's hidden desires, akin to hypnosis, mind control, or telepathy, and by extension lower their inhibitions. In some instances, if he applies enough of this power, he can actively compel people to confess internal secrets, sins, and truths, but he usually doesn't. Lucifer must maintain eye contact for his power to work. However, when this ability goes out of control, eye contact is no longer necessary.\n\nTelekinesis: Lucifer is sometimes shown levitating and spinning his Pentecostal Coin with hand or finger gestures. As he says himself, he can also \"turn anything on\", which is shown at various points when he turns cars, people, boats, and machinery on.\n\nDemonic Lordship: Being the Devil and King of Hell, Lucifer has full and total control over all Demons. He was able to command Demons to bow before him and then force them to go back to Hell. In Hell, Lucifer has the power to command any or all Demons to do anything he wishes.\n\nIncineration: Lucifer threatened to Incinerate Dromos, for disobeying his no possession rule.\n\nHell Loop Control: He has total power and control over Hell Loops. With a mere wave of his hand he can freeze the Hell loop he is in, rewind it, and even create as well as alter new ones from the memories of damned souls such as Lee Garner. However if the soul is broken and driven insane like in the case of Jimmy Barnes, control over the Hell Loop may be lost until the psyche is repaired.\n\nSound Manipulation: When Lucifer returned from heaven he spoke in a Divine voice.\n\nCreation:Created a card that allowed Constantine, Diggle and Mia to go to Purgatory.\n\nReality Manipulation: Like all angels Lucifer could grant prayers and have no limitations to what he can achieve.\n\nAstral Projection:Lucifer could project his devil face to humans without physically transforming it.\n\nPower Transference: Through Self-Actualization Lucifer can bestow his powers onto another. As shown with how after sleeping with Chloe she acquired his 'Mojo', leading him to believe she had somehow stolen it.\n\nDimensional Creation: The showrunners of the show said that Lucifer created Hell.\n\nPortal Creation: Lucifer created a card that could apport people to Purgatory.\n\nMadness Manipulation: Lucifer's devil face can cause people to go insane.\n\nPain Manipulation: Lucifer caused Le Mec to feel guilty about Dan's murder.\n\nTeleportation: Lucifer has shown to be able to appear and disappear even without the use of his wings.\n\nTechnology Manipulation: Lucifer has shown the ability to interfere with technology like cars.\n\nShockwave Generation: Lucifer has shown the ability to produce massive amount of shockwave in combat.\n\nPyrokinesis: Lucifer has shown to be able to ignite Azrael's Blade.\n\nVoice Manipulation: Lucifer could change his voice to a demonic tone.\n\nWeather Manipulation (Limited): Lucifer seems to have this ability as when he cried heavy rain could be heard in the background.\n\nThermokinesis: Lucifer seems to have this ability as when he transforms his face could be seen burning.\n\nBroadway Force: Lucifer made people start dancing in Season 4x10.\n\nPower Augmentation: Lucifer is the only one to be able to ignite the Flaming Sword without it being assembled.\n\nAbilities\n\nMaster Hand-To-Hand Combatant: Despite usually convincing his enemies not to fight him, Lucifer is shown multiple times to be an extremely skilled and highly experienced fighter. When dealing with Humans, Lucifer easily toys with them, using their moves against one another and defeating multiple people at the same time with ease, but he can be deadly efficient when he stops playing, as shown in his final fight with Cain, where he initially and casually fended off his assault before getting serious once he was struck by Cain in the shoulder and easily defeated him. His skill is most prominently shown in his fights with other Celestials of great fighting skill, being able to gain the upper hand over his oldest brother Amenadiel, who is one of the most powerful Angels, who was known as God's finest warrior. Lucifer defeated his twin brother Michael and beat down Mazikeen despite holding back and having been struck multiple times by her, he vastly overpowered her and easily defeated her when he actually intended to win the fight.\n\nFlaming Sword Wielder: Lucifer managed to assemble the Flaming Sword with the help of Goddess and Amenadiel in Season 2. The primary component of the sword, Azrael's Blade, is capable of completely eradicating any being from existence. The blade is so powerful that it can even cut through dimensions when in its final form, as Lucifer demonstrated when he helped Goddess get a universe of her own. After Michael recovered Azrael's Blade with the help of Gabriel, he reassembled the Flaming Sword and tried using it to forcibly claim the position of Sovereign of Heaven, as well as kill Lucifer. When Michael was eventually defeated, Lucifer assembled the sword, making him the current wielder of the weapon.\n\nGenius-Level Intellect: As an Archangel Lucifer is a genius by earthly standards as he is naturally more intelligent than normal humans. Due to this, Lucifer has successfully ran his own nightclub for several years, has gained vast wealth and fortune and is one of the most brilliant strategists in the universe, with only his twin brother Michael and his father God being able to outsmart him.\n\nMaster Manipulator: He has a keen ability to understand the mental and emotional weaknesses, desires, and needs of people and determine how best to use them to his advantage. Lucifer used his Pentecostal Coin to convince Malcolm Graham not to kill him. Using his reputation of not lying, Lucifer tricks people by not saying what he will do. This makes Lucifer extremely unpredictable, even to Chloe, who knows him very well. His experience as the King of Hell has made him capable of psychologically bringing Hell to a living soul with a mere whisper to their ear and causing them to torture themselves with their own guilt as he had done to Vincent Le Mec in vengeance for Daniel's death, however, he cannot take away the pain as it stems from their own guilt.\n\nTherapy: Thanks to his sessions with Linda, Lucifer started understanding himself and therefore the concept of self-actualization; making him aware of how guilt affected people deep down. In \"Til Death Do Us Part\", Lucifer showed early signs of being good at it as he remembered much of how Linda described his own behavior. In \"Buckets of Baggage\" and \"Yabba Dabba Do Me\" Lucifer showed the ability to help even those whom he had no emotional or positive attachment to. This ultimately culminates in \"Partners 'Til the End\", where he helped Rory not turn into a monster like he did and realized his calling was to help the damned release their guilt.\n\nSkilled Impersonator of Michael: Lucifer has demonstrated the ability to impersonate his twin brother Michael in a convincing manner, so much so that he was able to fool Ibriel and Raziel with the façade, albeit for a short time. Like his brother did with him, Lucifer was able to mimic Michael's mannerisms, accent, as well as attitude.\n\nSkilled Detective: Although still not as experienced as Chloe, Lucifer has become a skilled detective in his own right. He was able to notice that Rose's sub-dermal implants were Latin for \"children of the goat\", something even Chloe couldn't do. In \"Spoiler Alert\", when Chloe was kidnapped, Lucifer was able to call upon his own detective skills to solve the \"Whisper Killer\" case, impressing Ella Lopez with his ability. After the case was over, Chloe was impressed to hear that Lucifer caught a serial killer all on his own.\n\nOmnilingualism: Lucifer has the ability to speak and understand all Human languages on Earth: In \"Quid Pro Ho\", he fluently converses in Mandarin Chinese; in \"Til Death Do Us Part\", he converses in Korean; and in \"Our Mojo\", he converses in Tagalog. However, by his own admission, this ability does not extend to reading languages as he found speaking in tongues was more useful than reading books.\n\nExceptional Talent in the Arts: Lucifer has shown to be a remarkably talented singer. He sings many times in his club Lux and also in his penthouse above Lux. His repertoire includes \"Sinnerman\", \"All Along the Watchtower\", \"Devil May Care\", \"Eternal Flame\", \"Luck Be a Lady\", \"I Will Survive\" along with Axara, \"Creep\", \"Someone to Watch Over Me\" along with Lilith, \"Wicked Game\", \"Another One Bites The Dust\", along with Ella, Daniel and Chloe, \"Every Breath You Take\" along with JJ's mother (Debbie Gibson), \"I Dreamed A Dream\" along with God, \"It's So Hard To Say Goodbye\" along with Ella, \"Bridge Over Troubled Water\" with Aurora Morningstar and \"You Got It\". In addition to singing, Lucifer is also a notable piano player, stating even that all the greatest pianists of all time were his pupils, such as Mozart, Liberace, and Elton John. His drawing abilities, however, are not on par with his musical ability, as many of his drawings have been shown to be stick figures.\n\nEscapologist: Lucifer displays an uncanny ability to get in and out of cars and closed spaces - with one notable unexplained exception in \"The Sinnerman\" - or get out of ropes and handcuffs. It is unclear if this ability is a mystical power or ordinary skill, however, it was shown he can get into and out of places seemingly without using the physical entrances, even when his wings were cut off.\n\nFaustian Deals: Lucifer frequently offers people deals with an unspecified favor to be paid back later. He can easily figure out exactly what he has to and can do to keep up his end of the bargain, such as making an introduction or opening some doors.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nGod: As mentioned by Lucifer's mother, God is capable of destroying him. Originally, Goddess was capable of annihilating Lucifer, too. Lucifer himself was afraid of facing his mother after she escaped Hell. However, with her powers severely reduced due to her similarly fallen state, she was not able to accomplish such a feat and Lucifer was initially not afraid of his mother, but as she regained her powers, Lucifer quickly became concerned, fearing as his mother's powers are returning, he and Amenadiel would soon be unable to contain her, which was proven by how Goddess was able to toss both him and Amenadiel through the room rather easily.\n\nCelestial Beings: Celestial Beings can harm one another, and Lucifer is no exception. He seems particularly susceptible to harm when fighting his fellow Archangels: Amenadiel was able to beat him to a bloody pulp when Lucifer was not resisting, and even when Lucifer was fighting back, Amenadiel was still able to deliver considerable physical damage to Lucifer. Likewise, Michael was able to physically hurt him to where he showed visible pain with his attacks. Uriel, another angel but not an Archangel, was also able to cause Lucifer pain, although he was unable to inflict noteworthy damage.\n\nDemon Daggers Forged In Hell: While Lucifer only says they can \"prick\" him in \"#TeamLucifer\", it is shown in \"Take Me Back to Hell\" that these blades can cause fatal injury to an Angel (and a Demon). Lucifer later confirms that he is no exception and that these blades can kill him too. However, they would kill him by sending him back to Hell, and he wouldn't be trapped there or permanently killed.\n\nFlaming Sword: The Blade of Death, which is also a part of the Flaming Sword, is said to be able to completely eradicate Angels. The Angel would be permanently gone, no Heaven nor Hell, and couldn't be resurrected.\n\nSelf-Actualization: At the end of season 3, it is shown that like all beings in creation, Angels are also subject to free will and self-judgment as mortals are. This manifests as psychosomatic changes in Angels, which can affect both their appearances and their powers. The changes Lucifer has exhibited through Self-Actualization are:\n\nHis devil face to appearing for the first time because he felt like he was a monster for his initial rebellion against his father and his subsequent banishment from Heaven filling him with self-hatred.\n\nBecoming vulnerable in Chloe Decker's presence as his feelings grew for her and his mental guard falling around her. He was initially invulnerable around her when they first met and was able to block several bullets in her presence.\n\nGrowing back his wings and losing the ability to transform his normal face into the devil face after saving the universe and preventing a war in Heaven by sending his mother to the Void to create her own universe, an accomplishment that made him feel great about himself and his own self worth higher than he has felt in ages. Unlike the previous time that his wings were cut off, Lucifer automatically regrew them each time that they were removed, his wings becoming impossible to remove permanently.\n\nVarious instances of his eyes flaring up red when angered and wanting to be feared.\n\nRegaining his Devil Face and his Devil Form spreading to his wings after his guilt of killing a human for the first time and his own disgust of himself making him feel like a monster.\n\nRealization of his own self hatred in a therapy session causing his Devil Form to take over his whole body with an inability to revert back and his powers of desire to strengthen and automatically activate without looking at people directly.\n\nRegaining control over his Devil Form transformation and his powers after taking steps to forgive himself.\n\nPermanently regaining the Angelic appearance of his wings after sacrificing himself to save the world from an invasion of demons and having the full acceptance and love of Chloe.\n\nHis relationship with Chloe taking the next step with sexual intimacy and his subconscious belief that relationships were about giving power up to the partner causing him to lose his Desire Mojo and seemingly give it to Chloe.\n\nRegaining his Desire Mojo and invulnerability around Chloe after realizing that relationships are about making each other stronger and that his vulnerability in her presence was caused by his own mental guard around him being down around her.\n\nHis wings refusing to come out when Lucifer isn't ready to become God yet and coming back out when he later realized that he subconsciously didn't want to be God at all.\n\nBeing vulnerable around his daughter as a sign to her how much he loves her and is willing to let his guard down around her by getting shot from a revolver.\n\nAfter Lucifer purposefully makes himself vulnerable to Rory, Linda realizes that his conscious and subconscious minds are now working together and Lucifer can control his self-actualization. This is further evidenced in the series finale; by how Lucifer was able to manifest his Angelic wings and his Devilish red eyes at the same time, which has never been seen before until then.\n\nExorcism Ritual: In season 4, Father Kinley and later the Demon Dromos reveal the existence of a ritual involving a vial of some unknown poison that would send the devil to Hell forever. The ritual also includes details in its performance such as requiring a place that served as both a den of sin and a place of worship.\n\nAurora Morningstar's Feathers: Lucifer's daughter possesses unique wings equipped with blades that can harm and kill other Celestials, including him. Some of her feathers were taken and used by Vincent Le Mec to create daggers that were able to injure her father and with which Le Mec planned to kill him.\n\nFormer Weaknesses\n\nHeaven: Since God banished Lucifer, if Lucifer ever went to Heaven and violated his banishment, he would be destroyed. This occurred when Lucifer flew to Heaven to retrieve Chloe Decker's soul and resurrect her in A Chance for a Happy Ending? Lucifer's ring containing Lilith's immortality mitigating the damage and allowed Lucifer to survive while in Heaven, but the damage drained away the immortality until only enough of it remained to be able to resurrect Chloe. Lucifer was noticeably weakened even while the ring shielded him and once it was gone, he was consumed by holy fire.\n\nPhysical Appearance\n\nIn his Human Form, Lucifer is a tall, sexy, magnetic, charismatic, devilishly-handsome, incredibly charming, dark-haired man with a model-like face and a muscular body. Lucifer often sports expensive dark suits. He also has a distinctive RP English accent, which people usually find \"very charming.\" However, no matter which visage Lucifer adopts, even his Human one, he cannot hide the visible marks on his back from where Lucifer's immense, Angelic wings used to be before they were severed. However, upon regaining his wings, the scars disappeared.\n\nLucifer's Devil appearance consists of terrifying, monstrous red skin, blazing, fiery-red eyes, gold teeth, and fingernail claws. He becomes hairless and appears to be burned and scarred, with the shape of the skull being more distinct and many scar-like markings on the forehead. It usually terrifies anyone who sees it, but it has less of an effect on those who have actually been to Hell, such as Malcolm Graham. Lucifer first gained his Devil Face because of his self-hatred, and judged himself a monster causing him to gain a horrifying and monstrous appearance. God Himself was shocked by Lucifer's Devil Face and suggested that it was how Lucifer saw himself. After feeling good about himself for the first time, he lost his \"Devil Face\" as he felt he no longer felt like a monster. He however, regained it after killing Cain. Once he killed Cain and began dating Eve, his wings took a demonic bat form.\n\nAfter coming to the realization he hated himself, Lucifer gradually started to take on his Devil form permanently. Eventually, his wings sprang out and wouldn't go back in. Much like his face, his entire body looks like charred flesh on bone, razor-sharp tip on his massive monstrous wings, and extremely loud sonic roar and voice. The very sight of this enormous, terrifying, devilish form and his king of hell voice scared a large group of demons into bowing to Lucifer's commands and immediately returning to Hell.\n\nAfter Lucifer decided to return to Hell to protect those he loved and admitted his love for Chloe and vice versa, his wings regained their angelic look. He, however, still retained his \"Devil Face\", but had control on when he used it. This also extended to his wings and his entire body to incite fear in the demons, though he's only used his Devil face for the sake of appearances.\n\nFamily\n\nTo edit this section, go to Lucifer Morningstar/Family.\n\n=\n\n=\n\nGodGoddess LindaAmenadielMichaelChloe DeckerLuciferUriel† CharlieAzraelGabrielAurora MorningstarRaphael Remiel†ZadkielHanjobadielJophielRaziel Other AngelsLezmegadielIbrielSaraqaelCastiel\n\nNotes:\n\nSolid lines denote blood relationships\n\nDashed lines denote romantic relationships\n\n† denote deceased individuals\n\nAppearances\n\nSeason One #1 \"Pilot\" Appears #2 \"Lucifer, Stay.
