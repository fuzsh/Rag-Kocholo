        "text": "Overview of Sentinel-5P Mission\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor mission is the first Copernicus mission dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere. Copernicus Sentinel-5P is the result of close collaboration between ESA, the European Commission, the Netherlands Space Office, industry, data users and scientists.\n\nThe mission consists of one satellite carrying the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument. The TROPOMI instrument was co-funded by ESA and The Netherlands.\n\nThe main objective of the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission is to perform atmospheric measurements with high spatio-temporal resolution, to be used for air quality, ozone & UV radiation, and climate monitoring & forecasting.\n\nThe satellite was successfully launched on 13 October 2017 from the Plesetsk cosmodrome in Russia.\n\nThe satellite's local time of ascending node crossing of 13.30 h has been chosen to facilitate the so-called loose formation operation with NASA's Suomi-NPP spacecraft. This concept will allow the utilization of co-located, high resolution cloud mask data provided by the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) instrument on-board Suomi-NPP during routine processing of the TROPOMI methane product.\n\nThe Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor mission reduces gaps in the availability of global atmospheric data products between SCIAMACHY/Envisat (which ended in April 2012), the OMI/AURA mission and the future Copernicus Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 missions.\n\nSatellite Description\n\nSentinel-5P is a low Earth-orbit satellite compatible with small launchers, including VEGA and ROCKOT, with ROCKOT being the selected launch vehicle. Sentinel-5P is designed for a seven year operational lifetime with 80 kg of hydrazine propellant.\n\nThe mechanical platform consists of a hexagonal structure supporting the platform electrical units and the TROPOMI Instrument Control Unit (ICU), and interfacing to a standard launch vehicle interface ring.\n\nThe main subsystems of the satellite are:\n\npropulsion subsystem (including a hydrazine tank)\n\nElectrical Power Subsystem (EPS), comprising three deployable solar arrays providing power to the spacecraft and payload\n\nThermal Control Subsystem (TCS), including heaters needed to maintain the thermal environment on the platform\n\nAttitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) composed of a three-head star tracker, GPS receivers, reaction wheels, magnetotorquers, a coarse Earth sensor and magnetometers\n\nData Handling Subsystem (DHS), comprising the on-board computer with a mass memory of 72 hours for satellite housekeeping data and command storage for at least 7 days of operation\n\nS-band communication subsystem (TT&C), providing two redundant S-band transponders for reception of telecommands and transmission of satellite housekeeping data\n\nPayload Data Handling and Transmission subsystem (PDHT), providing a mass memory capacity for storage of 'science' telemetry and two redundant X-band transmitters.\n\nTable 1: Main Satellite Platform Characteristics\n\nCommunication links:\n\nS-band TT&C with 64 Kbit/s uplink and 128 Kbit/s-1Mbit/s downlink with ranging and coherency\n\nX-band science data downlink at 310 Mbps OQPSK\n\nOrbit\n\nSentinel-5P uses a high inclination orbit (approximately 98.7Â°). The orbit inclination is the angular distance of the orbital plane from the equator.\n\nThe Sentinel-5P orbit is a near-polar, sun-synchronous orbit with an ascending node equatorial crossing at 13:30 h Mean Local Solar time. In a sun-synchronous orbit, the surface is always illuminated at the same sun angle.\n\nThe orbital cycle is 16 days (14 orbits per day, 227 orbits per cycle). The orbit cycle is the time taken for the satellite to pass over the same geographical point on the ground.\n\nThe orbit reference altitude is approximately 824 km.\n\nAn important feature of the Sentinel-5P mission is the synergistic exploitation of simultaneous measurements of imager data from the Visible/Infra-red Imager and Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), embarked on the Suomi-NPP (National Polar-orbting Partnership) satellite of NASA/NOAA (NPP mission started in 28 October 2011). Indeed, VIIRS will be able to provide co-located cloud mask data with higher spatial resolution than the cloud mask computed from the Sentinel-5P data. The Sentinel-5P orbit is selected such that it trails behind Suomi-NPP by 3.5 minutes in Local Time Ascending Node (LTAN), allowing the Sentinel-5P observation swath to remain within the scene observed by Suomi-NPP. This is shown in Figure 2.\n\nGeographical Coverage\n\nDue to its wide swath of 108Â° (approximately 2 600 km on the ground), the TROPOMI/Sentinel-5P instrument provides a full daily surface coverage of radiance and reflectance measurements for latitudes > 7Â° and < -7Â°, and better than 95 % coverage for latitudes in the interval [-7Â°, 7Â°].\n\nThe early afternoon observations of TROPOMI/Sentinel-5P (LTAN: 13h30) will have strong synergy with the morning observation of Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2/Met-OP). Although GOME-2 has a lower spatial resolution and does not have the SWIR spectral range, the combination of TROPOMI/Sentinel-5P and GOME-2/Met-OP allows observation of diurnal variations, as successfully shown with the OMI/SCIAMACHY combination.\n\nTROPOMI Instrument\n\nThe Sentinel-5P satellite carries a single payload instrument: TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument).\n\nThe TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument was co-funded by ESA and the Netherlands. Key organisations from the Netherlands include KNMI (Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute), SRON (Space Research Organization Netherlands), TNO (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research), and Airbus DS-NL, on behalf of NSO (Netherlands Space Office).\n\nKNMI and SRON are responsible for the development of the Level 1B and some Level 2 products (e.g. Methane, Nitrogen Dioxide). Airbus DS-NL was the principal contractor for instrument construction and many European industries have contributed to the subsystems. The Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA), the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) are contributing as well to the TROPOMI Level-2 product development. The operational data processing is performed at DLR (on behalf of ESA and the European Commission).\n\nThe main characteristics of TROPOMI are:\n\nType: passive grating imaging spectrometer\n\nConfiguration: Push broom staring (non-scanning) in nadir viewing\n\nSwath width: 2,600 km\n\nSpatial sampling: 7x7 km2\n\nSpectral: 4 spectrometers, each electronically split in two bands (2 in UV, 2 in VIS, 2 in NIR, 2 in SWIR)\n\nRadiometric accuracy (absolute): 1.6% (SWIR) to 1.9% (UV) of the measured earth spectral reflectance.\n\nOverall mass: 204.3 kg not including ICU (16.7 kg) that is integrated on the platform, separated from the instrument.\n\nDimensions: 1.40 x 0.65 x 0.75 m\n\nDesign lifetime: 7 years\n\nAverage power consumption: 155 W\n\nGenerated data volume: 139 Gbits per full orbit.\n\nThe Level 1B Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD), provides detailed information on the instrument and the algorithms needed to process TROPOMI Level 0 data to Level 1B.\n\nTROPOMI Response Functions (Acquisition Modes)\n\nInstrument Spectral Response Functions (ISRFs)\n\nThe zip file package contains the Instrument Spectral Response Functions (ISRF) for the UV, UVIS, NIR and SWIR detectors, derived from TROPOMI calibration measurements performed in March 2015 at CLS in Liege. Details regarding the file package content, installation as well as the data usage and limitations can be found in the ISRF readme file.\n\nPlease note that when unzipped, the entire package contains approximatively 10GB of data. The compressed zip-file is around 8GB to dowload.\n\nIn addition to the full IRSF file, a specific file for both bands 1 and 2 using the binning factor of band 1 is provided and is roughly 1GB in size.\n\nPixel Response Functions (PRFs)\n\nThe zip file package contains Pixel Response Functions (PRFs) for all pixel of the UV, UVIS, NIR and SWIR detectors of TROPOMI, derived from star stimulus Earth port geolocation calibration measurements (starEarthGeo) performed from 2015-01-10 15:33:05 until 2015-01-21 02:29:35 at CSL in Liege. For the definition of the Instrument Reference Frame (IRF) and the azimuth and elevation angles defined in this frame, the user is referred to the L01B ATBD (Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for the TROPOMI L01b Data Processor, Sections 26.1.10 and 26.1.11).\n\nDetails regarding the file package contents, installation as well as the data usage and limitations can be found in the PRF readme file.\n\nPlease note that when unzipped, the entire package contains approximatively 12GB of data.\n\nCalibration and Validation\n\nSentinel-5P Cal/Val activities are essential to the quality of the mission. Data quality is assessed through determination of the radiometric, spatial, spectral and geometric fidelity of the satellite sensor and the accuracy of geophysical products.\n\nSentinel-5P Cal/Val activities are essential to the quality of the mission. Data quality is assessed through determination of the radiometric, spatial, spectral and geometric fidelity of the satellite sensor and the accuracy of geophysical products.\n\nCalibration: calibration approach information and links to web portals used to monitor the Sentinel-5P calibration are available learn more on the calibration page.\n\nValidation: Information on the routine validation approach and links to web portals used to monitor the Sentinel-5P validation are available learn more on the validation page\n\nValidation Campaigns: Information on Sentinel-5P validation campaigns is available https://s5pcampaigns.aeronomie.be/.\n\nWhile the routine validation of atmospheric composition products is secured by operational quality control centres such as the Mission Performance Centre supported through independent validation teams, the correlative data used is usually restricted to specific products and observation techniques. These activities, therefore, do not cover insight into the instrument performance, the products quality and potential dependencies for all possible measurement scenarios. Therefore there is a need to provide additional validation of different Sentinel-5P products via dedicated validation campaigns.\n\nIn addition, and before given products are released to the user community, validation workshops are held with the aim of presenting Calibration/Validation (Cal/Val) results on those S5p products. These results are used to assess the uncertainty of the target S5p products and to decide about their release to the public. The workshops that have been held so far are:"
