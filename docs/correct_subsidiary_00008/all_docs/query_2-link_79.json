As John Paul II has said, across the centuries \"we have constantly seen the phenomenon of groups of varying sizes being spontaneously urged on to join together, driven by a mysterious prompting of the Holy Spirit, to pursue specific charitable or spiritual purposes to meet particular needs of the Church in their time and also to cooperate in her essential and permanent mission\".(1) Even a cursory glance at the history of the Church reveals the magnitude of the work performed by these associations at crucial moments in its existence, and the wealth of charisms generated in all ages by lay movements created for the renewal of the Christian life. The development of monasticism in the first millennium, and the emergence of the mendicant Orders in the 13th century stand as evidence of the work of the laity. In the 16th century, before and after the Council of Trent, in the wake of Church reform, a vast network of lay associations was created, in which a leading part was played by the Confraternities, Oratories and the Marian Congregations.\n\nThe latter half of the 19th century saw the founding of the Vincentian Conferences by Blessed Frédéric Ozanam, the Union of Catholic Apostolate by St Vincent Pallotti, educational initiatives by St John Bosco, and social work by Blessed Adolph Kolping, to mention but a few of the many society-oriented associations that were established in that period, and which were to flow into the Catholic movement of social and welfare organisations which Leo XIII did so much to encourage.\n\nIt was also in that period that Catholic Action was founded. It went on to flourish, particularly during the Pontificate of Pius XI, and from it specialised associations of Catholics emerged to address specific age groups and environments. In the first few decades of the 20th century numerous Catholic international organisations gradually spread throughout the world, covering vast areas of action — the family, the professions, education, culture, politics, the media, charitable work and human development.\n\nMore recently, giving renewed vigour to the Church’s acknowledgement of the dignity and responsibility of all Christians by virtue of their baptism, Vatican II not only gave a powerful impetus to the whole universe of lay associations, but also to the emergence of new charisms and new forms of associations going by the name of ’ecclesial movements’ and ’new communities’.(2) In Christifideles Laici, written 20 years after the Council, it is precisely this to which John Paul II was referring when he wrote that, \"the phenomenon of lay people associating among themselves has taken on a character of particular variety and vitality [heralding in] a new era of group endeavours [in which] alongside the traditional forming of associations, and at times coming from their very roots, movements and new sodalities have sprouted, with a specific feature and purpose [...] so great is the capacity of initiative and the generosity of our lay people\".(3)The Pope sees these movements as one of the most significant fruits of the new springtime of the Church that burgeoned with the Second Vatican Council, and as \"a motive of hope for the Church and for humanity\" today,(4)a work of the Spirit that makes the Church a stream of new life flowing through the history of mankind. In our increasingly secularised world, in which the faith of many is sorely tested, and is frequently stifled and dies, the movements and the new ecclesial communities, which are bearers of unexpected and powerful newness, are \"the response, given by the Holy Spirit, to this critical challenge at the end of the millennium, [a] providential response\".(5)As John Paul II sees it, the lay associations in the Church are opening up a phase that is rich in expectations and hopes.\n\nThe importance of lay associations in the mission of the Church\n\nIn the light of the Church’s renewed self-awareness as the mystery of missionary communion, Vatican II - after urging the lay faithful to remember that the individual apostolate is unique and \"admits of no substitute\" as the \"origin and condition of the whole lay apostolate\",(6) - went on to emphasise the importance of organised forms of lay apostolate(7) which are not only consistent with the social nature of the human person, but \"at the same time signify the communion and unity of the Church in Christ\".(8)Pointing out that \"the associations established for carrying on the apostolate in common sustain their members, form them for the apostolate, and... much better results can be expected than if each member were to act on his own,\" the Council went on to say that, \"in view of the progress of social institutions and the fast-moving pace of modern society, the global nature of the Church’s mission requires that apostolic enterprises of Catholics should more and more develop organised forms in the international sphere\".(9) These have to be strengthened not only because they \"can contribute in many ways to the building up of a peaceful and fraternal community of nations\", but also because they help to \"form an awareness of genuine universal solidarity and responsibility\".(10)\n\nIn the section of the Code of Canon Law dealing with associations of the faithful, a distinction is made between public associations and private associations, and conditions are laid down for their recognition or erection;(11)it confirms that \"Christ’s faithful may freely establish and direct associations which serve charitable or pious purposes or which foster the Christian vocation in the world\".(12)Here, the Code is reiterating the teaching of Vatican II, which explicitly states that, \"Maintaining the proper relationship to Church authorities, the laity have the right to found and control such associations and to join those already existing.\"(13)This right and the resultant freedom to form and join associations do not depend on the benevolence of the Pastors, but are rooted in the nature of the human person and stem from the ontological reality of the sacrament of baptism which creates a fundamental equality between all the members of the people of God as \"new creatures\" (cf 2 Cor 5:17), grafted onto Christ and animated by the Holy Spirit. It is precisely by virtue of their right as baptised Christians, that this freedom is exercised in harmony with the ecclesiology of communion referred to in Christifideles Laici, which presents the Church as an organic communion of vocations, ministries, services, charisms and responsibilities in all their diversity and complementarity.(14) And this freedom must be exercised under the paternal oversight of the Pastors, who have the responsibility of discerning charisms and recognising or erecting the associations of the faithful.\n\nOn many occasions, John Paul II made it clear that \"there is no conflict or opposition in the Church between the institutional dimension and the charismatic dimension, of which the movements are a significant expression. Both are co-essential to the divine constitution of the Church founded by Jesus, because they both help to make the mystery of Christ and his saving grace present in the world.\"(15)\n\nCharisms are gifts of the Holy Spirit to the Church to make it ever more able to perform its mission in the world, and should therefore be welcomed with gratitude, and accompanied and helped to develop.(16)The canonical recognition that they officially receive from the Church authorities confirms the validity of what they offer the faithful as a genuine means of moving forward towards the holiness of personal and community life. It is for this reason that discernment and recognition must take place in the light of the clear \"criteria of ecclesiality\" which are listed in Christifideles Laici. It might be useful to recall briefly at this point: \"the primacy given to the call of every Christian to holiness, the responsibility of professing the Catholic faith, the witness to a strong and authentic communion with the Successor of St Peter and the local Bishop, and a commitment to a presence in human society\".(17)These criteria - which \"find their verification in the actual fruits that various group forms show in their organisational life and the works they perform\",(18) - are essential guidelines for the work of discernment performed by the Pastors, and are valuable signposts to be followed by associations and movements, which are significantly urged by the Pope to set out along the path of \"ecclesial maturity\".(19)\n\nThe nature and purpose of this Directory\n\nThe Directory is a response to the invitation extended by John Paul II to the Pontifical Council for the Laity in Christifideles Laici to draw up a list of associations which have received the \"official recognition and explicit approval\" of the Holy See.(20)Considering the wealth of charisms and different forms that associations of the laity have in today’s Church, in its response to the Holy Father’s request, the Pontifical Council for the Laity worked on the idea of publishing a Directory of the international associations of the faithful, to present a general picture as comprehensively as possible, and based on the latest data at its disposal, of the phenomenon of associations throughout the vast and varied world of the Catholic laity.\n\nIt was in April 2000 that the Pontifical Council began by sending a form to all the international associations of the faithful in contact with it, to be used as the blueprint for submitting information on what they are and what they do. All the forms that were submitted, in different ways and at different times, by the associations who responded to this request were carefully examined and the information was painstakingly extracted to ensure uniformity in the way the data would be set out, but also in many cases it was necessary to ask for clarifications, explanations and missing data. Particular care has been taken to spell out the charisms at the origin of the associations listed in the Directory, always seeking to safeguard the concepts and keywords that characterise their particular experiences.\n\nThis Directory, which contains 122 associations of the faithful, is the first publication by the Pontifical Council for the Laity in which such a full and systematic treatment has been given to the associations in the contemporary lay Catholic world.(21) In view of the great variety of different types of associations, and their differing legal status and statutes, it must be borne in mind that this Directory lists associations - distinct from Institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life - that have an international spread and in which \"the Christian faithful, whether clerics, lay persons, or clerics and lay persons together, strive in a common endeavour to foster a more perfect life, to promote public worship or Christian doctrine, or to exercise other works of the apostolate such as initiatives of evangelization, works of piety or charity, and those which animate the temporal order with a Christian spirit\".(22) It also lists international associations with a particular ecumenical and/or interfaith vocation in which the Catholic component prevails. But it does not list any of the associations which, while in contact with the Pontifical Council for the Laity, are juridically dependent on other Departments of the Roman Curia (such as the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Congregation for the Clergy, the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples), and those which work exclusively in the diocesan or national environment.\n\nEach of the associations listed in this volume has a section to itself, giving its official name, any commonly used name and acronym (and whenever necessary, the name in the original language on which the acronym is based), the year of foundation, a short historical background, their identity, organisation, dissemination, works, publications, web sites and the addresses of their head offices, and their logos. Where no data has been submitted, the relevant items have been omitted. The addresses of the head offices given here are those of the members of the teams of officials who are periodically renewed; when the Directory is eventually published, some may therefore no longer be valid. In these cases, the web sites of the associations may be useful. The associations are listed in alphabetical order of their official names in English except in rare cases where translation would not be appropriate. Considering the pace at which the associations are changing and developing, this Directory will have to be periodically updated.\n\nThis Directory of the associations of the faithful is designed to be a resource on which the pastors of the Church can draw to find useful information when first coming into contact with any particular lay association, and as a practical tool to assist them in the performance of their ministry; it is also designed for the associations of the faithful themselves, as a stimulus to become better acquainted with one another in a spirit of ecclesial communion; and lastly it is for all those who wish to find out more about the world of Catholic lay associations, to study it more closely.\n\nReiterating the urgent need for a new evangelisation, John Paul II constantly referred to the role of \"forms of association, whether of the more traditional kind or the newer ecclesial movements, which continue to give the Church a vitality that is God’s gift\".(23)The Pontifical Council for the Laity is confident that the Directory will help to bear testimony to this.\n\nStanislaw Rylko\n\nTitular Archbishop of Novica\n\nPresident of the Pontifical Council for the Laity\n\n1 JOHN PAUL II, speaking to the Ecclesial Movements attending the II International Colloquium, original version in \"Insegnamenti\", X, 1 (1987), 477.\n\n2 Cf.

The members include men and women from all states of life, and from the beginning it was intended to provide a community Christian presence among young people and the poor. On 30 August 1997 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Adsis Communities as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right. IDENTITY The Adsis Communities (from the Latin verb adsum, being present) bear witness to the loving and liberating presence of God, particularly in the service of the young and the poor. Their work takes careful account of different family, social and cultural situations in which contemporary men and women live, and is strongly missionary in character; it is nurtured by an intense personal and community prayer life that is reflected in the dimension of fellowship, typical of this experience. The educational route followed by the members comprises three stages (calling, pre-catechumenate, catechumenate), focusing respectively on formation in the interior life, formation in community life, and formation in commitment. The specific areas of activity are evangelisation and education in the faith for young people, social work among the marginalised and needy, animating parishes and pastoral care centres entrusted by the Bishops to the Adsis Communities. ORGANISATION\n\nThe main organs of service and government of the Adsis Communities are the General Assembly, which meets every six years and elects the General Moderator, who is responsible for the association and represents it in dealings with the Church and the various Communities; the General Council, comprising the General Moderator and eight General Councillors; the General Conference, which is a forum for meeting, communicating, studying and adopting resolutions, which meets every six years midway between one General Assembly and the next. Membership includes Community Brothers (permanent members and catechumens); pre-catechumens, who are undergoing formation as candidates and associates, who do not live the common life and associate with a community by taking part in its work in different ways; and volunteers and cooperators.\n\nMEMBERSHIP The Adsis Communities have 1500 members, of whom 510 are Community Brothers, present in seven countries as follows: Europe (2), South America (5). WORKS The Adsis Communities manage the Catholic University of Esmeraldas (Ecuador); a Youth Ministry Department; Centres for the advancement of ethnic minorities; vocational training centres for deprived young people; counselling centres for migrants; programmes for infants, children and their families; hospitals and homes for young people; Development Cooperation programmes; cooperatives for fair trade and solidarity with Latin America and Africa.

In performing his task, Father Kentenich soon felt the need to combine the truths of the faith with the needs of the times, and for a new type of education for the young people entrusted to his care, springing from the intimate depths of man, making people free and capable of making responsible choices. The charter founding the Movement is called the Covenant of Love which Fr Kentenich and his students, on 18 October 1914, sealed with Mary and with the Blessed Trinity in the shrine chapel, of which there are 180 replicas in the world today, dedicated to the Mater ter admirabilis. It is at the shrine that the students entrust their lives to our Lady, asking her to make the Chapel a home in which to obtain the grace of welcome, the grace of interior transformation, the grace of the mission or fruitful apostolate. This experience was to become the core of the spirituality of the Movement, and the Chapel a Marian place of pilgrimage for millions of people from all over the world. The Movement was approved by the Church authorities in 1964, and today comprises 20 branches which, with different forms of commitment, gather together men, women, families, young people, priests and consecrated lay persons, in different forms of commitment. IDENTITY Faithful to the teachings of the Founder, the Apostolic Movement of Schoenstatt aims at forming personalities and Christian communities that are capable of freely supporting GodÂÂÂs plan in the world in which they live. The formation proposed by the Movement is based on self-education, faith in Providence, the pursuit of holiness in daily life, and readiness and willingness to be instruments in GodÂÂÂs hands. The particular purpose of the Movement is the spiritual renewal of Christians, which is achieved by promoting educational and religious activities and social projects, also in cooperation with other ecclesial movements. ORGANISATION The Apostolic Movement of Schoenstatt is spiritually centred on Mary, on the Founder and on the Shrine of Grace in the place where it was founded. It is institutionally subdivided into the following: PilgrimsÂÂÂ Movement, Apostolic Leagues without the obligation to live in community, Apostolic Federations (or Unions) with a nonlegal obligatory form of community, Secular Institutes, with the legal obligation to live in community, forming the core of the Movement, whose members live the evangelical counsels radically but without taking vows. All these branches are legally autonomous. The General Praesidium has a coordinating role and is made up of the leading representatives of the Institutes and Federations, as well as a representative of the Apostolic Leagues. MEMBERSHIP\n\nThe Apostolic Movement of Schoenstatt has about 96,000 members, of whom 4,400 belong to the Institutes and 2,000 to the Federations, and is present in 42 countries as follows: Africa (6), Asia (5), Europe (17), North America (5), and South America (9). About 10,000 people make a pilgrimage every day to one of the Shrines of the Movement throughout the world.\n\nWORKS The Secular Institutes of the Movement manage schools, colleges, hospitals and charitable institutions.

Together with another couple of friends who had also undergone a conversion, Bruno and France Bouchet, they set about fashioning their lives according to the life of the early Christian communities, faithful in fraternal communion and prayer, and keen to proclaim to others the gift they had received. The experience, which began in Évreux, spread to various other French dioceses and in 1984 the Community received canonical recognition from the Bishop of Bayeux-Lisieux. IDENTITY The \"Bread of Life Community\" is called to gather a people around the Blessed Sacrament, embracing all states of life and vocations (families, unmarried men and women, consecrated persons, priests and deacons) to announce and prepare the coming of the Kingdom. The formation given to the members gives emphasis to the spiritual dimension, through the daily practice of the sacraments and reading the Word of God, to the human dimension, through community life shared with the poorest, and by developing skills that can be useful in poor environments and situations of poverty. ORGANISATION The \"Bread of Life Community\" fraternity is grouped together in provinces; the provinces are grouped into regions. The General Council is at the service of communion and guides the Community. It is composed of nine members in addition to the Married Couple who carry overall responsibility. Membership of the Community comprises consecrated men and women who take a vow of poverty, chastity and obedience; companions, including companions of the future (young men and women between 18 and 25 years of age), child companions, companions of hope (disabled companions), who may be both internal and external members and renew their promise every year; anawim, who consecrate themselves to the Eucharistic Jesus on Christmas Eve; family members, who share in the life of the community as far as it is possible for them to do so. MEMBERSHIP The \"Bread of Life Community\" has several hundred members in 25 countries as follows: Africa (10), Asia (1), Europe (8), Middle East (1), North America (2), South America (2), and Oceania (1). WORKS The \"Bread of Life Community\" has set up: schools and kindergartens; hostels for the homeless; an association called Faire Route Avec Toi to support individuals or development projects; Mission Jeune, for young people wishing to share the life of the Community or to work in its missionary activities for a given period of their life; Évangile et développement, a school to prepare young people between 18 and 30 years of age to serve in the missions in developing countries. They study the social teachings of the Church, contemporary issues (peace, nonviolence, North-South relations), health and hygiene and sanitation standards, and such work as masonry, fruit and vegetable growing, animal husbandry. Every year the Community also organises summer camps in Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe for young people between 18 and 25 years of age.

A decisive role was played in its constitution by its first President, the Australian Brian Smith, and the Texan Bobbie Kavnar. On 30 November 1990 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right. IDENTITY The Catholic Fraternity is made up of Catholic Charismatic Communities, and strives to identify with the saving mission of the Church in communion with the Pope. This is pursued by encouraging member communities to remain faithful to the charisms given to them by the Spirit to build up and renew the Body of Christ, and helping them to become more keenly aware of their membership of the Catholic Church; guaranteeing that they fully comply with the teaching and the Magisterium of the Church, particularly with regard to ecclesiology, the centrality of the sacraments and devotion to our Lady and the saints; promoting initiatives and programmes for evangelisation; cooperating with other ecclesial communities and movements; working for authentic ecumenism, consistent with the guidelines of the Catholic Church. ORGANISATION The Catholic Fraternity is not a hierarchically structured ecclesial movement, but a federation of communities and associations, recognised by their local bishops, which contribute to building up the one Church of Christ, in respect for their different charisms. It has no legal authority over the member communities, but solely pastoral and spiritual responsibility towards them, in order to strengthen their Catholic identity. The representative body is the Council, made up of the delegates of the member communities, chaired by the President, meeting at least once every two years. Within the council there is the Executive, made up of two representatives from each continent and delegates of other regions or constituent parts of Catholic Fraternity. MEMBERSHIP The Catholic Fraternity comprises 51 communities and associations in 14 countries, as follows: Asia (2), Europe (6), North America (2), Oceania (1) and South America (3). WORKS The member communities of the Catholic Fraternity have established schools of theology and pastoral work; radio and television stations for evangelisation; spiritual retreat houses; educational and catechetical projects for street children; specific programmes to provide material and spiritual aid to the elderly, immigrants, the sick and the unemployed; primary and secondary schools; homes for the poor; assistance programmes for prisoners and their families; programmes to prevent abortion and assist expectant mothers, and international missions in Africa, Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Sabah, and Indonesia. The members are also committed to evangelisation programmes for young people and young adults in parishes, schools and universities.

Under the leadership of Herbert and Traudl Wallbrecher, a group of young people began to reflect on the reasons why Christians fail to oppose the emergence of ideologies and dictatorships that sow death, or to contribute to solving social injustices affecting men and women; in other words, why baptised Christians are unable to become a people whose existence and lifestyle make GodÂÂÂs project for the world visible. Communities like this would become the place in which the Christian faith is lived as history in which we can always play a part, based on the conviction that God is acting among us today as he did at the time of Abraham. In 1968 the group changed its name to \"Integrated community\", and in 1996 it was given its present name. It was approved in 1978 by the Archbishop of Paderborn and recognised that same year by the then Archbishop of Munich and Freising Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. IDENTITY In a world estranged from God and where people no longer believe in his saving presence in history, KIG sets out to retrace the biblical experience of the covenant between God and his people and to recover the substance of the Catholic faith. Its members endeavour to make the Gospel present in all the dimensions of daily life in a way that enables even the most distant to find or rediscover access to the Church. The specific dimensions of the formative process for its members are the experience of the Christian message lived in unity; theological reflection on history, on the old and the new Testaments and the history of the Church, and the proclamation of the Gospel message in contemporary society. Formation covers a period of six years, of which three are the catechumenate, in which members and associates play an active part in the life of the Community. The preferred spheres of action are the world of labour, education, politics, healthcare, art, crafts, and missionary commitment. KIG is subject to the authority of the local churches in whose parishes it operates. Individual Communities are erected at the diocesan level and taken together they constitute the Confederation of Catholic Integrated Communities. In the pursuit of its objectives, KIG co-operates with the Community of priests and the Community of unmarried women and unmarried men that place themselves at its service. ORGANISATION\n\nMembership of KIG is open to members, co-workers, aspirants and friends. Each Community elects a Management Council which coordinates and is responsible for the life and for the pursuit of the objectives of the Community. Each Community is under the spiritual direction of a diocesan priest who is a member of the Community of priests at the service of the Catholic Integration Communities, appointed by agreement with the local bishop.\n\nMEMBERSHIP KIG currently has about 1000 members in 7 countries as follows: Africa (1), Asia (1), Europe (4), and North America (1). WORKS Members or groups of members of KIG have taken the initiative under their own personal responsibility to set up Catholic schools, a small clinic and nursing activities. In 2003, KIG inaugurated The Academy for the Theology of the People of God at Villa Cavalletti (Grottaferrata, Rome).

In November 1950, Mgr Frans op de Coul, the head of the Netherlands Catholic Office for Teaching and Education at the time, convened the representatives of the Catholic teaching organisations from six countries in order to establish an operational and liaison Secretariat to strengthen the union between individuals and organisations responsible for Catholic education worldwide. The project took legal shape in 1952 and was recognised by the Holy See in 1956 as a Catholic International Organisation. OIEC is an NGO with consultative status at Ecosoc, UNICEF, the Council of Europe, and has cooperation relations with FAO and the ILO.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nOIEC participates in the mission of the Church by promoting a Catholic-inspired educational project, demonstrating within the community of nations the will of the Church to cooperate in every aspect of education; it encourages research into and the study of the specific contribution made by the Catholic school to education, and the ways in which it can meet the needs and the demands of different social and cultural environments; it defends the freedom of education, and it works to ensure that freedom is effectively exercised; it ensures that Catholic education is adequately represented on international bodies. In the pursuit of its objectives, OIEC cooperates with the agencies of the universal Church, the BishopsÂÂÂ Conferences and other Catholic International Organisations involved in education.\n\nORGANISATION The supreme governing body of OIEC is the General Assembly which meets every three years, attended by the constituent and the associate members. It elects the Council, which is responsible for implementing the decisions of the Assembly. The permanent executive body is the General Secretariat. At the international level its activities are co-ordinated by five Regional Secretariats for Africa, Asia, America, Europe, and the Near and Middle East. OIEC members are constituent members, which are organisations recognised as de jure and de facto representatives of Catholic education in different countries; associate members, which are international Religious Congregations engaged in teaching; cooperating members, which are Religious Congregations but without an international spread, and individuals wishing to actively cooperate with the OIEC; and corresponding members. MEMBERSHIP\n\nOIEC has 100 constituent members, 17 associate members, 10 cooperating members, and 7 corresponding members, and is present in 103 countries as follows: Africa (37), Asia (11), Europe (23), Middle East (4), North America (13), Oceania (2), and South America (13).\n\nWORKS\n\nOIEC promotes and supports primary and secondary literacy projects to combat illiteracy and the dropping out of compulsory schooling, a problem which affects 100 million children in the world according to Unesco; family literacy projects; sharing and peace education programmes. At the present time it is engaged in a detailed survey of the state of Catholic schools throughout the world with the aim of renewal. This will demand the creativity of everyone involved (teachers, former pupils and students, parents).\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nDe la réflexion à lÂÂÂaction series; Cahiers O.I.E.C.; Newsletter.

The Community was recognised that same year by the Archbishop of Lyon, who erected it in 1984 as an association of the faithful. In 1992 the Institut Religieux Clérical de Droit Diocésain was founded in Lyon to take in young people undergoing formation and priests from the Community.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nCCN is a Catholic community with an ecumenical vocation which is also open to the faithful from other Churches. It comprises married couples, families, consecrated women and men, priests, who have decided to bear witness together (Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox) to their faith in Jesus Christ, and to work for Christian Unity. The Community is also committed to the instruction of baptised Christians by organising and animating Cana meetings for married couples and families, spiritual retreats, weekend instruction meetings for young people, and training courses for lay people varying from three to 12 months. The spirituality of CCN is imbued with the teachings of St Ignatius Loyola and St Teresa of Avila, and is based on the experience of Charismatic Renewal.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe members of CCN live in neighbourhood fraternities (living in the same neighbourhood) and in life fraternities (living under the same roof). Most of them work in their professions or occupations, while others place themselves full-time at the service of the Church. The Community lives on its work to meet its daily needs and relies on Providence for everything that is needed in order to perform GodÂÂÂs plan in the mission. After three years of discernment, the members opt either for a renewable three-year commitment or for a permanent commitment within the Community, which can only be done after renewing the three-year commitment twice more.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nCCN has about a thousand members in 20 countries as follows: Africa (6), Europe (9), Middle East (2), North America (2), and South America (1). Communion du Chemin Neuf revolves around the Community, as an apostolic body comprising over 6,000 people who are committed to supporting the missions.\n\nWORKS\n\nCCN has set up hostels for students and young workers, a dispensary, outpatient units in Africa, and a religious bookshop. The Community has also been entrusted with numerous parishes (to which it sends priests, families, and consecrated people), and hospital chaplaincies.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nTychique, a two-monthly formation magazine for prayer groups.\n\nWEB SITE\n\nhttp://www.chemin-neuf.org\n\nHEADQUARTERS Communauté Chemin Neuf\n\nAbbaye dÂÂÂHautecombe\n\n73310 Saint Pierre de Curtille - France\n\nTel.

In 1584, Gregory XIII approved the first congregation in his Bull Omnipotentis Dei, and in 1587 Sixtus V issued his Bull Superna dispositione authorising the institution of other congregations affiliated to the original one and open to everyone. The serious crisis from which the Society of Jesus suffered in the 18th century, leading in 1773 to its suppression by Clement XIV, weakened the congregations which became a mass movement that was quite different from what the Founder had originally intended. It was not until 1948, following the publication of the Apostolic Constitution Bis saeculari in which Pope Pius XII laid down guidelines for the lay apostolate, that the need was felt to renew the Marian Congregations - or Sodalities as they are called in some countries - and to group them together into an international Federation. In 1952 the World Federation of the Marian Congregations was established, and after changing its name to the World Federation of the Christian Life Communities it was recognised by the Holy See in 1971 as a Catholic International Organisation. Its present name dates back to 1979. CVX is a member of the Conference of ICOs and as an NGO it has consultative status with Ecosoc and Unicef. On 3 December 1990, the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed the Christian Life Community to be an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY CVX is made up of Christians - men and women, young people and adults of every social condition - who wish to follow Jesus Christ and cooperate in building up the Kingdom, bearing witness to their faith in every area of life, committed to taking the teachings of the Church into the heart of human culture to build up a more just and more fraternal society. Membership of CVX comes as a response to a personal vocation, and is preceded by a period of formation and temporary commitment. Its educational method, centred on Christ and participation in the Paschal mystery, is based on Holy Scripture, the liturgy, study of the Magisterium of the Church, reading the will of God in the events of history and in the signs of the times. The source and the instrument of CVX spirituality are the Exercises of St Ignatius Loyola. A central position is given to our Lady in the life of the Community, for her cooperation in the work of Redemption is the supreme model for the members on which to base their own cooperation with ChristÂÂÂs mission. ORGANISATION\n\nCVX is governed by the General Assembly, made up of the Executive Council and the delegates of the national communities. The Executive Council, which is responsible for implementing the decisions and policies adopted by the General Assembly, comprises the President, the Vice President, the Secretary, the Treasurer, Ecclesiastical Assistant, the deputy Ecclesiastical Assistant and three Council members. Similar management bodies exist at the national level. Other associations of people wishing to share its lifestyle, without being full members, may also be affiliated to the CVX.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nCVX has about 123,000 members in 52 countries as follows: Africa (9), Asia (12), Europe (16), North America (2), and South America (13).\n\nWORKS\n\nCVX, whose members take part in the activities promoted worldwide by the Society of Jesus, manages schools in Chile and Hong Kong, spiritual retreat houses in France and various kinds of institutions in the Philippines and in Chile.\n\nPUBLICATIONS Progressio, the half yearly magazine; Projects, a quarterly newsletter.

Recognised by the Peruvian BishopsÂÂÂ Conference as a national association in 1990, the Movement gradually spread to other countries of Latin America. On 23 March 1994 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Movimiento de Vida Cristiana as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nCLM aims to be a community forum for encountering the Lord Jesus Christ, which fosters an authentic Christian life by announcing and bearing witness to the faith and the comprehensive advancement of the human person in the light of the Gospel and the Magisterium of the Church. Its members, men and women of different states of life, place the pursuit of holiness, apostolic commitment and service to God and our fellow men and women, at the heart of their life experience. The priority areas for its work are evangelisation of young people; commitment to solidarity with the poor, the sick and the elderly and abandoned children; the evangelisation of culture; the protection of the family and the defence of life from conception to natural death; the mass media and the new communications technologies. The spirituality of CLM, which offers its members a personal and community-based process of ongoing formation, is characterised by devotion to the Immaculate Conception, an intense participation in liturgical life, meditation on the Word of God as the light to direct their lives and as the key to a critical reading of human projects.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe members of CLM commit themselves to its apostolic mission on a personal or community basis, creating communities, groups, institutions, associations and services of various kinds and with different purposes (including: University Coordination, Solidarity on the Way, The Family of Nazareth, Missionary Action, Cyberapostolate, Siloé, Pro Vita). This work is headed by a General Coordination Council made up of the General Coordinator, the Spiritual Assistant and the Executive Secretary.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nCLM has a membership of about 25,000 in 21 countries as follows: Asia (1), Europe (5), North America (6), and South America (9).\n\nWORKS\n\nCLM belongs to the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae family, which founded a publishing company, the Life and Spirituality Institute, the San Pablo de Arequipa University, a number of schools, a health care facility and a \"life help\" centre.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nNueva Alborada, an annual magazine; Vida Cristiana, a fortnightly newsletter; Noticias eclesiales, an online newsletter.\n\nWEB SITE http://www.m-v-c.org.

Encouraged by Cardinal Achille Liénart, the Archbishop of Lille, in 1946 she opened the first hostel at Roubaix, which was followed over the years by others in France, and then in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The association was officially founded in 1975. On 13 May 1993, the Pontifical Council for the Laity issued a decree recognising Claire Amitié as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right. IDENTITY Claire Amitié retrieves girls and young women from troubled and marginalised backgrounds. Living in small communities of animators they receive all-round preparation which helps them to recover their personal equilibrium, and an education to enable them to fit into the working world. The \"Clair Logis\" Centres are normally opened in response to requests from the bishops. The young guests come from different cultural and religious traditions, and they have what is often their very first experience of family life and of the fraternal love given and received that alone makes it possible to move forward towards the one and triune God. In the course of carrying out their mission, the members of Claire Amitié have regular contact with the Church authorities and cooperate with the parish communities, movements and other groups present in the dioceses in which the homes are situated. The animators are trained for five years, with a six-month probation period. Because of their specific mission, they are also given ongoing training in the human, spiritual, doctrinal, missionary, educational and professional dimensions. ORGANISATION\n\nClaire Amitié is headed by a President and Director-General assisted by her Council. The association has permanent members and associate members. Permanent members are the lay animators who have been called by God to live a life of virginity in a community, to pray and to be at the service of the human, spiritual and Christian advancement of the most disadvantaged girls and young women. The associate members are married and unmarried men and women who share the spirit and the purposes of the association, its love for the poor, its ecclesial and universal dimension, and who contribute to the management of supporting associations, to the girlsÂÂÂ education, and to life in the homes.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nClaire Amitié has 277 permanent and associate members, in 7 countries as follows: Africa (4), Asia (1), Europe (1), and South America (1).\n\nWORKS\n\nFifteen \"Clair Logis\" homes have been opened at the initiative of Claire Amitié, managed in conjunction with eight supporting associations.\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nParfum dÂÂÂIci et dÂÂÂAilleurs, a monthly bulletin.\n\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nClaire Amitié\n\n59, rue de lÂÂÂOurcq - 75019 Paris - France\n\nTel.

In 1975 the Community transferred to Cordes. It was recognised as a Pious Union in 1979 and became an association of the faithful of diocesan right in 1985 with the approval of its statutes ad experimentum by the Archbishop of Albi. In 1991, in order to make more explicit the openness of the Community to the poor, the leaders decided to adopt the present name which was easier to take to the cultures in the various countries in the world in which the association was by then present. The association is a member of the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships (see page 27). On 8 December 2002, the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Communauté des Béatitudes as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nThe Community of the Beatitudes gathers faithful from all states of life (married or unmarried lay people, seminarians, priests, permanent deacons, men and women consecrated in celibacy) who wish to conform as closely as possible to the model of the early Christian community through the common life, the sharing of goods, voluntary poverty and an intense sacramental and liturgical life. The members of the Community, which has a contemplative vocation based on Carmelite spirituality, are actively engaged in the service of the poor and the proclamation of the Gospel. Formation begins with an introduction to community life and to the spirit and the rule of the Community, and comprises common doctrinal, spiritual, human and professional training during the period of the Postulancy and the temporary commitment, which is a period for discerning the vocation and strengthening the unity of the community; specific formation for every state of life, preceding the principal stages marking the membersÂÂÂ commitment within the community, and designed to help the members live their vocation to the full and across time; ongoing formation follows for all, including the study of the liturgy, iconography, Holy Scripture, Hebrew and the Jewish roots of Christianity, modern languages, and evangelisation methods.\n\nORGANISATION The Community of the Beatitudes, headed by an elected General Moderator assisted by a Council, comprises houses, grouped into provinces. The Community is open to the faithful from all states of life who fully assume this vocation. They include married people with their children, single people, consecrated laypersons who live in chastity for the sake of the Kingdom, priests, and permanent deacons, single or married. Others who form part of the Community are the associates who live permanently in the Community house sharing in its life and forming an integral part of the \"family\" without taking on the whole of the community vocation; Friends of the Lamb, faithful of all states of life wishing to share the spirituality of the Community, living fully within the world and placing fidelity to the Gospel, prayer and service at the heart of their existence, and maintaining reference to a house of the Community with which they establish bonds of spiritual communion and fraternal assistance; members of the Beatitudes of the Holy Family, for families or unmarried people living near a house of the Community with which they establish close links and work with them in their apostolic activities, wishing to undertake a commitment in the spirit of the Community of the Beatitudes. MEMBERSHIP\n\nThe Community of the Beatitudes has about 1500 members and is present in 29 countries as follows: Africa (6), Asia (4), Europe (11), Middle East (2), North America (3), South America (1), and Oceania (2).\n\nWORKS The Community of the Beatitudes has given rise to the Alliance de la Charité, a non-governmental organisation to help the churches in the developing countries and the missions; a hospital in Kabinda, Congo; orphanages in Congo and Gabon; Mère de Miséricorde, which works to defend life; the Fraternités Saint Camille, which are diocesan Centres that welcome people and lend a listening ear; a publishing house and radio station; Oeuvre Saint Bernard, to develop sacred art and Christian-inspired works of art; inter-diocesan seminaries in Côte dÂÂÂIvoire and Congo; rural education centres, and homes to recuperate street children in the Central African Republic; the Soleil de Justice Association, for African Christian politicians.

After the end of the League of Nations, in 1951 the United Nations began to take shape and a new international scenario developed; the Conference was created as an association with legal personality, with its present name. The CICO was given official Holy See approval in 1953 on the occasion of the first General Assembly in Rome. In 1997 the Quito General Assembly officially adopted the Conference Charter setting out the nature and the purposes of the CICO, and membership eligibility requirements. IDENTITY\n\nCICO is a forum for reflection, dialogue and concerted action by the international organisations of the laity recognised by the Holy See, which are committed to making their own contribution to international initiatives to respond to the challenges presented by the contemporary political, economic, social, cultural and religious environment. Sharing the concern to live their faith in Jesus Christ to the full, the member organisations of the Conference are a Christian presence in the world that involves serving the comprehensive development of all humanity; interfaith listening and dialogue; giving priority, in the light of the Gospel, to commitment for and with the poorest, for peace, fellowship and justice, for the respect, defence and promotion of the rights and dignity of the human person, and the safeguarding of Creation.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe life of the Conference is driven by the General Assembly which is held every two years, and attended by the member organisations with voting rights, associate organisations and guest organisations. In recent years the General Assemblies have been held in conjunction with workshops or colloquiums to examine specific issues. Every two years, the General Assembly elects the ICO which will serve as the Presidency, and every four years it elects the eight ICOs making up the Coordination Committee, and the Director. The Ecclesiastical Assistant attends the General Assembly and the Coordination Committee ex officio but in an advisory capacity. The Coordination Committee meets three times a year, and may elect an Executive Committee comprising the CICO President and one or two Vice Presidents chosen from among the membership, and the Ecclesiastical Assistant. The conference may also introduce other bodies to help with its work (working groups with specific remits and for a limited period, specialised commissions) or encourage the establishment of platforms of ICOs on an issue of common concern or a given objective. To guarantee continuity to the work of these groups, commissions and platforms, some members of the Coordination Committee work are appointed on a rotation basis. Both the Coordination Committee and any other bodies set up within the CICO can organise seminars or colloquiums on priority issues decided by the General Assembly.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nCICO now has 37 member organisations, 4 associated organisations, and 3 invited organisations. International Catholic Organisations, with their local branches, are present in more than 150 countries covering every continent.\n\nWEB SITE http://www.oic-ico.org HEADQUARTERS Conférence des OIC\n\n37/39 rue de Vermont - 1202 Genève - Switzerland\n\nTel. and Fax [+41]227338392\n\nEmail: coic@pophost.eunet.be LOGO\n\nOFFICIAL NAME\n\nCOUPLES FOR CHRIST\n\nACRONYM CFC ESTABLISHED 1981 HISTORY\n\nThe Couples for Christ Association was established in Manila, Philippines, by 16 married couples belonging to a Catholic Charismatic Renewal prayer group. It works for Christian couples wishing to deepen their faith by helping one another to revive their relationship with our Lord and to allow themselves to be renewed by the power of the Holy Spirit. Within a few years, the association was recognised by the Philippines Bishops’ Conference, and its new approach to evangelisation spread in the parishes as a programme for the renewal of family life. On 11 March 2000 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of Couples for Christ as an international association of the faithful.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nCFC is made up of families who have taken up Christ’s exhortation to be leaven and light in the world, and to spread the Good News of the liberation of humanity. Through their commitment to the Church’s evangelising work, promoting peace and justice, defending the poor and the oppressed, and promoting the unity of Christians, they cooperate with the work of the Holy Spirit who gives life to a new humanity. Membership of CFC entails acceptance of the Christian Life Programme, of a programme of instruction designed to impart to all the members of the association the essentials of the faith, helping them to rediscover the sense of their vocation to marriage and to renew their faithfulness to God every day, to their vows which bind them as husband and wife, and to their commitment to support one another. CFC pursues its objectives through family pastoral programmes aimed at making the family a \"domestic Church\", and through pastoral programmes attentive to the needs of the poor.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nCFC is governed by the International Council, with its headquarters at Manila, under which there are the National Councils. Under the National Councils can be Regional Councils, and under these the sectors, and under these the chapters, which are the grass roots units of CFC. Non-Catholic Christians may also become aggregate members of the association.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nCFC has some 700,000 members across all ministries (Singles for Christ, Youth for Christ, Kids for Christ, Handmaids of the Lord and Servants of the Lord), and is present in 127 countries as follows: Africa and Middle East (30), Asia (37), Europe (20), North America (2), Oceania (17)South America and Caribbean (21).\n\nPUBLICATIONS\n\nIn His Steps, a quarterly publication of Biblical reflection; Ugnayan, a monthly supplement in the CBCP Monitor, the official publication of the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines; Family Time, a magazine which features articles on family, parenting.\n\nWEB SITE https://www.couplesforchristglobal.org HEADQUARTERS\n\nCouples for Christ Global Mission Center\n\n156 20th Avenue, Bgy.

It was originally only for lay people, both single and married, but today its membership includes priests and consecrated lay persons who have matured their vocation through their experience within the Community. In 1975, the establishment of the Community at Paray-le-Monial, where the apparitions of the Sacred Heart took place, marked a major milestone in its history and the beginning of its spread worldwide. Since the 1990s an increasing number of bishops have been entrusting parish missions and parish animation to the Community, turning them into real centres of fraternal life and evangelisation. The association is a member of the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships (see page 27). On December 1992 the Pontifical Council for the Laity issued a decree recognising the Communauté de lÂÂÂEmmanuel as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nThe Emmanuel Community is named after the passage from Scripture, \"Behold, a young woman shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel\" (Is 7: 14; cf. Mt 1: 23), and its members are people who are called by God to live together to serve and proclaim Jesus Christ. The core of the Community is the Jesus Fraternity, which is made up of members who give themselves to the Lord in consecration and total devotion to the mission. The life of the Community and its members, who are worshippers living in the heart of the world, revolves around the Eucharist. This roots all their actions in contemplation and opens them up to the compassion of Christ and so leads them to place themselves at the service of the poor, the sick, the lonely and the marginalised; and at the service of evangelisation, to announce the risen Christ to all people who are suffering because they do not know God and do not know that they are loved by God. The preparation offered to the members of the Community who are called to be missionaries, primarily in their own environment, gives priority to the spiritual dimension and formation for community life and evangelisation.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe Emmanuel Community is governed by a Moderator, assisted by an International Council whose members are elected for a three-year term, which may be renewed for a maximum of two consecutive terms, from among the members of the Community and the consecrated members of the Jesus Fraternity. Before a person enters the Community there is a probationary period (postulancy and noviciate) for about two years. Once these stages have been completed the members renew their commitment every year. The members of the Jesus Fraternity are consecrated for life. People supporting the Community with their prayers, cooperation and financial assistance are members of the Emmanuel Family.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nThe Emmanuel Community has about 6,000 members (including 130 priests, 180 consecrated sisters and 15 consecrated brothers) in 50 countries as follows: Africa (18), Asia (6), Europe (17), Middle East (1), North America (4), Oceania (1), and South America (3). 200,000 people regularly take part in its work.\n\nWORKS The Community also created the following: Emmanuel Youth, for the apostolate among young people; Love and Truth, for the apostolate among families, engaged couples and lone parents; Presence and Witness, for the apostolate among people committed in various spheres of social life; Fidesco, for the mission ad gentes and to support development projects; Magnificat, for the apostolate in the world of culture and the arts; SOS Prayer (a 24-hour telephone listening and prayer service); Tiberiade, to care for AIDS sufferers and their families; schools of evangelisation in France, Germany and Italy; the \"Emmanuel\" and \"Merciful Jesus\" Centres in Rwanda (retreats, adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, reconciliation, peace education); hostels for students; hostels in France, Germany and Portugal; prayer groups worldwide; the publisher, Les Editions de lÂÂÂEmmanuel. The Community also runs pilgrimages to Paray-le-Monial and summer religious education sessions attended by 20,000 people every year. PUBLICATIONS He is Alive! - monthly magazine.

He collaborated with them in organising the meeting which was held, as an experimental measure, at Laski (Warsaw) in 1977. The first community of the movement was set up at the second meeting at Pewel near Żywiec in January 1978. In the years that followed the experience spread, adapting to local conditions, to various other Central and Eastern European countries. In 1996 the Delegate of the Polish BishopsÂÂÂ Conference for Catholic movements, Monsignor Mieczyław Cisło, approved the first statutes of the movement. On 15 August 2004 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of Encounters of Married Couples to be an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nDialogues set out to revive the unity of the couple and their relationship with God on the one hand, showing that the grace of the sacrament of marriage does not finish with its celebration but accompanies the couple throughout the whole of their lives, and on the other hand working to build up the family at all times as the domestic Church. The work of the movement takes the form of \"grassroots retreats\", lasting three days, led by three married couples and a priest. In the course of the retreats the couples are encouraged to adopt a fresh approach to dialogue with each other, based on the teaching of the Church which emphasises the dimension of the family as a community of persons animated by mutual love. Attending retreats, which are open to married couples of all ages, whether or not they are involved in the life of the Church, often heals critical situations and helps many to undertake or to resume the path of faith. The movement not only organises retreats for married couples but also for divorcees, couples waiting to adopt babies, and engaged couples. Special programmes are also drawn up for priests, consecrated people and seminarians. The training of leader couples, who have a specific vocation to work in this field together with priests and experts in the psychology of interpersonal communication, is based on the study of the Magisterium of the Church regarding marriage and the family.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe movement is structured into Diocesan Centres, comprising at least three couples of married animators and a priest, each led by a Council. All the diocesan Centres of a given country constitute the National Centre, run by a National Council. The leader couples in all the countries meet every two years to pray together, update and exchange their experiences. At the international level, Dialogues is managed by an International Council, as the symbol of the movementÂÂÂs unity. Its members are elected at the international meetings of community leaders held every two years. The composition of the Councils, made up of 6/8 people including the President, the Vice-President and Treasurer, is identical at all levels.\n\nMEMBERSHIP The movement is present in seven countries in Eastern and Central Europe.

In response to the appeal to follow young people with care and concern, launched by Paul VI in 1968 when he inaugurated the second Celam General Conference, the new movement drafted the so-called \"Medellín Document\" which is still considered to be the EYP Magna Charta. It spread beyond the borders of Colombia and within 30 years it was found in various other American and European countries. On 29 June 1996 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed the recognition of Encuentros de Promoción Juvenil as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nEYP sets out to stimulate young people to live their vocation to the full in accordance with the charism of the movement, to encourage them to freely accept the faith and prepare them to take on leadership roles of Christian groups and communities and to play a front-line role in the work of building up the civilisation of love. The movementÂÂÂs educational approach emphasises human and spiritual development, group work and community prayer, attendance at Mass, times of reflection and the sharing of experiences. EYP places itself at the service of the pastoral ministry of youth through announcing and bearing witness to Christ, rallying young people around the fundamental values of Christianity and helping them to mature in the faith. The main activity of the movement is to organise meetings, which take the form of three-day community events for young people aged 18 years and above, at the time in which they have to make crucial choices for their lives, and therefore need guidance and direction.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nEYP is governed by the International Promotor Committee, comprising the International Coordinator, The International Spiritual Assistant, the Deputy International Coordinator, the Deputy Spiritual Assistant, the Regional Spiritual Assistants and Coordinators, and the National Spiritual Assistants and Coordinators. The movement is organised by the Standing Committee, comprising the International coordinator, the International Spiritual Assistant, the Regional Coordinators and the Regional Spiritual Assistants.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nEYP has a membership of about 3,500 present in 14 countries as follows: Europe (2), North America (8), and South America (4). The meetings organised by the movement are attended every year by over 7,000 young people.\n\nWEB SITE http://www.ilac.co.cr/EPJ HEADQUARTERS Encuentros de Promoción Juvenil\n\nCalle Hermengildo Peña, 9\n\nColonia Hacienda de la Flor\n\n83090 Hermosillo, Sonora - Mexico\n\nTel.

CHRISTIANS FOR THE WORLD\n\nALSO KNOWN AS Fondacio ESTABLISHED 1974 HISTORY\n\nFondacio was established in France under the name of Christian Formation Community, in the wake of Catholic Charismatic Renewal and at the initiative of Jean-Michel Rousseau, a young married layman. It was originally intended to provide Christian instruction for young adults, but from 1980, with the admission of people with social responsibilities and lay persons engaged in parish activities, it decided to broaden its sphere of activity and to become international in character. It was in those years that the new name was adopted, Foundations for a New World. In 1991, following a serious internal crisis, Rousseau and some of the membership quit the association. Many others were convinced that it was a work of God, and under the guidance of Gérard Testard they revived it with a more collegiate government. The Foundations were given recognition as an association of diocesan right by the Bishop of Versailles in 1995, the Archbishop of Santiago de Chile in 1996, and by the Archbishop of Brussels in 1998. Fondacio. Chrétiens pour le monde, the present name which it adopted in 2002, is a member of the Catholic Fraternity of Charismatic Covenant Communities and Fellowships (see page 27).\n\nIDENTITY\n\nFondacio is a Catholic association with an ecumenical dimension, bringing together members of the laity, married and unmarried, who are committed to a pathway of personal growth and conversion giving pride of place to their relationship with God, human and spiritual development, and community life. Its missionary work, which aims at evangelising men and women of our age, revolves around five focal points: young people, to whom the association offers the experience of GodÂÂÂs unconditional love; couples and families, with guidance for deepening their faith in order to discover the presence of God at the centre of their lives; seniors and older people, whom it invites to share their experience and their wisdom; people with social, political, entrepreneurial, and educational responsibilities, whom it helps to combine their professional commitments and their family, personal and spiritual life; forms of affective, psychological, spiritual and material poverty, with reference to the words of St James, \"Faith without works is dead\" (Jas 2: 26).\n\nORGANISATION\n\nFondacio is headed by a President elected by the International Congress, which convenes the delegates of the countries in which the association is present every four years, to lay down its guidelines for action. The decisions of the Congress are implemented by an International Council, which expresses the unity of all the component parts of Fondacio. The national branches are autonomous in the way they operate and in their missionary choices, and are each headed by a Council and by a Pastoral Assembly. There are fellowship members who wish to experience a living relationship with God and form small groups, through which they take part in the associationÂÂÂs missionary activities; community members, who wish to learn more about the faith and to strengthen their membership of the association, concluding a covenant with God and their fellows, and committing themselves to implementing specific missionary projects; permanent members, who respond to their calling to follow the school of Christ by placing all their energies and skills at the service of the mission for one or more years; members committed for life, who after a period of at least seven yearsÂÂÂ membership of the association fully take on its spirituality, living a radical Gospel life in key areas of human existence.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nFondacio has about 3000 members in 20 countries, as follows: Africa (7), Asia, (4), Europe (5), Middle East (1), North America (1), and South America (2).\n\nWORKS\n\nFondacio performs its specific vocation of announcing the Good News through evangelisation projects and initiatives to support development in parts of the world afflicted by poverty, where the association has created activities to restore more humane living conditions and the dignity of children of God to the poor: homes for reintegration into society, dispensaries, schools, and vocational training centres. It has also established CIRFA (Centre International de Recherche et de Formation Appliqueés), which has two departments: the Faith and Commitment Institute, which provides instruction for those who wish to place themselves at the service of the Church, and the École Orientation Projet Engagement, which prepares people to serve in the world and provides training for humanitarian project leaders; and PNE (Partager Notre Espérance), an ecumenical group for parish evangelisation work.\n\nWEB SITE http://www.fondacio.org HEADQUARTERS\n\nFondacio.

Marthe Robin, who had been ill from the age of 16, offered herself to the will of God in total abandon, entrusting herself to Mary. From 1930 she prayed ceaselessly to have a Catholic school in her native town of Châteauneuf-de-Galaure, and this was followed in 1940-1948 by the foundation of the Foyer of Light, Charity and Love - a centre for spiritual retreats, open to all, and the first of the numerous Foyers de Charité that spread from France to all continents. On 1 November 1986 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Foyers de Charité as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nThe members of the Foyers de Charité are lay men and women and priests who are called to live according to the spirit of the Beatitudes at the service of evangelisation, and work with the whole of the Church to reveal Christ, the light of the world, and his message of salvation. In the spirit of the Beatitudes they also place their material, intellectual and spiritual goods in common. The educational process of the members is designed to prepare them for the mission and to make them responsible for theunity and the dynamism of the association. Formation is provided within the community, with personalmeetings with the leaders (priests and laity), community meetings, courses of study of Holy Scripture, theology, liturgy, catechesis and liturgical animation. Among the formation activities, spiritual retreats open to all play an important part, as a synthesis of Christian life and faith in fidelity to the Word of God and the Magisterium of the Church. Retreats, animated by the laity, are led by the priest responsible for the Foyer. At the Châteauneuf-de-Galaure Foyer a onemonth formation course is held every year to enhance familiarity with the association, its charism and the way it operates.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe core of the association and focus of communion and cooperation between all the Foyers de Charité in the world, is the Foyer at Châteauneuf-de-Galaure, Foyer Centre. The priest-in-charge is also responsible for all the Foyers worldwide. Every Foyer de Charité - life community - comprises a priest and lay members, living in communion with the universal Church incorporated into the diocesan Church. The members of all the Foyers meet every year in a family spirit to share their experiences and jointly draft projects for expanding the association. The General Assembly is convened every five years by the priest in charge of the Foyer-Centre, elects one half of the members of the Central Council and decides on the most important spiritual and apostolic guidelines of the association. The life of the Foyers de Charité is supported by a network of friends creating the socalled \"Enlarged Foyer\" made up of the members of the Foyers and those taking part in the spiritual retreats, which testify to the light, charity and love of Christ throughout the world.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nThe association has 75 Foyers and is present in 41 countries as follows: Africa (17), Asia (5), Europe (7), Middle East (1), North America (5), and South America (6).\n\nWORKS Foyers de Charité run homes to take in children in difficulty or with disabilities and for abandoned babies, schools, homes for the elderly, a diocesan spiritual centre, dispensaries, printing shop, local religious radio stations, and canteens for the poor.

It is one of the branches of the spiritual Family that arose from the charism of Charles de Foucauld, centring on Jesus, his \"beloved Brother\", and on three aspects of our LordÂÂÂs life: his hidden life in Nazareth, his stay in the wilderness, and his three-year ministry. Recognised at diocesan level in 1991, in 1992 FCF became a member of the General Association grouping together the Charles de Foucauld Fraternities which draw on his teachings in order to update them so that they meet the demands of the age, harmonising contemplative life with missionary activity extended to the poorest sections of society. On 1 December 1998 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Fraternité Charles de Foucauld as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nFCF is an association of lay women wishing to live in virginity according to the charism of Charles de Foucauld, as a vocation and as a state of life taken on and offered. Incorporated into the local Church, they are committed to discerning GodÂÂÂs plan in events and in history, and to deepening GodÂÂÂs project in their lives; living in the world following the example of the Family of Nazareth; adopting a simple way of life in solidarity with the poor, and meditating assiduously on Holy Scripture, and in particular on the Gospel.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe fundamental cells of the FCF are the \"base fraternities\", small groups of six and seven members. The base fraternities in one country or group of countries make up regions animated by regional teams. The International Team is elected by the international General Assembly, and comprises the international \"Responsible\" and representatives of each continent. Its task is to safeguard fidelity to the charism of Charles de Foucauld, promote communion within the Fraternity, and to implement the guidelines laid down by the International General Assembly, the decisionmaking and supreme governing body of FCF composed of the outgoing International Team, the delegates elected by the grassroots, and the members of the new International Team.\n\nMEMBERSHIP FCF has about 360 members, in 25 countries as follows: Africa (2), Europe (12), North America (3) and South America (8).

The experience of a small group of students from the Berchet classical high school in Milan, which gathered around him, led to the establishment of Gioventù Studentesca (Student Youth). With the strong encouragement of the Archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, Gioventù Studentesca spread to other Italian cities, and after 1968 it also began to involve undergraduates and adults. This led to the establishment of Communion and Liberation which, in 1980, was to be canonically recognised by the Ordinary Abbot of Montecassino, Mgr Martino Matronola. The first fraternity groups were set up in the latter half of the 1970s by CL graduates who, using a method based on communion, wished to strengthen their membership of the Church as adults, along with the responsibilities that this entails. It was through their spread to various countries that the Fraternity of Communion and Liberation came about. On 11 February 1982 the Pontifical Council for the Laity decreed recognition of the Fraternity of Communion and Liberation as an international association of the faithful of Pontifical Right.\n\nIDENTITY\n\nThe essence of the CL charism is the proclamation that God became Man; in the affirmation that this man - Jesus of Nazareth, who died and rose again - is a present event, whose visible sign is communion, that is to say, the unity of a people led by a living person, the Bishop of Rome; in the awareness that it is only in God made man, and hence within the life of the Church, that man is more true and humanity is truly more human. In the educational proposal made by CL, the free acceptance by the individual of the Christian message is determined by the discovery that the needs of the human heart are met by the annunciation of a message that fulfils them. It is the reasonableness of the faith which leads men and women who have been transformed by their encounter with Christ to commit themselves with Christian experience to affect the whole of society. This commitment strengthens their awareness of their own identity, enabling them to see their life as a vocation, and is supported by the experience of communion which makes the memory of ChristÂÂÂs coming a daily reality. The educational process, nurtured by proclamation and catechesis, attending retreats and spiritual exercises, and the celebration of the sacraments, gives pride of place to the dimensions of cultural work as a means of deepening and expressing their faith and as a condition for having a responsible presence in society; charity work, as education in service to be freely given to others and social commitment; and the mission, as education in the sense of the catholicity of the Church and as a vocational choice. Bearing witness to Christ in schools and universities, in factories and offices, and in the local neighbourhood and in the city, takes place above all through work, which is the specific way in which adults relate to reality.\n\nORGANISATION\n\nThe life of the Fraternity is lived through the free formation of groups of men and women of all conditions and states of life, whose friendship and communion are based upon their common commitment to move forward together towards holiness, which they acknowledge to be the genuine purpose of human existence. The association is guided by the President and by the Central Diakonia, of which all the international leaders are members, and the officials in all the various areas in which it is present, and representatives of the other entities that have emerged from the CL charism: the Memores Domini Lay Association (see page 197); the priestly Fraternity of the Missionaries of St Charles Borromeo; the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity of the Assumption. In the dioceses, the diocesan leader is assisted by a Diakonia and by a spiritual Assistant appointed by the local Bishop acting on a proposal by the Fraternity President. Since 1997, the Communion and Liberation International Centre has been operating in Rome, as the liaison centre linking all the parts of the movement worldwide.\n\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nThe Fraternity has 47,994 members in 64 countries as follows: Africa (9), Asia (7), Europe (28), Middle East (3), North America (7), Oceania (1) and South America (9). Over 60,000 people share the CL experience.\n\nWORKS\n\nIndividuals and groups belonging to the Fraternity have taken the responsibility to create cultural, charitable and entrepreneurial works linked together in the Company of Works which has offices in Italy and abroad. These include sheltered homes for the mentally ill, drug-dependants, the disabled, AIDS patients and the terminally ill; companies to provide employment for the disabled; NGOs (AVSI in Italy and CESAL in Spain) to provide assistance and foster the development of poor countries; foundations such as the Food Bank, which provides daily food to over one million poor people in Italy, and the Pharmaceutical Bank; solidarity Centres to assist the unemployed in seeking a job; welfare facilities in childrenÂÂÂs prisons in Africa and America; aid for needy families and finding homes for people in difficulty. The initiatives that have emerged in the field of culture have become a special place for ensuring that the pooling of different experiences is an opportunity for every individual to communicate their own proprium regarding the Christian event: cultural centres, schools (often created by parentsÂÂÂ cooperatives), publishing houses, publishing and newspaper initiatives; foundations and academic institutions; international conferences, such as the Meeting for Friendship among Peoples.
