        "text": "Leadership POC’s: Expanding Your Impact Through Meaningful Connections\n\nBobbi Cumpston | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nJohn Quincey Adams – If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more, and become more, you are a leader.\n\nWhat is a “point of connection”? A connection is a relationship in which a person, thing, or idea is linked or associated with something else. Points of connection are specific interactions with others that bring about illumination, creative innovation, or impactful discussion that adds value. Personal relationships with family and friends, businesses, volunteer organizations, churches, and places we live and work are areas we can influence to improve the community. Points of connection are with people we lead, guide, and mentor that add value to their lives. Global points of connection help expand our worldview, educate us about other cultures, and challenge assumptions and biases. With points of connection, we can help edify and uplift others, share education, and help those less fortunate or in need.\n\nA point of connection can also unite people together for a common purpose and goals. A point of connection can be a moment that changes a situation, enlightens a mind, or develops a beneficial solution to a problem. An individual can experience many points of connection over time. Some connections, like family or friends, last a lifetime. It is where you can provide, nurture, educate, protect, love, and help them find their purpose. Other points of connection are brief or seemingly insignificant and yet can change your course of action.\n\nLeadership is a point of connection. When you lead, there must be followers. Who you are as a leader matters. Your personal leadership statement helps define your mission, meaning, values, and reasons for why you do what you do. (Sosik & Jung, 2018). A strong sense of purpose, resiliency, servant leadership qualities, authenticity, and transformation, help build your leadership character so you can prepare for points of connection with followers. Leaders build hardiness and preparation, make decisions, are involved and committed, and challenge others to develop skills, talents, and leadership qualities (Citrin & Weiss, 2016). Moreover, you determine your internal leadership qualities by defining your code of conduct that upholds your personal and professional reputation.\n\nMeaningful connections include people, power, position, purpose, peace, and person. Each connection represents a relationship with someone who added value to your life through an idea or discussion that illuminated, encouraged, or brought peace about a decision or situation. The people we engage with through family, work, or community should bring peace and help us discover our purpose. Meaningful connections can be intentional meetings or spontaneous moments we remember because of what transpired.\n\nWhen you lead others or encounter them through a point of connection, look for the best in them. Help them find and uplift their strengths, encouraging them to pursue their work actively. The work may be self-development or professional development, but it is often the intentional search for significance. It is through discovering who we are, what we have, and how to walk in it that we find the keys to freedom, joy, well-being, and welfare. Through points of connection, operating in love for one another, leaders can guide others to discover their purpose and passion that puts their life into perspective.\n\nWomen in Church Leadership: Seeking Answers through Biblical Understanding\n\nJordan Collins | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThere is a strong divide in the perception of women being in leadership. Yet, the question remains: Should women be allowed to reside in leadership positions, specifically within the church? If so, is there a limitation to their responsibilities or authority? This manuscript aims to comprehensively understand women in leadership, precisely what the Bible deems proper for this topic. To further expand this issue, research into what the Church of God denomination says will also contribute to a more in-depth understanding of how some believers perceive women in church leadership. At the end of each chapter, readers can participate in a guide that aims to help readers seek answers through further analysis and questions to find solutions that discover a more thorough understanding of the biblical truths of women residing in church leadership.\n\nThe Church of God denomination contains three ministerial ranks. Men and women can obtain the first two ministerial ranks, but only men can acquire the third rank of Ordained Bishop. This manuscript revealed that the biblical understanding and truth are that God did not design women to operate as the head of the household or church. Instead, He created men to fulfill that responsibility (Eph. 5:23), with women working alongside them as their suitable helpers (Eph. 5:22, 24). This truth pertains to the home and the church. However, this biblical understanding is difficult to follow when men and women are not stepping up and walking in the roles God made for them to pursue the Great Commission. Therefore, God uses women in church leadership positions and equips them when necessary.\n\nFurther biblical understanding revealed that God gave men and women a purpose: to fulfill the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19-20). Men operating as the head of the home and church are not so women are less than or insignificant. The devil longs to cause that division among God’s people so there can be no growth and to prevent the body of Christ from reaching others for His Kingdom. If there is division among the members of the Church of God, there will be no growth. In essence, the topic of women residing in church leadership is a symptom of a much larger issue the devil attempts to blind individuals from every year. Therefore, the body of Christ must put on the armor of God and fight against the devil’s schemes and lies. By putting on and efficiently using the armor of God, men and women can stand against the enemy’s schemes while proactively moving forward with pursuing the Great Commission together.\n\nThe devil wants to blind believers to the influence they could have on this world if they work together to pursue the Great Commission. When believers trap themselves in the fight about whether women should reside in church leadership, their hearts are not focused on the core issue of what this world is facing: people living their lives in eternal separation from God. Therefore, it is time to stop fighting against each other and giving in to the devil’s schemes. Instead, believers everywhere must stand together on the Word of God, knowing His truth is powerful and effective (Heb. 4:12-13). Trust God and His plan for each person. Walk in obedience and expectation of God’s goodness and love that follows believers throughout their lives (Psa. 23:6).\n\nStrategic Thinking for Mission and Ministry (In the Salvation Army Context)\n\nAnthony T. Juliana | 2023\n\nAbstract: It is certainly easy, and somewhat misleading to cast blame for the current lack of inertia within ecclesial organizations on the preservation of programmatic sacred cows and lack of leadership innovation. Instead, the challenge may be less obvious due to Christian leaders’ preoccupation with “doing” while often overlooking the value of “thinking.” Strategic theories and concepts can be found in Biblically historic military events which also serve as the metaphors for much of the innovative principles of spiritual leadership. Yet, the faith-based organizations which would benefit most from such strategic thinking often find themselves being reactive rather than responsive to the adaptive challenges and changes coming their way.\n\nTopic: Strategic thinking for missional leaders is about creating a new, sustainable strategic culture for mission success and ministry advancement. This eight-module course is designed for ecclesial leaders as a practical, hands-on learning experience for the development of strategic thinking principles and skills in a mission and ministry context.\n\nMethodology: This course material engages both professional and lay leadership through a combination of short-form lectures based on theological, academic, and practical theory and research, self-assessment and development tools, group activities, media components and individual exercises. It is designed to inspire, engage, and help participants develop strategic thinking competencies and necessary ecclesial leadership skills for the realization of mission and ministry opportunities in their church or organization. The core curriculum is structured around eight modules and includes illustrative material from The Salvation Army context.\n\nExpectations: The overall course objective is to contribute to the discussion surrounding how Christian leaders can think strategically, how to develop strategic insight, how to create a strategic vision, how to practice strategic foresight, and how to define effective missional strategies for the future.\n\nContribution to Future Studies: It is the intention of this course to explore Biblical strategic thinkers and exegete strategic thinking practices as applicable behaviors, competencies, and actions toward a theological view of strategic thinking in ecclesial leadership environments. Far from being a comprehensive study, the purpose of this course is to instigate the conversation of the exegetical value of the strategic thinking theology for the advancement of Biblical mission and ministry of ecclesial leadership.\n\nKey Words: Administration, Branding, Communication, Design, Foresight, Human Resource Development, Insight, Leadership, Missional Fulfillment, Organizational Purpose, Strategy, Sustainability, Theology.\n\nThe Leader’s Handbook: A Christian’s Guide to Strategic Leadership\n\nJustin Loyd | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nLeadership is never easy, and tomorrow’s leaders will need to be the very best possible to deal with the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) realities they will awaken to everyday. The Covid-19 Pandemic has been called by some a Black Swan event. Something extremely rare that only happens once and could not have been foreseen. Meteorology, however, tells us that those once-in-a-lifetime storms are beginning to happen once a decade as the historical patterns seem less relevant with each passing season. Similarly, leaders will need to be more strategic now than ever to deal with challenges ranging from diversity to AI to hybrid work environments. Their ability to synthesize their belief system, cultural experience, and worldview will be necessary as they operate in authenticity and humility at the head of their organizations and strive to leave a legacy and long-lasting impact.\n\nThis book offers support to leaders of all seasons and experience levels. No matter where you are in your leadership journey, it can help you with the next step. With an emphasis on blending the science and art of leadership, it provides tools and techniques to help deal with the most difficult leadership challenges. Part coaching manual and part field manual, it combines case studies, philosophy, motivation, and step-by-step instruction in a clear and concise, easy-to-read book that you will reference repeatedly. Pulling examples off the front page of today’s new normal while expounding on Biblical stories to demonstrate real-world truths, it seeks to draw the leader into a deeper relationship with God and strengthen their call to leadership.\n\nThis book is broken down into three sections, the Past, Present, and Future. Each of which examines relevant topics on the leader’s journey, enabling them to use it as a resource for a specific topic, or read it through for a holistic approach in their own journey. Today’s Christian leader was put here on this earth for such a time as this, and this book seeks to provide strategic tools to help them be the leaders that change the world and usher in the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\nKey Words: Leadership, Handbook, VUCA, Strategic, God, Culture\n\nYou’re Not My Type: Discipleship Designed for Diverse Dispositions\n\nBrodwynn Charles Roberts | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe numbers are astounding. Eighty percent of Christian adults need to be more engaged in discipleship activities. In comparison, according to the Barna Report, 20 percent of Christian adults are engaged in Bible Study, Sunday School, or a prayer gathering. The job description of every Christian is in Matthew 28:19-20, “Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.” Unfortunately, Christian leaders and laity need to fulfill the mandate spoken by Jesus. The discipleship deficit that many churches face is due, in part, to the one-size-fits-all approach used to “make disciples.” The Barna Report highlights that “cookie-cutter” programs hinder discipleship. This book seeks to answer how ecclesial leaders can engage and design discipleship for the 80 percent who need to be more engaged in discipleship activities.\n\nJesus’ interaction with any person was a moment that was designed specifically for them. Jesus cultivated relationships that served as the foundation for discipling. The Discipleship Designed for Diverse Dispositions Model recognizes that everyone is different and that ecclesial leaders can create discipleship activities with those differences in mind. The model’s foundations are Domain, Data, Decision, and Default. Each field correlates with the four dichotomies specified in Carl Jung’s psychological theory that is the basis of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers personality type assessment tool known as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. Using the MBTI gives the model the flexibility needed to create activities that will appeal to the diverse dispositions that make up our congregations.\n\nThe D4 Model considers personality preferences and includes activities designed for those personality preferences. Persons who prefer extraversion will naturally enjoy activities promoting group fellowships and encouraging open conversations and dialogue. At the same time, individuals whose dominant preference is introversion would be attracted to activities that promote reflection and mediation. This model provides custom-designed programming that meets the needs of every personality type. This model gives congregants options that will recruit and retain lifelong disciples.\n\nThe Strategic Needs Analysis of Leadership within The Persian Church\n\nNathan Rostampour | 2023\n\nAbstract\n\nThe leadership within the Iranian church needs to experience a revolutionary change. I have heard and experienced many good and bad things about the Iranian church for years. One of the good things is that the Iranian church is one of the fastest-growing evangelical populations in the world. However, there are challenges when something grows in number rapidly, and leaders need more time to be ready for change and to solve problems. Now is the time for the Iranian church to focus on healthy and biblical church leadership and transform the Iranian church. As a leadership coach and consultant, I have written this consulting report which is a strategic needs analysis to help leaders plan for a revolutionary change in the Iranian church. I designed a questionary with seven questions, and I interviewed 30 Iranian house church leaders and 70 Iranian house church members.\n\nBased on the analysis of the results, I discovered the areas of urgent need for Iranian secret house churches in Iran. All Iranian church leaders and members of those churches showed their strong desire for healthy and thriving church leadership and discipleship within the Iranian church; however, they constantly face challenges and problems that are pushbacks for the church leaders and their members. According to Open Doors USA, the Iranian church is in 9th place among the most persecuted churches in the world. Therefore, Christians in Iran have many security concerns. Moreover, due to the limitations of Christians, there are not enough opportunities for the Iranian church to train ministers and make mature believers. These limitations have caused trouble for the church and its members, who are unsatisfied with their leaders’ performances and their churches’ care toward them.\n\nAlthough there are security concerns and limitations in the Iranian church, the major problems are related to the leaders’ weaknesses and their unhealthy leadership within the Iranian church. According to my research, these are the main areas the Iranian church needs to focus on and make revolutionary changes to help Iranian believers grow healthily and enduringly.\n\nWorking on leaders’ character and skills.\n\nProviding safe online education for secret house church leaders.\n\nLeadership coaching, mentoring, and accountability.\n\nUnity among Iranian church leaders.\n\nBuilding a healthy and biblical leadership culture.\n\nTo accomplish this vital goal, the Iranian church must invest more in leadership training and start by working on leaders’ character and their personal challenges through coaching, mentoring, and counseling, and help them overcome the adverse outcomes of unhealthy leadership styles and the Islamic culture that have negatively impacted the leadership in the Iranian church. The Iranian leaders must unite, and further research must be conducted to see how they can grow together and help their churches thrive amid limitations and persecution. The good news for the Iranian leaders is that Jesus has already promised that He is and will be with them in this rewarding and exciting journey (Matthew 28:18-20).\n\nManagement Accounting & Internal Control Strategies for Business Success\n\nSandra Avery | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nMany factors can impact the success or failure of starting and sustaining a small business; however, the inability to properly manage internal resources and processes is a significant factor for survival. According to Williams (1984), “One primary cause of the high failure rate for small businesses is a lack of knowledge on the part of owners and managers about accounting, particularly management accounting and internal controls” (p. 73). The need to provide tools that will empower business owners, who, in many cases, do not have an accounting background, is the basis for this business training program. The targeted audience includes non-accounting business owners, entrepreneurs, managers, and other business professionals who need to understand and effectively apply accounting and business managements concepts without having to possess an expert level in these areas.\n\nHaving knowledge surrounding accounting and internal controls is insufficient in managing daily business operations; owners must apply the related concepts when creating and interpreting internal reports and when using that information to make informed decisions. Sibanda & Manda (2016) reported: “The assessment of the problems the SMEs [Small and Mid-size Enterprises] encounter and development of the training programs to address these problems should go a long way to assist theses SMEs to equipped with the necessary accounting practices, financial and managerial skills to survive” (p. 194). As such, the objective of these modules is to equip individuals with information and skills to overcome the business obstacles they encounter. One feature of the sessions includes opportunities for participants to apply these principles in relevant case scenarios that include internal and external factors to consider in determining a course of action. The use of real-life situations, which have controllable and non-controllable elements, helps create the environment that owners encounter in managing their day-to-day operations.\n\nTopics included in the workshop series are designed to help participants realize the crucial roles that managerial accounting and internal controls play in business success, understand key accounting terminology and concepts, and recognize the critical linked between accounting and strategy. With this foundation, participants will continue throughout the series with learning how to assess the information needed to monitor goal progress and attainment, establish internal processes to ensure relevant and timely information is accurately prepared, and using that information along with external data to make informed decisions. Therefore, if leaders understand how to efficiently maximize the use of the controllable areas, such as managerial accounting and internal controls, they could improve their chances of success.\n\nKeywords: small businesses, owners, business development, management accounting, internal control, strategies\n\nReferences\n\nSibanda, J.

There has been a now-noticeable shift in how people see themselves and how they relate to the world around them. Traditionally Americans have derived their identities from primarily external sources such as their families, churches, schools, and the realities of the world around them. Over the past decades, there have been strong challenges to these traditional institutions that have allowed and even encouraged individuals to define themselves according to their inward desires. The effects are seen as anti-Christian morality has burst into the public square. Modern academics such as Carl Trueman have identified this phenomenon as “expressive individualism,” where the “true, inner self,” ungoverned by reality, biblical morality, or traditional values, can finally be expressed openly. This is the Progressive Agenda. Trueman and other academics give a pessimistic report on how we, the Church, are to roll back the tide of “expressive individualism.“ God, however, has not been surprised by these events, and His truth is always true. While Christians may be overwhelmed by the Progressive issues of today, the solution for His people has not changed; go to Him and His Word for answers. God has established by His Word an authority structure consisting of the Family, the Church, and the Nation (Community) that is undergirded by self-governed individuals who move through and influence all three structures. Within each authority structure, leaders are to love their followers with a sacrificial, Christlike love. In return, the followers choose to show honor and respect to their leaders. This is truth, and any other structure is counterfeit. The United States of America was established along these lines by wise and Godly men who were not perfect but endeavored to follow the teachings of Scripture as best they knew in the realities of their times. In modern times it is good to study the real, so the counterfeit can be quickly identified. This is how bank tellers are trained. It is fruitless to study every type of possible counterfeit bill, so they study the real, and anything different is counterfeit. Fortunately, once the counterfeit is identified, we can turn to the Master Builder for answers. God always knows how to straighten out the crooked structures; He drops the plumbline so all can see how it aligns with the Cornerstone, Jesus. Then, if leaders are able to hear His voice and be willing and obedient to do as He says, we can repair this country and continue to eat the good of this great land.\n\nKeywords: republic, expressive individualism, morality, identity, constitution, America, self, leaders\n\nUsing Your Voice Strategically\n\nPatrice Campbell | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper explores the various ways to use your voice in different domains. We shall focus on the benefits and implications when using your voice or the lack of using your voice. This paper will distinguish how to lead, the characteristics of a leader, and how time has cultivated the way people maneuver themselves in personal, business, and faith-based situations. We shall also provide efficient and effective ways to communicate, discuss why discernment is important prior to speaking/reacting, and unveil significant resolutions. The topics and research are plentiful; however, we will begin by defining what leadership is, how biblical leaders contributed to Christianity and the necessity for having a voice. The implications will be drawn from a survey and personal experiences, and then solidified by what will help future leaders to be/become successful while providing a strong foundation for other leaders and their followers.\n\nCommunication, voice articulation, and expressing self-individuality in the sense of leading have evolved significantly. “Voice refers to the behavior of expressing ideas, opinions, suggestions, or alternative approaches that aims at organizational change and improvement” (Mian, Zhong & Ren, 2022). This document will shed light on how people have changed how they can and will use their voices. In a biblical domain, people use their voice to communicate, follow, listen, and lead. Moreover, it is God’s word that leads communication; it is followed by applying the word and using it to get through to its followers/potential followers. God was able to use people to spread the word and compel others to follow or take a position to help lead. 2 Corinthians 2:14, “But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us n triumphal procession, and through us spreads he fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.” Today, communication is delivered by a series of methods. The generation has changed so much; its primary method is through emotional intelligence/technology and other informal means (i.e., text, email, gossip). It is important to discuss past, present, and future norms to further evolve communication processes and the best methods to find your voice, use your voice, and remain in the likeness of God’s umbrella.\n\nWhile many biblical characters used their voices to speak out on various topics, some stand out more than others. Ruth, a strong humble, woman of God, shows to be relevant while indulging in people who use their voice. We will further discuss her position and how she contributed to followership, leadership, obedience, and loyalty, while being a God-fearing woman; After learning of Ruth, assessing some of her theories or methodologies for self-utilization is quite common. A significant portion of this paper will discuss the essence of having a personal story, using your own story to enlighten others, and engaging in self-awareness to cultivate change within ourselves and others.\n\nThe last portion(s) of this document will expand and explain the different environments/organizations in that followers and leaders can and should use their voices. It will distinguish how to use your voices, when to use it, and when to listen more than speak. Different places require different reactions. That means a person must use discernment and go into situations using prayer, which will be their guide in the hope of doing as 1 Corinthians 14:40, “Let all things be done decently and in order.” “Within the Christian life, there are many pillars of truth which are critical to our spiritual development and one of these is discernment. The word may have several meanings, but mostly it’s associated with having spiritual sensitivity” (Gleaner, 2020). Prior to presenting the Power Point presentation to a group of leaders at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, I withstood a dry-run presentation that allowed me to discover any issues prior to the actual presentation. The eight (8) leaders/peers that I had the pleasure of presenting to were randomly selected from various sections within my military domain; these leaders were briefed regarding the presentation being a direct reflection of this document. This document and the presentation’s conclusion will confer and end with specific implications and solutions.\n\nUS Commercial Leadership Development (USCLD) Program\n\nRoberta Denny | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThe US Commercial Leadership Development (USCLD) Program is designed to assist organizations with improving provide extended benefits to both the participant and the organization. The program is designed to satisfy the fundamental essentials of the intern so that upon completion of the program, the intern can function as a professional. This functionality will be gained by the means of having utilized their learnings from their educational pursuits, coupled with the practical training and hands on experience they have gained within their specific field of study, through completion of the internship. The program is designed to help your organization pave the way for a talented enriched future with the organizational partnerships that assist with the attainment, development, and talent mapping of high potential personnel. Thus, resulting in a pipeline of high potential future employees, who are diversified in background and experience, who have an allegiance to the organization, and an understanding of and have already brought into the organization’s employment brand.\n\nMany companies struggle with attracting and retaining the right talent, especially when referring to interns. In this handbook, our organization explains the US Commercial Leadership Development Program that we have developed to help organizations attract high potential interns and to significantly improve their retention of these interns, through strategies and methodologies that foster exceptional acquisition, internship experience, as well as retention.\n\nThis enhanced long term talent acquisition and retention process includes many of the previous dynamics in the traditional talent acquisition process, however it adds the additional strategies and methodologies that are not included or developed within the traditional process. This program is a three phase approach, PHASE 1 – Talent Acquisition, PHASE 2 – Internship and Recruitment, and PHASE 3 – Resource Retention. Each phase has four steps that guides your organizational leadership through each portion of the program.\n\nThis is key to enhancing your organizations internship resource retention. The program is essential because your organization is not only looking to fulfill current vacancies and skill gaps, but to also be proactive and have a pool of ready resources who can fulfill the future vacancies and skill gaps that are anticipated to come, as the market continues to grow and change.\n\nTHAT GRAY AREA: Leadership Application in Today’s Socio-cultural Workforce and Society\n\nJacob Desuyo | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThe premise for which “That Gray Area” was founded is in direct correlation with today’s evolving socio-cultural landscape. The shift in sociocultural behavior from generation to generation is not an unforeseen occurrence and society has naturally evolved alongside such changes. Consider a few major shifts in societal behavior: The abolishing of slavery, women’s rights, and LGBTQ rights. All of which were movements that have progressed substantially over time. However, these movements only serve as a small portion of the complex groups and individuals that make up our society, and workforce much less. Therefore, suggesting that a deeper understanding of how to interact with such diverse individuals is needed, especially in an organizational setting. Despite the need for deeper understanding of such diversity, an alternative precedent has been established that has created an entirely different set of complex rules pertaining to leader-member interaction.\n\nThe precedent that has been established continues to recognize a correlation between organizational success and management style. However, the leader’s management style has reverted to accommodate for the follower’s expectations as opposed to the follower living up to the expectations established by the leader more so in comparison to previous decades and generations. Although it can be argued that effective leadership has always taken into account the perspective of followers, this shift in leader-follower interaction collaterally introduces new and complex variables. Such variables have become the foundation for which an individual is viewed as being an “effective leader”. Individuals that attempt to apply a generalized approach to leadership while assuming that followers must adapt to their specific method of leadership will, ultimately, face challenges that occurred less often in previous generations.\n\nSuch a viewpoint can be seen as a “black and white” method of leadership application. Leaders that are able to operate successfully in “That Gray Area” take the time to perceive and apply leadership from a place of humility while accommodating for individual’s receptiveness to alternative methods of leadership. While a leader that is able to operate successfully in “That Gray Area” makes an effort to understand how a follower receives leadership at an individual level, such a leader also focuses on qualities that the follower possesses on an individual level as well, not according to the demographic that they belong to from a cultural, racial, or biological perspective. And finally, leaders that operate successfully in “That Gray Area” are also able to instill valuable traits, such as “perceiving constructive criticism” or “overcoming adversity”, that they were able to accrue in previous versions of the workforce that did not accommodate for followers as much as modern society.\n\nThe interviews that were conducted for the “That Gray Area” documentary serve as a foundation in which leadership can be perceived and applied moving forward in today’s more sensitive social-cultural environment. Although the individuals that were interviewed in the documentary only serve as a small sample of our workforce’s leadership population, the range of industries that are represented allows viewers to gain insight into how leadership and followership should be perceived from a broad perspective. The hypothesis upon entering the interviews with the leaders in the “That Gray Area” documentary was that leadership in today’s evolving socio-cultural environment must evolve as well, to remain relevant and ethically appropriate. However, the practical application of principles and life-lessons obtained from experiences that took place in the less fragile socio-cultural state of our workforce serves as a critical factor that separates mediocre leaders from great leaders. Findings suggest that leaders in various industries acknowledge the evolution of the state of our socio-cultural environment and minor adjustments must be made as to how to approach followers today. However, the standard for which job performance is graded must not fluctuate to align with modern-day evolution of leader-follower interaction.\n\nView the documentary here or search on Youtube: “THAT GRAY AREA: The Leadership Documentary.”\n\nBreaking 10 Leadership Bad Habits: A Field Guide for How Business Executives Can Achieve Both Personal and Professional Success and Significance\n\nJeffery Doolittle | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nLeadership bad habits are not destiny. Effective leadership makes a difference in the personal and professional results you achieve and the life you live. Leaders must continually transform and adapt or fall behind. The best organizations are made up of the best leaders. Leaders with closed minds and organizations closed to new ideas quickly fall behind and become obsolete in a fast-paced digital workplace. All leaders need to continually develop at a pace consistent with the change in the world. Business executives desire to achieve both success and significance in life and at work. However, privately, they question if it is possible given the expectations from their board members, shareholders, and key stakeholders. Often success and significance appear to be competing priorities and opposite ends on a continuum. Striving for better habits is a competitive advantage available to any leader looking for a powerful point of differentiation.\n\nBreaking: To stop or bring to an end suddenly; To cause to discontinue a habit.\n\nBad: Failing to reach an acceptable standard; Morally objectionable; unsuited to a purpose.\n\nHab·​its: Routines, patterns, or practices performed regularly; automatic responses to a specific situation.\n\nThis breakthrough book, Breaking 10 Leadership Bad Habits: A Field Guide for How Business Executives Can Achieve Both Personal and Professional Success and Significance, by Jeff Doolittle equips you with the latest proven research and field-tested solutions on how to bring out your best and be the leader you want to be, and the world needs you to be. These ideas are grounded in fields of psychology, philosophy, biology, and neuroscience. This books contribution is synthesizing the best ideas and new connections of ideas into a reference guide in highly practical ways to break the ten most challenging bad habits that derail high potential leaders, executives, and business owners.\n\nThis field guide is not designed to comprehensively identify every way a bad habit shows up in the workplace. Instead, to help executives focus on the pressing readily visible ways in which a bad habit shows up for them. This book provides case studies and illustrations to aid habit identification across a vice-virtue continuum. Chapters conclude with transformational tools and exercises, key summary points, and a few reflective questions to expand your thinking on breaking the bad habit.\n\nWhile the work, worker, and workplace are continually changing, the bad habits and proven solutions identified in this book are timeless. Leaders can rely on the lasting principles year over year to grow personally and professionally. You can utilize these principles to build a career, business, and life.\n\nKeywords: Leadership Development, Habits, Business, Vices, Virtues\n\nYour Preferences and God’s Purpose for the Church: An Assessment and Strategy for Ministry Alignment\n\nJeff Gossmann | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nDue to the lack of an official universal liturgy, many Evangelical churches lack unifying strategic goals and a sense of purpose. Instead, many Evangelical churches base their ministry designs on the preferences of the senior leadership team. That is, the church’s most robust ministries are whatever activities the pastors like the most. Unfortunately, when church leaders base their ministries only on their preferences, they will fall short of the full purposes of God for the Church. This author proposes that God’s purpose for the Church is fourfold: teaching, worship, service, and evangelism. Many church leaders prefer one or two of these purposes to the neglect of the others. This manuscript provides an assessment that determines which preferences take priority in the reader’s church. The Ministry Preference Assessment Instrument is founded on the Ministry Preference Matrix Theory. This theory proposes that all church leaders’ preferences exist on two polarities. Pastors prioritize either intellectual or emotional aspects of ministry. They have either an internal (church) focus or an external (world) focus.\n\nWhen shaped as an X-Y axis, these two polarities create four quadrants representing four different church profile types: Doctrinal, Experiential, Diaconal, and Missional. Each profile is strong in one of the Fourfold Purposes of the Church and usually weak in the others. This manuscript describes each church profile, explaining each’s go-to strategies and its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. The second half of the manuscript thoroughly explains the theological importance of creating a balance between the four purposes of the church, using four wheels on a car as an analogy. The remaining chapters describe the Fourfold Strategy, which will help pastors create the balance between God’s purpose and their preferences for a healthy church. The manuscript provides valuable suggestions on how to use objectives, evaluations, and lead and lag measures to ensure their ministry stays focused on what truly matters. Finally, the manuscript describes what an effective leadership development program should look like and makes suggestions on Transformational Leadership behaviors based on the reader’s church profile. This manuscript will help church leaders waste less effort on fruitless activities and become the Fourfold Purpose Church that God desires them to be.\n\nThe Eternal Promise: Servanthood and Marriage\n\nTerri Hannibal | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThe characteristic of servanthood is to inspire, which is the most Christ-like. Inspiring hope and bringing forth light in dark times encourages and brings unity. The most critical element must be love. Jesus, the ultimate servant leader, gave His life and showed by example of giving of oneself for another a love like no other. So when it is dark and despairing, a greater love awaits to help.\n\nThere are many stories and a variety of themes regarding relationships. This story, this script is one reflection of a relationship that shows, to one degree, the truth of Servanthood. This story also focuses on different themes of mental illness that the character Beverly endured. With care and concern, we see just how Michael (the estranged husband) could have avoided many of the issues that got them to the breaking point if he had been a true servant to his wife.\n\nServant leadership and servanthood is not just a theory; it is or should be a lifestyle that, if followed, serves all people. Matthew 20:28, Jesus said, “Even as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many” (NIV). Eternal Promise is a story that will show the power of servanthood. This story will bring people, in this case Michael and Beverly, to truth. There is the moment towards the end when the realization occurs and both Michael and Beverly are enlightened. When they both realize their failures in their marriage only then, can both of them know that the failures can be forgiven and redemption and change can begin.\n\nServanthood is one of the most powerful forms of leadership where you serve your family with unconditional love. Within servanthood you go the last mile for your spouse, and exercise authority with compassion, and put your family’s needs ahead of yours. The leader makes leadership decisions without thinking about their agenda, doing the right things that need to be done, and leading their family to a good place. There is also addressing the subject of servanthood outside of the script.\n\nThe script is the meat of this final project; it is the final project. The supplement expounds on the principles of servanthood and different aspects of servanthood. There is the hope that the reader will see the principles of Eternal Promise and truth in this. We are all servants called to servanthood to help, preach, and teach Jesus Christ’s truth and why He did what He did for us on the cross. This gives us not a reflection but a true ETERNAL PROMISE. Servanthood should be the goal in life, and our characteristics should be our eyes and ears for Jesus.\n\nPerfect Imperfection: Eliminating Disparity and Developing Opportunity for Black Women in Leadership\n\nAisha Hart-Miller | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nA desire to cultivate an accurate perception of who I am and who we are as black women in leadership was both arduous and critical. Exploring the disparity and bias I received as a black woman made me seek the heart of God for a way to theorize my experiences and others. Two theories were coined: A Black Woman’s Leadership Disparity Theory and A Black Woman’s Opportunity Theory. A variety of topics and situations across disciplines, levels of hierarchy, and compensation underscored distinct divergence for black women leading and those attempting to advance in corporate America. The formidable synonym being affixed to black women as the “angry black woman” was being applied to impassioned, hard-working, and dedicated black women serving in their various roles. The social construct built through race and gender creates a wedge between success and growth for many black women. Even amongst Christian black women this phenomenon was rampant although it was really being embodied through blurry vantage points. To demystify the presumptions, I sought a collaborative process to concurrently vindicate and uplift black women while challenging leaders in authority to recognize this problem.\n\nA few things are accomplished through this hybrid manuscript/ curriculum, Perfect Imperfection: Eliminating Disparity and Developing Opportunity for Black Women in Leadership. It becomes a written protest that implores us all to walk in the perfect imperfection we were created to be. The work is broken into seven sections that offer a creative culmination expression to engage readers and participants. First, it provides a narrative of a different character in each chapter outlining their varying yet similar experiences across disciplines. Second, specific struggles are identified by each character to provide a foundation for the next section. Third, system(s) address systemic and oppressive issues researched to connect the experience to theories and create factual context. Fourth, an applicable leadership strategy is provided to offer a framework forward from assumptions that create discrimination of all kinds. Fifth, scriptures and biblical comparison to women of the bible are identified as leaders several considered to be black parallel to depict both perspective and victory. Sixth, reflective sonnets are authored acting as mantras and poetic expression eliminating the “invisibility” that has become so commonplace for black women in the workforce. Lastly, reflective questions are provided as a study to support the intentional work that must occur as part of the developmental process to becoming a perfectly imperfect Christian black woman in the workforce.\n\nKeywords: Leadership, Disparity, Black Women, Work, Bias, Theory\n\nFrom Destitute to Debonair: SEMPLE Tips to Redefining Yourself as A Leader\n\nDeyonta Johnson | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis seven-chapter inspiration and interactive manuscript entitled From Destitute to Debonair: SEMPLE Tips to Redefining Yourself as A Leader is designed for youth ages 14 to 17. In this manuscript, readers embark on a journey of improving their lives spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically by using the simple tips provided by the “SEMPLE” acronym. The manuscript employs leadership theories that steer the reader into self-reflection, self-awareness, and self-care by strategically identifying current thoughts and circumstances and what is needed to be successful in life. The reader will complete a series of questionnaires, brainstorm diagrams, explore real-life scenarios, and devise an action plan to equip them to lead in life. The seven chapters are as follows:\n\nChapter 1-Who AM I?-Authentic Leadership\n\nThis chapter requires the reader to reflect on who they are as a person and who they desire to be as a leader.\n\nChapter 2-What AM I?-Skill Theory\n\nThis chapter will identify problem-solving skills needed to handle various problems they may face in their life.\n\nChapter 3-When AM I?-Situational Leadership\n\nThis chapter demonstrates to the reader how they should handle the various situations they may face in their lives.\n\nChapter 4-Where AM I?-Adaptive Leadership\n\nThis chapter will identify specific situations within the readers’ lives that require them to know when to lead and when to follow.\n\nChapter 5-Why AM I?-Transformational Leadership\n\nThis chapter will seek to have the reader maximize their full potential through transformation.\n\nChapter 6- How AM I?-Ethical Leadership\n\nThe reader will explore the importance of doing the right thing even when no one is there to witness their actions.\n\nChapter 7-Now AM I?- Path-Goal Theory\n\nThis chapter builds on the skills from the previous chapter and devises a plan to improve the reader’s life by setting “SEMPLE” goals.\n\nReferences\n\nAntonakis, John and Robert J.

Because to think about the future is to make better decisions (Thorstad & Wolff, 2018). Take the United States Air Force (USAF) as an example. Knowing that the current operational posture is not sufficient to support the contested environment that is projected into the future, the USAF issued modifications to its Accelerate Change or Lose guidance in order that they would make the necessary changes today to be able to accomplish strategic goals into the future (Brown, 2020a; Brown 2020b; Secretary of the Air Force Public Affairs, 2022). In the same way, people inside and outside of the work environment are refining current strategies, operations, and tasks to encourage better decisions so that strategic goals are met in the future. However, there is a dilemma.\n\nWhile people are concerned for the future, that concern is a near future-sighted concern, meaning that they tend to look less far into the future, especially when it comes to their personal future – their future selves (McGonigal, 2017; Hagan, 2017). Therefore, their ability to make effective decisions for the benefit of their future selves is greatly reduced, causing them not only to “put their physical and psychological health at risk,” but also their eternal health (Thorstad & Wolff, 2018, p. E1740).\n\nTherefore, the book, In the Healing Business, provides strategic foresight techniques to help build a person’s far future-sightedness so that they can make preparations for eternal life sooner rather than later. This is done by conducting a strategic foresight analysis on the number one cause of death in the world – heart disease, as a way to diagnose the spiritual condition of mankind’s heart and to provide them the path to success. By doing this, mankind will be given the far future-sightedness they currently lack to help them take serious the long-term implications of mankind’s heart problem so that they can take their God-given place In the Healing Business, knowing that it will lead them to eternal life.\n\nIf you desire a deeper understanding of God’s redemptive work, In the Healing Business, is available now as a paperback.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, C.

Transformational change requires new ways of thinking — future-centric mindsets. This program, Future-Centric Leadership Development: Strategic Foresight & Systems Thinking to Improve Individual & Organizational Outcomes, is a series of digital content modules geared toward reforming mindsets and deconstructing limiting beliefs to enable and empower the creation of desired futures. The premise is that the future doesn’t have to happen to us; we can design and structure it so that it happens for us.\n\nThe program was developed with the heartfelt dual purpose of introducing Strategic Foresight and Systems Thinking and presenting the two as groundbreaking enhancements to development systems, programs, and processes — related to personal and professional development and existing and emerging Leadership Development models. While the mindsets and practices of Strategic Foresight and Systems Thinking are invaluable in every aspect of business (and life), few individuals and organizations currently utilize them, despite the game-changing results they bring.\n\nNevertheless, this program focuses on the developmental experiences and foreseeable trajectories of individuals and the organizations they serve. The program’s foremost objective is to illuminate and bridge the gap between individuals’ existing complexity of mind (or level of consciousness) and the current complexities of their internal and external environments, which must be aligned if one hopes to survive and thrive in the global VUCA environment. This objective is fulfilled by equipping participants with foundational information in several key areas.\n\nLeadership\n\nLeadership History & Definitions\n\nLeadership Approaches & Frameworks (Theories)\n\nLeadership Assessments\n\nStrategic Foresight\n\nTools & Practices (e.g., Future Thinking)\n\nFutures Exploration & Design Futures\n\nStrategic Foresight in Leadership Development\n\nSystems\n\nSystems Dynamics & Systems Thinking\n\nSystems Design & Design Thinking\n\nSystems Change & Systems Leadership\n\nLeadership Operating Systems\n\nTwo Leadership Development models\n\nThe Full Range Leadership Development (FRLD)\n\nThe Universal Model of Leadership (UML)\n\nThe purpose is to plant seeds of transformational change, tilling the soil by bringing a broad awareness of Strategic Foresight and Systems Thinking and how to enact them. Secondarily, the program emphasizes that Leadership Development systems and processes can and must be designed or redesigned such that individuals’ consciousness or existing structure of mind — internal operating system — is stimulated to evolve progressively and adapt fluidly, ahead of, or at least in tandem with, the ever-in-flux environmental complexities.\n\nBy integrating Strategic Foresight and Systems Thinking with personal and Leadership Development, we are empowered to zoom out to the systems level, to see “the big picture,” identify improvement opportunities, find leverage points to tweak, and perceive how the system will likely respond to change. In other words, we can see the causes and effects — the reinforcing and balancing loops of reciprocal causality — to identify issues, determine which changes will bring the most value, and distinguish the potentially costliest non-actions or ineffective actions. Anyone seeking to grow themselves or others may create desired futures using this holistic, future-centric approach having these newfound insights regarding how to foresee and generate positive transformational change and its astonishing results.\n\nThe program advocates that Strategic Foresight mindsets, tools, and practices with Systems Thinking can be overlaid upon existing Leadership Development models or woven into the design and structure of emerging models to enable the envisioning of alternative futures and the creation of desired futures. The program hypothesizes that integrating Strategic Foresight and Systems Thinking can take personal and Leadership Development to new levels, with measurable improvements, using the FRLD model, the UML, and the program author’s self-assessment results as a case study. The intention is to conduct further research to challenge the program’s position — by experimentation with additional cases, conducting seminars and workshops, and administering pre- and post-program 360-degree leadership assessments — and identify and fill any gaps discovered with the FRLD and the UML models during the process.\n\nWhat Works for Executive Coaching?\n\nPatrick Kambu Mbenza | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nExecutive coaching has become the standard used to address organizational performance and productivity. Executive coaching has gained a significant consideration in senior leaders and executive development. Research show that companies are investing considerable amount of resource in area of coaching to withstand the constant changes in the business environment. Recent research in business indicates that coaching has dramatic effects on performance outcomes and this sort of effect is felt in all areas of coaching. Thus coaching, as has emerged over the last 20 years in the Western world, is a standard process that can help not only the performance of individuals and the productivity of organizations, but also anybody and everybody in facing the issues they have in their private and personal lives (Sale & Moynan, 2018).\n\nA recent survey from the Conference Board of Canada revealed that 72 percent of organizations surveyed use coaching to support leadership development. However, despite its growing popularity in applied settings, this developmental intervention has to date received little attention in empirical research. Few rigorous quantitative empirical studies have been conducted, and most of them have focused on the effectiveness of coaching (Baron, Morin & Morin, 2010). For the purpose of this doctoral project, a study has been conducted through a survey to find out what works for executive coaching. All people who completed the survey hold leadership positions, whether in a business organization or a not-for-profit organization. This project represents a valuable resource for coaches and coachees. Executive and leadership coaches will be better prepared to help their clients most effectively by making value of this project. This project goes through in-depth analyses of what coachees expect from coaches; how they can better support them in achieving their goals. The leaders who completed the survey shared their coaching experience. They shared the strengths and weaknesses they have observed from their coachees and made some suggestions on how coaches could improve their coaching practices. This study has revealed that coaching is a productive relationship and partnership. Coachees observe their coachees more than they imagine. They are detail-oriented and look at all aspects of the coaching sessions: personal connection, competencies, time management, and many more. What ten years ago was seen as an emergency measure to address toxic behavior in leadership has now become a privileged service provided to the high potentials to help them further develop their capabilities and successfully ascend the organizational hierarchy. Executive coaching has also permeated the traditional management education boundaries, with an increasing number of business schools globally incorporating EC practices into their postgraduate and executive education program. A recent survey of executives and business school deans identified a clear need for business schools to do more on leadership development, including the incorporation of individual coaching into their curricula (Athanasopoulou & Dopson, 2015).\n\nKeywords: Executive coaching, coach, coachee, leaders, survey, project, organizational performance, Leadership development, business\n\nAda’s Coronation: An Allegory of the Significance of Leadership\n\nAvis McGriff | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nLeadership is a vital research topic. The significance of leadership has long been valued in many regards. Whether leadership is being examined from the vantage point of how leaders are developed or the emerging examinations of leadership models, leadership as a platform has been a subject of continual consideration. Exploring leadership through an allegorical journey promotes a deeper connection with leadership principles. As the reader is guided into the private spaces of a leader’s thoughts—namely, Queen Ada on the day of her Royal Coronation—the significance of leadership comes alive. Though Queen Ada is only twenty-five years old, she has recently ascended to the throne of the glorious Kingdom at Turnbough. The Coronation Ceremony is held eight months after Queen Ada’s ascension to the throne. She is a young Queen but has the support of her mother, The Queen Mother, to help develop Queen Ada as a good and wise leader. This allegory reveals critical principles associated with leadership development and leadership effectiveness. The major theme of Ada’s Coronation is the significance of leadership. The minor themes deal with aspects such as leadership succession, leadership effectiveness, and leadership development.\n\nAs Queen Ada contemplates being crowned at The Coronation Ceremony, she reflectively explores the encounters of influential people and impressionable situations that have shaped her life and leadership ideology. Queen Ada is the heir apparent to the throne of the glorious Kingdom at Turnbough. However, having this birthright has not impeded her from reverently considering what is required to become an exemplar, both as The Queen and as an effective leader. During Queen Ada’s reflective exploration of how she desires to lead and what it means to be an exemplar, she insightfully contemplates how to best impact her people, along with the likely effects of transforming the Kingdom for future global interactions. A primary objective of The Queen is to ensure the people of the Kingdom at Turnbough are secure and well engaged by the Parliament. Thus, Queen Ada must rightly ascertain the best practices in decision making, both in assessing how to best protect the interests of her people, and how to deal with positive and negative challenges to her decisions. This allegory follows Queen Ada’s contemplative journey from the dawning of the momentous day up to her entrance procession into the Royal Westheimer Cathedral to attend The Coronation Ceremony.\n\nThe second half of this book includes a vibrant discussion regarding the significance of leadership, answering the call of leadership, and how leadership is developed. Considering the traditional views of leadership, up to today’s extensive research of leadership topics, this conversation on leadership reveals a need for future research of this topic. Why is leadership significant? Since the historical inception of the roles of leaders, the concept of leadership has been recognized as the necessary placement of persons inclined to take charge and guide groups of followers. However, leadership has traditionally operated according to the status quo. Today’s call of leadership promotes using innovation and transformative change to positively influence people and provide for the future sustainability of the organization. When leadership is constantly developed, then effective engaging and collaborations occur, which ultimately enhances the relationships between leaders and followers. Indeed, effective leadership wisely seeks to develop members across the entire organization to identify and promote future leadership. The beneficial outcomes of effective leadership are enumerable. As this discussion of the significance of leadership elucidates, the timeless considerations of becoming effective in leading the organization are necessary for creating an emerging impact in today’s global organizations.\n\nKey words: Allegory, Effective Leadership, Leadership Succession, Leadership Development, Transformational Leadership\n\nGender Equity in Engineering and Tech: Are Women Leaders the Solution to the Leaking Pipeline, Innovation, and Profitability?\n\nBelinda Mutoni | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThe issue of gender inequity in the male-dominated industry of engineering and technology (E&T) is massive today in contrast to the increase of graduation and recruitment of women engineers. Through interviews, books, industry publications, and journals, this publication will explain the barriers to gender equity in leadership in E&T. From personal experience, personal interviews, and research, I demonstrate the causal loop diagram (CLD) showing where gender equity in E&T leadership is today and the desired future state to develop corporate and public policies, procedures, and programs to mentor and promote into E&T leadership. The paper uses working examples of gender equity in leadership of public and private organizations to solve the gender inequity in E&T leadership. To fully understand how to reduce gender inequity in E&T, I interviewed leaders in E&T, researched other industries, and country policies that have succeeded in increasing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) to close the gender gap in leadership.\n\nThe paper starts with defining gender equity, gender equality, and the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) then translating the current state of gender equity in leadership. Next, I used interviews with industry leaders, research of other industries, and comparing country policies to identify the barriers to gender equity. I approach solving gender equity in E&T with three playbook steps addressed to executives and policy makers to close the gender gap. I conclude that achieving gender equity in E&T leadership will simultaneously develop the pipeline, innovation, and increase the bottom line for organizations.\n\nThe research findings used to create the playbook steps to gender equity in E&T leadership revealed gaps in areas of mentorship, family responsibilities, and leadership support as a continued barrier to gender equity. This paper and the accompanying lessons will provide succinct steps to support women and executives in E&T to support aspiring women leaders to reach their peak potential as they align with the organizational objectives and close the gender gap in leadership. Finally, I detailed the steps to achieve gender equity as a playbook for executives and policy makers to ignite a cultural change in E&T for more gender equity in executive leadership with the goal of increasing innovation and profit gains by tapping into the leadership talents of women.\n\nKeywords: Engineering and Technology (E&T) Leadership, Gender Equity, Gender Disparity, DEI (Diversity Equity & Inclusion), Mentorship\n\nDare to Dream Leadership Consulting Curriculum – A Systematic Development Program\n\nJames E. Owens Sr. | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nThis project is a curriculum based on my many years as a Gospel preacher for well over 30 years, served within the United States Army as a Sr. Non-Commissioned Officer for over 21 years, a father and husband for over 32 years. It is my passion and life’s calling to inspire, educate, and by practical application show the world that their dreams can become a reality!\n\nDreams are given and inspired by God. The Bible tells us, “And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh; your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions” (Joel 2:28; NIV). God actively speaks to us through our dreams and these dreams have scriptural meaning for our lives in order that we might discern God’s will and walk them out. God spoke to Joseph in a dream (Gen. 37:1-44); Jacob sees angels ascending and descending on a ladder between earth and heaven (Gen. 28:12); an angel tells Joseph the carpenter not to divorce Mary; her child is the Savior (Matt. 1:18-24). God uses our dreams and visions to bring instruction. God not only opens our ears, but also seals instruction through our dreams so that we are notified of our faults, counseled in the wrong direction, and given instruction on the best ways to move forward from the current circumstances that you are into a life filled with purpose and destiny!\n\nIn short, the Old Testament Prophet Jeremiah makes all simplistic into one sentence according to Jerimiah 29:11 “For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future (NKJV). In closing, it is within this manuscript curriculum that students, professors, businessmen, mothers, fathers, and people from all walks of life, can use what has been developed within these pages to endeavor to accomplish the unthinkable, to achieve the insurmountable, goliath challenges that come in the form of “A God-Given Dream!”\n\nThe Secret Sauce of Servant Leadership\n\nPeter Scheuermann | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nToday’s leaders often struggle with determining what the right path is for their leadership journey. What education, skillsets, requirements, and contacts should they develop to achieve leadership effectiveness and success? Where do leaders begin to find the right path or guide to achieve leadership success? Servant leadership is an approach everyone can apply both in their work and personal lives. Servant leadership is a leader’s complete focus on the follower, for their success and full benefit so much so, the leader will sacrifice their own personal gain and glory. While this approach to leadership is not the only method, everyone can improve by applying a few of its essential characteristics, making themselves more effective and successful in their leadership. This paper addresses these questions by reviewing leadership concepts and topics and identifying the required ingredients needed to develop the secret sauce of servant leadership for today’s modern leader to employ. This manuscript was born out of reading and studying several scholarly publications, academic research, and numerous books on organizational development, leadership theories, and practical application content.\n\nOver the last sixty years, servant leadership has emerged as one of the prominent leadership styles for leaders to adopt and employ for organizational success. However, the primary focus of servant leadership is not the success of the organization or the leader, but the follower or individual. Servant leadership focuses on the individual and their ability to grow every day, pursuing self-actualization, and experiencing a life changed for their greater good and all those around them. How is this accomplished given the billions of people who exist on the globe today? Love. Love of people. Love is this primary ingredient.\n\nThis manuscript is designed to help either a new leader just beginning in their leadership journey or someone who has been in leadership roles (people manager or project related) to quickly understand the topics and start employing recommended application actions and behaviors. These chapters in this manuscript are designed to serve as a launching pad to ignite and quickly start a leader down the path of servant leadership. Each chapter is structured with four sections. The first section provides a definition and summary overview of the concept, supported by scholarly research. The second section offers modern-day examples over the last century in individuals and organizations that lived or live out the idea or topic that everyone can relate to. This includes a brief insightful summary of the leader or known organization and the concept or topic they display. The third section is an in-person interview with someone who lives out these characteristics in their profession. Finally, the fourth section is a recommended practical application of the concept that the leader can employ in his or her organization. While this manuscript is written with a strong Christian and biblical perspective including references and examples, the goal is for all readers to gain understanding as to what servant leadership is, and how it can be applied and lived out in everyone’s life, no matter spiritual affiliation, position, financial status, or location. The following paragraphs provide a summary of each chapter presented in this manuscript.\n\nLeading from Within: Women Who Inspire\n\nJessica Schloemp | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nHow can anyone understand where they should be going without knowing where they have been. This book takes a closer look at the past, present, and future state of women in leadership through research, documentation, and personal experiences from the author. Women in leadership are underrepresented in many industries, especially the insurance industry. Leading from Within: Women Who Inspire takes a counter-cultural approach to women in leadership and provides encouragement and reassurance to women leaders. This topic oftentimes turns controversial, but throughout the book, readers will be challenged to get back to the basics of leadership practice, take the pride away from the argument, and lead from a pure selfless heart.\n\nInstead of degenerating the opposite sex as society likes to normalize, the book takes a positive approach and embraces what God gave you. One of our most prominent voices in society is social media, and our culture places it before all else. What is the truth? Where do women in leadership stand? The research and documentation provided will help shed light on these questions. In chapter three, it emphasizes honing in on your superpowers. God gave everyone their own superpowers, do not try to conform to someone else’s but lead through your own. The author provides helpful tips and tricks to assist leaders in improving their leadership techniques and strategies.\n\nThroughout the book, a biblical approach provides leaders with an outlook on how they should act and treat other people. In Galatians 3:28 it states “there is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.” The focused biblical approach is unapologetically positive and counter-cultural. Chapter four discusses how you can follow the word and not the world. Leaders cannot dehumanize what God intended for leadership but place faith in their journey with God. As you read through, you, too, can become an intentional advocate for the future of women in leadership.\n\nChampioning Organizational Wellness: Coaching Triangulation optimally positions leaders, aspiring leaders, and organizations to excel in global, multi-cultural landscapes\n\nAnthony Simmons | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nLeading amid g– lobal, multi-cultural landscapes requires organizations to embrace leadership development methodologies that are conducive to identifying with aspiring leaders (coachees) of disparate social, ethical, and cultural backgrounds. Under the current leadership constructs, organizations lack the wherewithal to impartially champion the careers of aspiring leaders owing to in-group favoritisms and ethical and cultural disconnects. These disparities serve as barriers to applying emotional intelligence (EI) to synthesize leaders and aspiring leaders of disparate backgrounds. To mitigate these impediments, leaders must sharpen their EI skills by self-assessing and navigating blind spots to identify and co-locate with aspiring leaders. Once the leaders and aspiring leaders are co-located, they can move symmetrically through a coaching triangle by leveraging a coaching conversation for empowerment and cultural homogeneity to optimally position the leader, aspiring leader, and the organization. This optimal position characterizes the performance apex for all three entities and represents organizational wellness. This book introduces a Coaching Triangulation methodology using an ends-means-ways operational design to champion this organizational wellness. The model is epochal in that a coach of any ethical, social, or cultural disposition can apply the framework to develop leaders of disparate cultures to sustain organizational wellness. Organizational wellness is the aggregate of organizational development and organizational sustainment.\n\nThe book consists of four Parts: Part I is the Introduction and Literature Review. Part II is the means which are Emotional Intelligence and Assessments, Navigating Blind Spots, and The Coaching Conversation. Part III is the ways which consist of Cultural Agnosticism and Empowerment through a Coaching Organization. Part IV is the conclusion which comprises the ends for Championing Organizational Wellness.\n\nChapter one offers an introduction which discusses leadership coaching, the problem it solves, and how the Coaching Triangulation methodology superimposed on the ends-means-ways operational design is appropriate for Championing Organizational Wellness amid disparate cultures. The model is catalyst to the leader and aspiring leader ascending symmetrically to achieve their performance apex for organizational wellness. Chapter two offers a Literature Review as the underpinning and overarching perspective on leadership coaching across global sectors.\n\nIn chapter three, the leadership coaches’ location is marked through the five components of EI and Self-assessments. Then chapter four expands on this location by helping the coach examine embedded Blind Spots that may have originated from EI and values deficiencies or misaligned values, generational disparities, cultural biases and disconnects, or ethnical behaviors. Once the distance between the leaders and aspiring leaders is determined, Chapter five illustrates the Coaching Conversation that allows the leader and aspiring to symmetrically move true north through intuitive listening, asking powerful questions, designing actions, and supporting the process. These three chapters exemplify the means for championing organizational wellness.\n\nChapters six, the first component of the ways for navigating the coaching triangle, highlights how to achieve Cultural Agnosticism through Cultural Ingratiation, Cultural Competence, and Culture Agility. Chapter seven offers the second component of the ways by illustrating how a Culture of Coaching empowers others through Servant-ship, Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership, and Democratized Leadership.\n\nThe book concludes in chapter eight by sharing how Championing Organizational Wellness is manifested through the aggregate of Organizational Development (OD) and Organizational Sustainment (OS). It provides the blueprint for achieving OD by applying Strategic Communications and Strategic Human Resource Development processes, while OS is realized through the application of Coach-Protégé Programs and Intermediate Performance Reviews. In additional to Championing Organizational Wellness, this Coaching Triangulation model concludes with a high-performance leadership continuum that culminates into an autonomous leadership succession plan.\n\nLeadership and Organizational Politics: How to Win Office Politics and Gain Advantage in a Competitive Environment\n\nEmmanuel O. Sobande | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nPolitics plays out in every area of human endeavor. Wherever there are two or more people, politics—and as a direct result, conflict—is inevitable. There are differences in personality, leadership style, culture, and value system that make this so. Accordingly, personalities will often clash in organizations where this diversity is inevitable. However, individuals, I mean leaders, can manage clashes effectively.\n\nLike it or not, no office or organization is free from politics. Man is, by nature, a political being. Thus, he is innately wired to compete, so, naturally, there will be politics, competition, and conflict between two or more people. Politics is about who gets what, when, and how. It is about how scarce resources are allocated. Experience tells us that ‘political skills’ are essential for survival in any organization. Some people do not survive in certain situations because they are unable to navigate office politics despite being talented, hard-working, and having the best intentions.\n\nThis book fills an important gap in the literature on leadership development programs in organizations. Most of the existing literature omits lessons on leadership conceptions of followership; the focus is on educating, training, and developing the leader, not the follower, the superior, not the subordinate. Also, most leadership development programs fail to reckon that leadership is a process of influence that involves an ongoing transaction between a leader and followers. Each of whom was likely to shift from being in the role of a leader to being a follower. The key to effective leadership is building a harmonious relationship between leaders and followers. Though most attention is given to the leader, leadership depends on more than one person to achieve group goals. Therefore, the followers and the leader are vital to understanding leadership development as a process. Thus, the book considers leadership development from a follower’s perspective and attempts to provide answers to relatable questions\n\nIt is targeted at people across all spectrums of life: positional leaders in corporate and non-corporate spaces, employees, managers, and even entrepreneurs who want to take the lead in their field, and as many people who want to understand how to manage organizational politics without getting sucked into its murky unpleasantness.\n\nThe War for Your Worth: My Life-Long Battle with Substance, Sex, and Success Addiction\n\nR. Michael Thornton | 2022\n\nAbstract\n\nAddiction is still a massive threat to families in America. Nearly every government initiative to rid our nation of this problem has failed. Trillions have been spent. Policies have been made, and laws have been passed. This invisible enemy has taken more lives than terrorist attacks over the last 50 years. Still, we continually see addiction destroy so many lives in this country. Addiction is not a political problem. It’s a heart problem that is both complex and complicated. It goes beyond illegal substances and moves into behavioral addictions, which are equally damaging.\n\nDefeating addiction begins by seeing it from different perspectives. The reality is that addiction has many faces. Substance abuse is only one side of the coin. Seeing it from different perceptions helps people discover that addiction is never about the substances or the attachments they gravitate to but about the alignment of their identity. The war on addiction is the war for what people allow to define their self-perception, worth, and value. The substances, the attachments, or even the relationships only serve as bait. When we recognize addiction on this level, we realize it goes far beyond substance abuse and strikes at the core of who people are.\n\nThis book unpacks this conversation in greater detail through my healing journey concerning addiction. For years I battled the multiple faces addiction has to offer, including an addiction to illegal substances, pornography, and my line of work which happened to be ministry. Millions of Americans and leaders struggle with some of these same issues. Unfortunately, stories of long-term healing and redemption over these types of addiction are few and far between. This book is unique because it offers inspiration and practical tools to help people walk in the freedom I have discovered. It includes research, personal experience, explosive personal testimonies, and pathways to help escort people out of bondage and into a state of freedom.\n\nMy purpose in writing this book is to show addiction from different viewpoints than what is usually conveyed. Seeing addiction from different lenses helps us define it with more clarity. I have a deep passion for preparing leaders, especially Christian leaders, to recognize addiction for what it is and help them walk out a pathway of healing from it. This book covers the top three habits that every leader will face at some point in their life—an addiction to substances, sex, or success. Whatever addiction you struggle with the most, this book provides hope, redemption, and practical applications.\n\nBringing the Ministry to the Industry: Mirroring Christ in Work\n\nTomorrow Allen-Collins | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nMost of us ask, at some point or another, why we are created. Whether we ask God, others, or wonder, our purpose is something that intrigues each of us at some point in our lives. Perhaps it is a coincidence that many of us tend to inquire about our purpose at work, and maybe it’s not. Work is an intentional fabric in each of our lives. Logic and connection don’t need an invitation for most people to feel fulfilled. However, the perceived absence of logic and connection tends to make us feel useless and lost, especially relative to our work. As Christians, our job is much bigger than us, whether we see the initial connection or not. Not only does God expect us to work, but as a representative of him, we are required to lead in whatever work we do.\n\nThe book, Bringing the Ministry to the Industry: Mirroring Christ in Work, provides Christians in the workplace with a base to fulfill the inquiry of why we’re here on earth, our role, and how we can successfully perform that role in daily work. Insights about leadership and service are shared and connected to the life of Christ while he walked the earth. The distinction made between Christians and non-Christians in the workplace is Christ alone. Our clothes look the same, our jobs appear similar, and even our sentiments match. However, because of Christ, the outcome and display of our day-to-day tasks are distinct. Acknowledging that our walk with God at work can be challenging yet successful is the overall theme. Practical insights and guidance are provided to help Christians successfully navigate the workspace after we say “I do” to God and his master plan. This book provides biblical and modern examples of leadership at work despite the job title.\n\nKeywords: Leadership, Work, Purpose, Transformation, Service\n\nFocus on What Matters: An Executive’s Guide to Simplifying Organizational Design and Creating a Culture of Performance\n\nKimberly Askew | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nAn organization’s people, internal processes, and ability to plan well for the future all play crucial roles in determining its success. Yet, organizational design is rarely top of mind for today’s executives. Instead, as leaders, we have become bogged down with nuance and minute details, often turning to the latest management techniques to remedy the issues we face. In doing so, organizational leaders may be addressing the symptoms of a problem rather than the issue.\n\nThe publication, Focus on What Matters: An Executive’s Guide to Simplifying Organizational Design and Creating a Culture of Performance offers a different perspective that suggests business leaders must focus their attention on only three things. It proposes a new design of an organizational structure referred to as the P3 model, which consists of three dimensions: people, processes, and planning. The ‘ACE’ framework also outlined in this publication seeks to evaluate each of these components of organizational design for alignment. This model requires that leaders assess the challenge at hand, communicate the necessary change, and execute the proposed solution quickly and systematically. In this way, it positions organizational design as a management tool, fully accounting for the impact of the design model on organizational culture. More importantly, it specifically seeks to create a high-performance culture that governs every aspect of the work.\n\nThis book aims to drive home the point that alignment among the three dimensions of organizational design must be achieved if a high-performance culture is to be developed. It offers a step-by-step guide on why they matter and how you can maneuver each component to work in tandem to move an organization towards operating at peak performance. The unique blending of the P3 and ‘ACE’ models explore the intersection between organizational design and organizational culture, serving as a framework that helps executive leaders relate well to challenges facing those in the C-Suite and offers highly hands-on solutions and recommendations. It is a reminder to organizational leaders that when chaos ensues, and it inevitably will, to take a step back and focus on what matters. People. Processes. Planning. Everything else is secondary.\n\nMinistry Leadership Development Workshop\n\nKayon Cameron | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nA non-profit, faith-based organization is the same as a for-profit corporation contingent on its employees’ and volunteers’ well-being to achieve the organization’s overall goal. Fortune 500 companies understand the importance of investing in their personnel’s leadership development. Unfortunately, some non-profit, faith-based organizations do not see the practical value of investing in their personnel’s leadership development. Leadership development is critical for the organization to align its personnel with its vision and create effective teams to see all tasks done thoroughly from start to finish. Leadership development is a critical resource proven to align all personnel within an organization to collectively share resources to collectively achieve the organization’s goals. Church leaders care for their congregants’ spiritual well-being but neglect the importance of investing in their employees and volunteers. The Ministry Leadership Development Workshop is a resource that Christian faith-based organizations can use to invest in their personnel’s leadership development.\n\nThe Ministry Leadership Development Workshop will challenge the employee and volunteer participants of a Christian faith-based organization about what constitutes an effective leader, effective communicator, and an effective team. The workshop focuses on self-development for the participants to realize their strengths and weaknesses in these areas of study while understanding that God has provided tools and resources through his word on becoming an effective leader, communicator, and team builder. The participants will understand how they view their identity impacts their effectiveness as a leader because they will project unto their team how they view their strengths and weaknesses. The participants will learn their strengths and weaknesses in communication, and to become effective communicators, they must learn to be others-focused rather than self-focused when communicating.\n\nLastly, the participants will learn the importance of building relationships between themselves and their team, organization, and the individuals within their team through humility, love, and trust. The workshop results proved that it is effective in challenging the participants’ views of the truth about leadership, areas they can improve on communication, and the importance of a team having a relationship with each other. Upon completing the Ministry Leadership Development Workshop, the organization can better relate to the participant and emphasize their evaluability to the organization to achieve its overall goal.\n\nStrategic Foresight Curricula for United States Coast Guard Leadership Development\n\nAndrew L. Cavins | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nThe United States Coast Guard (USCG) excels at preparing its members for a wide range of highly complex missions. The USCG’s Force Readiness Command (FORCECOM) and its group of training units across the nation are responsible for identifying gaps between a broad spectrum of observed and desired skills and competencies and providing training interventions to fill those gaps. Although the USCG commits significant resources toward high-quality training and development opportunities in most of the Office of Leadership’s (CG-128) twenty-eight leadership competencies, the twenty-eighth competency, Strategic Thinking, has relatively less in terms of dedicated, formal education and training opportunities.\n\nOn another level, the USCG has made headway over the last two decades in utilizing strategic foresight practices to formulate strategic policies. Yet, outside of the small unit responsible for this mission, strategic foresight as a field of study and a methodology for developing strategic thinking in leadership is largely unknown. Research indicates that most military officers are not exposed to leadership development in strategic foresight until they approach the flag officer level and that training is needed in earlier stages of career development to maximize its potential (Zalman, 2019).\n\nThis project sought to fill two critical gaps: (1) Provide formal leadership development curricula targeting the Strategic Thinking competency and (2) provide formal leadership development curricula for a deep-immersion introduction to some of the fundamental principles, methods, tools, and techniques of strategic foresight. Upon a series of strategic discussions, stakeholders decided the ideal schoolhouse for leveraging these curricula and introducing strategic foresight into the USCG’s culture would be in FORCECOM’s Leadership Development Center (LDC). The LDC’s Mid-Grade Officer Career Transition Course (MOCTC-2), a forty-seven-week facilitated online training (FOT) course with a two-week residency, provided the best opportunity to deliver this training solution.\n\nThe proposed Strategic Foresight Unit that this project produced is comprised of six lessons: (1) Introduction to Strategic Foresight, (2) Systems Dynamics, (3) Social Change, (4) Strategic Foresight Tools & Techniques, (5) Scenario Planning, and (6) Anticipatory Management. Each lesson is designed to be delivered online via any of the USCG’s preferred learning management systems (LMS). Students are immersed in the field of strategic foresight and engage with their peers in each lesson to produce real strategic foresight products to potentially propose to the USCG’s official strategic foresight group. Upon completing the course, students will have demonstrated each individual component of the USCG’s Strategic Thinking competency, as well as have been introduced to critical foresight competencies that leaders across the world are pursuing.\n\nGods Prophetic Strategy (GPS): A Blueprint for Building Leaders\n\nAlexis S. Crawford | 2021\n\nAbstract\n\nA blueprint is a plan that, when followed appropriately, the outcome resembles the architect’s original intent. God has a blueprint for every person. God’s plan results from His infinite wisdom and power to construct humankind according to His purpose strategically and for His pleasure. Blueprints serve as guides to implement by laying out sequential steps to deliver services. They help those charged with implementing the plan to get on the same page. When a project or service goes wrong or a related question, it serves as an instruction guide to discerning the answer.\n\nThis blueprint is written for emerging and growing leaders in ministry, organizations, and businesses to increase leadership capacity from a Christian perspective. The blueprint integrates leadership development work and learning experiences based on scripture. Leadership passages are drawn from 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus: qualifications, characteristics, and the qualities necessary for excellent leadership. These elements inspire personal, group, and team growth and development, empowerment, and mentoring. Psalms 1:1-3 and 91 lay a backdrop that describes the way of the Christian leader and details of righteous leadership as a precursor to the leadership information in Parts one through three.\n\nOrdinarily, when the acronym GPS is seen, it suggests the Global Positioning System that provides reliable positioning, location, navigation, and time information anywhere in the world. It also does so in all weather conditions 24/7. That system gives clear directions if there is an unobstructed sightline to the GPS satellites. It is an amazing system that helps find lost and rescued people, helps pilots navigate and find their destination anywhere globally, and countless others find their way to specific goals.\n\nGPS technology is fantastic. However, God’s genius far exceeds man’s technology. The Holy Spirit provides God’s Prophetic Strategy because He is God. He is a member of the Trinity and does not change. He is the helper who comes alongside the Christian and ministers the Word of God. When Christians get into God’s Word, He teaches what needs to be known and understood (1 Tim. 2:15). His voice directs and corrects if we will listen and heed His voice.\n\nGPS technology is fantastic. However, God’s genius far exceeds man’s technology. The Holy Spirit provides God’s Prophetic Strategy because He is God. He is a member of the Trinity and does not change. He is the helpe"
