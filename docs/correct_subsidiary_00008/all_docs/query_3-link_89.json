        "text": "University of California, Irvine\n\nRia Marie Carlson forges partnerships to benefit a wide array of publics\n\nAt University of California, Irvine, Ria Marie Carlson rebranded the university’s identity, helped bring global companies to the UCI Research Park and crafted messaging that drew Barack Obama as a commencement speaker. She deserves her place in the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWhen she arrived at the University of California, Irvine, Ria Marie Carlson had a vision and a goal: for UCI to be recognized as one of the world’s finest universities. Bringing more than 20 years of experience at publicly traded corporations, Carlson offered a fresh perspective to the world of higher education.\n\nCarlson leads UCI’s Office of Strategic Communications and Public Affairs, providing internal and external communications services for an institution the size of a small city, with some 30,000 students, 22,000 employees, 16 schools and a medical center with a 500,000-square-foot hospital and trauma center.\n\nAs chief communications officer, Carlson rebranded the university, differentiating it from others to broaden its reach and visibility. A national advertising campaign and a global media relations program garnered top-tier coverage of the project. The media relations effort spotlighted groundbreaking UCI research programs in local, national and international media markets, and continues to showcase the work of UCI’s faculty, students and staff.\n\nCarlson played a pivotal role in developing the messaging and outreach strategies that convinced former President Barack Obama to address the UCI class of 2014 graduates. During his 30-minute speech, Obama highlighted UCI’s ambitions and innovations, including its commitment to tackling climate change with science-based, actionable solutions, and UCI’s Nobel Prize-winning professor-student duo whose research led to better understanding of climate change. The speech earned national and international media attention.\n\nCarlson also creates partnerships that benefit UCI’s Orange County community. She worked with private real estate firm The Irvine Company to rebrand University Research Park, a 185-acre workplace community, as UCI Research Park; it’s now home to Intel, Cisco and more of some of the world’s most influential companies.\n\nThe partnership allows students and faculty to work and form relationships with both global corporations and pioneering startups. Carlson has also formed partnerships with California State University, Fullerton, Santa Ana Unified School district and Santa Ana Community College.\n\nU.S. Sugar\n\nJudy Clayton Sanchez helps neighbors feed neighbors with U.S. Sugar\n\nJudy Clayton Sanchez’s work with U.S. Sugar and within her community is making lasting change. Her dedication and efforts have earned her a well-deserved spot in Ragan’s Women in Communications Hall of Fame in our Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nJudy Clayton Sanchez grew up in and around farms in the South, a background that made her uniquely qualified for her position as senior director of corporate communications and public affairs for U.S. Sugar. With her ability to communicate the complex processes involved in farming to the general public, Clayton Sanchez manages all media for U.S. Sugar. In an industry dominated by men, “she is not only a mentor to other women, but she also earns the respect of the men with whom she works,” said Jeanmarie Ferrara, EVP of Wragg & Casas.\n\nHaving worked for U.S. Sugar since 1993, Clayton Sanchez has become an authority on her subject, and is respected for both her communications skills and dedication to the sugar industry.\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, Clayton Sanchez initiated the community campaign “Neighbors Feeding Neighbors.” She’s seen to it that U.S. Sugar has made donations within their community, including the purchase of new band uniforms for a local school. As former member of the South Florida Water Management District’s Water Resources Advisory Commission, she also works to ensure several cities in Florida have access to clean water, highlighting her commitment to local causes.\n\nPalm Beach County Commissioner Melissa McKinlay says, “Judy is a leader among her peers in the communications world, and our rural farming region has benefited significantly because of her strong voice. Her vast knowledge and skill in educating people about the importance of agriculture has served our community very well over the years.” Congratulations to Judy Clayton Sanchez.\n\n—SD\n\nRoyal Caribbean Group\n\nRosanna Fiske’s career spans the world of corporations, education and the nonprofit sector\n\nRosanna Fiske has led executive searches, helmed the PRSA and counseled college students in the PR field. That puts her in the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nRosanna Fiske currently serves as Royal Caribbean Group’s global chief communications officer, making her responsible for, among other things, internal communications for more than 80,000 employees. But she has worn many hats throughout her PR career, overseeing product launches, managing crisis communications and handling strategic planning initiatives both domestically and internationally.\n\nFiske has served as CEO and chair of the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) — the first Latina CEO in the organization’s 70-plus-year history. As chair of PRSA’s first National Diversity Committee, she created a first-of-its-kind Diversity Toolkit to guide national, district, chapter and section leaders in promoting greater inclusivity. The toolkit became an essential document for research studies and training manuals inside and outside the PR profession.\n\nDuring her tenure as a professor at Florida International University’s School of Communication and Journalism, Fiske led a team that refocused and rebranded the master’s program in global strategic communications. She also developed a recruitment strategy to attract more qualified students, doubling the number of applicants within 18 months and increasing student enrollment by nearly 40%.\n\nFiske’s commitment to mentoring and career counseling at FIU influenced many students’ lives. One student contacted her for advice on what track to take: creative development or account management? Fiske suggested PR classes and PRSA meetings, and also counseled her; the student completed two internships and got a job offer immediately after graduation.\n\nFiske’s commitment to diversity is evident in the more than 100 conferences and seminars about diversity, inclusion and multiculturalism she has participated in.\n\nShe has also volunteered her time and expertise to helping nonprofits recruit candidates for executive leadership roles. For the Beacon Council, a public and private nonprofit agency supporting minority-owned businesses in Miami Dade, Fiske served as search committee chair as the council looked for a new CMO. She also contributed to the creation of an executive search process for a new executive director of the Washington D.C.-based arm of the National Education Association.\n\nWestinghouse Electric Company\n\nMarta Ronquillo Newhart spearheaded a challenging project to lead a clean energy revolution\n\nFor Westinghouse, Marta Ronquillo Newhart was tasked with making nuclear energy part of the solution to climate change. She used the talents and experience that have put her into the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs a newly appointed chief communications officer to a recently appointed CEO at a company emerging from Chapter 11, Marta Ronquillo Newhart found herself working in a highly regulated and misunderstood industry with a skeleton crew of a marketing communications team when she took the reins of the iconic Westinghouse brand in spring 2020.\n\nNewhart’s assignment at Westinghouse Electric Company was to lead a clean energy revolution with a new purpose statement, visual brand identity and website that depicted the ability of nuclear energy to empower the world safely and sustainably. Making an already challenging assignment more difficult, the Westinghouse brand is owned by CBS, but Westinghouse Electric Company is owned by a private equity firm.\n\nDespite these constraints, Newhart worked to amplify the voice of Westinghouse and the nuclear industry. As a result of her efforts, politicians, big thinkers like Bill Gates and young energy activists are starting to think of nuclear power as a reliable and resilient component of the clean energy equation.\n\nNewhart began repositioning the brand under already challenging market and ownership circumstances just as the COVID-19 pandemic began. Despite the obstacles, Newhart worked to rebuild and reshape her team into a premiere international marketing communications function remotely. She and her new team quickly went to work, creating a new brand identity, narrative and storytelling strategy to bridge the gap between Westinghouse and its stakeholders.\n\nOften the first or only Latina in a top position, Newhart, who has an MBA from Pepperdine University, focuses on uncovering and articulating complex issues to prompt understanding, acceptance and action. She has built her reputation on developing and nurturing diverse groups of strategic storytellers who employ marketing and communications to generate revenue.\n\nNewhart believes communications is a great equalizer: “If you are creative and understand the power of words, building brands and connecting with consumers you will be successful—especially if someone takes the time to show you the way,” she says.\n\nSimmons University\n\nBec Rollins travels the world to help people and share their humanity\n\nPathfinder International’s chief communications officer is also a talented photojournalist and visual storyteller—and a member of the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nYou might see Bec Rollins in a cholera treatment center in Mirebalais or a pediatric cancer ward in Butaro, perhaps not noticing her among her fellow mothers and friends there. Back at Pathfinder International’s office in Boston, her stories wouldn’t center on what she saw or did, but on what she captured with her camera. In the portrait of a mother and her child you would see an entire life story, often painful but still hopeful, and maybe understand a little more of your own story as well.\n\nPathfinder International is a global health organization devoted to supporting the rights of women to make their own reproductive health decisions. Rollins, Pathfinder’s chief communications officer, is a skilled photojournalist and visual storyteller who works tirelessly to ensure that organizations acknowledge, name, celebrate, and faithfully collaborate with the same people who are the subjects of Pathfinder’s marketing and fundraising communications.\n\nRollins has taken this approach for 30 years. During international crisis responses, like the Ebola outbreak in West Africa or the flooding disaster in Peru, her work has demonstrated that the most effective stories show how much people of all stripes depend on each other, and that no matter how big the crowd is, every face has a name worth knowing. It’s a perspective that’s rubbed off on CEOs and board members throughout her career,\n\nEven now, though, as a seasoned executive, she devotes much of her time to mentoring the youngest and least experienced people around her. In depicting people with truth and kindness, Rollins always finds room for teaching and learning.\n\nIntel\n\nMelissa Beers excelled at speedy rollout of new comms channels at Intel\n\nMelissa Beers, channels strategist at Intel, rolled out two brand-new communications channels in just six months. The bridges she built throughout Intel stretch from the technical tools the organization makes and uses to the people who put them through their real-world paces. To launch both channels, she needed organizational, technical and people skills to all come together. Her efforts led to recognition as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nTaking on additional work on top of her job title led Melissa Beers to success. As well as serving as a communication channels strategist, she launched two new communications platforms. Both platforms launched on time, replacing an end-of-life channel and saving the company time and money. The new platforms are mobile responsive, branded and available on desktop and mobile. After six weeks, more than 105,000 employees had registered on the new mobile platform.\n\nHer work launching the new channels included bringing together stakeholders and employees from IT, the vendor, communicators on her team and across the company. First, she set up a steering committee to align company-wide communications governance and reduce confusion. She took stock of what embedded communicators needed and wanted from their tools. From there, she worked with two vendors and two IT groups on the rollout. She made sure all 100+ communicators who would work on the new platforms were up to speed and organized a global contest, swag, and welcome parties to make the change into an exciting, morale-boosting occasion.\n\nWorking as a liaison between people and the tech that can improve their work and life is a process of iteration. Beers’ bedrock for this process is gathering input from those using the tool, testing her understanding of the use cases to understand if a solution is viable for the user. Next, she does research to understand the end user experience. By using this process of rigorous knowledge, in-depth research, and talking to real people, she uses tech to meet employees where their needs are.\n\n—MC\n\nHIMSS\n\nLeia Lovely Bradford brings a keen sense for human connection to communications\n\nLeia Lovely Bradford, MSc, program manager of strategic communications at HIMSS, brings her experience with recruitment to communications. From connecting to the media to attracting and retaining talent, it’s all about the human element. Her efforts have landed her among the Bridge Builders in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAt the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), the theme of Leia Lovely Bradford’s career has been supporting clear and valuable communication among individuals with different but connected goals. Her ability to build bridges has been shown in her recruitment work, where she prioritizes continuous and effective communication. She took the skills she learned in recruitment to the planning and execution of press activities for the HIMSS Global Conference & Exhibition press room. Other accomplishments this year include:\n\nCoordinating press welcome activities, special events and onsite support for the conference\n\nStrategically crafting content to actively engage internal and external audiences\n\nDeveloping new and effective ways to connect press with upcoming products, services and events\n\nStaying up to date with industry trends\n\nEngaging with press with appropriate beats to provide a platform that elevate HIMSS in the media\n\nFor Lovely Bradford, building bridges is only the first step. The second, and more important step, is to get people to actually step onto them and walk across. This focus on moving people to action while building trust has brought her success in her seven years with HIMSS. She knows a large part of problem-solving is about forming meaningful bonds with people that make them want to solve the problem and help them understand how the solution will help.\n\n—MC\n\nARUP Laboratories\n\nLisa Carricaburu successfully managed change during pandemic\n\nLisa Carricaburu, director of marketing communications and clinical decision support at ARUP Laboratories, earns recognition as one of our Bridge Builders in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications for building bridges in a hard time. Stepping into a higher leadership position in the thick of the pandemic, she improved the organization’s media mentions and exceeded event participation goals by more than nine times.\n\nNonprofit national reference laboratory ARUP Laboratories was a critical part of the COVID-19 response. As a testing facility, it saw an influx of COVID-19 testing. In response, Lisa Carricaburu’s communications team took things in hand. Carricaburu thrived under pressure, receiving a promotion to director of marketing communications and clinical decision support in October 2020. She pioneered a virtual Lab Leadership Symposium to improve ARUP’s reputation, which brought in more than 950 people after setting a modest goal of 100 participants. Under her leadership, media mentions grew to more than 181 between March and October 2020. Her 29 news releases over the next year generated another 138 mentions.\n\nDuring the pandemic in particular, she organized the creation of external COVID-19 testing information and resource pages for health-care clients and the public. These involved making, highly technical, scientific content that required extensive review and vetting by medical directors compelling and readable. Carricaburu steered this effort successfully, as the pages have drawn over 200,000 views. She also oversaw 15 COVID-19-related podcasts, 50+ company articles, and 11 educational webinars or videos.\n\nIf the pandemic wasn’t enough of a change, Carricaburu was also faced with promoting positive messages around the retirement of the CEO and president and the opening of a new facility. Set for June 2021, both were changed from virtual to in-person under her supervision as pandemic restrictions lifted.\n\nInternally, she faced the challenge of unfavorable employee perceptions of leadership. To counter this, she oversaw the creation of first a regular CEO email, a leadership feedback portal and COVID-19 intranet pages. Plus, she established a central review team for communications quality control in support of the organization’s marketing writers. With pressure on the organization, she used all her expertise to support her employees and make the labs a trusted authority in the eyes of the public.\n\n—MC\n\nRobert Bosch LLC\n\nAlissa Cleland handles connections throughout a global, multi-billion-dollar organization\n\nAlissa Cleland, vice president of corporate communications and government affairs, Americas and Australia at Robert Bosch LLC, works as a bridge builder as her voice reaches across the U.S. and international employees. From podcasts to presentations to leadership, she makes herself heard with a global reach. She has been recognized as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAlissa Cleland’s reach at technology company Bosch is global. As a leader in the company’s communications and government affairs activities in North America, South America and Australia, she needs to build bridges between technology and the human element. navigating complex topics within the highest levels to drive the right communication strategy.\n\nShe took the lead on the creation of the company’s first two podcasts for current and former employees. That includes “From Know How to Wow,” the organization’s first international podcast.\n\nDuring COVID-19, Cleland juggled an internal communication strategy centering around empathy, authenticity, transparency and external efforts focused on business continuity. She featured regular associate messages from the organization president, promotions around health and safety protocol, and a toolkit to support communication at more than 100 locations. Her external strategies closely engaged with trade organizations and local communities, preserving essential work at the company’s manufacturing plants.\n\nThe company and her coworkers express their trust in her in a variety of ways, including seeking her expertise in her capacity as a member of the N.A. Executive Committee, Benefits Committee and Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Council. She’s also a member of the company’s global executive council for communications and government affairs, where she leads international project teams. What else displays building bridges but encouraging global cooperation within a complex, multi-billion-dollar organization?\n\nDuring the pandemic, she also spoke to the global executive leadership team on the topic “Leading in the New Normal.” Going forward, she is confidently driving the company through its post-pandemic cultural evolution.\n\n—MC\n\nXero\n\nKaren Davis tripled the size of her communications team to build not just bridges, but avenues\n\nAs executive general manager of communications at Xero, Karen Davis helped transform the organization. From proving herself to a CTO “unconvinced about the value of communications” to punching with the strength of a much larger company, she has more than proved the worth of her work. Her efforts have landed her among the Bridge Builder honorees in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs a cloud-based accounting software company, Xero is all about making day-to-day work easier for small businesses. When Karen Davis first arrived at the organization in 2018, it needed some streamlining of its own. While the company was successful and expanding globally, it needed a bridge-builder when it came to communications in particular. The communications team was understaffed, underfunded and not globally aligned with a headquarters function. Davis brought her experience with former employers PwC and IBM into play quickly, transforming how the company looked at communications and showing what a difference a strong, aligned team made.\n\n“When Karen arrived at Xero, it’s safe to say I was personally unconvinced about the value of communications,” said Mark Rees, Chief Technology Officer, Xero. “In a remarkably brief period of time, Karen turned that around — showing me the difference a high-caliber communications team can deliver as my organization drives a sweeping change management program that touches every aspect of Xero’s technology infrastructure. I’m a believer, an advocate, and I consider Karen a most trusted advisor.”\n\nDespite the challenges of growing an organization during COVID-19 or the difficulty of hiring and retaining employees today, Davis made the case for the power of good communications professionals and got the leadership buy-in to triple the size of the communications team.\n\nSome of her accomplishments addressed today’s urgent climate transformation. She created a new social and environmental impact strategy and team, as well as launching Xero’s environmental impact program. Her efforts drove the company to achieve a net zero energy certification from the Australian government.\n\n“Karen Davis took a small communication team and engineered a strategic function that can compete on equal footing with any platform company, including companies that are many times larger than Xero,” said Rachael Powell, Chief Customer Officer at Xero. “The transformation reflects her personal leadership on two levels: the coaching and mentoring of a team that punches well over its weight, and her ability to create trusted relationships across our C-Suite and Board.”\n\n—MC\n\nSWM International\n\nMary Gibson brings SWM International’s varied facets together\n\nFor Mary Gibson, director of Enterprise & Brand Communications at SWM International, a lot was riding on the company’s 25th anniversary. How to bring disparate parts of a widely distributed organization together? She brought the message into the spotlight — and all during the pandemic. These efforts led to recognition as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nLike many people, Mary Gibson had grand plans for 2020 that needed to rapidly change in the face of the pandemic. For SWM International, it was already a year of transformation. The company’s 25th anniversary as a standalone public company was coming in November, and the goal was to focus employee messaging around unity. As SWM International includes a legacy company and multiple new acquisitions, showing the employees how the different areas of the company were alike was key for morale and a feeling of continuity and long-term success.\n\nEven though they couldn’t hold planned events in person, the COVID-19 versions of the celebration were very successful. A month-long employee campaign in June 2020 themed around the anniversary drove a 14% increase in traffic on the intranet. LinkedIn posts created for the occasion received more than 12,000 impressions.\n\nWhen SWM International acquired UK public company Scapa Group Plc, it could have emphasized to employees that SWM is made up of splintered, loosely connected acquired companies. Instead, Gibson had the messaging in hand to bring Scapa smoothly into the fold. She ran a team of internal and external experts as they shaped a global celebratory launch for the new company. Its tagline: “Greater Together.” The team created a signature graphic for Teams backdrops, digital screens, posters and other materials, an email from the CEO with a video message, a SWM + Scapa sizzle video, and a video of employees sharing selfies from all around the new company.\n\nSince then, the “Greater Together” theme has been expanded to a wide variety of employee communications. In 2022, the team hopes to continue to illustrate the company’s shared purpose for external communications.\n\n—MC\n\nAmazon\n\nLeslie Letts headlines Amazon’s far-reaching global communications team\n\nAs global director of internal communications and community engagement at Amazon’s Worldwide Communications team, Leslie Letts helps keep the company’s products and services moving. In addition to coming into a new role just as COVID-19 hit the United States in March 2020, she has also overseen several high-profile product releases in the course of her storied career. Her works has earned her recognition as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs a leader in Amazon’s Worldwide Communications team, Leslie Letts is a bridge between corporate and the company’s hundreds of thousands of front-line employees. As supply chains, economies and daily life have felt the impact and the aftershocks of COVID-19, she has had to stand strong in her efforts to continue delivering uninterrupted communications, sharing important corporate updates to employees across the globe and bringing critical storytelling and notifications to internal and external audiences. Her reach extends to Amazon’s frontline employees and managers across 15 countries.\n\nShe led from the front as Amazon Operations’ global director of internal communications & community engagement since March 2020, starting in the pivotal time at which Americans were realizing the pandemic was going to change the way work, daily life and the global economy functioned.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, her priorities were to keep employees up-to date on COVID safety measures and protocols, making sure they were well-informed on what’s happening at work every day, and most importantly, felt supported by the company. Identifying, creating, ramping up and deploying these communications to a massive global audience takes experience, skill, organization, determination and the ability to build bridges. Whether those bridges are between employees and departments in different countries or between the day pandemic restrictions are called and the day they are lifted, Amazon Worldwide Communications trusts Letts to get the job done.\n\n—MC\n\nBellmont Partners\n\nBridget Nelson Monroe supports community during tough times\n\nBellmont Partners put forward public relations professional Bridget Monroe for the Top Women in Communications award as a Bridge Builder. She rose to the occasion during COVID-19, bringing her experience in journalism and a commitment to nonprofits to her effective strategies.\n\nBridget Nelson Monroe’s bridges stretch from the very beginning of Bellmont Partners. As one of the first employees, she knows the 18-person business inside and out. During her tenure, Bellmont Partners was named a Best Workplace by Inc. Magazine for three years in a row. In more than three years, no employees have left the company. Monroe runs weekly all-team Zoom huddles, launched the agency’s e-newsletter, co-led the creation of the Diversity, Inclusion & Antiracism Committee and led the creation of the COVID-19 office reopening plan. She was promoted to partner in May as a result of her many years of productive effort. Like many people in the industry, Monroe’s career also features a bridge between journalism and public relations.\n\nShe has also made a big impact on her community. As a leader of the agency’s nonprofit practice group, her work benefits dozens of Minnesota-based nonprofit clients and the people under their care. She helped her clients, including two of the state’s largest nonprofits, pivot to pandemic precautions during COVID-19. Her everyday work also helped organizations on the front lines with messaging, crisis communications, remotely produced podcasts, digital advertising and Facebook Live town halls. Some of these were, by necessity, quick-turn, new-for-the-client solutions taking advantage of online connections in a time when in-person meetings were unsafe.\n\nShe also had a hand in the Bellmont Gives Back initiative, which provides employees with the time and resources necessary to support community organizations and causes important to them. In 2020, team members contributed 809 hours to 53 organizations during the work week. With Monroe’s wealth of experience, she is a cornerstone of Bellmont Partners.\n\n—MC\n\nCNSI\n\nJanice Moore gives back to her community in a time of change\n\nJanice Moore, internal communications manager at health information technology company CNSI, came in on the ground floor as CNSI was creating a new mission and values. She made the difficult COVID-19 period a time of positive change, finding creative methods to promote the organization’s values. Plus, her efforts to increase employee giving brought in $25,000 for a local food drive and earned her recognition as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nJanice Moore faced a challenge: joining CNSI. She needed to write internal communications for a team that had gone through many changes, with a new management team, vision and mission at the same time as people were starting to work from home. That meant that she needed to build bridges within the organization quickly to create coherence in a time of change. She helped the company create an intentional focus around its newly forged values.\n\nIn addition to creating a mission, a vision, a values relaunch campaign, using multimedia and elevating voices of employees at all levels of the company, she also developed creative ways to show off the new values. The company designed T-shirts with each of the values. From there, employees could pick their favorite and have the shirt shipped to them. Janice was also instrumental in designing digital backgrounds for video calls, reviving a stale intranet, and creating bi-weekly posts focused on the organization’s mission.\n\nThis dedication and thoroughness extends to her day-to-day work as well. In 2020, she created a monthly newsletter and wrote a monthly CEO column to help the employees get to know leadership.\n\nWhen it comes to giving back to the community, Moore revived an inactive corporate responsibility program. In December 2020 she organized a community-wide food drive, which brought in $25,000 in employee contributions. She brought a new coat of paint to the corporate social responsibility team and helped it go global, supporting nurses and schools in the U.S. and India and raising $5,000 in pre-packaged food items and masks to U.S. food pantries.\n\n—MC\n\nThe American Institutes for Research (AIR)\n\nMakini Nyanteh brings her knowledge to the American Institutes for Research\n\nAs vice president of Communications & Public Affairs for the American Institutes for Research (AIR), Makini Nyanteh changed the organization’s culture. She took the lead on a complete rebrand and is recognized as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWith the American Institutes for Research’s background in science, it took an extended hand to connect the worlds of academia and marketing. AIR’s leadership and staff were nervous about bringing “branding” and “marketing” into their efforts, so Makini Nyanteh’s first job was to take practical steps toward a total cultural change. Her bridge needed to stretch from her background in Big Pharma, public utilities and private industry to AIR’s research and evidence. A nonpartisan, not-for-profit institution, AIR seeks to advance education and equity through behavioral and social science research, as well as delivering technical assistance.\n\nOn the audience-facing side, Nyanteh’s job was to rebrand AIR’s website and the entire look and feel of the organization’s public face. After the new website launch, the site saw a nearly 25% increase in site traffic compared to the same time period last year.\n\nThe new branding statement, “Advancing Evidence, Improving Lives,” encapsulates the rebranding effort to portray the organization with authority and dignity, plus a modern look. Over the course of several months, Nyanteh was integral to coordinating between internal and external stakeholders and creating a concise new mission statement to sum up AIR’s efforts as well: “AIR’s mission is to generate and use rigorous evidence that contributes to a better, more equitable world.”\n\nCommunicating entirely new branding during the pandemic, while the offices were closed, presented its own challenges. At the same time, AIR was integrating two other research organizations recently acquired. Nyanteh needed to communicate about the new brand and website, ensuring staff, clients and partners understood how to use the brand language and visuals. She rose to the occasion.\n\nAIR’s Communications and Public Affairs team now thrives as a close-knit part of AIR’s identity as a mission-driven organization. They played a key role in AIR’s new $100 million Equity Initiative launched this year, having gained the organization’s trust enough to plan and execute communications to address what AIR sees as our nation’s most pressing challenge: inequity.\n\n“What Makini has accomplished is about more than a new brand and new website,” said AIR President and CEO David Myers. “It’s been about bringing people together, creating a culture of excellence, and moving our institution’s communications efforts into the 21st century.”\n\n—MC\n\nHy-Vee, Inc.\n\nIvy Sprague forges strong links in employee-owned grocery chain\n\nFor Ivy Sprague, communications manager at Hy-Vee, Inc., bridges the space between employee-owners and customers. Her work has garnered praise from her department as well as recognition as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards. Although just one part of what is expected to be many more initiatives, the DEI programs she supported have also already broken new ground.\n\nAt Hy-Vee, Ivy Sprague brings her expertise to both internal and external communications. One aspect of her bridge-building comes from Hy-Vee’s status as an employee-owned company. An important part of her work is drafting quarterly letters for the 1,200 employee owners, which involves translating business information into easily digestible and useful content.\n\n“In her four years at Hy-Vee, Ivy has demonstrated that she is an invaluable member of our team through her expert counsel, pitch-perfect writing and impeccable work ethic,” said Tina Potthoff, Hy-Vee’s senior vice president of communications. “Most of all, I appreciate Ivy’s ability to connect people and ideas through her thoughtful approach and positive outlook. Ivy builds bridges for Hy-Vee every day.”\n\nSprague is also the lead communicator for Hy-Vee’s One Step initiative, which sends a portion of proceeds from the sales of selected projects to programs supporting healthier living. She also helped in the effort that led to the West Des Moines Chamber of Commerce presenting Hy-Vee with a Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI) Workplace Excellence Award, as well as another regional diversity award yet to be announced.\n\nHer bridge-building tools include email, social media, intranet stories and Retail Zipline, an employee communications platform available to all 86,000 Hy-Vee employees. In particular, she crosses department boundaries to work closely with human resources in a time in which finding (and keeping) the right employees can be a challenge. Last but not least, she uses her excellent communication skills to represent Hy-Vee on panels before community and industry groups.\n\n—MC\n\nKyowa Kirin, Inc.\n\nSusan Thiele’s patient advocacy sets her work apart\n\nSusan Thiele, director of patient advocacy and communications at Kyowa Kirin, Inc., is named a Bridge Builder and one of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications for her clear-eyed work. She quickly came up to speed in a new position and built bridges between patients who might otherwise have felt isolated by their diagnosis with a rare disease.\n\nAs a leader for PR, media relations and patient advocacy for two commercial brands, Susan Thiele has a lot of irons in the fire. She brings together marketing, sales, medical affairs, legal and regulatory teams for Kyowa Kirin‘s efforts in specialty pharmaceuticals. She provides clarity and authority to both health-care providers and patients about both products.\n\nOne of those products, Poteligeo, is an infused therapy indicated for the treatment of rare forms of blood cancer. Because Thiele’s research found that patients diagnosed with rare diseases often lack a sense of community support, she created an ambassador program to bring patients together.\n\n“Susan is an exceptional bridge builder,” said Sue Smith, vice president, oncology franchise. “She has been an integrated and positive partner. Poteligeo Partners is a meaningful and innovative program that helps people understand and connect to a rare condition in a meaningful way. Susan led and orchestrated this work seamlessly. Her professionalism and dedication, along with expertise to help actual Poteligeo patients compliantly tell their stories, is the epitome of Kyowa Kirin’s commitment to patients.”\n\n“I am impressed with everything Susan does,” said Kristi Ambs and Tim Fraley, oncology thought leader liaisons “She jumped right in from day one and quickly was well-versed in CTCL. Susan has such a passion for patients and it shows in all of her work. She is always willing to help, even if it is not in her job description. The patient ambassador program is top-notch and one of the most valuable programs for patients this company offers. We are truly blessed to have her here!”\n\n—MC\n\nProvidence\n\nMelissa Tizon kept the focus on health and truth during COVID-19\n\nAs the health system that treated the first known COVID-19 patient in the United States, Providence had no choice but to be a leading voice in the pandemic. Vice President of National Communication Melissa Tizon rose to the occasion, focusing the message on Providence’s trustworthiness and authority and earning recognition as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nGood communication is about responding to people as much as it is about pulling the right numbers, and success depends on both. At Providence health systems, Melissa Tizon’s communications leadership helped the organization’s earned media reach an audience of 94 billion and increased share of voice from 33% to 44%, resulting in top SOV among peers.\n\nTreating the first known COVID-19 patient in the country meant that Providence inevitably had the nation’s attention. Tizon was at the forefront of the effort to provide timely, trustworthy information in a time of mounting anxiety. Tizon was instrumental in bringing the communications department together to express a clear message.\n\nTo help, Providence appointed a public information officer (PIO) to give the communications team live updates as the virus spread and day-to-day life for hospital workers changed. Tizon’s public relations team identified Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips as a subject matter expert and arranged for her to speak to the public as a CNN medical contributor. A Providence doctor also addressed foreign media at a State Department briefing and appeared in a PBS Frontline documentary to promote confidence in possible treatments.\n\nTizon was also a key mover and shaker in Providence doing good throughout the network outside of COVID-19 leadership. She was instrumental in her team’s push for messaging around Providence’s $50 million commitment to mitigating racial disparities in health care. Her team also oversaw the announcements of the health system’s Environmental Justice Collaborative, which committed to going carbon negative by 2030.\n\n“Her ability to work across regions, service areas and lines of business to find alignment, scale strategies, and amplify our voice is unmatched,” wrote a Providence representative.\n\n—MC\n\nU.S. Department of Labor\n\nSusan Wool brings together communications and technology\n\nSusan Wool, branch chief of Strategic Outreach & Communications in the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) for the U.S. Department of Labor, has a country-wide reach and a serious responsibility. She built bridges between departments, with a particular focus on teaching employees about IT tools and resources. Wool shows how today’s communications intersect with IT solutions and safety, earning her a nod as a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nToday’s information technology is changing rapidly, creating both more opportunities and more chances for employees to fall prey to confusion or cyberattacks. Susan Wool has been an “insightful team leader with poise and purpose” in increasing her department’s resilience in this area, said Deputy CIO Lou Charlier.\n\nWool has built bridges for both herself and others over the course of her career in the Department of Labor. In particular she closed the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders and communicated out the impact of OCIO’s work in providing IT solutions for the department’s internal and external communications. She created trainings for both department employees and new political appointees\n\nPart of her recent work involved overseeing a complete overhaul of two department newsletters. She took the lead on developing a new look and feel for the newsletters, as well as refreshing website pages. At the same time, she managed an IT Job Aids intranet page with over 100 resources, which garnered over 6,800 unique page views during the past year.\n\nIn the time since she moved from being a supervisory client engagement manager to branch chief of communications, she took the initiative on new tasks as well. It was her idea to address a need within the department for online trainings focused on IT technologies. Her 90-minute OCIO training on IT tools and resources, created in partnership with the human resources department, received a 90% satisfaction rating.\n\nWool also taught the IT portion of the OHR’s new hire orientation. These trainings have been so successful that the department expanded them to incorporate them into the creation and maintenance of a new OCIO training program launching later this year.\n\n—MC\n\nAscension\n\nRosie Ford fights human trafficking and supports health\n\nRosie Ford, executive vice president and chief marketing and communications officer at Ascension, won the Community Giver award in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards due to her health care-focused charitable efforts. She spearheaded Ascension’s rebrand, the largest in the health care provider space. Her company podcast was so successful that it expanded to a morning newscast.\n\nAs part of the leadership for Ascension, a non-profit Catholic health system, Rosie Ford’s work in creative development and execution for brand marketing initiatives has helped push the organization to become a nationally recognized consumer health care brand. She had a pivotal role in Ascension’s massive rebrand across 2,600 sites of care in 20 states. In addition, she led a national advertising campaign in collaboration with Olympic gold medal gymnast Shannon Miller.\n\nAs an example of the way Ascension combines charity and business, Ford shepherded the marketing effort for the inaugural Ascension Charity Classic. This new PGA Tour Champions golf tournament raised more than $800,000 for local charities in 2021. As well as reaching this monetary milestone, it broke attendance records for a first-time PGA Tour Champions event and supported economic development in North County, St. Louis with a goal of expanding access and creating more diversity in golf.\n\nWithin Ascension, Rosie put together the Good Day Ascension podcast, recording 24 episodes over the last year. The podcast encouraged organization community and spirituality by sharing inspiring stories from across the ministry. The podcast was so successful that the organization expanded it into the Good Day Ascension Newscast, targeted at bringing together caregivers and associates.\n\nShe developed a policy and training program for frontline clinicians to help them recognize victims of human trafficking and serves on the Grant Award Committee for the Marillac Mission Fund, which supports efforts to stop this crime as well as to support older adults living independently, veterans, immigrants and refugees.\n\nOutside of work, Ford brings her passion for leadership and creative stewardship to the Sexual Assault Response Team for YWCA Metro St. Louis, where she counsels victims of sexual assault and domestic violence in times of crisis.\n\n—MC\n\nPaducah Bank\n\nSusan Guess spreads kindness throughout her community\n\nSenior Vice President of Marketing of Paducah Bank Susan Guess earns recognition as a Community Giver in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards due to her leadership in making big changes in her daughter’s community. She has organized pushes for kindness throughout Kentucky.\n\nTo be a Community Giver, you need to see a need in the community, meet it and go above and beyond the call of duty. For Susan Guess, community efforts such as the Guess Anti-Bullying Foundation, the community Kindness Color Walk and the Be Kind Paducah effort all come from a place of family and generosity.\n\nAt work, she holds the senior VP of marketing position at Paducah Bank, which consistently receives 5-star ratings from BauerFinancial, the nation’s premier bank rating firm, and was rated #1 Best Place to Work in Kentucky among medium-sized companies.\n\nGuess’ community-building efforts are inspired in part by her daughter, Morgan. When Morgan was a child, her experience with school bullying led mother and daughter to co-found the Guess Anti-Bullying Foundation. The effort led the governor to appoint a statewide task force to study the issue, leading to legislation that impacts all 640,000 Kentucky public school students.\n\nThat started a lifetime of charitable giving. Last year, Susan and Morgan organized their annual Scarf in the Park, a Christmastime donation of winter clothing, socks and masks for the homeless. Their commitment to organized giving also extends to the annual summer Kindness Color Walk, which brings up to 1,000 people together to commit to kindness. Although it was not possible to hold the walk in 2021, they still organized T-shirts and packets for participants and encouraged them to perform an intentional act of kindness.\n\nIn August, they organized the Be Kind Paducah program, which brought together students, teachers, artists, business leaders, police, members of the NAACP and ministers to create a message to encourage kindness in the community.\n\n—MC\n\nKAH Consulting Group\n\nKerry-Ann Hamilton brings together pro bono public service and consulting\n\nPromoting community elevates Kerry-Ann Hamilton’s work with the KAH Consulting Group and gained her a Community Giver award in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards. From earning 1 billion online views to news about America’s largest Black bank to appearing as an expert on NPR, she has proven experience and social impact. As a volunteer speaker and consulting voice, she also contributes to community-building efforts in her personal time.\n\nAs founder and principal counselor of KAH Consulting Group, Kerry-Ann Hamilton chooses causes she believes in. Making it part of the group’s goal to be driven by purpose, she demonstrates that drive with both pro bono consulting and the clients she chooses.\n\nIn 2021, she led the merger announcement of the largest Black bank in the United States. The campaign, using 32 unique pieces of coverage, reached 1.85 billion in online readership and received 160,000 social shares. Top-tier coverage, including a New York Times exclusive, the Associated Press, Wall Street Journal and CNBC and others reported on it as not only a transaction, but a story about transformation and opportunity for an under-represented community.\n\nFor FarmLink, a nonprofit founded by college students during the pandemic, Hamilton’s communications efforts resulted in nearly 40,000 pounds of food going to people instead of into the trash. FarmLink connects farmers to food banks — in this case, the United Hands of Compton Food Bank — to find a use for food that would otherwise be thrown away.\n\nIn addition, the largest public charter network in the country, KIPP Public Schools, chose Hamilton and her team for their rebranding, which put the voices of students and families first.\n\nHer work has not gone unnoticed. In 2020, Hamilton was named a Washington Business Journal 40 under 40 Awardee for “a strong record of innovation in their fields, outstanding performance in business” and “meaningful community involvement.”\n\nAlong with her prestigious paid work, Hamilton volunteered to consult with non-profits on crisis communications as they shifted gears to remote or limited in-person offerings during the pandemic. She also provided expertise for NPR and others on the topics of the digital divide and more, all on a volunteer basis.\n\n—MC\n\nIMA Financial Group\n\nRuth Rohs and IMA give back to the Colorado community\n\nRuth Rohs, SVP of Corporate Communications and executive director of the IMA Foundation, IMA Financial Group, turns personal experience into community outreach. IMA itself includes volunteers who collectively gave 4,750 hours to area nonprofits. Her work is being honored in the Community Giver category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\n“Everyone has an opportunity to roll up their sleeves and make an impact,” Ruth Rohs says.\n\nThe impact she makes with this philosophy can be felt in both her career and the community. At work as senior vice president of corporate communications, she took a leading role in growing IMA Financial Group from 700 to 1,300 associates in the last 12 months. Her responsibilities encompass the IMA Financial Group’s family of companies, a more than $300 million enterprise, including one of the fastest-growing insurance brokerages in the country.\n\nWhen the company founded two state-wide initiatives, Colorado Companies Uniting Against Racism and Colorado Inclusive Economy, Rohs took the lead as relationship manager and chief communicator.\n\nIn 2020, IMA took part or led multiple charitable initiatives. These included:\n\nIMA associates volunteered 4,750 hours at area nonprofits\n\nMore than $566,000 in grants awarded to about 100 nonprofit partners\n\nThe IMA’s Difference Maker Fund, an employee assistance fund which Rohs established, assisted three associates in need\n\nDollars for Doers, a fund which Rohs established that matches employee volunteer hours with donations, donated $3,500\n\nIMA associates serve as advisors for 65 nonprofit boards\n\nThis interest in diversity and community-building extends to her personal life, too. She has founded two nonprofits, including the Mardi Gras Krewe de Colorado, the only such organization in the country with a giving mission. She and eight fellow breast cancer survivors formed Community Chest, an organization in support of the Women’s Foundation of Colorado.\n\nThe American Heart Association named her their Denver Woman of Impact 2021 after she became one of their top four fundraisers in the country. This initiative, started after the tragic passing of her mother from a heart attack, perfectly illustrates how Rohs’ charitable efforts stem from her life and turn adversity into opportunity for the wider community.\n\n—MC\n\nPrudential\n\nMichele Stellato’s ALS diagnosis launched a $100,000 fundraiser\n\nMichele Stellato, director of technology communications at Prudential, has a personal reason to push for ALS research. Her advocacy gained her a place among Ragan’s Community Givers in its Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease, Michele Stellato looked at what she could do to help others.\n\n“ALS is the worst thing that’s happened to me, but I’m hoping to be the best thing to happen to ALS,” she said.\n\nSince her diagnosis in 2020, she has set out to use the skills she holds as Prudential’s director, technology communications to help other people with the neurodegenerative disease. Since she already knows how to do outreach, the fit with ALS advocacy organizations was natural.\n\n“It was a call to action,” Stellato said. “In a way, it was something I was meant to do. As a community, we needed someone who could communicate our message, get people to listen and inspire them to do something.”\n\n“It’s a rare person who’s able to absorb a diagnosis like ALS and then jump right into activism,” said Valerie Estess, co-founder of Project ALS, a research nonprofit.\n\nAnd Stellato has done a lot of activism. She spoke at Project ALS’ annual galas in 2020 and 2021, plus webinars presenting her honest story of what it was like to get the diagnosis at age 32. The disease, which causes a person to lose the ability to walk, talk, swallow and breathe, is usually fatal within two to five years.\n\nStellato’s contribution was “an instant and enormous help,” said Erin Fleming, director of Research Operations for Project ALS.\n\nFox 29 Philly and Pix11.com featured her to promote Act for ALS, legislation that would fund expanded access to therapies and accelerate approval of new drugs, in December 2020. She also joined Her ALS Story, a network for women diagnosed before age 32, and appeared with this group in a Project ALS Research Live Facebook webinar with 3,700 viewers, compared to an average of 1,000 users.\n\nShe also raised $100,000 for Prosetin, a new ALS drug, with her organization Fight ALS Now. Even as her disease progressed, both her Prudential work and activism continued.\n\n—MC\n\nW.W. Grainger, Inc.\n\nRenee Young guides both employees and youth in need\n\nRenee Young, director of CEO and company communications for W.W. Grainger, knows the power of telling a cohesive story. Her forward-looking guidance helped steer the company through the pandemic with clarity. Plus, she brings her business acumen to volunteer work. These efforts have earned her recognition as a Community Giver in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nIt’s all about the story. For Renee Young of W.W. Grainger, Inc., a business-to-business maintenance, repair, and operating supplies distributor, the story of her social commitments permeates the office and beyond.\n\nIn her day job, Young heads up the most popular event for the organization, a regular leader and team member call led by the executive team. When W.W. Grainger won the Great Place to Work designation, Young was behind the more than 20-page narrative about the company’s culture, employee experience and HR approach that launched the company to success.\n\nWhen COVID-19 and other global events brought challenges, Young rose to the occasion. She spearheaded the company’s first racial justice social media post by the company’s CEO, and works with the CEO, CHRO and head of diversity on messaging around social issues such as Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ issues and hate crimes against diverse populations.\n\nWhen it came time for pandemic precautions, Young led 23,000 team members through safety protocols and guidance. As the communication leader on the Pandemic Leadership Committee, she also correctly predicted upcoming changes, such as the federal vaccine mandate, and had content ready to go before it had gone into effect. Working with the general counsel and chief human resources officer, she both provides clear-eyed direction and influences decision-making.\n\nOutside of work, Young serves on the board for the Lake County Forest Preserve Foundation. She brings her business acumen to the annual fundraising plan and budget, grant requests, and organizational processes and procedures. With her work on the College of Lake County Foundation, she raises money and awareness for students who need scholarships and grants to point them toward a better future. She also brings her skills and desire to uplift others to the advisory board for UCAN, a Chicago-based organization which provides youth who have suffered trauma with resources to become future leaders.\n\nNow that’s a story worth telling.\n\n—MC\n\nBlueShore Financial\n\nBrett Boag recreated BlueShore’s annual in-person meeting as a virtual event\n\nBeyond handling pandemic-related messaging, boosting morale, and establishing a spirit of goodwill, Brett Boag helped create a successful virtual annual meeting — a first for BlueShore. For her success in generating an 85% staff attendance rate for the annual meeting, Boag was named an honoree in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards\n\nWhen other businesses were shuttered during the pandemic, financial institutions such as BlueShore kept their doors open. Although its workforce of more than 200 office employees shifted to remote work, more than 150 staff members remained on site at bank branches.\n\nBrett Boag, director of employee and corporate communications, led her team in crafting factual, timely information related to the pandemic. Beyond writing articles for the intranet, Boag and her team penned weekly emails from executives. In an effort to boost morale, the team publicized a series of uplifting staff stories.\n\nDuring an era of remote work, Boag was quick to establish a dialogue between staff and management. She made leadership more visible and accessible through the creation of a quarterly “Open Mic” virtual event.\n\nShe embraced a spirit of goodwill and collaboration by implementing “Pay It Forward,” an initiative that provided everyone at BlueShore with funds to benefit a cause of their choice. Employees supported a variety of organizations through financial donations and by partnering to organize events such as a virtual food drive and a gift campaign for children. Through the program, employees also provided lunches for people at COVID-19 testing facilities.\n\nWhen BlueShore’s annual meeting went virtual for the first time ever, Boag helped facilitate a seamless transition. She coached senior leaders on how to create content and assisted them in using new technology.\n\nBoag’s hard work paid off — 92% of respondents gave the meeting a thumbs up. Another milestone was reached when BlueShore reached its highest attendance record ever for the annual event.\n\n—RM\n\nCaliber\n\nDebbie Braden helped Caliber Collision create a COVID-19 hub to help keep first responders on the road\n\nWhen Caliber Collision was deemed an essential business, Debbie Braden worked hard to keep everyone safe so that business could continue during a time of uncertainty. For her efforts in keeping all 21,000 employees informed and up-to-date, Braden received recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nEven during the early days of the pandemic when shelter-in-place requirements were instituted, first responders, medical professionals and other essential employees were out on the road. These heroes were instrumental in helping the rest of us navigate an unprecedented crisis.\n\nCaliber Collision kept its doors open so it could repair and maintain the fleet of vehicles that were vital to first responders. Its team was also there to help the rest of us remain safe as we took trips to the grocery store or to check in on loved ones.\n\nAs director of internal communications, Debbie Braden helped Caliber Collision successfully pivot and adapt to a new set of challenges.\n\nEven before COVID-19 altered everyone’s plans, Caliber Collision partnered with employee experience platform Unily to create a unified, integrated intranet site for its four lines of business. Although that intranet plan never came to fruition due to the health crisis, Braden revamped the plan and quickly revised it so that a COVID-19 hub could be established to keep staff in 38 states informed.\n\nBraden designed and launched the COVID-19 hub, which provided the workforce with all the information they needed to ensure that workers, their families and their customers stayed safe.\n\nThe COVID-19 Hub included:\n\nEducation on everything from evolving symptoms to vaccine readiness, myths vs. facts and updates on variants\n\nA digital guide that offered access to the most accurate and up-to-date information, including a search function\n\nSupport resources that enabled teammates to access Caliber Family at work, from home, or when on leave.\n\nResources focused on health and well-being.\n\nAbility to virtually with employee assistance, healthcare providers, vaccine resources, and the human resources team\n\n—RM\n\nRaytheon Technologies\n\nPam Erickson was working towards implementing a Raytheon vaccine mandate before The White House announced its policy\n\nPam Erickson was immersed in the process of announcing a vaccine mandate at Raytheon when her team learned that The White House was also ready to make that important call. She is commended for her foresight, leadership, and bravery for making such a bold, but necessary move to keep everyone safe. For her vision in leading the aerospace and defense company, Erickson received recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAfter nearly two years responding to constantly shifting COVID-related information, communications teams across the globe were confronted with a new dilemma: how to effectively and empathetically roll out corporate vaccine mandates.\n\nSo many people had deeply entrenched stances on the topic. Conflicting information about vaccines made the task even more daunting.\n\nAs chief communications officer of Raytheon Technologies, Pam Erickson was at the helm when the aerospace and defense company considered implementing its own vaccination mandate. At the time, this was particularly noteworthy since it was long before many other major companies announced mandates.\n\nErickson spearheaded the campaign for all 125,000 U.S.-based employees. Developing a strategy without a model required agility as multiple changes in the implementation and timing needed to be considered and incorporated.\n\nShe challenged her team to be aware of pitfalls that could derail the campaign as well as opportunities to strengthen it. This led to strong coordination with a wide range of perspectives — from legal and human resources to government relations and employee groups.\n\nErickson remained on guard for any changes that occurred beyond the company’s control. Days before the planned announcement, her team learned that President Joe Biden would soon be announcing vaccination requirements for large companies and federal contractors.\n\nAfter considering nearly every possible response and developing messages for employees across all 50 states, Erickson’s plan was put on pause while her team awaited guidance from The White House.\n\nOnce Biden announced the new policies, Erickson’s team updated its messaging to align with The White House’s direction. Days after the executive order was announced, Raytheon announced its policy. The timing was key since the announcement positioned Raytheon as the first in its industry to mandate vaccinations.\n\nThe campaign’s messaging garnered positive feedback from employees. Raytheon also received accolades from The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, and Reuters.\n\n—RM\n\nHIMSS\n\nKaren D. Groppe managed communications around cancellation of 1st global conference to be called off due to pandemic\n\nKaren D. Groppe effectively managed the messaging for the first global conference event to be canceled due to the pandemic. This move sparked a parallel task to call off a speech that then-President Donald Trump was scheduled to present at the conference. She handled these tasks with skill and strategy. For her extraordinary ability to lead, Groppe has earned recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nTelling the right story to the right people at the right time is a key part of Karen D. Groppe’s skillset. As senior director of strategic communications for the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), Groppe heads communications for its annual Global Conference and Exhibition.\n\nA seasoned leader, Groppe brought more than 20 years of expertise to her role. With an eye on the pandemic in early February 2020, she continued to monitor the situation while leveraging communications tactics to keep more than 47,000 registered conference attendees informed.\n\nBy March, the pandemic was escalating. As the sole point person for press relations, Groppe managed the initial backlash to the announcement that then-President Trump was scheduled to speak at the conference. Days before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, Groppe shared messaging about how the conference would proceed.\n\nHer role became particularly challenging when events needed to be cancelled due to safety concerns. Groppe is commended for her ability to direct all messaging related to the cancellation of the HIMSS conference — the first global conference event to be canceled due to this health crisis. This move sparked a parallel task to call off the speech that then-President Donald Trump was scheduled to present at the conference.\n\nDuring the five days following the cancellation announcement, Groppe served as spokesperson in 48 interviews. She continued conversations with The White House on how the cancellation would be managed and how the president would reference it. Thanks to Groppe’s crisis management skills, Trump never directly mentioned HIMSS in his conversations about the cancellation.\n\nThe messaging and strategy Groppe employed set the stage for the subsequent cancellation of other scheduled HIMSS conferences. Throughout the crisis, Groppe demonstrated her outstanding communication skills, trustworthiness, and bold, assertive approach.\n\n—RM\n\nPacific Northwest National Laboratory\n\nMelanie Johnston maintained calm as she shared pandemic news with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s employees\n\nThanks to her keen organizational skills and mastery of communications, Melanie Johnston is applauded for keeping more than 5,000 staff members at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory safe and productive during the pandemic. For her efforts, Johnston earned recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nOn the heels of a packed professional year where Melanie Johnston made exceptional contributions as the interim manager for internal and mission support, she was tapped to lead pandemic communications for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). As one of the United States Department of Energy’s national laboratories, PNNL is managed by the Office of Science.\n\nWhen information was limited, guidance changed frequently. Johnston remained tuned in and was adept at adjusting messaging on safety requirements and employee expectations as the team pivoted to remote work.\n\n“In part due to the Melanie-led staff communications effort, staff worked safely and productively, whether on campus or on extended telework,” says Greg Koller, senior public affairs advisor and newsroom manager, PNNL. “The number of staff who contracted the disease is far below the rates in our community.”\n\nResults like these are only achieved through skill, hard work, and dedication. Johnston showed up at daily meetings held at 7 a.m., tirelessly pulled 12-hour workdays and was always available for meetings on the weekends.\n\nJohnston either created or reviewed nearly all COVID-19-related communications. It included more than 45 internal articles, 14 senior manager meetings, five all-staff meetings, and more than 40 FAQ updates. She also served as the voice on PNNL’s internal whiteboard.\n\nBeyond addressing staff, Johnston helped inform leadership about COVID-19’s ever-changing science, regulations and requirements. All communications were handled with diplomacy and respect for all employees.\n\nRecognized as an internal communications COVID 19 best practice, Johnston’s work was spotlighted in Science Public Outreach Community, a Department of Energy publication.\n\n“Melanie approaches every situation with a calm and thoughtful manner, which is so critical on complex, highly charged efforts,” concludes Koller.\n\n—RM\n\nCooper University Health Care\n\nSuzanne Lane’s leadership helped Cooper University Health Care coordinate the regional COVID-19 response\n\nSuzanne Lane was instrumental in assisting Cooper University Health Care in its prominent role coordinating the regional COVID-19 response for part of New Jersey. For her ability to lead with transparency, Lane earned recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nSuzanne Lane is a leader who has a way with words. That’s why Cooper University Health Care, an academic health system and Level 1 Trauma Center serving southern New Jersey, brought her on board as director of internal communications.\n\nJust a few months after Lane joined Cooper University, the pandemic swept the globe. The state of New Jersey designated Cooper one of only three academic health systems to coordinate regional COVID-19 response. The health system was charged with ensuring that there would be enough critical care beds, PPE and transportation for patients.\n\nA seasoned professional, Lane stepped in to keep Cooper’s 8,500 employees and 850 employed physicians working in unison. She proved to be a vital member of Cooper’s Incident Management Team (IMT). As lead communicator, Lane worked closely with senior leaders, clinical and administrative staff to translate complex issues and rapidly changing information into written materials, emails, intranet posts, signage, and videos.\n\nLane swiftly demonstrated her commitment to Cooper and the community it serves. She often put in 10-to-12-hour days to ensure that communications were frequent, clear and relevant.\n\nTo facilitate internal communications, Lane developed a campaign to launch the Pulse+ mobile app. Success came quickly. Within two months, more than 2,000 users signed on. Lane also spearheaded a campaign to refresh and promote Cooper’s new mission, vision and values.\n\nThe communications guru is credited for creating a supportive, collaborative work environment where team members feel respected and valued. Her colleagues were quick to notice that Lane was among the first to volunteer to pitch in to help, brainstorm ideas or provide encouragement.\n\n—RM\n\nKaseya\n\nIn the wake of cyberattack, Kaseya celebrated one of its best quarters, thanks in part to Dana Liedholm’s work\n\nFrom her helm at information technology and security management provider Kaseya, Dana Liedholm managed the fallout from a sophisticated cyberattack. She used the spotlight to clarify misinformation and share the ways in which Kaseya’s achieved success through collaboration and taking swift action. For her success, Dana Liedholm was recognized in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs if a pandemic wasn’t enough of a challenge, this information technology and security management solutions provider faced a sophisticated cyberattack.\n\nIn July, a cybercriminal group exploited vulnerabilities in Kaseya’s VSA software. Its mission: to spread ransomware that would cause businesses to lose their access to data. To remedy the situation, customers had to disable Kaseya’s software.\n\nLiedholm responded by drafting customer and media-facing updates, which were shared on Kaseya’s website. The information provided customers, the public and key stakeholders with an accurate source of information. It was updated every three-to-five hours with date and time stamps. These updates were shared through Kaseya’s social media pages and emailed to its VSA customers.\n\nAs senior vice president corporate marketing and communications, Liedholm was involved in meetings with legal and financial stakeholders, government officials in the FBI, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). She ensured that all parties were involved in creating the content.\n\nLiedholm worked to ensure that misinformation was dispelled. To counter the misleading narrative about the “millions of businesses impacted,” she created a video featuring Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola who detailed the steps the company took to protect its customers. The video garnered more than 28,000 views.\n\nTo ensure that people learned that less than 60 of Kaseya’s 35,000-plus customers were breached, Liedholm shared the video with The Wall Street Journal and Good Morning America. Kaseya’s overall media sentiment moved from neutral to positive.\n\nNews outlets credited Kaseya’s transparency, swift action, and collaboration. Customers praised its efforts on social media and in customer meetings. Another win: In the quarter after the attack, Kaseya’s sales experienced an uptick of 22%.\n\n—RM\n\nPenn Medicine Princeton Health\n\nCarol Norris-Smith helped shape Penn Medicine Princeton Health’s pandemic-related response\n\nUnder Carol Norris-Smith’s leadership, Princeton Health launched a successful reopening campaign. By the end of the year, patient volume was restored to pre-pandemic levels. For her success, and her leadership around vaccine messaging, Norris-Smith was recognized in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nCarol Norris-Smith is credited with having the vision, skills, and intuition to keep Princeton Health a step ahead of emerging issues. As vice president of marketing and public affairs, she used her expertise and wise council to help shape the New Jersey health system’s pandemic-related response.\n\nNorris-Smith successfully managed Princeton Health’s vaccine-related communication and education efforts to an audience of physicians, nurses, healthcare professionals and community members.\n\nWhile navigating all the uncertainty that came along with the pandemic, she used her skills and foresight to overcome hurdles.\n\nSince vaccination efforts were part of a statewide system, Princeton Health wasn’t in direct control of the situation. This presented several challenges and required the health system to communicate vaccine availability in accordance with New Jersey state guidelines.\n\nRecognizing that the initial demand would far exceed the supply — and that appointments would fill up in a flash — Norris-Smith was sensitive about how Princeton Health shared news about availability. She strived to be equitable while fulfilling state vaccination requirements.\n\nNorris-Smith realized that when supply chain issues eventually resolved, other topics would emerge. She worked hard to address vaccine hesitancy, vaccine access, misinformation and school safety.\n\nNorris-Smith helped Princeton Health achieve success by:\n\nCommunicating via the website, email, social media, photos, and video\n\nPartnering with county government and community organizations to administer vaccines in easily accessible, convenient locations\n\nLaunching an education-based vaccination program for school and university employees\n\nUsing planned community wellness events as platforms for providing information, answering questions and debunking myths\n\nIdentifying alternative approaches to communicating with hard-to-reach populations\n\nUsing publications to communicate vaccine information. News was shared though Princeton Health, which is distributed to 80,000 households six times annually\n\n—RM\n\nNCR Corporation\n\nAnne O’Neill drove NCR Corporation forward during a time of crisis\n\nAnne O’Neill’s ability to remain calm in a crisis and lead NCR Corporation through the COVID-19 pandemic has earned her recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAnne O’Neill greets crisis with calmness and reason. That’s why the senior communications manager, corporate marketing and public affairs at NCR Corporation, was tapped to take the reins during a time of uncertainty.\n\n“When people tell me I am calm, I remind them ducks look calm on the water, but they’re paddling like crazy. That’s what I do,” says Anne O’Neill, who joined the company only three years ago.\n\nSince NCR was deemed an essential service, the software- and services-led enterprise provider was tasked with establishing a global COVID-19 Response Task Force early on, when information about the virus was limited.\n\nO’Neill tapped her expertise in journalism, public relations, and communications to help lead and direct the company’s 36,000 employees worldwide. Since NCR works with the financial, retail and hospitality industries, she was tasked with effectively helping pivot its brand narrative to #KeepCommerceRunning.\n\nO’Neill is adept at crafting engaging, effective campaigns and content. Beyond leading her team to create the NCR Safe Work Playbook, which provided health and safety information and return-to-office requirements, O’Neill was instrumental in the development of the “NCR Office Re-entry Communications Playbook.” Managers worldwide turned to its FAQs section and templates for assistance.\n\nThanks to O’Neill’s fact-based decision-making and safety-centric communications, NCR was proud to report COVID-19 rates below the global average.\n\nThrough O’Neill’s strong thought leadership, internal and external updates, and strategic partnerships, the fearless leader also led restaurant recovery communications, which helped mitigate the impact to NCR’s hardest-hit sector.\n\n“Anne evolved into the go-to person for crisis communications. When the world stopped, she kept going. Her journalist instincts kicked in. She was unflappable,” said O’Neill’s colleague.\n\nThis self-proclaimed “duck” is truly a courageous crisis lion.\n\n—RM\n\nLincoln Financial Group\n\nAmy Ponticello spearheaded the development of a crisis communications plan for Lincoln Financial Group\n\nAmy Ponticello handles the unexpected with grace and strength.

For her ability to overcome obstacles, Ponticello has earned a nod in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\n“If you’re expecting the unexpected, you’ll want Amy Ponticello on your side,” said a colleague. Throughout Ponticello’s six-year stint with Lincoln Financial Group, she climbed the ranks from assistant vice president to vice president of corporate communications.\n\nPrior to her promotion, Ponticello led the COVID-19 response and return-to-work planning. She also supported executive communications for human resources leaders, the CEO and the president.\n\nPonticello also took the lead in the diversity, equity and inclusion space. Her success is evident: Lincoln has earned 100% scores on the Corporate Equality Index and the Disability Equality Index and ranks among Forbes’ “Best Large Employers” and “Best Employers for Women.”\n\nHer success was amplified when Ponticello moved into her current role. From that post, she oversees all human resources, information technology/digital, legal and enterprise strategic initiatives, including return-to-work communications.\n\nAs a well-respected communicator, stakeholders were quick to trust her expertise, which was greatly appreciated during the Great Resignation and as the pandemic continued and variants and vaccines emerged.

Her role representing leadership enables Ponticello to have a meaningful impact throughout the industry and to serve as an example for other companies when responding to crises.\n\n—RM\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame\n\nSue Ryan motivated students to return to Notre Dame during a pandemic\n\nSue Ryan drew upon her expertise managing high-profile events to assist Notre Dame University in handling COVID-19 messaging for students who were hesitant about heading back to campus during a pandemic. For her effective communications campaigns and leadership, Sue Ryan was named an honoree in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs the academic year kicked off, the University of Notre Dame had a goal to prompt 13,000 students to return to its South Bend, Indiana campus during a pandemic.\n\nSince January 2020, Sue Ryan, director of internal communications, served as co-chair on media and communications preparations for the university’s planned hosting of the first of the 2020 presidential debates, which were scheduled for September 29 (due to the pandemic, Notre Dame withdrew in July).\n\nAfter witnessing her topnotch work in handling the funeral of Father Theodore Hesburgh, who served as president of the university, and campus visits by then-vice presidents Joe Biden and Mike Pence, she was tapped for the COVID communications team in spring 2021. She oversaw messaging about testing, isolation and quarantine policies and procedures, and beyond.\n\nSince then, Ryan has successfully managed communications emerging from the Coronavirus Response Unit (CRU), which collaborates with other campus departments to share information. Hot topics include symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, saliva vs. nasal swab testing, surveillance testing, isolation and quarantine policies and accommodations, contact tracing, vaccination opportunities, and mandates.

For her achievements and abilities, Olga Solares was recognized in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nThe last few years have certainly been rife with challenges.

Olga Solares has successfully managed AMITA Health’s response during this chaotic time.\n\nAs system associate vice president of communications and media relations, Solares spearheaded the messaging about all things COVID — from personal protection to vaccine rollouts and mandatory vaccinations.

With 900 providers in its medical groups, AMITA Health has more than 26,000 associates and 7,000 physician partners signed on. The health system serves more than 6.6 million residents in the greater Chicagoland area.\n\nSince AMITA Health was charged with managing the care of a COVID-19 patients early in the pandemic, Solares had to continually shift gears to adjust messaging as guidelines and advice evolved.\n\nShe is recognized for her outstanding ability to simultaneously manage the messaging for several different audiences, each with their own sets of questions.\n\nSolares represented the team on many committees, subcommittees and task forces. As their leader, she was quick to draft detailed communications plans for each project. She adeptly handled internal communications for associates and physicians while crafting messaging for the media, website and consumer CRM.\n\nAlthough challenging situations continued to arise, Solares gracefully and skillfully managed disinformation, privacy concerns, and other volatile situations. These issues spanned from media relations and internal communications to new media.\n\n“Olga is always calm and rational when thrown into emergencies and we’ve certainly had a few situations that qualified this past year,” said a colleague.\n\n—RM\n\nHorizon House\n\nLaura Tufts used creativity and a team approach to keep Horizon House’s residents connected\n\nWith limited resources, Laura Tufts managed to keep the residents of a retirement community connected and well-informed during the darkest days of the pandemic. For her ability to foster trust through honest communication and partnerships, Tufts has earned recognition in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs the pandemic swept from one side of the globe to the other, life became more challenging for everyone. Many of the things we take for granted such as socializing and sharing meals with one another immediately came to a halt.\n\nDuring this time, Laura Tufts brought a sense of optimism and hope to Horizon House, a vibrant retirement community in Seattle. As the newly appointed head of marketing, sales and communications, Tufts helped establish a COVID Task Force, along with assistance from the residents’ Health Advisory Group.\n\nShe supported the management and distribution of communication materials to Horizon House’s 550 residents. Unfortunately, the isolation that was necessary for keeping everyone safe also made a huge impact on residents’ well-being.\n\nSince Horizon House’s communications systems weren’t up-to-date, Tufts used teamwork and a dash of creativity to keep everyone connected. With support from the technology team, she helped residents embrace new tools and technology. During a stagnant era, people at Horizon House learned to master new skills.\n\nWith help from her colleagues in technology, Tufts helped establish the K4 Connect communication system. Residents stayed connected via digital screens, an internal TV channel, and an Amazon Alexa Echo Dot, which was donated by Amazon.\n\nSince Tufts understood the importance of sharing Horizon House’s news with families and friends in real time, she encouraged residents to use the “COVID-19 Updates” webpage and social media. The page quickly became a trusted, transparent source of information.\n\nTufts also collaborated with the information technology team to unveil an app that allows residents to learn about community offerings. They can use the app to sign up for events, view the daily menu, access a resident directory and schedule hair, gym, and massage appointments. The social-centric app also allows residents to converse and share information with friends and family.\n\n—RM\n\nProvidence\n\nAdrienne Webb’s foresight and organizational skills enabled Providence Medical Group’s earned media to reach an audience of close to 100 billion\n\nAdrienne Webb was well-prepared for her mission as commander of pandemic-related communications at Providence Medical Group, due to strong foundational systems. For her success, Webb was named an honoree in the Crisis Navigator category of Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nWhen the first U.S. COVID-19 patient landed at Providence hospital in Everett, Washington, Adrienne Webb knew she was in the eye of a career-defining storm. As the director of communications assigned to national issues management, Webb served as COVID-19 public information officer.\n\nWebb ensures that the information Providence shares is factual, understandable and current. During the pandemic, this became particularly challenging since information about testing, personal protective equipment and the virulence of the virus changed almost hourly. To complicate matters, so much of the news was presented with a political spin. Regardless of these challenges, Webb was well prepared for her mission.\n\nEarly on, she developed Providence’s issues and reputation management guidebook. To facilitate the sharing of information, Webb aligned all communication teams across seven states. She also developed protocols and procedures to help her colleagues on the national and regional communication teams. Webb and her team relied on these foundational tools and systems, which proved to be stormproof during the healthcare crisis.\n\nA virtual emergency operations center was already in place to support the preparation and response to the COVID-19 crisis across the organization. Local and regional communication leaders plugged into their command centers so they could exchange information and drive local strategy. Channels that were already established for routine input and feedback enabled decision makers to continually evaluate approaches and make revisions to achieve their goals.\n\nWebb’s ability to collaborate with all levels and departments helped pave the way to success. Regional leaders and C-suite executives depended on her expert advice and her communications colleagues relied on live updates, so they could, in turn, provide accurate information and prepare local spokespeople with the latest information. Webb’s work was also pivotal for Providence’s extraordinary media effort, which included regular CNN updates and local and regional press reports.\n\n—RM\n\nMikeWorldWide\n\nCarreen Winters finds silver linings and transforms negative events into positive brand stories\n\nCarreen Winters demonstrated her keen ability to overcome obstacles as she polished the reputations of two clients in crisis mode.

Working across diverse fields, she keeps abreast of current events and the changes that have been taking place in today’s corporate arena. In fact, that’s where this star shines brightest.\n\nWinters has a talent for providing a path forward during uncertain, chaotic times. The Washington Football Team certainly wasn’t regarded as a winner before Winters stepped in to tackle its identity issues.\n\nSince 1991, the team continually failed to win a Super Bowl. It also had a long history of failing to win a playoff game. Despite a frenzy of controversy around allegations that the team was hostile to women, Winters put a positive spin on its scandal-rocked image.\n\nShe cast the spotlight on the achievements of Jason Wright, the first Black team president in NFL history. Reaching this pinnacle required a clear line of demarcation between the old team and the new. Winters proved her success when the team’s negative sentiment dropped from 97% to 10%.\n\nShe also demonstrated her steely resolve and ability to influence when she managed a volatile situation for Smithfield Foods — a pork producer with more than 40,000 employees and 40 facilities nationwide.\n\nWhen its Sioux Falls, SD facility was identified as an early hot spot for COVID-19, Winters helped the company prove its commitment to safety. She helped silence the voices from a group of bold, often misinformed critics, which ranged from politicians to unions, community leaders and the public. After months of hard work, The Wall Street Journal spotlighted an editorial heralding Smithfield as a company that did everything possible to keep workers safe.\n\n—RM\n\nEvoke KYNE\n\nSara Aghajanian, MPH helped develop Evoke KYNE’s DE&I framework, promote equity\n\nSara Aghajanian, MPH has always strived to level the playing field for people who hail from various backgrounds.

That’s why she helped shape Evoke KYNE’s DE&I efforts.\n\nIn the wake of events in Charlottesville, Virginia, Aghajanian teamed up with leadership to demonstrate that they could lead by example. She lent her talents to developing the DE&I strategic framework and the first DE&I workgroup that would work to build and nurture a culture of inclusion.\n\nAghajanian has worked with Evoke KYNE’s more than 40-person global workgroup and the head of DE&I to create live panel discussions around Black History Month and gender identity topics. Together, they advocated for leadership trainings and drove communications. She also spearheads the DE&I newsletter.\n\nOn the COVID front, Aghajanian led Evoke KYNE’s efforts for Pandemic Action Network (PAN)—a coalition that addresses preparedness and works toward global vaccine equity. In March, she helped coordinate a campaign with 40 African-American celebrities and influencers. She also developed an #ItsOurShot toolkit, empowering more than 150 partners to drive evidence-based vaccine conversations.\n\nUnder her leadership for PAN’s #WorldMaskWeek, culturally appropriate toolkits were created in Arabic, English, French, Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish. More than 170+ countries joined the efforts.
