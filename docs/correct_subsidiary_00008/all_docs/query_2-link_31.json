        "text": "Chief Communications Officer\n\nKeyCorp\n\nSusan Donlan: The calm in the storm\n\nSusan Donlan’s work keeping KeyBank on the right course through COVID-19 and other crises has earned her a spot in the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nOver the course of her career, Susan Donlan’s influence and impact has blazed the trail for women in the banking industry, in which a vast majority of leadership and board roles are still held by men.\n\nCurrently chief communications officer at KeyCorp, a financial services company with assets of approximately $189 billion and more than 17,000 employees, Donlan launched her career working with the government of Canada in research and international policy, as well as advising multiple ministers. She went on to serve in the Canada Revenue Agency and the Office of the Minister of Labor and Housing, laying the foundation of her communications career.\n\nAt T.D. Bank, Donlan used her ability to build rapport and relationships to lean further into corporate communications, mastering internal and external communications, executive communications, media relations and crisis communications while ascending through the ranks to the post of vice president in 10 years.\n\n“I have always valued the ability to listen — actively listen,” Donlan told Ragan. “You learn so much when you listen to how people are saying things, what they are sharing with you and how they feel about it. It connects you with your audience and helps you understand them. That makes you a better communicator.”\n\nIn 2018, Donlan relocated to the United States to join KeyBank as chief communications officer in Cleveland, Ohio. Once there, Donlan made sweeping changes to the corporate communications team, including establishing a leadership team and affording senior members of her team with development and leadership opportunities. Since then, she has led the team through worldwide crises and historic challenges to the banking industry.\n\nOne challenge, of course, was the COVID-19 pandemic, which hit shortly after a CEO transition. Donlan developed a reputation for being the “calm in the storm,” steadily leading her team through the pandemic while ensuring all KeyBank stakeholders were supported. Her efforts included a comprehensive internal and external plan, consumer relief, small business and Paycheck Protection Program support and continued support in the community.\n\nThen came the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March 2023. The two largest bank failures since 2008 sent shockwaves through the industry, especially for regional institutions like KeyBank. Donlan mobilized the team with an action plan that supplied employees with essential information, ensuring that clients remained confident in KeyBank’s strength and stability. She also addressed numerous media inquiries and positioned CEO Chris Gorman as KeyBank’s voice in the public.\n\n“I’ve learned how important it is to be the voice of calm within the chaos — even if I’m not feeling that calm on the inside,” Donlan said. “Experience has taught me to focus on how we move forward and out of the crisis instead of worrying about how we got there. There’s always time to reflect back and determine how to learn from a situation once the crisis passes, not from a blame perspective, but from the perspective of how we can do better.”\n\nAn active participant in KeyBank’s formal mentoring program, Donlan is involved in the Cleveland community, serving as a director on the Cleveland Museum of Natural History Board and as a member of the Cuyahoga County Public Library Foundation Board.\n\n“The field has changed so much since I began my career,” she reflected to Ragan. “The day of prose memos is long gone — you need to be able to package your content in small, digestible pieces, focusing on what you really need the audience to know. This can be a real challenge when you are dealing with complex information — the ability to synthesize complexity is a more important skill than ever for communicators.”\n\nShe advises other communicators to slow down and take time to appreciate where they are and what they’re working on. “I was always in such a hurry to get to the next thing, like I was running out of time,” she said. “Instead of focusing on the next opportunity or role, now I really try to enjoy all of the things I get to do and learn every day in my current role.”\n\nCongratulations to Susan Donlan!\n\nChief Communications Officer\n\nKraft Heinz\n\nKathy Krenger: Iconic work for iconic brands\n\nKathy Krenger revamped the comms team, beefed up the company’s news engine and boosted communications with employees, earning her spot in the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nIn 2021, as Kraft Heinz was navigating one of the most visible transformations of the decade, its CEO decided to rebuild the company’s communications team from the ground up. The person he selected to lead that team was Kathy Krenger, prompted by her stellar leadership as senior vice president of global communications at Hyatt Hotels Corporation, where she guided the hospitality brand through one of its most challenging periods amid pandemic lockdowns.\n\n“I also watched as our entire industry collapsed in a matter of days,” Krenger said of her experience at Hyatt. “Even now, when I look back at how volatile those first few months were, I can hardly believe it was real. But the work we were doing then was vital, critical, even ground-breaking. People needed our communications. They needed the information we created to survive. And sometimes, the content we were developing was the only thing giving them hope. I know this sounds a little dramatic today, but in that instant it was true.”\n\nBuilding upon that experience, Krenger joined Kraft Heinz as chief communications officer. Her task: Take what had been a small support function within the company and create a best-in-class global center of communications to serve as a strategic partner to the business.\n\nTwo major initiatives demonstrate Krenger’s work boosting Kraft Heinz’s reputation:\n\nFrom 2022 to 2023, Krenger’s team increased annual corporate media coverage results by 265%. In addition, negative news coverage decreased to 9% (down from 31% in 2021), with 91% of media coverage positive to neutral. Kraft Heinz ranked No. 28 in the 2023 Axios Harris “100 Reputation Rankings,” moving up the list from 2022 (and not making the list at all in 2021).\n\nAnd when employees reported feeling overwhelmed and disconnected from each other and their leaders. In response, Krenger’s communications team launched a new, mobile-enabled engagement platform, “The Vine,” to deliver timely and easily accessible information to the company’s 37,000 employees. To date, 97% of users have engaged on the platform, and a recent employee survey showed that 80% of respondents have greater trust in information coming from the company.\n\nShe told Ragan that an underrated quality for communicators to master is the ability to “read the room… and pivot the conversation based on someone’s preferences or need for clarity. It’s easy to forget that you may have spent the last two weeks focused on this topic, but your audience has not. They need time to absorb, ask questions and understand how this conversation or topic impacts them and if you are able to see their pause as an opportunity bring them along on the journey, be comforted by your understanding of all sides of the issue, you will have a partner and advocate rather than a detractor.”\n\nShe also touted the importance of writing skills. “Now more than ever, words matter,” she said. “Connected to words, I believe the ability to influence is a critical skill for communicators. Senior communicators will often find themselves being the one person in the room with a contrary position. Being able to explain your position without sounding like a dream killer is key.”\n\nThanks to Krenger’s efforts, the team today consists of 55 internal and external communication professionals across 15 countries. The team manages internal and external communications media relations, executive thought leadership, crisis and issues management, creative content generation and much more for the company.\n\n“In an era where everything is about reputation management, and where there are pitfalls and opportunities at every turn, [Krenger] has elevated the communications function to be a go-to partner to guide company actions that span far beyond traditional communications practices,” says Alex Abraham, vice president, global corporate communications and reputation management at Kraft Heinz.\n\n“Know yourself so you can believe in yourself,” Krenger advises. “I spent far too much time lamenting as to why I wasn’t the star of or the best at X, Y or Z. I wish I had really leaned into my strengths more, stopped worrying about other people and what they were doing and learned how to use my strengths as my superpower.”\n\nCongratulations to Kathy Krenger!\n\nSenior Vice President, Global Communications\n\nPhilip Morris International\n\nMarian Salzman: Redefining the future\n\nMarian Salzman spread the word ‘metrosexual’ and boosted #GivingTuesday. At Philip Morris International, she combats misinformation and hate, putting her in the Women in Communications Hall of Fame in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nMarian Salzman’s career has always focused on the future — and she has consistently shaped that future. In the early 1990s, when the internet was still considered the domain of nerds, she founded the world’s first cyber-consultancy — holding online focus groups via her startup, American Dialogue, also known as Cyberdialogue.\n\nIt’s no exaggeration to call her a cultural icon: she helped introduce the word “metrosexuality” to the world in 2003, sparking a global media frenzy that ultimately resulted in “metrosexual” being named Word of the Year.\n\n“People radar matters a lot,” Salzman told Ragan. “You can accomplish anything when you surround yourself with the best people, and when you work for and with people who are smarter than you are, and who share your commitment to great work, and good fun.”\n\nAnd Salzman was a driving force behind #GivingTuesday, which encourages consumers to offset the gluttony of Black Friday and Cyber Monday by helping others and raising tens of billions of dollars for community programs.\n\nIn a PR career spanning three decades, Salzman has served as CEO of Havas PR North America and chair of the Havas Global PR Collective. In 2018 she moved to Philip Morris International (PMI) as senior vice president, global communications, to help the company deliver a smoke-free future.\n\nSalzman guides PMI’s communications, media and other stakeholder engagement, forging productive alliances with NGOs, advocacy groups, policymakers and others. The end goal: making it easier for adult smokers to move away from cigarettes and toward the better science-based alternatives now available.\n\nUsing her global platform to combat misinformation, promote transparency and advance positive change, Salzman sparks conversations around important issues via her annual trends report, newsletter and PMI whitepapers — including “Hate Is in the Air,” a report that dissects the drivers of hate and challenges companies to contribute to solutions.\n\nShe says curiosity and energy are the most important skills for communicators. “If you aren’t in continuous learning mode, you will quickly be left behind.” She lives out that advice herself: Salzman told Ragan that she was taking remote courses in government at Johns Hopkins University when the pandemic began. “This engagement gave me a whole lot of brainfood at a time when socialization was largely screen-based. I developed considerable expertise by going back to school thirty-odd years after I had completed my formal education, and this made me a much better leader and professional. Studenting also knocked any arrogance I had right out of my system.”\n\nAs a commentator for a range of global and national media outlets, Salzman has been featured on the BBC, NBC News, Euronews, Sky News and Bloomberg Radio, as well as podcasts like Andrew Yang’s “Forward.” She also regularly serves as a keynote speaker or panelist at such venues as GWPR VOICE, IAA Creativity 4 Better Conference, University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business and more, and is the author or co-author of 18 books.\n\nHer advice to rising communicators: “Go abroad frequently, work there feverishly, savor the friendships you made in the early days because at the end of a career, it is the experience collecting, the human relationships, that carry you forward and make you better and more able to face the challenges day-to-day. I also wish I had become addicted to Pilates earlier, had embraced casual dress sooner, and would have dreamed as big as life carried me. I always treasured the journey and picked bosses but never planned my career, so I wish I would have known how lucky I would be — that would have made it easier to relax more, to worry less, and to have confidence that I would never have to compromise ‘me’ to succeed in the world of ‘we.’”\n\nCongratulations to Marian Salzman!\n\nVice President, Chief Communications and Marketing Officer\n\nSPX FLOW\n\nMelissa Buscher champions employees, women and the community at SPX FLOW\n\nThe TV reporter turned corporate communicator, Melissa Buscher, supports her employer, women and the community, making her a true Bridge Builder in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nMelissa Buscher spent 15 years as an award-winning television reporter before shifting gears to a career in corporate communications and marketing. As chief communications and marketing officer at SPX FLOW, she fills one of six senior leadership roles in the company as the only woman in the group. Buscher is focused on supporting others, whether it’s promoting her team’s work, championing women or improving the lives of people in her community.\n\nFor instance, Buscher learned from production workers at SPX FLOW’s global manufacturing sites that employees didn’t know how their products were being used. To bridge that knowledge gap, Buscher created a campaign, “Solution City,” to show employees and external stakeholders how the parts employees produce play a role in everyday life; this ultimately led the company to start referring to employees as Solution Makers.\n\nBuscher also transformed the marketing team into strategic partners instead of mere order takers. Under her direction, marketing became a major revenue generator for the company — one marketing event, for example, brought in $10 million in business opportunities.\n\nShe’s created blogs and podcasts to help employees hear more from leaders, improving transparency throughout the company. In addition, Buscher uses her network to make connections, referrals and introductions between people, to ensure everyone around her has the opportunity to maximize their potential.\n\nCommunity service also plays an essential role in her life. Buscher is currently the chair of the board of advisors for Designed for Joy, a nonprofit providing stability to women in crisis through immediate employment and support. She is also a marketing committee member for A Place at the Table, a pay-what-you-can restaurant supporting people experiencing homelessness. Beyond that, she sits on the board of advisors of United Partnerships, an organization that collaborates on initiatives that lift individuals, organizations and communities with focus areas including workplace culture, employee resource groups, community engagement and collaboration.\n\nShe is also an advocate for DE&I and is passionate about mentoring and sponsorship. Buscher serves as executive sponsor for SPX FLOW’s BEGIN, an employee resource group for young professionals. Before that, she was the executive sponsor for EMPOWER, an employee resource group dedicated to empowering women. In addition, Buscher is a regular guest speaker and mentor for SPX FLOW’s women’s leadership program.\n\nCongratulations to Melissa Buscher!\n\nVice President of Global Marketing and Global Brand Owner\n\nBerry Global, Inc.\n\nLaci Hasenour champions sustainability in the plastics industry at Berry Global\n\nAt Berry Global, Laci Hasenour developed a vast campaign to convince the industry and its customers to do ‘More Together’ to reuse and recycle their products. She’s a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nThree years ago, Laci Hasenour brought her 14 years of sales and marketing experience to Berry Global, a manufacturer and marketer of plastic packaging products. As vice president of global marketing, Hasenour runs worldwide marketing and communications for 40,000 employees across more than 250 locations and has helped transform 47 companies acquired by Berry into a single, global brand.\n\nOne of Hasenour’s major accomplishments has been developing Berry’s “More Together” initiative — a campaign to educate Berry employees, customers and partners about creating positive change by collaborating across the plastics value chain.\n\nHasenour and her team spent 11 months developing the design, communications and corporate brand teams deployed in the campaign. “More Together” was launched in November 2022 at Chicago’s Pack Expo. Among all 2,221 digital showrooms at the expo, the booth Hasenour helped design scored the top 5 ratings across all five sustainability categories. The 2,500 views of the booth resulted in 944 unique leads, a 352% increase in recorded interactions, along with 1,494 unique contacts.\n\nUnder her leadership, Berry’s external communications team created joint communication plans supporting “More Together” in collaboration with Wendy’s, McCormick, Heinz and many more companies. The initiative’s success ultimately made it the theme for the company’s 2022 annual ESG report.\n\nIn addition, Hasenour created a campaign calling on all Berry employees to ask customers and partners one simple question: “What’s your more?” By encouraging people to share their “more,” Berry can identify and listen to the people’s commitment to sustainability, helping the company turn insights into actions that help keep resources in use and out of our environment.\n\nCongratulations to Laci Hasenour!\n\nVice President, Internal Communications\n\nCognia\n\nKimberly Leidgertwood keeps the past and future connected at Cognia\n\nKimberly Leidgertwood edits the company newsletter, preserving its history and helping employees succeed. She’s a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nThroughout her 30+ year career, Kimberly Leidgertwood, vice president of internal communications at Cognia, has been an advocate of the employee. That means working with leadership to ensure that perspectives from the workforce get shared upward while also serving on cross-functional teams, employee resource groups and task forces to expand the reach and role of internal communications.\n\nAs the editor of the company newsletter “Connections,” Leidgertwood gathers leads throughout the organization to publish timely news, getting ahead of concerns and suggesting topics for the CEO’s editorial piece. In the past year, her guidance has led to a spike in readership with over a 70% open rate and consistent positive feedback. She also serves as the organization’s historian, taking responsibility for archiving and preserving Cognia’s history.\n\nLeidgertwood also spearheaded the launch of Cognia’s Reference Library, a living repository of all the resources, documents and tools the marketing and communications team creates to support internal staff. She took on the project after realizing employees were having difficulty locating the information they needed to do their jobs.\n\nIn addition, Leidgertwood serves as liaison to Cognia’s board of directors, supervising the delivery of its quarterly report and biweekly newsletter. Board members recognize Leidgertwood as a steady leader with her finger on the pulse of the organization.\n\n“As my manager,” says one of Leidgertwood’s direct reports, “Kimberly has created a myriad of opportunities for me to learn from her, enhance my communication skills and reach my professional goals. Beyond the work, Kimberly has become a trusted confidante and mentor. She is the leader that I aspire to emulate because she simply has that personal touch that separates the good from the great.”\n\nCongratulations to Kimberly Leidgertwood!\n\nChief Communications & Public Affairs Officer\n\nBeyond Finance\n\nYolanda Schufford goes above and beyond at Beyond Finance\n\nYolanda Schufford is protecting consumers by educating the public and influencing policymakers about debt issues, making her a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nDebt resolution company Beyond Finance is dedicated to helping clients achieve financial freedom and promote sound policy in an industry regulated at the federal and state levels. As chief communications and public affairs officer, Yolanda Schufford oversees its corporate communications (internal and external), public affairs and government relations — as well as managing lobbyists in key states while sharing information and fighting misinformation with policymakers and regulators.\n\nThe firm offers group and individual financial counseling to help people significantly reduce their debt. Beyond Finance works with psychotherapists and analysts to help media, policymakers and consumers understand the mental and physical impact of “financial PTSD.” Schufford’s media and public information campaigns educate both the public and policymakers about how debt resolution helps people.\n\nSchufford is also focused on protecting consumer rights. She was instrumental in helping stave off potentially restrictive legislation in debt resolution programs for North Carolina consumers. She also helped transform potentially harmful policies in California. In New York and New Jersey, Schufford was part of a team that introduced a model bill designed to initiate positive industry legislation.\n\nDuring Schufford’s tenure on the executive team, Beyond Finance has grown its internal outreach from 400 employees to more than 1,500 across 49 states. Externally, her focus has been growing the company as a new brand in a niche market; as a result, Beyond Finance has grown into one of the country’s largest and most influential debt resolution organizations.\n\nOutside her role at Beyond Finance, Schufford also serves on the board of an industry trade association, the American Fair Credit Council, and two nonprofits: Women of Debt Relief and Mentoring Brother2Brother.\n\nCongratulations to Yolanda Schufford!\n\nVice President of Corporate Affairs\n\nRoyal Canin North America\n\nTalk to the animals: Racquel White forges connections between pets, humans and Royal Canin North America\n\nAt Royal Canin North America, Racquel White’s efforts have supported animal adoption, vet care and more, while also celebrating her community. She’s a Bridge Builder in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nRacquel White is in a unique point of connection for pet owners, industry partners and Mars, Inc. brands. As vice president of corporate affairs for Mars subsidiary Royal Canin North America (RCNA), which specializes in the health and nutrition of dogs and cats, White oversees internal and external communications, sustainability, regulatory and client experience teams while serving as spokesperson for the Royal Canin brands.\n\nIn 2023, White gave Royal Canin’s support to Missouri’s Puppies for Parole program, in which residents of the state’s prisons train rescue dogs to become more adoptable. To celebrate the program’s 7,000th adoption, White and her corporate team highlighted the program internationally through visits by Royal Canin’s global leadership team. White also spotlighted Canine Companions, the leading organization of the American service dog industry, through her team’s PSA, “Help Them Meet Their Match Sooner.”\n\nFor cat lovers, Aug. 22 marked National Take Your Cat to the Vet Day. This was the RCNA brand’s tentpole campaign spotlighting preventive health for felines. Because transportation can be a problem for some cat owners, White and her team launched a first-of-its-kind partnership with Uber Pet, providing up to 5,000 rides in 15 cities, encouraging riders to take their cats to the vet.\n\nInternally, White serves as a sponsor for Royal Canin’s TuVoz Associate Resource Group (ARG), guiding its mission of building a Hispanic community that celebrates individual nationalities while recognizing the union of language and heritage. In this role, White advocates for diverse associates joining the company and her team at all levels through her connection to The LaGrant Foundation, which supports increasing the number of ethnic minorities in communications-related fields.\n\nWhite’s commitment to animals extends to her personal life as well. She’s written a children’s book series, “My Adoption: A Max Brown Adventure,” in honor of the rescue and adoption story of her dog Max. Meanwhile, she serves on the board of directors for the Moses White Foundation, supporting underprivileged populations in Tampa, Florida, through scholarships and revitalization initiatives.\n\nCongratulations to Racquel White!\n\nSenior Director, Communications\n\nMacmillan Learning\n\nMarisa Bluestone wrote the book on crisis response at Macmillan Learning\n\nMarisa Bluestone’s crisis manual lays out the rules for responding to any crisis. She’s a Crisis Navigator in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nMacmillan Learning’s mission is to inspire every learner with possibilities amid the continued debate on the value and cost of content, the growth of open educational resources, data privacy concerns and legislation seeking to control the content allowed in K12 and college courses. As senior director of communications at Macmillan Learning for the past five years, Marisa Bluestone’s mission has been to help the company adapt to the changing needs of educators, students and institutions.\n\nIn 2023 Bluestone set out to create a new, more focused process and policy for responding to crises that threaten its brand and reputation. If a crisis occurred, Bluestone knew the company would need all its stakeholders to be ready, so she worked closely with executive leadership to develop a crisis manual for the organization.\n\nThe manual established basic processes and media policies for employees to follow in navigating crises when they strike. Bluestone also created test cases for every department, illustrating how the plan should be implemented and what results to expect. She then met with each team to train employees on the new crisis processes and procedures.\n\nBluestone put her work into action to protect Macmillan Learning and its brand against 2023’s challenges. Whether confronting a major crisis or a small issue, she was able to quickly coordinate the company’s teams for the right response and achieve a positive result, using each crisis as an opportunity to review and revise the plans for the future.\n\nBluestone made a difference in the company’s ability to act and respond quickly to any crisis. Just as important, her work has made a positive impact on relationships with employees, stakeholders, and customers.\n\nCongratulations to Marisa Bluestone!\n\nOneTrust\n\nAmid ongoing crises, OneTrust’s Kristy Campbell kept her cool\n\nOneTrust endured a stream of negative events in 2023, but Kristy Campbell guided the company into positive territory. She’s a true Crisis Navigator in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nKristy Campbell and her team had a busy year in 2023. As chief communications officer at OneTrust, a privacy and security software provider, she was in charge of handling the company’s response to whatever crises may arise.\n\nFor example, after a substantial workforce reduction in 2022, the company faced a crisis early in 2023 when an M&A deal was abruptly halted, leading to the layoff of another 200 employees. The reduction drew lots of attention, resurfacing the layoff news from the previous summer. Campbell and the two other members of her team had to swiftly devise comprehensive strategies to manage both internal and external narratives and keep the company’s reputation intact.\n\nIn February, OneTrust’s CEO was hit by a surprise lawsuit from two board members and investors. Campbell’s team had to navigate the complex legal and reputational challenges to keep employees focused and limit the headlines. The team’s strategy to keep pumping out product stories and amplify positive news successfully pushed the lawsuit headlines to the third page of Google search.\n\nThen, in March, the M&A cancellation of the previous year caused a string of customer contracts to be revoked. Campbell and her team orchestrated the transition to a new vendor at OneTrust’s expense to ensure that customer relationships remained intact and negative news didn’t erupt on social media or in the press.\n\nAugust 2023 brought a complex product incident. Campbell and the team had to master the regulatory and legal requirements limiting what the company could share with customers. The balancing act of providing daily updates while protecting certain kinds of information was a challenge, but the team effectively guided the company through the turbulent period.\n\nThrough their highly targeted media relations work, the team dominated share of voice (SOV) among competitors in data privacy, substantially increasing SOV quarter over quarter. Positive media coverage in 2023 soared, and negative coverage declined by over half.\n\nCongratulations to Kristy Campbell!\n\nSystem Vice President Public Relations and Content Strategy\n\nCommonSpirit Health\n\nGina Czark jumps into action during ransomware attack at CommonSpirit Health\n\nCommonSpirit Health wanted to minimize the media fallout from the attack. Gina Czark took control of the narrative, making her a Crisis Navigator in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nGina Czark has slept near her cell phone since her early days as a journalist and PR executive. When a call came before sunrise on Oct. 3, 2022, she sprang into action. Her employer, CommonSpirit Health, had just fallen victim to a ransomware attack.\n\nCommonSpirit Health is one of the largest nonprofit health systems in the country, and the attack had the potential for a $160 million impact. Czark had to get briefed, devise a strategy to communicate accurate information to stakeholders, align a fragmented communications team, manage an onslaught of questions and report regularly to leaders.\n\nHer first big decision was answering the key question all communicators face in a crisis, changing moment by moment: How much can we say? During daily meetings, Czark counseled executive leaders and the legal team to limit communications to the minimum necessary while she and her team wrote simple media statements, updating them as events unfolded. Her strategy kept the story from going mainstream and gave CommonSpirit a degree of control over the narrative.\n\nCzark also created a centralized communications process: All communications requests had to funnel through her and her team for approval. To manage the hundreds of requests, she held twice-daily review sessions with legal, compliance, IT and other stakeholders. In addition, she established twice daily war room meetings with the leaders of regional communications teams across the country while building a nearly 24/7 communication channel to track, monitor and triage requests.\n\nAs a result of Czark’s efforts, the story was barely mentioned in mainstream national news media and didn’t go viral on social media or online forums. The sparse national coverage that did appear fit in with CommonSpirit’s narrative. In the end, CommonSpirit emerged with a more centralized and integrated communications function and a playbook for the next crisis.\n\nCongratulations to Gina Czark!\n\nDirector of Communications\n\nCorn Refiners Association\n\nInfluential ‘Feeding the Economy’ report is just one priority for Jacqueline Boggess at the Corn Refiners Association\n\nFor the Corn Refiners Association, Jacqueline Boggess handles strategic communication, advocacy and CEO support, but wrangling the data into shape for this yearly report is key. She’s a Data Dynamo in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nOne of Jacqueline Boggess’ key responsibilities as director of communications for the Corn Refiners Association (CRA) — in addition to crafting and implementing strategic communications plans, contributing to advocacy and offering direct support to the CEO — is CRA’s annual “Feeding the Economy” (FTE) research study.\n\nEvery year, Boggess and her team create a “farm-to-fork” analysis to illustrate the food and agriculture sector’s impact on local, state and nationwide economic activity, distributing the data on National Ag Day (March 21) each year. The data is used by policymakers at the national, regional and local levels of government to make important legislative decisions.\n\nFor FTE 2023, Boggess used an earned media outreach strategy to target national, policy and trade outlets for coverage. Weeks before the launch of the report, the team placed an op-ed by CRA president and CEO John Bode in Agri-Pulse, a top outlet in the agricultural industry with more than 50,000 unique viewers. The piece used data from the report to offer a unique perspective on the agricultural industry, showing that it has bounced back from major economic setbacks but isn’t yet reaching its full potential due to the U.S. pausing its pursuit of new tariff-reducing trade agreements.\n\nOne week before the launch, Boggess and her team shared a press release under embargo, targeting a highly tailored media list focused on national, policy and trade media, offering interviews with the CEO. At the state level, the team conducted local media market outreach, an effort that included targeting CRA priority policymakers’ states and member headquarters locations.\n\nThe effort was a success. Earned media for the report exceeded previous years’ benchmarks, generating 61 mentions — a 27% increase from 2022. The media hits drove traffic to the report’s website, with 3,164 unique views and an average visit of two minutes and nine seconds.\n\nCongratulations to Jacqueline Boggess!\n\nVP, Research & Analytics\n\nEvolveMKD\n\nFrom ‘fake news’ to matters of representation, Alex Christian provides compelling food for thought at Evoke MKD\n\nAlex Christian’s research has grown revenues for Evoke MKD and earned her a name as a thought leader. She’s a Data Dynamo in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nEvery single department in Evoke MKD relies on Alex Christian’s research reports, making her an invaluable member of the PR agency’s team. As vice president and head of EvokeMKD’s research and analytics department, she is responsible for measurement, reporting and proprietary research for the agency and all clients, and her duties include evaluating clients’ reporting to identify meaningful metrics and then executing global strategic and thought leadership research on their behalf.\n\nChristian recently launched Evoke MKD’s proprietary research platform, the Evolution of Communication and spearheaded the platform’s case study, “From ‘Fake News’ to ‘News You Can Use’” in February 2023. The case study focused on the relationship between media and media consumers. Evoke MKD surveyed 1,000 media consumers and 500 media professionals to get their thoughts on the media landscape and the importance of traditional and social media and found that “fake news” was the catalyst for a resurgence in media consumption. The research was shared in various arenas, including as a webinar with Cosmetic Executive Women.\n\nChristian also created a research-based thought leadership platform to explore the idea of inclusive and representative beauty. Conducted via focus groups, her research focused on the importance of representation, but it also emphasized that education, intent and execution matter even more while spotlighting the harm that the tokenization of historically non-Caucasian features causes non-white women.\n\nSince her hire, Christian’s department has grown in revenues from $33,000 in 2021 to $1.8M million in 2023. Outside EvokeMKD, Christian authored the recent refresh of the Barcelona Principles 3.0, a widely recognized industry standard for PR and communications measurement and evaluation — solidifying her position as a thought leader and a standout in the PR industry.\n\nCongratulations to Alex Christian!\n\nVice President, Communications & Community\n\nAndersen Corporation\n\nEliza Chlebeck opens a window on Andersen’s inclusive culture\n\nEliza Chlebeck made the intranet accessible to all, brought in more diverse influencers and much more, making her a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Champion in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nIn her five-year tenure at window and door manufacturer Andersen, Eliza Chlebeck, vice president of communications and community, has displayed a consistent commitment to advancing DE&I.\n\nOne of her key accomplishments was the launch of the “Circle” intranet. Previously only accessible to office-based employees and in English, Chlebeck was determined to ensure that all employees, including those in manufacturing, had equal access to the information and resources they needed to do their jobs in their spoken language.\n\nChlebeck and her team implemented the new intranet in 17 facilities and within nine employee resource network groups, bridging gaps between employees. Now accessible via mobile app, the Circle supports 37 languages. Seventy-six percent of the company’s employees use the platform, more than 6,000 mobile apps have been downloaded and 85% engage with it several times per week. Seventy-four percent of employees say they’re very likely to recommend the Circle to their colleagues.\n\nShe’s also committed to accessibility and the importance of making Andersen content available to everyone, including those who are deaf, hard of hearing or non-native English speakers. Chlebeck worked with Andersen’s internal videography team to set standards for subtitles on all videos, both internal and external, ensuring accessibility for everyone.\n\nIn addition, Chlebeck led the PR team in broadening Andersen’s influencer partnerships; now, more than 65% of its current influencers include representation from LQBTQIA, BIPOC/BIPOC women, AAPI, Latinx and military/veteran communities around the country.\n\nChlebeck also amplifies DE&I stories externally, showcasing Andersen’s people and highlighting philanthropic partners. In 2023, she mobilized internal teams to participate in external interviews to shed light on the company’s progress in fostering inclusivity for Andersen’s deaf and hard-of-hearing workforce, complete with testimonials from hearing-impaired employees. The interviews were featured in six placements and garnered nearly 4.5 million impressions, along with substantial media attention.\n\nCongratulations to Eliza Chlebeck!\n\nSenior Account Executive\n\nFrench/West/Vaughan (FWV)\n\nMadeline Hiller champions DE&I in many different arenas at French/West/Vaughan\n\nMadeline Hiller pushed for greater diversity in the golfing community and led the charge for HBCU marching bands, making her a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Champion in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications Awards, Class of 2024.\n\nMadeline Hiller, senior account executive at French/West/Vaughan (FWV), has put her commitment to DE&I into action in several ways. She’s the account lead promoting Steph Curry’s Underrated Golf Tour (UGT), founded to provide equity, access and opportunity to deserving student-athletes from underserved communities who may not otherwise be exposed to the full benefits of the sport. She’s also worked to gain greater exposure for the HBCU All-Star Battle of the Bands, the world’s original and largest Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) showcase for marching bands and dance teams.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of both efforts:\n\nUGT\n\nThe UGT seeks to increase the participation of competitive golfers from diverse backgrounds while engaging corporate partners for mentoring, networking and visibility. Players receive valuable exposure to college golf programs and potential partners, along with training, equipment, leadership panels and other benefits from tour sponsors.\n\nDue in large part to Hiller’s work, the 2023 UGT’s results amplified its mission of increasing participation in golf among diverse junior golfers. Hiller created more than 35 media pitches and 13 media lists, generating 220 placements (up from 18 in 2022), and 2.8 billion impressions. On social media, she boosted UGT’s Instagram following by 101% and its TikTok following by 165%.\n\nThe UGT plans to expand throughout the U.S. and around the world, creating further diversity in the pool of junior, collegiate and professional players worldwide.\n\nHBCU All-Star Battle of the Bands\n\nHiller spearheaded efforts to establish the HBCU All-Star Battle of the Bands as the premier showcase for marching bands. Her work, reaching a diverse audience, attracted thousands of attendees to the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, to watch the event, resulting in a total of 57 media features that reached more than 99.5 million readers for a total PR value of $10.4 million.\n\nOther activities around the event included the HBCU All-Star Battle of the Bands college fair at the College Football Hall of Fame, which provided thousands of attendees with an opportunity to learn about more than 45 HBCUs and their academic and band programs. Students were able to apply on-site, waiving their student application fees (a $20,000 value annually); they even had opportunities for scholarships, which historically have been valued at up to $452,000.\n\nOn the personal front, Hiller has also volunteered with World Relief for the past two years as a tutor and friendship partner for refugee families in the Durham, N.C. area, and has begun volunteering with Young Lives to provide childcare so teen moms in the Durham/Chapel Hill, N.C. area can pursue community and mentorship opportunities.\n\nCongratulations to Madeline Hiller!\n\nFounder and CEO\n\nThe Brand Agency\n\nPriscila Martinez takes top-tier clients to new realms at The Brand Agency\n\nPriscila Martinez works with companies like Amazon Prime and Miss Universe, guiding them through new opportunities while keeping an eye on inclusion in her agency’s work. She’s a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Champion in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nPriscila Martinez is the founder and CEO of The Brand Agency, serving clients like Apple Pay, Disney and Amazon with a female-only team.

Martinez connected this specialized task force with top affiliate partnership platforms, forming relationships with stakeholders to assess the best channels for its diverse e-commerce client roster, as well as programming education into the company’s enrichment curriculum.\n\nMartinez’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion extends to her community. She is a mentor through Big Brother Big Sister of L.A. and an advisor for Latinas in Tech. In addition, she runs a program for immigrant, Spanish-speaking seniors, teaching them about wellness and technology.\n\nMartinez also sits on the board of the Tierra Del Sol Foundation, which empowers individuals with developmental disabilities through programs in workforce development, moving from college to career, and careers in the arts.\n\nShe’s been recognized for her work, earning recognitions like “Best in Business: Communications” by Inc. Magazine, “Top Agency” by PR Daily and more.\n\nCongratulations to Priscila Martinez!\n\nSenior Vice President\n\nClyde Group\n\nClyde Group’s Jenny Wang keeps the PR industry focused on DE&I\n\nJenny Wang ensures advocates are heard by organizing events, speaking at roundtables and more, making her a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Champion in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAs DE&I has become a key business issue, both internally and externally, Jenny Wang has emerged as one of the premier DE&I comms leaders in the PR industry.\n\nAs senior vice president at the Clyde Group, Wang has been a voice for the agency’s Inclusivity, Diversity, Equity and Accountability (IDEA) working group, promoting greater diversity of thought in the workplace and beyond. She organized activities around AAPI Heritage Month, Pride Month, Immigrant Heritage Month, Hispanic Heritage Month and more, bringing in guest speakers to share their experiences and organizing/hosting panel discussions.\n\nThat’s not all. Wang also leads Clyde Group’s largest account: the patient advocacy function of Gilead, a Fortune 150 pharma company. She helps ensure patient advocates are heard — especially those from underserved communities — as well as emphasizing patients’ voices throughout Gilead. As part of this, Wang helped organize and execute Gilead’s inaugural Breast Cancer Advocacy Summit in March 2023; the summit brought leading national breast cancer advocates from across the country to Gilead’s HQ for two-way sharing and community building.\n\nWang currently serves as a board member of International Social Service USA, an organization that supports, protects and reunites vulnerable children, adults and families who are separated by international borders — work that Wang, an immigrant herself, finds particularly rewarding.\n\nWang is regularly invited to speak at events focused on DE&I; she was the keynote speaker at an American University AAPI Alumni Lunar New Year celebration, where she focused on mental health issues within the AAPI community. She was also a guest panelist for an event on women’s empowerment, diversity and inclusion hosted by Neiman Marcus and the Association of Corporate Counsel.\n\nCongratulations to Jenny Wang!\n\nLead US PR Manager for Smartphones and Lifestyle - Mobile\n\nSamsung Electronics America\n\nHolland Behn’s storytelling skills help Samsung’s biggest product soar\n\nHolland Behn and her team shape the narratives for one of Samsung’s biggest categories: mobile phones. Her creativity and ability to stay on top of a competitive smartphone sector have led to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nHolland Behn, lead U.S. PR manager for smartphones and lifestyle, mobile, oversees everything for the category, including earned, paid, shared and owned channels to drive brand affinity. At Samsung’s Galaxy Unpacked events twice a year, Behn oversees PR launches for its products and creates unique strategies to bring about earned media coverage. For instance, her team successfully launched foldable smartphones from scratch, which received positive media coverage — in fact, coverage for product launches have incrementally grown under her expert guidance.\n\nBeyond smartphone PR, Behn also handles PR efforts for marketing and lifestyle activations to connect Samsung users with their products and ways to use them. And as with her other PR ventures, creativity plays a massive role in how she and her team help amplify these campaigns. Leading up to the Galaxy S23 event, Behn’s team arranged coverage for the #DropTheFilter partnership with Brit + Co.\n\nSustainability has become a prevalent theme for much of the lifestyle partnership work Behn has overseen. In April, her team worked with a team in South Korea to coordinate Nylon House at Coachella in an activation that brought artists together to create an installation made from recycled smartphones. They also worked with Jaden Smith’s brand MSFTSrep, making eco-conscious accessories for Samsung products and led another activation with sustainable designer Sean Wotherspoon to create a sustainable Galaxy S21 and Galaxy Watch4 accessories to coincide with Earth Day.\n\nBehn’s ability to stay on top of trends and topics that are important to consumers solidifies her as a communications leader.\n\nCongratulations to Holland Behn on this career milestone!\n\nSenior Vice President of Communications\n\nUFC\n\nLenee Breckenridge knows how to kick it up a notch for UFC\n\nLenee Breckenridge is a powerhouse communications expert, leading media relations and operations for all of UFC’s global live events and publicity for more than 550 athletes on its roster. Her ability to juggle so many high-level tasks for the brand is why she’s a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nIn her 10 years with UFC, Lenee Breckenridge, senior vice president of communications, has risen into an executive role and helped lead the brand to four consecutive years of growth. Last year, she was promoted to SVP of communications and landed national and local coverage for the brand’s record-breaking ticket sales and live events attendance. The events she promoted last year alone included UFC 284 (Perth), UFC 287 (Miami), UFC 288 (Newark), UFC 289 (Vancouver), UFC London, UFC 291 (Salt Lake City), UFC 292 (Boston), UFC 293 (Sydney) and UFC Paris.\n\nIn addition to managing publicity for athletes, she also handles media opportunities for CEO Dana White and media relations for both Power Slap, the leading slap-fighting organization, and content generator Thrill One Sports & Entertainment. She also led PR for the most recent season of “The Ultimate Fighter,” UFC’s spinoff reality series, which was broadcast on ESPN for the first time.\n\nWhen UFC merged with WWE and rebranded as TKO in September, Breckenridge organized opportunities for White to discuss the news, which included an opportunity to ring the bell at the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIn September, UFC hosted Noche UFC, a Fight Night on Mexican Independence Day to celebrate the brand’s Hispanic athletes and fans. She worked across the company to secure sponsorships, including one from Jose Cuervo held in Tequila, Mexico.\n\nThis year marks UFC’s 30th anniversary, which Breckenridge is — unsurprisingly — steadfastly working on unique ways to spotlight the brand’s achievements.\n\nCongratulations to Lenee Breckenridge for this knockout career win.\n\nDirector, US Communications and Employee Engagement\n\nHaleon\n\nCortney Collins has proved herself a trusted advisor among Haleon’s leadership\n\nCortney Collins has been pivotal in many of the initiatives Haleon (formerly GSK Consumer Healthcare) has undertaken in the past year, which is why she’s being recognized as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nWhen Haleon first split from the Pfizer Consumer Healthcare and GSK Consumer Healthcare merger, Cortney Collins, director of U.S. communications and employee engagement, led the charge on internal communications, handling everything from its strategies for digital and leader communications to rolling out a U.S. diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and special employee projects initiatives.\n\nNot only that but when the company hit its first anniversary, she then oversaw communications to commemorate the day.\n\nIn what can often be a turbulent time, Collins helped smooth the transition and found ways to celebrate the business internally and externally.\n\nThis included handling a U.S. newsletter, rolling out a new employee engagement channel (Viva Engage) and setting up other internal resources via an intranet page. Since 2021, she has collected employee sentiment data, which helped further evolve the newsletter strategy and led to an almost 10-point increase in engagement through open rates, up to 49% from a previously historic 39%. Collins has also prioritized making Haleon more inclusive, serving on the U.S. DEI Council and building culture through the Culture Champ Network.\n\nCollins has been adept at working with high-level staff, with her team training more than 400 leaders through “Building Inclusive Leadership Skills” workshops since 2021, which help reduce potentially harmful behaviors in the workplace. She has also brought more than 10 guest speakers to a U.S. DE&I speaker series to bring in outside experts. Further, she manages the social strategy, finds speaking engagements and helps coordinate town halls and Haleon meetings for the U.S. general manager.\n\nFinding opportunities to give back has also been a priority in many ways for Collins, who helped organize onsite volunteer opportunities for the “Haleon Helps” program. She also oversaw a partnership with Direct Relief across 12 Haleon sites to build 6,000 hygiene kits for 37 health clinics.\n\nSo, whether it’s a charitable contribution, overseeing leadership opportunities or making a transition seamless, Collins has proven herself a pro.\n\nSenior Program Specialist, Communications\n\nInstitute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO)\n\nKenzie Freeman sets a high standard for others to follow\n\nFor close to 10 years, Kenzie Freeman has greatly impacted the quality of communications at the Institute of Nuclear Power Operation (INPO), which has culminated in her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nWhen it comes to crafting and implementing the strategies for INPO, Kenzie Freeman, senior program specialist, communications, has proved herself a master of communications. She led an integrated campaign for the organization’s new data tool, which received positive feedback from members, particularly around how information was shared.\n\nShe’s established herself as a clear leader in the organization, from launching and developing new initiatives internally to seeking new opportunities to spread INPO’s mission to leading a department. This has taken the form of spearheading a toolkit, seeing it through from development to team member training, and launching a new integrated planning tool between the Change Management and Employee Development departments. She also created an initiative to build a continuous training framework within INPO.\n\nBeyond that, she’s able to stick to a deadline — which has trickled into larger company initiatives. She led a campaign to improve data submittals from members, which were submitted on time for the first time in years.\n\nFreeman has centered her leadership style around a “Know the Business” teaching and learning plan, which has come into play in many ways. At a global communications conference, she presented what she learned from implementing and leading strategies.\n\nBeing in the nuclear power industry has prepared Freeman to easily handle challenging topics. She was the first communications single point of contact with the Industry Response Center when the Russia-Ukraine war began, and she’s led a series of video guides on nuclear safety. She is also involved with the Industry Communications Council and participated in the Newer-to-Nuclear Communications Symposium.\n\nThis honor is just one of many for Freeman, who qualified as a corporate evaluator for member peer reviews and received the President’s Award for communications assistance on a special focus team.\n\nCongratulations on the well-deserved win.\n\nExecutive Vice President, Head of Growth, Financial Services Practice Co-Lead\n\nThe Bliss Group\n\nThe future is bright for The Bliss Group’s Reed Handley\n\nThis past year saw growth, change and innovation for The Bliss Group’s Reed Handley, including being appointed to the agency’s newly created executive leadership team. These accomplishments and her drive, among other talents, have resulted in her being honored as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nIn the last year, Reed Handley, EVP, head of growth and financial services practice co-lead, has played a crucial role in helping marketing communications agency The Bliss Group evolve into its next stage. As the first-ever head of growth, she was one of three executive vice presidents in the company’s history tasked with showing the company’s principles and value to clients, employees and teams alike. Due to her unending hard work, The Bliss Group achieved a 66% win rate and saw double-digit revenue growth year over year.\n\nIt was a year of Ps for Handley, centered around portfolio and performance, practice, people, processes, places and promotion.\n\nIn a tumultuous economy, Handley’s work ensured that not only did the company not lose any clients, but it retained a client satisfaction score of 4.5 out of 5 and reduced overservicing by 43%. As part of that, she launched a management system for better forecasting and strategic planning initiatives, including a new business content library that’s already helped cut time spent on proposals in half. And to help spread the word of The Bliss Group’s mission, she led the creation of a new website, which has driven 50% more leads year over year.\n\nShe also created a financial services practice leadership council to bring in new talent, formed the first-ever growth team and restructured the marketing team. Hence, it had more opportunities for career development.\n\nAnd this isn’t Handley’s only recognition of the last 12 months: She was honored as a SABRE Awards finalist (Best Agency Disruption), PRNews Agency Elite Top 100 and received awards for Large Agency of the Year and B2B Agency of the Year by Bulldog PR Awards.\n\nCongratulations to Reed Handley on this well-deserved win!\n\nVice President, Communications & Marketing\n\nPepco Holdings\n\nAn advocate for important causes, Mayra Hernandez Bergman is helping the industry evolve\n\nMayra Hernandez Bergman has been helping to change communities for the better through her work at Exelon companies PECO and most recently Pepco Holdings and its three utilities across the Mid-Atlantic Region (Pepco, Delmarva Power and Atlantic City Electric). She is driving support for the issues that matter, which is why she’s being honored for her work as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communication, Class of 2024.\n\nWith her work at PECO, Pennsylvania’s largest natural gas and electric provider, Mayra Hernandez Bergman, vice president of communications and marketing, created a series of thought leadership pieces that tackled bold and challenging topics. This included CEO Mike Innocenzo’s pieces on diversity, equity and inclusion, and gun violence, positioning Chief Operations Officer Nicole Levine as an aspiration for women in the energy field, and CCO Funmi Williamson’s takes on customer rights, which have almost doubled her LinkedIn following.\n\nHernandez Bergman’s team has been integral in PECO’s “Path to Clean” initiative, which focuses on environmental goals for the company. She coordinated TV features, event coverage with influencer strategies and over 20 media placements across digital and broadcast, resulting in over $14 million in media value to more than 30 million viewers.\n\nIn just five months at Pepco Holding, she’s leaving a mark on the Mid-Atlantic region through its new “More Than Energy” platform. This included an HBCU commitment to help develop the workforce and create career growth for marginalized employees.\n\nAs a co-executive sponsor of PECO’s Hispanic ERG and a founding executive member of Exelon’s LatinX Executive Council, she’s proven herself time and again as a champion for others. She was also recognized for her diversity, equity and inclusion-related work in 2022 when she was named to Metro Philadelphia Latino Power Players list and as an El Sol Powerful Latino, and then again in 2023 by the city of Philadelphia for her work to support the Hispanic community.\n\nHernandez Bergman is pushing the needle forward for diverse employees in the energy sector and beyond, serving as a mouthpiece and advocate. Bravo from the Ragan team.\n\nChief of Integrated Marketing and Strategy\n\nPAN Communications\n\nMegan Kessler is on an upward trajectory that isn’t slowing down\n\nThough Megan Kessler has only been in her current role at PAN Communications for a year, she’s already overhauled its sales model. Her drive is what has led to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communication, Class of 2024.\n\nIn her newly created role of chief of integrated marketing and strategy, Megan Kessler futureproofs all of PAN’s offerings and tries to map out a path for organic growth and increased revenue. And while she took on a new C-suite-level role when the economy became turbulent and layoffs were prevalent, she approached the new position with fervor and enthusiasm.\n\nIn Q4 2022, she created a “brand to demand” approach for the agency, leading to over 35 organic opportunities and almost $1 million in growth. Under her leadership, these organic growth opportunities have grown by 40%, with organic deal sizes expanding by almost 20%.\n\nHer innovation expands beyond the business side as she helps break the glass ceiling and knock down barriers for young women in the field.\n\nAs part of the work, she did to overhaul the agency’s performance structure, she reworked the framework to focus on continuous growth and goal setting. One of her main priorities was to focus on diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in employee evaluations. She’s been impacted by her childhood with working-class immigrant parents, which she shares to normalize people coming from diverse backgrounds in the industry. Kessler prioritizes mental health and self-care in both her professional and personal lives, which she uses to reshape the industry.\n\nAs an advocate and mentor for marginalized groups, the agency’s DE&I-related promotions boomed in 2022 to 42%, with 41% of all the promotions coming from her team, the largest at the agency.\n\nHer bold, innovative approach to her work will surely keep the agency on the cutting edge in years to come.\n\nCongratulations to Stephanie Kessler for this well-earned honor.\n\nSenior Director Public Relations\n\nAmtrak\n\nChristina Leeds is the steady rail for Amtrak to rely upon\n\nThis past year was one filled with turbulence for Amtrak — derailments, viral social media posts, cybersecurity threats, eminent domain issues and service delays — but Christina Leeds guided the brand through it with a level head, which has contributed to being a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nA defender of Amtrak through crises and pandemic recovery, Cristina Leeds, senior director of public relations, launched an astounding 81 campaigns to raise brand awareness. One of these campaigns was to showcase restored service, such as its Night Owl service, which drove a 40% increase in ridership on Saturdays.\n\nBeyond that, she approached campaigns in a proactive way, designing one to raise awareness about the dangers of railroad crossings through education, media events and partnerships, which garnered national attention. The campaign was covered in 421 stories, reaching over 209 million impressions.\n\nShe also kept an eagle eye on positive earned media moments to capitalize on, like mayoral ribbon cuttings and infrastructure announcements with President Joe Biden. This also reinvented “a new era of rail” by highlighting modernized trains, stations, bridges and tunnels through media coverage and corporate social media campaigns on executives’ channels. Coverage of the new Amtrak Airo across more than 441 stories and 2,300 social media posts, for instance, saw 2 billion impressions and 6,000 clicks on Amtrak’s site.\n\nNow that Amtrak is turning an eye toward wanting to hire in the thousands, Leeds is helping position the company as an attractive workplace and promoting recruitment events. The events in Los Angeles and Seattle saw 2,000 registrations and earned media equivalent to $10,000 in advertising spend.\n\nThrough it all, she’s been a confident and savvy leader who can guide the company through any challenge thrown its way — and will continue to do so.\n\nCongratulations to Christina Leeds on this well-deserved win.\n\nDirector, U.S. Communications\n\nPCL Construction\n\nStephanie McCay is elevating PCL Construction to the next level\n\nStephanie McCay’s dedication to understanding PCL Construction’s mission has helped the business grow and resonate more with its audience, which is why she’s being honored as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nFor a PCL executive’s presentation at the Women in Construction Conference in October 2023, Stephanie McCay, director of U.S. communications, spent hours researching the theme and audience so PCL would shine. As she worked on the keynote over the course of nine months, she handled challenges that presented themselves with ease, including concept changes, rewrites and finding writers and speech coaches. She has gone above and beyond in the workplace and offered additional emotional support by meeting the executive in her home to rehearse and choose her outfit. On the big day itself, she came prepared with an emergency kit, water, makeup and more.\n\nWorking through challenges is a skill McCay has honed, particularly in the last year as she navigated multiple crises. She compiled quick responses to each, leaving PCL’s reputation intact and setting an example of how to stay calm and collected in the face of a stressful situation.\n\nAs her team grew this year, so did her ability to take on new projects while managing said team deftly. She spearheaded a national campaign that resulted in PCL landing on Fortune’s Top 100 Best Companies to Work For list. At the same time, McCay also juggled personnel changes and made sure new talent was quickly up to speed.\n\nNot only has McCay excelled in her role, but she’s also helped PCL excel in its industry as a major player.\n\nCongratulations to her on her recognition with this award!\n\nHead of Global Communications & Industry Marketing\n\nActivision Blizzard\n\nActivision Blizzard’s Claire Nance marketing expertise establishes her as a thought leader\n\nWith 15 years of experience across the U.S. and Australia and a mastery of in-game advertising, Claire Nance’s reputation precedes her, leading to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nClaire Nance, head of global communications and industry marketing, is a gaming expert — though perhaps more behind the scenes than behind the screens.\n\nPart of what makes Nance so skilled in her role is her ability to evolve traditional techniques into modern results. This includes partnerships with advertising groups like the IAB, ANA and MMA Global to showcase Activision Blizzard as an educational resource while also exerting a voice on topical conversations. For instance, through the Activision Blizzard Media’s Attention Measurement Scorecard, Nance brought in media coverage that showcased the brand as a leader with a specific point of view.\n\nShe also led the “Premium by Design” research project, which broke down mobile gaming myths and underscored the brand’s Playables product. The research was used at events, including Advertising Week and the IAB U.S. Playfronts, and overall, the campaign saw the most media coverage for a new product launch in company history. In fact, it sparked new client partnerships, including a Prada Candy X Candy Crush mini-game ad experience.\n\nOver the past year, she has helped Activision Blizzard grow its efforts, leading to year-over-year growth in Q2 2023 across brand advertiser and partner networks. She also grew the company’s external media coverage by 63% year over year, saw a 33% spike in speaking engagements, locked in coverage at all the key trade publications and grew its social media footprint, including a 47% year-over-year increase in LinkedIn followers.\n\nNot only has she been a thought leader on behalf of Activision Blizzard, but Nance has also used her voice to establish herself as a standalone expert, speaking at events including the Campaign Gaming Summit, the AdWanted Future of Gaming Event and Adweek: Cracking the Code Gaming Forum.\n\nBeyond her work for Activision Blizzard, she’s also served as a mentor with organizations like New York Women in Communications and She Runs It and was a board of directors member of the Public Relations Society of America’s New York chapter.\n\nCongratulations to Claire Nance for this well-deserved win.\n\nSupervisor, Brand Communications\n\nMcDonald's\n\nJasmine Palmer’s ‘can-do attitude’ establishes her as an unwavering advocate\n\nJasmine Palmer champions representation and cultural understanding in her work overseeing multicultural communications for McDonald’s Black consumers. Her achievements have earned her recognition as a Dynamic Do-er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nJasmine Palmer, supervisor of brand communications, looks both inward and outward when creating a more equitable and accessible environment at McDonald’s. That starts with ensuring that her team has a seat at the table, digging deep to determine what matters most to the brand’s consumers and developing relationships internally.\n\nShe recently led interview coordination and influencer partnerships for a campaign that recognizes the one in eight Americans who have worked at McDonald’s, which met or exceeded all KPIs, including a 53% earned social media sentiment. Adept in multitasking, Palmer also oversaw key announcements from strategy to execution on the All-American Games event, a high school basketball all-star game, which drove a 70% year-over-year increase in media volume. On the ground (or court), she worked with her personal network to find opportunities for alumni and celebrity participants, and she delivered media coverage from multiple target outlets.\n\nPalmer was also involved with the DE&I conference ColorComm, where she spearheaded its largest activation and attendance, all while staying true to McDonald’s mission of diversifying the supply chain. She brought together 20 McDonald’s colleagues, 10 Black “Change Leaders” who are giving back to their communities and Marcus Graham Project members. She also created a panel around navigating workspaces and professional development.\n\nInternally, Palmer took on an RFP and onboarding process for a new multicultural marcom agency partner and is involved in McDonald’s African American Council (MA2C). She participates in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service, serving breakfasts and leading resume writing and mock interview assistance.\n\nIn her spare time, she continues to walk the walk, serving as a Marcus Graham Project mentor and volunteering with the United Airlines’ Fantasy Flight for terminally ill children program.\n\nCongratulations to Jasmine Palmer for this well-deserved honor.\n\nSenior Manager, Earned Media\n\nAflac\n\nAmy Persons is an integral part of many successful Aflac campaigns\n\nAfter 15 years in Aflac, Amy Persons has played a key role in many of the brand’s most successful campaigns, leading to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nIn the last year alone, Amy Persons, senior manager of earned media, supported eight campaigns that provide more clarity on the medical debt gap, all of which have helped increase brand reputation and visibility. As part of that, she was instrumental in the 2023 CareGrants program, which helps consumers struggling with medical debt. She oversaw distribution of the $1 million Aflac pledged.\n\nShe also played a critical role in the “Dawn’s List” campaign, where the brand pledged support for Dawn Staley, Women’s Basketball Coaches Association and University of South Carolina head coach. Not only did Persons oversee much of the campaign, but she also expertly navigated curveballs and unexpected challenges. And the results were better than expected: initially, Aflac aimed to increase its earned coverage of the campaign by 15% in 2022 — but it blew that out of the water, reaching 360% year-over-year. It received over 877 million impressions and 161 earned media placements.\n\nPersons oversaw the brand communications when Aflac became the title sponsor for Inc.’s annual Peach Bowl in September. She handled everything from strategy to working with external partners to creating bouquets as part of the media reception.\n\nBeyond the work she did on campaigns, Persons has worked on various DEI-related initiatives, including mentorship programs with students at HBCUs. She also created an internal HBCU alumni group where Aflac employees who attended these schools can connect, with more than half of its HBCU employees joining.\n\nShe has shown her ability to juggle all sorts of communications-related projects while also uplifting diverse talent, helping the brand stay true to its vision and mission.\n\nCongratulations to Amy Persons for this well-deserved win.\n\nHead of Global Communications & Marketing\n\nGE\n\nRania Rostom connects communications efforts across continents for GE\n\nRania Rostom has created an environment within GE that shines a spotlight on its reputation, culture and brand. Her ability to navigate global communications with precision and competence has led to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nIn her almost 20 years with GE, Rania Rostom, head of global communications and marketing, has covered communications across the U.S., Canada and Europe, and works with teams in Argentina, Australia, South Africa and Singapore. By connecting international markets, Rostom wants her team to be seen as the “voice of GE in the markets and the voice of the markets in GE.” Rostom focused heavily on finding and developing the right talent with a range of diverse perspectives.\n\nNot only has that mantra allowed for new growth among key stakeholders, but it’s also created opportunities to better understand and learn from consumers. Rostom and her team have used this market knowledge to focus on scaling, strengthening relationships and solidifying consistent local growth, all while navigating different languages and platforms.\n\nSince some of these outlets have been operating for over 100 years, Rostom and her team have had to understand all the nuances and each company’s unique brand identity, then create a cohesive thread to unite across countries and audiences, leading to increased local relevance and value.\n\nBut Rostom didn’t only focus on international growth. She also helped transform GE’s business functions through training marketing communications teams so they could build and understand transitional platforms and processes. These efforts included week-long continuous improvement workshops about market risk mitigation and local storytelling across regions.\n\nCongratulations to Rostom on this recognition and what’s sure to be more achievements to come!\n\nDirector, Corporate Communications\n\nVirgin Pulse\n\nJulie Sculley has leveled up communications at Virgin Pulse\n\nIn just two short years of leading communications at Virgin Pulse, Julie Sculley has helped craft a cohesive brand narrative that elevates the brand’s strategies. Her achievements at such an important time for the brand is why she’s being recognized as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nHaving a story to rely on for communications and press is certainly an asset, which is why Julie Sculley developed messaging that resonated with Virgin Pulse’s mission of changing lives for good. The new approach is more optimistic and truer to the brand’s values and was quickly put to use across web copy, marketing and sales materials, internal presentations, and more.\n\nSo, it only makes sense that she was able to secure more wins and generate more buzz for the company, too. Not only did she increase its visibility through exposure to new audiences in press coverage, but she also had a particularly high win rate for award submissions. Over the last year, she won submissions with Ragan, Fast Company, Stevie Awards and others.\n\nSince she has a knack for storytelling, Sculley was integral when Virgin Pulse merged with HealthComp. Over the span of just a few weeks, she developed communications for clients, partners and employees; a press release and messaging; social media posts; a video from the CEO; town hall decks; emails and more, resulting in 40 media stories.\n\nIt likely comes as no surprise that Sculley is among the first to raise her hand for a new project or to help, so expect to see more achievements from her in the coming years.\n\nCongratulations to Julie Sculley for this well-deserved honor.\n\nSenior Manager of Public Relations & Giving\n\nColdwell Banker Real Estate\n\nAthena Snow carves out a path for leading brands like Coldwell Banker Real Estate\n\nIn more than 21 years with Coldwell Banker Real Estate, Athena Snow has helped the storied brand grow its media exposure and communicate its vision, leading to this recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nAthena Snow, senior manager of public relations and giving, has a knack for melding creativity with strategy that allows her to solidify the brand’s place in the real estate industry in many of its major campaigns.

For instance, she was instrumental in the “Dream” campaign, which refreshed an ad from this year’s football season, helping to tie sports and real estate together.\n\nMany of her contributions have also been driven by helping those in need, too.\n\nThis includes the CB Supports St. Jude program, which she built from scratch. Through it, Coldwell Banker’s more than 100,000 real estate agents are encouraged to donate a portion of every sale or purchase to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. So far, the company has raised close to $2 million.\n\nAt CES, she also assisted with the “Smart Home” campaign, which raised $6 million in two years to build 130 Habitat for Humanity homes, and the Homes for Dogs program that partnered with Adopt-a-Pet.com, which led to tens of thousands of dogs finding homes.\n\nSnow also works closely with local offices to craft tailored PR for openings, expansions and more. She helps companies that join through the Inclusive Ownership program, which aims to increase diverse representation in real estate with marginalized groups. Under her expert leadership, more than 30 companies have joined the program.\n\nSnow has helped uphold the legacy brand’s high standards by contributing equally high-value communications and branding.\n\nBravo to Athena Snow on this well-deserved recognition.\n\nSenior Director, Corporate Communications & Operations\n\nExact Sciences\n\nSteph Spanos exemplifies the importance of being a one-of-a-kind leader\n\nSteph Spanos is someone who can walk into a room and captivate those around her, an asset to her role at Exact Sciences and a contributing factor to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communication, Class of 2024.\n\nIn her five years at Exact Sciences, Steph Spanos, senior director of corporate communications and operations, has logged numerous achievements.

She also oversaw the organization’s storytelling within its corporate affairs team.\n\nA recent brand study found that 54% of healthcare providers, a major target audience for Exact Sciences, had a strong awareness of the company. It also received a reputation score of 72.6, achieved through Spanos’ efforts across earned, owned and paid channels.\n\nAnd that also reflects inward, through both the solid communications department she helped build and the employee engagement survey scores that are at their highest levels ever.\n\nWhen First Lady Jill Biden visited the company’s headquarters in August 2023, Spanos coordinated both reporter invitations and with the White House staff directly and increased overall company visibility through her efforts. Beyond publicizing events, she also manages communications support for the organization’s top five leaders, from writing speeches for speaking engagements and events to crafting statements that are in line with the company’s brand and vision.\n\nAlready, it’s clear Spanos has left her mark on the company and will only continue to do so.\n\nCongratulations to her for this well-earned recognition!\n\nHead of Communications\n\nSpire Global, Inc.\n\nFrom the media side to branding, Kristina Spychalski is well-versed in tech\n\nKristina Spychalski specializes in communications strategies for technology companies, with experience in industries including space, SaaS, fintech and consumer tech.

For instance, her team built the Spire Stats campaign to showcase the company’s space-based data and show insights that the media could use to context current events while learning more about Spire’s mission and values.\n\nShe also leads with logic, remaining calm under pressure and when handling campaigns around serious topics. In an organization with highly technical challenges, she provides a bridge between marketing, product, sales and leadership, resulting in a more cohesive, connected team.\n\nShe oversaw a major campaign around tracking Russian-owned yachts and private planes following sanctions against Russian oligarchs. The media was offered data on these yachts and planes along with branded plugins, images and videos, which resulted in 28 pieces of coverage across leading publications over a four-month period, inclusion in a BBC documentary and a total reach of over 1 billion viewers. Further, it helped Spire’s bottom line and visibility, leading to website traffic increases, new sales opportunities, new media relationships and networking opportunities from other leading publications. Related campaign data has also been featured similarly for investigative and feature articles in major outlets.\n\nThe success of that campaign was just the cherry on top of a delicious sundae of a year for Spychalski.\n\nCongratulations for this well-deserved honor.\n\nDirector, Marketing Communications\n\nSPX FLOW\n\nMichelle Trautman has transformed SPX Flow into a modern hub\n\nUnder Michelle Trautman’s guidance, SPX Flow brought the company’s marketing strategy from trade shows and print into the digital realm, contributing to her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nThe past year saw many cutting-edge developments that have brought SPX Flow onto a new level and increased its bottom line. That includes decisions driven by data — which have become essential for any organization. Rather than simply tracking its metrics, SPX now provides in-depth analysis of its results under the leadership of Michelle Trautman, director of marketing communications.\n\nAnd in keeping with other emerging trends in today’s digital landscape, Trautman led the launch of SPX’s first-ever marketing automation platform, which brought in $4 million in open opportunities from just one email campaign, plus an AI integration that allows the team to stay nimble, efficient and productive.\n\nShe also helped sharpen content in general, beyond the AI refresh. By creating the digital asset management system, she aligned more items with marketing resources and made them more on-brand. The system-provided assets, like templates, increase consistency and have seen an 82% increase in downloads year over year.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this jack-of-all-trades is well-versed in all sorts of multimedia and digital, which also extends to owning SPX’s website, social media platforms and video outputs. Trautman is the first to oversee the website and focused heavily on improving SEO optimization, which has led to a 19% increase in sessions, a 40% increase in page views and a 17% increase in content consumed by page per session. Her team’s more than 85 videos have also been SEO-optimized and shared across multiple platforms.\n\nAnd speaking of platforms, Trautman’s approach to social was to cut back on the channels that weren’t as important to SPX’s target audience, which has spurred a 201% increase in website traffic from social media and $150,000 in sales via a lead generation form on LinkedIn.\n\nBeyond her digital efforts, Trautman has also improved the webinar and live event strategy, achieving a higher ROI due to their lower costs (a potential ROI of 12,400% for just four webinars). The company also hit the global roadshow circuit, resulting in $24 million in open opportunities.\n\nHer transformational skills have helped the company reach new heights that it hopes to keep on exceeding.\n\nCongratulations to Michelle Trautman on this well-deserved win.\n\nSenior Director, Communications\n\nHealthcare Businesswomen's Association\n\nNancy White drives growth for HBA in a constantly changing healthcare sector\n\nNancy White’s tenacity and “roll-up-your-sleeves” approach in leading Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association’s (HBA) communications efforts have earned her a recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s Top Women in Communications, Class of 2024.\n\nSupporting a global membership organization of more than 18,500 members in more than 70 chapters worldwide, Nancy White, senior director of communications, works as a team of one, easily shifting between strategizing and implementation.\n\nDuring new CEO Mary Stutts’ first four months at HBA, White delivered press coverage from more than 300 outlets and found speaking opportunities for Stutts at conferences like The Female Quotient’s Equality Lounge at the G20 Summit in India, the thinc360 Healthcare Congress, the American Black Film Festival and Pfizer’s Racial Equity Roundtable.\n\nShe also applied her skills internally, such as launching the “Horizontal Connections” initiative to help the entirely remote HBA workforce better understand the organization’s priorities and boost morale. As a result, 62% of staff reported that they better understood HBA, a 53% increase from 2022, and 79% better understood how their work helps the organization reach its goals, up from 59% in 2022.\n\nWhite applied her digital expertise by tapping the organization’s partner and volunteer network to create over 200 videos, which have received over 500,000 views so far. And when HBA launched its new website in July, White supported the content strategy and development, which has helped its traffic jump up 30% since this time last year.\n\nFurther, White oversees the nonprofit’s social media efforts, with a particular focus on LinkedIn, where she’s grown followers by 33% to 60,000. She recently led a LinkedIn Live initiative to grow its engagement on the platform further, featuring conversations about topics like Women’s Equality Day, advancing women in corporate America, health equity and campaigns tied to Black History Month and Equal Pay Day.\n\nHer inexhaustibility and versatility allow her to stay on top of a rapidly changing market.\n\nRagan congratulates Nancy White for her commitment to excellence.\n\nDirector, Internal Communications\n\nSeattle Children's Hospital\n\nAlison Zurcher helped Seattle Children’s Hospital bounce back after the pandemic\n\nFrom strategizing to producing deliverables, Alison Zurcher, director of internal communications, has solidified her role as a leader at Seattle Children’s Hospital in her more than 16 years there, which has earned her recognition as a Dynamic Do-Er in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communication Awards.\n\nAlison Zurcher has established herself as a go-getter who’s “willing to roll up her sleeves and dive in,” according to her teammates. While she wears many hats in her role, she has put substantial work into the “Fulfilling Our Mission: Securing Seattle Children’s Future” initiative, which launched in February 2023 to help the organization close its budget gap as it recovered from the pandemic.\n\nFor fiscal year 2023, Zurcher oversaw an extensive communications support package that included a project name, tagline, framework and two internal strategies. The first was a quarterly financial report on financial health and performance, starting with a look at leadership down to all employees. The second provided a plan to keep the company engaged by highlighting successes and distributing takeaways from those wins.\n\nBeyond those two plans, she also created multiple tools to gather supporting research, including a poll to determine employees’ interest and knowledge of finances; an intranet site for the initiative that saw more than 3,000 views per month; an online portal, called Splash, for employees to submit cost-saving ideas, which also included “Splash wins” to celebrate submitted ideas that came to fruition; and a spotlight on various projects that have saved money or improved efficiency..\n\nAll the while, Zurcher remained true to one of Seattle Children’s Hospital’s core tenets: delivering all elements of the initiative in a transparent way.\n\nAnd while she dedicated much of her time to the “Fulfilling Our Mission” project, she also helped with other major initiatives, including developing the organization’s new strategic plan and implementing a resource planning system.\n\nRagan congratulates Alison Zurcher for her commitment to excellence.\n\nCEO\n\nAmendola Communications\n\nJodi Amendola taps tradition to manage change at Amendola Communications\n\nPR firms come and go, especially in these rapidly changing times. For Jodi Amendola, whose firm celebrates 20 years in healthcare PR this year, the best change management relies on traditional values. This leadership style earned Amendola honors in the Leaders category in Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nIt’s not that Jodi Amendola avoids technological progress, far from it. In fact, Amendola Communications’ specialty is PR for healthcare technology, life sciences and healthcare. Still, Amendola believes her firm’s success doesn’t rely on the latest technological solution, but emphasizing traditional PR principles when others are chasing fleeting trends.\n\nThe result is that the agency of 25 account directors obsesses about providing its more than 50 clients with top-notch service, building personal relationships and having an undying curiosity for ways those they represent can emerge from a crowded, competitive field. As such, it’s not a surprise that the firm is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year.\n\nIt’s also no wonder that when the pandemic hit and technology investment ebbed as did hospital budgets, Amendola and the organization stuck to their values. Amendola continued nurturing personal relationships built on 20 years of service. And as the country began emerging from the pandemic’s worst in 2023, Amendola added 17 clients.\n\nAnother thing that’s not surprising — more than 90% of Amendola’s client base represents multi-year and/or repeat business.\n\nAmendola’s steady leadership is also known outside the organization’s walls and client list. She’s a frequent author of thought leadership articles and, in 2023, was named a judge for the UCSF Digital Health Awards and elected an advisory board member to Chilmark Research, the global health IT research firm.\n\nThis year, she and the agency donated time and raised funds for Big Brother Big Sister and American Friends of Magen David Adom — Israel’s national emergency medical service and the country’s International Red Cross representative.\n\nCongratulations to Jodi Amendola!\n\nVice President of Communications\n\nMattress Firm\n\nKatie Clark keeps employees at Mattress Firm consistently informed with dynamic communication\n\nThere are few businesses more competitive than the bedding industry. As such, change is constant. For navigating change with her timely and strategic employee communication as Mattress Firm’s VP and head of communications during its 2023 acquisition, Katie Clark is honored in the Leaders category of Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nColleagues describe Katie Clark, Mattress Firm’s VP and head of communications, as more than a PR professional who understands crafting messages. She’s an “advisor,” they say, a connector, decision maker, influencer and change agent.\n\nWhen she joined Mattress Firm in 2020, the PR team was saddled with a low engagement rate. Clark energized the team, and engagement scores jumped nearly 50 percentage points. In addition, the communications team captured a Gold SABRE Award for “PR Campaign of the Year” in 2022 and Gold Stevie Awards in 2022 and 2023 for “Internal Communications Campaign of the Year.”\n\nClark’s internal work is also stellar. At a time when employee engagement was critical, she revamped the company’s survey program. This promptly drove responses from 67% in 2021 to 76% in 2022 through awareness campaigns. More importantly, she ensured employee suggestions were heard, helping propose more than 600 action items.\n\nClark’s influence also helped grow the company’s social impact initiative, and more than $700,000 in grants and customer donations were given to Mattress Firm’s nonprofit partners last year. Moreover, 5,000 mattresses were donated, up 154% vs 2022. Perhaps most important, employee giving rose 51% year over year.\n\nClark also organized the company’s largest event, VisionCast in February 2023, educating employees about the year’s plans. Almost every participant (96%) rated it “good,” “very good” or “excellent,” while 87% said it provided useful information. This was a prelude to Clark’s work preparing employees and investors for Tempur Sealy’s acquisition of Mattress Firm.\n\nCongratulations to Katie Clark!\n\nAVP, Communications\n\nProvidence\n\nProvidence’s Vanessa DeGier puts patients first before every project\n\nIn marketing lingo, the way Vanessa DeGier approaches everything she does professionally is called applying a brand filter. For the AVP of communications at Providence, her starting point for every action answers the question: How does this benefit our patients? That crystal-clear focus led to an honoree in the Leaders category of Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nA business is most successful when employees know the company’s mission and embody it. The mission is relatively straightforward for Vanessa DeGier, Providence Clinical Network’s AVP of communications: It’s serving patients. Accordingly, before she embarks on any communications project, she asks, ‘How does this benefit our patients?’\n\nDeGier asks this question a lot while leading communications for Providence’s medical groups, ambulatory imaging centers, same-day care, clinical institutes, ambulatory surgery centers, key partnerships and graduate medical education in seven states.\n\nDeGier also advocates for transforming clinical care through supporting work that makes it more accessible and affordable. She looks for ways that Providence can scale innovation and best practices so it can provide greater wellbeing for patients and create a more compassionate, connected healthcare system.\n\nAnd she is as protective of patients as she is of her team of communicators. Leading with grace and empathy, DeGier inspires excellence, while promoting a culture of work-life balance. She constantly checks in with her team to see if their workloads are manageable and asks how she can better support them. As you might guess, she also insists that team members take vacation time and personal days and sees her colleagues as people, not just employees.\n\nAccordingly, DeGier is calm during crises, displaying her leadership while overseeing change management and culture development during restructuring within the organization. She deftly developed a set of transparent and authentic messages that articulated changes within the organization.\n\nNot surprisingly, DeGier’s patience and communication expertise helped her diffuse several large issues, ranging from labor relations to clinic openings/closings.\n\nCongratulations to Vanessa DeGier!\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer\n\nVertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nNina Devlin is a hands-on communicator who battles global diseases at Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nFew communicators have a more difficult role than Nina Devlin, the SVP and CCO at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, who guides medicines through development, trials and approvals in multiple global markets. Her success earned her honors in the Leaders category of Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nSome leaders believe delegating is their most valuable attribute. Not Nina Devlin, SVP and CCO at Vertex Pharmaceuticals. Her mantra, “always stay hands-on,” means she’s intimately involved in building relationships with healthcare media and regulators as she helps guide Vertex’s medicines from trial stages through regulatory approval and market delivery.\n\nAdding a degree of difficulty to Devlin’s role is the fact that Vertex is a global company, requiring her to maintain a vast network and knowledge base. Beyond that, she must also think strategically while operating in international markets. Consider the nuance and cultural issues PR pros rely on as they build relationships with third parties, governments and regulators. Now multiply that several times, and you get an idea of the delicate dances Nina Devlin participates in daily across the globe.\n\nIn addition, Devlin spearheaded a pair of notable efforts in 2023, raising awareness of Vertex’s vision, culture and work in battling some of the world’s most deadly diseases. The first was an awareness campaign for APOL-1-mediated kidney disease, a largely unknown sickness prevalent in people with sub-Saharan African ancestry, featuring former basketball star Alonzo Mourning. Nina also led the creation of a corporate podcast called “Targeting the Toughest Diseases.”\n\nAmong Devlin’s most fulfilling work in 2023 was her partnership with Vertex’s U.S. and international teams as they highlighted the U.S. approval of TRIKAFTA for children ages 2-5 with cystic fibrosis and a positive recommendation for reimbursement of the drug in Brazil.\n\nCongratulations to Nina Devlin!\n\nPublic Relations & External Communications Leader\n\nDeloitte Consulting, LLP\n\nMegan Doern refined external and internal consulting practices through measurement at Deloitte Consulting\n\nTo say Megan Doern is in the perfect job is an understatement. The leader of PR and external communications for Deloitte Consulting, Doern excels in a setting where numbers and efficiency are valued. This is just one of the reasons she was selected for honors in the Leaders category of Ragan’s 2024 Top Women in Communications Awards.\n\nAlthough it’s changing, PR was once considered a profession for people who detested numbers. On the other hand, the field of accounting attracts number-crunchers.\n\nFortunately, Megan Doern, who heads PR and external communication for Deloitte Consulting, an offshoot of the iconic accoun"
