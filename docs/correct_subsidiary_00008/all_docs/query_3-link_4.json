        "text": "Neurogene Inc. (Nasdaq: NGNE), a clinical-stage company founded to bring life-changing genetic medicines to patients and families affected by rare neurological diseases, today announced that Neurogene will be added to the Russell 3000® Index, effective at the open of U.S. equity markets today, Monday, July 1, 2024.\n\nThe annual Russell indexes reconstitution captures the 4,000 largest U.S. stocks as of Tuesday, April 30, 2024, ranking them by total market capitalization. Neurogene’s membership in the U.S. all-cap Russell 3000® Index will remain in place for one year. Neurogene has also been added to the Russell 2000® Index and the Russell Microcap® Index.\n\n“We are proud of all that we have accomplished, including in the first six months as a publicly traded company, that has enabled Neurogene’s addition to these industry benchmarking indexes for the investment community,” said Rachel McMinn, Ph.D., Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Neurogene. “We are focused on execution in our clinical programs, and we remain on track to share interim clinical efficacy data from the low-dose cohort of our NGN-401 gene therapy trial for Rett syndrome in the fourth quarter of this year. This next milestone follows important recent progress in the NGN-401 program, including selection for the FDA’s START Pilot Program to accelerate clinical development and a favorable safety update at the recent IRSF ASCEND Scientific Meeting.”\n\nRussell indexes are widely used by investment managers and institutional investors for index funds and as benchmarks for active investment strategies. According to the data as of the end of December 2023, about $10.5 trillion in assets are benchmarked against the Russell U.S. indexes, which belong to FTSE Russell, a prominent global index provider.\n\nAbout Neurogene\n\nThe mission of Neurogene is to treat devastating neurological diseases to improve the lives of patients and families impacted by these rare diseases. Neurogene is developing novel approaches and treatments to address the limitations of conventional gene therapy in central nervous system disorders. This includes selecting a delivery approach to maximize distribution to target tissues and designing products to maximize potency and purity for an optimized efficacy and safety profile. The Company’s novel and proprietary EXACT transgene regulation platform technology allows for the delivery of therapeutic levels while limiting transgene toxicity associated with conventional gene therapy. Neurogene has constructed a state-of-the-art gene therapy manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. CGMP production of NGN-401 was conducted in this facility and is expected to support pivotal clinical development activities.
