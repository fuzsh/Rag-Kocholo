        "text": "*Keep Shining and Smiling, Manju Didi!* Our oldest Daayitwa Abhiyaan team member, our dear Manju didi! As a big happy family, we recently celebrated her decade of service to our shared impact journey. This year, for the first time, she took my leadership course and shared her heartwarming leadership story - “At Daayitwa, everyone loves and respects me. I’ve a precious opportunity to understand and strengthen my identity. I am really happy, that’s why I am here.” Our journey at Daayitwa Abhiyaan is not easy. We draw our powers from our passion for nation-building and our love for each other. Manju didi’s bright smile, warm love and scrumptious food has been vital in creating that uplifting environment. Many many thanks and congratulations, Manju didi. Keep shining and smiling! Daayitwa | Governance Lab | Nepal Leadership Academy | Nepal Rising (Daayitwa US) Susit Dhakal | Nisha Onta | Arati Maleku, MSW, Ph.D.\n\n*Wanted: Innovative Nation-Builders to Lead Daayitwa Abhiyaan* In 2008, we began as an informal “Nepal Ko Yuwa'' volunteer group and in 2013, ventured into a formal entity Daayitwa. After 15 years of persistent creativity and hard work, our efforts have culminated into a pivotal juncture. We're setting out into a new chapter of transforming our early innovations into a global campaign for an enterprising Nepal. Two integral components of the Daayitwa Abhiyaan - Governance Lab for evidence-based policy-making and Nepal Leadership Academy for leadership development - have been serving the nation in myriad ways. In catapulting these organizations into newer heights of impact, we're looking for two enterprising leaders who embody values of innovation, collaboration and service and have an incessant calling for nation-building. Please apply at the links below and share the opportunities widely. Bolstering our identity is our responsibility. The journey is not easy, but transformative and gratifying. Let’s do it together. We can, we will!

Despite passionate and persistent efforts, partners stumble, family worries and results falter; the path becomes unsettlingly lonely. Amidst this deep darkness, a sudden ray of hope shines on you. Not a national medal or international acclaim. More joyfully, an award from the Universe, a gift blessed with love, trust, respect and gratefulness of Daayitwa rural women entrepreneurs. You smile with boundless joy and gratitude. Sometimes, a common moment can have an uncommon impact in your life. Such is the path of public service - gripping, grueling and gratifying! Susit Dhakal | Nisha Onta | Arati Maleku, MSW, Ph.D. #Service #Daayitwa #Women #Entrepreneurship\n\n*Breeding Young Innovators to Lead the Nation* The people, institutions and culture that are shaped in academic institutions shape the foundation of a nation. My heart-to-heart with Dr. Arjun Karki and Dr. Surya Raj Acharya about innovation, leadership and development was inspiring and learningful. By mobilizing the shared values, learning and network of Daayitwa Abhiyaan and University of Nepal, we can create an immense and important impact in Nepal. Lots to do together for the nation, we will! Susit Dhakal | Nisha Onta | Arati Maleku, MSW, Ph.D. #YouthLeadership #NationBuilding #UniversityOfNepal #Daayitwa\n\n*Enterprising Partnership Journey of Ministry of Industry and Daayitwa* A decade ago, I embraced two principles. First, youth, the primary victims of the critical unemployment problem, must create the solutions to ensure empathetic change. Second, youth and government must partner in implementing those solutions to ensure sustainable impact. In 2014, driven by these principles, the Ministry of Industry and Daayitwa signed a MOU. We began two programs on rural enterprise acceleration and evidence-based policy research. A decade later, last month, we just renewed our institutional vows through a new MoU. Together, our shared journey has come quite far. Through the Rural Enterprise Acceleration Program, we’ve enabled 105 rural enterprises to access finance and markets and scale up their innovations, thus growing income and employment in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces. Likewise, through the Nepal Public Service Fellowship Program, we’ve enabled 182 youth to conduct policy research in partnership with government institutions, thus promoting governance innovations in federal and all 7 provincial governments as well as 42 municipalities. Grateful to respected Former Secretary Krishna Gyawali for your support and guidance from its birth of this journey. Many thanks to Industry Secretary Krishna Bahadur Raut, Joint Secretary Jiblal Bhusal and the ministry family for your trust in our commitment and capability. Indebted to Tara Panthi and Busan P K D Prasain for laying the critical foundation of the two programs. Now, we must spread the learnings. We want to engage other partners to scale up collective impact towards creating an enterprising Nepal. The road is long and laborious. Together, we can and will! Susit Dhakal | Nisha Onta #Industry #Ministry #Daayitwa #Abhiyaan #EnterprisingNepal #Transformation\n\n*Nepal’s Hope Lives in Its Diaspora's Engagement in Nation Building* “जसो गर, जे भन, जता सुकै लैजाऊ मलाई, यो मन त मेरो नेपाली हो ।” This heart-touching line of the 1974 AD rock band rhymes with my 17-year learningful US journey. Advancing work and family in an unfamiliar land is not easy. Regardless, most Nepali migrants yearn to give back to their motherland, an integral source of their identities. Diasporic organizations, however, mostly engage in social activities. Substantive initiatives that support diaspora in professional growth and giving back to their roots are scarce. Grateful and elated that The Great Nepali Diaspora and Daayitwa Abhiyaan, driven by the conviction to bridge this key gap, have signed a MoU. By connecting TGND’s global knowledge and network with Daayitwa’s nationwide innovations, we will accelerate Nepal’s transformation and bolster our Nepali identity. Many congrats and best wishes to Preeti Adhikary, Susit Dhakal and your teams for all that you do so relentlessly despite the myriad challenges. Today, Nepal faces a dire development imbroglio. The economic situation is worsening. The youth talentpool is migrating. Urgently deploying the network and networth of Nepali diaspora in nation-building is vital. Daayitwa Abhiyaan is keen to partner with all interested individuals and institutions. The road is long and laborious. Together we can and will! #Nepali #Diaspora #Community #TGND #Daayitwa #NationBuilding\n\n*Grateful for Four Decades of Joyful Friendship* My childhood friend Utpal and I. We’ve known each other since our kindergarten days. Later, we even worked together at The World Bank DC office. Today, we live in different parts of the world but we’ve been teaming up to build leadership capability of change-agents at grassroots and government levels in Nepal through creative interventions of Nepal Leadership Academy at the Daayitwa Abhiyaan. Our long overdue family catch-up with our other halves last week was joyful. As we traverse the topsy-turvies of our lives, the moments when we reconnect with our old buddies and get to truly open our hearts, unpack our untold stories and gather support for the tough journey ahead are always precious. Grateful for and elated about our shared journey! Utpal Misra | Prakriti Mudvari, PhD | Prativa Pandey | Pukar Malla\n\n*Politics-Free Education Sector is a Must for Nation Building* Maintaining the integrity and esteem of our sacred knowledge institutions that build a thriving future of Nepal is critical today. Politicization of academic organizations including public universities is unacceptable. Our discussion, driven by this conviction, with the Education Minister Hon Sumana Shrestha was hopeful and productive. The earlier day, we also lobbied with the Right Hon. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Led by Kedar Bhakta Mathema, a group of societal advocates is pressurizing political parties to make a public commitment for political non-interference in the education sector. The journey is critical, the road is difficult, we'll persist, let’s do it together! Prativa Pandey BHOJRAJ POKHAREL Bhagawan Koirala Bishnu Upreti Meena Acharya Pratyoush Onta #Campaign #Education #System #Daayitwa\n\n*Hope Lives in the Grit of Rural Women Entrepreneurs* Throughout this past decade of the difficult and meaningful journey of Daayitwa Abhiyaan, I have found immense inspiration in the courageous stories of rural women entrepreneurs. Grateful that each year, I have a blessed opportunity of providing leadership coaching to them and be a small part of their powerful journeys. A rural woman entrepreneur’s growth journey is relentlessly challenging in myriad ways. One key reason is because she has to carry the mental and physical load of her many roles, laden with sky-high societal expectations. How to scale the mountain of challenges? How to bolster one's identity and transform society? How to lead enterprise innovations? Last week's leadership course for women entrepreneurs from Tilottama municipality was learningful and inspiring. Elated that these women leaders have grasped their technical and adaptive challenges better, crafted their leadership narratives and identified the next steps for enterprise growth. Many congratulations and thanks to all the women entrepreneurs and their families! Susit Dhakal Dilasha K.C Nisha Onta #Women #Enterprise #Growth #Innovation #Leadership"
