        "text": "July 12, 2024 - Weekly Message from Jim Carrington\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nFeedback is necessary, useful, and often illuminating. Feedback leads to self-reflection, which is a step on the way to improvement. I hope everyone takes advantage of the upcoming Engagement Survey Listening Sessions (starting July 15) to offer feedback about your experience at the Danforth Center. I’ve received or heard about a lot of feedback from individuals who recently visited the Center, mostly as candidates interviewing for new Assistant Member faculty positions. As their feedback is largely a reflection on the Danforth Center community, I think you’ll be interested in what they said.\n\n“This is the 8th Wonder of the World.” This direct quote was from a scientific collaborator at another institution. Our site, our facilities, and the way our facilities are maintained are noticed and admired by visitors. Our facilities are exceptional and often envied.\n\n“Wow, you seem really collaborative.” The five recent Assistant Member candidates all commented on this. They were particularly impressed by how nearly all projects are collaborations, and how scientific teams have evolved over time based on those collaborations. The candidates were encouraged to envision how their programs would impact other Danforth Center teams through collaboration.\n\n“The scientific culture seems really different here.” The recent candidates noticed a culture of sharing resources and sharing credit. They commented on how our mission, vision and values really shape what we do and how we talk about our work. They were impressed by a culture of getting things done, and how administrative and non-research community members contributed to and shared ownership in scientific success. They were surprised how efficiently the search was done and by everyone’s helpful attitude.\n\n“The trainees and CSTM members were really engaged.” Each candidate commented about how impressed they were with CSTM members’ participation in the search. They noticed a sophisticated understanding about both the needs as well as the opportunities for mentoring, and at least some of the candidates found this to be eye-opening.\n\n“I’m on board!” This was from one of the candidates, Nadia Shakoor, who accepted our offer of Assistant Member just this morning! We’re excited for Nadia and her team, and for the new opportunities for growth at the Danforth Center. I hope you join me in congratulating Nadia on her new position and for all that she’s done.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nNote: The Weekly Message will be on hiatus for a few weeks until I return from vacation. I’ll be out to pasture, think it’s safe to say, enjoying the Rocky Mountain way just south of Mt. Sneffels.\n\nPrevious Weekly Messages from Jim Carrington\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nI hope everyone had a chance to relax or enjoy festivities during the 4th of July holiday yesterday. Those who were concerned about outdoor events getting rained out may have spent some time watching televised sports, like the early rounds of Wimbledon tennis on ESPN. Had you stayed tuned after tennis, ESPN broadcasted the Annual Hot Dog Eating Contest from Coney Island, NY with a full complement of sports announcers and analysts. Now, I do not consider myself strongly anti-hot dog, especially with the grandson of the inventor of the Ballpark Frank being a Danforth Center community member. But I have a big problem with classifying the over-consumption of hot dogs, or any processed meat for that matter, as a sport. C’mon, man!\n\nHad you kept ESPN on in the background as you prepared to view night-time fireworks, you may have seen the Annual Diving Dogs competition, featuring some true canine athletes. I can only describe this as a hybrid of long jump and competitive fetch, but into a swimming pool. In the featured event and with a jump of 28 feet, a Whippet named Rogue edged out the favorite, Sounders, the one everybody came to see and the holder of eight Diving Dogs world records. I’ve never seen athletes enjoy competing as much as these dogs.\n\nHowever you spent the day off, you probably did yourself some good. Besides increasing productivity and overall life satisfaction, taking time off from work leads to both physical and mental health benefits, including lower rates of heart disease, reduced depression, lower stress levels, and better sleep. Time off work also gives you a chance to have fun, and fun is highly underrated!\n\nFinally, I want highlight those who deferred time off or worked unusual hours on or around the holiday. Many of you were needed for plant care, security, essential lab work, or unanticipated emergencies on July 4th. Others, like the team that handles payroll, rearranged schedules to ensure work was completed earlier than usual. I give sincere thanks to all those who kept the Danforth Center running through the holiday. They deserve our appreciation!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nWhen I came to the Danforth Center as President in early 2011, there was no thought about how long I’d be here. There were too many possibilities at hand, and so much to build and achieve together with the Danforth Center community, our partners and our supporters. But over 13 years later, the time has arrived to ask the question, “How long?” After much consideration, I’ve decided to step down as President and CEO of the Danforth Center after one more year, on July 1, 2025. This decision was made with the Danforth Center’s future, my family, and sexagenarian biology in mind, and with peace in feeling that it’s time.\n\nPlanning for succession and identifying the next leader, like everything at the Danforth Center, will be a collaborative effort. Penny Pennington (Chair, Board of Directors) will lead the search for a new President. Penny will appoint a search advisory committee, which will include representation from the Board as well as the Danforth Center community. She will start communication soon about the search process, the anticipated timeline, and how input from the Center community and stakeholders will be received.\n\nIn addition to my current roles, responsibilities and goals over the next year (I’m not done yet!), I’ll be working to ensure that opportunities for the next President, and for members of the Danforth Center community, are as abundant as they were for me when I started. That means much attention will be focused on resource development for both current priorities and future opportunities, and on those things that promote success for the next President and the Center community.\n\nI love the Danforth Center, our people and our shared purpose. I expect that I’ll always be a part of this unique and impactful institution. And I know the Center will benefit greatly from the necessary renewal of perspective, ideas, and talents that come with a new leader. In the meantime, I look forward to one more year of achievement with you in this position I’ve been so fortunate to hold.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nPat Brown - founder of Impossible Foods, Director on our Board, and recent answer to a clue on Jeopardy! - is one of the most influential biologists over the past 40 years. And with a goal to eliminate animal meat production on a global scale, he’s also one of the most influential food innovators over the past 15 years. Pat was invited recently to a Royal Society meeting on transformation of agriculture, at which he described himself as the designated provocateur! A few of us connected with Pat by Zoom this week to seek his input on a few matters and to give some Danforth Center updates. Here’s a little of what he had to say.\n\nWe can grow enough protein for human consumption in plants. Pat is a champion for reducing the environmental impact of agriculture through reducing/eliminating the use of animal meat in our diets. A few simple calculations indicate that we could provide more than enough protein directly from plant-based agriculture. Human consumption of protein from meat worldwide currently stands at about 90 million metric tonnes (mt), while protein produced by soybean cultivation alone amounts to nearly 170M mt. Of course, there would be enormous challenges - dietary, cultural, economic, and technical – to seeing that substitution happen. Concerning the technical challenges…\n\nWe need more protein innovation. Realizing Pat’s vision requires that we develop more nutritionally complete, digestible, accessible and safe plant-based protein sources. He sees a wide-open opportunity to apply science to produce at scale proteins that have complete amino acid compositions, better functional properties for food preparation, and greater production efficiency with fewer inputs. He ponders, might we be able to use vegetative plant parts (e.g. leaves), rather than primarily seeds, to produce next generations of plant-produced protein?\n\nNeed better understanding of everything underground. Pat is a big proponent of not only reducing animal agriculture, but also of diversifying our agricultural crops and gaining a better understanding of what’s happening below ground. Carbon capture, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and other benefits will be gained by placing far more attention on roots, soils, and subterranean environments. Pat, you’re speaking our language!\n\nIt's safe to say, not everyone agrees that Pat’s objective of eliminating animal agriculture is practical or right. But it’s hard to argue that he not driving innovation, behaviors, and markets that are providing measurable environmental benefits.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nLet’s start with a quiz. What’s one of the biggest differences between someone who gets a meaningful award and all of their worthy peers who did not? Answer: The award winner had a nominator!\n\nI want to make the strong case for each of us to recognize and celebrate our high-achieving peers, supervisors and direct reports with nominations for awards and honors. This requires someone, a nominator, to spend time and effort assembling a packet of information that describes why an individual has earned recognition. Investing valuable time to submit a nomination is a selfless act of commitment to, and appreciation of, a colleague. It is a high form of respect for what they’ve done. Preparing a nomination means you care enough to advocate formally for a colleague who did well. And when you’re on the receiving end, awards can be powerful affirmation that you’ve made an impact through achievement.\n\nAwards and honors come in all shapes and sizes. There are scientific society awards that recognize a variety of research, scholarly, educational and other contributions. There are awards for individuals in all professional disciplines, like finance or human resources. At the Danforth Center, we give awards to high-achieving graduate students and individuals who have made major contributions to plant science research and service, and we are looking at ways to recognize outstanding members across the Danforth Center with new annual awards. Nominators are the keys that unlock awards for our deserving colleagues.\n\nMany of you are active nominators, and in so doing you are making a major contribution to the Danforth Center community. Thank you! But I ask that everyone spend a few moments and ask, “Which of my Danforth Center colleagues are deserving of special recognition?” Whether it’s a major ASPB award for career-long achievement or recognition as CSTM Member of the Month, being recognized matters. And if you don’t do the work to nominate a coworker, then who will?\n\nCongratulations to all of our recent award winners, like Karla Roeber, who is being recognized this week as Outstanding Member of the Year by the St. Louis Agribusiness Club. Well done, Karla, and many thanks to your nominator!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nOne of the organizers said the best thing about the annual Danforth Center Scientific Retreat is the way scientists and teams come together and learn what everyone is doing. The 2024 Retreat this week welcomed over 200 participants, including Penny Pennington (Board Chair) and Silvia Restrepo, President of our peer institution, Boyce Thompson Institute. I’ve been impressed by the quality of every short and long presentation, and the progress shown by each speaker and team. Here, I want to highlight a few presenters who also made their work especially accessible to a broad audience.\n\nKeely Brown talked about developing rapid, predictive breeding methods applicable to perennial crop improvement. Perennial crops present unique challenges, like the multi-year nature of cultivation and long life cycles. Keely is using data science, genomics and phenotyping approaches to more quickly breed perennial crops with high yields and environmental benefits (e.g. high carbon sequestration) in different geographies.\n\nDhiraj Srivastava is working collaboratively within the Phenotyping core to devise better ways to capture and analyze data from field experiments. He is using drone-based sensors and methods, for example, to measure height of both short and tall varieties of tef over time. He’s extending the PlantCV platform to include important geospatial capabilities. Dhiraj is a great example of a scientist who organizes presentations around a key principle: Make it understandable to a broad audience!\n\nKris Callis-Duehl gave an overview of the Education Research and Outreach Laboratory (EROL), which seeks to combine science and education to achieve STEM+Ag objectives for students and teachers, workforce development, understanding of how students learn, and more. EROL is a unique program that has impact on economic development, especially in underserved communities in our region, as Precious Hardy elaborated on very nicely in her short talk. The EROL team also works closely with many Danforth Center lab teams for broader impacts through outreach, and for data science skills training as Parag Bhatt described well in tie-dyed color.\n\nI also noticed that Dan Lin, Dominique Pham, Stewart Morley, and Cody Bagnall included notable features in their presentations to make their complicated topics understandable or even entertaining. Learning what our Danforth Center colleagues are doing promotes unity within the community and a strong scientific culture. The time and effort each presenter invested to bring their work to life for all is sincerely appreciated!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nChange is a constant at the Danforth Center. It describes our scientific research programs, our people and our facilities. Change is necessary to grow, important for competitiveness, and essential to maintain relevance and impact. Let’s highlight a few changes and celebrate those working hard to make them happen.\n\nSummer REU Program. The Center changes at the end of May each year with the arrival of 20 or so interns in the Research Experiences for Undergraduate program. The summer program has changed much over time, including this year with a younger cohort in which most have just finished just their first or second college years. They will be engaging in a new outreach activity at Oak Bend Branch of St. Louis County Library, where they’ll help 7-14-year olds learn to extract strawberry DNA. I met with the REU students this week and was exceptionally impressed. I sincerely thank them for investing their summer with us.\n\nNew Faculty Hiring. Prospects for significant changes within the faculty ranks improved dramatically with a new funding plan to hire for six positions over the next several years. We’re off to a fast start! Over the next six working days, we will host six candidates interviewing for two Member-track positions. New faculty hiring means new teams, changes in our capabilities and capacity, and renewed energy to power unique collaborations. I thank everyone with a hand in organizing the searches, reviewing applications, meeting with candidates, and otherwise participating to show off the best of the Danforth Center.\n\nNew working spaces. Everyone can see the new office and meeting facility under construction next to the greenhouse complex. But there are out-of-view changes underway to create new spaces for Grant Specialists and (soon) the Finance team. The Facilities team is simply the best I’ve seen at addressing the ever-changing needs of an organization like ours. Chris Martin, for example, is now renovating one of the 3rd-level office suites to grow capacity. Come to think of it, Chris always seems to be working hard on a building project, repairing something, or changing a space to accommodate different users. Chris and the rest of the Facilities team deserve our sincere appreciation for constantly improving and evolving our facilities.\n\nOh, I almost forgot one more change…Karaoke is coming back to the Scientific Retreat next week. But this time, all Danforth Center community members, not just retreat participants, are invited! I look forward to hearing your collaborative efforts at the microphone.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nLet’s build this week’s message around two colorful images that I’m excited to share. Both represent important teams or features that we value at the Danforth Center, and that make us unique.\n\nGrant Specialists, Administrative Assistants, and our scientific network. Each year we build a network diagram, thanks to Noah Fahlgren, Melissa Kerckhoff, and Karla Elliott, showing how our scientific teams connect through funded research projects. It’s a representation that dramatically underscores our value of Collaboration within the Center’s scientific enterprise. Not surprisingly, Grant Specialists and Administrative Assistants have some of the most connectivity within the network. Collectively, these two groups facilitate accurate grant proposal preparation and on-time submission. In 2023, their work resulted in 82 submissions and $23M in new grant awards. They help build and manage budgets, and bridge between collaborating teams. They help plan, organize, and run seminar programs, retreats, internship and education programs, and so much more. And they each work across multiple scientific or core facility teams, and frequently with the pressure of tight deadlines. They are critical hubs that hold the network together! With admiration for the vital work they do, I thank the Grants team of Michelle Richards, Missy Rung-Blue, Alex Durdello, Denise Cunningham, Elizabeth Martinez, and Marti Meersman; and the Administrative team of Terri Burton, Monica Alsup, Shannon Gabbert, Kerri Peer, Judy Mitchell and Jenny Kezele.\n\nNew art is coming! Last year, I communicated about feedback from the Danforth Center community concerning the artwork displayed on the 2nd level. That feedback led to formation of a committee, composed of Kerri Gilbert, Sarah Jennings and Anna Dibble to develop ideas for new art that would better reflect our community and purpose. After much investigation, consultation, and consideration, I’m happy to announce that we will install two colorful “moss walls,” composed of preserved mosses and other plant materials, in place of the current four paintings. The Danforth Center prairie was the inspiration for the design. Look for the installation to begin within the next few months. Many thanks to Kerri, Sarah and Anna for your creativity, time and effort.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nI spent part of yesterday with a group discussing the following difficult questions: What can we do to better educate and inform “the public” about science and evidence-based decision making, and what can we do about rising anti-science influences in the U.S.? It was helpful that Dr. Sudip Parikh [CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)], and Lauren Seligman (AAAS Senior Director) were part of the conversation. With a mission to “advance science, engineering, and innovation throughout the world for the benefit of all,” AAAS is one of the most important organizations supporting, promoting and advocating for science and research.\n\nThe reasons people adhere to beliefs that have apparent anti-science foundations are often not because they are generally anti-science. Among other reasons, social, political or other group affiliation and acceptance, and the information that groups share among members, has been shown to effectively drive and reinforce beliefs independent of consideration of evidence for and against the beliefs. But the same person who argues, for example, against evidence that people set foot on the moon may be a staunch defender of the science and scientists behind a modern anti-cancer treatment that saved their life. The difference is this: the life-saving medication mattered in a most personal, compelling way; belief that the moon landings were a hoax is an option with no apparent or tangible consequences.\n\nThe AAAS under Dr. Parikh’s leadership is taking a strategic approach to infuse better understanding of, and comfort with, science and evidence-based decision making within society. In addition to all of the work with scientists, scientific organizations, and educators, AAAS works closely with specific, influential groups to provide targeted education, resources and support. These groups include legislators and elected officials, federal judges, and religious leaders. Working with the latter starts with acknowledging that both faith-based beliefs and science in our lives can and must productively coexist. And the AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellowship program embeds 250 talented scientists and engineers across all three branches of the federal government, infusing scientific and evidence-based perspectives in offices and agencies that need them. The AAAS approach is based on non-partisanship, relationship-building and understanding of the challenges we all face.\n\nI thank Dr. Parikh and Lauren for the great work they’re doing with AAAS for the benefit of all, regardless of ideology, group affiliation, or political identity. I’ve been a card-carrying member of AAAS for most of my life, and now you know some big reasons why.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nWhen we reported productivity metrics to the Board of Directors last week, I was thrilled to comment on the 40 graduate students who did dissertation research at the Danforth Center in 2023. These students are highly valued contributors, collaborators and colleagues, and we would be a far less interesting, dynamic and fun place without them. Yesterday, I had the opportunity to spend time with four Washington University (WU) Ph.D. students, including Paty Gallardo (Bart team) and Sarah Pardi (Nusinow team) here at the Center, several WU faculty, and Vi Skukla (Senior Program Officer, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.)\n\nMuch of the far-ranging conversation dealt with how scientific research and the lab environment has changed for graduate students over the years, including during the pandemic. We talked about how the pandemic affected both the preparation for graduate school and life as a student, and what might be the long-term consequences of those difficult years. Paty felt that she learned much less as an undergraduate student during the pandemic and entered WU with too little preparation compared to her peers. (Editorial note: Paty is one of the best prepared graduate students we’ve ever seen!). As a graduate student beginning her research when the pandemic hit, Sarah had to manage all of the rigorous program requirements in addition to science at the bench. Sarah and Paty have excelled despite the headwinds.\n\nWe also talked about how remote learning, absence of in-person scientific meetings and overall less direct human interaction during pandemic years might affect career development beyond graduate school. Will students who traversed the last four years be able to build robust professional networks, which are vital to navigate all parts of the scientific research world? I have serious concerns about losses and setbacks of talented individuals from research career paths over the last several years. But if you’re looking for examples of resilient scientists who inspire confidence about future research leaders, spend a little time with Paty and Sarah.\n\nNow, while I was writing this message, Sarah Pardi participated in graduation ceremonies to recognize the award of a Ph.D. Congratulations, Dr. Pardi! It’s a world-class understatement to say you earned it.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nIn late 2022, I updated the Danforth Center community on progress towards sustainability initiatives in our facilities, highlighting energy conservation measures, use of renewable energy, and progress toward our goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. I also highlighted a few areas in which we needed to ramp up our efforts, like reduction of single-use disposable plastic. Since then, we obtained a sustainability audit by an independent firm, which helped with both short and long term planning. Let’s discuss recent progress and upcoming actions that will move us forward on three fronts.\n\nReduction of lab plastic waste. We recently installed a Grenova TipNovus Tipwasher in the lower-level media kitchen for cleaning and reuse of plastic pipette tips. The system can complete a wash and dry cycle for four boxes of commonly used, non-filter pipette tips in 25-30 minutes. Although there are limitations with certain tip sizes, all labs are strongly encouraged to explore and use the system to reduce a significant source of plastic waste. I am grateful to Becca Bindbeutel, who will train lab members on use of the tipwasher. Becca is also exploring ways to reduce or eliminate non-recyclable, disposable lab gloves.\n\nReduction of café plastic waste. The café, which is now part of the Green Dining Alliance, has completed the transition to compostable or recyclable materials for all take-out packaging, containers, bowls and utensils. The recycle and compost bins by the café are now larger and easier to use, and will soon have improved signage to guide use. Many thanks to the café team!\n\nSolar energy at the Danforth Center. Say goodbye to the tents, and say hello to a new solar power-generating pavilion that will be constructed later this year on the Miller Terrace! The solar panel-covered structure will yield an amount of electricity to offset twice that needed for the new Plant Growth Facility office building under construction, and reduce 78-109 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually from fossil fuel-powered electricity generation. Also, through Ameren’s Renewable Solutions Program and the purchase of Renewable Energy Credits, we are helping bring online and use a new solar facility in the region. We anticipate spending up to $50,000/year on this program, and meeting our greenhouse gas reduction goals by the end of 2025.\n\nShrinking our environmental footprint is a continuous process, and I thank everyone for doing their part.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nThe first thing Penny Pennington, the fourth Chair of our Board of Directors, brought up in a meeting with 35 or so Danforth Center community members earlier this week was the birth of her first grandchild, Quinn, just a few days earlier. The rest of her conversation with the group, including why Penny chooses to work with us in addition to her day job as Managing Partner (CEO) of Edward Jones, was also inspiring. In Penny’s own words, I want to share portions of that message with the entire community.\n\n“My ‘why’ is all about helping more people thrive…I want to invest in organizations and in people who are making a difference in the world outside of Edward Jones. I just want to be part of what you do. I want to help facilitate, I want to help enable you and the Danforth Center to do what you do. When I became Managing Partner in 2019, the first off-site that I did with my senior leadership team was here…I wanted us to have an experience of being in the environment that you create. And it's an environment of great ambition. It's an environment of having a North Star that really matters.”\n\nIt's an environment of innovation, of collaboration, of looking long-term and saying, ‘what can we do to make a difference in the world using the skills and the tools and the expertise that we have?’ So that's my ‘why’ for Danforth Center (engagement) and my thanks to you for what you do. I want to be the best version of a Board Chair that I can be. I want to learn from you…I'd really like to spend some time with you.\n\nI've now got the fourth generation of my family alive. And I tell you what, there's nothing like having another generation to say, my gosh, what is happening in the world and what can we do to make a difference that really matters for people. It's never mattered more to me than it did as of a week ago when Quinn was born.”\n\nPenny’s devotion of time and effort here is an investment in each Danforth Center community member. If you see her in the hallway, please introduce yourself, ask how Quinn is doing, and let her know what you do. I’m certain she will appreciate learning how her investment is growing.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nIf you’re a fan of those who know what they need, and then roll up their sleeves and get to work, you will be impressed with the Committee for Scientific Mentoring and Training (CSTM) at the Danforth Center. As a voluntary assembly of postdoctoral trainees, graduate students, research associates, technicians and other non-faculty scientific professionals, CSTM members seek to acquire new skills, enhance their careers, build community and make life better at the Center. The group is led this year by co-chairs Vanessica Jawahir, Melette DeVore, Myia Elliott and Dhiraj Srivastava, with some notable big lifts by Seth Edwards and Lily O’Conner, and they have a significant agenda. Besides the annual BioBash and PlantTech Jam events, here are just a few of their priorities for 2024.\n\nScience communication skills. CSTM recognizes the high value of being able to engage scientific and non-scientific audiences better, so a workshop focusing on public communication is being planned. They want to learn the skills of those who connect with and inspire broad audiences so well. I applaud this and plan to participate by sharing a thought or two.\n\nMore social events. Wait, is this just about having fun? Well, CSTM members understand that fun is highly underrated! They also understand that a work environment in which you know, appreciate and enjoy spending time with your colleagues is a more productive and satisfying workplace. Social events like monthly happy hours and casual gatherings are also golden opportunities to stir up new ways of thinking about research. As Vanessica told me, “We come up with more innovative projects when we interact with people who have diverse ideas.” It’s the “interact” part that is critical, and it’s vital for the culture we desire.\n\nRecognition of CSTM members. The team is creating more opportunities to recognize and celebrate their peers. Did you see that Somnath Koley, Research Scientist, was the March 2024 CSTM Member of the Month? This kind of recognition is important not only to call out those making significant scientific contributions at the Center, but also to learn more about our diverse community. The co-chairs highly encourage new nominations! Also, Travel Awards recognize and help those CSTM members who are gaining professional exposure at scientific conferences.\n\nThe secret sauce of CSTM is high motivation and willingness to explore new routes to career growth, to build a supportive culture, and to work hard. I’m a big fan of CSTM!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nWe recently held a one-day Faculty Retreat at the Forest Park visitor center. I always look forward to this annual event. It’s an investment of time and effort to concentrate on issues that directly or indirectly affect every team at the Danforth Center. It is particularly useful to gauge opinions and gain input on potential investments, resource allocation, new opportunities and issues of concern. So, what did we cover?\n\nSpace Allocation. We reviewed and discussed the near-final draft of a new space allocation policy, which will be available soon on Workvivo. As communicated in the January 19, 2024 message, space allocation is challenging because space is a limited resource. We discussed the key factors when assigning space – What are the needs, what is available, and what is reasonable within the broader context (e.g., competing needs or future plans). We also discussed the goal of achieving fairness, in part through transparency.\n\nNew Faculty Hiring. Encouraging progress was reported on searches for a new Assistant Member and a mid-career Mizzou-Danforth Center joint faculty member. I am optimistic we’ll have two new research team leaders later this year.\n\nSources of Funding and Funding Needs. Sources of Danforth Center funding for projects, equipment, graduate students, and other research needs were reviewed, followed by a poll and lively discussion of pressing needs for flexible research funding. I have committed to work with Becky Bart (Interim VP for Research), and Hal Davies and Djuan Coleman (Finance), to review options and identify funding sources to address some of these needs within 2024.\n\nField Phenotyping Opportunities. A significant grant was awarded to both refurbish the Bellwether Phenotyping facility and develop new phenotyping capabilities at the Danforth Center Field Research Site. We have the opportunity to build or adapt technologies to elevate our programs. The discussion and workshopping focused on possible forms and functions of new technologies or facilities that would meet the needs of the most Danforth Center teams. The wisdom of the retreat crowd will be incorporated into plans under development now.\n\nDeveloping Leaders. We reviewed and discussed the range of leadership training opportunities at the Center, and heard from several recent participants in the Developing Scientific Leaders program. I am sincerely thankful to all who using these opportunities to become better team leaders.\n\nI also appreciate everyone’s contributions to an interesting and productive Faculty Retreat!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\n“Simplicity doesn’t need to be greased.” – Billy Joe Shaver\n\nI would bet that most of you have never heard of Billy Joe Shaver. He was a highly respected songwriter and a founding force of the outlaw country music movement in the early 1970s. He wrote dozens of notable songs for Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and many others. Though he was hardly a role model in life, he provided this absolute pearl of wisdom. Though his statement about simplicity dealt with the songs he wrote, I believe it can be applied by anyone wanting to achieve anything important. Here’s why.\n\nSimplicity helps focus on the most important goals. Simplicity is not about aiming lower, but rather, helping to focus on the most important work to achieve goals. I remember serving on a review board for a scientific institute in Europe. After questioning one of the PIs about their very long, complicated report, their response was a semi-serious, “Yes, my team is tightly focused on 16 different projects.” How many of those projects were distracting? Were the most promising projects under-resourced? Were team members receiving the attention they needed?\n\nSimplicity is more efficient. In terms of achieving a big goal, I always advise to concentrate really hard on the next step, as opposed to over-worrying about the next six steps. That does not mean ignoring or abandoning a plan, but rather, keeping attention focused on achieving meaningful progress. There is no substitute for progress! Distraction due to over-complication is exhausting, expensive, progress-inhibiting and demoralizing. Teams that are able to simplify steps move faster, and are able to anticipate, understand and respond to problems more efficiently.\n\nSimplicity is easier to understand. This is a big one. How many scientific seminars or technical training sessions have you attended where the speaker used excessive acronyms, complicated and specialized language, or an overbearing Powerpoint presentation? Even those who are specialists in the particular field are often confused due to the complexity and coded language. Simplifying a message is a gift to everyone listening to you talk or reading your report. Those who are unfamiliar with the topic have the possibility to learn something important or be inspired, and the specialists in the field will appreciate it because it’s refreshingly different!\n\nMight you or your team benefit by adopting more simplicity? I’d love to hear your thoughts.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nYou would never confuse Phil Needleman for a card-carrying plant scientist. Rather, Phil was a rigorous biochemist and pharmacologist who made life-changing discoveries that impacted millions of people. Phil discovered key parts of biochemical pathways that influence blood pressure, blood clotting and inflammation. He led teams that studied the enzyme COX-2 and COX-2 inhibitors, leading directly to the anti-inflammatory drug, Celebrex, for the treatment of chronic pain associated with arthritis and other conditions. He was highly recognized, awarded and admired for his vast contributions to science and medicine.\n\nDespite his lack of plant science bona fides, Phil made tremendous contributions to the Danforth Center. In 2005, he was cajoled by his friend Bill Danforth to join our board of directors, where he remained for nearly 19 years. He was the Center’s interim president for over a year, providing both leadership and stability prior to hiring of new guy in 2011. From my perspective, Phil made his most important contributions in three ways. First, he was a scientist’s scientist. He cared deeply about the importance of a scientific question, the quality of an experiment, and the clarity of results. Phil believed in data. He wanted to see it, and he wanted to talk about it…a lot! He once had a sign on his door that read, “If you have data, knock then enter. All else requires an appointment.”\n\nSecond, Phil constantly encouraged, demanded really, that we apply what we learn to solve big problems in the world, and he supported us in doing so. In part because he was inspired by many of you, Phil became interested in the Nitrogen Problem in agriculture – there’s too much greenhouse gas emission and other environmental impact due to current reliance on synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. He wanted to learn what we were doing about it, but he was even more interested to work with a team to organize new approaches. This was how the Subterranean Influences on Nitrogen and Carbon (SINC) center was conceptualized, and then launched through generous donations from Phil and his wife, Sima.\n\nAnd third, Phil provided wisdom, mentoring and personal support to so many of us at the Center and on the board. At this point, I have a confession to make. On a few occasions, I plotted covertly with Phil ahead of a board of directors meeting. Before proposing and seeking approval for new ways in which to create start-up companies, for example, we had this exchange. “Phil, I know you support this, but I need you to help make the case in the meeting,” I said. “Don’t worry,\" Phil replied with his usual wide grin. \"I’ll be ready with fist-pounding support when the time comes.\" Phil relished opportunities to help me and countless others.\n\nPhil Needleman’s life ended abruptly this week. But his legacy, example and will to make the world better through science lives on.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nSeveral of us hosted a visit today from the Honorable Francis Gatare, cabinet-level head of the Rwanda Development Board. As leader of the agency that oversees the national economy of Rwanda, Francis Gatare has a mandate to accelerate and enable Rwanda’s economic development through private sector growth. You might be surprised to learn that Rwanda is the most densely populated country in Africa. Ninety percent of employment comes from the food and agricultural sector, which accounts for 35% of Rwanda’s gross domestic product.\n\nFrom his position leading Rwanda’s economic growth, Francis Gatare’s top priority for agricultural economic development is increasing productivity of crops. And that’s where the Danforth Center is playing a role. In 2019, colleagues at the Rwanda Agricultural and Animal Resources Development Board (RAB, the national agricultural research organization) joined Virus Resistant Cassava for Africa (VIRCA), the Nigel Taylor-led effort funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and USAID to address the major virus diseases of cassava in East Africa. Given that earnings from cassava exports declined by 40% due to Cassava brown streak virus between 2016 and 2017 in Rwanda, there’s a great need for resistant varieties. The VIRCA goals in Rwanda include testing performance of recently developed varieties in field trials, training scientists, obtaining approvals, registering improved varieties, delivering seed to smallholder farmers, and training entrepreneurs.\n\n“Wait, what’s with training entrepreneurs,” you ask? One of the biggest challenges to delivering virus-resistant cassava in target geographies, like Rwanda, is the lack of effective, sustainable seed distribution systems. There are no companies to scale-up planting materials, steward varieties, and sell improved cassava seed to farmers. To reach 90% of the 700,000 cassava farmers in Rwanda, the VIRCA team aims to help develop and train 250 Cassava Seed Entrepreneurs (CSEs) who would multiply, quality-assure, and sell cassava seed to farmers. The CSEs will build private businesses that serve an unmet need and provide a source of income. In partnership with Rwandan entrepreneurs, developing private-sector cassava seed systems that are economically sustainable is now one of the top objectives of VIRCA.\n\nI was thrilled to meet Francis Gatare and discuss the opportunities to both increase agricultural productivity and build economic strength in Rwanda through a partnership about which we should all be proud.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nToday, I’m honored to celebrate International Women’s Day and recognize the remarkable community of women at the Danforth Center. This year’s theme is Inspire Inclusion, which emphasizes the importance of diversity and empowerment of women in all aspects of society. Inspire Inclusion is about encouraging everyone to recognize the unique perspectives and contributions of women from all walks of life, including those from marginalized communities.\n\nI’m inspired every day by women at the Center and the unique contributions they make. Within the teams in which I work and collaborate, I appreciate Allison Brown’s and Diane Moleski’s commitment to our community through their organizational skills. I am thankful for Kira Veley’s determination and Kerri Gilbert’s creativity. I admire Myia Elliott’s desire to grow professionally and help others. And I celebrate collaborator Becky Bart’s inventiveness and abilities to reach lofty goals. Across the Center, I know each of you are similarly inspired by women on your team or those you work with regularly.\n\nIn addition to International Women’s Day, March 8 this year is also Grant Professionals Day. Talented contributions from proposal preparers, managers, and grants finance team members, nearly all of whom are women, are absolutely essential for our work and our success. The Grant Specialist team members – Kelly Brinton, Alex Durdello, Denise Cunningham, Elizabeth Martinez, Marti Meersman, Missy Rung-Blue and Michelle Richards (Grant Support Manager) – are sincerely appreciated for their professionalism, responsiveness, tenacity, and endurance. I have comparable admiration for Finance team members - Cathy Kromer, Melissa Kerckhoff, Jackie Gonzalez, Heather Bowen, Darine Kube and Julia Ruvinov - who have key roles in proposal submission, grant fund management and compliance. I also point with high praise toward Development team members – Lee’at Bachar, Sarah Jennings, Matt Wichmer, and Debbie Davis – who collaboratively organize, write and manage philanthropic proposals and subsequent gift funds.\n\nI hope everyone takes some time to honor and appreciate the inspiring women at the Danforth Center, as well as the committed community members who make grant proposals and grant funding possible. Today reminds me just how fortunate we are!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nOne reason I periodically highlight a few research articles published by Danforth Center scientists is because it helps me dive deeper into what our teams are discovering and thinking about. Here are a few such articles that I enjoyed reading this week.\n\nMurphy, K.M., Ludwig, E., Gutierrez, J., Gehan, M.A. (2024). Deep learning in image-based phenotyping. Annu. Rev. of Plant Biol. doi: 10.1146/annurev-arplant-070523-042828.\n\nThis expansive review focuses on deep learning, a form of artificial intelligence using deep neural networks, to extract meaning from the fast amount of image data collected through phenotyping research. Teams here and elsewhere face unprecedented bottlenecks when analyzing massive datasets, and AI-based approaches are the only practical options to gain insights at scale. Katie and co-authors provide a great review of the progress, promise and challenges with deep learning for plant scientists.\n\nLi, M., Liu, Z., Jiang, N., Laws, B., Tiskevich, C., Moose, S.P., Topp, C.N. (2024). Topological data analysis expands the genotype to phenotype map for 3D maize root system architecture. Frontiers Plant Sci. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2023.1260005.\n\nSpeaking of phenotyping, Mao Li and colleagues analyzed the genetic underpinnings of phenotypic variation of three-dimensional root characteristics between maize lines that differ in their nitrogen uptake and assimilation properties. This team is pushing the boundaries for how to use image-based phenotyping, mathematics and statistics to learn how plant roots take their shape. They demonstrate that the genetic basis for root architecture, and also the ways to describe and quantify root architecture, and far more complex than we currently understand.\n\nSankoh, A.F., Adjei, J., Roberts, D., Burch-Smith, T.M. (2024). Comparing methods for detection and quantification of plasmodesmal callose in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Molec. Plant Microbe Interact. doi: 10.1094/MPMI-09-23-0152-SC.\n\nAmie Sankoh and the Burch-Smith team are pioneers in discovering how plants transmit information, important molecules and invasive viruses between cells. For example, they are leading the way in showing how plasmodesmata (PD) – channels that connect adjacent cells in leaves and other organs – are controlled by deposition of callose (a carbohydrate polymer) when plants are responding to infection. This article compares different methods to rigorously quantify callose accumulation around the microscopic PD channels, and paves the way for deeper understanding of how the plant immune system works.\n\nCongratulations to each co-author on these published studies. Well done!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nLet’s start with a statement about a primary function of the Danforth Center: We are in the business of creating new knowledge. We’re a research organization built firmly around the idea that learning something new can lead to something better in the world. Scientific discovery through our research is an engine that powers innovation, new technologies, new applications, and new or better businesses that address big challenges in the world.\n\nScientific research is hard! For organizations like ours, coming up with topics to study and ideas to test require a unique combination of deep knowledge, imagination and creativity. Grant proposals to fund research projects are time-consuming and exhausting, and only a minority of those get funded. Designing and executing experiments is tedious, laborious, and subject to failure and frequent restarts. There are no guarantees that productive, publishable advances will occur. But far more often than not, scientists will tell you, “I love it!” Why is that?\n\nThere are countless answers I could give, or that other scientists have told me. Research offers a feeling of purpose, and that’s part of what unifies us at the Danforth Center. One colleague recently told me that contributing and collaborating with other researchers, and seeing ideas and results validated, is really fulfilling. For me, the discovery process to explain a part of nature is like putting together a puzzle, except you don’t know how many pieces you have and there’s no picture on the box! It’s a challenge that rewards curiosity and persistence.\n\nBut there’s something else about discovery that’s both deeply personal and magnificently communal. When you make a discovery, or for the first time understand the answer to a previously unanswered question, you possess a piece of knowledge about the natural world that nobody else knows! It belongs exclusively to you or a small handful of team members. The reveal to your colleagues and the rest of your scientific community is even better, as is the satisfaction of being recognized for you’ve done.\n\nI believe the culture of discovery should encompass all corners of the Center, not just the PI-led research teams. Might there be opportunities to better integrate elements of scientific discovery into, say, philanthropic fundraising efforts or development of Center facilities? I’m proud of the culture of discovery at the Danforth Center and believe it should be nurtured and grown.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nWith recent or upcoming retirements that were announced recently, and the upcoming departure of Blake Meyers and part of his team, I’ve been thinking a lot lately about comings and goings. Research organizations like the Danforth Center experience a steady flow of individuals leaving for other opportunities, but also a corresponding influx of new community members who carry on the work. Departures frequently result in short-term challenges, but just as often, incoming community members present opportunities to reassess, reorient, and grow in new directions. Within scientific teams, there is sometimes tension between fulfilling our obligation to train early career scientists and patching holes that open in programs when talented technicians, graduate students and Ph.D.-level scientists actually leave to advance their careers elsewhere. But let’s go back to Blake Meyers.\n\nBlake will be leaving soon to take the position of Director of the UC Davis Genome Center, which focuses faculty, core facilities, and “omics” approaches to address questions across the breadth of biology. While I’m excited to see Blake grow with this opportunity, I’m also pondering how much he and his team will be missed. Blake’s journey to the Danforth Center started at the 2014 American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) annual meeting in Portland, Oregon, when I asked him over dinner at Departure Restaurant, “What would it take to get you to the Danforth Center?” He arrived in 2016 with a sizable team as the first joint faculty hire with the University of Missouri – Columbia.\n\nSince then, Blake and team have done pioneering research resulting in over 100 research papers, mostly focused on small RNAs in plants. They discovered the complexity, diversity, and functions of plant small RNA classes, such as those required for pollen formation in maize and other crops. The work revealed insights into evolution of plant genomes, mechanisms of disease resistance, and how plants reproduce, and has potential applications that include development of new hybrid crops. For these and numerous other contributions over the past 25 years, Blake was elected as a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2022.\n\nWe exist in world where people come and go. Nonetheless, the loss of Blake and team will be felt for quite some time. They are important contributors who have made the Danforth Center community better. But we’re a resilient Center, and bringing on board new faculty and team members in the months ahead are things we can anticipate with excitement.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nTowards the end of 2024, we’ll celebrate the invaluable contributions of Hal Davies, VP for Finance and Chief Operating Officer, who has been bedrock at the Danforth Center since early 2001. Hal informed us that he will retire at year end, meaning he will depart as one of the two longest-serving members of the Danforth Center community.\n\nWhen Hal first joined the Center as Controller, or lead accountant, he led a finance department with only one other person. Few systems and procedures were in place to manage grants, pay bills, plan budgets and handle the myriad complexities of finance. And there was the minor complication that Hal no grants experience! “I learned grants on my own,” Hal told me recently. “I was originally the grants compliance person, too.” All of the financial systems to run the Center in those early years were developed from the ground-up by Hal and his small team.\n\nWorking closely with Sam Fiorello, by 2011, Hal managed of a sustainable funding model for Center operations involving grants, annual donations and draws on our endowment. Along with ambitious fundraising plans, this allowed preparation for and execution of the Expansion Phase (2011-2020) in which we doubled the numbers of Center community members, grew the endowment and financial reserves, constructed the WHD Building, and built several new plant growth and technical facilities. Sustainable growth continues to this day.\n\nI asked Hal what has been most surprising during his journey at the Danforth Center. He said, “Learning what plant scientist do, and how we make impact. Participating in the growth of the Center and the quality of science is personally fulfilling. Even though I’m not a scientist, I feel like I’ve contributed to the science.” Hal reflected further on what it’s meant to him personally to contribute to this organization. He said, “Being part of Bill Danforth’s vision and seeing that become a reality…it changed my life. I think I became a different person, realizing there is something bigger to achieve.”\n\nI deeply appreciate Hal’s longstanding contributions to the Danforth Center, and his constant commitment to help our scientific and administrative teams succeed. I will communicate more about planning for a successor at a later date, but for now, let’s all thank Hal for a job well done!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nBonus Content: On a personal level, I credit Hal for giving Teri and I one of the biggest thrills during our time in St. Louis. Hal used to own a set of four season tickets for great seats in section 347 at St. Louis Cardinals baseball games, and he would share the cost with friends who bought sets of tickets. For years, we bought two tickets for eight games. One time, we could not attend a game for which we held tickets, so Hal offered to trade for one of his game dates. What did we get in the exchange from Hal? Game 6 of the 2011 World Series, one of the greatest games in Cardinals and World Series history. Thanks, Hal!\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nHow about a roundup of recent happenings and events that are worth highlighting for the Danforth Center community? I’m going to start with something we’re taught never to lead with…\n\n…an Apology. This past Monday, the St. Louis region experienced hazardous morning driving conditions due to icy roads. Just ask a local fire truck crew if you need a reminder! Due to concerns about safety, we closed the Danforth Center to non-essential personnel. But unlike schools and many other organizations on Monday, we failed to communicate the closure until 8:31 am. The late notice was distressing to many community members, including those who had already driven to the Center and those who had arranged child care prior to the announcement. I sincerely apologize for the late notification and aggravation this caused. We will review our inclement weather closure protocol, including how and when we notify the community, and make changes to ensure this does not happen again.\n\nCore Facility Orientation. I heard and read great things about the Core Facility Orientation last week! This is a new, recurring program timed to coincide with new community member orientations. A primary purpose of the program is to inform existing and potential core facility users about the services provided and how to gain access. So, I was surprised to learn that the majority of attendees were from administrative and non-scientific departments. These attendees participated because they want to learn more about our scientific work, our technologies and our impact. This is such a positive reflection of how community members across the Center identify with the mission and want to learn about how our core facilities contribute to meaningful outcomes. Many thanks to each core facility team for delivering the event, and to all participants for attending.\n\nBioinformatics and Beer. Did you say you want to learn more? I hope to see you at Bioinformatics and Beer this afternoon (2:00 pm, AT&T Auditorium). Among the 15 regional speakers giving short talks on data science-intensive topics, five are from Danforth Center teams. The event is intended to build regional collegiality, collaboration and strength in data science-relevant research, and to get to know better our colleagues from Washington University, Saint Louis University, and other organizations over a refreshing beverage. I appreciate the good work from each of the speakers, organizers, event team members, and participants.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nHigh quality working space for Danforth Center teams is one of the most important, sought after, guarded, and sometimes envied features of our facilities. Unlike the cosmos, space at the Center has clear limits. While people, projects and priorities are dynamic, our physical working space is relatively slow to change. Let’s consider Danforth Center space, how space decisions are made, and what we do when space needs change.\n\nHow are space assignments made? For the Plant Growth Facility (PGF) or the Field Research Site (FRS), requests are submitted by PIs or teams and assigned based on availability. Space is assigned and managed by facility personnel through processes that may involve input from the facility oversight committee. Space allocations in PGF and FRS can grow or contract over time based on the needs; because retaining space has a cost, there is an economic incentive for teams to relinquish space that is no longer needed.\n\nFor laboratories and offices, spaces are assigned to research groups, departments and programs by the Space Committee, composed of me and Becky Bart (formerly Toni Kutchan) in our roles as President/CEO and VP for Research, respectively. Additional laboratory and sit-down space requests are common due to the addition of research team members brought on board with new funded projects. The Space Committee considers a number of factors when a request is made: What is the NEED, what is the AVAILABILITY of space, and what is REASONABLE in the broader context. The broader context includes competing needs, planning for future space assignments (e.g. for a new Assistant Member and team), and fairness. Sometimes the committee seeks to address the needs of multiple groups simultaneously. This is usually the case when an entire team is relocated to cover their needs, and the vacated spaces are used to address the needs of others. Recording and implementation of space assignments are managed well by Todd Hornburg as VP for Facilities.\n\nWhat happens when critical needs are high but space is simply not available? With some careful planning, fundraising and budgeting, we can construct facilities like new greenhouses or the building extension that we’ve initiated adjacent to the PGF. We can also redesign existing space to better address current and foreseeable needs, like what was done to provide new instructional and training space.\n\nSpace can be a contentious issue, but I sincerely appreciate the professionalism and patience that I see regularly from Center community members who have needs.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nTwo of the most important types of investments we make at the Danforth Center involve recruiting new people and building new facilities. Let’s get everyone up-to-speed on recent developments in these two areas, each with important ramifications for our future.\n\nAssistant Member/PI search. We recently activated a search for an Assistant Member/PI, who will build and lead a new research team. Bringing new research groups to the Center can have a big impact through introduction of new ideas, strengthening key priority areas, bridging important technical gaps, and broadening our network of collaborators. The search committee composed of Malia Gehan (Chair), Noah Fahlgren, Armando Bravo, Doug Allen, and Myia Elliott is just now beginning work.\n\nJoint Mizzou-Danforth Center Faculty search. Our partnership with the University of Missouri – Columbia aims to have two joint faculty members based at Mizzou. A restart of the search for the second Mizzou-based joint faculty member is underway with a new committee, which includes Tessa Burch-Smith and Keith Slotkin. The search is focused on senior or mid-career candidates who qualify for appointments as both a tenured professor at the university and an Associate or Full Member at the Danforth Center. These cost-shared joint appointments aim to increase collaboration and partnerships, and to elevate plant science across the region.\n\nNew Building Construction. Speaking of hiring, the addition of new teams can put pressure on availability of space. We have experienced serious space limitations in recent years, including within the Plant Growth Facility (PGF). Despite the dramatic growth in size and scope of greenhouse and growth chamber facilities, and in the size of the PGF team needed to run the PGF, the amount of office, meeting and sit-down space for PGF team members is entirely insufficient; space for these purposes has remained static for over 20 years. We will solve that problem with construction of a 6500 sq. ft. building extension to the west side of the PGF headhouse area. In addition to the PGF team, the new space will house teams from the Phenotyping Core and Environmental and Health Safety/Biosafety. Construction begins next week.\n\nI sincerely appreciate and thank everyone working on the new searches and the building project. Their efforts will have long-lasting impact on the Center! I wish everyone a thoughtful and meaningful Martin Luther King, Jr. Holiday on Monday.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nEarly January is an interesting time for some. Goals are set, self-reflection occurs, and New Year’s resolutions for self-improvement are made. I’ve never made a New Year’s resolution, though I wish all the best to those who do. This year, however, I did do something that I hope will benefit me and others in the Danforth Center community: I asked eight trusted Center colleagues, “What can I do better in 2024?” Here are the responses.\n\nBe better at communicating important things proactively or immediately\n\nMake Faculty Meetings more interesting\n\nFind better ways to make Faculty Meeting conversations more substantive\n\nProvide more clarity on how decisions are made\n\nConvene President’s Faculty Advisory Council (PFAC) more frequently\n\nGive more information about changes in the Leadership Team\n\nJust help me know what’s going on better\n\nMake sure everyone is recognized\n\nHelp set up a comprehensive strategy for my team\n\nJoin me for lunch some time!\n\nWhile this is not a complete list of things you might think I can do better 2024, I do note a few themes. Most clearly, over half of the comments relate to doing a better job communicating about happenings, decisions, and achievements around the Danforth Center. There are a lot of sources of information that go to the Center community, and I commit to finding ways to better communicate news and other content that needs to, or should, come from me. Perhaps the Weekly Message can be used more effectively.\n\nTwo respondents zeroed right in on doing a better job using the time we have in Faculty Meetings. I can use some help in this regard, and I encourage attendees to provide ideas for content or discussions that are more relevant, engaging or necessary. One respondent surprised me with a suggestion that I could be more active in helping with strategic planning with their team. Although we have a Center-wide strategic plan through 2025, planning at the department or lab level may be just as important, or more so, for team members.\n\nI sincerely thank all those who offered their input for how I can do better in 2024. And if anyone else has helpful suggestions, maybe we can have lunch together. I wish everyone a positive and productive 2024.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nWhile arriving and walking to my office the past two mornings, I’ve passed Chuck Maye and Chris Martin (Facilities team) working on installation of a new water bottle-filling station on the 3rd level. As I told them, I’ve had the same thought both days: “Wow, are you guys always here working hard?” Given that today is Friday, December 22 with the holidays at our doorstep, most of the Danforth Center community is taking advantage of well-earned vacation leave. Passing Ryan Delpercio with a cart full of soybean plants, Tira Jones carrying a full tray, and Ron Smithey moving quickly between work sites were reminders that Chuck and Chris are not the only ones so active on site today.\n\nThat leads me to conclude 2023 Weekly Messages with a few simple thoughts, starting with my sincere thank you to everyone who gives effort that is above and beyond, like those who serve essential functions or are on-call during weekends and holidays. Thank you to everyone who contributed so much to a productive year at the Danforth Center. We succeed because individuals and teams focus on their distinct roles and collaborate with others across the Center. And I thank everyone who takes the Danforth Center mission to heart and does their job with the belief and knowledge that real people in the world will benefit from their effort.\n\nAs I finish writing this message, I was just interrupted by Bill Stutz and Andrew Witthaus (Information Technology team) and Allison Brown asking how they could help with a meeting that I’ll be hosting in a few minutes. I am reminded again that it’s an honor to be surrounded by hard-working people who contribute their professional efforts so generously at the Danforth Center. Happy Holidays!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nThere’s working quietly behind the scenes, and then there’s Ann Kruse! I suspect most of you have never met Ann. But since joining the Danforth Center in 2007, she has had an outsized but under-the-radar impact on our work, primarily as the manager of grants, budgets, consultancy agreements, and more for the multi-national Virus Resistant Cassava for Africa (VIRCA) project led by Nigel Taylor. The VIRCA project is delivering improved cassava varieties to small holder farmers in East Africa, first in Kenya, and has involved hundreds of scientists, trainees, communications specialists, regulatory experts and support teams from the U.S., Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Canada.\n\nSupporting an international project with multiple funding sources (currently Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, U.S. Agency for International Development) is an enormous challenge requiring exceptional skills in organization, financial management and project management. Ann has been that skillful individual working stealthily, quickly, accurately and effectively to hold so much of the project together. She manages budgets for teams in multiple countries; she organizes international meetings and travel; she helps students and visiting scientists come to the Danforth Center. I cannot possibly list everything does, but I can say that she navigates all of her diverse functions with remarkable focus, patience, good humor. And when the VIRCA project manager (PM) left a few years ago, Ann stepped in and took over many of the PM roles on top of her numerous other responsibilities. “Without her I could not have kept the project running over this period,” Nigel recently told me.\n\nNow, if you think my and Nigel’s opinions of Ann are high, you ought to hear what the international leads of the VIRCA partnership have to say about her! I recently read comments from seven such individuals. They praised Ann with terms including diligent, patient, meticulous, fantastic, genuinely caring, respectful, and “bedrock for VIRCA”. One of them said, “You have been a strong pillar for all, especially the partners and how you have managed us with so much professionalism and efficiency.” Ann has a lot of admirers overseas and at the Danforth Center because she’s helped so many succeed!\n\nAfter 16 years and so much that she has achieved, Ann will retire from the Danforth Center next week. I am sad to see her leave, but so proud of what she’s done. I hope everyone joins me in expressing sincere appreciation for Ann and her commitment to the Danforth Center, the VIRCA project, and the numerous international partners with whom she has worked.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nA few weeks ago, our Board of Directors met for the third and final time in 2023. The work that the Board does affects the Center in countless ways, and the work by so many of you to communicate our purpose, plans and achievements to the Board makes a big difference. The great efforts to guide a tour or deliver a presentation to Directors, or to develop the Center budget for Board consideration, are just a few examples of contributions that are clearly noticed and appreciated by Directors. I thank everyone who helped our Directors do their work and better understand us in 2023.\n\nSeveral important matters that affect the Danforth Center community were discussed and decided at the recent meeting. Here is a recap of a few highlights, some of which I’ll return to in the near future.\n\nKirk Czymmek provided a wonderful overview of the Advanced Bioimaging Lab, including descriptions of new, bleeding-edge instrumentation and the breadth of research enabled for our scientists and partners.\n\nThe 2024 Center operating budget of $46.3M, as well as the capital and non-operating budgets, were approved. The operating budget includes a 3.5% overall pool for merit increases.\n\nThe 2023 Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) report was presented by Eric Ward, SAB Chair. The favorable report focused on the work presented by a subset of PIs and Core Facility Directors at the SAB annual meeting in September.\n\nI presented a report on 2023 usage and new construction at the Field Research Site. The research and achievements made by Center teams on 65 planted acres, and within working facilities under active development, were truly appreciated by the Board.\n\nAnd though you will hear more about this from me later, I want to let our community know the exciting news that Penny Pennington was elected as new Chair of the Board. Penny, who leads the brokerage and financial advisory firm, Edward Jones, will serve a five-year term as Chair. I am excited to work with her.\n\nFinally, during the meeting and dinner afterwards, the Board expressed appreciation to the outgoing Chair, Todd Schnuck, for his impactful work since 2019. Todd has been instrumental in our success over the past five years, and he deserves our sincere thanks!\n\nI will be traveling all of next week, so the next Weekly Message will be on\n\nDec. 15. Until then, take care.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nI want to return to my October 11 message to the Danforth Center community in which I expressed deep concern for all those who were directly or indirectly impacted by the October 7 attacks in Israel and subsequent conflict. At the time, over 1600 people were either killed or kidnapped, including some with connections to Center community members. Since that message, an escalated war in Gaza and the West Bank has resulted in nearly 10-fold more deaths, mostly among Palestinians, and displacement of nearly 2 million people, again mostly Palestinians. This human tragedy is all the more staggering given the death and suffering of large numbers of innocent people, including young children. The geopolitical history underlying or influencing this tragic conflict offers little encouragement for the future.\n\nAs I’ve heard from many of you, the past six weeks have been difficult to process and comprehend. These events affect all of us, regardless of political, religious, or social views. I have spoken with community members who originate from Israel or Palestinian territories, or who identify with affected populations. These individuals carry a unique burden at this time, and are further pained by Islamophobia and anti-Semitism that has grown significantly in recent weeks. They and their families are changed by these events, just as they have been shaped by histories that extend long before the current conflict. And these community members are facing the uncertainty or fear about what comes next.\n\nThis message is written to recognize and support of all those within the Danforth Center community who are hurting, and to encourage the entire community to reach out to colleagues who might need a little help or just a sympathetic friend to talk with. These expressions of concern can make a big difference. Our values compel us to reach out and seek understanding about our diverse community members, especially in times of need. And for those in need of professional help, as most of us do from time to time, our Employee Assistance Program is there for you at no cost.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nWe were pleased to hold the first Todd Mockler Memorial Lecture this week, a new annual event to remember Todd and to hear from a speaker who was uniquely impacted by him or his work. We were thrilled to honor Malia Gehan as the inaugural lecturer.\n\nMalia spoke about her journey from being a postdoctoral fellow in Todd’s lab to a leader of her own team as a soon-to-be Associate Member and PI at the Danforth Center. She talked about how she learned from Todd to think bigger and attack important problems outside of her comfort zone. When the Bellwether Phenotyping system was installed 10 years ago, it was Malia and fellow postdoctorals Noah Fahlgren and Max Feldman who led development of new computer vision software, called PlantCV, to extract meaning from the voluminous data now on our hands. This was all the more impressive since Malia was not exactly what one would call a “skilled coder” or “accomplished programmer” at that time. But her determined drive to build computing tools that any plant scientist could use productively resulted in PlantCV becoming a widely adopted standard within the image-based phenotyping community. Malia’s highly collaborative research uses genomic, computational and other approaches to understand how plants deal with environmental stresses, like high temperature.\n\nMalia had several concerns about this lecture ahead of time. First, she wanted to represent well those who have worked with Todd through the years; she was spectacular in doing just that. And second, she was uneasy about speaking in front of her everyday colleagues. “I was more nervous speaking in front of a Danforth Center audience than in front of an outside group,” she told me. I could relate to this. There’s something about speaking in front of a familiar crowd that raises anxiety, perhaps because you sense that they know too well exactly what you’re really like. That voice of the imposter inside our heads often gets louder as we approach a microphone in front of discerning associates.\n\nI thank Malia for accepting the invitation to be the first Mockler Lecturer, and for representing so well her past influences, present achievements and future impact. She embodies the best of both the Mockler legacy and the Danforth Center community.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nLet’s start with a big “Thank you” to everyone who participates in the broad range of donor-based or philanthropic fundraising that supports the Danforth Center and our strategic priorities. Though we have a talented and experienced team in Development that spearheads our fundraising endeavors, this is really a shared effort with every other team at the Center. Indeed, success in fundraising is shared success that benefits all corners of our organization.\n\nOur fundraising priorities track closely to the priorities, initiatives and desired outcomes specified in the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan. Generally, fundraising from philanthropic sources enables us to construct and support facilities, develop core capabilities, undertake new initiatives, and do those things that cannot be easily supported through competitive grants from research funding agencies. Without philanthropic support, we would be unable to function as an institution. The non-philanthropic funding agencies (e.g. National Science Foundation), on the other hand, support research projects led by PIs and acquisition of some instrumentation.\n\nHere are just a few of the many recent shared successes in raising support from donors.\n\nSupport for Core Facilities – The Advanced Bioimaging Lab was able to acquire the Hydra Bio Plasma-FIB for ultra-high-resolution cellular cryo-tomography (for fun, repeat that quickly 5 times). We have initiated building of a new office, meeting and working space for PGF, Phenotyping, and Environmental Health and Safety teams. The Phenotyping Facility will soon start on both a major refurbishment of the Bellwether Phenotyping Facility and a significant new field phenotyping initiative.\n\nDevelopment of Field Research Site – Speaking of the Field Site, most of the $11.2M for acquisition and development came from philanthropic donations. Construction of mechanical, storage and working facilities at the site is underway now.\n\nSupport for Graduate Student Fellowships – We will be expanding support for graduate students with a new annual, named fellowship that will start in 2024.\n\nAuthentic Research Experiences (pre-college) – This important program led by Education Research and Outreach has received philanthropic funding for student support, development of resources, and transportation.\n\nThese and all of the other recent fundraising successes have involved collaborative participation for critical conversations about needs, proposal planning and preparation, and cultivation and stewardship of donors. In some cases, you have stewarded and built trust with prospective supporters long before a gift is proposed. I and the Development team are deeply appreciative of all your shared efforts!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nI met with the President’s Faculty Advisory Council (PFAC) yesterday to undertake the annual process of reviewing and revising faculty committee assignments. I know, that’s not the best hook to draw you in, but please keep reading. Though work on committees is necessary to cover important roles and responsibilities, like oversight of core facilities, for me it was an opportunity to reflect upon the following question: Are we expecting too much from our hard-working, over-achieving and sometimes over-stressed Danforth Center community members?\n\nWe have a large number of productive, ambitious, self-driven individuals who are achieving big things here. We have countless scientists, technical specialists, administrative personnel, facilities personnel, fundraisers, and other professionals who take on heavy lifts representing more than their fair share. Many have additional responsibilities or shared appointments with other institutions, or commitments beyond the Danforth Center. Some take on and achieve more as part of their intrinsic nature. Some are motivated to do more by our mission and vision, and the possibility of improving the lives of others. There are those who we’re over-assigning, or are self-overloading, with expectations that may exceed their capacity. And then there’s the important reality that some of our over-stretched community members may feel under-appreciated for the work they do.\n\nLearning about how many of you feel about these issues in recent weeks and months has been helpful and, in some cases, eye-opening for me. It provided part of the motivation going into yesterday’s PFAC meeting to lessen the overall burden of committee assignments. Generally, we sought to shrink the size of committees that do not need large membership. We sought to limit the numbers of committees each person sits on, and to be more even-handed in balancing workloads. We also factored in the fact that many serve on committees or have important responsibilities at other institutions.\n\nOf course, there is much more to consider beyond committee assignments. Are we over-assigning work to our most talented team members rather than reaching out to others who are capable but need a little help? Are we over-asking our best communicators to give tours and presentations rather than bringing along others who are willing but a little less experienced? I encourage all of our leaders and managers to give some additional thought to how we’re working with those who have more-than-full plates, what we’re asking of them, and how we can better express our appreciation.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nAfter the recent announcement about Toni Kutchan’s upcoming retirement at the end of this year, several of you have asked, “What will we do to fill the vacant Vice President for Research position?” I’ll get to the answer in just a moment, but first let’s consider what the Danforth Center VP for Research (VPR) actually does.\n\nThe VPR serves as the Center’s senior scientist and a key member of the Leadership Team. They are influential in setting strategic directions and priorities. The VPR’s roles and responsibilities partly include:\n\nFaculty Development – The VPR leads the Promotion and Retention process and mentoring program for faculty in the Member track. The VPR is instrumental in all new faculty hiring, and as a member of the Space Committee, helps decide how working spaces are allocated.\n\nAllocation of Special Funding – The VPR leads the processes to award competitive grants for new equipment, graduate student fellowships, and internal research projects.\n\nResearch Compliance – The VPR oversees or participates in our programs for biosafety, environmental health and safety, research integrity, and management of regulated materials.\n\nOversight of Core Facilities – Among other roles, the VPR oversees the directors for several core facilities.\n\nIn addition, when we experience surprises, emergencies or other unanticipated situations (e.g. a global pandemic), the VPR provides invaluable leadership that keeps the Center moving forward. While Toni deserves our thanks and appreciation for the great job she’s done in all of her roles, she deserves special recognition for her out-of-view contributions in dealing with various crises.\n\nMoving forward upon Toni’s retirement, we will appoint an Interim VP for Research from within our senior faculty for 2024. The Interim appointment is intended to be of limited duration, though the expectations for this position holder to lead, contribute and help move us ahead remain high.\n\nOh, I almost forgot. Becky Bart has generously agreed to serve as the Interim VP for Research. Becky has been at the Danforth Center since 2013, leading an ambitious research program, directing the SINC Center, and serving in numerous other capacities. I’m thankful that Becky is willing to take on significant new responsibilities, and excited to work with her in this new role.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nI hope everyone takes a few minutes to visit the recently installed feature that recognizes and honors those who lived on this site prior to the arrival of European and U.S. settlers. Overlooking the Danforth Center prairie near our main entrance, just east of the water garden, stands a plaque that reads:\n\nAs an institute focused on preserving and renewing the environment through plant science, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center recognizes and honors Indigenous Peoples as the original stewards of the land. The Danforth Center acknowledges that it is located on the ancestral and unceded lands of the Osage, Missouri and Illini people, who were removed unjustly, and that we in this community are the beneficiaries of that removal. By recognizing Indigenous Peoples and their traditional homeland, we express gratitude for their enduring stewardship of the land. We honor and respect Indigenous Peoples, past and present, by building a more inclusive and equitable space for all.\n\nPopulations of indigenous nations and tribes that lived on this land were dynamic. The Osage, for example, originated from populations that migrated over a few centuries from the Ohio River valley towards the Mississippi River, eventually moving further west to become the dominant power in central and western Missouri by the early 19th century. The Illini were estimated to number approximately 10,000 people across 12 or 13 tribes (including the Cahokia in this region) along the Mississippi River valley in the 1600s. Due to conflict and disease, however, the Illini numbers were reduced to a few hundred by the late 1700s.\n\nStarting in the early 1800s, the U.S. government instituted a series of policies that resulted in displacement of Native American populations. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 wrote into law that the government could legally take land from Native American nations and tribes, and force relocation to designated territories in the west, mainly in what is now Oklahoma. The Osage, Illini and other Indigenous Peoples from this region ultimately suffered this fate, as well as further harm when the U.S. failed to fulfill terms of agreements made during forced relocation.\n\nThank you to all of the Danforth Center community members and external partners who advocated for, facilitated, wrote, built, and installed this plaque that stands as a permanent reminder of the original inhabitants of our site.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nA few weeks ago, I wrote about the logic used for decision-making in my role at the Danforth Center. In retrospect, I undersold the fact the nearly all major decisions involve a collaborative effort of many people through information gathering, assessment, persuasion or consensus-building. Creation of the Danforth Center annual budget is a great example of such teamwork. The budget lays out anticipated revenue and expenses for the year, and once approved by the Board of Directors, serves as the financial blueprint for our work. We’re a not-for-profit organization; but don’t forget, we’re also a not-for-loss, so the budget needs to balance. We’re well underway in developing the 2024 budget, and I think it’s worth understanding what goes into that process.\n\nLet’s start with anticipated revenue. The money that supports our salaries, supplies, and most everything else comes predominantly from two types of sources – competitive grants and philanthropy. Grants support most of the direct costs (e.g. lab supplies) and some indirect costs (e.g. facilities support) of research projects managed by PIs. Philanthropic gifts cover most other Danforth Center costs, and they enable us to function as an organization. As per the intention of each donor, some gifts are made to support annual mission-relevant activities, and some are given to grow our endowment. We draw an amount from the endowment each year by a formula. For the current 2023 budget, we planned for $19.1M in grant revenue, $2.4M in annual donor gifts, and $20.1M in draw from the endowment. We also planned for $5.9M from a variety of other sources (e.g. external user fees for core facilities), bringing the total anticipated funding level to $47.5M.\n\nOn the expense side of the budget, the leaders of each department submit a detailed budget request in the Fall for the upcoming year. Proposed spending is reviewed carefully with an eye toward meeting essential needs, supporting strategic priorities and good opportunities, financial sustainability and stewardship. Department leaders are appreciated collaborators in the budget process. For 2023, we budgeted for operating and non-operating costs totaling $46.3. The slight anticipated surplus at year-end will go into our operating reserve, which we maintain to cover unexpected events or future income shortfalls.\n\nThe budget planning process is managed, overseen, and executed with great skill by Djuan Coleman, Hal Davies, Leticia Slack, Darine Kube, Karla Elliot, and Heather Bowen in the Finance Team. Let’s all thank them for their hard work!\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nIt occurred to me that I’ve not highlighted any Danforth Center scientific publications recently. Let’s remedy that right here with three excellent papers, and with a few comments to help the non-specialists. Congratulations to all of the contributors!\n\nYu, Y., Hu, H., Voytas, D.F., Doust, A.N., and Kellogg, E.A. (2023). The YABBY gene\n\nSHATTERING1 controls activation rather than patterning of the abscission zone in Setaria viridis. New Phytologist 240, 846-862. DOI: 10.1111/nph.19157.\n\nPlants have highly evolved mechanisms to shed or drop organs (abscission) in response to environmental or developmental cues. It’s why you have to rake leaves in the Fall! But in agriculture, the natural shedding of flowers or seeds is detrimental, and cereal crops with abscission-inhibiting mutations in certain genes, like SHATTERING1, have been bred to dramatically increase yield. Using Crispr gene editing and detailed analyses, Yu et al. show for the first time some mechanistic features of abscission in the grasses, including the role of the plant hormone auxin.\n\nLudwig, E., Polydore, S., Berry, J., Sumner, J., Ficor, T., Agnew, E., Haine, K., Greenham, K., Fahlgren, N., Mocker, T.C., Gehan, M.A. (2023). Natural variation in Brachypodium distachyon responses to combined abiotic stresses. Plant J. DOI:10.1111/tpj.16387.\n\nUnderstanding how native plants deal with extreme temperature, drought, and other environmental stresses offers insights into how crops can be bred to better withstand the harsh realities resulting from climate change. Ludwig and collaborators studied the genetic variation in how 149 different accessions of the grass Brachypodium distachyon from diverse Mediterranean and Middle East locations deal with heat, drought and combined heat+drought stresses. They found surprising relationships between heat and drought responses, and at least one new genetic determinant that controls the amount of stress damage.\n\nGeng, S., Hamaji, T., Ferris, P.J., and Umen, J. A conserved RWP-RK transcription factor VSR1 controls gametic differentiation in volvocine algae. (2023). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2305099120.\n\nThis most recent work from the Umen lab gets at the critical control mechanism for sex determination in single-celled and multicellular algae. The capacity to produce distinct mating types (e.g. male and female) is the foundation for reshuffling of genetic material within a species, which maintains genetic diversity and capacity to adapt in different environments. Geng et al. discovered that the key regulatory protein VSR1 either interacts with itself (VSR1-VSR1 complex) to induce female gametes, or with MID protein (VSR1-MID) to induce male gametes. The data show elegantly why either male or female gametes form, and they give reasons why this mechanism may also occur throughout the plant kingdom.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nAs I’ve indicated often in the past, I spend a lot of time speaking about the Danforth Center and our work with public, non-scientific audiences. Largely through trial and failure, minimal formal training, a lot of observation, and more analysis than you would ever guess, I enjoy speaking to and interacting with public groups. And I have fun doing so, especially bringing the human element into the conversation about what we do.\n\nWhich brings me to the first 10 minutes of a Story Collider podcast episode called “Food Science: Stories About Things We Eat,” featuring Katie Murphy, Director of the Center’s Phenotyping Core Facility and PI. Katie talks about her unpredictable journey becoming a TikTok star, bringing the joy, excitement, inclusiveness and magic of plant science to the fickle, impatient social media audience. Like almost nothing else I’ve heard, Katie’s story shows what happens when scientists let the public in on the mysteries to be solved and surprises to be learned when we use science to answer a question. With humor, kindness, wonder and accessibility, Katie shows through TikTok and the podcast what most non-scientists rarely hear or see: life in the lab is funny, annoying, interesting, boring, surprising and quirky. That is, Katie shows us that a life in science is a very human, relatable life, and anything but a separate existence of elites looking to impose their will on society.\n\nI think spreading this idea about the human nature of science, as Katie shows, has enormous power to break down barriers that have grown between scientists and much of the public. But we have too few people within the scientific community who are willing, capable and brave enough to face the public, armed with the amusing imperfections of a scientist, and risk criticism, hostility or indifference. I believe it’s exactly those amusing imperfections that scientists need to lean on to reach and relate to broader audiences. I think that’s a big part of what Katie’s outreach is actually doing.\n\nI hereby deem Katie’s podcast required listening for everyone who talks to others about science or the work we do. And do your own followers a favor by passing it along. Have a good weekend.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\nAt a monthly meeting today for a collaborative project between the Carrington and Bart labs, much time was spent discussing project priorities. There are not enough people, resources, funding, space or time to do everything optimally for the project. Prioritization is a necessity. But because the nature of future results is rarely clear, prioritization intrinsically involves the risk of making ‘wrong’ choices, even though the choices today might seem sensible.\n\nPrioritization and decision-making with uncertain consequences are major sources of worry in my role at the Danforth Center. Most prioritization decisions involve allocation or reallocation of funding, space, or peoples’ time and effort. With a few questions and real examples, let me share the process I use in making decisions.\n\nIs this a ‘must do?’ Decisions to get the ‘must dos’ done are often the easiest. We must maintain our facilities in working order, or comply with federal requirements. We must provide ASL interpreters to support our Deaf community members. Funding will always be allocated as a budget priority, or identified in the case of unbudgeted emergencies.\n\nIs this a strategic priority for which we’ve planned? Priorities in the 2021-2025 Strategic Plan are baked into our budgeting and fundraising plans. Some of these priorities, like development of the Field Research Site, are expensive, multi-year commitments, and we match up the pace of spending with the pace of fundraising. The open decisions are often about when to start.\n\nIf this is a good idea outside of the strategic priorities but worthwhile doing, can we afford it? Here’s where we sometimes have interesting or difficult conversations, and often the answer is ‘no,’ or ‘not this year.’ But really good ideas are worth talking about because we may be able to apply for new grants from funding agencies, or secure other sources of novel funding.\n\nFor each of the categories above, what are the collateral consequences? If we prioritize a Field Research Site, how does that affect future Center budgets? In support of Deaf community members, to whom are new responsibilities assigned and how do we rebalance workloads? If we assign additional lab space to a team, how will that affect our ability to recruit new teams? Broadly, how does a decision in one area affect others? What might seem like unnecessary delays in decision making is often because of the need to anticipate and plan for the collateral consequences.\n\nMy goal in all decision-making is not perfection, but to be reasonable. I thank all those who collaborate with me to achieve that goal.\n\nJim Carrington,\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\nDear Danforth Center Community,\n\n“How did they do that?” This was a question I heard immediately after the Big Ideas 3.0 presentations last evening. The program featured three teams of three early-career, Danforth Center scientists or educators. In front of a public audience of over 350, and 300 more online, each team presented a 14-minute talk about an ambitious, impactful idea that extends from their work, and then fielded questions from three panelists (thanks to Janet Wilding, Benjamin Akande and Marilyn Bush, and to MC Chip Lerwick) who had no prior exposure to the topics at hand. Each team performed brilliantly with engaging, audience-inspiring flair. But, how did they do that?\n\nPart of the answer is rather obvious. Over 11 weeks, they worked incredibly hard on collaboratively formulating their ideas, and then organizing, agonizing, re-organizing, refining and rehearsing their presentations. At weekly conv"
