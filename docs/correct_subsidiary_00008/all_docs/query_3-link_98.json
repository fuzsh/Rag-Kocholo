        "text": "What is a product launch?\n\nA product launch is a process in which a new product or service is brought to market by a company.\n\nThe primary purpose of a launch is to provoke a sense of anticipation and generate awareness of your product amongst your target audience.\n\nAs a collaborative exercise, product launches require input from different people within an organization to ensure the process is successful. These include sales, customer success, product, and product marketing.\n\nHow do you pitch a product launch?\n\nAn effective pitch is pivotal to the success of any product launch. To do this successfully, you must combine thorough research, meticulous preparation, and an engaging presentation.\n\nHere are some tips to help you prepare for the product launch pitch:\n\nDon’t settle for second best. You need to pitch your product to an investor that ticks all the boxes. Conduct thorough research before pitching so you’re not wasting your time and that of your attendees. Preparation is key to helping you find the right investor – don’t try taking any shortcuts.\n\nMake a good first impression. Investors team up with people they know, like, and trust – you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. You need to take this opportunity to ensure you convince a potential investor that you’re the right person to deliver on your promises and release a successful product.\n\nBe confident, but not presumptuous. While investors want to see a confident pitch, it isn’t appropriate to be overly confident. For example, insisting a potential investor sign a non-disclosure agreement isn’t acceptable. Bide your time, nail that all-important first impression, and focus on the specifics when/if the time comes.\n\nInclude data in your pitch. Never underestimate the importance of data. Numbers can be your perfect ally if you’re faced with tricky questions or have to support claims made in your pitch. Always be sure to say where you got your data from, include comprehensive, granular information, and select stats that meet the requirements of your audience.\n\nPrepare for criticism. It’s important to prepare yourself for a tough crowd. You need to develop a thick skin and take potential criticism on the chin. Keep your eye fixed firmly on the importance of securing your investment, stay composed, and don’t get defensive.\n\nWhat’s important when launching a new product?\n\nProduct differentiation\n\nDifferentiating your product sets it aside from the competition and provides your target personas with a distinct reason to opt for your company – if competing products aren’t offering the same features, where else can they go?\n\nAs a product marketer, grasping the significance of product differentiation is essential for the triumph of your new product launch. Setting your product apart from the competition is crucial because it offers a compelling reason for your target audience to choose your product over market alternatives.\n\nThis differentiation not only attracts customers but also justifies the introduction of higher price points. In a market where uniqueness is highly valued, offering a product that stands out can significantly increase consumer interest and willingness to pay more.\n\nDifferentiation should go beyond mere features; it must address a specific need or pain point not being met by existing products. This approach is effective for both attracting new customers and maintaining the interest of current ones.\n\nYour communication strategy should aim to humanize your product, making it relatable and easily understandable to your audience. Clear articulation of how your product alleviates a particular problem can establish a stronger connection with customers, building trust and enhancing the perceived value of your product.\n\nRemember, avoiding technical jargon and speaking in terms your customers can understand is key to making your product relatable on a human level. This strategy can significantly accelerate adoption and drive success for your new product launch.\n\nWhich KPIs and metrics are important when launching products?\n\nWhen launching a product, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that truly matter is essential. Revenue should be at the forefront of these metrics. Surprisingly, many teams overlook setting a clear revenue target, yet without this, it's challenging to gauge the success of your launch. Knowing the revenue you aim to generate gives direction and purpose to your launch strategy.\n\nMoreover, dissecting the revenue goal, especially for global businesses, is vital. This means setting regional revenue targets and considering the unique business and pipeline objectives of local sales and marketing leaders. Different regions may contribute differently to the overall goal, as market challenges and customer pain points can vary significantly from one area to another.\n\nYour product’s value proposition should be clear and quantifiable. In the B2B sector, this often boils down to three core benefits: Enabling customers to make money, saving time or reducing costs, and minimizing risk. These benefits must be backed by hard data.\n\nMerely stating that your product is faster or better isn’t enough. It's about providing specific, quantifiable values that the product delivers, which can make a real difference in your customer's operations.\n\nFor instance, if your product automates a process, quantify the efficiency gains. Detail how many people are required for the task, the time taken before and after implementing your product, and the overall efficiency improvements. These data points are crucial in justifying your product's value and setting it apart from competitors.\n\nAnother critical aspect is understanding your competition. Determine how many competitors you aim to displace with your launch and how you will handle objections.\n\nFinally, triangulating personas and understanding geographic trends and nuances are crucial in tailoring your launch to specific markets and customer segments. These factors are integral to a successful product launch and should be a central part of your strategy.\n\nIt’s natural for companies to try their utmost to differentiate themselves from the competition – but what do you do if you’re truly struggling to set yourself apart from market alternatives?\n\nHow to work with product management teams\n\nAn effective working dynamic plays a crucial role in companies achieving their short and long-term goals, and product management and product marketing teams are by no means exempt from this rationale.\n\nAs a product marketer, your collaboration with the product management team is crucial to identify performance metrics that matter to the end-user. It's essential to challenge your product teams if they aren't providing the insights you need to market effectively. Product development focuses on innovation and feature creation, but your role is to translate these features into benefits that resonate with potential buyers.\n\nProduct teams may excel in creating new features, but the real question is whether these features address the actual needs of the end-user. To find this out, dig into the conversations product teams have had with users. For instance, if the product team mentions that a new feature can reduce a three-person, two-day task to a two-hour solo job, that's a goldmine for your marketing narrative.\n\nHowever, if the product team's insights lack depth, don't hesitate to push back. Your ability to sell the product and drive company revenue hinges on quantifying the product's value. Without concrete data from the product team, your marketing efforts might not reach their full potential.\n\nCustomers face difficulty in choosing between multiple options when none of them clearly quantify their value. If your product is the only one in the market that articulates its value in clear, measurable terms, it stands a higher chance of being chosen. In today's competitive landscape, a product that can demonstrate tangible benefits clearly and concisely is more likely to win the customer's favor.\n\nAligning metrics with the sales cycle\n\nSome sales cycles are much longer than 30 days, so there are low indicators of seeing that metric until months out.\n\nIn aligning metrics with the sales cycle, particularly for revenue measurement, it's crucial to adopt a holistic approach. Start by looking at the overall revenue of the business yearly. Break this down by region – diving into your geographic data – and product to understand where your growth expectations lie.\n\nThis approach allows you to set nuanced revenue goals for each product, taking into account regional adoption rates and market feedback.\n\nFor instance, you might anticipate initial adoption in the U.S. and delay the push in Europe based on market signals. This decision should reflect the way your business is segmented across different regions. Such an approach helps in setting realistic and targeted revenue goals.\n\nWhen setting these goals, integrate them with the broader business strategy. This step is often overlooked, as many businesses adopt a more generic approach, launching products globally without clear revenue sources.\n\nA more analytical strategy, where you identify specific regional needs and how your product addresses them, can lead to more successful outcomes. For example, if a significant portion of your revenue is expected to come from the APAC region, tailor your strategy to meet the specific needs of that market.\n\nWhile revenue is the primary metric, several sub-metrics under it need attention. These finer details make the goals actionable and give every team a clear understanding of their responsibilities.\n\nFor regional teams, develop specific programs with clear markers to ensure alignment with the overarching revenue goals. This targeted approach, based on thorough analysis and realistic goal-setting, can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your product launch.\n\nThe importance of the post-launch process\n\nWhile companies are often thorough when completing the stages up to a product being released, companies are sometimes guilty of neglecting the post-launch process, despite its importance to ensuring a product’s sustained success.\n\nHow to use market research during a product launch\n\nMarket research plays a fundamental role in ensuring your product launch is executed to perfection. If you cut corners, not only will you be running the risk of attracting negative personas, but your lack of preparation could even benefit your competitors.\n\nThe good news is conducting market research is easier than it’s ever been before, with a host of dedicated customer and market tools available to help you gather essential qualitative and quantitative data.\n\nCommon barriers when launching a product (and how to overcome them)\n\nAs is the case with any process, there are common barriers that product marketers may encounter when launching a product. These include:\n\nCustomers resisting change\n\nLack of market understanding\n\nNo in-house training\n\nInaccurate personas\n\nToo much innovation\n\nDemand outstrips supply\n\nPain points aren’t addressed\n\nPoor pricing strategy\n\nLack of communication\n\nHow do I start launching a product?\n\nA product launch feels like a huge undertaking, but without enough planning, customer, and market research, and overall preparation, it's impossible to expect anything to happen.\n\nThe key to success is understanding where you should focus your efforts and how to manage each step of the process.\n\nThe launch process is split into three sections: Pre-launch, the launch itself, and post-launch. There are certain steps you need to take throughout this process to achieve and surpass your goals.\n\nHow to prepare for a product launch\n\nPreparing for a product launch involves adapting to different phases, each with its unique set of tasks and focus areas.\n\nIn the early stages, your days as a product marketer are predominantly dedicated to research and data assessment. This phase requires significant solitary time to delve into understanding market opportunities, analyzing trends, and identifying customer needs. It's a period of intense focus, where much of your time might be spent in deep analysis and strategizing.\n\nAs the product development progresses and you move closer to the execution stage, your role becomes more collaborative and dynamic. This phase involves frequent interactions with various teams across the organization. You'll find yourself leading meetings, creating marketing materials, gathering feedback, and coordinating efforts to ensure everything aligns perfectly for the launch.\n\nThroughout these stages, your role is central to the product's journey. You act as the linchpin connecting different departments – from sales and marketing to the product team. This requires a balance between focused individual work and collaborative efforts.\n\nAlways be ready to switch gears, from deep strategic thinking to active cross-functional collaboration, as you guide the product toward a successful launch.\n\nThe steps involved in the pre-launch process\n\nThe pre-launch process of a product is multifaceted and complex, often likened to the submerged part of an iceberg, with the launch being just the visible tip. This process starts well before the actual ideation, focusing initially on thoroughly understanding customer needs. It's critical to ensure that every step of product development aligns with these needs.\n\nAs the product develops, it's vital to continually revisit the market to adapt and refine both the product and its messaging. This iterative process is essential to stay on track with market demands and customer expectations. Throughout this phase, your goal is to align all elements of the product and its promotion, ensuring they are ready for a seamless launch.\n\nCoordination and clear communication across various teams are key. Everyone involved in the launch should be aware of the goals, targets, and the specific audience you aim to reach. As a leader, you need to ensure that the entire team is aligned and moving in the right direction.\n\nOn the day of the launch, your focus shifts to execution. All the preparatory work culminates in this moment, and the emphasis is on implementing the plans you've laid out. However, the work doesn't stop there. Post-launch, you should be ready to iterate and make adjustments based on feedback and market response.\n\nThis ongoing process is crucial for the long-term success of the product.\n\nHow to get salespeople excited about your launch\n\nSalespeople are pivotal to the success of a product marketing team.\n\nYou can put hours upon hours into nailing your product’s positioning and messaging but the reality is all that hard work can be undone in a matter of minutes if it’s not understood and acted on by your sales teams.\n\nHere are some tips on how you can get salespeople excited about your product launch:\n\n1. Use real-life anecdotes\n\nYou telling salespeople your new product or feature is great and that your audience will love it is one thing, your target market telling them is another.\n\nAt the end of the day, at the most basic level, sales reps’ primary aim is to sell. The more convinced they are that what you’re telling them will help them do that, the more likely they are to sit up and listen – and what illustrates that better than active testimonials?\n\nSo, if you have a beta version that’s been rolled out to X number of customers, pick their brains, compile their feedback, and let them do some of the pitchings for you. If you don’t have any pilot results, the next best alternative is your data.\n\nPresumably, you ran some research before going ahead with the new product or feature you’re about to launch (if you didn’t, eek!), so use those numbers to back yourself up.\n\nFor example, going in with this:\n\n“Our research showed 65% of lost customers didn’t convert because we didn’t have this feature, so the fact we now have it will improve your odds of closing deals.”\n\nIs way stronger than:\n\n“We’ve decided to add this feature to product X and it does this, this, and this…”\n\nGo in with a role reversal approach. This time, you’re the sellers and they’re the market. Sell your product or feature to them.\n\n2. Make it interactive\n\nInstead of speaking to your sales team for 15, 20, or 30 minutes, mix it up by incorporating a bit of role-playing. As well as being more engaging, it’ll help them contextualize what you’re telling them and offer up some practical pitching tips, too.\n\nTip #1: Make sure the people involved with the role-play are up for it and enthusiastic. Two people begrudgingly and half-heartedly acting in front of a room of sales reps won’t harbor the results you’re after.\n\nTip #2: Consider using your reps as the stars of the show. We’ll touch on this in more detail a little later on but often, salespeople are more likely to listen to other salespeople, so capitalizing on this might make everyone more receptive to your efforts.\n\n3. Use gamification\n\nA lot of sales departments gamify their targets and day-to-day. The first person to reach X sales might get an early Friday finish. Every Thursday they might run a raffle. They might have an ongoing, quarterly leaderboard, and so on.\n\nIf it works, it works, so get on their wavelength and consider adding an element of gamification to your launch.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe first rep to make $XXXX in sales gets a $100 voucher, the second $75, and the third $50, or\n\nThe rep at the top of the deals closed leaderboard at the end of month one gets half a day in lieu.\n\nUse your imagination, factor in what works best for your set-up, and of course, remember to run your idea by the departmental heads first.\n\n4. Split it up\n\nFrom features to pricing to sales enablement collateral to messaging to demos to… you get the gist, there’s a lot you need to communicate with sales teams before launch.\n\nSo, instead of overwhelming them with info in one not-so-swift swoop, think about breaking it up into weekly sessions on specific subjects.\n\nFor example:\n\nWeek 1: Product features, benefits, and pricing\n\nWeek 2: Messaging, positioning, and marketing\n\nWeek 3: Sales enablement collateral, etc.\n\nThere are studies out there that show our attention spans are as short as 14 minutes and after that window’s passed, people start to drift out of focus. With that in mind, maybe try to keep each of your meetings within or around a quarter of an hour.\n\n5. Star your salespeople\n\nWe promised we’d expand on this point earlier, and here we are. Rightly or wrongly, salespeople can be more inclined to pay attention to their own and whether we agree with it or not, it makes sense to take whichever approach is going to be most effective.\n\nIn practice, you could look to do this in a couple of ways:\n\nOption 1: Sticking with the role-play idea, instead of using people from your product marketing team, recruit people from sales – just make sure you clue them up on the product or feature in advance.\n\nOption 2: Get your reps to deliver all or part of your meetings. If you do go with this tactic though, just make sure you properly train them beforehand and you or someone else from your team is present to make sure they stick to the script and have support if any questions arise they’re unable to answer.\n\nOne last thing worth bearing in mind for this one is which salespeople you choose. To be truly effective the person/people you pick should be top performers and well-respected among the team.\n\n6. Lead by example\n\nOkay, so this one might sound basic, but it’s important. If you want your sales teams to be excited you need to emit that kind of vibe – and that means presenting with gusto and showing you’re genuinely pumped.\n\nBeing a great presenter is a skill and we don’t think it’s right to say “If you’re not comfortable doing it yourself, pass it on to someone else in the team who’s good at it.” It’s cliche, we know, but practice does make perfect, so use your launch meetings as an opportunity to grow and the more you do the better you’ll be.\n\nHere are a few quick-fire tips to help you nail the essentials:\n\nDo a practice run before you stand in front of sales\n\nCome prepared with a few prompts as a safety blanket\n\nAssert yourself both physically and vocally\n\nSit or stand upright, use gestures, and be mindful of your facial expressions\n\nSpeak confidently and loudly (without bellowing!)\n\nMake eye contact with those in the room\n\nAsk questions to get people involved\n\nDon’t speak too quickly or slowly\n\nMake sure your nerves don’t make you monotone\n\nRemember to breathe and take a few sips of water if you need it.\n\n7. Ask for feedback\n\nThis’ll help salespeople feel invested in the process and like they have a say.\n\nTip: Not everyone likes sharing their thoughts in front of a room full of people so make sure you provide a more anonymous forum for them, too.\n\nRemember though, just because you ask for feedback doesn’t mean you have to act on it but if you don’t, be sure to thank the person anyway and explain why their comments aren’t being taken any further right now.\n\nHow to market a new product feature\n\nAfter endless meetings and hours of research, you’ve finally got confirmation feature X is coming soon. Fantastic. You already know how much it’s going to help your customers and why it puts you above your competition, but, do they?\n\nFor existing customers, it gives them a reason to stay, and for prospects, it gives them a reason to come. So, to make sure they’re all as excited about the feature as you are, you need a marketing strategy that covers all bases.\n\nIf your new feature’s going to revolutionize what you already offer, get people geared up for the announcement with some teaser messages.\n\nDon’t go too hard on this stage though – otherwise, you run the risk of wearing people down before the big day, just scheduling a post or two across your social media platforms will do. Here are a couple of ideas:\n\nA post outlining some of the benefits that come hand-in-hand with your new feature\n\nIf applicable, a picture or video of your new feature in action along with a “coming soon” message – something simple and intriguing like “Keep your eyes peeled, we’ve got an exciting announcement coming next week.”\n\nBehind the scenes, you’ll need to think about incorporating your new feature into any existing collateral, like:\n\nWebpages\n\nDedicated landing pages\n\nPPC text\n\nSocial media bios\n\nSales collateral\n\nProduct descriptions\n\nOffline collateral (brochures, flyers, etc.)\n\nThis bit doesn’t need to be too time-intensive and usually won’t require a full rewrite, but just think about how you can shout about its benefits and let people know it exists.\n\nYou don’t want to put this live before launch day, but if you get it drafted and approved ahead of time it’s then at least ready to be switched over straight away.\n\nEmail your database\n\nExisting customers\n\nMake sure you don’t let the prospect of new sales distract you from communicating your improvements with existing customers.\n\nAlthough they might not bring more revenue in the short term if this new feature results in ongoing loyalty they’ll be the ones benefiting your bottom line in the long term.\n\nIn the run-up to or on the day of the release, schedule an email with important information like:\n\nWhat the new feature is\n\nHow it works\n\nHow it’ll benefit them\n\nWhere they can go for extra support\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of current customers, don’t forget to think about cross-selling opportunities; but also don’t bombard every single contact. To fit the criteria for cross-selling the person or company should:\n\nNot already have the product that’s now got the new feature\n\nAlready have a product or service with you that compliments this one\n\nAnd let them know you know they’re already a customer by opening with something like “We know you’ve already got our [insert product] and we thought you might find [insert product] useful, too…”\n\nProspects\n\nNow, this is the exciting bit. If someone was interested in your product in the past but didn’t take the plunge, this new feature could be the nudge over the sales line they needed.\n\nYou need to arm prospects with all the information you gave your existing customers as well as some important additions – so don’t try and take shortcuts with the same template:\n\nA general overview of the whole product\n\nWhy they should choose you over your competitors\n\nPricing\n\nTip: For a second stab at making sure everyone sees your announcement, consider mentioning it in your newsletters, too (if you send them).\n\nCreate a landing page\n\nBespoke landing pages are a great way to capture new leads and increase conversion rates. Start by making sure you’ve got all these elements on it:\n\nA catchy headline\n\nYour branding and logo\n\nA clear description of your product\n\nPersuasive USPs and benefits\n\nTop-quality, relevant pictures\n\nContact details\n\nAn actionable CTA\n\nOnce you’re happy with what you’ve got, this can be used in your email and social media (paid and organic) campaigns.\n\nSpread the word on social\n\nDifferent audiences are on different mediums, and, as we all know, there’s no guarantee your emails will be opened. So, to make sure your message reaches as many people as possible, plan some social media activity around your new feature.\n\nIf you can, it’s a good idea to create some custom, branded imagery to support your efforts, too. After all, this is all about your product.\n\nLast but not least, if you want to target specific clusters of people consider investing in a few paid social posts.\n\nPress release\n\nIt’s up to you to gauge whether or not a press release is worthwhile for your feature, but if it is, it could be a relatively easy and cost-effective way to get your name in some local and industry-specific publications.\n\nTip: Get some advice on how to write a newsworthy press release here.\n\nSigns your feature might be picked up by the press:\n\nIt’s environmentally friendly\n\nIt’s something no one’s done before\n\nIts benefits are groundbreaking\n\nTrain your sales team\n\nAnd finally, don’t forget to educate your sales reps on everything they need to know. After all, what use are great marketing emails if the prospect then reaches out to a sales rep who makes no mention of the new feature whatsoever?\n\nSo, get your teams in a room and arm them with things like:\n\nCore benefits of the new feature\n\nHow it works with the product’s existing features\n\nKey terms to use when talking about it\n\nIf it affects pricing, let them know how\n\nIt might also be worth knocking up a simple one-pager with all this information so they have it to refer to when they want, as much as they want.\n\nWhat is the product launch process?\n\nThe product launch process refers to the steps companies follow when taking a product to market.\n\nProcesses vary depending on factors such as product type, industry, level of investment, forecast ROI, and so on.\n\nTypically, the process involves:\n\nIdentifying and targeting segments\n\nDesigning product packaging\n\nDrafting slogans, taglines, and marketing campaigns\n\nConducting competitive analysis\n\nConsulting PR firms\n\nCreating a product sheet detailing the features of your product or service\n\nLaunching or updating company websites\n\nAdvertising the product\n\nPromoting the product in the media\n\nWhat are the different launch tactics?\n\nThere are three types of product launch tactics:\n\nNew value creation: These grow your company’s revenue streams and are new products or features that further address your customer’s needs.\n\nMaintenance and support releases: These releases are focused on preserving the revenue of your products that’re already on the market. You need to make sure that you make continuous changes to your offering to ensure that customer expectations are being met.\n\nInternal product releases: Though these releases aren’t public facing, this doesn’t mean they’re less important than new value creation or maintenance and support releases. They support the day-to-day running of your product.\n\nHow can I introduce my product online?\n\nWhen you’re launching a product online, you need to complete five essential steps:\n\nResearch your competitors\n\nUnderstand your audience\n\nEngage in product storytelling\n\nWrite a marketing plan\n\nLaunch your product\n\nHow do you write a new product announcement?\n\n1) Know your audience\n\nIt’s essential to understand who the audience is that you’re catering to. The tone of your messaging will be dictated by the age of your audience, where they’re from, their interests, and so on. It’s fundamental to get this spot on – failing to do so will see your announcement fall short.\n\n2) Be succinct\n\nKeep things simple and be succinct in your approach. Adopt a simple approach, and start your announcement by simply telling the audience you’re releasing a new product. Never go into full sales mode from the offset – you can adopt this stance in the later stages of your announcement.\n\n3) Describe the product\n\nUnsurprisingly, your audience will need to know what they’d be getting if they were to invest in your product.\n\nOutline the key USPs and main benefits. Don’t overcomplicate things – you need to make sure the audience identifies with why your product could be beneficial to them and meet their needs. Emphasize what they’ll accomplish, should they decide to invest.\n\n4) Call to action\n\nEnd the announcement with a rallying call that’ll entice your prospective buyer to put their hand in their pocket and buy the product.\n\nWhat is a product launch checklist?\n\nA product launch checklist refers to all of the steps a company needs to complete when releasing a new product.\n\nOverseeing a new product launch is tough, but it forms a huge part of your role as a product marketer.\n\nGranted, there may be times when tight deadlines leave you tearing your hair out, or poor planning and avoidable errors can frustrate you, but there’s an easy solution that’ll see you and your team over the line and keep key stakeholders happy: A watertight product launch formula – and we’re gonna tell you how to put it into action.\n\nWhat are new product launch essentials?\n\nAs part of any product launch, certain things are indispensable as you and your team strive for success: Customer development, positioning and messaging, internal communication, effective planning, great content, and awesome team morale.\n\nCustomer development\n\nCustomer development is a term relating to understanding your customer.\n\nAny great product launch is built on the knowledge you have about your customers; the more you know about them, the more equipped you are to launch a product that’s likely to tick all the boxes and address their pain points.\n\nThere’s an abundance of customer and market research tools designed to help you learn more about your prospective buyers – don’t put them to waste! Use them, delve into the data, (qualitative, quantitative – or both), identify trends, and act on bonafide customer needs.\n\nPositioning and messaging\n\nThis stage of a new product launch is based on three essential questions: Who is this product for? What does the product do? And most importantly, why is your product different?\n\nTo start with, familiarize yourself with these key terms:\n\nTarget: Prospective customers you’re hoping will buy your product\n\nSegment: A defined group of people who have a particular attribute that makes your product or service attractive\n\nBrand: The name of your product\n\nCategory: A competitive frame for the target audience. Consider who it is you’ll be competing against and think of a way to make your option more appealing\n\nUSP: This is your unique selling point; what do you have that the competition doesn’t?\n\nProof: Hard evidence to back up your claims\n\nWhen you’re positioning your product and constructing your messaging, don’t just tell your customers what features are included as part of the package – they can find this information out for themselves. Explain why these features are going to make their lives easier, and why they should invest.\n\nInternal communication\n\nThere’s no room for keeping secrets when you’re planning a new product launch; you need to be sure everyone contributing to the process is aware of your positioning, so communicate internally to align expectations.\n\nBuilding customer relationships is essential, but internal teams also need to be pulling in the same direction and excited by the prospect of the new product launch, and if this means popping on a pot of freshly brewed coffee and doing overtime to build your bank of internal advocates, then so be it.\n\nPlan ahead\n\nProduct launches at big and small companies are planned to precision, and the same principle must apply to you.\n\nSpeak with multiple teams and pick their brains for ideas, before considering A) the impact each idea will have on the launch, B) whether you think the idea is feasible, and C) if you did include it in the launch, how easy would it be to test its effectiveness?\n\nPlanning allows you and your team to put contingencies in place to navigate any curve balls that may come your way. The process can be stressful enough as it is, so why make things harder for yourself?\n\nCarefully map content\n\nThere are plenty of content and opps tools to help you create material that’ll make your competitors green with envy.\n\nRemember, these will be the assets you’ll be using on the big day and form a critical part of your product launch plan, so don’t skimp on the details – they’re a big deal. There’s nothing worse than working tirelessly for weeks, sometimes months on end, only to let yourself down with mediocre assets to accompany your launch.\n\nAlways make sure content is relevant and measurable. Data and insights are invaluable when you’re launching a product, as they’ll essentially tell you if your product launch has been a resounding success or a terrible flop.\n\nAlso, never be afraid to tease your audience and give them hints about what’s to come when putting together your content plan.\n\nMaintain team morale\n\nInternal communication is the glue that holds any product launch plan together. If teams in the company are none the wiser, how can you possibly be expected to execute your launch to perfection?\n\nWhen you're holding meetings, consider holding multiple sessions in which you can tailor your agenda to each relevant group of people.\n\nFor example, if you’re discussing sales enablement with the sales team, you don’t need non-sales staff there with you – their attention will wander and your big day could suffer as a consequence.\n\nKeep your team motivated and keep calm; if you start to wobble, your panic will be noticeable and it can easily rub off on other members of the team.\n\n11 tips on influencing and organizing launches\n\nInfluencing organizations and stakeholders to stick to your timelines is no easy feat. Everyone’s got their priorities and KPIs and convincing them to make time for yours too can be testing.\n\nIf you’re reading this though, take solace in that you’re not alone and hopefully, these 11 tips will help you shake up that internal shift and make your next project less taxing.\n\n1. Paint the bigger picture\n\nWhether it’s targeting a new audience to gain more of the market share, adding a new feature to retain more clients, or creating a whole new product to add another revenue stream, in theory, everything you do should be tied to an overarching business goal.\n\nThat in itself is your in, but it’s on you to explain how project X, Y, or Z is going to achieve that, and usually, being specific and data-driven is the best way. We know we’re oversimplifying it here but take a look at these two approaches:\n\nApproach 1:\n\n“We’re doing this because we’ve been targeted with reducing churn by 5% in the next quarter.”\n\nApproach 2:\n\n“We’ve been targeted with reducing churn by 5% next quarter and our research and data shows us 55% of churned users currently leave because we don’t have feature Y.\n\nThe interviews we’ve conducted with lost customers tell us 80% of them would have stayed if we added this feature already, so we are confident completing this project will directly correlate with a lower churn rate and $XXXX more in company revenue.”\n\nThe second is unarguably more compelling and it’d be pretty darn hard for anyone to turn that away, which leads us nicely into our next point…\n\n2. Link it to their objectives\n\nIn a dream world, our first tip is enough to get everyone bought in. The reality is that’s not always the case though. Everyone’s got their objectives and if people have got to-do lists as long as their arm, justifying taking their eye off one of their balls to focus on yours can be… tricky.\n\nSo, if you can, find a way to tie your objectives into theirs. For example, for sales, a new feature might make it considerably easier to close deals which would directly correlate with their new business targets. For IT, it might mean a reduction in tickets. For customer service, it could be fewer inbound calls.\n\n“Position the launch in the context of what’s in it for them and the greater impact of the business to get buy-in. Then, help them understand the driving reasons behind the deadlines; as a product marketing manager (PMM), you are perfectly suited to highlight the why behind deadlines [e.g. business impact, cross-functional partner needs, etc].”\n\nSapphire Reels, Director of Product Marketing at Atlassian\n\nMore often than not, there’ll always be a way to intertwine the two so take the time to work out what that connection is and then tailor your pitch to hone in on it. For this reason, it might be worth splitting your approach by department.\n\n3. Segment your briefs and plans\n\nAs product marketers, we spend a lot of time segmenting a market and customers to get optimal results, so take that principle and apply it to internal stakeholders too. There are a few benefits to doing this:\n\nAs we just touched on, you can position your project and requirements in a way that resonates with what matters most to each department/stakeholder. Because they will all care more and less about different things\n\nYou can dedicate your time to them focusing solely on the facts that matter to them. Let’s be honest, we’ve all begrudgingly been in one of those 45-minute meetings where only five minutes of it have been relevant to us. It doesn’t engage people and in the long run, they’ll probably just stop turning up. So, instead of having one big meeting with everyone, consider setting up two or three shorter ones with individual departments.\n\nDon’t stop your segmentation there though and if you’re building an internal roadmap, consider splitting them up too.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause if you create a catch-all roadmap for sales, engineering, marketing, etc. you run the risk of diluting each’s tasks and responsibilities and people not paying attention to what they should be focusing on. If sales don’t need to know about a software migration IT will be doing in week five don’t bother them with it – and vice versa.\n\nThe simpler and easier you make everything to digest, take, and act on, the more likely you are to get the results you’re after.\n\n“Create clarity for stakeholders over what is and isn't a launch blocker, as well as who owns what. This helps spread not just responsibility, but accountability.\n\n\"It also makes the launch a shared win, instead of PMMs or PMs win. Launch teams sink or swim, together! I find that a simple one-pager that divides the launch into key initiatives (e.g. legal, campaign, comms + PR) and assigns cross-functional owners, can help with this.”\n\nKatherine Brittain, Director of Product Marketing at Monzo\n\n4. Bring them into the process\n\nThere’s a theory in psychology called the IKEA effect which essentially says labor leads to love – i.e. if people help build something they’re more likely to like it than if it came pre-made. Well, the same concept can be applied to things that aren’t physical – like your plans and strategies.\n\nPeople don’t like feeling left out or sheltered from discussions and decisions that impact them, and if they are, they’re more likely to be adverse to what comes next. So, bring your peers into the process early on, let them have a level of control, and just watch how much more passionate they become about the result.\n\n“The greatest help here is this: Get people to be part of the plan creation. Set the goal, paint the north star, and then build the plan WITH them. When they have helped build the plan, with their input and expertise, they are more likely to want to see it come to fruition. Don't just make the plan and throw it at them, build it together as a team.”\n\nRJ Gazarek, Principal Product Marketing Manager at SolarWinds\n\n5. Think about who you’re talking to\n\nDifferent people have different personalities and factoring these into your delivery can take the impact of what you’re saying to a whole new level. For example, if you know Sam from sales loves a good data-driven presentation, give it to him. If Carol from customer service prefers more of a story outlining the customer’s journey and perspective, try to give that to her, too.\n\nFor this exact reason, more and more companies are investing in workplace personality assessments – to help individuals and teams better communicate with one another. There are tons of really robust paid versions out there but if you want to test the waters, here are 14 free personality testing tools.\n\n6. Be specific\n\nAvoid being loose with what you’re after and when by. If you need task A completed by Jan 10th put that deadline on the individual and don’t give them any reason to be able to wiggle out of it on a technicality. Document it, share it, and remind them of it.\n\nTip: If it’s a long-running project, to prevent it from falling off other people’s radar, you could do something as simple as circulating an up-to-date version of each department’s roadmap, say, weekly or biweekly. This’ll take a matter of minutes and should serve as a regular prompt and keep others from forgetting their role.\n\nAs well as that, if someone’s deadline’s looming don’t leave it until the day of to ask for it. If you do and they’ve not done it, you’ve no chance of sticking to your timings. Instead, set a reminder in your diary to check in a few days before with a friendly nudge like:\n\n“Hey, I’m just checking in to see if we’re all on track for the delivery of [insert task] by [insert date]? Let me know if you need anything else from me.”\n\nAgain, it doesn’t take long at your end and will hopefully stop things from slipping.\n\n“Get face time with people to communicate the importance of collaboration. It helps to define exactly what's needed and why. Do your side of the work before you approach other teams – this may be a detailed plan, the what and why piece, and how it affects this individual. People appreciate when you acknowledge this may not be their core but that their support is crucial.”\n\nKirti Sharma, Director of Product Marketing at Adobe\n\n7. Incorporate feedback\n\nNow it goes without saying you can’t include everyone’s feedback, but if people take the time to give their input they like to know they’ve been heard. This one’s pretty simple but if you:\n\nInclude their feedback, let them know, and thank them for the idea; or\n\nDon’t include their suggestion, let them know the rationale behind the why, and still thank them.\n\nThis all just ties back to being transparent and seen to value other people’s time and efforts – and we don’t need to tell you being a product marketer requires tip-top interpersonal skills.\n\n“Get everyone's feedback and opinions and put them in three buckets:\n\n1) Desirable. Great idea! It's a feature our clients will need in the future. Let's add it to the product roadmap.\n\n2) Feasible. Yes, it can be done in this sprint.\n\n3) Viable. This one is going to contribute to our long-term sustainability and growth. Let's add this to our product backlog.\n\nThis way everyone, even outside the PMM team, feels heard, accountable, and empowered. It's a great exercise for PMM to gather some outsider's perspective.”\n\nPuja Shah, Sr. Marketing Programs Manager at whiz.ai\n\n8. Keep people up to speed\n\nSticking with the transparency theme, make a point of keeping people in the loop and try to pencil something into everyone’s diary to make sure they commit to your catch-ups.\n\n“In the words of our CMO, ‘over-communicate.’ It’s a great principle to use pre-launch as it forces you to stay in touch with your peers and people you need help from.”\n\nSean Broderick, Director of GTM & Product Marketing at Sitecore\n\nRemember, though:\n\nThese don’t have to be long. Short and sweet is generally best and it might be something as simple as a ten-minute huddle every Friday morning.\n\nBe flexible. Things change so don’t see your communication plan as set in stone and have contingency plans for if something doesn’t work out. For example, if a key stakeholder isn’t able to make it one week, could you record the meeting and email it? Or take notes to share? Or invite another representative from their team? There’ll always be another way.\n\nDon’t just be open about the positives. If people need to know about the negatives be upfront but just position them in a constructive way that doesn’t result in loss of confidence.\n\nTo make sure your catch-ups don’t derail and turn into a platform for people to vent or ask specific questions that could or should happen one-on-one or behind closed doors, send the invite out with a brief overview and agenda.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"Hi all,\n\nJust putting this in your diary to schedule weekly catch-ups around Project Z. Here’s the agenda:\n\n1. Product marketing to give a status update.\n\n2. Sales to give an update on deliverables.\n\n3. Sales to outline any new barriers.\n\nIf you have any questions or issues outside of this, please come and speak to me separately before or after the meeting.\"\n\n9. Prepare for objections\n\nIs there anything less reassuring than when you ask someone a question and they’re visibly unable to answer it? Don’t fall into that trap.\n\nIt’s natural for people to have objections, but just make sure you explore them before you go into a meeting so you’re able to confidently answer them on the spot and shut down the opportunity for uncertainty – once you lose morale it can be tough to get back.\n\n10. Know the numbers\n\nTo expand on our loss of confidence point, make sure you’ve got key numbers at the tip of your tongue throughout and use them where you can to make your updates easier to understand.\n\nFor example:\n\n“We’ve migrated 45% of existing customers to the new platform.”\n\nSounds better and more credible than:\n\n“We’ve started migrating some customers over to the new platform.”\n\nNo one’s going to sue you for not having a memory that hoards and regurgitates 25+ stats on command, but if you’ve not got them in your head, have them on paper so you can easily refer to and use them as and when needed.\n\n11. Make it visual\n\nVisuals and stories are much easier to remember than a reel of numbers so incorporate them as and where you can – it’s pretty much guaranteed that people will retain more of what you tell them.\n\nIf you’re turning your data into visuals just remember to:\n\nKeep them simple. If a standard pie chart will do it don’t go using a fancy alternative for the sake of it, and\n\nDon’t use words where you don’t need to. Your charts are visual aids and don’t need an in-depth explanation surrounding them.\n\nIt’s probably worth sharing these kinds of things post-meeting too so people can refer to them as and when they want and you get less of those “have you got” requests.\n\nFinally, keep the visual element front of mind when you’re drawing up your roadmaps, too. The aim isn’t to showboat with an overly technical and complicated plan, it’s to make the document as easy as is humanly possible to follow, understand, and update.\n\n“Ensure that you communicate clearly and efficiently. Avoid using technical terminology that is not understood by all and keep it simple.”\n\nMalaz Idris, Product Marketing Lead at Emergn\n\n9 things to remember for your next internal product launch\n\nInternal communication plans are integral to the success of any new product or feature. But, with so much going on getting external launches prepared, making final tweaks, and chasing looming deadlines, they don’t always get the TLC they need.\n\nSo, whether you’re looking for ways to communicate your message better, increase adoption, improve your support set-up, or get everyone bought in, here are nine tips to help with all four.\n\n1. Knowledge is power\n\nMake sure you’re feeding the right people with the right information. It might sound obvious but it can still get missed.\n\nNot enough information will leave people unprepared but overloading them can get them flustered. For example, does everyone need an in-depth understanding of your ongoing lead generation and marketing campaigns? Sales, marketing, and product, yes, but IT? Probably not.\n\nThat’s not to say you have to keep that kind of detail from them completely, but strengthen the uptake of the information you do give them by not sandwiching it in between all the irrelevant bits.\n\nTip: If you’re not confident you’re providing people with everything they need, ask them… which ties nicely to our next point.\n\n2. Ask people what they want\n\nSome product marketers have a great internal set-up where they, product, and sales get on like a house on fire… others don’t. It still applies to both scenarios, but if you’ve got friction with other departments letting them take a bit of the lead might help.\n\nThat doesn’t mean it’s a case of they say “jump” and you say “How high?”, but instead of just telling them “You’ll get this type of training on this day,” ask them what works best for them.\n\nDo morning or afternoon slots suit you better?\n\nWould they prefer in-person training or offline documents?\n\nDoes anyone need a bit of one-to-one support?\n\nIs there anything they think could be improved from the last internal product launch?\n\nIt’ll shift the dynamic and show them you’re working together.\n\n3. Timing is everything\n\nMany people don’t like things being sprung on them last minute – especially stuff that directly impacts them. We’re not saying you have to involve every department in every stage, but if you’re discussing something today that’ll impact your customer support team in ten weeks, let them know about it sooner rather than later.\n\nIt’ll give them time to prepare, allow you to iron out any concerns that might arise, and make for a smoother journey all around.\n\nTip: If you’re not already, remember to bring key heads in from these departments when ideas are in the concept stage. Not only will it enrich their buy-in, but it’ll likely result in a stronger, more well-thought-out product full-stop.\n\n4. Tell them how it benefits them\n\nBe specific with your benefits, because every new product or feature will mean something different to each department.\n\nExample: Let’s say you’re a financial services company and you’re launching a new app that enables customers to apply for credit, update their details, check their credit score, and speak to an advisor via live chat.\n\nAs much as we wish they were, your goals aren’t always aligned with other teams’, so, by showing how yours helps theirs, you’ll increase business-wide engagement and the overall success of the launch.\n\n5. Variety is key\n\nEveryone digests information differently so prepare a few types of collateral, like:\n\nOne-page flyers\n\nProduct brochures\n\nVideos\n\nPresentations\n\nEmails\n\nPosters\n\nMeetings\n\nAll seven might be a bit much so if you’re not sure which would work best, going back to point two: Just ask. Different departments might be more receptive to different styles too, so remember to factor that into your plans.\n\nDon’t forget to make it all accessible. Whether you’ve got one or six products in your portfolio, it’s a good idea to store all your collateral in a single place for everyone to access when they want – like a folder in your drive or an internal intranet system, for example. This’ll:\n\nGive everyone autonomy to refresh themselves as and when they want\n\nEnable teams to train recruits themselves\n\nReduce the number of people coming to you asking for X, Y, or Z\n\nIt doesn’t need to be anything complicated, a simple file structure like this would do:\n\nNew products\n\nPersonal banking app\n\nInternal collateral\n\nOne-page flier\n\nPresentation recording\n\nBrochure\n\nVideos\n\n6. Look at your language\n\nJust because you know what something means it doesn’t mean your sales, customer service, or IT teams do, and if they struggle your customers have got no chance.\n\nSo, before you send any emails or hand out any collateral go through it all and check:\n\nIt’s not got any jargon only you and your team use, and\n\nIt’s not full of marketing lingo. Keep it simple and focus on the key messages and information its recipients need to take away.\n\nTip: To make sure nothing’s gone unnoticed, pass your collateral onto someone in the business (outside of your department) with a fresh pair of eyes and ask them to flag anything that trips them up.\n\n7. Empower people\n\nOne surefire way to get people bought in is to empower them and there are a couple of ways you can go about this.\n\nIdea #1\n\nIf you’re planning on running a training session with your sales team, instead of someone from the product marketing team hosting it, get someone from the sales department too. Rightly or wrongly, having “one of their own” presenting it can make some people more receptive.\n\nTo maintain some control and ensure accuracy, just be sure to send someone from your team to oversee the session and answer any questions.\n\nIdea #2\n\nOkay, so this one might need buy-in from someone more senior first, but, if you can, put some of the KPIs onto other teams.\n\nIf nothing before this has worked (which it should have!) we’re confident this one will because it directly impacts their numbers and departmental success.\n\nSticking with the personal banking example, although you might have an overarching adoption goal for existing customers, you could divide that goal up and put X amount on the customer service team, Y amount on your customer comms team, Z amount on the marketing team and some on yourself, of course.\n\nBut remember, it’s not a case of dumping a target on their desk and scarpering. You still play a pivotal role in helping them hit those KPIs.\n\n8. Don’t launch and run\n\nKeep you and your team visible and make sure everyone who could need help knows you’re on hand to support them by:\n\nReminding them you’re around for questions or extra guidance – a simple email would do\n\nRunning an internal incentive campaign – this could be a bit of fun, like a quiz or game, or a prize for the first person to achieve X conversions\n\nAsking sales and customer service teams how they’re getting on, what kind of feedback they’re hearing, and whether or not they think improvements could be made\n\n9. Do a practice run\n\nIn the words of Neil Patel:\n\n“When you rehearse the launch process, you ameliorate a significant risk. If you expect your launch to be successful, you must control the features of the launch that are within your control.”\n\nA successful product launch hinges on a well-executed practice run. It's all about controlling what you can in advance. This rehearsal isn't just a formality; it's a vital part of the launch process, ensuring every team member, from production to sales and management, is fully prepared and in sync.\n\nBy practicing, you transform potential chaos into coordinated precision, turning every involved individual into an integral part of a seamless launch. This preparation is the key to a launch that's not just good, but great.\n\nTips to ensure a successful product launch\n\nLaunching a new brand or product can be an exciting time. It’s a chance to show off your vision, make a splash, and get people talking about your company. But it isn’t always a smooth process.\n\nAccording to research from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately:\n\n20% of new businesses fail during the first two years of being open,\n\n45% during the first five years,\n\n65% during the first ten years, and\n\nOnly 25% of new businesses make it to 15 years or more.\n\nIf you want to maximize your chances of success, some key areas should be sufficiently developed before a launch.\n\nKnow your audience\n\nEnsure you understand your target audience. After all, these are the people that’ll be buying your product. So, you need to identify:\n\nTarget demographic information (age, income, location, etc)\n\nChallenges they face and how they’ll benefit from your product\n\nWhat your product can offer them that competing products don’t\n\nWhat they like, what similar products the majority purchase, etc.\n\nHow they respond to certain marketing techniques\n\nWhere their community is, and how they’re going to find out about your product\n\nDevelop a strong go-to-market (GTM) strategy\n\nA solid GTM strategy’s essential for a successful product launch and can be used to improve team collaboration. It’s used as a way for an organization to bring a product to market and touches on three core components:\n\nYour target audience\n\nYour marketing plan\n\nYour sales strategy\n\nEvery product and business is different, meaning that the GTM strategy changes along with it, so you need to ensure that your entire team’s on the same page.\n\nMarket, market, market!\n\nIf you don’t market your product effectively, how will it reach your target audience? You need to ensure that you’re marketing before, during, and after the launch process, to reach the maximum amount of attention for your product.\n\nHere are some key things to consider with your marketing:\n\nCreate an email list before launching your product so you can communicate with your customers throughout the process.\n\nCreate a social media plan – your customers need to know what to expect from you once you go live. Consider using tools like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter to promote your launch, depending on your demographic’s most commonly used community.\n\nPost about your launch on your company blog. This way, you’re driving traffic and engagement toward your organization and product.\n\nLaunch products at the optimal time\n\nIf you launch too soon, your brand will be seen as new and unproven. If you launch too late, you won’t get much attention.\n\nYou need to determine when would be the best time to launch your product to receive the most engagement with your target customer base. Product launch metrics will help you identify the right time for putting your product on the market.\n\nBe prepared, patient, and don’t rush\n\nIt takes time to build awareness, and you don’t want to make avoidable mistakes by rushing through the process.\n\nCreate checklists to ensure you’re meeting all the goals you and your company have set and be prepared for any wrenches in your plans by acknowledging potential challenges and how to overcome them.\n\nLaunch messaging\n\nMessaging is the guiding force for everything you do in your product launch. What your product brings to the table, who it is for, why they care, and how they can help them accomplish their goals.\n\nYou can lay out the new product messaging in several formats but if you keep it simple, to a single page it works better for all your internal stakeholders who need to review, approve, and use it in their efforts of content, demand gen programs, and AR/PR.\n\nPro tip: Take a close look at all the great features in the new product, reviewing slides, documents, and info sessions with your product team. Get a demo or see a mockup if it is ready. Boil it down to a top-level message, and a few themes that support it.\n\nDo some research as to how the market is talking about it, how competitors are positioning it if any, and how partners might be approaching it from their POV.\n\nLaunch messaging: single-page summary\n\nWhat is the new product or feature about?\n\nLaunch the main message. A one-liner about the new product or set of capabilities, supported by three to five launch themes\n\nLaunch abstract. 50–70 words describing the launch key message and themes\n\nWho is the new product launch for?\n\nICP — ideal customer profile. Customer size (strategic, enterprise, mid-market, SMB), customer journeys/use cases that this new product applies to, customer geos/verticals, etc.\n\nBuyer Personas. From C-level to VP/Director to practitioners/users. IT and Line of Business as relevant\n\nWhy does the buyer care about this new product?\n\nBusiness and technology challenges (or pain points) for your buyer from the C-suite down to the practitioner\n\nHow does your product solve buyers’ pain points?\n\nKey features/capabilities of the product\n\nHow does each feature or subset map to a customer benefit? Benefits could be monetary (increased revenue, a new line of business, lower costs, etc.) or efficiency (improved productivity, enhanced collaboration, faster time to market, etc.)\n\nPress release headline\n\nIs your new product industry’s #1 in a market category, or most comprehensive, etc.? This is especially important if you’re trying to create a new category or improve your differentiation within a crowded market\n\nGo for a swagger statement but with proof points and features that support it\n\nLaunch goals and program management\n\nConsider using a RACI or DACI framework to get the messaging finalized.\n\nDriver: Product Marketing\n\nApprover: GM / BU Leader, CEO, etc.\n\nContributor: Product Management\n\nInformed: AR, PR, Program Management, Demand Gen, Content Marketing, etc.\n\nPro tip: Product marketing can lead a launch kickoff meeting in collaboration with program management, inviting internal stakeholders and the launch team.\n\nKeep it short but the idea is to get everyone on the same page with your single-page messaging doc and get them pumped up on the upcoming launch.\n\nYour launch goals may very well be determined by the scope of the product but also by your overall GTM strategy. As part of your launch plan, determine the key objectives and metrics of your launch along with these areas:\n\nHighlight tech innovation, vision, and leadership — drive awareness and adoption\n\nShowcase your product vis-à-vis your partner’s — drive joint GTM\n\nFocus on early adopter customers — drive upsell and cross-sell motions\n\nConnect your product to new buyers’ journeys — drive new logo acquisition\n\nPro tip: As soon as you have your launch plan down, run it by our internal stakeholders and launch team to get their buy-in, and their feedback incorporated. This helps set up cross-functional teams for success.\n\nWhich areas among the above are you doing well, which ones are you hitting out of the ballpark, and which ones need work? How do your stakeholders feel about it?\n\nProduct launch + sales\n\nHelping your salespeople to adapt to change\n\nA product launch isn't just about creating buzz and excitement; it's also a significant exercise in change management. This is particularly true for sales teams, who often face the challenge of adapting to new products and strategies.\n\nStatistics indicate a high percentage of sales leaders believe their teams struggle with adapting to change. While it might be easy to misinterpret this as a lack of competence, the real issue often lies in the approach to change management. Marketing teams can get caught up in the immediate excitement of a launch – the press mentions, social media buzz, and event planning. However, this focus can lead to neglecting the essential aspect of preparing sales teams for the change.\n\nSalespeople aren’t just selling a product; they're guiding prospects through a mental model shift. A new product launch can disrupt this process. It's not necessarily a matter of sales reps being unable to handle change, but rather that the launch strategy may not align with their existing sales processes. The key is to integrate the benefits of the new product into the sales teams' current strategies and customer interactions.\n\nIn the competitive SaaS industry, where new launches are frequent, product marketers must focus less on the allure of the new product and more on how it fits into the existing sales enablement, playbooks, and mental models of sales reps.\n\nThe success of a product launch should be measured not just by its initial impact but by how well it integrates into and enhances ongoing customer relationships and sales strategies.\n\nIn that sense, the challenge isn't just about managing a product launch but also about effectively molding the launch to fit within the existing frameworks that sales teams are comfortable with. This approach ensures that the launch isn’t just a fleeting moment of excitement but a sustainable addition to the sales process, enhancing the overall strategy and customer engagement.\n\nSales enablement advice\n\nSales enablement plays a pivotal role in the success of product launches. Launches involve coordinating multiple aspects, including business strategy, product strategy, and market dynamics, all while considering the varying capabilities of your sales team.\n\nThere's often a disparity in performance among sales reps, and a launch can highlight this gap. The challenge lies in enabling the entire team to effectively understand and promote the new product or feature.\n\nEnablement isn’t just about introducing a new product or feature and leaving the reps to figure it out. It's about systematic education and support. The aim is to level the playing field, ensuring that all reps, not just the top performers, are equipped to understand and sell the new offering. This involves creating and enforcing specific sales plays that’re aligned with the launch.\n\nBeyond just explaining what the new product or feature does, it's crucial to emphasize its relevance and urgency. This is what drives the success of sales plays in the field. A common reason for the failure of launches is the lack of translation of features into value, and more importantly, why that value is relevant to the customer at this moment.\n\nFor instance, in the cybersecurity field, the current threat of nation-state actors makes certain features more relevant. By framing the conversation around the immediate need and relevance, sales reps, even new ones, can effectively engage customers and generate meaningful pipelines.\n\nHow to build an effective relationship with sales leadership\n\nBuilding an effective relationship with sales leadership is vital for successful product launches.\n\nThe impact of enablement largely depends on the support and involvement of the sales leadership team. Sales reps often look to their managers for guidance, so if these leaders aren't well-informed or onboard with the launch, it can hinder the process.\n\nNavigating the dynamics of the sales hierarchy requires a strategic approach, tailored to the size and culture of your company. In larger organizations, it's crucial to demonstrate how your launch aligns with broader corporate initiatives or goals. Leveraging company-wide objectives as a way to gain support can be effective.\n\nIn smaller companies, the process can be more straightforward. You can directly approach the VP of Sales and frame the launch in terms of how it will help reps meet their quotas more efficiently. The focus here is on making the launch relevant and beneficial for the sales team.\n\nAn even more compelling approach is to tie the launch to deeper customer value outcomes. The best sales managers aim for the success of not just their sales reps but also their customers. Showing how the new product or feature will benefit customers can be a powerful motivator.\n\nThe chosen tactic should be based on the size of your company, its culture, and the stage of growth it's in. Understanding these factors and tailoring your approach accordingly can help forge a stronger and more effective relationship with sales leadership, ultimately contributing to the success of your product launch.\n\nHow to build on post-launch wins\n\nBuilding on post-launch wins is a crucial part of maintaining momentum and maximizing the impact of a product launch.\n\nIn product marketing management, there's often a tendency to create numerous content and assets and simply hand them over to sales teams. However, this approach can lead to information overload, with most reps forgetting the guidance provided, which means both training and coaching in the sales enablement process are key.\n\nThere are two essential aspects to this: The push and the pull. On the pull side, a powerful tactic is to highlight and publicize successful deal wins. When sales reps share their success stories – detailing how they used specific strategies and messaging to close deals – it lends much more credibility than if the same information came directly from product marketers.\n\nThese real-world examples not only validate the strategies but also provide insights into opportunities and gaps that may not have been apparent at launch. Learning from the field is invaluable in refining and improving ongoing strategies.\n\nOn the push side, it's important to ensure that sales reps are accurately recording the plays and methodologies they use in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. This data allows sales managers to coach their teams effectively and address any reluctance to adopt certain approaches.\n\nSharing deal wins is a particularly effective strategy. It not only dispels skepticism but also fosters a bit of healthy competition among sales reps. In the sales environment, where competition can be a strong motivator, celebrating these wins can drive others to replicate that success.\n\nThe secret to successful launches\n\nThe key to successful product launches lies in having a unified definition of success across all teams. Without this shared understanding, there's a risk of disappointment post-launch, as different teams may have varying expectations of the outcomes.\n\nFor PMMs, it's essential to establish clear objectives for the launch and ensure that everyone is aligned with these goals. Sometimes, this might involve making tough decisions or setting expectations that a launch might not directly impact sales, and that's perfectly acceptable. What's important is that everyone involved is aware of this and isn’t measuring success by the wrong metric.\n\nIf the primary objective is to drive sales, then it's crucial to focus on substantive strategies rather than just creating hype. This means working closely with sales reps, understanding their needs, and tailoring your positioning and messaging to ensure they are fully equipped at the time of launch.\n\nAchieving consensus on what success looks like can be challenging, but it's the responsibility of the launch owner to steer this alignment. The most smoothly executed launches, and those that leave teams most satisfied afterward, are those where this alignment has been successfully achieved.\n\nClear, shared goals not only guide the launch efforts but also set the stage for evaluating its success cohesively and realistically.\n\nReady to take things up a notch?\n\nLaunching successful products sits at the heart of the product marketing role, so much so, that over 80% of PMMs identify product launches as a core element of their role.\n\nMaster go-to-market strategy, deliver unassailable launches, and ascend the product marketing ranks with Go-to-Market Certified: Masters.\n\nGo-to-Market Certified features everything you need to consolidate your knowledge of key GTM principles and understand how this bread-and-butter deliverable works.\n\nCompleting this course will help you:\n\n🚀 Execute successful product/feature/market launches\n\n💡 Own GTM strategies at companies large and small\n\n🎯 Understand GTM tactics during pre-launch, hard-launch and post-launch phases\n\n🤝 Keep products on the market by effectively owning the full customer cycle\n\n🧠 Confidently and effectively project manage the whole GTM cycle cross-functionally"
