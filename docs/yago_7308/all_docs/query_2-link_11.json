        "text": "Orlando, FL— The Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra Board of Directors announces, after extensive discussions, that it has begun the search for a new Music Director for its 59th season, following the resignation of Andrew Lane (1) in August 2014. Lane, who served the FSYO as Music Director since 1998, started in 1994 as conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra. In 1998, he was promoted to Music Director and conductor of the Symphonic (senior-level) Orchestra – with a two-year leave between the 2005 and 2007 seasons (2). Lane will continue to lead the program through FSYO's 58th season ending in May 2015.\n\nUnder Lane's direction, the Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra has expanded the breadth of its musical repertoire and tested the skills of its ever-expanding student base. Other notable accomplishments of FSYO, under the musical direction of Maestro Lane, include: an Australian tour in 2008, including a performance at the Sydney Opera House; a performance with celebrity violinist Nadja Solerno-Sonnenberg at the Bob Carr Performing Arts Theater; and the addition of the full orchestra, Prelude, creating 3 full orchestras and 1 beginning strings ensemble.\n\nMost recently, Lane helped to complete construction of The Grove at Mead Gardens and endowed the Andrew Lane Scholarship to support the continued education of aspiring students in our community.\n\nThe board is deeply grateful to Maestro Lane for his significant contributions and service throughout his notable career with the organization. We believe his passion for music and relentless focus on student engagement have established FSYO as a leader in the Central Florida Arts Community. President of FSYO Board of Directors, Stephen Schenck states:\n\n\"Mr. Lane has been the heart and soul of FSYO for nearly two decades. His impact on the community is measured by the thousands of students who have been a part of the FSYO family, and individually in each student who received his lessons of professionalism, striving to perform to your best abilities and hard work towards achievement, that came in each rehearsal. He has always brought joy to these young students.\"\n\nThe board will remain actively engaged with the administration of the organization during this transition and has already taken steps in the new Music Director search. FSYO's daily operations, including its rehearsals and concert commitments will continue as scheduled without interruption.\n\nAndrew Lane believes music is an essential part of a young person's education. Through the principles of \"teach, challenge, and encourage,\" FSYO musicians are inspired to take their talents to new heights that ensure music will always be an important part of their lives. Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra musicians are the future of classical music.\n\n(1) http://www.fsyo.org/index.php/about-us/historic-info\n\n(2) http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-04-22/entertainment/0504210495_1_youth-orchestra-symphonic-orchestra-andrew-lane\n\nAbout: The Florida Symphony Youth Orchestra aims to educate and inspire Central Florida's top young musicians through programs committed to strengthening musical talents and developing appreciation of the arts through classical music. The FSYO, in its 58th Concert Season, comprises three full orchestras, one string training orchestra and various chamber groups, made up of more than 250 students from eight Central Florida counties, including Orange, Osceola, Lee, Seminole, Brevard, Lake, Highlands and Volusia. Programs are sponsored in part by the Florida Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs; the Florida Council on Arts and Culture; Darden Restaurant Foundation; The Central Florida Foundation; Universal Orlando Foundation; and United Arts of Central Florida. We thank these groups for their generous support."
