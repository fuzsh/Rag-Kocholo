        "text": "Michael is visiting his girlfriend’s family; they live in a rambling, gingerbread mansion in Quebec City. The father, a writer, can work only in the nude. The mother is highly impressionable and weepy. The grandmother mistakes Michael for her long-dead husband.\n\nBut most pressingly, Michael arrives to hear his girlfriend say she doesn’t think she loves him anymore. Needless to say, this is dispiriting, except that she has two inordinately attractive sisters who seem eager to make Michael feel, shall we say, welcome.\n\nSome Girls – a lousy, inappropriate title – takes off from this premise into some farcical situations, and eventually into a more somber treatment of Michael’s friendship with the grandmother, who is dying. The original screenplay, by Rupert Walters, clearly wants to thoughtfully examine manners and morals, and to explore the mysterious differences between the genders.\n\nSome of this is interestingly treated, but more often the film waffles on what exactly it is about. It seems to be biting off a bit more metaphysics than it can comfortably chew, and the business near the end with the grandmother (the old gal supposedly teaches Michael some important lesson in life) feels particularly labored.\n\nThe movie is at its best a comedy of disorientation; almost everyone can identify with the terrors and humiliations of being a houseguest. Michael, of course, feels he’s doing everything wrong, a feeling that is verified when a naked romp with his girlfriend leads to the family waiting with a surprise birthday party at the bottom of the stairs. Oops.\n\nSome Girls is the latest collaboration between producer Rick Stevenson and director Michael Hoffman (as with their most recent film, Promised Land, the executive producer here is none other than Robert Redford). They are nothing if not capable, but Some Girls plays uneasily like a social farce straining to be an arthouse movie. The filmmakers reach for the bittersweet atmosphere of a Francois Truffaut film, but they can’t conjure up the necessary magic.\n\nI’m not sold on Patrick Dempsey (In the Mood) as Michael; Dempsey’s an affable focal point, but he doesn’t really show us what’s inside the character. The weird family is beautifully cast. It’s one of those rare movie families in which the members actually look like they could be related to each other.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, September 1988\n\nLooks like another review that got cut off at the end, because I sound like I’m about to hand out bouquets to people I haven’t mentioned, which is almost everybody in the cast. Regular readers of this website know of my frequently-mentioned declaration that Sheila Kelley would be a huge star (this was her first non-TV movie), and she played one of the flirtatious sisters (Ashley Greenfield is the other); Jennifer Connelly played the girlfriend. The parents are played by Andre Gregory and Florinda Balkan, and the grandmother by Oscar winner (for Zorba the Greek) Lila Kedrova. I remember wanting this movie to be better, because the set-up has tantalizing possibilities.\n\n“Hot thoughts beget hot deeds,” said Shakespeare, who had it right on the money as usual. That line is quoted in Mortal Passions, a new movie full of words and deeds, some of which are hot, most of which are silly.\n\nIt’s Double Indemnity time, as a scheming young wife (Krista Errickson) plans to kill her wimpy husband (Zach Galligan, the kid from Gremlins). He’s inherited a large Hollywood house, and he’s got a pile of money in the bank, but he still makes her work nights as a cocktail waitress. When she asks him to pull a bit of the $240,000 in his safe-deposit box, he says, “Honey, that’s rainy day money.” (No wonder she wants to kill this dope.)\n\nShe’s met a sleazehound (Luca Bercovici) who will help her murder hubby. But then Galligan’s drifter brother (Michael Bowen) strolls into the picture, and manages to alter the chemistry considerably.\n\nThe film contains a lot of heavy breathing, some of which is fun to watch. In general, this sort of skulking around is pretty irresistible, and Alan Moskowitz’s screenplay keeps in touch with its film noir origins. But there’s also a goodly amount of the sort of dialogue that makes you wonder if Moskowitz had his tongue in his cheek.\n\nAnd the inclusion of a psychiatrist (David Warner) to whom husband and wife are telling their problems comes off as a totally irrelevant touch. Why is he there?\n\nThe movie’s other crucial weakness is its cast. The actors are in their mid-twenties, and the film lacks gravity because of this; these people come off as kids play-acting. The exception is Sheila Kelley, who glides into the movie halfway through as a kooky character with some important information. Kelley, who also appeared in Some Girls and Breaking In, has a radiance that really lights up the screen. Keep an eye out for her.\n\nOther than her presence, director Andrew Lane, who also made the abysmal Jake Speed, doesn’t show much spark. He’s as lost as his characters, and the “hot deeds” are rarely stoked into anything resembling fire.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, January 29, 1990\n\nDid not see this coming: Leading lady Krista Errickson, who had been in Little Darlings and a regular on TV’s Hello, Larry, got out of acting in 1994 and became a distinguished journalist and producer in Italy. Some of the other actors in this thing did pretty well for themselves, and as you can see, this was from the period when I was loudly declaring that Sheila Kelley was going to be the next big thing. I’m sorry to say I did not keep up with the directing work of Andrew Lane, but in description his other films sound pretty hotsy.\n\nA house is being burgled. But there’s something strange going on, even by criminal standards. As the veteran safecracker is breaking in through the back door, a young punk thief is going in through an upstairs window. When they meet in the house, each thinks the other lives there, until they realize they’re both crooks.\n\nThen they relax and get along fine. This is the first of many refreshing wrinkles in Breaking In, a movie that brings together two of the most distinctive filmmaking talents today: John Sayles (Return of the Secaucus Seven), who wrote the script, and Bill Forsyth (Local Hero), the Scottish director.\n\nBoth men always have had a bright and ironic way of looking at things, and this collaboration consistently hits the right notes.\n\nTurns out, the story is really about a mentor, the aging thief, teaching his techniques to a young pupil. After they run into each other, the old pro, Ernie, decides to pass along his secrets to Mike, who doesn’t seem to know a thing about burgling – or anything else.\n\nErnie teaches Mike more than just how to blow a safe. He teaches him a thieves’ code, a way of doing things, a certain classiness. While they’re stealing thousands of dollars from a supermarket payroll safe, Ernie scolds Mike for swiping an apple.\n\nMike gains a nickname – Ernie’s cronies insist on that – and meets a hooker, (Sheila Kelley) with whom he falls in love. She’s so persuasive she convinces Mike to buy a gold Cadillac because it matches her wigs.\n\nThe film meanders in an entirely modest but captivating way. The ethics of stealing are not an issue, by the way. This is a story, not a moral essay. They go to steal a safe from an evangelical organization, and Mike asks, “Are we doin’ the right thing?” To which Ernie can only reply, “No, kid, we’re doin’ the wrong thing. We’re thieves.”\n\nForsyth directs it all in his customary generous deadpan, and gets two nice lead performances. Casey Siemaszko (the best friend in Biloxi Blues and one of the Young Guns) is properly loose-limbed and slightly dimwitted as Mike. As Ernie, Burt Reynolds is made up to look older than he really is, and he carries the age with grace and humor, like the old pro he plays. It’s an understated and effortless performance, just the thing to restore some of the luster to his flagging career. Not that the movie will be a big hit – it won’t – but a little prestige can go a long way.\n\nFirst published in The Herald, October 1989\n\nThey gave the kid a nickname and I don’t mention it? Seems odd. A nice movie, even if the great Forsyth directing another person’s script is something that doesn’t quite catch fire. I see I was able to restrain myself from declaring that Sheila Kelley was going to be the Next Big Thing, which I was doing around this time. The cast also includes Harry Carey, Jr., Stephen Tobolowsky, and Albert Salmi, whose last film this was. Salmi died in 1990 in Spokane in an apparent murder-suicide with his wife, in which it would appear he was not the victim."
