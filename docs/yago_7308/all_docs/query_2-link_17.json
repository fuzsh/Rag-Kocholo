        "text": "The Curtis Institute of Music is pleased to share the news that Andrew Lane has been promoted to Vice President, Touring and Artist Management, taking on an important leadership role as Curtis expands its global presence and launches a new artist management initiative. Since 2013 Mr. Lane has been an innovator and driving force for Curtis on Tour, the school’s Nina von Maltzahn global touring initiative, extending its performance reach to over 110 cities in 23 countries and developing lasting partnerships with institutions around the globe. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he has overseen the success of virtual tours, ensuring that audiences in the U.S. and abroad continue to have access to high-quality performances and educational offerings. As vice president, he will further grow these offerings, integrating strategic priorities in touring and technology.\n\nNotably, Mr. Lane oversaw the recent launch of Curtis’s artist management initiative, which currently represents the GRAMMY-nominated Dover Quartet and critically acclaimed pianist Michelle Cann. He will lead the development of this new aspect of the school in the coming years.\n\n“We have absolutely loved working with Andrew and are excited to continue doing so with his well-deserved promotion,” said the members of the Dover Quartet. “To work with him is to be in great hands and in the best company!”\n\nMr. Lane has stewarded the significant expansion of Curtis on Tour since joining the staff in 2013, including booking and managing more than 300 performances around the world. Highlights include Curtis Symphony Orchestra tours to Europe (2017) and the U.S. East Coast (2020); annual tours in North and South America, Europe, and Asia; and professional performance engagements for Curtis students and alumni, including several debuts with major orchestras and concert presenters.\n\n“We are so pleased to learn of Andrew’s promotion,” said Don Roth, Ph.D., executive director of the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts at the University of California, Davis. “Working with him is always a productive, constructive, and creative process—and we are so glad to see his work recognized as he moves into this important new role.” The Mondavi Center has been an annual presenter of Curtis on Tour performances since the program’s inception.\n\nPrior to joining Curtis, Mr. Lane worked at Opus 3 Artists where he booked chamber music and orchestral engagements for many of the world’s most distinguished artists, from emerging talent to acclaimed artists such as Yefim Bronfman and Jonathan Biss. He held a previous administrative post at the Lubbock Symphony Orchestra.\n\nOriginally from Newnan, Ga., Mr. Lane holds a Bachelor of Music Education degree from Mercer University and a Master of Music degree in choral conducting from Texas Tech University."
