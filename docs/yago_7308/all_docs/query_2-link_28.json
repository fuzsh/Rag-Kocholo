        "text": "Andrew Lane, vice president of touring and artist management at Curtis, has been honored by Musical America as one of the 2022 Top 30 Professionals of the Year. He joins an esteemed group of “resilient warriors,” including CEOs, general and artistic directors, scholars, professors, conductors, musicians, and more, who confronted the daunting uncertainty of the pandemic and its effect on the performing arts, and navigated the aftermath through game-changing innovative efforts. Read Musical America‘s special report profile on Mr. Lane.\n\nSince 2013, Mr. Lane has been the driving force behind Curtis on Tour, the school’s Nina von Maltzahn global touring initiative. Based on Curtis’s guiding philosophy of “learning by doing,” the program has significantly expanded its performance reach to more than 375 concerts in over 20 countries and 100 cities across four continents. Through his inspirational efforts, Curtis has broadened its digital and physical footprint and forged lasting partnerships with institutions across the globe.\n\nUnder Mr. Lane’s leadership, the initiative has seen the Curtis Symphony Orchestra tour Europe (2017), the U.S. East Coast (2020), along with regular tours of smaller ensembles throughout North and South America, Europe, and Asia. Curtis on Tour has led to professional performance engagements for Curtis students and alumni, including several notable debuts with major orchestras and concert presenters. In the spring of 2023, the Curtis Symphony Orchestra season will culminate in its first U.S. West Coast tour with conductor Osmo Vänskä and piano soloist Yefim Bronfman.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Mr. Lane oversaw Curtis’s successful virtual tours, which offered audiences in the U.S. and abroad access to the school’s performances and educational offerings. With COVID-19 continuing to surge, he launched Curtis’s artist management initiative, which currently represents the GRAMMY-nominated Dover Quartet, 2022 Sphinx Medal of Excellence recipient pianist Michelle Cann, and the critically acclaimed Trio Zimbalist.\n\nBefore joining the staff of Curtis, Mr. Lane worked at Opus 3 Artists, where he booked chamber music and orchestral engagements for many of the world’s most distinguished classical music artists, from emerging talent to acclaimed artists such as Yefim Bronfman and Jonathan Biss. He previously held an administrative post at the Lubbock Symphony Orchestra. Originally from Newnan, Georgia, Mr. Lane received a Bachelor of Music Education degree from Mercer University and a Master of Music degree in choral conducting from Texas Tech University.\n\nPhoto: (L-R) Andrew Lane, Mark Rubenstein, Nina Baroness von Maltzahn, and a music teacher at Fundación Retoño Uruguay."
