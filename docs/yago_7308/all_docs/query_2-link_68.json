He has outstanding experience as a senior business executive in international growth markets, having most recently led Abbott Laboratories Pharmaceutical Division with turnover growing from NZ$4 Bil to over NZ$9 Bil during his tenure.\n\n“This unique experience is highly relevant to AFT as we grow and consolidate our position in Australasia and build our presence internationally with our Maxigesic® pain relief and other medications.”\n\nAndrew says: “I am excited by the opportunity to assist AFT with its growth aspirations and will be using my accumulated knowledge in finance, sales and marketing within general, regional and global management for this.”\n\nThe board has determined that Andrew Lane is an Independent Director (within the meaning of the NZX Listing Rules).\n\nReleased for and on behalf of AFT Pharmaceuticals limited by Malcolm Tubby, Chief Financial Officer."
