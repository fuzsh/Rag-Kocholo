He advises municipalities, landowners, and developers regarding long-range planning issues, permitting, water rights, and compliance with environmental laws. Andy takes a practical approach to the practice of law, recognizing that land use disputes can frequently be resolved by up-front planning and creative thinking rather than prolonged litigation.\n\nIn addition to helping private and municipal clients resolve legal disputes, Andy also partners with planners and engineers to provide consulting services to municipalities in land use and Growth Management Act (“GMA”) matters. It is much more efficient to consider the legal ramifications of a land use plan in its formative stages, rather than for the first time in court.\n\nAndy has worked with numerous city and county planners, planning consultants, and State agencies on behalf of his municipal and private clients. This network of officials and planning staff provides a valuable resource – getting quick answers from the right person can save a lot of time and confusion.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAndy joined Cairncross & Hempelmann in 2004.
