        "text": "What website(s) do you use most regularly?\n\nThere is some real untapped comedy in Yelp and product reviews. When I’m not driving my wife crazy by reading those out loud, I’m a sucker for Reddit. There’s a sub on just about everything, and they have such varied and insightful comments. Also, Wikipedia. I can go pretty far down a Wiki-hole while pretending to research material.\n\nWhat’s the most recent piece of tech that you’ve bought?\n\nIt’s not a piece of tech, but an app; What3Words. I was in the UK recently and everyone used it. They divided the entire globe into three-meter by three-meter squares and gave each square a unique three-word combination. Park the grip truck at ///hardly.deflection.flannel, or crafty is at ///wacky.older.burn. It’s more accurate than an address and it’s harder to make mistakes by transposing GPS coordinates. It’s especially helpful when a location has multiple entrances. I don’t know why we aren’t using it in the US. It takes the guesswork out of directions.\n\nWhat product could you not live without?\n\nWired headphones, specifically Bose SoundSport headphones. I hate wireless earbuds. Just one more battery to charge and they are extremely lose-able (I made up that word). The Bose has decent sound for listening to music and a microphone for phone calls They are discontinued, so I buy them refurbished off of eBay. I’m not a Luddite; I just like what I like.\n\nWhat’s the best film you’ve seen over the last year?\n\nAmerican Fiction. It checked a lot of boxes for me, and I notice different things upon rewatches. Jeffrey Wright is great in it, as usual. And John Ortiz is doing John Ortiz things. It also influenced me to drink a lot more Chenin Blanc.\n\nWhat film do you think everyone should have seen?\n\nDon’t say Armageddon. Don’t say Armageddon. Don’t say Armageddon. Don’t say Armageddon. Don’t say Armageddon. I’m gonna go with Armageddon. It’s one of those movies that, if it’s on, I must watch it. I’ve even caught myself watching it on Telemundo before. I know all the dialogue, so it doesn’t matter what language it’s in. Other than the Aerosmith song in it, it is a perfect movie in my eyes."
