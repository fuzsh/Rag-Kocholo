        "text": "Actors\n\nSir John Vincent Hurt CBE (January 22, 1940 – January 25, 2017) was a British actor whose career spanned more than 50 years. He came to prominence for his role as Richard Rich in Fred Zinnemann’s adaptation of A Man for All Seasons (1966) and gained BAFTA Award nominations for his portrayals of Timothy Evans in Richard Fleischer’s 10 Rillington Place (1971) and Quentin Crisp in television film The Naked Civil Servant (1975) – winning his first BAFTA for the latter. He played Caligula in the BBC TV series I, Claudius (1976).\n\nHurt’s performance Alan Parker’s prison drama Midnight Express (1978) brought him international renown and earned Golden Globe and BAFTA Awards, along with an Academy Award nomination. His BAFTA-nominated portrayal of astronaut Kane, in Ridley Scott‘s science-fiction horror film Alien (1979), yielded a scene where an alien creature burst out of his chest. It has been named by several publications as one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. He would spoof the scene from Alien in Mel Brooks‘s 1987 sci-fi spoof, Spaceballs.\n\nHurt earned his third competitive BAFTA, along with his second Oscar and Golden Globe nominations, as John Merrick in David Lynch‘s biopic The Elephant Man (1980). Other significant roles during the 1980s included Bob Champion in biopic Champions (1984), Mr. Braddock in the Stephen Frears drama The Hit (1984), with Terence Stamp, Laura del Sol, and Tim Roth; Winston Smith in Michael Radford‘s adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) and Stephen Ward in the drama depicting the Profumo affair, Scandal (1989). Hurt was again BAFTA-nominated for his work in Jim Sheridan‘s The Field (1990) and played the primary villain, James Graham, in the epic adventure Rob Roy (1995). Other notable films include Second Best (1994), with William Hurt and Alan Cumming.\n\nHis later films include the Harry Potter film series (2001–11), Miranda (2002), with Christina Ricci, Kyle MacLachlan, John Simm, Tamsin Greig and Julian Rhind-Tutt; the Guillermo del Toro‘s Hellboy films (2004 and 2008), with Ron Perlman; supernatural thriller The Skeleton Key (2005), western The Proposition (2005), political thriller V for Vendetta (2005), with Natalie Portman; Steven Spielberg‘s Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) the Cold War espionage film Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011), with Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Tom Hardy, Toby Jones, Mark Strong, Benedict Cumberbatch, Ciarán Hinds, David Dencik and Kathy Burke; Jayne Mansfield’s Car (2012), with Robert Duvall, Kevin Bacon, Ray Stevenson, Frances O’Connor, Ron White, and Robert Patrick; and Bong Joon-ho‘s Snowpiercer (2013), with Chris Evans, Song Kang-ho, Tilda Swinton, Jamie Bell, Octavia Spencer, Go Ah-sung, and Ed Harris. Hurt reprised his role as Quentin Crisp in An Englishman in New York (2009), which brought his seventh BAFTA nomination. He portrayed the War Doctor in BBC TV series Doctor Who in 2013.\n\nHurt was regarded as one of Britain’s finest actors; director David Lynch described him as “simply the greatest actor in the world.” He possessed what was described as the “most distinctive voice in Britain,” likened by The Observer to “nicotine sieved through dirty, moonlit gravel.” His voice acting career encompassed films such as Watership Down (1978), Ralph Bakshi‘s adaptation of The Lord of the Rings (1978), The Plague Dogs (1982), The Black Cauldron (1985) and Dogville (2003), as well as BBC TV series Merlin (2008–2012). In 2012, he was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement BAFTA Award, in recognition of his “outstanding contribution to cinema.” He was knighted in 2015 for his services to drama.\n\nEach review will be linked to the title below.\n\n(*seen originally in theaters)\n\n(**seen rereleased in theaters)\n\nFilm\n\nThe Wild and the Willing (1962) – directed by Ralph Thomas\n\nThe Contact (1963) – directed by Philip Wrestler – short\n\nThis Is My Street (1964) – directed by Sidney Hayers\n\nA Man for All Seasons (1966) – directed by Fred Zinnermann\n\nThe Sailor from Gibraltar (1967) – directed by Tony Richardson\n\nSinful Davey (1969) – directed by John Huston\n\nBefore Winter Comes (1969) – directed by J.
