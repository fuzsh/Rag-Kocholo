        "text": "High-Pressure Hope at the Paris Olympics\n\nCheers, howls, and the occasional boo have brought joyous cacophony to the City of Light.\n\nThe Republican National Convention and the Iconography of Triumph\n\nIn Milwaukee, with a candidate who had just cheated death, the resentment rhetoric of Trump’s 2016 campaign gave way to an atmosphere of festive certainty.\n\n1982 and the Fate of Filmgoing\n\nA new book claims that a few big summer movies heralded an epochal shift in the motion-picture industry, but is that really how cultural history works?\n\nThe Euros Are Like Europe, Only Better\n\nSomething is afoot in this tournament, a spectacle that has been explosively enjoyable and peppered with surprises.\n\nThe Moral Plea Behind Kate Middleton’s Cancer Disclosure\n\nAfter weeks of conspiracy theories and online calls for her private medical information, the Princess of Wales offered an appeal for basic public decency.\n\nLord Byron Was More Than Just Byronic\n\nTwo centuries after his death, the works of the great Romantic poet reveal a sensibility whose restless meld of humor and melancholy feels thoroughly contemporary.\n\nA Philosophy of Pleasure in “The Taste of Things”\n\nThe film, starring Juliette Binoche as a chef at a country manor, is devoted to the long-ripened skills and sheer hard work that go into the giving of rapture.\n\nA Birthday Party to Die for in “Tótem”\n\nIn Lila Avilés’s family drama, a young girl must confront her father’s terminal illness at a gathering of relatives.\n\nMichael Mann’s Beguiling “Ferrari”\n\nThe film, starring Adam Driver as the company’s founder, features the trusty components of a Mann movie: the smooth mechanics of professional labor, plus the exhaust manifold of men’s emotional lives.\n\nThe Year in Moviegoing\n\nThe year resounded with large, loud, and costly films—some of which were so poorly conceived they led me to wonder, why not get A.I. to write them?\n\n“The Zone of Interest” Finds Banality in the Evil of Auschwitz\n\nJonathan Glazer’s film about the family life of the Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss is calmly composed and fiercely controlled.\n\nGrand Appetites and “Poor Things”\n\nIn Yorgos Lanthimos’s film, Emma Stone plays a young woman who was created by a scientist, and is forever tasting the world—eating, dancing, travelling, having sex—as if it were freshly made.\n\nRidley Scott’s “Napoleon” Cannot Quite Vanquish Its Subject\n\nJoaquin Phoenix summons a man prowling the battlements of his own brain, but is Napoleon’s life just too big for any one movie?\n\n“Maestro” Is a Leonard Bernstein Bio-Pic as Restless as Its Subject\n\nBradley Cooper stars in his own film about the great conductor-composer, but it is Carey Mulligan, as Bernstein’s wife, Felicia, who walks away with the movie.\n\n“Priscilla” Presents the Echoing Void of Elvis’s Fame\n\nIt’s no knock to call Sofia Coppola’s bio-pic, starring Cailee Spaeny as Priscilla Presley, superficial, because surfaces are Coppola’s subject.\n\n“The Killer” Misses\n\nStarring Michael Fassbender, David Fincher’s film aspires to the cool ruthlessness of its hit-man protagonist but has too many clever conceits to feel threatening.\n\nDramatic and Moral Ambitions Clash in “Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nMartin Scorsese’s epic about the Osage murders honors Indigenous suffering, but the action keeps getting pulled back into the orbit of the white, male perpetrators.\n\nCan Happiness Be Taught?\n\nBolstered by Oprah, a Harvard Business School professor thinks you should run your inner self like a company.\n\nHigh-Pressure Hope at the Paris Olympics\n\nCheers, howls, and the occasional boo have brought joyous cacophony to the City of Light.\n\nThe Republican National Convention and the Iconography of Triumph\n\nIn Milwaukee, with a candidate who had just cheated death, the resentment rhetoric of Trump’s 2016 campaign gave way to an atmosphere of festive certainty.\n\n1982 and the Fate of Filmgoing\n\nA new book claims that a few big summer movies heralded an epochal shift in the motion-picture industry, but is that really how
