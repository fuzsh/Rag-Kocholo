        "text": "Movie director Guy Ritchie is planning to revisit the character of Sherlock Holmes for a TV series.\n\nThe show will be about the fictional detective as a youth. Harry Potter actor Hero Fiennes Tiffin, 26, has been cast in the lead role.\n\nThe series, Young Sherlock, will be based on novels by Andrew Lane. The books feature Holmes as a troubled teenager in the 1860s and 1870s coming up against mysteries that set him on the path to his future career. A source said production on the show is set to begin this summer.\n\nThe insider added: “The books are hugely popular so there is plenty of excitement about this project. It will be a treat for fans.” It is expected to be a big budget series for the Amazon Prime Video streaming service. Guy, 55, who first made waves with 1998 crime comedy film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, has directed two movies about Holmes.\n\nThe films, in 2009 and 2011, starred Robert Downey Jr as the sleuth, with Jude Law as his sidekick Dr Watson. Guy said previously: “I’ve been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since I was six. We were rewarded by the school – if you were a good lad, they would show you Sherlock Holmes on tape, so I knew all the stories from there.”\n\nHis recent hits include Netflix gangster show The Gentlemen. Hero played the young Voldemort – Tom Riddle – in 2009 movie Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, with the adult Voldemort played by his uncle, Ralph Fiennes.\n\nPrime Video declined to comment yesterday on the Young Sherlock project."
