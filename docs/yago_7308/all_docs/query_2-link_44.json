        "text": "Andrew joined MANTEC in 2021 as a Business Solutions Specialist, bringing over six years of experience in supporting manufacturers. In this role, he is dedicated to connecting MANTEC’s clients with valuable resources and contacts while fostering new relationships with manufacturers across our nine-county region. In addition to his outreach efforts, Andrew oversees MANTEC’s Professional Development program, reflecting his commitment to continuous professional and personal growth.\n\nAndrew is also a Co-Founder and Vice President of the Young Manufacturers Network (YMN) of South-Central PA. He and his colleagues established YMN to create a network of young employees in manufacturing, aimed at collaboration for professional growth, learning, and camaraderie, ultimately strengthening the region’s manufacturing capabilities and businesses.\n\nBefore joining MANTEC, Andrew worked in the staffing industry, focusing on manufacturing companies. He brings extensive knowledge of the local manufacturing sector and a deep understanding of what manufacturers need to grow and succeed. Passionate about helping and leading people, Andrew took great pride in mentoring five account executives at the staffing agency, fostering their success and professional growth.\n\nAndrew holds a degree in Criminal Justice. When he is not supporting local manufacturers, he enjoys watching football (Go Vikings!), golfing, boating, and spending time with his wife, three children, and their three dogs (a lab mix, English bulldog, and French bulldog)."
