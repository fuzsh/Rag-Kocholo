        "text": "A little reading music to set the tone — thanks Mark(Snow-X-Files) for a poppin fun theme and score.\n\nJAKE SPEED- 1986\n\nTaglines:\n\nHe’s rewriting the book on adventure\n\nMore than a myth. Less than a legend. And a bit too big for his boots…\n\nWhat if the very books you read…no not the books for Dummies- Soccer, Math, Film, Computers.. all the how to’s and world history — All The Presidents’s Men…etc. No I am referring to all those ’70s pulp books stashed under your bed that pull out at night or sneak a peek during Calculus or Social Studies. Oh yeah now you remember. Titles like Brain Drain, Haitian Hit, Mafia Fix, Sword of Allah…\n\nwith characters who go by The Destroyer aka Remo, Mack and Richard(Dragon), Robert Sand(Black Samurai)and Speed? Jake Speed. What if these “guys”were real. The Heroes of the downtrodden, people who have exhausted every avenue of justice. Who would you turn to? Flip thru the yellow pages? Or would call Penguin, Pinnacle or Tandem Books.\n\nKaren Kopins( Once Bitten) stars as Margaret- seeking her sister-Maureen, who has been kidnapped by White Slavers and headed up by one of the most vile villains — John Hurt aka Sid? Oh yes!!! And most despicable. Only his brother could love him.. And I’m not so sure how far that goes. Just don’t get any blood on the new rug…\n\nSo where does our hero fit in to all this. Well Jake(Speed) is literally “fictional” who is not that fictional.. Right out of a book. But the pulp action/adventure characters are real. He travels with his author Desmond, played by Dennis Christopher, who regales all of Jake’s exploits. See the current bestseller at the newsstand.\n\nMargaret being a fish out of water accompanies Jake and Desmond to rescue her sister. Adventure and danger ensues. Everything from mad eating lions to helicopters dishing a little bit of machine gun fire to avoiding civil war and in between Sid and Maurice our wonderful bickering siblings just trying to run a family business- white slavery. Mom and Dad would be so house proud. Oh and Jake and Sid are “old” buddies.. yeah they go all the way back to Volume 2…Plus don’t you just hate when bad guts are smart enough you wear bullet proof vests?\n\nSo stick around to see if Margaret and Maureen make it back in time for Grandpa’s birthday and if Jake ever finishes chapter 11.\n\nJake Speed- is in the tradition of Romancing the Stone(Kathleen Turner/Michael Douglas), Africa Express(Ursla Andress), Crocodile Dundee(Paul Hogan)and Jane and The Lost City(Sam Jones). Romantic Action/Adventure Comedies(RAAC)s. Light fun fare. Pure escapism. And who can’t use that once in awhile.\n\nPlaying our stalwart is none other than writer/actor/director -Wayne Crawford. Wayne obviously is a very versatile individual. He is responsible for one of the ’80s most iconic and most popular film of that decade, Valley Girl. It had a killer soundtrack, giving us a young Nicolas Cage in a really well acted if not quirky at times high school-er. He just won’t take no for an answer. He is persistent without being creepy. Hard to do. But when it comes to love it knows no boundaries.\n\nWith Jake Speed, aside from breathing life into this pulp fiction dogooders. Wayne also gives Jake his wit and charm along with his steadfast belief that justice will prevail. You just know it will workout. Just not how…That is the fun of little gem. A fitting late night viewing. Or a hot Sunday afternoon stretch at the cinema(maybe that big screen TV you just got for the holidays). And Karen Kopins shines as the girl out of water. You feel her frustration with Jake and his eternal optimism. I know I’m one of those “guys”. Well maybe more like an optimistic realist if that is possible. But that kind of view can be annoying especially when their right.\n\nThe supporting cast is there for good measure.. Monte Markham(Perry Mason), character actor Leon Ames(2 Mr Moto films and Mr Ed) and Donna Pescow(Saturday Night Fever). Although on screen for only a short time, they do ad just the right amount of nostalgia and charm to round out Margaret’s family.\n\nArrow Video-just recently released a Bluray of this sought after ’80s pop culture classic. A 2K restoration and remastered from the original 35 mm inter-positive. Lost of extras with interviews of producer William Fay and co-writer/director/producer Andrew Lane. The interview with Andrew please pay close attention for he reveals an interesting piece of trivia regarding one possible casting for Jake Speed. All this plus a reversible sleeve with new commissioned art from one my all time favorite modern poster artists- Graham Humphreys. See below link for Graham’s new book from Korero Press.\n\nBelow- a preview of the bonus material for Jake Speed\n\nBefore I go I want to make sure you stop by Arrow Films and check out all the cool pop and cult classics they’re out of this world…\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArrowFilmsVideo\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/arrowvideo\n\nhttp://www.arrowfilms.com/\n\nSix degrees of an Aurora model kit-\n\nKorero Press- The link and the below description is hard to top. I can only say if you are an artist, interested in the history of or just some one who appreciates the world of brush strokes and sketches either on canvas or paper. Or if you are a lover of all things weird and wonderfully pop this is the place to peruse and shop. Oh and not mention books…\n\nGraham Humphreys- Hung,Drawn and Excecuted- The Horror Art of Graham Humphreys\n\nAs mentioned above Graham has brought his incredible eye and lent his talents to not only Jake Speed and the reversible cover sleeves for Jake Speed. But he has been bringing in new fans to the world of art and, movies both classic and modern and posters. His latest book is little short of astounding. The images are not only detailed with at times surreal look both offer a new spin on some of my favorite classic monster movies of my childhood.(I lean more towards that part of the Horror genre). But I grew up watching the Universal Classics on Saturday afternoons. Graham also tackles Bava’s Erik the Conqueror(Cameron Mitchell) and Hammer Films\n\nWe already know he has provided art for DVD/Blurays. Additionally Graham has created art for album/CD covers for garage bands(Dolls), soundtracks (Zero Boys)and well known composers such as Ennio Morricone as well. Plus book covers which seems like a natural transition for him as well. Including this one of course. He also does private commissions and film festivals.\n\nOften stated and quoted by Humphreys is a major influence on his life was the revised edition of the Dracula Glow in the Dark kit by Aurora model company . This is irony for that very company was one of the influnces on my career along with Famous Monsters of Filmland. The original artist for Aurora was James Bama. Who knew that later in my life I would be reviewing the Aurora Model company DVD documentary. And for one of my friends Cortlandt Hull. Cortlandt is the creator and curator for a wax museum in Bristol,Conn called the Witch’s Dungeon Classic Movie Museum. Open every year for the Halloween season since 1966. See Below link-*Cortlandts’ great Uncle is none other than Henry Hull- the first ever actor to play a werewolf on screen in Werewolf of London. So talk about the “Kevin Bacon” rule…\n\nOne last thing I would like to point out is most notably to take advantage of the introduction Graham breaks down his process for drawing. Could be your first lesson and why not learn from one of the best.\n\nIf you are not a fan maybe through these new renditions and takes on the original artwork from those days of paper art that adorned the showcases at the local bijou you just might become one. Thanks Graham and look forward to next venture. And thanks to Korero for making this review possible.\n\nSee ya all back here next issue when we giant worms in the classic scifi flick that gave us two most unlikely heroes- Burt and Earl…\n\nAvailable now from Korero-"
