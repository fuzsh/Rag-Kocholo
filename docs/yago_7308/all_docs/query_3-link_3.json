        "text": "Hidden camera expert Andrew Lane is known for a unique directorial style that fuses impeccable multi-camera technical execution with an eye for compelling narratives, from hijink-driven comedy to emotional PSAs. With a distinct talent for uncovering humanity in unexpected moments, his hidden camera work leaves audiences with piqued curiosity and a desire to connect. He seamlessly blends his experience in reality television with masterful storytelling, helming memorable commercials for top brands such as Lay’s, Google, Mountain Dew, Allstate, Stella Artois, Diesel, and Bud Light.\n\nAfter studying advertising in Austin at the University of Texas, he began with a brief stint on the agency side as a copywriter. He later made his way to New York, rapidly building up his impressive hidden camera directorial career alongside top brands and TV shows including Top Chef, Project Runway, and Stormchasers. His projects have earned widespread industry acclaim, including three Cannes Lions for States United to Prevent Gun Violence and several Lions for his 2018 ad for Diesel, “Go with the Fake,” which tackled counterfeit culture head-on with a clever hidden camera pop-up store."
