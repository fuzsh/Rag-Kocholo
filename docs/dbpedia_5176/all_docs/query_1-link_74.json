GERMANY. May 15.] 46 CONFIDENTIAL SECTION 9. [C 8683/1/18] No. 1. Sir G. Grahame to the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston.— (Received May 15.) (No. 410.) My Lord, Brussels, May 12, 1923. ON Tuesday, the 8th instant, the general council of the Belgian Labour party met to nominate the delegates to be sent to the approaching international congress at Hamburg, and to consider the policy to be recommended by them on various important issues. M. Emile Vandervelde, who has been designated to report to the congress on the territorial arrangements resulting from the Versailles Treaty, and on the problems of security and reparations, gave a verbal résumé of his report to the council. With regard to security, he recalled the recent offers of the German Socialists, and recommended, in addition, measures to strengthen the republican régime in the former \"Central Empires.\" As to reparations, the recent German offers were unacceptable, but the gulf between them and the requirements of the Allied Governments was not impassable. M. Vandervelde gave an account of the various proposals that had been made as to the total sum to be demanded of Germany, and said that there was general agreement in fixing the amount at the round figures of .50 milliard gold marks. The Germans had offered 30 milliards, and he agreed that this could not be accepted if the war pensions, included at the request of Mr. Lloyd George, were not eliminated from the Allied claims. The Allies must agree to the application of all the money paid by Germany to the devastated regions. France claimed under this head 26 milliards, Belgium 5, and other countries 4. That made 35 milliards, which was not far from the German offer. It was clear, however, that the inter-Allied debts must also be cancelled, since France and Belgium owed to Great Britain and the United States 45 milliards. He therefore proposed the following resolution, which will be voted upon next week :- \"The General Council renews its reservations, formulated on the eve of the Treaty of Versailles, as to the Saar, Silesia, Eupen and Malmédy, and as to the disguised annexation of the German colonies. It continues to advocate the measures of security already agreed to by the Socialists of the countries interested, viz., a general pact of guarantee, a guarantee by England and the United States of America, and demilitarisation of the left bank of the Rhine, as well as of the neutral zone on the right bank. \" It reiterates the conviction that European peace and French security can be better assured by economic pacification and by strengthening republican institutions in Germany than by violence such as the occupation of the Ruhr. \" As to reparations, it considers— \" 1. That loyal payment by Germany is an essential element of European peace; but that the restoration of normal economic relations, and a final and complete settlement between Germany and her creditors, are indispensable factors of such a payment. \"2. That such a settlement requires a general agreement amongst the Powers interested in the sense of the Frankfort resolutions, namely :– \" (a.) The limitation of the German debt to the sums required for reparation, excluding military pensions, which would imply the renunciation of the British share in German payments. \" (b.) The cancellation of inter-Allied war debts. \" (c.) An international loan to Germany secured by sound guarantees. \"3.\n\nbelgium germany colonies disarmament pacifism pensions reparations socialism international agreements hamburg saarland occupation territory international debt international conferences international relations and foreign policy prussia rhineland upper silesia reparation negotiations eupen-malmedy eupen malmedy belgian politics treaty of frankfurt (1871) international socialism reparation payments emile vandervelde reparation claims\n\nCollection ID\n\nFO371\n\nDocument Reference\n\nFO 371/8636/18\n\nDocument Types\n\nCorrespondence\n\nFile Reference\n\nFO 371/8636\n\nFormer Department Reference\n\nCode 18 File 1 (papers 8505 – 8918)\n\nIdentifier\n\n10.1080/wng.fo371.008636.018\n\nKeywords\n\nBelgian Politics Colonies Disarmament International Agreements International Conferences International Debt International Socialism Occupation Pacifism Pensions Reparation Claims Reparation Negotiations Reparation Payments Reparations Socialism Territory Treaty Of Frankfurt (1871)\n\nLanguage\n\nEnglish\n\nPublished in\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nSeries\n\nGermany: Reparations Negotiations\n\nThemes\n\nInternational Relations and Foreign Policy Reparations"
