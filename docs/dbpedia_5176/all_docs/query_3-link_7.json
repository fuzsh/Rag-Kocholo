        "text": "The 1927 Exhibition of Flemish and Belgian Art, 1300 to 1900, in London looked like an unprecedented international blockbuster, a show that was not to be missed. Over the span of two months, from 8 January to 5 March, more than 150,000 people walked through the turnstiles of Burlington House – the Royal Academy's lavish home in the fashionable district of Piccadilly – to marvel at hundreds of masterpieces sent on loan for the occasion. Visitors began their journey with ‘Flemish Primitives’: painters such as Hubert and Jan van Eyck, Petrus Christus, Rogier van der Weiden and Gerard David. Further afield they encountered the seventeenth-century ‘Flemish Baroque’: Anthony van Dyck (dominating the scene was his The Three Eldest Children of Charles I, lent by King George V from his permanent collection at Windsor Castle) and Peter Paul Rubens (among others: the Portrait of Isabella Brant, also courtesy of the king). In the last section, nineteenth-century artists such as Henri de Braekeleer and François Simoneau represented the distinctive tradition of the Belgian nation. A side trip took spectators through dozens of drawings, miniatures and engravings by the likes of Jan and Pieter Brueghel, Rubens, van Dyck, Jacob Jordaens and Lambert Suavius. Finally, as a dramatic backdrop to the entire show, large tapestries sent especially from Vienna were hung throughout the galleries.Footnote 1 In the introduction to the Illustrated Souvenir of the exhibition, art collector Robert Witt (1872–1952) celebrated the cooperation among ‘no less than five foreign Governments: the Belgian, the Austrian, the French, the Danish and the Hungarian’, all of which had made this wondrous display possible; ‘Beauty has ever a healing touch, and the love of art is common to nearly all’, he proclaimed.Footnote 2 The exhibition's accompanying events, speeches and media coverage would buttress his points, making the event not only an international but also an internationalist sensation.\n\nThe 1927 Flemish exhibition in London, so far unexplored by historians, exemplifies a new kind of political performance that shaped cultural diplomacy in the interwar period and beyond.Footnote 3 ‘Political performances’, in Shirin Rai's theorisation, served as a means to ‘communicate to an audience meaning-making related to state institutions, policies and discourses’.Footnote 4 In concrete terms, they showcased not only artefacts but also the people, institutions and policies that led to their preservation and display. A few scholars have already noted the internationalist tone of art shows in this period. Art historian Keith Holz, for instance, pointed out the importance of the notion that ‘the exhibition of one nation's art to another could improve the relationship between the two countries’ since it constituted the ‘fundamental and guiding assumption to underpin officially sponsored art exhibitions sent abroad between European countries during the thirties’.Footnote 5 Yet the same art historian rapidly discounted this notion as a ‘wish-laden’ hope, a set of ideas based on 1930s assumptions whose ‘banality’ is self-evident.Footnote 6 This article maintains, instead, that we should take it seriously, and scrutinise carefully the influence that such notions had in their time and in subsequent decades.\n\nThe 1927 Exhibition of Flemish and Belgian Art – though itself relevant as a key moment in art history and in the development of British-Belgian relations – is examined here as a leading example of a new genre of large-scale events which served a public culture of internationalism in this period and beyond. With the rise of mass media, it illuminates the dynamics of international relations in a much broader sense than its title might imply. As a political performance, the 1927 Flemish exhibition presented the interplay of art and international cooperation as an innovative and effective tool for managing international relations in the post-1919 world.Footnote 7 Akin to the League of Nations, it legitimised the nation-state as the only viable organising unit by recognising its sole right to handle national artefacts. It promoted a brand of internationalism which was not antithetical to nationalism but sought to reconcile national differences with universalist rhetoric and values. It also solidified the assumption that events of the same kind would engage individuals and institutions from various countries and sway public opinion, developing relationships and feelings whose positive effect would extend from the cultural to the political realm. Tellingly, the state and non-state actors involved in the organisation of the 1927 Flemish exhibition emphasised the political significance of international cooperation in the field of culture, evoking art and beauty as means of uniting people and of maintaining peace and security, while using aesthetics and emotions to achieve their political goals.Footnote 8 Crucially, they devoted great resources to ‘visibility’ – the practice of organising public exercises of power – thus contributing to the establishment of a key feature of cultural international relations in the twentieth century.Footnote 9\n\nReaders of and contributors to the present journal have long noted the continuities between the interwar and the post-1945 periods. They have also helped to capture the breadth and influence of many ‘agents of internationalism’.Footnote 10 Art, however, has long been left out of the story, as have the public performances of international cooperation implicit in its display.Footnote 11 A recent Contemporary European History special issue on ‘European Cultural Diplomacy and the Twenty Years’ Crisis, 1919–1939’ has done much to bring attention to these neglected aspects.Footnote 12 By emphasising the unprecedented ‘expansion’ of ‘cultural diplomacy’ in the interwar period, and the effervescence of Europe as a ‘laboratory’ in which to test new practices, it challenged historians to look more closely into such complex transnational interactions.Footnote 13 This article aims to answer this call by drawing attention to the inordinate amount of energy devoted to exhibiting the laboratory itself through highly-visible symbolic acts. It adopts a broader lens to the study of exhibitions to include in its scope the accompanying events, speeches, texts and media coverage produced before, during and after the occasion, and by taking into account the organisers’ previous activities and later recollections.\n\nWithout contradicting former interpretations, which have emphasised the role of exhibitions in fostering nationalism and imperialism,Footnote 14 such an approach reveals that what organisers and observers said overtly, repeated continuously, and displayed through multiple forms and media persisted regardless of its accuracy or success. It explains why organisational matters were often conducted publicly, and also why preoccupations with potential repercussions often guided decision-making processes more than other concerns. As Carolyn Biltoft recently pointed out, performances of this kind influenced perceptions and became reality. For this reason, in an age of mass politics and communication, and at a time when public opinion increasingly mattered, state and non-state entities across the political spectrum devoted great energy to moulding them.Footnote 15\n\nThis line of enquiry complicates our definition of cultural diplomacy and our understanding of the various actors who engaged in it during the interwar period. Exhibitions are often framed as forms of cultural diplomacy emanating from the centre outwards, with non-state actors playing an important role in shaping them;Footnote 16 instead, the Flemish exhibition was spearheaded by a political non-state organisation, the Anglo-Belgian Union, with states serving as patrons.Footnote 17 When examined more broadly to include the array of deliberate visible, symbolic actions that accompanied it (e.g. staging public performances of international cooperation, charging with meaning the choice of displaying a piece or not, creating and disseminating texts to guide the audience's perceptions and interpretations), this exhibition involved an even wider spectrum of actors such as foreign offices, media and political organisations. These did not act in concert but participated in the staging of a collective performance which was imbued in aesthetics and emotions. This article places the spotlight on the visible display they produced, shedding light on both the show and the people who made it happen, and emphasising the long-standing effects of their work.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study of the 1927 Exhibition of Flemish and Belgian Art in London demonstrates that even though events such as this have not always been of central interest to historians they have long mattered to a wide range of state and non-state actors. In addition to museums, political organisations like the Anglo-Belgian Union, foreign offices and news media all devoted vast resources to shaping this exhibition, commenting on it before, during and after it took place, and used it to further their agendas. For scholars interested in cultural diplomacy and international relations this argument carries multiple implications. It broadens their field by incorporating activities spearheaded by non-state actors yet moulded by the state in important ways. It challenges them to acknowledge their relevance apart from their success at achieving their stated goals (e.g. securing peace among nations), and to separate immediate results from later appropriations and representations, fully acknowledging the influence of the latter regardless of their accuracy. Also, since exhibitions extended well beyond the galleries, visible political performances – such as accompanying texts and events, representations and recollections – might be included in future examinations and enrich narratives on cultural and international relations in the interwar period and beyond.\n\nThis article demonstrated that events such as the 1927 exhibition influenced subsequent initiatives, as people, institutions and governments cited them as precedents to bolster their proposals and often took them into account throughout their decision-making processes. Expanding the study of other landmark occasions to include their predecessors and tracing how these were used in different instances might add a further layer to what we know about cultural and political developments and their changes over time.\n\nCrucially, this study has shown how art exhibitions can serve as a unique window onto the time in which they took place and beyond. As the result of the collaboration among numerous state and non-state actors, they allow historians to observe how these interacted in a concrete setting. Given the highly symbolic cultural and political value of art, they reveal what mattered the most to people and to institutions, unveiling mechanics connected to aesthetics and emotions that have just begun to be explored by scholars in various fields. Moreover, because of their mediatic value and the involvements of fast-evolving technologies, they shed light on how public spectacles were constructed and consumed over time.\n\nIndeed, with the rise of visual and digital cultures, images and symbols gained further currency as meaningful, immediate and unmediated vehicles for political communication in the twentieth century. The idea that international cultural events provide an important platform for political performances has become commonplace, as has the role of art as signifier of larger political meanings and messages. Against this backdrop, the interwar chapter examined in this article assumes new importance, as it shows the dynamics through which individuals, institutions and governments tried to manage conflicting messages in highly visible ways, and how art served – and still serves – as a vehicle for them to achieve their goals."
