        "text": "A Thomas Bibliography and related documents\n\nThis list was adapted from the one prepared used Morris Janowitz for W. I. Thomas on Social Organization and Social Personality (1966) originally prepared by Paul A. Hare. That version did not included Thomas's book reviews or his work with William White and Harry S. Sullivan. We have added them as a useful way of tracing the development of his thinking. The list has continued to grow, including additions of previously unnoted review essays in December 2005. It also includes a previously unnoted article for American Magazine that shared the same title as the 1906 article in the American Journal of Sociology: \"The Adventitious Character of Woman.\" We haven't been able to retrieve all of these documents and prepare them for the web.

No central repository exists, but several small caches are spread through a number of American institutional archives, often disbursed within the papers of his friends, colleagues and superiors.\n\nRemembrances and Biographical Notes\n\nA collection of biographical notes and brief essays on Thomas's life and work.\n\nContemporary Reviews\n\nA collection of contemporary reviews of Thomas's books\n\nNewspaper Coverage of Thomas's Career\n\nA collection of contemporary newspaper articles concerning Thomas, with a special focus on the events surrounding his dismissal from the University of Chicago.

Included are such items as press coverage of the dismissal of Scott Nearing from the The Wharton School in 1915 (a good comparator to Thomas's dismissal), Nearing's prosecution under the Espionage Act (a good example of the federal government's actions against peace activists) for his pamphlet, \"The Great Madness,\" the formation and Activities of the People's Council of America — the Executive proclamations defining the Enemy Alien Act during World War I, which effected the regulations under which Thomas was arrested, with relevant press coverage,.\n\nHarriet Park Thomas\n\nRelated Documents\n\nBy Harriet Park Thomas\n\nAmerican Journal of Sociology\n\n\"[Review of] The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets by Jane Addams\" American Journal of Sociology 15 (1910): 550-553.\n\nAbout Harriet Park Thomas\n\nNew York Times\n\n\"Mrs. William I.
