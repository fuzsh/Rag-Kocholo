        "text": "This article delves into the processes of territorial transformation by foregrounding the material dimension of infrastructure. The entry of the research is infrastructure network design and planning. We will trace the concepts of territorial transformation inscribed into the material layout of large technical systems by analyzing the discourse of engineers and policy makers involved in the conception of infrastructure networks. In so doing, the material politics of infrastructure networks will be studied: How did engineers and policy makers design infrastructure to generate a specific territorial transformation? Moreover, how did technological plans hold the idea that one could influence modernization processes by means of a territorial transformation instigated by infrastructure? The neutral status of technology is thus fundamentally challenged by showing that engineers, in association with policy makers, were essential actors in the planned transformation of the territory as they...\n\nBeing one of the historically most densely populated and most urbanised regions of Europe, nineteenth century Belgium was imagined as a markedly urban landscape. Politically this was translated in the notion of municipal autonomy, a key principle of Belgian political life which counterbalanced the centralising tendencies of the newly founded state. The central argument of this chapter is that municipal autonomy at once strengthened and weakened national unity. On the one hand, it functioned as a safety valve to relieve the pressure from ideological, socio-economic and ethnic quarrels that might threaten the unity of the nation. Liberal town authorities, for instance, could follow their own agenda under a hostile Catholic government and vice versa. The municipal level also played a crucial role in alleviating the tensions of democratization as a laboratory for electoral reform. On the other hand, in the long run municipal autonomy may have undermined the state's capacity to harness differences within the nation, by providing local interests an eminently patriotic excuse to escape the state's nationalising reach.\n\nAt first glance, Belgian settlement geographies might look anarchic, nebular, and haphazard. However, these polycentric spatial structures are the result of interwoven urbanization processes at different scales that can be traced and analyzed, thereby rendering Belgian urban geographies comprehensible. ‘From Polycentricity to a Renovated Urban Systems Theory: Explaining Belgian Settlement Geographies’ proposes a conceptual framework to make sense of the Belgian urban system. This framework draws upon ‘renovated’ theoretical perspectives developed in the mid 20th century spatial science era of human geography, such as central place theory, the theory of cumulative causation and time geography. Based on these perspectives, a multi-system framework is proposed that can speak to contemporary debates while retaining theoretical continuity with the past. This is corroborated by several concrete studies that situate contemporary Belgian settlement geographies historically and functionally. It is concluded that, by critically engaging with contemporary social and economic issues, old-fashioned geography can still play a productive role today.\n\nWith From Flux to Frame Van Acker presents a popularized version of his dissertation. Nevertheless, the main aim is still theoretical: to link the realisation of infrastructure projects to processes of urbanization using a historical perspective. However, as further elaborated upon below, the theoretical introduction ignores important earlier contributions on this topic making the theoretical claim rather thin. The major part of the book revolves around three cases that try to unravel the relationship between infrastructure projects and the production of a, to a certain degree, urban built environment. The case descriptions are lengthy, 90 to 150 pages, cover long historical periods, and contain a wealth of information and illustrations. Therefore, the book is a must read for everybody interested in the industrialization of the Campine region, the development of the Flemish coast, and/or the development of the Antwerp Ringscape. Part 1 presents the case of the industrialization of the Campine region which demonstrates how the 'side-effects' of the development of a canal system became dominant over the original objectives of transforming a desolate area into fertile agricultural land and offering militarily protection. While digging the canals the richness of the soil was discovered setting in motion relatively sophisticated forms of industrial activity whereby labourers were often housed in proximity to the factories. Part 1 also describes how the canals were in later periods complemented by other forms of infrastructure (e.g., (light) railways, highways) satisfying the need for other forms of mobility creating interesting synergies. The long historical perspective adopted by Van Acker illustrates how infrastructure on the one hand lags behind economic developments, but, on the other hand also creates new economic activities in unexpected ways.\n\nDrawing on Marx’s approach to original accumulation at the dawn of capitalism, I characterize the waves of parliamentary enclosures that unfolded in England between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries as an exercise of original or ex-novo extended urbanization—an initial stage in the subsumption of non-urban realms under specifically capitalist modes of uneven spatial development, involving new divisions of labor, distributional systems for raw materials and commodities, political and cultural formations and so forth. Along with the economic, technical and infrastructural changes in this period, these waves of enclosure provided an opportunity to rescale the social fabric of rural enclaves, restructuring the linkages between city and countryside along a range of different dimensions. Non-urban, non-capitalist territories were increasingly subordinated to the operational landscapes of national and international trade networks, which in turn expanded across the globe as new resources circulated through the system. Such transformations undermined the relative autonomy of preexisting, comparatively self-contained lifeworlds in the countryside. Previous rural social structures that combined use-value oriented everyday routines and a relatively bounded, discrete sphere of market-oriented practices were superseded by an intensifying, potentially totalizing form of capitalist territorial organization. This transformation was achieved through a profound, spatially-driven alteration of property relations, spatial divisions of labor and forms of social reproduction that in turn hinged upon the concerted, systematic intervention of the state. The process of original extended urbanization thus reveals the violent, yet legally mediated operations of dispossession that constitute the new urban territories of capitalism. The bulk of this chapter is dedicated to the study of English parliamentary enclosure as a way to delve into broader questions regarding the nature and historical geographies of worldwide capitalist urbanization. Throughout this discussion, in investigating the extended landscapes of early capitalist urbanization, I also devote particular attention to the dialectic between original (ex-novo) and ongoing enclosure processes, which are conceived as two interdependent yet analytically specific moments linking past and present logics of spatial creative destruction, both within and outside of urban agglomerations. I argue that any investigation of the interplay between concentrated and extended urbanization also requires careful attention to both the ex-novo and ongoing dimensions of enclosure processes under capitalism."
