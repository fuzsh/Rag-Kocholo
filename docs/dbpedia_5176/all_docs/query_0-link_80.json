        "text": "Name\n\nUniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles means in English: \"Free University of Brussels\", but this translation is rarely used all the more since its Dutch-speaking counterpart, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, has the same meaning. Some facilities, shared by both universities, do use the name \"Brussels Free Universities\", abbreviated BFU. For example the Computing Center, BFUCC ([1]).\n\nåå²\n\nThe history of the UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles (ULB) is closely linked with that of Belgium itself. When the nine provinces that broke away from the Kingdom of the Netherlands formed the Belgian State in 1830, there were three state universities in the country: Ghent, Liege and Leuven. Even though Brussels had been promoted to the rank of capital, it still had no university.\n\nFor this reason, in 1831 a group of leading Brussels Masonic figures in the fields of the arts, science and education set themselves the objective of creating a university for the city. They had the choice between a state university and, failing that, a private institution, since the Belgian Constitution, the most liberal in Europe, allowed for this possibility.\n\nFinding the financial burden of the three existing universities too onerous, the Belgian government showed little enthusiasm for yet another state university. However, when in 1834 the episcopate decided to found the Catholic University at Mechelen, things began to happen very quickly. The liberal professions and Freemasons, lead by Pierre-ThÃ©odore Verhaegen and Auguste Baron, who were promoting the Brussels university project, stepped up their efforts, with the result that the Free University of Belgium, as it was originally known, inaugurated its first academic year on 20 November 1834.\n\nFrom 1836 it was to be called the UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles, but although the geographical term may have changed, the adjective \"free\" remained. This was a key point. [2]\n\nThe school's football (soccer) team won the bronze medal at the 1900 Summer Olympics.\n\nPierre-ThÃ©odore Verhaegen, who helped make the university, is the symbol of the creation of the university. November 20, called 'St V', is a holiday for students of both the UniversitÃ© Libre de Belgique and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\nSince 1935 some courses have been taught in both French and Dutch, but it was only in 1963 that all faculties held courses in both languages. Shortly after the language dispute at the Catholic University of Leuven, in October 1969 the French and Dutch entities of the ULB separated into two distinct universities. With the act of 28 May 1970, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel and the UniversitÃ© Libre de Bruxelles officially became two separate legal, administrative and scientific entities.\n\nCampi\n\nThe ULB comprises three main campi: the Campus de la Plaine in Ixelles, the Campus du Solbosch, on the territories of Brussels and Ixelles municipalities, in the Brussels-Capital Region and the Campus Erasme (faculty of medicine) in Anderlecht beside the Erasme Hospital but the university has also buildings and activities in Charleroi, Parentville, Treignes and Nivelles.\n\nFaculties, schools and institutes\n\nFaculty of Philosophy, and Letters\n\nFaculty of Law, and Criminological Science\n\nFaculty of Social and Political Sciences & Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management\n\nFaculty of Psychological Science, and of Education\n\nFaculty of Sciences (recently absorbed the Institute of Environment Gestion (IGEAT))\n\nInterfacultary School of Bio-Engineering\n\nFaculty of Medicine\n\nSchool of Public Health\n\nHigh institute of Physical Education, and Kinesitherapy\n\nInstitute of Pharmacy\n\nFaculty of Applied Sciences/Polytechnic School\n\nInstitute of Work Sciences\n\nInstitute of European Studies\n\nInstitute of Statistics and Operational Research\n\nNotable alumni\n\nAmer Husni Lutfi (b. 1956), economics, politician, Syrian minister of economy and trade.\n\nJules Anspach (1829â1879), law, politician, Mayor of Brussels.\n\nAmir Abbas Hoveida, Iranian Prime Minister\n\nCount Richard Goblet d'Alviella, Belgian businessman\n\nPhilippe Autier, epidemiologist and clinical oncologist\n\nZÃ©non-M.
