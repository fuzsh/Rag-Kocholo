        "text": "…announces the arrival of a powerful voice in American film – Cord Jefferson – who pens a new chapter in our understanding of how stories are told – and by whom. Jeffrey Wright delivers a triumphant performance with a lightning bolt of righteous rage and a thunderclap of humor – exploring the complexities of identity, hypocrisy and heartbreak. The film is further elevated by a peerless ensemble that demands we embrace a world beyond stereotype.\n\n…smashes the glass ceiling of cinema with the imaginative power of a child at play. Greta Gerwig and her talented creative ensemble bring a plastic icon to life in this tour de force – and tour de fun. Standing tall is Margot Robbie, who embodies an American “ideal” while releasing it from the shadows of heels and history – and, ultimately, asking us all to consider what we were made for. And then there’s Ken. Nice work, Ryan.\n\n…flips back the pages of a calendar to present a timeless portrait of humanity. Driven by the deepest of emotions and iced with a wicked wit, Alexander Payne achieves the extraordinary – creating a world we have all lived in – with feelings we have all experienced. Paul Giamatti’s hilariously humbug performance further etches his place in the pantheon and stellar turns from Da’Vine Joy Randolph and newcomer Dominic Sessa become family to our own in this seasonal treat as cozy as it is curmudgeonly.\n\n…finds unexplored territory for a modern master – and it’s a narrative Martin Scorsese claims with the Osage Nation. As this poisonous picture of America’s past unfolds, audiences will be left in awe at the evolution of the art form as they experience the performances of Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio – and the illumination of Lily Gladstone, who breathes new spirits to life.\n\n…commands the rapturous applause of a global audience – and then pauses in profound silence to consider the role of “performance” in both art and life. It is time for Bradley Cooper to take his well-earned bow – both for his insightful, incisive direction and for his transformative performance as Leonard Bernstein. And a billion bravas to Carey Mulligan, who raises the film to high art by embodying the complexities of marriage – and love – and life.\n\n…proves the power of Todd Haynes as an American provocateur – with Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore facing off in a mesmerizing mirror dance that reflects Hollywood’s thirst to embody the complex humanity behind the most tawdry of tabloid tales. Charles Melton is exquisitely understated as the victim to both, who quietly brings them together as one, in a world masked by perfection and marked by “what grown-ups do.”\n\n…detonates a moral quandary – rare in the days when superheroes have all the answers. Christopher Nolan’s blinding look at this flashpoint in American history aches with the consequences of achievement and explodes beyond the screen to register a new standard in film biographies. At its core stands Cillian Murphy, who embodies an enigma with rich complexity – while orbited by powerhouse performances from a peerless all-star cast.\n\n…celebrates cosmic connections – both found and lost. Bruising and brilliant, this masterful debut by director Celine Song explores the Korean concept of In-Yun – are two meant to be one? It’s a story that will not leave you – in this life or into the next.\n\n…expands the mind with the richest of imaginations – all the while pushing the boundaries of emotion with phantasmagoric flair. Emma Stone redefines the modern movie star in a fearless performance that demands audiences heed the power of women in a world of man-made monsters. And because Yorgos Lanthimos is at the helm – the horror is hilarious.\n\n…teaches us how it’s done. Quinta Brunson revitalizes the beloved sitcom format with undeniable optimism as it tackles the topics of our day. At the series’ heart is an ensemble of teachers – both heroic and hilarious – who, like their real-life counterparts in public education, struggle selflessly against a system stacked against them to find promise for our future.\n\n…turns up the heat in its second year. The dysfunction of family continues to flavor Christopher Storer’s spectacular series, and this season ventures beyond the tension of its high-pressure kitchen for a scalding examination of the ties that bind. Jeremy Allen White leads a brilliant ensemble that expanded this year to include some of the very best guest appearances on television.\n\n…sizzles with vindictive indignation – a razor-sharp satire first catalyzed by rage, which then widens its focus to reveal a frenzied world where all battle to embrace intellect over emotion – and often fail. The endlessly entertaining motivations for retaliation are powder kegs lit by creator Lee Sung Jin – and the chemistry of Ali Wong and Steven Yeun, whether in conflict or in concert, is explosive.\n\n…is first-rate television. With a narrative born from an infectious video game, Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann expertly expand the boundaries of each character, organically triggering deeply human fears that still run rampant in our post-pandemic world. Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey’s found family provide the beating heart to this post-apocalyptic adventure that finds hope – and connection – as our only means of survival.\n\n…rises like the sun in the world of top-tier television. Jay Carson’s sophisticated series was born in the world of #MeToo and continues to grow and flourish with a finger on the pulse of today’s world news. Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon anchor a stellar ensemble fighting for relevance – and to maintain integrity – in a for-profit world.\n\n…ends its reign at Shakespearean heights – and enters American history as a king in the television kingdom. Bold and blistering up to its scorched-earth finale, Jesse Armstrong’s dynastic conflict continued to battle large, even in the physical absence of its omnipresent patriarch. With acting, writing and direction at their finest, the knife-twist ending leaves no real winners – except for the audience.\n\nAFI AWARDS was created in 2000 to recognize the films and television programs which contribute to our collective cultural legacy. When placed in an historical context, these stories provide a complex, rich, visual record of our modern world. Since then, AFI AWARDS has honored 10 outstanding films and 10 outstanding TV programs deemed culturally and artistically representative of the year’s most significant achievements in the art of the moving image.\n\nUnique in its celebration of the art form’s collaborative nature, AFI AWARDS is the only national program that honors creative teams as a whole – recognizing those in front of and behind the camera.\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\n\nHonorees are selected based on works which:\n\nAdvance the art of the moving image\n\nInspire audiences and artists alike\n\nEnhance the rich cultural heritage of America’s art form\n\nA UNIQUE JURY PROCESS\n\nAFI AWARDS selections are made through AFI’s unique jury process – in which scholars, artists, critics and AFI Trustees determine the most outstanding achievements of the year.\n\nFor additional information about AFI AWARDS, contact Josh Kushins at [email protected]."
