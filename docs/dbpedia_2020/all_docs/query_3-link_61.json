        "text": "PITTSBURGH – Pollock Begg Associate Lindsay A. Nemit recently earned certification for mediation, joining four of her colleagues at the Pittsburgh family law practice in offering this specialized service to clients.\n\nMediation is an alternative dispute resolution option where the parties jointly hire a mediator to assist them in working out a mutually satisfactory divorce agreement. In many cases, the mediation process saves clients time and money, and eliminates the need to go to court.\n\nNemit completed 40 hours of training through The Conflict Lab and Behrend Mediation Services to earn the certification. Combined with her experience and training in collaborative law, the new certification allows Nemit to offer clients a wide range of options beyond traditional litigation.\n\n“There is no one-size-fits-all solution in family law; every family’s dynamics and needs are unique,” Nemit said. “It’s our duty to provide tools and options to best serve them, and to do so with empathy and understanding.”\n\nNemit earned 2024 Best Lawyers in America: Ones To Watch recognition, an honor given to attorneys who exhibit outstanding professional excellence in private practice early in their careers. She was spotlighted by Best Lawyers for her expertise in family law and alternative dispute resolution.\n\nIn addition to her mediation certification, she was trained and certified in collaborative family law by the Collaborative Law Association of Southwestern Pennsylvania and participates in the International Academy of Collaborative Professionals. She is a graduate of Allegheny County Bar Association’s Young Lawyers Division Bar Leadership Initiative program and is serving a three-year term on the ACBA’s Family Law Section Council.\n\nAlong with Nemit, partners Stephanie L. Jablon, Candice L. Komar and Brian C. Vertz and Associate Megan A. DelVecchio also are certified mediators. Pollock Begg attorneys always strive to meet clients’ legal needs while respecting their privacy, financial resources and time. In addition to the firm’s strong mediation options, several attorneys have specialized training and experience in collaborative law and arbitration, rounding out the firm’s robust alternative dispute resolution offerings.\n\nAbout Pollock Begg\n\nA progressive and powerful influencer in the legal marketplace, Pittsburgh-based Pollock Begg focuses on innovative, team-oriented solutions to resolve domestic relations matters.
