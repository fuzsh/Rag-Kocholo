Mellon Foundation. —Maximilíano Durón\n\nWednesday, April 15\n\nSobey Art Awards Alters Prize Structure in Face of Coronavirus\n\nEach year since 2002, the Sobey Art Awards has recognized one Canadian artist under 40 with a $100,000 prize, with additional funds given to shortlisted artists and those on its longlist. This year, in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which has threatened the livelihood of many artists, the award’s facilitator, the National Gallery of Canada, said it would instead give $25,000 CAD to each of the 25 artists it had selected from its longlist from a pool of 100 nominations. Artists receiving the funds include Sara Cwynar, Lou Sheppard, Caroline Monnet, Zadie Xa, and Joseph Tisiga. The award cycle each year also includes an exhibition of the work of the five shortlisted artists, a gala, and a residency for the winner, all of which have also been canceled for this year. In a statement, the National Gallery’s director Sasha Suda said, “By altering this year’s program, the 2020 Sobey Art Award is contributing to the short and long-term preservation of Canada’s contemporary art ecosystem in the face of the unknown.” —Maximilíano Durón\n\nTomm El-Saieh Is Now Represented by Luhring Augustine\n\nTwo years after appearing in the 2018 New Museum Triennial, Miami-based artist Tomm El-Saieh has joined the roster of New York’s Luhring Augustine gallery, which also represents Lygia Clark, Ragnar Kjartansson, Pipilotti Rist, Christopher Wool, and others. El-Saieh creates abstractions that refer to the artist’s Haitian heritage, and he will continue to be represented by Miami’s Central Fine gallery.\n\nTuesday, April 14\n\nArt Paris Cancels 2020 Edition\n\nAfter hoping to stage this year’s edition, the Art Paris fair announced that it would cancel the 2020 iteration, which was to bring together 150 galleries to the French capital. It had originally postponed its early April run until the end of May as the new coronavirus concern forced governments around the world in March to prohibit large gatherings of people. In a statement, the organizers said that they had considered a further postponement until July as a way “to keep our hopes up until the very last minute,” and as a way for its exhibitors to be able to “meet their collectors after a spring period of complete standstill.” Art Paris said that it will offer an online version of the fair in the coming weeks, and that it plans to return as an in-person event in April 2021, this time to the temporary Grand Palais structure while the original one undergoes renovations for the 2024 Summer Olympics. —Maximilíano Durón\n\nMonday, April 13\n\nPortland Art Museum Places 168 Staff Members on Unpaid Leave\n\nDue to financial fallout precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic, the Portland Art Museum in Oregon will put 80 percent of its staff on unpaid leave.

Paul Getty Museum—comprising its two locations, the Getty Center in L.A.’s Brentwood neighborhood and the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades—said that all of its public programs and events scheduled through the end of August have been postponed. In a statement, the museum said it called off months of programming because of uncertainty over when bans on large social gatherings in California would be lifted. The two spaces have been closed since March 14, and the museum has not yet announced any layoffs. (Earlier this month, the affiliated Getty Trust established a $10 million relief fund to help sustain other L.A.-based arts organizations through their temporary closures.) The Getty also said that it is unable to make decisions about its exhibition programming, including whether current exhibitions might be extended and future ones postponed, until it can determine a reopening date. —Maximilíano Durón\n\nRoberts Projects Now Represents Wangari Mathenge\n\nRoberts Projects gallery in Los Angeles has added Chicago-based artist Wangari Mathenge to its roster. Mathenge is best known for bold, emotive paintings which foreground the black female experience.

According to a report in Monopol, as of now the main damage seems to be in the ceiling of a passageway, which would mostly like have to be replaced. The fire broke out at 10 a.m. on April 8 when two containers with poured asphalt caught fire and exploded. Two workers were injured in the fire and one has returned to work. The damaged area is still closed off for an internal investigation, but local authorities announced at the time that they do not believe foul play caused the fire.\n\nADVERTISING\n\nContent Courtesy of: adweek.com\n\nWritten by: David Cohen\n\nFacebook’s Newest Ad Shows How Groups Are ‘Still Going Strong’ During Covid-19\n\nThe Facebook app’s More Together campaign continues, with a relatable update\n\nFacebook continued to put its promotional muscle behind its groups feature with Still Going Strong, the latest spot in its More Together campaign.\n\nFacebook’s Creative X team created the spot in partnership with Wieden + Kennedy London and Portland.\n\nGroups moved up Facebook’s priority list with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s declaration that “The future is private.

Coors Light is offering a solution for folks who need a break from meeting calls and virtual town halls but don’t want their team to know they ditched.\n\nThe beer brand teamed with agency Leo Burnett to launch the Coors Light Clone Machine. The project, available on a custom microsite, invites people to record 30-second looping videos of themselves acting engaged in a conversation.\n\nThe recording coaches users on how to look attentive with tips for nodding, acting like you’re taking notes and making “good point” gestures. Coors Light encourages people to download their recordings and upload them as videoconferencing backgrounds in place of themselves, encouraging them to enjoy a beer instead. Fans can also share the looping videos on social media.\n\nLiz Taylor, global CCO at Leo Burnett, said the idea was sparked by a cultural insight that workers are suffering from Zoom fatigue after two months of working from home during the pandemic.\n\n“Coors Light is all about bringing moments of reprieve and chill,” Taylor said. “This seemed like the perfect moment for the brand to help people dealing with Zoom overload and offer some levity.”\n\nLeo Burnett worked with marketing and tech agency Digitas to create the recording feature on the site, which will be available indefinitely.\n\nFor those nervous about whether or not you can trick your coworkers, it really depends on how convincing you make your digital clone. Adriano Matos, evp and ecd of Leo Burnett, said his background managed to go unnoticed for about 10 minutes in a production meeting this week.\n\nIn addition to the humorous project, Coors Light also launched its frank “#CouldUseABeer” campaign in April, which acknowledges the time we’re living in simply sucks.

Stanley\n\nAs the Meat Industry Stumbles, Here’s How Plant-Based Brands Are Stepping Up Their Game\n\nExclusive: Faux-meat marketers are keeping it positive, but expanding their footprint aggressively\n\nKey Insights:\n\nCovid-19 has rattled the supply lines of meatpacking and put the industry under a microscope.</p.\n\nAlternative meats are a clear winner in quarantine, with sales up 454%.\n\nFor these brands, giving back to those in need is ‘more important than ever.'</p.\n\nPlant-based proteins are nearing the $1 billion mark, but meat is still a $50 billion dominator.\n\nCovid-19 outbreaks have shuttered meatpacking plants throughout the American Midwest, spurring a perfect storm of negative chatter around the meat industry. In addition to highlighting short-term meat shortages and higher prices, news reports are exposing the industry’s harsh conditions for workers and animals.\n\nSuch a moment could be a perfect time for plant-based protein marketers to tell the American consumer, “We told you so.”\n\nBut the biggest players in the faux meat world, namely Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, have no plans to go for the jugular with PETA-style attacks against the meat industry. In fact, they’re taking the marketing equivalent of the high road, emphasizing their stepped-up availability via grocery stores and restaurant delivery, at a time when it might be tough to get a burger at Wendy’s.\n\nRather than highlighting the ominous debate around the supply lines of beef, chicken and pork, the meat-alternative brands are leaning into their charitable programs and promoting their original content, virtual events, new family-sized retail packages, direct-to-consumer channels and just-launched discounts. They’re still emphasizing their meat-like flavor, but pushing their earth-friendly and nutritional messages further to the fore amid rising consumer interest in those priorities.\n\nThe meatless marketers’ light-but-still-aggressive approach isn’t entirely magnanimous. They also don’t want to appear to be capitalizing on their competitors’ misfort\n\nBut they do have plenty of their own gains to tout, which includes skyrocketing demand that Nielsen pegs at a 278% increase in sales of plant-based meat substitutes since this time last year.\n\nSome recent quarantine periods have seen even more dramatic boosts for the sector, per Nielsen: In the week ending March 21, sales of meat alternatives grew 454% compared to a 100% bump in real meat sales.\n\nAs Zak Weston, foodservice expert at the nonprofit Good Food Institute, puts it, faux meat marketers don’t need to talk about animal mistreatment, Covid-19 cases among slaughterhouse workers or rising beef prices. Every major news outlet is taking the lead there, as the White House has declared the meatpacking industry an essential business and tried to send workers back to factory floors.\n\nBut plant-based protein brands as varied as Tofurky and Dr. Praeger’s can use this backdrop, with its meat shortages and retail rationing, to tell their stories to a more broadly receptive audience.\n\nWe’re seeing the inherent fragility of the conventional animal protein chain laid bare,” Weston says. “That’s presenting unique opportunities for plant-based brands to show their advantages and the ways they can compete with the big players in animal protein.\n\nSome recent quarantine periods have seen even more dramatic boosts for the sector, per Nielsen: In the week ending March 21, sales of meat alternatives grew 454% compared to a 100% bump in real meat sales.\n\nAs Zak Weston, foodservice expert at the nonprofit Good Food Institute, puts it, faux meat marketers don’t need to talk about animal mistreatment, Covid-19 cases among slaughterhouse workers or rising beef prices.

(This, after starting its consumer journey at tony eateries like David Chang’s Momofuku and Michael Symon’s B Spot cafes.)\n\nAll those channels have suffered because of the Covid-19 lockdown, sending Impossible and other restaurant suppliers scurrying to make up the difference.\n\nThe brand had already set its sights on supermarkets (traditionally the stronghold of competitor Beyond), launching its faux ground beef last fall in specialty retailers like Gelson’s.\n\nNow Impossible is taking its grocery presence to a new level with its just-announced partner: Kroger, which will stock the brand in 1,700 stores. Having started the year with about 150 stores, Impossible is on a distribution roll (2,700 doors and counting), expecting to “expand more than 50-fold in 2020,” says Jessica Appelgren, vp of communications for the brand. Combined with a fresh $500 million funding round and partnerships with DTC apps like Cheetah, the retail growth is expected to help make up some of the loss from closed restaurants.\n\nFacebook Acquires Giphy, Which Will Become Part of Instagram\n\nThe GIF platform’s library and APIs will continue to be available to ‘the wider ecosystem\n\nContent Courtesy of: adweek.com\n\nWritten by: David Cohen\n\nFacebook has acquired Giphy, and will fold the a GIF library and creator platform into its Instagram team.\n\nNeither company would confirm financial terms of the deal, reportedly worth $400 million, according to Axios.\n\nGiphy said the majority of its team will join Instagram, and senior director of communications Natalie Vegel added, “For those employees who will not be joining Instagram, we’ve taken extra steps to provide them with generous severance packages in order to ensure as much of a smooth career transition path as possible.”\n\nThe Giphy staff making the move will eventually relocate to Instagram’s offices in New York (Giphy is also headquartered in the city), but the timing has yet to be determined.\n\n“By bringing Instagram and Giphy together, we can make it easier for people to find the perfect GIFs and stickers in Stories and Direct,” said Facebook vp of product Vishal Shah in a Newsroom post. “Both our services are big supporters of the creator and artist community, and that will continue.”\n\nAlready, 50% of Giphy’s traffic comes from Facebook’s group of applications, with Instagram alone accounting for 50% of its parent company’s overall traffic, Shah said.\n\nGiphy’s library will remain widely available, as will its application programming interfaces and software development kits for third-party developers and partners. The library is extensive: Since making its debut in February 2013, Giphy has grown the database to “several trillion” GIFs.\n\n“[F]or our API/SDK partners and developers: Giphy’s GIFs, stickers, emojis, etc. aren’t going anywhere. We will continue to make Giphy openly available to the wider ecosystem,” Giphy said in a blog post, Snapchat and Twitter declined to comment on whether their relationships with Giphy would be affected by the transaction.\n\nTwitter integrated Giphy into its tweet composer in February 2016, enabling users to add GIFs to tweets, while Snapchat did the same in February 2018.\n\n“We’ve had a lot of fun teaming up with Instagram over the years; Giphy’s stickers were the perfect fit for layering on Instagram Stories, while our GIF search allowed everyone to capture that perfect emotion in Instagram’s DMs,” Giphy said. “Based on the success of those collaborations (and many others), we know that there are exciting times ahead of us.”\n\nAt the beginning of last year, Giphy had planned to ramp up its advertising capabilities to compete for digital ad dollars with the likes of Google and its now-parent company Facebook.\n\n“No one’s been able to figure out an intent-based marketing platform,” Giphy founder and CEO Alex Chung told Adweek at the time\n\nTECH\n\nContent Courtesy of: mashable.com\n\nWritten by: BRENDA STOLYAR\n\nApple Maps can now help you find COVID-19 testing sites across the U.S.\n\nUPDATE: April 28, 2020, 4:01 p.m. EDT Users in the U.S. and Puerto Rico can now use Apple Maps to find Covid-19 testing locations.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, 9to5Mac reported that Apple Maps was in the process of adding a feature that allowed users to find Covid-19 testing sites from within the app.\n\nOn Tuesday, 9to5Mac reported that the tool is now officially live in both the United States and Puerto Rico. Anyone using Apple Maps can now search for where they can get tested for Covid-19 and view nearby locations on the map.\n\nApproved testing locations appear on Apple Maps with a red medical glyph icon. Towards the bottom of the display, the location is specifically labeled as a Covid-19 testing site.\n\nYou can see all the standard details of the testing site like its address, phone number, and website, as well as directions on how to get there.\n\nBut you can also see additional details like the type of site (drive-through, parking lot, or building), along with whether you’ll need an appointment or referral.\n\nApple is currently allowing healthcare providers, hospitals, and other businesses to submit an application for their specific testing locations. Once a location is approved, it’ll appear right on Apple Maps.\n\nThe portal to fill out an application is currently live. All providers need to do is download the application, fill it out, and email the file to Apple for review.\n\nWith the coronavirus outbreak still growing and testing sites popping up little by little, it’s tough to keep track of exactly where to access a test. So hopefully, this feature will expand to a lot more countries very soon.\n\nLG’s ‘Velvet’ phone is the start to the company’s revamped design strategy\n\nContent Courtesy of: mashable.com\n\nWritten by: BRENDA STOLYAR\n\nIt’s getting tough to tell new smartphones apart from the old ones based solely on the number in their titles. Which is why LG is ditching the concept entirely by naming its latest phone the LG Velvet.\n\nIn a press release, LG explained the Velvet is the first device that will launch as part of its new branding strategy. Specifically it’s “moving away from alphanumerical designations in favor of familiar and expressive names,” and emphasizing design instead.\n\nI’m glad all of this is coming from a company that named their last phone the LG V60 ThinQ. It’s something that I avoid saying out loud at all costs because it’s truly a mouthful.\n\nBut the new design strategy also means any plans for the LG G9 ThinQ have clearly been scrapped. The new phone was supposed to be a follow up to last year’s LG G8 ThinQ, which was part of its G-series lineup of devices.\n\nAccording to Korean news site Naver, the G9 would’ve been a midrange device rather than a flagship like the G8 as it’s apparently supposed to include the Snapdragon 765 chipset complete with 5G connectivity.\n\nNow, these specs are reportedly reserved for the Velvet instead. Which also means it’ll have an affordable price tag.\n\nThe phone will also have a minimalistic design that’s a lot different from what we’ve seen from LG recently.\n\nFor starters, LG is introducing a “3D Arc Design”, which means the edges of the display are symmetrically curved to allow for a more natural and comfortable grip.\n\nOn the back of the phone is something called a “Raindrop” camera. The triple cameras and LED flash are stacked on top of one another in descending order from largest to smallest, which is supposed to mimic the look of falling raindrops.\n\nLG says the main camera sits “slightly” above the surface while the other two camera lenses are kept under smooth glass. That way, there’s no annoying camera bump.\n\nWe saw a somewhat similar design back at CES this year, when OnePlus debuted its Concept One phone with disappearing lenses. Like the LG Velvet, the camera sensors also sit beneath the glass.\n\nEssentially, the raindrop camera module is supposed to take up less space while also providing a smoother feel and sleeker look.\n\nLG remains tight lipped on any specs and features though.\n\nThe launch date remains a mystery as well. But Naver reports we could see the phone revealed on May 15, which isn’t that far away.\n\nCULTURE\n\nContent Courtesy of: mashable.com\n\nWritten by: NANDITA RAGHURAM\n\n‘SNL’ Zoom call spoof highlights hilarious pains of video conferences\n\nWe’ve all been in this Zoom call.\n\nIn this Saturday Night Live sketch, highlighting a piece of technology that has quickly taken over our lives, Aidy Bryant and Kate McKinnon play two incompetent receptionists.

Amazon said it’s letting new customers in each week, so monitor your email inbox if you’ve signed up.\n\nThe Amazon Fresh home page will display available delivery windows each day for anyone who’s able to actually use the service. In normal times, you put together your cart and just choose the time that is most convenient for you. Now, you’ll have to choose a delivery time first, and you’ll only know when one is available by checking the website that day.\n\nWhole Foods workers will also see some changes. Store hours are being adjusted to allow for increased restocking and some stores are actually going to focus exclusively on online deliveries. One store in Woodland Hills, California, for example, will only serve online customers on a temporary basis.\n\nAmazon also noted the safety protocols it has implemented in the wake of the coronavirus, such as glass shields for cashiers and gloves and masks for retail workers. Whole Foods workers went on strike two weeks ago to demand better protections from their parent company. That followed a similar strike by Amazon warehouse workers, who felt the company was lax in its response to the fact that several of them tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\n6 ways to reduce food waste, even during a pandemic\n\nContent Courtesy of: mashable.com\n\nWritten by: SIOBHAN NEELA-STOCK\n\nBy now, you’ve probably seen photos of people panic buying groceries and shelves laid bare. In mid-March, you might have even been one of these panic buyers; I certainly was. But weeks later, as pounds of beans and rice lay unused on shelves, many of us may be thinking “what am I going to do with all this food?”\n\nPanic-buying, like the type that can occur during a pandemic, can prompt people to purchase perishable items that they aren’t able to consume before they go bad, which can ultimately lead to food waste, says Brian Lipinski, a researcher on food waste at the World Resources Institute.\n\nMoreover, many of the country’s largest farms are throwing out fresh food that they’re unable to sell due to restaurant, school, and hotel closures, according to the New York Times.\n\nEven in normal circumstances, it’s easy to waste food. In the U.S. about 30 to 40 percent of our food goes to waste, according to estimates from the USDA’s Economic Research Service. What’s more, Americans waste about one pound of food per person every day, according to a separate study conducted by USDA researchers published in 2018.\n\n“It seems like such an obvious thing, don’t waste food. It’s something we learned growing up. So it seems like it should be a no-brainer to stop it,” explains Lipinski.\n\nIt’s not that simple, though. We often don’t realize we’re getting rid of food and it’s easy to dissociate spoiled food from its edible origins.\n\n“Once you take out the moldy piece of bread or the gross, mushy carrot from your fridge and have to throw it away, you’re not thinking of that as something you can eat or really that you were ever going to eat,” explains Lipinski.\n\nWATCH: Turning your ugly vegetables into beautiful works of art\n\nWith than in mind, it’s time to rethink your food habits. The pandemic provides good opportunity to make the most of our food since we want to avoid frequent trips to the grocery store, says Lipinski. Limiting trips to potentially crowded places like the grocery store can help minimize the spread of coronavirus and reduce food waste.\n\nMashable spoke with experts to get tips on how we can all put our food to better use.\n\nTrack what you waste\n\nTracking exactly what you throw in the trash and rinse down the sink will help you realize what kind of food and how much of it you waste, says Beth Gingold, the founder of Recycle Leaders LLC, which works with organizations to help them recycle and reduce their waste (including food).\n\n“A lot of waste happens just because we’re not paying attention to it,” explains Gingold.\n\nOnce you know your “waste patterns,” you can be more strategic about what you buy. When Gingold did this, she learned she bought too many onions. Ultimately, she was able to change her shopping habits and now wastes less.\n\nAll you have to do is record how much food you waste per day for about two weeks (or longer if you can keep that up), says Gingold. This duration is based off of the EPA’s Food: Too Good To Waste Toolkit, which teaches people how to waste less food. Gingold is leading Recycle Leaders’ Team Up on Food Waste @ Home remote competition, which encourages people to reduce their food waste at home.\n\nRecycle Leaders only requires participants to measure their food waste for seven days, which is enough time to get someone in the habit of thinking about what they are throwing away, Gingold wrote in an email. That said, ideally people would collect this data for longer as a seven-day period doesn’t necessarily reflect all the food purchased and discarded during a week, she explains. Additionally, people don’t necessarily throw away food on a daily basis as they may clean out their refrigerator once a month.\n\nThe good news is you don’t need any fancy equipment to measure your food waste. Measuring cups, empty food containers or jars work well, says Gingold.\n\nYou can also take photos. When Anne-Marie Bonneau, who writes the zero-waste cooking blog Zero-Waste Chef, went plastic-free in 2011, she had her daughter take photos of the plastic they accumulated every week. It made them both more aware of what items they were buying with plastic.\n\n“Keep a diary of what you’re wasting, and then you look at it and you go, ‘oh wow, I had no idea’…and then you can come up with a plan,” says Bonneau.\n\nLists, lists, and more lists\n\nBefore you head to the grocery store, do an inventory of what food you have and try and cook something with it,” suggests Bonneau.\n\n“You’ll not only reduce food waste, you’ll also make fewer trips to the store,” says Bonneau.\n\nYou can also make a list of the perishable food items in your refrigerator and tape it to the door.\n\n“That way, we don’t end up shoving some lettuce or carrots to the back of a drawer and forgetting about them,” says Lipinski.\n\nOnce that’s done, break out a pen and paper (or your phone) and make a food list before going to the grocery store. It seems like a no-brainer, but not doing so may lead to buying — and ultimately wasting — food you don’t need.\n\n“Hopefully, you’ll avoid some of the temptations of walking through the store and being like, ‘oh, I need 10 packs of ramen, eight apples, and three loaves of bread,'” says Lipinski.\n\nUnderstand food labels\n\nFood date labels can be really confusing for consumers, as there are a ton of different phrases that all mean something different. People are understandably concerned about eating something past the listed date, even if it’s not an expiration date, says Lipinski.\n\nBelow is a break down of terms you’ve probably encountered. We pulled examples of commonly-used food date labels and their definitions from the USDA’s website to help you avoid throwing away something that’s still edible.\n\nBest if used by/before: indicates when a product will be of its best flavor or quality. But it doesn’t tell the consumer when they should buy or eat it.\n\nSell by: tells the grocery store how long to display the food for sale. But it doesn’t mean you have to eat it by that date.\n\nFreeze by: indicates when food should be frozen to maintain its highest quality. But it doesn’t mean you have to buy or use it by that date.\n\nUse by: indicates the last recommended date to use the food while it’s at its peak quality but it doesn’t need to be consumed by that date (except for infant formula).\n\nIf any of that is confusing, don’t worry. You can rely on your senses when it comes to any potentially spoiled food, says Lipinski. Food can go bad before its listed date or last beyond that depending on how the product has been packed and stored. You should look out for signs of spoiled food, such as if there’s an off odor, flavor, or texture, according to the USDA’s website. So don’t be afraid to sniff your milk if you suspect it’s gone bad.\n\nBoth Lipinski and Gingold also recommend the website EatorToss, if you’re unsure if food is safe to eat. About once a week, EatorToss posts a photo of food (such as a raw potato with black discoloration) with a science-based explanation if you should eat or toss it, according to the website.\n\nUse refrigerators and freezers wisely\n\nThere are a few things you can do with your refrigerator and freezer to cut down on food waste.\n\nFirst, ensure your refrigerator is at its recommended temperature setting to help food stay cold enough, says Lipinski. The FDA recommends setting your refrigerator at or below 40° F. You can refer to your user’s manual to find steps to maintain that temperature.\n\n“The back of the fridge tends to be cooler than the front because every time you open the door more cold air escapes from the front,” explains Lipinski. So place any highly-perishable food like milk and meat toward the back to help it stay fresh for longer. You can place less-perishable foods like condiments on the door. That said, if you have a fridge with ice-making compartments up top, it’ll be coldest there, according to BBC Science Focus.\n\nYou should also take advantage of your freezer.\n\n“It’s great to have fresh foods in your life but frozen vegetables and fruit are a great alternative, still very nutritious, and they keep longer,” says Lipinski. Frozen vegetables are usually cheaper too, explains Lipinski. So if you’re on a tight budget due to coronavirus-related layoffs or other reasons, frozen produce might be a better choice.\n\nYou can also cook a lot of food at once and freeze it, suggests Bonneau. This can reduce the amount of food you waste as you don’t have to worry about it going bad and makes for a quick meal when you don’t feel like cooking.\n\nShare extra food with neighbors\n\nIf you find yourself with excess food that you won’t be able to cook in time before it goes bad, consider giving it to your neighbors, especially those who are elderly or immunocompromised as they’re at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-18, according to the CDC.\n\nBut you’ll want to do this in a safe way so you don’t jeopardize their health or yours. To get the word out, you can put up signs in your apartment building or neighborhood along with your phone number so you don’t have to come face-to-face with anyone. You can also try emailing them, if you have that info, says Lipinski. To drop off the food safely, you can leave the food at your neighbor’s door and alert them once you’ve left, he explains.\n\nPut food scraps to use\n\nAnyone who cooks has almost certainly run into the dilemma of having odds and ends they don’t know what to do with or are about to go bad.\n\nThere’s a lot you can do with food scraps that you might otherwise throw out. Here are some of Bonneau’s suggestions:\n\nApple scraps: You can turn apple scraps into vinegar. Bonneau explains how to do this here.\n\nUnused cabbage: Turn it into sauerkraut with just a cutting board, a knife, bowl, and glass jars. Here’s Bonneau’s blog post that details the process. You can actually ferment any vegetables you’re not going to use before they spoil, explains Bonneau.\n\nKale stems: Chop them up and add to fried rice, stir fry, frittatas, and soup. You can also make them into pesto if you add garlic, nuts, olive oil, salt, and if desired, nutritional yeast or cheese to taste.\n\nBroccoli stems: Instead of tossing them, peel and use them just like florets.\n\nLeek greens: People mostly use the white part and toss the greens. Bonneau cuts them into small pieces and uses them when she wants a strong onion flavor in a dish.\n\nWilting vegetables: You can try to perk up vegetables like limp celery, carrots, broccoli, asparagus, and some herbs by standing them in a jar of water. And you can shock lettuce and spinach back to life in a bowl of ice water.\n\nCheese rinds: Save these for tossing into soup or broth as they add umami.\n\nWhey from making yogurt or cheese: If you have leftover whey, use that in pizza dough, bread dough, soup, or quick breads to add flavor.\n\nCitrus peels: Bonneau always keeps some zest in the freezer to add to quick breads and cookies. You can also make an all-purpose cleaner by soaking citrus peels in vinegar for a couple weeks, then straining and diluting the vinegar with water.\n\nStale bread: Turn stale bread into bread crumbs, croutons, or French toast. You can also tear the bread up and toss it into minestrone soup.\n\nLeftovers (homemade and take-out): If you can fool your diners into thinking that they’re eating a new meal, they’ll be less likely to turn their noses up at your repurposed leftovers, Bonneau said. If you make chili one night, for example, cook it down until it’s thick, make a pastry, fill the pastry with the chili, and bake it. Now you have a hand pie. Or if you roast vegetables one night, put them in an omelette the next morning. If you cook rice as a side dish one night, make fried rice the next with any vegetables that need to be eaten.\n\n“The beauty of leftover food is you don’t have to start from scratch for every meal. You already have something on hand that can be reincarnated into something new,” Bonneau told Mashable.\n\nART\n\nContent Courtesy of: artnews.com\n\nWritten by: ALEX GREENBERGER\n\nPrized Van Gogh Painting Stolen from Dutch Museum Closed Because of Coronavirus\n\nVincent van Gogh, The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring, 1884.\n\nHANDOUT/MARTEN DE LEEUW/EPA-EFE/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nOn Monday morning, an alarm went off at the Singer Laren museum in the Netherlands. When guards rushed over to check what had tripped it, they discovered that something terrible had happened: a prized painting by Vincent van Gogh was missing.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that a thief or thieves have made off with the Dutch Post-Impressionist’s 1884 painting The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring, which had been on loan to the Singer Laren from the Groninger Museum voor Stad en Lande in the Netherlands. Forensics specialists and experts are currently investigating the theft, which took place while the museum was temporarily closed because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Exactly how the work was removed is still unclear, though local police said that whoever stole the work had to smash a glass door to gain access to the museum.\n\nan Rudolph de Lorm, the Singer Laren’s director, told AP, “It is very bad for the Groninger Museum, it is very bad for the Singer, but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us, the community, to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from, especially in these difficult times.”\n\nWhile the work’s value was not immediately announced by the Singer Laren or the Groninger Museum, the van Gogh painting is a valuable one made early in the artist’s career prior to his artistic breakthrough two years later in France. Parsonage Garden, which shows a brushy figure standing in a garden, with a church in the background, was made during a brief period when van Gogh lived in the Dutch city of Nuenen, where the artist’s father served as a pastor in a parish.\n\nLayoffs, Furloughs, and Pay Cuts: A Guide to Major U.S. Art Museums’ Coronavirus Closure Plans\n\nContent Courtesy of: artnews.com\n\nWritten by: ALEX GREENBERGER\n\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles laid off its entire part-time staff, with potential plans to rehire workers once the pandemic ends.\n\nMost major U.S. museums have said they will remain closed indefinitely because of the coronavirus. With operations grinding to a halt, institutions are beginning to announce layoffs and alterations to workers’ pay schedules. Below is a guide surveying those announcements.\n\nLast update: 3/31/20, 8:30 a.m.\n\nCalifornia\n\n— The Broad: The Los Angeles–based private museum will pay staff members who can’t work remotely until at least April 8.\n\n— Los Angeles County Museum of Art: Officials at one of L.A.’s biggest institutions plan to keep paying all hourly and part-time employees for the whole time the museum is closed.\n\n— Hammer Museum: On March 24, 150 part-time student workers were laid off at the Hammer. The museum said the laid-off workers would receive pay through April 10. (The Hammer is affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles, which will not hold classes on its campuses through at least early June.)\n\n— Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles: Also on March 24, MOCA laid off its entire part-time staff. With its part-time employees representing 97 people out of its 185-person staff, that means the museum cut its workforce in half. MOCA has said it is hoping to bring its part-time workers back after the closure ends. Laid-off employees are to be paid through the end of March.\n\n— San Francisco Museum of Modern Art: Working under the expectation that it will have to be closed through the end of June, the museum plans to lay off 135 on-call staff members on April 8. (These workers have been paid since the museum closed in mid-March.) And, starting on May 1, nearly 200 staff members will have their schedules reduced or will be furloughed. SFMOMA will continue to cover these employees’ health care benefits through June 30.\n\n— Yerba Buena Center for the Arts: The San Francisco museum has made a public commitment to pay its employees for as long as possible.\n\nMassachusetts\n\n— MASS MoCA: Based in North Adams, the museum said it would lay off 120 of its 165 employees. All employees will receive full payment through March 27. After that, until April 10, all workers will receive 70 percent of their normal pay. Laid-off employees will be covered by the museum’s health care plan through July 31.\n\nNew York\n\n— Metropolitan Museum of Art: Widely regarded as the role model for institutions across the nation, the Met has committed to paying all of its employees through April 4. At the end of March, the Met extended that deadline for payments until May 2, saying in a statement, “It is the best we can do in a rapidly evolving situation.” As of March 20, the museum was still considering whether it would have to lay off or furlough any employees.\n\nOhio\n\n— Akron Art Museum: Located an hour outside Cleveland, the museum said it would impose pay cuts—department heads’ wages would be cut by 10 percent, and another 12 employees would receive a 5 percent pay cut. Twelve more employees will be reclassified from full-time to part-time.\n\n— Cleveland Museum of Art: On March 26, the CMA said it would furlough all of its part-timers and cut the wages of all non-unionized staff by 11 percent–15 percent. Any forthcoming projects with contractors were suspended.\n\nPennsylvania\n\n— Carnegie Museums: The Pittsburgh-based consortium of museums—which includes the Carnegie Museum and the Andy Warhol Museum—said that it would furlough more than half of its employees. About 75 percent of those workers are part-timers.\n\nFrom Makeshift Studios to Webinars, the Art World Reinvents Itself Under Quarantine\n\nContent Courtesy of: artnews.com\n\nWritten by: ZACHARY SMALL\n\nAfter abruptly departing New York, where he is in school at Columbia University, M.F.A. student Joseph Liatela set up a makeshift studio in his sister’s garage.\n\nEven though there will probably come a time when the coronavirus pandemic recedes into memory, the economic shutdown caused by it is likely to impact the art industry for years to come. Last week, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment because of the pandemic. Thousands of those Americans work in the cultural sector for museums, galleries, art schools, and other cultural organizations.\n\nEven the wealthiest institutions are struggling to survive. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has projected a $100 million loss in revenue. Last week, the Carnegie Museums in Pittsburgh said it expected deficits of $1.4 million per month of closure. The consortium consequently announced pay cuts as high as 30 percent for senior staff and a temporary furlough for around 550 employees—just over half its workforce—for the anticipated two-month shutdown.\n\nBut most institutions operate on razor-thin budgets, and according to a 2018 survey by Southern Methodist University’s DataArts center, arts organizations have seen a decrease in working capital since 2013—meaning they lack the liquid assets necessary to cover operating costs.\n\nThe precarity the industry faces is best exemplified by the people behind it. Last week, ARTnews spoke with displaced artists, laid-off workers, and museum executives making tough decisions about their futures. These are their stories.\n\nAlexandra Ivanova\n\nFormer Hammer Museum employee based in Los Angeles\n\nTwo years ago, Alexandra Ivanova joined the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles as a frontline ambassador. She enjoyed welcoming visitors into the building and assisting with public programs; it was a welcome distraction from her science classes at UCLA that would help pay for graduate school. In September, the 21-year-old student was promoted to museum experience lead. This March, Ivanova was laid off alongside nearly 150 other student employees.\n\n“It’s sad because we know that the museum has the money,” she said, “but for the administration, saving costs seems more important than worker lives.”\n\nIvanova was especially worried about her immigrant colleagues who no longer have jobs and will not be able to access relief funds from the federal government because of their citizenship status. She estimates that about a third of her laid-off coworkers will be affected. “They don’t know what will happen, if they will be deported, or if they can find another source of income,” she added.\n\nAs a graduating senior who is financially independent, Ivanova worries about how she is going to pay rent. She is immunocompromised, which limits her ability to work during coronavirus. She had recently decided to matriculate into a public health masters program at Yale University, but now she might defer because of the costs.\n\n“I want some acknowledgment from the museum of the fact that it’s going to hurt a lot of people,” she said. “You are subjecting people to huge hardships in the middle of a literal plague.”\n\nMichelle Moon\n\nFormer Tenement Museum employee based in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, Michelle Moon was chief program officer at the Tenement Museum in Manhattan. She would wake up at 6:30 a.m. to prepare for her hour-long commute from New Jersey to the institution, and her high-velocity days there mostly consisted of meetings about how the museum could further develop and collaborate with other organizations.\n\nNow that she’s been laid off alongside 12 other employees at the museum, she’s trying to keep some semblance of the old routine. The mornings are spent surveying the latest news from other museums about closures and layoffs. She interacts with hundreds of her colleagues online, forming webinars and working groups about how the art industry might resurrect after the shutdown.\n\n“I think of the day in chunks and sign up for opportunities,” she said. “It helps to create some normalcy.” She tries to regiment her days of quarantine with workouts and meals. And she remains steadfastly optimistic.\n\n“Museum managers should see that this is an opportunity to rebuild healthier work structures and attempt to make jobs more supportive,” she explained. “Maybe there will be fewer jobs but better ones. More benefits and fuller employment. The pandemic will change the way we work inside our institutions.”\n\nJoseph Liatela\n\nColumbia University M.F.A. student who relocated to San Francisco\n\nJoseph Liatela could see the writing on the wall. He bought a one-way ticket home to San Francisco, leaving behind his studio at Columbia University in New York, where he is studying for his M.F.A. degree in visual art. He stuffed what he could into a luggage bag: silicones, metals, a sketchbook, molds, small sculptures, and other materials.\n\n“My main concern was to be with my family,” the 28-year-old artist explained. “I decided to leave a couple days before Columbia officially closed.”\n\nBack at his studio, Liatela would often spend all his time in the studio, typically arriving there around 9:30 a.m. He would work through the night, arriving back at his apartment usually around 2:30 in the morning. Now isolating on the West Coast, he has created a makeshift studio in his sister’s garage and used this time as an opportunity to work on less laborious projects like videos and research. Online classes for his semester start soon.\n\n“It’s been difficult getting resituated,” he said. “And part of this process is mourning. We need to mourn that this is not how things should be. People shouldn’t feel so much pressure to make, make, make.”\n\nJessimi Jones\n\nSpringfield Museum of Art executive director based in Bellefontaine, Ohio\n\nWhen Jessimi Jones became executive director of the Springfield Museum of Art in Ohio this past January, she never imagined that her first few months on the job would involve crisis management and a temporary shuttering of her workplace. Like the majority of museums in the United States, hers is a small operation.\n\n“Within the last two weeks, I sat with the board to identify a realistic timeline for the museum,” she explained. “We went line item by line item to see where we will realistically have a shortfall, what expenses we can save, and what the gaps are that we need to fill. Within a few days, our board has given generous donations, but we still have not yet filled all the gaps.”\n\nHer appointment at the museum was supposed to be something of a homecoming after working at the Philbrook Museum in Oklahoma for more than six years. Jones grew up in Bellefontaine, Ohio, about 40 minutes north of Springfield. She now finds herself quarantined at her parents’ house, sharing her childhood bedroom with her husband and daughter. Because the museum doesn’t have full-time security, she finds herself going into the empty museum regularly to check mail and survey the building.\n\nThe Springfield Museum has eight part-time employees; Jones made the difficult decision of laying off three staff members at the front desk who each worked a few hours per week. “It’s been particularly challenging and stressful,” she said. “But I feel positive that we are going to use this time to have things ready for when we reopen our doors and welcome people back in.”\n\nNo, We Are Not All Edward Hopper Paintings Now\n\nContent Courtesy of: artnews.com\n\nWritten by: ALEX GREENBERGER\n\nA museum visitor looking at Edward Hopper’s Morning Sun (1952).\n\nAbout two weeks ago, Edward Hopper’s art started enjoying an expected revival—not in a museum but on Twitter. “We are all edward hopper paintings now,” declared Michael Tisserand, a New Orleans–based writer who, in a viral tweet that has since racked up hundreds of thousands of likes, assembled four images of Hopper works featuring lonesome-looking souls in bare indoor settings.\n\nThe sentiment struck a chord, with the prominent art critic Jonathan Jones even penning a full-length essay on it for the Guardian. So moved was he by the notion of Hopper’s paintings now that Jones wrote, “We choose modern loneliness because we want to be free.”\n\nBut therein lies a difference between Hopper’s forlorn subjects and so many of us right now. They choose to live in modernity and find themselves alienated because of it. We choose to simply try to stay alive in the world today and a pandemic that has so far killed more than 36,000 worldwide is keeping us captive. We are not all Edward Hopper paintings now. If only we were so lucky.\n\nTrue, Hopper’s late-career paintings capture a moodiness and a melancholy that is distinctly of our moment. They often feature affectless individuals looking out windows or staring into the distance, gazing at nothing in particular. They are rendered in drab, un-showy colors, and many art historians have praised them for their atmosphere. (Even if some during the mid-20th century, when Hopper was in his prime, did not: Clement Greenberg, who famously sang the praises of the Abstract Expressionists, once wrote, “Hopper simply happens to be a bad painter.”)\n\nHopper’s subjects in stasis were actually always somewhere in the middle of a slow-motion action. He often said the protagonists of his paintings were caught in moments of “moving on,” though where to is not always (or ever) clear. When he shows a woman in a slip sitting on a bed and vacantly looking out at an urban landscape, as he does in 1952’s Morning Sun (now in the collection of Ohio’s Columbus Museum of Art), it is possible that, after the instance in which Hopper has depicted her, she gets up and goes about her day. Even if her depression lingers, at least she leaves the house—unlike so many of the socially distanced citizens of the world right now.\n\nThough it would be hard to describe Hopper’s paintings as being in any way uplifting, one could say they are faintly optimistic. Even his most desolate imaginings are suffused with soul, and many of his daytime scenes pool with sunlight that pours in from windows. That longstanding interest in illumination stems from his childhood, when Hopper would take pleasure in seeing the sun come into the upper level of his family’s house in Nyack, New York.\n\n“There is a sort of elation about sunlight on the upper part of a house,” the artist once said. In that case, let us all make like Hopper paintings and take pleasure in light—the smallest but also biggest of things—for now.\n\nCurator Hans Ulrich Obrist Proposes Massive Public Art Project in Response to Coronavirus\n\nWritten by: Tessa Solomon\n\nContent Courtesy of: artnews.com\n\nHans-Ulrich Obrist, the artist director of the Serpentine Gallery.\n\nAs many around the world band together to launch coronavirus relief funds, curator Hans Ulrich Obrist has revealed his own idea to help foster art-making in the time of a pandemic: a vast public arts project on the scale of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Great Depression–era work-relief programs. In detailing his plans to the Guardian on Monday, Obrist cited cornerstone of Roosevelt’s New Deal—the Public Works of Art Project and its successor, the Works Progress Administration, which employed more than 8 million Americans and is partly credited with launching the careers of Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko—as one of his key inspirations.\n\n“With the WPA, they went out into the community: artists got salaries and were able to research and create work during the New Deal era,” Obrist, who serves as artistic director of London’s Serpentine Galleries, said, per the Guardian. “It gave many people their first real jobs and commissions.”\n\nFrom 1935 through 1943, artists enlisted by PWAP and WPA produced roughly 15,000 public artworks, including murals, motivational posters, and sculptures for government buildings. Pollock and Rothko, working as muralists, were joined by Abstract Expressionists Willem de Kooning and Lee Krasner, who were then at the start of their careers.\n\n“It’s such a fascinating project when you consider where we find ourselves now, both in terms of supporting the economy and the importance of helping and caring about artists,” Obrist said. “The U.K. government should do something like this.”\n\nAs of March 30, the U.K. has recorded more than 19,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus—including the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson—and 1,228 deaths. Like many others worldwide, the country has shuttered all nonessential businesses, dealing a financial and creative blow to galleries and museums. Last week, the Arts Council England announced plans for a $190 million emergency relief package which will offer about $25.8 million in cash grants for individual artists and freelancers.\n\nObrist added that, when the outbreak was finally under control, arts organizations “need to go into communities with art which don’t usually have access to it. In this time of crisis, it’s important that museums think about how they can go beyond their walls and reach everyone.”\n\nADVERTISING\n\nDigital ad growth will fall to single digits thanks to pandemic: Magna\n\nContent Courtesy of: campaignlive.co.uk\n\nWritten by: Rahul Sachitanand\n\nAnd that’s the good news, according to a Magna Global report, as the crisis hammers spending across all formats.\n\nGlobal digital advertising is likely to slow down to single-digit growth this year, compared to over 20% per year in recent years, according to a new report from Magna, the centralised IPG Mediabrands resource. However, digital media will likely be the least impacted form of media during the crisis, due to the acceleration of digital media usage and ecommerce during the outbreak.\n\nAccording to Magna’s report, among linear ad formats, TV will remain relatively resilient due to pre-existing spending commitments and the fact that its core CPG/FMCG clients will be relatively unscathed by the outbreak and the economic slowdown. While TV viewing is reportedly growing as people isolate at home, a shortage of fresh programming and the cancellation of live sports events may ultimately limit overall growth, Magna says.\n\nRadio ad sales may suffer more, as automotive commuting stops for weeks, and OOH media sales will be severely hurt during the outbreak as train stations and highways remain empty. OOH media may recover faster than other media, however, due to its strong performance and client mix (technology).\n\nEarly data from China, South Korea and Italy suggests significant increases in TV viewing and digital media consumption.\n\nWhen WFH rules and quarantines are established on a national scale, linear TV viewing increases over 10% while the audience for news programs and news channels grows by 30% or more. Digital media consumption, especially social media and digital video, also increases by up to 10%, Magna data shows.\n\nMeanwhile, in terms of demand, the agency says it will update its detailed media owners’ Net Advertising Revenues (NAR) forecasts in early June based on media companies Q1 earning reports to be published in April, and reports from local trade organisations. This will also give Magna a clearer outlook on the pandemic and the economic outlook.\n\nElsewhere, the report report contends that the quarantine and social distancing policies are generating changes in attitudes, social norms (remote work, remote education), consumption (acceleration of e-commerce and online services), and media consumption (surge in TV viewing, OTT usage, and digital media). These shifts are likely to (at least partially) outlast the outbreak.\n\nWith COVID-19 now a global pandemic, many industry sectors may decrease marketing and advertising spending this year as a result of slower sales and profits.\n\nMagna expects the impact on revenues to be severe for the hospitality sector, moderate for retail and automotive, mild for consumer goods and potentially positive for ecommerce and SVOD. Magna has made a four-tiered forecast for adspend. The most severe cutbacks, the agency says, will be sectors such as travel, cinemas and other related leisure services, which will see demand for their offerings crumple to zero or near zero and many businesses go under.\n\nThe second “significant” category, which will see a strong slowdown and a decent recovery, includes retail (mild impact for grocery shops, severe for department stores, positive for ecommerce) and automotive and beauty businesses. Mildly hit businesses include technology, telecoms, pharma, food, drinks and personal care. On the other hand, some categories will see positive growth in ad spending. These include household goods (some toiletries are seeing a temporary surge in sales), home entertainment (SVOD, OTT), e-commerce and delivery services and cloud computing services.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 epidemic seems to be slowing in China, which shows that extreme isolation works and curbs the contagion within four to six weeks. Europe and North America are now facing at least five weeks of quarantines and business closures that will hit the economy, before business gradually comes back to normal.\n\nFor marketers, this means they are looking at a global recession in the first half (negative GDP growth in Q1 and Q2) to be followed by a recovery in the second half. If so, the global economy may stagnate in 2020, instead of growing by 3% as previously expected.\n\nHowever, in terms of consumer sentiment, COVID-19 may have significantly accelerated the decline of several economies. Western Europe, where the economy was already slowing down before the outbreak, especially in Western Europe. China has already experienced negative growth in the first quarter for the first time in 40 years, and full-year growth is now expected to be between 3% and 5%, compared to 7% in recent years, prompting muted forecasts there and worldwide.\n\nPublicis Groupe fly people home to be with families amid COVID-19 chaos\n\nWritten by: Oliver McAteer\n\nContent Courtesy of: campaignlive.co.uk\n\nThe holding company is also accelerating the roll-out of Marcel.\n\nMore and more employees of Publicis Groupe are taking the holding company up on its offer to fly them home to be with their families amid the coronavirus disruption.\n\nCEO Arthur Sadoun said he is pleased to learn staff are taking advantage of the invitation as he addressed everyone on Sunday for the third time since COVID-19 took hold of the economy.\n\nThe leader said that Publicis is accelerating the launch of Marcel so its employees can be better connected.\n\n“We realized that today we not only need to fight the virus, but also the isolation it is causing,” he said. “Staying strong together in this period is going to be vital. Not only for our business, but more importantly for your well-being.\n\n“This is why we have decided to advance the launch of Marcel. We move fast as there is an urgency to keep us all connected. It will now be available for the entire group by the end of April. We will start in the U.S., where Marcel will be available to 30,000 people there. It won’t be perfect — there will be some bugs — and it will keep evolving. But it will unite us, at a time when we need that the most.”\n\nMeanwhile, 3,000 Publicis leaders will come together (virtually) at the end of this week, with a main theme of addressing client relationships.\n\nSadoun explained: “When it comes to our clients it is clear everyday that it has never been more important to be on their side. We need to act differently with them today and tomorrow, and I want to make sure we start immediately.”\n\nHe added: “I want to thank you all for your courage and the incredible engagement you’ve shown at this time.”\n\nLIVING ON THE EDGE: HOW A SMALL AGENCY TURNED INTERNET SCARCITY INTO A CLIENT OPPORTUNITY\n\nContent Courtesy of: adage.com\n\nWritten by: Lori Bower\n\nKansas shop proposed WiFi parking lots to broadband provider\n\nTo overcome slow rural internet at their homes, Lori Bower and Kim Baldwin upload client projects from a public WiFi parking area in Inman, Kansas, while their children do school work. (Hatches temporarily open for viewer pleasure only.)\n\nLiving on the Edge is a weekly series exploring how small agencies have overcome adversity and applied creativity, ingenuity and hard work to solve a business problem. This first installment is about how a Kansas shop helped kids continue learning virtually during the coronavirus outbreak and turned it into a win for a client.\n\nI have a five-person agency called BowerComm in Hutchinson, Kansas (I boomeranged to Chicago agencies and came back 10 years ago to live on the family farm). By Sunday, March 15, we’d decided to work from home due to the coronavirus outbreak, so we started that week with a Skype status meeting. Two of us live on farms—17 miles from the nearest McDonald’s, to give you a sense of “ruralness”—and we realized we were going to run out of hot-spot data in short order. And what we have out here is 10-12 mb/sec, at best.\n\nThis led us to an idea for our client IdeaTek, a local broadband provider whose mission is to bring better access to rural areas. (Unfortunately, they don’t offer service where I live!) During our status call, we could see an emerging need for drive-up WiFi parking lots. People in our situation were going to need access, and the places that usually offer it (libraries, coffee shops) were closing. So, we pitched the idea to them right after we got done with our meeting—and they started talks immediately about how to implement it.\n\nLittle did we know that the next day, Kansas would be the first state to cancel “normal” school for the remainder of the term. School districts—which were mostly all on spring break—started scrambling to take learning online in a place where up to 25 percent of students don’t have home internet access beyond a cellphone.\n\nOur idea, delivered at exactly the right time, meant that IdeaTek was able to host a conference call for the schools and communities they serve on Wednesday. By Wednesday afternoon (March 18) they had a beta parking lot site. And by Sunday they had nine free public WiFi parking lots in five communities. The tally stands at 22 locations as of March 27.\n\nWe helped IdeaTek get the word out with a press release, social media and landing page over that first weekend, freeing them to handle the flood of inquiries from schools, businesses and residential customers concerned about having access.\n\nTwo days ago, I maxed out my Verizon jet pack 15 GB allotment, meaning it was throttled to 600 kb/s (impossible to send anything at all). Today, I maxed out my parents’ jet pack. Fortunately, no one is at our office, so it appears I will be working from there alone until my data plan resets … assuming my babysitter doesn’t fall victim to COVID-19 quarantine. Clearly Disney+ is out of the picture for entertainment at home.\n\nDo you have a story to tell about how your small shop overcame adversity and came out stronger?

Amazon said last week it plans to hire 100,000 people and give U.S. workers a temporary $2-an-hour raise in an effort to meet the crushing demand. However, Amazon is under fire for not doing enough to protect its workers, some of whom have tested positive for the coronavirus. The company said it has stepped up cleaning in its warehouses and is giving guidelines to workers about maintaining safe distances.\n\nDeclines in the ride-hailing business are sharp. Recent estimates put a drop in fare prices at as much as 11 percent and demand at about 20 percent. Uber, the largest ride-hailing operator, can partly offset the shortfall with its restaurant delivery business, which is seeing an uptick. Lyft doesn’t deliver food.\n\nIn the email to drivers reviewed by Bloomberg News, Lyft suggested that in addition to seeking immediate work with Amazon, drivers could sign up to help deliver groceries, COVID-19 tests and other medical supplies as part of future partnership programs. Lyft said more than 100,000 drivers had already signed up.\n\nLyft urged drivers to follow federal health guidelines and suggested installing a plastic barrier in their vehicles, along with a link to buy such a kit on Amazon.\n\nA Lyft spokeswoman declined to specify the terms of its arrangement with Amazon.\n\nOPINION: COVID-19 WILL CHANGE CONSUMERISM FOREVER\n\nBrands that fail to serve the greater good could lose customer loyalty\n\nWritten by: Lyndsey Fox.\n\nContent Courtesy of: adage.com\n\nThere’s no question that COVID-19 will transform the world; we might never return to life as it was. For the first time in my memory, we’re not in a situation where change is coming—it’s here. And consumer brands might face the whiplash of this shift more quickly than any other group.\n\nAs far back as I can remember during my time in advertising, we told clients that the world is changing and that they need to change with it—or be left behind. That they will see new competitors from tertiary categories, new technologies, new mediums—all leading to new consumer needs not as clear as in the past. We have continually pushed to find elasticity in offerings, to be as relevant as possible and to seek out new markets and optimize the existing. It has always been our job to be not just partners in communication, but to be strategic partners in optimization of consumption at all levels.\n\nBut no marketer could ever have imagined how expedited and acute these changes would become through the pervasiveness of COVID-19. And while we’re rightly busy grappling with the virus’ impact on our healthcare system and its devastating economic implications, given what I do for a living I have to ask myself: How will this change our overarching idea of consumerism?\n\nCulturally we find ourselves at a crossroads. Where we once were consumers, we are now connectors and protectors—trying to determine how to sustain our livelihoods. We are worried about and in constant communication with our loved ones who are sequestered by themselves; we fear for their health and for their emotional well-being. We are evangelists of the simplest of practices—staying at home and washing our hands—behaviors that seem so commonplace until they are mandated.\n\nIt’s even stranger to consider what’s happening on our social media platforms. Instagram until two weeks ago was a black hole of consumerism, a place where you could never have enough to keep up with the Joneses—not enough things, not enough meals out and certainly never enough followers. Today, in this “shelter in place” world, we find ourselves in a position where—if we’re very lucky—we have what we need and that’s enough. If we’re fortunate, we’re able to finally experiment with making sourdough loaves to feed our families or have a guitar to strum while they sing along. At least, that’s what my Instagram feed tells me.\n\nWhile the division of wealth and privilege is still quite clear as I scroll, the dichotomy of subject matter and purpose of platform is not lost on me. Instagram and other social media channels innately romanticize all. But when you dig into the purpose of the activities we’re capturing while we’re stuck at home during this crisis, they’re about the protection of our communities, the sustainability of our families’ abilities to support ourselves and ultimately the greater good. We’re planting victory gardens; we’re sewing masks for our healthcare workers on the front lines; and we’re leaving a few eggs on our neighbors’ doorstep when they run out. As the popular meme making the rounds declares: This is wartime and the enemy is the virus. We will overcome it, but the trauma will remain.\n\nWe are facing an uphill battle on the trauma inflicted upon us all: lives lost, devastation of healthcare systems all across the world, coping as best they can with what they have. The overnight loss of income and ability to support your family. The enormous sense of loss at not being able to hug a loved one. Trauma like this pervades our subconscious for generations.\n\nThis is why I believe that March 2020 marks the end of consumerism as we’ve come to know it. We won’t forget the new practices that helped us through the crisis. “E pluribus unum” (Out of many, one) may be our country’s motto, but if these last few weeks have taught us anything it’s that it just takes one to protect the many. Today we become aware through the pervasive spread of this virus just how strong our individual actions can be. That staying home is an effort in saving lives. Once we emerge from this, think about transferring that notion to buying power. Imagine the power of individual action, and the strength it gives every single dollar spent.\n\nWhat does this mean for brands? It means that they just got a new competitor from a tertiary category: community. How brands choose to use that information is up to them, but my recommendation is that they embrace and react to what consumers will be asking themselves: Why am I spending this dollar? Who am I spending it with? And, what greater good will it serve? It is my belief that only then will any loyalty be gained in this new dawn of consumerism.\n\nTech\n\nHow Covid-19 will impact IT and tech spending for 2020 and beyond\n\nWritten by: Louis Columbus\n\nContent Courtesy of: cloudcomputing-news.net\n\nCategories\n\nCollaboration, Research, Software, Storage, Trends\n\nThe human tragedy the COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted on the world is incalculable and continues to grow. Every human life is priceless and deserves the care needed to sustain it. COVID-19 is also impacting entire industries, causing them to randomly move in unpredictable ways, directly impacting IT and tech spending.\n\nCOVID-19’s impact on industries\n\nComputer Economics in collaboration with their parent company Avasant published their Coronavirus Impact Index by Industry that looks at how COVID-19 is affecting 11 major industry sectors in four dimensions: personnel, operations, supply chain, and revenue. Please see the Coronavirus Impact Index by Industry by Tom Dunlap, Dave Wagner, and Frank Scavo of Computer Economics for additional information and analysis. The resulting index is an overall rating of the impact of the pandemic on each industry and is shown below:\n\nComputer Economics and Avasant predict major disruption to High Tech & Telecommunications based on the industry’s heavy reliance on Chinese supply chains, which were severely impacted by COVID-19.\n\nBased on conversations with U.S.-based high tech manufacturers, I’ve learned that a few are struggling to make deliveries to leading department stores and discount chains due to parts shortages and allocations from their Chinese suppliers. North American electronics suppliers aren’t an option due to their prices being higher than their Chinese competitors. Leading department stores and discount chains openly encourage high tech device manufacturers to compete with each other on supplier availability and delivery date performance.\n\nIn contrast to the parts shortage and unpredictability of supply chains dragging down the industry, software is a growth catalyst. The study notes that Zoom, Slack, GoToMyPC, Zoho Remotely, Microsoft Office365, Atlassian, and others are already seeing increased demand as companies increase their remote-working capabilities.\n\nCOVID-19’s impact on IT spending\n\nFurther supporting the Coronavirus Impact Index by Industry analysis, Andrew Bartels, VP & Principal Analyst at Forrester, published his latest forecast of tech growth today in the post, The Odds of a Tech Market Decline In 2020 Have Just Gone Up To 50%.\n\nMr. Bartels is referencing the market forecasts shown in the following forecast published last month, New Forrester Forecast Shows That Global Tech Market Growth Will Slip To 3% In 2020 And 2021 and shown below:\n\nKey insights from Forrester’s latest IT spending forecast and predictions are shown below:\n\nForrester is revising its tech forecast downward, predicting the US and global tech market growth slowing to around 2% in 2020. Bartels mentions that this assumes the US and other major economies have declined in the first half of 2020 but manage to recover in the second half\n\nIf a full-fledged recession hits, there is a 50% probability that US and global tech markets will decline by 2% or more in 2020\n\nIn either a second-half 2020 recovery or recession, Forrester predicts computer and communications equipment spending will be weakest, with potential declines of 5% to 10%\n\nTech consulting and systems integration services spending will be flat in a temporary slowdown and could be down by up to 5% if firms cut back on new tech projects\n\nSoftware spending growth will slow to the 2% to 4% range in the best case and will post no growth in the worst case of a recession\n\nThe only positive signs from the latest Forrester IT spending forecast is the continued growth in demand for cloud infrastructure services and potential increases in spending on specialised software.\n\nForrester also predicts communications equipment, and telecom services for remote work and education as organisations encourage workers to work from home and schools move to online courses\n\nConclusion\n\nEvery industry is economically hurting already from the COVID-19 pandemic. Now is the time for enterprise software providers to go the extra mile for their customers across all industries and help them recover and grow again. Strengthening customers in their time of need by freely providing remote collaboration tools, secure endpoint solutions, cloud-based storage, and CRM systems is an investment in the community that every software company needs to make it through this pandemic too.\n\nCULTURE\n\nWritten by: Ruben Natal-San Miguel\n\nContent Courtesy of: artnews.com\n\nPhotographer Ruben Natal-San Miguel Is Capturing a New, Silent New York\n\nThe day photographer Ruben Natal-San Miguel’s exhibition “Women R Beautiful” was set to open at New York’s Postmasters Gallery, the city went dark amid growing concerns over the rapid spread of the new coronavirus (Covid-19). Business deemed nonessential, including bars, salons, art institutions, were among those put on lockdown, which is still ongoing. New York is currently the epicenter of the nation’s coronavirus outbreak; as of March 26, New York State has reported 37,258 confirmed cases and 385 deaths from Covid-19.\n\nLike those left in the city, Natal-San Miguel takes precautions every time he steps outside: gloves, mask, camera. From his home in Harlem, he ventures by foot, often in the sparse bicycle lane. Over the past few days, he’s taken walks from the Bronx to Broadway and beyond, in what has become a virtual ghost town, shooting images along the way as part of a new series. In one image, taken from the sidewalk, his camera peers into Central Park, which is disturbingly crowded on a recent sunny Saturday.\n\n“I get nervous when I do this, but I do it,” Natal-San Miguel told ARTnews by phone. “It is my responsibility as a documentary photographer to convey what is happening. And with my show at Postmasters closed, this is a way for me to give myself a sense of hope, and therapy, if you want to call it that.”\n\nNatal-San Miguel, who was born in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, is a self-described “people person,” known for his vibrant participatory portraits. For his Postmasters show, he was to debut a new series that was a contemporary take—and personal revision—of some of mid-20th-century photographer Gary Winogrand’s most iconic images. (The show is accessible in a virtual version while the gallery remains temporarily closed.)\n\nNatal-San Miguel usually keeps in touch with his subjects, trading numbers and sending prints. But for this new, somewhat unexpected project, the subjects are barren blocks and masked New Yorkers scurrying between the bodega and their front door. His long-range camera lens provides a certain amount of intimacy that increasingly feels impossible these days; Natal-San Miguel keeps a distance of between 10 or 15 feet between himself and the passersby his camera captures.\n\n“It’s challenging for us all—for me, the subject,” Natal-San Miguel said. “That personal space and human connection is gone. But still, I try to keep the personality and the dignity.”\n\nContent Courtesy of: adage.com\n\nWritten by: Paras Griffin\n\nDESIGNER FACE MASKS ARE GOING FOR $200 A POP ON EBAY\n\nThe high-end masks exist in something of a price-gouging gray area because they’re luxury products by design\n\nGwyneth Paltrow posted an Instagram photo Monday on her way back from her local farmer’s market. In it, she’s wearing a black dress and a matching black face mask. Her label of choice for the latter is a Swedish company called Airinum AB.\n\nDesigner face masks have been around for at least a decade, a niche market catering to the chronically sick along with frequenters of Burning Man and fashionistas in Beijing. Now, amid the coronavirus pandemic, they are a coveted accessory for wealthy people around the globe. And for others, they’re a new symbol of inequality at a time when protective equipment for medical workers is in woefully short supply.\n\nAirinum and other popular makers of trendy masks, including Cambridge Mask Co. and Vogmask, typically sell products in an assortment of colors and sizes and tout advanced air filtration and memory foam fitting for the wearer’s nose. Unlike paper masks often used by health care professionals, these can be washed and reused.\n\nThe products are normally priced at $12 for a basic black Cambridge mask or as much as $69 for a pearl pink Airinum. But those two companies are out of stock until at least next month. Airinums have sold for more than $200 apiece on eBay in the last week and Vogmasks for about $150 on average.\n\nEBay, Amazon and other online retailers have come under pressure for enabling sellers to price gouge on essentials like masks and hand sanitizers. In response, the companies said they would ban such listings. The high-end masks exist in something of a gray area because they’re luxury products by design.\n\nIn the eyes of government officials, though, they’re still masks. San Francisco-based Vogmask manufactures all of its products in South Korea, which enacted an export ban this month on medical masks. Wendover Brown, the company’s co-founder, said 80,000 finished and packaged products are waiting in a warehouse near Incheon, unable to pass through customs. “The product is just sitting there, not helping anyone,” Brown said. Vogmask is now exploring options to manufacture in the U.S.\n\nThe global mask shortage is a severe problem for medical staff. Apple and Facebook are among companies helping source and donate masks to hospitals, and officials have urged people not to hoard them. Christian Siriano, a prominent fashion designer, and the French workshops of Balenciaga started producing masks to shore up supplies for health care workers.\n\nIt’s in this light that Paltrow’s pandemic glamor shot attracted some outrage. In comments on the post, several people chastised the actress for being tone-deaf and urged her to donate the mask to a health care worker and advocate for others to do so. “Medical staff have been begging people to contribute these,” one person wrote. “These should only be available to those on the front lines.”\n\nA spokeswoman for Paltrow declined to comment. On Wednesday, Paltrow posted on Instagram saying she and her husband had donated to the Frontline Responders Fund, which is raising $10 million to get critical supplies to workers combating the virus.\n\nFood\n\nCoronavirus effects will ripple widely through food sector\n\nWritten by: Keith Nunes\n\nContent Courtesy of: foodbusinessnews.net\n\nKANSAS CITY — The unfolding impact of the novel coronavirus on public health and the global economy has been dramatic. Reaction to the virus by public and private entities will have a significant short-term impact on some sectors of the food and beverage industry as it spreads in the United States and to the rest of the world.\n\nFoodservice will be hardest hit as more consumers work from home or practice social distancing to slow the spread of the virus. Many restaurants are expected to lose breakfast, lunch and dinner traffic, and the fall in demand will ripple through to the distributors and manufacturers who serve those businesses.\n\nA recent survey by the market research company Technomic, Inc. found more than 3 in 10 consumers say they plan to leave the house less often and to go to restaurants less often or order food or beverages at away-from-home venues less frequently. And among those who say they will not go to a restaurant as often, 31 percent say decreased frequency will last between one and three months.\n\nIn China, Starbucks Corp. closed half of its stores in response to the virus. Most of the stores have reopened, but same-store sales were down 78 percent in February when compared to the same period of the prior year. While a single data point, Starbucks’ experience indicates foodservice recovery may be slow.\n\nSimilar supply chain ripple effects will occur as more schools and universities close for undetermined periods of time. Suppliers to the institutional market will see demand fall as schools shift to online learning programs.\n\nProducers and food manufacturers also may be impacted by China’s inability to fully honor its commodity purchasing obligations under the phase one agreement signed Jan. 15. China agreed to purchase at least $36.5 billion in US food, agricultural and seafood products in calendar year 2020, but those purchases may be delayed as the Chinese economy and the global supply chain recover from the effects of the virus.\n\nTechnomic sees the coronavirus as a “boon” for the grocery business, as almost half of the consumers surveyed said they will stockpile grocery foods and beverages as a substitute for away-from-home meals. The scenario is playing out in a variety of ways. On March 4, the Campbell Soup Co. said it is increasing production and distribution of soups in regions of the United States where it is seeing a spike in sales thought to be related to consumers stocking up on shelf-stable goods. Costco Wholesale Corp. said its February sales benefited from an uptick in consumer demand in the fourth week of the month. The retailer attributed the rise to consumer concerns about the coronavirus and estimated the impact to be 3 percent over the comparable period a year earlier.\n\nOf additional concern to marketers and manufacturers is how the impact of the outbreak may affect long-term consumer behaviors. The longer the outbreak persists, the more likely it is people will try new products or services, whether in-store prepared foods, click-and-collect, delivery, etc. While the immediate effects of the coronavirus are dramatic, residual changes continuing after the pandemic passes could prove transformational for some sectors of the industry.\n\nFree toilet paper among ways restaurants respond to COVID-19\n\nContent Courtesy of: foodbusinessnews.net\n\nWritten by: Jeff Gelski\n\nGuerrilla Tacos in Los Angeles is offering"
