        "text": "Eleonora Jedlińska, The Shapes of Memory. Selected Aspects of Contemporary Art, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego 2019. The Shapes of Memory. Selected Aspects of Contemporary Art consists of fourteen essays devoted to questions addressed in the art of selected artists hailing from Poland and other countries. The works discussed in the book, which have been chosen from the extensive oeuvres of the artists it presents, relate to the question of preserving, in memory, events of fundamental significance to anyone endeavouring to face up to the history of the Second World War and the Holocaust. The artistic attitudes and works of art considered here are an expression of a desire to understand and, perhaps, a warning to future generations in order to avoid a repetition of a tragedy which has forever cast a shadow over the present and the future. The accomplishments of the group of artists discussed in the book are linked by a common motif; they point to the significance of the role played by memory in the process of commemorating and adopting a stance toward that most tragic experience of modern history which was the horror of the extermination of the Jews of Europe during the Second World War. The fourteen essays were written over the course of recent years and published in dispersed and various ways, appearing in scholarly journals and post-conference publications and given as papers at Polish and international congresses. Together, they form a cohesive and coherent narrative and they constitute a consistent endeavour to encapsulate and analyse the artists' individual, in a sense 'reclusive', facing up to the extreme experience of the Holocaust and the memory bound up with it. One aspect of their work is presented here, namely, the question of remembrance and commemoration, the feeling of sorrow and pain and the sense of the constant instability, the ambiguity of the world's understanding in respect of a problem crucial to contemporary art; an ethical attitude toward the Holocaust; a problem in which every artist seeking allusions to the human condition in today's reality is entangled. Jacques le Goff wrote: The Greeks of the archaic age made Memory a goddess-Mnemosyne. She is the mother of the nine muses, whom she has [sic] conceived in the course of nine nights spent with Zeus.
