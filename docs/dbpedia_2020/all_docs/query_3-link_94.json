        "text": "A three-year starter at midfield for Tiger Lacrosse, Lindsay Dixon '92 was inducted into the Towson Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nDixon led Towson to the NCAA Tournament as a junior and a senior. As a junior, he scored one of the biggest goals in the history of Towson lacrosse. In the 1991 NCAA quarterfinals at Princeton, he scored the game-winner in the third overtime to lift the Tigers to a 14-13 win over the Princeton Tigers and to a berth in the Final Four.\n\nTowson finished the 1991 season as the NCAA runner-up with a 12-4 record. Dixon was the Tigers’ fifth-leading scorer with 11 goals and 12 assists.\n\nAs a senior he was one of the Tigers’ team captains and led the Tigers to a 9-3 record and a second straight berth in the NCAA Tournament. The Tigers’ second-leading scorer with 24 goals and 12 assists, the Annapolis, Md., native helped Towson finish the regular season as the fourth-ranked team in the nation.\n\nHe was a third team All-American and also earned All-East Coast Conference honors for the second time. Dixon finished his career with 65 goals and 49 assists and is one of the highest-scoring middies ever to play for the Tigers.\n\nAfter graduating with a degree in psychology, he went on to enjoy a five-year career playing professional lacrosse. He was named All-Pro in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League while playing for the Baltimore Thunder and the Pittsburgh Bulls. He was also named to the Thunder’s All-Time team.\n\nHis lacrosse career also included a spot on the 1994 U.S. World Lacrosse team."
