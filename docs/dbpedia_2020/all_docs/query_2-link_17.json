Spine rolled at the crown, expected browning. Stated First Edition. Dust jacket, with a closed tear, protected in a mylar cover. \"In 1926, Edith Gregor Halpert, just twenty-six years old, opened one of the first art galleries in Greenwich Village and set about turning the art world upside down. Her Downtown Gallery, which she ran for forty-four years, laid the groundwork for the art market's modern era, and its aggressive promotion and sales tactics. Halpert cultivated the most illustrious art collectors of the day, from Abby Aldrich Rockefeller to Stanley Marcus. She invented the market for folk art. And she pushed the first group of American artists working in a modern vernacular into the history books, including Stuart Davis, Jacob Lawrence, Georgia O'Keeffe, Ben Shahn, and Arthur Dove. Despite all this, Edith Halpert herself has been lost to history. Until now.\" \"In The Girl with the Gallery, journalist Lindsay Pollock brings Halpert and her era back to life, revealing how a penniless Russian Jewish immigrant - armed with only a Harlem public-school education, a few years in the working world, and an abundance of determination and charisma - made it her mission to fight for American art and artists. This is biography is an unforgettable story of class, money, vanity, jealousy, and tragic loss. / Lindsay Pollock is a journalist specializing in the art market. She currently works for Bloomberg News, where she writes a weekly column and reports frequently for TV and radio. A former columnist for the New York Sun, she also writes regularly for Art & Auction, Art News, Art Review, and The Art Newspaper. This is her first book. Lindsay lives in New York City.\" - Publisher. Size: 8vo. SIGNED.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Fine. First Edition. Fine, fresh and crisp first printing appears to have never been read, bound in sharp gray boards, the black spine stamped in silver titles, the fine pictorial dust jacket with just a few small superficial indentations to back panel, else fine. Lindsay Pollock has crafted a wonderful portrait of the indomitable Edith Gregor Halpert, her founding of the Downtown Gallery in Greenwich Village and her major work and influence establishing a voice for the American Art Movement. Numerous black and white photographs expand on historical detail. Comprehensive Notes, Bibliography and Index. Center glossy pages of full color plates show some of the now famous artists and others some of their most striking works."
