SmithCategoriesVisual artFrequencyMonthlyCirculation25,599 (2018)Founded1913 ( )CountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishWebsiteartinamericamagazine .comISSN0004-3214\n\nArt in America is an illustrated quarterly, international magazine concentrating on the contemporary art world in the United States, including profiles of artists and genres, updates about art movements, show reviews and event schedules. It is designed for collectors, artists, art dealers, art professionals and other readers interested in the art world. It has an active website, ArtinAmericaMagazine.com.\n\nArt in America is influential in the way it promotes exploration of important art movements. Over the years it has continued to reach a broad audience of individuals with interest pertaining to these cultural trends and movements.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFounded in 1913,[1] Art in America covers the visual art world, both in the United States and abroad, with a concentration on New York City and contemporary art fairs. Between 1921 and 1939 the magazine was published under the title Art in America and Elsewhere.\n\nA number of well-known artists have been commissioned to design special covers for the magazine. Edward Steichen did one for its 50th birthday; Alexander Calder, Robert Rauschenberg, Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Indiana also created covers. For its 100th birthday the magazine planned special covers by Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, and Urs Fischer.[2]\n\nLong-time editor Elizabeth C. Baker, who led the magazine for 34 years, resigned in June 2008 and was replaced by staff senior editor Marcia E. Vetrocq. She served as editor until January 2011. During her tenure, the magazine was re-designed, its international coverage expanded, and a website launched. Art market blogger and Bloomberg reporter Lindsay Pollock was named editor-in-chief in January 2011. Pollock announced that she was leaving in April 2017.[3] Cynthia Zabel joined Art in America in 2005 as advertising director, and in 2008 was named publisher.\n\nArt in America was sold to ARTnews SA, parent of ARTnews in 2015.[4] In 2016, Brant Publications acquired both Art in America and ARTnews from ARTnews SA.[5] In 2018, Penske Media Corporation, the parent company of Variety magazine, acquired ARTnews and Art in America from Brant.[6]\n\nThe print magazine used to be published 11 times a year, but as of 2021 it is published bi-monthly 6 times a year.[7] The publication schedule was changed in 2020: Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May issues followed the old publication schedule, mid-year double-issues were adopted and 3 more 2020 issues were produced Sep/Oct, Nov/Dec and a double length Gallery Guide. Select reviews and features are uploaded to the website.\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nTimeline: 100 Years of Art in America[8]\n\nEditors-in-chief\n\n[edit]\n\nWilhelm Valentiner (1913–1917)\n\nFrederic Fairchild Sherman (1917–1940; founder)\n\nJean Lipman (first joined in 1934, editor-in-chief 1941–1970)\n\nBrian O'Doherty (1971–1974)\n\nElizabeth C.
