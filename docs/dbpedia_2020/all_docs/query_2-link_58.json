        "text": "With the primary election looming, Iâd like to take a moment to highlight one of the more interesting and, arguably, contentious local races for elected office this year â the race for Lewis County Commissioner, District #2. Also known as incumbent Commissioner Dr. Lindsey Pollock versus challenger Christina Riley.\n\nÂ\n\nIn recent weeks, both candidates have had an opportunity to speak to the Conservative Coalition of Lewis County and their respective members. And Iâd like to give you my own contrast and comparison of the two candidates.\n\nÂ\n\nChristina Riley spoke to the Conservative Coalition of Lewis County first, back in late June. Riley, largely politically unknown, spoke to the group and detailed her experience and qualifications. Riley explained that she started her career in construction and pointed to her career experience in problem-solving and the ability to âthink quickly on the jobâ and âresolve issues as you go.â\n\nÂ\n\nRiley informed the group that sheâs been in professional leadership for over a decade and, as a tribal member herself, has strong working relationships with tribes around our area. When asked âwhyâ she was running by a member of the group, Riley pointed to her role as a parent of two children and seeking to improve opportunities in Lewis County for the next generation.\n\nÂ\n\nAs the challenger for the District #2 position, Riley was asked about what sheâd like to see different or improved in Lewis County. Riley pointed to the need for good jobs and affordable housing as her two primary issues. She referenced the unemployment rate in Lewis County and her belief that poverty rates have stayed the same. Riley also highlighted a desire for the recruitment of family-wage jobs and pointed to a need for additional workforce development.\n\nÂ\n\nâI want to see Lewis County residents go to work,â she said. âI want them to (be able to) afford buying groceries, and grow really happy families in Lewis County.â\n\nÂ\n\nThere was some criticism from members present about whether or not creating jobs was really the role of a county commissioner.\n\nÂ\n\nCommissioner Dr. Lindsey Pollock addressed the Conservative Coalition of Lewis County this past week and was given the same space to speak and answer questions. Rather than take the majority of her time to explain her credentials, she pointed members to her Voterâs Pamphlet information and instead decided to allow the group members to ask more questions of her directly.\n\nÂ\n\nRegarding the dynamic between herself and her other two fellow commissioners, Dr. Pollock said that she has âspiritedâ meetings with fellow commissioners and points to more commonality of shared conservative values over actual differences. She gave the example of a recent RV ordinance that was passed where she was largely in favor of the ordinance, but disagreed about some of the nuances of the proposed measure, namely due to the 30â boundary in which law enforcement could legally enforce the ordinance. Pollock was concerned that it clashed with some level of personal property rights. Ultimately, she voted in favor of the ordinance, but highlighted her contributions towards the discussion with fellow commissioners.\n\nÂ\n\nWhen asked about her biggest priority as a commissioner over the next four years, Dr. Pollock stated that her biggest priority is getting the budget under control. To do that, Dr. Pollock pointed to her experience as a small business owner and higher-level education that enables her to dig deep into budgets and nuanced subject matter. Dr. Pollock told the group that you need experience to wrangle in the budget countywide.\n\nÂ\n\nI personally asked Dr. Pollock about the issue of âcreating jobsâ as a county commissioner. Dr. Pollock stated that creating the right conditions to attract jobs to Lewis County is one thing and different from âcreatingâ jobs. And, that creating jobs at the county level as a commissioner could possibly be seen as an expansion of government, which Dr. Pollock is not in favor of.\n\nÂ\n\nInterestingly in this race between two women candidates, the challenger, Christina Riley, earned the endorsement of the Lewis County Republican Party (LCRP) last year. However, itâs unclear how well Riley was vetted by this group as a candidate. This skepticism is due to the controversial endorsement of gubernatorial candidate Semi Bird, who was later revealed to have numerous issues as a candidate since his endorsement by the LCRP last year. And, not only does Riley have contributions from a union group on the east coast, but also social media screenshots have come to light showing Riley appearing to react in the positive/affirmative to content supporting former presidential candidate Joe Biden, a Democrat. Voters will certainly want to do their own research on these two candidates before casting their votes this August.\n\n---\n\nBrittany Voie is a married mom of two boys (with a third boy due mid-August) residing south of Chehalis. She is also the secretary of the Conservative Coalition of Lewis County."
