Russell Cross has more than 35 years of scientific and management experience, one of the few people anywhere in the industry to hold positions of significance – and accomplishment – in government, academia and the private sector.

Bush and Bill Clinton and later working as a food-safety educator and innovator.\n\nD\n\nJimmy Dean was one of the consummate American entertainers of the 1950’s and 1960’s: He was one of the very few celebrities who successfully launched a food company that not only traded on his fame but actually became a category leader in its own right. By 1972, Jimmy Dean Sausage had opened a new plant in Osceola, Iowa, and Dean took a more active role in marketing and operations. By 1984, when he sold his company to Sara Lee, the Jimmy Dean brand was the No. 1-selling breakfast sausage.\n\nE\n\nPaul Engler was instrumental in shaping the modern cattle feeding industry.

He served as President and CEO of the company until 1974, when he became Chairman of the Board.

It gave him the opportunity to do something never been before done: put his name on what had been formerly a commodity product. Perdue Farms became the nation’s No. 3 poultry company, with more than 20,000 associates, operations in 15 states and production of more than 50 million pounds of poultry a week.\n\nBob Peterson was named IBP’s Chief Executive in 1980 and Chairman in 1981.

Over the next three decades, Townsend’s inventions were legendary, including the Frank-A-Matic and the Automatic Sausage Linker, which revolutionized the production of skinless frankfurters and became an industry standard. Townsend’s company became the largest designer and manufacturer of skinning, stuffing and injection machinery for meat, poultry and seafood processors worldwide.\n\nDon Tyson was named president of Tyson’s Foods, Inc. in 1966, and president and CEO in 1967. He led the company through a period of major expansion, largely via acquisition.
