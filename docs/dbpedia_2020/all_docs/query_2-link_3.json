Bloomberg News Agency, New York, NY, art market writer. Formerly a columnist for the New York Sun.\n\nWRITINGS:\n\nThe Girl with the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert and the Making of the Modern Art Market, Public Affairs (New York, NY), 2006.\n\nContributor to periodicals, including Art & Auction, ARTnews, Art Review, and the Art Newspaper.\n\nSIDELIGHTS:\n\nLindsay Pollock is a journalist with the Bloomberg News Agency and writes about the art market and auctions. She is a graduate of Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism and Barnard College. Aside from her work with Bloomberg, Pollock is also a freelance writer, contributing to various journals and periodicals on art, including Art & Auction, ARTnews, Art Review, and the Art Newspaper. She published her first book, The Girl with the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert and the Making of the Modern Art Market, in 2006. Chronicling the life of Edith Halpert, Pollock tells how the Odessa-born immigrant moved to New York City as a poverty-stricken child and made her mark in New York's art scene selling artwork from a wide variety of artists and becoming one of the most successful art dealers of the twentieth century.\n\nBooklist contributor Donna Seaman called the book a \"riveting portrait\" of Halpert's life. Richard B. Woodward, writing in the New York Times, noted that \"historians of the American folk art market, created in part by [Halpert's] salesmanship, will find plenty of details to chew on\" in Pollock's book. A reviewer in Publishers Weekly commented that the book is \"long overdue,\" while a Kirkus Reviews contributor called the \"polished work … a significant contribution to American beaux arts.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, November 1, 2006, Donna Seaman, review of The Girl with the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert and the Making of the Modern Art Market, p. 27.\n\nKirkus Reviews, September 1, 2006, review of The Girl with the Gallery, p. 890.\n\nMagazine Antiques, November, 2006, review of The Girl with the Gallery, p. 70.\n\nNew York Times, January 14, 2007, Richard B.
