Early in her writing career she decided she wanted her fiction to have a political bent, and to give voice to strong female characters. Since then she's published 17 novels and 17 volumes of poetry and has been hailed as a contemporary feminist icon. Her most recent collection, The Hunger Moon: New and Selected Poems, 1980-2010, came out last year.\n\nOn writing poetry, Piercy said, \"It is a matter of paying attention in the moment so that you truly experience what moves you in the thing. It may come from your life or somebody else's or the newspaper or something fleetingly observed or overheard, but it has something in it that wants to be intensely examined, experienced, made into an artifact.\"\n\nRecent works:\n\nWhere Dreams Come From\n\nApr. 18, 2011\n\nEnd of Days\n\nApr. 20, 2011\n\nThe tao of touch\n\nMay. 5, 2011\n\nFirst sown\n\nMay. 14, 2011\n\nWhat she craved\n\nOct. 22, 2011\n\nFebruary ground\n\nFeb. 9, 2012\n\nThe good, the bad and the inconvenient\n\nMar. 31, 2012"
