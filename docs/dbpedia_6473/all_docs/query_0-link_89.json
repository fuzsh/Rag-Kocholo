        "text": "Last week my students and I unpacked Marge Piercy’s The Late Year. Once we have taken apart and discussed a poem, we write. Sometimes I get a poem out of it. Marge Piercy’s poem begins with “I like Rosh Hashanah late.” I began writing with “I like the New Year,” but quickly realized this is not true for me. I’ve never liked it. I struggle with the idea of forced celebration, especially one that occurs at midnight with lots of violent sound. So I revised. After seeing multiple photos from all around our country of red sunsets, I had to put that into my poem. I am currently raising about 8 monarch caterpillars. This is an uncommon January activity, for sure. It makes my poet-self happy that Marge Piercy’s poem led me to pack all of this into a poem.\n\nThe New Year\n\nI’ve never liked the new year\n\nwhen celebration is forced-fun,\n\nsparklers burn out and become litter.\n\nHow browning leaves fall\n\nand frown like an old Muppet-man.\n\nYet the cardinal still comes to the feeder–\n\na red flash\n\non the morning.\n\nI’ve never liked the new year\n\nwith sing-song rhyme, resolutions\n\npoint to some sustained semblance\n\nof sanity. Rain comes again\n\nflooding roads with impassable potholes,\n\ntires always need adjusting.\n\nYet clouds fire up a sunset\n\na red reminder to look up\n\nat the end of the day.\n\nI reluctantly repent in the cold season,\n\nrescue tropical plants and monarch caterpillars.\n\nI flip through soft notebook pages\n\nof felt-tip words and find\n\na carousel spinning round again.\n\nA red horse I can choose to ride\n\nor not.\n\nMargaret Simon, draft"
