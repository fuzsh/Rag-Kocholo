        "text": "Feminist, socialist, working class Jewish writer and activist Marge Piercy is known for (among many other things) her powerful poetry fusing the personal and political, and social with environmental justice. The poem featured here, “To be of use,” metaphorically compares the people she loves to animals who work hard and persevere, such as the red, green and brown oxen which frame the words of the poem in the poster.\n\nThe first two of four stanzas read:\n\nThe people I love the best\n\njump into work head first\n\nwithout dallying in the shallows\n\nand swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.\n\nThey seem to become natives of that element,\n\nthe black sleek heads of seals\n\nbouncing like half-submerged balls.\n\n/\n\nI love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,\n\nwho pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,\n\nwho strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,\n\nwho do what has to be done, again and again.\n\nThe poem is from CIRCLES ON THE WATER, Alfred A. Knopf, 1973, used with permission.\n\nPurchase Fine Art Prints\n\nTo buy this print or many others on canvas, metal, acrylic, or as a tapestry in your choice of sizes, visit our page on Fine Art America. (Fine art prints are purchased from and shipped by Fine Art America rather than RLM Art Studio.)\n\nPlease be aware that orders containing mounted or framed posters may take an additional 7-10 days to ship.
