        "text": "Marge Piercy\n\nEND OF DAYS\n\nAlmost always with cats, the end\n\ncomes creeping over the two of you—\n\nshe stops eating, his back legs\n\nno longer support him, she leans\n\nto your hand and purrs but cannot\n\nrise—sometimes a whimper of pain\n\nalthough they are stoic. They see\n\ndeath clearly through hooded eyes.\n\nThen there is the long weepy\n\ntrip to the vets, the carrier no\n\nlonger necessary, the last time\n\nin your lap. The injection is quick.\n\nSimply they stop breathing\n\nin your arms. You bring them\n\nhome to bury in the flower garden,\n\nplanting a bush over a deep grave.\n\nThat is how I would like to cease,\n\nheld in a lover’s arms and quickly\n\nfading to black like an old fashioned\n\nmovie embrace. I hate the white\n\nsilent scream of hospitals, the whine\n\nof pain like air conditioning’s hum.\n\nI want to click the off switch.\n\nAnd if I can no longer choose\n\nI want someone who loves me\n\nthere, not a doctor with forty patients\n\nand his morality to keep me sort\n\nof, kind of alive or sort of undead.\n\nWhy are we more rational and kinder\n\nto our pets than with ourselves or our\n\nparents? Death is not the worst\n\nthing; denying it can be.\n\n—from Rattle #30, Winter 2008\n\n__________\n\nMarge Piercy: “I have been writing full-time since 1968. That’s what I do. I’ve published seventeen novels, seventeen books of poetry, a memoir, edited one anthology of poetry and written two non-fiction books. I give poetry readings frequently (over 500 so far) in several countries and give speeches, lectures and workshops. I write for a living and I write because it’s my passion and I’d rather do it than anything else.”\n\nRelated Poems"
