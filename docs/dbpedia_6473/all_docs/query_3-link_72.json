        "text": "A woman is not a basket you placeyour buns in to keep them warm. Not a broodhen you can slip duck eggs under.Not the purse holding the coins of yourdescendants till you spend them in wars.Not a bank where your genes gather interestand interesting mutations in the taintedrain, any more than you are.You plant corn and you harvestit to eat or sell. You put the lambin the pasture to fatten and haul it in tobutcher for chops. You slice the mountainin two for a road and gouge the high plainsfor coal and the waters run muddy formiles and years. Fish die but you do notcall them yours unless you wished to eat them.Now you legislate mineral rights in a woman.You lay claim to her pastures for grazing,fields for growing babies like iceberglettuce. You value children so dearlythat none ever go hungry, none weepwith no one to tend them when motherswork, none lack fresh fruit,none chew lead or cough to death and yourorphanages are empty. Every noon the bestrestaurants serve poor children steaks.At this moment at nine o’clock a parterais performing a table top abortion on anunwed mother in Texas who can’t getMedicaid any longer. In five days she will dieof tetanus and her little daughter will cryand be taken away. Next door a husbandand wife are sticking pins in the sonthey did not want. They will explainfor hours how wicked he is,how he wants discipline.We are all born of woman, in the roseof the womb we suckled our mother’s bloodand every baby born has a right to lovelike a seedling to sun. Every baby bornunloved, unwanted, is a bill that will comedue in twenty years with interest, an angerthat must find a target, a pain that willbeget pain. A decade downstream a childscreams, a woman falls, a synagogue is torched,a firing squad is summoned, a buttonis pushed and the world burns.I will choose what enters me, what becomesof my flesh. Without choice, no politics,no ethics lives. I am not your cornfield,not your uranium mine, not your calffor fattening, not your cow for milking.You may not use me as your factory.Priests and legislators do not hold sharesin my womb or my mind.This is my body. If I give it to youI want it back. My lifeis a non-negotiable demand."
