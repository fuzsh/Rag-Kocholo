        "text": "Marge Piercy is an American poet, novelist, and social activist. Her work includes Woman on the Edge of Time; He, She and It, which won the 1993 Arthur C. Clarke Award; and Gone to Soldiers, a New York Times Best Seller and a sweeping historical novel set during World War II.\n\nPiercy is author of more than seventeen volumes of poems, among them The Moon is Always Female (1980, considered a feminist classic) and The Art of Blessing the Day (1999), as well as fifteen novels, one play (\"The Last White Class\", co-authored with her third and current husband Ira Wood), one collection of essays (\"Parti-colored Blocks\" for a Quilt), one non-fiction book, and one memoir. She contributed the pieces \"The Grand Coolie Damn\" and \"Song of the fucked duck\" to the 1970 anthology Sisterhood is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings From The Women's Liberation Movement, edited by Robin Morgan.\n\nHer novels and poetry often focus on feminist or social concerns and focus on women's lives. Most notably, her novel Woman on the Edge of Time is considered a feminist classic, and has been credited as the birthplace of Cyberpunk.\n\nPiercy's poetry tends to be highly personal free verse and often addresses the same concern with feminist and social issues. Her work shows commitment to the dream of social change (what she might call, in Judaic terms, tikkun olam, or the repair of the world), rooted in story, the wheel of the Jewish year, and a range of landscapes and settings.\n\nIn 1977, Piercy became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media."
