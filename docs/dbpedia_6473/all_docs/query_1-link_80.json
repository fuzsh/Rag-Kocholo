It’s a way to stretch how you think about language, and play a bit. This poem by Marge Piercy (b. 1936) was a recent featured poem. It’s a bit harsh and a bit funny, and more than a bit insightful about how art and artists are perceived in our society.\n\nFor the young who want to\n\nBY MARGE PIERCY (1980)\n\nTalent is what they say\n\nyou have after the novel\n\nis published and favorably\n\nreviewed. Beforehand what\n\nyou have is a tedious\n\ndelusion, a hobby like knitting.\n\nWork is what you have done\n\nafter the play is produced\n\nand the audience claps.\n\nBefore that friends keep asking\n\nwhen you are planning to go\n\nout and get a job.\n\nGenius is what they know you\n\nhad after the third volume\n\nof remarkable poems. Earlier\n\nthey accuse you of withdrawing,\n\nask why you don’t have a baby,\n\ncall you a bum.\n\nThe reason people want M.F.A.’s,\n\ntake workshops with fancy names\n\nwhen all you can really\n\nlearn is a few techniques,\n\ntyping instructions and some-\n\nbody else’s mannerisms\n\nis that every artist lacks\n\na license to hang on the wall\n\nlike your optician, your vet\n\nproving you may be a clumsy sadist\n\nwhose fillings fall into the stew\n\nbut you’re certified a dentist."
