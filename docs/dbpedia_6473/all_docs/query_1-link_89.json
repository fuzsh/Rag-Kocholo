        "text": "Who shall bear hope, who else but us?\n\nAfter us is the long wind blowing\n\noff the ash pit of blasted genes, or after,\n\nthe remarrying of the earth and the water.\n\nWe must begin with the stone of mass\n\nresistance, and pile stone on stone on stone,\n\nbegin cranking out whirlwinds of paper,\n\nthe word that embodies before any body\n\ncan rise to dance on the wind, and the sword\n\nof action that cuts through. We must shine\n\nwith hope, stained glass windows that shape\n\nlight into icons, glow like lanterns\n\nborne before a procession. Who can bear hope\n\nback into the world but us, you, my other\n\nflesh, all of us who have seen the face\n\nof hope at least once in vision, in dream,\n\nin marching, who sang hope into rising\n\nlike a conjured snake, who found its flower\n\nabove timberline by a melting glacier.\n\nHope sleeps in our bones like a bear\n\nwaiting for spring to rise and walk.\n\n.\n\nby Marge Piercy\n\nYour text here\n\nI’ve read a few poems by the prolific poet, novelist and social activist Marge Piercy and found them all powerful and enigmatic (and I greatly enjoyed reading the colourful story of her life so far on her website). This one was sent to me by a friend and resounded in me during this week of new lockdown restrictions, where hope has felt a bit beyond reach at times. I don’t claim to quite understand it all, so rich and almost dense her words are with references and meaning – and I won’t try to say too much about it as I feel the meaning is somehow beyond her words. It takes me to a place in my being that is more able to be grounded and embodied, present and connected – where challenges and difficulties in myself and what I see around me could also lead me to detachment, overwhelm and disconnect. Just mulling it over, saying the words out loud, has felt comforting. ‘Hope sleeps in our bones like a bear waiting for spring to rise and walk’…\n\nThis poem is an excerpt from a longer poem ‘Stone, Paper, Knife’ which appears in Marge Percy’s collection also called Stone, Paper, Knife (Pandora Press, 1983).\n\nYour text here\n\nPhoto by Sergei Akulich on Unsplash\n\nAuthor: Kristine Mackenzie-Janson\n\nKristine has been practising Tibetan Buddhism since 2000, and spent four years working and practising meditation on Holy Isle, Scotland. She has trained extensively with Rob Nairn and has been teaching mindfulness and compassion as a lead tutor for the Mindfulness Association since its early days.
