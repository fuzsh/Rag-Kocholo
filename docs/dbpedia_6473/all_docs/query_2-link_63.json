        "text": "It might be an exaggeration to say that Wellfleet saved Marge Piercy’s life — the tough-talking Detroit native would probably have made it anywhere — but in 1969, at 33 years old, her New York City doctor gave her a lifestyle-related, three-year death sentence.\n\n“When I moved here, I’d never lived anywhere but the center of cities,” Piercy says from her Wellfleet home, which is surrounded by gardens and trees and animals. “I was sick from the pollution in New York” — and from smoking cigarettes.\n\nThe day Piercy received that news, she walked out of the doctor’s office and never inhaled another puff of smoke. Because she waited until she was deathly ill to quit, she would lose her voice or run a fever if she encountered even a whiff of smoke.\n\n“They called me a fascist because I’d ask them not to smoke, because I couldn’t breathe,” Piercy says.\n\nBut, as always, Piercy was simply ahead of her time. The pollution in the city pushed her to move to Wellfleet in 1971, where she was forced to start planting immediately, because the house-builder gorged the slope and it was eroding.\n\n“I planted trees, beautiful trees, all kind of bushes for the birds,” she says, and found that she loved gardening.\n\nThere are flowers galore and a vegetable garden that this year yielded a bumper crop of her incredible heirloom tomatoes. Bees buzz by, cats look out windows, creatures scamper under vegetation — all of which contribute to Piercy’s poems.\n\nShe has written 19 volumes of poetry — most recently, “Made in Detroit,” published in 2015, and “The Hunger Moon: New & Selected Poems 1980-2010” — as well as 17 novels (including some sci-fi), a memoir and nonfiction, and will be honored this Friday at the Provincetown Public Library with the Rose Dorothea Award. The prize is given by the Provincetown Board of Library Trustees to pay tribute to nationally respected writers who work on the Outer Cape. Piercy certainly qualifies. Educated at the University of Michigan and Northwestern and the recipient of four honorary doctorates, she is an antiwar, environmental and feminist activist. The award reception, which comes at the onset of the weekend-long Provincetown Book Festival, will include a poetry reading and is free and open to the public. Piercy says that she hasn’t yet put the poems together that she’ll be reading, but that she has an idea of what will be included.\n\n“It’ll be slanted toward the Cape, with some poems that aren’t,” she says, adding that she’ll read political poems and various things about life and death.\n\nShe won’t be reading from one of her novels. The 82-year-old says she’s written her last, “The House at Hope’s End,” which is with her agent in New York City. It’s being shopped to big publishing houses, but Piercy, in her candid way, says it won’t find one. That’s because the book is about elder abuse and land squabbles and, Piercy says, no Yale graduate trust fund kid in New York will be interested. If peddling it to the biggies doesn’t work, they’ll aim for a small literary press.\n\nThough she says that she’s too old to start a new novel — one that she might not finish — Piercy is still writing short stories, a collection of which, “The Cost of Lunch, Etc.,” was published three years ago, and poetry.\n\n“Poems are much more intense than prose,” Piercy says. “They’re much more portable. People use them in ways they don’t use fiction.”\n\nHer poems have been read at weddings, birthdays, memorials, anchored to refrigerators by magnets and tacked over computers. And many of them describe the beauty — and sometimes the demise — of her chosen home.\n\n“Wellfleet was a very different place in those days,” Piercy says of the ’70s. “There was hardly anyone with money. People could still live off the land. It was a really funky place.”\n\nThe people she encountered were young hippies, fishermen and “a lot of working people.” There was a candle factory, a bowling alley that showed movies and a dry cleaners in the center of town. But best of all, there was nature all around it.\n\n“I began to pay attention to the moon, the tides, all sorts of things,” Piercy says. “And it was really good for me as a poet.”\n\nIt continues to be. Take “We live with her here,” which was recently published in The Lunar Calendar:\n\n“When I was a child/ I saw the moon, watched/ it growing and shrinking./ Then for years in cities/ I forgot it existed. Neon/ streetlights replaced it./ When I moved among trees/ deer, foxes, nor’easters/ hurricanes, blizzards/ I began to see her again/ pulling at tides and loosing/ them, rising a ripe/ tomato out of the sea./ She hangs in the pitch pines./ She pushes through/ my bedroom window/ washes my bed in silver/ makes the cats giddy./ I live now with the moon/ aware of her cycles even/ when she hides.”\n\nPiercy doesn’t just see beauty, she’s sees brute reality. Her conscience caused her to refuse an invitation to read — at Laura Bush’s request — at the White House.\n\nThat's because George W. Bush “got us into a war we’ll never get out of. He was a poor president,” she says, but adds that Donald Trump is more horrifying. “He is an evil, dangerous man.”\n\nIt’s clear that the president doesn’t care about people, Piercy says, because he separated young immigrant children from their parents, with no thought of the psychological aftereffects. She has never shied away from controversial subjects, and her words are strong.\n\n“We’re past, I think, the tipping point,” Piercy says. “The world will survive us.”\n\nThere may be a mass human extinction, she says, and relates it to the fate of the dinosaurs, which roamed the planet for millions of years without damaging it and still became extinct. But right now, she’s not going anywhere.\n\n“I lived in France and I discovered how very American I am,” Piercy says. “I’m not going to make that mistake again — unless it becomes politically dangerous to stay here.”\n\nWhat: Rose Dorothea Award reception and poetry reading by Marge Piercy\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday\n\nWhere: Provincetown Public Library, 356 Commercial St.\n\nAdmission: Free\n\nMarge gets a Rose"
