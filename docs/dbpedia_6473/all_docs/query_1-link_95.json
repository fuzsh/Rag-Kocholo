I will share a few of these poems for Poetry Friday, starting with a very homely, very cozy poem written by Marge Piercy.\n\nAs stated in Knopf’s website,\n\n“A reflection on language from the lively, aromatic kitchen of Marge Piercy, this poem originally appeared in her collection My Mother’s Body.”\n\nMany thanks to JoAnn at Teaching Authors for hosting Poetry Friday this week!\n\nHouse built of breath\n\nWords plain as pancakes syruped with\n\nendearment.\n\nSimple as potatoes, homely as cottage\n\ncheese.\n\nWet as onions, dry as salt.\n\nSlow as honey, fast as seltzer,\n\nmy raisin, my sultana, my apricot love\n\nmy artichoke, furry one, my pineapple\n\nI love you daily as milk,\n\nI love you nightly as aromatic port.\n\nThe words trail a bitter slime like slugs,\n\nthen in the belly warm like cabbage\n\nborscht.\n\nThe words are hung out on the line,\n\nsheets for the wind to bleach.\n\nThe words are simmering slowly\n\non the back burner like a good stew.\n\nWords are the kindling in the woodstove.\n\nEven the quilt at night is stuffed with word\n\ndown.\n\nWhen we are alone the walls sing\n\nand even the cats talk but only in Yiddish."
