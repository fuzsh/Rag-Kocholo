        "text": "I don't know much about Marge Piercy, except for the few poems that I have read - all of which are wonderful inspirations. In the Feminist Companion to English Literature - edited by Virginia Blain, Isobel Grundy and Patricia Clements, and put out by Yale University Press, I found an entry. Here are some excerpts: she is a \"novelist, poet, political activist.\" Her mother, Bert Bernice Bunnin, was given a man's name \"because her father resented a third daughter.\" She was born in 1936 in a working-class section of Detroit and raised as a Jew by her mother and grandmother. She received her BA from the University of Michigan and her MA from Northwestern University. In the 1950s and 1960s she wrote many novels that were \"too feminist and too political\" to be published. As a policital activist she has been gassed at demostrations and beaten by US Nazis. She now lives in Cape Cod with her third husband. This entry on Piercy also gives a few synopses of her work. I hope this helps, and good luck.\n\nÂ—Amy"
