        "text": "Watching televised coverage of Hell on Earth—a.k.a. the Effects of Global Warming as seen in a wildfire, hurricane, or floating ice shelf near you—I am always struck by those who make like Bartleby the Scrivener and “choose not to.” Leave, in this case.\n\nStubborn? Stupid? Principled? We can agree to disagree, but we can also agree that it makes interesting fodder to chew on.\n\nAnd what about us? Put in similar straights, watching the majority around us act one way, would we go against the grain or fall in? Somehow, we’re not sure until we get there (and, in many ways, hope we never get there).\n\nThe poet Marge Piercy found choosing to stay notable enough to write about. She starts with robins and whales, then moves on to people to show that such behaviors are part of nature and not particular to humans.\n\nRemnants Still Visible\n\nMarge Piercy\n\nRobins migrate, all schoolchildren\n\nlearn but here on the Cape, every\n\nwinter a flock forms and stays,\n\nlong frigid months after their\n\ncompatriots have flown south.\n\nThey live deep in the woods on\n\nhips and berries wizened by cold.\n\nSometimes they appear here\n\namong the feeder birds, one\n\nor two almost outcasts.\n\nOff Alaska when humpback whales\n\nleave in fall as the waters freeze\n\nand the world turns white, heading\n\nfor mating grounds off Hawaii\n\nand Mexico, certain whales remain.\n\nWhat makes a creature stay when\n\nalmost all of its kind have moved on?\n\nIn burned-out areas of Detroit,\n\nyou’ll notice one house still wears\n\ncurtains, a bike locked to the porch.\n\nSometimes in the suburbs among\n\ntract houses with carpets of grass\n\none farmhouse lurks, maybe even\n\nwith a barn. I imagine its owner\n\ngrey and stubborn, still growing\n\nthe best tomatoes for miles, refusing\n\nto plant inedible grass, fighting\n\nneighbors about her chickens,\n\na rooster who crows at four,\n\nher clothesline a flag of defiance.\n\nNote how stanza four starts with the central question, the catalyst for creativity in the first place: “What makes creatures stay when / almost all of its kind have moved on?”\n\nI remember reading Elie Wiesel’s Holocaust book, Night. His family and fellow Jews had all kinds of warnings about the approach of the Nazis and consequences that might follow when they marched into his hometown, yet his family and the vast majority of the rest chose to stay. It’s hardwired.\n\nAs for Piercy, the much simpler example is the farmer who refuses to yield to suburban sprawl and its silly neighborhood covenants (e.g. Thou shalt not have a clothes line where public eyes can see the horror of it all).\n\nIn this case, you almost want to cheer for her rooster and that “flag of defiance” known as wind-flapping underwear and brassieres.\n\nNow pass the tomatoes."
