        "text": "I want to personally thank Marge Piercy.\n\nHigh school, 1982. My mother gave me Piercy’s collection of poems, The Moon is Always Female. My mother knew this was knowledge I needed, but she did not want her own despair to overwhelm me. By giving me this book of startling poetry, I think my mother was saying “Here are words that can inform and inspire you without dimming your light. Here is womanhood – and you can still have the strength and love to inhabit it.”\n\nI want to say over the names of my mothers\n\nlike the stones of a path I am climbing\n\nrock by slippery rock into the mists.\n\nMarge’s words awoke my consciousness towards injustice (feminism, classism, racism) and I’m glad I got a somewhat early start. Marge’s life and words helped steer me through the 80’s backlash against feminism; a very gas-lighty era for women. Ronald Reagan, uber-frilly gunny sack dresses, Jerry Falwell, the extreme Right’s attack on the ERA.\n\nThroughout my life, I, as many women have, weathered deep insults towards my womanhood from daily street harassment to callous office behavior to impersonal media depictions to emotionally abusive intimate relationships. I have struggled to voice my personhood while navigating the social currents that bend to confine women to something manageable. I know many women who have defied the roles society heaves on us, and I know many women who have relinquished their hope. I too have relinquished in ways I never expected.\n\nBut I won’t say, “Now more than ever we need feminist dystopian literature” – because let’s face it, we’ve needed feminist dystopian literature all along. Creating a well-crafted, imagined world so that women’s full dimensional voice can be heard (and exist!) has, through its relative brief life, bolstered a crucial dialogue about the brutal and unfair conditions of women’s lives. It has also kindled acts of bravery for individual women, both public and private.\n\nAnd thank god writer, Marge Piercy, has been a big bad river of novels and poetry – often speaking to and for the female underdog. Marge Piercy’s writing has been imperative to social change – if only we could time travel and send it back say a few thousand years and change things sooner.\n\nMarge’s own life is a victory story. Born in 1936 in Detroit, Michigan she grew up in a tough neighborhood steeped in racism and poverty. The first of her family to attend college, she won a scholarship to the University of Michigan, earned her M.A. from Northwestern University and has received four honorary doctorates.\n\nMarge’s first of nineteen books of poetry was published in 1968, and her first of seventeen novels, in 1969. She has written a memoir, a play, a collection of short stories and four non-fiction books, as well as been included in over 200 publications worldwide. She has presented her work in over 400 universities around the world.\n\nShe has been a devoted activist – a member of Students for a Democratic Society, the New Left, the Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press, involved in the civil rights movement and anti-war movements.\n\nShe has written many voices – clearly, powerfully. She has created a worldwide audience for decades and that audience has, in turn, augmented her dialogue by continuing to read her and recognizing themselves in her characters and poems. It is through this recognition that individual readers have been inspired to inhabit a very active role in their own lives. To bout the despair that comes with being marginalized and to step beyond what has been relinquished.\n\nOh – and by passing her books onto their children. Thanks, mom.\n\nOK. Trump era. No woman U.S. president (yet). Not total equal pay or equal representation in the media. Or access to free birth control. Sexual violence. Rape-splaining… OK. Maybe now more than ever we do need to hear these words:\n\nChilled, cranky, fearful\n\nin the dark I wait and I am all the time\n\nclimbing slippery rocks in a mist while\n\nfar below the waves crash in the sea caves…\n\nPOEMS BY MARGE PIERCY\n\nHer rack of fancy shoes\n\nMy mother was vain about her feet,\n\nsmall, always sore. I can see her\n\nsoaking her feet in some smelly\n\ncombination of household products.\n\nShe had few dresses but many shoes.\n\nsamples she called them, bought cheap\n\nat some specialty place. And where\n\ndid she manage to go in them? Once\n\nshe had danced but no more. They\n\ntraded dinners with other couples;\n\nmostly the guys worked at Westing-\n\nhouse with my father in the shop.\n\nBut the women got dressed up. It\n\nwas for most of them their only\n\nchance to put on make-up, high\n\nheels, a dress smelling faintly of dry\n\ncleaning, scent from a bottle kept\n\ndusted on their vanity. Mille fleurs\n\nmy mother had all my childhood.\n\nI think it was my older brother’s gift.\n\nShe loved to get fancy, reminding.\n\nherself of long past happy days\n\nwhen she could dab hope behind\n\nher ears and onto her wrists\n\nand go laughing into a night\n\nthat surely would romance her.\n\nShe still imagined then some man\n\nwould whisk her into a rainbow.\n\nThe goddess who can evaporate\n\nWater, water –substance of which\n\nI am mostly made. Always people\n\ncomplain there is too much of you\n\nor too little. We need you but take\n\nyou for granted like air or dirt. You\n\nflow downhill, even as the Romans\n\nunderstood, for miles with the slightest\n\ninclination rushing over aqueducts.\n\nI immerse in you each morning, some\n\ntimes later after getting dirty, muddy,\n\nsweaty, smelly. You make me clean,\n\nsufficient to draw lips to my skin.\n\nYou freeze hard enough to walk on\n\nhard enough to crush a house.\n\nYou turn into bullets of hail. You\n\nentice us to glide bladed over you.\n\nYou look blue, you look green, grey,\n\nbrown, even black—but unless you\n\nbear debris, a glassful is transparent\n\nas glass. The mother of us all, we\n\nare not precious to you but you\n\nshould be to us. Without you in us\n\nwe die. With you all around us, we\n\ndie. You are the goddess who gives\n\nand takes with many hands reaching\n\nup, reaching down, held straight out:\n\nI don’t know why people worship old\n\nmen with beards instead of you."
