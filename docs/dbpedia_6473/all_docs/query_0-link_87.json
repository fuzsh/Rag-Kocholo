        "text": "Marge Piercy\n\nFriends and readers,\n\nI’m pretty sure I’ve never written a blog on Piercy’s poetry, much less about her as a central foremother poet in English, though I’ve written blogs on her novels, memoirs, and blogs on feminist and other issues where I’ve quoted her poems. I love them — as well as those of her books I’ve read thus far. On her End of Days; on her Cat Poetry; “Sleeping with Cats.” Earlier blogging: Three Women (rescued from an attack by a virus).\n\nI would like this evening to share as an interlude between my summaries of the Virginia Woolf virtual conference I joined in on, her\n\n“Right to Life”\n\nA woman is not a pear tree\n\nthrusting her fruit into mindless fecundity\n\ninto the world. Even pear trees bear\n\nheavily one year and rest and grow the next.\n\nAn orchard gone wild drops few warm rotting\n\nfruit in the grass but the trees stretch\n\nhigh and wiry gifting the birds forty\n\nfeet up among inch long thorns\n\nbroken atavistically from the smooth wood.\n\nA woman is not a basket you place\n\nyour buns in to keep them warm. Not a brood\n\nhen you can slip duck eggs under.\n\nNot the purse holding the coins of your\n\ndescendants till you spend them in wars.\n\nNot a bank where your genes gather interest\n\nand interesting mutations in the tainted\n\nrain, any more than you are.\n\nYou plant corn and you harvest\n\nit to eat or sell. You put the lamb\n\nin the pasture to fatten and haul it in to\n\nbutcher for chops. You slice the mountain\n\nin two for a road and gouge the high plains\n\nfor coal and the waters run muddy for\n\nmiles and years. Fish die but you do not\n\ncall them yours unless you wished to eat them.\n\nNow you legislate mineral rights in a woman.\n\nYou lay claim to her pastures for grazing,\n\nfields for growing babies like iceberg\n\nlettuce. You value children so dearly\n\nthat none ever go hungry, none weep\n\nwith no one to tend them when mothers\n\nwork, none lack fresh fruit,\n\nnone chew lead or cough to death and your\n\norphanages are empty. Every noon the best\n\nrestaurants serve poor children steaks.\n\nAt this moment at nine o’clock a partera\n\nis performing a table top abortion on an\n\nunwed mother in Texas who can’t get\n\nMedicaid any longer. In five days she will die\n\nof tetanus and her little daughter will cry\n\nand be taken away. Next door a husband\n\nand wife are sticking pins in the son\n\nthey did not want. They will explain\n\nfor hours how wicked he is,\n\nhow he wants discipline.\n\nWe are all born of woman, in the rose\n\nof the womb we suckled our mother’s blood\n\nand every baby born has a right to love\n\nlike a seedling to sun. Every baby born\n\nunloved, unwanted, is a bill that will come\n\ndue in twenty years with interest, an anger\n\nthat must find a target, a pain that will\n\nbeget pain. A decade downstream a child\n\nscreams, a woman falls, a synagogue is torched,\n\na firing squad is summoned, a button\n\nis pushed and the world burns.\n\nI will choose what enters me, what becomes\n\nof my flesh. Without choice, no politics,\n\nno ethics lives. I am not your cornfield,\n\nnot your uranium mine, not your calf\n\nfor fattening, not your cow for milking.\n\nYou may not use me as your factory.\n\nPriests and legislators do not hold shares\n\nin my womb or my mind.\n\nThis is my body. If I give it to you\n\nI want it back. My life\n\nis a non-negotiable demand.\n\nExpectant, of all life might offer, a digital picture by Lida Ziruffo\n\nEllen"
