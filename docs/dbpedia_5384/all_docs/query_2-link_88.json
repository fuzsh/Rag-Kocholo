        "text": "I began by visiting an old restaurant where the owner taught me to make rouyan, dumplings stuffed and wrapped with pork.\n\nThat is, dollops of minced pork sheathed in hunks of pork pounded into strips.\n\nThis local delicacy, which translates as \"meat swallow\" — a reference to the bird — dates back 140 years to Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) Emperor Guangxu, my host explained.\n\nHe recounted its history as we thwacked pork atop a polished tree stump with mallets for 20 minutes until the meat was just a few millimeters thick, causing my palms to tingle and eventually go numb.\n\nHe later invited me to serve the ones I'd made to customers, whose raised eyebrows revealed they hadn't expected a blonde-haired, blue-eyed waiter to be carrying steaming bowls of their order to their table.\n\nIndeed, not only every dish, but every eatery in Sanfang Qixiang has a story, as one person I met during my visit told me.\n\nMore storied, however, are the roughly 80 ancient dwellings. Larger-than-life historical figures lived in these large historical manors, endowing this tiny community with an outsized impact on this vast nation.\n\nPerhaps most preeminent among these is the rented residence where national hero Lin Zexu was born into poverty in 1785 and spent the first 20 years of his life.\n\nLin served as an official in 14 provinces and is still a household name for publicly burning 1.18 million kilograms of opium that British traders had smuggled into China in the early 1800s.\n\nAs rain tip-tapped on the courtyard's black ceramic shingles, I sipped Fujian's well-known rock tea with Lin's sixth-generation descendant, an affable elderly woman named Lin Zhuguang, with whom I've since kept in touch by WeChat.\n\nLin Zexu is arguably Sanfang Qixiang's most acclaimed native, but by no means its only celebrated resident."
