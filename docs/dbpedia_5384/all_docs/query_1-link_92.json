        "text": "Lin Fong Temple and Lin Zexu\n\nLin Fong Temple is also known as âChi Hu Palaceâ, âGoddess Templeâ and âNew A-Ma Templeâ and âNew Templeâ. According to the records in âPictures of County Government Officesâ in âEvents in History of Macaoâ, the name âNew A-Ma Templeâ was recorded, while the name âNew Templeâ was written in âMacaoâs Front Viewâ in âEvents in History of Macaoâ.\n\nLin Zexu (1785-1850), whose courtesy name was Yuanfu, born in Houguan, Fujian Province, was a politician, thinker and poet in the late Qing Dynasty, regarded as the national hero of the Chinese Nation and who was the representative among the people who promoted the ban on smoking. In 1838, he, as the Governor-General of Huguang, was appointed by the Qingâs government as the Imperial Commissioner, and was sent to Guangdong Province to investigate and ban the use of opium. In 1839, after Lin arrived in Guangzhou, he forced the British merchants to hand over 20,000 boxes of opium and destroyed all of it. He also ordered the merchants on business ships from different countries to sign the contract which stated that if the merchants were found to transport opium, the goods and the ships would be confiscated and the relevant merchants would be punished by the Qingâs laws immediately. In the same year, Commissioner Lin, accompanied by Deng Tingzhen, the Governor-General of Guangdong Province and Guangxi Province, came to Macao to investigate, stationed at the Lin Fong Temple, and met the Portuguese officials in Macao at the pavilion in front of the Tin Hau Temple in the Lin Fong Temple. Lin âpromoted grace and majesty of Qing, and declared the order of ban explicitlyâ, requesting the Portuguese administration of Macao to cooperate in banning smoking, and also not to shelter any British merchants. He also requested the Portuguese administration of Macao to order the residing British to leave Macao. Therefore, Linâs stationing in the Lin Fong Temple had important historical significance.\n\nThe statue of a standing Lin Zexu, situated in the Lin Fong Temple, was built in 1989 by the Lin Fong Temple Charity Association. The statue was created by famous sculptors, Tong Daxi and Lin Bin, and the screen made of a carved stone tablet was added in 2008, following the completion of the status. The couplet which means: âAs long as it is good for the nation, I am prepared to sacrifice my life for the nation. Why should we avoid doing something good for our nation just because it is harmful to our individual interest, while willing to do something bad for our nation just because we can benefit from it individually?â is carved on the screen. Beside the statue of standing Lin, there is the Lin Zexu Memorial Museum of Macao, constructed and administered by the Lin Fong Temple Charity Association. The Museum was completed in November 1997."
