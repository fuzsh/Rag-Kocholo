He was from Fuzhou, Fuian Province. Lin's forceful opposition to the opium trade was a primary catalyst for the First Opium War. He is praised for his constant position on the \"moral high ground\" in his figh, but he is also blamed for a rigid approach which failed to account for the domestic and international complexities of the problem. The Daoguang Emperor endorsed the hardline policies advocated by Lin, but then blamed Lin for the resulting disastrous war.\n\nAptitude[]\n\nStarting Aptitude: 13\n\nSpecialty: Strength, Charisma\n\nName Aptitude Stars Book EXP Academy Codex Opium Eliminator Strength 5 1,000 --- The Book of Changes Intelligence 2 400 Yes The Great Learning Politics 1 200 Yes Treatise on the West Charisma 3 600 --- Novice Poems on Lin Zexu Charisma 2 400 ---\n\nSkins[]"
