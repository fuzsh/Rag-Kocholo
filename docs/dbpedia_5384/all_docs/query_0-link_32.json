        "text": "Photo taken on June 23, 2020 shows a sculpture on the square of the Opium War Museum in Humen Town, Dongguan City, south China's Guangdong Province. Humen Town, located in the center of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, is rich in history and culture. In 1839, Lin Zexu, a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) official who led the fight against opium smuggling, destroyed smuggled opium confiscated from foreign dealers at Humen Beach. The event highlighted the determination of the Chinese government and people to resist drug abuse, and the following Opium War opened the modern history of China. Over more than 40 years of reform and opening up, the town has made solid progress in industrial manufacturing, which greatly developed the real economy here in Humen. (Xinhua/Liu Dawei)\n\nLin Dong, the former senior governor of South China's Hainan Province who is under investigation for serious disciplinary violations, is not a descendant of national hero Lin Zexu, according to a clarification by the Lin Zexu Foundation on Sunday.\n\nChina's top disciplinary watchdog earlier announced an investigation into Lin Dong. Media reports claimed that he was the son of the famous naval admiral Lin Zun, and a descendant of the patriotic Qing Dynasty general Lin Zexu.\n\nThe Lin Zexu foundation published a statement on late Sunday night, dismissing rumors that Lin Dong was a descendant of Lin Zexu.\n\n\"Lin Zexu is from Fuzhou, [East China's] Fujian Province, while Lin Dong is from Haikou, Hainan. What makes him a descendant?\" said the statement, quoted by Lin Zun's daughter Lin Huaqing, \"My father [Lin Zun] has three daughters and no son. This is all well documented.\"\n\nLin Huaqing also condemned the defamation of national heroes. \"Lin Zexu is a Chinese national hero revered by the Chinese people. We will not allow anyone to smear his name by pretending to be his descendant, or indiscriminately defame him.\"\n\nLin Dong, former Party Secretary and Director of Hainan's Transport Department, is suspected of serious disciplinary violations, and is currently under disciplinary review and investigation by the Hainan disciplinary department, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said on its website on Saturday.\n\nBorn in 1960, Lin Dong is a CPC member who has held a number of government positions in Hainan, including a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Sanya Committee and mayor of Danzhou. He retired in March 2020.\n\nAs a leading scholar and official of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), Lin Zexu is regarded as a national hero and patriot in China's modern history. He is best known for his firm resistance against foreign aggression in the fight against the British opium trade in the First Opium War (1839-42) and later for promoting the revitalization of traditional Chinese thought and institutions in China's Self-Strengthening Movement.\n\nGlobal Times"
