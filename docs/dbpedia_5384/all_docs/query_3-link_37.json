        "text": "Lin Zexu (1785 â1850) was a Chinese scholar and official during the Qing dynasty. Lin was born in Fuzhou. In 1811, he received the Jinshi degree, the highest in the imperial examinations, and the same year, he was appointed to the prestigious Hanlin Academy. He rose rapidly through various grades of provincial service and became Governor-General of Hunan and Hubei in 1837, where he launched an opium suppression campaign.\n\nHe is most recognized for his conduct and his constant position on the High Moral Ground\" in his fight, as a Shepherd of his people, against the opium trade in Guangzhou. Although the non-medicinal consumption of opium was banned by Emperor Yongzheng in 1729, by the 1830s China's economy and society were being seriously affected by huge imports of opium from British and other traders based in the city. Lin's forceful opposition to the trade on moral and social grounds is considered to be the primary catalyst for the First Opium War of 1839â42. Because of this firm stance, he has subsequently been considered as a role model for moral governance, particularly by Chinese people.\n\nAlthough he was not seen as such until well into the twentieth century, Lin Zexu is now seen as a National hero for Chinese people; no less than three films have been made on his role in the Opium Wars; and he is now one of the symbols of modern China's resistance to European imperialism.\n\nÂ Source: nethelper.com\n\nEditor: Wang Moyan"
