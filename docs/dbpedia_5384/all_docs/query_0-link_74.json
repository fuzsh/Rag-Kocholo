        "text": "30 Sep 2005: Fuzhou, Fujian Province\n\nBuddha Jumps Over the Wall\n\nA restaurant in Fuzhou claims to be the birthplace of the super premium Chinese delicacy called Buddha Jumps over the Wall (佛跳墙). The name itself is an allusion to the dish’s ability to entice the vegetarian monks to partake a meat-based dish. While you think this is purely exaggeration, the dish is actually prepared with more than 20 ingredients including chicken, ham, pig tendons, sea clams, dried scallop, shark fin, abalone and pigeon egg; and stewed over low fire for many hours in a jar for holding Shaoxing wine.\n\nI have heard so much about Ju Chun Yuan Restaurant (聚春园) that I decided to at least try its Buddha Jumps over the Wall before leaving Fuzhou. The price of this delicacy was obviously out of my business meal budget, I paid it out of my own pocket for the experience. The next day, I shared my superb food adventure with my boss and colleagues. Sandy’s eyes brightened and announced: “Tonight, we shall go to Ju Chun Yuan to celebrate the completion of this 3-weeks assignment!” That’s how I ended up having this delicacy two day in a row!\n\nThere are many stories surrounding the origin of the dish. But the most commonly story told is about a scholar from the Qing Dynasty traveling by foot with his friends. While traveling, he kept all his food in a clay jar used for holding Shaoxing wine; which he would warm the ingredients over an open fire whenever he was having a meal. When they arrived in Fuzhou, the scholar started cooking the dish. The smells spreaded over to a nearby Buddhist monastery where monks were meditating. One of the monks who was so tempted by the smell that he jumped over the wall to see what’s cooking.\n\nFuzhou Fish Balls\n\nA trip to Fuzhou would not be complete until you tried the Fuzhou Fish Balls (福州鱼丸). Today was our last day here; the local suggested that we packed home some Fuzhou fishballs. And they brought us to Fu Xin Fuzhou Fishball Store (福信鱼丸店), purportedly the best in this city.\n\nFuzhou fish balls are different than regular fish balls because they contain a meaty filling of lean pork or shimp in the middle. The fish wrap is made from fish flesh of shark, eel or fresh fish.\n\nThe Litchi Meat\n\nSweet sour pork (咕咾肉) is a common dish in China. But there is a slight twist of the taste in Fuzhou and that is the Litchi Meat (荔枝肉). It is so named because its color, shape and taste are all similar to that of litchi. The subtle blend of the sweet, sour and refreshing litchi taste simply makes it unforgettable.\n\nOld Duck Soup\n\nAnother dish which I enjoyed tremendously was the Old Duck Soup (lao ya bao or 老鸭煲). This is a whole duck casserole whereby a duck is simmered in a large earthenware pot along with choice cuts of tender bamboo shoots, Chinese wolfberries and other delicacies to produce a rich and fulfilling broth.\n\nI believe Fuzhou will continue to develop its prosperity through its well rounded tourism industry. As its Chinese suggests, this city could one day become a State of Fortune (“fu zhou”)"
