The Chinese employed the tonshi, compradors (trade intermediaries) and merchants, some of whom were barely competent in the two languages, whilst the British recruited colonial administrators and missionaries. Some in the British camp not only collected and analyzed piecemeal materials, but also assumed active parts in shaping the course of events. The paper attempts to portray the roles played by the translators and interpreters of both parties, and the backgrounds of individuals and the position they enjoyed in their respective camp will be analyzed to determine the different attitudes that the two camps held towards translators and interpreters.",
