From the very beginning, Renault has built cars that bring drivers closer to what matters. Where others chased ever more complex technologies, we focused our innovation on our drivers' real needs as well as those of the future, creating cars that enhance our lives and leading the way in electric mobility. And now it's time to take things further, by looking closer at where we are... It's time to discover the unlimited potential of the world on our doorstep. And it's time to move towards innovative mobility solutions that put the focus on where we are, and make more of what we have â€” our resources, our talents and our communities. This is #LaNouvelleVague.
