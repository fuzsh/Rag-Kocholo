        "text": "We reached our 2025 profitability target in 2022.\n\nWe generated €2.7 billion by end-2022 and are well on track to meet our €3 billion target in 2023.\n\nAnd we have set our R&D spend above 8%.\n\nThe Renovation phase has started and is standing on firm ground.\n\nThe Group is now organised by brand, and this new configuration is producing results: Renault, Dacia and Alpine are now strong independent business units, and the Group has created Mobilize to take on the new challenges facing mobility. This reorganisation was the first step to streamline the Group around consumers’ needs and to transfer the focus to performance.\n\nAt the same time, we will market the best line-up in these past 30 years, with 25 launches from 2022 to 2025. This new range is designed to position the Group on the most profitable market segments while it aims for the smallest environmental footprint in its sector.\n\nIn 2023 we are embarking on the Revolution phase: our full transformation to tap into all the growth opportunities arising from the automotive sector’s reshuffle. Our ambition is to become a Next Gen automotive company.\n\n5 value chains, 5 focused businesses\n\nWe know that our organisation needs nothing short of a full transformation. And it has started.\n\nIt involves creating two new entities (Ampere and HORSE Powertrain Limited, a joint venture with Geely) alongside the three existing ones (Alpine, Mobilize and The Future Is NEUTRAL). They are all centred around intrinsically profitable business operations, open to outside investment and built around a consistent array of technologies. They all have autonomous governance bodies and clear objectives. They are:\n\nThe Renault Group's traditional core business will continue to develop combustion and hybrid vehicles under the Renault, Dacia and Renault LCV (light commercial vehicles) brands, each with its own dedicated organization and governance. These activities are grouped together under the Power name.\n\nPower will draw on the innovative, low-emission engines offered by HORSE Powertrain Limited, the new joint-venture of Renault Group and Geely and joined in June 2024 by Aramco ;\n\nAmpere, an EV & Software pure player born from Renault Group to lead electric transition in Europe;\n\nAlpine, a high-end zero-emission global brand with a racing pedigree;\n\nMobilize, built around a leading financial services company to enter the market of new mobility, energy and data-based services;\n\nThe Future Is NEUTRAL, the first 360° circular economy company in the automotive industry from closed loop in materials to battery recycling.\n\nRenault Group, a team of teams\n\nWhile agility and specialisation are key to supporting this transformation, our metamorphosis is also based on a common trunk and solid roots. Our expertise, our teams, our values and our commitments are the cement and the strength of the new Renault Group organisation.\n\nA major technological and industrial group built around a portfolio of benchmark, complementary entities and brands, with the ambition of being a next generation automotive company.\n\nA committed group that encouragenovation that is fair in economic, environmental and social terms, for more sustainable, safe and accessible mobility.\n\nA 100% digitised group that we want to be more efficient and that concentrates its energy on the most strategic and value-creating missions:\n\nSetting the medium- and long-term strategic course, and the sustainable development trajectory;\n\nSupporting all the entities and business;\n\nDelivering economies of scale and synergies;\n\nEncouraging innovation and transforming skills;\n\nEnsuring consistency across the board, including the Alliance.\n\nPower, the traditionalcore business of Renault Group.\n\nWe bring together within Power:\n\nICE & hybrid passengers cars of the Renault brand;\n\nICE & hybrid passenger cars of the Dacia brand;\n\nLCVs and the technology and service revolution afoot in this segment.\n\nIn addition, on 31 May 2024, Renault Group & Geely created HORSE Powertrain Limited, the world leader in powertrains, to develop a range of efficient, low-carbon internal combustion and hybrid engines and contribute to the decarbonisation of mobility, by combining the technological, manufacturing and R&D assets of the two companies.
