        "text": "Here is the question confronting Carlos Ghosn: Can his team of 40 French executives rescue a loss-plagued Japanese car company with 40,000 employees?\n\nMr. Ghosn, an executive vice president at Renault S.A. who is known as Le Cost Killer, is now leading the French car maker's plan to invest $5 billion in the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's No. 2 auto maker. Approval of the arrangement was formally announced today in Tokyo.\n\nHis job would be formidable almost anywhere. But he has to turn around a company that is at the center of Japan's insular industrial establishment.\n\nNo other Western executive has ever reached such a pivotal position in one of Japan's corporate giants. And even few Japanese executives have had to push through the breadth of change needed by Nissan, which acknowledges $36.5 billion in debt, stemming from losses in five of the last six years and a poorly selling array of boring-looking cars and trucks.\n\nRenault itself was once plagued by losses and inefficiency until Mr. Ghosn reversed the trend starting a few years ago. His game plan at Nissan will depend on an ability to push through drastic changes in Nissan's dull designs, its Byzantine purchasing system and indeed its entire socio-economic chain of suppliers and affiliated companies, which altogether employ 200,000 people.\n\nOn paper, industry analysts say, the opportunities are rich. In practice, no one really knows whether it will work.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
