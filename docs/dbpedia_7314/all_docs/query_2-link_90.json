        "text": "The global agreement - \"Building the world of work together within Groupe Renault” - was signed between Thierry Bolloré, chief executive officer of Renault, Valter Sanches, General Secretary of IndustriALL, the French trade union federations and the other trade union federations or unions represented within the group committee, and Eric Vidal, secretary of the group committee.\n\nThe agreement, signed by the ten trade union federations or unions represented in the Group Works Council, provides a basis for structuring social dialogue, both at Group and local level. It offers the possibility and encourages the launching of new initiatives, as well as finding relevant pragmatic solutions to improve employees' life at work, through the negotiation of local agreements.\n\nThrough a sustainable approach, the new agreement addresses many aspects of life at work, and particularly those that enable employees to combine performance and well-being.\n\nThis approach, which involves all the Group's employees, is based on five fundamental principles:\n\nA dialogue on the evolution of the world of work\n\nA collaborative management system\n\nA sustainable commitment to inclusion\n\nWork-life balance\n\nAdaptation of the working environment\n\nThis new agreement complements the global framework agreement signed on July 2, 2013, \"Committing together for sustainable growth and development\". It confirms the Group's commitment to respect fundamental social rights and incorporates the Convention adopted this year by the ILO to combat violence and harassment at work.\n\n\"The agreement puts into practice one of the conclusions of the ILO's centenary: the future of work is not written in advance, it depends on what the labour actors will do with it, particularly through social dialogue. I welcome the signatories of this agreement who are part of this voluntarist and positive perspective with regard to the challenges of labour transformation.\"\n\n- Guy Ryder, director general of the ILO"
