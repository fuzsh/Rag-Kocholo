        "text": "This practical, cleverly designed family car proved incredibly popular for Renault – more so than it was really prepared for. A European Car of the Year win early in its lifecycle helped, but even so at one point the firm’s Douai plant was pumping out cars at a rate of 2,500 a day. They’d expected demand to be under 500…\n\nDecade 11: 2008-2018\n\nThe most recent period in Renault’s history and the motoring landscape is changing. Car firms are scrambling to launch cleaner and more efficient vehicles, and the alliance with Nissan allowed Renault to capitalise on this by taking technology developed in the Leaf and installing it in the Clio platform to create the Zoe BEV.\n\nUntil this point there hadn’t been a normal-looking pure-electric car for those who don’t want to stand out. It’s an indication that the sands are shifting as EVs move towards the mainstream.\n\nDecade 12: 2018-on\n\nWhat’s next for Renault? We’re expecting a new Clio in 2019 and the long-awaited Alpine A110 project will hit roads before 2018 is out, but it’s the company’s electrification strategy and development of autonomous technology that’s likely to play the biggest role. Oh, and Mitsubishi’s joining the Renault-Nissan party too, so we can expect platform-sharing abound."
