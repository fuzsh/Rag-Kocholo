        "text": "Merger could lead Nissan to take models such as its Titan pickup truck off the American market to give way to the competing Dodge Ram full-size pickup.\n\nWhen Nissan Motor Co. relocated its North American headquarters from Los Angeles to suburban Nashville in 2005, the move underscored a key point — the company had become a manufacturing force in Tennessee and Mississippi.\n\nNow the Japanese automaker, which operates major assembly plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Canton, Mississippi, faces the biggest corporate change since it was spared bankruptcy in 1999 by forming an alliance with French carmaker Renault SA.\n\nFiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, the Netherlands-based company that controls Detroit’s Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brands, has sought a merger with Renault, which owns 43.4% of still-independent Nissan. A deal would put in one camp the maker of Dodge pickup trucks, Jeep sport utility vehicles and Nissan’s competing fleet of the Titan, Rogue and Pathfinder.\n\nRenault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard flew to Yokohama, Japan, and outlined the deal Wednesday to Nissan’s board of directors and officials from the third alliance partner, Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Motor Corp.\n\nNissan could press to split away from Renault and remain independent, although after Wednesday’s meeting, Nissan leaders declared a Fiat Chrysler-Renault-Nissan tie-up might be possible, reported Nikkei, a Japanese newspaper.\n\n\"We are not opposed,” but “many details need to be worked out” before Nissan gives its full consent to the merger proposal, Nikkei quoted an unidentified Nissan official as saying.\n\nBringing together Italy-based Fiat and Renault could open way for Nissan and Mitsubishi as well as Chrysler and its Dodge and Jeep brands to operate under one umbrella company. Then the various partners could share engineering and technology and reduce design and production costs going forward as electric cars take on a larger presence on roads throughout the world, analysts say.\n\nU.S. auto industry analysts are still unsure how a merger on this scale might change the American automotive landscape. One possible outcome would have Nissan and Fiat Chrysler sharing technology and engines and Nissan in turn taking rival models such as its Titan pickup truck off the American market to give way to the competing Dodge Ram full-size pickup.\n\n“I think there would be a plan for rationalizing product portfolio &mldr; going forward. It makes no sense for the Titan and Ram to compete,’’ said Kristin Dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the Center for Auto Research, a think tank in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nDziczek cautioned public details about the proposed deal are minimal now. She pointed out the proposal could change dramatically. The Italian government owns a stake in Fiat. The French government owns a stake in Renault. President Donald Trump earlier sought to use tariffs to bar automotive imports into the United States on national security grounds. Japan’s government is interested in the health of Nissan, that nation’s No. 2 automaker.\n\nDziczek said the four governments could weigh in on a proposed merger to protect markets, plants and workforces in their respective nations.\n\nSUPPORT LOCAL JOURNALISM: Our Memorial Day sale gives you unlimited access to the Commercial Appeal for a low price\n\nOne argument pushing the proposed deal forward is slim profits. Fiat Chrysler as well as the Renault-Nissan alliance are pinched by tight profit margins at a time when the auto industry must find capital to afford new technology for next-generation vehicles such as driverless electric cars.\n\n\"Is Nissan in? Or is it out?” Michelle Krebs, executive analyst in Detroit for market researcher Autotrader, said about Nissan participating in a Fiat Chrysler-Renault merger.\n\nShe figured low profits might convince the Japanese automaker. “The whole point of this exercise is to beef up profit margins,\" she said, noting Dodge and Nissan have relied on profit-sapping consumer discounts to aid sales volume.\n\n“They’re not doing that well,” Krebs said about Nissan. “They were challenged before any of this began.”\n\nSharing technology and product design offers a means of cutting costs. Similar sharing arguments were made when Renault, Nissan and the smaller Mitsubishi formed their alliance. One difference now: Nissan faces no Renault competition in the United States, while Mitsubishi has limited U.S. sales, giving Nissan a sales path clear of its partners.\n\nHiroto Saikawa, who became Nissan chief executive officer in 2017, now must ensure if a merger occurs, Nissan can get the technology, capital and market access it needs. “It's really important for Nissan to jockey for an equal position\" among the five automakers, Katsuya Takeuchi, senior analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Japan, told The Associated Press. The five refer to Fiat, Chrysler, Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi.\n\nNissan earlier this spring refused Renault’s offer to more fully integrate the two companies. On Wednesday, Reuters, a news service based in Europe, reported Saikawa and his lieutenants appeared surprised by the latest merger proposal, “stoking concerns that a deal with Fiat Chrysler could weaken Nissan’s relations with Renault.”\n\nAs a result of the alliance, Nissan owns 15% of Renault, a non-voting share considered minor compared to the French automaker’s stake in Nissan. This imbalance has created past tensions among senior leaders of the two companies.\n\nFormer alliance chief Carlos Ghosn’s ambassadorial style kept the sides amicable, analysts say. However, the French executive, formerly head of both Renault and Nissan, was indicted in Japan last year on charges of misstating deferred compensation and later on charges of misappropriating funds. In January, Senard replaced Ghosn as Renault chairman.\n\nSenard has not demonstrated Ghosn’s knack of forging harmony among the partners. “Renault and Nissan have each viewed the other as trying to capitalize on the leadership vacuum,” The New York Times reported.\n\nCredit rating agency Moody’s, which cut Nissan’s credit grade last week, released a report saying: “It is unclear if the Nissan-Renault-Mitsubishi Motors alliance can advance their cooperation without resolving the cross-shareholding issue, which has been a source of contention.”\n\nAt Nissan operations in the United States, it has been business as usual while the top executives in Japan and France try to figure out the path going forward. No official information has been released to its 22,000 U.S. employees.\n\n‘‘We’re just continuing to closely monitor the discussion,” said Chris Keeffe, spokesman for Nissan North America in Franklin, Tennessee."
