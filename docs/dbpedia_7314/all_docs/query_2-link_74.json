        "text": "Alpine has gone-through multiple key changes to the team since the beginning of the ground-effect era. Primarily, the team principal has changed twice in the previous two seasons as Oliver Oakes joined the team recently in the mid-2024 season. Apart from this, Alpine has broken ties with Renult as they became a customer of Mercedes’ Power units from 2026 onwards.\n\nRenault employees have put forth a stern and irritated response to this massive change. Karine Dubreucq, a union representative of the Viry-Châtillon site, reflected on the move. The representative claimed that he or the company didn’t expect such a massive change which was uncalled for. Flavio Briatore‘s arrival to Alpine could’ve been one of the factors for the change.\n\nWe didn’t see it coming.\n\nKarine Dubreucq told L’Equipe\n\nAdditionally, Dubreucq noted that this switch was a ‘stab in the back’ and a betrayal. The representative further noted that Renault had continued to develop engines capable of winning 12 championships in the past. Hence, the fact that Alpine wasn’t willing to even wait for the first test bench of the new regulation engines was further shocking for the manufacturer.\n\nIt's a stab in the back, a betrayal. We have developed engines here capable of being F1 champions 12 times, and now we can't anymore? They didn't even wait for the first test bench. Karine Dubreucq added\n\nRenault could face a complete exit from F1 following Alpine’s switch\n\nRenault has competed in F1 for a very long time both as an engine provider and an independent team. However, Alpine was the only present team equipped with a Renault power unit.\n\nAs a result, following this move, the French manufacturer could face a complete exit from the pinnacle of motorsport.\n\nAt worst, there would be a 15-horsepower difference. We have redesigned everything in the turbo. If we stop here, we will never hear about a Renault engine in F1 again. An employee from Renault added\n\nAlpine’s disappointing performance in the 2024 season might have been the underlying reason behind the switch. As a result, Mercedes has successfully partnered with multiple teams for the power unit. Hence, the German manufacturer will have to put forth their best work on the new regulation engine to showcase a massive shift in the team’s performance."
