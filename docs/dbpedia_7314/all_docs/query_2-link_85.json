        "text": "The car manufacturer Renault Group takes the next step in their innovation journey by expanding their use of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to more than 20 000 of their employees. This is a part of a strategic plan that focuses on value creation.\n\nBeyond pure engineering design\n\nIn 2019, Renault’s inhouse Cooperative Innovation Laboratory (LCI) started to use the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to transform their innovation processes to the cloud. The plan was to connect all stakeholders to work on an electric experimental delivery vehicle named Renault EZ-FLEX.\n\nIn a press release, Laurence Montanari who was the senior innovation manager and head of the project at Groupe Renault, said:\n\n“The 3DEXPERIENCE platform opens new avenues for collaborative digital tools applied to the automotive world that go beyond pure engineering design.”\n\nOlivier Sappin, Vice President of Transportation and mobility industry at Dassault Systèmes also added:\n\n“The future for carmakers is not about just building individual vehicles or going from point A to point B. It’s about developing completely new mobility experiences that change how we live. Today’s established companies are being challenged by startups and newcomers that don’t have legacy systems and are agile from the get-go. A platform approach enables the LCI to reveal its knowledge and know-how and introduce concepts for potential new business models.”\n\nAccelerates transformation with 3DEXPERIENCE\n\nDuring 2021, Renault decided to take their work with the platform even further by adopt the platform globally. Leveraging the power of the platform, the company will develop programs for new vehicles and mobility services.\n\nIn a press release the company tells that 20 000 Renault employees will be able to draw benefits from the platform wherever and whenever. It means a completely new backbone to share product data in real-time and for managing virtual twins of diverse product configurations. It also means that a higher level of agility, a reduction of costs and the possibility to develop a new vehicle in a years time.\n\nLuca de Meo, CEO at Renault group, says that the platform demonstrates their beliefs in the leadership role of engineering and digital in the company’s “Renaulution”.\n\n“Our shift toward becoming a technology, services and energy company must be collaborative. The 3DEXPERIENCE platform connects engineering to all disciplines in one digital company. We will gain agility, speed, and effectiveness to develop new mobility faster than ever.”"
