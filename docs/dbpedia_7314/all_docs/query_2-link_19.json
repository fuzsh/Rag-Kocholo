        "text": "Unmistakably French / Car accessibility is a big issue in France and Renault has found a way play a positive part in the narrative, positioning itself as a contemporary brand with a clear, relevant mission.\n\nMobility deserts and the inequalities they create for access to employment are a well-known issue in France. The ‘crisis of mobility’ was even at the heart of the much-discussed series of protests known as the ‘gilets jaunes’ (yellow vests) movement, nicknamed for the safety vests worn by protesters – which sparked a political crisis. The trigger was Macron’s fuel tax, as people in rural France who have to drive long distances daily do go to work couldn’t afford the price increase.\n\n‘As small businesses have been dying in these smaller cities and towns, people find themselves forced to seek jobs elsewhere and to shop even for basic goods in malls,’ French sociologist Alexis Spire explained in the New York Times. ‘They need cars to survive, because regional trains and buses have declined or no longer serve them. Once you begin to unpack the Yellow Vest phenomenon, the uprising is a lot about mobility.’\n\nAllowing those on probation periods to use the vehicles they need to secure a job is a concrete way for Renault to provide genuine utility to French people, while addressing a topic that is close to their hearts. It positions Renault as a brand that not only understands the unique challenges of French people but also provides tangible solutions to address them.\n\nClever targeting / This campaign expands the brand’s presence in areas where people disproportionately use cars over other means of transportation.\n\nRenault strategically targets those living in isolated regions, where car ownership is not just a convenience but a necessity for daily life. Unlike urban centres like Paris, where alternative modes of transportation may be more prevalent, mobility deserts rely heavily on private vehicles for mobility. By meeting the needs of people in such areas, the car brand resonates among communities where car ownership is not just a luxury but a lifeline. It enhances its visibility directly where its consumer pool mostly resides."
