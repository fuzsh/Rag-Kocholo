You can update your choices at any time in your settings.\n\nARNAUD QUINTIN: The rapid rise of electric vehicles and the advent of disruptive technology has forced the automotive industry to undergo a profound transformation that has affected both our products and the way we organise our business. As such, we created entities that reflect each market segment: electric vehicles, premium, and so on. The idea being that we play different ‘sports’, each with its own business model, each with its own requirements in terms of funding and partners. In other words: create a brand-new ecosystem where expertise is shared among entities as fluidly as possible. That is the underlying principle of the Group’s governance. It will help us adapt to our rapidly changing industry.\n\nMATTHIEU WILLOT: In the past, the DNA of Renault Group was built on a ‘do-it-yourself’ culture. In a little over a decade, that has all changed with the arrival of a number of partnerships with companies ranging from Verkor (for EV battery production) to Google . While the Group was once a giant block, the Group’s brands ( Alpine , Dacia , Mobilize , Renault ) have become the company’s key drivers under the keen guidance of CEO, Luca de Meo .\n\nA. Q. : People will continue to do the same job with the same responsibilities, however the Smooth, fast, cross-cutting: what is Renault Group’s shared governance all about? Governance 34 way we work will change to encourage smoother collaboration between teams. For example, cars made at Ampere will incorporate a number of modules made by Renault Group outfits. This means putting in place new ways to help entities work together.\n\nM. W. : Governance and a corporate culture go hand in hand. With the Group being reshuffled into smaller subsets, teams are going to become more specialised (on EV, for example). We are moving away from the pyramid structure. That comes with a number of implications: we will be able to work faster and adopt a more entrepreneurial mindset to grow business. This is much in the same vein as the Trophée Frères Renault that we inaugurated two years ago as a way to acknowledge disruptive inventions made by Group employees that brought about considerable progress and change.\n\nA. Q. : Innovation lies at the heart of the current change. We are going to have to be fast and agile when making decisions. We have to work as a team. We are going to help employees embrace the new mindset through workshops, training sessions and the like, held throughout 2023. Teams have a lot of questions about changes the Group has seen over the past two years. We have to show just how hopeful we are for the future beyond 2024; what we are doing right now is simply extraordinary! It’s revolutionary! Unheard of in the automotive industry! You can’t bring about such change in just a few months… not even in a year!\n\nM. W. : In terms of HR, we are providing a lot of training modules, and focussing on bolstering our Group identity and a feeling of belonging. The idea being that, in the future, we will have a common corporate bedrock so every entity in the Group will fall under the same Group identity and HR policy. The Group policy will help people shift from one entity to the other, and make future change easier to bring about, while leaving entities their own level of autonomy and business specialisation. Negotiations are underway and have already started to bear fruit in terms of comprehensive healthcare, insurance, seniority, pay… We also want employees to share more in the company’s success thanks to the employee shareholder programme [the Group would like to have employees account for 10% of all shareholders by 2030, editor’s note]. We offered free shares and contribution matching, which were met with strong uptake. I get a strong feeling people are embracing it, they want things to improve."
