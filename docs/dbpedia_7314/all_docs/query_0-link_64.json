It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

Vol. XXIII. SIGNALS FOR TROLLEY CAR LINES. The use of signals for the protection of street railway and interurban lines has made remark- ably small progress in America. This is the more noteworthy owing to the great lengths of trackage on the interurban lines, and the high speed at which cars travel. In by far the greater number of cases the movement of cars is deter- In Great Britain the conditions are very different. We do not have the long stretches of line, nor the high speed, and there has not, therefore, been the same need for signals for the protection of opposing or following cars. What signals have been provided here have in all cases been placed where an obstruction prevented Signal Apparatus on Burton and Ashby Light Railway. mined by the schedule or time table, which may be modified by instructions from the train dis- patcher. This officer has the same functions as his namesake on a steam road, and acts as the nerve centre for a whole district, keeping in touch by telephone with all the cars and regulat- ing their movements in exactly the same way as a train dispatcher does with trains on a railway. opposing cars, each of which have to pass over a piece of single track, from seeing each other. There are about four well-known signal systems for trolley car lines in America, and about five in this country, and it is the purpose of this article to describe these. Taking America first, the oldest is that of the United States Electric Signal Company, the Digitized by Google THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. [January 2, 1908. system referred to by Lieutenant-Colonel Yorke, of the Board of Trade, in his report on his visit to America in 1902. It is somewhat a mis- nomer to apply the word ** oldest'' to this method of signalling. It was only introduced, in a crude form, in 1898, but the term is none the less true. The type of signal employed is illustrated by Fig. I. On the right is a red disc, pivoted at the sides, and 8 in. in diameter. As seen in the illustration, it has been turned clear, and indicates Fig. 1.— Exterior of Signal Box showing White Semaphore Set. that the section is free. On the left is a disc of similar size, but painted green in the centre and white on the outside. In the centre of the standard, and between the two discs, are two lamps, an upper and a lower. Behind these are electric bulbs which, when switched in, show red in the upper lamp to correspond with the red right hand disc, and white in the lower lamp to Fig. 2.— Interior of Signal Box showing Mechanism in Place. correspond with the left hand disc. In the upper part of the standard is the relay which operates the discs. Fig. 2 is a photographic view of the internal mechanism with the door open, and in the latter are the lenses through which the lamps give their light. These signals are employed for protecting sections of single track, and one is fixed at each end of a section and immediately inside the single line portion. In Fig. 3 is given the wiring diagram, with a car in the section proceeding from left to right. When the car, represented by the wheel, entered the block, it closed the right hand contacts of the trolley switch for an ijfistant, allowing the current to flow over the circuit represented by heavy dashes, through magnet A and over line wire No. 3, through the other sig- nal to the ground. The path taken is shown by the heavy full line. Magnet A on being energised throws over its contact lever, disconnecting the ground at this, the setting end, and cutting in a permanent feed from the trolley wire to take the place of the switch contact, which opens imme- diately after the car passes. This permanent feed also throws the white and green lamp and disc into signalling circuit, and this indicates to a motor- man that the danger signal is exhibited at the other end of the section. The other set of con- tacts closed by this magnet complete a circuit which starts in the outside contacts of both trolley switches. It will be seen upon looking at the diagram that the signalling circuit leads through magnet B^ at the other end, opening a pair of contacts known as the non-intefference device. These contacts open the setting circuit Trolley Switch WhiUiamp Explanatron Setfhiff Circuit Reiexisuig- •» ,_, , SigrtoL - ' Oj Fig. 3.— Wiring Diagram. White Lamp from the trolley switch, and prevent a car trying to enter from the opposite end, locking up the lever to magnet A^, which would connect both ends of the signalling circuit to the trolley wire, making a dead signal until some car passed out of the block. The circuit indicated by light dashes is known as the releasing circuit. When the car leaves the block, going in the direction shown by the wheel, it closes the right-hand contacts in the right-hand switch, thus allowing current to flow through magnet C^, which breaks the main signalling circuit, and also through magnet B which unlocks the lever of magnet A. The magnet A, now being de-energised and the lock open, allows the lever to fall back, and the system is in its normal position with no car in the block. The next American system to be noticed has advantages over the one just described inasmuch as it allows cars to follow one another through a section, which the United States system does not provide for. The improved method is the *' Eureka.'* Four sets of lamps are employed in Digitized by Google January 2, 1908.] THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD, this system. Before reaching the points and entering on the single line there is a two-way lamp, which may be termed lamp a. When switched in, it shows a red light to an approaching motorman, and when the other lamp is switched in, it shows a green light in the rear; the object of the latter will be noticed later. Im- mediately inside the single track section are a pair of lamps by c, only one of which can be alight at one time, and when the section is normal and unoccupied neither are burn- ing. At the far end of the section are three similar lamps, but facing the opposite direc- tion, with the green side of the lamp similar to a, facing an approaching motorman who has come through the section. Suspended immediately inside the section is a contact maker similar to that seen in Fig. 4. This has flexible teeth which, when pressed in by the trolley ^ 1 ' \\ j ' wheel, make con- tacts. On one side is a contact plate the whole length, and on the other side are two shorter plates. Included in the mechanism are two controllers- one for each end. When a car approaches the en- trance to the sec- tion no lights are burning. As soon as contact is made, one of the green lamps 6, Cy at the en- trance is switched in, which advises the motorman that the section is clear. At the same time the red light at the far end of the lamp similar to a, which we will Fig. 4.— Contact Maker for Overhead Construction. Fig. 5.— Semaphore Set at Clear. name rz^, is switched in, in order to stop any car from coming in the opposite direction. Should a second car wish to enter from the same end as the first, no red light would be showing in a, but the driver would see that a car was ahead of him by lamp b or c being alight. When the second car made contact, the only change in the signals would be that the lamp b (or c) would be switched out and its mate switched in. This would be an indication to the motor- man that all was working. The second car also moved the controller one notch forward, so that when the first car left the section the lights would remain burning, and as the man looked forward on passing the contact maker at the far end he would see that the green light in a^ had not been switched out, and it would be an indication to him that a car was following. For each car that enters, the controller is moved one notch forward, and as each car leaves at the other end, and the contact maker there struck by the trolley wheel, the controller is moved one notch back until all the cars are out, when the controllers are normal and all lights are switched out. Should a car enter against a red signal, all lights are switched out, so warning the erring and all motormen in the section. If the car stops, and backs out, the status quo ante is restored. The Blake Signal and Manufacturing Com- pany have a very good signal system for trolley car operation. It is not so much for protecting their working as for a train despatcher getting in touch with cars on the line. At each crossing place and station a signal is provided which normally is held upwards at \"clear.'' This is set to \"danger'* by the operation 6f a pendulum. In the train despatcher's office are a number of pendulums varying in length and corresponding to the number of signals under his charge. Should he wish to speak to a car approaching, say. No. 8 signal, and give the motorman instruc- tions, he puts a plug into No. 8 hole. This sets in motion No. 8 pendulum in his office by means of an electro-magnet. Each signal has an electro- magnet and a pendulum, which correspond in length with their fellows in the office, and which are all in series on a single wire. When a pendu- lum in the office commences swinging all those at the signals swing also, but the impulses are only cumulative in increasing the arc of vibration of that pendulum whose period is synchronous with the pre-determined period of electro-magnetic impulses. The intended pendulum in a few seconds swings through an arc of sufficient length to trip the lock holding the semaphore, and it at once falls to the \"danger\" position. A light is switched in simultaneously for night use, and a circuit is automatically completed which intimates to the train despatcher that the signal has responded. After the motorman has stopped and receives his instructions, he pulls a cord which again raises the signal to \"clear,\" as seen in Fig. 5. Digitized by Google THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. [January 2, 1908. The first signal installation on a British tram- way was carried out at Dover for Mr. Henry Stilgoe, then borough engineer, by Messrs. Saxby and Farmer. In Fig. 6 is a diagram of the lines protected, and in Fig. 7 is a diagram of the electrical connections between two signals. At the turn-outs pillars have been erected on which are placed the instruments which contain in the upper part two miniature signals, and below, pro- tected by a door, are four plungers, a pair, one white and one black, for each signal. The signal on the right hand side works simultaneously with the left hand signal of the next pillar on the right. As long as the signals are down the line is free, but no motorman may enter a section until he has pressed in the black plunger for the section he is entering, which raises his own signal and that at the far end of the section.

The Harison signal, designed by Mr. Harison Jones, is in use at Southsea, Twickenham, and Swindon. For protecting a single track the arrangements are as in Fig. 8. At the extremi- ties of a section there is a signal arm, S^ at one end and S^ at the other, which are carried on the trolley wire pillars. In the trolley wire are two switches — i, 2. When contact is made at switch i a circuit is completed through signal S^, preference solenoid p by the auxiliary wire, through locking solenoid /2 of signal S^. This locks the latter signal and lowers the former. When the car passes oflF switch I solenoid p is de-energised, and the signal arm goes to danger by gravity. Switch 2 is now reached, and this energises locking solenoid/^, which now locks signal S^, as well as S^, at danger, but when switch 3 is reached at the far end of the section solenoid w^ of S^ and w^of S^ are energised, and these unlock their respective signals. Switches 4, 5, and 6 act similarly for the opposite direction. Siemens Brothers and Company, Limited, are the makers of a signal system which is in use at Pontypridd. The arrangement of connections is as shown in Fig. g. A car, C^, is travelling from right to left. It has passed section in- sulator P and is taking current from the feeder F through the solenoid S^, and in so doing attracts the armature A^, so completing the circuit of the signal lamps L^ L*^ from the feeder F to the earth plate E^. Lamp L^ has a green lens, and when alight indicates a clear road. Lamp L^ has a red light, showing in the opposite direction and indicating danger, and these lamps, also those (L^ L^) for the opposite direction, are fixed 30 or 40 yards in advance of the section insulators. As the car passes under I^ the arm- ature A^ returns to its normal position, due to the current taken by the car C^ through the' solenoid S^. The Electric Tramway Equipment Company have an apparatus, illustrated by Fig. 10, which is in use on the Swindon tramways. The cast- Fig. 8.— Harison Signal. iron signal box is fixed on a pillar about 6 ft. above ground level. It contains two i6c.p. 250-volt incandescent lamps and a two-way switch. There is a box at each end of a section, and the four lamps are in series. No car is allowed to enter a section when the lights are burning. If they are out, the conductor must turn the switch before entering, which switches in the lamps. When he leaves the section at the other end he must turn the switch there, which extinguishes the lights. Fig. II represents the system installed by Messrs. Brecknell, Munro, and Rogers, of Bristol, on the Burton and Ashby Light Railway ; also at Bristol, Bath, Sheffield, and Wemyss. The method employed allows cars to follow each other through a section, but no opposing car may enter until all those from the opposite Digitized by Google January 2, 1908.] THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. direction have arrived and passed off the single line section. For each section there are employed four _S^ TroU^ Wirt Sfft H0m0r Fig. 9. overhead line contacts, two sets of lamps, and two switch boxes. Each road has an ingoing and an outgoing contact, which is attached to the trolley wire. The trolley wire is not broken, but goes straight through, and when the trolley head passes the contact the latter is pushed aside so that an electrical circuit between the trolley wire and the contact is closed. A car travelling from left to riglit first makes contact with a, which causes current to flow from the car into the rotary switchbox 6, causing magnet c to be energised, so that the rotary switch d revolves one step forward and thereby switches in the light e. Should a second car enter the section before the first had left, the rotary switch is moved another step forward. When the first car leaves the section it makes contact with a'^j Can traVelhng in Fig. 10. iponVir* orSrocHttArm Attaclmmt -cfc xf 7 1. 1! ■T± AS fc- Rotary Switch BOX Lamp 4 M Pot9 bona%d to Rail This Contact tob* set back ^ § tonoxth)lt ^JS. > f ? ^ c» ^ Rotary Switch Bo* Lamp Diagram of Cdnnectiont. >^ •Carttravoliingfn Lamp Rotary , Swftch Bom T Rotary Sm'tch Box I Satof Instruments /breach Block consists of A Line Contacts 2 Lamps \\ 2 Smtch Boxes :±7- Qpohbontfetf /I toRoi/ Aerial Wire \"SMsrsial Rail Trolley Wire Fig. 11.

The lamps may have a single light or may be provided with two or three lights as shown in Fig. 12, where it is considered necessary to advise a driver as to how many opposing cars are in the section. The lamps are protected by an efficient hood from being blinded by the sun's rays. BONDING. By E. Goolding. TR^tH-C L>M pp*- 9n '\"qml Fig. 12.— Connections of Rotary Switchbox of Breclcnell. Munro, and Rogers. car still in the section the light would remain burning until the rotary switch had been stepped back to normal. For a car entering from the other end, contact would be made at a'^ and broken at a^, and the light e'^ would govern the movements. One of the pair of ingoing contacts has to be 40 yards' length back from the lamp, so that it may light the liarnp at the other end before a car If it were not for the bonding of track rails the resistance offered by the joints would be so high as to prohibit the use of the rails as a conductor for conveying the return current back to the switchboard. At present, both tramways and railways take advantage of the track rails as a return conductor. The conducting power of steel rails depends upon their composition. Where a steel rail is used as a conductor only, and not as a track rail (such as a third or fourth rail on railways, and the tee conductor bars used on the conduit system for tramways), high conductivity is of importance, and the conductivity of such rails is usually about 15 per cent, that of copper, or in other words, one to seven of copper. Track rails, on account of the wear and tear to which they are subjected, have to be of harder steel, thus the conductivity varies from ten per cent, to eight per cent, that of copper, in the latter case the ratio being nearly one to thirteen of copper.

The ingoing contacts are staggered, so that there is no possibility, in the event of two cars passing under them simultaneously, of their both entering the block section, as the driver coming This high resistance greatly reduces the conducting values of the track, but owing to the heavy rails adopted in modern track work their use as a Conductor still entails an immense saving in copper. For example, tramway track rails may be taken at loo lb. per yard, in which case each rail has a sectional area of approxi- mately losq. in., and a double track will consequently have 40sq. in., which, at the ratio of 13 to i, the Digitized by Google January 2, 1908.] THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD conducting power if of the double track is equal to ^S=3sq. in. of copper. The limits within which track rails may be used as return conductors are regulated by the Board of Trade requirements, which stipulate that the diflference of potential (during the working of the tramway) between the points of the uninsulated return (or track) rails furthest from and nearest to the generating station shall not exceed 7 volts, and that the current density shall not exceed 9 amperes per square inch of rail. These regulations are necessary to obviate the electro- lytic action which might otherwise be set up in adjacent pipes if a greater difference in potential is allowed. Railways using the track rails as return conductors have as much as 20 volts drop, but in this instance the conditions diflfer from a tramway, inasmuch as there are no pipes (other than those belonging to the railway company) sufficiently near to be affected by electrolytic action; in addition the track rails being supported on wooden sleepers are, more or less, insulated from earth. It would be interesting to consider to what exten bonding affects the resistance of the track. Track rails are usually laid in lengths of 30, 40, or 60 ft., and it is therefore necessary that these lengths be made metallically continuous to obtain an efficient conductor. In one mile of single track (of 30 ft. lengths) there are 352 joints, and if in bonding 352 joints one bad bond is made it will neutralise the advantages gained by good bonding throughout the entire length ; in other words the strength of the chain is its weakest link. The exact type and size of bond to be used depends upon circumstances, but, whatever the type of bond employed, the greatest care must be exercised in the final fitting and bonding, the most vital point to be adhered to is to always allow the final cut to be taken out of bond holes with a fluted reamer, leaving the hole smooth and clean and a tight fit for the bond. It would, perhaps, be interesting at this point to draw attention to the necessity of allowing sufficient metal to be reamered out. The holes often being punched.

Owing to the fact that both track and third rails are usually laid in comparatively short lengths, there would be no efficient electrical continuity without bonding, as the only path would be through the fish plates (and in the case of tramway track the additional assistance of sole-plates) ; these of course materially assist the con- ductivity of the rail, but not sufficiently to be of practical service under the existing conditions and regulations ruling modern tramway and railway work. The main idea of bonding is to reduce the resistance of the track so as to comply with the Board of Trade regulations, and upon the following conditions depends the total resistance of the track : (i) Number of rails parallel. (2) Sectional area of rail. (3) Ratio of resistance of rail. (4) Number of joints per mile of rail. (5) Sectional area of bonds per joint. (6) Length of bonds used. it is not to be expected that they will be true. In addition, the effect of rust has to be considered. On a recent contract, involving the expenditure of some ;f8,ooo for bonding, it was found from experience that the holes must be punched \\ in. small to obtain a clean metallic surface in the hole when reamered. In fact, it is often an advantage to drill the holes i*« small, and then to have them reamered ; this, although expensive, prevents the reamers being damaged by the skin left in punched holes. It is most unsatisfactory, as regards the efficiency and life of the bond, to attempt to bond in rough, burred, wet, or oily holes, nor is it advisable to leave the hole for any length of time after reamering, as a surface of rust is liable to form and seriously affect good metallic contact. The burr left after reamering should be taken off with a countersinking tool so as to give a good edge for the bond to hold against. The bond terminal may with advantage project beyond the face of the hole, so that when the centre J in. Digitized by Google THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. [January 2, 1908. pin is driven in or the press is used this i in. projecting portion of the bond will act as a head to help keep the bond terminal ridged; these points are important factors in obtaining the economic use of the track rails as a return conductor. The actual resistance of a bonded track can only be obtained by measurement. This, however, is not always possible, but a close approximation can be arrived at with the assistance of the accompanying tables : Diagram No. i gives the weight, sectional area, ratio of resistance to copper and resistance per mile of the principal sizes of rail in use either for a single rail and single or double track (continuous unjointed length). Diagram No. 2 gives the area in square inches of the various sizes and numbers of bonds used per joint. Diagram No. 3 gives the percentage of resistance to be added (to table No. i) for bonding. Example So, 1, — Supposing it is required to obtain the resistance per mile of a single track with 90 lb. rail having a ratio of 11 to i of copper, and the rails being laid in 30 ft. lengths, and the joints bonded with two 000 S.W.G. 24 in. bonds ='0306 ohms. In the first instance by following the dotted line on diagram No. i the resistance of i mile of continuous single track to the above conditions ='026, and to this should be added the jointing and bonding resistance from diagram No. 3, the dotted line illustrating the point under con- sideration. First, from diagram No. i we have the resistance of a continuous single rail to the above conditions, and from diagram No. 2 the sectional area of two 000 S.W.G. bonds ; with these two items as a basis, we follow through on diagram No. 3 until we touch the line depicting 30ft. length of rail; the only condition then left is the length of bond, and by drop- ping down, to the 24 in. line we obtain opposite, the percentage of resistance to be added, which = 18 per cent. Resistance of continuous single track -- -026 Additional 18 per cent. = 0046 Total resistance of track 0306 Example No, 2, — In this case it is assumed we have one mile of single third rail, 100 lb. per yard, having a ratio of resistance of 7 to i and laid (60 ft. and 45 ft., average 50 ft.) 50 ft. lengths, and each joint bonded with two 5oo,oooc.M. gin. bonds = '0321 ohms. The same method is adopted as in the previous example, and if by following the full line (diagram No. I) for a single continuous rail the above area and ratio is found to be = '03 and the resistance due to bonding is shown by the full line, and is in this instance = 7 per cent. Then resistance of continuous rail ^ -03 Additional 7 per cent. - 0021 Total resistance 0321 The relative conductivity of the bonds is usually about J the conductivity of the rail for tramways, but on third rail, as very high efficiency is required, the con- ductivity of the bonds is often as great as the rail. In example No. i there are two 000 S.W.G. bonds per rail, or four bonds for the single track, which = '432 sq. in., and one 90 lb. rail = 9 sq. in. and 18 sq. in. for the single track, but since the ratio 18 of resistance is 11 to i, the track = - i'7sq. in. of copper, therefore the relative area of bonds ^ / ^ = ^ ^^ ^ ^ 432 4 the conductivity of the rail. It is usual to cross-bond every 40 yards between track rails, and every 80 yards between the inside rails in the case of double track. It is necessary to parallel the conductors so as to enable one to assist the other, and in the case of damage or repairs to any rail con- ductivity is thus obtained through the adjacent rails. This cross bonding has no eflfect on the resistance of the combined lines, and, although not necessary, these cross bonds are often put in the same size as those used in bonding the joints. This has been found advisable mainly for mechanical strength. THE BRIGHTON RAILWAY ELECTRIFICA- TION. It is now two years since the contracts were let for electrically equipping the Victoria and London Bridge section of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway. After what seems to be long delay, there is a prospect of the work being speedily completed. It may be remembered that the line is to be worked on the single-phase system, and it will be the first railway in this country to use that method. Winter-Eichberg single-phase motors will be used on the cars. Instead of a third rail as electrical conductor an overhead wire is used, and it carries the single-phase high-pressure alternating current. The track rails are employed for what is called the return, though that expression is hardly correct in the case of alternating current, seeing that rails and overhead wire are alternately positive and negative during every complete cycle. The rails, of course, are not insulated, so that there is no danger to life from them. During the half-period when they are positive the overhead wire, which is insulated, has a potential negative to earth, corresponding to its positive potential during the other half of the cycle Bracket Poles for Overhead Transmission. The rolling stock, which is being built by the Brush Company, and the electric equipment for it which is bemg manufactured by the British Thomson- Houston Company, are understood to be well advanced, and the arrangements of the London Electric Supply Corpora- tion, from whom the necessary energy will be pur- chased for providing the current, are also in a forward state. Cable ducts for the feeders have been laid along the side of the railway, the usual arrangement being shown in the accompanying photographic views, where it will be seen that the duct is carried a little above the ground on short supports. At one or two points on the line the work of erecting the overhead equipment has been begun by the con- tractors, Messrs. R. \\V. Blackwell and Company. The illustrations show two types of support used.

Owing to fore-shortening, the view does not show the structure of the bracket arm. It really consists of two parallel members spaced a few inches apart and tied together at the extremities. The arm is firmly secured to the pole, and is also supported from the top of the standard by two straps in tension. From this bracket arm the conductor wires for the two tracks will be suspended. The poles are spaced rather standards are built up of steel angle frames, tied together by short braces. It is expected that electric operation will begin in the coming spring. Except during the busier hours in the mornings and evenings, this line does not carry a heavy traffic, and, indeed, in the middle of the day the intervals between the trains are very long, considering that over practically all the route the country is built upon.

London do not appear to move about locally to any great extent. Owing to the shape of the route there is practically no through traffic, the detour from Victoria to London Bridge covering a distance of eight miles. Electric tramway competition in some parts tells against the line. With electric traction no doubt trains will be run more frequently and more rapidly. From a railway traffic point of view it may hardly seem worth while to have electrified the line, but under the new system it is to be hoped that business will largely increase. In any case the railway company wished to experiment with this electric system with an eye to possible future developments, and probably they could not get a better practising ground than this line, which is self-contained, and it may be called isolated, from the traffic point of view. The Torquay Tramways Company has been registered with a capital of ;£\" 120,000 in £1 shares. The objects are to adopt an agreement with the Dolter Electric Traction, Limited, and to construct, maintain, and work tramways authorised by the Torquay Tramways Act, 1904. London Omnibus Fares. — Under the agreement arrived at with the London underground railway companies, the omnibus companies raised their short distance fares on many routes on December 15 by the expedient of shortening the length of the penny stage. The increase applies to horse as well as motor 'buses. Probably the best- known of the long penny stages was that between Charing Cross and the Bank of England. It has now been divided into two overlapping penny stages. The electric 'buses which run over this route have not raised their fares, but these vehicles at present are few in number. London Tube Railway Fares.— A conference of representatives of the Baker Street and Waterloo, the Charing Cross, Euston, and Hampstead, the Great Northern, Piccadilly, and Brompton, the Central London, the Metropolitan District, the Metropolitan, the City and South London, and the Great Northern and City Railway Companies, was held on December 2 for the purpose of considering the question of fare revision. The subject was thoroughly discussed, as was a particular project for through fares between any two or more of the railways. On December 15 the revised fares came into operation between a number of stations on the District, Baker Street and Waterloo, and Piccadilly Railways. Several id., i^d., and 2jd. fares are raised by a halfpenny, and a few 2d. fares are increased to 3d. Digitized by Google lO THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. [January 2, 1908.

The past year has not been an exciting one in the field of electric traction, but it has seen some notable events both at home and abroad. In reference to foreign countries, it may suffice to say that electric lines continue to extend, that single- phase working is now definitely on its trial on a large scale on the New York and Hartford Railroad ; that the electrifying of horse lines and the construction of new electric tramways have been prominent features of the year both in the far east and in South America ; and that the great tunnel undertakings for connecting New York with Long Island and New Jersey are now far advanced. At home, the most important works in progress which were completed during the year were the Birmingham Corporation tramways, the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, the Euston extension of the City and South London Railway, and the electrification of the Hammersmith line of the Great Western Railway. The electric railway system of London now forms a network of com- munications of extraordinary convenience and efficiency. The electric railway work now in actual progress is confined to the single-phase installations for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in London, and for the Midland Railway at Morecambe. These will be com- pleted during the present year. Other authorised schemes have not yet been commenced. ♦ « ♦ Tramway construction has been confined to extensions of urban systems and the completion of some interurban lines. The most important work of the kind still in progress is the electrifi- cation of the great undertaking of the London County Council. This work on the south side of the Thames is nearly completed, but new lines are still building on routes where there were no tramways before. North of the Thames a great deal still remains to be done in changing from horse to electric traction, but the work is being pushed forward with considerable speed. But for the state of the money market, progress would have been still more rapid. Most of the construction is on the expensive conduit system, but a long line from Hammersmith to Harlesden on the overhead wire system is now being begun, and the G.B. surface-contact system is being installed from Aldgate to Bow. In Middlesex and Hertfordshire, further extensions have been opened of the great light railway system in these counties, while to the south-west the London United Tramways have been spreading further over Surrey. Surface-contact systems have been in evidence, as the year saw the completion of lines on the Dolter system in Mexborough, Hastings, and Torquay, the pro- posal for the same system being installed in Oxford, and the beginning of work on the G.B. system (as already referred to) in London. The prospects of new work for the year now beginning are large so far as London is concerned, but limited elsewhere. The Parliamentary proposals also are not of much importance. The two things most required for a revival in the sphere of new work are cheaper money and an amendment of the Light Railways Act. We should then see more activity in the construction of interurban electric lines. ♦ * ^(j In connection with operation, the amount of business done on most systems continues to increase, but net profits are not responding so satisfactorily as they ought. Wages tend to rise, but the process of reducing fares has been checked — in some places so effectively that better results may be hoped for. The two Digitized by Google January 2, 1908.] THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. II subjects which have been most discussed by those concerned in tramway operation and engineering are rail corrugation and braking of cars on gradients. Some advance of knowledge is observable regarding both these subjects, but more remains to be discovered, and Rome was not built in a day. The Halifax Two or three points of first-class Accident. importance emerge from the report of the Board of Trade regarding the late tramway accident in Halifax, when five lives were lost owing to a car running away backwards down a steep hill. The original circumstance which made a runaway possible was the failure of the current, arising from a circuit-breaker opening at the power-station. The car was in the process of climbing the hill at the time, and on the power disappearing a run-back at once began. The hand brake appears to have been ineflFective, and, apart from it, the reason why the car was allowed to gather speed was, that the electric brake was not properly applied. This again largely arose from the fact that some of the Halifax cars are fitted with one arrange- ment of electric braking, and some with another. For the express purpose of preventing run-backs, some of the cars have had modifications made in the controllers and wiring, and in the case of these controllers a different set of movements of the handles is required for braking purposes from those necessary in the case of the ordinary controller. Prominently to distinguish the one type of control from the other, a large B is painted on the case in front of the driver's eyes. But, in the moment of emergency, the driver tried to apply the electric brake in the old way, though it was one of the new type of controllers that he had. Thus, no braking effect was produced. The lesson from this is that all controllers and braking arrangements should be identical on every car on any given system of tramways. When a man is accustomed always to apply a brake by a certain movement, or set of movements, he may be trusted to execute these movements — almost semi-automatically, it may be said — when the moment of emergency, or even of terror, arises. But if he works sometimes with one system of control and sometimes with another, there is great risk, as in this case, that the wrong set of movements will be made, and, even if the driver discovers and tries to correct his mistake, the car has by that time gained high speed. * * * Another point, and one which is emphasised by the Board of Trade inspector, is the necessity for slipper brakes being of such a design that they can be applied instantaneously. In this Halifax case, the slipper brake was applied after the driver found his attempt at electric braking was useless. The car, however, was now running fast, and its speed was still further increased before the slipper brake could be fully applied. This brake is put on by means of a screw, and it requires several seconds to screw it firmly down. It has been demonstrated that once a car has exceeded a certain speed down a steep gradient, the mechanical slipper brake has little effect. But if this brake is applied in the earlier stages it is very powerful. Hence the necessity for instantaneous application. The inspector's remark as to the efficiency of compressed air for the purpose may lead to further experiments in that direction. The objections to compressed air in the way of complication and cost may be overcome. An alternative would be the magnetic track brake, so designed as to be also capable of instantaneous application mechanically. The reports of the committees now considering the question of braking ought soon to be available, and it may be hoped that the Board of Trade report on the Halifax case will come within the purview of these reports. Electric There is room for some doubt Railway Fares, whether the changes carried out during the past few weeks in regard to fares on the underground electric railways in London will lead to very much immediate increase of revenue. On a number of the routes the fares for the shorter journeys have been increased, this being rendered possible by an agreement with competing omnibus companies. If the number of passengers does not fall off, the increases in fares, while too small to make any material hardship to the individual passenger, will materially increase the gross revenue. In any case, there will be less of that too familiar operation of carrying passengers either at a loss or without appreciable profit. On the other hand, the system of through bookings Digitized by Google 12 THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. [January 2, 1908. between one railway and another is being exten- ded. In some cases this does not mean any reduction in fare, but in others it does, the through fare being a little less than the sum of the separate fares was. In this direction the benefit from increasing short-distance fares on any one railway may be partly neutralised. The convenience to the public arising from the abolition of re-booking at interchange stations is, however, so great, that a considerable increase of passengers may reasonably be looked for. Only time can show what the relative effects of these different influences may be. With the year 1908 a number of AllowcincG for tramway undertakings complete eprec a on. ^^^ ^^^^ decade of their existence, and from now onwards, it is to be expected that the already much-discussed question of deprecia- tion will demand more and more urgent atten- tion. To no class of persons is this matter of so much importance as to those who have invested their money in the companies which have em- barked in the supply of this particular public ser- vice, and it is to be feared that many will be losers by the inadequate estimate originally made, by the promoters of these enterprises, of the amounts it would be necessary to set aside for this purpose. The growing sense of what may be required is to some extent reflected in the figures given in the Records of Electric Tram- way Accounts published from time to time in our pages. • • • In 1904 the average provision, in the aggre- gate, for depreciation, by those towns having a combined station for lighting and traction purposes, was 76d. per car mile, while for those having a separate generating station the average was -eGd. per car mile. In 1905 the correspond- ing figures were 75d. and •85d., registering a partial decline, for which, however, the large towns were chiefly to blame. But the accounts for the year 1906 showed the growing tendency by a marked change, the average figures being 786d. for the first group, and i-oid. for the second group. When the accounts for 1907 are available, it is probable that the average pro- vision for depreciation will be found to be even further increased. No corresponding advance can be detected from the tables given of actual expenditure on maintenance and repairs, which have in each of the three years closely approxi- mated to an aggregate of one penny per car mile for all the towns whose accounts are included. This is because the opening of new track has been fairly continuous during the period, and the increasing expenditure on the older tracks has in this way been disguised. • • « In addition to the depreciation of the plant and structure of a tramway, which is all that is contemplated in the provisions among corporate undertakings thus examined, the companies must allow depreciation of another kind. There are few companies owning tramways that have not to expect the determination of their owner- ship at some date more or less definite and not very remote. This involves the amortisation of all expenditure which from its nature is not likely to be recoverable at that juncture. All cost of forming the company and obtaining the concession, including street improvements under- taken with the latter object, are comprised under this head, and investors should take note while there is yet time, of the manner in which these contingencies are being provided for. Tramway Useful information will be found signalling. [^i the present issue in regard to various systems of signalling used on tramways. This is a subject likely to be of more wide- spread importance in the future than it has been in the past. The large urban systems of tram- ways upon which attention has hitherto been so largely concentrated, consist for the most part of double track, and any system of signalling is accordingly unnecessary. But the future extensions of suburban and interurban light railways and tramways will probably consist very largely of single track with passing places, and it is on such lines that systems of signalling will be largely required. By an efficient system of the sort it is possible on routes of small traffic to have the passing places comparatively far apart, and annoyance and delay from cars meet- ing on single track are prevented. Even where the passing places are nearer one another, and the traffic heavier, a signalling system enables the cars to be worked more rapidly and economically, while more of them can be run without confusion.

Sir — The article on the Sandberg rail in your issue of December 5 has much interested me, in connection with Mr. Sandberg's valuable hints given to the Institution Conference on June ig last. I have been for several years increasing the silicon in my tramrail specifications, but have had considerable difficulty to contend with in the inert conservatism of consumers, manufacturers, and engineers ; and I greatly rejoice to see such a distinguished authority as Mr. Sandberg taking the matter in hand. Some little time ago, however, I was fortunate enough to possess the confidence of some enterprising clients, and I made them a specification which I reckoned, as it turned out rightly, would produce a better tramrail than was then known in this country, and which, before the completion of the order, I improved upon. I give below some extracts from my test sheets for this work, which in every way support' Mr. Sandberg's results : 1 1 Drop Tests. ! Weight, 3 ft. 6 in. 1 Bearings. I oft. tons. Tensile Tests.

Drop Test. — Mr. Sandberg does not give the length of his test piece ; mine was 5 ft., on 3 ft. 6 in. centres, as his ; my blow was only 10 foot-tons instead of 18 ; but on the other hand Mr. Sandberg's rail weighed III lbs. per yard; and though he does not give the moment of inertia of his section, its ratio to mine, to judge by modern tendencies in design, would be considerably greater than the ratio of the weights, so that I do not think my deflection would compare unfavourably with his. My second blow was delivered on the reversed rail, and the negative deflection denoted the final deflection in the sense contrary to that given by the first blow. Elongations. — Mine were taken on Sin. lengths, and if reduced on 2 or 4 in. lengths would give results exceeding those you quote. Tensile Tests. — I have given the best samples from each lot to show what the nature of the material was capable of; and also the average results for each lot, showing what is to be expected from manufacturing art. If Mr. Sandberg*s result is an average, it beats mine in this respect ; but, if it is a picked sample, it is not quite equal to mine. I should add that all these tensile pieces showed a distinctly fibrous texture at fracture. Impression Test. — My ball was of the same size as Mr. Sandberg's, but my weight was reduced to 30 tons, for reasons which are irrelevant here. If the impression depth you give is reduced proportionally (taking cup surface distribution as recommended by Brinell) your impression depth would be 2*37 mm., which shows a little softer than mine. I thought at the time that the fourth and fifth lots were the best I could produce ; but subsequent obser- vations have convinced me that I can better these, and I have prepared another specification, by which I expect to bring my mean results up to the best of those samples. I believe, however, that these rails have never shown corrugations. I am just now making some experiments to see if I can get a better specification on these lines for bridge steel. But, of course, the problem is altogether a different one from tramrails. I have, however, attained some encouraging results, and hope to assure them by further experiments. I am, Sir, Your obedient servant, 53. Victoria Street, S.W. JoHN H. BlAKESLEV. Dear Sir, — I have read with interest your editorial comment in the December issue re rail corrugations with Sandberg rails, and note that Sandberg rails on the District Railway have corrugated in three months' time, the process not being quite so rapid as with ordinary rails as expected. This is a considerable set- back to those who favoured the theory that harder rails would prevent corrugations. Taking the extra wear at 30 per cent., less 10 per cent, extra cost of manufacture, less the extra wear on tyres not yet reckoned with, there seems very little in favour of harder rails, especially when you consider the statement that neither Sandberg rails nor any other expedient has been found capable of preventing corru- gations on the District Railway. This brings us back to my last letter in your November issue, ** Why not deal with the cause instead of the result of a cause ; surely prevention is better than cure.\" Your paragraph re the rolling stock of the tube railways being identical should read, identical to the eye, but somewhat different, as proved by Parliament and Board of Trade inquiries re broken axles and defective trucks on the District Railway. Hence corrugations on the District Railway and not on the other three tube railways mentioned, which have only been running a comparatively short time. Given time, the other three mentioned will have corrugations if special care is not bestowed upon the rolling stock, with- out reference to any particular method of track laying. Yours truly, Liverpool Overhead Railway, J. A. PantoN. December 24, 1907. First Motor Cab Results. — The report of the General Motor Cab Company submitted to the first annual meeting on December 16, shows that in May last the total paid-up capital was ;f 372, 5 18. The authorised capital is £500,000. There had been a loss up to May of ;f9,682, but the profits since then have more than made good the debit balance, which arose when the operations were of a preliminary character. The average number of the company's cabs in service during the six months ended November 13 was 306. Mr. D. Dalziel. who presided at the meeting and moved the adoption of the report, said that since the closing of the accounts on May 13 last the board instructed the auditors of the company to prepare a balance- sheet for the six months ending November 13. The result was highly satisfactory. The average takings per cab per day during the whole of that period was £2 3s. 6d. thus exceeding the estimate set out in the original prospectus by 8s. 6d. per day. Five hundred cabs had been actually delivered, and the company were now beginning to receive deliveries of the second order of 500 Renault cabs. According to the duly audited balance-sheet the six months ended November 13 showed a net profit, with an average of only 306 cabs at work per day, of ;f4i,887 9s. lod. The directors had decided to declare an interim dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum on the preferred ordinary shares for the six months ending November 13. After writing off the debit amount of last year amounting to ^^9,682 and the amount necessary for the payment of the interim dividend, there remained about ;f2o,ooo.

The relation between technical journalism and per- manent technical literature is somewhat analogous to that between newspapers and history. The modern historian must needs make large use of the newspaper files, but unless he have a faculty for judicious selection, and the ability to make the material his own, and to fuse it into a connected narrative, his history will be little better than a newspaper scrap book; and just as there are many things in our newspapers, the omission of which we should resent, but which it would be absurd to reproduce in a history, so our technical newspapers must contain a mass of detail of only ephemeral interest, which is quite out of place in a text book, or even in a book of reference. When, for instance, the Great Northern and City Railway was first opened, it was probable that a good many engineers would be interested in the pattern of the collector shoes supplied to it by the B.T.-H., and the technical journals of the time were justified in giving illustrated descriptions of it ; but now most people either know of it or don't want to know, and the few who belong to neither class can get the knowledge in more complete form from the makers themselves, the pages given to it with large-sized illustrations, in Messrs. Wilson and Lydall's two volume treatise on ** Electrical Traction,''* may be taken as a sample of the things which might be omitted or condensed with advantage. But it is only a sample. The two volumes are crowded with minute detail in every part. No possible diligence could have made anyone personally acquainted with all this detail as a matter of his own observation ; its presence, whether desirable or no, marks the book as, very largely, a compilation, nor is it difficult, in most cases, for those familiar with the subject to trace the origin of the inspiration. This is not necessarily to condemn the book. It removes it at once from the class of books to be read, but it may still find a high place amongst books of reference. The value of such works depends greatly on their indices, and, so far as I have been able to dis- cover, these volumes are very perfectly indexed. They deal respectively with direct-current and alternating- current traction, and, therefore, it has proved convenient to have a separate index for each volume. Nearly all technical books may be classified as either text books or books of reference, and there is a hint in the preface to this work that it is intended as a text book for advanced students. It is well to say \" advanced.\" The tyro who should try to learn all about electrical traction from this book would need a vivid imagination to carry him from diagrams and illustrations to the practical realities they represent, and would be nearly driven mad by multiplicity of detailand deadly uniformity of style. The very iteration of the word \"type\" would haunt him, as ** boots, boots, boots, boots, moving up and down again \" got on the nerves of Kipling's South African recruit ; but the advanced student would be sufficiently advanced to have discovered for himself that engineering is to be learned in the shops, not from books; and, like other readers, will use the book for reference as he requires it. Indeed, the description, ** advanced student,\" should cover all readers, for the engineer who ceases to study soon drops out of the race. A text book should deal mainly with principles, and should touch lightly on details, using them chiefly for purposes of illustration ; should be orderly in arrange- ment, and should aim, as far as is possible, at securing * \" Electrical Traction,\" by Ernest Wilson and Francis Lydall, in two volumes.

Wilson aud Lydall just touch on the distinguishing features of the traction motor, and immediately plunge without further preface into calculation of performance curves, contriving to give the reader the impression, after making him wade through a barely intelligible r^sum^ of Goldschmidt's method of obtaining the heat- ing curve, that the labour has been spent almost in vain. There does not seem in this chapter to be any attempt at arrangement. The performance tests are followed by an official specification of the motor, in which the dimensions take the leading place, and the chapter winds up with a few casual remarks on lubrica- tion. That matters little in an encyclopedia on traction, which one consults through the index for the section one wants, but it is clearly a disadvantage in a text book, even for advanced students. The first of the distinguishing features of the traction motor is stated to be ** the motor is series wound.\" My first impression on reading this was, ** Why, here are two men writing on electrical traction who have never heard of regenerative control.\" But I was quite wrong; the index directed me to some very good and detailed descriptions of both the Raworth and the Johnson- Lundell systems (the wording of which seemed strangely familiar), followed by a paragraph or two of guarded but not unfavourable criticism. It may be said that the authors in their preface expressly disclaim any direct advocacy of one system rather than another, questioning, indeed, the competence of any but a very few engineers to decide on such matters, and therefore their occasional departure from that self-denying rule is the more significant. It is almost a pity that they should have put such a restraint on themselves. Criti- cism is the salt of technical literature, but the greater the need, the greater the merit in abstaining from it. The first edition of this book was published ten years ago, in one volume, and the advance in electric traction has been so great that the authors have found it neces- sary practically to re- write the whole. Still, some trace of the original may be discovered. On the very first page the reader is informed that **many traction systems are in operation,\" a sentence that seems almost gro- tesque in the present year. The first volume is divided fairly equally between tramways and railways, and is a very complete compilation, including even the Board of Trade regulations by way of appendix. The second volume is practically a separate book, having even the preface repeated. In its general outlines, in a complete devotion to facts that would delight the heart of Mr. Gradgrind, this volume is much on the same lines as the other. But there are other respects in which it differs. First, it deals wholly with railways, no one having yet attempted to run tramways on the alternate- current system. Secondly, its examples are drawn mainly from Continental experience, there being little to draw upon in America, and hardly any in this coun- try, where polyphase railway work has never been allowed a chance, and single-phase has hardly passed the experimental stage. Thirdly, since the theory of alternating-current motors, whether polyphase or single phase with commutators, is more complex than that of the direct-current motor, the authors have conceded more to the student, and added two or three chapters of somewhat elementary theory to their storehouse of fact. In this volume, too, they are more free with their comment, weighing the respective advantages and disadvantages of polyphase, single-phase, and direct- current traction, with an evident leaning towards single- phase. To the polyphase system they may be suspected of doing less than justice, especially in their assumption of equality of weight in its equipment with that of direct current. Both volumes contain chapters on costs, and on financial considerations in respect of the change to Digitized by Google January 2, 1908.] THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. 15 electric working ; matters usually outside the profes- sorial range. The second volume is also more orderly in its arrangement, and comes nearer to being a book which it is possible to read than does the first. There is a dreadful suggestion in the preface that the book is far from being complete ; -that specialists in each department of electrical traction will find imper- fections there, to be compensated for by what they can gather in other departments less familiar to them. I trust this, like their reluctance to criticise, is only another proof of the authors' modesty. In a sense, of course, it must be true. In a book mainly descriptive, it would always be possible to find something else to describe — there is no mention of the conformity line, nor of Warner trucks nor tracks. But completeness in this sense is neither possible nor desirable. It would mean twenty volumes instead of two, and before they could be issued they would be out of date. The authors have given us of their best, the publishers have pro- duced it in the best of type, with clear illustrations, and appropriately heavy paper and bindin^j^; and the Olivers who ask for more must indeed bo insatiable. Traction men have never had anything: quite like it before, and it were unreasonable to grumble at it because it is not something else, probably not nearly so useful. NON-FOULING FLEXIBLE TROLLEY HEADS. Taking first the swivelling type (Fig. i), it will be noticed that the socket which carries the fork spindle is not cast on to the pole piece, but it is on a separate bracket, which is mounted on a pin in the outer bracket, passing through a slot in the upper end of We have had brou^rht under our notice two really ingenious and successful trolley heads, which should give relief to the much-worried tramway engineer and his assistants, inasmuch as the troubles arising from the frequent jumping and entanglement of present swivelling heads, also the enormous wear and tear of the overhead work and wheels by the fixed head, are claimed to be things of the past wherever the Holmes and Allen trolleys are in use. The Wellington, New Zealand, Corporation Tramways, have purchased the license to manufacture and use these heads on their Fig. 1.— Non-Fouling SwiveUing TroUey Head. system, and the saving effected on fifty cars is calculated at about jf 1,000 per year. Nearly all the Australian systems also have Hoimes and Allen trolleys ruaning. Mr. Garnet B. Holmes, one of the inventors and the senior partner of the firm, arrived last month in London, from Wellington, to carry on arrangements for the sale of their patent rights in the twenty-three different countries throughout which it is patented. While in America, he conducted numerous trials and was present at the Atlantic City Street Railway Convention where he had the opportunity of meeting every prominent tramway engineer in the United States, with the result that his invention became widely known and highly commended. So much has this been the case that, we are informed, enquiries are flowing in from every quarter asking for supplies. Fig. 2.— Non-Fouling Head Dropped. this inner bracket, and a pin in the lower end engages the lower slot, enabhng it to move up and down within certain limits. The pressure of the pole against the wire keeps the pin in the lower slot, while the spring in the head which tends to raise the pin in the slot, acts as a cushion and makes the upward movement of the wheel very lively, returning it instantaneously to the wire while passing irregularities, thereby preventing it from *' jumping.'' Should it do so by any accident, however, then the spring within the head withdraws the lower pin, and the bracket carrying the foulable part instantane- ously fallsintoanout-of-action position (Fig. 2.) The head then harmlessly passes under any kind of overhead work. Both the severe private and official trials and the actual everyday performance are cited as proofs of the efficacy of the device. Next taking the flexible under-running head (Fig. 3), engineers who are in favour of centre-running heads said that they liked the cushioning and swivelling action of the swivel head. Thisaction has been applied to the ordinary harp and wheel by simply mounting the spindle on two blocks (in slots inclined downwards a few degrees) with buffer springs behind which normally tend to retain the blocks at the top of the slots, but which are compressed by the pole tension. When these springs are compressed the pressure is distributed equally on both, but should the wire be irregular, and tend to bmd on either side of the wheel, the spring on the off side pushes the spindle forward and maintains the wheel in a straight line with the wire; in other words the wheel is said to be floating, or to have the same action as the radial truck. This allows of a reduction in the trolley pole tension, and with the swivelling action a saving put at ^20 per car per year is easily effected, as the wear and tear of trolley wire, corrugation at ears, and frequent jumping of the trolley, are reduced to a minimum.

We are indebted to Mr. Wilson Worsdell, chief mechanical engineer of the North Eastern Railway, for the following description and illustrations of a dyna- mometer car which he has designed for testing loco- motives and rolling stock, with a view to obtaining data which would enable the company to meet the growing demands for greater speed and haulage, and generally to make for increased efficiency. The body is built on a steel underfranie, shaped to take a special spring which extends right across the middle of the carriage. This spring consists of thirty selected steel plates, each separated by rollers, so that there is a minimum of friction. The end of the spring adjacent to the drawbar is provided with rollers at each end of the span abutting against The paper is caused to travel over a table by drums driven by a measuring-wheel, which rolls on the rail, and which can be raised or lowered from within the car at will. This measuring-wheel is fitted with a very hard steel tyre to minimise wear, and accurately ground so that it makes a predetermined number of revolutions per mile. The paper can be made to run at varying speeds by changing the driving gear between the measuring- wheel and the drums. The speed of the train at any instant is shown in front of the operator by a pointer on a dial. The permanent speed record is given by a pen in electrical communication with a clock, which thus makes a mark on the travelling roll of paper at two- second intervals. The speed can be read off from this by the aid of a special scale. There are eight of these electro-magnetic pens, which may be coupled up as required through a terminal board, and thus may be view of Instrument Table In Dynamometer Car. fixed faces, and from these the pull is transmitted to the train. As the function of this spring is to give an accurate measurement of the pull exerted on the drawbar, it was essential that the plates composing it should be of the highest quality, and that when buckled together they should be very carefully cali- brated. Each plate was tested separately by being placed over supports and loaded until the specified deflection was reached, after which it was allowed to return to a horizontal position by unloading, or, failing in this, was rejected. A uniform rate of deflection was also required. After being put together the spring was carefully calibrated. A bracket which is fixed to the buckle projects inside the car, and as the spring is deflected the bracket moves a stylographic pen over a roll of paper, thus drawing a curve of drawbar pull. put in communication with any instrument. By the aid of connections at each end of the car external communication can also be made. The interior view, looking upon the instrument table, shows the electro-magnetic pens, and underneath the table may be seen the bracket extending from the spring buckle to the spindle on which the drawbar pen is fixed. On the front of the case on the far side of the instru- ment table are four dials which show the distance travelled, and above them, looking from left to right, can be seen the clock, boiler pressure recorder, and a meter for registering the work done. The apparatus at the right side of the instrument table measures the work done, and is on the same principle as a planimeter. The horizontal circular plate moves a proportional distance to that of the Digitized by Google January 2, 1908.] THE TRAMWAY AND RAILWAY WORLD. 17 train, whilst a frame supporting a small wheel on edge moves across it from the centre, a distance proportional to the pull on the drawbar. Its revolutions are there- fore a measure of the work done, and as it is in electrical communication with the previously mentioned meter, the work is recorded. The indicator mounted on the near edge of the table is for recording the pressure in the steam chest. Owing to the fluctuating pressure in a locomotive steam chest Exterior View of Dynamometer Car. it was thought that the inertia of the long column of water in the connecting pipe would make the results worthless. Two indicators were therefore bracketed together with the pencils close to each other, and in the same horizontal line, so that they both marked on one common drum. One indicator was coupled direct to Interior View from Front End. m the steam chest through a connection under 3 in length, whilst between the other indicator and steam chest, 60 ft. of bare copper pipe and an oil cylinder were interposed. It was found that the one in connec- tion with the long pipe drew a line which was a mean of the pressure shown by the other, and this being suitable the apparatus was then installed as shown in the photograph. The instrument behind the clock is for obtaining the velocity of the wind, which blows down a tube kept facing its direction, and causes the rise and fall of a pen on the paper drum. The view in the smaller photo, shows this more distinctly, whilst up in the roof a dial can be seen on which the direction of the wind is indicated. Two dials on which the drawbar pull and speed are shown are provided for the convenience of those persons who may be in the front end. Other auxiliary apparatus, such as pyrometers, draught gauges, etc., are inchided in the equipment, and indicators of a special type, with external springs and pencils controlled by electro-magnets, are employed on the front. The external view shows the measuring-wheel pre- viously mentioned. The wind vane, flexible pipes for boiler and steam chest pressures, and the plugs for external electrical connections may be seen at the front end. The spring can be seen, as the side protec- tion plates have been taken oflf for the purpose of this photograph. For brake tests a frame supporting three indicators can be fixed on the existing instrument table, and the pressures in the brake cylinder, auxiliary reservoir, and train pipe may thus be recorded. During locomotive experiments there will be recorded on the travelling roll of paper, the drawbar pull, workgiven out, speed, revolutions of driving wheels, steam chest pressure, and position of reversing lever. The effect that alteration in design has on any of these observationscanreadilybeseen,and comparing the fuel and water consumption with the work given out, the total efficiency "
