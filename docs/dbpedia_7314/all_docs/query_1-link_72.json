I guess Nissan is existing, a good move.\n\nNow Renault should focus and maybe market the new Pajero.\n\nTeam-BHP Support\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2010\n\nLocation: All over!\n\nPosts: 7,830\n\nThanked: 19,465 Times\n\nRe: Renault Nissan plant in Chennai offering VRS (Voluntary Retirement) to employees; going the GM w\n\nWe casually talk about how Renault-Nissan should just quit India given their half-hearted efforts in our market. But it is when things come down to such announcements that you realize the magnitude of the decision. Feel sorry for the employees, this development will create tremendous uncertainty in the company.\n\nAlso, \"Early Bird Offer\"?! How horribly condescending is that.

Let's not jump to conclusions. Tata has too offered VRS to its employees in the recent past.\n\nThe Renault group has good cumulative sales in India. That said, in my personal opinion, they should just let Nissan retire. It's a damaged brand. I believe the upcoming Kicks is their last & final shot at the market. If the Kicks doesn't click, Japanese bosses will be looking at tough options for Nissan India.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2009\n\nLocation: WB 26\n\nPosts: 3,406\n\nThanked: 2,920 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan plant in Chennai offering VRS (Voluntary Retirement) to employees\n\nCars sold by the alliance in August 2018:\n\nRenault: 6557\n\nNissan: 530\n\nDatsun: 2578\n\nMitsubishi: 0\n\nTotal : 9665\n\nMarket share: 3.4% (7th position)\n\nIMO they should snip all redundant and overlapping models and retain the following in their portfolio:\n\nDatsun: RediGo (aim this at the budget / value market)\n\nRenault: Duster (updated), Kwid (upgrade and position this as a step up from RediGo), a supermini, a capable sedan (Keep Renault as the main brand with consistent sellers)\n\nNissan: Fold the brand (No use keeping a overlapping portfolio, maybe have the GTR as an option to be imported as a CBU)\n\nMitsubishi: a big SUV, maybe the new Pajero at competitive prices?\n\nAlso, all of these models should be sold under one roof from a multibrand dealership so that the buyer has choices once he walks in.\n\nLast edited by blackasta : 11th September 2018 at 10:37.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2006\n\nLocation: Mumbai - The city of Sea Link!!!\n\nPosts: 2,929\n\nThanked: 938 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan plant in Chennai offering VRS (Voluntary Retirement) to employees\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by GTO\n\nThe Renault group has good cumulative sales in India.

They should learn a thing or two from Fiat. The parent company is not doing great in Indian market but Jeep clicked.\n\nMy view, speed up the process of Mitusbishi in India and start with a bang. Xpander, Eclipse, Delica, Lancer are good brands to come to India. For that matter, even Mirage or EK Wagon should do decent numbers.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2008\n\nLocation: Evanston\n\nPosts: 1,748\n\nThanked: 736 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan plant in Chennai offering VRS (Voluntary Retirement) to employees\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by GTO\n\nThe Renault group has good cumulative sales in India.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by blackasta\n\nCars sold by the alliance in August 2018:\n\nRenault: 6557\n\nNissan: 530\n\nDatsun: 2578\n\nMitsubishi: 0\n\nTotal : 9665\n\nMarket share: 3.4% (7th position)\n\nAgree with both your comments, however, they are a little too dependent on the Kwid (5541 units in Aug '18), and that is a tricky position to be in. The Kwid's volumes are at about 50% of what they were closer to its launch. For me, there are also unanswered questions (referring to the earlier crash test debacle) about what measures Renault will take to make the Kwid compliant with Bharat Stage VI safety norms, and what effect that would have on its pricing.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by amtak\n\n.
