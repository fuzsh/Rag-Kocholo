It only means party A filed a case for a disagreement. Let the facts come out.\n\nFirst how many workers indeed did fall ill or sadly died? Were the right protocols issued? were reasonable efforts made to implement them ? Did the workers follow them or was our classic chalta hai attitude at play here. All these need to be studied before passing judgement. Maybe Renault-Nissan's management is more at fault. Maybe the unions and worker indiscipline is more to blame. Right now all bets are up in the air.\n\nFurther is the union using this to settle scores with the management on past disagreements where the union could not have its way?\n\nIn dealing with unions off and on since the early 1980s the only thing I can be sure of is that in any union-management disagreement/court case there are at least a dozen wheels within wheels within wheels.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2006\n\nLocation: Chennai\n\nPosts: 439\n\nThanked: 987 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan dragged to court by its employees, over Covid-19 protocols\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by yd_gli\n\nWho is responsible for following the safety protocols that have been issued?

Anything that happens inside the place of work is the responsibility of the Employer IMHO. If the employees don't follow rules, then the Employer is entitled to actions like terminating the services of such employees. In this case, Renault-Nissan seems to have not taken any action against employees. I don't understand how this can cause unease to corporates. Our is a democracy and employees are just exercising their democratic right.\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2006\n\nLocation: bangalore\n\nPosts: 850\n\nThanked: 2,591 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan dragged to court by its employees, over Covid-19 protocols\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by lsjey\n\nI If the employees don't follow rules, then the Employer is entitled to actions like terminating the services of such employees.

It looks very doubtfull that the management did \"not\" want the employees to follow social distancing norms. Also, if you know how manufacturing works, its not as simple terminating someone because they did not follow social distancing. Any HR from manufacturing can chip in here. You can start with checking why is that 50% of the employees are kept as contractors/interns and not part of the unions.\n\nAlso how can the company take liability if anyone in the family is infected? What if the person was infected from a different source?\n\nNo doubt, the company can increase the medical coverage or provde additional OT to entice the employees to be available in these hard times. But I doubt they forced people to work violating the covid norms.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2017\n\nLocation: Pune\n\nPosts: 6,638\n\nThanked: 58,396 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan dragged to court by its employees, over Covid-19 protocols\n\nRenault-Nissan India workers to go on strike on May 26\n\nAccording to a media report, workers at the Renault-Nissan plant in Tamil Nadu have called for a strike on May 26, 2021. The workers claim that their Covid-related safety demands have not been met by the company.\n\nThe news comes just hours after a petition was filed in court to halt operations alleging that Covid-19 protocols were being flouted and that the health policies offered by the company were insufficient.\n\nThe Madras High Court will be hearing the case after the state government has filed its response. Renault-Nissan did not comment on the issue as the matter is subjudice.\n\nSource: ET Auto\n\nBHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jul 2014\n\nLocation: Hyd\n\nPosts: 104\n\nThanked: 222 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan dragged to court by its employees, over Covid-19 protocols\n\nOwing to my little knowledge of Tamilnadu politics, which I closely monitored during my stay in TN - I strongly guess this is a political hit job. It is a known fact that these so called employee unions are 'completely' aligned to the two dominant political parties in the state. Now that there is a change of power in the new state, it is essential for the party in power to have 'their' union playing the key role in these companies. It is at these times that they tend to resort to these kind of petty pressure tactics, so that they can take over the control of unions. Also, it would be ridiculous to think that Big-Corporations Like Renault-Nissan, Hyundai would penny pinch on COVID related safety that too when the pandemic is in its heights(?).\n\nMaybe I'm wrong? and really these companies aren't maintaining COVID Safety guidelines? Only time will tell.\n\nSenior - BHPian\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2015\n\nLocation: Chicagoland\n\nPosts: 2,989\n\nThanked: 6,880 Times\n\nRe: Renault-Nissan dragged to court by its employees, over Covid-19 protocols\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by G V Krishna\n\nAlso, it would be ridiculous to think that Big-Corporations Like Renault-Nissan, Hyundai would penny pinch on COVID related safety that too when the pandemic is in its heights(?)\n\nI wouldn’t lift the blame from corporations just like that. Didn’t VW knowingly cheat on diesel emissions despite the fact that governments were becoming more aware of the effects of diesel pollution?\n\nSomething tells me there’s more than what meets the eye. Renault Nissan are having a terrible time over the last few years. The rotten culture starts from the top and flows down the food pyramid.\n\nEither this is a move by politicians/rival auto makers/local lobbyists etc or Renault-Nissan is clearly cutting corners where they shouldn’t be.\n\nLast edited by landcruiser123 : 25th May 2021 at 03:43."
