        "text": "Thank you for your interest in joining our Renault Winery Resort team. Please find all current openings & application forms for our team below. Our team will review all submissions and be in touch with candidates. Please, no phone calls.\n\nMany refer to our industry culture as “The Hotel Business” or the “Hotel Industry.” At VIVÂMEE, we reject that limiting property-centric presupposition. We choose to be leaders in the Hospitality Industry.\n\nOur culture is not just operating hotels; its purpose is to deliver authentic hospitality which is an intimately human service. We believe cherishing the souls of our guests and the team we trust to serve them is the key to achieving authentic hospitality.\n\nVivamee Hospitality & Renault Winery Resort & Golf are actively involved in the community by supporting and sponsoring many community events, volunteering in the community, and making donations to charitable/not-for-profit organizations.\n\nIf you would like for Renault to sponsor an event or fundraiser, please complete this application and return it to the contact listed below.\n\nPlease note that we cannot always meet every request, but will carefully review each one and consider our available resources to meet the needs of the community."
