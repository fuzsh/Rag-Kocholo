RENAULT ATLAS MARCH 2013 06 / 07 THE RENAULT NISSAN ALLIANCE 2012 was an eventful year for the Alliance, with the inauguration of its second plant in Tangier, Morocco, and the launch at its Chennai plant (India) of the Renault Duster, which met with instant success. The Renault-Nissan Alliance acquired a majority stake and created a joint venture governing AVTOVAZ - Russia's leading car marker and manufacturer of the Lada - and announced the production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at the RSM plant in Busan, Korea. Also in 2012, the strategic partnership with Daimler became tangible with the launch of the first products resulting from the cooperation. STRUCTURE Created in 1999, the Renault-Nissan Alliance is now the longest-standing transnational partnership between two leading manufacturers in the automotive industry. This unique partnership is a flexible and pragmatic model which can be expanded to cover new projects and new partners on a global scale. Founded on the principle of cross-shareholding and common interests, the Alliance optimises synergies without degrading the two partners' brand identities.\n\n6. THE RENAULT-NISSAN ALLIANCE RENAULT ATLAS MARCH 2013 A DEDICATED TEAM TO ACCELERATE SYNERGIES 8/9 THE ALLIANCE IN 2012 In May 2009, in the midst of the global financial crisis, the Renault-Nissan Alliance created a team of Alliance directors tasked with accelerating synergy processes and sharing best practices. Their role is to strengthen and expand cooperation in order to enhance each partner's performance. The team, made of 14 members within the Renault-Nissan BV structure, reports directly to Carlos Ghosn. All decisions are still taken by the Alliance Board, composed from members of the executive teams of Renault and Nissan. In early 2012, the Alliance announced that it had sold more than 8 million vehicles in 2011, through the Renault, Dacia, Renault Samsung Motors, Nissan, Infiniti and Lada brands. In 2012, sales increased again, up to 8.1 million vehicles. The rest of the year saw a number of projects take shape, particularly abroad with the inauguration of the Alliance's second plant in Tangier, Morocco, which produces Dacia Lodgy and Dokker. A second assembly line was opened at the Chennai plant in India, which also saw the launch of the fifth Renault vehicle in two years, the Duster, whose instant success helped Renault become the 8th largest brand on the Indian market in the space of just a few months. In Russia, Renault, Nissan and Avtovaz launched the 'B0' line in Togliatti - the first assembly line capable of producing five models of three brands for the Alliance. As the year drew to a close, the Renault-Nissan Alliance acquired a majority stake in Alliance Rostec Auto BV, a joint venture created with Russian Technologies, which will own 74.5% of Avtovaz in 2014. In Korea, Renault, Nissan and Renault Samsung Motors announced the production of the Nissan Rogue crossover at the Busan plant. STRENGTHENED SYNERGIES 2009 to 2012 evolution of synergies for Renault and Nissan 2009 to 2012 evolution of synergies by type of synergy In 2012, the Alliance won its first fleet contract to supply at least 15,000 vehicles to the global food company Danone. € million € million Finally, the cooperation with Daimler moved up a gear with the launch of production in Maubeuge of the Citan, Mercedes' new light commercial vehicle. The Renault Valladolid Motores plant in Spain, also began production of the diesel engine that has equipped the Class A Mercedes since its launch. Finally, a new engine developed jointly with Daimler was announced at the Paris Motor Show by Carlos Ghosn and Dieter Zetsche. 1,513 770 743 1,632 836 796 1,746 1,513 874 1,174 1,632 1,187 1,746 1,270 ALLIANCE SALES 872 339 2009 Renault 2010 Nissan 2011 445 476 2009 2010 2011 Product Non Product The Alliance gives Renault and Nissan a sustainable competitive edge in the worldwide competition of the automotive industry. Since 2009, the company has systematically ramped up its efforts to develop synergies. The Alliance team is responsible for ensuring that all opportunities are explored. Synergies are monitored by the leaders of cross-company teams (CCTs) and approved by the Alliance economic advisor and by the control functions. Only new synergies are taken into account and can originate in both cost reductions and avoided expenses. Increases in turnover, internal trade and sales financing are not counted as synergies. Synergies worth more than 1.7 billion were delivered in 2011, with another 2 billions expected for 2012. For the fourth year running, the Renault-Nissan Alliance broke its sales record with 8.1 million vehicles sold in 2012, an increase of 0.9% in 2011. Renault and Nissan sold 3.1 million (-6.2%) and 4.9 million (+5.8%) vehicles respectively in 2012. Lada sales amounted to 0.61 million vehicles (-5.5%).

THE RENAULT GROUP RENAULT ATLAS MARCH 2013 RENAULT SPORT F1 26 / 27 with Williams in 1996 and 1997 brought the score up to six consecutive titles. After a brief hiatus, Renault returned to the racetrack with the Renault F1 Team to win the 2005 and 2006 titles. The latest period of its racing history, in partnership with Red Bull Racing, has added three other constructor championship wins to its record. …AND OF POWERTRAIN PERFORMANCES For thirty years, most F1 world champions-including Mansell, Hill, Senna, Prost, Schumacher, Alonso, and Vettel-have been propelled to victory by a Renault engine. Repeated wins over the seasons point to the performance, energy efficiency, and reliability of Renault engines and bear witness to its expertise as an engine supplier: Performance: Renault engines stand out for their traction and adaptability to different chassis. In 2012, one out of three single-seaters were powered by the RS27. I Efficiency: optimal fuel consumption is a strength of Renault engines, which make the most efficient use possible of each drop of fuel to allow for single-seaters that are lighter and, consequently, faster on the track. I Reliability/sturdiness: Constant refinement of Renault engine mechanics has meant reliable performance over the company's thirty-five racing seasons. Today more than ever, Renault sees F1 racing as a laboratory for new technology and a showcase for the excellence of Renault engines quality and sturdiness. I ELEVEN CONSTRUCTOR TITLES IN THIRTY-FIVE YEARS: AN OUTSTANDING RECORD Renault Sport F1: a dream-team that supply 4 partners Renault Sport F1 plays several roles: it supplies engines, provides technology, and creates B2B partnerships. Renault is a volume manufacturer recognized as an expert engine: it is the only one to repeatedly outperform the best specialists on the track. Four F1 teams, it means one for three, trust Renault engine and are supplied with V8 Renault R.S. 27. PARTNER TEAMS Red Bull Racing Renault / Pilotes : Sebastian Vettel, Mark Webber Lotus F1 Team / Pilotes : Kimi Räikkönen, Romain Grosjean Williams F1 Team / Pilotes : Pastor Maldonado, Valtteri Bottas Caterham F1 Team / Pilotes : Charles Pic, Guido Van der Garde 2012, another season of victory for Renault engines: Red Bull Racing and Sébastien Vettel are propelled to the constructor/driver title by the Renault RS27 engine for the third time in a row. This title is the 11th obtained by Renault* in this sport, joined to 10 driver titles in thirty-five years, 151 victories, and 202 pole positions. *As an F1 team or an engine supplier 35 YEARS OF RACING/COMPETITION… 2013-2014 OUTLOOK After thirty-five years and eleven world constructor championship wins*, Renault's record is outstanding for a volume manufacturer and rivals those of the greatest Formula One specialists. This year will mark the last spin around the tracks for the Renault RS27 V8 engine, while awaiting new regulations and the arrival of the electrified Power unit for the 2014 season which is to offer the same performance while reducing consumption by 40%. By making energy efficiency and management crucial factors, F1 vehicle design comes one step closer to that of production vehicles: a good opportunity for Renault engines' experts to prove once more their know-how on road and tracks. After teaming up with Williams in the late 80s, Renault won its first championship in 1992. This victory was followed by others in 1993 and 1994. In 1995, Renault joined forces with Benetton and took home another international trophy. Two additional championship wins\n\n16.

RENAULT ATLAS MARCH 2013 34 / 35 DESIGN, PRODUCTION AND SALES Since it was founded in 1898, Renault has always been a pioneering, innovative and people-centered company, designing and producing vehicles that are ahead of their time. Renault continues to respect its founding principles today by proposing ingenious vehicles that are easy to use and limit CO2 emissions, while accessible to everyone.\n\n20. DESIGN, PRODUCTION AND SALES RENAULT ATLAS MARCH 2013 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Renault Research and Development is a source of innovation which encourages competitivity within the company. With an investment of more than 1,570 billions euros Renault shows its commitment both to meeting the challenges of the automotive industry and moving closer to key technological and societal tendencies.

Depending on the choice of the customer, the vehicle is either electric-powered (with two electric motors near the rear wheels) or a all-wheel drive hybrid powered (internal combustion engine for the front wheels, plus electric rear wheel drive). This cooperative project, developed with Michelin who is pilote and the Institut français du pétrole, concerns the concept of a dual mode utility van.

INTERNATIONAL EXPERTISE Renault engineering owns several decentralised units, located as close as possible to the company's target markets. Their task is to adapt products on a local level to suit the needs and expectations of new clients, and to respect the regulatory and economic requirements of different countries. Engineering Staff 2012 Corporate engineering Renault Technology Romania/RTR (Romania, Turkey, Russia, Slovenia, Iran) Renault Technology Korea/RTK (Korea) Renault Technology Spain/RTS (Spain, Morocco, Portugal) Renault Technology Americas/RTA (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico) 10,009 3,000 1,087 886 844 6 PRIORITY THEMES FOR RENAULT Renault R&D projects are grouped together around six priority themes, illustrated below with several examples: innovative architecture, electric-powered vehicles and ecosystem, combustion-powered vehicles/eco2, on-board comfort and reassurance, new services and affordable costs. INNOVATIVE ARCHITECTURE Renault has left its mark in automotive history in terms of innovative architecture: R16, Espace, Scénic, Twizy. As a continuation of this history, projects which will not necessarily be as visible, are nonetheless just as important. Example: the Cineli project (Inductive load for electric-powered vehicles) to recharge these cars using electrical induction. The aim of the project is to develop a method for recharging cars without using a cable link, while ensuring compatibility between the different manufacturers. This project, coordinated by Renault, is being developed along with French partners, thus ensuring the operability of the solution chosen. Partners and financing of the Cineli project: Schneider Electric, Newtech Concept, LGEP, Renault, Oséo, the Ile-de-France region and the Ile-de-France Regional Counsel. COMBUSTION-POWERED VEHICLES Developments in the car industry are guided by the accompanying problems of sustainable mobility, in particular global warming and local pollution. The majority of countries have adopted regulations, with the aim of controlling CO2 levels, and set maximum thresholds for authorised pollutants. Given that the Group's growth depends on the conquest of market shares on an international level, another major issue is that of adapting powertrains (P/T) to the different constraints of fuel composition, climate and road conditions on these markets. This context guides technological developments for all of the components and the architecture of powertrains, for example: optimisation of downsizing, supercharging and combustion settings; reduction of weight and friction or the deployment of the dual-clutch transmission offer. As well as these optimisation means, R&D explores the adaptation of motors and transmissions to electrification and also works on developing affordable hybridisation solutions.\n\n21. DESIGN, PRODUCTION AND SALES RENAULT ATLAS MARCH 2013 Illustration: the new 3-cylinder turbo petrol Energy TCe 90 motor. With a maximum torque of 135 Nm and 90 ch, it offers the best driving pleasure/practicality ratio on the market thanks to a package of efficient technologies (downsizing, supercharging, reduction of friction, optimal inner architecture, oil pump with a variable cubic capacity, stop & start etc.). This series of technology has led to a breakthrough in fuel consumption, with a reduction of more than 20% on an NEDC cycle compared to the Clio 3 TCe 100 and CO2 emissions of less than 100g/km. Services are being developing to provide drivers and passengers with real-time information, and to ensure continuity in use between the different worlds they are evolving in, while at the same time respecting safety conditions. Example: the SAMI project (System for the development of mobility infrastructure and transportation intermodality) is developed around three themes: I the modelling of urban and peri-urban mobility; I the simulation of the introduction of new forms of transport and their impact; I the integration of recharging zones for electric vehicles and their stations in suitable locations (including simulation of use rates depending on time periods). Renault assistance ON-BOARD COMFORT AND REASSURANCE Renault projects in this area are focussed on several types of breakthroughs: technological, usage and economic models to make new comfort and well-being services available to all. Example: the IHM Vision project is an example which illustrates these 3 dimensions. The aim is to significantly reduce the cognitive load linked to the numerous sources of on-board information (live services, Advanced Driver Assistance systems, communication, Infotainment, etc.) by introducing new, simpler and more intuitive methods for human-machine interactions, and by associating wireless connectivity and new mobility services. 38 / 39 Misc. apps (weather, Coyote, R-Link Tweet, etc.) Battery charge management Cockpit preheating TomTom Live (HD traffic, Google local search, etc.) Embedded R-Link apps (navigation, eco-coaching, etc.) R-Link connectivity NEW SERVICES The implementation of new services is a response both to: the social evolution which favours or develops new lifestyles: increased collaboration and interaction, networks and communities, need for continuity of connections etc.; I the technological evolution, in particular regarding electronics and its scope. The world is becoming digital, connected and interconnected, and cars will not be able to escape this evolution. I By integrating and processing data from numerous sources (statistics for urban areas, mobile phone positions, localisation and train and bus timetables etc.), we aim in particular to be able to offer users optimal multi-mode journeys. AT AFFORDABLE COST Mobility for all is achieved by the deployment of a range of modules, components or systems, while also relying on simplification and standardisation. Example: the project of individual seating at affordable cost concerns an innovative technology for manufacturing seat covers (in foam); this allows for the shape of the seat to be changed by modifying only the cover, not the structure or the main foam component. This technology, which is much less costly than current technology, allows for greater diversity in interior design, even creating the possibility for a client to personalise their seat. This innovation is currently being developed for the Brazilian market.\n\n22.
