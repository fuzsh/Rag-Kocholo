        "text": "Many economists have considered eco-taxation as a possible solution to many environmental problems. Sweden&#39;s Carbon Tax is the first example of such taxation scheme in actual use. The Ukraine introduced an Environmental Tax Reform in 2011. This paper presents an analysis of tendencies in the environmental policy and taxation in the European countries. Particular attention is paid to Sweden - the first and Ukraine - the last of the countries, which introduced the Environmental Taxes. Keywords: Environmental Tax, Carbon Tax, Environmental Tax Reform. Introduction. The deficit of natural resources will certainly become one of the signs of the 21st century. At the beginning of 20th century scientists noticed the change of quality of environment in large industrial cities (15). Currently, Greenhouse Gas Emissions are the main reason of the global warming threat. The introduction of Environmental Taxes Reform can become a powerful instrument in solving many ecological problems. Theref...\n\nThe urbanizing world, where human labour has been replaced by the mechanized machinery, is becoming increasingly dependent on the resources provided by nature. The demand of humanity in natural resources continues to grow. Due to the limitedness of the goods provided by nature, a human must take a more responsible approach towards the available resources by using the resources that are renewed more often and by protecting nonrenewable resources. Sustainable development is the field that analyses these paradigms. Social, economic, and environmental dimensions combined and the emphasis on one of the fiscal instruments for the purposes of sustainability bring forward the concept of environmental taxes. Environmental taxes may be interpreted as a fiscal instrument that transfers the tax burden from the “goods” onto the “bads”. Income generated by these taxes is distributed for stimulation of the sustainable economy based on conservation of the nature and more environmentally friendly production. The taxes considered may not only allow reducing the pollution and stimulating sustainable development of the national economy, but also influence the changes of the national tax structure. This article analyses the concepts of sustainable development, environmental taxes, and environmental tax reform. The development of environmental taxes, energy, transport, resources, and pollution in the selected EU countries is analysed. The analysis has shown that environmental taxes are sometimes allocated between the countries irrespective of whether a country has already implemented the environmental tax reform or not. In any case, each country should put own effort into environmental issues and seek sustainability.\n\nThere is growing use of environmental taxes in Europe and a new momentum behind the environmental tax reform (ETR) agenda. When carefully designed such instruments can support economic (e.g. government revenues, innovation, employment), social (e.g. health, income distribution) and environmental (e.g. efficient resource use, energy security) objectives. How these instruments are designed influences their effectiveness and overall impact, which to date has been relatively small, leading to marginal changes in the tax system and incentives in the economy as a whole. There remains scope for the wider application and more effective use of such instruments, however progress is often held back by various obstacles including concerns over competitiveness impacts, public resistance to new taxes and the political costs of action. In some cases, a country’s efforts on environmental taxation have been hindered or complicated by a lack of action in others. Against this backdrop, the Ministry of...\n\nEnvironmental taxation has become as a key element of green economy and sustainable growth. The relevance of taxation in this field is based on the effectiveness of eco-taxes to control the environmental cost. Nevertheless, the use of environmental taxation is not free from criticisms due to the fact that a tax is addressed to fund public expenditures. In this paper, the author tackles the mismatches found in the concept of environmental taxes. With the purpose to turn into a Sustainable and Green European Economy, environmental taxes could promote the reduction of pollution or avoid the most dangerous activities for the environment.\n\nBefore the early negative effects of human activity on the environment and nature became apparent, there was no particular concern. The consequences of exponential population growth over the years brought a negative impact, increasing the risk and concern for the future. In recent decades, there has been an admittedly large, joint, and ambitious effort at the international and European levels to promote and implement the values and rules of green development and growth. Green growth is crucial regarding the policy implemented by the European Union (EU). Therefore, it calls on all its member states to participate in this effort concerning the environment and natural resources, having as its main tool environmental taxation. This paper primarily aims in proving that environmental taxation facilitates, through the proper implementation of European Union rules, the achievement of green growth. The research methodology followed, was the study of the environmental indexes of the European ...\n\nSince the Kyoto Protocol entered into force in February 2005, many Parties to the Protocol have shifted their domestic policies into high gear to achieve the quantitative reductions in greenhouse gas emissions undertaken for the period from 2008 to 2012. While the basic design of environmental taxation in European countries has received widespread attention, its actual performance has not been systematically assessed. This report aims at examining, against pre-determined criteria (e.g. impact on costs and prices, competition and trade, environmental impacts and recycling mechanisms), how effectively environmental taxation systems are functioning. Most importantly, the report analyses the political dynamics behind these systems and how they have changed the ‘optimal’ tax design into a ‘politically feasible’ tax design.\n\nThe research presents the analysis and comparison of environmental tax reforms in the countries of the European Union, which are an effect of political decisions. The main focus in evaluation of environmental tax reforms is put on the results of improvement of environmental quality and maintenance of revenue neutrality that may be used to determine the appropriateness and benefit of the reform in the countries. The following countries which have implemented the environmental tax reforms have been chosen for the empirical study: Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Criteria of evaluation of environmental tax reforms have been determined, namely, the effect of environmental taxes on state revenue; economic-social effects of environmental taxes; the effect of environmental taxes on reduction of environmental pollution. The empirical quantitative and qualitative study has been conducted for analysis of the dynamics of the quantitative indicators by..."
