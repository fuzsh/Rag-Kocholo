Albert told him that he didn’t know and he must have forgotten. This irritated the teacher. He asked Albert, why? Albert replied that he didn’t see a point in learning dates. One could learn about them from books. Ideas are more important than facts and figures. The teacher attributed to Albert that he didn’t believe in education. He talked in a sarcastic manner. Albert told him that education should be about ideas and not facts. The teacher said that Albert was a disgrace to be there Albert felt miserable when he left the school that afternoon. He didn’t like this school. He would have to come to it again. He lived in a small room. It was one of the poorest quarters of Munich. The landlady beat her children regularly. Her husband came every Saturday and drank in the evening. He then beat her. He didn’t like the children’s crying every time. He told these things to Yuri. He hated the atmosphere of slum violence. Next time his cousin [elsa] came to Munich. She told Albert that if he tried he could pass the examination. There were more stupid boys than him. Moreover, passing the examination was not difficult. It was simply just to be able to repeat in the examination that Elsa that he was not good at learning things by heart. He liked music as it gave him comfort. Albert didn’t like to remain in school. He met Yuri after six months. He had an idea. He told Yuri that if he had a medical certificate that he suffered from a nervous breakdown, he could get rid of school. He asked Yuri if he had a doctor friend. Yuri told him that he had in Dr. Ernest Weil. However, Yuri told him not to deceive him. He must be frank with him. When Albert visited Dr. Ernest Weil he had really come near a nervous breakdown. Dr. Ernest issued him the certificate. His fees were that he should serve Yuri with a meal. Albert told Dr. Ernest about his future plans. He would go to Milan. He hoped to get admission into an Italian college or institute. It was possible from the comments of the Mathematics teacher, Mr. Koch. Yuri told him to get a reference in writing from the Mathematics teacher before going to the head teacher. Mr. Koch, the mathematics teacher encouraged him.\n\nTypes of Weaving loom machine & it's technology\n\nTypes of Weaving loom machine & it's technologyldtexsolbl\n\nWelcome to the presentation on the types of weaving loom machines, brought to you by LD Texsol, a leading manufacturer of electronic Jacquard machines. Weaving looms are pivotal in textile production, enabling the interlacing of warp and weft threads to create diverse fabrics. Our exploration begins with traditional handlooms, which have been in use since ancient times, preserving artisanal craftsmanship. We then move to frame and pit looms, simple yet effective tools for small-scale and traditional weaving. Advancing to modern industrial applications, we discuss power looms, the backbone of high-speed textile manufacturing. These looms, integral to LD Texsol's product range, offer unmatched productivity and consistent quality, essential for large-scale apparel, home textiles, and technical fabrics. Rapier looms, another modern marvel, use rapier rods for versatile and rapid weaving of complex patterns. Next, we explore air and water jet looms, known for their efficiency in lightweight fabric production. LD Texsol's state-of-the-art electronic Jacquard machines exemplify technological advancements, enabling intricate designs and patterns with precision control. Lastly, we examine dobby looms, ideal for medium-complexity patterns and versatile fabric production. This presentation will deepen your understanding of weaving looms, their applications, and the innovations LD Texsol brings to the textile industry. Join us as we weave through the history, technology, and future of textile production. Visit our website www.ldtexsol.com for more information."
