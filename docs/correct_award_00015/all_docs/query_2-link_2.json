        "text": "Wilhelm Wien (born January 13, 1864, Gaffken, Prussia [now Parusnoye, Russia]—died August 30, 1928, Munich, Germany) was a German physicist who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1911 for his displacement law concerning the radiation emitted by the perfectly efficient blackbody (a surface that absorbs all radiant energy falling on it).\n\nWien obtained his doctorate at the University of Berlin in 1886 and soon began to work on the problem of radiation. Although the radiation emitted from a blackbody is distributed over a wide range of wavelengths, there is an intermediate wavelength at which the radiation reaches a maximum. In 1893 Wien stated in his law that this maximum wavelength is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of the body. Because the accuracy of Wien’s law declined for longer wavelengths, Max Planck was led to further investigations culminating in his quantum theory of radiation.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFaces of Science"
