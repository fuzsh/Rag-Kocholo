        "text": "Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said on Monday that the night of Iran's response to the targeting of the consulate in Damascus was a \"strategic farce\" for the occupation entity.\n\nThe daily spoke of a \"strategic failure\" suffered by \"Israel,\" noting that \"Israel was enslaved for two weeks, in the midst of tension that paralyzed it, after it carried out the assassination\" of the senior IRGC advisors in the Iranian consulate in Syria two weeks ago.\n\nRead more: US pressures Israeli war cabinet to postpone any attack on Iran\n\n\"Why was an assassination carried out that could lead to a confrontation much more complex than it currently is in the North and South, while the story there is also far from over?\" it questioned.\n\nTaking aim at Prime Minister Netanyahu, his government, in addition to military and security top officials, the outlet mockingly asked, \"How are leaders, who have previously approved several times plans for invading Rafah, which has not happened yet, supposed to threaten Tehran?\"\n\nIn the face of this, the outlet found that the response for this failure would be \"another classic Israeli answer,\" which is, \"wrong, we were wrong, we made a mistake.\"\n\nLikewise, it pointed out that intelligence estimates indicated that Iran \"will not change its way of operating\" if the Israeli army were to assassinate one of its figures in Damascus, on sovereign Iranian soil.\n\nRead more: US, 'Israel' failed to stop Iran from attacking: INSS\n\n'Israel' on verge of seeing ring of fire up close\n\nIsraeli officials \"forgot that Israel is no longer in a position to make threats, that it has a government that lacks confidence, that its army has erred more than once, and does not know how to recover from that.\"\n\nAdditionally, the outlet questioned whether the assassination operation was \"urgent,\" knowing that \"Israel was on the verge of closely examining the ring of fire that surrounded it.\"\n\n\"Once again, it has been proven that Israel does not like to think differently when it comes to dramatic steps made by the enemy.\"\n\nRead more: Iran's ballistic missiles, drones impact Israeli targets (Footage)\n\nIn this context, the newspaper recalled the Seif of Al-Quds battle in 2021, in which \"Israel believed that Hamas would not shell al-Quds and risk a comprehensive battle,\" and kept this line of thinking \"until October 7, when it believed that Hamas was deterred.'\"\n\nMoreover, the assassination of the leaders of the IRGC in the attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus was a misjudgment assuming that Iran is \"hesitant,\" which turned into a \"historic attack\" launched by Tehran, Yedioth Ahronoth concluded."
