        "text": "Israeli media reported the \"resounding\" failure of the Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu since October 7, in terms of its announced objective of eliminating Hamas and retrieving its captives from Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth revealed that even the assassination of the sons and grandchildren of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas' Political Bureau, on April 10 in al-Shati refugee camp, will not change the overall picture, emphasizing that more than six months have passed since October 7 and \"Israel's\" failure is only amplifying.\n\nThe Israeli website added that this time, it is not possible to pin this on the IOF or the Shin Bet, considering that military achievements on the ground cannot be translated into strategic political achievements, which is deemed an essential point due to political considerations originally aimed at preserving the \"integrity of the Israeli government\" more than the \"state of Israel.\"\n\nIt added that the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza did not accomplish anything other than the mass destruction of the Strip, and, from this latter point, the perpetual and systematic failure of the Israeli government starts.\n\nHamas is still present in every area the Israeli occupation forces withdraw from, and they are even \"supervising aid distribution processes, ensuring prices stay the same, and pursuing all suspected traitors accused of collaborating with \"Israel\", and, in some cases, even executing them, Yedioth Ahronoth said.\n\nFutility in achieving objectives\n\nThe Israeli website said that the primary goal of overthrowing Hamas was not achieved in the first place as the Netanyahu-led Israeli government has refused to discuss any realistic alternative to administer Gaza triggered by fear of Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.\n\nIt added that part of this failure is not reaching a captives' exchange deal, highlighting that \"maybe it was possible to reach this deal sooner, but Hamas is adamant about refusing to make concessions, which can also be partially blamed on the political-diplomatic failure of the Israeli government.\n\nNetanyahu has succeeded in bickering with the American administration, triggering a strategic crisis with the occupation's biggest ally, Yedioth Ahronoth said, stressing that Hamas is well aware of the fact that continuing the war without reaching any agreement will only lead to more conflict between Washington and \"Israel\", claiming that this is why Hamas is not only not in a rush to reach a deal but it is also further letting \"Israel\" writhe in front of the American administration.\n\nEven among American Jews and friends of \"Israel\", the occupation has failed, which is also why Netanyahu should immediately resign and leave a window open for restoring \"Israel's\" standing with the US, especially among Jews, the Israeli website said.\n\nIt emphasized that even among Jews who support \"Israel\", there is a growing understanding that Netanyahu is leading \"Israel\" to absolute defeat and not victory, and this defeat will ultimately lead to imposing a ceasefire on \"Israel\" without overthrowing Hamas and without releasing the captives, allowing Hamas to win, it added.\n\n'Israel' murdered three sons of Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh in Gaza City\n\nThree sons of the head of Hamas' Political Bureau, Ismail Haniyeh, were killed in an Israeli strike on a car in the western part of the al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, sources told Al Mayadeen on April 10.\n\nOn the day of Eid al-Fitr, a holiday celebrated by the Muslim community as it marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, the Israeli occupation committed yet another malicious act, killing Hazem, Amir, and Mohammad; the sons of Ismail Haniyeh and several of his grandchildren.\n\nThe children killed in the attack were: Amal, Khaled, Razan, and Mona.\n\nHaniyeh who is currently leading Hamas' Political Bureau from Qatar's capital, Doha, received the news from his assistant with impeccable resilience.\n\nThe Resistance leader was seen on camera during a hospital visit he had planned on Apil 10, to check up on wounded and sick Palestinians that were transferred to a medical center in Doha. Haniyeh wished God's blessing on his three martyred sons and their children, insisting that he would finish his day's program at the hospital."
