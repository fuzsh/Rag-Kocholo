        "text": "Hostages And Missing Families | via Reuters\n\nHamas released two elderly hostages on Monday, bringing the total to four. The Palestinian militant organization announced the release of Nurit Cooper and Yochved Lifshitz, and the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed the news.\n\nTheir transfer follows the Friday release of two American hostages. It's been more than two weeks since Hamas launched its assault on Israel, killing at least 1,400 people and taking more than 200 hostages.\n\nHealth authorities in Gaza said over 5,000 people have been killed since the Oct. 7 start of the war between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel. More than 15,000 have been injured, the authorities said.\n\nCNBC could not independently verify these numbers.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said Monday that its soldiers were conducting a \"variety of training exercises in order to improve the forces' readiness and capabilities for ground operations in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nStill, a full surrender of Hamas and the return of Israeli hostages could end Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\nTwo elderly Israeli hostages arrive in Tel Aviv after their release\n\nPicture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nTwo Israeli women who were kidnapped and subsequently freed by Hamas, landed in Tel Aviv, Israel early Tuesday.\n\nAn Israeli military helicopter carrying Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yocheved Lifshitz, 85, arrived on the rooftop of Ichilov hospital, according to Reuters footage.\n\nOne of them was seen in a wheelchair while the other was carried out on a stretcher.\n\nThe military wing of Hamas said in a statement on Telegram that the women were released for \"compelling humanitarian\" reasons. The Israel Defense Forces has previously said the militant group is \"trying to present itself as a humanitarian organization to the world\" by the release of hostages.\n\nHamas militants massacred 1,400 people, including babies, women and elderly, and kidnapped more than 200 people from Israel in their Oct. 7 rampage. Little is known about their well-being and whereabouts.\n\nThe militants have so far released four hostages.\n\n— Joanna Tan\n\nThird aid convoy enters Gaza, UN warns fuel about to run out\n\nA third convoy of humanitarian aid trucks delivered water, food and medicine to the besieged Gaza Strip on Monday, but the United Nations warned that fuel was not included and reserves will run out within the next two days.\n\nHumanitarian deliveries through the Rafah crossing from Egypt began on Saturday after wrangling over procedures for inspecting the aid and bombardments on the Gaza side of the border had left relief materials stranded in Egypt.\n\n— Reuters\n\nNot the time for a ceasefire in Israel-Hamas conflict, says White House's Kirby\n\nThis is not the time for a ceasefire in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, White House national security spokesman John Kirby told CNN on Monday.\n\n\"We don't believe that this is the time for a ceasefire,\" he said. \"Israel has a right to defend themselves. They still have work to do to go after Hamas leadership.\"\n\n— Reuters\n\nBiden administration concerned over effectiveness of looming Israeli ground invasion: NYT report\n\nEvelyn Hockstein | Reuters\n\nThe Biden administration has conveyed to Israel its concerns regarding a looming ground invasion into Gaza, according to officials who spoke to The New York Times.\n\n\"The officials said, that the Israel Defense Forces do not yet have a clear military pathway to achieve Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's goal of eradicating Hamas. In conversations with Israeli officials since the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, American officials said they have not yet seen an achievable plan of action,\" according to The New York Times report.\n\nRead the full New York Times story.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nIsrael says the two hostages released by Hamas will receive medical treatment and see family shortly\n\nHostages And Missing Families | via Reuters\n\nA spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed that Nurit Cooper, 79, and Yochaved Lifshitz, 85, were released by Hamas after being taken hostage for a little over two weeks.\n\n\"After being handed over to the Israeli Defense Forces, they are making their way at this time to a medical center in Israel that was organized and specially prepared to receive them. Their family members will be waiting for them there,\" Netanyahu's office wrote in a statement.\n\nHostages And Missing Families Forum | via Reuters\n\n\"We thank Egypt for the assistance and the Red Cross for their important role as life savers. The Government of Israel, the IDF and the entire security establishment will continue to operate with the best of their abilities and efforts in order to locate all of the missing and return all of the abductees home,\" the statement added.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nHamas 'abduction manual' shows that hostage-taking was a central aim of attack\n\nKobi Wolf | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces released an \"abduction manual\" belonging to the Hamas militant group that details instructions on how to kidnap civilians.\n\nIt is believed that Hamas is currently holding approximately 200 civilians since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\nRead the full story on NBC News.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nAl Qassam Brigades video shows hostages being released\n\nAl Qassam Brigades\n\nThe Al Qassam Brigades released a video on their Telegram channel showing the two hostages with Hamas fighters apparently filmed before and during their release, NBC News reported.\n\nIn the video, the two hostages, identified as Nurit Cooper and Yocheved Lifshitz, can be seen being handed over to the Red Cross.\n\nThe photo above is a still from the video.\n\n— Riya Bhattacharjee\n\nSenior defense official: the threat of escalating violence is 'significant'\n\nMajid Asgaripour | Wana News Agency | via Reuters\n\nA senior U.S. defense official said the military is monitoring escalating threats of violence, but declined to say whether Iran or other proxy groups plan to intensify attacks on U.S. troops, NBC News reported.\n\n\"We know there is a significant threat of escalation throughout the region,\" including to U.S. troops, the official said. They added that an uptick in violence in the region has \"Iranian fingerprints all over it.\"\n\n\"We see a prospect for much more significant escalation against U.S. forces and personnel in the near term,\" the official said. \"Let's be clear about it, all roads lead back to Iran.\"\n\nU.S. troops were deployed to Syria and Iraq \"for one purpose and one purpose only,\" they added. \"It's to support local partners who are in the lead to achieve the enduring defeat of ISIS.\"\n\n\"What Iran is actually doing is giving space for ISIS to reconstitute and further destabilize the region,\" the official said.\n\n—Chelsey Cox\n\nBiden administration engaged in 'intense diplomacy' for release of hostages, White House says\n\nLeah Millis | Reuters\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that the release of hostages held by Hamas is \"a top priority for the administration.\"\n\n\"What I can tell you is that we are very hard at work trying to get them released, particularly our American citizens that we know are still being held hostage. There are active communications going on, as you and I speak. I want to be careful that I don't get into too much detail or context about them. Lest I say something that makes it harder for us to achieve their release,\" Kirby said in an interview with MSNBC's \"Katy Tur Reports.\"\n\n\"We're mindful, of course, that there are dozens more hostages from other countries, including Israel,\" Kirby added.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\n'We cannot give up on peace,' Biden says\n\nMiriam Alster | Pool | via Reuters\n\nPresident Joe Biden reiterated calls for peace as the war between Israel and Hamas drags into its third week.\n\n\"As hard as it is, we cannot give up on peace. We cannot give up on a two-state solution. Israelis and Palestinians equally deserve to live in safety, dignity, and peace,\" Biden wrote on X.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nA look at the U.S. firepower moved to support tensions in the Middle East\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Pentagon on Monday afternoon laid out the U.S. firepower that has been repositioned in an effort to mitigate the expansion of the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nSecretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered the movement of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group to the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"Our carrier strike groups give us the ability to launch operations independently, anywhere in the world and immediately upon arrival,\" a senior Defense official told reporters on the call.\n\nThe official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules established by the Pentagon, added that the Defense Department has placed additional forces on prepare-to-deploy orders in order to \"increase their readiness and ensure rapid response.\"\n\nThe USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group, the Navy's most powerful military asset, is operating in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Some of Lockheed Martin's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, systems, as well as the Patriot air defense system, will arrive in the U.S. Central Command area of responsibility. Citing security concerns, the Pentagon declined to name the countries to which THAAD and Patriot will be transported.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister to visit UN this week\n\nAnadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen will visit the United Nations on Tuesday as the U.N. Security Council meets to discuss the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"Foreign Minister Cohen will be accompanied by relatives of Israelis kidnapped by Hamas terrorists, with whom he will participate in public events to raise awareness of the hostages' plight and call for their immediate release,\" the Consulate General of Israel in New York wrote in a statement.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nUN Security Council meeting Tuesday to discuss Gaza's security situation\n\nView Press | Corbis News | Getty Images\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will meet Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET to discuss the security situation in Gaza.\n\nThe meeting comes as the first convoys of critical humanitarian aid arrive in Gaza.\n\nLast week, the United States vetoed a resolution on humanitarian assistance in Gaza because it failed to \"mention Israel's right of self-defense\" in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack carried out by Hamas.\n\n\"Russia's resolution, put forward without any consultations, makes no mention of Hamas — none. By failing to condemn Hamas, Russia is giving cover to a terrorist group that brutalizes innocent civilians. It is outrageous, it is hypocritical and it is indefensible,\" Linda Thomas-Greenfield said before the United Nations Security Council on Oct. 18.\n\nThomas-Greenfield said the U.S. was working to address urgent humanitarian needs in Gaza and called for diplomacy carried out by President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres and regional partners to \"play out.\"\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nAt least 35 humanitarian workers have been killed since start of war, UN agency says\n\nPicture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty Images\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East wrote on social media site X that 35 workers have been killed since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"We are lost for words,\" UNRWA wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"We pay tribute to our 35 colleagues who have been killed in Gaza since 7 October. We grieve and we remember. These are not just numbers. These are our friends and colleagues. Many were teachers in our schools,\" the organization added.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nHamas says it has released two more hostages\n\nHostages And Missing Families Forum | via Reuters\n\nHamas said it has released two hostages, identified as Nurit Cooper and Yochved Lifshitz, for \"compelling humanitarian\" reasons.\n\nThe militant group said on its Telegram channel that the release was brokered through the governments of Egypt and Qatar. Hamas is estimated to have taken approximately 222 hostages.\n\nThe family of Lifshitz, 85, confirmed to NBC News the hostage release. The Times of Israel reports that both of the elderly women were from Nir Oz.\n\nHostages And Missing Families | via Reuters\n\nThough Hamas previously said it tried to release the two hostages on Friday, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it \"propaganda,\" and Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed skepticism that they would be released.\n\nEarlier in the day, the State Department declined to discuss U.S. and partner efforts to secure the release of hostages taken by Hamas more than two weeks ago.\n\n\"We do want to see all of the hostages released and we want to see them released unconditionally and we want to see them released as soon as possible,\" State Department spokesman Matt Miller told reporters during a daily press briefing.\n\nLast week, the first of the U.S. American hostages, mother and daughter Natalie and Judith Raanan, were released.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nState Department declines to provide an update on efforts to secure release of hostages\n\nThe State Department declined to provide an update on the U.S. efforts to secure the release of hostages held by Hamas.\n\n\"As for any details, because of the delicate and very sensitive nature of this entire issue, we don't find it productive to our objective to talk about the details publicly,\" State Department spokesman Matt Miller said.\n\nThe White House has previously said there are at least 10 U.S. citizens who remain unaccounted for.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nBlinken thanks State Department staff for work on Middle East\n\nJacquelyn Martin | Pool | via Reuters\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken thanked American civil servants for their work as the ongoing crisis in the Middle East intensifies.\n\n\"Over the past few weeks, amidst the terror, the violence, the suffering that's unfolding in the Middle East, we have seen how important a nimble and power diplomatic workforce is,\" Blinken said during remarks in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\"Our teams from Jerusalem to Cairo from Amman to Riyadh, in posts around the world, they've been working around the clock under tremendous pressure to shape our policy, to inform our understanding, to lead our diplomatic engagement with key partners to advance key goals for the United States,\" he added.\n\n— Amanda Macias\n\nU.S. troops in Syria targeted by drones, officials say\n\nU.S. troops in Syria were targeted by drones but there were no injuries, Reuters cited two U.S. officials as saying Monday.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the attack occurred at Al-Tanf base close to Syria's borders with Iraq and Jordan.\n\nIt marks the latest in a series of attacks against U.S. forces in the Middle East region.\n\n— Karen Gilchrist\n\nUK announces extra $24 million for Gaza aid\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Monday announced a further £20 million ($24.4 million) in humanitarian aid for Gaza, doubling its earlier funding.\n\nSunak also told the House of Commons that British intelligence analysis suggests that an explosion at Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City last week was likely caused by a missile fired from within Gaza. Both Israel and Hamas have blamed one another for the blast.\n\n\"The U.K. government judges that the explosion [at al-Ahli hospital] was likely caused by a missile or part of one that was launched from within Gaza towards Israel,\" he said.\n\n— Karen Gilchrist\n\nIsraeli soldiers conducting 'readiness' exercises for ground operations in Gaza, IDF says\n\nThomas Coex | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said Monday that its soldiers were conducting a \"variety of training exercises in order to improve the forces' readiness and capabilities for ground operations in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIn a post on social media site Telegram, it added that teams from the Infantry Corps, the Armored Corps and additional units were preparing for \"a number of different combat scenarios.\"\n\nIt also said that meetings were being held to \"tighten cooperation between air and ground forces.\"\n\nThe update comes as Israel is expected to launch a major ground incursion into Gaza. IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus reportedly said such an attack could be prevented on the basis of a full Hamas surrender and the return of Israeli hostages.\n\n— Karen Gilchrist\n\nImages show Palestinians preparing food in the Gaza Strip\n\nImages published Monday via Getty Images showed Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip preparing and receiving food amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\nMohammed Abed | Afp | Getty Images\n\nMohammed Abed | Afp | Getty Images\n\nMohammed Abed | Afp | Getty Images\n\nMohammed Abed | Afp | Getty Images\n\nMohammed Abed | Afp | Getty Images\n\n— Sam Meredith\n\nIsraeli Air Force says it intercepted drone from Lebanon\n\nThe Israeli Air Force said Monday via social media that air defense fighters intercepted a drone from Lebanon in Ein HaMifratz in northern Israel.\n\n\"Following the initial report on the activation of an alert in the Galilee area, the air defence fighters intercepted an unmanned aircraft that infiltrated from Lebanese territory into the State of Israel from the maritime space, in the area of Ein HaMifratz,\" the Israeli Air Force said via X, formerly known as Twitter, according to an NBC translation.\n\nIsrael has recently expanded its planned evacuations of communities in the north of the country as cross-border clashes intensify with fighters from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.\n\n— Sam Meredith\n\nEU talks focus on how to deliver humanitarian aid: Swedish FM\n\nThe crux of Monday talks between EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg focuses on how to bring critically needed humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, Sweden's foreign minister said Monday.\n\n\"The discussions are ongoing, but the question really isn't about a ceasefire, but about how to bring aid forward and that can be done in very many different ways,\" Tobias Billstrom told reporters after a meeting of EU foreign ministers, according to Reuters. He added that Sweden preferred the introduction of a humanitarian corridor.\n\nAnadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nEarlier in the day, EU top envoy Josep Borrell had floated the idea of a \"humanitarian pause\" to the hostilities between Israel and Hamas to allow human rights groups to deliver and safely distribute the aid sent through to the Gaza Strip.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nTurkey is sending four aid planes to Gaza\n\nAnadolu Agency | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nTurkey is sending four planes carrying humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip, Ankara's Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said in a Google-translated social media post.\n\nThe planes will fly to Egypt, from which point the goods will be sent to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing.\n\nKoca added that the aircrafts will deliver medical equipment and supplies, medication and generators — a critical component, as Gaza authorities say the local health system is collapsing amid shortages of electricity and fuel.\n\n\"We are happy to fulfill this responsibility on behalf of our nation. Our humanitarian responsibility does not end here. There is more,\" Koca said.\n\nSince the weekend, convoys carrying U.N.-brokered humanitarian aid have begun to reach the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, but human rights groups signal that the number of trucks and deliveries is insufficient to meet local needs.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nGaza says more than 5,000 people killed\n\nHamas-run health authorities in Gaza said over 5,000 people were killed since the Oct. 7 start of the war between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe figures, released by Health Ministry spokesperson Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, include 2,055 children. Some 15,273 people remain injured.\n\nThe enclosure has been under perpetual bombardment from Israeli forces, which are pursuing the forces of Hamas, following the Palestinian militant group's multi-pronged terror attacks of early October. Israel has sealed off the Gaza Strip, depriving it of its water, fuel, food and electricity resources, and these shortages — combined with the absence of medical equipment — are bringing the Gaza health system near collapse, human rights group and the Palestinian health ministry have previously said.\n\nAt least 1,400 Israeli people have been killed since the start of the conflict, according to official figures out Friday. Roughly 222 hostages remain abducted by Hamas in Gaza, Israeli military says.\n\nCNBC could not verify the figures supplied by either side of the conflict.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nGaza Strip urgently needs fuel, UN relief agency says\n\nThe blockaded Gaza Strip needs fuel supplies as urgently as it does water and food resources, an official for the U.N. Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said Monday.\n\n\"No fuel has come into Gaza for the last two weeks,\" UNRWA Director of External Relations Tamara Alrifai told CNN in a TV interview, \"And without fuel, it's not going to be possible to go around Gaza in our trucks and distribute assistance or to power the water desalination plants and get clean drinking water or to power hospitals and their live-saving machines.\"\n\nShe added that the convoys of humanitarian aid that have entered the Gaza Strip since the weekend represent a \"trickle\" of the volume of supplies needed to support the civilian population of the region.\n\n\"These trucks really only contain a fraction of what is needed, given the immense, immense humanitarian needs,\" she said, noting that the Gaza Strip previously received roughly 100 trucks of humanitarian aid and fuel per day.\n\nIsrael cut off its own deliveries of water, fuel, food and electricity to the Gaza Strip and refuses to reinstate them, on the premise that they would support the forces of Palestinian militant group Hamas stationed within the territory.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nIsraeli military says it fired on 'aerial target' from Lebanon\n\nThe Israeli military said on Monday it had launched an interceptor missile at a \"suspicious aerial target\" that crossed in from Lebanon, and that sirens had been sounded in areas of the border as a precaution.\n\n-Reuters\n\nCurrent Gaza aid supplies are a 'drop in the ocean,' Chatham House says\n\nwatch now\n\nCurrent aid supplies to Gaza are \"drop in the ocean\" that will have little substantial impact, Chatham House associate fellow Yossi Mekelberg said Monday.\n\n\"Some humanitarian help is better than none, but this is a drop in the ocean. Twenty to 40 trucks [or] lorries won't make a huge difference, you need at least 100 a day,\" he told CNBC after the first aid convoys entered the embattled territory over the weekend.\n\nNoting that the conflict is unlikely to be resolved within the coming days or weeks, Mekelberg advised that new political thinking would likely be needed to reach a solution that is agreeable to both sides.\n\n\"You need new leadership in both political entities. You need people to think about peaceful coexistence — a two-state solution in a one-state reality,\" he said.\n\n\"You need innovative and creative ideas and you need a new generation that understands that violence will just breed more violence and bloodshed and won't improve the lives of either side one iota.\"\n\n— Karen Gilchrist\n\nWhat next if Israel launches a ground offensive into Gaza?\n\nA ground incursion by Israel into Gaza is unlikely over the next 48 to 72 hours or possibly even the rest of the week, according to one analyst. While it appears to be inevitable — the bigger question might be what comes next.\n\nSamuel Ramani, associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday that it is \"very, very hard\" to understand what could happen if and when Israel achieves its immediate strategy of destroying Hamas.\n\nAsked whether there is a danger that Israel may end up in a position that it can't then get out of, Ramani replied, \"That's actually what some of the Israeli officials have even been saying, you know, off the record and privately to various media outlets: We don't really know what will happen next.\"\n\nRamani added, \"It is very, very hard to understand what will happen once Hamas goes, and the risk is that many civilians die in this war, Hamas could be going underground, or new extremist movements could develop and Israel's security could be threatened once again.\"\n\n— Sam Meredith\n\nGreece's prime minister arrives in Israel\n\nLudovic Marin | Afp | Getty Images\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis arrived in Israel on Monday and will meet his Israeli counterpart Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.\n\nMitsotakis is set to return to Greece later in the day, his office said in a Google-translated update.\n\nThe Greek prime minister has previously expressed full support of Israel and its right to defend against the forces of Palestinian militant group Hamas, while urging a need to avoid a humanitarian crisis in the besieged Gaza Strip.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nSlovenia's foreign minister calls for humanitarian cease-fire\n\nSopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images\n\nSlovenia's foreign minister on Monday added to calls for a humanitarian cease-fire to the Israel-Hamas conflict, as she joins EU counterparts for a meeting in Luxembourg.\n\n\"We are calling for urgent humanitarian cease-fire for establishment of humanitarian corridors for humanitarian assistance to civilians. We have to act according to international law, according to humanitarian law, and do everything so that the conflict does not spill into the region,\" Tanja Fajon said, expressing concern over the electricity, food, fuel and water shortages faced by the blockaded civilians of the bombarded Gaza Strip.\n\nShe noted that these residents need \"hundreds of trucks every day\" of humanitarian aid. U.N. supplies began to enter the Gaza Strip over the weekend through the Rafah crossing that bridges the enclave with Egypt.\n\n\"We strongly condemn any form of terror. We strongly condemn holding hostages and mostly killing of innocent civilians,\" Fajon said.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nEU chief envoy calls for humanitarian pause to hostilities\n\nThe European Union's top diplomat Josep Borrell on Monday called for a pause in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Now the most important thing is for humanitarian support to go into Gaza,\" Borrell told reporters in Luxembourg, according to Reuters.\n\n\"Personally, I think a humanitarian pause is needed in order to allow humanitarian support to come in and be distributed.\"\n\nJorge Guerrero | Afp | Getty Images\n\nThe EU is on Monday holding a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, where officials intend to discuss Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, tensions in Armenia and Azerbaijan and \"the situation in Israel and in the region, following Hamas' brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks across Israel and the events unfolding in Gaza,\" the bloc says.\n\n\"I cannot anticipate the result of the meeting but it is certainly something which the ministers will have to discuss ... The Secretary-General of the United Nations asked for it very much,\" Borrell said Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who traveled to Israel to oversee preparations for a humanitarian aid convoy to Gaza at the end of last week, urged not to lose sight of the two-state solution to long-arching hostilities between Israeli and Palestinian people.\n\nEarlier on Saturday, Guterres had called for the release of hostages held by Hamas, sustained humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip and diplomatic efforts to prevent the spill of the Israel-Hamas conflict into the broader Middle Eastern region.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nPeople should take sides in Israel-Hamas conflict, IDF spokesperson says\n\nAn Israeli military spokesperson criticized the recent spread of protests against Israel as uninformed, urging non-participants in the country's conflict with Hamas to take sides on moral grounds.\n\n\"I think that people who are out and are protesting against Israel are either uninformed or really filled with hate towards Israel based on things that have nothing to do with what is going on with Gaza now,\" Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told ABC Radio Melbourne on Sunday night.\n\nDemonstrators have taken to the streets of several Middle Eastern and European countries out of solidarity with the Palestinian civilians of the Gaza Strip, who face severe electricity, medical, food, fuel and water shortages as a result of Israel's retaliatory siege against Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\n\"I don't think that we should be forced to provide sustenance to the same enemy that is firing rockets at our civilians and trying to kill our civilians,\" Conricus said, referencing Israel's decision to interrupt deliveries of its own supplies to the Gaza Strip within days of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks.\n\nAntisemitic incidents and hate crimes have also picked up in the two weeks since the start of hostilities.\n\n\"I actually think that one should take sides. One should take sides and choose, according to your own morals, where you stand,\" Conricus added. \"We are not the aggressor. We didn't start this war ... We are now defending ourselves.\"\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nFull Hamas surrender and return of hostages could prevent ground incursion, IDF says\n\nA full surrender of Palestinian group Hamas and the return of Israeli hostages could end Israel's war in the Gaza Strip and prevent a ground incursion, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus told ABC Radio Melbourne on Sunday night.\n\n\"If Hamas were to come out of their hiding places, that they hide underneath the civilian places, which is what they're doing now, return our hostages, all 212 of them, and surrender unconditionally, then the war will end. If they won't, we will probably have to go in and get it done,\" he said, declining to elaborate if dismantling Hamas or rescuing hostages is the current IDF priority.\n\n\"The aim here is to totally dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities. If that can be done from the air, and with standoff measures, with very limited exposure to our troops and less damage on the ground, that would be great,\" he added.\n\nJalaa Marey | Afp | Getty Images\n\nAn Israeli ground incursion into the Gaza Strip has been long anticipated since the IDF instructed civilians in northern Gaza to evacuate southward toward the end of the first week of hostilities. Human rights groups have decried the possibility, pointing to a likely exacerbation of the existing humanitarian crisis in the embattled enclosure. Conricus reiterated that the IDF does not set out to target civilians, while claiming that Hamas uses non-combatants as human shields.\n\n\"Once we will bury our dead, we will get busy with Hamas, we will see an end to the Hamas, and then the security situation Israel and also for Gaza will be better,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\n17 people killed in Gaza in two airstrikes Monday, ministry of interior says\n\nSeventeen people were killed and dozens were injured in two Israeli airstrikes in the north of the Gaza Strip on Monday morning, the Palestinian Ministry of Interior said in a Google-translated update on Telegram.\n\nThe ministry added that the two offensives hit two residences.\n\nThe Israel Defense Force on Sunday night said it was continuing to strike \"dozens of Hamas terror targets in the Gaza Strip,\" as part of its ongoing retaliatory offensive in the region for the Hamas multi-pronged attacks of Oct. 7. On Monday morning, the IDF said it had struck over 320 military targets in the Gaza Strip over the course of the past day.\n\nThe Israeli military says it does not target civilians in Gaza and exclusively pursues Hamas positions.\n\nCNBC could not independently verify the reports.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nIsraeli military says it struck further Hezbollah positions\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces said they struck more military positions held by Lebanese militant group Hezbollah overnight.\n\nThe targets included infrastructure including a military compound and an observation post, along with four cells on the border with Lebanon.\n\nCNBC could not independently verify developments on the ground.\n\nIsrael and Hezbollah have been exchanging fire since the start of Israel's conflict with Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nWHO says further medical supplies reached Gaza Strip\n\nAdditional medical supplies from the World Health Organization have entered the Gaza Strip, the organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said early Monday on social media.\n\nThe WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean said this equipment will facilitate surgical interventions for 1,300 people, basic and essential health services for 100,000 patients for a duration of three months, along with treatment for 150,000 chronic disease patients.\n\nTedros reiterated a call for sustained safe passage for the humanitarian aid convoy and for fuel volumes so sustain both the delivery trucks delivering the assistance and the health facilities of the territories, which have been struggling with electricity shortages.\n\nA first humanitarian truck convoy entered the Gaza Strip over the weekend, through the Rafah crossing that borders the territory by way of Egypt.\n\n— Ruxandra Iordache\n\nFeeling unsafe, many American Jews are buying guns and taking training classes\n\nLucas Jackson | Reuters\n\nIn the wake of the deadly terrorist attack on Israel earlier this month and the country's response to it, protestors and bigots have taken to social media to spout hateful rhetoric about Israelis. Now, many American Jews who feel unsafe are putting aside their distaste for guns and gun ownership and are buying weapons to protect themselves, according to an NBC News report.\n\nThere has been a rush of new customers seeking to buy guns and train up how to use them, according to NBC News.\n\n\"We've definitely seen a tremendous increase in religious Jewish people, Orthodox people, purchasing firearms,\" David Kowalsky, owner of Florida Gun Store in Hollywood, who also offers firearms training, told NBC News. \"I've seen a surge in interest in individual training as well as group training.\"\n\nSee the NBC News report here.\n\n— Terri Cullen\n\n14 more humanitarian aid trucks cross over into Gaza\n\nMohammed Abed | Afp | Getty Images\n\nA 20-truck convoy filled with medical supplies, food and water passed through the Rafah Crossing into Gaza on Saturday, with 14 more crossing over on Sunday.\n\nThe aid will continue to flow on a daily basis, according to David Satterfield, Special Envoy for Middle East Humanitarian Issues.\n\nThe goal is to have a \"continuous flow of assistance moving\" to Gaza, said Satterfield on MSNBC's \"Inside with Jen Psaki.\"\n\nSatterfield said that Hamas, which the United States has designated a terrorist group, has been warned that if it interferes with the aid there is a chance that it stops.\n\nIsrael's potential ground invasion into Gaza could also make it more difficult to deliver aid, he said. There has been concern over Palestinians' access to water as well, and Satterfield said that the U.S. is working with the Israeli government to restore water pipelines.\n\nSatterfield said one of the two key pipelines is restored and they are working on the other.\n\n\"The people of Gaza need to be able to live secure lives in Gaza and that requires an end to Hamas' ability to govern, to exploit and to dominate with their terror,\" said Satterfield.\n\nIn addition to aid delivery, Satterfield is working on finding ways for Americans and foreign nationals in Gaza to be able to leave.\n\n— Jake Piazza\n\nWhite House confirms there will be 'continued flow' of Gaza humanitarian aid\n\nGPO | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Sunday had a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and the status of Gaza.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu \"affirmed that there will now be continued flow\" of critical humanitarian assistance into Gaza, the White House said in a statement.\n\nThe first wave of humanitarian aid trickled into Gaza on Saturday via 20 trucks that crossed the Rafah border in northern Egypt.\n\nThe aid is ready to be deployed according to United Nations World Food Programme Director Cindy McCain, but the trucks have been standing by waiting for clearance to pass through the Rafah crossing.\n\nCivilians in Gaza, caught in the crossfire of the war, have been left without basic necessities like food, water, shelter and medical resources.\n\nWhile speaking to Netanyahu, Biden also mentioned the ongoing efforts to release American hostages and provide safe passage for U.S. citizens to leave Gaza.\n\n— Rebecca Picciotto\n\nBlinken says U.S. is 'ready' to respond if Israel-Hamas war escalates, targets American forces\n\nJacquelyn Martin | Pool | via Reuters\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the United States expects the Israel-Hamas war to escalate by proxies of Iran directed against American armed forces and personnel, and that the U.S. is prepared to respond in the event that happens.\n\n\"We are taking steps to make sure that we can effectively defend our people and respond decisively if we need to. This is not what we want, not what we're looking for. We don't want escalation.\" Blinken said at an appearance during NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"We don't want to see a second or third front develop.
