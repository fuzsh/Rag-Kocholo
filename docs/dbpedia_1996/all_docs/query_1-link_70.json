        "text": "The publisher and CEO of the mass-circulation daily Ma'ariv will play the publisher of a large newspaper in the drama series \"Crime Reporter,\" which is now being filmed and will be broadcast on Channel 1. At the center of the series is a crime reporter who discovers corruption at the newspaper for which he works - called Ha'erev - in which his publisher is also involved. The role of the corrupt publisher is played by an actor, whereas Maariv's Ofer Nimrodi plays the publisher of the competing newspaper, Hadshot Hayom.\n\nThe makers of the series and the chief scriptwriters, mass-circulation daily Yedioth Ahronoth journalist Gideon Meron and journalist Ofer Grinstein of the Jerusalem weekly Kol Ha'ir, are strenuously opposed to bringing Nimrodi in as an actor, and argue that the casting decision raises a moral and ethical problem, and casts a stain on the series' credibility. Thus a dispute has developed between them and the director of the series, Haim Buzaglo (\"Zinzana,\" \"Yarkon District\"), who decided to use Nimrodi. The filming of the scenes in the series with Nimrodi are slated to begin tomorrow at his office in the Ma'ariv building.\n\nThe series \"Crime Reporter\" is based on Meron's experiences from his stint as a crime reporter at Maariv. Meron served as a crime reporter at the paper from 1988 to 1993 and went over to Yedioth Ahronoth a few months after Maariv was acquired by the Nimrodi family. Since then, he has served as a magazine writer at Yedioth. The main character in the series is a crime reporter, Udi (based on Meron), who daily confronts moral and ethical dilemmas, copes with pressure and is gradually exposed to the corruption and lack of integrity revealed at his newspaper and in the police force. The series is fictional, but relates to a string of well-known affairs that have actually occurred and touched upon the relationship between the media, the police, the State Prosecutor's Office and the world of crime. Among other things, episodes in the series deal with electronic eavesdropping between the newspapers, pressures applied on the reporter and the editor-in-chief by various elements, attempts by the publisher to influence the content of the newspaper, and the relationship between advertisers and the press.\n\nMeron and Grinstein expressed opposition to the integration of Nimrodi into the show, but director Buzaglo has the right to decide in matters of casting. Before Nimrodi, Buzaglo had decided to cast Sarit Rosenstein, daughter of criminal Ze'ev Rosenstein, as the daughter of a well-known criminal, as well as Itzik Zohar as a soccer player, of course.\n\nYesterday Meron said: \"I have vehemently expressed my opposition to [Nimrodi's casting] to the producer of the series and to the director. It is untenable that a series that purports to expose improper conduct of the Israeli media will cast in any role a person who has a great deal of influence in the Israeli media, no matter who that person is. It is untenable that the publisher of a newspaper will act in a series that strongly criticizes the press. The casting casts a stain on the credibility of the series, morally and ethically. One of the main messages of the series was to hold up a mirror that reflects the innards of the media in a real, bold and unbiased way.\n\n\"This casting turns the whole thing into a gimmick, and in fact biases its contents in directions that the series rejects. To my regret, I don't have the right of veto in the matter of casting, and it is very painful to watch and see how the moral basis on which `Crime Reporter' was written is being knocked out from under it, with considerations of gimmickry overriding artistic values.\"\n\nGrinstein: \"When it was decided to bring in Itzik Zohar, we said no big deal; Rosenstein's daughter is an actress, so that is still okay. But when the owner of a newspaper is in the series, we have a big problem. This is not a reality series. They wouldn't have brought the chief of staff into [the Channel 2 show] `Basic Training.' Nimrodi will be involved in the series in the kinds of events that occurred in reality, but in a context other than that of reality.\n\n\"This transmits an unwritten message about who the other publisher is. Nimrodi stood trial and paid for what he did, but anyone who isn't really familiar with all the details of that affair and sees Nimrodi in the series could think that at Yedioth Ahronoth they are corrupt and tied to the world of crime. This turns the series into a reality show that is the opposite of reality.\"\n\nIn response, Haim Buzaglo has replied: \"The choice of Nimrodi was made in accordance with professional considerations because he is a good actor and this suits him. It's nice that the publisher of a newspaper plays himself. The plot is fictional and there is a distance between imagination and reality. I don't know of any objection to the matter on the part of the scriptwriters, but I do casting as the director. I don't see a moral problem here. Nimrodi plays a role in the series, and if there are real things in the series then ... I don't need to make a big effort to explain to the viewer who it is all about.\"\n\nNimrodi confirmed yesterday that the series' producers had contacted him with the request that he play the character of a publisher, and he said that even though this was unusual, he agreed.\n\nOfer Nimrodi was convicted in 1998 of electronic eavesdropping on senior people at Yedioth and was sentenced to eight months in prison. In 2001 he was convicted of obstructing legal proceedings and breach of trust, and sentenced to 25 months in prison and was forced to pay a fine of NIS 394,000."
