        "text": "Propaganda and Promotion of Favored Narratives\n\nKey narratives\n\nChinese government propaganda and narratives reach Israeli audiences via several key channels, as outlined below. These narratives often appear aimed at encouraging a sense of closeness between Israel and China or between the Jewish and Chinese peoples, at times either implicitly or explicitly countering United States, defense industry, or other critics’ concerns over the national security implications of too cozy a relationship. Key points relayed by Chinese state sources include reference to the fact that China and Israel are both descendants of ancient people and therefore can and should cooperate well together; that both China and Israel are misrepresented in mainstream international media, implying that Israelis should be skeptical about negative coverage of the Chinese government in global media; and that China saved 30,000 Jews during the Holocaust. Chinese state media and diplomats have also actively tried to whitewash or dismiss severe human rights violations against ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang, publishing misleading articles and posts about counter terrorism campaigns, dismissing documentation of abuses as lies, or offering distorted representations of Ramadan celebrations. The thematic focus on defending Chinese state policies in Xinjiang to Israeli audiences appeared to increase in early 2022. There is also much repetition of the stereotype widely present in China that Jews are smart and good at business.\n\nIn other instances, Chinese state representatives more directly argue that increased tensions between China and the United States do not mean that Israel should perceive China as an enemy. January 2022 also marked the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Israel, triggering exchanges of messages between Xi Jinping and Israeli President Isaac Herzog, as well as between Chinese premier Li Keqiang and Israel Prime Minister Bennett. This followed a November 2021 call between Herzog and Xi, which was reported upon in local media.\n\nA typical example of the above talking points appeared in an August 2021 op-ed by former embassy spokesperson Wang Yongjun about how Israel should balance its relationship with the United States and China:\n\nThe longstanding friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Jewish people can date back a thousand years ago…. China and China-Israel relations should be viewed in a fair, objective perspective…. We believe the Jewish people, known for their wisdom, can make the choice that best serves their interests.\n\nKey avenues of content dissemination\n\nChinese state media outlets—such as China Global Television Network (CGTN) or China Daily have no direct broadcasting or dissemination to the Israeli public via traditional media. Several outlets have correspondents based in the country, particularly in Jerusalem, but they only report about current events occurring in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip for Chinese and international audiences rather than producing news targeting Israeli and Palestinian news consumers. In May 2019, Cai Mingzhao, the head of the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency and a member of the CCP’s powerful Central Committee visited Israel, but no cooperation agreements with local outlets were announced.\n\nNevertheless, the following are some of the ways in which Beijing-produced content or favored narratives have insinuated themselves into mainstream Israeli media:\n\nChina Radio International (CRI): The major exception to Chinese state media’s relatively limited presence in Israel is China Radio International (CRI), launched in 2009 during a visit by then-Director of State Council Information Office Wang Chen. Although the outlet does not broadcast on the radio, it has a social media presence (including a Facebook page with 93,000 followers at the end of 2021) and a Hebrew-language website: https://hebrew.cri.cn/.\n\nAt the center of CRI’s outreach is Xi Xiaoqi, deputy editor of the outlet’s Hebrew desk, a young and charismatic Chinese man who speaks fluent Hebrew. Better known in Israel as “Itzik”, or “Itzik HaSini” (“Chinese Itzik”), Xi graduated from the Communication University of China in Beijing in 2009 with a major in Hebrew and joined CRI the same year as its correspondent in Israel. Over time, Xi has emerged as a media personality in his own right, being invited on primetime television talk shows to provide commentary about China and garnering a following of 22,000 subscribers on YouTube and 13,000 on Facebook. During the coverage period, local media published profiles and interviews with him, including in the conservative weekly Makor Rishon (“First Source”) in November 2021 and in the Sephardic ultra-Orthodox weekly Yom Le’Yom (“Day to Day”) in February 2020. Xi also made a guest appearance in February 2020 on a popular political satire show. In 2016, he partnered with the Tel Aviv municipality to produce a music video in Chinese promoting the city as a tourist destination. Xi has been able to win over Israelis due to his fluent and vernacular Hebrew, his demonstrated mastery of Israeli pop culture, and what appears as genuine affection he and his immediate family have to all things Israeli and Hebrew. His success has garnered praise a model for replication from Chinese university programs focused on international communications.\n\nMuch of the content that Xi and CRI produce is soft news related to Chinese culture, food, and language, or about his own journey of learning Hebrew (a rarity among Chinese speakers and a novelty for Israeli audiences). The featured video on his YouTube channel, a 15-minute clip from late 2020 about how he learned Hebrew, had garnered over 130,000 views and over 1,000 largely positive comments in Hebrew by December 2021. Much of the content on CRI’s page is similarly focused on Sino-Israeli cultural affinity or various videos highlighting tourist sites or clickbait cooking videos. Posts with more political or propagandistic news (such as a meeting between Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin or a congratulatory message from Xi Jinping to China’s international broadcasters) typically receive much lower engagement. On the whole, Xi’s efforts have supported CCP propaganda goals of promoting a benign image of the regime or downplaying the reality of its authoritarian rule and egregious human rights record.\n\nCo-productions with Israeli public broadcaster and commercial television station: In another important instance of CRI content reaching local audiences, beginning in 2017, the Israeli government-funded public broadcaster Kan partnered with CRI to produce a series of about 20 video clips about China on topics such as Chinese medicine or cuisine in Chengdu, including one about Xi Xiaoqi himself. In a March 2020 article, the media watchdog website “Seventh Eye” published an investigative report revealing that CRI had paid 800,000 NIS ($230,000) for the production of the videos, above average for such programming. Under the agreement, Kan reportedly granted CRI joint editing and content oversight, alongside adherence to Kan’s ethical code although the Israeli partner committed to taking into consideration “cultural sensitivities.” The credits at the end of the clips acknowledge joint production with Chinese state media but do not note that they were the primary funder of the content. Moreover, the details of the deal only emerged after a freedom of information request, the response to which was itself partly redacted by the Israeli broadcaster.\n\nIn another example of CRI collaboration with local news outlets, in 2021, the private Channel 12 station aired “Made in China,” a five-episode primetime series filmed in China and featuring Xi Xiaoqi. Xi served as the segments’ “man on the ground” offering narration and commentary on toy and electric car manufacturing, China's handling of COVID, or the alleged defection of China's head of counterintelligence Dong Jingwei. In available online clips from 2021, there is no disclaimer informing the audience that Xi is a Chinese state media employee.\n\nChinese embassy and ambassadorial communications: The Chinese embassy in Israel has also played a key role in delivering Chinese government messages to the Israeli public. As in other countries, ambassadors or other embassy personnel have periodically published op-eds in the local press. For example, the current ambassador Cai Run who assumed the post in April 2021 published the article “The Code to China’s Development” in July 2021, in Israel Today (Israel Hayom), a free daily and the country’s most widely circulated newspaper.\n\nFormer ambassador Zhan Yongxin from 2015 to 2020 also published multiple op-eds in outlets like Israel Today, Ha’aretz, and the English-language Jerusalem Post, and gave media interviews regularly. Cai’s predecessor Du Wei also gave a notable interview to the ultra-Orthodox newspaper Yated Ne’eman just before he passed away in May 2020, signaling a concerted effort to reach that sector of the Israeli population. The embassy’s Hebrew website is regularly updated and the outpost also has an account on Facebook, which has only 1,000 followers.\n\nJournalist and business representative travel: As in other countries, the Chinese government or related entities have invited Israeli journalists on all expense paid trips to China, including in some cases to Xinjiang. The most recent such trip occurred in 2019, when Erez Lin, a reporter from Israel Today, joined the delegation. Upon his return, the paper published a large feature article titled “Peace and Security, Made in China,” which uncritically repeated Chinese government talking points, framed mass re-education in Xinjiang as a potentially legitimate anti-terrorism tactic, and downplayed the authoritativeness of reports of abuse. The article included a short disclosure at the bottom stating that “the author was part of a delegation of journalists from around the world who were invited on a tour by the Chinese government to the province of Xinjiang.”\n\nAlthough it remains unclear if this factor played a role, it is notable that the owners of the paper, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, had built much of their fortune via casinos in Macau (Sheldon Adelson passed away in January 2021, leaving the business in his wife’s hands). The family also owns the conservative weekly magazine Makor Rishon (First Source), which in November published a glowing profile and cover feature with CRI reporter Xi Xiaoqi.\n\nThe Chinese government has also cultivated relationships with other local influential members of Israeli society, particularly from the business sector, who have periodically echoed Chinese official talking points. In one notable recent case, Israeli entrepreneur Raz Gal-Or has become something of a social media sensation in China, also featured in state media reports. Although his primary audience is not Israeli, local media have also run feature pieces about his success. His father is president of the Israeli Chamber of Commerce in China and hosts his own Hebrew podcast “Zman Sin” (“China Time”). Investigations in 2021 by the New York Times and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) included Raz Gal-Or among examples of social media influencers who had spread propaganda points regarding Xinjiang in their videos. They found that “In the weeks that followed, the video, along with other clips of Mr. Gal-Or in Xinjiang, were shared on Facebook and Twitter by at least 35 accounts run by Chinese embassies and official news outlets.” One video, for example, in which Gal-Or speaks in English while visiting a Uyghur family, received over 650,000 views, far above his 250,000 channel subscribers.\n\nDisinformation campaigns\n\nNo evidence was found of disinformation campaigns that used fake accounts targeting Israel or of content from global campaigns linked to China on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook reaching local audiences. However, misleading and false information related to events in Xinjiang were shared in Hebrew by Chinese diplomats or state media like CRI. For the purposes of this report, disinformation is defined as the purposeful dissemination of false or misleading content, especially through inauthentic activity—via fake accounts, for example—on global social media platforms.\n\nCensorship and intimidation\n\nWhile there were no reported incidents of physical or technical intimidation from China-linked actors towards Israeli journalists during the coverage period, there were several indications of the Chinese embassy closely monitoring Israeli media commentary on China and responding rapidly to voice its disagreement and request apologies or deletions.\n\nIn July 2020, popular morning talk show host Avri Gilad did a live monologue acknowledging the 21st anniversary since the CCP launched its campaign against the Falun Gong spiritual practice, as local adherents were planning a protest in front of the Chinese embassy that day. Gilad also spoke about organ transplant abuses in China and broadly commented on the repressive nature of the regime. The Chinese embassy apparently saw the clip and quickly sent a letter of complaint, which Gilad then read on air in an effort to expose the attempt to influence his commentary. In another case in May 2022, the English-language Jerusalem Post published an interview with Taiwan’s foreign minister Joseph Wu. The piece prompted an almost immediate response from the Chinese embassy, which first called editor-in-chief Yaakov Katz and then followed-up with an email condemning the piece and demanding it be removed from the paper’s website as part of “real actions to eliminate the egregious impacts of the interview and contribute to China-Israel relations.” Katz refused the request and publicized the incident. This was not the first time Katz had heard from the embassy, having received a complaint earlier in May over an op-ed by an exiled Uyghur leader and counter-op-eds by embassy representatives to editorials published in 2021 that were critical of China or its impact on Israel’s relations with the United States.\n\nSuch pressures extend both directly and indirectly to the small community of China-focused academic researchers in Israel, who are an essential source of commentary for journalists given a limited China expertise among reporters. Chinese government ties to Israel’s academic sector have increased over the past two decades, indirectly affecting media coverage and some local expert commentary regarding China. Two Israeli universities host Confucius Institutes, namely Tel-Aviv University and Hebrew University in Jerusalem and receive funding for study abroad programs in China. Some scholars have reported being encouraged to express a benign view of Beijing or being cautious about public commentary on human rights in China, even as others publicly expressed criticism of the Chinese government or conducted research on politically sensitive topics. In a 2021 radio interview, an Asian Studies scholar from the University of Haifa explained, “There is a constant sense of pressure from China to push a particular narrative and we talk about those limitations explicitly [among Israeli academics].” In 2021, scholar Roie Yellinek was contacted by the Chinese embassy who requested a meeting over an article he had written about the persecution of Uyghurs in China. Soon after, Yellinek received a message from LinkedIn that his account had been blocked for viewing to users in China because he had posted “prohibited content,” similar to messages received by critics of the Chinse government in other countries.\n\nIn another incident that affected access to information in Israel and around the world, in May 2021, Israeli website hosting company Wix was approached by Hong Kong authorities asking them to remove pro-democracy website 2021HKCharter.com from their servers because its messages are “likely to constitute offenses endangering national security.” The letter warned that if they refused, their employees could face a fine and a six-month prison term under Hong Kong’s National Security Law. Wix removed the website, but after activists exposed the incident to international media, the firm backtracked, apologized, reinstated the site, and committed to reconsidering their screening process for future requests.\n\nControl over content distribution infrastructure\n\nThe Chinese government and PRC-based companies have relatively limited control over content delivery systems in Israel. Nevertheless, two avenues of content dissemination are owned by such companies and have a growing market presence. The first is mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which had a 29 percent market share in Israel as of 2020. The second is the short video app TikTok, a global subsidiary of the Beijing-based social media company ByteDance. In June 2022, it was the most downloaded app in the Google Play store and third most used, while it ranked fourth in the iPhone store. Several local media outlets have accounts on the platform as does the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF allows soldiers to post as well, although cybersecurity firm CheckPoint noted in mid-2020 that there are “multiple vulnerabilities” within the application, which could allow attackers to manipulate videos or reveal personal information linked to the account. There have been some documented cases around the world in recent years of TikTok removing or downplaying politically sensitive content, including content that violates domestic Chinese censorship guidelines, although the company has subsequently reported correcting errors. A media report from June 2022 based on leaked TikTok meetings raised concern that statements made by ByteDance regarding data privacy of US users were false, and more broadly called into question other statements the company has made regarding its policies. To date, no evidence has emerged of content restrictions or manipulation regarding political topics or China being implemented in Israel.\n\nFour companies with local, North American, or European ownership dominate the telecommunications infrastructure, leaving little space for a PRC-based company like Huawei to enter the market, although Huawei, ZTE and several other Chinese tech firms have made substantial investments in Israel’s technology sector more broadly.\n\nDissemination of CCP media norms, tactics, or governance models\n\nThere were no known trips to China by Israeli government officials documented during the coverage period, and no evidence that journalists who traveled on paid trips were inclined to adopt Chinese government norms of journalism.\n\nIn terms of equipment exports, however, Israel has purchased a large amount of broadcasting equipment. In 2019, the main product that China exported to Israel was $582 million worth of broadcasting equipment, although few additional details were found.\n\nChinese diaspora media\n\nGiven the limited number of ethnic Chinese residing in Israel, there are not dedicated outlets serving the community. Most receive their news online from Chinese-language websites, social media platforms, and state media. The Times of Israel, a major English-language newspaper in Israel, temporarily produced a Chinese-language edition in addition to versions in Arabic, Persian, and French, but discontinued the publication prior to the coverage period of this report."
