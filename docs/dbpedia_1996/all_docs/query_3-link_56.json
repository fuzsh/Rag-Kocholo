        "text": "US Officials Furious Over Israel’s Assassination of Hamas Leader: Report\n\nBy The Media Line Staff\n\nIsrael informed the US immediately after the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, taking responsibility for the action, according to a report published Wednesday in The Washington Post. The move angered members of President Joe Biden’s administration, who were concerned it could jeopardize ongoing cease-fire negotiations in Gaza, the Post reported.\n\nUS officials are frustrated with Israel’s lack of prior communication before conducting other operations against Hezbollah or Iranian commanders. An anonymous Israeli official confirmed that a phone call between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was tense following Haniyeh’s death.\n\nDespite the tension, sources familiar with the internal discussions indicate that the American president is not expected to apply significant pressure on Israel, such as restricting military aid.\n\nIn recent developments, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged both Iran and Israel to avoid further escalating the conflict. After meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Australian officials, Blinken stated that cease-fire talks and efforts to release hostages in Gaza were nearing their final stage.\n\nAdditionally, the US has deployed F/A-18 fighter jets to the Middle East to support Israel against potential Iranian attacks. The Pentagon stated that this increased military presence is intended to de-escalate regional tensions."
