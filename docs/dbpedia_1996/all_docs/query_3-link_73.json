        "text": "AP Adrift: The Houthis’ Maritime ‘Retaliation’ & Hamas’ ‘Relative Moderate’\n\nUnmoored from facts, AP terms Houthi attacks on international commercial ships as \"retaliation\" for Israel's war against Hamas, labels Ismail Haniyah a \"relative moderate,\" and affords Hamas more credibility than Israel.\n\nPBS Relocates Holon Stabbing Attack Into West Bank\n\nIn her Aug. 4 PBS Weekend News broadcast, Laura Barrón-López misidentified Holon, the site in central Israel of a deadly stabbing attack, as located within the West Bank.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Post-Political Lives of Anti-Israel Politicians\n\nJamaal Bowman, the anti-Israel Congressman from New York's 16th Congressional District, has lost his primary fight. Leading news outlets like POLITICO echoed claims that Bowman's loss was due to the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. But as CAMERA tells Washington Examiner Magazine, the truth is otherwise, and Bowman is just one in a long line of anti-Israel politicians to blame AIPAC for his electoral loss.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Long History of Palestinian Rejectionism\n\nIsrael needs to embrace victory and cease its decades long failed strategy of conciliation. So argues Daniel Pipes in his latest book. CAMERA reviews the book for the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nCNN: Journalism in Service of Hamas War Crimes\n\nCNN’s coverage portrays three separate standards in the law of armed conflict: a unique, higher standard applied to the Jewish state; the standard applied to the rest of the world; and no standard to Palestinian terrorists who seek to wipe the Jewish state from the face of the earth.\n\nBad Actors and Willing Dupes in Hamas’ Propaganda War\n\nHamas' propaganda war to cast the Jewish state as genocidal is carried out with the engagement of bad actors, including health workers, and willing dupes from the mainstream media.\n\nJohn Oliver’s Latest Rant About Israel Is As Misinformed As It Is Crass\n\nOliver has told only half the story, and his cherry-picked facts, or in some cases outright falsehoods, are designed to lead his viewers to specific conclusions.\n\nHamas’s Haniyeh: The Media’s “Moderate” Murderer?\n\nThe word \"moderate\" doesn't belong near the name Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of the extremist terror group Hamas. If there are Hamas officials who are even more extreme than him, then he is at best less extreme, but still extreme.\n\nHezbollah Massacres Children and the Washington Post Blames Israel\n\nHezbollah, the Lebanese-based U.S.-designated terror group, has murdered a dozen Druze children and wounded dozens more in northern Israel. But the Washington Post chooses to devote front-page coverage to Israel's response, while providing Hezbollah with cover.\n\nThe New Wall Street Journal – Chasing Clicks with Anti-Israel Bias\n\nThe growing, undeniable tilt against Israel in Wall Street Journal news coverage since the October 7 Hamas attack on the Jewish state appears connected to a change in focus under a new Editor-in-Chief, Emma Tucker. The Journal now routinely terms all of the West Bank \"Palestinian territory\" -- an error previously corrected in the Journal's own pages.\n\nABC Invents: Netanyahu Has ‘So Far Rejected’ Biden’s Ceasefire Proposal\n\nThe flip side of widespread false reporting last May that Hamas accepted the ceasefire proposal on the table, ABC fabricates that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far rejected President Biden's plan.\n\nAP Cites ‘Military Action’ In Deadly School Strike, Ignores Errant Hamas Rockets\n\nThe Associated Press swerves and ducks the facts about lives cut short by Hamas — Palestinians sheltering in schools killed by errant Hamas rockets along with Israeli babies murdered on Oct. 7.\n\nThe Washington Post Attacks Victims of Hamas, Again\n\nThe Washington Post recently attacked the parents of Omer Neutra, an American-born IDF tank commander who was taken hostage on October 7th. But its not the first time that the failing newspaper has attacked victims of Hamas.\n\nHow AFP Is Disrupting the World of Information\n\nIsrael is the primary obstacle to Palestinian unity, reports AFP, ignoring that Hamas is a terror organization. From Gaza's civilian casualties and food shortages in the north to the Temple Mount's status in Judaism, the wire service fails to safeguard its charter calling for accuracy and impartiality.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Israel’s Message to Hezbollah\n\nIsrael has reportedly taken out a mid-level Hezbollah operative in Syria. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the strike is a message to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah: escalate at your own risk.\n\nHow Extremism is Being Exported from Ramallah to American Campuses\n\n“We find Harvard’s relationship with Birzeit University…to be extremely concerning,” reads a July 15 letter sent by nearly thirty members of Congress to Harvard University’s Interim President Alan Garber. Wait until Congress hears about Birzeit’s relationship with another Ivy League institution, Brown University.\n\nCNN Continues to Advocate for US Sanctions on Israel\n\nIn both televised and print reports, Katie Polglase advocates for sanctions on Israel. The televised segment also contained an echo of an ancient antisemitic stereotype.\n\nCNN Hides a Chief Terrorist\n\nFar too many of the network’s reporters are more interested in reporting a narrative of the conflict, rather than the reality.\n\nThe Bias of Meta’s Oversight Board\n\nThe Board’s questionable handling of the public engagement process over moderating the term \"shaheed\" does not inspire confidence that these issues are being fairly or fully considered. With upcoming Board recommendations on moderating the phrase “from the river to the sea” and how to handle the use of the term “Zionists” when compared to criminality, it is clear that the Board seeks to have an enormous influence on online expression relating to Israel and antisemitism. As antisemitism and anti-Israel extremism surge, this should be concerning to all.\n\nShape Online Conversations – Join Our Team!\n\nJoin our team as a Social Media Manager at the CAMERA Education Institute! We are looking for a dynamic and experienced professional to help shape online conversations and promote accurate information about the Middle East.\n\nTimes of Israel Corrects: Abdallah Aljamal, Who Held Israeli Hostages, Was Palestine Chronicle Correspondent\n\nTimes of Israel corrects after misidentifying Abdallah Aljamal, a Gaza resident who held three Israeli hostages, as a contributor at Palestine Chronicle. In fact, as correspondent, he had a more significant role at the U.S.-based pro-Hamas outlet.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The International Court of Justice Never Said That\n\nIn dozens of stories, AP committed one of the most egregious journalistic transgressions: misattributing a false quote to a source. Tamar Sternthal explains in Times of Israel how a bogus ICJ quote alleging “plausible risk of genocide” in Gaza found its way into AP reporting, and how CAMERA put an end to it.\n\nChristiane Amanpour Wants to Know, What Does Israel Fear From Palestine?\n\nThe CNN anchor invited propagandist Raja Shehadeh to her show, but he didn't honestly answer the question, instead engaging in the manipulative tactic of reversing victim and offender.\n\nLA Times Falsely Blames Home Sales in ‘Palestinian’ Land for Attacks on LA Jews\n\nThe Los Angeles Times has found a culprit for the violent attacks targeting Los Angeles Jews outside the Adas Torah Synagogue. And, no, it's not the pro-terror organization which organized the violent synagogue siege. UPDATE: LA Times corrects on 'Palestinian land,' legality of settlements.\n\nNY Times Hires Another Anti-Israel Extremist to Cover Israel\n\nTo help with its coverage of Israel, the New York Times has hired: someone who had praised Hitler; someone who denied Hamas has murdered Israeli civilians; someone who has said her objectivity about Israel was out the window; and now, Bora Erden, another committed anti-Israel activist.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Is Hezbollah Using Beirut Airport?\n\nA recent report cited unnamed sources who claimed that Hezbollah is using Beirut airport to store weapons. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner there’s a long history of Hezbollah using ports of entry to store weapons.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Israel at a Crossroads\n\nIsrael, Michael Horowitz argues in his new book, is at a crossroads. The Jewish state faces a mounting threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran yet it also enjoys warming relations with many Arab nations. As CAMERA tells the Washington Free Beacon, Horowitz makes excellent points but also omits key context.\n\nCNN (Sort Of) Corrects On Use Of 2,000 Pound Bomb\n\nAfter a vague \"clarification,\" the article is still misleading as to the frequency of the use of this weapon. Military expert John Spencer called it \"a very commonly used tool.\"\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Al Jazeera on the Potomac\n\nThe Washington Post is bleeding money and losing subscribers at an astonishing rate. The Post is turning to new leaders, and new programs, to recoup their losses. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner magazine, it is the newspaper's failure to abide by basic journalism standards that are the chief contributing factor.\n\nCNN Article Breathes False Life into the Gaza “Famine” Lie\n\nIs there an imminent famine in Gaza? How CNN has covered this story over the last four months is illuminating, but not in the sense of discovering the facts. Rather, CNN’s coverage illustrates how the network is leaving its audience both uninformed and misinformed.\n\nDiplomatic Controversies and Lazy ‘Journalism’ at CNN\n\nCNN authors found it sufficient to largely copy and paste from competing statements without adding any value. To call this lazy journalism isn’t entirely accurate, though. After all, we know that the network will work overtime to concoct bizarre “investigative” reporting riddled with holes, dubious claims, and thin evidence. The amount of effort devoted seems to depend on who the story makes look good or bad.\n\nMSNBC Mislabels Northern Israeli Communities ‘Settlements’\n\nOn MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Keir Simmons erroneously referred to locations which Hezbollah targeted within internationally-recognized Israeli territory as \"settlements.\" While MSNBC agreed the terminology was wrong, the network declined to broadcast a correction.\n\nHamas Gambled on Biased Western Journalism. CNN Played Right Into It.\n\nA Hamas leader admitted to deliberately engaging in war crimes as a matter of strategy and CNN’s Nic Robertson still made it instead about Israel being bad.\n\nUPI Corrects After Inflating UN Data on Palestinians Killed by Settlers\n\nCAMERA prompts correction after UPI falsely reported that United Nations said \"nearly 500\" West Bank Palestinians were killed in settler-related incidents since Oct. 7. In fact, the UN cited seven fatalities. McClatchy subsequently corrects on more than two dozen sites.\n\nScrubbed by the Times: NY Times Routinely Erases Extremism from “Pro-Palestinian Protests”\n\nFour times this week, the New York Times covered anti-Israel demonstrations and incidents. Each time, it concealed from readers vile extremism, death threats, support for Hamas and its Oct. 7 attacks, and violent assaults by those the paper characterizes as \"pro-Palestinian protesters.\"\n\nReuters Deletes Social Media Posts Citing ‘Tel Aviv’ As Shorthand for Israel\n\nIn response to communication from CAMERA's Jerusalem office, Reuters deletes posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook which erroneously used Tel Aviv as a metonyn for Israel.\n\nWhitewashing Red Triangles: AP Scrubs Pro-Hamas Graffiti\n\nEven as authorities from Sydney to Brooklyn were still investigating and removing pro-Hamas graffiti, the Associated Press engaged in scrubbing of a different sort.\n\nCAMERA Prompts NY Times to Amend Ceasefire Misrepresentation\n\nThe New York Times had erred on the basics of a ceasefire proposal. CAMERA's outreach prompted the paper to amend its language.\n\nThe University of Minnesota’s Cynical Holocaust Studies Hire\n\nThe University of Minnesota is set to hire, as its new director for the Center for Holocaust & Genocide Studies, an individual who would serve better as a case study on the persistence of genocidal antisemitism than as credible researcher of it.\n\n‘Blatant Lie’: Haaretz Adds IDF’s Response to Hamas Claim That Hostages Were Killed In Rescue Operation\n\nHaaretz had initially reported Hamas' unsubstantiated claim that Israeli hostages were killed during the successful June 8 rescue operation without noting the IDF denial.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Rise of Anti-Zionist Networks in the U.S.\n\nA recent New York Post report noted the anti-Israel activism of Theodore Roosevelt's great-great-great grandson. But as CAMERA tells the Algemeiner, it's all in the family. Roosevelt's grandchildren, both CIA officers, helped establish anti-Zionist networks in the U.S., and they used government funds to do so.\n\nArrested Truth: UPI Cites As Fact Disputed Figures For West Bank Arrests\n\nUPI reports as fact a Palestinian organization's dubious claim that nearly 9000 West Bank Palestinians have been arrested since Oct. 7, ignoring Israel's figure of less than half that number. Once again, McClatchy pulls Adam Schrader's deeply flawed article from all of its sites.\n\nCNN’s Advocacy Journalism\n\nCNN appears to be advocating for a further US arms embargo on Israel in a pair of articles masquerading as journalism.\n\nNY Times Misleads on Rafah Crossing and Rafah Ruling\n\nIsrael shut down the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt. So said the New York Times. No one of consequence denies the World Court called for an end to Israeli military operations in Rafah. So argued the New York Times. In both cases, the news was false — as reporting even in the New York Times would eventually make clear.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The United Nations Helps Hamas\n\nThe United Nations is a key component in Hamas's war to destroy the Jewish state. And as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the UN provides cover for the terrorist group. The press should not grant the UN undue credibility.\n\nAl Hurra Clarifies About Hamas’ False Claim To Accept Ceasefire\n\nAfter Al Hurra repeatedly reported as fact Hamas' claim that it accepted a ceasefire proposal, CAMERA prompts the publicly-funded American Arabic-language network to add the State Department's unequivocal response: \"Hamas did not accept a ceasefire proposal.\"\n\nThe Washington Post Makes Hamas Claims Appear and Disappear\n\nThe Washington Post continues to uncritically regurgitate claims from Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group. This has led to numerous embarrassing moments. Recently, the newspaper chose to delete an entire story that was entirely based on Hamas sources\n\nTimes of Israel Corrects AP’s Tel Aviv Metonym for Israel\n\nUPDATE: In response to communication from CAMERA, both TIME and Times of Israel correct Associated Press copy which erroneously cited Tel Aviv as shorthand for Israel. Both media outlets now correctly refer to Jerusalem as Israel's capital.\n\nFifty-Two UN “Experts” and Seven Major Lies\n\nFifty-two UN experts either didn’t bother to fact check their own statement or had no qualms about spreading lies about the Jewish state in order to accuse it of all manner of evils.\n\nHaaretz Corrects: Israeli Airstrike Did Not Hit Rafah Encampment\n\nIn this second correction of an English-language mistranslation this week, Haaretz clarifies in print and online that an Israeli airstrike did not hit the Rafah tent encampment where secondary explosions started a deadly fire.\n\nCAMERA Op-ED: Agenda-Free? Bias-Free? AP’s Journalism Deserves Scrutiny\n\nFrom citing unreliable casualty figures to implicitly adopting the Hamas narrative, the news agency has shown an anti-Israel slant, CAMERA's Tamar Sternthal writes in Times of Israel.\n\n‘Gaza Strikes Back’: UPI Hits Rock Bottom\n\n\"Gaza strikes back at Israel after enduring months of war\" was the United Press International headline whose relationship to reality mirrors that of George Lucas' \"The Empire Strikes Back\" science fiction favorite.\n\nHaaretz Corrects After Reporting That Israel (Not Egypt) Closed Rafah Crossing\n\nCAMERA prompts correction after Haaretz erroneously reported in English (and not Hebrew) that Israel closed the Rafah Crossing. Egypt, not Israel, closed the Gaza-Egypt crossing.\n\nFact Checking the ICJ: An Order Based in Omissions and Deceptions\n\nIn its May 24 order, the International Court of Justice relied on a handful of dubious, generalized and misleading claims made by various United Nations figures.\n\nIraq 2003 and Gaza 2023\n\nJournalists have often contrasted the fighting in Gaza with the American fighting in Iraq. They have often done so misleadingly. We take a closer look.\n\nCNN Promotes One-Sided “Nakba” Narrative and Repeats False Claim It Has Already Corrected Three Times\n\nCNN has corrected the false claim that, “the International Court of Justice says it’s ‘plausible’ Israel is committing genocide” in Gaza three times already, yet a May 15 article repeats it again.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Raisi’s Death Won’t Change Much\n\nAs CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the recent death of Ebrahim Raisi, the president of Iran, in a helicopter crash won’t change much. In the Islamic Republic, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say, and men like Raisi are but his servants. The regime and its ambitions—to destroy Israel and remove the U.S. from the Middle East—will live on.\n\nAP Mum on Egypt’s Closure of Crossing, Faulting Israel For Rafah Food Shortages\n\nAP conceals that Egypt refuses to coordinate with Israel on the transfer of aid, thereby preventing the passage of food through Rafah crossing into the Gaza Strip. By falsely holding Israel responsible for the reported food shortage, AP piles on to the tampered evidence upon which the ICC has built its whole rotten case.\n\n“From the River to the Sea” – CAMERA Weighs in on Meta Moderation Policy\n\nThe text of CAMERA’s submission to the Meta Oversight Board regarding content moderation policies and the use of the phrase “from the river to the sea.”\n\nLos Angeles Times Clarifies: US, Israel Dispute Hamas Claim to Accept Ceasefire\n\nCAMERA prompts correction of a Los Angeles Times article which inaccurately reported that \"Hamas had accepted terms of a cease-fire.\" As the U.S. State Department made explicitly clear: \"Hamas did not accept a ceasefire proposal.\"\n\nThe Washington Post Reanimates Antisemitism\n\nThe Washington Post is gaining quite the reputation. Once known for bringing down Presidents, the newspaper has been reduced to repeating Muslim Brotherhood-talking points.\n\nNPR Promotes Palestinian Myths to Delegitimize the Jewish State\n\nA segment of \"Here & Now,\" produced by NPR affiliate WBUR was devoted entirely to promoting the concept of “Nakba”— “catastrophe”— to describe the establishment of the modern State of Israel. With both host and guest promoting Palestinian foundational myths to delegitimize the Jewish state, the segment sounded more like propaganda on Voice of Al Aqsa, a Hamas radio station, than a report from a U.S. public radio network that claims to adhere to journalistic norms.\n\nICC Prosecutor Seeks to Effectively Rob Israel of its Legitimate Right to Self-Defense\n\nMilitary experts have attested that Israel is taking every possible step to avoid harm to civilians, while conducting a legitimate and necessary war of self-defense. To characterize this as “extermination” or “murder,” and to use it to justify international legal action against Israel's leaders, is to twist morality on its head.\n\nReuters Inflates By Millions 1948 Refugees Who Fled to Jordan\n\nReuters errs that \"Jordan took in millions of Palestinian refugees\" following the 1948 war. But the total number of Palestinian Arab refugees from that war was 700,000, and only about half of them went to Jordan.\n\nHamas Flag Shows Up On NYC Street, But Not in AFP Caption\n\nUPDATE: CAMERA prompts corrections of AFP and Getty photograph captions which whitewashed a New York City demonstrator waving a Hamas flag and sporting a Hamas headband as a \"[p]ro-Palestinian\" demonstrator. The corrected captions make his Hamas affiliation clear.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Leaving Hamas in Rafah Saves the Terrorist Group\n\nAs CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, Hamas can’t be eliminated unless the IDF launches an operation in Rafah. While some in the U.S. have questioned the wisdom of such a move, allowing Hamas to remain in Rafah effectively preserves the terrorist group.\n\n‘Nakba’ in a Vacuum: AP Covers 1948 ‘Mass Expulsion,’ Erases Arab War of Annihilation\n\nAP's selective coverage of the 'Nakba,' the defining event of the Palestinian national struggle, embodies the core fault of international media coverage: erasing Palestinian agency. AP accounts ignore the Arab war to eliminate the nascent Jewish state.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Iran’s Unprecedented Attack on Israel\n\nAs CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, Iran’s recent barrage of missiles and drones launched from Iranian soil is unprecedented. The attack marks a significant, and noteworthy, escalation by the Islamic Republic. Failing to respond would hurt Israel’s deterrence—and America’s.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Iran Wants to Destroy Israel\n\nAs CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, Israel is not purely at war in Gaza against Hamas. Rather it is at war with the Iranian regime — a war in which Tehran struck a devastating blow.\n\nAFP Amends After Reporting Israeli Participation Clouded Whole Eurovision\n\nCAMERA prompts AFP to amend after reporting the \"whole [Eurovision] contest has been clouded by the participation of Israel.\" It's not Israel which clouded Eurovision. It's the haters of Israel who did so.\n\nBlind Acceptance: Media Outlets Take Hamas’ Lying Word On Ceasefire Approval\n\nMedia outlets uncritically reported as fact Hamas' false claim that the terror organization accepted the Gaza ceasefire proposal, completely ignoring the State Department's unequivocal clarification: \"Hamas did not accept a ceasefire proposal.\"\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Anti-Israel Ideology Tarnishes Brown University\n\nBrown University's contribution to a growing trend of antisemitic views among young Americans is notable, not only for the extremist ideology promoted on campus by its Center for Middle East Studies but also because it aims to shape even younger minds through its Choices Program, a social-studies curriculum for high schoolers that includes units informed by the same radical ideology.\n\nUPI Belatedly Acknowledges: Hamas Attacked Kerem Shalom Crossing\n\nTwo days after UPI’s Adam Schrader completely ignored that Hamas fired rockets towards Kerem Shalom even as he blamed Israel exclusively for the humanitarian crises facing Gazans, CAMERA prompts the news agency to cover the terror organization’s deadly attack on the crossing for the first time.\n\nNPR’s Pro-Hamas, Anti-Israel Narrative Part II: Producer\n\nThis is the second of two articles describing how NPR has skewed its coverage of the Hamas-Israel war toward a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel narrative.\n\nNPR’s Pro-Hamas, Anti-Israel Narrative Part I: Citations and Interviewees\n\nThis is the first of two articles describing how NPR has skewed its coverage of the Hamas-Israel war toward a pro-Hamas, anti-Israel narrative.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Brown University Sends a Message that Extremism Works\n\nAs American universities are aflame with extremism, antisemitism, and lawlessness, universities have only themselves to blame for the decades-long promotion of faculty members who abuse their role to indoctrinate students in “resistance”. By rewarding bad behavior over respectful dialogue, they are sowing the seeds of yet more chaos and lawlessness.\n\nThese News Outlets Spread the “Plausible Genocide” Libel\n\nWhen the International Court of Justice issued an order on January 26 in the “genocide” case between South Africa and Israel, it soon became common knowledge that the ICJ had found it “plausible” that Israel was committing “genocide.” This common knowledge, however, was in fact a myth.\n\nTuvia Grossman Redux: Reuters’ Miscoverage and the Attack on Yoseph Haddad at Columbia University\n\nThe story which played out last week in Morningside Heights bore an uncanny resemblance to an unforgettable bloody incident which transpired Sept. 29, 2000 in Jerusalem at the outbreak of the Second Intifada. It’s far from clear that journalists have gleaned the necessary lessons from the misreporting of Tuvia Grossman’s ordeal.\n\nWith Additional WSJ Distortions, List of Manipulated Statistics Grows\n\nIt’s one thing to compare Israel’s invasion of Gaza in its battle to upend the Hamas regime with the US invasion of Iraq as it fought to overthrow Saddam Hussein. It is another to pretend to do so.\n\nCNN Article Errs and Misleads on Gaza Humanitarian Aid\n\nA CNN graphic, and the preceding text, suggests that the daily average number of trucks bringing food into Gaza now is less than half of what it was before October 7. In fact, the truth is precisely the opposite. Substantially more trucks are bringing food into Gaza today than were a year ago.\n\nCNN’s Latest Wild Accusation: Israel Imposing a “Blockade on Aid”\n\nIn the world of journalism, there are understandable errors, and then there are the types of errors that make you wonder whether the journalists are living in the same reality.\n\nTucker Carlson’s assault on American Christian support for Israel\n\nUnder the guise of advocating for Palestinian Christians, Tucker Carlson launched a two-pronged assault on American Christian support for the Jewish State. To provide legitimacy for his campaign, he enlisted the help of Rev. Dr. Munther Isaac, a notorious propagandist for the Palestinian anti-Israel narrative.\n\nABC’s This Week Amplifies Virulently Antisemitic Slur, Rolling Stone Piles On\n\nWhen the World Central Kitchen founder said that Israel is at “war against humanity itself,” both ABC and Rolling Stone thought that repetition of this dehumanizing trope would make a good headline.\n\nUnparalleled Intelligence: UPI Claims To Know More Than U.S. on Damascus Strike\n\nWhile U.S. intelligence has yet to determine whether a building attacked in Damascus is an Iranian consular facility, UPI's Adam Schrader knows: Israel \"destroyed Iran's consulate in Damascus.\" McClatchy commendably pulled the story from two dozens sites.\n\nAfter Charging That Israel Launched War, Reuters ‘Adds Context’ of Hamas’ Oct. 7 Invasion\n\nReuters \"adds context\" about Hamas' massive Oct. 7 attacks to a Facebook post which cites \"the war Israel launched against Hamas.\" While the inclusion of Hamas' Oct. 7 atrocities is certainly a significant improvement, it should be noted that Israel didn’t “launch” a war, Hamas did.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Hamas Uses Hospitals and the Washington Post\n\nHamas is using hospitals for cover. And the media is covering for Hamas. Worse still, as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, a contributor for the Washington Post even cheered on the October 7th massacre.\n\nReuters Clarifies: Israel Wasn’t Alone in Blaming Iran For Bombing of Argentine Jewish Center\n\nCAMERA prompts corrections in both English and Arabic after Reuters misleadingly reported that Israel alone blames Iran for the 1994 bombing of the Buenos Aires Jewish center in which 85 were murdered. The United States and Argentina also blame Iran.\n\nAFP Corrects: Abraham Accords Didn’t Permit Israel Annexation of West Bank Land\n\nCAMERA prompts correction of an English-language AFP article which falsely reported that the Abraham Accords permitted Israeli annexation of West Bank land. In fact, the accords achieved normalization between Israel and Arab states and removed annexation from the agenda.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: What the Damascus Strike Tells Us\n\nIsrael allegedly struck a building next to a consulate in Damascus. The strike took out top operatives from Iran's IRGC. And as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the strike tells us much about the current state of play in the Middle East.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: CAMERA Highlights Evacuation of Israeli Civilians\n\nThousands of Israeli civilians have been evacuated since Hamas and other Iranian proxies initiated a genocidal war against the Jewish state. As CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, the current situation is unsustainable and, to the north, a potential war with fellow proxy Hezbollah looms.\n\nThe Rape Deniers\n\nWhere there are anti-Jewish atrocities, there are deniers. And on Oct 7, there were atrocities. Countless acts of murder and mutilation — and brutal acts of sexual violence by the Palestinian attackers. Cue the deniers and their manipulations.\n\nCAMERA Letter in the Washington Times: US Action at UN Breaks Tradition\n\nA recent decision by the US to abstain on a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire is a break with tradition. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times: there was a ceasefire, and Hamas broke it.\n\n‘Lebanese Sunni Muslim Group’: AP Captions Extend PR First Aid To Jema’a Islamiya Terrorists\n\nAssociated Press photo captions depict a south Lebanese site hit in an Israeli airstrike as nothing more than a civilian paramedical center, concealing that Jema'a Islamiya is a designated terror group.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Gaza, the Day After\n\nMilitarily, Israel's war against Hamas and other Gaza-based proxies is going well. Indeed, the IDF has made remarkable gains. But diplomatically and politically, the post-war phase will present Israel with numerous challenges, as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner.\n\nWashington Post Contributor Celebrates Oct. 7 Massacre\n\nThe Washington Post contributor mocked kidnapped children and grandmothers.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The UN Vote to Save Hamas\n\nEfforts are underway to save Hamas. Unsurprisingly, such efforts include the UN. Sadly, a recent US decision at the United Nations does more harm than good.\n\nBuckle Up: NPR Takes Listeners For A Ride 30,000 Trucks Long\n\nTruckers are accustomed to very long journeys, but what about a line of 30,000 vehicles waiting for months on end to pass inspections and cross a border? If that sounds like beyond the realm of reason, it's because it is. Introducing Jane Arraf's tall tale of the wide loads.\n\nUPI Lies About U.N. Data, Promotes Blood Libel That Jewish Settlers Killed Nearly 200\n\nUPI's Adam Schrader falsely reports that according to UN data, Israeli settlers are responsible for most of the 199 Palestinians killed in the West Bank from Jan. 1 to Oct. 6 of last year. In fact, UN data shows seven Palestinians were killed in incidents involving settlers. In virtually all of the cases, the Palestinian fatalities were perpetrators attacking Israelis.\n\nAP Loses Way in Shifa Tunnels: Drops U.S. Intelligence Findings Confirming Hamas Command Center\n\nWhere is AP's vaunted transparency when it comes to the independent U.S. intelligence about the Hamas command center? Like a Hamas weapons cache hidden away in Shifa's MRI ward, deliberate and deceptive concealment ironically finds a home in a place of supposedly total transparency.\n\nCAMERA Education Institute Statement on Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) Webinar\n\nThe Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) union has once again engaged in the demonization and delegitimization of Israel with its recent webinar.\n\nPRESS ADVISORY: Questions about U.S. Draft U.N. Resolution for Gaza Ceasefire\n\nOf significant concern, while a ceasefire is deemed “imperative,” the release of the hostages is not.\n\nPolitico Punch-Card Cartoon Absurdly Suggests Israel Gets a “Free Pass”\n\nThe cartoon doesn’t go as far as Holocaust inversion, but it is related to that phenomenon in that it uses the Holocaust “as a stick to beat” Israel.\n\nTrue and False Media Coverage of the Gaza War\n\nMedia coverage of the Gaza war has too much in common with the tactics of a dishonest used car salesman. What's being sold?\n\nAP Casts Bigoted Demand That American Jew Remove Kippa As Saudi ‘Sensitivity’\n\nFalling into an antisemitic trope, AP fails to amend after whitewashing the Saudi anti-Jewish bigotry hurled at American Rabbi Abraham Cooper, chair of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, as \"sensitivity\" due to Israel's war against Hamas.\n\nOctober Rockets: Reuters Makes Hezbollah Attacks A Thing of the Past\n\nReuters misleadingly reported March 13 that \"Hezbollah launched rockets at Israel in October in support of Hamas,\" as if the terror organization's incessant attacks hadn't continued up until that very same morning.\n\nThe Media Aids Hamas\n\nIsrael has been assailed for not getting aid to Gazans. Policymakers have picked up on this narrative, pushed by the mainstream press. But as CAMERA notes, it is deeply misleading.\n\nCamera prompts correction on Gaza casualties from Daily Mail\n\nThe British outlet erroneously characterized all casualties as \"civilians.\" At last count, there are 13,000 dead Hamas combatants.\n\n‘The Latest’? AP’s Fealty Vs. Footdragging Reporting Fatality Stats from Hamas, Israel\n\nNearly every day, AP religiously recounts with muezzin-like regularity Hamas' latest figures for Palestinian casaulties. Meanwhile, the news agency delays and discredits when it comes to IDF-supplied data on Hamas fatalities. Sometimes updates happen only after CAMERA's nudging, resulting in underreporting of Hamas fatalities.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Hezbollah’s Control of Lebanon\n\nThe press has failed to fully note the extent to which Hezbollah controls Lebanon. Indeed, as CAMERA tells Providence Magazine, the Lebanese Armed Forces have been caught cooperating with the terror group. This bodes poorly for the next Israel-Hezbollah War.\n\n20 McClatchy Sites Delete False Story About NJ Synagogue ‘Sale’ of ‘Palestinian Land’\n\nCAMERA prompts the removal of a false story by UPI's Adam Schrader from more than 20 McClatchy news sites two days after UPI itself had commendably corrected the fallacious report that a New Jersey synagogue was selling 'Palestinian land' against the backdrop of so-called 'genocide.'\n\nDissecting CNN’s Allegation of an Atrocity by Israel\n\nIf CNN can’t be relied upon to produce an accurate picture of the facts, or to give the proper analysis of those facts, then can CNN be relied upon as a serious journalistic entity at all?\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Uses Palestinian Babies as Anti-Israel Props, Again\n\nThere they go again. The Washington Post can't quit using Palestinian babies as props in their propaganda war against Israel. A recent Post news story blaming Israel for dangers faced by Palestinian babies leaving Gaza didn't even mention Hamas.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Linking Israel’s 2014 War Against Hamas to Today\n\nCAMERA reviews a new memoir by Ari Harow, Netanyahu's former chief of staff, for the Washington Free Beacon and finds that Israel's war against Hamas in the summer of 2014 foreshadowed tactics that the terrorist group would employ in its war on the Jewish state in 2023-24.\n\nCBS’ Imtiaz Tyab Reports As Fact Disputed Hamas Claims on Aid Distribution Deaths\n\nImtiaz Tyab repeatedly treats unverified, disputed allegations from the designated terror organziation at face value, stating as fact that Israeli gunfire killed 115 Palestinians collecting food aid.\n\nForeign Affairs Gets Lost in the Middle East\n\nForeign Affairs magazine has an illustrious history. For more than a century, the publication has published groundbreaking essays that have define foreign policy debates in both Washington and the world. But the magazine's recent Middle East coverage is replete with omissions and anti-Israel bias.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Israel Helps America’s Defense Industrial Base\n\nIsrael, CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, is key to America's defense industrial base, creating jobs for Americans. But a recent move to reshore munitions manufacturing can also benefit the United States.\n\nAt NY Times, Subtle Skew Hides Amid the Big Blunders\n\nYou know of the flagrant falsehoods. But day in and day out, subtle messages further skew New York Times coverage.\n\nNPR’s Jane Arraf Blames ‘Israeli Attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque’ For Iraqi Militia Violence\n\nIn an article that is part of NPR's \"Middle East crisis — explained\" special series, Jane Arraf cites non-existing \"Israeli attacks on the Al-Aqsa mosque\" as fueling Iraqi militia violence targeting U.S. troops.\n\nLA Times Refuses To Substantiate, Retract Toxic Charge that IDF Snipers Targeted Kids\n\nThat The Los Angeles Times cannot or will not substantiate a toxic charge redolent of an age-old bigoted trope demonizing Jews as child killers is particularly troubling in this period of unprecedented antisemitism.\n\nCNN Reporting: Conflicts of Interest, A Missing Terrorist Organization, And an Inability to Verify\n\nFirst, the article spills large amounts of ink to link Israel to tragedies, while omitting or glossing over the existence and responsibility of other parties. Second, the article employs a curious double standard as to informing readers of when the network was “unable to verify” details being reported. Third, the background of one of the journalists himself raises questions of a conflict of interest.\n\nReinstated US Position on Settlements Revives Long-Standing Misreporting on Decades-Old Policy\n\nWhile the Biden Administration's decision to consider settlements illegal under international law in no way restores a decades-long U.S. policy, media reports that it does just that do revive long-standing miscoverage of U.S. policy.\n\nTracing the Dubious Allegations of Sexual Violence Made Against Israeli Forces\n\nThe only source for the allegations of sexual violence by Israeli forces that several United Nations \"experts\" were willing to point to was a public report by an organization called Women's Centre for Legal Aid and Counseling (WCLAC). Given that this is all the public has to go on to scrutinize the allegations, it is worth examining WCLAC’s report.\n\nOnce Again, CNN Gives an Antisemite a Propaganda Platform\n\nCNN bewilderingly decided to amplify an antisemite’s horrific allegations against the Jewish state, notwithstanding they lacked any supporting evidence, and without mentioning her extraordinary bias on the subject.\n\nAt UPI, Hang Glider Journalist Adam Schrader Shills For Hamas\n\nCouch journalist Adam Schrader branches into a new speciality: hang glider journalism, or shilling for Hamas post-Oct. 7, 2023. Swooping in with great conviction and few facts, the international breaking news editor whitewashes and justifies Hamas' heinous atrocities.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Covers for UNRWA, Again\n\nCompelling evidence has emerged indicating that UNRWA employees took part in the October 7 massacre. As CAMERA tells the Algemeiner, this is part of a long-standing pattern at the UN agency. The Washington Post, however, ignores the long history, and sordid mission, of UNRWA.\n\nAnother CNN Report on Gaza Based on Little Evidence, No Context, But Lots of Insinuation\n\nAs CAMERA has repeatedly documented, there is a pattern of CNN reports lobbing horrific allegations at Israel based on exceedingly thin evidence and lots of insinuation. It’s a standard, or practice, akin to tabloid journalism – a standard certainly not appropriate for serious journalism or serious accusations like that of war crimes.\n\nNY Times Entombs Criticism of UNRWA\n\nBuried 18 meters under a United Nations headquarters in the Gaza Strip is a Hamas tunnel and data center, Israeli army engineers announced on Saturday. That’s also how deep, in paragraphs, the New York Times buried news of the discovery.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Isn’t Sure Hamas Engaged in Mass Rape\n\nIt is a well documented fact that Hamas committed acts of sexual violence on October 7. But in the latest example of its fall from journalistic grace, the Washington Post raises doubts that such evil acts occurred. As CAMERA tells JNS, this is to the Post's eternal shame.\n\nCBS Falsely Reports U.S. Warned Israel Not To Attack Rafah\n\nCBS's Deborah Patta falsely reported that Netanyahu \"stubbornly refuses to listen\" to his American interlocutors. But the Israeli Prime Minister's order to devise an evacuation plan for Rafah's civilians means that he listened very attentively. The U.S. exhorted Israel to prepare a solid plan to protect Rafah's civilians before carrying out a military operation. The Biden administration did not tell Israel not to attack Rafah.\n\nThe State of Palestinians: AP Errs on Oslo Accords, Strips Palestinians Of Agency\n\nAP's Julia Frankel falsely reports that under the intermin peace deals, \"the self-rule government was meant to expand and eventually run a future Palestinian state.\" In Frankel's telling, the still stateless Palestinians have no responsibility for their current state of affairs, including West Bank economic hardship born of Hamas' Oct. 7 atrocities.\n\nReuters Reporting Goes South, Falsely Claims Israel Ordered Palestinians in Rafah to Evacuate Southward\n\nUPDATE: Reuters corrects a video which falsely reported that Israel has ordered the evacuation of over one million Palestinians in Rafah southward. Any evacuation of Palestinians in Rafah further south would mean evacuation into Egypt, and Israel has absolutely not ordered the evacuation of Palestinians onto Egyptian territory.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: UNRWA’s Problematic History\n\nOn October 7, UN employees helped perpetrate the largest massacre of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Times this revelation is as unsurprising as it is infuriating. UNRWA is part of the problem, not the solution.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Does UNRWA Deserve a Role in Rebuilding Gaza?\n\nEmployees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency took part in the October 7 massacre. This revelation came the day after the U.S. State Department suggested that UNRWA should play a role in rebuilding Gaza. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner UNRWA should be persona non grata.\n\nNPR Covers Up U.S. Intelligence on Hamas Command Center at Shifa Hospital\n\nNational Public Radio, whose founding mission is \"to create a more informed public,\" for months has kept from its 44 million weekly listeners the U.S. intelligence assessment that Hamas did indeed operate a command center in Gaza City's Shifa Hospital.\n\nKhaled Gharabli’s Apparent Departure Is A Step in the Right Direction For France24 Arabic\n\nKhaled Gharabli, the international affairs analyst notorious for routinely misplacing all semblance of impartiality and accuracy when it comes to Israel, has been notably absent from the French public broadcaster for the last two months, It is still early, though, to talk about a true wind of change at France 24’s Arabic service.\n\nAFP Corrects On 1948 Palestinian Refugees\n\nCAMERA prompts correction of an English-language AFP article which erroneously reported that all of the Palestinian refugees from 1948 were forcibly displaced from their homes. In fact, the vast majority fled, often at the urging of their own leaders.\n\nThe Hill Declining: Rising’s Jessica Burbank & The Peace-Loving Houthis\n\nAccording to Jessica Burbank, the Houthis are peace activists targeting ships bringing weapons to Israel, some 23 percent of Gaza's young women have been sexually assaulted by IDF soldiers, Hamas doesn't operate in the West Bank and US intelligence agencies are wrong about Hamas' command center in Shifa hospital.\n\nCAMERA’s Impact Upsets The Intercept\n\nIt's one part defense of Hamas, one part rant against CAMERA, and one part insinuation that an editor’s late father pulls the New York Times strings from beyond the grave. But thank you, The Intercept, for recognizing our successes.\n\nTabloid Journalism at CNN: “Palestinians are eating grass”\n\nTo make such an eye-popping claim in the headline based solely on one man’s hearsay is irresponsible journalism. It comes across as either clickbait or an effort to advance a partisan narrative.\n\nCAMERA Letter in the Washington Times: Iran is Driving Instability\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is driving instability in the Middle East. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the Iranian regime is the leading state sponsor of terrorism and seeks to remake the Middle East.\n\nCNN Errs on UNRWA’s Refugee Definition, Downplays Scandals\n\nGiven CNN’s fondness for investigations, one is left to wonder: why isn’t CNN devoting any substantial effort to holding UNRWA to account by asking the hard questions of the agency?\n\nMSNBC: Four Months of Disinformation\n\nCommon distortions include omitting the 2005 disengagement from Gaza and the subsequent election of a group sworn to Israel's destruction to power in the territory, promoting anti-Israel propagandists, and ignoring the numbers of casualties that are reported to be Hamas fighters. In addition, at least two commentators called on the US to force Israel essentially to surrender.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Gives a Pass to Antisemitic Institutions\n\nThe Washington Post is failing to shine a light on institutions that are propagating antisemitism, a virus that has resulted in the murder of millions in living memory. The newspaper is failing to provide adequate coverage of the ICRC and UNRWA, CAMERA tells the Algemeiner.\n\nHaaretz Clarifies: Gunmen Who Killed East Jerusalem Arabs Were Palestinians\n\nHaaretz's English edition amends an article which had failed to identify Palestinian gunmen as responsible for the fatal West Bank shootings of east Jerusalem Arabs, leaving readers to wrongly assume that Israeli settlers were the culprits.\n\nMedia Outlets Correct Yoav Gallant Misquote on Eliminating Hamas\n\nFollowing last week's New York Times correction of Megan Stack's Op-Ed falsely quoting Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant calling for the annihilation of the Gaza Strip, CAMERA has prompted additional corrections at NPR, Salt Lake Tribune and The Telegraph (London).\n\nBrown University’s Middle East Studies Faculty: Profiles in Extremist Anti-Israel Bias\n\nA non-exhaustive list of anti-Israel and antisemitic public rhetoric from many of the faculty members at Brown University's Center for Middle East Studies. The rhetoric shown helps demonstrate the level of bias and hostility toward the Jewish state.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Parrots Hamas\n\nThe Washington Post has a favorite source: Hamas. As CAMERA tells JNS, the newspaper is determined to parrot the terrorist group's propaganda.\n\nNew York Times Erases Hostages From Soccer Player’s Gesture, Calls It a War Message\n\nOn January 14, communities across the globe marked 100 days since Israeli hostages were abducted to Gaza. When an Israeli soccer player in Turkey was arrested for doing the same, the New York Times cast it as a martial reference, and refused to correct their misrepresentation.\n\nNBC Report on Escalating West Bank Violence Conceals Palestinian Violence\n\nNBC's Richard Engel conceals that slain teen Taha Mahmeed was a Hamas member who was engaged in clashes with Israeli troops and neglects to report the existence of an explosives lab and weapons cache.\n\nBloomberg Deletes Incendiary ‘Israel Genocide’ Headline\n\nIn response to communication from CAMERA, Bloomberg commendably moves swiftly to remove an incendiary News Now podcast headline referring to \"Israel Genocide.\"\n\nLawfare Blog Won’t Correct Garlasco’s Gaza Errors\n\nAlthough Lawfare’s Editor in Chief Benjamin Wittes and Managing Editor Tyler McBrien were informed of errors and distortions in a piece by Marc Garlasco, they remain uncorrected.\n\nSnip, Snip: AP Cleans Up Slain Hamas Member Osaid Rimawi\n\nAP runs more than 1200 words on the Israeli military's allegedly unprovoked fatal shooting of Osaid Rimawi, \"a high school student studying to become a barber,\" never once mentioning that he was a Hamas member.\n\nCNN’s Investigations: Biased Expert Analysis\n\nExpert analysis, when used properly, can help audiences contextualize factual reporting. But when used improperly, it can mislead audiences by exaggerating or downplaying certain details to fit into a preconceived narrative. Repeatedly, CNN’s investigations have fallen into the latter category by portraying demonstrably biased “experts” as neutral sources.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Messages Behind Israel’s Beirut Strike\n\nAn Israeli strike in Beirut took out top Hamas operatives, including Saleh Al-Arouri. CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner that the strike is about more than eliminating a top Hamas commander, it is also about sending a message to terrorists: those responsible for October 7th will be held accountable.\n\nHaaretz Corrects False Report Claiming Netanyahu Weighing Deportation of Gaza Residents\n\nHaaretz amends after falsely reporting that Netanyahu's statements about the possibility of deporting Hamas leadership applied to Gaza residents, a fallacious claim which provided tailwind to South Africa's unfounded genocide charge.\n\nAre protests on college campuses “independent of the Hamas party line”?\n\nWriting in The Atlantic, Graeme Wood claims that they are.\n\nCNN’s Investigations: Glossing Over Questions of Credibility\n\nA consistent concern with CNN investigations is their habit of misleading the audience about the reliability of the evidence presented.\n\nThe Washington Post Reprints Antisemitic Blood Libel\n\nA Hamas press release has accused Israel of harvesting the organs of dead Palestinians. A Washington Post reprint of the Hamas statement tells readers that ‘the claims could not be independently verified.’\n\nCNN’s Investigations: Omitting Exculpatory Information\n\nGood investigative journalism is journalism at its best. Unfortunately, that kind of good journalism is rare at CNN. Rather than producing impartial, professional investigations, many of the network’s journalists are acting as one-sided prosecutors when it comes to Israel.\n\nAFP Posthumously Demotes Hamas Commanders to Bodyguards\n\nAFP improves coverage after initially demoting terror commanders killed alongside Salah Al-Arouri to \"bodyguards\" and omitting the Hamas deputy's second claim to infamy: founding the terror organization's military wing.\n\nReuters’ Rough Reporting on Gaza Aid, Philadelphi Route, ‘Palestine’ Statehood\n\nReuters closes the curtain on 2023 with rough reporting on aid to the Gaza Strip, the implications of Israeli control over the narrow Philadelphi corridor border area, and \"Palestine\" statehood.\n\nCAMERA’s 2023 Highlights: A Year of Impact and Advocacy\n\nDiscover the remarkable achievements of CAMERA in 2023, from setting records in global media corrections to spearheading influential campaigns and educational initiatives.\n\nMore Hamas Advocacy on PBS NewsHour\n\nAs a recipient of federal funding, PBS must comply with the federal statute requiring strict adherence to objectivity and balance in programs of a controversial nature. Yet PBS Newshour continues to present one-sided segments with guests who shill for Hamas.\n\nHow the AP (and WaPo and NY Times) Lie with Statistics\n\nWith the Associated Press claim that Israel's war against Hamas “now sits among the deadliest and most destructive in history,” the wire service joins a parade of statistical inventions and manipulations.\n\nCNN Weekend Roundup, 12/22-12/25: Misinformation for Christmas\n\nChristmas is a time for religious and family traditions. At CNN this weekend, the traditions included appropriating Jesus to besmirch the Jewish state and erasing the existence of Palestinian violence and Israeli victims.\n\nHillary Clinton Sets the Israel-Gaza Record Straight on The View\n\nAppearing on The View, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton debunks the anti-Israel narrative that has become commonplace in much of the media and a sizeable portion of the population in the US and Europe, often citing what she personally witnessed in office.\n\nNPR Complicit in UNRWA Underreporting of Aid Trucks\n\nNow that Israel has opened the Kerem Shalom crossing, UNRWA's Phillippe Lazzarini underreports the amount of aid passing through and ignores a new route for Jordanian aid. NPR's Mary Louise Kelly collegially plays along, repeatedly \"correcting\" President Herzog.\n\nVice Arabia: Hamas’ Oct. 7 Massacre Legitimate Under International Law\n\nA Vice Arabia \"explainer\" by Badar Salem falsely legitimizes Hamas' Oct. 7 atrocities as legal under international law. Vice defends the fallacious and dangerous \"explainer\" as \"opinion,\" though it's not labeled as such.\n\nCAMERA’s Alex Safian appears on Mark Levin’s Life, Liberty and Levin\n\nCAMERA’s Alex Safian joined Mark Levin on his top-rated FoxNews program Life, Liberty and Levin to discuss the abysmal media coverage of Israel’s war against Hamas, which was triggered by the terrorist organization’s horrific massacre of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7.\n\nCAMERA Report: Brown University’s Choices Curriculum is a Platform for Anti-Zionist Narrative\n\nCAMERA has just published its investigation of the Choices Program's curriculum pertaining to Zionism, Israel and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Replete with historical revisionism and anti-Zionist tropes ,it whitewashes Palestinian aggression and terrorism, erases Hamas’ stated goals and genocidal intent and portrays the existence of the Jewish state as illegitimate. Such a curriculum can only fuel the growing antisemitism in U.S. classrooms.\n\nJewish Students Were Besieged. The NY Times Casts the Besiegers as Victims.\n\nTwo months anti-Israel protesters intimidated Jews in the Cooper Union library, the New York Times again reported on the disturbance — this time, to recast the agitators who caused Jews to fear for their safety as the situation’s real victims.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Harvard excludes rather than includes the Jews\n\nDespite hiring so many presumably brilliant minds and sinking millions into addressing the issue of diversity, equity and inclusion, the best answer to antisemitism the university could come up with was “hide the Jews.”\n\nA CNN Article Tries to Explain Away Palestinian Support for Hamas’s Atrocities\n\nTwo CNN reporters spin the disturbing results showing widespread Palestinian support for the October 7 attack by Palestinian terrorist organizations by suggesting support for the attack doesn’t actually mean they support the atrocities that characterized the attack. This isn't journalism. This is damage control.\n\nHamas Propaganda by Doctors Without Borders, Courtesy of PBS Newshour\n\nPBS is peddling Hamas propaganda via representatives from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known by its English translation, “Doctors Without Borders.” Representatives are accusing Israel of war crimes and demanding a ceasefire while denying Hamas' role in the war.\n\nCAMERA Challenges Washington Post’s Pro-Hamas Bias with Mobile Billboard Campaign\n\nCAMERA initiated the mobile campaign due to concerns about the Washington Post’s reliance on Hamas-provided casualty figures, notably those from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nNew York Times Reporters Act as Hamas Stenographers, Forget to Omit ‘Israeli Occupation Forces’\n\nThe deletion of the telling \"occupation forces\" slip-up can't conceal the writers' devotion to serving as obedient Hamas mouthpieces. When it comes to Hamas talking points, buzzing flies prove dead bodies. But when it comes to Israeli claims, even weapons can't prove weapons.\n\nTo See Or Not To See: AFP and Hezbollah’s ‘Visible Presence’ On Israel’s Border\n\nAFP bizarrely reports that Hezbollah \"says it has no visible border presence in the border region\" north of Israel, even as the terror group openly claims credits for attacks that it launched from that area.\n\nCNN Weekend Review, 12/15-12/17: Is Reality Just an Israeli Allegation?\n\nOver the weekend, there was much to desire when it came to CNN’s online coverage of the Israel-Hamas War. Reality was downgraded to just an “Israeli claim.” Terror tunnels were upgraded to a McDonald’s drive-through. Meanwhile, important stories that provide crucial context for those seeking to understand events continue to be omitted.\n\nDoppelganger: Real AP News Report on Black Americans, Palestinians Mimics Fake News\n\nAP's effort to pass off the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as the Middle Eastern doppelgänger of the civil rights movement, with the Palestinians playing the part of Black Americans battling against racism, is nothing short of a parody of journalism.\n\nReuters’ Error, Double Standard and Omissions\n\nReuters' recent misreporting includes a factual error (no, Houthi attacks did not hit Eilat), an egregious double standard on casualty reporting, and whitewashing Palestinian combatants plus Hamas' brutal takeover.\n\nCynthia Nixon Pushes False Claims and Holocaust Inversion on The View\n\nNone of Nixon's hosts pushed back on her false claim about Gaza casualties, or on her weaponization of her relatives' experience as Holocaust survivors against the Jewish state.\n\nThe Washington Post Covers for CAIR, Again\n\nThe executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations hailed the October 7th massacre of civilians by Hamas, prompting a rebuke from the White House. Yet the Washington Post, which frequently quotes the faux civil rights organization, failed to note either the rebuke or CAIR's praise for Hamas.\n\nCAMERA Report: Anti-Israel Extremism and Corrupt Scholarship at Brown University\n\nSpurred on by the concerns of Brown University alumni and students, CAMERA decided to investigate antisemitism and extremism at Brown University. What we found is truly disturbing.\n\nFollowing Contact from CAMERA, Washington Post Corrects on Disproportionate Bombing Claim\n\nThe Washington Post belatedly corrects on an inaccurate claim meant to make the IDF's bombing campaign in Gaza look disproportionate. It turns out that relying on a collector of Nazi memorabilia, whose history of anti-Israel bias is a matter of public record, was a poor decision.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Anti-Israel Crybullies and the Free Speech Inversion\n\nAs defined at Dictionary.com, a crybully is “a person who self-righteously harasses or intimidates others while playing the victim, especially of a perceived social injustice.” It’s a particularly accurate label for the crowd of anti-Israel activists who have spent decades working to silence and intimidate Jewish and Israeli voices on campuses while also portraying themselves as victims of an attack on their free speech.\n\nErrors and Distortions Slant NY Times Gaza Casualties Piece\n\nOne can speak honestly about both the context and the impact of fighting in Gaza without subtracting from the human suffering. Which raises the question: Why does the New York Times choose to prevaricate on the subject?\n\nCNN Stood by a False Claim. CAMERA Has the Proof.\n\nCAMERA promptly alerted the network to a significant error in an video report about released Palestinian prisoners. Instead of a correction, the day after CAMERA’s communication, the network went on to publish a written version of the report, prominently featuring the same exact error in the first two sentences. CAMERA has now acquired and provided the network with conclusive evidence that the claim is false.\n\nJohn Oliver on danger that Hamas will repeat 10/7 Attack: Oh well!\n\nOliver calls for a ceasefire even while acknowledging that, if given the chance, Hamas will repeat the atrocities of October 7. His words show a deep callousness toward Jewish life.\n\nThey Spew Hatred & Glorify Terrorism. But a CNN Article Depicts Them As “The Voice of All These Victims.”\n\n\"It’s about humanity.\" That’s how a CNN article describes one woman’s efforts to help connect Gazans to telephone and internet services. “We are the voice of all these victims,” says another journalist extensively quoted in the piece who benefited from the effort. The problem? Their concept of “humanity” doesn’t include Israelis, and when Israelis are the victims, their voices express glee.\n\nAfter false hate-crime story, President Biden apologizes to Muslim-American Advocates\n\nDuring a meeting at the White House with Muslim Americans, President Biden was told a false story by an attendee that three of her relatives in Chapel Hill, NC had been murdered in an anti-Muslim hate crime. According to press reports this had a deep effect on the President, triggering him to apologize for doubting Hamas casualty claims.\n\nAFP Improves Coverage After Understating Number of Hostages As ‘Dozens’\n\nWhile Agence France Presse neglects to correct an article which underreported that Hamas captured \"dozens\" of hostages, subsequent AFP articles accurately cite 240 hostages. VOA, unlike AFP, commendably corrects.\n\nExcessive Force and the Israel-Hamas War\n\nThe destroyed al-Salam Hospital in Mosul, Iraq after US bombing.\n\nIsrael's war against terrorist groups in Hamas-ruled Gaza has triggered the usual charges of illegal, disproportionate and excessive force, but the analysis shows that Israel has taken more care to protect civilians than legally required, and has acted more humanely than other countries engaged in similar battles, including the United States in Iraq, Panama, etc., and countries including the US fighting under the United Nations banner in Somalia. (Photo above Copyright 2017 Associated Press)\n\nCAMERA Prompts NY Times Correction on State Dept Casualties Comment\n\nThe New York Times corrected after erroneously quoting Barbara Leaf, the assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, as saying \"civilian\" casualties in Gaza might be higher than reported. She was referring to casualties in general.\n\nDream Scenario: AFP Corrects After Alleging Sinwar’s Dream Is State in Gaza, West Bank & East Jerusalem\n\nAre Hamas supporters chanting \"from the river to the sea\" misrepresenting Hamas' goal? Not at all. AFP corrects after ludicrously reporting that Yahya Sinwar's \"dream\" is a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and eastern Jerusalem.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Dear Media, Hamas Couldn’t Do it Without You\n\nThe press has helped Hamas by playing into its narrative. Post columnists like Ishaan Tharoor and Karen Attiah have accused the Jewish state of genocide while actively obfuscating Israel's efforts to limit civilian casualties and Hamas's efforts to encourage them. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times, Hamas wants their human shields. And too many in the press want to shield Hamas.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Voice of America Helps Hamas\n\nVoice of America, the taxpayer-funded and U.S.-operated news network, is refusing to call Hamas “terrorists,” claiming that neutral language should be used. But as CAMERA tells The Federalist, VOA should heed Elie Wiesel's advice: “Neutrality helps the oppressor.”\n\nCNN’s Elbagir Misleads on Released Palestinian Terrorists\n\nNima Elbagir’s report is riddled with errors and half-truths, all which work to portray Palestinian terrorists who attempted to harm Israelis as somehow the real victims.\n\nThe Press Is Falling For Hamas’s Strategy of Placing Palestinian Arab Civilians in Harm’s Way\n\nIn his New York Sun column, author Alan Dershowitz questions the New York Times' uncritical repetition of Hamas' undocumented and absurd claims about civilian casualty figures in Gaza.\n\nCNN’s Tara John Delivers Another Slanted Piece\n\nCNN Senior Writer Tara John’s name has repeatedly featured on the bylines of some of CNN’s worst pieces since the October 7 Massacre carried out by Palestinian terrorists. Between her omissions, inaccuracies, contradictions, and false equivalencies, CNN’s readers are being done a tremendous disservice.\n\nMothers Separated From Children: Media’s Double Standard On Alleged Truce Violations\n\nEven as Reuters and Associated Press are quick to report Hamas' questionable claims of Israeli truce violations, they turn a blind eye to Israeli complaints of Hamas' violation: the terror organization has separated families and released a child without her mother.\n\nABC Corrects False Suggestion Israel Violated Ceasefire\n\nAfter CAMERA's communication with senior editors, ABC corrected a piece that had wrongly suggested Israel was in violation of a ceasefire agreement that had not yet come into effect.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Palestinian Authority is Ill-Prepared to Govern Gaza\n\nSome policymakers and press outlets have argued that the Palestinian Authority should rule Gaza after Hamas loses control. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, this notion is fraught with peril. The PA has rejected peace, supported terrorism and failed to uphold order in the areas that it presently controls.\n\nWho Verifies NPR’s Reporting on the Hamas War?\n\n\"NPR cannot independently verify these claims\" is the refrain used to discredit Israel's claims and the evidence that supports them. Not so for Hamas claims of casualties that are treated as authoritative figures that need no verification. The double standard raises the question of whether anyone can verify NPR's reporting or credibility.\n\nBothsides-ism reaches new and ridiculous heights at The Orange County Register\n\nBoth the OC Register and the AP are also participating in legitimizing the dishonest claim that \"From the River to the Sea, Palestine Will Be Free,\" is something other than a call for the destruction of Israel.\n\n‘Who Can Count the Bodies?’ Asks Hamas’ Health Ministry As Another Hamas Office Issues Stats\n\n“No one has correct numbers, that’s not possible anymore,” Health Ministry official Mehdat Abbas told AP. “Who can count the bodies and release the death toll in a press conference?” And yet it's business as usual at Reuters, which keeps on reporting mysterious casualty statistics attributed to \"authorities in Gaza\" and \"health officials.\"\n\nFrance 24 Arabic Corrects: Israel’s Gaza Area Communities Are Not “Settlements”\n\nIn a rare series of France24 corrections, the French public broadcaster removed false references from several online Arabic stories which wrongly labeled Israeli communities in the Gaza border area as \"settlements.\"\n\nEhud Barak Misleads about the Shifa Tunnels\n\nFormer Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak seems to say in this interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour that Israel created the underground \"bunkers\" beneath Shifa Hospital. What was he talking about? The answer is he confused the word bunker with the word basement. This will become obvious when we outline the facts on who built Shifa Hospital, including the basement, and who built the tunnels and bunkers.\n\nDPA Fixes Captions Which Cited Hamas’ Fatality Claims as Fact\n\nDPA commendably deletes references to Hamas' unverified figure for Gaza casualties which multiple captions has reported as fact and without attribution to the terror organization.\n\nDamn the Evidence: AP’s Hushed Tones On Hamas\n\nAP continues to treat Hamas as more credible than Israel, failing to label the terror group’s claims as unverifiable even as it cautions against \"unverifiable\" video evidence of hostages and tunnels in Shifa exposing Hamas' lies.\n\nCNN Grasps at Straws to Imply an IDF Conspiracy\n\nCNN has repeatedly gone to great lengths to bestow undeserved credibility on the claims of a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, Hamas. In the latest iteration, after Israel brought in cameras to show visual evidence of Hamas’s crimes, two CNN journalists in a contrived, fact-free, and specious story sought to undermine the IDF’s credibility.\n\nReuters Legitimizes Wild Conspiracy Theory With Credulous Headline\n\nThe wire service is pushing a story whose headline and lede suggest, without a hint of proof, that Israel planted evidence of weapons and tunnels at the Shifa hospital. “Doctor says Israeli forces 'found nothing,'\" the headline in part reads.\n\nThe LA Times Editorial Board Fails to Call for Hamas to Surrender, Release Hostages\n\nA Hamas surrender would end the bloodshed immediately and with more lasting effect than a ceasefire. Yet the LA Times Editorial Board does not call for Hamas to surrender, or even for it to release the hostages. Why not?\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post’s Blood Libel\n\nThe Washington Post has accused Israel of genocide. But as CAMERA tells JNS, facts show that Israel is actively working to reduce casualties while Hamas is working to encourage them. But for the Post, Hamas remains a trusted source.\n\nCAMERA’s New Billboard Deplores Biased New York Times Depiction of Hostage Poster Vandalism\n\nSince the October 7th Hamas onslaught on southern Israel, antisemitic individuals have been ripping down posters of civilians taken hostage by Hamas. But there’s one poster they can’t touch: CAMERA's new massive billboard standing outside The New York Times’ headquarters.\n\nCNN is Still Laundering Hamas Propaganda\n\nCNN’s mission statement claims that the network is “committed to serving you,” the media consumer. Instead, CNN is acting as if it is committed to serving Hamas.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: “Glorifying Atrocities: The Case of Brown University”\n\nAfter the Holocaust, many bought into the idea that the best way to prevent the reoccurrence of similar horrors was through education. If the world knows what happened, the thinking went, it’ll never allow such atrocities to repeat. But after the 10/7 Massacre in Israel, we’re seeing a much darker reality about education’s role in shaping society’s attitudes toward atrocities.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Israeli Innovation and War\n\nIn their new book, The Art of Military Innovation: Lessons from the Israel Defense Forces, Edward Luttwak and Eitan Shamir explain that Israel must be more than tough to survive. It must be smart as well.\n\nCommittee to Protect Journalists Protects Hamas Murderers of Israeli Journalists\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists falsifies that Israeli journalists murdered by Hamas while sheltering at home or enjoying themselves at a dance party were killed by a \"political party\" while on \"dangerous assignment.\"\n\nAfter Mea Culpa, NY Times Coverage of Gaza Hospitals Only Gets Worse\n\nAfter issuing a mea culpa about its botched coverage of the Ahli hospital, New York Times coverage has only gotten worse. They continue to push incendiary allegations, while diluting and concealing Israeli denials.\n\nCNN Launders Hamas Propaganda\n\nWhen organized crime wants to hide profits from their criminal enterprises, they launder it through seemingly legitimate business, and after a step or two, the money is clean. Unfortunately, CNN is trying the same trick with casualty reporting from Gaza.\n\nUsing Journalists’ Lives as Currency: Another Cynical Hamas Ruse\n\nThe list of news correspondents who have met a tragic end has been inflated by Hamas and with unwitting accomplices from the West who regurgitated information provided to them without doing appropriate due diligence.\n\nABC Significantly Improves Timeline on Israel-Hamas War\n\nABC thoroughly corrects after reporting that Hamas targeted \"settlers,\" uncritically parroting Hamas' false claim that \"all\" of its fired rockets landed in Israel, and inventing that Gazans who don't flee the north face the \"wrath of 400,000 Israeli soldiers.\"\n\nThe Day Reuters Took a Memo from Hamas\n\nThe Reuters news agency, which banks and brokers the world over rely on for accurate news for their investment decisions, acts like an obedient stenographer taking a memo from the terrorist group Hamas in its reporting on the Gaza conflict.\n\nWith Falsehoods and Bias, NYT Reporter Slurs Israel as Akin to Assad\n\nNew York Times social media guidelines state that “If our journalists are perceived as biased or if they engage in editorializing on social media, that can undercut the credibility of the entire newsroom.” It can. And it does. It can. And it does.\n\nCNN Continues Erasing Palestinian Terrorism in Judea & Samaria\n\nWhy is Jewish violence newsworthy, but not violence against Jews? That is the question to be asked of CNN, at least regarding its coverage of Judea & Samaria.\n\nAP Freelancer Celebrates 10/7 Massacre, Despite CAMERA’s 5-Year Advance Warning of Extremism to AP Editors\n\nThe Associated Press disregarded CAMERA's warnings about freelancer's extremism. Now, read his tweets on October 7 to grasp the implications.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Wants You to Trust Hamas\n\nBoth common sense and experience should tell journalists not to trust Hamas, a genocidal U.S.-designated terrorist group that uses human shields. Both journalists and policymakers, including the U.S. Secretary of State, have warned not to do so. But the Washington Post is advocating for trusting the terror organization.\n\nTaking a Stand: A Compilation of Letters to American Universities on Anti-Israel Bias\n\nThese individuals took a stand at a crucial moment in time against those institutions that are equivocating, or worse, in the face of hatred and terrorism. They serve as examples, and hopefully inspiration, for others to speak up and do what is right.\n\nUpdate: Poynter, PolitiFact ‘Fact Check’ Retracted After CAMERA Intervention\n\n11/27 Update: Prompted by CAMERA's critique, PolitiFact and Poynter reviewed, archived and replaced a story that had misled readers on several counts and suggested there was no merit to the charge that Hamas decapitated Israeli babies.\n\nLos Angeles Times: Israelis Died, Palestinians Killed\n\nAccording to The Los Angeles Times, some 1400 Israeli side \"died\" in the Israel-Hamas war while some 9000 Palestinians were \"killed.\" With this egregious whitewash of Hamas' ISIS-like atrocities, ethical journalism dies alongside 1400 Israelis.\n\nNo Power in Gaza, Hospitals Shutting Down? Watch this Video\n\nHamas-controlled health authorities have been claiming -- for weeks -- that Gaza hospitals will have to close in a day or two for lack of power, and this has been repeated by numerous media outlets. But what Hamas is omitting is that thanks to a UN/WHO program Gaza hospitals have extensive solar panel installations on their roofs, which can supply a substantial portion of their power needs. Watch the video and see for yourself.\n\nCNN: Reporting Palestinian Grief, Omitting Palestinian Celebration of Murder\n\nIf Palestinian grief is newsworthy, so too is Palestinian incitement and celebration of mass murder.\n\nAP’s Selective Inability to Verify Information\n\nFive times in the last week AP cautioned readers that information concerning the Israel-Hamas war \"could not be independently verifed.\" All five times that information originated with Israel, not Hamas. AP treats the terror organization as more credible than Israel.\n\nA Dictionary of Hamas Supporters’ Chants and Slogans\n\nSlogans and chants of Hamas supporters are being increasingly heard at coordinated rallies against Israel, taking place in the U.S. and across Europe. They are not always fully understood by those who hear them — and even those who chant them sometimes deny their meaning and intention. CAMERA presents a translation, based on the words of those who created and promote the slogans.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Hamas’ Strategy? Human Sacrifice\n\nHamas has a new strategy: human sacrifice. As one former Pentagon official has noted, it is innovative in the worst way. And as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the terrorist group is counting on the media to help.\n\nA CNN “Analysis” Explains Antisemitism By Engaging In It\n\nIn an otherwise important piece, it’s a shame that the clearest example of how antisemitism has been allowed to metastasize so widely came from Stephen Collinson himself.\n\nNY Times: Maybe the ‘Kidnapped’ Posters Are the Problem?\n\nVirulent anti-Israel activists have been tearing down posters of kidnapped Israelis. The New York Times wants us to wonder if maybe those putting up the posters that are the real problem.\n\nTIME Author Gaslights Readers With Claim Hamas Is Not Like ISIS\n\nNotwithstanding the distinction between the two jihadist groups’ ideological aims, the salient characteristic of both Hamas and ISIS is savagery and a barbaric evil that must be eliminated at any cost\n\nOpen letter to Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah of Jordan\n\nAn open letter to Queen Rania of Jordan, who in a CNN interview decried alleged Israeli \"shelling\" of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, raising the question of whether she is aware of how her late father-in-law King Hussein defeated a PLO uprising in Jordan by shelling and flattening Palestinian refugee camps, and expelling many of the survivors, including PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat, to Lebanon.\n\nIs Israel’s “Siege” Denying Water and Food to Gaza? Just the Facts\n\nAfter horrific mass terror attacks by Hamas, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced a “complete siege” of Gaza: \"There will be no electricity, no food, no fuel, everything is closed.\" Because some have mistakenly interpreted this to mean that Israel supplied -- and is now cutting off -- all of Gaza’s water, electricity, and food, it's important to layout the facts.\n\nCNN Leaves ICC Prosecutor’s Questionable Claims Unchallenged\n\nMedia outlets, including CNN, cannot simply treat UN and ICC figures as neutral, unbiased sources whose claims can be left uncontextualized or unchallenged. In times of war, journalists must be extra careful, too. To do otherwise is to risk playing a part in Hamas’ cynical use of human shields and civilian deaths.\n\nUPDATED: “Jewish Voice for Peace” (JVP): What the Media is Concealing\n\nWhat is \"Jewish Voice for Peace\"? It's an anti-Semitic hate group that masquerades as a Jewish peace-promoting organization. And much of the mainstream media is concealing its anti-Semitic agenda. CAMERA's backgrounder has been expanded and updated with evidence of its dangerous, anti-Jewish actions. The group justifies Jewish bloodshed and agitates against the right of Jews to defend themselves while promoting resources for anti-Semitic engagement and classic, anti-Jewish blood libels.\n\nWhen Bad Journalists Find “Good” Jews: CNN Runs PR for Far-Left Jewish Groups\n\nAfter the worst massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust, whose voices did CNN’s Alaa Elassar choose to elevate? The fringe Jews dedicated to delegitimizing the Jewish state and justifying the acts of terrorism committed against it.\n\nNPR Runs Interference for Palestinian Terrorist Regime\n\nFocusing on NPR's coverage of a single incident – the deadly explosion that took place near the Al-Ahli hospital in Hamas-run Gaza – this detailed analysis is a case study of the methods NPR reporters use to bolster an anti-Israel narrative and run interference for Israel’s enemies.\n\nTIME Misleads Readers About Cause of Al Ahli Hospital Blast\n\nAfter setting forth the dueling governmental claims, TIME relayed that a New York Times investigation into the blast was inconclusive, but omits the extensive and fairly conclusive report of the Associated Press.\n\nWaPo Columnist: Oct. 7 Massacre a ‘Bad Thing’ That Doesn’t Justify Other ‘Bad Things’\n\nThe Washington Post's World View is thoroughly distorted. The newspaper continues to treat Hamas casualty claims as reliable. And columnist Ishaan Tharoor insists on giving the genocidal terrorist group the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe Hamas-UN-LA Times Echo Chamber\n\nA leading terror organization has mastered the art of the echo chamber, enlisting a leading Western media outlet to falsely cast its claims as independently verified by a supposedly authoritative international body, thereby repackaging them as authentic and reliable.\n\nCNN Deceptively Attributes Hamas Casualty Figures to “Aid Group”\n\nCNN can’t help itself. Last week, the network was caught uncritically spreading Hamas’s propaganda that Israel struck Al-Ahli hospital on October 17th. A week later, CNN is back at it, once again spreading Hamas claims, but this time deceiving its audience into thinking the terrorist organization's casualty figures came from a legitimate, independent source.\n\nAP ‘Fact Check’ Pushes Debunked ‘We Just Don’t Know’ Narrative on Hamas’ Al Ahli Hospital Lie\n\nAn AP \"fact check\" report is unironically headlined: \"Misinformation about the Israel-Hamas war. Here are the facts.\" Far from supplying the facts, today's \"fact check\" conceals known facts, bringing us back to the worst of last week's coverage of Hamas' Al Ahli hospital misinformation campaign.\n\nGaza Casualties: Journalists Must Exercise Care and Be Honest with Audience\n\nSpreading Hamas propaganda without qualification or context is no different than uncritically airing Islamic State propaganda. Journalists must clearly articulate to their audiences that when they use Hamas casualty figures, they are relying on an internationally designated terrorist organization. The public should know those important factors that weigh on the credibility of such significant claims.\n\nLA Times’ Unfulfilled Promises: Accuracy, Fairness, Journalistic Rigor, Compassion\n\nAfter Hillary Manning, Los Angeles Times' VP of communications, defended the paper as \"committed to the standards of accuracy and fairness,\" and promised \"journalistic rigor, fairness and compassion,\" the paper continues to pump out coverage of Israel and Hamas which indicates otherwise.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Washington Post Echoes Hamas\n\nThe Washington Post is failing. The newspaper can't help but repeat Hamas propaganda. Worse still, the newspaper is literally justifying the greatest slaughter of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: Looking Back at the Yom Kippur War\n\nCAMERA looks back at the Yom Kippur War for Providence Magazine. The war started off poorly for Israel, but the Jewish state rebounded to expel its enemies.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: The Long History of Palestinian Terrorists Murdering Babies\n\nThere is a long history of Palestinian terrorists murdering children and women and desecrating their bodies. As CAMERA tells the Washington Times, this bloody history stretches back more than a century, and it tells us much about the roots of the Israel-Islamist conflict.\n\nUSA Today’s Historically Illiterate Timeline of the Israel-Islamist Conflict\n\nA recent USA Today timeline on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is rife with omissions. Intifadas, terror campaigns, rejected peace offers, thousands of dead Israelis, all are but a fraction of what four USA Today reporters left out.\n\nSky News’s Shameful Coverage of Gaza Hospital Blast\n\nAnna Botting made clear on Tuesday that she had abandoned any pretense of objectivity or even of journalistic curiosity. Her anti-Israel animus was on full display.\n\nCNN’s Mea Culpa on Al-Ahli Hospital Coverage Isn’t Enough\n\nContrary to CNN's depiction, it wasn’t that this was a “he said she said” issue, and the network just failed by not waiting for the “she said.” The issue was that they took Hamas’s claims at face value, and then they gave the terrorist organization’s claims equal weight to that of Israel’s, notwithstanding the IDF’s claims were backed up by audio and visual evidence.\n\nOn X, LA Times Managing Editor Sara Yasin Embraces Hamas Narrative\n\nSara Yasin's X embrace of the Hamas narrative is nothing short of a bear hug for the designated terror organization from a senior editor at a leading U.S. newspaper.\n\nNBC Errs on Rafah Crossing, U.S. Message to Israel on Civilians\n\nNBC falsely reports that Secretary of State Blinken encouraged Israel \"not to target civilians.\" While the US administration urges Israel to minimize civilian casualties and to allow humanitarian assistance, it knows full well that Israel, unlike Hamas, does not target civlians. And, no, the Palestinian Authority does not control the Rafah crossing. Hamas does.\n\nUpdated: What happened at the Gaza Hospital and do Palestinian rockets “occasionally” misfire?\n\nHundreds of people sheltering at the Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City were killed in an explosion that some have blamed on Israel, but which Israel says was caused by an errant Islamic Jihad rocket. Indeed IJ rockets have caused so much death and destruction in Gaza that Hamas has criticized the group and demanded they pay compensation to families of the dead.\n\nCAIR Spokesman Falsely Implies Jewish Responsibility for Murder in U.S.\n\nLest anyone still doubts that anti-Semitism is inherent in the anti-Zionist narrative depicting Jews in Israel as settler-colonialists responsible for all the violence in the Middle East and Jewish supporters responsible for violence elsewhere in the world, and lest they doubt the anti-Zionist/anti-Semitic agenda of CAIR, listen to its spokesman's words.\n\nWhy this Israel-Hamas War Is Not Like the Others: A Brief Primer\n\nThe latest incarnation of the Israel-Iran War is unlike any conflict in the Jewish state's history. In this brief explainer, CAMERA explains why this war is different, and what is at stake.\n\nHamas: We Are Targeting The Airport. Wall Street Journal: Hamas Unlikely To Target Passengers\n\n\". . . [N}either Hamas nor Israel is likely to intentionally target civilian aircraft,\" reports the Wall Street Journal. While there is zero chance Israel would target a civilian aircraft (particularly at its own airport!), Hamas boasts of firing at Israel's airport.\n\nU Penn “Palestine Writes” Organizer Susan Abulhawa Cheers Gaza Massacre\n\nAbulhawa's jubilant reaction to the Hamas slaughter of Israelis was consistent with the demonizing of the Jewish state promoted continuously at the \"literary\" conference. Incessant denials of Jewish indigenous ties to a land filled with evidence at every turn of those ties were accompanied by constant references to a \"glorious\" and \"ancient\" Palestinian past.\n\nHuman Rights Watch on MSNBC: Urging Civilians to Evacuate is Terrorism\n\nWhen a Human Rights Watch activist was given two chances on MSNBC to talk about the situation in Israel, she used the word “terrorism” only once. No, not in reference to the mass murder, rape, mutilation, torture, and burning alive of 1,400 Israeli men, women, and children at the hands of Palestinian terrorists. Rather, she used it to describe the Israeli Defense Force’s urging of Gazans to evacuate northern Gaza where the IDF intends to strike hard against those Palestinian terrorists.\n\nBBC Investigates Journalists Following CAMERA Exposé\n\nIn response to distressing revelations uncovered by CAMERA's Arabic department, the BBC has launched an investigation into its personnel with pro-Hamas sympathies for the October 7 Massacre.\n\nBBC and CBC Refuse to Call Hamas “Terrorists” or Refer to Their Actions as “Terrorism”\n\nBoth the British and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporations have refused to refer to the massacres and abductions of people in Israel by Palestinian terrorists as \"terrorism\" of any sort, claiming a moral high ground by refusing to do so. This is in contrast to how they've referred to other terrorist attacks.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: In the Middle East, a Time for Choosing\n\nHamas and other Iranian proxies have just carried out the greatest slaughter of Jewish civilians since the Holocaust. And as CAMERA tells the Washington Times, the United States and the West have a choice to make: will they stand with Israel and the civilized world? Or will they continue to enable Iran in all its barbarism?\n\nLA Times: Israel Has Controlled Gaza For Decades. We Ask: Who’s Controlling LAT News Coverage?\n\nAfter an Los Angeles Times entertainment reporter falsely claims that Israel has controlled the Gaza Strip for decades, it's time to ask: Who, exactly, is controlling news coverage at the LA Times?\n\nESPN Erases Evil\n\nPopular sports network ESPN is completely out of its league when it comes to reporting on Hamas' ISIS-like evil atrocities. If the sports network is not capable of adequately covering terrorism, it should stick to familiar turf.\n\nHow Many Errors Can USA Today Fit in One Article?\n\nThe number of erroneous and seriously misleading claims contained in just this article raises serious concerns about USA Today’s commitment to accuracy. That the errors all seem to downplay Palestinian terrorism or distort the Israeli and Jewish history similarly raises concern about USA Todays’ commitment to fairness in reporting.\n\nDon’t Look Away, Media: Hamas Roadblocks Reflect An Old Story\n\nAs Hamas reportedly imposes roadblocks and confiscates ID cards and car keys from Palestinians hoping to flee in face of Israel's impending ground operation, an old story once again unfolds. Will the media tell it?\n\nThe Shocking Historical Illiteracy of Harper’s Magazine on Gaza\n\nIf Harper’s cannot get these basic, well-known facts about the Gaza Strip right, how can readers trust anything else the magazine says about the conflict?\n\nJoy Reid and Her Guests Blame Israel for Hamas’s Massacre\n\nIt is Hamas's murderous ideology as expressed in its charter, and not any action by Israel, that led to Saturday’s massacre.\n\nCNBC Sanitizes Hamas\n\nIn the span of two sentences, CNBC grossly misrepresented Hamas’s goals and, in what reads as an attempted justification for Hamas, got both the law and the facts wrong.\n\nUPDATED: Brookline Schools Encouraged to Promote Moral Ambiguity About Antisemitic Terrorism\n\nThere are increasing attempts to have teachers promote moral ambiguity about antisemitic violence. The public school superintendent in Brookline, Massachusetts -- a town heavily populated by Jews -- provides one such example.\n\nCAMERA Op-Ed: No Safe Haven for Hamas\n\nHamas has launched a devastating war against Israel, slaughtering hundreds of civilians. But as CAMERA tells the Washington Examiner, its leadership lives in luxury, far from the consequences of their actions. And that must change.\n\nTestimony: Family and Witnesses Speak of Oct. 7 Horrors\n\nHeartbreaking testimony by the family of victims and chilling eyewitness accounts of first responders document the pain and horror of the attacks on civilians. And they underscore the callousness of atrocity denial — including by former Palestinian Authority Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti, who told CNN viewers that Hamas didn't target civilians.\n\nAs Israelis are Slaughtered, MSNBC Says Palestinians in Chicago Also In “Pain”\n\nAt MSNBC, even when Jews are being cruelly slaughtered by the hundreds, they cannot be centered as the victims; after all, they probably had it coming.\n\nReuters Partially Amends Flawed Reporting on Israeli Airstrikes\n\nChristiane Amanpour Guest Compared Saturday’s Barbaric Attack to Israeli Defense\n\nIsraelis massacred while BBC World Service radio amplifies Hamas propaganda"
