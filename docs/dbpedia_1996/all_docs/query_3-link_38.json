I happened to be there on the day that Benny Gantz resigned from the war cabinet and called for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to schedule new elections, breaking the unity government that Israel had had since shortly after Oct. 7.\n\nIn Israel now, the left is not viable. Nor is there a party or coalition of real size that I would even call center-left. There is a coalition that Netanyahu leads stretching from right to far right and a coalition that Gantz leads stretching from center to right. Pinning down the differences between Gantz and Netanyahu is a challenge."
