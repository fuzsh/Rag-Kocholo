        "text": "Tel Aviv-Yafo often referred to as just Tel Aviv, is located on the Israeli Mediterranean coastline and is considered the economic and cultural center of the country.\n\nThe city was founded in 1909 by the Yishuv and was given township status within the Jaffa municipality in 1921 before becoming independent from Jaffa in 1934. Today, it has a population of almost half a million people and is the second-most populous city in Israel after Jerusalem.\n\nTel Aviv has a reputation for being the \"party capital\" of the Middle East, and in 2020 it was recognized as the \"Vegan Capital of the World,\" with over 400 vegan or vegan-friendly restaurants across the city. The city is also famous for its open acceptance of LGBT culture and hosts the largest pride parade in Asia every year.\n\nThe city has a diverse population, with Jews forming 91.8% of the population, Muslim and Arab Christians making up another 4.2%, and the rest being split between various other groups. Experts have estimated there to be about 50,000 unregistered foreign workers also living in the city.\n\nTel Aviv is divided into nine districts, the oldest being Jaffa. It is home to the internationally recognized Tel Aviv University and is seen as a cultural center for Israel's creative arts scene.\n\nAn estimated 2.5 million international visitors travel to Tel Aviv annually, making it the 5th most visited city in the Middle East and Africa."
