We look at what media in the United States is missing in Israel’s war on Gaza – and why it matters.\n\nContributors:\n\nNoura Erakat – Associate Professor, Rutgers University\n\nAbdallah Fayyad – Journalist; Former Member, Boston Globe Editorial Board\n\nAlex Kane – Senior Reporter, Jewish Currents\n\nJack Mirkinson – Acting Senior Editor, The Nation\n\nOn our radar:\n\nThe vast majority of mainstream outlets in the US are corporate-owned. Nic Muirhead reports on how publicly-funded broadcasters in the Anglosphere are taking heat over their coverage of the Gaza story.\n\n‘India Stands With Israel’\n\nIndo-Israeli relations have been on the upswing for the past few years. And in this war, Indians have been showing their support through posts online, and rants on TV with some disinformation thrown in, to skew how this conflict is understood. Meenakshi Ravi reports."
