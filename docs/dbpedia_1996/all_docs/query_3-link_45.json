        "text": "Updated to reflect U.S. government restrictions on travel to Northern Israel, and information for U.S. citizens, Lawful Permanent Residents and qualifying immediate family members seeking assistance in Gaza.\n\nDo Not Travel To:\n\nGaza due to terrorism and armed conflict\n\nNorthern Israel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders due to the rising tensions between Hizballah and Israel\n\nReconsider Travel To:\n\nIsrael due to terrorism and civil unrest\n\nWest Bank due to terrorism and civil unrest\n\nCountry Summary: Terrorist groups, lone-actor terrorists and other violent extremists continue plotting possible attacks in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. Terrorists and violent extremists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities. Violence can occur in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza without warning.\n\nSome areas have increased risk.

Review the Traveler’s Checklist.\n\nGaza – Do Not Travel\n\nDo not travel due to terrorism and armed conflict.\n\nThe U.S. government is unable to provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Gaza as U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling there. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting large-scale military operations in Gaza against Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization, which was responsible for the October 7 attack on Israel. As a result of the armed conflict, the security environment within Gaza and on its borders is extremely dangerous and volatile. The pedestrian crossing between Gaza and Israel was damaged on October 7 and remains closed, and the pedestrian crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been closed since May 7 and it is unknown when it will re-open. There are sporadic telecommunication and internet outages within Gaza further inhibiting the ability of residents to obtain information.\n\nIf a U.S. citizen, Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR), or qualified immediate family member desires our assistance and has not already provided their information to the Department of State, please email U.S. Embassy Jerusalem at JerusalemACS@state.gov with a copy of the individual’s travel document as well as an explanation or proof of relationship.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High Risk Areas.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Gaza:\n\nBe prepared for an indefinite stay as the crossings between Gaza with Israel and Egypt can close without advance notice and for long periods during times of unrest and armed conflict.\n\nHave a plan for entering and departing Gaza that does not rely on U.S. government assistance.\n\nHouseholds with infants and young children should plan for food and supplies, such as diapers and wipes, formula or baby food, and a change of clothing.\n\nIf you take medication, make sure to have at least five days’ worth at any given time – if you can, we encourage enough for two weeks beyond your scheduled trip and have a copy of your prescriptions handy.\n\nIf you use assistive or medical devices that require a power supply, be sure to find backup power or other ways that will sustain your device or equipment during a power outage.\n\nDraft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\n\nDiscuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n\nLeave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n\nPlease be sure to visit our website for How to Prepare for a Crisis for information that may be helpful.\n\nIsrael – Reconsider Travel (see below for specific advice on travel within 2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders)\n\nReconsider travel due to terrorism and civil unrest.\n\nThe security situation remains unpredictable, and U.S. citizens are reminded to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness as security incidents, including mortar and rocket fire, often take place without warning.\n\nU.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel to the following locations:\n\nWithin seven miles of the Gaza demarcation line, as well as the cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon; and\n\nWithin 1.5 miles of the Israel-Egypt border.\n\nAdditional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility, with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.\n\nNorthern Israel (within 2.5 miles of Lebanese and Syrian borders) – Do Not Travel\n\nU.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from personal travel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Any U.S. government travel to this area is done in full coordination with Israeli security forces.\n\nDue to the ongoing active hostilities between Israel and Hizballah, the U.S. Embassy strongly recommends that U.S. citizens do not travel within 2.5 miles of the Lebanese and Syrian borders. Cross-border rocket, missile, and drone strikes continue to impact this area daily and have resulted in casualties. The Israeli authorities already restrict travel to these areas.\n\nWest Bank – Reconsider Travel\n\nReconsider travel due to terrorism and civil unrest.\n\nU.S. government employees in Israel under Chief of Mission security responsibility are currently restricted from all personal travel to the West Bank, except:\n\nU.S. government employees can use Routes 1, 90, and 443 at any time.\n\nU.S. government employees are permitted personal daylight travel to Jericho and Bethlehem, including Beit Jala and Beit Sahour. Given continued closures of checkpoints throughout the West Bank, the only permitted and accessible route into Bethlehem for U.S. government employees and their family members is through Checkpoint 300 near Rachel’s Tomb.\n\nU.S. government employees are permitted daylight travel to: Inn of the Good Samaritan, An-Nabi Musa, Wadi Qelt Nature Preserve, and St. George’s Monastery along Route 1; and Qumran, Kalia Beach, St. Gerasimos/Khogla Monastery, Al Auju, and Qasr al-Yaud baptismal site along Route 90.\n\nOver the past few months, there has been an increase in settler violence, Israeli military operations, and terrorist attacks.\n\nAdditional travel restrictions may be imposed on U.S. government employees under Chief of Mission security responsibility with little to no notice due to increased security issues or threats.\n\nVisit our website for Travel to High Risk Areas.\n\nThe Government of Israel administers immigration and security controls at its international land crossings with Jordan (into both the West Bank and Israel), Egypt (at the Taba crossing near Eilat), and at Israel’s airports and seaports. A separate network of security checkpoints and crossings operated by Israeli authorities regulates the movement of people and goods between Israel and the West Bank, and between Israel and Gaza.\n\nThe U.S. government seeks equal treatment and freedom of travel for all U.S. citizens regardless of national origin, religion, or ethnicity. All persons seeking to enter or depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly including prolonged questioning and physical searches, and may be denied entry or exit consistent with the uniform application of Israeli law. Persons who are denied entry have the right to an immigration court hearing to contest the denial, but they will be detained for the duration of the proceedings. Specific questions about your individual circumstances should be directed to your closest Israeli Embassy or Consulate.\n\nWhen traveling into Israel, please make sure you have proper travel documentation before arrival in Israel.\n\n1. Do I need a visa to enter Israel if I normally live in the United States?\n\nUntil January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens may use their U.S. passport to enter Israel for business or tourism purposes for stays of up to 90 days without a visa, including U.S. citizens transiting Israel to and from the West Bank.\n\nStarting January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens must have an approved Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) or a visa to enter Israel for business or tourism purposes for stays up to 90 days; an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) application will cost 25 shekels.Until January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens can submit an ETA-IL application for no fee during this voluntary, pilot phase.\n\nFor more information, please contact your nearest Israeli Embassy or consulate and consult this Israeli government webpage: Reciprocal Privileges for U.S. Citizens at Border Control.\n\n2. Do I need a visa to enter the West Bank if I am visiting the West Bank and normally live in the United States?\n\nUntil January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens who are not West Bank residents can use their U.S. passport to enter the West Bank for business or tourism purposes for stays of up to 90 days without a visa. For more information, visit this Israeli government webpage: Entry of Palestinian-American Tourists into Israel.\n\nStarting January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens must have an approved Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) or a visa to enter Israel for business or tourism purposes for stays up to 90 days; an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) application will cost 25 shekels. Until January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens can submit an ETA-IL application for no fee during this voluntary, pilot phase.\n\nU.S. citizens who are not Palestinian Authority (PA) ID/passport holders and who wish to study, teach, research, work, or volunteer in the West Bank should consult the Israeli government’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) regulations on entry into the West Bank. U.S. citizens who are engaged or married to West Bank residents and wish to remain in the West Bank should also consult these regulations. Questions regarding these regulations can be directed to COGAT by email at inquiries@cogat.gov.il or by phone at +972-3-697-7577.\n\n3. Do I need a visa to enter Israel if I normally live in the West Bank?\n\nU.S. citizens who are also residents of the West Bank can either apply for a permit to enter Israel from the Government of Israel’s COGAT or apply for a visa to enter Israel at Allenby Bridge in order to transit through the West Bank to Israel for up to 90 days. For more information, visit the Government of Israel’s webpage: Entry-Exit Information: Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nU.S. citizens with a Palestinian Authority (PA) ID residing in the West Bank can submit an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) but must also continue to request a B2 permit through the Al-Munassiq app. By the end of 2024, the Israeli government has committed to implement a system that will allow U.S. citizens with a PA ID residing in the West Bank who receive an approved ETA-IL to use it to receive a B2 permit at one of the designated pedestrian crossings.\n\n4. Do I need a visa to enter Gaza through Israel if I normally live in the United States?\n\nPlease see the Travel Advisory before traveling to Gaza. Gaza is Level 4 – Do Not Travel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are conducting large-scale military operations in Gaza against Hamas, a U.S. government-designated foreign terrorist organization. As a result of the armed conflict, the security environment within Gaza and on its borders is extremely dangerous and volatile. We remind all U.S. citizens seeking to travel to Gaza that the U.S. government is unable to provide any routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens in Gaza. Given the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, U.S. citizens cannot enter Gaza from Israel.\n\n5. Can U.S. citizens registered as residents of Gaza enter or transit Israel?\n\nU.S. citizens who are also listed on the Palestinian Population registry for Gaza may use their U.S. passport to apply for entry into Israel for business or tourism purposes for stays of up to 90 days without a visa, including transiting Israel to and from the West Bank (but not to transit to Gaza).\n\nFor more information, visit the Government of Israel’s webpage: Entry of Palestinian-American Tourists into Israel.\n\nStarting January 1, 2025, U.S. citizen must have an approved Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) or a visa to enter Israel , for business or tourism purposes for stays up to 90 days; an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) application will cost 25 shekels. Until January 1, 2025, U.S. citizens can submit an ETA-IL application for no fee during a voluntary, pilot phase.\n\n6. What if I am denied entry?\n\nU.S. citizens should immediately report any denial of entry or harassment or discriminatory treatment by border officials to the American Citizens Services (ACS) unit of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem or the Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv.\n\nU.S. citizens can use the U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and Branch Office Tel Aviv online reporting form.\n\nU.S. citizens can call the Embassy at the phone numbers on our website (denials of entry only): U.S. Citizen Services - U.S. Embassy in Israel (usembassy.gov)\n\nPlease note that the decision to admit or deny a traveler admission to Israel is entirely made by the State of Israel. The U.S. Embassy does not control this process and cannot intervene on an individual’s behalf. However, U.S. citizens who are denied entry into Israel or the West Bank should receive a written explanation from Israeli authorities.\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Interior has continued to deny entry into Israel and the West Bank to some foreign nationals (including U.S. citizens) affiliated with certain political and non-governmental organizations that the Government of Israel views as anti-Israel. Participation in Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)-related activities is one of the considerations Israeli authorities consider when deciding whether to refuse entry to individuals into Israel and the West Bank.\n\nIn addition to contacting the U.S. Embassy, if you were the subject of mistreatment or harassment by Israeli authorities upon entry to or exit from Israel, you may also email TZ@piba.gov.il to file a complaint with the Israeli authorities. If the mistreatment or harassment occurred at a check point to the West Bank you may email inquiries@cogat.gov.il to file a complaint.\n\n7. What if I’m an Israeli citizen?\n\nIndividuals with Israeli citizenship, regardless of other nationality, including U.S. citizenship, must enter and depart Israel using their Israeli passports in accordance with Israeli law. Due to a passport backlog, Israeli citizens are temporarily allowed to enter and depart Israel on non-Israeli passports until December 31, 2024. U.S.-Israeli citizens do not need to submit an Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA-IL) application and should depart the United States on their U.S. passport and enter Israel on their Israeli passport as long as they have checked in to their flight with the Israeli passport.\n\nIsraeli citizens are prohibited from using the Allenby/King Hussein Bridge crossing. They are also prohibited from entering Gaza and are generally prohibited from traveling to parts of the West Bank under PA control (Area A), to include Bethlehem and Jericho.\n\nFurther information on dual nationality, prevention of international child abduction, and customs regulations can be found on our website at travel.state.gov.\n\nTerrorism: Terrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking U.S. citizens abroad. Terrorists are increasingly using less sophisticated methods of attack – including knives, firearms, and vehicles – to target crowds. Frequently, their aim is unprotected or vulnerable targets, such as:\n\nHigh-profile public events (sporting contests, political rallies, demonstrations, holiday events, celebratory gatherings, etc.)\n\nHotels, clubs, and restaurants frequented by tourists\n\nPlaces of worship\n\nSchools\n\nParks\n\nTourism infrastructure\n\nShopping malls and markets\n\nPublic transportation systems (including subways, buses, trains, and scheduled commercial flights)\n\nPlease view the current Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for detailed information regarding the terrorism threat in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. For more information, see our Terrorism page.\n\nPlease view the current Travel Advisory for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza for detailed information regarding the terrorism threat in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.\n\nMortar and Rocket Fire or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion: In the event of mortar or rocket fire or Hostile Aircraft Intrusion, a “red alert” siren may be activated. Treat all such alerts as real. Follow the instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. Know the location of your closest shelter or protected space. U.S. government personnel and their family members may be restricted from traveling to areas affected by rocket activity, sirens, and/or the opening of bomb shelters. For additional information on appropriate action to take upon hearing a siren or explosion, see the Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command website (available on devices within Israel) or view the Preparedness Information. U.S. citizens may also wish to download the free Israel Defense Forces Home Front Command application on Android or Apple devices to receive real-time security and safety alerts. Free commercial applications, such as Red Alert: Israel, are also available.\n\nCrime: The crime rate is moderate in Israel and the West Bank. Parked vehicle break-ins are common at public beach areas, national parks, and other tourist sites. Vehicle theft also remains a problem. U.S. citizens should not leave their valuables (including passports) unattended in parked vehicles, on the beach, or unsecured in hotels. Visitors should be aware of their surroundings in tourist areas and watch for crimes of opportunity, such as pickpockets. The crime rate in Gaza is now unknown given the ongoing armed conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nFor additional information, read the most recent Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) Crime and Safety Report for Israel.\n\nDemonstrations occur frequently. They may take place in response to political or economic issues, on politically significant holidays, and during international events.\n\nDemonstrations can be unpredictable. Avoid areas around protests and demonstrations. Check local media for updates and traffic advisories.\n\nInternational Financial Scams: See the Department of State and the FBI pages for information.\n\nTechnology Usage Abroad: Mobiles Devices are vulnerable to compromise, theft, and physical damage anywhere in the world. Best practices include making sure all software (operating system and apps) are updated prior to traveling abroad and using virtual private network and encrypted voice over IP (VoIP) applications if possible while abroad. Make sure that all VPN/VoIP are reputable, and U.S. based. Do not connect to\n\nunknown open Wi-Fi.\n\nGPS navigation applications (apps) can help you get around in a foreign country. Prior to using a GPS app make sure you research the route to make sure it is safe. A GPS navigation app may give you the shortest route without accounting for the safety of that route.\n\nBe cautious of using dating apps/online dating websites abroad as U.S. citizens can be targeted by scammers. Make sure to inform your friends and family of your whereabouts, meet at a well-known public location, and do not consume suspicious food or drinks. Avoid traveling alone to bars or nightclubs.\n\nVictims of Crime: Report crimes to the local police. The local equivalent to the “911” emergency line in Israel and the West Bank is 100 for police, 101 for an ambulance, and 102 for the fire department.\n\nU.S. citizen victims of sexual assault are encouraged to contact U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv for assistance. You can reach U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv at the contact information provided above. Local authorities are responsible for investigating and prosecuting crime.\n\nSee our webpage on help for U.S. victims of crime overseas.\n\nWe can:\n\nHelp you find appropriate medical care\n\nAssist you in reporting a crime to the police\n\nContact relatives or friends with your written consent\n\nProvide general information regarding the victim’s role during the local investigation and following its conclusion\n\nProvide a list of local attorneys\n\nProvide our information on victim’s compensation programs in the United States\n\nProvide information on possible Government of Israel assistance to victims of crime:\n\nIsrael National Police\n\nMinistry of Justice\n\nMinistry of National Security\n\nProvide information on Government of Israel assistance to victims of terrorist acts (contact the National Insurance Institute for more information)\n\nProvide an emergency loan for repatriation to the United States and/or limited medical support in cases of destitution\n\nHelp you find accommodation and arrange flights home\n\nReplace a stolen or lost passport\n\nDomestic Violence: U.S. citizen victims of domestic violence should contact local police and/or the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (#118 from a local cell phone or via text at +972-50-227-0018) but may also contact U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Embassy Branch Office Tel Aviv to report it.\n\nTourism: The tourism industry is generally regulated in Israel and the West Bank. Rules with regards to general practices and safety inspections are regularly enforced. Hazardous areas/activities are identified with appropriate signage and trained staff is typically on hand in support of organized activities.\n\nCriminal Penalties: You are subject to the local laws of the locations you visit or reside in. Foreign laws and legal systems can be significantly different from those of the United States. If you violate Israeli or Palestinian Authority (PA) laws, even unknowingly, being a U.S. citizen will not help you avoid arrest or prosecution. The Israeli government will treat dual U.S-Israeli citizens as Israeli citizens, and the Palestinian Authority will treat dual U.S.-PA passport holders as PA \"citizens”– regardless of whether they entered Israel or PA-administered area on a U.S. passport.\n\nPenalties for possession, use, or trafficking illegal drugs in Israel and PA-administered areas are severe and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Individuals expressing views, including on social media, which the Government of Israel considers incitement to violence or hate speech may face criminal penalties, even if the the substance and manner in which those views are expressed would be lawful in the United States. PA security officials have also arrested Palestinians who posted criticism of the PA and PA leadership online. In Gaza, individuals publicly criticizing authorities risk reprisal by Hamas, including arrest, interrogation, seizure of property, and harassment.\n\nFurthermore, some laws are also prosecutable in the United States, regardless of local law. For examples, see our website on crimes against minors abroad and the Department of Justice website.\n\nArrests and Arrest Notification: If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify U.S. Embassy Jerusalem or Branch Office Tel Aviv immediately. See our website on arrest or detention of a U.S. citizen abroad for further information. While the U.S. Embassy may not recommend a particular foreign attorney, the embassy website has the names of several attorneys who have identified themselves as willing to assist U.S. citizen clients. Please note that inclusion on this list in no way represents an endorsement of services by the Department or the U.S. government.\n\nArrests and Arrest Notification by Israel:\n\nThe Government of Israel is required by a bilateral treaty and customary international law to promptly notify the U.S. Embassy when a U.S. citizen is arrested in Israel to inform them that if the citizen is a U.S. citizen and requests that the U.S. Embassy be notified and makes such a request. In case of arrest or detention, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and request that the authorities notify the U.S. Embassy immediately. There are credible reports that U.S. citizens have been mistreated by Israeli security forces during their arrest and interrogation.\n\nSome youths over the age of 12 have been tried as adults; youths over the age of 14 can be imprisoned.\n\nArrestees have also reported pressure to sign documents in Hebrew that they do not understand.\n\nU.S. citizens arrested in Israel for criminal or security offenses are entitled to legal representation provided by the Government of Israel. U.S. citizens arrested by Israeli authorities for security offenses may be prevented from communicating with lawyers, family members, or consular officers for lengthy periods. Even after notification, consular access to the arrested individual may be delayed for days to several weeks. Under Israeli law, individuals detained for security offenses may be held for up to six months without charges.\n\nArrests and Arrest Notification by the Palestinian Authority (PA):\n\nIn case of arrest or detention, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and should request that the U.S. Embassy be notified immediately. Individuals arrested by PA security forces in the West Bank for security offenses may be prohibited from communicating with lawyers, family members, or consular officers for lengthy periods. In addition, they may be held in custody for long periods without formal charges or before being brought before a judge for an arrest extension. The PA often does not notify the U.S. Embassy of such arrests, and consular access to arrestees is often delayed. There are credible reports that arrested individuals, including U.S. citizens, have been mistreated by PA security forces during their arrest and interrogation.\n\nGaza: Since Hamas seized control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007, they have dominated security matters in Gaza, but this control has been degraded by Israel’s ongoing military operations against Hamas. The U.S. government is severely limited in what it can do to assist those detained in Gaza. In case of arrest or detention by Israeli security forces in Gaza, U.S. citizens should promptly identify themselves as such to the arresting authorities and should request that the U.S. Embassy be notified immediately.\n\nIsraeli Court Jurisdiction: Military, civil and religious courts in Israel actively exercise their authority to bar certain individuals, including nonresidents, from leaving the country until debts or other legal claims and matters against them are resolved. Israel's religious courts exercise jurisdiction over all citizens and residents of Israel in cases of marriage, divorce, child custody, and child support. U.S. citizens, including those without Israeli citizenship, may be subject to involuntary and prolonged stays (and even imprisonment) in Israel if a case is filed against them in a religious court, even if their marriage took place in the United States, and regardless of whether their spouse is present in Israel. The U.S. Embassy is unable to cancel the debt of a U.S. citizen or guarantee their departure from Israel when they face a bar from leaving the country until debts are resolved.\n\nPurchases of Property: U.S. citizens should always seek legal advice before buying or leasing property in the West Bank and Gaza. Please see the most recent Investment Climate Statement for the West Bank and Gaza for additional information on property rights.\n\nCounterfeit and Pirated Goods: Although counterfeit and pirated goods are prevalent in many countries, they may be illegal according to the local laws. Counterfeit and pirated goods also may pose significant risks to consumer health and safety. You may be subject to fines and/or have to give up counterfeit and pirated goods if you bring them back to the United States. See the U.S. Customs and Border Protection website and U.S. Department of Justice website for more information.\n\nFaith-Based Travelers: See the following webpages for details:\n\nFaith-Based Travel Information\n\nInternational Religious Freedom Report – see country reports\n\nHuman Rights Report – see country reports\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nInternational Volunteers:\n\nBest Practices for Volunteering Abroad\n\nLGBTQI+ Rights: There are no legal restrictions on same-sex sexual relations or the organization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI+) events in Israel. Israeli anti-discrimination laws protect LGBTQI+ individuals. Acceptance and tolerance of LGBQTI+ people vary throughout the country and from neighborhood to neighborhood. As of August 2014, the Law of Return allows that same-sex spouses of Jews immigrating to Israel – known as “making Aliyah” – are eligible to make Aliyah with their spouses and receive Israeli citizenship.\n\nThe legal systems in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are based on the 1960 Jordanian penal code which prohibits consensual same-sex sexual activity. However, the PA has not prosecuted individuals suspected of such activity. Societal discrimination, including from families, based on cultural and religious traditions is commonplace, making the West Bank and Gaza challenging environments for LGBTQI+ persons. PA security officers have harassed, abused, and sometimes arrested LGBTQI+ individuals because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. NGOs have reported that Hamas also harassed and detained persons in Gaza due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nLGBTQI+ travelers are encouraged to remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, especially when entering religious or socially conservative areas.\n\nIsrael’s Aguda organization provides useful information on LGBTQI+ issues in Israel.\n\nSee our LGBTQI+ Travel Information page and section 6 of the Department of State's Human Rights report for further details.\n\nPersons with Mobility Issues: Individuals with mobility issues may find accessibility and accommodation in Israel very different from in the United States. Legislation mandates access to buildings and transportation, as well as accommodations for persons with disabilities in services and the workplace. However, the government enforces the laws with only limited success. Societal discrimination and lack of accessibility persist in employment and housing. The law mandates accessibility to urban public transportation but not to intercity buses. Most train stations maintain access for persons with disabilities; however, many buses still do not have such access. Television stations include subtitles or sign language, and the courts accommodate testimony from persons with intellectual disabilities or mental illness. Tourists will find restaurants, foot paths, and public transportation less accessible than in the United States.\n\nPA law prohibits discrimination based on disability. The Palestinian Disability Law was ratified in 1999, but implementation has been slow. It does not mandate access to buildings, information, or communications. Palestinians with disabilities continue to receive uneven and poor-quality services and care. Familial and societal discrimination against persons with disabilities exists in both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\n\nStudents: See our Students Abroad page and FBI travel tips.\n\nWomen Travelers: See our travel tips for Women Travelers."
