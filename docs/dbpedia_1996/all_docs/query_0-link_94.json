The founding editor, Uzi Benziman, accompanied by Prof. Yaron Ezrahi, formed a crew of senior writers ‒ Nahum Barnea, Carmit Guy and Rafi Mann ‒ who shared The Seventh Eye's pages with young journalists as well as contributing columnists and academics.\n\nThe Magazine quickly became the most significant arena for honest and constructive dialogue on the challenges facing the Israeli media ‒ a journal in which journalists evaluate and criticize the media's performance, raise ethical questions, and discuss issues in the Israeli media, as well as publish new facts and groundbreaking original reporting.\n\nIn 2008, after 70 print issues, this pioneer of journalistic self-criticism abandoned its printed format and was transformed into a vibrant website. Now an online magazine, The Seventh Eye exposes the inner workings of the media, offers new perspectives on media ethics, and empowers journalists to fulfill their role as watchdogs of Israel's embattled democracy. Its articles are cited frequently in Supreme Court rulings, Knesset position papers and debates, and academic research. The Seventh Eye it is often quoted by the media.\n\nThe Seventh Eye also plays a central role in training the next generation of Israeli media professionals. A valuable teaching tool in academic programs in communications, it serves as a resource for faculty and students of journalism, communications, and political science.\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Seventh Eye was founded and funded by The Israeli Democracy Institute, its publisher throughout the years 1996‒2015. Between 2010‒2012 it was partly funded by The College of Management ‒ Academic Studies (COMAS)."
