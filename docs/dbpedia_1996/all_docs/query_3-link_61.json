        "text": "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the newly chosen Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar has the power to ensure that a cease-fire deal is reached for the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Palestinian militant group on Tuesday chose Sinwar, its top official in Gaza who masterminded the Oct. 7 attacks in Israel, after political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed July 31 in Iran by a presumed Israeli strike.\n\nRegional tensions have soared after Haniyeh’s killing, which Iran blamed on Israel, and retaliation has been expected. Concerns are also high after Israel killed a top Hezbollah commander in Lebanon last week.\n\nAmid diplomatic efforts, U.S. President Joe Biden spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi on Tuesday about their hopes for a cease-fire deal calming tensions in the Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet over the weekend that Israel is already in a “multi-front war” with Iran and its proxies.\n\nGaza faces a severe humanitarian crisis with Israeli restrictions on aid and ongoing fighting limiting access to crucial medical, food and other supplies. The Health Ministry says the death toll in the territory is nearing 40,000.\n\n___\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nEgypt tells airlines to avoid flying over Tehran for a 3-hour window on Thursday\n\nCAIRO — As tensions between Israel and Iran escalate, Egypt has issued a safety notice warning all of its carriers to avoid Iranian air space for a three-hour window early Thursday.\n\nA NOTAM, or notice to air missions, that was posted for pilots Wednesday states that all Egyptian carriers should avoid Tehran’s Flight Information Region and that “no flight plan will be accepted overflying such territory” between 1:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. GMT Thursday morning.\n\nIn a statement, Egypt’s Civil Aviation Ministry said the warning came after Iran warned all airliners flying over the Iranian territories about military exercises on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nOPSGroup, an organization for the aviation industry, said in an alert posted on social media platform X Wednesday that “such a (NOTAM) from Egypt is very unusual.”\n\n“It is possible that this is an indicator of an Iranian response to Israel, and in turn a potentially large set of airspace disruptions — at the same time, there may be another reason,” OPSGroup wrote, adding that it urged close monitoring.\n\nIan Petchenik, director of communications at Flightradar24, agreed that the NOTAM was unusual -- but said “it’s not surprising that Egypt would want to prevent any of its aircraft from any danger” given developments in the region seen over recent weeks. Still, he found the notice to be interesting because, generally speaking, Egyptian carriers already avoid Iranian air space, he said.\n\n“What we’re seeing now is normal traffic for the region, the time of day (and) time of week,” Petchenik told The Associated Press on Wednesday afternoon. But if carriers like Emirates, which regularly fly through region’s airspace, alter their paths -- or we stop seeing aircraft in western Iran and Iraq ahead of any additional NOTAMs “then that’s an indication that airlines are taking this very seriously,” he said.\n\nPetchenik and others note that several airlines have already individually alerted or changed select flight paths in the Middle East over the last two weeks — with some temporarily suspending flights in and out of Israel and Lebanon as well. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Lufthansa group extended its avoidance of Iranian and Iraqi airspace up to and including August 13.\n\nThe Germany-based air travel giant said it would also suspend flights to and from Tel Aviv, Tehran, Beirut, Amman and the Iraqi city of Erbil up to and including Aug. 13, Reuters reported, citing its latest security analysis.\n\nLufthansa did not immediately respond to the AP’s request for comment Wednesday.\n\nFrance’s Macron urges Iran’s president to do ‘everything in his power’ to avoid escalation\n\nPARIS — French President Emmanuel Macron had a phone call with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian during which he expressed his “deep concern at the rising tensions in the region,” Macron’s office said in a statement.\n\nMacron called on Pezeshkian “to do everything in his power to avoid a new military escalation, which would be in nobody’s interest, including Iran’s, and would do lasting damage to regional stability,” the statement said.\n\nThe French president also reiterated France’s position in favor of an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and a firm refusal of any escalation with Lebanon. Macron called for “the immediate release” of French nationals “held hostage” in Iran, the statement said.\n\nMacron spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Emirati President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman earlier this week.\n\nHamas praises Turkey for joining South Africa’s genocide lawsuit against Isreal\n\nHamas on Wednesday welcomed Turkey’s decision to join South Africa’s genocide lawsuit against Isreal at the International Court of Justice.\n\nThe Palestinian militant group said the Turkish move affirms President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s support to the Palestine cause.\n\nTurkey on Wednesday became the latest nation seeking to participate in the case. Spain, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua and Libya have also asked to join the case.\n\nErdogan, one of the fiercest critics of Israel’s actions in Gaza, has accused Israel of genocide, has called for it to be punished in international courts and has criticized Western nations for backing Israel.\n\nIsrael says a drone strike killed a Hezbollah commander in southern Lebanon\n\nNAHARIYA, Israel — Israel’s military says it has killed a Hezbollah commander in an airstrike in southern Lebanon, as tensions rise along the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\nThe army said Hassan Fares Jeshi was killed in a drone attack in the town of Jouayyas and described him as a commander in the militant group’s anti-tank missile unit. Hezbollah confirmed Jeshi’s death but gave no details about his position.\n\nThere have been months of near-daily attacks along the border. Both sides are bracing for a potentially significant escalation after the killings last week of a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut and the Hamas political leader in Iran.\n\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for the strike in Beirut “no matter the consequences.” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant warned that Nasrallah might cause Lebanon “to pay very, very heavy prices” and warned that the process may deteriorate into war. “That’s not theoretical, it’s real,” he said.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes kill 8 in Khan Younis as Gaza toll nears 40,000\n\nCAIRO — Hospital authorities say two Israeli airstrikes have killed at least eight people in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The first strike hit a house in a refugee camp in the city’s west, killing three people, according to Nasser hospital, where the bodies were taken. A second strike hit tents for displaced people in the Absa area east of Khan Younis, killing five.\n\nThe overall Palestinian death toll from the Israel-Hamas war has risen to at least 39,677, Gaza’s Health Ministry says, with another 91,645 wounded. The ministry doesn’t distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.\n\nProtesters disrupt Israeli court hearing about alleged abuse of Palestinian detainees\n\nJERUSALEM — Protesters disrupted an Israeli Supreme Court hearing Wednesday about a shadowy military facility where Israel has held Palestinian detainees throughout the war in Gaza.\n\nThe protesters yelled “Shame!” as the attorney for a number of Israeli human rights groups argued that the Sde Teiman facility should be closed permanently over repeated allegations of detainee abuse. An Associated Press investigation into the facility, as well as others by rights groups, found detainees endured abysmal conditions there.\n\nThe Israeli military said July 29 that it detained nine soldiers for questioning following allegations of “substantial abuse” of a detainee at Sde Teiman, located in southern Israel. The arrests prompted an outcry from right-wing government officials, and several hundred protesters swarmed the military base where the detained soldiers were held, calling the arrests an affront to their service.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Israel’s Channel 12 aired what it said was security camera footage from Sde Teiman that showed several soldiers moving a detainee to the side of a large hall where other detainees are seen laying on the floor on their fronts with their hands over their heads. In footage from a different angle, the soldiers are shown in a huddle and lifting up protective shields, apparently concealing the detainee from view, the report said. Channel 12 said the video was part of the investigation into alleged sexual assault.\n\nThe military has generally denied ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees, though a United Nations human rights office issued a report accusing Israel of mistreating Palestinian prisoners. Following the accusations of harsh treatment that prompted this court case, Israel said it was transferring the bulk of Palestinian detainees out of Sde Teiman and upgrading it. According to testimony during the hearing, there are currently around 30 Palestinians being held at Sde Teiman on a daily basis.\n\nThe human rights organizations that brought the case argued that the entire facility should be closed because it does not meet minimum humanitarian standards for detainees. It was not immediately clear when a ruling was expected.\n\nTurkey will submit a request to join the genocide case against Israel\n\nANKARA, Turkey — Turkey will file a request Wednesday with a United Nations court to join South Africa’s genocide lawsuit against Israel, a Turkish official said.\n\nThe declaration of intervention will be submitted at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, the official said on condition of anonymity in line with regulations that bar officials from speaking to the media without prior authorization.\n\nSouth Africa brought a case to the International Court of Justice late last year, accusing Israel of violating the genocide convention through its military operations in Gaza. Nicaragua, Colombia, Libya, Mexico, Spain and Palestinian officials have sought to join the case. The court’s decision on their requests is still pending. If admitted to the case, the countries would be able to make written submissions and speak at public hearings.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has frequently compared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Adolf Hitler, accused his country of genocide, called for it to be punished in international courts, and criticized Western nations for backing Israel.\n\nIsrael has strongly rejected accusations of genocide and has argued that the war in Gaza is a legitimate defensive action against Hamas militants for their Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel that killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostages.\n\nPreliminary hearings have already been held in the genocide case against Israel, but the court is expected to take years to reach a final decision.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalist Suzan Fraser contributed.\n\nUS ambassador to Japan skips atomic bomb memorial in Nagasaki because Israel not invited\n\nTOKYO — United States Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel will skip this year’s atomic bombing memorial service in Nagasaki because Israel was not invited, the embassy said Wednesday.\n\nEmanuel will not attend the event because it was “politicized” by Nagasaki’s decision not to invite Israel, the embassy said. He will instead honor the victims of the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima on Aug. 9, 1945, at a ceremony at a Buddhist temple in Tokyo. Some 70,000 people were killed, and Japan surrendered soon after on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and the country’s nearly half-century of aggression in Asia.\n\nNagasaki Mayor Shiro Suzuki indicated in July his reluctance to invite Israel, and announced last week that it was not invited, noting concern for “possible unforeseen situations.” Nagasaki hoped to conduct the ceremony “in a peaceful and solemn atmosphere,” he said.\n\nIn contrast, Hiroshima invited the Israeli ambassador to Japan to Tuesday’s ceremony, among 50,000 attendants that also included Emanuel and other envoys, though Palestinian representatives were not invited. The United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, killing 140,000 people and destroying the city.\n\nUS-led airstrikes hit Houthi-controlled territory, Iran-backed rebels say\n\nCAIRO — Yemen’s Houthis say a United States-led coalition carried out two airstrikes late Tuesday in territory controlled by the Iran-backed rebels.\n\nThe region is bracing for a potential counterattack by Iran and its allies following the killing of top militants in Beirut and Tehran, in strikes attributed to Israel.\n\nThe Houthis’ military media office said the strikes occurred in the Taiz province without providing further detail. There was no immediate comment from the U.S. military.\n\nThe Houthis have launched several long-range missile and drone attacks targeting Israel since the start of the war in Gaza and have attacked international shipping in the Red Sea, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians. A U.S.-led coalition began launching airstrikes against the rebels in Yemen in January.\n\nIsrael has intercepted nearly all the projectiles fired from Yemen, but a rare direct hit on Tel Aviv in July killed one person and wounded 10. Israel responded with airstrikes on Yemen that the Houthi-run Health Ministry said killed six people and wounded more than 80.\n\nThe Houthis paused their attacks for around two weeks but launched a missile at a container ship over the weekend.\n\nIsrael issues new evacuation orders for an area in northern Gaza\n\nJERUSALEM — The Israeli military issued new evacuation orders Wednesday for an area in northern Gaza that was heavily bombed at the start of the war some 10 months ago.\n\nThe military said it would respond to a Hamas rocket attack from the Beit Hanoun area the day before and urged residents to relocate to Gaza City, large areas of which have been destroyed.\n\nBeit Hanoun, which is close to the border, was one of the first targets of the massive bombardment and ground invasion launched after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack, which triggered the war.\n\nIsraeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas where past air and ground operations caused widespread destruction, as militants have regrouped. The vast majority of Gaza’s 2.3 million people have been displaced within the narrow coastal strip since the start of the war — often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are sheltering in crowded tent camps.\n\nHamas’ new political leader has the power to ensure cease-fire deal, Blinken says\n\nWASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7 attack who is becoming Hamas’ new political leader, has the power to ensure that a cease-fire deal is reached.\n\nSinwar “has been and remains the primary decider when it comes to concluding the cease-fire, and so I think this (today’s announcement) only underscores the fact that it’s really on him to decide whether to move forward with a cease-fire that manifestly will help so many Palestinians in desperate need, women, children, men who are caught in a crossfire,” Blinken said. “It really is on him.”"
