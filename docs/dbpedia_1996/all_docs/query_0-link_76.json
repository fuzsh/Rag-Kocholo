        "text": "The shadowy Hamas military commander in Gaza known as The Guest has dodged seven Israeli assassination attempts during decades atop its most wanted list.\n\nTheir eighth might have finally killed him after years of living underground and plotting attacks from the shadows.\n\nEfforts to find and kill Mohammed Deif intensified following the October 7 attack, which Israel believes he orchestrated.\n\nSo when Israeli security services said they had obtained fresh intelligence that Deif was inside a humanitarian safe zone in southern Gaza late last week — a strike was ordered directly by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nA few hours later, Israel launched a massive and deadly bombardment into the Al-Mawasi area, where Palestinians had been told to flee to escape fighting, targeting what the military said was a Hamas compound.\n\nGazan health authorities said the strikes killed more than 90 Palestinians and injured more than 300 others.\n\nBut Israeli authorities still don't know if Deif is dead or alive.\n\nLoading...\n\nWho is The Guest?\n\nHis nickname was taken from his nom de guerre — Deif means guest in Arabic.\n\nIt references his habit of continually moving about to avoid detection, staying with different people only ever as a short-term guest.\n\nAs his name and slippery tactics suggest, Deif is a largely elusive and secretive figure who rarely appears in public, and there are few images of him.\n\nThe 58-year-old was one of the founders of Hamas' military wing in Gaza and has led the force for more than 20 years.\n\nThroughout the last nine-months of fighting, he has been directing militant operations from underground and other secret locations, rarely going above ground to stay hidden, according to Israeli authorities.\n\nThroughout the war, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) has reportedly distributed flyers across Gaza offering rewards upwards of $US100,000 ($148,000) for information on the whereabouts of senior Hamas figures, including Deif.\n\nBut even before October 7, he had been on Israel's most wanted list for nearly three decades for his role in planning and executing several militant attacks inside Israel, including the deaths of dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings.\n\nHow Israel's most wanted man survived assassination attempts\n\nFor Deif, staying in the shadows has been a matter of life or death.\n\nHe has survived at least seven assassination attempts by Israel over the past few decades.\n\nBut he has had some close calls.\n\nIn 2002, an Israeli military helicopter fired a missile on a car he was driving in Gaza.\n\nDeif crawled away alive but lost an eye. His arm was also permanently injured.\n\nIn 2006, Israel tried again, firing a missile at a building in Gaza where Hamas leaders had gathered.\n\nDeif was seriously injured but escaped alive.\n\nIn another failed attempt to take Deif's life in 2014, his wife and seven-month-old son were killed in an Israeli strike on a house in Gaza.\n\nOther family members have also been targeted.\n\nAccording to the military, the last two known attempts to eliminate Deif were in 2021 when Israel and Palestinian militant groups fought an 11-day war, which Israel named Operation Guardian of the Walls.\n\nDeif survived.\n\nThat earned him another nickname the \"cat with nine lives\", and helped elevate him to almost-superhero status within Palestinian militant circles.\n\nDespite his notoriety, many people in Gaza would not recognise Deif if he walked the streets amongst them.\n\nIn rare video appearances he has only been seen as a shadow — or masked.\n\nIt's believed he has been living most of his recent years in Gaza's vast underground tunnel network, using them to constantly shift about to avoid detection.\n\nBut after months of surveillance, Israel said it had spotted Deif in a rare moment above ground.\n\nAnd it was ready to act.\n\nThe operation that may have gotten The Guest\n\nIsrael hasn't revealed a lot about the latest assassination attempt on Deif publicly.\n\nBut security sources have been whispering to journalists in Israel and abroad about how the operation to target Deif unfolded.\n\nIt goes something like this, according to Hebrew media.\n\nIsraeli security forces, including the Shin Bet, had been trying to track Deif's movements for months.\n\nThey were hoping he would eventually visit another high-ranking Hamas official they have been tracking — the commander of the Khan Younis Brigades, Rafa Salama.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that Israeli security officials received a tip that Deif was in Salama's compound in the Al-Mawasi/Khan Younis area on Friday July 12.\n\nThe information was quickly relayed up through the ranks to Mr Netanyahu.\n\nHe ordered fighter jets to demolish the compound.\n\nAt 10am the next day, Israel struck.\n\nAmerican media reported security forces used at least five US made precision-guided bombs in the attack on and around the compound.\n\nGazan authorities said the strike killed more than 90 Palestinians.\n\nAn Israeli military official told the ABC security forces had carried out a \"precise\" and \"targeted\" strike after gathering intelligence that Deif and Salama had been operating from there, and that they were being guarded by several other militants.\n\nIsrael supplied before-and-after aerial photos, showing a fenced-off compound filled with trees and a few structures that were completely erased after the bombing.\n\nSocial media videos posted by Gazans on the ground showed death and destruction outside of that compound, and at least one massive crater in the ground.\n\nDisplaced people sheltering in the area said their tents had been torn down by the force of the strike, describing bodies and body parts strewn across the ground.\n\nIsrael said the bombardment killed Salama.\n\nDeif's fate is still unknown — and it might be difficult for Israel to find out.\n\nWhy isn't Israel sure if Deif is dead?\n\nAfter an initial briefing to journalists on the evening of the strike, an IDF official said there would be more updates in the following days.\n\nThose updates haven't yet happened – likely because Israel has not been able to verify whether it has actually killed Deif.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Hebrew newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported the Gaza hospital where the injured and dead were taken had been \"put under siege by Hamas to make it difficult for IDF to identify bodies and whether one of them is Deif's\".\n\nIsraeli officials have previously revealed some of the tactics they have used to monitor what's been happening on the ground in Gaza – including the use of Palestinian collaborators, and planting undercover Israeli operatives inside the strip posing as Gazans — sometimes even living there.\n\nBut the extent of damage at the site will make it hard to confirm that Deif was among those killed.\n\nHamas has rejected Israeli's claim that the strike was meant to target senior militant leaders.\n\n\"The occupation's claims about targeting leaders are false.This is not the first time the occupation has claimed to target Palestinian leaders, and later it is proven to be a lie,\" Hamas said in a statement.\n\n\"These false claims are merely a cover-up for the scale of the horrific massacre.\"\n\nIt would be politically and strategically advantageous for Hamas to create ambiguity around Deif's status.\n\nAfter the assassination attempt, the AFP news wire reported that a senior Hamas official said Deif was \"fine\" and \"directly supervising the operations of the military wing\".\n\nWith fighting now in its ninth month in Gaza, Israel has been facing pressure over its military success there, where it promised to hunt and kill senior Hamas leaders, including Deif.\n\nIf he is dead, it will be the highest-ranking Hamas leader in Gaza to have been killed by Israel since it began its military campaign inside the Palestinian enclave.\n\nOr he may have slipped back into the shadows."
