        "text": "Israel, July 1-22, 2025\n\nLondon, July 28 – Aug. 6, 2024\n\nAnnual Maccabi USA\n\nFreddy Cohen Memorial Golf Outing – Aug. 19, 2024\n\n—\n\nInaugural Maccabi USA Reunion – Sept. 29, 2024\n\n—\n\nMaccabiah – July 2025\n\nClick below to visit “Kurtz’s Corner” – a weekly journal entry started by Dan Kurtz, Maccabi USA’s Senior Director of Strategic Initiatives, immediately after the October 7th terrorist attack in Israel..\n\nBe sure to check out our new section “Shlicha Stories”\n\nwhich features weekly insights, perspectives and heartfelt thoughts\n\nfrom Maccabi USA’s Shlicha (“Emissary”) Lior Witlin.\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Hamas’s horrific terrorist attack killed 1,200 Israelis, wounded 5,000 others, and took 240 civilians hostage.\n\nMaccabi World Union and the Maccabiah embarked upon a campaign to house, feed, clothe, and provide essential counseling and other services to 800 Israeli evacuees, as well as leverage the power of the international sports community to keep attention focused on the hostage crisis. We succeeded in providing enough support to bridge the 10-month gap in caring for displaced Israelis before the Israeli government stepped in to fund the project. Thank you to all those who helped!\n\n‏‏#SportSpeaksUp\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nMaccabi USA builds Jewish pride through sports and promotes support for Israel, Zionism, and Jewish continuity through athletic, educational, and cultural experiences for participants of all ages.\n\nOUR VISION\n\nMaccabi USA envisions a world where sports serve as a galvanizing force in strengthening Jewish pride, connection, and community.\n\nOUR IMPACT\n\nIn Their Own Words: 21st Maccabiah Stories\n\nMaccabi USA strengthens connections to Jewish identity, community, and Israel. But don’t just take our word for it. Let our athletes, coaches, and staff tell you how the Maccabiah impacted their journeys.\n\nSTUART WEITZMAN\n\nSCHOLARSHIP FUND\n\nGenerations of young Jewish athletes in financial need can now enjoy a life-changing Maccabiah experience thanks to iconic shoe designer and 4-time Maccabi USA Table Tennis alum, Stuart Weitzman. Maccabi USA’s flag bearer at the 21st Maccabiah provided a matching gift of $4.5M that spurred $2.5M in additional donations and is the largest gift in the organization’s history. Please enjoy our tribute to Stuart!\n\n‘MACK-A-BEE’ or ‘MUH-CAH-BEE’?\n\nIt’s a debate as old as the American Maccabi movement. While the proper pronunciation for the global movement using sports to engage the Jewish People is officially “Muh-cah-bee,” many people say it differently. Take a look as our most recent ‘Legends of the Maccabiah’ inductees go back-and-forth on the friendly controversy.\n\nStay Up To Date With Our Social Media\n\nmaccabiusa\n\nCongratulations again to all of our USA teams that won gold!
