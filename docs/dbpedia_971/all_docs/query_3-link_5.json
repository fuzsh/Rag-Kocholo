On 11 September 1888 at the Royal Palace of Turin she married Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, the former king of Spain. Maria Letizia became the Duchess of Aosta, Duke of Aosta being a title by which Amadeus was known before and after his kingship. Their marriage was instrumental in almost reviving French hopes of reinstating the Bonaparte dynasty into a position of power, as seen in the days of Napoleon III.\n\nThe couple lived in Turin and had one son: Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi (22 June 1889 - 19 October 1918). He was killed during World War I. Maria Letizia became widowed soon after their wedding, as Amadeus died less than two years after their marriage in Turin, on 18 January 1890.\n\nDuring her widowhood, Maria Letizia maintained an open and scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.\n\nLink to Wikipedia biography\n\nRelationships\n\nspouse relationship with Amadeo I, King of Spain (born 30 May 1845).
