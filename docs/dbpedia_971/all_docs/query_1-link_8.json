Left a widow in 1785, she continued to reside in Corsica until 1793, when she removed to Marseilles, France. In this city she lived in straitened circumstances. After her son Napoleon became First Consul, she fixed her residence at Paris, France, and had a separate establishment assigned to her, even though she had little taste for ostentation.[1]\n\nAll things considered, she conducted herself with great discretion, performing her part becomingly in the station to which she had been so unexpectedly elevated, and never allowing herself to forget that the sudden rise of her family might one day be terminated by an equally sudden fall. She joined the Emperor in his exile in Elba in 1814, and after the events at Waterloo she retired to Rome and resided in the household of her stepbrother, Cardinal Fesch. There she collected most of the surviving members of her family around her and lived to the advanced age of 86, dying in Rome on 2 February 1836.[1]\n\nChildren[]\n\nBy her marriage with Carlo Buonaparte, Letizia produced eight children who lived to see their adulthood.[1]\n\nJoseph I, Emperor of Spain[1]\n\nNapoleon I, Emperor of the French[1]\n\nMaria Anna, afterward called Elise, Princess of Lucca and Piombino, and wife of Prince Bacciocchi[1]\n\nLucien, Prince of Canino[1]\n\nLouis, King of Holland[1]\n\nCarlotta, afterward named Marie Pauline[1]\n\nCaroline, wife of Murat, King of Naples[1]\n\nJérôme, King of Westphalia[1]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
