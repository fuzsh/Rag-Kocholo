BEFORE INDEPENDENCE’S PROCLAMATION\n\nA.Page 01-01 The Japanese surrender Informations\n\nEarly August 1945:\n\nThe Shimoda detachment of the First Special Attack Force (12 Kairyu type midgets) receives a report about the sighting of an American submarine shelling Mikimoto lighthouse, off Shimoda harbor. A Kairyu is diespatched to intercept the submarine, but fails to locate it.\n\n6 August 1945:\n\nAt 0815, Colonel (later Brig Gen) Paul W. Tibbetts’ B-29 “Superfortress”, nicknamed “ENOLA GAY”, of the 509th Composite Group, drops the 15-kiloton yield “Little Boy” uranium atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n\nColonel Tibbetts with B-29 ENOLA GAY\n\nThat same day, following TG 35.3’s bombardment of Kushimoto, four Kaitens are deployed from Otsujima base to Tanabe to be attached to the Sixth Special Attack Unit.\n\n8 August 1945:\n\nMoscow declares that from 9 August 1945, the Soviet Government will consider itself to be at war with Japan.\n\n9 August 1945:\n\nAt 1101, Major (later Brig Gen, ANG) Charles W. Sweeney’s B-29 “BOCKSCAR”, of the 509th Composite Group’s 393rd Bomb Squadron, drops the 21-kiloton yield “Fat Man” plutonium atomic bomb, on Nagasaki. [4]\n\nThat same day, carrying out Stalin’s pledge at Yalta, Marshal Aleksandr Vasilevsky, CINC, Soviet Far East Forces, launches Operation “August Storm”, the invasion of Japanese-held Manchuria (Manchukuo). The attack is made by three Soviet army groups (“fronts”) comprising 80 divisions of 1.5 million men. In less than two weeks, the Soviets defeat General Yamada Otsuzo’s depleted and ill-equipped Kwantung Army of over 600,000 men. [5]\n\n10 August 1945:\n\nJapan offers to surrender to the Allies, if Emperor Hirohito (Showa) is allowed to remain the nominal head of state.\n\n12 August 1945:\n\nThe United States announces it will accept the Japanese surrender and that the emperor can remain in a ceremonial capacity.\n\nShikoku, Kochi Prefecture. That same evening, the Suzaki kaiten detachment of the Eighth Special Attack Unit receives a report about the sighting of an enemy task force off Shionomisaki, Wakayama Prefecture. Based on that information the local IJA commander expects a landing at Tosa Bay the next morning. Two kaitens are immediately dispatched to Tosa Bay and sortie at 0600 the next morning, but fail to locate the enemy and return by 1000.\n\n13 August 1945:\n\nTokyo. At an evening conference attended by General Umezu Yoshijiro, Chief of the Army General Staff and Admiral Toyoda Soemu (33), (former CO of HYUGA), Chief of the Navy General Staff , the Vice Chief of the NGS, wild-eyed Vice Admiral Onishi Takijiro (40)(former XO of KAGA) proposes “that if we are willing to sacrifice 20 million Japanese lives in special attacks (kamikaze), victory can still be achieved!”\n\n14 August 1945:\n\nTokyo. At 1020, the emperor convenes a conference of his most senior military officers. Field Marshall Hata, freshly arrived from Hiroshima, expresses no confidence in Japan continuing the war over appeals from such strong-willed, arrogant personalities as Field Marshal Sugiyama Hajime and Fleet Admiral Nagano Osami who exhibit a dull-witted state of denial. The emperor dismisses their protestations for protracted carnage.\n\nThe emperor notes that with the Soviet entry into the Pacific War and the enemy’s use of atomic weapons, not even Onishi’s Special Attack forces can stop them. He requests that his senior officers cooperate with him to end the war. Later, the Japanese announce that the emperor has decided to accept the Potsdam Declaration’s terms and end the War, effective the following day.\n\nThat same day, 167 B-29s of the 20th Air Force from Saipan bomb Hikari Naval Arsenal, Yamaguchi Prefecture. The raid is supported by North American P-51 “Mustang” fighters from Iwo Jima, attacking various targets in the same area until 1040 in the morning. 71.8 percent of the arsenal’s total roof area is destroyed. 738 workers, mostly mobilized middle school students, die in the attacks.\n\nEmperor Hirohito Reads an Imperial Rescript\n\nThe Dai Nippon Soldier hear the announcement\n\nthe allied forces very happy after hear the announcement\n\n15 August 1945: Cessation of Hostilities:\n\nImperial Palace, Tokyo. At noon, the emperor announces Japan’s surrender that is broadcast by radio all over the Japanese Empire.\n\nPort Arthur, Manchuria. Lost to Japan in 1905, the Soviet Navy Flag flies again on 22 August\n\n17 August 1945\n\nProclamation of Indonesian Independence\n\nThe Proclamation of Indonesian Independence (Indonesian: Proklamasi Kemerdekaan Indonesia, or simply Proklamasi) was read at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, August 17, 1945. The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed-resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia’s independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept 17 August 1945 as Indonesia’s independence date[1]\n\nSukarno and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed President and Vice-president, respectively, were the documents signatories.\n\nDeclaration event\n\nSukarno, accompanied by Mohammad Hatta (right), proclaiming the independence of Indonesia.\n\nThe draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of August 16, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi’s house, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the “Museum of the Declaration of Independence“, JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik.[2][3] Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia‘s independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia’s independence, scheduled for August 24.\n\nWhile the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on August 15 following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Soekarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation’s diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers ‘in the name of the nation of Indonesia’\n\nSoekarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Soekarno’s house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. In fact there was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, and the Japanese high command in Indonesia had given their permission for the nation’s independence. The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.Please read the details below.\n\n18 August 1945:\n\nThe Red Army makes three amphibious landings in northern Korea, one landing in Sakhalin and one at Shimushu, Kurile Islands. Korea is subsequently divided at the 38th parallel into Soviet and U.S. zones. After the surrender of the Kwantung Army in Manchuria, about 590,830 Japanese are sent to PoW camps in Siberia. [6]\n\nSurrender(National Archives)\n\n2 September 1945: Formal Surrender Ceremonies:\n\nTokyo Bay. Japanese representatives arrive on board USS MISSOURI (BB-63) more than two weeks after Japan accepted the Allies’ terms. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru and General Umezu Yoshijiro, Chief of the Army General Staff are in the front row. Witnessing the surrender on behalf of the IJN are Rear Admiral, the Baron, Tomioka Sadatoshi (former CO of OYODO)(middle row, behind Umezu), Rear Admiral Yokoyama Ichiro (former CO of KUMA)(back row, right) and Captain Shiba Katsuo (former CO of OI) (back row, behind Tomioka). The others present are the witnesses of the IJA and the Foreign Ministry. At about 0905, Shigemitsu and Umezu sign the Instrument of Surrender, followed by General of the Army, Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Forces, Fleet Admiral Chester A. Nimitz, representing the United States, and eight representatives of the Allied Forces.\n\nAt the time of surrender, 43 Kaiten torpedoes (mostly Type 1 or Type 1 Improved) are located at Otsujima base, 52 at Hikari, 39 at Hirao, 37 at Kure and 16 at Oga. All are destroyed or scuttled after the end of hostilities. 224 Kairyu submersibles were built by the end of war plus another 207 were in various stages of completion. In addition to about 115 Koryus built during the war, some 500 are found incomplete.\n\nWith the War’s end, Operation “Downfall” is cancelled. General of the Army George C. Marshall, CoS, U.S. Army, estimates up to one million casualties for the invasion of Japan, but a contemporary Army study estimates the invasion and subsequent Battle for Japan would have cost as many as four million American casualties, including up to 800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities.\n\nIf Downfall had become necessary and American forces were contested heavily in southern Japan, the Soviets most probably would have secured Hokkaido and invaded northern Honshu. This may have led to the vanquished nation’s partitioning into North and South Japan, as occurred in Korea and persists to this day.\n\nB.

Lost to Japan in 1905, the Soviet Navy Flag flies again on 22 August\n\n(2) August,14th.1945\n\nSukarno,Hatta and Dr Radjiman Wedijodiningrat were invited by the highest command Japanese Military in east Asia to Dalat (Indochina)\n\na)to recieved the decision of Japanese Government about Indonesia Independence. In the official meeting ,General Terauchi\n\nsaid :”Depand on your masters to decide when Indodesia will Independent”( Hatta,Legend and reality around Proclamation 17 Agustus,Mimbar Indonesia 17 Agustus 1951,no 32/33)\n\nb) On the 12th of August ( which happened to coincide with may birthday) MARSHAL TERAUCHI told us in Dalat (300 km from Saigon) the decision of the Japanese Government to give up the question of Indonesia’s Independence to the Committee for Preparation of Indonesian Independence.\n\nHe said : “It is you gentlemen who are to carry this out, and it is entirely up to you to decide its execution”.\n\nSukarno then asked :”It is right if we do it a week from now ?\n\n“It is up to you gentlemen” Answered Terauchi.\n\n(Yasni Z,Bung Hatta Anwers,1981,page 116)\n\nc) Field Marshal Terauchi\n\n(1) ,who waswn’t Indonesian’s friend ,Independence was forced by the government in Tokyo (gogle,internet).\n\n(2)the vintage photo of Field Marshal Terauchi and his room with Sukarno’s photo (P,google,internet)\n\nd)The vintage photo of Indonesian hero\n\n(1) Sukarno and Hatta during that time.\n\n(2) I haven’t found the photo of Dr Radjiman\n\ne) The Vintage picture postcard of Dalat and Saigon cochinchina ( Emperor Bodai’s palace were in Dalat and used by Marskal Terauchi as Dai Nippon East Asia Command administrations Building, and Saigon after vietnam liberation change name to be Ho Chi Minh City-read the Vietnam Document and Postal History-auth)\n\nb.Page 01-02\n\nMonday, August 13th 1945\n\n1)After returning from Dalat to Saigon,we heard that Russia had attacked Manchuria, and thus the blows against Japan were complete,coming from all direction(ibid yazni,page 117)\n\nc.Page 01-03\n\nTuesday, August .14th .1945\n\n1) when back from Dalat to Jakarta (Via Saigon and Singapore-auth),\n\n(1) the three delegations meet with Mr Teuku Hassan,Dr Amir and Mr Abbas , the member of PPKI (Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan) or the committee for the Preparation of Independence from Sumatra, which will departed with us to Djakarta.They have heard that Russian have anounced the War to Japan and in-vasion Mansjuria(Manchuria), After the discussion we have conclution that the Japanese were falling down willn’t in month and we must proclaimed Indonesia Independence fastly. ( they don’t know about the US “H”Bomb auth)(Ibid,Hatta,1951)\n\n(2 In the morning of August 14 , before we were to be flown back to Jakarta on a bomber, we met Dr Amir. He asked whether it was true that Russian had attacked Japan in Manchuria ? I said tjat it was right.Then Dr Amir said :” then it won’t be much longer”\n\nI said ,”That’s right.We are not counting in months anymore bur a most in just weeks . Psychollogy Japan had already lost, being attacked from the south and the North”(ibid Yasni ,p-117,1985)\n\n(3)So the three of us (Sukarno,Hatta and Radjiman) started home for Indonesia. In Singapore, we recieved an invitation from the Commander of the Japanese army there) . Delegates from North Sumatra (Dr Amir,Abbas and Hassan) were invited to a party by a lower level of the Japanese army leadership. We were invited by a higher level. It looked as though the Japanese were afraid for us to meet (ibid,Yasni,p 117,1984)\n\n(2 )Sukarno annouced that Independence will be fastly in Kemayoran airpot.\n\n(a)After came back at Jakarta, in Kemayoran airport (Kemayoran now the Jakarta Fair area, and Sukarno Hatta international airport in Cengkareng Tangerang-auth), sukarno have said in he front of many peoples “ In before I have said that our Independence before the “Jagung” berbuah”or seeds…., now I can concluded that. Independence before “Jagung” were flowered)” (ibid Hatta,1951)\n\n(b) When we arrived at Kemayoran airpot in Jakarta, we were met by the Gunseikan.\n\nWithout going home first, we were taken to the Palace to meet the Gunseikan. We were welcomed with a happy face and clear laughter by the Gunsereikan , and had dinner with high –ranked Japanese authoritied, there were even a toast and congratulation over “Indonesia Independence” (Yasni,p-117,1984)\n\n(3) Emperor Hirohito asked the Dai Nippon Military surrendered to allied Army(D)\n\n(4) Sjahrir Told Hatta that Japanese have aksed peace to Allied Armed Forces and suggest Sukarno annouced via radio Indonesia Independence.\n\n(a)In the afternoon 14th Agustus , Sjahrir came to told me that Japanese have asked peace to Allied, and he asked how about our Independence ? I have aswered our Independence was on our hands.\n\nThe Sjahrir’s opinion,that the Indonesia Indepen-dence proclamation willn’t by the commitee of preparation Indonesian Independecde because the allied Army will said that the birth of Republic of Indonesia was made by the Japanese. Better only Sukarno himself annouced as the leader under the people’s named via Radio.(ibid,Hatta,1951)\n\n(b) This party was over around 1.30 in the afternoon. Only then did we go home.At Home I found Syahrir waiting. “How was it?”he said .\n\nI said that the japanese had given the matter up to us. Then Syahrir said that it would be better if the proclamation of Independence were not made by the Committee for the Preparationb of Independence, because Japan had already surrendered, whilst the Committee were made by Japan. It would be better if the proclamation were made just by Bung Karno.\n\nI said , would he want to do that, because, after all, he was the Chairman of that Committee. I phoned Bung Karno tight away. I asked :”You weren’t asleep yet?”.Bung Karno answered :”No,not yet” Then I said :”Something important has come up, Syahrir and I would like to come now for a few minutes”. Bung karno said :”Alright,please comenow”\n\nSyahrir and I went there immedietely. Bung Karno was waiting for us. Syahrir then suggested that Bung Karno himself should make the proclamation. Sukarno said that, however things might be, it would not be right for him to seize the opportunity himself in this matter without acting together with the Committee.\n\nSyahrir said that with the regard to this matter, Bung Karno should act as leader of the people, while the Committee was made by Japan.\n\nAgain Bung Karno said that no matter how things might be, we had cooperated with the Japanese for quite a long time.\n\nBung Karno also said at that time that he did not yet know for certain and was not yet convinced that the Japanese had surrendered already, as Syahrir said.\n\n“All right then , tommorow,together with Bung Hatta, I’ll go yo the Gunseikanbu to make inquiries; that won’t be too late ,will it?” Bung karno said. Said Syahrir ,”No,that won’t be too late”.(Yasni,1984,p-118)\n\nd.Page 01-04.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nWENDSDAY-AUGUST 15th 1945\n\n(1) Dai Nippon Military official surender was signed on the US Arrmed forces USS”Missouri” in september 1945,the official photo (D)\n\n(2) Although Dai Nippon was officially surrendered, the Dai Nippon Military Administration still exist in Indonesia\n\n(,they have waited to give the power to Allied army, but the allied army very late came to Indonesia, that is way the Japanese Military Administration still exist until The British Army under allied army came. The unique and postal history collection will proved that situation-auth)\n\n1.In 15th August,\n\n(a)the Japanese have asked” Peace” to Allied Armed forces( they didn.t like to say “Surren-dered”,may be they ashamed and still had the power -auth), that is way we dicided\n\n(b) to invited the member of PPPK (Indonesia Independence prepatory Committee) to have the meeting at 10.00 morning in the Sanyo Office at Pejambon 2.\n\n(c) Indonesia Indepence Proclamation must be announce as fast as we could, the Indonesia National Basic Law (UUD) must be “Mufakat” without any discussed and the Indonesia Governerment at Central and Regional area must be done in several days only.\n\n(d) The PPKI’s members from regional area must came back to their area with bring the complete instructions from the Indonesia Independence Government. If they back latetly,may be the Japanese will banned them backhome because the Japanese have the powered from the Allied Army( Jurukuasa underpower.)\n\n(e) That True Japanese had aggreed Indonesian Independence, but may be the allied army will asked the Japanese army to liquidatied Indonesia and will tried to gave back to Dutch East Indie Government.\n\n(f) Organized revolution must exist, then Indonesion Independence could resisted with all Indonesian people’s struggled. Depend on this ,then I am “menentang” or against the Youngman,Peta and peoples’s “Merebut Kekuasaan” or Fight the Power theory, that suggested in the afternoon by in memoriam Subianto and subadio, the Parlemen’s member now.\n\n(g)The fight of Power must be after the Independence Proclamation by Bung karno via Radio.To the two Men I said that I like Revulution, but against the “Putsch”or Rebellion.The Young men didn’t sustified to this explenation but latter they have said that that were true and Subianto have done my special tasked until he was died in Serpong. (ibid Hatta,1951)\n\n2.The following morning (15th August 1945)\n\nwe went to the Gunseikanbu,( Dai nippon Military Administration Headquaters , the present Pertamina building-auth). There was nobody there. Except for a single Lieutenant by the name of Nomura, If I’m not mistaken.\n\nEverybody had been summoned to the Gunserei-kanbu .I thought, the Japanese had indeed already surrendered.\n\nSubardjo, assistant to Admiral Tadashi Maeda,\n\nwho was also with us at the time suggested that we go straight away to Admiral Maeda. Which we did, and we met Maeda.(in 1946 Maera was arrested by the Allied army,in 1946 bring backhome to japan as ther retired Navy, and in 1976 he had gave Indonesia Narariya Star Medal by Indonesian Gverment, and in 1977 he was pass away-info from samsi jacobalis book,2000)\n\nBung karno asked whether the rumours were true, the Japan had surrendered .Maeda was silent , for sevela minutes he did not anwer and his head was bowed. I pinched Bung Karno and whispered :”It looks as if the rumours are true”\n\nIn the end , Maeda drew a long breath and said :” According to Allied broadcasts,yes.But we have not yet recieved any instruction at all from Tokyo. It is those instructions from Tokyo that are decive”(He didn’t told that The Tenno Haika Hirohito asked the Military to Surrender –auth)\n\nAfter that we took leave from Maeda. As you know, Bung Karno was Chairman of The Preparatory Commi-tee, I was the Vice Chairmain, and for daily activity Siebardjo assited us. I told Soebardjo to call a meeting of all members of the Prepatory Committee for the morning of 16th August 1945 at Pejambon (now Foreign affair Ministry office-auth) Soebardjo called all the members by phone: they were all staying in the Hotel Des Indes.\n\n(d)In the afternoon of 15th August\n\nTwo people came to my house, Soebianto (margono’s son) and soebadio. Both urged me to influence Soekarno to be willing to make the proclamation on behalf ofthe leaders of the people. Not on behalf of the Prepatory Committee, because ita was made by Japan.\n\nI said that this depneded on Soekarno himself. I wondered whether he would want to do what or not. But I was afraid he would not want to, because he was the Chairman of that committee. If be stepped foward alone, he woulkd be usurping other people’s right. Maybe he wouldnot want to do that.\n\nSoebianto and Soebadio continued to press me and said :” If you pres him, of course Bung Karno will do it.”I said :” On what grounds would I press him? He,myself, the member of the Committee, all have worked together with the Japanese, but if there somebody who will make the proclamation who ever never cooperated with the Japanese, it be best for him just vto do it.\n\nWe continue to argue, at the end those two people said : “Well, in arevolutionary period, Bung Hatta cannot be brought in.” I answered :” That is not how it is. I am now preparing a revolution. The revolution has not begun yet. We are preparing for it. I don not want to make a Putsch as Hitler did in Germany, which failed . If we act , we must succeed” then the two went away.\n\nIt shloud also be said here,that on the night of 15 august, in preparation fdor the meetinmg of the Prepatory Committee next morning in 16 August, I typed out the opening of the Constitution to be used as the text for proclamation.\n\nWhile I was typing, Soebardjo came in, it was about eight o’clock at night.He said,”Bung Karno is being attacked by the youth. We should go there together “. So I went in Soebardjo’s car because my driver was not there.Wikana talked a lot. Wikana insisted that the proclamation should be made the same night (The night of August 15th).\n\nSoekarno sait it could not de done because it was only tomorrow (August 16th) that we were going to have a meeting. Wikana said, we do not want the proclamation made by the Prepatory Committee is rgarded as made by Japan. I said, if the Prepatory Committee is regarded as made by Japan,Bung Karno and I, and also many other leaders, have been cooperatin with the Japanese for a long time.So if things are like this, it is neccessary to look for somebody to make the proclamation, chosen from among who have never cooperated with the Japanese.\n\nAnd we will back them up. But the youth still wanted Bung karno to do it. At the time Wikana said,that, if by twelve midninght Bung karno had not proclaimed the Indepnedence of Indonesia the on the following morning(16 August 1945) there would be bloodshed.\n\nThen Bung karno became angry.He stood up straight away and went up to Wikana, and, pointing to his neck, Bung karno said :” Here is my neck. You needn’t wait till tomorrow. Take me down and finishe me off this very night.”\n\n“ Oh,that’s not what I mean,Bung” said Wikana.”Then ,what do you mean ?”.”The people and our youth will rebel and will start killing the Ambonese here”, said Wikana.\n\nThen I put in ,:”Why the Ambonese? You want to start a revolution, why do it by killing your own people , you want to kill innocent people? He answered :’ Well, the Ambonese are considered to be NICA (Netherlands Indische Civil Agency-auth) , aqccomplices of the Dutch”. I said :” That’s only what people think. For some time already, they have worked together with us, and now you want tokill them? What sort of way is that ?”\n\nTEMPERS WERE RUNNING HIGH, the I SUGGESTED TO Bung Karno that the four of us should talk inside. These four were Bung karno, myself,Dr Boentaran and soebardjo. For fifteen minutes we talked in another room at Pegansaan Timur, I suggested to Bung Karno that he should tell thoise young people to find someone from among themselves who had never cooperated with Japanese to make the proclamation, and we would state we would(shall?) back them up to the full. Let them makes the proclamation.\n\nAfter about fifteen minutes we came out again and Bung Karno firmly told them so.In turned out that they still wanted Bung Karno to make the proclamation. Not a single one of them was ready or dared do it.\n\n“To nignt we will not come to an agreement. It is useless”’said Bung Karno,”I am determined to go on with the meeting of the Preparatory Commitee tomorrow. Then proceed with the proclamation of Independence. If you do not agree, that’sis your business.I’m not going to take their right for myself. There’s no use in your pressing me, just go home first, and we’ll stop here”(ibid Yasni,1984).\n\n.\n\nd.Page 01-05\n\nThursday-AUGUST 16th 1945\n\n1)SUKARNO AND HATTA , IN THIS MORNING AT 4.00 PM carried off BY SUKARNI CS TO RENGASDENGKLOK .\n\n(1)Vintage Hatta’s version in 1951\n\nAt 16 August 1945 ,10.00 morning, all members of PPKI and several femous man with pers were presented in Pedjambon 2 building, but who weren’t present were…\n\n…..the invitator, Sukarno and Hatta, because they at 4.00 morning they were carried out to Rengasdengklok by Sukarni cs.\n\nTheir reason have told by Sukarni for bring us, because Sukarno didn.t proclaimed the Indonesia Indepenced like what their will or preffered , then the Youngmen , PETA(ex Dainippon defend Homeland army) and peoples will “bertindak” done themself.\n\nIn Jakarta will be an Revolution to fight the power from Japanese, that is way Bung karno and us must be flee to Rengasdengklok to administratived the Indonesia Independent Government there.\n\nWhen heared that , in the front of my face(mind) that the Disasters will happened to Indonesia, the mad actions of the younmen willn’t succeeded .This Rebellion will killed the Indonesian Revolution.\n\nAt this day , the Hot blood youngmen could not relized their own theory. Rebellion didn’t happened , outside Jakarta theren’t preparations aanymore. The Japanese have ready with their completed war machined to welcome all will be happaned.\n\nIn Rengasdengklok weren’t any meeting. There we workless “mengangur” Lost worked one day to saw from far the vision without based with reality.But, if there a place in Indonesia that realy be the fight of the power was at Rengasdengklok. The Rengasdengklok’s PETA have arrested theJapanese’s Wedana(Village’s Chief and two or three Japanese”Sakura” who adminstratived the Rice. The Jakarta’s Syotyokan(Mayor)this day have came to Rengasdengklok to check the Rice stock, he also arrested “coup d’etats .\n\nFor Who and under the whomed’s name the PETA fight the power there? For and under the name of Indonesian Independence? Indonesian Independence wasn,t birth this day and There wasn,t exist Indonesia Revolusioner Government.\n\nIn the afternoon Mr Subardjo have came as the Gunseibu’s envoy to bring us Home and Sukarni didn’t against that. In the night we came back to Djakarta also with Sutardjo and Sukarn and the Peta asked what about the Wedana, we said released him. At this nignh the the chief of Revolutiuon , will be started, and came back to the hand of Sukarno-Hatta (ibid Hatta,1951)\n\n(2)Later Version By Hatta in 1984\n\nAt four o’clock in the morning, after my last meal before sunrise ( this during the Moslem fasting month). Soekarni came to my house with somebody from PETA ( I don’t remenbmber his name anymore) to fetch me.\n\nSoekarni said :”I,m asking you to came with us”. “Where to?” I said.”Out of town” he said.”What are we going out of town for ?”I said again. Soekarni anwered : “ Well, we are going to free Indonesia and continue the Goverment from there, out of town”\n\n”What government, it hasn’t been formed ye t.Independence hasn’t been proclaimed yet, only tomorrow morning. What gouvernment are you talking about?”\n\n“Well that is how it is.This is the decision of the youth. Bung Karno and you aare going to be taken out of town, independence will proclaimed there “ said Soekarni.\n\nI answer ,:” Oh,that’s how it is. What you are trying to do is the same as Hitler’s abortive Putsch in Munich,that is,trying to seize power without any backbone and mature planning” I laso said :” We were gpoing to proclaim our independence and you’re going to make a failure of it”\n\nSoekarni said again :” Well,in any case ,just come with us,Bung. If you don’t come. Bung karno won’t want to come either”\n\nFrom my house I was tkaen to Bung Karno’shouse. From there Bung Karno, Fatmawati, Guntur, all of us, were taken to the border of Krawang in the direction of Rengasdengklok. Near krawang before turning off to Rengasdengklok, the car stopped. We were removed into a pick-up vehicle. The milk for baby Guntur was left behind in the previous car, which was sent back to Jakarta. Perhaps the reason was to prevent people from knowing where they had taken us. With that pick-up finally arrived in Rengasdengklok.\n\nWe were put in the office of the Daidan ( a lower administrative unit of PETA) . We were ordered to sit there. The house was two-storied, upstair seemed to be their bedrooms. We sat there together . Then the Wedana of Rengasdengklok was brought there.He was startled to see us there.\n\nAfter sitting there for an hour, we were told to move to another house not far away.It seemd to be the house of a Chinese, a landowner herer. We were guarded by a young man with a bambooo spear. Until close to tweleve noon nothing happened . Then I called the guard and asked him to call Soekarni. I said :” The man who brought us here, his name is soekarni,” He still didn’t know. I told him to ask the daidan.\n\nThe guard went away, Of course, he should not have left us. But Bung Karno and I told him to go, so he went. Miltarily of course, he was in fact being indisciplinary. Not long after that the guard came back with Soekarni. We asked him :”How is it, have you stated your revolution ? This morning you said that the people would attack.Have the people attacked jakarta yet ?”\n\nHe said , there had been no contact with Jakarta,yet. Bung Karno and I told him tophone Jakarta, to contact his headquaters and asked them whether it had taken place or whether it had failed or was it just talk and there had been no realization at all\n\nHe went . We waited for a long time. It almost an hour, and still he had not comeback. I thought, nothing was happenening.\n\nAbout two o’clock in the afternoon he came back at last and said that he tried to contact Jakarta; it was very difficult to make contacct at first, but at least he had done so,he said.\n\n“And what has happened ? have the people attacked Jakarta ?” .”No,there’s been no attack”,he said.”This morning you said that the people were going to attack and disarm the Japanese, therefore you brought us here. Now,itseems , nothing has happened. So,you’ve failed.” I said.”That is not sure yet.” H e replied.\n\nThus , we just waited and waited as we had done since morning. All that Bung Karno and I did was to take turns with Fatmawati holding Guntur and trying to quieten him.\n\nHe kept on crying because there was no milk. Fatmawati couldnot feed him and there was no canned milk because it had been left in the car had been sent back to Jakarta that morning.\n\nWhen it was my turn to be holding Guntur on my lap, he uninated. My trouser were wet and I had no change.So I could not say mt prayers, wheas it was fasting month. Only aound one in the afternoon was atin of milk brought and only then did Guntur become quiet.\n\nThat evening toward six o’clock,Soebardjo came from Jakarta looking for us. He negotiated with the Daidan to take us back to Jakarta.\n\nFirst the daidan refused. Soebardjo pointed out “What is the use of detaining Bung karno and Bung Hatta here ? Nothing is happening in Jakarta. It is absolutely queit there. The meeeting this morning was cancelled because you brought Bung Karno and Bung Hatta here. Why must it be like this ?”\n\nWhen we were to be taken back to Jakarta , i asked jokingly,”Better if we spent the night here, it is ill-time now,” Fatmawati(Soekarno’s wife)protested :”No, the tin of milk for Guntur which the guard brought is finished. Guntur will suffer and will cry again.At least we started for Jakarta.\n\nIn the end we were ready again to go back to Jakarta.\n\nSoekarni also went with us.\n\nFunny things happaned also on our way ack. Soekarno,myself and Soebardjo sat in the back in the car, while Soekarni sat in front next to the driver. Fatmawati and Guntur together with Soetardjo were in another car.\n\nOn our way to Jakarta before we passed Krawqang, we saw smoke in the distance, said Soekarni :” Now then the people have started to burn down the properties of the Chinese.” Bung Karno told the driver to goon, then to stop for a while when we told the driver to have a look. Laten on, he said it was only the people burning rice straw. We all doubled up with laughter. Soekarni did look slightly embarrassed.\n\nWhen we reached jakarta, Soetardjo accompanied Fatmawati and Guntur home to 56 pegangsaan street (now Proklamasi street)with their own car ,\n\nBung Karno and myself ,Soebardjo and soekarni went to my place with our car.\n\nI immediately asked Soebardjo to phone Hotel de Indess to CALL A MEETING THAT SAME NIGHT OF MEMBERS OF THE PREPATORY COMMITTEE AT MIDNIGHT AT HOTEL das INDES to continue the meeting which had not taken place that morning.\n\nThose at Hotel des Indes said by phone that for some time past the Japanese has instructed the hotel management sot to allow meetings to be held after ten at night.\n\nSoebardho suggested we try to ask MAEDA’S AGREEMENT TO HOLD THE MEEETING AT HIS HOUSE. We AGREED WITH Soebardjo suggestion.Maeda answered by phone:”He would with pleasure put his house at our disposal for the meeting and he was happy to hear that the two of us had returned to Jakarta. All 21 members were invited to hold that MIDNIGHT MEETING.\n\nEach of us wanted to go home first since there were still a few hours to go before midnight.”What about me?” asked Soekarni.”You go home too”I said. “But,I can’t go like this, in my PETA uniform”. “Why are you afraid. You took tke risk,you dared make a revolution, why should you be afraid of being arrested by the Japanese?”. In the end i lent him a few clothes, which happened to fiyt. Perhaps a bit tight, but he went home in those cloth. Going back to Jakaeta he was in PETA uniform, although he had no right to them because he was not a member of PETA.\n\nThen there was a telephone call from Miyoshi, my laisson man at the Gunseikanbu, saying that the Sumobucho wanted to see me. I told Miyoshi that we would come around 10. p.m. . After taking bath I phoned Bung Karno to fetch me to go to Maeda’s and the Gunseikan at 10 p.m.\n\nFirst we went to Maeda’s house and accompanied by Maeda too, we went to the house of the Sumabucho. (Read Dai Nippon Military adminstration Java about the Dai Nippon official goverment-auth) .\n\nMaeda was delighted we were back and shook hands with us. The Sumobucho did not allow the holding of meeting any longer. “What can we do? We have surrendered to the Allies and now we are just tools of the Allies. The Allies instructed us to guard the status quo no changes are to be made anymore.\n\nWe immediately answered rather harshy :”You are a Samurai. General Terauchi at Dalat left it to us. What about your oath and your promise as a Samutai to us ?” “We are in a different position now”, he said. “You alway stalk, about your Samurai spirit. Show it to us no”,We retorted.\n\nBung karno and I indeed used rathervharsh words and apparentley Miyoshi refined it translation a little, but eventually, we didn’t achieve anything.\n\nBung Karno said again :” So, if our youth takes action,will your army shoot them ?” The Sumobucho said :” Yes, we are forced to. Thoses are the Allied instructions, there is nothing esle to be done.”\n\nMaeda went home earlier. He seemed bored by that endless talk. In the end, after about one hour, we also left the house of the Sumobucho and returned to Maeda’s house.Maeda just laughed, saying that the Sumobucho had no standpoint. At the beginning we were five people gathered there, that is, Bung Karno\n\n, myself(Bung Hatta)\n\n, Soebardjo\n\n, Sayuti Melik and Soekarni.\n\nWe agreed ten to write the text odf the proclamation. I said that the text had been prpared since last night, was at my place. It wasn’t quite ready; I was typing it, when I was taken to Bung Karno’shouse.\n\nBung karno said that we should make just a short text ,” Bung Hatta knows better Indonesian than I do. Think about it and write it down” said Bung Karno.\n\nTo think and write at the same time is rather difficult. I’ll think out the sentences and Bung Karno write them down” I said.\n\nThen I spoke the sentences of the draft proclamation, and Bung Karno wrote them down on paper. The two main sentences that i dictated were,” We, the Indonesian peopke, hereby proclaim the Independence of Indonesia. The tranfer of power and the like, matters relating there to will be carried out carefully and in the shortest possible time”\n\nBung Karno slowly read the text of the proclamation. Tree time he read it. Ultimately everybody agreed unanimously, everybody accepted it happily. Everybody shouter :”Agrreed”.\n\nThen I asked the all saying:” So this is an important document for the history of our nation.Let us all who are present here sign this document . Just as when George Washington made his proclamation, evereybody present signed the document .” Nobody answere. Dilence. Then Soekarni said:” It is not good if all of us sign the document. Soekarno-Hatta is sufficient on behalf of all the people of Indonesia\n\nEverybody was happy. I was rather annoyed, because they were given an opportunity to make history, but didn’it want to take it (may be they were affraid to Japanese ????-auth ,what your comment?). So, it seem they only looked like tigers from the outside. Iapparently they were brave, but in fact they were not).\n\nThe meeting was ended, everybody was happy. Maeda\n\ncame down from his room upstairs. He shook hands with everybody present. We ordered the btext of the proclamation to be retyped, multiplied and broadcast.\n\nThus, only that night had the Sunobucho told us that since tweleve noon that day instruction had been recieved by Japan from the Allies that the status quo was not to be changed, and therefore the holding of meetings could not be approved. But Maeda not only gave permission , but even put his house at our disposal for that historic meeting. I think the reason Maeda did that was HIS CONSCIENCE AS SAMURAI SOLDIER HE FELT BOUND BY Japan’s promise, and (perhaps) he felt he was going to punished by the Allies anyway, so it was better to help the wishes of the Indonesian ppeople to reach the treshold of their ieals.\n\nThat is my private guess. So, the meeting which was to be held in the morning 0f 16th August 1945 was cancelled which we had been carried off to Rengasdengklok, and it was not true the Japanese prevent it.\n\nIt is necessary to note here, which I learnt afterwards, that threre was a proposal by Soekarni which he conveyed through Soebardjo, to add five more names to participate in the signing of the text of the proclamation, but Soebardji did not mention this during the early morning meetin in August 17. Maybe it was because Soekarni had said that night it was enough for just two people to sign it (ibid Yasni,1984).\n\nand then typing by Sayuti Melik\n\n(In the originnal text, Soekarno writting some off Hatta dictated were stripped and changed from”Af-voi vo q(not clear) change to”Penjerahan”(recapitulation) and then change to”pemindahan”, the word “ dioesahakan’ change to “diselenggarakan” Djakarta 17-8-’05 Wakil2 bangsa Indonesia.

The declaration marked the start of the diplomatic and armed-resistance of the Indonesian National Revolution, fighting against the forces of the Netherlands until the latter officially acknowledged Indonesia’s independence in 1949. In 2005, the Netherlands declared that they had decided to accept 17 August 1945 as Indonesia’s independence date[1]\n\nSukarno and Mohammad Hatta, who were appointed President and Vice-president, respectively, were the document’s signatories.\n\nContents\n\n1 Declaration event\n\n2 Draft\n\n2.1 Indonesian\n\n2.2 Amendments\n\n3 Final text\n\n3.1 English translation\n\nDeclaration event\n\nSukarno, accompanied by Mohammad Hatta (right), proclaiming the independence of Indonesia.\n\nThe draft was prepared only a few hours earlier, on the night of August 16, by Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo, at Rear-Admiral Maeda (Minoru) Tadashi’s house, Miyako-Doori 1, Jakarta (now the “Museum of the Declaration of Independence“, JL. Imam Bonjol I, Jakarta). The original Indonesian Declaration of Independence was typed by Sayuti Melik.[2][3] Maeda himself was sleeping in his room upstairs. He was agreeable to the idea of Indonesia‘s independence, and had lent his house for the drafting of the declaration. Marshal Terauchi, the highest-ranking Japanese leader in South East Asia and son of Prime Minister Terauchi Masatake, was however against Indonesia’s independence, scheduled for August 24.\n\nWhile the formal preparation of the declaration, and the official independence itself for that matter, had been carefully planned a few months earlier, the actual declaration date was brought forward almost inadvertently as a consequence of the Japanese unconditional surrender to the Allies on August 15 following the Nagasaki atomic bombing. The historic event was triggered by a plot, led by a few more radical youth activists such as Adam Malik and Chairul Saleh, that put pressure on Soekarno and Hatta to proclaim independence immediately. The declaration was to be signed by the 27 members of the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) symbolically representing the new nation’s diversity. The particular act was apparently inspired by a similar spirit of the United States Declaration of Independence. However, the idea was heavily turned down by the radical activists mentioned earlier, arguing that the committee was too closely associated with then soon to be defunct Japanese occupation rule, thus creating a potential credibility issue. Instead, the radical activists demanded that the signatures of six of them were to be put on the document. All parties involved in the historical moment finally agreed on a compromise solution which only included Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta as the co-signers ‘in the name of the nation of Indonesia’\n\nSoekarno had initially wanted the declaration to be read at Ikada Plain, the large open field in the centre of Jakarta, but due to unfounded widespread apprehension over the possibility of Japanese sabotage, the venue was changed to Soekarno’s house at Pegangsaan Timur 56. In fact there was no concrete evidence for the growing suspicions, as the Japanese had already surrendered to the Allies, and the Japanese high command in Indonesia had given their permission for the nation’s independence. The declaration of independence passed without a hitch.\n\nDraft\n\nIndonesian\n\nPROKLAMASIKami, bangsa Indonesia, dengan ini menjatakan kemerdekaan Indonesia.\n\nHal-hal jang mengenai pemindahan kekoeasaan,d.l.l., diselenggarakan dengan tjara saksama dan dalam tempoh yang sesingkat-singkatnja\n\nDjakarta (Jakarta), 17-8-45\n\nWakil-Wakil Bangsa Indonesia\n\nAmendments\n\nThree amendments were made to the draft, as follows:\n\n“tempoh“: changed to “tempo“, both meaning “time period”.\n\n17-8-45: changed to “hari 17, boelan 8, tahoen 05″ (“day 17, month 8, year 05” of the Japanese sumera calendar); the number “05” is the short form for 2605.\n\n“Wakil-Wakil Bangsa Indonesia” (Representatives of the people of Indonesian nation): changed to “Atas nama bangsa Indonesia” (“in the name of the nation of Indonesia”).\n\nFinal text\n\nThe original Indonesian Declaration of Independence\n\nThe monument commemorating the Indonesian Declaration of Independence\n\nPROKLAMASIKami, bangsa Indonesia, dengan ini menjatakan kemerdekaan Indonesia.\n\nHal-hal jang mengenai pemindahan kekoeasaan d.l.l., diselenggarakan dengan tjara saksama dan dalam tempo jang sesingkat-singkatnja.\n\nDjakarta, hari 17 boelan 8 tahoen 05\n\nAtas nama bangsa Indonesia,\n\nSoekarno/Hatta.\n\nEnglish translation\n\nAn English translation published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as of October 1948 included the entire speech as read by Sukarno. It incorporated remarks made immediately prior to and after the actual proclamation.

The emperor dismisses their protestations for protracted carnage.\n\nThe emperor notes that with the Soviet entry into the Pacific War and the enemy’s use of atomic weapons, not even Onishi’s Special Attack forces can stop them. He requests that his senior officers cooperate with him to end the war.

Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru and General Umezu Yoshijiro, Chief of the Army General Staff are in the front row. Witnessing the surrender on behalf of the IJN are Rear Admiral, the Baron, Tomioka Sadatoshi (former CO of OYODO)(middle row, behind Umezu), Rear Admiral Yokoyama Ichiro (former CO of KUMA)(back row, right) and Captain Shiba Katsuo (former CO of OI) (back row, behind Tomioka). The others present are the witnesses of the IJA and the Foreign Ministry. At about 0905, Shigemitsu and Umezu sign the Instrument of Surrender, followed by General of the Army, Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Commander for the Allied Forces, Fleet Admiral Chester A. Nimitz, representing the United States, and eight representatives of the Allied Forces.\n\nAt the time of surrender, 43 Kaiten torpedoes (mostly Type 1 or Type 1 Improved) are located at Otsujima base, 52 at Hikari, 39 at Hirao, 37 at Kure and 16 at Oga. All are destroyed or scuttled after the end of hostilities. 224 Kairyu submersibles were built by the end of war plus another 207 were in various stages of completion. In addition to about 115 Koryus built during the war, some 500 are found incomplete.\n\nWith the War’s end, Operation “Downfall” is cancelled. General of the Army George C. Marshall, CoS, U.S. Army, estimates up to one million casualties for the invasion of Japan, but a contemporary Army study estimates the invasion and subsequent Battle for Japan would have cost as many as four million American casualties, including up to 800,000 fatalities, and five to ten million Japanese fatalities.\n\nIf Downfall had become necessary and American forces were contested heavily in southern Japan, the Soviets most probably would have secured Hokkaido and invaded northern Honshu. This may have led to the vanquished nation’s partitioning into North and South Japan, as occurred in Korea and persists to this day.\n\nB.

In the official meeting ,General Terauchi\n\nsaid :”Depand on your masters to decide when Indodesia will Independent”( Hatta,Legend and reality around Proclamation 17 Agustus,Mimbar Indonesia 17 Agustus 1951,no 32/33)\n\nb) On the 12th of August ( which happened to coincide with may birthday) MARSHAL TERAUCHI told us in Dalat (300 km from Saigon) the decision of the Japanese Government to give up the question of Indonesia’s Independence to the Committee for Preparation of Indonesian Independence.\n\nHe said : “It is you gentlemen who are to carry this out, and it is entirely up to you to decide its execution”.\n\nSukarno then asked :”It is right if we do it a week from now ?\n\n“It is up to you gentlemen” Answered Terauchi.\n\n(Yasni Z,Bung Hatta Anwers,1981,page 116)\n\nc) Field Marshal Terauchi\n\n(1) ,who wasn’t Indonesian’s friend ,Independence was forced by the government in Tokyo (gogle,internet).\n\n(2)the vintage photo of Field Marshal Terauchi and his room with Sukarno’s photo (P,google,internet)\n\nd)The vintage photo of Indonesian hero\n\n(1) Sukarno and Hatta during that time.\n\n(2) I haven’t found the photo of Dr Radjiman\n\ne) The Vintage picture postcard of Dalat and Saigon cochinchina ( Emperor Bodai’s palace were in Dalat and used by Marskal Terauchi as Dai Nippon East Asia Command administrations Building, and Saigon after vietnam liberation change name to be Ho Chi Minh City-read the Vietnam Document and Postal History-auth)\n\nb.Page 01-02\n\nMonday, August 13th 1945\n\n1)After returning from Dalat to Saigon,we heard that Russia had attacked Manchuria, and thus the blows against Japan were complete,coming from all direction(ibid yazni,page 117)\n\nc.Page 01-03\n\nTuesday, August .14th .1945\n\n1) when back from Dalat to Jakarta (Via Saigon and Singapore-auth),\n\n(1) the three delegations meet with Mr Teuku Hassan,Dr Amir and Mr Abbas , the member of PPKI (Panitia Persiapan Kemerdekaan) or the committee for the Preparation of Independence from Sumatra, which will departed with us to Djakarta.They have heard that Russian have anounced the War to Japan and in-vasion Mansjuria(Manchuria), After the discussion we have conclution that the Japanese were falling down willn’t in month and we must proclaimed Indonesia Independence fastly. ( they don’t know about the US “H”Bomb auth)(Ibid,Hatta,1951)\n\n(2 In the morning of August 14 , before we were to be flown back to Jakarta on a bomber, we met Dr Amir. He asked whether it was true that Russian had attacked Japan in Manchuria ? I said tjat it was right.Then Dr Amir said :” then it won’t be much longer”\n\nI said ,”That’s right.We are not counting in months anymore bur a most in just weeks . Psychollogy Japan had already lost, being attacked from the south and the North”(ibid Yasni ,p-117,1985)\n\n(3)So the three of us (Sukarno,Hatta and Radjiman) started home for Indonesia. In Singapore, we recieved an invitation from the Commander of the Japanese army there) . Delegates from North Sumatra (Dr Amir,Abbas and Hassan) were invited to a party by a lower level of the Japanese army leadership. We were invited by a higher level. It looked as though the Japanese were afraid for us to meet (ibid,Yasni,p 117,1984)\n\n(2 )Sukarno annouced that Independence will be fastly in Kemayoran airpot.\n\n(a)After came back at Jakarta, in Kemayoran airport (Kemayoran now the Jakarta Fair area, and Sukarno Hatta international airport in Cengkareng Tangerang-auth), sukarno have said in he front of many peoples “ In before I have said that our Independence before the “Jagung” berbuah”or seeds…., now I can concluded that. Independence before “Jagung” were flowered)” (ibid Hatta,1951)\n\n(b) When we arrived at Kemayoran airpot in Jakarta, we were met by the Gunseikan.\n\nWithout going home first, we were taken to the Palace to meet the Gunseikan. We were welcomed with a happy face and clear laughter by the Gunsereikan , and had dinner with high –ranked Japanese authoritied, there were even a toast and congratulation over “Indonesia Independence” (Yasni,p-117,1984)\n\n(3) Emperor Hirohito asked the Dai Nippon Military surrendered to allied Army(D)\n\n(4) Sjahrir Told Hatta that Japanese have aksed peace to Allied Armed Forces and suggest Sukarno annouced via radio Indonesia Independence.\n\n(a)In the afternoon 14th Agustus , Sjahrir came to told me that Japanese have asked peace to Allied, and he asked how about our Independence ? I have aswered our Independence was on our hands.\n\nThe Sjahrir’s opinion,that the Indonesia Indepen-dence proclamation willn’t by the commitee of preparation Indonesian Independecde because the allied Army will said that the birth of Republic of Indonesia was made by the Japanese. Better only Sukarno himself annouced as the leader under the people’s named via Radio.(ibid,Hatta,1951)\n\n(b) This party was over around 1.30 in the afternoon. Only then did we go home.At Home I found Syahrir waiting. “How was it?”he said .\n\nI said that the japanese had given the matter up to us. Then Syahrir said that it would be better if the proclamation of Independence were not made by the Committee for the Preparationb of Independence, because Japan had already surrendered, whilst the Committee were made by Japan. It would be better if the proclamation were made just by Bung Karno.\n\nI said , would he want to do that, because, after all, he was the Chairman of that Committee. I phoned Bung Karno tight away. I asked :”You weren’t asleep yet?”.Bung Karno answered :”No,not yet” Then I said :”Something important has come up, Syahrir and I would like to come now for a few minutes”. Bung karno said :”Alright,please comenow”\n\nSyahrir and I went there immedietely. Bung Karno was waiting for us. Syahrir then suggested that Bung Karno himself should make the proclamation. Sukarno said that, however things might be, it would not be right for him to seize the opportunity himself in this matter without acting together with the Committee.\n\nSyahrir said that with the regard to this matter, Bung Karno should act as leader of the people, while the Committee was made by Japan.\n\nAgain Bung Karno said that no matter how things might be, we had cooperated with the Japanese for quite a long time.\n\nBung Karno also said at that time that he did not yet know for certain and was not yet convinced that the Japanese had surrendered already, as Syahrir said.\n\n“All right then , tommorow,together with Bung Hatta, I’ll go yo the Gunseikanbu to make inquiries; that won’t be too late ,will it?” Bung karno said. Said Syahrir ,”No,that won’t be too late”.(Yasni,1984,p-118)\n\nd.Page 01-04.\n\n______________________________________________________\n\nWENDSDAY-AUGUST 15th 1945\n\n(1) Dai Nippon Military official surender was signed on the US Arrmed forces USS”Missouri” in september 1945,the official photo (D)\n\n(2) Although Dai Nippon was officially surrendered, the Dai Nippon Military Administration still exist in Indonesia\n\n(,they have waited to give the power to Allied army, but the allied army very late came to Indonesia, that is way the Japanese Military Administration still exist until The British Army under allied army came. The unique and postal history collection will proved that situation-auth)\n\n1.In 15th August,\n\n(a)the Japanese have asked” Peace” to Allied Armed forces( they didn.t like to say “Surren-dered”,may be they ashamed and still had the power -auth), that is way we dicided\n\n(b) to invited the member of PPPK (Indonesia Independence prepatory Committee) to have the meeting at 10.00 morning in the Sanyo Office at Pejambon 2.\n\n(c) Indonesia Indepence Proclamation must be announce as fast as we could, the Indonesia National Basic Law (UUD) must be “Mufakat” without any discussed and the Indonesia Governerment at Central and Regional area must be done in several days only.\n\n(d) The PPKI’s members from regional area must came back to their area with bring the complete instructions from the Indonesia Independence Government. If they back latetly,may be the Japanese will banned them backhome because the Japanese have the powered from the Allied Army( Jurukuasa underpower.)\n\n(e) That True Japanese had aggreed Indonesian Independence, but may be the allied army will asked the Japanese army to liquidatied Indonesia and will tried to gave back to Dutch East Indie Government.\n\n(f) Organized revolution must exist, then Indonesion Independence could resisted with all Indonesian people’s struggled. Depend on this ,then I am “menentang” or against the Youngman,Peta and peoples’s “Merebut Kekuasaan” or Fight the Power theory, that suggested in the afternoon by in memoriam Subianto and subadio, the Parlemen’s member now.\n\n(g)The fight of Power must be after the Independence Proclamation by Bung karno via Radio.To the two Men I said that I like Revulution, but against the “Putsch”or Rebellion.The Young men didn’t sustified to this explenation but latter they have said that that were true and Subianto have done my special tasked until he was died in Serpong. (ibid Hatta,1951)\n\n2.The following morning (15th August 1945)\n\nwe went to the Gunseikanbu,( Dai nippon Military Administration Headquaters , the present Pertamina building-auth). There was nobody there. Except for a single Lieutenant by the name of Nomura, If I’m not mistaken.\n\nEverybody had been summoned to the Gunserei-kanbu .I thought, the Japanese had indeed already surrendered.\n\nSubardjo, assistant to Admiral Maeda,\n\nwho was also with us at the time suggested that we go straight away to Admiral Maeda. Which we did, and we met Maeda.(in 1946 Maeda was arrested by the Allied forces and put in jail for one year becau he help Indonesian independent, in 1947 he bring back and retired in Japan and in 1976 Indonesian Government gave him the Indonesian narariya medal . In December,13th .1977 Maeda Pass Away.)\n\nBung karno asked whether the rumours were true, the Japan had surrendered .Maeda was silent , for sevela minutes he did not anwer and his head was bowed. I pinched Bung Karno and whispered :”It looks as if the rumours are true”\n\nIn the end , Maeda drew a long breath and said :” According to Allied broadcasts,yes.But we have not yet recieved any instruction at all"
