        "text": "Marie Laetitia Bonaparte (Marie Laetitia Eugénie Catherine Adélaïde; 20 November 1866 – 25 October 1926) was one of three children born to Prince Napoléon and his wife Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy. In 1888, she married Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, the former King of Spain. Maria Letizia became the Duchess of Aosta, Duke of Aosta being a title Amadeus had before after becoming King of Spain. Their marriage was instrumental in almost reviving French hopes of reinstating the House of Bonaparte into a position of power, as seen in the days of Napoleon III. She was a cousin of King Umberto I of Italy. In Italy she was known as \"Maria Letizia Bonaparte\".\n\nPrince Umberto of Savoy, Count of Salemi (22 June 1889 – 19 October 1918) died in a 1918 flu pandemic in World War I. Never married and had no known children. ."
