Born on December 26, 1771, in the family mansion at 70 Roma Street in Marseille, France, Julie was the seventh of the nine children and the fifth of the six daughters of François Clary, a wealthy French merchant, and his second wife Françoise Rose Somis.\n\nJulie had eight siblings:\n\nJoseph Nicolas Clary, 1st Comte Clary et de l’Empire (1760 – 1823), married Anne Jeanne Rouyer, had three children\n\nJoseph Honoré Clary (1762 – 1764), died in early childhood\n\nMarie Anne Rose Clary (1764 – 1835), married Antoine-Ignace Anthoine, Baron de Saint-Joseph et de l’Empire, Mayor of Marseille, had three children\n\nMarseille Clary (1764 – 1784), unmarried\n\nJustinien François Clary (1766 – 1794), unmarried\n\nCatherine Honorine Clary (1769 – 1843), married Henri Joseph Gabriel Blait de Villeneufve, had one daughter\n\nBasile Clary (1774 – 1781), died in childhood\n\nBernardine Eugénie Désirée Clary, Queen Desideria of Sweden and Norway (1777 – 1860), married Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, later King Carl XIV Johan of Sweden and Norway, had one son King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway, the royal families of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, and Sweden descend from this marriage\n\nJulie had four half-siblings from her father’s first marriage to Gabrielle Fléchon (1732 – 1758):\n\nFrançois-Joseph Clary (1752 – 1753), died in infancy\n\nMarie-Jeanne Clary (1754 – 1815), married (1) Louis Honoré Lejeans (2) Emmanuel Mathieu Pézenas, Baron de Pluvinal\n\nMarie Thérèse Catherine Clary (1755 – 1818), married Lazare Lejeans\n\nÉtienne François Clary (1757 – 1823), married Marcelle Guey, had two children\n\nStarting in 1789, the French Revolution brought major changes to France, and the Clary family went through periods of great insecurity. Julie and her sister Désirée had ties to the Bonaparte brothers before their ascent to power. Joseph Bonaparte, the eldest of the five Bonaparte brothers, had studied law at the University of Pisa and worked as a lawyer. The French First Republic was declared in September 1792, and Joseph was elected chairman of his local district council. The second eldest brother Napoleon joined the French army and quickly advanced.\n\nJulie’s younger sister Désirée met Joseph Bonaparte first, and the two became engaged. Soon after, Napoleon suggested that Joseph should instead marry Désirée’s sister Julie and that he would marry Désirée. Julie and Joseph Bonaparte were married on August 1, 1794. Napoleon and Désirée became engaged in April 1795, but Napoleon soon became involved with Joséphine de Beauharnais and the engagement ended in September 1795. Napoleon and Joséphine de Beauharnais were married in March 1796. Désirée Clary married Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, a noted French general and a Marshal of France. In 1810, Désirée’s husband was elected Crown Prince of Sweden because King Carl XIII of Sweden had no heirs. Jean Baptiste Bernadotte became Crown Prince of Sweden and in 1818, became King Carl XIV Johan of Sweden. Their descendants have reigned in Sweden ever since as the House of Bernadotte.\n\nJulie’s family was very wealthy and her marriage to Joseph Bonaparte helped established the Bonaparte fortune and made her a favorite with her mother-in-law Letizia Bonaparte. During the latter part of the French Revolution, Napoleon rose to prominence and in 1799, at the age of 30 was the First Consul of France. Eventually, Napoleon was created First Consul for life. Joseph’s fortunes rose along with his brother’s.\n\nJulie and Joseph had three daughters:\n\nJulie Joséphine Bonaparte (1796 – 1797), died in infancy\n\nZénaïde Laetitia Julie Bonaparte (1801 – 1854), married her first cousin Charles Lucien Bonaparte, had twelve children\n\nCharlotte Napoléone Bonaparte (1802 – 1839), married her first cousin Napoleon Louis Bonaparte, no children, died giving birth to a stillborn child\n\nIn 1804, Joseph’s brother Napoleon declared himself Emperor of the French, and Joseph, along with his siblings became Imperial Princes and Princesses. Napoleon sent Joseph to Naples in 1806 to expel the Bourbons ruling there because they had sided against him in the War of the Third Coalition. After a successful French invasion, Napoleon proclaimed Joseph as King of Naples. Julie, now Queen of Naples, remained in Paris, at the court of her brother-in-law Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. While Joseph was King of Naples, he had a son and a daughter from his affair with Maria Giulia Colonna, daughter of Andrea Colonna, 3rd Prince of Stigliano and wife of Giangirolamo Acquaviva d’Aragona, 11th Duke of Nardò. In 1808 Julie was sent to Naples to help Joseph calm riots and revolts and to help keep the Kingdom of Naples stable. However, Napoleon became increasingly dissatisfied with his brother, and later in 1808, Joseph was replaced as King of Naples by Joachim Murat, the husband of Caroline Bonaparte, the sister of Joseph and Napoleon.\n\nMeanwhile in Spain, after riots and a revolt, King Carlos IV of Spain was forced to abdicate in favor of his son King Fernando VII on March 19, 1808. Napoleon saw the weaknesses in the Spanish monarchy and decided to make a move. Carlos IV and his son Fernando VII were summoned to a meeting with Napoleon on May 7, 1808, at the Castle of Marracq in Bayonne, France, where Napoleon forced them both to abdicate their rights to the Spanish throne, declared the Bourbon dynasty of Spain deposed, and installed his brother Joseph as King of Spain.\n\nJoseph and Julie, circa 1811\n\nJulie never lived in or even traveled to Spain, preferring to live in Paris or Mortefontaine Castle (link in French) in France. In Spain, she was referred to as Reina Ausent, The Absent Queen, but Julie was given all the honors of a Queen of Spain at Napoleon’s court. Through her correspondence with Joseph, Julie informed him of Napoleon’s plans for Spain. She warned Joseph that Napoleon would never allow Spain to be too independent and that he should do everything possible to control Spain, especially its finances and army.\n\nImmediately after Joseph was proclaimed King of Spain, uprisings broke out and resistance against him spread, leading to a guerrilla war that overshadowed Joseph’s entire reign. The resistance against Joseph made it nearly impossible for him to reign. In addition, Portugal and the United Kingdom came to the aid of the Spanish guerrilla forces in the Peninsular War. Due to the defeats in the Peninsular War, Napoleon was forced to reinstate Ferdinand VII as King of Spain and to make peace via the 1813 Treaty of Valençay.\n\nNapoleon’s quest for power led to wars throughout a large part of Europe. In 1814, Paris was captured by the coalition fighting against Napoleon and his marshals decided to mutiny. Napoleon had no choice but to abdicate. The 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau exiled Napoleon to the Mediterranean island of Elba, 12 miles/20 km off the coast of Tuscany, Italy.\n\nAfter the first fall of Napoleon in 1814, Joseph and his daughters went into exile at Prangins Castle in Switzerland, which Julie had purchased. Julie remained in Paris because of the illness of her mother, who died in 1815. While in Paris, Julie was arrested because of her relationship to the exiled Napoleon and was brought before King Louis XVIII of France, the new king installed during the Bourbon Restoration, and Alexander I, Emperor of All Russia. Only through the intervention of her brother-in-law Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, then Crown Prince Carl Johan of Sweden, was Julie freed.\n\nNapoleon escaped from the island of Elba on February 26, 1815, and arrived in France two days later. He attempted to regain power during the Reign of the Hundred Days but was ultimately defeated at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815. Napoleon was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, a British possession, in the Atlantic Ocean, 1162 miles/1,870 km from the west coast of Africa, where he died in 1821. After Napoleon’s final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, Joseph Bonaparte emigrated to the United States, where he first lived in New York City and then in Philadelphia. He then purchased an estate, Point Breeze, in Bordentown, New Jersey, on the Delaware River. Joseph had two American daughters born at Point Breeze, by his mistress Annette Savage.\n\nJulie did not accompany her husband Joseph to the United States. Her sister Désirée, who was then Crown Princess of Sweden, wanted to bring Julie and her daughters to Sweden but Désirée’s husband Crown Prince Carl Johan thought it was politically unwise. Julie was a member of the Bonaparte family and her living in Sweden might be interpreted as a sign that Crown Prince Carl Johan had sided with the deposed Napoleon. Instead, Julie settled with her daughters in the Free City of Frankfurt (now in Germany), Brussels, Belgium, and then finally in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now in Italy, at the Palazzo Serristori, near the residence of her brother-in-law Camillo Borghese, 6th Prince of Sulmona, the second husband of Joseph’s sister Pauline.\n\nJulie’s husband Joseph stayed in the United States for seventeen years before returning to Europe in 1832, where he lived in London, England. He occasionally returned to his estate in the United States. In 1840, Joseph joined Julie in Florence. Julie accepted him back despite his adultery. On July 28, 1844, Joseph died in Florence, Grand Duchy of Tuscany, now in Italy, at the age of seventy-six. Julie survived him by eight months dying in Florence on April 7, 1845, aged seventy-three. They were buried next to each other at the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, Italy.\n\nIn 1864, Joseph’s remains were brought back to France by his nephew Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, and interred in Les Invalides in Paris, France where his brother Napoleon I was interred. The remains of Julie are still at the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence, Italy beside the remains of her daughter Charlotte, who died in 1839, aged 36, giving birth to a stillborn child.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born Guiseppe Buonaparte, later Frenchified to Joseph Bonaparte, on January 7, 1768, in Corte on the island of Corsica, now in France, Joseph was the third of the twelve children and the eldest of the five sons of Carlo Buonaparte, a lawyer and diplomat, and Maria Letizia Ramolino. In the year of Joseph’s birth, the island of Corsica was invaded by France and conquered the following year. Joseph’s father was originally a follower of the Corsican patriots but became a supporter of the French.\n\nJoseph had eleven siblings and eight survived childhood.

Maison Bonaparte was continuously owned by members of the Bonaparte family from 1682 to 1923. As part of the 1768 Treaty of Versailles, the Republic of Genoa ceded the island of Corsica to France to repay its debts. Joseph and his brother Napoleon attended the College of Oratorians, a secondary school, in Autun, France through a royal grant for impoverished French nobles. Joseph was originally going to be a priest but instead studied law at the University of Pisa where his father had also studied law.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Pisa in 1788, Joseph returned to Ajaccio in Corsica and worked as a lawyer.

She was the youngest of the three children and the second of the two daughters of Felipe, Infante of Spain, Duke of Parma (founder of the House of Bourbon-Parma) and Louise Élisabeth of France. Maria Luisa’s paternal grandparents were King Felipe V of Spain and his second wife Elisabeth Farnese of Parma. King Felipe V, the founder of the Spanish House of Bourbon, was born a French prince, Philippe, Duke of Anjou, the second son of Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, who was the son and heir apparent of King Louis XIV of France. Her maternal grandparents were King Louis XV of France and Maria Leszczyńska. Maria Luisa was given the names Luisa Maria Teresa Anna for her maternal grandparents and her mother’s twin sister Anne Henriette of France. Called Luisa by her family, she is known in history as Maria Luisa.\n\nMaria Luisa had two older siblings:\n\nIsabella of Parma (1741 – 1763), married Archduke Joseph of Austria (the future Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II after Isabella’s death), no surviving children, died from smallpox while pregnant with her second child\n\nFerdinando I, Duke of Parma (1751 – 1802), married Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria (sister of Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II), had seven children\n\nMaria Luisa’s French mother wanted to arrange a betrothal between Maria Luisa and her first cousin Louis Joseph, Duke of Burgundy. Louis Joseph was the same age as Maria Luisa, was also a grandchild of King Louis XV of France, and was second in the line of the French succession after his father Louis, Dauphin of France. However, neither of them became King of France. Ten-year-old Louis Joseph died from tuberculosis in 1761 and four years later, his father Louis, Dauphin of France also died from tuberculosis.\n\nIn 1762, Maria Luisa was betrothed to her first cousin, the future King Carlos IV of Spain, the son of King Carlos III of Spain and Maria Amalia of Saxony. The marriage was intended to strengthen the relationships between the Bourbons ruling in Spain and Parma. When Maria Luisa’s older sister Isabella died in 1763 from smallpox, it was suggested that Maria Luisa should marry her sister’s widower, the future Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II. However, the match was eventually rejected and the betrothal of Maria Luisa and Carlos was confirmed. The not-quite-seventeen-year-old Carlos and the not-quite fourteen-year-old Maria Luisa were married on September 4, 1765, at the La Granja Palace in San Ildefonso, Spain.\n\nMaria Luisa had twenty-three pregnancies. Thirteen of the pregnancies resulted in live births, including a set of twins. The other ten pregnancies ended in miscarriages. Of the fourteen children who were born alive, only seven survived childhood:\n\nCarlos Clemente, Infante of Spain (1771 – 1774), died in early childhood\n\nCarlota Joaquina, Infanta of Spain, Queen of Portugal (1775 – 1830), married King João VI of Portugal, had nine children including two Kings of Portugal\n\nMaria Luisa, Infanta of Spain (1777 – 1782), died in childhood\n\nMaría Amalia, Infanta of Spain (1779 – 1798), married her paternal uncle Infante Antonio Pascual of Spain, gave birth to a stillborn son in 1798, and died shortly thereafter\n\nCarlos Domingo, Infante of Spain (1780 – 1783), died in childhood\n\nMaria Luisa, Infanta of Spain, Queen of Etruria, Duchess of Lucca (1782 – 1824), married Louis, King of Etruria, had one son and one daughter\n\nCarlos Francisco de Paula, Infante of Spain (1783 – 1784), twin of Felipe Francisco de Paula, died in infancy\n\nFelipe Francisco de Paula, Infante of Spain (1783 – 1784), twin of Carlos Francisco de Paula, died in infancy\n\nFernando VII, King of Spain (1784 – 1833), married (1) Maria Antonia of Naples and Sicily, Princess of Asturias, no children (2) Maria Isabel of Portugal, had one daughter who died in infancy, Maria Isabel died giving birth to a stillborn daughter (3) Maria Josepha Amalia of Saxony, no children (4) Maria Christina of the Two Sicilies, had two daughters including the Queen Isabella II of Spain\n\nCarlos María Isidro Benito, Infante of Spain, Count of Molina (1788 – 1855), married two nieces, daughters of his sister Carlota Joaquina (1) Infanta Maria Francisca of Portugal, had three sons (2) Maria Teresa, Princess of Beira, no children\n\nMaría Isabel, Infanta of Spain, Queen of the Two Sicilies (1789 – 1848), married Francesco I of the Two Sicilies, had twelve children, including Ferdinando II, King of the Two Sicilies\n\nMaria Teresa, Infanta of Spain (1791 – 1794), died in childhood from smallpox\n\nFelipe Maria, Infante of Spain (1792 – 1794), died in early childhood\n\nFrancisco de Paula, Infante of Spain (1794 – 1865), married (1) Princess Luisa Carlotta of Naples and Sicily, had eleven (2) morganatic marriage to Teresa de Arredondo y Ramirez de Arellano, had one son\n\nUpon her arrival at the Spanish court, Maria Luisa immediately became the first lady of the court. Maria Amalia of Saxony, Queen of Spain, the mother of her husband, had died from tuberculosis in 1760, and Maria Luisa’s father-in-law King Carlos III never remarried. It was obvious that Maria Luisa was intelligent and ambitious, and had a dominant personality, and her father-in-law attempted to control her and limit her personal freedom, but with little success. Maria Luisa was strong and intellectual and she completely controlled her husband. During the reign of her father-in-law King Carlos III, Maria Luisa led her husband into all sorts of court intrigues.\n\nOn December 14, 1788, King Carlos III of Spain died and was succeeded by his son as King Carlos IV of Spain. Carlos IV would rather hunt than deal with government affairs and the running of the government was left mostly to Queen Maria Luisa and Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy. It is probable that de Godoy had a long-term relationship with Maria Luisa and that he was the father of her youngest son Francisco de Paula.\n\nThe view of the Spanish monarchy among the Spanish people took a rapid decline due to economic troubles, rumors about a relationship between Queen Maria Luisa and de Godoy, and King Carlos IV’s incompetence. Carlos IV’s eldest son and heir Fernando, Prince of Asturias\n\nwas anxious to take over from his father and jealous of Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy. He unsuccessfully attempted to overthrow his father in 1807. After riots and a revolt, King Carlos IV was forced to abdicate in favor of his son King Fernando VII on March 19, 1808. However, less than two months later, Carlos IV and his son Fernando VII were summoned to a meeting with Napoleon I, Emperor of the French on May 7, 1808, at the Castle of Marracq in Bayonne, France, where he forced them both to abdicate, declared the Bourbon dynasty of Spain deposed, and installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte as King of Spain.\n\nMaria Luisa, her husband the former King Carlos IV, some of their children, and former Prime Minister Manuel de Godoy were held captive first in France, at Compiègne and Fontainebleau, and then in Marseilles and Nice, and finally in Rome, then in the Papal States, now in Italy. Napoleon kept Carlos and Maria Luisa’s son Fernando VII under guard in France for more than five years at the Château de Valençay in France until the Treaty of Valençay on December 11, 1813, provided for the restoration of Fernando VII as King of Spain.\n\nEven after the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, King Fernando VII refused to allow his parents to return to Spain. Maria Luisa and Carlos IV settled in Rome at the Palazzo Barberini. On January 2, 1819, at the age of sixty-seven, Maria Luisa died from pneumonia. Her husband Carlos IV died just eighteen days later, on January 20, 1819, aged seventy. Their son King Fernando VII allowed them to return to Spain in death. They were both interred in the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial in El Escorial, Spain.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Born on November 24, 1724, at Dresden Castle, in Dresden, Electorate of Saxony, now in the German state of Saxony, Maria Amalia Christina Franziska Xaveria Flora Walburga was a Princess of Poland and a Princess of Saxony. She was the fourth of the fourteen children and the eldest of the seven daughters of Augustus III, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, who was also Friedrich August II, Elector of Saxony, and Archduchess Maria Josepha of Austria. Maria Amalia’s paternal grandparents were Augustus II, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, who was also Friedrich August I, Elector of Saxony, and Christiane Eberhardine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Her maternal grandparents were Holy Roman Emperor Joseph I and Wilhelmine Amalie of Brunswick -Lüneburg.\n\nMaria Amalia had thirteen siblings:\n\nFriedrich August of Saxony (1720 – 1721), died in infancy\n\nJoseph August of Saxony (1721 – 1728), died in childhood\n\nFriedrich Christian, Elector of Saxony (1722 – 1763), married Maria Antonia of Bavaria, had eight children\n\nMaria Margaretha of Saxony (1727 – 1734), died in childhood\n\nMaria Anna Sophie of Saxony (1728 – 1797), married Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria, no children\n\nFranz Xavier, Regent of Saxony (1730 – 1806), married morganatically Maria Chiara Spinucci, had ten children known as Counts and Countesses of Lusatia\n\nMaria Josepha of Saxony (1731 – 1767), married Louis, Dauphin of France, son of King Louis XV of France, had eight children including three Kings of France: Louis XVI, Louis XVIII, and Charles X\n\nKarl Christian of Saxony (1733 – 1796), married Countess Franciszka Krasińska, had two children\n\nMaria Christina of Saxony, Princess-Abbess of Remiremont (1735 – 1782), unmarried\n\nMaria Elisabeth Apollonia of Saxony (1736 – 1818), unmarried\n\nAlbrecht Kasimir of Saxony, Duke of Teschen and Governor of the Austrian Netherlands (1738 – 1822), married Archduchess Maria Christina of Austria, had one daughter who lived for one day\n\nClemens Wenceslaus of Saxony, Archbishop of Trier (1739 – 1812), unmarried\n\nMaria Kunigunde of Saxony, Princess-Abbess of Thorn and Essen (1740 – 1826), unmarried\n\nMaria Amalia was raised at her father’s court at Dresden Castle in Dresden, Electorate of Saxony, now in the German state of Saxony. She received instruction in foreign languages, mathematics, foreign cultures, theater, and dancing. Maria Amalia was also an excellent musician and sang and played the piano from an early age.\n\nIn 1738, a marriage was arranged for fourteen-year-old Maria Amalia and twenty-two-year-old Carlos of Spain who was then sovereign of two Italian kingdoms as King Carlo VII of Naples and King Carlo V of Sicily. Carlos was the eldest son of Felipe V, the first Bourbon King of Spain and his second wife ​Elisabeth Farnese of Parma, who had arranged the marriage. Carlos was not expected to become King of Spain because he had two elder surviving brothers from his father’s first marriage to Maria Luisa of Savoy.\n\nOn May 8, 1738, a proxy marriage was held in Dresden, Electorate of Saxony, now in Germany with the bride’s brother Friedrich Christian of Saxony standing in for Carlos. Shortly afterward, Maria Amalia traveled to the Kingdom of Naples, and on June 19, 1738, at Portella, a village on the border of the Kingdom of Naples, Carlos and Maria Amalia met for the first time and were married.\n\nMaria Amalia and Carlos had thirteen children but only seven survived childhood. Their children who were born before Carlos became King of Spain were Princes and Princesses of Naples and Sicily. Their children who survived until Carlos became King of Spain were then Infantes and Infantas of Spain.\n\nPrincess Maria Isabel of Naples and Sicily (1740 – 1742), died in early childhood\n\nPrincess Maria Josefa of Naples and Sicily (born and died 1742), died in infancy\n\nPrincess Maria Isabel Ana of Naples and Sicily (1743 – 1749), died in childhood\n\nInfanta Maria Josefa of Spain (1744 – 1801), unmarried\n\nInfanta Maria Luisa of Spain (1745 – 1792), married Pietro Leopoldo I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, later Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, had sixteen children\n\nInfante Felipe of Spain, Duke of Calabria (1747 – 1777), unmarried, excluded from the succession due to learning disabilities and epilepsy, died from smallpox\n\nCarlos IV, King of Spain (1748 – 1819), married Princess Maria Luisa of Parma, had fourteen children\n\nPrincess Maria Teresa of Naples and Sicily (1749 – 1750), died in infancy\n\nFerdinando I, King of the Two Sicilies (1751 – 1825), married (1) Maria Carolina of Austria, had seventeen children (2) Lucia Migliaccio, Duchess of Floridia, morganatic marriage, no children\n\nInfante Gabriel of Spain (1752 – 1788), married Infanta Mariana Vitória of Portugal, had three children\n\nPrincess Maria Ana of Naples and Sicily (1754 – 1755), died in infancy\n\nInfante Antonio Pascual of Spain (1755 – 1817), married his niece Infanta Maria Amalia of Spain, no children\n\nInfante Francisco Javier of Spain (1757 – 1771), died in his teens from smallpox\n\nAs Queen of Naples and Sicily, Maria Amalia had great influence and took an active part in state affairs. After the birth of her first son in 1747, she was given a seat on the council of state. Maria Amalia ended the careers of several politicians she disliked. She played an important role in the planning and construction of the Royal Palace of Caserta.\n\nCarlos’ father Felipe V, King of Spain died of a stroke at the age of 62 on July 9, 1746, and Carlos’ only surviving elder half-brother Fernando succeeded to the Spanish throne as Fernando VI, King of Spain and reigned for thirteen years. However, Fernando’s marriage to Barbara of Portugal produced no children, and so upon his death in 1759, his elder surviving half-brother, Maria Amalia’s husband Carlos, succeeded him as King Carlos III of Spain. With great sadness, by both Carlos and the people of Naples and Sicily, Carlos abdicated the thrones of Naples and Sicily in favor of his eight-year-old third son Ferdinando with a regency council ruling until his sixteenth birthday.\n\nMaria Amalia, her husband, and their surviving children moved from Naples to Madrid, Spain in the autumn of 1759. Besides leaving their third son Ferdinando who was now King of Naples and Sicily, they left their eldest son Felipe who was excluded from the succession due to learning disabilities and epilepsy. Felipe lived hidden away at the Palace of Portici in the Kingdom of Naples, occasionally being visited by his brother King Ferdinando. Felipe died, aged 30, in 1777, from smallpox.\n\nMaria Amalia had lived in her husband’s Italian kingdoms for twenty-one years and did not like Spain. She complained about the food, the language, which she refused to learn, the climate, the Spaniards, whom she regarded as passive, and the Spanish courtiers, whom she regarded as ignorant and uneducated. She planned reforms for the Spanish court but did not have time to complete them.\n\nOn September 27, 1760, a year after arriving in Spain, 35-year-old Maria Amalia died from tuberculosis at the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid, Spain, and was buried in the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial. Upon Maria Amalia’s death, her husband Carlos said, “In twenty-two years of marriage, this is the first serious upset that Amalia has given me.” After Maria Amalia’s death, Carlos remained unmarried. He survived his wife by twenty-eight years, dying, aged 72, on December 14, 1788, at the Royal Palace of Madrid in Spain. He was buried in the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Carlos III was the eldest of the six children and the eldest of the three sons of Felipe V, the first Bourbon King of Spain and his second wife ​Elisabeth Farnese of Parma. His paternal grandparents were Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, the heir apparent to the throne of France, and Maria Anna Victoria of Bavaria. Carlos’ maternal grandparents were Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma and Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg.\n\nCarlos’ father had been born a French prince, Philippe, Duke of Anjou, the second son of Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, who was the son and heir apparent of King Louis XIV of France. In 1700, King Carlos II of Spain, from the House of Habsburg, died childless with no immediate Habsburg heir. Louis, Le Grand Dauphin had the strongest genealogical claim to the Spanish throne because his mother Maria Theresa, Infanta of Spain had been the half-sister of Carlos II. However, neither Louis, Le Grand Dauphin nor his elder son Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Le Petit Dauphin could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne. Therefore, King Carlos II of Spain, in his will, named the second son of Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, 16-year-old Philippe, Duke of Anjou, as his successor. He reigned as Felipe V, King of Spain, the first Bourbon monarch of Spain.\n\nCarlos had five younger siblings:\n\nMariana Victoria, Infanta of Spain (1718 – 1781), married José I, King of Portugal, had four daughters\n\nFelipe, Infante of Spain, Duke of Parma (1720 – 1765), Louise Élisabeth of France, founder of the House of Bourbon-Parma, had three children\n\nMaria Theresa Rafaela, Infanta of Spain (1726 – 1746), married Louis, Dauphin of France, had one daughter who did not survive childhood\n\nLouis, Count of Chinchón (1727 – 1785), Archbishop of Toledo, Primate of Spain and Cardinal renounced his ecclesiastical titles, married morganatically María Teresa de Vallabriga, had four children\n\nMaria Antonietta Fernanda, Infanta of Spain (1729 – 1785), wife of Vittorio Amadeo III, King of Sardinia, had twelve children\n\nFrom his father’s first marriage to Maria Luisa of Savoy, Carlos had four half-siblings:\n\nLuis I, King of Spain (1707 – 1724), married Louise Élisabeth of Orléans, no children\n\nFelipe, Infante of Spain (born and died 1709)\n\nFelipe, Infante of Spain (1712 – 1719)\n\nFernando VI, King of Spain (1713 – 1759), married Bárbara of Portugal, no surviving children\n\nCarlos’ mother Elisabeth Farnese of Parma never showed affection toward her two stepsons Luis and Fernando. She considered her stepsons to be obstacles to achieving her main objective: to provide her sons with realms to rule. On January 14, 1724, Felipe V abdicated the Spanish throne to Luis, his seventeen-year-old eldest son from his first marriage, for reasons that are still unclear. Perhaps it was because Felipe V suffered from mental instability and did not wish to reign due to his increasing mental decline. Another theory is that Felipe V was concerned about the succession to the French throne due to several deaths. Although the treaty that ended the War of the Spanish Succession forbade a union of the French and Spanish crowns, perhaps Felipe V hoped that by abdicating the Spanish throne, he could succeed to the French throne if necessary. However, seven months later, Felipe V was forced to once again ascend to the Spanish throne because his son King Luis I died of smallpox and Felipe V’s younger son from his first marriage, the future King Fernando VI, was not yet of legal age.\n\nIn 1731, the male line of the House of Farnese ruling in the Duchy of Parma went extinct. The duchy passed to Felipe V, King of Spain whose second wife Elisabeth Farnese was the Farnese heiress. Felipe V made Carlos, his eldest son with Elizabeth Farnese, the Duke of Parma. However, Felipe V traded the Duchy of Parma to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine for the Kingdom of Naples in 1734 and the Kingdom of Sicily in 1735, and Carlos became King of Naples and Sicily. During his reign in Naples and Sicily as Carlo VII or Carlo di Borbone, which the people called him, he tried to reform and modernize the kingdoms, winning the affection of the citizens.\n\nIn 1738, Carlos’ mother Elisabeth Farnese arranged a marriage for him to fourteen-year-old Maria Amalia of Saxony, daughter of Augustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony and Maria Josepha of Austria. On May 8, 1738, a proxy marriage was held in Dresden, Electorate of Saxony, now in Germany with the bride’s brother Friedrich Christian of Saxony standing in for Carlos. Shortly afterward, Maria Amalia traveled to the Kingdom of Naples, and on June 19, 1738, at Portella, a village on the border of the Kingdom of Naples, Carlos and Maria Amalia met for the first time and were married.\n\nCarlos III and Maria Amalia had thirteen children but only seven survived childhood.

He experienced episodes of manic depression. During several periods, Felipe V was unable to handle government affairs and Carlos’ mother Elisabeth became the de facto ruler of Spain. Felipe V, King of Spain died of a stroke at the age of 62 on July 9, 1746, and Carlos’ elder half-brother Fernando succeeded to the Spanish throne as Fernando VI, King of Spain, and reigned for thirteen years. However, his marriage to Barbara of Portugal produced no children, and so upon his death in 1759, his elder surviving half-brother succeeded him as King Carlos III of Spain.\n\nWith great sadness, by both Carlos and the people of Naples and Sicily, Carlos abdicated the thrones of Naples and Sicily in favor of his eight-year-old third son Ferdinando with a regency council ruling until his sixteenth birthday. Ferdinando was deposed twice from the throne of Naples: once by the revolutionary Parthenopean Republic for six months in 1799 and again by Napoleon in 1805, before being restored in 1816 after the defeat of Napoleon. After the 1816 restoration, the two kingdoms were united into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and he reigned as King Ferdinando I of the Two Sicilies.\n\nOn September 27, 1760, a year after arriving in Spain, Carlos’ 35-year-old wife Maria Amalia suddenly died and was buried in the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial. Upon Maria Amalia’s death, Carlos said, “In twenty-two years of marriage, this is the first serious upset that Amalia has given me.” After Maria Amalia’s death, Carlos remained unmarried.\n\nWhen Carlos became King of Spain, he was 43 years old and had ruled Naples and Sicily for twenty-five years, so he had far more experience than his predecessors. King Carlos III challenged the conservative Spanish government with his enlightened reform ideas and faced some opposition. The Spanish court was more rigid and somber than the cosmopolitan court of Naples and Sicily. Carlos III ruled as an enlightened despot, an absolute monarch who incorporated ideas of the Enlightenment. He promoted education, pushed back the influence of the Roman Catholic Church by expelling the Jesuits from the Spanish Empire, and strengthened the Spanish army and navy. Carlos III was responsible for some Spain’s national symbols. In 1770, he declared the Marcha Granadera to be used during official ceremonies. Since that time, it has been Spain’s national anthem except under the Second Republic ( 1931 – 1939 ). Carlos III also chose the colors and design of the Spanish flag as we see it today.\n\nCarlos III, King of Spain, survived his wife by twenty-eight years, dying, aged 72, on December 14, 1788, at the Royal Palace of Madrid in Spain. He was buried in the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Monastery of El Escorial.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was the second but the only surviving of the two children and the only daughter of Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma and Dorothea Sophie of Neuburg. Elisabeth’s paternal grandparents were Ranuccio II Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza and Isabella d’Este. Her maternal grandparents were Philipp Wilhelm of Neuburg, Elector Palatine and Elisabeth Amalie of Hesse-Darmstadt.\n\nElisabeth had one older brother who died in early childhood:\n\nAlessandro Ignazio Farnese (1691- 1693)\n\nElisabeth’s father died in 1693, only a month after the death of her brother. In 1696, Elisabeth’s mother Dorothea married her father’s half-brother, Francesco Farnese, who had become Duke of Parma when his father died in 1694. Francesco married his half-brother’s widow because he did not want to give up Dorothea’s dowry should she marry someone else. Their marriage was childless. Because of the lack of male heirs of Elisabeth’s father, her uncle-stepfather, and her youngest uncle, both succeeded one another as Duke of Parma. Changes were legally made for the succession of the Duchy of Parma in the female line through Elisabeth. Eventually, her second son Felipe, Infant of Spain became the Duke of Parma and founded the House of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nElisabeth had a good relationship with her uncle and stepfather Francesco Farnese, Duke of Parma. After her marriage, Elisabeth maintained a correspondence with Francesco until he died in 1727. However, Elisabeth had a distant relationship with her mother who treated her very severely. Although Elisabeth had a mediocre intelligence and was not interested in intellectual pursuits, she spoke German, French, Latin, and Spanish in addition to her native Italian, and studied history, geography, philosophy, and religion.\n\nIn 1714, Maria Luisa of Savoy, the wife of Felipe V, King of Spain, died from tuberculosis at the age of twenty-five. Thirty-one-year-old Felipe V almost immediately sought a new wife and there was no shortage of possibilities. At this time, the key powerbroker at the Spanish court was Marie-Anne de la Trémoille, Princesse des Ursins, a French courtier and royal favorite known for her political influence. She had dominated Felipe V and his first wife Maria Luisa. The Princesse des Ursins worked with Cardinal Giulio Alberoni, the chief adviser of Felipe V, and they arranged for Felipe V to marry Elisabeth.\n\nFelipe V, King of Spain had been born Philippe of France, Duke of Anjou. He was the second of the three sons of Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, the only surviving child of King Louis XIV of France, and the heir apparent to the throne of France. In 1700, Carlos II, King of Spain died childless with no immediate Habsburg heir. Philippe’s father Louis, Le Grand Dauphin had the strongest genealogical claim to the throne of Spain because his mother Maria Teresa, Infanta of Spain had been the half-sister of Carlos II, King of Spain. However, neither Philippe’s father nor his elder brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy, could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne. Therefore, Carlos II, King of Spain named 16-year-old Philippe of Anjou, Duke of Anjou as his successor. Felipe V was the first Spanish monarch from the House of Bourbon, which is still the ruling house of Spain.\n\nOn September 16, 1714, Elisabeth and Felipe V were married by proxy in the Duchy of Parma. Elisabeth left Parma in September and traveled to Spain by land. On her way to Spain, she was the guest of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco, and she visited her maternal aunt Maria Anna of Neuburg, Dowager Queen of Spain who had settled in Bayonne, France after King Felipe V had exiled her from Spain. On December 24, 1714, ten months after the death of Felipe V’s first wife, Elisabeth and Felipe V were married in Guadalajara, Spain. Felipe V was enthusiastic about his new wife, and Elisabeth soon dominated her weak-willed and indecisive husband. She spent a great deal of time with him, often accompanying him on hunts, where she displayed her excellent riding and shooting skills.\n\nElisabeth and Felipe V had six children:\n\nCarlos III, King of Spain (1716 – 1788), married Maria Amalia of Saxony, had thirteen children including Carlos IV, King of Spain\n\nMariana Victoria, Infanta of Spain (1718 – 1781), married José I, King of Portugal, had four daughters\n\nFelipe, Infante of Spain, Duke of Parma (1720 – 1765), Louise Élisabeth of France, founder of the House of Bourbon-Parma, had three children\n\nMaria Theresa Rafaela, Infanta of Spain (1726 – 1746), married Louis, Dauphin of France, had one daughter who did not survive childhood, Maria Theresa Rafaela died in childbirth\n\nLouis, Count of Chinchón (1727 – 1785), Archbishop of Toledo, Primate of Spain and Cardinal, renounced his ecclesiastical titles, married morganatically María Teresa de Vallabriga, had four children\n\nMaria Antonietta Fernanda, Infanta of Spain (1729 – 1785), wife of Vittorio Amadeo III, King of Sardinia, had twelve children\n\nUpon her marriage, Elisabeth became the stepmother of Felipe V’s children from his first marriage. By 1719, only two of the four children had survived. Elisabeth never showed affection toward her stepsons. She considered her stepsons to be obstacles to achieving her main objective: to provide her sons with a realm to rule.\n\nElisabeth’s stepsons:\n\nLuis I, King of Spain (1707 – 1724), married Louise Élisabeth of Orléans, no children\n\nFernando VI, King of Spain (1713 – 1759), married Bárbara of Portugal, no surviving children\n\nKing Felipe V of Spain experienced episodes of manic depression. During several periods (1717, 1722, 1728, 1731, 1732–33, and 1737), Felipe V was unable to handle government affairs and Elisabeth became the de facto ruler. Elisabeth was not interested in domestic policy and preferred foreign policy, where her goal was to enforce the Spanish presence in the Italian states, combined with her ambition for her own sons, who were initially not expected to succeed in Spain because her stepsons were ahead of them in the line of succession.\n\nOn January 14, 1724, Felipe V abdicated the Spanish throne to Luis, his seventeen-year-old eldest son from his first marriage, for reasons that are still unclear. Perhaps it was because Felipe suffered from mental instability and did not wish to reign due to his increasing mental decline. Another theory is that Felipe was concerned about the succession to the French throne due to several deaths. Although the treaty that ended the War of the Spanish Succession forbade a union of the French and Spanish crowns, perhaps Felipe hoped that by abdicating the Spanish throne, he could succeed to the French throne if necessary. However, seven months later, Felipe was forced to once again become King of Spain because King Luis I died of smallpox and Felipe’s younger son from his first marriage, the future King Fernando VI, was not yet of legal age.\n\nAs he grew older, Felipe V’s mental issues worsened and Elisabeth became the permanent de facto ruler of Spain. Only the singing of the Italian castrato opera singer Farinelli (born Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola Broschi) brought any peace to Felipe. Farinelli would sing eight or nine arias for Felipe and Elisabeth every night, usually with a trio of musicians.\n\nOn July 9, 1746, 62-year-old Felipe V had a stroke and died a few hours later in Elisabeth’s arms. Just thirteen days later, Elisabeth’s 20-year-old daughter Maria Theresa Rafaela died three days after giving birth to a daughter who died two years later. Elisabeth had long feared that when her husband died, she would lose power, especially since the heir to the throne, the future King Fernando VI, was not her own son, but Felipe V’s last surviving son from his first marriage. Elisabeth was unpopular with the Spanish people, had ill-treated Fernando, and excluded him from government affairs. After Fernando became king, he allowed Elisabeth to stay in Spain. However, she had to move out of the Royal Palace in Buen Retiro and into the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, known as La Granja.\n\nElisabeth’s stepson Fernando VI, King of Spain reigned for thirteen years. During the last year of his reign, Fernando VI rapidly lost his mental capacity and was held at the Castle of Villaviciosa de Odón, near Madrid, until his death on August 10, 1759. Fernando VI’s marriage to Barbara of Portugal was childless and so upon his death, Elisabeth’s elder surviving son succeeded his half-brother as King Carlos III of Spain.\n\nAll subsequent monarchs of Spain from the House of Bourbon are descendants of King Carlos III of Spain. Therefore, Elisabeth is the ancestor of the House of Bourbon that still reigns in Spain. And so Elisabeth achieved the goal she set so long ago. Her elder son became King of Spain and her younger son Felipe became sovereign Duke of Parma and founder of the House of Bourbon-Parma. Although the House of Bourbon-Parma no longer reigns, the pretender to the throne of the Duchy of Parma is Elisabeth’s descendant.\n\nElisabeth spent the last years of her life at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez and the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso. On July 11, 1766, aged 73, Elisabeth died at the Royal Palace of Aranjuez in Aranjuez, Spain. When Elisabeth’s husband King Felipe V of Spain, born a Prince of France, died, he requested not to be buried at the traditional burial site, the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Crypt of the Royal Basilica of San Lorenzo de El Escorial in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain. Instead, Felipe V requested to be buried in the Collegiate Church of the Holy Trinity at the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, known as La Granja, in the province of Segovia in central Spain. The architecture of La Granja reminded him of the longed-for French court of his childhood. Elisabeth was buried at his side.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

She was the third of the six children and the third of the three daughters of Vittorio Amedeo II, King of Sardinia and Anne Marie of Orléans. Maria Luisa’s paternal grandparents were Carlo Emanuele II, Duke of Savoy and his second wife Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Nemours. Her maternal grandparents were Philippe I, Duke of Orléans (son of King Louis XIII of France and the only sibling of King Louis XIV of France) and Princess Henrietta of England (daughter of King Charles I of England).\n\nMaria Luisa had five siblings:\n\nMaria Adelaide of Savoy (1685 – 1712), married Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Le Petit Dauphin, eldest son of Louis, Grand Dauphin, had three children including King Louis XV of France\n\nMaria Anna of Savoy (1687 – 1690), died in early childhood\n\nVittorio Amadeo of Savoy (1699 – 1715) died in his teens\n\nCarlo Emanuele III, King of Sardinia (1701 – 1773), married (1) Anna Christine of Sulzbach, had one son who died in infancy (2) Polyxena of Hesse-Rheinfels-Rotenburg, had six children, two died in infancy (3) Elisabeth Thérèse of Lorraine, had three children, only one survived childhood\n\nEmanuele Filberto of Savoy (born and died 1705), died in infancy\n\nIn 1700, Carlos II, King of Spain died childless with no immediate Habsburg heir. Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, son of King Louis XIV of France and the heir apparent to the French throne had the strongest genealogical claim to the Spanish throne because his mother Maria Theresa, Infanta of Spain had been the half-sister of Carlos II. However, neither Louis, Le Grand Dauphin nor his elder son Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Le Petit Dauphin could be displaced from their place in the succession to the French throne. Therefore, Carlos II, King of Spain, in his will, had named the second son of Louis, Le Grand Dauphin, 16-year-old Philippe, Duke of Anjou, as his successor. He reigned as Felipe V, King of Spain, the first Bourbon monarch of Spain.\n\nSoon after his arrival in Spain, King Felipe V’s grandfather King Louis XIV arranged a marriage for him. In order to strengthen Felipe V’s shaky authority over Spain due to his French birth, King Louis XIV decided to maintain ties with Vittorio Amadeo II, then Duke of Savoy, whose eldest daughter Marie Adelaide of Savoy was already married to Felipe V’s elder brother Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Le Petit Dauphin. Felipe V was betrothed to thirteen-year-old Maria Luisa of Savoy. In Turin, Duchy of Savoy, Felipe and Maria Luisa were married by proxy on September 12, 1701. Maria Luisa then left for Spain where the young couple met for the first time on November 2, 1701, and were married in person at a local parish church in Figueres, Spain.\n\nMaria Luisa and Felipe V had four sons but only two survived childhood and they both had childless marriages:\n\nLuis I, King of Spain (1707 – 1724), married Louise Élisabeth of Orléans, no children\n\nFelipe, Infante of Spain (born and died 1709), died in infancy\n\nFelipe, Infante of Spain (1712 – 1719), died in childhood\n\nFernando VI, King of Spain (1713 – 1759), married Bárbara of Portugal, no surviving children\n\nMaria Luisa and Felipe V had a loving, happy marriage. She acted as Regent of Spain from 1702 until 1703 during Felipe V’s absence due to the War of the Spanish Succession and had great influence over him as his adviser. Sadly, Maria Luisa died from tuberculosis at the age of 25 on February 14, 1714. She was buried in the Pantheon of Kings in the Royal Basilica of San Lorenzo de El Escorial in San Lorenzo de El Escorial, Spain.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The basilica is the burial site for some members of the House of Anjou-Naples (reigned the in Kingdom of Naples 1282 – 1435) and the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (reigned 1759 – 1861). Besides the basilica, the complex includes an adjoining monastery and an archaeological museum.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Kingdom of the Two Sicilies Index\n\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was located in today’s southern Italy. It included the island of Sicily and all of the Italian peninsula south of the Papal States. Ferdinando I, the first King of the Two Sicilies, had previously reigned over two kingdoms, as Ferdinando IV of the Kingdom of Naples and Ferdinando III of the Kingdom of Sicily. In 1816, the two kingdoms were merged into the Kingdom of Two Sicilies.\n\nKings of Two Sicilies\n\nFerdinando I, King of the Two Sicilies (reigned 1816 – 1825), King of Naples and Sicily (reigned 1759 – 1816)\n\nFrancesco I, King of the Two Sicilies (reigned 1825 – 1830)\n\nFerdinando II, King of the Two Sicilies (reigned 1830 – 1859)\n\nFrancesco II, King of the Two Sicilies (reigned 1859 – 1861, monarchy abolished)\n\n*********************\n\nHistory of the Basilica of Santa Chiara\n\nConstruction began in 1310 during the reign of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples (1276 – 1343), founder of the Basilica and Monastery of Santa Chiara, who is interred in a tomb above the main altar. Naples architect Gagliardo Primario (link in Italian) designed the basilica in the Gotico Angioiano style, an early Gothic style in southern Italy named after the House of Anjou. The interior was decorated with the works of the most important artists of the time including sculptor Tino di Camaino and painter Giotto. Work on the basilica was mostly finished by 1328 but the consecration to Saint Clare of Assisi did not take place until 1340.\n\nFrom 1742 to 1762, the interior was refurbished in a Baroque style by a group of artists led by painter, sculptor, and architect Domenico Vaccaro. The stuccoed ceiling was replaced with frescoes by a team of artists including Francesco De Mura, Giuseppe Bonito, Sebastiano Conca, and Paolo de Maio. The floor was paved in marble with a design by Ferdinando Fuga.\n\nDuring World War II, on August 4, 1943, American Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress aircraft targeted the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) submarine base in Naples. The resulting fire that lasted two days severely damaged the Basilica of Santa Chiara and caused the loss of all the frescoes painted during 18th-century refurbishment and most of the Giotto’s 14th-century frescoes.\n\nOn the left, the interior with the 18th-century Baroque refurbishment; On the right, the interior today with the surviving original Gothic interior; Credit – Wikipedia\n\nThe restoration work started in 1944 and concentrated on the 14th-century architecture that remained intact, restoring the basilica to its original 14th-century appearance and removing the 18th-century refurbishments. The restoration work was completed in 1953 and the basilica was reopened to the public. Pillars, friezes, marble fragments, and sculptures that had been removed from the basilica were moved to a room in the monastery, that became the Marble Room, a part of the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Chiara (link in Italian). The goal of the museum is to reconstruct the history of the Basilica of Santa Chiara.\n\n*********************\n\nThe Exterior of the Basilica of Santa Chiara\n\nThe exterior of the Basilica of Santa Chiara is quite simple. The entrance consists of a large 14th-century Gothic portal, with a porch and three arched openings. Over the entrance, the facade has a wide pinnacle in which an openwork rose window is set.\n\nTo the left of the church is the bell tower, a separate structure. It was started in 1338 but not completed due to a lack of funds after the death of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples in 1343. Work began again at the beginning of the 15th century but an earthquake in 1456 collapsed most of the bell tower, leaving only the marble base. The bell tower was finally completed in 1601 in the Baroque style.\n\n*********************\n\nThe Interior of the Basilica of Santa Chiara\n\nThe interior has a single rectangular nave with no decoration and without a transept or choir. The transept is the part of the body of a church, usually crossing the nave, at right angles, at the entrance to the choir, forming a cross. The eighteenth-century marble floor by Ferdinando Fuga was part of the Baroque refurbishment that survived the bombings of World War II.\n\nThere are ten side chapels on each side of the nave, for a total of twenty, with circular arches at each entrance. Each chapel is dedicated to a saint and many of them contain tombs of noble Neapolitan families from the14th through 17th centuries.\n\nThe Main Altar\n\nThe main altar is a plain, simple table. A large wooden crucifix from the 14th century, probably by an unknown Sienese artist, stands behind the altar.\n\nBehind the altar, the marble tomb of the basilica’s founder Robert of Anjou, King of Naples towers over the altar. The tomb was sculpted by the Florentine sculptors, the brothers Giovanni and Pacio Bertini (links in Italian) between 1343 and 1345. The tomb contains sculptures of members of Robert’s family. Robert’s effigy is dressed in a Franciscan habit. At the top of the tomb, Robert sits on a throne.\n\nThe Bourbon Chapel\n\nThe 18th-century Bourbon Chapel, which survived the World War II bombing, is directly to the right of the main altar. Carlo IV, King of Naples and King of Sicily (later Carlos III, King of Spain) had the chapel built beginning in 1742. It was to be a temporary burial place while the burial vault under the basilica was being built. However, it has remained the burial place of the four Kings of Two Sicilies and their wives, with one exception. Several children of Carlo IV, King of Naples and King of Sicily (reigned 1734 – 1759) who died before he became Carlos III, King of Spain in 1759 were also remain interred in the Bourbon Chapel.\n\nOn the floor of the Bourbon Chapel is the access to the royal crypt which is decorated with the coat of arms of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\n*********************\n\nJanuary 25, 2014 – The Beatification of Blessed Maria Cristina of Savoy, Queen of the Two Sicilies\n\nMaria Cristina of Savoy, Queen of the Two Sicilies (1812 – 1836) was the first wife of Ferdinando II, King of the Two Sicilies, and has been venerated in the Roman Catholic Church as Blessed Maria Cristina of Savoy since her beatification in 2014. She was shy, modest, reserved, and a very devout Catholic. After her marriage to Ferdinando II, she found herself living in a court with a lifestyle that was very far from her sensitivity. This caused her to never feel quite comfortable. During the short time that she was Queen of the Two Sicilies, Maria Cristina managed to prevent the carrying out of all death sentences. She was called “the Holy Queen” for her deep religious devotion. Maria Cristina endured her nearly constant illnesses with patience and piety and was popular with the people for her charity, modesty, and humility. On January 21, 1836, five days after giving birth to her only child, the future Francesco II, King of the Two Sicilies, 23-year-old Maria Cristina died from childbirth complications and was buried at the Basilica of Santa Chiara.\n\nIn 1859, a cause for the canonization of Maria Cristina as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church was opened. On July 10, 1872, Maria Cristina was declared to be a Servant of God and on May 6, 1937, she was declared a Venerable Servant of God. On May 3, 2013, Pope Francis authorized a decree recognizing a miracle due to her intercession and approved Maria Cristina’s beatification. She is known in the Roman Catholic Church as Blessed Maria Cristina of Savoy and is one step away from canonization as a saint.\n\nOn January 25, 2014, the Basilica of Santa Chiara in Naples, Italy, where Maria Cristina is interred in the Bourbon Chapel, was the site of her beatification ceremony. Several thousand people attended the ceremony including members of the two branches of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies led by Carlos, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Infante of Spain, Duke of Calabria and Carlo, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Castro. Both branches claim to be Head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and this event united them for the first time in fifty years. Carlos, Prince of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Infante of Spain, Duke of Calabria, who died the following year, did not attend the beatification and was represented by his wife. Following the beatification ceremony, members of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies paid their respects at the tomb of Blessed Maria Cristina of Savoy.\n\nRoyal House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies: Beatification of Maria Cristina of Savoy\n\n**********************\n\nBurials of the House of Anjou-Naples (reigned 1282 – 1435)\n\nIn the photo above, the tomb of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples, is immediately behind the main altar. To the right of the altar is the tomb of Robert of Anjou’s son Charles, Duke of Calabria. To the left of the altar is the tomb of Maria of Calabria, daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria and granddaughter of Robert of Anjou, whose descendants inherited the crown of Naples following the death of her older sister Joanna I, Queen of Naples who had succeeded her paternal grandfather Robert of Anjou, King of Naples.\n\nRobert of Anjou, King of Naples (1276 – 1343), founder of the Basilica and Monastery of Santa Chiara, interred in a tomb immediately behind the high altar\n\nYolanda of Aragon, Duchess of Calabria (1273 – 1302), 1st wife of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\n\nSancha of Majorca, Queen of Naples (circa 1281 – 1345), 2nd wife of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples, originally buried at the Monastery of Santa Maria della Croce in Naples, later her remains were transferred to the Basilica of Santa Chiara\n\nLouis of Anjou (1301 – 1310), son of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\n\nCharles, Duke of Calabria (1298 – 1328), son of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\n\nMarie of Valois, Duchess of Calabria (1309 – 1331), wife of Charles, Duke of Calabria, mother of Joanna I, Queen of Naples\n\nMaria of Anjou, Queen of Majorca (1290 – 1347), daughter of Charles II, King of Naples and sister of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\n\nMaria of Calabria, Countess of Alba (1329 – 1366), daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria, granddaughter of Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\n\nJoanna I, Queen of Naples (1325 – 1382), daughter of Charles, Duke of Calabria, succeeded her grandfather Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\n\n**********************\n\nBurials of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (reigned 1759 – 1861)\n\nThe four Kings of the Two Sicilies and their wives, with one exception, were buried in the baroque-style Bourbon Chapel which was not damaged in the 1943 World War II bombing. The wife of Ferdinando I, Maria Carolina of Austria, was buried in her native Austria, at the Imperial Crypt in the Capuchin Church in Vienna, the traditional burial site of her birth family, the House of Habsburg.\n\nBuried in the Bourbon Chapel are:\n\nFerdinando I, King of the Two Sicilies\n\nFrancesco I, King of the Two Sicilies and his two wives Maria Clementina of Austria, Duchess of Calabria and Maria Isabella of Spain, Queen of the Two Sicilies\n\nFerdinando II, King of the Two Sicilies and his two wives Maria Cristina of Savoy, Queen of the Two Sicilies and Maria Theresa of Austria, Queen of the Two Sicilies\n\nFrancesco II, King of the Two Sicilies, his wife Maria Sophie of Bavaria, Queen of the Two Sicilies, and their daughter Maria Cristina\n\nThe remains of Francesco II, the last King of the Two Sicilies, his wife Maria Sophia of Bavaria, and their daughter Maria Cristina who died in infancy were originally buried at the Church of the Holy Spirit of the Neapolitans in Rome. In 1984, their remains were transferred to the Bourbon Chapel. Several children of Carlo IV, King of Naples and Sicily (reigned 1734 – 1759) who died before he became Carlos III, King of Spain and abdicated the throne of Naples and Sicily in favor of his son Ferdinando in 1759, were also buried in the Bourbon Chapel. Other members of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies were interred in the royal crypt which is reached by the entrance in the floor of the Bourbon Crypt. (Photo above in the Bourbon Chapel section.)\n\nIt will be noticed that many offspring of Ferdinand I died as children and some are listed as “of Naples and Sicily.” Ferdinando I reigned as King of Naples and Sicily from 1759 – 1816, and then as King of the Two Sicilies from 1816 – 1825. Ferdinando I and his wife Maria Carolina of Austria had seventeen children but ten died in childhood.

The Royal Crypt, built under the Basilica of Superga, is one of the traditional burial places of the members of the House of Savoy. Two Kings of Italy (who came from the House of Savoy), Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I, were interred in the Pantheon in Rome. The earlier generations of the House of Savoy as well as Carlo Felice, King of Sardinia and Umberto II, the last King of Italy, are buried in Hautecombe Abbey, the ancestral burial site of the House of Savoy, now in Saint-Pierre-de-Curtille near Aix-les-Bains in Savoy, France.\n\nThe House of Savoy had been Counts and then Dukes of Savoy, since the 11th century and ruled from the city of Turin, now in northern Italy. Vittorio Amedeo II, Duke of Savoy became King of Sicily in 1713 as a result of his participation in the War of the Spanish Succession. However, in 1720, Vittorio Amedeo II was forced to exchange the Kingdom of Sicily for the less important Kingdom of Sardinia after objections from the Quadruple Alliance (Great Britain, France, Habsburg Austria, and the Dutch Republic).\n\nSardinia, now in Italy, is the second-largest island in the Mediterranean Sea after Sicily but the Kings of Sardinia of the House of Savoy ruled from Turin, the capital of the Duchy of Savoy. They styled themselves as Kings of Sardinia because the title was superior to their original lesser title as Dukes of Savoy. However, they retained the regnal numerical order of the Dukes of Savoy. The children of the Kings of Sardinia were styled “of Savoy.”\n\nVittorio Emanuele II became the last King of Sardinia upon the abdication of his father in 1849. He then became a driving force behind the Italian unification movement along with Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and nationalist, and Giuseppe Mazzini, a politician and journalist. Garibaldi conquered Naples and Sicily, the territories of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, while the Sardinian troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. With all the newly acquired land, Vittorio Emanuele II was proclaimed the first King of the new, united Kingdom of Italy in 1861.\n\n*********************\n\nHistory of the Basilica of Superga\n\nOfficial Website: The Basilica of Superga\n\nThe Basilica of Superga, now in Turin, Italy, is located at the top of the Superga, a 2,205 ft/672-meter hill. During the 117-day 1706 Siege of Turin in the War of the Spanish Succession, over 44,000 French soldiers surrounded the fortified citadel of Turin defended by about 10,500 Savoy soldiers. On August 28, 1706, Vittorio Amedeo II, Duke of Savoy (later the first King of Sardinia) and his cousin Prince Eugenio of Savoy-Carignano climbed the Superga hill to better examine the position of troops so they could develop battle strategies. On September 2, 1706, Vittorio Amedeo II and Eugenio once again climbed the Superga. They entered a small church on the hill where Vittorio Amedeo II prostrated himself in front of a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary as Madonna delle Grazie, Our Lady of Grace, and vowed that if the Virgin Mary allowed him to be victorious in, the Siege of Turin, he would build a magnificent church at the top of the hill dedicated to her. On September 7, 1706, the forces of Vittoria Amadeo II and Eugenio won a victory.\n\nVittorio Amedeo II kept his vow and commissioned Italian architect Filippo Juvarra to design the magnificent church at the top of the Superga. The Basilica of Superga, designed in the Rococo and Neoclassical styles, was constructed from 1717 to 1731. On November 1, 1731, the Basilica of Superga was consecrated and dedicated to Our Lady of Grace whose original wooden statue that Vittorio Amadeo II had prostrated himself before is kept in the Chapel of the Vow on the left side of the main altar of the Basilica of Superga.\n\nOn May 4, 1949, an airplane carrying the Italian football (soccer) team Torino Football Club nicknamed Il Grande Torino, was returning to Turin, Italy after traveling to Lisbon, Portugal where the team had played the Portuguese football (soccer) team Benfica. At around 5:00 PM, the airplane was flying over the outskirts of Turin and was preparing for landing, when pilot Pierluigi Meroni, a World War II flying veteran, was warned that the weather in Turin was poor with fog, showers, and strong wind gusts. Minutes later, the airplane crashed into the retaining wall at the back of the Basilica of Superga. All thirty-one passengers which included players, coaching staff, team officials, journalists, and the flight crew were killed. Only three players who did not travel with the team because of injury or illness escaped the disaster. The walls damaged by the impact of the airplane are still visible, as it was decided not to rebuild them. This tragic event is commemorated by a museum and a plaque on the rear building, and a solemn mass is celebrated at the basilica every May 4 in memory of the victims.\n\nBBC: The plane crash that killed Serie A’s champions and their English coach\n\n*********************\n\nThe Exterior of the Basilica of Superga\n\nDuring the construction, building materials were carried up the hill by donkeys. The hill was leveled by about 131 feet/40 meters to create a flat area for the basilica’s construction. A staircase leads to a large portico supported by eight Corinthian columns inspired by the Pantheon in Rome. Atop the basilica is a 213-foot/65-meter high Baroque-style dome with two symmetrical bell towers on either side.\n\n*********************\n\nThe Interior of the Basilica of Superga\n\nThe interior was designed with a Greek cross plan, a church plan in the form of a Greek cross, with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. The diagram below shows the difference between the Greek cross plan and the more widely used Latin cross plan.\n\nThe interior has six chapels, four altars, and the main altar which is decorated with sculptures and monuments in Carrara marble. In the Vow Chapel is the original wooden statue of the Madonna delle Grazie, Our Lady of Grace, the statue Vittorio Amedeo II knelt in front of, and asked for the grace to defeat the French army.\n\n*********************\n\nBurials at the Basilica of Superga\n\nThe original plans for the Basilica of Superga included a burial crypt but the plans were temporarily shelved because of funding issues. In 1774, forty-three years after the consecration of the Basilica of Superga, Vittorio Amedeo III, King of Sardinia commissioned architect Francesco Martinez, grandson of the original architect Filippo Juvara, to build a burial crypt. In 1778, the burial crypt was consecrated and arrangements began for the reburial of some royal remains that had been interred in other burial sites.\n\nThe Royal Crypt is divided into five rooms, including the Hall of Kings, the Hall of the Queens, and the Hall of Children, where children and princes and princesses who never reigned were interred. While there are some tombs, most burials are in niches along the walls of the rooms as seen in the above photo.\n\nTraditionally, at the death of the sovereign, his remains were placed in the center of the Hall of Kings. Upon the death of the next sovereign, the previous sovereign’s remains were then moved to one of the niches. The last sovereign buried at the Basilica of Superga was Carlo Alberto I, King of Sardinia. He died in 1849 and his tomb remains in the center of the Hall of Kings because his successors became Kings of Italy and were buried elsewhere.\n\nHall of the Kings (First Room)\n\nMaria Antonia
