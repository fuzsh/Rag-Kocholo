Maria Letizia, (1866-1926), was the daughter of Prince Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte, and Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy.

Maria Letizia's father Napoléon Joseph was a nephew of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte through his brother Jérôme Bonaparte, King of Westphalia. This then made Maria Letizia a great-niece of Emperor Napoleon. Her mother Maria Clotilde was a daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. Through this connection, Maria Letizia was a niece of King Umberto I of Italy and Queen Maria Pia of Portugal.

In 1888 she married Prince Amadeo, Duke of Aosta, the former king of Spain, and became the Duchess of Aosta. Maria Letizia was Amadeus' second wife, as his first spouse Maria Vittoria del Pozzo della Cisterna had died in 1876. Due to the large age difference, Maria Letizia was only three years older than Amadeus' eldest child.

The couple lived in Turin and had one son: Prince Umberto, Count of Salemi who was killed during World War One. Prince Amadeo died two years after their marriage in Turin, on 18 January 1890.

During her widowhood, Maria Letizia maintained an open and scandalous relationship with a military man twenty years her junior. Upon her death on 25 October 1926, he was revealed to be the sole heir in her will, as her son died in 1918.
