        "text": "NEWTOWN, CT — Aurora A. Martinez, 82, died on Jan. 11 in Danbury Hospital, where she worked as a registered nurse for 35 years. Her family and friends were with her to say goodbye.\n\nAurora was born in Dilao, Balayan, Batangas, Philippines. She was the 2nd of 9 children of Lolo Yoyo and Lola Chabing. As a child, Aurora’s family had to flee into the jungle to escape capture from the enemy in WWII. Her family was not wealthy but strong in mind and spirit, working the land while still attending school. With limited food, Aurora and her siblings would have to fend off monkeys and share the fruit they farmed with each other so they could all have something to eat. These experiences created strong bonds with her siblings.\n\nAurora graduated from Concordia College in Manila, Philippines with a degree in Nursing and was the first woman to graduate college in her family and the first in her family to immigrate to North America. She passed the licensing exams for both England-Wales and Canada and subsequently moved to Medicine Hat, Canada, to start her nursing career. After a few years, she immigrated to the US, moving to Chicago, Illinois, to continue her nursing career. She lived in Chicago for several years and then in 1979 met Roberto Martinez, got married, and moved to Sandy Hook, and shortly after began work in Danbury Hospital, where she stayed for 35 years. Aurora loved her nursing colleagues, and in her final days, she paid special attention to the nurses in Danbury Hospital that cared for her until the end.\n\nAs a nurse, Aurora was smart, kind, and patient, and at the same time, confident with excellent leadership skills. She was a nurses’ nurse, always putting her patients first. With her family, she was tough and demanding yet loving and nurturing, always working hard to make the lives around her better. Aurora was tireless. She lived for 82 years, but has the life experience of someone much older. When her son started school, she chose to work nights so she could drive him to school. There are countless examples of her putting others before herself, whether it was for work, family, or friends.\n\nAurora will be sorely missed by her family and friends, but those that knew her are grateful for the precious moments that were spent together.\n\nA Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at 10:00 am on Sat., Jan. 20 at St. Rose of Lima Church in Newtown. Friends may call at Honan Funeral Home, 58 Main St., Newtown, Fri., Jan. 19, 2024, from 4:00 to 7:00 pm."
