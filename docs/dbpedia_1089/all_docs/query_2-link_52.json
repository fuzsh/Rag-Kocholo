        "text": "David Sosa Martinez was born March 2, 1958 in San Angelo, Tx. He was preceded in death by his parents Casimiro & Antonia Martinez, siblings Alfredo Lopez, Gilbert Martinez, Lydia Soto, and Frances Pina.\n\nSurvivors include his sons David Martinez Jr (wife Cassandra) of Dayton, Ohio, and Daniel (Vivian) Martinez of Ft Worth, Texas. Brothers Richard (Norma) of Ft. Worth, and Julian (Alice), Jesse (Elizabeth), Eduardo, and Johnny (Sandy) Martinez all of San Angelo. He leaves behind his grandkids April, Angel, Autumn (Jose) Avelar, Donovan and Jasmine Martinez; a great grandchild and numerous nephews, nieces, cousins and his chihuahua babies.\n\nDavid left this earth a hero as an organ donor on January 12, 2021. He loved music, dancing, joking, movies and worked hard every day.\n\nNo matter where he was or what he was doing, he always dropped everything to be there for his sons and loved them unconditionally.\n\nSpecial thanks to all our family and friends, especially Tio Johnny and Prima Reyna for going above and beyond to help through this difficult time.\n\nLove and miss you old man-Junior & Danny Boy.\n\n1 Thessalonians 5:9-11"
