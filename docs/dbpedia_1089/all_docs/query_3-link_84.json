        "text": "Our beloved Yvette Marie Miera, daughter, mother, sister and grandmother, was called home on June 30, 2024. She was born to Andy Miera, Sr., and Linda Gallegos on April 10, 1970. Rest in peace, beautiful. We will never forget you, especially your singing. Double Dutch Bus was your favorite even though you loved all the oldies. We will remember how you loved dancing and just being happy. You loved low riders and going to car shows. You were a great cook. Now you are free, no more pain. You are you again, young and gorgeous. In our hearts forever you will be.\n\nShe leaves behind her parents, daughters Marie, Finese, Leticia and Ariana, her 8 grandchildren, sisters Cheri, Bernadette, Elisha, Maxine and Amanda, brothers Andy, Benny and Jimmy, and many nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles and cousins. She is preceded in death by her stepfather Benny Martinez Sr., her stepmother Dorothy May Miera, and her brothers PJ and John.\n\nA memorial service will be held at the Chateau at Larkin Sunset Gardens, 1910 E. Dimple Dell Road (10600 S.), Sandy, UT 84092, on Friday, August 9, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The service will be livestreamed via Zoom and can be accessed by clicking the \"Watch Services\" button above."
