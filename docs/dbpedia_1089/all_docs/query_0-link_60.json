        "text": "SERIE DEL CARIBE 2019 – Panama City, Panama\n\nPANAMA’ WINS SERIE DEL CARIBE 2019!!\n\nFinal Report – February 15, 2019\n\nPanama’ 3 – Cuba 1\n\nIn an emotional final game on Sunday Feb. 10, before 18,000 (est.) fans in Estadio Rod Carew, the host team won its first Serie del Caribe since 1950. Panama’ broke out on top 2-0 in the bottom of the first and never gave up the lead.\n\nPanama 3B-SS Javy Guerra was named the Series MVP.\n\nREFLECTIONS ON SERIE DEL CARIBE 2019\n\nConsidering the short amount of time (less than two weeks) that the hosts had to prepare for Serie del Caribe, I think everything went off smoothly. Estadio Rod Carew is a great venue to watch baseball. The field itself was in great shape and it was a pleasant experience in the stadium. Sight lines were good. There was enough food, drink and sportswear, although I’m sure there would have been more selection given more time to plan for the event.\n\nThe weather was great for baseball! Temperatures ranged from 75F at night to 90F during the day. With a pleasant prevailing breeze, watching the games at the stadium was very enjoyable.\n\nPanama City is a modern, cosmopolitan city. Banking is a huge industry and there were many large, new banks. Lots of major construction projects in the city and I read of many investment projects being initiated across the country.\n\nThe six-team system of competition worked well – every game was important and there were meaningful games on the last day of group play as well as a great final game. Two highly competitive teams made the finals and the Panama squad ended with a record of 4-1 and were deserving of the championship. Most fans that I spoke with were in favor of keeping the six-team, two-group play, format of competition in the future.\n\nThelma Acosta (to left of flag) and her team from the Travesias Mundiales travel agency in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico did a great job on short notice in switching our group’s travel plans from Venezuela to Panama. Arrangements and reservations went smoothly in Panama City.\n\nFinally, thanks to mi buen amigo Juan Antonio Jasso (in picture with the author above) for his help and friendship. Thanks also to my friends ‘Nacho Romero and Juan Antonio Diaz. These three gentlemen add tremendously to my enjoyment of Serie del Caribe and travel to Latin America.\n\nCurrent plans are for Serie del Caribe to be held in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 2020 and in Mazatlán, Mexico in 2021.\n\nTHANKS FOR READING!\n\nCUBA AND PANAMA’ WILL FACE OFF IN THE FINALS !!\n\nFebruary 9, 2019\n\nBoth games on Saturday were extremely important for the outcome of Serie del Caribe 2019.\n\nGame 11 – Cuba defeated Venezuela 3-0 to win Group A. Cuban starter Lazaro Blanco pitched five innings, working around five hits and three walks to record the win. The bullpen did the rest, shutting out Cardenales de Lara on only three more hits in the remaining four innings.\n\nGame 12 – Panama’ takes Group B with a 1-0 victory over Puerto Rico. The hosts scored an unearned run in the bottom of the fourth and that stood up for the win. Four Panama’ pitchers combined for the shutout, with starter Oriel Caicedo getting the win and Manny Corpus recording the save.\n\nBoth group winners were decided by tie-breaker rules. Cuba prevailed in Group A with a superior Team Quality Balance – TQB – essentially run differential but with consideration for innings actually played on offense and defense. In Group B, Panama’ and Venezuela were both tied at 3-1, were tied on TQB, and were tied on TQB considering only earned runs. The third tie-breaker consideration awarded 1st place in the Group to the hosts.\n\nFebruary 8, 2019\n\nGame 9 – The Dominican team defeated host Panama’ 5-3. Catcher Wilkin Castillo was the hitting star, going 3-for-4 with four RBI. Jumbo Diaz again got the save.\n\nGame 10 – Mexico scored early and often, handing the Venezuela team their first loss 9-4. 1B Victor Mendoza was 4-for-5 and broke the game open with a 3-run homer in the bottom of the sixth.\n\nThrough five days of group play, the standings are —\n\nGroup A – Venezuela 2-1, Mexico 2-2, Cuba 1-2\n\nGroup B – Dominicana 3-1, Panama’ 2-1, Puerto Rico 0-3\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela plays Cuba and Panama’ plays Puerto Rico. These games are both very important and will directly affect which teams win the groups and advance to the finals. Should the W-L be tied, a form of run differential will be used to break the tie. Stay tuned …\n\nFebruary 7, 2019\n\nGame 7 – Mexico gets into the win column with 3-2, 11-inning victory over Cuba. Most of the scoring took place in the first inning, as the Mexican team posted a single run as they led off and Cuba answered with two runs in the bottom of the frame. But that was all Cuba could manage as the Mexican pitching staff shut them out for the remaining 10 innings. Mexico tied the game in the top of the sixth and pushed the winner across in the top of the eleventh.\n\nCF Alonzo Harris was 3-4 with a walk and scored twice as he led off for Mexico. The Cuban runs were driven in by long-time stars Alfredo Despaigne and Freddy Cepeda. Mexico closer Sergio Romo came on in relief in the ninth, pitched 2 2/3 innings, struck out three and picked up the win.\n\nGame 8 – The Dominican team won in walk-off fashion 5-4 over Puerto Rico. The defending champs pounded out 12 hits to take a 4-3 lead into the bottom of the 8th, but the Puerto Rican bullpen issued walks leading to single Dominican tallies in the bottom of the 8th and 9th. Junior Lake drove in the winning run.\n\nThrough four days of group play, the standings are now:\n\nGroup A – Venezuela 2-0; Cuba 1-2; Mexico 1-2\n\nGroup B – Panama’ 2-0; Dominicana 2-1; Puerto Rico 0-3\n\nFebruary 6, 2019\n\nGame 5 – Venezuela prevailed 1-0 over Cuba in a tight pitching duel. The only tally was scored in the bottom of the seventh when 1B Rangel Ravelo reached on an error, advanced to second with a walk to the next batter, was sacrificed to third, and then scored on a sac fly. One unearned run manufactured without a hit!\n\nGame 6 was a wild affair, with the host Panama team coming from behind to defeat defending champs Puerto Rico 8 – 7. Panama slugged out 14 hits but hurt themselves by walking 7 and committing two errors. As a result, Puerto Rico led 6-1 at the end of seven innings. Then the real fun began as the hosts put up 4 in the 8th and 3 in the 9th. SS Javy Guerra again starred for Panama, going 3 for 4 with a key two out, two RBI double in the 8th.\n\nAt the end of the first round of group play, the standings look like this\n\nGROUP A W L Venezuela 2 0 Cuba 1 1 Mexico 0 2\n\nGROUP B W L Panama’ 2 0 Dominicana 1 1 Puerto Rico 0 2\n\nNo team is statistically eliminated, yet, but the Mexican and Puerto Rican clubs would need to win their remaining two games, with a big run differential, and hope for help from Cuba and Dominicana respectively. The second round of group play begins Thursday Feb. 7.\n\nFebruary 5, 2019\n\nGame 3 saw the Mexican squad continue to struggle offensively as Cuba won 3 to 1. Cuban starter Lazaro Blanco pitched seven shutout innings for the win. Long time Cuban star Alfredo Despaigne was 3 for 4 and drove in all three Cuba runs.\n\nWith the new Cuba/MLB agreement, scouts were in attendance to get a first hand look at the Cuban players.\n\nGame 4 was an exciting affair with the Panama squad defeating the Dominicans 4 to 2. This game marked the first time since 1960 that Panama has fielded a team at Serie del Caribe. The results were very positive for the hosts. SS Javy Guerra, who debuted with the Padres last summer, opened the scoring with a solo homer in the bottom of the second. Panama starter Harold Arauz pitched five shutout innings. The Dominicans tied the game in the sixth at 2-2, but Panama came back in the seventh with two runs sparked by aggressive base running. Manny Corpas closed out the ninth for the win.\n\nFebruary 4, 2019\n\nThe 61st edition of the Caribbean Series is underway!\n\nGame 1 saw the Dominican team (Estrellas Orientales) defeat defending champion Puerto Rico 3 to 1. Dominican starter Nestor Cortes and three relievers held the Santurce squad to only one hit! Jumbo Diaz picked up the save. The Dominicans pounded out 12 hits and put up single runs in the 2nd, 5th and 9th innings to pick up the win.\n\nRecent HOF electee Mariano Rivera threw out the ceremonial first pitch in between games. It seemed fitting that this occurred in Rod Carew Stadium, thus tying together the two Panamanian hall-of-famers.\n\nIn Game 2, Venezuela (Cardenales) defeated Mexico (Charros) 5 to 1. Venezuela was scheduled as the “home” team, and it certainly seemed like a home game for them. There were thousands of Venezuelan fans in the ballpark supporting their team. Nestor Molina was the winning pitcher, working five effective innings and allowing only the one unearned run. Cardenales broke the game open with three tallies in the bottom of the sixth, including a two run homer by 3B Carlos Rivero.\n\nI would estimate attendance at the evening game was around 10,000.\n\nStay tuned, as we have 11 more games to play!\n\nFebruary 3, 2019\n\nSingle game tickets went on sale yesterday at local outlets and the stadium ticket office. The Panamanians are making a big push to turn out a large crowd on short notice. Tickets are priced to sell … $5 for the upper seats down the foul lines and $20 for good box seats. These prices are USD (the dollar is legal currency in Panama’) and are good for both games each day.\n\nThere was a protest rally here in response to the Venezuelan opposition leader’s call for support. The U.S. charge’ and Colombian ambassador were both in attendance.\n\nPanama native and recent HOF electee Mariano Rivera will throw out the ceremonial first pitch before the evening game Monday.\n\nFebruary 2, 2019\n\nYour author is on-site in Cd. de Panama’. Our group of fans will be gathering over the weekend and play will begin Monday, Feb. 4. Stay tuned!\n\n###########\n\nThe Caribbean Baseball Confederation announced Monday afternoon, January 28, that the tournament will be moved from Barquisimeto, Venezuela to Estadio Nacional de Panama’ in Panama City. The current Panama’ champs, Toros de Herrera, will join the field of league champions competing at the Series.\n\nEstadio Nacional de Panama’ is also known as Rod Carew Stadium. It seats 27,000 for baseball. Dimensions are 321′ at both foul lines and 400′ in center. The field is natural grass.\n\nAs of Thursday, January 31 it appears that the Venezuelan champions, Cardenales de Lara, will indeed participate. The announced format-of-competition for the resulting six-team tournament is as follows:\n\nThe field will be divided into two groups for group play:\n\nGroup A – Venezuela (Cardenales de Lara), Mexico (Charros de Jalisco) and Cuba (Lenadores de Las Tunas)\n\nGroup B – Panama’ (Toros de Herrera), Dominican Republic (Estrellas Orientales – San Pedro de Macoris), Puerto Rico (Cangrejeros de Santurce)\n\nSchedule – Group play from Feb. 4 to Feb. 9. Each team will have two games against each of the other two teams in its Group – for a total of four games over the six days. The two Group winners will then face off in the Final on Feb. 10 for the Serie del Caribe crown.\n\nThe detailed schedule is as follows:\n\nDATE TIME GAME BYE Mon Feb 4 15:00 R.

Dominicana Sun Feb 10 16:00 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME –\n\nTimes are local time – Panama times are U.S. Eastern Zone in winter\n\nPLAYOFFS UPDATE – January 27-28, 2019\n\nDOMINICANA\n\nEstrellas Orientales (San Pedro) cruised through the best-of-nine LIDOM final series, defeating Toros (La Romana) five games to one. Centerfielder Jose Siri (AA with Cincinnati) was the hitting star of the playoffs, batting .591.\n\nThis is Estrellas’ first LIDOM championship since 1968, and will be the club’s very first visit to la Serie del Caribe. Pictures above show the celebration parade in San Pedro in ’68 and last week. (Photos courtesy of Shawn Flaherty in La Romana)\n\nPUERTO RICO\n\nCangrejeros de Santurce swept Mayaguez in four games to claim the Puerto Rican league crown. The largest crowd of the season, over 7500, saw the locals defeat the regular season champion Indios at Estadio Hiram Bithorn in San Juan. The Crabbers will advance to Serie del Caribe and attempt to win Puerto Rico’s third straight Caribbean corona.\n\nVENEZUELA\n\nCardenales de Lara won the LVBP championship, four games to one, with a 9-2 victory over Caracas. This is the Redbirds’ fifth Venezuelan championship. Shortstop Juniel Querecuto was named finals MVP after hitting .611 in the final series. Querecuto is an Arizona Diamondbacks farmhand, having hit for a combined .337 at AA and AAA this past summer.\n\nIt’s very unfortunate that, due to the political situation in Venezuela, Cardenales will not be hosting Serie del Caribe in their home ball park. They had an outstanding season, finishing second overall in the regular season and cruising through all three playoff rounds.\n\nMEXICO\n\nCharros de Jalisco defeated Yaquis de Obregon 11-1 in Game 6 to take the LMP championship four games to two. Charros’ first baseman Dariel Alvarez was named Final Series MVP. During the six games, the former Orioles farmhand batted .370 with 3 HR and 11 RBI.\n\nCUBA – the Las Tunas roster will be heavily re-inforced at Serie del Caribe. Fourteen of the 28 players will be refuerzos selected from the other Serie Nacional 58 clubs.\n\nIn the photo above (also courtesy of Shawn Flaherty), Cuban fans have some fun with a Spanglish banner.\n\nPLAYOFFS UPDATE – January 16 – 20, 2019\n\nOne league winner has been determined, with the other four final series are either in-progress or about to begin. Here’s the latest:\n\nVENEZUELA\n\nLeones de Caracas closed out their semi-final series four games to one against Caribes. Cardenales de Lara also advanced to the LVBP finals by defeating Magallanes four games to two.\n\n16,874 fanaticos saw their Cardenales clinch the final berth at home in Barquisimeto. Their ball park is Estadio Antonio Herrera Gutierrez, the host site for next month’s Serie del Caribe 2019.\n\nMEXICO\n\nCharros de Jalisco took their semi-final series from Mazatlan four games to one. Yaquis de Obregon played at Los Mochis in a decisive game seven of their semi-final series. Yaquis prevailed 6-2, taking advantage of three Caneros errors to advance to the finals.\n\nThe LMP finals will open Monday, January 21 with Charros hosting Yaquis at Estadio de Beisbol Charros de Jalisco in Zapopan (Guadalajara).\n\nCharros’ shortstop Manny Rodriguez was named LMP MVP. He led the league with 52 RBI, while hitting .313 with 13 HR and 41 runs scored. This is Rodriguez’ second consecutive MVP honor and third in his career. He trails only the great Hector Espino, who had six MVP honors.\n\nPUERTO RICO\n\nEleven games into the semi-final todos-contra-todos series, the two finalists have been determined. Indios de Mayaguez clinched the first pass to the final series several games ago. And, with Carolina’s loss Friday night, Santurce also advanced to the final series.\n\nThe round-robin standings as of close of play on January 18 are:\n\nTeam Wins Losses Advance? Mayagüez 8 3 Yes Santurce 5 5 Yes Carolina 3 8 Eliminated\n\nThe final series will commence Tuesday, January 22 at Estadio Isidoro “Cholo” Garcia in Mayagüez. This will be the fifth consecutive appearance in the finals for Cangrejeros de Santurce.\n\nCUBA\n\nLas Tunas wins its first-ever Cuban title! The Lumberjacks took the final series four games to one, clinching the Serie Nacional 58 title and a trip to Serie del Caribe.\n\nThe team played well all season, finishing the first-half only one game out of first place, winning the second half by two games, and dominating their semi-final and final series. Their next game will be Saturday, February 2 in Barquisimeto and will be the opening game of Serie del Caribe 2019.\n\nDOMINICANA – after the 18-game semi-final round-robin, the final field was still not decided:\n\nTeam Wins Losses Advance? Estrellas 11 7 Yes Escogido 10 8 Tied for 2nd Toros 10 8 Tied for 2nd Licey 5 13 Eliminated\n\nThe second-place tie between Escogido (Santo Domingo) and Toros (La Romana) had to be resolved with a one-game tie breaker played at Estadio Quisqueya Juan Marichal on Wednesday evening January 15.\n\nToros won that game 4-3 behind eight solid innings by their veteran pitcher Raul Valdes and a 2-RBI triple by DH Jordany Valdespin.\n\nConsequently, the best-of-nine final series will be an “All Eastern” affair matching Estrellas Orientales (San Pedro) and Toros del Este.\n\nThe LiDOM finals will begin Thursday January 17, with Estrellas hosting Toros at Estadio Tetelo Vargas in San Pedro de Macoris.\n\nEarly results – as of January 19 action in the LIDOM finals, Estrellas lead Toros two games to one.\n\nPLAYOFFS UPDATE – January 11, 2019\n\nCUBA\n\nSerie Nacional 58 is the first league to move on to their final series.

The deciding game six went to Jalisco, 1-0, even though they tallied only one hit! But that hit was an RBI double by catcher Gabriel Gutierrez in the top of the ninth to drive in the deciding run.\n\nMazatlán won the seventh and deciding game of their series with Obregon, 3-2. Obregon also advances to the semi-finals as the wild card. In the LMP system of competition, el mejor perdedor (the best loser) advances as the fourth team to the semi-final round. Yaquis de Obregon won three games in their losing effort, so therefore they qualified for the semi-finals.\n\nThe semi-final play begins Friday January 11 with Jalisco at Mazatlan and Obregon at Los Mochis.\n\nNaranjeros shortstop Jasson Atondo was named LMP Rookie of the Year and was the first selection (by Mazatlán) in the draft of refuerzos for the semi-final round.\n\nJalisco pitcher Elian Leyva was named LMP Pitcher of the Year.\n\nDOMINICANA – the todos-contra-todos semi-final round continues to be a tight three-way race. Toros won a key game last night against Escogido at Estadio Quisqueya Juan Marichal. 41-year-old veteran Cuban pitcher Raul Valdes hurled 7.2 innings, allowing no earned runs, in the Toros 7-2 victory.

The agreement is similar to those between MLB and the top leagues in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. MLB’s announcement is here.\n\nThe Second Half of the Serie Nacional 58 season came down to a photo-finish on Christmas Day. Of the six teams participating in the second half, there was a possibility of a four-way tie for second place. Industriales had to play a make-up game against Sancti Spiritus on Dec. 25, and had the Havana club won the game, four teams would have been tied at 31-29. However, the Blue Lions lost that key game and were eliminated from further play. Holguin also was eliminated. The final standings were:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Las Tunas 34 26 — Sancti Spiritus 32 28 2 Villa Clara 31 29 3 Ciego de Avila 31 29 3 Industriales (eliminated) 30 30 4 Holguin (eliminated) 22 38 12\n\nThe SN58 best-of-seven semi-finals will open January 4. Las Tunas will have home-field advantage vs. Ciego de Avila; Sancti Spiritus will have home-field nod over Villa Clara.\n\nMEXICO – the Liga Mexicana del Pacifico completed its second half season on Sunday, December 30. Second-half standings were:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Los Mochis 21 12 — Cd. de Obregon 19 12 1 Hermosillo 19 14 2 Jalisco 17 15 3.5 Culiacan 17 16 4 Mazatlán 16 17 5 Navajoa 12 21 9 Mexicali 9 23 11.5\n\nThe LMP teams earn points for their position finish for the first- and second-half seasons. Points are awarded as follows: 8 points for first place, 7 for second, 6 for third, 5 for fourth, 4.5 for fifth, 4 for sixth, 3.5 for seventh, and 3 points for finishing last. The points are added together to determine the teams that qualify (the top six) and to seed the playoff series. The final points totals are as follows:\n\nTeam 1st half points 2nd half points total Culiacan 8 4.5 12.5 Cd. de Obregon 5 7 12 Hermosillo 6 6 12 Los Mochis 3 8 11 Mazatlán 7 4 11 Jalisco 3.5 5 8.5 Navajoa (eliminated) 4 3.5 7.5 Mexicali (eliminated) 4.5 3 7.5\n\nFirst-round playoff games will commence January 1 with Tomateros de Culiacan hosting Charros de Jalisco; Yaquis de Obregon hosting Venados de Mazatlán; and Naranjeros de Hermosillo hosting Caneros de Los Mochis.\n\nCharros de Jalisco pitcher Elian Leyva won a rare “pitching triple crown” this season in the LMP. The Cuban native led the league in wins (6), ERA (2.02) and strikeouts (67). This past summer he pitched 87 innings with a 2.69 ERA across AA and AAA stints in the Atlanta Braves system.\n\nVENEZUELA – the final league standings are as follows:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Magallanes 36 27 — Lara 35 28 1 Caracas 34 29 2 Aragua 33 30 3 Margarita 32 31 4 Anzoátegui 31 32 5 La Guairá (eliminated) 28 33 7 Zulia (eliminated) 21 40 14\n\nThe top six teams advance to the first-round playoff series beginning January 3. The pairings are: Magallanes vs. Anzoátegui; Lara vs. Margarita; and Caracas vs. Aragua.\n\nVeteran major-leaguer Delmon Young led the league in numerous batting categories.

(Gracias to colleague Angel Colon for the action photos).\n\nStay tuned – the various league playoffs will take up the month of January and I will post updates as the clubs advance towards their league championships and Serie del Caribe 2019.\n\nThanks!! for reading.\n\nUPDATE – December 15, 2018\n\nThere are about two weeks left to play in the rol regular of the Latin American Winter Leagues. Here’s the latest:\n\nDOMINICANA – current standings are:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Estrellas 28 20 — Licey 26 22 2 Escogido 25 23 3 Toros 24 24 4 Aguilas 21 27 7 Gigantes 20 28 8\n\nThe top four teams will advance to a todos-contra-todos (round robin) “semi final” phase in January.\n\nEstrellas’ and former major leaguer Junior Lake leads all hitter with 24 RBI and is tied for the HR lead with 4.\n\nEscogido’s Josh Lowey leads all pitchers with six wins, plus has a nice 2.29 ERA.\n\nPUERTO RICO – through the first month of play, the standings are:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Mayaguez 17 8 — Carolina 13 12 4 Santurce 11 13 5.5 Caguas 8 16 8.5\n\nThe top three teams advance to post-season play in January. The second- and third-place teams will play a short “wild-card” series, with the winner advancing to play the first-place finisher for the league title. Criollos de Caguas are defending two-time champs of both the Clemente League as well as Serie del Caribe; but they will have to rally to defend their titles.\n\nMuchas gracias a mis amigos and fellow SABR colleagues Angel Colón and Jorge Fidel López for the following action photos from Puerto Rico:\n\nYadiel Rivera (Mayaguez) and Heliot Ramos (Santurce).\n\nWillie Abreu (Caguas) and Jumpei Takahashi (Carolina).\n\nIndios’ Kennys Vargas (Twins and AAA Rochester) leads all hitters with a .403 average and 4 HR.\n\nVENEZUELA – the current standings are:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Lara 30 21 — Magallanes 29 23 1.5 Margarita 28 25 3 Caracas 27 25 3.5 Aragua 23 24 5 LaGuaira 24 26 5.5 Caribes 21 29 8.5 Zulia 20 29 9\n\nThe top six teams will advance to “quarter-final” play in January.\n\nPlay in the LVBP was cancelled for games scheduled Saturday, December 8 in memory of players José Castillo and Luis Valbuena. The Cardenales de Lara teammates were killed in a car crash the previous day. Both were accomplished major leaguers who were also stalwarts in the Venezuelan winter league.\n\nCUBA – with one week remaining, here are the Serie Nacional 58 standings:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Las Tunas 33 21 — Villa Clara 29 25 4 Sancti Spiritus 27 26 5.5 Ciego de Avila 27 27 6 Industriales 25 28 7.5 Holguin 20 34 13\n\nThe top four teams will advance to the semi-finals. Las Tunas is “in” and Holguin is “out”, but the three remaining playoff spots are TBD. Industriales has won three straight to pull back into contention.\n\nMEXICO – second-half standings are as follows:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Hermosillo 13 7 — Cd. de Obregon 12 7 0.5 Jalisco 12 8 1 Culiacan 11 9 2 Los Mochis 10 10 3 Mazatlán 8 12 5 Navajoa 7 13 6 Mexicali 6 13 6.5\n\nEach club will earn an appropriate number of “points” based upon their second-half finish. When added to the team’s first-half points, the sum will determine the top six teams that will advance to the January playoffs.\n\nHermosillo’s Jasson Atondo leads all hitters with a .376 average.\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTE:\n\nI visited my good friend and béisbol amigo Ing. Juan Antonio Jasso in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico for a long weekend earlier in December. I was a guest in his home, as well as on his weekly radio show – Peña Beisbolera on Radio Naranjeros. Juan treated me to two Naranjeros games at Estadio Sonora. I was also a guest at un gran carne asada at the home of his colleague Francisco Salazar. Some pictures follow:\n\nGroup picture at Estadio Sonora. I am back row, second from right (wearing Cardenales de Lara jersey). My good friend Juan Antonio is front row, center. The main guest is Naranjeros player Norberto Obeso (front row, second from right). Obeso is signed with the Toronto Blue Jays and played in the Class A Midwest League in 2018.\n\nAt the carne asada – our host “Paco” Salazar and his wife are on the far left. My other buen béisbol amigo – ‘Nacho Romero – is second from right (in blue shirt to my left).\n\nI also got to spend time with my travel agent and friend Thelma Acosta (second from left, to my right), owner of Travesias Mundiales. Thelma organizes our annual group adventures to La Serie del Caribe. With her help, I have secured my Venezuelan tourist visa and we are ready to travel to Barquisimeto, Venezuela in February for Serie del Caribe 2019.\n\nMUCHÍSIMAS GRACIAS for a great baseball trip to my good friend Juan Antonio, and especially to his fabulosa esposa Carmen. Thanks also to Thelma Acosta and her team at Travesias Mundiales, my good friend Nacho Romero, and my new friends Paco, Oscar, Jesus Alberto, Julio (Manny), Sammy, Juan Carlos, and mi amiguito Pepetián. ¡GRACIAS POR TODO!\n\nUPDATE – November 23, 2018\n\nPUERTO RICO\n\nPlay began in La Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente on November 15. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the Puerto Rican winter league. The 2018-19 season is being dedicated to Alex Cora, manager of the 2018 World Series champion Red Sox and long-time stalwart of the Criollos de Caguas franchise.\n\nAfter a week of play, Indios de Mayagüez have the early lead at 4-2. Defending LBPRC and Serie del Caribe champs Criollos are at 3-3. Santurce is also at 3-3 and Carolina is at 2-4. Due to ongoing repairs/upgrades at their primary fields, Criollos are playing home games at Estadio Evaristo Roldan in Gurabo and Gigantes de Carolina are playing at Estadio Hiram Bithorn in San Juan.\n\nMEXICO – the first half of the LMP season ended on November 21, with the standings and points earned as follows:\n\nAt the midway-point, Naranjeros de Hermosillo shortstop Jasson Atondo leads the league in hitting at .392.\n\nDOMINICANA – through the games played on Nov. 22, only two games separate the entire field in the LiDOM:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Estrellas 17 14 — Escogido 16 15 1 Aguilas 15 16 2 Gigantes 15 16 2 Licey 15 16 2 Toros 15 16 2\n\nHanser Alberto leads the league in hitting at .349. Alberto split his 2018 summer season between AAA Round Rock (Texas) and the Texas Rangers.\n\nVENEZUELA – the current league standings are:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Lara 23 13 — Magallanes 20 15 2.5 Margarita 18 18 5 Caracas 17 17 5 Aragua 15 17 6 Zulia 15 19 7 LaGuaira 15 19 7 Caribes 15 20 7.5\n\nMLB veteran Alejandro de Aza, playing with Cardenales de Lara, is leading the LVBP in hitting at .384 and also leads the circuit in runs scored with 27.\n\nCUBA\n\nAs mentioned earlier, an important change in the system of competition was made for the Serie Nacional 58 season. In the recent past, the six teams that advanced to the second-half competition brought their entire first-half W/L record (45 games) forward to second-half play. This year, the advancing teams only bring forward their W/L record against the other five advancing teams (15 games). Consequently, second-half play began with the following standings carried forward:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Las Tunas 10 5 — Villa Clara 9 6 1 Ciego de Avila 8 7 2 Sancti Spiritus 7 8 3 Industriales 7 8 3 Holguin 4 11 6\n\nThe new system of competition had a big negative effect for Holguin. They finished the first half in second place (28-17), but against the other qualifying clubs they began the second half in last place (4-11).\n\nThrough second-half play on Nov. 22, the SN58 standings are:\n\nTeam Wins Losses GB Las Tunas 23 13 — Sancti Spiritus 22 14 1 Ciego de Avila 19 17 4 Villa Clara 18 18 5 Industriales 16 20 7 Holguin 10 26 13\n\nStay tuned – there’s a lot more béisbol to be played leading up to Serie del Caribe 2019 !\n\nUPDATE – October 23, 2018\n\nWinter league action is now underway in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela. Serie Nacional 58 has reached the half-way mark in Cuba. Play will begin in Puerto Rico in three weeks. Here’s a current summary:\n\nCUBA\n\nMany of us were both shocked and saddened to hear of the sudden death of SABR colleague Peter Bjarkman. The noted baseball author died of a heart attack at the Havana airport on October 1. A brief memorial article from the SABR site is here.\n\nDescansa en paz, Pedro.\n\nSerie Nacional 58 reached the end of the first phase (45 games) with the standings at:\n\nTeam Wins Losses Advance? Ciego de Avila 28 17 Y Holguin 28 17 Y Villa Clara 27 18 Y Las Tunas 27 18 Y Industriales 29 19 WC Santiago 25 20 WC Sancti Spiritus 24 21 WC Mayabeque 24 21 WC Isla de Juventud 23 22 N Pinar del Rio 21 24 N Artemisa 20 23 N Camaguey 19 26 N Granma 18 25 N Guantanamo 17 28 N Cienfuegos 16 28 N Matanzas 14 30 N\n\nThe top four teams now advance to second round play. The next four clubs in the standings entered a best-of-three wild card series to determine the additional two clubs to advance. Industriales defeated Mayabeque and Sancti Spiritus defeated Santiago to complete the second-half field of six teams. The second phase of SN58 – another 45 games – begins on October 26.\n\nDOMINICANA – the 2018-19 winter season is being dedicated to recent HOF inductee Vladimir Guerrero. Their season is now about 10 days old, and Gigantes del Cibao (San Francisco de Macoris) has an early lead with a record of 6-2.\n\nPUERTO RICO – the 2018-19 winter season will mark the league’s 80th anniversary. On November 15 four teams will take the field – Caguas, Mayaguez, Santurce, and Carolina. Criollos de Caguas are two time defending champs in Puerto Rico, and of Serie del Caribe.\n\nMEXICO – after eight games, Mazatlán, Culiacan, and Jalisco are all tied atop the league standings at 5-3.\n\nVENEZUELA – Navigantes de Magallanes are on top of the standings at 5-2 in the early going.\n\nNOTES FROM YOUR AUTHOR – I made a “quick trip” to Venezuela on October 17 – in a manner of speaking. I went to the Venezuelan consulate in Houston to apply for my tourist visa in order to attend Serie del Caribe 2019 in Barquisimeto. All of my paperwork was in order, so I’m expecting my visa in a few weeks.\n\nI always enjoy hearing from fellow members of the SABR Latino Committee. Muchisimas gracias for your many kind emails. I wanted to especially thank colleague Jane Hewitt – proprietor of Baseball Goes Global – for sending me one of her firm’s shirts:\n\nBaseball Goes Global is on the ‘net at: baseballgoesglobal.shop\n\nStay tuned!! There’s a lot more baseball to be played south of the border.\n\nUPDATE – September 9, 2018\n\nWinter league action is underway in Cuba and training camps will begin in another week in most of the other winter leagues. Here’s the latest:\n\nCUBA – Serie Nacional 58 play has been underway for about a month, and la primera etapa – the first 45 games of the season with all 16 clubs participating – is about at the half-way point. Here are the current standings:\n\nTEAM W L GB Villa Clara 14 7 — Ciego de Avila 15 8 — Industriales 13 8 1 Artemisa 14 9 1 Santiago 13 9 1.5 Las Tunas 14 10 1.5 Holguin 12 9 2 Guantanamo 12 11 3 Sancti Spiritus 12 11 3 Isla de Juventud 11 11 3.5 Camaguey 9 12 5 Cienfuegos 9 13 5.5 Mayabeque 9 13 5.5 Granma 9 14 6 Pinar del Rio 6 15 8 Matanzas 5 17 9.5\n\nMEXICO – representatives from Guasave, Sinaloa met with LMP officials in Guadalajara to discuss the possibility of the city being granted an LMP franchise. This would have to be tied to the LMP expanding to 10 teams. Other contenders for winter league franchises include Tijuana, Durango, Tepic, and (per rumor) Tucson.\n\nOn September 5, the LMP issued a press release stating they had been informed by the Mexican Summer League (LMB) that the LMB is planning to extend their 2019 season into November. This will cause another escalation in tensions between the two Mexican leagues, as many Mexican nationals will then be unavailable for the first month or so of the winter league schedule. The press release stated that LMP is focused on launching its 2018-19 season, and then will have to deal with the LMB changes.\n\nPUERTO RICO – at the Caribbean Confederation conference held in Miami in late August, Puerto Rican officials announced a new economic plan for their winter league. The plan seeks to improve the strength of the league by entering into a league-wide marketing/merchandising agreement, revamping financial rules governing team support, payroll and operating caps, and improving broadcasts. The league also announced their intention to return to a six-franchise setup over the next few years.\n\nRoster size will be expanded to 30 active players for 2018-19, with a minimum requirement of 22 native Puerto Rican players.\n\nCARIBBEAN CONFEDERATION – at their first major meeting of the season, held August 28-30 in Miami, the winter leagues’ ruling body announced that Panama, Nicaragua, and Colombia are joining the Confederation. Panama was one of the founding leagues, participating in Serie del Caribe from 1949-1960. The three new countries’ leagues will participate in Serie del Caribe 2020 to be held in Puerto Rico. The format of competition has yet to be decided, but speculation is that the three new countries will play against each other in a preliminary tournament, with the winner advancing to Serie del Caribe 2020 as a sixth contestant.\n\nConfederation officials also hinted that future Series del Caribe will not necessarily be hosted in a participating league city; and that the traditional early February dates for Serie del Caribe may have to be adjusted.\n\nStay tuned …\n\n************************************\n\nHere are a few items of interest during the Winter Leagues’ “off season” —\n\nCUBA – Serie Nacional 58 will begin play on August 9. The first half of the season – during which all 16 teams participate – will run through Oct. 7 and wild-card play-in games will complete by Oct. 18. This will narrow the field to six teams for second-half play, which will commence October 25. The second half is scheduled to complete Dec. 22 – with the top four teams then advancing to the league championship playoffs in January. The playoffs are due to finish no later than January 28.\n\nA change is being made to the system-of-competition for SN58. In the immediate past, the first-half won-loss record for the six advancing teams was carried forward – in total – to the second-half standings. For the upcoming season, only the won-loss records among the six advancing teams will be carried forward. So – for example – if Industriales (Havana) was 30-15 in the first half, and 10-5 against the other five clubs advancing to the second half, only the 10-5 record would be carried forward to the second half standings. It will be interesting to see what effect this will have on the final standings.\n\nMEXICO – in March the Liga Mexicana del Pacifico (LMP) announced that its league offices would move from Hermosillo, Sonora to Guadalajara, Jalisco. The main reason given was so that the league HQ would be in a larger media center.\n\nIn April some key operational announcements were made. The LMP schedule will open October 12. League playoffs will be held throughout the month of January, 2019 and will end no later than Jan. 29. Also, roster rules were changed in order to deal with the expanded Mexican Summer League (LMB) schedule that will run into the Fall beginning this year. LMP active rosters were expanded to 30 players. For the first-half season, up to 12 extranjeros (foreign-born players) can be on the roster. In the second-half, that number is reduced to eight. Expect to see more U.S. minor league players in LMP, both from affiliated and independent leagues.\n\nMazatlán team officials announced a major remodeling of Estadio Teodoro Mariscal. Mazatlán will be the site for Serie del Caribe 2021.\n\nDOMINICANA – a major remodeling of the press and media transmission facilities was announced for Estadio Quisqueya Juan Marichal in Santo Domingo. The new area will be named Séptimo Cielo – Seventh Heaven.\n\nThe Dominican winter league (LiDOM) schedule will open Saturday, October 13 with a full slate featuring all six clubs.\n\nPUERTO RICO – league president Héctor Rivera Cruz announced he was stepping down after seven years at the helm. Sr. Cruz led the league through extremely challenging times, and was rewarded with seeing Caguas win both of the last two Series del Caribe. Tony Flores was announced as the new president of the Liga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente (LBPRC).\n\nPuerto Rican success continues in international play, with their club winning the baseball championship of the Central American & Caribbean Games, held in Barranquilla, Colombia.\n\nThe LBPRC schedule will get underway on November 15 with a 36-game slate.\n\nVENEZUELA – the LVBP will open play on October 12 will all eight clubs in action.\n\nFebruary 9-11\n\nPUERTO RICO WINS SERIE DEL CARIBE 2018\n\nA crowd of 15,551 sat through a half-hour rain delay at the start of the game, but were then treated to an exciting and emotional finale on Thursday night.\n\nCriollos de Caguas staged another dramatic comeback and successfully defended their Serie del Caribe crown. Too many walks and a few Puerto Rico errors allowed the Dominican nine to post an early 3-0 lead. Forty-year-old Dominican starter Raul Valdez pitched well through six innings. However he was lifted with one out in the bottom of the seventh as Puerto Rico put their first two batters on base. Ruben Gotay then slammed a two-RBI double and later in the inning catcher Jonathan Morales hit a three run homer to put Criollos up 6-4. The Puerto Ricans added three more in the 8th and shut down the Dominican offense to take the game, series, and become bicampeones (two consecutive Series titles).\n\nFinal score — Puerto Rico 9 – Dominicana 4\n\nPuerto Rican OF/DH Anthony Garcia was named Serie del Caribe 2018 MVP.\n\nSome observations and more news:\n\nThe competition was balanced and most games were hotly contested. The Mexican squad was eliminated from semifinal play, and my amigos were critical of the manager’s moves as well as the quality of play on the field. Excepting the Mexican team, the overall record of the four semi-finalists I think displayed this balance:\n\nPuerto Rico 4 wins – 2 losses\n\nCuba 3 wins – 2 losses\n\nDominicana 3 wins – 3 losses\n\nVenezuela 2 wins – 3 losses\n\nThe sale of two tickets per day, rather than a double-header format, made for an extremely long day. We generally left for the ballpark at 1pm and did not return to the hotel until 1am.\n\nThe locations for upcoming Series del Caribe was announced as: 2019 – Barquisimeto, Venezuela; 2020 – Puerto Rico; 2021 – Mexico (probably Mazatlán). There was lots of discussion regarding the possibility of returning to Mexico again next year should Venezuela not prove feasible. There was also discussion about Cuba hosting a future Serie del Caribe. In an interview, the head of the governing body – the Caribbean Confederation – indicated his desire to return to Havana as it was the site of the initial Serie del Caribe in 1949. However, he indicated it would be dependent on political issues being solved, such as lifting of the U.S. embargo.\n\nAs always, a big part of Serie del Caribe for this author is renewing friendships with my friends south-of-the-border as well as with SABR colleagues. My thanks to amigos Ignacio Romero and Juan Antonio Diaz for their friendship and help. Likewise, many thanks to travel empresaria Thelma Acosta for making my arrangements. I got to spend time with SABR member and well-known Mexican broadcaster and sportswriter Eddie Almada. Good friends Lewis Rubman and his wife Gail were at the games (see picture below), with Lewis reporting for a Bay Area sports service.\n\nFinally – as always – Saludos a mi buen amigo Juan Antonio Jasso who was not able to attend this year. We have been good friends for over seven years and I hope to see him again soon.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nFebruary 8\n\nPUERTO RICO WILL DEFEND SERIE DEL CARIBE CROWN VS. DOMINICANA\n\nPuerto Rico 6 – Venezuela 5\n\nCriollos de Caguas staged a dramatic comeback to defeat Caribes and advance to the Serie del Caribe 2018 final game. Venezuela starter Daryl Thompson was cruising into the 6th inning with a 2-hitter in hand and his club leading 4-0. But then two singles and a walk loaded the bases. Thompson was relieved by Nestor Molina, who then faced Puerto Rican slugger Anthony Garcia. Garcia promptly hit a blast over the wall for a game tying grand slam. Venezuela took the lead again in the bottom of the seventh, only to be overcome by a 2-run Puerto Rican 8th inning. The defending champs held on for an emotional 6-5 victory and a boleto to the finals.\n\nDominicana 7 – Cuba 4\n\nCuba took an early 3-0 lead as Freddy Cepeda drove in the first run with a 2nd inning triple, and then scored on a Dominican throwing error. The Dominicans put up two runs in the top of the 6th on a homer by Ronny Rodriguez. A succession of Cuban relievers could not shut the door as Aguilas Cibaenas scored three more in the 7th and two more in the 8th. Despite committing four errors, and a Freddy Cepeda solo homer in the 8th, the Dominicans prevailed and advance to the finals on Thursday night.\n\nGame attendance was announced as 14,050 – a great turnout considering the Mexican home team has been eliminated.\n\nThe Serie del Caribe final will be Thursday night, February 8, at 8pm (U.S. central time). Stay tuned …\n\nFebruary 7\n\nThe final standings of the round robin phase of Serie del Caribe are —\n\nCuba 3-1\n\nVenezuela 2-2\n\nPuerto Rico 2-2\n\nDominicana 2-2\n\nMexico 1-3\n\nThe semi-final games today are —\n\nPuerto Rico vs. Venezuela 2pm\n\nDominicana vs. Cuba 8pm (games are central time)\n\nFebruary 6\n\nThe day opened with the annual induction of new members to the Serie del Caribe Hall of Fame. Darryl Brinkley, Jaime Orozco and Cornelio Garcia were inducted into the Salon de Fama.\n\nQuick game results are —\n\nCuba 6 – Puerto Rico 3\n\nThis ensures that Cuba wins the round robin phase of the tournament.\n\nMexico 8 – Dominicana 1\n\nMexico avoided being swept at home, but still will not advance to the semifinals.\n\nPrior to the second game, the three new Hall-of-Famers threw out a first pitch. They were joined by Yasiel Puig of the Dodgers.\n\nFebruary 5\n\n“Jose Cuervo, he was a friend of mine …” and even more so as our group took a trip out to Tequila, Jalisco and toured the Jose Cuervo plant.\n\nGame results are —\n\nPuerto Rico 12 – Venezuela 7\n\nDominicana 7 – Cuba 1\n\nThe Dominican victory ensures that Mexico will not qualify for the semi-finals even if they win their last game.\n\nFebruary 4\n\nDominicana 6 – Puerto Rico 3\n\nWhat a difference a day makes for the Dominicans. They put up five runs through the second inning and held on to beat the defending champs. Lots of singles in this game as there was a total of 26 hits between the two teams.\n\nVenezuela 6 – Mexico 4\n\nSolo homers by Rafael Ortega and Williams Astudil contributed to a 6-2 Venezuela lead going into the bottom of the ninth. Long time LMP and LMB star Chris Roberson entered the game to pinch hit for Mexico in the bottom of the ninth and blasted a two run homer to narrow the Venezuelan lead, but los Caribes held on for the win. The host team is now 0-3 and facing elimination.\n\nObservations on Estadio Panamericano – also known as Estadio Charros de Jalisco, this stadium was built in 2011 to host the Pan American Games. In 2014 the LMP franchise from Guasave moved to Guadalajara and play here. The stadium originally seated 8,000 but was upgraded to 11,500 to host baseball. It has since been expanded to 13,000. The outfield dimensions are 330 ft. down both lines and 415 ft. to center. It has a reputation as a hitters ballpark and we have seen numerous homers down the lines and to the alleys. It has artificial turf and that has been a factor as some batted balls take very high bounces, as well as the infield playing fast.\n\nFebruary 3\n\nVenezuela 15 – Dominicana 4\n\nLos Caribes de Anzoategui tallied 20 hits to even their record at 1-1. Venezuelan slugger Balbino Fuenmayor blasted two homers and a double to tally five RBI. The Dominicans committed two key errors to contribute to the beating.\n\nCuba 5 – Mexico 4\n\nAlazanes de Granma again played error-free ball and scored two in the seventh and one in the eighth to post a come-from-behind win. Cuba is now 2-0 and Mexico 0-2 through two days of play. The big home crowd was not happy with the results so far.\n\nFebruary 2\n\nLet the games begin! Here are the opening day results:\n\nCuba 6 – Venezuela 4\n\nThe Cuban team played error-free ball and escaped a ninth inning jam to take Game One. Venezuela had the bases loaded with DH Balbino Fuenmayor at the plate but los cubanos escaped to take the opener.\n\nOpening Ceremonies – this was a pleasant spectacle of fireworks, dancing, singing and the playing of all the clubs´ national anthems. An unexpected highlight (at least to the Americans at the game) was an appearance by former president Bill Clinton. He gave a brief, friendly welcoming speech. In a nice touch, he spent a considerable amount of time at the Puerto Rican dugout shaking hands and inquiring about players´ families.\n\nPuerto Rico 7 – Mexico 4\n\nIn a repeat of last year`s final, the Puerto Rican team mounted a 15-hit attack to open the defense of their Caribbean Series title. A highlight of the game was an attempted straight steal of home in the top of the third inning. The Puerto Rican runner was called out at the plate, the play was appealed, and the call was upheld to the (temporary) delight of the big Mexican crowd.\n\nFebruary 1 – reporting en vivo desde Guadalajara.\n\nFinally the field is set for Serie del Caribe 2018. Last night in Santo Domingo, Aguilas de Cibaeñas defeated Tigres del Licey 11-5. This was the 21st LiDOM title for Aguilas (Licey leads with 22). Fortunately for the winners, they have a bye on Day 1 (tomorrow) of Serie del Caribe.\n\nTo recap, the contestants for Serie del Caribe 2018 are:\n\nMEXICO (hosting) – Tomateros de Culiacan\n\nCUBA – Alazanes de Granma\n\nDOMINICANA – Aguilas de Cibaeñas\n\nPUERTO RICO – Criollos de Caguas (defending champs)\n\nVENEZUELA – Caribes de Anzoategui\n\nI feel that this is a very balanced group of teams and should result in a great series. Vamos a ver … stay tuned.\n\nJanuary 30 – there will be a decisive Game Seven in the Dominican winter league finals! In the doubleheader played today at Estadio Cibao, Aguilas and Licey split – with the home team taking the opener 5-2 and los Tigres winning the nightcap 4-3. Game 7 will be played at Estadio Quisqueya Juan Marichal in Santo Domingo on Wednesday evening.\n\nJanuary 29 – in the remaining final series in the Dominican Republic, Licey bested Aguilas 10-1 in a Game Four marred by five ejections. The two clubs are even at 2-2 in the best-of-seven series and play returns to Estadio Cibao Tuesday for a double-header. Stay tuned …\n\nJanuary 28 – we have two more league winners and another rain-out in Dominicana:\n\nMEXICO\n\nTomateros de Culiacán tied the game with a run in the top of the ninth and scored the decisive runs in the 12th inning to defeat host Mayos de Navajoa 6-4 in an exciting Game Seven of the LMP Finals. They will make the short trip to Jalisco state to represent the hosts in Serie del Caribe 2018.\n\nCUBA\n\nAlazanes de Granma are bicampeones after defeating Las Tunas 3-2 in Game Seven before more than 20,000 disappointed Leñadores fans. Granma successfully defended their Serie Nacional title and will represent the Pearl of the Antilles in Serie del Caribe 2018.\n\nDOMINICANA – ¡ Más lluvia !

Here’s the latest:\n\nMEXICO – in the semi-finals of the LMP, Tomateros de Culiacan swept Mexicali four games to none and Mayos de Navajoa defeated Charros de Jalisco 4-2.

The defending champs were underdogs vs. Matanzas, but they prevailed four games to one.\n\nIn the other semi-final series, Las Tunas and Industriales went to a decisive seventh game with Las Tunas winning 10-0.

Escogido and Águilas Cibaenas will play a one-game tie-breaker at Estadio Cibao Sunday to decide who will join Licey in the finals.\n\nPUERTO RICO – the 18-game hurricane shortened season continues on the Enchanted Island with the current standings at:\n\nTeam W L GB Caguas 10 5 — Santurce 8 7 2 Mayaguez 7 8 3 Carolina 5 10 5\n\nAt this point, Caguas is assured of advancing to at least the “wild card” (2nd vs. 3rd place) game. Everything else depends on the remaining three games.\n\nDecember 30 – “regular season” play in the Winter Leagues has wrapped up and the winter “post-season” is getting underway (Puerto Rico is an exception – see below). Here’s the status of the various leagues, and which clubs are still playing in January:\n\nDOMINICANA – the final standings for the rol regular , the regular season which completed play on December 21, were:\n\nTeam W L GB Qual? Gigantes 29 21 — Y Aguilas 27 23 2 Y Escogido 27 23 2 Y Licey 25 25 4 Y Estrellas 23 27 6 N Toros 19 31 10 N\n\nThe top four clubs advance to an 18-game round-robin “semifinals” which will complete on Jan. 18. The top two teams from the round-robin phase will then play for the league championship.\n\nIn the early going of the todos-contra-todos (round robin), Licey is in the lead at 3-0.\n\nEscogido outfielder Franchy Cordero has been named both the regular season league MVP and the Rookie of the Year.

The semi-final best-of-seven series open January 4 with Matanzas hosting defending champion Granma, and Las Tunas hosting Industriales (Havana).\n\nAlfredo Despaigne was named Cuban player-of-the-year for 2017 based upon his outstanding season in Japan with the Softbank Falcons and his SN56 post-season play with the defending champion Granma Alazanes.\n\nMEXICO – the LMP regular season wrapped up on December 29. Counting points earned for both the first- and second-half seasons, here are the final consolidated standings:\n\nThe top six teams now advance to the “quarter-finals”. Tomateros de Culiacan will open the best-of-seven series at home against Charros de Jalisco. Likewise, Aguilas de Mexicali will host Venados de Mazatlán and Mayos de Navojoa will host Naranjeros de Hermosillo. You might ask how this can be the “quarter-finals” when there are only three match-ups? Not only will the three winners advance, but the losing team with the best playoff record will also advance.\n\nVENEZUELA – likewise, the LVBP finished their rol regular on December 29. The top six clubs will advance to the post-season in a playoff format similar to Mexico’s. Final standings are:\n\nTeam W L GB Qual? Cardenales 38 25 — Y Navegantes 35 28 3 Y Leones 35 28 3 Y Tigres 32 31 6 Y Caribes 32 31 6 Y Aguilas 31 32 7 Y Bravos 25 38 13 N Tiburones 24 39 14 N\n\nPUERTO RICO – due to the extensive damage from Hurricane Maria, the winter league in Puerto Rico will play an abbreviated schedule beginning on Three Kings Day – January 5. Four teams – Santurce, Carolina, Caguas, and Mayaguez/Aguadilla – will play an 18-game schedule due to complete January 23.\n\nAfter this shortened rol regular, the 2nd and 3rd place finishers will play a single wild-card game, with the winner advancing to a best-of-five final series vs. the 1st place finisher. The winner then advances to defend Puerto Rico’s 2017 Serie del Caribe championship.\n\nNovember 26 – play continues south of the border as the Latin American winter leagues enter their final month of “regular season” action. Here’s the latest:\n\nMEXICO – first-half play in the LMP (Liga Mexicana del Pacifico) concluded on Sunday, November 19. First-half results were:\n\nNaranjeros de Hermosillo were awarded first place, and the eight points that go along with it, by virtue of their winning the first-half series against both Tomateros de Culiacan and Venados de Mazatlán.\n\nSecond-half play is now only a week old, with Aguilas de Mexicali and Venados tied for the lead at 4-1.\n\nSebastian Elizalde of the Tomateros leads LMP hitters with a .383 batting average. He is a Reds farmhand who had a solid summer season at Louisville of the International League, recording a .707 OPS in 134 games played.\n\nCUBA – second-half action continues with the current standings at:\n\nTeam W L GB Las Tunas 44 21 Matanzas 43 23 1.5 Industriales 40 26 4.5 Granma 38 28 6.5 Artemisa 35 33 10.5 Pinar del Rio 34 33 11.0\n\nLas Tunas and Matanzas have played well in the second half and seem to be consolidating their positions as 1-2. Artemisa and Pinar will both have to rally to make the playoffs (the top four clubs advance to the semi-finals in January). There are four weeks remaining in the SN57 regular season.\n\nVeteran Las Tunas DH/OF Danel Castro logged his 2000th hit in Serie Nacional play earlier this month. He is only the 21st player to achieve that mark in 57 years of SN play.\n\nDOMINICANA\n\nTigres del Licey are celebrating the club’s 110th anniversary this season. They have achieved 22 LiDOM league titles and won 10 Series del Caribe in their long, successful history.\n\nCurrent standings in the Dominican Republic are:\n\nTeam W L GB Aguilas 18 12 Gigantes 18 13 0.5 Estrellas 16 13 1.5 Licey 15 17 4.0 Escogido 14 17 4.5 Toros 11 20 7.5\n\nVENEZUELA – Leones de Caracas have won 15 of 20 games since last report and have surged into first place in the Liga Venezolana de Beisbol Profesional (LVBP). Current standings are:\n\nTeam W L GB Caracas 25 15 Aragua 22 16 2.0 Magallanes 22 18 3.0 Zulia 19 19 5.0 Lara 18 19 5.5 Caribes 18 22 7.0 La Guaira 16 22 8.0 Margarita 15 24 9.0\n\nMagallanes OF/DH Jesus Valdez, a veteran Dominican who has played in the minors with the Cubs and Nats, leads the LVBP in HR (13), RBI (46) and Runs Scored (34).\n\nPUERTO RICO – as the Enchanted Island continues to recover from Hurricane Maria, planning continues for a short 21-game “regular season” to begin January 6.\n\nIn the meantime, Puerto Ricans can celebrate the naming of Dave Martinez as manager of the Washington Nationals. A New Yorker of Puerto Rican heritage, he joins Alex Cora as current dirigentes puertorriqueños en Grandes Ligas.\n\nNovember 3 – there’s no need for “baseball withdrawal” after an exciting World Series in the U.S. — there’s plenty of baseball action south of the border. Here are some highlights:\n\nCUBA – Serie Nacional 57 second-half action is underway. Defending champs Granma, along with Artemisa, won their wild-card rounds and join Industriales, Las Tunas, Matanzas, and Pinar del Rio in second-half action. Each of the advancing six teams selected five refuerzos (reinforcements) from the rosters of the teams that were eliminated. Slugging DH/1B Frederich Cepeda was drafted by Pinar del Rio.\n\nCurrent SN57 standings for the second half are as follows (remember that first-half W/L results carry over to the second half):\n\nTeam W L GB Industriales 34 16 — Las Tunas 33 16 0.5 Granma 32 19 2.5 Matanzas 31 19 3.0 Pinar del Rio 29 22 5.5 Artemisa 27 24 7.5\n\nGranma is riding a 12-game winning streak that has jumped them up to third place currently.

The native of Caguas has played, managed, and been the GM of hometown Criollos de Caguas and they won la Serie del Caribe in February. He was GM of the Puerto Rican team in the World Baseball Classic, and they had a great run finishing second in March. He has just won a World Series as bench coach for the Astros.

These games are being made up now in order to complete the first half of the season and determine which six of the sixteen clubs will advance to the second half of the SN57 season.\n\nRiding a 5-game winning streak Las Tunas has pulled to within a half-game of first-place Industriales (Havana) and both clubs have passed Pinar del Rio – who now sit in third place after going 3-7 in their last 10 games. First-half games are due to complete October 9.\n\nYour author had the unique experience of attending Cubaball 2017 in late September. Our weeklong trip to see Cuban baseball is the creation of SABR member Kit Krieger, and was hosted this year by his brother Bob, travel empresario Clem Paredes Rodriguez, and Cuban baseball expert and writer Peter Bjarkman. We visited ballparks in Havana, Cienfuegos, Santa Clara, Artemisa, and Pinar del Rio. The interaction with Cuban ballplayers – past and present – as well as the Cuban people was memorable. I would recommend this trip to any aficionado of beisbol latinoamericano.\n\nA typical SN stadium, Estadio 5 de Septiembre in Cienfuegos (top).

At a press conference held Thursday (October 5), it was announced that a much-shortened season would begin January 6, 2018. The “regular season” will consist of 21 games, played during the day and including Saturday and Sunday doubleheaders. Admission will be free. A short playoff series will be held in late January to determine which team will advance to the Caribbean Series. Puerto Rico is the defending Serie del Caribe champion.\n\nMEXICO – a two-game All Star Series was held jointly by the summer (LMB) and winter (LMP) leagues as a demonstration of cooperation and solidarity in support of earthquake victims. The teams were integrated across the two leagues and the games were held in Culiacan (home of the LMP Tomateros) and Monterrey (home of the LMB Sultanes) on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1.\n\nThe winter regular season will commence next week in MEXICO (Oct. 10), VENEZUELA (Oct. 10), and DOMINICANA (Oct. 13).\n\nSeptember 3 – the Caribbean Confederation, the ruling body of Latin American winter leagues, held its Assembly of Presidents in Jalisco, Mexico and confirmed details of the upcoming Serie del Caribe 2018 to be held in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico. Items of note are:\n\nSchedule – the Series will open Friday February 2 and conclude on Thursday February 8. The complete schedule is posted above.\n\nFormat of competition – the five-team format used since Cuba re-entered competition in 2014 will be continued. The five clubs (the champions of the Cuban, Mexican, Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Venezuelan winter leagues) will play an initial four game round-robin. When the round-robin phase is concluded, the bottom team in the standings will be eliminated and the top four teams will enter a knock-out semi-final round. The two semi-final winners will then play one game for the championship.\n\nEstadio Charros expansion – the host ballpark will be expanded from 12,000 to 16,000 seats, using private investment committed for the project.\n\nCuban participation – the commissioner of the Caribbean Confederation, Juan Francisco Puello, was asked about the current and future status of Cuban participation in the Series. He commented that the Cubans are again participating as invitees in 2018, but that he was confident that they would eventually rejoin the Caribbean Confederation. When asked a follow-up as to when that might occur, he responded “That depends on the politics.”\n\nIn other winter leagues news:\n\nCUBA – SN 57 is well underway, and the current standings follow. Remember that the Cubans play a split season, and after the initial 45 games only the top six teams advance.\n\nTeam Wins Losses Pinar del Rio 16 3 Las Tunas 14 6 Industriales (Havana) 13 7 Santiago de Cuba 12 7 Ciego de Ávila 13 8 Matanzas 12 9 Artemisa 12 9 Villa Clara 10 11 Sancti Spíritus 10 11 Holguín 10 11 Granma 10 11 Camagüey 8 13 Isla de la Juventud 8 13 Mayabeque 8 13 Cienfuegos 6 15 Guantánamo 3 18\n\nVENEZUELA – the LVBP announced that it will proceed with its 2017-18 schedule after the government committed $10M USD from its foreign exchange reserves to help the league buy equipment and pay for the contracts of imported players.\n\nPUERTO RICO – the LBPRC announced approval for a new ownership group for the Santurce franchise. Also announced were cost-control measures for the upcoming 2017-18 season, including playing more doubleheaders.\n\nMEXICO -the LMP has changed their roster rules to increase the number of foreign-born players allowed per active club roster to eight (8). This is viewed as a necessary hedge should the Mexican summer league (LMB) follow through with its plans to play an elongated split-season schedule in summer-fall 2018. Should the LMB extend its schedule into November 2018, this will impact the number of Mexican players that would be available to the LMP for the first month of the Mexican winter league schedule.\n\nAugust 4 – the start of the Winter Leagues is upon us! Serie Nacional 57 opens play in Cuba on August 5 with defending champs Granma hosting Villa Clara. Here are a few news items from the “off season”:\n\nCHANGE IN LOCATION FOR SERIE DEL CARIBE 2018 – The host location for the upcoming Caribbean Series had been announced as Barquisimeto, Lara, Venezuela. However, due to the ongoing social and political unrest in Venezuela, the Caribbean Confederation voted on June 14 to move the Series to Mexico. The Liga Mexicana del Pacifico (LMP) then promptly voted to host Serie del Caribe 2018 in Guadalajara, Jaliso.\n\nThe location for the upcoming Series will be Estadio Charros in Zapopan, Jalisco State, a suburb of Guadalajara. This is the same stadium that hosted second-round play in the World Baseball Classic 2017, and is the home field of the Charros de Jalisco club of the LMP.\n\nOPENING WINTER LEAGUE DATES:\n\nSN 57 Cuba August 5 LVBP Venezuela October 10 LMP Mexico October 10 LiDOM Dominicana October 13 LBPRC Puerto Rico November 9\n\nINTER-LEAGUE CONTROVERSY IN MEXICO – the Liga Mexicana de Beisbol (LMB), the Mexican summer league, has announced plans to operate a split-season in 2018 that will extend that league’s schedule into November. This will overlap with the beginning of the winter league schedule of the LMP, as well as cause conflicts among those players that currently play in both the LMB and LMP.\n\nMore to come on this hot topic.\n\npor Ing. Monte Allan Cely J.\n\nYour author with the two Juan Antonios, and with Mexican fanaticos Jhonny and Martín.\n\nPUERTO RICO WINS SERIE DEL CARIBE 2017\n\nPuerto Rico defeated Mexico 1-0 in ten innings to win their first Caribbean Series crown since the 1999-2000 Winter Season. Yadiel Rivera doubled to lead off the top of the tenth, was sacrificed to third, and then scored on a sacrifice fly by Jonathan Morales.\n\nMexico was held to only four hits by the Criollos pitching staff.\n\nPuerto Rican third baseman David Vidal was voted MVP of Serie del Caribe 2017.\n\nREFLECTIONS ON SERIE DEL CARIBE 2017\n\nThis was my seventh Serie del Caribe and I feel that it was the best one yet. Estadio Tomateros is a major-league quality facility, but with only half the capacity. You are close to the action but have all the amenities of an MLB stadium. The city of Culiacán, Club Tomateros, and the LMP rolled out the red carpet for the fans. The stadium was filled to capacity every evening that the home team played. Attendance at capacity was usually reported as 19,177 tickets sold, but the total figure from the pressbox was in excess of 24,000.\n\nI felt that the level of competition was very equal across the five clubs, with the possible exception of Dominicana. Cuba fielded a strong club and I was told that their roster would closely resemble the national team that will play next month in the World Baseball Classic. Mexico and Venezuela were strong as usual. And of course the Puerto Rican club got hot late in the tournament and took the crown.\n\nA big muchas gracias to my good friend Juan Antonio Jasso (with me in picture below) and his wife Carmen for hosting me before and after Serie del Caribe. They were very gracious to put me up at their beautiful home in Concordia, Sinaloa and take me back and forth to the Mazatlan airport, as well as to and from Culiacán. Their kindness greatly added to my enjoyment.\n\n¡ Adios ! from Culiacán. Thanks for reading !\n\nPOSTSCRIPT – WHAT’S NEXT ? — Here are a few rumors and other topics that I read or heard while in Mexico: Serie del Caribe 2018 is scheduled for Barquisimeto, Venezuela. Should the political and social concerns in Venezuela not settle down somewhat, there was much discussion as to where the upcoming Serie del Caribe might be relocated. The most common alternative, should it be needed, is to return to Mexico. The best bets among LMP venues are either Ciudad Obregón (new stadium) or Guadalajara (large city, lots of accommodations for incoming fans).\n\nThere was also talk about when Cuba might be expected to take its turn in hosting a Serie del Caribe. The Cubans would have to first rejoin the Caribbean Baseball Confederation, as they have been participating as an invited guest since 2014. That will supposedly happen in 2018. So the current thinking is that the Cubans will host no earlier than 2020.\n\nAnother topic concerns what other countries may enter (or re-enter) the Caribbean Baseball Confederation and send a representative to a future Serie del Caribe. Newspaper articles in Culiacán speculated that Panama may re-enter the competition in the next few years.\n\n¡ Vamos a ver ! We shall see!\n\nDAY SIX February 6, 2017\n\nPuerto Rico and Mexico advance to the finals of Serie del Caribe 2017 !\n\nPuerto Rico defeated Venezuela 9-6 in Game One today to qualify for tomorrow´s final. The Puerto Rican club will be looking for their first Serie del Caribe title since 2000. The home team from Mexico will provide the opposition as they defeated Cuba 1-0. Mexico will strive to win their fifth title in the past seven series.\n\nPuerto Rico 9 – Venezuela 6 — Puerto Rico´s offense continued to fire on all cylinders as they jumped to a 8-0 lead and held on for the win. Six Puerto Rican starters had at least one RBI, with David Vidal slugging his third homer of the series. Venezuela tallied 16 hits and 4 walks but could not overcome the early Criollos outburst.\n\nMexico 1 – Cuba 0 — in a rematch of last night´s game, Mexico was able to prevail on the strength of starter Miguel Pena´s five innings and shutout relief from the bullpen. The Mexican pitching staff allowed only 2 hits and 2 walks. Cuban starter Lazaro Blanco allowed only one run in 7 innings, but took the tough loss.\n\nDAY FIVE February 5, 2017\n\nVenezuela 4 – Dominicana 3 — Rene Reyes homered with Ronnie Cedeño aboard in the bottom of the 8th to give Venezuela a come-from-behind victory over Dominicana. For the second consecutive year the Dominican team was swept in the Serie del Carie round-robin.\n\nCuba 4 – Mexico 0 — Alfredo Despaigne broke out of a slump with the 3-run homer to power the Cuban squad past defending champions Mexico. The home team could not solve Cuban starter Vladimir Banos, who pitched 8.2 innings for the win.\n\nThis concludes the round-robin phase of Serie del Caribe 2017. The standings are:\n\nTeam W L Qual? Cuba 3 1 Y Mexico 3 1 Y Venezuela 3 1 Y Puerto Rico 1 3 Y Dominicana 0 4 N\n\nThe Cuban team was awarded first place in the round-robin due to tie-breaker rules.\n\nThe semi-finals will pit Cuba vs. Puerto Rico and Mexico vs. Venezuela.\n\nBoth semi-finals will be played February 6, with the finals slated for February 7. Stand by …\n\nDAY FOUR February 4, 2017\n\nPre-game, we took a field trip to the Sinaloa Baseball Museum and Academy.\n\nThis facility is a state-of-the-art interactive baseball museum and also a baseball development academy. My understanding is that it was built with funding by the state of Sinaloa and MLB serves in an advisory capacity. The museum was impressive. I was able to walk out among the ball fields, however the coaches were not interested in seeing me take a few swings …\n\nPuerto Rico 10 – Dominicana 2 — the Dominican club is eliminated, for the second straight year, and Criollos de Caguas advance to the semi-finals. Rusney Castillo led the PR attack with a homer and three RBIs. Ivan de Jesús, Jr. added two RBI and scored three times. Eight Licey pitchers could not stop the Puerto Rican offensive outburst.\n\nVenezuela 8 – Cuba 3 — Venezuela mounted a 15-hit attack, led by Freddy Galvis and Ronnie Cedeno with three each. Cuban starter Freddy Alvarez was lifted with only one out in the first inning after Venezuela jumped out to a 3-0 lead. Cuban 2B Carlos Benitez tied the game in the second with a 3-run homer. However, Venezuela continued to chip away at the Cuban bullpen and took advantage of two Cuba errors to post the win. Wil Ledezma was the winner in relief for Zulia.\n\nDAY THREE February 3, 2017\n\nToday was the induction ceremony for the Caribbean Series Hall of Fame.\n\nThe inductees, from left to right, are:\n\nVinnie Castilla, Erubiel Durazo, Miguel Flores, Benjamin Reyes (accepted posthumously by his son), Alfonso Araujo Bojórquez, and Juan Manuel Ley (accepted posthumously by his son)\n\nCuba 6 – Puerto Rico 1 — Cuban pitching was sharp again, with starter Vladimir Garcia going six innings for the win and the Cuban bullpen again held their opponents scoreless. William Saavedra´s 2-run homer in the 7th sealed the win for Cuba. The Cuban squad continued to look strong on both offense and defense.\n\nMexico 5 – Venezuela 1 — This game was Águilas contra Águilas – Eagles vs. Eagles. Sebastián Valle´s walk-off grand slam in the bottom of the ninth won the game for Méxicali. Barry Enright started for Mexico and pitched 5 strong innings allowing only one run. The Mexican bullpen wrapped up with four scoreless innings and Oliver Perez got the win.\n\nWith these results, the standings for todos-contra-todos – the round robin phase – after three days of play are:\n\nTeam Won Loss Mexico 3 0 Cuba 2 0 Venezuela 1 1 Puerto Rico 0 2 Dominicana 0 2\n\nDAY TWO February 2, 2017\n\nWe were joined at breakfast by Eduardo Almada, a fellow SABR member and well-known broadcaster and columnist. Eddie is also the son of Baldomero “Melo” Almada, the first Mexican-born pelotero to play in the U.S. major leagues. We had a far-ranging discussion with Eddie on baseball topics both north- and south-of-the-border.\n\nWe had a late lunch at the stadium club at Estadio Tomateros:\n\nVenezuela 4 – Puerto Rico 3 — Venezuelan catcher Jesus Flores´ 2-run homer in the top of the second put Zulia ahead to stay. David Vidal homered for Caguas in the 8th to make it close at 4-3, but that was how the final score stood.\n\nMexico 7 – Dominicana 2 — Jason Bourgeois 2 RBI triple put Mexicali ahead in the fifth inning and CJ Retherford´s 3-run homer in the top of the seventh broke the game open. Chris Roberson was 4-5 with two runs scored. Starter Hector Velazquez pitched five innings for the win and the bullpen shut down Licey the rest of the way. The game was another sellout with attendance over 19,000.\n\nAfter the first two days of play, the round-robin phase standings are:\n\nTeam Won Loss Mexico 2 0 Venezuela 1 0 Cuba 1 0 Puerto Rico 0 2 Dominicana 0 2\n\nDAY ONE February 1, 2017\n\nCuba 4 – Dominicana 0 — Cuban leadoff hitter Roel Santos tripled and scored on a passed ball in the top of the first. That was all the offense Cuba needed as they posted a shutout in the Series opener. Granma starter Lazaro Blanco threw 6.1 innings and was relieved by Liran Moinelo who got all of the final eight outs.\n\nMexico 4 – Puerto Rico 2 — Mexicali stalwart Chris Roberson broke a 1-1 tie with a two run homer in the bottom of the seventh. Yunieski Betancourt added a homer in the 8th to give Mexico an insurance run. Mexican starter Daniel Rodriguez and three relievers allowed only five Criollos hits.\n\nOpening Ceremonies — we were treated to a fantastic light show and Dodgers rookie pitcher Julio Urias threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Attendance was announced at 19,177.\n\nYour author and fellow SABR member Lewis Rubman doing some sight-seeing in downtown Culiacan.\n\nJanuary 31, 2017\n\nI´ve arrived in Culiacan, Sinaloa and the city is hopping with anticipation of the start of Serie del Caribe. On the TV news this morning, they are reporting that all hotels in the Culiacan metro area are lleno (sold out).\n\nI will report further tomorrow or as there is any breaking news.\n\nStay tuned …\n\nJanuary 29, 2017\n\nTHE FINAL FIELD IS SET FOR SERIE DEL CARIBE 2017:\n\nThe five champions of the participating winter leagues have been determined, as follows:\n\nÁguilas de Méxicali wins its fourth LMP title. The Eagles represent the Baja California city of Mexicali. Their home park is Estadio B-Air.\n\nTigres del Licey is one of the most-storied of Dominican clubs. The 2016-17 LiDOM title is their 22nd. Their home field is Estadio Quisqueya Juan Marichal in the capital city of Santo Domingo.\n\nCriollos de Caguas is a historic Puerto Rican team and this year’s title is the 17th in their history. They play at Parque Yldefonso Sola’ Morales in the central Puerto Rican city of Caguas.\n\nÁguilas del Zulia won its sixth Venezuelan title and appear in Serie del Caribe for the first time in 17 years. They play in Estadio Luis Aparacio in Maracaibo.\n\nAlazanes de Granma won its first Serie Nacional title. The Sorrel Colts play in Bayamo, the seat of Granma province.\n\nSerie del Caribe 2017 will get underway Wednesday, February 1 in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico, the capital city of the state of Sinaloa. The tournament will run through February 7 (see the game schedule, below). The site will be the one-year-old Estadio Tomateros (also known by its naming-rights as Estadio BBVA Bancomer). The stadium has a capacity of 20,000 with dimensions of 322′ down both foul lines and 410′ in straight-away center field.\n\nThe winter league winners from Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Cuba will again compete for the title of “The Caribbean World Series”. The system of competition will be the same as in the past few years:\n\nPhase 1 – A five-team, four-game round robin after which the bottom team will be eliminated.\n\nPhase 2 – Two semi-final games pitting the #1 vs. #4 finishers and the #2 vs. #3 finishers from Phase 1.\n\nFinal – A single-game finale between the two semi-final winners.\n\nThe schedule for Serie del Caribe 2017 is as follows (note that Culiacán observes U.S. Mountain time during winter months):\n\nEvery year I make my travel arrangements with Travesias Mundiales, a travel agency in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico. The owner, Thelma Acosta, and her team always do a great job with the logistics and make my travel easy and enjoyable. Their web site is here.\n\nThelma (red jacket) and her team at Travesias Mundiales in Hermosillo.\n\nWINTER LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 2017\n\nJanuary 28, 2017\n\nMEXICO – Méxicali clinched the LMP crown with a 13-1 victory at Los Mochis. Águilas took the series 4 games to 2. This is the fourth league championship for the Eagles and their first since the 1998-99 season.\n\nDOMINICANA – the LiDOM final series went all the way to a ninth and final game. Emilio Bonifacio’s three-RBI double in the decisive top of the 6th inning powered Tigres del Licey to the win over Águilas Cibaeñas 6-2. This is Licey’s 22nd Dominican league title.\n\nJanuary 25, 2017\n\nPUERTO RICO – Caguas defeated Santurce 6-5 in 12 innings before a standing-room-only home crowd of 11,200 at Parque Yldefonso Sola Morales.

This is the first corona for Granma in its 40 seasons competing in Serie Nacional.\n\nIf, like me, the name “Granma” sounds familiar, it is not only the name of the Cuban province where the club plays, but also the name of the yacht that brought Castro and his revolutionaries back to Cuba from Mexico in 1956. El yate is featured in the team logo. Furthermore, it is the name of the official party newspaper published in Havana.\n\nGranma now advances to la Serie del Caribe and awaits the determination of the other four league champions.\n\nPUERTO RICO – Caguas leads Santurce 4-3 in the best-of-nine finals.\n\nDOMINICANA – Licey and Águilas are tied 2-2 in the best-of-nine finale.\n\nVENEZUELA – Zulia leads Lara 2-0 in the best-of-seven finals.\n\nMEXICO – Los Mochis and Méxicali are tied 1-1 in the best-of-seven finale.\n\nJanuary 20, 2017 – both Mexican Pacific League semi-finals went down to a deciding seventh game last night:\n\nMéxicali prevailed over Hermosillo 4-3 in 16 innings at Estadio B-Air in Baja California.\n\nLos Mochis defeated Culiacán 3-1 to join Méxicali in the LMP finals.
