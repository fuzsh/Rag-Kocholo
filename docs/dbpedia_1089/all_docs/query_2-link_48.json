        "text": "Gastric sleeve surgery, or sleeve gastrectomy, can be a life-changing option for people who struggle to lose weight despite a healthy diet and regular exercise. Unfortunately, the cost of this bariatric procedure in the U.S. can be prohibitively high for many who could benefit most from it.\n\nDr. Sandy Martinez is a board-certified bariatric surgeon just across the border in Tijuana, Mexico, who sees a different path for bariatric patients. She charges just $4,500 for gastric sleeve at an elite bariatric facilityâ€”that's an all-inclusive price.\n\nRead on to learn about the world-class weight loss services you can receive for one flat fee. If you're ready to get started on your affordable weight loss surgery, we welcome you to request a completely free consultation.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the average cost for gastric sleeve surgery in the United States can range from $17,000 to as much as $26,000. These prices typically account for doctor and hospital fees, but not much else.\n\nYou can travel just minutes across the border to Tijuana and pay only $4,500 for the same weight loss surgery performed by a board-certified surgeon in state-of-the-art facilities. Our price includes everything you will need for a comfortable and successful stay.\n\nThis may sound too good to be true, but it isn't! Surgeons in Mexico tend to have much lower operating costs overall, which has made Tijuana a top medical tourism destination for patients who don't want to pay outrageous prices.\n\nOf course, it's important to carefully consider whether the surgeon you have in mind is well-qualified. Dr. Sandy Martinez, for example, is a board-certified and American-affiliated surgeon who has performed more than 1,500 gastric procedures. Her impressive background and track record of success make her an excellent choice to help you get the weight loss results you want."
