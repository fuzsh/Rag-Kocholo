        "text": "If you’re a scout, you can dial up data on a prospect and sift it six ways from Sunday, but all the while you’re replaying little vignettes in your mind.\n\nLike this one, from Andrew Tinnish, the Blue Jays vice-president of international scouting, recalled from a warm day two months ago in Dunedin, Fla. An 18-year-old kid was taking batting practice on Field 1, in the southwest corner of the old training complex on Solon Avenue.\n\n“That’s a big field,” Tinnish said. “Before spring training was shut down, I was able to see him take BP, and he was putting balls across the road – over the fence, then there’s a little ditch, then there’s a road, and another little ditch and a wall and some housing behind it. He was putting balls on the road, and fairly effortlessly too.”\n\nTinnish is right. It’s a big field, and it takes a mighty poke to put a ball onto Garrison Road beyond the left-centre field fence. When he was coming up, Vlad Guerrero Jr. used to do that, and folks oohed and ahhed.\n\nOrelvis Martínez is no Vlad. At least not yet. But with considerably less hype, and one pro season behind him, he’s already a consensus top-five prospect in the Blue Jays’ system. Keith Law of The Athletic ranks him No. 4 and says, “He could be the Jays’ best prospect in a year.”\n\nMartínez also heads up a remarkable group of six Latin American shortstop prospects in the Toronto system. Law has three of them in his Jays’ Top 20. Some may eventually change positions, but for the moment they give the Jays exceptional depth at a premium position.\n\nRecently, between job-related Zoom calls, Tinnish spent an hour on the phone walking me through his scouting reports on Martínez and company. We also discussed how the Blue Jays’ increased emphasis on Latin American scouting in recent years has enriched their farm system.\n\n“More than anything,” he says, “we’ve put more time and resources into scouting to find that talent.”\n\nAn Ontario native who pitched at Brock University, Tinnish joined the Jays as an intern in 2001 and moved up the scouting ranks. Roughly 10 years ago, he says, Toronto had about 15 scouts and supervisors assigned to Latin America. Now, counting himself and three other delegated staff working out of Toronto and Dunedin, that number sits at 23.\n\nAs we discuss the Latino prospects, I mention in passing that the Blue Jays seem well-stocked in the middle infield the moment. (You may have heard a bit of buzz around Bo Bichette and Cavan Biggio.)\n\n“One thing I’ve learned over the years is that it’s great to have options,” Tinnish replies. “I’m not arrogant enough or dumb enough to think that all these guys are going to end up as everyday big-leaguers or stars. The odds say that’s not going to happen. But you never have enough good-quality depth.”\n\nToday, we’ll look at the top two Latino shortstops in the queue. Later this week, we’ll check out the other four.\n\nOrelvis Martínez, 18\n\nDominican Republic\n\n6-foot-1, 188 lbs.\n\nSigned 2018, $3.5 million\n\nHis mother recalls Orelvis showing a passion for hitting a baseball at age 3 in their hometown of Santo Domingo. Miriam Martínez urged her husband, Orelvi, to enroll the boy in a league. No, Orelvi said. He’s too young for that right now.\n\nSo mom started pitching to her son.\n\n“I remember saying to my husband that, given that refusal, I would become his coach. I was the one who gave him his practice,” Miriam Martínez told the Dominican newspaper El Caribe when her son signed with the Jays. (Quote translated from the Spanish report, via Google translate)\n\nThe boy’s passion never waned. His dad, who works for one of the buscones (independent trainers) in the Dominican, helped with his development. Scouted in his early teens like every top Latino prospect, Martínez signed with the Jays at 16. His $3.5-million bonus was the highest for an international prospect of that age in 2018.\n\nIn his professional debut last season, he slashed .275/.352/.559 in the Gulf Coast League. His seven home runs came in just 142 at-bats and ranked second in the league. His .901 OPS ranked fourth.\n\nSandy Rosario, the Jays’ director of international operations, and scout Alexis de la Cruz were chiefly responsible for scouting Martínez. But before he signed, Tinnish saw him take about 60 at-bats. He concluded that the kid was a rare find.\n\n“It’s very rare to walk out of a ballpark feeling like you can check so many boxes – the hit box, the power box, the plate-discipline box, the ability to hit velocity box, the ability to recognize spin,” Tinnish says. “Obviously, that’s my subjective opinion on what I saw and time will tell. But there’s not too many young bats that I’ve seen down there where I’ve felt comfortable checking all of those boxes.\n\n“We had seen him against guys who were upwards of 94, 95 miles an hour, and he was very comfortable. He wasn’t overwhelmed. And his at-bats were good. He drove balls against really good pitching, and he did it consistently.”\n\nWhile nobody’s projecting such lofty comparisons just yet, Martínez’s setup and swing remind Tinnish a little of José Bautista and Josh Donaldson.\n\n“He’s got a big leg kick and a big hand pump, but they’re really well-sequenced together. The ability to do that at 14, 15 and 16 years old was also really impressive. The ability to keep his upper and lower half sequenced well is rare. It took José quite a while to figure that part out, and when he did, he went off, obviously. Orelvis does some of those José-Josh Donaldson big movements and, at least to this point, he’s been able to sequence and time those up effectively. To see that in a kid that age with results, not just dribblers and pop-ups, was pretty impressive.”\n\nScouts say Martínez has good hands and a loose, strong arm. Listed at 6-foot-1 and 188 pounds, he will get bigger and stronger. Many scouts, including Law, suggest that will eventually mean a move to third base.\n\n“The biggest challenge for him will be staying mobile and rangy,” Tinnish says. “At the end of the day, generally speaking, the guys that stay at short are the guys that are able to move around and get to the most balls.”\n\nBut it’s too early to count Martínez out at short, he says. Sometimes a prospect can banish the skeptics through his work ethic, drive and sheer will.\n\nTinnish points out two examples: Bichette, who many thought would have to move to second base, and Canadian prospect Adam Hall, whose questionable “arm strength and body control” left Baseball America wondering in a pre-draft report whether he could stick at short. So far in the minors, Hall has shown the Orioles that he can.\n\n“Orelvis is not going to react like Bo or Adam Hall,” Tinnish says. “If you tell those guys they can’t play short, they’re gonna freak out and get in your face and say, ‘Yes I can.’ Orevis is probably gonna be like, ‘Whatever, dude. I know I can play short.’\n\nWhich is pretty much the way Martínez approaches every aspect of his game.\n\n“He’s not a crazy, loud, energy guy,” Tinnish says. “He’s very intense and he’s very confident, but he does it in a quiet way. You could see that even as early as 14 years old, when I first saw him.”\n\nMeanwhile, the hit tool is unmistakable. And the power potential too.\n\n“He’s really lean, but I do think he’s going to get bigger,” Tinnish says. “His dad is not tall, but he’s a tank – not quite like (Marcus) Stroman’s dad, but it’s that same narrow-waisted, strong-frame type. So I think he’ll get stronger and hit for some power, especially when you have an above-average level of discipline and you already have power.”\n\nMiguel Hiraldo, 19\n\nDominican Republic\n\n5-foot-11, 170 lbs.\n\nSigned 2017, $750,000\n\nLike Martinez, Hiraldo is quiet and confident. He also can hit.\n\n“When you ask who was the best hitter in the (2017 international) class, obviously you start with Wander Franco (Rays) and Julio Rodriguez (Mariners),” Tinnish says. “But Hiraldo was always kind of in that conversation, maybe not in the same pool as Franco and Rodriguez, but you always heard, ‘This guy can really hit.’\n\n“He absolutely raked at every sort of event or showcase or workout that we saw him at. Maybe he wasn’t hitting homers or balls off the wall – obviously the power has started to come around – but his consistency was always there.”\n\nYes, the power is budding. Last season at Bluefield, Hiraldo hit .300 with seven homers, 20 doubles and an .829 OPS in 237 at-bats.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to spot a good prospect with a long swing that has served him well against inferior amateur pitching. Hiraldo was just the opposite. His swing is compact. Tinnish wondered if it might be a little too compact.\n\nHere, Tinnish gets a tad technical, but to follow along, cock your hands in an imaginary batting stance and watch what happens when you lock, load and swing.\n\nTinnish explains: “You watch every hitter in the big leagues from the open side, and one of the things you’ll see is their front elbow at foot-strike – when they stride and are about to start their swing – their lead elbow will generally get to or slightly past the midline of the body.\n\n“Miguel never got back that far. When you don’t go back that far, it seemed, at least to me, that it’s harder to generate bat speed and power. But he still was able to do it. And I was like, ‘Man, this guy has got to get longer. We’re gonna have to lengthen him out.’\n\n“Now I’m not comparing him to Ronald Acuña, but Acuña does the same thing. What it means is that you’ve got tremendous hand strength, that you can use your wrists and hands to generate a lot of the bat speed.”\n\nSo there’s no thought of asking Hiraldo to lengthen his swing. Over two pro seasons and nearly 500 at-bats, his slash line is .300/.354/.460.\n\nAfter two decades of evaluating talent, Tinnish understands the importance of staying open-minded. Watching Hiraldo hit made him challenge his own preconceptions.\n\n“It was a learning experience for me personally. It’s like, ‘Maybe I’m wrong about that. Maybe more guys can do this.’”\n\nIt’s questionable whether Hiraldo’s thickset body will allow him to stick at short. MLB Pipeline calls him “a physically advanced teenager with below-average speed and modest defensive actions,” making him a third-base candidate. Baseball America agrees. Law suggests a better spot is second base, where Hiraldo played more than half of his games last year.\n\nComing later this week: A look at four more young Latino shortstop prospects and the impact baseball’s pandemic shutdown might have on their development."
