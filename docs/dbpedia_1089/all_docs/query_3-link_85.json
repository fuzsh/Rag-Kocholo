        "text": "EDINBURG, Texas – There was a time, a few years back, when any time a Rio Grande Valley economic development group needed an economist to give an economic analysis of the region they would choose Dr. Salvador Contreras.\n\nThis was particularly true during the time he was director of the Center for Border Economic Studies at UT-Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThen, Contreras’ appearances at public policy events seemed to dry up as he took on more administrative roles at the university.\n\nWell, now it has been announced that Contreras has taken over as associate dean for the UTRGV Graduate College. He started August 1.\n\nHe takes over from Dr. Sandra (Sandy) Hansmann, who has joined Texas A&M University Higher Education Center at McAllen.\n\n“I am pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Salvador Contreras as the associate dean for the UTRGV Graduate College,” said Dr. Can. Saygin, senior vice president for research and dean of the Graduate College at UTRGV.\n\n“Dr. Contreras is a professor of economics at the UTRGV Robert College. Vackar College of Business and Entrepreneurship. He holds a PhD in Economics from Claremont Graduate University.”\n\nCan said Contreras has taken on various roles, including director of the Center for Border Economic Studies for eight years, since joining UTRGV in 2009.\n\n“Most recently, he served as the associate dean for Graduate and Professional Programs at the Robert C. Vackar College of Business & Entrepreneurship. Additionally, Dr. Contreras is the president-elect of the American Society of Hispanic Economists.”\n\nCan said that as he welcomes Contreras to his new role, he also extends his “heartfelt gratitude” to Dr. Hansmann for her “exceptional service” as associate dean for the Graduate College.\n\n“Dr. Hansmann has been a visionary leader, significantly contributing to the success of graduate students and UTRGV research portfolio,” Can said. “She has been named the new assistant provost at the Texas A&M University Higher Education Center at McAllen, and I wish her all the best in her new position.”\n\nCan added: “Please join me in welcoming Dr. Contreras to his new role and in thanking Dr. Hansmann for her impactful years of service at UTRGV.”\n\nContreras responded: “Thank you Dr. Can Saygin. I’m honored to join the team and look forward to the work ahead.”"
