        "text": "The Smith County Sheriff's Office Sent Us Details About A Couple Who Were Captured After Several Recent Dollar Store Thefts.\n\nA Tyler man and woman are in the Smith County Jail after police claim that they allegedly went on a string of thefts at Dollar General stores in Smith County this week.\n\nOn Monday, August 5, 2024, at approximately 11:30 am, Whitehouse Police Officers responded to a theft call at the Dollar General located at 701 Hwy 110 South in Whitehouse.\n\nUpon their arrival, the suspects had fled the area in what was described as a black Nissan Titan pickup. Approximately 20 minutes later, Smith County Deputies responded to a theft at the Dollar General located at 18903 FM 2493 in Flint.\n\nIt was quickly determined that both thefts involved the same male and female suspect who entered the store and filled grocery carts full of merchandise and then exited.\n\nSmith County Property Crimes Investigators had been monitoring the radio traffic of these two thefts due to the ongoing nature of similar thefts in the past few weeks. They quickly responded and developed a known suspect vehicle and license plate from surveillance video.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 pm, they located the suspect vehicle near the intersection of Claude and Confederate in Tyler.\n\nThree suspects were identified with the truck.\n\n56 year old Nigel Harris was booked into the Smith County Jail on warrants for Possession of a Controlled Substance PG 1 and Parole Violation with bonds totaling $150,000.\n\n58 year old Aineda Johnson was booked into the Smith County Jail on a warrant for Possession of a Controlled Substance PG 1 with a bond of $30,000.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that these suspects, as well as additional known suspects have been involved in a multitude of similar theft cases to include locations in Bullard, Tyler, Whitehosue, and other areas of Smith County.\n\nSmith County Investigators announced that they will be handling these theft cases and additional charges are expected within the next few days on a number of suspects as their investigation continues."
