        "text": "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — Sandy Alcantara made the first glove he ever used to play baseball.\n\nIt was more like a form-fitting paperboard glove than an actual baseball mitt.\n\nBut it was comfortable and effective enough for a 9-year-old Alcantara to slip his left hand into and go play.\n\nThe baseballs Alcantara used?\n\nOranges.\n\nFlinging these heavier projectiles across infields and outfields was the first way that Alcantara showed off a powerful right arm that eventually would hurl baseballs from the mound to home plate at over 100 mph.\n\nAlcantara, now 23 and a pitcher entering his second season with the Marlins, has not forgotten what it was like to play baseball in its purest form.\n\nHe also hasn’t stopped feeling a deep-rooted connection to his past.\n\nIt’s why he spends most of the offseason in the Dominican Republic.\n\nIt’s why he makes the nearly hour-long drive back home to his family’s neighborhood in Monte Plata as often as he can.\n\nIt’s why he makes that trip in the black 2002 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport — the only car he has ever owned — that he bought in 2013 after he signed his first pro contract six years ago with the Cardinals for $125,000.\n\nIt’s why those closest to him say Alcantara’s greatest gift is his loyalty.\n\n“I always remember the place I came from,” Alcantara said. “My family is always on my mind, and I thank God every day for what he’s given me and my family.”\n\nI spent a recent Sunday afternoon with Alcantara that began at his home in Santo Domingo and culminated in a trip to the place where his baseball journey began.\n\nIt started with a whistle\n\nBarely an hour into my first visit to the D.R., I am speeding down the George Washington Highway along the island’s southern coast.\n\nSitting next to me as I ride shotgun in his black Hyundai Tuscon, my driver, Santos, makes a right onto Maximo Gomez Ave., the main road on the way to Alcantara’s house.\n\nThe street, named after the Dominican-born military leader who fought for Cuban independence against the Spanish in the late 19th century, evokes memories of my own family’s heritage on my father’s side.\n\nHow fitting, as I am on this trip to learn more about the roots of one of the Marlins’ most promising pitchers.\n\nI quickly learn to trust Santos’ expertise navigating the notorious organized chaos of downtown traffic in Santo Domingo.\n\nFrom the street vendors hawking iPhone covers at red lights in the populated downtown area to the rural marketplaces with restaurants and food stands bustling with noise and booming salsa or reggaeton, I feel like I’ve seen more of the real country in 30 minutes than most tourists do in an entire week.\n\nAfter 40 minutes, we come upon a gated community of apartments on the north side of the city in the town of Villa Mella.\n\nThough not as upscale-looking as the homes you’d see near the Marlins’ spring training home in Jupiter or in Miami’s Coconut Grove neighborhood, these middle-class apartments (some built on elevations) are still a sizable upgrade from some of the houses we had just passed on the way.\n\nAfter the first guard lets us through, we drive a few more minutes and pass another guard to enter one of the apartment complexes.\n\nAlcantara told me which building is his, but as we park, I notice it has four floors and the apartments aren’t clearly marked. The main door is also locked.\n\nThen I hear a whistle from above.\n\nI look up, and Alcantara gives me an “Ay, what’s up!” In less than a minute, he comes down the four flights of stairs and Alcantara’s lanky 6-foot-4 frame emerges from the entrance and greets me with a smile.\n\nWe catch up as we climb back up those stairs to his place.\n\nWith a quick knock at the door, Alcantara lets his family know they have a visitor.\n\nDevotion to family\n\nAlcantara’s younger brother, Rafelin, greets me first. He is one of Alcantara’s nine siblings.\n\nWearing a red St. Louis Cardinals T-shirt, Rafelin is about to sit down for lunch and Alcantara invites me to join them.\n\nBut first, I meet Alcantara’s girlfriend, Yorleni, and their 4-year old son, Yorlin Sadiel.\n\nAlcantara met her when he was 13 and they’ve been together ever since.\n\nThey’ve lived together in their apartment the past five years as they raise their first child.\n\nAlcantara keeps a couple of pictures of his girlfriend and son on a table near the entrance to the apartment. It’s set right next to a baseball from his first career start last June 29 when he pitched five innings to pick up a win against the Mets at Marlins Park. Just behind it sits a baseball from 2017 when he first pitched in the Arizona Fall League.\n\nBecoming a pitcher\n\nMy attention is drawn to the dining room table where Yorleni and Sandy have quickly prepared a plate of white rice with habichuelas (stewed beans) — a staple of Dominican cuisine — and eggplant along with a fresh glass of papaya juice.\n\nAlcantara joins me, sitting at the opposite end of the table, and laughs. He gets a kick out of the fact I’m enjoying the meal and after I thank him not just for lunch but for a dish similar to the black beans and rice my grandmother made me growing up.\n\nWe chat about how he moved to this place soon after signing with the Cardinals in 2013 and how that journey took him all the way to Miami and, possibly, a spot in the Marlins’ rotation.\n\nOriginally from Azua, a town located about a two-hour drive from his apartment, Alcantara moved to Monte Plata when he was 9 and started playing organized baseball while living with his older sister, Aridia.\n\nIt wasn’t until he was 12 or 13 that Alcantara started honing the skill that would punch his ticket to the Big Show.\n\nAfter a few years playing “any position I wanted to” on the baseball field, Alcantara jumped at the chance one day to take the mound during a youth league game.\n\n“I used to just go play baseball for fun,” Alcantara said. “I didn’t care where I played on the field. But one day, I was in a game and the pitcher that day said his arm was tired. I was like ‘Let me pitch, let me pitch!’\n\n“They put me on the mound. I didn’t even have cleats,” said Alcantara, who said he used a first baseman’s glove at the time while he pitched. “But I started firing away fastball after fastball. They knew I had a good arm.”\n\nAlcantara had the kind of big arm that could take him places.\n\nBut he needed to learn how to pitch.\n\nHe went home after that first day and looked up footage on YouTube of two of the sport’s all-time greats.\n\n“I started watching videos of Pedro Martinez and of Roger Clemens. I started studying to find out how to properly grip the ball to throw a curveball, a slider, a cutter, every different pitch. Then I started practicing how to throw them.”\n\nAlcantara would eventually catch the attention of Ronny Jimenez, an international scout who passed away five years ago. Jimenez watched Alcantara pitch when he was 17 and took him to try out for the Cardinals.\n\nAfter also trying out for the San Francisco Giants, Alcantara got an invite to a second workout with the Cardinals.\n\nHe impressed them enough to earn his first pro contract.\n\n“In that second tryout, (the Cardinals) had me pitch two innings and I struck out seven … all six batters, plus an extra hitter they had me face,” Alcantara said with a laugh.\n\nReturning home\n\nAs Alcantara turns the keys in the ignition of his SUV, it takes a second or two to rumble to life, likely a sign of the vehicle’s age.\n\nBut Alcantara loves that his Outlander has lasted this long — he appreciates what he has in his life.\n\nWe take the Autopista del Nordeste (Northeast Highway) toward Monte Plata.\n\nThough you don’t see highway troopers or police vehicles, you do see utility vehicles parked on the side of the road every few miles.\n\nThis is a service he tells me is provided by the country’s Department of Public Works to respond to traffic accidents or issues as promptly as possible.\n\nAlcantara cranks up his radio to a playlist of different artists singing or rapping both in English and Spanish. Alcantara’s English has improved plenty since his days playing for the Cardinals’ Rookie League affiliate in West Palm Beach when he was 17.\n\n“I remember getting off the plane in Fort Lauderdale and thinking, ‘Where am I?’” Alcantara said. “Hardly anybody spoke Spanish where we lived in Jupiter. It was tough to even order food when we went out to eat.”\n\nAlcantara selects one of his favorite hype-up songs that he listens to before a start — “God’s Plan” by Drake — and cues it up.\n\nHe recalls his first major-league call-up with the Cardinals in September of 2017 and how nervous he was. Coincidentally, Alcantara made his debut against the Giants — the other team he auditioned for six years earlier.\n\n“I was eager to pitch and at the same time dreading it,” Alcantara said. “I’m in the bullpen in the sixth inning out in San Francisco and that phone rang. I was hoping it was for me. The bullpen coach goes, ‘Hey, Alcantara! Get ready.’ But then they told another pitcher to warm up, too, so I wasn’t sure if they were going to tell me to pitch or the other guy. I just started warming up.\n\n“Then they called me. I went in, and my heart was racing. I got up on the mound. I thanked God and then I turned around and Yadier Molina was standing there. He goes ‘Oye (listen), don’t worry. Just throw it over the plate, I’ll take care of the rest.’ I just said to myself, ‘I’ve got the best catcher in baseball catching me. Let’s do this.’ I just focused on him. I didn’t shake him off once. I just threw everything he called.”\n\nAlcantara’s first pitch that day hit 97 miles per hour. The next one, however, was hit for a solo home run by Tim Federowicz. After a quick pep talk from Molina, Alcantara retired Gorkys Hernandez on a popup for his first major-league out. Two batters later, Alcantara made his first notable big-league memory, striking out perennial All-Star catcher Buster Posey.\n\n“Curve, strike, slider, strike, change, strike,” Alcantara said. “Yadi came up to me and said, ‘See, you can do it.’ That made me feel a lot more confident.”\n\nAlcantara spent the rest of the month in the majors learning as much as he could.\n\nTwo months later, his career took a different path. The Cardinals shipped Alcantara to Miami, along with outfielder Magneuris Sierra and minor-league pitchers Zac Gallen and Daniel Castano, in exchange for two-time All-Star outfielder Marcell Ozuna.\n\nAlcantara was the key piece in a trade the Marlins have yet to see significant results from at the major-league level.\n\nSierra raised concerns after a poor debut (.190/.220/.211 in 147 at-bats) late last season. Gallen (3.65 ERA in 133 1/3 triple-A innings last year) has a shot at cracking the major-league roster in 2019, but it remains to be seen if he can pitch well enough to stay there. And Castano, a 24-year-old lefty starter, has yet to pitch higher than the advanced-A level.\n\nThe Marlins hope Alcantara, who is projected to be part of their Opening Day rotation, can become a fixture in it for years to come.\n\nBut should Alcantara fall short of those goals, it would be a setback to the Marlins’ rebuilding plan that hinges mainly on successfully developing the assets they’ve obtained in the Ozuna trade and other deals involving Giancarlo Stanton, Christian Yelich, Dee Gordon and J.T. Realmuto.\n\nThe Marlins will more than likely give Alcantara — who went 2-3 with a 3.44 ERA in six starts (34 innings) in the majors last year after compiling a 3.89 ERA in 115 2/3 innings at Triple A — every opportunity to make a full season’s worth of starts this year.\n\nAlcantara’s powerful four-seam fastball is complemented by a tough slider that had a 44.4 percent strikeout rate last year, and a sinker, changeup and curveball combo that with improvement could make him dominant.\n\nBut Alcantara, who struck out 30 batters last year in the majors, also walked 23 and must improve his command to have sustained success.\n\n“He has all the stuff to be at least a No. 2 or 3 starter in the majors,” Baseball America’s Kegan Lowe said on a recent podcast analyzing the Marlins’ farm system. “The control isn’t quite there, but it’s not anything mechanical. He’s just a tall, lanky guy and sometimes it’s hard for those guys especially when they’re young to get in synch especially when you’re throwing that hard and have that explosiveness. The command and the consistency is what it comes down to. He has the four pitches necessary to have success in the majors.”\n\nDrawing inspiration from tragedy\n\nAlcantara lost one of his brothers, Alexander, to a motorcycle accident in Santo Domingo not long after he made his debut.\n\nIt put things into perspective for Alcantara, who got a tattoo on his left arm shortly after his death. The tattoo is of hands clasped together in prayer over clouds and a dove with the words “RIP Lexi” underneath.\n\nAlcantara has another tattoo on his other arm by his biceps with the name of his son that reads, “Work hard and quietly and let your success make the noise. God First. Yorlin Sadiel Alcantara Martinez.”\n\nAlcantara doesn’t wear any reminders of family, like a chain or a bracelet, on the mound but draws inspiration from the body art he got in memory of his brother and as a tribute to his son.\n\n“I always look at my tattoos before I start pitching,” Alcantara said.\n\nLike a rock star\n\nOur route takes us past a seemingly endless vista of grassy farmland with mountains in the distance off to the east. Herds of goats or cows come into view every so often just past the highway barrier.\n\n“Most of the people that live around here live off the land and what they can farm,” Alcantara tells me, giving me a tour as we go.\n\nAs we get closer, the road narrows to one lane in each direction.\n\nThen come the speed bumps: You have to slow way down or risk hurting your tires.\n\nRows of small stores and sidewalk stands selling fruit, coco frio (cold coconuts) and peanuts line this road along with some restaurants and Presidente beer booths.\n\nSoon, hints of baseball become visible.\n\nWe pass a dirt road surrounded by tall grass with a sign pointing toward the Vladimir Guerrero Baseball Academy.\n\nA couple minutes later, a group of young kids wearing baseball uniforms (a local youth league team) is gathered with an older man also in uniform (likely their coach) partaking outside one of the eateries.\n\nAs we get closer, Alcantara starts recognizing people on the sidewalk and waves at a couple of them. We then stop and say hi to his mother-in-law, who lives in the area.\n\nAlcantara then points to a baseball field that comes into view to our left.\n\nIt’s the park where he first started playing the game.\n\n“We’ll go there in a little bit, but I want to see my sister first,” he says.\n\nAlcantara turns left a block ahead and pulls into a rocky, orange-tinged road almost identical to the color of the infield we just saw and finds a spot to leave his car.\n\nHouses with concrete foundations and wooden walls with fiberglass-paneled roofs are spread throughout the area. Most of the houses have wood panels with bars instead of glass windows.\n\nThe area has been fortunate to escape the wrath of major hurricanes that have ravaged neighboring Haiti or other islands in the Caribbean.\n\nThin rows of rust-colored barbed wire separate each property and cordon off areas to grow plants and for pets and roosters to roam. Alcantara points to a patch of land about 40 yards long.\n\n“I own that piece of land,” Alcantara said.\n\nPlay ball\n\nAlcantara stops outside a house with green-colored walls and lets out that same whistle that greeted me back in Santo Domingo.\n\nHis childhood friend and former little league teammate, Ronaldy Hernandez, walks out and gives him a hug and me a handshake. Alcantara tells him to meet us in a little bit at the park.\n\nAs we turn down another path, we reach Alcantara’s sister Aridia’s house.\n\nAridia helped raise Alcantara when they moved to Monte Plata, which gave him a better opportunity to play baseball. His parents stayed in Azua where they had jobs and took care of their other children.\n\nAlcantara took a walk around the neighborhood with his sister to catch up on how she and the family are doing.\n\nAlso waiting for him at the house is his younger sister Yocaira and his niece, Ruth Ester.\n\nAbout a block farther down the path live Camilo Jimenez and Deanny Montero, parents of another of Alcantara’s childhood friends, who used to often let him stay at their place on weekends and took him and their son to their little league games.\n\nThese days, they and Alcantara’s family catch his games when they’re available on TV.\n\n“I always knew Sandy could be a great player one day,” Jimenez said. “My son didn’t end up getting signed to play ball, but he used to always tell me this kid has talent. He was always a helpful kid, too. We’re really proud of him.”\n\nAfter meeting up with Hernandez, it is time for Alcantara to relive his youth — by watching some baseball.\n\nA scene straight out of the Dominican version of “The Sandlot” unfolds before my eyes.\n\nThe kids are playing an intense three-inning game, arguing vehemently over safe or out calls or whose turn it is to bat.\n\nThe kids only have a couple of baseballs at their disposal — including one on which the stitches have come loose and the string whistles through the air whenever they throw it. Each time a ball is hit over the fence, the game comes to a temporary halt as one of the kids runs around the long fence and into a nearby yard to retrieve it.\n\nWhile many of them have gloves, the teams share one aluminum bat. Several players are barefoot or wearing sneakers or sandals instead of cleats.\n\nThe top of the fence separating the field from the adjacent sidewalk is bent in spots from the wear and tear of winds and rain. But the infield is marked clearly enough for a group of 15 to 20 kids to play a game on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nThe outfield is another story, with the grass clearly in need of some groundskeeping. The treacherous turf teaches the kids to react quickly to tough hops when the ball is hit their way.\n\nThe park has a gray-colored outfield wall with distances marked 260 feet to left and right field and 320 to center.\n\nBut it wasn’t always this nice.\n\n“These kids are lucky,” Alcantara said. “You should have seen that park when I was a kid.”\n\nHernandez continues: “That wall wasn’t there. Neither was this sidewalk. If you hit a ball far, you’d have to chase it into the neighborhood to find it.”\n\nAlcantara knows the dream for many of the kids he’s watching on this humble playground is the same one he is still working to fully accomplish.\n\nAlcantara plans to ask the Marlins organization soon about coming to the Dominican Republic to donate baseball gear to these kids.\n\nAs Alcantara approaches the field, a bunch of the kids know him by name and treat him like one of their own — trusting him with what’s at stake in today’s contests, a few Dominican pesos that each player has anted up into the pot. They hand it to Alcantara for safekeeping.\n\nAs he and Hernandez watch from the dugout they once sat in as players, Alcantara gets up and makes a ruling on an out call the kids couldn’t decide.\n\nAlcantara later shares some laughs with the kids as he and Hernandez reminisce.\n\nAlcantara’s same fun-loving personality that he showed when interacting with his son earlier that day manifests in this moment of nostalgia.\n\nMany of his Marlins teammates, like pitcher Pablo Lopez (who matched up against Alcantara in 2016 when both were pitching in the Class A Midwest League), see him act this way all the time in the clubhouse.\n\n“He’s a goof, always messing around,” Lopez said. “If he sees you have a smile on your face, he’ll start goofing around, juggling things or doing stuff to make you laugh. He and I, when we first got called up last year, started talking about the times when I was pitching (in the minors) in Clinton, Iowa, and he was pitching in Peoria (Ill.). This is such a great opportunity for both of us and we just remind each other how we both need to grab on to it and do the best we can.”\n\nBefore we head back to the city, Alcantara visits Jimenez and his wife one more time.\n\nA street vendor on a motorcycle stops by selling empanadas. We buy a few and enjoy an impromptu snack before we hit the road.\n\n“He used to sit right there on that couch and eat the meals I made him,” Montero said. “He was a great kid. Never gave us trouble.”\n\nEscaping poverty\n\nAlcantara knows how monumental the odds are for any of those kids to get a serious opportunity.\n\nThough Azua has produced a few major leaguers over the years, including Philadelphia Phillies third baseman Maikel Franco, Alcantara is the first player to make it to the major leagues from his Monte Plata neighborhood.\n\nBut Alcantara is not taking his major-league status lightly.\n\n“I believe I will earn my spot in the rotation, but I know I still have to work hard to make that happen,” Alcantara said.\n\nAs we head back on the road and leave the neighborhood in the rear view, Alcantara remains quiet for a bit just listening to his music.\n\nAlcantara just bought an apartment for his parents in Santo Domingo.\n\nHe enters the coming season still considered a rookie, having logged only 42 1/3 major-league innings.\n\nAlcantara, who isn’t making much more now than when he first turned pro, could command a salary of at least $500,000 or so by this time next year if he adds a full year of service time and performs well in 2019.\n\nHis goal should this happen is to buy a house for his sister and help move the rest of his family into a better situation.\n\nAlcantara will be back in Jupiter this week with pitchers and catchers due to report officially on Wednesday.\n\nAs he tries to take the next step in his career, Alcantara says his family and what it took to make it this far will remain in his thoughts every time he takes the mound.\n\n“I never forget where I came from,” Alcantara said. “I thank God for the opportunity he has given me to be able to play baseball. Every day. I never take that for granted.”\n\n(Top photo: Scott Taetsch / USA Today)"
