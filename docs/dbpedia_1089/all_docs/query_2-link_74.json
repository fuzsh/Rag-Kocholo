        "text": "People can be so amazing. I love this story. It's nearly impossible to keep up with all that's happening in our world and so often it's gloom and doom. It used to be you could watch the nightly news for 30 minutes and get it all in one quick go. Now, the news cycle is 24/7 and people are doom scrolling to be sure they're not missing anything. But that's a slow drain on your energy and it just feeds stress. It can also feed the feelings of division. It can be hard to quit doom scrolling and some even have greater anxiety when they stop. Instead, might I suggest setting a timer for 30 minutes? When it goes off, pause what you're watching and look for some good news. Not only will that give you a break, but it sets an algorithm so when you go back to watching/listening, your options will include wonderful stories, good news, and maybe even a puppy or two. Take care of yourself and your mental health by balancing and expanding what you are taking in. What we consume - mentally as well as physically - impacts our lives and our health. #mentalhealth #holidaystress #politics #coaching #Christmas #health #news #goodnews\n\nHello Iron Man fans two days ago it was iron birthday was shellhead himself Robert John Downey Jr. born April 4, 1965 an American actor.

My family thinks I‚Äôm strange. But the life lessons in this film don‚Äôt quit. Here are a few of my faves: 1. Comfort = complacency. Dorothy was a leader who, by the end of the film, had made a way for every person in her crew to discover the intrinsic gifts they had yet to claim. But she didn‚Äôt know that because she hadn‚Äôt tested her own limits. Lesson: You have to push yourself. Otherwise, you‚Äôll never know how far you can go. 2. Haters will not only hate; they will also block. The scarecrow, who was strung up on a pole, was not only convinced that he couldn‚Äôt get down, but also that he was not smart. Lies. At almost every turning point in the movie, it was his bright idea that opened a new door or reframed a problem. Lesson: Others will try their hardest to hold you back when they can‚Äôt do what you can do or go where you‚Äôre going. Do your thing and walk your walk anyway, even if inelegantly at first. 3. There are no shortcuts. After Dorothy helped the scarecrow down from the pole, she tried to call a cab to get to The Wiz, but they all drove off. In true brainiac fashion, Scarecrow said, ‚ÄúLooks like we‚Äôre going to have to find our own yellow brick road,‚Äù and brick by brick, the road emerged. (See clip.) Lesson: Don‚Äôt be dismayed when the path seems unclear. Take one step at a time. One step becomes a stride. Each stride a stretch. And the stretches open to a world of possibilities. This is only thirty minutes or so into the movie. I could go to 50. Not kidding. If you‚Äôve watched it, what are your favorite life lessons? #lifeadvice #lifelessons #sundaythoughts #wearethewaymakers #betheway #movies #thewiz #quincyjones Universal Pictures"
