        "text": "In the Palais d’Egmont in Brussels, Belgium, the General Council of the newly formed League Against Imperialism (LAI) crowded together for a photograph (Figure 1). They were just a few of the 170 delegates from thirty-seven countries at the Congress against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism and for National Independence, held February 10–15, 1927 (Louro Reference Louro2018, 34).Footnote 1 In the photo appear many of the twentieth century’s foremost anticolonial activists, like India’s Jawaharlal Nehru and Indonesia’s Mohammad Hatta. Although their presence frequently goes unmentioned, several Latin Americans stand in the back row: Cuban activist Julio Antonio Mella, general secretary for the Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas (Liga Antimperialista de las Américas, LADLA); Mexican intellectual José Vasconcelos; Italian Argentine communist Victorio Codovilla; and Manuel Gomez (no accent), the non–Latin American US citizen representing LADLA’s US section.Footnote 2 These and other Latin Americans participated in the discussions in Brussels and subsequent LAI meetings. LADLA, designated in Brussels as the LAI’s Latin American Bureau, was particularly well represented. However, because most scholarship on the LAI focuses on the history of Afro-Asian collaborations, it has tended to neglect LADLA’s involvement.Footnote 3\n\nThis article revisits LADLA to better understand how intellectuals from the Americas were influenced by anticolonial thinkers from elsewhere and to emphasize the role of Latin American thinkers in the LAI’s global history. In doing so, it draws from LADLA’s periodical El Libertador, letters exchanged among LADLA leaders, and speeches and resolutions from the LAI archive. The 1927 Brussels Congress, which founded the LAI, is recognized for its unprecedented historical significance. It is often described as the forerunner to the 1955 Bandung Conference of African and Asian nations, frequently cited as a foundational moment for the development of postcolonial thought (Dinkel Reference Dinkel2018; Weiss Reference Weiss2013). Centering LADLA’s involvement in the LAI helps reframe this early history of postcolonial thought, which has overwhelmingly focused on the enduring legacies of European colonialism in Africa and Asia.Footnote 4\n\nExisting scholarship exclusively focused on LADLA relies on archival sources and newspapers in Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba (Kersffeld Reference Kersffeld2012; Melgar Bao Reference Melgar Bao2000, Reference Melgar Bao2008).Footnote 5 However, LADLA had an explicitly hemispheric vision, maintaining an active section (and several subsections) in the United States and collaborating with US citizens, especially Jewish and Black activists. This article brings the personal papers of LADLA-US activists into conversation with Latin American materials. Although LADLA-US consistently translated the organization’s name as the “All-America Anti-Imperialist League,” I use the more direct translation (the Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas), as it better captures LADLA’s hemispheric imagination.Footnote 6\n\nIf studies of the LAI often overlook LADLA’s involvement, scholarship on Latin American radicalism, with some exceptions, tends to have a regional focus that does not frame these activists in the global milieus that they inhabited.Footnote 7 This is especially the case regarding the interwar period, characterized by the emergence of Latin America’s regionalist ideologies. In response to post–World War I disillusionment with Western Europe and the increasing dominance of the United States, interwar Latin American writers and political figures defined Latin America through ideologies like hispanoamericanismo, indoamericanismo, mestizaje, and indigenismo. Latin Americans’ participation in the Brussels Congress has been characterized as reinforcing such regionalist ideologies, representing a failure to “enhance mutual understanding between Latin Americans and the anticolonialists from Asia and Africa” (Goebel Reference Goebel2015, 206). This understanding draws from the perspectives of a few prominent Latin American congress participants, especially José Vasconcelos. However, as I argue, the views of LADLA, representing more than one-third of Latin American delegates, differed sharply from those of Vasconcelos.\n\nA closer look at LADLA nuances our understanding of interwar Latin American intellectual history. Contrary to the regionalist lens through which Latin American participation in the Brussels Congress has been understood (Goebel Reference Goebel2015, Reference Goebel, Louro, Stolte, Streets-Salter and Tannoury-Karam2020; Lindner Reference Lindner2023; Prashad Reference Prashad2007), this article argues that LADLA members rejected interwar regionalisms for what I describe as a hemispheric globalism, wherein LADLA expanded on its initially hemispheric connections with US worker and minority struggles to embrace interdependency with anti-imperialist movements around the world.Footnote 8 During the Brussels Congress, LADLA began to clearly differentiate its platform from Latin American regionalisms, including the perspectives of two of the foremost thinkers of such regionalist ideologies: Vasconcelos and Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre.\n\nIf the congress offered LADLA organizers the chance to see more clearly the connections between their struggles and those of other colonial contexts, it also helped them draw connections with non-Spanish-speaking communities that were closer geographically, like African Americans and activists from the francophone and anglophone Caribbeans. LADLA’s global perspective enhanced its hemispheric connections and vice versa. The encounters in Brussels, I maintain, began a process of expanding LADLA’s initial focus on Indigenous struggles to think more critically about Black communities in the Americas. This influenced LADLA’s eventual theorization of white supremacy as an integral part of imperialist domination, which became a defining aspect of LADLA’s worldview."
