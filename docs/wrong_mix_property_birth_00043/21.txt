Fresh off their third U.S. Open championship and ninth career Grand Slam title, the all-time winningest men’s doubles team and world’s No. 1, Bob and Mike Bryan, will be joined by top-25 players Mardy Fish and Sam Querrey at the K-Swiss All-Star Tennis Fest and Wine Tasting on Sat., Sept. 25 at Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo.

The Bryans of Camarillo and their foundation recently announced they would award a $5,000 grant to both the Ventura County Junior Tennis Association and the Santa Barbara Tennis Patrons to financially assist a promising junior player from each area.

“Both the VCJTA and the Santa Barbara Tennis Patrons tournaments and programs were where Mike and Bob were first able to spread their wings as juniors,” said the twins’ father, Wayne Bryan.

“Now they want to give back and would like to provide a deserving junior the same opportunity they had.”

Querrey is a Thousand Oaks High graduate.

Saturday’s events begin at 1 p.m. with a pro-am, wine tasting and pro exhibition.

General seating tickets are available for $100, and VIP tables start at $500. Tickets can be purchased at www.bbtennisfest.com or by e-mailing Dave McKinney at dave@bbtennisfest.com.
