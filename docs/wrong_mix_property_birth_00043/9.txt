The Bryan Bros. Tennis Fest is returning to Southern California as the all-time winningest doubles team in tennis history, Mike and Bob Bryan, will again host the popular fundraiser that gives back to the Ventura County community where the twins grew up.

The Bryan Bros. Tennis Fest is set for Sunday at 3 p.m. at Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo. Mike and Bob will be joined by former U.S. Davis Cup teammate James Blake and Thousand Oaks High graduate Sam Querrey. All four American pros will take part in a Pro Doubles Exhibition in the headlining event of the day, which concludes with a concert performance by the Bryan Bros. Band.

Individual tickets are on sale for $125 (children under 18 are $50) and can be purchased at www.BryanBrosTennisFest.com. The event will feature wine and food tasting, a live auction, pro-am, and the performance by the Bryan Bros. Band.

The event has raised more than $1.2 million for the Bryan Bros. Foundation to benefit the Ventura County Junior Tennis Association, the Santa Barbara Tennis Patrons and many other local children's charities.

The Bryan Bros. Foundation, a nonprofit 501c3 organization, is dedicated to helping support and grow the dreams of children in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, in Southern California and across the U.S. and around the world.
