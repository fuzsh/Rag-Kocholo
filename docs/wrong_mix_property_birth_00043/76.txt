The Bryan Bros. Foundation raised over $100,000 at the annual V-Grid Tennis Fest featuring twins Mike and Bob Bryan and presented by Alexander Cadillac and Esurance last month.

The doubles duo, along with Victoria Azarenka and other friends, presented $16,000 checks to the Ventura County Junior Tennis Association, Santa Barbara Tennis Patrons, Boys & Girls Club of Camarillo and the Oaks Christian High School tennis program.

The foundation will distribute the remaining funds to other deserving groups throughout the year.

In a main exhibition mixeddoubles match, former French Open champions Bob Bryan and Azarenka beat Mike Bryan and Las Vegas’ Kimberly Yee, 6-2.

Other pros included Justin Gimelstob, Jeff Tarango and Hank Pfister, and junior exhibitions featured the VCJTA All- Stars against the SBTP All-Stars as well as the Las Vegas Team Bryan juniors vs. the CIF-SS Division III Oaks Christian High team. Curtis Wright of Minneapolis, Minn., won the Pro-Am Tournament, while Trevor Short of Atlanta was second and Harold Edwards of Santa Paula was third.

Over 800 people attended the event, which was hosted at the Spanish Hills Country Club and emceed by the twins’ father, Wayne Bryan. The day concluded with the Bryan Bros. Band entertaining the crowd.
