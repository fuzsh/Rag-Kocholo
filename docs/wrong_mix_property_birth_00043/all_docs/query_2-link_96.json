world-renowned reputation and a role as an international quaternary referral center. Patients with serious medical conditions come here for some of the most complex surgical procedures performed in the world. In this extraordinary clinical environment, our residents routinely manage some of the most challenging cases that anesthesiology has to offer, all while enjoying a broad experience in all aspects of perioperative medicine.\n\nClinical base year (PGY-1)\n\nThe Anesthesiology Institute is proud to sponsor a comprehensive and unique Clinical Base Year (CBY), specifically designed to prepare first year residents for advanced training in our anesthesiology residency. The CBY is comprised of 13 four-week modules of training, including experiences through the following areas:\n\nPerioperative medicine.\n\nHospital internal medicine.\n\nNeuro ICU.\n\nEndocrinology.\n\nChronic pain recovery.\n\nNephology.\n\nCardiology.\n\nPulmonary medicine.\n\nAcute pain management and regional anesthesia.\n\nAdult surgical critical care.\n\nCardiovascular and thoracic surgical critical care.\n\nEmergency medicine.\n\nThe CBY includes four months of General Anesthesia including a gradual two-month orientation process. During this period, the basics of anesthesia are taught in the classroom, OR and simulation settings. In a “boot camp” setting, our residents experience selected common and uncommon anesthesia crises, in a supervised and safe environment.\n\nAll scheduling, advising and evaluation for the internship is controlled by the Anesthesiology Institute. In addition to a broad clinical experience, this internship prepares the first-year resident for a smooth entry into the CA-1 year. Regular participation in anesthesiology conferences and activities makes the CBY resident a full participant in the Anesthesiology Institute. In our program, your residency in anesthesiology starts on day one.\n\nCA-1 year\n\nIn the CA-1 year, residents build on the concepts and skills introduced in the CBY and continue to administer anesthesia using a wide variety of techniques for the main general anesthesia surgical areas. Residents will complete anesthesia rotations dedicated to surgical subspecialties including orthopedics, neurosurgery, ENT, urology, and plastic surgery.\n\nAdditionally, the CA-1 resident will have additional critical care exposure in both our 30-bed Surgical ICU and 95-bed Cardiovascular ICU, both of which are managed by the Anesthesiology Institute. This gives the residents the opportunity to help manage complex and acute critically ill patients encountered here, where technologies for advanced cardiovascular support are commonplace, second to none.\n\nThe CA-1 residents spend some time in our newly remodeled pre-anesthesia, allowing for a comprehensive preoperative patient evaluation and the initiation of multiple perioperative ERAS protocols.\n\nDuring the postoperative anesthesia care unit rotation, the residents have the opportunity to manage postoperative complex patients from multiple surgical subspecialties, allowing them to understand the continuum of perioperative care.\n\nCA-2 year\n\nAfter intense exposure to the fundamentals of Anesthesiology during the CBY and CA-1 years, the CA-2 year introduces residents to the more complex anesthesia sub-specialties, these include great experiences in an advanced anesthesia practice setting.\n\nOur Neurosurgical experience involves the management of a broad range of case complexities, from simple spine procedures to complex awake craniotomies. Being one of the largest stroke centers in Northeast Ohio, our residents get to experience acute neurosurgical emergencies, giving them the opportunity to solidify their management strategies. As we are getting ready to welcome our brand new state of the art Neurological Institute building, we are looking forward to enhancing our neuroanesthesia experience in 12 brand new ORs being built for us.\n\nOur residency program’s cardiac and thoracic anesthesiology rotations are world class. Cleveland Clinic has been recognized as the number 1 hospital by US News and World Report for 29 consecutive years for cardiac care. During the residents’ rotations through the cardiac ORs they have the opportunity to work with world-class surgeons and anesthesiologists performing the most complex and challenging surgical procedures. Residents witness the most vanguard techniques in cardiac and thoracic surgery, allowing them to be excellently prepared in this very challenging area of anesthesia.\n\nResidents will also gain additional experience in the management of difficult airways during a special module dedicated to ENT anesthesia, where a step-wise milestone and procedure-based curriculum enhances resident exposure to simple and complex airway management techniques.\n\nAdditional exposure to obstetric and regional anesthesia provides a longitudinal learning experience that helps solidify the residents’ knowledge in these sub-specialties.\n\nOur pediatric anesthesia experience is quite comprehensive. From complex congenital cardiac surgery to a simple adenoidectomy, the CA-2 pediatric anesthesia rotation prepares our residents to manage pediatric cases.\n\nWith over 200 liver transplants per year, our CA-2 anesthesiology residents have a great exposure to these very complex cases as they have the opportunity to cover liver call throughout this academic year. This allows our residents to effectively learn the management of these complex cases, and enhance their transfusion and intraoperative critical management strategies.\n\nCA-3 year\n\nThe CA-3 year provides the senior resident with a wealth of opportunities to fine-tune their clinical and leadership skills, while providing anesthesia and intensive care with significant autonomy to some of our sickest patients. Our CA-3 residents rotate through anesthesia subspecialty areas giving them the opportunity to solidify their management strategies. We have found that additional time in obstetric anesthesia, pediatric anesthesia, cardiac anesthesia and critical care are of great benefit.\n\nWhile in the cardiac ORs, our residents rotate for a dedicated transesophageal echo module, where their primary responsibility is to learn this skill. Many of our residents pursue basic TEE certification or get an important head start in their TEE knowledge as they move on to fellowships where this skill is required.\n\nDuring the months assigned to the general ORs, the CA-3 residents direct the overnight and weekend call teams and learn how to efficiently utilize OR resources and anesthesia personnel by working at the anesthesia control desk, giving them invaluable on-the-job experience in personnel, time and resource management.\n\nWe also offer elective rotations at several of Cleveland Clinic’s regional facilities, including Hillcrest, Fairview and Lutheran Hospitals, where our residents have access to a community and private practice feel for anesthesiology, engaging in experiences that enhance their autonomy, supervisory skills as well as their regional anesthesia practice. Most recently, we have introduced options to perform elective rotations in our London hospital and our Abu Dhabi hospital. In addition, we have created an elective rotation at Akron General Hospital, one of the main trauma centers in the region, to provide our residents with this invaluable trauma experience.\n\nAs part of one of the largest pain practices in the country, our residents’ rotations through our chronic pain clinics enhance their understanding of the multiple different invasive and non-invasive strategies for chronic pain management, as well as perioperative management of this very complex patient population. As part of the CA-3 electives, our residents have the opportunity to work in a community-based chronic pain practice, where they gain experience and manage complex pain patients with adequate supervision.\n\nFinally, our CA-3 residents have the option to take elective time for advanced clinical research (up to six months) for scholarly purposes.\n\nApproximate annual surgical volume\n\nAs a world-class institution, with a target on innovation and patient safety, Cleveland Clinic’s different surgical services encompass a huge gamut of surgeries and procedures. This allows our anesthesiology residents to be exposed to a wide range of surgeries, from the most common elective ones, to complex and experimental procedures. Our residents are part of the care team, hand in hand with anesthesiology leaders in multiple surgical sub-specialties, creating an environment of learning and discovery.\n\nHere are some numbers that reflect the annual vast surgical experience at Cleveland Clinic’s main surgical ORs:\n\n60,448 total surgical procedures.\n\n17,936 ambulatory surgical cases.\n\n10,651 pediatric procedures.\n\n8,216 cardiac procedures.\n\n713 pediatric cardiac procedures.\n\n1,192 thoracotomies.\n\n141 critical care beds (SICU and CVICU).\n\n9,574 acute pain patients.\n\n2,317 new chronic pain patients.\n\n8,979 chronic pain procedures.\n\n53 heart transplants.\n\n133 lung transplants.\n\n174 kidney transplants.\n\n190 liver transplants.\n\n8,488 deliveries.\n\n6,588 major orthopedic procedures.\n\n766 major spine cases.\n\n4,518 neurosurgical procedures.\n\n2,346 vascular procedures.\n\nOur resident’s critical care exposure is enriched by the complexity of our patients, as well as the diverse settings where this care happens, from a dedicated liver transplant ICU to a unit dedicated to cardio-pulmonary mechanical assist devices and transplantation. The care that our residents provide these patients enriches their anesthesiology education, communication skills and team effectively.\n\nCurriculum and Training\n\nCurriculum and Training\n\nThe Anesthesiology Institute's didactic curriculum component of the residency is matched in intensity and scope to the clinical experience, with the goal of providing diverse opportunities each week for residents and faculty alike to interact and enhance learning. Conferences and educational activities are designed to be challenging to residents, specific for their level of training.\n\nDidactics\n\nAnesthesiology Institute Grand Rounds are weekly Institute-wide topic presentations given by faculty, residents, or renowned national and international leaders in the field as part of our Visiting Professor Lecture Series. Our M&Ms are held during Wednesday mornings on a protected time slot, on a weekly basis.\n\nThursday Education Half Day each resident class, from CBY through CA-3, are relieved from all clinical duties to attend educational activities on topics ranging from basic pharmacology and physiology to complex sub-specialty material.\n\nCurriculum is geared towards ABA Keywords and preparation for both parts of the ABA Board Exam as well as the annual In-training Examination (ITE) and Anesthesia Knowledge Test (AKT).\n\nWe embrace a learner-centered, interactive approach using problem-based learning, case-based learning, crisis resource discussions, simulation scenarios, interactive case discussions and faculty-moderated resident-led presentations.\n\nFaculty-led special topic and sub-specialty review sessions occur on a monthly basis.\n\nOutcomes Research Weekly Lecture Series - an optional lecture series for interested residents and fellows, dedicated to basic and advanced clinical research training, with special emphasis on research design, statistics, ethics, manuscript writing, and presentation. Lectures given by Outcomes Research Faculty - some of the most highly regarded and published leaders in Anesthesia research.\n\nJournal Clubs are held monthly throughout the year, addressing important and relevant topics of the ever-changing aspects of anesthesiology.\n\nSub-specialty rotation-based lectures, including lecture series for residents on critical care, cardiothoracic anesthesia, obstetric anesthesia, pediatric anesthesia, etc. These are discussed during the resident’s specific rotations, in small group settings.\n\nMock Orals are provided twice a year by faculty members, several of whom are ABA Board Examiners. This experience is enhanced in the CA-3 year, helping our residents to prepare for this component of the ABA Applied exam.\n\nOSCE (Objective Structured Clinical Exams) experience is provided for our CA-1, CA-2 and CA-3 residents to assist with preparation for the ABA Applied exam.\n\nSimulation\n\nAnesthesiology residents have access to over 59,000 square feet of some of the most cutting-edge simulation space in the world. Utilizing responsible practices, we have been able to re-start our simulation activities.\n\nMultidisciplinary Simulation Center - focused on both individual and team-based learning, this center features a fully functional ICU and operating room, complete with the same equipment and capabilities found elsewhere in the hospital. The center is equipped with:\n\nA wide variety of task and procedural-based simulators.\n\nMultiple infant, child, obstetric and adult human high-fidelity patient simulators.\n\nState-of-the-art audiovisual recording and assessment system.\n\nOur didactic curriculum is enriched with a strong high-fidelity simulation foundation, with cases that have a progressive increase in complexity, exposing our residents to the bases of all areas of crisis resource management, situational awareness and effective teamwork, both at the main simulation center and at the bedside in different in-situ locations.\n\nThese are some of the topics we address in our simulation sessions:\n\nCentral and peripheral IV and arterial access practice workshops.\n\nNeuraxial anesthesia workshops.\n\nPeripheral nerve blocks.\n\nTransthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography simulation.\n\nComplex anesthesia crisis and emergencies.\n\nObstetric emergencies.\n\nVascular surgery emergencies.\n\nNeurosurgical emergencies.\n\nENT emergencies.\n\nRegional anesthesia complications.\n\nPACU/ICU emergencies.\n\nCrisis management.\n\nTeam communication.\n\nThe Debra Ann November Pediatric Airway and Pulmonary Mechanics Lab - a technologically advanced simulation lab dedicated to the complexities and unique challenges presented by the pediatric airway.

I eventually moved to Cleveland and enrolled in the Cleveland Clinic’s Anesthesiology Residency Program and Adult Cardiothoracic Anesthesiology Fellowship. I have been working as staff for both the general and cardiothoracic anesthesiology departments since then. I have always had a passion for medical education, and this led me to enroll and complete a Masters in Healthcare Professions Education from Cleveland State University/Cleveland Clinic.\n\nMy passion for medical education and especially simulation-based medical education; made me pursue Certification in Healthcare Simulation Education (CHSE) and recognition for the Cleveland Clinic’s Simulation center from the American Society of Anesthesiologists.\n\nWhen I am not thinking about medical education, I am probably planning my next trip, I really enjoy international travel, fitness, looking for new hikes to go explore the outdoors, new restaurants here in Cleveland and venturing in my own Italian cooking.\n\nSandeep Khanna, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nI serve as the Associate Program Director and divide my time between the Departments of General Anesthesia and Cardiothoracic Anesthesia. After completing my residency training, I pursued fellowships in Cardiothoracic Anesthesia and Medical Education. My research interests include airway management, perioperative hemodynamics and liver transplant anesthesia. I love playing tennis and hanging out with my family. Our favorite activities include outdoor biking, watching movies and impromptu dancing.\n\nSamantha Stamper, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nI was born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. I received my Bachelor of Science in Forensic Chemistry at West Virginia University.

I just completed my Masters in Healthcare Professions Education from Cleveland State University/Cleveland Clinic.\n\nFrom a clinical standpoint, I split my time between general anesthesia, our acute pain management service. I love my role as Assistant Program Director because I feel that in addition to excellent patient care, education is at the heart of everything we do. Outside the hospital I love spending time with my dog, my family, and watching any and all of Pittsburgh’s sporting events.\n\nMariel Manlapaz, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nI was born in the Philippines and lived in Manila until 13 years old. My family immigrated to California, and I ended up at Stanford University where I not only obtained my Bachelors in Biological Science, but I also met my husband. After a brief stint at Chiron as a research associate, I went to medical school at University of California Irvine. Much to my chagrin, I moved to Cleveland to do my anesthesia residency and cardiothoracic fellowship, since my husband had already matched here for his residency. To my surprise, I loved being at the Clinic, and Cleveland has become our home where our three boys have flourished.\n\nCurrently I specialize in neuro-anesthesia and liver transplants. In addition to my role as associate residency program director, I am also the director of the Perioperative Medicine Anesthesia Fellowship. I am very interested in how adult learners learn and am currently finishing my Masters in Education for Health Professions Education. I am looking forward to leveraging my new found knowledge and experience to help residents reach their full potential.\n\nOutside of medicine, my husband and I love experiencing and learning about other cultures and ways of life. We have taken our boys all over the world and have had amazing adventures and have met many wonderful people!\n\nAvneep Aggarwal, MD\n\nAssociate Program Director\n\nI serve as an Associate Program Director and divide my time between the Departments of General Anesthesia and Department of Intensive care and resuscitation. After completing my residency training, I pursued a fellowship in Anesthesiology Critical Care Medicine. My true passion lies in educating and training the next generation of future anesthesiologists. I am the Director of the medical student rotation in the surgical intensive care unit and the Director of the Virtual Critical Care Rounds series for the residents. Serving as a mentor at various stages of medical education brings me immense satisfaction as I get to observe students' development into residents and fellows, many of whom eventually become my colleagues. My areas of expertise encompass perioperative critical care and graduate medical education, with a particular focus on simulation-based medical education. Beyond the hospital, I enjoy quality time with my family and indulge in reading about behavioral economics, human behavior, and decision-making.\n\nMaged Argalious, MD, MBA, MSc, MEd, FASA, FASE\n\nVice Chair of Education\n\nI serve as Vice Chair for Education for the Anesthesiology Institute and as Chair of the department of General Anesthesiology. I served as the Associate Program Director for our residency program from 2007 to 2013 and as the residency program director from 2013 to 2019. I value feedback (both giving and receiving) as an essential influence on learning and am a big fan of the Kolb’s experiential learning theory. My subspecialty areas of interest are anesthesia for liver and multivisceral transplant, vascular anesthesia, and perioperative medicine. I enjoy playing tennis, watching European soccer, and working alongside a phenomenal and dedicated education team.\n\nResident Life\n\nResident Life\n\nA Message from our Chief Residents\n\nWelcome and thank you for your interest in the Cleveland Clinic’s Anesthesiology Residency Program! We are so proud of the complexity and depth of the cases at our program and are happy to be able to learn from some of the best Anesthesiologists in the country. We truly believe this is the best place to learn to become a World-Class Anesthesiologist, and can’t wait to meet you and share more about our fantastic program.\n\nTraining and curriculum\n\nWe provide a unique Clinical Base Year (PGY-1) that offers six months of anesthesia training throughout the intern year. Our staff presents lectures that focus on key topics for the ABA Basic and Advanced exams. These lectures are given during protected academic time on Thursdays when residents are relieved of their clinical duties to attend these lectures. In addition, our program provides weekly grand rounds, simulation activities, practice OSCEs, and semi-annual mock oral boards. Within our department, research is encouraged but not required for our residents. For those who wish to pursue research, our program works closely with the Outcomes Research Department which is the largest anesthesiology research group in the nation. This department provides guidance and resources for our residents to achieve their research goals.\n\nThe strength of our program is the diverse and complex clinical case exposure. The main facility includes more than eighty cardiac, thoracic, vascular, pediatric, and general ORs. Cleveland Clinic attracts medically complex patients worldwide and gives our residents the opportunity to care for a diverse patient population. Our residents gain exposure to a wide variety of surgical cases including but not limited to liver, kidney, small bowel, heart, and lung transplants, as well as complex heart and vascular cases. The “Cleveland Clinic Experience” gives our residents the confidence to handle any clinical scenario with ease and expertise upon completion of residency.\n\nYe Rin, Sean, Garrett, and Forrest.\n\nA day in the life of our residents\n\nResearch Opportunities & Conferences\n\nResearch Opportunities & Conferences\n\nCleveland Clinic's Center for Anesthesiology Education and the Anesthesiology Institute are committed to the continual growth of the knowledge base of anesthesia. To support this endeavor, we actively encourage our residents to take part in quality clinical research as a part of their four years of training.\n\nSpearheading our research program is the Department of Outcomes Research, the clinical research arm of the Anesthesiology Institute. This team of world-renowned researchers, clinicians and statisticians is working on clinical research to improve patient outcomes. The department also serves as the administrative center for the international Outcomes Research Consortium, a group of more than 110 clinical investigators, spread across four continents and arguably the world's largest clinical anesthesia research organization.\n\nIn addition, within the Anesthesiology Institute, we have a resident research committee comprising of staff and two resident research coordinators. The role of the resident research coordinator is pivotal in connecting interested residents with appropriate research mentors. In addition, the research coordinators help coordinate the activities of Annual Anesthesiology Institute Research Day, which serves as a platform to present and recognize high-quality research projects conducted by residents and fellows with the guidance of their staff mentors.\n\nGetting involved with research as a resident\n\nEvery resident is given ample opportunity to get involved with clinical research at an early stage, starting in the clinical base year. The Department of Outcomes Research offers the \"Fundamentals of Clinical Research\" lecture series to all residents throughout their training. This is a certification course conducted every year that focuses on the basics of research methodology and statistical tests, with emphasis on conducting ethical and clinically relevant research. Interested residents can also approach either of the two research coordinators who can then put them in contact with research mentors with ongoing or future research projects.\n\nWe also maintain a database that keeps track of all the major research projects throughout our Anesthesiology Institute. This allows us to identify research opportunities for our residents and ensure that they have quality research projects to work on.\n\nIn addition, residents can also avail up to six months of dedicated research time as an elective during CA-3 year in accordance with current ACGME guidelines. Cleveland Clinic is an active member of the MPOG Outcomes group, giving our resident access a database comprised of over 12 million cases, which can be analyzed for research purposes.\n\nAnesthesiologists in charge of resident research\n\nAlparsalan Turan, MD.\n\nEhab Farag, MD, FRCA.\n\nResident Research Coordinators\n\nMauro Bravo, MD.\n\nStephania Paredes Padilla, MD.\n\nMeeting attendance and presentations\n\nThe Anesthesiology Institute encourages and supports residents to attend all major national and regional anesthesia meetings. As per Institute policy, every resident will be able to attend one national and one regional meeting along with the OSA (Ohio Society of Anesthesiologist) meeting every academic year. Specifically, the Institute supports attendance to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA National Meeting) and the Midwest Anesthesia Residents Conference (MARC Regional Meeting). We encourage our residents to share the complexity of their anesthesiology experience by actively participating and presenting posters, as well as oral presentations. This gives our residents the opportunity to enhance their communication and presentation skills as we prepare them to further their academic careers.\n\nIn order to meet the academic milestones of the residency program for graduation, residents are required to either publish at least one peer-reviewed article or submit and present at least one abstract at a regional or national meeting during their four years of training.\n\nRelated resources\n\nOutcomes Research Consortium.\n\nCollaborative Institutional Training Initiative.\n\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA).\n\nThe Ohio Society of Anesthesiologists.\n\nResources\n\nResources\n\nTraining at Cleveland Clinic\n\nWe invite you to explore our Graduate Medical Education website to discover the reasons why Cleveland Clinic offers an ideal teaching and learning environment as well as to learn more about our rich tradition of excellence in the “education of those who serve.”\n\nAbout Cleveland\n\nFrom renowned cultural institutions to vibrant neighborhoods, inspired food and beverage offerings, action-packed sports and indie shops and art galleries, engaging experiences can be found around almost every corner in Cleveland.
