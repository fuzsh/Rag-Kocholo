        "text": "Bryans Score Delray Beach Hat-Trick and #94 All-Time\n\nTop seeds Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan claimed a hat-trick of titles at the Delray Beach on Sunday as they defeated Frantisek Cermak and Mikhail Elgin 6-2, 6-3 in the final. The Bryans prevailed in 54 minutes, winning 77 percent of their service points and breaking their opponents three times.\n\nThe Americans were congratulated afterwards by legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus, a winner of 18 major trophies. The brothers added to the Delray Beach trophies they had lifted in 2009 (d. Melo/Sa) and 2010 (d. Marx/Zelenay).\n\n\"Jack Nicklaus is a good friend,\" said Mike Bryan. \"He's been to watch us at Wimbledon a few times. He loves tennis. Bob won his celebrity charity tournament last year. He's a great, great guy to know. We're huge fans of his. It was good to see him in the front row.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old twins captured their 94th tour-level doubles crown together and first of the season. They finished runners-up last week in Memphis. The twins have a 94-49 record in finals.\n\n\"100 titles is our next big goal,\" saidBob. \"We're very happy to kick start the year here in Delray. Get that first title of the season, get that confidence flowing and take it into the next couple of Masters 1000s. It's been a few years since we won the Miami tournament, so we want to put in a good showing there.\n\n\"We've always had good Australias; it's always been an incredible start of the year there. This was the first year we came back with nothing to show for our hard work in the off-season. Now it's starting to pay off a little bit, we're starting to hit our stride.\"\n\n\"We never thought we'd get this high,\" addedMike. \"We always were shooting for the Woodies' number. Then when we finally hit 61 titles we took off. The pressure was released and we've had a couple of big years. Last year was the best year we've ever had with a record of 70-13, 11 titles, including three Grand Slams and 5 Masters Series Events. To hit triple digits and 100 would be very special.\"\n\nBy ATP Staff, Feb. 23, 2014\n\nFast Facts:\n\n*** The Bros. lost only 12 games at Delray Beach this past week and their wins included: Adrian Mannarino (France)-Michael Russell (USA), 6-1, 6-3; Ryan Harrison-Jack Sock (USA), 6-2, 6-1; and FrantisekCermak (Czech Republic)-Mikhail Elgin (Russia)6-2, 6-3.\n\n*** Last week Mike ‘n Bob reached the Memphis Final with wins over: DavidO'Hare(Ireland)- JoeSalisbury(Great Britain), 6-4, 6-3; ChrisGuccione-LleytonHewitt(Australia), 6-3, 7-6(0); and SantiagoGonzalez(Mexico)-ScottLipsky(USA) 6-3, 6-7(2), 10-6.\n\n*** Delray Beach was the Bros. 94th Doubles Championship, an all-time record.
