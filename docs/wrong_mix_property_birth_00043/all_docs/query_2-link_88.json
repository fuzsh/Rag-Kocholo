        "text": "School is almost back in session. The New England Patriots are roughly one week out from the start of training camp with rookies slated to report on Friday, July 19, veterans reporting on July 23, and the first practice open to the public set for July 24. And then it's a mad dash to the regular season.\n\nThis is a rather remarkable time in the franchise's history. For the first time in over two decades, New England is entering training camp without Bill Belichick running the show. Now, Jerod Mayo has taken the reins as the organization's newest head coach and he'll look to get the arrow pointing back up in a positive trajectory after a 4-13 season. He'll do that alongside No. 3 overall pick Drake Maye, who'll be a fascinating camp storyline in his own right as the young quarterback pushes to start out of the gate.\n\nNo matter if it's Maye or Jacoby Brissett who is under center when they kick off the year in Cincinnati on Sept. 8 these next few weeks and months are critical for New England to set a foundation to get the franchise back on track.\n\nWith that in mind, let's get you up to date on everything you need to know surrounding the start of Patriots training camp.\n\nTraining camp dates\n\nDayDateTime\n\nWednesday\n\nJuly 24\n\n11 a.m. ET\n\nThursday\n\nJuly 25\n\n11 a.m. ET\n\nFriday\n\nJuly 26\n\n11 a.m. ET\n\nSunday\n\nJuly 28\n\n11 a.m. ET\n\nMondayJuly 2911 a.m. ETTuesdayJuly 3011 a.m. ETThursdayAug. 111 a.m. ETFridayAug. 211 a.m. ETSaturdayAug. 311 a.m. ETMondayAug. 511 a.m. ETTuesdayAug. 611 a.m. ETMondayAug. 1211 a.m. ET**TuesdayAug. 1311 a.m. ET\n\n** -- Joint practice with the Philadelphia Eagles\n\nKey roster changes\n\n2024 NFL Draft class\n\nFree agents/trades\n\nAdditionsLosses\n\nQB Jacoby Brissett\n\nQB Mac Jones\n\nOT Chukwuma Okorafor\n\nOT Trent Brown\n\nRB Antonio Gibson\n\nRB Ezekiel Elliott\n\nLB Sione Takitaki\n\nTE Mike Gesicki\n\nTE Austin Hooper\n\nS Jalen Mills\n\nDT Armon WattsLB Mack Wilson Sr.OL Nick LeverettST Matthew Slater (retired)WR K.J.

Throughout the spring, Jacoby Brissett was the clear starter getting the majority (if not all) of the first-team reps. Maye began as the third quarterback up in drills but did seemingly climb up the depth chart as he finished minicamp as New England's No. 2 quarterback after jumping over Bailey Zappe. It'll be interesting to see if he can carry that momentum into camp and truly push Brissett.\n\nWill Matthew Judon report to camp?\n\nThe Patriots have made it a priority this offseason to retain a large contingent of its players, inking several veterans to extensions. However, pass rusher Matthew Judon -- who is entering the final year of his current contract -- was on the outside looking in on that barrage of extensions. That begs the question of whether or not Judon is long for Foxborough, especially after some cryptic social media activity throughout the break. Judon was present for mandatory minicamp, so a fully-fledged holdout may not be in the cards but it'll be curious to see if there is a \"hold-in\" situation that unfolds if they can't reach a new deal.\n\nThe post-Bill Belichick era\n\nAs we noted in the intro, it's a new day in New England with Bill Belichick out and Jerod Mayo in. How the Patriots operate in this new era will be a storyline that will be dissected throughout the year, but the initial steps will continue here at training camp. Of course, Mayo is a Belichick disciple as he played and coached under the legendary coach, so there is likely going to be a solid amount of carryover sprinkled in with his own style. How all that translates as he becomes a first-year head coach will be worth monitoring.\n\nPlayers to watch\n\nQB Drake Maye: Maye is the highest-drafted player the Patriots have had since selecting Drew Bledsoe No. 1 overall back in 1993. Given where he was picked and the position he plays, every move he makes will be front-page news.\n\nRB JaMycal Hasty: While there will naturally be attention paid to free-agent addition Antonio Gibson at camp, Hasty saw plenty of reps throughout the spring, which makes me curious about his usage as the Patriots open up camp. The 27-year-old was claimed by New England off waives in mid-November of last year and could prove to be a passing down option in Alex Van Pelt's offense.\n\nOT Caedan Wallace: New England selected Wallace in the third round of the draft this spring out of Penn State. The 6-foot-5, 313-pounder does have the size to be a starting caliber tackle at the next level, but it's questions about switching sides of the line that are worth keeping an eye on. Wallace played right tackle in college, but the Patriots need someone to man the left side. If the Patriots decide to move him over and he succeeds, it's a massive development in this rebuild.\n\nCB Christian Gonzalez: Don't forget about Christian Gonzalez! New England's 2023 first-round pick certainly looked the part of a shutdown corner in his brief showing last season. He played just four games (all starts) before going down with a season-ending shoulder injury but flashed brilliance. As he bounces back, the 22-year-old could prove to be an anchor within Mayo's defense.\n\nWR JuJu Smith-Schuster: Smith-Schuster is a recognizable name on a national stage, so it may come as a surprise to some as he highlights that he may not be a lock to make the roster. The former Pro Bowl receiver played in just 11 games last year and didn't produce to the level New England had hoped, logging 260 receiving yards. With New England getting younger at receiver and in a transition phase, it wouldn't be surprising if they opted to keep a young core which puts Smith-Schuster at risk, especially if he puts together an underwhelming camp.\n\nKey position battles\n\nDrake Maye vs. Jacoby Brissett for QB1: As we highlighted at various points above, how hard Maye pushes Brissett will be worth watching this summer. Maye already moved to QB2 during the spring workouts, and now he'll try to make the big push and oust Brissett from the starting job. If I were to fetch a prediction, Brissett is the guy that starts Week 1, but how Maye shows out this summer could speed up when this ascension takes place.\n\nJoe Milton III vs. Bailey Zappe: I don't think the Patriots will be carrying four quarterbacks on the opening 53-man roster. With Maye and Brissett virtual locks, that final spot could come down to Milton or Zappe. Milton's arm talent was apparent throughout the spring and was on full display during his time at Tennessee. I would argue that he has the inside track because of his age and talent, while Zappe may simply be veteran insurance if something were to happen to Brissett leaving New England with two rookies.\n\nStarting left tackle: With the Patriots paying Michael Onwenu this offseason to be the team's right tackle, the questions along New England's offensive line now shift to the left side. The club drafted Wallace in the third round and signed former Steelers tackle Chukwuma Okorafor in free agency. Both have more experience at right tackle than they do left, but how this battle unfolds could shape how this offense produces throughout the year.\n\nWide receiver: As we noted with Smith-Schuster above, the Patriots have a crowded receiver room at the moment, which means a notable name may get cut. DeMario Douglas and Kendrick Bourne are two veteran locks, while the club signed K.J. Osborn in free agency and drafted Ja'Lynn Polk and Javon Baker. Already, that's five players for possibly six slots. So, Smith-Schuster, Tyquan Thornton, Jalen Reagor, Kayshon Boutte, and others could be duking it out."
