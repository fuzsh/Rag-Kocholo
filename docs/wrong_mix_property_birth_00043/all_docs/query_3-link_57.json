        "text": "Michael A. Bryan, age 76, Bismarck (formerly of Grafton, ND), died Thursday, December 6, 2018, at Sanford Hospital, Bismarck, ND, following a courageous battle with lymphoma.\n\nMass of Christian Burial will be held at 12:30 pm Friday, December 14, 2018, at Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, 519 Raymond St., Bismarck, ND, with Reverend Austin Vetter as celebrant. Burial will be at the North Dakota Veterans Cemetery, Mandan, ND, at a later date. Family will greet guests at the church gathering space starting at 11:30am prior to Mass.\n\nMichael “Mike” was born October 18, 1942, in Linton, ND, to Vincent and Agnes (Schmaltz) Leuwer of Linton. Mike later moved to Dickinson, ND where he attended elementary and high school. Upon graduation in 1961 he enlisted in the United States Air Force and served in Minot, ND and London, England. He married Marilyn Morris in Bismarck on June 17, 1967. Together they had two daughters, Melissa and Melanie. He received his BS Degree in Secondary Education from Dickinson State College majoring in Physical Education and American History. He worked as a Licensed Addiction Counselor for Traill County Welfare, Hillsboro, ND, the Council on Alcohol and Drug Problems, Grand Forks, ND, and owned and operated MAB Addiction Counseling Services, Grafton, ND for a total of 45 years serving clients in Traill, Walsh, Pembina and Cavalier counties. He was passionate about his work and relentlessly endeavored to help others achieve and maintain sobriety. He retired in June 2017 when he and his wife moved back to Bismarck.

Mike was a member of the National Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, the North Dakota Addiction Counselors Association and Chemical Task Force, Grafton ND. He was a member and past president of the Grafton Kiwanis.\n\nMike had an artist’s eye and a designer’s touch. He had a great appreciation for art – especially Native American art and artifacts. He was proud of his German from Russia heritage as well as the roots his grandparents established in central ND. He saw real beauty in the Dakota plains he called home. Mike’s most favorite past time was spending precious time with his family. He was generous and loved to shop and give unique gifts to the people in his life. The greatest gift he gave was his love.\n\nHonored to have shared his life are his wife, Marilyn; daughters, Melissa (David Armstrong) Bryan, Kansas City, MO, Melanie (Romain) Wiser, Minneapolis, MN; granddaughters, Sophie Armstrong and Ruby Wiser; sisters, Mary Kay (Arch) Jones, Batesville, AR, Betty Jane (Bobby) Morgan, Farmington, AR, Patricia (Steve) Purdy, Farmington, AR, Laura (Jim) Carpenter, North Little Rock, AR; brothers, Bill (Pam) Bryan, Bismarck, ND, and Steve (Trish) Bryan, Benton, AR; brothers and sisters-in-law, Lon and Roberta Klusmann, Dacula, GA, Gordon and Leslie Morris, Rockdale, TX; sister-in-law, Bonnie Morris, Phoenix, AZ; aunt, Fern Bauleke, Le Seuer, MN; uncle, Matt Schneider, Linton, ND; and many cousins, nieces, nephews and friends.\n\nPreceding him in death were his father, Vincent D. Leuwer; mother, Agnes Bryan and stepfather, J. M. Bryan; sister, Margaret Boykin; nephew, Bryan Jon Boykin; and niece, Victoria Morris; as well as grandparents, many aunts, uncles, cousins, parents-in-law and brother-in-law, Russell Morris.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, consider a gift to Heartview Foundation or Abused Adult Resource Center, Bismarck, ND."
