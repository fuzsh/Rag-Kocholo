        "text": "20 years ago I stepped foot onto Amgen’s Thousand Oaks campus for the first time as a summer intern. Looking back, the memories, friendships, learnings, and collective good that I’ve had the privilege of being a part of, both in the workplace and the local community, are things I know I’ll cherish and continue to tell stories about for the next 20 years and beyond. I’ve been told I’m an odd one for staying at one place for so long. While “staying put” isn’t for everyone and sometimes not a choice that everyone gets to make, I find myself privileged to be in a place where I have the opportunity to lay deep roots and invest in others, both through the work Emily Yee and I get to do with so many amazing team members at Amgen, and in the community we are raising our family in, through our efforts to build kidSTREAM Children's Museum and increase access to early childhood educational experiences in Ventura County. Shoutout to Noel O'Connor for taking a chance on a sophomore Cal Poly Orfalea College of Business student back in the summer of 2004. I’d like to think I’ve grown a lot since then, but pretty sure it’s still not enough to fit those jeans… #mycompany\n\nI'm hiring! I'm looking for an experienced and visionary knowledge management leader to lead a team of knowledge management professionals and oversee the creation and delivery of knowledge products and services that serve the needs of Amgen's Research & Development organization, a global network of the some of the brightest and most talented people you'll ever meet, who are joined by a shared mission to discover, develop and deliver life changing medicines to patients everywhere. I like to describe the knowledge management practice we've built as being comprised of equal parts digital enablement, advancing a culture that shares the things that matter, and deploying thoughtfully designed processes when needed to capture and surface knowledge, with a preference towards seamlessly integrating into the flow of work as a first priority. If driving a culture of knowledge sharing and discovery, while aligning with and influencing cross-functional efforts to develop and advance solutions with an enterprise mindset is something you've had success in, let's talk!\n\nI’m happy to share that I’m starting a new position as Executive Director R&D Knowledge & Learning at Amgen! They say that career journeys are not always straight lines, and as I reflect on the journey that has led me to this role, I am incredibly grateful for those who I've had the opportunity to work alongside, learn with, and to build with. Together we've built amazing things to tackle challenges that were in need of a solution. Together we've built incredible teams that will forever be memories we cherish and think back on with a smile. And perhaps most importantly, together we've built each other up, to take on the next big project with a new set of skills, perspectives, and learnings so that we do it even better and faster the next time. Let's do this!\n\nSuch a big day for kidSTREAM Children's Museum, but even more for each of the over 200,000 children and their families that are growing up in the region without a local children's museum! A HUGE thank you to Amgen and the Amgen Foundation, as well as to every volunteer, donor, and kidSTREAM's founding board members that have given of themselves over the years. Couldn't be more proud to be a part of both organizations on a day like today as we take a major step forward in brining a children's museum to #VenturaCounty which we KNOW will change the life trajectories of children and inspire them to make their mark on the world! #mycompany"
