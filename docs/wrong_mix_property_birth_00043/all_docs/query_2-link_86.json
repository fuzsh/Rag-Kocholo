Kutner, PhD, MPH\n\nAssistant Professor of Clinical Medical Psychology (in Psychiatry), Columbia University Irving Medical Center\n\nEmail: bryan.kutner@nyspi.columbia.edu\n\nTel: 646-774-6935\n\nBryan Kutner, PhD, MPH, is a Research Scientist at the HIV Center. Dr. Kutner studies the influence of behavioral interventions and social factors, like stigma, on engagement and retention in HIV services. His past research sought to quantify stigma toward anal sexuality, then test associations with HIV services and harm reduction practices, including the use of PrEP and U=U. He is particularly interested in social determinants of health disparities, and factors related to the implementation of evidence-based practices, like motivational interviewing, in resource-constrained settings. His current projects include the development of implementation strategies to reduce HIV-related stigma, including stigma toward anal sex, to improve the quality of care and engagement in HIV services among affected populations.\n\nEDUCATION:\n\nYale University\n\nBA – 1997 – Sociology\n\nColumbia University Mailman School of Public Health\n\nMPH – 2012 – Epidemiology\n\nUniversity of Washington - Seattle\n\nPhD – 2017 – Clinical Psychology\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:\n\n1998-1999: Training Coordinator and Bookkeeper, Harm Reduction Coalition\n\n1999-2001: Supportive Housing Case Manager, Baker Places Integrated Services Network\n\n2001-2010: Senior Writer and Trainer, UCSF AIDS Health Project\n\n2007-2012: Public Health Advisor, Men’s Sexual Health Project, New York Health & Hospitals Corporation and NYU School of Medicine\n\n2007-2008: Research Assistant, UCSF Center for AIDS Prevention Studies\n\n2010-2012: Research Technician, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene\n\n2012-2015: Clinical Supervisor, Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene\n\n2011: Evaluation Fellow in Implementation Science, ICAP Swaziland\n\n2012-2013: Research Assistant, Simoni Lab, Department of Psychology, University of Washington\n\n2013-2015: Staff Therapist, Psychological Services and Training Clinic, University of Washington\n\n2014: Study Interviewer, Harm Reduction Research and Treatment Lab, University of Washington\n\n2014-2015: Staff Therapist, Behavioral Research and Training Clinics, University of Washington\n\n2014-2015: Practicum Therapist, Center for the Science of Social Connection, University of Washington\n\n2014-2015: Teaching Assistant, University of Washington Department of Psychology\n\n2016: Psychology Extern, Adult Inpatient Psychiatry, Mount Sinai St. Luke’s Hospital\n\n2016-2017: Psychology Intern, Montefiore Medical Center and Albert Einstein College of Medicine\n\n2018-2020: Postdoctoral Research Fellow, HIV Center for Clinical & Behavioral Studies, New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University\n\nHONORS AND AWARDS:\n\n2005: University of California San Francisco Department of Psychiatry Staff Performance Award (team member)\n\n2005, 2009: University of California San Francisco WINGS Professional Development Scholarship\n\n2010-2012: Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health Merit Scholarship\n\n2012-2013: University of Washington Arts and Natural Sciences Fellowship\n\n2013, 2014: University of Washington Center for AIDS Research Trainee Grant\n\n2014: University of Washington Department of Psychology Travel Grant\n\n2014: University of Washington Excellence in Teaching Award (nominee)\n\n2016: University of Washington Robert C.
