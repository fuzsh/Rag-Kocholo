Amidst a time of financial uncertainty, the Governor’s proposed Budget maintains the state’s substantial investments in financial aid, including $2.5 billion for Cal Grant and $636.2 million for Middle Class Scholarship, though the Budget also proposes forgoing a one-time funding increase to Middle Class Scholarship that was scheduled in the last budget agreement.\n\nPost\n\nFinancial aid applications for prospective and current college students to be available\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nCSAC Contact: Shelveen Ratnam 916 201-3405\n\nOffice Email: shelveen.ratnam@csac.ca.gov\n\nSacramento, Calif., December 31, 2023 – The Federal Student Aid Office has begun a soft launch of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA will open periodically during this soft launch period and students and families are encouraged to check for updates on when the form is available (linked here). Additionally, the California Student Aid Commission has simultaneously launched the opening of the California Dream Act Application (CADAA), and students can begin applying for financial aid for the 2024-25 academic year.\n\nBoth financial aid forms were delayed from their typical October availability due to major changes made in each application. The Federal Student Aid Office (FSA) of the U.S. Department of Education has worked to streamline the FAFSA by integrating tax data so most families will have prepopulated data on the form, making for a quicker and more efficient process. The new FAFSA also replaces the “Expected Family Contribution” (EFC), which often created confusion for students and families, with the “Student Aid Index” (SAI) and an updated formula determining financial aid eligibility. This updated formula will result in more students being eligible for a Pell Grant and increased eligibility for the maximum Pell Grant, ensuring more students receive more aid.\n\nPost\n\nCalifornia Student Aid Commission Executive Director Marlene Garcia to retire at the end of June 2024\n\nDirector Garcia spent nearly 3 decades in public service, oversaw significant gains in student success and access, and led with a focus on equity\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nCSAC Contact: Shelveen Ratnam 916 201-3405\n\nOffice Email: shelveen.ratnam@csac.ca.gov\n\nSacramento, Calif., December 13, 2023 – Marlene Garcia, the California Student Aid Commission’s (Commission) Executive Director, announced today that she will be retiring at the end of June 2024.
