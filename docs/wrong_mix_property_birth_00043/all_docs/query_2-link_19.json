        "text": "In the District 2 Majors division tournament Newark National took a 2-0 lead in the top of the first, then added three more runs in the fifth. Brandywine rallied from a 5-0 deficit, tying the game in the fifth highlighted by Shane Savage’s single to center, scoring two runs. Then walked it off in the bottom of the sixth as Cooper Anderson singled to center before Nolan Giles lined a ball over the fence in dead center field. He was mobbed at home plate by his teammates and coaches as he reached the plate for the 7-5 victory. Giles led Brandywine going 2-2 with a double and a homerun scoring 2 runs and adding 2 RBI’s. Brandywine had six other players who added hits in the game. Ian Robson, Jeremy Funcich and Brandon McBride each had two hits a piece for Newark National. With the win Brandywine advances to play Canal this Monday at Newark National with a start time of 6:30pm. Unfortunately Newark National is eliminated. Canal Little League jumped out to the lead in the top of the first inning after Ethan Tuten tripled, scoring two runs while Maddox Gable singled, scoring a third run for a 3-0 lead. . Naamans got a run of their own in the bottom of the first to make it a 3-1 lead for Canal. Hunter Pettit then homered to center field scoring two more runs in the top of the third to push the lead up to 5-1. Naamans however had an answer for Canal as they added two runs in the bottom of the fourth on RBI singles by Conner Fitzpatrick and Anthony Catalina. Then they walked the game off in the bottom of the sixth scoring three runs in an inning with the winning run coming after Patrick Tray was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded which forced in the winning run. Naamans walked it off with a 6-5 victory to advance to the winners bracket as they remain undefeated. Naamans with the win stays in the winners bracket and awaits for the winner of the Canal vs Brandywine game this Monday at Newark National with a start time of 6:30pm. The winner will then face Naamans for the District 2 championship which is set to start on Wednesday the 17th at Naamans Little League with a start time of 6:30pm.\n\nIt was a highly anticipated 2 vs. 7 matchup between the 4-6 St. Georges Hawks and the 6-4 Appoquinimink Jaguars. Both teams rounded into form with strong second halves of the season and were perhaps coming into this game playing their best football. Appo was riding high coming off an impressive comeback effort against Salesianum last week to earn a District regular season championship and earning the 2nd seed in the DIAA playoffs. They would yet again need to mount a comeback in this game if they wanted to advance. The game started off with four consecutive 4th down stops by each team’s defense and the tone was set that this was going to be a defensive battle. Appo, who developed a strong pass game in the second half of the season behind freshman quarterback Greg Nielson, reverted back to the Run-DMC (Daniel McConomy) show in the first half, with McConomy carrying the ball 21 times for 64 yards in the first half. Nielson only attempted 5 passes in the first half, one of which was intercepted. The Hawks had a tremendous defensive game plan, key on McConomy, and stop the inside running game behind Appo’s strong offensive line. They did just that. The only scoring of the half was an opportunistic punt return for a touchdown by sophomore speedster Reggie Lea of St. Georges. With only 2 minutes remaining in the first half, Jaguar punter, Mason Reinhart, punted the ball that took a bounce at the 28-yard line of the Hawks, yet nobody seemed to be in a hurry to down the football. Lea recognized that if he ran up and fielded it on a bounce, there was nobody in front of him and he did just that. Lea covered 69 yards in just under 8 seconds to break the scoring open, 7-0. The score would stand until halftime. The second half would begin with a Jaguar possession. On the second play from scrimmage, Nielson was intercepted by Emory Womack which would give St. Georges a short field of only 19 yards. After a strong 18-yard run from Kwame Miller set the Hawks on the doorstep, it was Terry White who would kick the door down. The extra point would be missed, and the score would be 13-0. Appo would try to surmount a comeback. They would get their passing game going late in the third quarter as Nielson would throw the ball 5 times on their third possession of the 3rd quarter, completing 3 of them including a 41-yard touchdown pass to Noah Hoff on a beautifully placed ball. The third quarter would end with a 13-7 score. Lea would take the following kickoff deep into Jaguar territory and after a few plays, the Hawks were in a goal-to-go situation. Appo would come up with a HUGE defensive stop as District Lineman of the Year, Elijah Husser would stonewall a Hawk attempt on 4th and goal. Appo would have one last attempt to tie this game. They put together a great, 5- minute drive to march down inside the St. Georges redzone, however a strip-sack on Nielson would give the Hawks the ball back with under 7 minutes to go in the game. The Hawks would execute clock management beautifully and would pick up crucial first-downs thanks to star quarterback, Donovan Brooks. Appo wouldn’t get the ball back until only 13 seconds remained on the clock. They then ran a draw play that left many in Jaguar Stadium scratching their heads as time would expire. The Hawks will move on to play the winner of Sussex Central vs Dover next week. Anything can happen come playoff time, and the Hawks proved just that.\n\nState Auditor Kathleen McGuiness, who on July 1 was found guilty of three misdemeanor corruption charges, has asked the judge in her trial to overrule the jury’s verdict. Separately, defense attorney Steve Wood asked Superior Court Judge William Carpenter Jr. to grant a new trial on the three counts on which she was found guilty, citing numerous perceived errors made by the prosecution, the jury, and the judge. The Kent County jury found McGuiness guilty on charges of official misconduct, structuring and conflict of interest. All three charges are misdemeanors. McGuiness was acquitted of charges of theft and intimidation, both felonies, after a three-week trial. Before Carpenter rules on the motions, the state will have an opportunity to respond. Their filings are due in less than a week, but Department of Justice communications director Mat Marshall said “we doubt we will take that long.” After the prosecution rested its case during the trial, Wood asked Carpenter to issue a judgment of acquittal, arguing the state failed to meet its burden of proof. That type of request is typical for trials of this nature. Carpenter had three options: he could grant the request, deny the request, or defer judgment. He chose to defer judgment. Because the jury found McGuiness guilty on three of the five charges, Wood is asking the judge to return to the earlier motion and decide whether to overrule the jury’s verdict. Such a decision is rare. As Marshall explains, courts are “highly deferential to a jury’s decision” and “don’t like to upend jury verdicts, for obvious reasons.” McGuiness asks for a new trial In his motion, Wood argues that the state committed multiple Brady violations. According to Cornell Law School’s Legal Information Institute, the Brady rule, named after Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), requires prosecutors to disclose materially exculpatory evidence in the government’s possession to the defense. That “includes any evidence favorable to the accused — evidence that goes towards negating a defendant’s guilt, that would reduce a defendant’s potential sentence, or evidence going to the credibility of a witness.” In his filing, Wood said the state withheld such evidence throughout the trial. “This adversely affected the Defendant’s ability to prepare and present her case, including her ability to conduct necessary investigations,” the motion reads. “There is no question that the guilty verdicts in this case are not worthy of confidence.” McGuiness’ defense also argues that Carpenter erroneously admitted inadmissible character evidence, allowed the prosecution to shift their theory on the structuring charge, and made inappropriate comments on state’s witnesses that may have influenced the jury. Defense renews motion for judgment of acquittal Wood asserts that the Superior Court is empowered to set aside a guilty verdict and enter a judgment of acquittal. In his filing, Wood essentially relitigates each of the issues he believes the jury got wrong and argues that “no rational trier of fact” could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As for count one, conflict of interest, Wood argues that McGuiness acted within the law when she hired her daughter, Elizabeth “Saylar” McGuiness. “Other employees resigned for personal reasons long after the decision to hire Saylar was made,” the motion says. “Saylar did things that other employees did for the same pay. Somehow, according to the State, this was a crime.” On count three, structuring, Wood says the jury made an error in judgment because, even if McGuiness committed all the elements of the crime, “there is no evidence that the Defendant possessed the requisite state of mind.” He argued that the state needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that McGuiness willfully fragmented or subdivided contracts with the intent to avoid compliance with state procurement code. “The State offered no evidence to prove these mentes reae,” the motion says. “To the contrary, the record reflects that the State Procurement Code was ‘not [the Defendant’s] wheelhouse,’… so she relied on her staff, who turned out to be similarly ignorant of the intricacies of procurement law or missing in action entirely.” As for count four, official misconduct, Wood argues that a conviction is sustainable only if McGuiness is convicted on count one, count three, or both, which she was. He explained that because the court should grant his motion as to counts one and three, the court should also grant the motion as to count four. What’s next? The prosecution is expected to respond to the motions in the coming days. The defense may then have an opportunity to respond to the state, after which Carpenter will issue a ruling on the motions. The schedule for sentencing is up to a judge. According to Marshall, “because the issues have been thoroughly vetted and neither party is requesting a pre-sentence investigation, we expect [sentencing to occur within] 30 days.”\n\nDozens of First State prospective college students are receiving financial help through scholarships.
