        "text": "The winningest doubles team in the history of Open tennis entertained a group of approximately 400 cheering fans in the American Business Bryan Brothers Shootout, a pre-US Open warm up at Manursing Island Club benefiting NYJTL and the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning.\n\nFifteen-time Grand Slam champions Bob and Mike Bryan squared off against another world-class doubles team, Jean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau, in a match that may take place in the next two weeks at Flushing Meadows.\n\nBetween sets of the exhibition, NYJTL Board Member and ATP World Tour alumnus Bruce Manson, representing ATP, presented the ‘ACES for Charity’ grant of $15,000 to fellow Board Member Polly Scott, whose late husband Gene Scott was a founding member of both NJTL (National Junior Tennis & Learning) and the ATP. The grant will help fund the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning.\n\n“NYJTL has a long history of connections with past and present ATP World Tour players,” said Manson. “I am happy to be part of that tradition with the ‘ACES for Charity’ grant to support the Cary Leeds Center for Tennis & Learning.”\n\nPreceding the exhibition match, 12 amateurs had the experience of playing with and against the four world-class doubles players. “The members at Manursing were excited to be able to benefit NYJTL by staging this extraordinary Pro-Am and exhibition for the local community”, said NYJTL Board member Polly Scott.\n\nThrough their participation in the American Business Shootout, the Bryans continued their support of the Cary Leeds Center, which began last summer when they kicked off the Cary Leeds 1,000 Friends Campaign with a $5,000 donation. Following the exhibition, the Bryans brought NYJTL participants on court and volleyed with some of the children, while the other children joined hands between the brothers to form a snake. Just before the final point was to be played, the Bryans issued a challenge — announcing that NYJTL would receive $1,000 from the Bryan Bros. Foundation if the children won the point — of course, the children won the point.\n\nIn addition to the four ATP players, participants in the Pro Am included top area teaching professionals Todd Paul and DJ Gaetz of Manursing Island Club, Juan Arraya and Marcel Lima of Westchester Country Club, Anton Mavrin from Wee Burn Country Club and Harry Walsh of Larchmont Shore Club. Enthusiastic amateurs included Chuck Caulkins, Zander Comfort, Alain Decoster, Paul Evanson, Howard Helene, Gary Killian, Brian O’Connor, Joe Seibecker, Gary and Jeff Tolman and juniors Henry Decoster, who plays for Greenwich High, and Teddy Van Eck and Shane Killian, who are both heading to IMG Academy to work with world-famous coach Nick Bollettieri. Following the tennis, guests had the opportunity to meet and mingle with the four players over hors d’oeuvres and cocktails.\n\nThe Bryan twins have won multiple Olympic medals, including the gold in 2012 in London. They have achieved a career Golden Slam, winning all four Grand Slam doubles at least once in addition to the Olympic Gold, and they hold the record for longest stretch as the World No. 1 doubles team at 47 weeks. Bob and Mike also won the 2007 Davis Cup along with Andy Roddick and James Blake. The Bryans were named ATP Team of the Decade for 2000–2009.\n\nJean-Julien Rojer and Horia Tecau, ranked 21 and 30 in the world respectively, won their first ATP World Tour title (Zagreb) in their fourth tournament as a team. Since then the pair has appeared in the finals of four ATP World Tour Titles, winning 3 of them (Casablanca, Bucharest and Hertogenbosch). Roger has 13 career doubles titles and Tecau has 20."
