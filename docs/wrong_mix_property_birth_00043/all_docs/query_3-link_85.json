For tickets: https://cliffdrysdale.ticketspice.com/tennis-with-the-stars-2023\n\nThe Bryan Brothers Foundation is a non-profit 501c3 organization dedicated to helping support and grow the dreams of children in Ventura County and around the world. The foundation's mission is to identify and support charities and causes that help at-risk youth survive and thrive. We seek out specific families and children in need, working with them directly to ensure that they have the opportunities they need to succeed. In everything we do, we will promote the ideals of sports, and tennis in particular, to emphasize the values of hard work, dedication and perseverance.\n\nThe Bush ACE Outreach Program was launched in 2016, at the Bush Tennis Center in Midland, Texas to Advise, Counsel, and Encourage (ACE) area youth by connecting positive role models with elementary-aged children through the sport of tennis. Thanks to partnerships with the University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) and the United States Tennis Association (USTA), ACE has provided free in-school programs to over 40,000 elementary-aged children throughout the Permian Basin and free or discounted after-school and summer programs supported by the Bush Tennis Center. In addition to learning the sport of tennis, ACE promotes the core values of sportsmanship, integrity, self-confidence and hard work.\n\nIn 2023, ACE will continue to expand with new university partnerships. The 2023-2024 Bush ACE Outreach Program goal is to reach over 200,000 children.\n\nFor more information\n\nTim Stallard\n\n[email protected]\n\n(512) 576-4796\n\nSource:prnewswire.com"
