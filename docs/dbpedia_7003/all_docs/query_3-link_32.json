        "text": "Margot Robbie‘s production company is making it official with the studio that backed the Oscar-nominated blockbuster “Barbie.”\n\nLuckyChap signed a multi-year, first-look feature film deal with Warner Bros. to collaborate on future projects. The pact follows the smash success of “Barbie,” which was distributed by Warner Bros. and produced by Robbie and her LuckyChap partners, Tom Ackerley and Josey McNamara. With $1.45 billion globally, “Barbie” was the highest-grossing movie of 2023 as well as the biggest film in the studio’s 100-year history. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including best picture.\n\nAs Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group co-chairs and CEO Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy build out the studio’s film slate, they said they’re on a mission to “invest and commit to working with the greatest partners in front of and behind the camera.”\n\n“Margot, Tom and Josey have built a unique home for storytellers at LuckyChap, where filmmakers are doing incredible work in a supportive and creatively freeing environment,” De Luca and Abdy said in a statement. “We are excited to have Margot, Tom and Josey join our extended family, making movies of all sizes and genres for moviegoers the world over.”\n\nLuckyChap’s first project to hit the big screen was “I, Tonya,” an Oscar-winning dark comedy featuring Robbie as Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding. The company has also worked on Emerald Fennell’s first and second feature, “Promising Young Woman” and “Saltburn.” LuckyChap most recently backed the coming-of-age film “My Old Ass,” from director Megan Park and star Aubrey Plaza. The movie premiered at Sundance and sold to Amazon MGM.\n\nOn the television side, LuckyChap has worked on Netflix’s limited series “Maid” and Hulu’s “Dollface” and “Mike.”\n\n“We founded LuckyChap to fight for projects and filmmakers we believe in. We are thrilled to be cementing our long-standing relationship with Warner Bros. Discovery,” the LuckyChap team said. “David [Zaslav], Mike and Pam share our commitment to storytelling and the theatrical experience. We can’t wait for what’s to come.”\n\nIn a recent Variety cover story, Robbie shared her ambitions to turn LuckyChap into an entertainment empire by investing in originality.\n\n“We want to make more films that have the effect that ‘Barbie’ has,” Robbie said. “Why can’t it be another big, original, bold idea where we get an amazing filmmaker, a big budget to play with, and the trust of a huge conglomerate behind them to go and really play? I want to do that.”\n\nLuckyChap is represented by CAA, Entertainment 360, Attorney Jeff Bernstein and Narrative."
