        "text": "CinemaCon 2024 has officially kicked off and many of the big movie studios are in Las Vegas ready to show off what the future holds for each of them. We here at IGN are in attendance and will be breaking down all the big news from the biggest presentations.\n\nWe must sadly share, however, that not everything is released to the public right away after a presentation, do we will do our best to describe as much as we can so you can learn more about your favorite upcoming films!\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures' presentation was the first we attended and was highlighted by Joker: Folie à Deux, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice. We also got a new look at Kevin Costner's Horizon and M. Night Shyamalan's Trap.\n\nCheck out all the big news from Warner Bros. Pictures' CinemaCon panel below and be sure to stay tuned for more coverage as the week continues. And be sure to let us know what your favorite reveal was at CinemaCon!\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux First Trailer Unites Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck With Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nAs we mentioned, not everything shown at CinemaCon is released to the public. Luckily for DC fans, the first trailer for Joker: Folie à Deux was and it is already taking the internet by storm.\n\nIn the footage, we see parts of Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn relationship. What is perhaps most striking is how it appears to switch from what could be described as their romantic delusions to a grimmer reality. It also looks to confirm a big change in Harley Quinn's story in that she will now be a patient at Arkham Asylum rather than a psychiatrist.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips took the stage to discuss the film and confirmed that while the sequel is not a full musical, music will be an \"essential element.\" It also apparently won't \"veer\" too much from the original film and that Arthur Fleck has always had \"music in him.\"\n\nJoker: Folie à Deux will hit theaters on October 4, 2024.\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga Footage Shows Anya Taylor-Joy on a Mission\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe above trailer is not from CinemaCon.\n\nThose in attendance at Warner Bros. Pictures' CinemaCon panel were treated to an extended sneak peek at Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. The few moments on display showcased the early life story of Anya Taylor-Joy's Furiosa and her arduous journey to avenge her mom and lost childhood. We also saw some of this story in the most recent trailer for Furiosa.\n\nDirector George Miller also stopped by CinemaCon and said Furiosa will take place over a span of 16-18 years of backstory and Taylor-Joy shared that this is \"the story of one woman's committment to impossible hope.\"\n\nFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga rides into theaters on May 24, 2024.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice Is Almost Back After 36 Years of Waiting\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe above trailer is not from CinemaCon.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice took center stage at Warner Bros.' presentation and we were shown new footage of the sequel in action alongside previous clips from the trailer. We get good looks at Keaton's Beetlejuice, the Deetzes - Winona Ryder's Lydia, Catherine O'Hara's Delia, and Jenna Ortega's Astrid - and even Willem Dafoe's character. Lydia also seemingly confirms the film will deal with the dead and the living trying to co-exist.\n\nKeaton has seen the film two times now and says it is \"really f***** good\" and that Ortega is \"just perfect\" in the movie and got what they were going for right away.\n\nBeetlejuice Beetlejuice opens in theaters on September 6, 2024.\n\nMickey 17 Trailer Shows the Many Lives of Robert Pattinson's Mickey\n\nThe first trailer for Mickey 17 was shown at Warner Bros.' panel and showed how Robert Pattinson's Mickey is an \"expendable\" asset who can be reprinted whenever he dies. The film is based on Edward Ashton's Mickey 7, but director Bong Joon-ho of Parasite fame changed the title to Mickey 17 because he kills Pattinson's character 10 more times than the book did.\n\nThe footage featured Pattinson acting against himself multiple times in this futuristic sci-fi world and Bong-ho knew he could play all these different versions of Mickey because he has a \"crazy thing in his eyes.\" We also got to see Mark Ruffalo's dictator character, his wife who is played by Toni Collette, Mickey's girlfriend who is played by Naomi Ackie, and Steven Yeun, who will be playing Mickey's \"strange buddy.\"\n\nMickey 17, which really is the story of a \"simple man who ends up saving the world,\" will be released in theaters on January 31, 2025.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Gets a Breathtaking First Look\n\nFootage from Horizon: An American Saga, the two-part Western epic that stars and is directed, produced, and co-written by Kevin Costner, was revealed at CinemaCon and what was shown was a breathtaking sizzle reel of sorts from the films that tell a story set in the Civil War expansion and settlement of the American West.\n\nCostner said to the audience that he first tried to make these films back in 1988 and then in 2012 and he's so happy he now finally gets to get them across the finish line. However, his full plan for Horizon involves four movies that tell more of the story.\n\nHe also discussed how this film will explore the \"promise\" of America that was earned by people who claimed it for their own by being tough and resilient. However, that came at the expense of those already here. He also wants music to be an important focus for this epic and he even went to Scotland to get 92 musicians to work on the score.\n\nHorizon: An American Saga Part 1 is set to arrive in theaters on June 28, 2024, and the second part will be released on August 16, 2024.\n\nM. Night Shyamalan's Trap Looks to Send Audiences to a Concert Gone Wrong\n\nM. Night Shyamalan's next film is called Trap and he told us that his daughter Saleka, who is a musician, helped him form the idea for the project. As for what the movie is about, Trap looks to tell a story of an immersive experience like a concert that turns into a thriller.\n\nWhen the concert begins and the singer Lady Raven (played by Saleka!) comes on stage, something terrible happens and you come to find out this has all been a trap to capture a wanted serial killer who is played by Josh Hartnett.\n\nTrap will be released in theaters on August 9, 2024.\n\nHave a tip for us?
