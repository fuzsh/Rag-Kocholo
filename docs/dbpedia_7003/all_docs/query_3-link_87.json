        "text": "It looks like MGM has found a new distribution partner in Warner Bros. Discover for its international releases. There is, however, one massive surprise in the form that James Bond‘s next film is not part of that very deal. This deal is a move away from their usual partnership with Universal, who was behind the releases of House of Gucci, Licorice Pizza, and the previous James Bond installment, No Time to Die.\n\nAs of this deal, the upcoming releases of Bones and All as well as Creed III will be distributed through Warner Bros. International. Universal isn’t out of the deal completely, as they are still set to distribute MGM and Orion’s upcoming release of Till, as well as 2023’s Woman Talking. They also have the rights to distribute the next James Bond film,w which was part of their original agreement.\n\nThis multi-year deal not only includes theatrical distribution of non-US countries (which will also include China) but also means they will collaborate on marketing, publicity, and exhibitor relations. It does open up the question of what it might also mean for their US distribution, especially with Amazon purchasing MGM for $8.5 billion earlier this year.\n\nSource: Hollywood Reporter"
