        "text": "Dates: 1939 – present\n\nReplaces an older town square set, known as Midvale Street, which featured some of the houses that were later moved to Kings Row, the layout of street and sets were completely different. Midvale Street was the location for Dr. Socrates (1935) along with many others.\n\nMidwest Street, the current sets, were originally put together for Four Wives (1939), and are believed to have been extended for Saratoga Trunk (1945) (to be confirmed).\n\nThis is “Any Town USA” complete with a small town square, center gazebo, white church and steeple, brick courthouse and street level storefronts. A small tree-lined residential street meanders off the town square and is highlighted by six different homes. Practical interiors exist in three houses and several of the business facades.\n\nGilmore Girls:\n\nThe entire town of Stars Hollow is the Warner Bros Studios backlot set called “Midwest Street” built in 1946 for the film Saratoga Trunk (1946) (a small section usually unseen on the show – behind the church – was added in the early 1990’s for no particular television or film project). The residential street attached is called Kings Row and was used in 1941 (predating the town set) for the Ronald Reagan film of the same name. No new structures have been added to the backlot for the “Gilmore Girls,” although the backlot set remains dressed for the show throughout the television shooting season (July through March or April).\n\nChurch\n\nSeen in The Lost Boys, Oceans’ Eleven\n\nHigh School / Police Station\n\nFeatures as Rosewood High School in Pretty Little Liars, and the Police Station in Rebel Without A Cause.\n\nThe Tanner House\n\nLukes’ Diner\n\nFrom Gilmore Girls – this is a practical set.\n\nThe Alibi Room\n\nRed store front from Shameless\n\nSee also Kings Row for information about the Residential Street joining Midwest Street.\n\nAlso see the Warner Bros Special Events pages\n\nSeen on Screen: Warner Bros Studios [Midwest_St]"
