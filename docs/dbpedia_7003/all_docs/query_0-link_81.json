        "text": "[theme music] ANNOUNCER: What publicity stunt introduced Baby Ruth candy bars to thousands of Pennsylvanians?\n\nRebecca Lukens of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was the nation's first female what?\n\n[applause] Find out as we all play The Pennsylvania Game.\n\n[theme music] The Pennsylvania Game is made possible in part by Uni Marts, Incorporated.\n\nWith stores in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nServing you with courtesy and convenience every day of the year.\n\nUni-Marts, more than a convenience store.\n\n[theme music] Now let's get the game started.\n\nHow about a warm welcome for the host of The Pennsylvania Game, the loud but lovable, Lynn Cullen.\n\n[cheers and applause] And they call he loud.\n\nHi.\n\nHi.\n\nThank you.\n\nWelcome.\n\nIt is such a riot to stand up there teetering on the top of those stairs and watching the panelists faces as they do those teaser questions.\n\nThey're saying, Baby Ruth?\n\nCandy bars?\n\nLukens?\n\nWhat?\n\nDon't worry, we'll feed you a little more information and then you give us wrong answers, and that's the way we play the game.\n\nIt's fun.\n\nYou humiliate yourselves and we have a good time.\n\nLet's meet them.\n\nHa.\n\nOh, Goody, it's Scott Bruce.\n\nI'm back.\n\nSCOTT BRUCE: Yeah, he's back.\n\nHe used to live here, then he moved to New Jersey, which tells you something about him right there, right?\n\n[chuckles] Uh-huh.\n\nBad sense of direction?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, something like that.\n\nStand up comic by profession.\n\nState College native and a perennial here.\n\nPlease welcome Scott Bruce.\n\n[applause] How refreshing, a new face.\n\nA nice new face.\n\nNina Morgan was born and raised in Pennsylvania.\n\nShe is a professional Hunter gatherer who once took a walk with Jackie O. Ooh.\n\nIt's true.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Among other talents, she can slice vegetables with machine precision.\n\n[chuckles] Please welcome Nina Morgan.\n\nThank you.\n\n[applause] LYNN CULLEN: And another new face.\n\nI love it.\n\nGene Hosey, he is a poet, a writer and an actor.\n\nHe's a member of Gene Hosey and the God Awful Truth.\n\nWe'll find out more about that momentarily.\n\nAnd in 1994, he was named Poet Laureate of Harrisburg.\n\nWhat?\n\nReally?\n\nThat's true.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: That's true.\n\n[applause] There he is.\n\nA poet.\n\nOK, you know that Baby Ruth thing you heard about, let's find out a little more about that right now.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: In 1920, Otto Schnering founder of the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago created the Baby Ruth candy bar.\n\nThree years later, he launched an interesting publicity stunt in Pennsylvania that sealed the fate of the still popular candies.\n\nWhere the candy bars A, thrown into the stands at Forbes Field by baseball great Babe Ruth.\n\nB, included in every Carton of Lucky Strike sold in Pennsylvania.\n\nC, dropped from a plane onto the streets of Pittsburgh or D, handed out in Philadelphia by President Grover Cleveland.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Huh, well, all of those things would bring attention, I suppose.\n\nDid Babe Ruth throw them at the folks in Forbes Field?\n\nWere they in Lucky Strikes?\n\nDid they bombard the poor pedestrians of Pittsburgh with Baby Ruths or were they handed out by President Cleveland himself?\n\nScott, I know you don't have the slightest idea but-- Not even a clue and I'm damn proud of it.\n\n[chuckles] The only thing I know for sure is that Grover Cleveland wasn't the president in 1923.\n\nI'm pretty sure of that.\n\nYeah, I'm positive of that.\n\nSo I just guessed from there and I thought, gee, what a great thing to have Babe Ruth throw them out of Forbes Field.\n\nI went with A. Yeah, I liked that.\n\nHow smart of you.\n\nWho was the president in 1923?\n\nWilson or was it right after Wilson?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No.\n\nHarding?\n\nHarding?\n\nHarding.\n\nCoolidge?\n\nHarding?\n\nHarding or right after Wilson, Harding.\n\nHarding.\n\nYeah, I think.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Who the heck knows?\n\nI believe.\n\nI don't know.\n\nWho cares?\n\nSCOTT BRUCE: It's not the president game.\n\nI know, it's not the president.\n\nNina.\n\nNina.\n\nDo I push my button now?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, you should have pushed it long ago, darling.\n\nSCOTT BRUCE: Before I gave my answer.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Did you push it?\n\nNo.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No, you should push it.\n\nWe'll let you push it now this time, but you should push it immediately.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. Because I think it's a beautiful image, I will say C, dropped from a plane onto the streets of Pittsburgh.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, but if you got hit in the head with one of them you wouldn't think it was a beautiful image, would you?\n\nGene?\n\nWell, I like the idea of the Lucky Strikes because nothing goes better with a cigarette.\n\n[chuckles] I went with D, Grover Cleveland, because they're named after his daughter.\n\nSCOTT BRUCE: Yeah.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh, wow.\n\nAnd you're wrong.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Wow.\n\nSCOTT BRUCE: Was he president then?\n\nYes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: He was-- Grover Cleveland was president in 1923?\n\nI believe so.\n\nWe'll, find out.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is C. The candy bars were dropped from a plane into the streets of Pittsburgh.\n\nAlthough people often think the Baby Ruth was named for baseball great Babe Ruth, it was actually a Memorial to the young daughter of president Grover Cleveland.\n\nLittle Ruth died tragically at the age of 12 in 1903.\n\nSo Schnering, a family friend, called the new bar Baby Ruth in her honor.\n\nThe candy became popular nationally when Schnering flew over Pittsburgh dumping thousands of candy bars from his plane.\n\nEach bar was attached to its own tiny parachute which sent them gently to the ground.\n\nHuh, isn't that cute?\n\n[chuckles] It worked so well.\n\nFirst of all, it caused massive traffic jam.\n\n[chuckles] They said, hey, is this a good idea?\n\nThey did it in 40 other cities causing massive traffic jams in 40 other cities as well.\n\nYou might want to wear a hard hat next time you venture outside because you never know what will be falling.\n\n[laughter] How's about another question, huh?\n\nQuick.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: William Paul Johnson of Ridgeway has led a long and event filled life.\n\nHowever, there are things that even he hasn't done.\n\nWhich of the following is not true of William Johnson?\n\nA, he's the world's oldest bungee jumper.\n\nB, he was the oldest employee in Pennsylvania.\n\nC, he voted in 79 straight primary and general elections, or D, he pitched against Honus Wagner, the Pittsburgh Pirate great.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Wow, so three of those things is true of this gentleman, William Johnson.\n\nOne and one only is not.\n\nHe looked perfectly capable of having done any of those things, but do we hold him responsible if he's the one who voted in 79 straight elections?\n\nIs he responsible for this mess we find ourselves in now?\n\nNina, what did you pick?\n\nWilliam Johnson sounds like an old fashioned guy, so I say A. LYNN CULLEN: Because he wouldn't-- Yes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: --get into this newfangled-- Kind of thing.\n\nExactly.\n\nYeah, jumping off-- who in their right mind would do it anyway?\n\nI mean, how do you get to be 100 and whatever he is?\n\nYou don't do it jumping off buildings, do you?\n\nCertainly not.\n\nGene?\n\nI picked B because I thought if he did all those other things, he didn't have time to be employed.\n\n[chuckles] Scott?\n\nI'm going with Nina on this one.\n\nI don't think he would bungee jump.\n\nI know anyone in their right mind wouldn't.\n\nAnd once you've pitched with Honus Wagner, what the heck?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, what the heck?\n\nWhat the heck.\n\nI mean, the rest is-- it doesn't even matter anymore.\n\nAll right, so you all think he did pitch to Honus Wagner.\n\nLet's find out.\n\nThe answer is A. William Paul Johnson has done some incredible things in his life but bungee jumping isn't one of them.\n\nBorn in 1893, in Ridgway, he played baseball with the Saint Louis cardinals in the minor leagues in 1914 and '15 where he pitched against Honus Wagner.\n\nHe eventually left baseball and began working as a caretaker of the Ridgway armory, which he helped build until he retired in 1988.\n\nHe was 95.\n\nIn 1993, he received a citation from governor Casey for his outstanding voting record.\n\nHaving voted in 79 straight primary and general elections.\n\nWilliam Johnson.\n\nYou know, his own children retired before he did.\n\n[chuckles] He's 101 years old now still living in Ridgeway.\n\nHi, Mr. Johnson.\n\nNice to know you're still there.\n\nScott, you're still here.\n\nI'm still here.\n\nI'm going to hang around as long as he does too.\n\nOK, I hope so.\n\nso you've been-- I mean, you actually-- this guy actually makes it as a comic, which a lot of people try to and can't.\n\nYou open up for big national acts and concerts.\n\nOh, many times.\n\nYes, I've worked-- well, I've worked with an awful lot of people, Ray Charles, Todd Rundgren.\n\nDa da da.\n\nI've worked with Robin Williams.\n\nI've worked with Richard Pryor.\n\nI've worked with, jeez, Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Wow.\n\nTons and tons of people.\n\nIs that wonderful?\n\nIt's kind of neat.\n\nIt really is.\n\nSo it's really like a fraternity of funny guys?\n\nYeah, comedians are a pretty close knit group.\n\nWe all have that-- it's such an unusual way to make your life that there are certain bonds that you just can't get away from.\n\nI mean, we all have an identity immediately with one another, so it's fun.\n\nAnd you're not always funny when you don't have to be, right?\n\nNo, when I'm fighting with my wife, I'm never fighting.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Never funny.\n\n[chuckles] Actually most of the comedians-- SCOTT BRUCE: At least she doesn't think so.\n\nI know.\n\nMost of the comedians I know are all heavily medicated and on Prozac.\n\nHi, Nina.\n\nNINA MORGAN: Hello.\n\nWhat are you doing here do you suppose?\n\n[chuckles] I'm just kidding.\n\nI'm just kidding.\n\nDid you really take a walk with Jackie?\n\nWell, I did.\n\nThe only thing is Jackie was not fully aware that I would be going on the walk with her.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What happened?\n\nWell, I was near the Guggenheim and I was bored.\n\nAnd I was walking around and I saw that famous profile and I just took off after her and just trailed her for a number of blocks.\n\nSo we were walking together [chuckles] LYNN CULLEN: Oh, now wait a minute.\n\nSo, I mean, you never like-- you weren't engaged in conversation.\n\nWe did not speak, but I don't think that was necessary.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: No.\n\nWe had a rapport.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You did?\n\nYes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: So you just stalked her?\n\n[laughter] Essentially, I stalked Jackie and it was worth every moment.\n\nGee whiz.\n\nGene.\n\nGene.\n\nGene Hosey and the God Awful Truth.\n\nWhat the heck is that?\n\nIt's some musician friends of mine.\n\nPoetry-- it can't just be poetry anymore, you know, it's got to be a lot of other things.\n\nBut if you work with people in other mediums, you can reach a wider audience.\n\nBut these are fellow creators who are anxious to put music or sound to poetry.\n\nSo-- So they're musically inclined, you're poetically inclined, also an actor.\n\nDo you get any money for being Poet Laureate?\n\nNah.\n\nNo, in fact, no, I keep asking.\n\n[chuckles] I don't know how long this thing goes, but-- Yeah, right.\n\nWell, make your poem shorter and shorter, maybe they'll get the idea.\n\nHey, we're playing a game.\n\nI just remembered that.\n\nLet's do it.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: Located in the Curtis building in historic Philadelphia is America's largest exhibit of a world famous artist and illustrator.\n\nIs the museum dedicated to A, Norman Rockwell, B, N.C. Wyeth, C, Andrew Wyeth or D, Al Cap?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right, now who's that museum-- that's not a museum.\n\n--yeah, dedicated to?\n\nNorman Rockwell, Wyeth, Wyeth or Cap?\n\n[chime] Gene?\n\nI went with Norman Rockwell.\n\nI think the Wyeth's have an area somewhere else, and Al Cap, cartoonist-- LYNN CULLEN: Nah.\n\nNah.\n\nComedy just-- Nah.\n\nScott, you went with Al Cap, didn't you?\n\nI would have loved to have gone with Al Cap.\n\nI was praying for Al Cap.\n\nBut I had no clue and I decided the initials were nice and I went with N.C. Wyeth.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Why not.\n\nI have no reason at all.\n\nNo, none at all.\n\nNina?\n\nNina, you're doing well are you going to keep it alive?\n\nWell, I go with B because Scott did and-- LYNN CULLEN: No, it was a big mistake, Nina, darling.\n\n[chuckles] And N.C. Wyeth makes big beautiful things and I think they need a big beautiful space.\n\nOK. Well, I wouldn't argue with that.\n\nHowever, let's find out what the right answer is.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is A, Norman Rockwell.\n\nThe Norman Rockwell Museum, the largest permanent collection of the art of Norman Rockwell, opened its doors in the Curtis building in Philadelphia in 1976.\n\nAmerica's most famous and beloved illustrator sold his first cover to the editors of the Saturday Evening Post in 1916.\n\nFor 47 years, he delivered his cherished paintings to the post, which was headquartered in the Curtis building.\n\nThere they were printed on the cover of the famed magazine and were seen by millions of Americans each week.\n\nThe museum houses the entire collection of Saturday Evening Post covers and also a replica of Rockwell's studio as it appeared in his home town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n\nYeah, Norman Rockwell, how we like to think of ourselves, maybe how we never were but would have liked to have been.\n\nI don't know.\n\nOh, my, the score.\n\nIt's a pretty tight game, actually.\n\nNina's ahead.\n\nYou've got two correct.\n\nYeah, the gentlemen on either side of you have one correct answer.\n\n[applause] [theme music] Time now for the first clue to our mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nI will give you three during the course of the program.\n\nGet it right this time, you'll get three whole points.\n\nGet it right the second time, you'll get two.\n\nGet it right the third time, you get one.\n\nHere's the first clue.\n\nBorn in Bellefonte in 1860, he enrolled at Penn State at the age of 13 and later became one of the first Nittany Lion baseball players.\n\nNow, if anyone gets that on the first clue, I'll give you 20 points.\n\n[chuckles] Born in Bellefonte in 1860, enrolled at Penn State at the age of 13, became one of the first Nittany Lion baseball players.\n\nThink about it.\n\nThink about it.\n\nBut while you're thinking about that and because I know you can chew gum and walk at the same time, let's go to another question.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: From 1799 to 1812, Lancaster was Pennsylvania's State capital.\n\nDuring that time, it earned a nickname for something else.\n\nWhat was Lancaster known as in the 1800s?\n\nWas it A, the City of Stumps, B, Switzerland of America, C, Munich of the New World or D, Devil's Racetrack?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Gee, I sure hope it wasn't the City of Stumps.\n\nWho'd want to be known as that?\n\nThe Switzerland of America?\n\nMunich of the New World or Devil's Racetrack?\n\n[chime] Log in those answers, and Scott, which incorrect answer have you chosen for us?\n\nWell, I'm still working on it.\n\nThere we go.\n\nThere's a good-- oh, I hit the wrong one.\n\n[grunts] Well, the answer that I wanted to give was-- LYNN CULLEN: Yes, was?\n\nI was going to go with Munich of the New World.\n\nI thought either Munich or Switzerland, but I accidentally hit the Devil's Racetrack.\n\nAnd who knows, with my luck, that could have been the best thing.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: That might have been.\n\nThat might have been the best thing.\n\nThat was your luck, it probably wasn't.\n\n[chuckles] Nina, hello.\n\nNot Switzerland because it's flat down there.\n\nI'd say Munich of the New World.\n\nThe German influence.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: OK. All right.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI went with Switzerland of America because the Dutch are actually not from Germany, they're from Switzerland.\n\nAnd the Devil's Racetrack is located downtown around the monument.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: What do you mean by-- Yeah, Friday nights-- Oh, yeah.\n\n[chuckles] I don't-- I did not follow that at all.\n\nI thought the Dutch were from Holland.\n\nWhat do you mean they're from Germany?\n\nThey're from-- never mind.\n\nPennsylvania Dutch aren't.\n\nOh, OK.\n\nThis is Pennsylvania.\n\nThis guy sounds like he knows what he's talking about.\n\nI wonder if he's right though.\n\n[chuckles] ANNOUNCER: The answer is C. [music playing] In the 1800s, the Lancaster area was known as the Munich of the New World because of the property and quality of the beer being produced there by German immigrants.\n\nProhibition ended this era, and most of the area's 70 plus breweries disappeared.\n\nToday , Bube's Brewery, the only brewery in the US from the 1800s that's nearly intact, is the only remaining brewery in Lancaster.\n\nBuilt by German immigrant, Alois Bube, it doesn't produce any beer at the moment, but plans are underway to reactivate the historic brewery.\n\nBube beer.\n\nHey, give me a Bube, would you?\n\n[chuckles] All right.\n\nJim Thorpe, PA, was known as the Switzerland of America, by the way.\n\nAnd the Devil's Racetrack, Sewickley, PA.\n\nSo there you have it.\n\nHmm.\n\nWow.\n\nOK?\n\nOn to yet another stumper of a question.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: In 1900, Barney Dreyfuss acquired controlling interest of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nRegarded as one of the pioneers of baseball, Dreyfuss was often called A, the Father of the World Series.\n\nB, the Prince of Baseball.\n\nC, the Iron Horse or D, King Kong.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Well, I don't know if I called him some of those things to his face.\n\nBarney Dreyfuss, was he the Father of the World Series, the Prince of Baseball, the Iron Horse or King Kong?\n\n[chime] Nina?\n\nI'm going with King Kong.\n\n[chuckles] You are?\n\nWell, Fay Wray is going to be a little bit upset.\n\n[chuckles] It sounds like a powerful-- All right.\n\nAll right.\n\n--image.\n\nYes.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Mm-hmm.\n\nGene?\n\nI went with Iron Horse.\n\nYou said, Pittsburgh, right?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: I did.\n\nYes, Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nI didn't say much of anything.\n\nYes, Pittsburgh.\n\nGENE HOSEY: Iron horse.\n\nOK, iron horse.\n\nI think I got one.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You do?\n\nI think so.\n\nThe Father of the World Series.\n\nHe took over in 1900.\n\nThe first World Series was played in 1903 or something, and it was with Pittsburgh.\n\nI'm going with the Father of the World Series.\n\nOh, I'll tell you, your luck might have just changed.\n\nThis guy sounds like he knows baseball.\n\nLet's get the answer.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is A, the Father of the World Series.\n\nIn 1903, Barney Dreyfuss boldly challenged Henry Killilea, owner of the American League Champion Boston Pilgrims to a post-season playoff to determine baseball's best team.\n\nOn October 1, 1903, Deacon Philippe defeated the legendary Cy Young 7 to 3 in the first 'World Series' game ever played.\n\nOK. Iron Horse was Lou Gehrig.\n\nKing Kong was Charlie Keller of the Yankees, that was his nickname.\n\nWe're going to get a score here.\n\nYeah?\n\nYeah?\n\nIs it time for a score?\n\nI'm all confused.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nNina, you're still ahead.\n\nYou have three [chuckles] Scott, you have two.\n\nGene, you have one.\n\nIt's OK, three, two, one.\n\nSee how that works?\n\nYou say three, two, one and up comes a second clue for the mystery Pennsylvanian.\n\nNicknamed Monty, he played with the Philadelphia Athletics before beginning his career with the National league, pitching a perfect game in 1880 with his killer curveball.\n\nOh, man, Scott Bruce is going nuts.\n\nMr.\n\nBaseball over here.\n\nYou're probably the only one who has a shot at this.\n\nIt's killing him.\n\nOh, what's his last name?\n\nIt's not King Kong, I'll tell you that.\n\nIt's Monty, National League, 1880, perfect game, killer curveball, Born in Bellefonte, 1860, yada, yada, yada.\n\nLet's move on, please.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: What world renowned business was started by four brothers in New Castle Pennsylvania in 1903?\n\nWas it A, Brooks brothers, B, Hills Brothers coffee, C, Warner Brothers, Studios or D, Smith Brothers cough drops?\n\nLYNN CULLEN: All right, which brothers does New Castle claim?\n\nBrooks, Hills, Warner or Smith?\n\nClothing, coffee, movies or [coughs] cough drops?\n\n[chime] Gene.\n\nI'm going to go with Brooks brothers for no reason at all.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Of course not.\n\n[chuckles] Well, that's the way we play this game.\n\nReason has nothing to do with it.\n\nWell, I'm sure it wasn't Warners and Smith brothers were from upstate New York, but Hills and Brooks, I don't know, I went with Brooks.\n\nYou went with Brooks too.\n\nAre we going to make it unanimous, Nina?\n\nMaybe I'm in trouble, but I have the feeling that the Smith brothers have done some work in Pennsylvania.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Uh-huh.\n\nUh-huh.\n\nThey had real, real, real long beards if I recall.\n\nThey did.\n\nAnd kind of woodsy kind of look.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yeah, right.\n\nA little macho guys.\n\nLet's see if it was the Smith brothers.\n\nNina thinks so.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is C, Warner Brothers, Studios.\n\nThe Warner brothers Henry, Jack, Abe and Sam, opened the cascade theater in a leased building in New Castle Pennsylvania in 1903.\n\nAt the time, they couldn't afford any more than the $20 or $30 it cost to buy each 12 minute movie reel.\n\nSo they borrowed chairs from a nearby funeral parlor for their customers to sit on.\n\nThe arrangement had its drawbacks.\n\nAn unexpected funeral, and the chairs were reclaimed, often in the middle of the film, leaving the audience standing for the remainder of the show.\n\nToday, Warner brothers, Studio is a 102 acre facility located in Burbank California and referred to as celluloid city.\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nI think a lot of us were surprised to hear that indeed.\n\nNINA MORGAN: Yes.\n\nWe want to thank Janet Becker, excuse me, of New Providence.\n\nShe sent us that question.\n\nAnd Janet, we're sending you a free subscription to Pennsylvania Magazine as a thank you.\n\nSo, thank you.\n\nAll right, how's about another one?\n\nIsn't this fun?\n\nIsn't this fun?\n\nLet's do it.\n\nGENE HOSEY: I've got some work to do here.\n\nLet's do it, yeah.\n\n[music playing] ANNOUNCER: Born in 1794, Rebecca Lukens of Coatesville Pennsylvania was recognized by the Pennsylvania Senate in 1994 as the nation's first female what?\n\nA, industrial leader, B, lawyer, C, politician or D professional athlete.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: See how it looks can be deceiving?\n\nRebecca sure didn't look like any of those things, did she?\n\nIndustrial leader, lawyer, politician, professional athlete.\n\n[chime] Take a guess.\n\nI think this will be a pure guess.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Yes.\n\nI think the most likely would be lawyer, so I'm going to just kind of sneak under with that.\n\nOK. Rebecca Lukens esquire.\n\nNina, what do you think she was?\n\nWell, Rebecca looks serious, and I think she's a lawyer.\n\nShe was a lawyer.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Oh, was a lawyer.\n\nYeah, if she is a lawyer, that would be even a bigger question.\n\nGENE HOSEY: She's older than the other guy in the other question.\n\nYeah, we ought to set her up with Charlie Johnson or whatever his name was.\n\nGene.\n\nI went with politician.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: You did?\n\nYes.\n\n[chuckles] Yes.\n\n[chuckles] Shame, he went with politician.\n\nGENE HOSEY: This is my chance to catch up.\n\nWell, he's a beginner, what the heck.\n\nLet's get an answer here.\n\nANNOUNCER: The answer is A, industrial leader.\n\nWhen Rebecca Lukens was widowed in 1825, she was 31, the mother of five children and pregnant.\n\nHer husband's dying wish was that she run his boilerplate production mill, the ailing Brandywine Iron Works.\n\nWithin nine years, she turned the fledgling mill into a highly prosperous industry.\n\nEarning her a reputation as the nation's foremost businesswoman and the first female ironmaster.\n\nStill in operation as Lukens Incorporated, it is the nation's oldest steel company and

Athletics, pitched a perfect game in 1880, graduated from law school in '85 and he managed a Major League team.\n\nQuite a guy.\n\nBut who the heck is he?\n\nWho the heck is he there, Nina?\n\nWell, this was a tough one for me, I don't know baseball.\n\nBut since his nickname was Monty, I say he was Mr. Carlo.\n\n[chuckles] [applause] LYNN CULLEN: Well, yeah, we'll give you an A for effort there.\n\nMonte Carlo.\n\nI wouldn't bet on it.\n\nGene.\n\nI gave up after the first-- I used Babe Ruth because we had the candy bar thing going on but-- LYNN CULLEN: No way.\n\nNo idea.\n\nNo idea.\n\nThis guy over here, he's-- Now we'll see if this-- did you get it?\n\nI don't know.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: I mean, I could tell you knew it, but you were-- I don't know.\n\nI can't remember if this

could very well-- I've proved it over and over again.\n\n--be wrong.\n\nWho was this guy they called Monty?\n\nANNOUNCER: It's John Montgomery Ward.\n\nBorn and raised in Bellefonte, Monty, as he was called, enrolled at Penn State at the age of 13.\n\nThere he helped to organize the University's baseball team and concentrated on perfecting the curveball.\n\nA pitch that seemed unbelievable to spectators at the time.\n\nMonty played with a number of farm teams before joining the National League.\n\nThen in 1880, he became one of the handful of players to pitch a perfect game.\n\nWhen not on the field, he attended night classes, eventually graduated from Columbia Law School in 1885.\n\nAfter retiring from baseball, he started his own law practice in New York.\n\nHis marriage to stage actress Helen Dauvray took the world of baseball by surprise and ultimately ended in divorce.\n\nJohn Montgomery Ward, a famous Pennsylvanian.\n\nOK, John Montgomery Ward.\n\nI mean, when I saw that name, Montgomery Ward, I thought maybe he had something to do with that.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI don't know.\n\nI just know that I've lost again.\n\nAnd this time, I actually can tell why.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Why?\n\nWell, it turns out Nina's daughter is in the audience and she's giving her all the answers down here.\n\n[chuckles] This little thing right there?\n\nThe little one right there, she's giving all the answers away, she's flashing up to her mom.\n\nLYNN CULLEN: Really?\n\nFrom the mouths of babes.\n\n[chuckles] No, you stand unjustly accused.\n\nI know.\n\nGIRL: I haven't told
