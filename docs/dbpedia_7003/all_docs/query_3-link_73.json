        "text": "Visuals: The logo is now a TV rendition of the 1992 variant of the 11th Warner Bros. Pictures logo. The sky background is either darker or brighter, and the 1984 shield logo with the banner inscription \"WARNER BROS. TELEVISION\" is seen. Like the previous logo, this one often includes either \"Distributed by\" or \"Produced and Distributed by\" above the shield, and the byline \"An AOL Time Warner Company\" is below the shield, sometimes with a small website URL reading \"www.warnerbros.com\".\n\nVariants:\n\nEarly 2001-2003: This logo has a different cloud background, and a shinier WB shield logo, like that of the Warner Bros. Classic/Television Animation version, albeit without sparkles on the shield logo. The text \"Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution\" is above the shield logo with the new byline below it. The company URL is also temporarily removed. This was seen on the February 23, 2001 episode of Access Hollywood, early episodes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and some 2003 episodes of Street Smarts, the latter two both used prior to the debut of the 2003 logo.\n\nA narrow version of the 2001 logo exists.\n\nOne of the seasons of Extra earlier in the 2000s had the 2001 logo logo play as usual, except it ended with a shot of the logo on a television screen inside a giant X (this was when Extra had their logo revised from the '90s black and white one, to the \"x\" in a blue circle logo).\n\nA variant of the 2001 logo where the banner only reads \"WARNER BROS.\" also exists, which is seen on the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers, and the Kids' WB! series The Nightmare Room.\n\nAnother variant of the 2001 logo with the URL omitted which only the shield and the byline appear also exists, which is seen on Thieves (2001), and the second and third episodes of Birds of Prey.\n\nAn open-matte 2001 distribution variant also exists.\n\nA complete widescreen version of the 2001 logo with the clouds being enhanced also exists, which can be found on Witchblade.\n\nOn a Dutch airing of Third Watch, the open-matte version is shown, but the URL is changed to the UK website for Warner Bros. (\"www.warnerbros.co.uk\")\n\nThis was also seen on the UK airings of The West Wing, and is also preserved on a season 3 episode of Kung Fu on DVD.\n\nA variant of the 2001 logo found on UK airings of Friends, ER and The West Wing have an AOL Keyword below the logo \"AOL Keyword: (Name of Either Show, i.e. \"West Wing\")\" (\"AOL\" in its corporate acronym of the time) with the URL website reading \"www.warnerbros.co.uk\".\n\nA B&W variant of the 2001 Distribution variant also exists.\n\nOn the final episode of The Rosie O'Donnell Show, the copyright stamp appears below the AOL Time Warner byline and the URL which also exists.\n\nTechnique: A digital graphic.\n\nAudio: The 1994 theme from the 8th logo, the closing theme of the show (also on the \"Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution\" variant), or none.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, a low tone variant of the 1994 theme is heard.\n\nOn ABC Family (now Freeform) reruns of Family Matters, Full House, Growing Pains, and Step by Step, the theme sounds like it's been played at a stadium.\n\nWhen Full House was reran on Nick@Nite and TeenNick, WBTV used Dave Coulier's syndicated voice-over closing.\n\nGame Show Network airings of Love Connection plaster this logo over the 6th logo while retaining John Cervenka's voice over.\n\nOn newer ABC Family airings of Full House, the logos were shown first (with the closing theme playing over it), and the credits were shown afterwards in split-screen.\n\nOn the first episode of season 3 and the eighteenth episode of season 4 of Dallas on their respective DVD releases, it has the 1971 Lorimar theme on this logo due to a sloppy plaster job.\n\nOn season 1 episodes of What I Like About You on its DVD release, the Smallville episode \"Whisper\" and the ER season 3 episode \"One More for the Road\" on the S3 DVD release thereof, it uses the music from the next logo, both due to a rush plastering job.\n\nOn syndicated prints of seasons 6-8 of The Drew Carey Show, the show's stinger theme is heard.\n\nABC, CBS, Fox and NBC airings used their generic themes.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThis logo was seen on ABC Family (now Freeform) and TeenNick reruns of Full House.\n\nThis logo was a standard for plastering logos in the 2000s, plastering the 1972 \"Big \\\\'\" on H&I reruns and DVD releases of Kung Fu and the Me-TV reruns and DVD releases of Wonder Woman, as well as the 1978 Lorimar logo on most episodes of the first eight seasons of Dallas on DVD and also was seen on Down to Earth on Good Life TV (now Youtoo) in the early 2000s, USA Network airings of Living Single in the early 2000s (after the 1994-2001 WBDTD logo), as well as Nickelodeon/Nicktoons airings of Animaniacs.\n\nA version with the website text can be found on reruns of The Oblongs on Adult Swim.\n\nSeen on the second half of S6-S8 episodes of The Drew Carey Show, and also on 2001 episodes from the 2000-01 season of Access Hollywood right before NBC Enterprises took over in the fall of 2001.\n\nThis logo was also seen on Boomerang U.S. airings of The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo, but is omitted from the DVD, Boomerang and Tubi streaming service prints thereof.\n\nIt was also seen on a getTV airing of Young Guns II (a Morgan Creek film), before the 2002 SPT logo.\n\nWhen GetTV reran The Jimmy Stewart Show in 2015, the original ending with the third logo (the \"Kinney Shield\") was plastered by the \"Distributed by\" variant with the URL given below the AOL byline (the show's original closing theme music plays over the latter logo as well).\n\nThis is also plastered on the Warner Archive DVD release.\n\nDespite having ended use in late 2003, after the Time Warner name was reinstated, the 2001 logo was seen on the season 7-8 episodes of the first incarnation of Whose Line Is It Anyway? (and continuing to keep it this way as of the current UP reruns of the latter) up to its 2007 end.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of an old TCM airing of The Making of 'Cannery Row' (1982), a later print of The Doorway to Hell (1930), the pilot episode of Black Bart, (included on the 2014 UK Blu-ray release of Blazing Saddles (1974), plastering the 5th logo), and an old TG4 airing of Scooby's Mystery Funhouse as part of their Cúla4 block, following the blacked out 1979-era variant of the 1979 Hanna-Barbera \"Swirling Star\" logo.\n\nThe logo is also seen on 2013 Encore (later Starz Encore) airings of Batman Forever (1995), Quick Change (1990), and The Color Purple (1985), with it plastering the 1984 Warner Bros. Pictures closing logo on the latter.\n\nVisuals: Same as the 2001 logo, but the colors are brighter and the company byline is omitted, sometimes with the WB URL below. Like the 2000 and 2001 logos, either \"Distributed by\" or \"Produced and Distributed by\" (in the same font as the 2001 logo) are seen above the 1984 shield, sometimes being omitted.\n\nTrivia:\n\nIn the 2013 film Saving Mr. Banks, when Mrs. Travers arrives at the Los Angeles airport, a trio of cab drivers are holding signs for different film companies (one for Warner Bros., one for MGM, one for Walt Disney). The logo depicted on the sign is this one, which is historically inaccurate.\n\nThe \"Distributed by\" variant was seen on a July 20, 2016 TBS airing of the The Big Bang Theory episode \"The Boyfriend Complexity\", though this is probably a plastering error because this proceeded the Michael Patrick King Productions logo, which was also found on the same airing. Also, TBBT uses the completely bylineless version, meaning that TBS accidentally used the combo for 2 Broke Girls instead.\n\nVariants:\n\nSeries distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution have a further-back view of the logo, while Warner Bros. Television Distribution series feature a closer view. Though Mike & Molly was a new WB series and most new network WBTV series usually used the completely bylineless 2003 WBTV logo, the show used the 2003 WBTD version instead (with no URL).\n\nOn The Perils of Penelope Pitstop on DVD, the Boomerang streaming service and former Boomerang U.S. airings, the 1967 film Up the Down Staircase on TCM, and syndie reruns of Curb Your Enthusiasm from 2010-2011, it just uses the open-matted 2003 version of the then-current closing logo for Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nAs in the 2003 variant, the banner is sometimes slightly stretched.\n\nOn a S3 episode of The Jamie Foxx Show titled \"Taps For Royal\" from a recent Centric rerun, the text \"Distributed by\" is omitted, but just before the music from the Bent Outta Shape Productions and Foxx Hole Productions logos finishes out, it suddenly appears in its original position. As a result, this plasters the 1996 Telepictures Distribution logo that usually followed on syndie reruns. This also happens on George Lopez on a season 1 episode titled \"Who's Your Daddy?\".\n\nOn the series finale of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air titled \"I, Done\" in syndication, and TCM prints of Nancy Drew... Troubleshooter, the widescreen version of the 2003 logo is squashed to fit the 4:3 dimensions.\n\nA B&W version of the 2003 logo exists, which is seen on the series finale of Children's Hospital (\"The Grid\"), and some films on TCM.\n\nOn some shows, like TMZ and Extra, the logo fades in from black. On The Tyra Banks Show, the logo crossfades from the Telepictures logo.\n\nOn Lifechangers and 2020-2021 episodes of TMZ, the logo is part of the split screen credits.\n\nThe 2003 logo also sometimes shares the screen with other logos.\n\nOn Undercovers, the colors are more vivid.\n\nOn the Everwood episode \"East Meets West\", the colors are very light.\n\nOn the American version of The Tomorrow People, the colors are slightly brighter than the Undercovers variant.\n\nOn a TMZ Live demo reel, the banner reads \"DOMESTIC TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION\" instead.\n\nTechnique: A digital graphic.\n\nAudio: The 2nd part of the 1999 WB theme based on the song \"As Time Goes By\" from the WB film Casablanca, originally from the Broadway musical Everybody's Welcome. Some shows in association with WBTV had the theme cut in half or have the theme sped up. Like before, it's the closing theme of the show or none.\n\nAudio Trivia: The 2003 theme debuted on the series premiere of Two and a Half Men (as well as on the Eve episode \"Condom Mania\"), broadcast on September 22, 2003.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn network shows from 2003 to 2005 as well as episode 8 of season 1 of Cold Case on Universal Channel Asia, the 2003 WBTV fanfare is in mono. The strings are more prominent in this variation and the low brass note on the third note of the theme can barely be heard. All of Us continued using this variant until 2007.\n\nAn alternate version of the 2003 theme was used in the early days of the 2003 logo. This version had a faster tempo, a piano note at the beginning, and a slightly different ending.\n\nSometimes, the 1994 theme is used, sometimes shortened.\n\nOn an HBO Max print of episode 2 of The Jamie Foxx Show, the double-pitched version of the 1994 theme is heard.\n\nOn Smallville, one of the following themes is used:\n\nWhen the 2003 logo plasters the 2001 logo (4:3 prints retains the 2001 logo), the 1994 fanfare is used.\n\nOn 2006 season 5 episodes until the series finale, the 2003 theme is heard, carrying it from the then-current DC Comics logo.\n\nDue to reverse plastering over the next logo, some 2005 episodes of Smallville have the 2003 theme play over again (the first two notes are played over the DC Comics logo then it cuts to the 2003 logo with the theme starting over again).\n\nOn some re-runs of Friends, this plasters the 1994 logo; the closing theme of the TV show is heard, followed by the 1994 fanfare. Some occasions cut-off the closing theme, on some local airings.\n\nOn HBO Max prints and Warner TV Asia airings of season 4 of the aforementioned Friends, the 1998 theme is heard instead.\n\nHowever, on airings on certain local stations including WADL Detroit, the closing theme continues over this logo instead.\n\nThe 1998 theme is also heard on the 2003 logo on 1998 episodes of The Wayans Bros. on HBO, the final season of Murphy Brown on Nick at Nite, the last two episodes of Living Single on Max and on DVD prints of Mortal Kombat: Conquest.\n\nThe 1994 low tone WBTV theme is also heard on the short 2003 Warner Bros. Pictures logo.\n\nOn Children's Hospital, the music (usually just the last note) is cut off by the Williams Street logo.\n\nOn The Carrie Diaries, the last bit of the sped-up CBS Television Studios jingle can be heard before the sped-up version of the 2003 theme, which might've implied the WBTV theme was ripped straight out of The Vampire Diaries.\n\nOn HD prints of some episodes from Perfect Strangers and Step by Step along with syndicated prints of The New Adventures of Old Christine, the theme has a weird echo effect. This is due to a mixing error where only the rear surround channels are used.\n\nOn syndicated prints of The Jamie Foxx Show, the song \"Electrifying (Baby, That's Real)\" (likely Jamie Foxx's closing song) plays in the background throughout the entire four-way logo combo.\n\nStarting with the 6th episode of season 2 of Jane The Virgin, only the last note of the 2003 theme is heard.\n\nThe first two seasons of Arrow, the first four episodes of the American version of The Tomorrow People and the pilot of The Flash used a slowed down version of the 2003 theme.\n\nThe unaired pilot of Commando Nanny has the 2003 theme double pitched.\n\nOn Freddie, the 2003 theme is mixed between the first note and the last two notes.\n\nOn some episodes of Judge Mathis between 2012 and 2020, the echo of the last note of the Millar Gough Ink theme from late 2002 is heard over the first note of the 2003 WBTV theme, which also might've implied the aforementioned theme was ripped straight out of Smallville.\n\nOn Life Unexpected, the theme is even faster and mixed between the second note and the last note.\n\nMid-2000's TV Land airings of 1989-1992 episodes of Night Court use John Larroquette's voice over due to plastering the 6th logo.\n\nABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and post-2003 The WB (later The CW) used their generic themes.\n\nOn Hulu's print of the Living Single episode \"I'll Take Your Man\", Synclaire is heard saying \"Oh, Overton!\" on the distribution variant.\n\nOn the unaired pilot of Nolan Knows Best, Phil Nolan (played by Brian Dennehy) says \"Sex has a new name!\".\n\nOn the unaired pilot of Strange Brew, people angrily shouting is heard over the closing theme.\n\nAvailability:\n\nSeen on first-run syndication series such as The People's Court (until October 1, 2021, where it would be replaced with an in-credit notice of the 15th logo), Judge Mathis, TMZ on TV (until September 15, 2021 due to Fox Alternative Entertainment taking over), The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Extra (both until 2021 when it was replaced with the 15th logo), and also current network, cable and off-network shows such as Conan on TBS, George Lopez on Nick at Nite and Ion Television, The Jamie Foxx Show when it was last aired on Centric (before the rebrand to BET Her), The Wayans Bros. on MTV2, and on Max, Friends in local syndication, Max, TBS and Nick at Nite, Eve on TV One, ER (seasons 3-5 and 10-15) on Pop, Max, and on its DVD releases (seasons 2-5 and 10-15), The Real in local syndication and on BET, and on various shows on the Max streaming service, among others.\n\nIt is also seen on shows produced by Bonanza Productions (such as Mike & Molly, 2 Broke Girls and The 100), a division of WBTV that was founded in 1991, as they do not have their own logo.\n\nAny series from this era reran on TV One would keep the original logo intact.\n\nThe alternate theme can be found on various Hanna-Barbera and Lorimar shows on Max, All of Us, The Mullets, Run of the House, All About the Andersons, Like Family, Blue Collar TV, The Help, the first five episodes of season 2 of Eve, reruns of George Lopez, the director's cut of the Twenty Good Years pilot, the unaired pilots of Nikki and Nora and Starting Under, Full House on HBO Max and MeTV (except season 7, where the ending of the show's theme is heard underneath from plastering the 6th logo instead), some episodes of Veronica Mars, The Evidence, post-2020 reruns of The Flintstones on both Me-TV and Blu-ray, DVD and Blu-ray releases of The New Scooby-Doo Movies (also preserved on Blu-ray releases of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!), and was also seen on an RTE Two HD airing of The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries episode \"The Nutcracker Scoob\".\n\nThis variant is also preserved on streaming prints of Smallville S3 episode \"Phoenix\" as well as episode 7 of season 1 of Cold Case on Universal Channel Asia.\n\nThe 1994 theme can be found on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air episode \"Sleepless in Bel-Air\", Lifetime airings of Will & Grace and the TV movie Deadly Intentions...

Pictures\" logo with the low tone variant of the 1994 WBTV fanfare is preserved on shows like The Perils of Penelope Pitstop on former Boomerang U.S. airings, DVD releases and the Boomerang streaming service, the 1967 film Up the Down Staircase on TCM, and before syndie reruns of Curb Your Enthusiasm from 2010-2011.\n\nHowever, the MeTV Toons airings of the former uses the \"Distributed by\" variant of the 2003 WBTV logo with the low tone variant of the 1994 WBTV fanfare instead.\n\nThe \"Produced and Distributed by\" variant is seen on Jack and Bobby, Chase, Reign (season 1 and the first two episodes of season 2), and then-current episodes of The People's Court starting on the 2012-2013 season until the 2017-2018 season.\n\nThis variant is also seen on the 6th episode of Aliens in America (while it was produced by Warner Bros. Television, CBS Paramount was considered the distributor. Every other episode includes the regular \"Distributed by\" variant).\n\nThe final season (2004) of The Drew Carey Show also has the 2003 logo, and the WBTD version of this logo also plasters the 2001 logo on Laff airings of a special from said show, \"Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour\" (which also doubled as that show's S7 premiere episode).\n\nThis logo was also seen on the season 6 episodes of the first incarnation of Whose Line Is It Anyway? on ABC, while the last two seasons use the 2001 logo on ABC Family.\n\nThis logo was used in tandem with the 13th, 14th, and 15th logos until 2022.\n\nThe 14th logo replaced this logo starting with the 2018-2019 season, and this logo was still used in syndication until September 2021.\n\nHowever, due to Warner Bros. rebranding their on-screen logos with their 2019 print logo alongside the 13th logo from 2020-2023, this logo is retired.\n\nThis logo is also preserved on a Hulu print of the Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends episode \"Adoptcalypse Now\".\n\nThis logo also plasters the 1998 WB Family Entertainment logo at the start of Starz and Netflix prints of the 1998 theatrical film Quest for Camelot.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of HBO Max prints of Hangin' with Mr. Cooper.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of Tubi prints of the A Pup Named Scooby-Doo episode \"A Bicycle Built for Boo\", following the 1988 version of the 1986 Hanna-Barbera \"CGI Swirling Star\" logo.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the end of an HD print of A Flintstone Christmas (1977), following the 1974 Hanna-Barbera \"Rainbow H-B\" logo.\n\nThe silent variant of the 2003 WBTV logo is also seen at the start of the 1987 TV movie The Quick and the Dead on GREAT!
