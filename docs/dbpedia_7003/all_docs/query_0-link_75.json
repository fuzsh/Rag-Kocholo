        "text": "Mark Rosenberg, whose production credits include such box office hits as “The Fabulous Baker Boys,” “The Killing Fields,” “The World According to Garp” and “Bright Lights, Big City” died of a heart attack Friday morning in Stanton, Tex.\n\nA spokesman for Warner Bros., which distributes Spring Creek Productions, a company he formed with his wife, Paula Weinstein, said Rosenberg was on location with his latest film, “Flesh & Bone,” when he collapsed. He was 44 and made his home in Brentwood.\n\nRosenberg joined Warner Bros. in 1978 as a vice president of production and five years later became president of Worldwide Theatrical Production. It was during this period that he secured the rights to “The Killing Fields,” “Garp” and “Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes,” among other pictures.\n\nHe left Warner Bros. to form a partnership with Sydney Pollack at Mirage Productions and it was there that many of his successes were achieved.\n\nRosenberg and his wife started their company in 1989. Their other projects include “Fearless,” a drama to be released soon. He also had been executive producer of “Citizen Cohn,” the recent HBO film biography of Roy Cohn that starred James Woods.\n\nIn addition to his wife he is survived by his mother, Martha Wald of Passaic, N.J., and a brother, Alan.\n\nBurial will be in Passaic, where he was born, with a memorial service planned in Los Angeles.\n\nThe family asks that memorial contributions be made to the American Civil Liberties Union."
