        "text": "Over 70 movies are leaving Netflix on the first of the month.\n\nKasey Moore · @kasey__moore\n\nWelcome to another big rundown on everything set to leave Netflix, specifically in the United States, during July 2024. We’ll be covering all the movie and series whether they be licensed or Original titles set to expire.\n\nFor the first of the month, you’ll notice that many of the classic 1984 movies that were added on April 1st as part of Netflix’s “Milestone Movies” initiative are set to leave. These are only added on short-term licenses, and the next batch will be arriving on July 1st, which all were released in 1994. Pulp Fiction incoming!\n\nWe typically get word of removals around 30 days ahead of their departure. Netflix then releases its own abbreviated list of departures in the final couple weeks of the preceding month.\n\nMissed any of the June 2024 departures?
