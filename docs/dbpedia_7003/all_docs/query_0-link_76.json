Discovery (WBD) has revealed a first-look deal with industry veteran Jack Nguyen, with a Korean remake of the 2015 comedy-drama “The Intern” set as the inaugural project. The agreement, made through Nguyen’s JOAT Films, focuses on Asia-centric film projects, particularly local-language remakes of WBD’s English-language titles.\n\nNguyen will collaborate with local partners across the Asia-Pacific region, including Korea and India. Kurt Rieder, senior VP, head of theatrical distribution, APAC, WBD, highlighted the strong appetite for Hollywood story remakes in the region.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nBoomerang Cartoon Streaming Service Is Being Shut Down by Warner Bros.

His career includes overseeing productions such as “Letters from Iwo Jima,” the “Rurouni Kenshin” franchise and “The Age of Shadows.”\n\nNguyen said: “It should come as no surprise that I have a great deal of respect and loyalty to Warner Bros. after spending the majority of my career there. I’m honored to be entrusted with some of their valuable IP to produce high-quality local language remakes with the best filmmakers in those countries. In addition, I want to showcase new and talented filmmakers by finding ‘diamond in the rough’ projects that deserve attention on the world stage.”\n\nSeparately, Nguyen serves as an executive producer on Korea’s Anthology Studios and India’s Panorama Studios’ remake of the Indian “Drishyam” franchise in Korea.\n\nDOCS DELIGHT\n\nBusan Int’l Film Fest is rolling out a new Documentary Audience Award for its Wide Angle – Documentary competition.

Cases include a victim adorned with chicken feathers and a reindeer antler hat, and a woman suspended by her hair.\n\nVeteran host Tai Chih-yuan makes his return to series acting after a decade, portraying a serial killer who stages crime scenes as Chinese idiom puzzles. Directors Cheng Wei-hao and Yin Chen-hao revealed that Tai’s character introduction, featuring him in a straitjacket and muzzle, pays homage to Hannibal Lecter.\n\nThe cast includes members from the YouTube series “Muyao 4 Super Playing” and singer-songwriter Huang Hsuan.\n\n“GG Precinct” follows the success of “Marry My Dead Body,” which has entered Netflix’s Global Top 10 TV (Non-English) Film charts in several Asian markets and was Taiwan’s submission for the 2024 Academy Awards.\n\nThe series joins a lineup of Taiwanese content on Netflix in 2024, including “Let’s Talk About CHU” and “The Victim’s Game,” the platform’s first renewed Chinese-language production.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in August 2024\n\nWhat's Coming to Netflix in August 2024"
