        "text": "The debut last month of Warner Archive Instant, a new streaming video service from Warner Brothers, stimulated some strong reactions on Internet movie discussion sites. Costing $9.99 a month, $2 more than the established services, and with an initial inventory of only a few hundred old movies — many of them in black and white and some (shudder) even without spoken dialogue — what kind of Netflix killer was this supposed to be?\n\nNot a very good one, obviously. But that was never what George Feltenstein, Warner’s senior vice president for theatrical catalog marketing and the driving force behind the initiative, had in mind.\n\n“As a consumer who has a houseful of old movies on discs and still can’t get enough,” Mr. Feltenstein said in a phone interview, “my needs were not being met by the mainstream services. The kind of movies I wanted to watch weren’t there. I thought a lot of people would be like me.”\n\nWhen the industry was rocked a few years ago by diminishing sales of new films on DVD, it was Mr. Feltenstein who found a way to keep his studio’s backlist alive and working. Rather than going through the traditional (and costly) route of retailing mass-produced, machine-pressed DVDs, Mr. Feltenstein turned to an alternative form of distribution: the manufactured-on-demand disc."
