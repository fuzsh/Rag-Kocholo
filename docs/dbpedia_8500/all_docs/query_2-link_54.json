The types of research questions that my lab addresses typically are guided by ecological concepts that are used as a framework to evaluate conservation questions. Two general areas of emphasis that my lab is pursuing are: (1) understanding the direct and indirect impacts of anthropogenic development on vertebrate species (greater sage-grouse and ungulates as model taxa) inhabiting sagebrush habitats, and (2) evaluating the efficacy of mitigation techniques and conservation practices intended to enhance habitat conditions or mitigate effects of anthropogenic development in sagebrush habitats. In all studies we seek to understand responses of habitat restoration efforts across a range of spatial and temporal scales to better inform conservation practices.\n\nNicole Bedford\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nEmail: anelso74@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents:\n\nThe Bedford Lab works at the intersection of evolutionary biology and systems neuroscience to understand the genetic and neural basis of behavior. As a model neural circuit, we use voluntary micturition, or the decision of when and where to urinate. Micturition is an essential physiological process that expels waste and maintains water balance, but many species also use urine marks as a form of social communication. Both laboratory and wild mice show considerable natural variation in aggression, territoriality, and scent marking behavior. We combine laboratory and field studies to uncover how differences in micturition arise both within and among species.\n\nMerav Ben-David\n\nProfessor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: bendavid@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Braden Godwin, Christina Sluka\n\nAlumni: Adi Barocas, Jamie Crait, Carolyn Eckrich, Kristina Harkins, Eric Quallen, John Whiteman\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy main interest revolves around the interaction between animal behavioral ecology, population dynamics, and ecosystem function. I mainly study carnivores and use the transport of nutrient from sea to land as a model system. To study those interactions, I use isotopic and genetic tracers. For example, I investigate the effects of trade-off between nutritional requirements and risk of infanticide on consumption of salmon by female brown bears, and how female decisions made based on this trade-off influence the transfer of salmon-derived nutrients to terrestrial vegetation.\n\nRiley Bernard\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: rbernar5@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudent: Renee Lile\n\nAlumni:\n\nTop of Page\n\nIs an applied wildlife ecologist and Assistant Professor in the Department of Zoology and Physiology at the University of Wyoming. Her research focuses on the ecology and behavior of small mammals and amphibians on topics such as foraging, competition, invasive species interactions, the effects of disease on community structure, species susceptibility and survival. She also uses tools from Decision Science to ensure the questions she seeks to answer provide the best information for wildlife and natural resource managers to make tractable and robust decisions.\n\nHas conducted research in a number of countries, including Australia, Costa Rica, Cambodia, Puerto Rico, and throughout the United States.\n\nMatt Carling\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: mcarling@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Libby Megna\n\nAlumni: Shawn Billerman, Paul Dougherty\n\nTop of Page\n\nResearch in my lab focuses on understanding the processes of speciation and adaptation in birds. While we focus primarily on these questions from a genetic perspective, we must also consider the environments inhabited by the birds we study. Current projects include: 1) a detailed dissection of gene flow and introgression across the hybrid zone between Lazuli (Passerina ameona) and Indigo (Passerina cyanea) buntings; 2) a broad comparative hybrid zone study focusing on a number of avian species pairs that hybridize in the Great Plains (e.g. Passerina buntings, Icterus orioles, and Pipilo towhees); 3) patterns of functional differentiation in Tachycineta swallows; and 4) a investigation of the impact of extreme environments (high elevation, high latitude) on the evolution of mitochondrial genes.\n\nAnna Chalfoun\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nWyoming Cooperative Fish & Wildlife Research Unit\n\nE-mail: achalfou@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Emily Shertzer\n\nAlumni: Gabriel Barrile, Jason Carlisle, Katherine Gura, Embere Hall\n\nTop of Page\n\nI study wildlife-habitat relationships and the ecological, behavioral, and evolutionary processes underlying patterns in habitat use and quality at multiple spatial scales. My lab is currently focused on the influence of anthropogenic changes to habitats (e.g., via oil and natural gas extraction) on non-game wildlife species including songbirds, small mammals and herpetofauna, especially within sagebrush systems. My work has also focused on broad scale life history patterns and avian parental care behaviors.\n\nDave Christianson\n\nAssociate Professor, Departments of Ecosystem Science and Management\n\nEmail: david.christianson@uwyo.edu\n\nStudents: Laura Diakiw, Jeffrey Wagner\n\nI explore the interaction between top-down, bottom-up, and environmental effects on individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems to better understand our world, provide better answers to stakeholders, and to train the next generation of thinkers and problem-solvers.\n\nMark Clementz\n\nProfessor, Department of Geology and Geophysics\n\nE-mail: mclemen1@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nAlumni: Morgan Churchill\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research interests center on understanding the ecological relationships among organisms within ancient ecosystems. For the past several years, I have been particularly interested in the study of the evolutionary ecology of marine mammals including sirenians (e.g., manatees, dugongs) and cetaceans (e.g., whales, dolphins, porpoises). The primary tools I use for this research are stable isotope analyses of the inorganic and organic fraction of fossil remains, which can provide information on the diet and habitat preferences of extinct organisms that might not be interpretable from the morphology or depositional setting. Recently, an increasing component of my research has included work in modern marine and terrestrial ecosystems as a means of testing interpretations of geochemical results from fossil remains. Two examples of these projects include a long term study of the feeding habits of manatees in the Indian River Lagoon of Florida and analysis of lifetime feeding habits and nutritional ecology of desert tortoises in the Sonoran and Mojave Deserts with colleagues at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park.\n\nTim Collier\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Ecosystem Science and Management\n\nE-mail: tcollier@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Alexis Hollander, Megan Wilson\n\nAlumni: Rebecca Upjohn\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research encompasses the theoretical and applied aspects of insect ecology and biological control, the use of living organisms to control insect pests and weeds. A current research focus is the behavioral and population ecology of host specificity in insects used as weed biological control agents. The primary question is: what behavioral and ecological factors influence host specificity and impact of biological control agents in the field? The key goal is to maximize impact on the weed and minimize impact on native, non-target species. A second area of research involves interactions among parasitoid wasps used in biological control of Hawaiian fruit fly pests. Here the key issue is coexistence of competing species, and direct and indirect interactions in parasitoid-host food webs.\n\nSarah Collins\n\nAssistant Professor, Departments of Zoology and Physiology\n\nEmail: sarah.collins@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Linnea Rock\n\nTop of Page\n\nResearch in my lab focuses on freshwater ecosystem ecology, including elemental cycling, food web dynamics and their relevance to applied water quality issues. We ask questions about ecological patterns and processes through field studies in a variety of temperate and tropical ecosystems. In addition to field projects, I participate in several synthesis groups about freshwater ecosystems at regional to continental scales, which include collaborations with computer scientists and statisticians. Overall, work in my lab aims to develop the approaches and concepts to understand how accelerating human-driven changes in terrestrial landscapes and climate are reflected in aquatic ecosystems at local to continental scales.\n\nEllen Currano\n\nProfessor, Departments of Botany and Geology/Geophysics\n\nEmail: ecurrano@uwyo.edu\n\nStudents: Matt Butrim, Claudia Richbourg\n\nAlumni: Lauren Azevelo-Schmidt\n\nTop of Page\n\nI am a paleoecologist who uses fossil plants to investigate the response of ancient forest ecosystems to environmental perturbations. Specifically, how did environmental changes affect taxonomic diversity, ecosystem structure, plant-insect interactions, and biogeographic patterns? By understanding how ecosystems reacted to past changes, we can better predict how modern ecosystems will respond to anthropogenic changes like CO2-induced global warming. The research conducted in my lab is field-based, specimen-based, and collaborative. Current research focuses on: 1) biotic response to climate changes during the hothouse Paleogene in the Western US, particularly Wyoming, and 2) the evolution of East African terrestrial ecosystems over the last 30 million years. Outreach activities include co-founding The Bearded Lady Project: Challenging the Face of Science, a documentary film and photography project that investigates our stereotypes of what a field scientist looks like.\n\nMichael Dillon\n\nProfessor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nEmail: michael.dillon@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Craig Garzella, Ellen Keaveny, Sarah Waybright, Sabrina White\n\nAlumni: Susma Giri, Kennan Oyen\n\nTop of Page\n\nI am broadly interested how physiology dictates interactions of organisms with their environments. In my group, we combine field work with laboratory experiments and modeling to study physiological ecology primarily of insects, which are diverse morphologically, evolutionarily, and physiologically and thrive in all environments on earth. Some current projects include: flight and thermal physiology of alpine bumblebees, overwintering physiology of native bees, and the effects of fine scale spatial and temporal variation in climate on organism physiology and ecology.\n\nBrent Ewers\n\nProfessor, Department of Botany\n\nE-mail: beewers@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Tim Aston, Trevor Bloom, Bridger Huhn\n\nAlumni: Julia Angstmann, John Frank, Kusum Naithani, David Reed, Heather Speckman\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe main question driving Dr. Brent E. Ewers laboratory’s research is how does plant physiology control fluxes of mass and energy at scales ranging from plant organs to landscapes. Ongoing projects investigate a wide range of nonvascular, woody and herbaceous plants inhabiting near-pristine, heavily disturbed, crops and controlled environments. Brent's lab leads or collaborates on current projects investigating bark beetle-induced mortality impacts on forest ecosystem processes, influence of vegetation on the hydrological cycle and the role of genetics in plant responses to stress.\n\nWilliam Fetzer\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: wfetzer@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Jordan Brewin, Kaitlyn McKnight\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research interests lie at the interface of basic and applied research and I aim to answer questions directly relevant to the management and conservation of fisheries and freshwater ecosystems. Specifically, I am interested in spatial and temporal responses of aquatic food webs to anthropogenic perturbations, such as climate change, invasive species, and eutrophication. I use multiple approaches and incorporate diverse sources of information to evaluate how direct and indirect drivers interact to drive complex, often unexpected outcomes. To ensure that my science is applicable to conservation, management and policy development, I directly engage and communicate my findings to stakeholders, managers, and policy makers.\n\nMy ecological research themes include:Animal, Aquatic, Ecosystems, Isotope Tracers, Organismal, Population and Community\n\nTucker J. Furniss\n\nAssistant Professor, Ecosystem Science & Management\n\nEmail: tucker.furniss@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Brittany Hays\n\nMy research focuses on forests, tree mortality, and disturbance ecology of western landscapes. He uses a combination of field-based longitudinal monitoring, remote sensing, and process-based simulation models to understand how climate, management, and ecological processes are influencing the structure, function, and resilience of forest ecosystems. Tucker is motivated by a deep passion for our western forests and is devoted to producing research that informs science-based management and policy on public lands.\n\nSara Germain\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Botany\n\nEmail: sgermain@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Sheryl Cramer, Jared Friedman, Kelly Goodwin\n\nMy research blends dendroecological techniques with community ecology to understand how mechanisms of individual tree survival give rise to forest change, particularly in response to climate and climate-altered disturbance regimes. Currently, my field sites include ForestGEO demography plots in and Grand Teton, WY; Yosemite, CA; Wind River, WA; and Cedar Breaks, UT. Here, I identify proximate causes of tree mortality - including bark beetles, invasive pathogens, and fire - and then integrate these observations with fine-scale maps of forest composition, structure, edaphic features, and measurements of tree anatomical characteristics. This field-based approach lends to an empirical understanding of 1) how forest communities and disturbances are changing, 2) the climatological and environmental conditions structuring that change, and 3) attributes that impart resistance and resilience across individual, population, and community scales. Part of what we're finding is that climate change is contributing to novel interactions between trees, tree enemies, and tree mutualists - many of which are responsible for vast changes in forest cover across the western USA. Whether and at what pace these dynamics are giving rise to permanent ecosystem state changes is a primary research question in my lab.\n\nJacob Goheen\n\nProfessor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: jgoheen@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Annabella Helman, Leo Khasoha, Dedan Ngatia, Douglas Njeri\n\nAlumni: Abdullahi Ali, Jesse Alston, Brett Jesmer\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research interests lie at the nexus of conservation biology and community ecology. Currently, I am devoted to two research programs: 1) examining how the loss of megaherbivores and other wildlife affects rangeland dynamics in savanna ecosystems through the Ungulate Herbivory Under Rainfall Uncertainty (UHURU); and 2) investigating the interplay between community saturation and human disturbances across wildlife assemblages. Graduate projects in my research group span a breadth of topics, and include precipitation and herbivory as filters to plant community assembly, foraging efficiency/risk tradeoffs in herbivores, community- and ecosystem-level consequences of wildlife restoration in Mozambique, small mammal responses to ungulate extirpations, and landscape change and conservation of a globally-endangered antelope in northeastern Kenya.\n\nJoe Holbrook\n\nAssistant Professor, Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources & Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nEmail: joe.holbrook@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research focuses on an integration of population and community ecology. Three main questions underpin this focus: (1) Why are animals where they are?, (2) How does environmental change influence animals?, and (3) What roles do animals fulfill within the broader ecological community? In addition, I am keenly interested in the interaction between humans and the environment, which has large implications for policy, land management, and conservation solutions. These broad interests necessarily require diverse partnerships, datasets, and analytical techniques. Indeed, my partners and I are continually looking for ways to integrate concepts and approaches to gain additional insight and identify conservation opportunities. I generally work with mammalian carnivores, which have spanned from jaguarundis and badgers within rangelands to Canada lynx, wolverine, and mountain lions within forests. Applied issues motivate my work, but I strive to place these questions within a strong theoretical foundation to advance both management and science.\n\nKristina Hufford\n\nAssociate Professor, Department of Ecosystem Science and Management\n\nE-mail: khufford@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe primary focus of my laboratory is the study of the consequences of community and population-level variation for the long-term sustainability of restored plant communities. I am an evolutionary ecologist with interests in conservation and restoration. My research is focused on the adaptation of plant populations to local environments, and the implications of adaptive variation for the restoration of native plant communities. I study spatial and temporal patterns of selection using techniques in field ecology, molecular genetics and bioinformatics. Topics of interest include the spatial scale of local adaptation, and the fitness consequences of intraspecific hybridization among wild plant populations. I am also interested in pursuing questions that link population-level studies to larger geographic scales and trophic interactions.\n\nMatthew Kauffman\n\nProfessor, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nLeader, Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit\n\nE-mail: mkauffm1@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Luke Wilde\n\nAlumni: Ellen Aikens, Brett Jesmer, Doug Keinath, Arthur Middleton, Anna Ortega\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research interests range from demography and population dynamics of animal species, to community-level consequences of herbivory and predation, and landscape ecology of wildlife populations. A common theme of much of my work is a desire to connect ecological research with applied conservation issues, particularly regarding animal populations. Some recent projects have evaluated the management and recovery of peregrine falcons, the effects of range management on carnivores in southern Africa, the dynamics of elk populations, and trophic interactions among wolves, elk and aspen. Much of my current work, and that of my students, is focused on the ecology and management of Rocky Mountain ungulates and their predators. Nevertheless, interesting ecological questions that have a bearing on real-world conservation will always capture my interest regardless of taxa or study system. As the Assistant Unit Leader for Wildlife at the Wyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit, my research program also addresses the priority needs of state and federal wildlife managers. Consequently, students in my lab often work closely with wildlife managers outside of academia.\n\nPatrick Kelley\n\nResearch Scientist, Assistant, Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: patrick.kelley@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents:\n\nResearch Interests: Animal Behavior, Behavioral Ecology, Ecological Statistics.\n\nResearch Summary: The Behavioral Complexity Lab is broadly interested in how environments shape individual behavior and how these behaviors impact vulnerability to selective agents (such as climate or predation). Focusing mainly on tropical birds in Panama and Hawaii (but branching out into other taxa such as jumping spiders too), our lab research integrates intensive field-based studies of multiple taxa, quantitative behavioral analysis (especially bioacoustics), physiology (primarily stress hormones), artificial intelligence, and traditional ecological modeling to explore the interplay between natural selection and complex phenotypes. To this end, the lab explores novel ways (causal AI, deep-learning) to detect and measure complex behaviors that form the basis of fundamental ecological phenomena such as competition and predation.\n\nCorrine \"Corrie\" Knapp\n\nAssociate Professor, Environment and Society\n\nCenter for Climate, Water, and People\n\nHaub School of Environment and Natural Resources\n\nEmail: corrie.knapp@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents:\n\nMy research interests are at the confluence of climate change, conservation & livelihoods. Using a social-ecological approach, she works in climate change adaptation, local and indigenous knowledge, sense of place, and conservation innovation.

For example, I study the role of ecological stoichiometry in the success of the non-native New Zealand mud snail and the ecological and evolutionary consequences of the introduction of lake trout to zooplankton in Yellowstone Lake. Using snail- trematode interactions, I also study the consequences of parasitism to the evolution of host-life histories and how varying the stoichiometry of food alters the outcome of snail-trematode interactions.\n\nDaniel Laughlin\n\nProfessor, Department of Botany\n\nEmail: daniel.laughlin@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: David Atkins, Jesse Fleri, Hailey Mount\n\nAlumni: Alice Stears\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe Laughlin research lab develops quantitative approaches to understand and predict how plant communities respond to global change. We develop trait-based models that translate ecological processes into statistical frameworks to predict how communities assemble along environmental gradients and how species interact at local scales. The goal for these models is not only to gain a deeper understanding of basic ecological processes, but also to inform the restoration of degraded ecosystems.\n\nRongsong Liu\n\nProfessor, Departments of Mathematics and Zoology and Physiology\n\nE-mail: rliu1@uwyo.edu\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research interests are mathematical biology, differential equations, dynamical systems, and their interface. My research projects involve formulation, analysis and applications of deterministic mathematical models for infectious diseases and ecological systems. The models are aimed to answer questions and help gain useful insights for the biological systems being investigated. Based on the theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we describe useful quantitative behaviors of model solutions and tackle which factors are most important in determining these behaviors. Together with collaborating biologists, we provide biological interpretations of the mathematical results, as insights and predictions. From time to time, we need to develop new or improve existing mathematical theories and techniques to provide satisfactory solutions to questions posed by collaborating biologists.\n\nJeffrey A.

I am a paleoecologist who works primarily on arid and semi-arid ecosystems (deserts to forests) in western North America and how those ecosystems respond to prolonged climate change like drought and to short-term disturbances like floods and fires. The primary tool I use for analyzing past ecosystem dynamics is pollen, macrobotanical remains and charcoal deposited on and contained within lake and wetland sediments. My lab currently has projects looking at the interactions between climate forcing and changes in stable states of desert wetland and grassland. I am investigating the resilience of western forests to prolonged drought (century to millennial scale) that may be coupled with changes in fire-regimes as possible analogs to future forest dynamics under climate change scenarios.\n\nKevin Monteith\n\nProfessor, Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources and Department of Zoology and Physiology\n\nWyoming Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit\n\nEmail: kevin.monteith@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nAlumni: Ellen Aikens, Tayler LaSharr, Rachel Smiley\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research program is focused on integrating nutritional ecology with intensive field studies of large ungulates to elucidate the mechanisms that underpin behavior, growth, reproductive allocation, predator-prey dynamics, and ultimately, the factors affecting population growth.

The goal of my research is to address complex ecosystem dynamics, focusing on biodiversity (distribution and abundance) and functional connectivity in areas of management and conservation concern. My objective is to incorporate ecological research and alternative management scenarios to assess sustainability. While most of my current work focuses on amphibians and related ecological systems, I have experience with a broad range of taxonomic groups and their related ecological systems: carnivores, ungulates, small mammals, birds, and a coniferous plant. I expect build a research program addressing a broad range of taxonomic groups with a focus on rangeland systems. I have three major interrelated areas of research: 1) Ecosystem Biodiversity - ecological and anthropogenic processes and how they constrain species distributions, 2) Functional Connectivity - system connectivity and how it limits population persistence, and 3) Landscape Change - impact of alternative future landscape conditions on ecosystem sustainability.\n\nAdam C.

As a biogeochemist I am drawn toward understanding the linkages between belowground N and C cycling and ecosystem functions. I am interested in agroecological principles governing sustainable food production in time of diminishing natural resources and environmental change and the short and long-term consequences of climate variability on ecosystems services. In my research approach I investigate a variety of soil, air and plant indices that are most sensitive to environmental change such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide) and labile and stable organic matter pools. Methodologies I often employ include GHG measurements, assays for determining potentially mineralizable C and N, and gross rates of mineralization using 15N enrichment techniques. I am currently involved in the following projects: (1) Quantifying the impact of a massive bark beetle outbreak on carbon, water and nutrient cycling and regeneration of southern Wyoming lodgepole pine forests; (2) Development and transfer of conservation agriculture production systems for small-holder farms in eastern Uganda and western Kenya; (3) Effects of cropping-system, irrigation method, and soil properties on soil nitrogen and organic matter dynamics in the Big Horn Basin; and, (4) Economic and environmental sustainability of conventional, reduced-input, and organic approaches on western crop-range-livestock farms.\n\nFrank J.

My graduate students and I are addressing issues of fish habitat use and movement patterns in regards to both large spatial scales and patchiness. We are interested in what constitutes a habitat patch, how patches are rearranged by disturbances such as floods, and what factors influence fish movement among patches. Another area of interest is the homogenization of aquatic biota across the world through habitat alteration and species introductions. Much of our research involves species of conservation concern including native trout and nongame fishes such as native minnows in prairie streams. One of our current projects in this area involves the role of irrigation canals as a population sink for cutthroat trout.\n\nLauren G.

In particular, I have been using geologic evidence to study how the water levels of lakes in North America have changed over centuries to millennia during the past 15,000 years, and am comparing these records of past moisture levels with fossil and geochemical evidence of past vegetation, disturbances, and other ecosystem phenomena. In doing so, I seek to understand how ecosystems from the landscape- to continental-scale respond to climate change. By comparing lake-level data from across the continent, I am also examining the climatic processes that cause moisture fluctuations through time. Students working with me have worked on 1) paleoclimate reconstruction and diagnosing the causes of past climate changes, 2) vegetation and fire history reconstruction and examining the role of disturbance (fire) for mediating vegetation responses to climate change, 3) spatially-explicit landscape modeling of past ecosystem changes, and 4) improving our understanding of the sedimentary and geochemical record of past environmental change.\n\nRamesh Sivanpillai\n\nResearch Scientist, Departments of Botany and Ecosystem Science and Management\n\nWyoming Geographic Information Sciences Center\n\nEmail: Sivan@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nTop of Page\n\nMy research focuses on mapping vegetation types and monitoring vegetation condition and land cover change using remotely sensed data.

Examples of projects my laboratory group studies include how a rare, endemic beetle survives in harsh water quality, interactions between insects and wind facilities, nutrient dynamics in Yellowstone Lake while suppressing invasive lake trout, using aquatic invertebrates to assess ecosystem quality, limiting factors throughout the lifecycle of mussels, parasitism in bumble bees, the role rare plants play in pollination networks, changes in ice phenology under a changing climate and best methods to monitor rare pollinators. I use a variety of tools including isotopes, nutrients, statistics, modeling, mark recapture and others.

Traditionally, the evolution of quantitative traits has been described using statistical genetic techniques. However, one of the greatest advantages of these approaches is also one of their primary limitations: it is possible to estimate genetic variation and covariation in traits without any direct knowledge of the underlying loci or molecular genetic details. In like fashion, it is possible to estimate the pattern of natural selection on quantitative traits in the absence of knowledge of loci that determine fitness. Advances in collecting and analyzing molecular data promise to reveal the molecular genetic basis of quantitative trait variation. In our lab, we focus on understanding genetic mechanisms of adaptation to competition, the role of the circadian clock in competitive responses and in adaptation to seasonal settings, and the genetic basis of quantitative variation in floral morphology. In sum, our work spans the fields of ecology, evolution, and genetics.\n\nTopher Weiss-Lehman\n\nAssistant Professor, Department of Botany\n\nE-mail: cweissle@uwyo.edu\n\nStudents: Qingyu Gan, Spencer Holtz\n\nTop of Page\n\nResearch in my lab broadly focuses on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of global change. In recent decades, scientists have begun to better understand both the magnitude of changes humans are imposing on the planet and the capacity of populations to evolve rapidly in response to novel selection pressures. I am particularly interested in the spatial dynamics of these phenomena, such as range expansions (as with invasive species) or range shifts due to climate change. Research in the lab combines theoretical models with laboratory experiments using the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum), a classic model organism for both ecology and evolution. Using this approach, we aim to better understand how rapid evolution might affect species’ responses to global change, and thus inform future conservation efforts.\n\nDavid Williams\n\nProfessor, Department of Botany\n\nE-mail: dgw@uwyo.edu | Web Page\n\nStudents: Emmanuel Komolafe, Yasaman Shakeri\n\nAlumni: Janet Chen, Jiemin Guo, Abigail Hoffman\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe Williams lab investigates plant-environment interactions in terrestrial environments of the world with particular focus on savannas, grasslands and deserts.
