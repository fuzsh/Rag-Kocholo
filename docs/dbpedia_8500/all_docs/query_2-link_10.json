        "text": "The following is a list of space opera media. Space opera is a subgenre of science fiction that David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer define as \"colorful, dramatic, large-scale science fiction adventure, competently and sometimes beautifully written, usually focused on a sympathetic, heroic central character and plot action, and usually set in the relatively distant future, and in space or on other worlds, characteristically optimistic in tone. It often deals with war, piracy, military virtues, and very large-scale action, large stakes.\"[1]\n\nThe following are works that independent commentators have characterized as space opera, ordered chronologically by date of first publication.\n\nThese are works of print media.\n\nA True Story ( c. 150) by Lucian of Samosata\n\nEdison's Conquest of Mars (1898) by Garrett P.
