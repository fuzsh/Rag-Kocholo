        "text": "INTRODUCTION:\n\nA BLUEPRINT FOR BETTER DREAMS\n\nEd Finn and Kathryn Cramer\n\nWELCOME TO PROJECT HIEROGLYPH, founded by Neal Stephenson and produced by Arizona State University’s Center for Science and the Imagination. Our purpose here is to rekindle grand technological ambitions through the power of storytelling. Audacious projects like the Great Pyramids, the Hoover Dam, or a moon landing didn’t just happen by accident. Someone had to imagine them and create a narrative that brought that vision to life for others. They are dreams that became real not because they were easy, but because they were hard. The editors firmly believe that if we want to create a better future, we need to start with better dreams. Big dreams—infectious, inclusive, optimistic dreams—are the vital first step to catalyzing real change in the world. As it turns out, sometimes that dreamer is a writer of fiction, often science fiction.\n\nIt all started in 2011. Neal Stephenson was on a panel called Future Tense with ASU’s president, Michael Crow. Stephenson had recently published Innovation Starvation, his preface to this volume, and onstage he was talking about how dystopian our visions of the future are, and how we seem to have lost sight of our ability to think and do big stuff: the Apollo program, national infrastructure projects, and the microchip, for example. Crow responded that maybe it’s the science fiction writers who are letting us down by failing to conjure up grand, ambitious futures that will inspire us to get out there and make them real. The two began to discuss how we might get science fiction writers actively involved in shaping the future in a persistent, organized way.\n\nThat conversation launched both the Center for Science and the Imagination and Project Hieroglyph, two initiatives with a shared goal: get people thinking creatively and ambitiously about the future. We see this mission as having two interlocking halves. First, we need to share a broader sense of agency about the future. It’s not something people in white coats are cooking up in a lab somewhere. Whether we consciously accept it or not, we are all making choices that shape the future we are creating together. Second, we need to become more comfortable with the tools we have for envisioning that future. The university is a particularly good place to see that imagination is the key to moving forward in every discipline, even though the language of professionalism in many of them forbids or discourages unorthodox thinking. So it is our hope that the center, founded and directed by Ed Finn, becomes a vehicle for radical thought experiments, odd conversations, and mind-blowing prototypes and, most important, a venue in which anyone can take intellectual risks.\n\nIf the center is the mission control system, Project Hieroglyph is the spacecraft: our first effort to explore the ragged edge of human knowledge and potential. Stephenson assembled a small group of fellow writers interested in taking on the challenge. He also recruited Kathryn Cramer, who has edited Year’s Best Science Fiction annuals for a decade and who has expertise in hard science fiction. She joined Finn as coeditor and together, we broadened the group to the mix of writers in the current volume. We sought a diverse group with a mix of stylistic, political, and technological viewpoints, including several celebrated science fiction authors who have been writing this kind of technically grounded, optimistic, near-future fiction for years. Project Hieroglyph also leverages an incredible network of people ranging from undergraduates to leading technologists, scientists, and visionaries who are ready to think seriously, and boldly, about the futures we want to realize.\n\nWhile this network includes scientists and engineers working on very real stuff, our brand of imagination does not reject or edge away from its origins in science fiction. Rather we embrace the power of what science and technology writer Clive Thompson calls the last great literature of ideas to open new doors, to ask difficult questions, and to inspire. A good science fiction story can share an iconic vision with millions of people. Isaac Asimov’s robots, Robert Heinlein’s rocket ships, and William Gibson’s cyberspace shaped not just real technologies but the whole cultural frame around them. Such science fiction stories created a kind of indelible symbol, a hieroglyphic imprint that has endured in popular imagination. This variety and range of approaches is crucial to breaking the mold of the status quo future and exploring the full spectrum of possibility for our species in the next few generations.\n\nTo explore those possibilities, Project Hieroglyph connects writers with scientists and engineers so they can identify compelling new moonshot ideas. A moonshot idea is the intersection of a huge problem, a radical solution, and a breakthrough discovery that makes the solution possible now or in the near future. Our challenge to the Hieroglyph community is to develop ideas that could be realized within one professional lifetime and implement technologies that exist today or will exist in the near future. No magic wands, hyperspace drives, or galaxies far, far away—just big ideas about how the world could be very different with a few small adjustments.\n\nThe project’s home at the center puts the resources of a world-class, ambitiously experimental research university behind our work. While it is not new for science fiction writers to consult scientists—and a number of science fiction writers are themselves scientists—this is the first time that we know of that a university has aggressively recruited its faculty members to further the project of visionary science fiction.\n\nWriters, researchers, and others are talking online, in person, and on the phone, creating a rich feedback loop between science and storytelling. The living, beating heart of Project Hieroglyph is this extended community, and the set of conversations, brainstorms, and debates that shaped the stories in this book.\n\nScience fiction has always been an idea-driven literature that inspires people to become scientists and engineers. And a major part of the job of being a science fiction writer is coming up with ideas good enough, or entertaining enough, to allow for the willing suspension of disbelief, inviting a group of readers in to share the dream. Our key task as editors has been to cultivate stories that would take this further, shepherding ecosystems of interest and innovation around radical ideas. We hope that framing these challenges in an exciting, accessible way will spark some real solutions.\n\nOne of the pleasures in this project has been to see several of our science fictions preempted by real research, such as funding for moon printers (NASA and the European Space Agency) and plans for the use of commercial drones (Amazon, among others). Additionally, the collaborations involved in the creation of these stories have launched new avenues of research: for example, Stephenson’s Tall Tower raises research questions about wind patterns and electrical activity in the upper atmosphere. In years to come, we aim to continue troubling the boundary between fiction and serious research by seed funding scientific investigations, recruiting more collaborators to the Project Hieroglyph community, and refining our hybrid process for prototyping dreams.\n\nIn a traditional anthology, we’d spend a few paragraphs summarizing the general run of stories in the book. Instead we suggest you browse the author notes, commentary, and further reading we have curated for each story on the Project Hieroglyph site (hieroglyph.asu.edu). There you will discover the collaborations, conversations, and technical research authors conducted to create their stories. The problems they tackle range from standbys like interstellar travel to more earthly challenges such as climate change and social justice. (What happens when we treat social injustice not as a symptom of technological innovation, but rather ask how social structures themselves could be radically improved?) In many of these thought experiments, some form of empathy is a key element to the solution of large-scale technological problems. Fiction is a sandbox not just for the future, but for understanding one another. Big problems can be solved only when we work together.\n\nThese stories are not the end of our project, but the beginning. This is a sketchbook for the future, with ideas we hope will leap off the page and into real life. This collection of thought experiments, pointed questions, and napkin proofs is backed by research in fields from neuroscience to robotics, from behavioral science to structural engineering. We hope this volume reflects our ambitions. Following the trails blazed here back to the Project Hieroglyph site will lead you to new ideas, technical research, interviews, illustrations, and vibrant discussions. And better dreams.\n\nWe hope that Project Hieroglyph will inspire you to join in and help us imagine the way things could be. Think of this book as a blueprint, a manifesto, and an invitation. What are your dreams for the future and how can we get there? We’d like to know.\n\nATMOSPHÆRA INCOGNITA\n\nNeal Stephenson\n\nIT’S CALLED SOIL, I told him, for the third time.\n\nCarl didn’t even like to be told anything twice. He drew up short. To me, he said, it’s all dirt.\n\nWhatever you call it, I said, it’s got a certain ability to hold things up.\n\nI could tell he was about to interrupt, so I held up a hand to stifle him. Everyone else in the room drew in a sharp breath. But none of them had known Carl since the age of five. All I’m saying, I said, \"is that civil engineers happen to be really, really good at building things on top of dirt— (this was me throwing him a bone) —and so rather than begin this project—whatever the hell it is—by issuing a fatwa against dirt, maybe you should trust the engineers to find some clever way to support whatever the hell it is you want to build on top of whatever kind of soil happens to cover whatever the hell site you want me to buy.\"\n\nCarl said, I don’t trust dirt to support a tower twenty kilometers high.\n\nThat silenced the room. With any other client, someone might have been bold enough to raise their hand and ask if he’d really meant what he said.\n\nOr, assuming he had, whether he was out of his mind.\n\nNo hands went up.\n\nOkay, I said finally, we’ll look for a site where bedrock is near the surface.\n\n\"Preferably is the surface,\" Carl said.\n\nI’m just saying that might be tricky, I pointed out, combined with your other requirements. What were those, again?\n\nDirect access to a Great Lake, he said. Extra points if it has a steel mill on it.\n\nWhat if the steel mill isn’t for sale? someone asked.\n\nIt will be, I said, before Carl could.\n\nWITH ME AND CARL it was one of those relationships where we went for a quarter of a century without having any contact at all and then picked up right where we’d left off at twelve. We’d gone to the same schools and scuffled together on the same playgrounds and even advanced as far as some exploratory kissing, which, for reasons that will shortly become self-evident, hadn’t gone very well. Then the coach of the middle-school football team had refused to let me participate, save as manager or cheerleader, and my parents had yanked me out of the place and homeschooled me for a year before sending me to a private academy. This had led to college and grad school and a long dispiriting run of un- and underemployment, since the economy didn’t seem interested in comparative religion majors. I’d moved to California with a girlfriend during a window when gay marriage was legal, but broken up with her before we could tie the knot—because something about knowing you could really focused one’s attentions on what life would be like if you did—then met Tess and married her instead. Tess was making decent money as a programmer for a series of tech firms, which left me as one of those stay-at-home spouses with nothing to pass the time except yoga. Eventually, as an alternative to simply going crazy, I had gotten into the real estate business. I was good at all parts of it except dealing with silly homeowners-to-be who couldn’t make up their minds about which house they wanted to buy.\n\nCommercial real estate had turned out to be my ticket. Those buyers knew what they wanted and I liked such people.\n\nPeople like Carl.\n\nI’d followed his career: the cover stories in the business magazines, the photos of him opening the New York Stock Exchange. I hadn’t realized that he was Carl, the kid from the playground, until he’d become a billionaire, lost most of it, and become a billionaire a second time: exhibiting a tolerance for risk that fit in perfectly with his behavioral profile during recess.\n\nOne year I’d gone home for Christmas. My mom, busy in the kitchen, had dispatched me to the grocery store to buy cranberry relish. I found myself standing next to Carl in the checkout line. He was holding a tub of sour cream and a six-pack of beer. Just me and the eleventh-richest man in America standing there waiting for Old Lady Jones (as we had known her three decades earlier) to finish coupon sorting. Carl and I had strolled across the parking lot to the Applebee’s and spent a while catching up. I told him about my marriage. Carl just nodded as if to say, Yeah, that would be you. This created an immediate and probably stupid feeling of gratitude and loyalty that saw me through a lot of the crazy stuff that happened later.\n\nThen some internal timer seemed to go off in his head. Maybe he sensed that the sour cream and the beer were both getting warm, or maybe that’s just how guys like Carl are hooked up. He turned into a grown-up again. Asked me what I did for a living. Asked me a lot of questions about it, then interrupted my answers when they reached the point of diminishing returns. Requested my business card.\n\nA week later I was back in the Bay Area. Finding Carl a hangar to store his collection of restored World War I biplanes. After that it was helping one of his companies move to a new facility in Redwood Shores. Then finding an office building for his microfinancing venture.\n\nAnd it was always easy between us. Even when he was impatient or downright pissed off about something, it was always Emma and Carl, twelve years old again. Even—no, especially—when he came to me with a very twelve-year-old look on his face and said, I’ve got a weird one for you.\n\n\"YOU WEREN’T KIDDING ABOUT the weird part,\" I told him, after the engineers and bankers and lawyers and a single lonely astrophysicist had all filed out of the room.\n\nI was going to keep it secreter, longer, he admitted, but people can’t make good decisions if I don’t tell them the plan.\n\nIs it a plan? I asked. I mean, how much of this have you figured out?\n\nI’ve had civil and mechanical engineers on it for a few months, he said, a small team. What I haven’t figured out yet is—\n\nWhy it makes sense? I prompted him.\n\nAh, I knew there was a reason I hired you.\n\nHOW STEEL IS MADE sounds like the title of one of those earnest educational films that Carl and I had respectively slept through and watched in fourth grade. If you’re of a certain age, you can see that film in your mind’s eye: the grainy black-and-white footage, the block-letter title cards, the triumphant soundtrack trying to blow out the tiny speakers of your classroom’s AV cart. Here I’m using it as a kind of placeholder for the first six months of my tenure in Carl’s organization. There was no point in even starting to think about building a twenty-kilometer-high steel tower until we had figured out where the steel was going to come from.\n\nMaking no pretenses to narrative coherence, here’s that six months broken down into six bullet points:\n\n• There’s a reason most of the steel mills were around the Great Lakes. These seemed to have been designed by God to support the production of steel on a massive scale. Iron ore from northern Minnesota came together with coal from Appalachia (or, later, from Wyoming) and poured into mills dotted around the shores of those enormous bodies of water. To you and me, lake might mean fishing and waterskiing, but to industrialists it meant infinitely wide superhighway for moving heavy things.\n\n• Most of those mills were obsolete.\n\n• The steel industry was, in Carl’s unkind phrasing, the Jurassic Park of the business world. It took a long time to pay off the massive capital investment needed to build a new mill, so owners were resistant to change. Innovation tended to be forced on them by early adopters, elsewhere in the world, who had nothing to lose.\n\n• China was kicking the crap out of us. Most of their mills were new. They produced better product: more consistent, higher quality, easier to work with. They were getting their ore from Australia and their coal domestically. They weren’t encumbered by regulations.\n\n• None of the existing U.S. mills were making the stuff we were going to need.\n\n• As a little side project en route to building his tower, Carl was going to have to reboot the American steel industry.\n\nOur initial idea, which we quite fell in love with, was to plant the tower along the shore of a Great Lake and basically extrude it out the top of a brand-new steel mill. Needless to say, we got a lot of love from Chambers of Commerce in that part of the country until our structural engineers finally achieved mind-meld with some climate scientists and called us in for a little meeting.\n\nThe engineers had been getting more and more nervous about wind. It had been clear from early on that the big challenge, from a structural engineering point of view, wasn’t supporting the self-weight of the tower. The amount of steel needed to do that was trivial compared to what was needed to prevent its being knocked flat by the upper-altitude winds. Kavanaugh Hughes, our head structures guy, had an effective demo that came to be known as I am the wind. He would have you stand up in a normal, relaxed attitude, feet shoulder width apart, and then he would get to one side of you and start pushing. First he would get down on his hands and knees and push on your ankle as hard as he could. Low-level winds, he explained. No one had trouble resisting a force applied that close to the floor. Then he’d rise up to a kneeling position, place his hands on your hip bone, and push. Note the transfer of weight, he’d say, and he’d keep urging you to articulate what you were feeling until you got the right answer: your downwind leg and foot were bearing more weight, your upwind leg and foot were more lightly loaded. Your only way to resist the force of Kavanaugh was that differential push-pull between one leg and the other—the couple, as he called it. The downwind leg has to be stronger to take that extra force. But since we don’t know which direction the wind might blow from, we have to make all of the legs stronger by the same amount. That means more weight, and more steel. Finally, Kavanaugh would stand up, put his hand on your shoulder, and push. It didn’t take much force to knock the average person off balance. Short of that, other things were going on: not just the intensifying couple between the upwind and downwind feet, but some internal strains in the torso. My trainer is always nagging me to activate my core, Kavanaugh said, and what that means to me is a system of internal cross bracing that makes it possible for me to transfer stresses from one part of my body to another—and eventually down into one of my feet. Then he would push you until you were forced to hop away from him. The problems are two, he explained. First, all of that cross bracing requires more steel—and more steel catches more wind, and increases the force!\n\nShit, it’s an exponential, Carl said.\n\nYes, it is, said Kavanaugh. Second, the most powerful winds aren’t down at ankle height, where it’s easy to resist them. They’re up near the top—the worst possible place.\n\nThe jet stream, Carl said.\n\nYou got it. Now, I’m not saying we can’t build a tower capable of resisting the jet stream. We can do anything we want. But common sense tells us to avoid places where the jet stream is powerful and frequent. He nodded to one of his new climate scientist buddies, who flashed up a map of the world showing where the jet stream wandered most frequently. And it was immediately obvious that the upper Midwest and the industrial Northeast were the worst places in the whole world to construct our tower.\n\nNear the equator and near the poles tended to be better. Carl nixed the poles. So we were left staring at a band of latitude that, roughly speaking, corresponded to the tropics.\n\nI know what some of you are thinking, Carl said, after studying it for a minute, but no, I’m not going to build this tower in some third world hellhole only to have it end up being the property of the first junta that comes along.\n\nA few of the people in the room had actually been born and raised in what Carl considered to be third world hellholes.\n\nCarl was oblivious. Political stability and property rights are nonnegotiable site selection criteria.\n\nThe northernmost capes of Australia look ideal, then, someone pointed out. And for a minute we were all ready to purchase stylish hats and join the Qantas frequent flier program, until someone in the climate science group mentioned that those areas tended to get hit by cyclones.\n\nOkay, Carl said, we need a place with boring weather at all altitudes, and political stability.\n\nThe answer was the southwestern United States, with California’s Central Valley being ground zero. There was quibbling. Left-leaning people denied that the United States was a politically stable entity. Right-leaners took issue with the premise that Americans really had property rights. And Californians seemed offended by the assertion that their climate was boring. People in every part of the world, it seemed, like to complain about their local weather. We began to search outward from the Central Valley. Could we find a location with better seismic stability? Better access to heavy freight transport? A nice high-altitude plateau, perhaps, so that we could get an extra height boost?\n\nIN DUE TIME WE found promising locations in central California. Southern Nevada. Central Arizona. Southwest Texas. Every time we found a place that would work, my acquisitive instincts kicked in, and I started pestering Carl with text messages and e-mails, wanting to go in for the kill. But it seemed that all he wanted was to string these people along for as long as possible. Hoping to play them off against one another and drive the price down, I reckoned.\n\nThen one day the following text message showed up on my phone:\n\nBuy all 4\n\nTo which I replied:\n\nLol really?\n\nAnd he answered:\n\nAs long as you think they can be resold without serious loss.\n\nAnd, moments later:\n\nDon’t spend it all in one place\n\nReferring, I guess, to the fact that I was about to collect four commissions on four separate purchases—and perhaps as many as three more when he decided to resell the ones he didn’t want to use (losers in Carl-speak).\n\nI was beginning to suspect that the tower was a ruse and that he was actually making some kind of incredibly complicated play in desert real estate.\n\nThe reality became clearer to me when Carl bought all of those properties and then began to visit those towns and show the locals the dog-and-pony show his engineers had been preparing on the subject of why it was such a great thing to have a twenty-kilometer-high tower in one’s community. Lots of PowerPoint slides explaining, in the most soothing possible way, why it was impossible for the thing to fall over and crush the town. Even if it got hit by a 747.\n\nI ended up going on many of these dog-and-ponies. I had already done the part I was qualified to do. But my job title kept morphing as the project developed. For Carl was no respecter of titles and credentials. Whomever he trusted, was in his field of vision, and hadn’t said anything colossally stupid recently tended to end up being assigned responsibilities. I ended up becoming one of the advocates for this thing, completely trashing my regular business (it was okay, we worked it out in the aftermath), and had to buy a pocketbook to contain all of my loyalty program cards for Hertz, United, Marriott, et al. Then a purse to contain the pocketbook. Then skirts to go with the purse. Which I mention because I’d always been a wallet-in-the-pocket-of-my-jeans kind of girl. Tess watched my sartorial transformations with amusement and alarm, accusing me of traveling to the Intermountain West in drag. It became a little tense between us until one day the lightbulb came on and I explained: They don’t give a shit that I’m gay.\n\nReally?\n\nReally. They actually think it’s kind of cool. Most of them.\n\nI just thought—\n\nNo. The clothes are about being taken seriously. Tess was mollified, though not fully convinced.\n\nPeople are afraid it’s going to fall over on them. The explanation of why this is never going to happen needs to come from someone who is not wearing black leather.\n\nI could do the PowerPoint in my sleep. As a matter of fact I often did do it in my sleep, tossing and turning in my hotel bed. We’d hired a graphics firm to make a nice animated film showing the transformation of the site. Leveling the ground. Planting trees to make it purty. A new railway line, lollipop-shaped, terminated with a perfectly circular loop nine miles in diameter. Extending inward from that, the spoke lines. Half a dozen of them, one for each of the Primaries—the primary supports that would hold the tower up. A little homily here on the subject of why six? In theory you could build a stable tower with only three. But if something happened to one of them—I didn’t have to mention a jumbo jet strike, since everyone was clearly picturing it in their heads—the other two wouldn’t be able to hold it up. You might be able to make it survivable with four, but it would take some structural legerdemain. Five was a safer bet. Six gave you even more of a safety margin as well as some benefits resulting from symmetry. The greater the number of Primaries, the closer each was to its neighbors, and that simplified, somewhat, the problem of webbing them together structurally. So six it was.\n\nThe next step was to construct the foundation strips: six reinforced-concrete tracks, each straddling one of the spoke lines. This part of the presentation went pretty fast; there wasn’t much interesting you could say about pavement.\n\nThe concept of a rolling factory was harder to explain. Factories they got, but no one had ever seen one crossed with a main battle tank the size of a shopping mall. This was where the computer-graphics renderings really came in handy, showing how the thing was built from the ground up on huge steel treads, how it accepted its inputs (steel! steel! and more steel!) from the railway line that ran right through the middle of it, assembled them into trusses, connected them to the bottom of the Primary, and then pushed them straight up through a hole in the roof. It was all reasonably easy to follow, once you got the gist of it. The one part that was a little hard to convey was that each of these six rolling factories—one for each Primary—was also a structural foundation supporting its share of the tower’s whole weight. The factory didn’t just have to roll (slowly!) along the runway. It didn’t just have to assemble trusses and feed them out its ceiling. It also had to contain hydraulic rams for pushing the tower up, transmitting its share of the weight down through its structure into the big steel tank treads and from there into the foundation strip and finally into Carl’s precious bedrock.\n\nHaving gotten those preliminaries out of the way, I was able to proceed to the big all-singing all-dancing animation (complete with moving symphonic music) showing the six Struders (as we had come to call the truss-extruding factories) poised at their starting positions at the innermost extremes of the spokes, nearly touching one another. Six trains came chugging up the lollipop handle and went their separate ways around the rim line. A seventh went straight into the center, headed for a central, nonmoving Struder designed to extrude the tower’s core. Once each of the seven had been supplied by its own train, steel trusses—kinda like radio towers—began to emerge from the holes in their roofs, growing upward like stalks from magic beans. There was a pause as cranes went to work framing in a platform that joined the six Primaries with the core. This was my opportunity to wax poetic as I marveled over the fact that this platform would one day be twenty thousand meters above the ground, for all practical purposes in outer space, where the sky was black and the curvature of the earth visible. Honeymooners would luxuriate in pressurized suites, astronomers would gaze at the universe through glass eyes undimmed by atmospheric pollution. Rockets would launch from it and extreme skydivers would jump off.\n\nAnd yet 99 percent of the workers who built it would never have to leave the ground.\n\nThe reaction to that was mixed. Oh, everyone understood why it made sense—you couldn’t have a large workforce commuting straight up into the sky every day, breathing from oxygen tanks and swaddled up in space suits. But it did take some of the romance out of it. At some level I think that every blue-collar worker who ever attended one of these presentations was telling himself that he would be one of the tiny minority of employees who would actually get to go up high on the tower, inspecting and troubleshooting.\n\nThe rest of the movie was predictable enough. The trains kept rolling in, the Struders kept extruding, pausing from time to time so that the freshly extruded Primaries and core could be webbed together with stiffening trusses—Kavanaugh’s core muscles. We speeded up the movie, of course, once people got the gist of it. Push, pause, web. Push, pause, web. With each push the factories rolled outward imperceptibly on their tracks, moving about one meter for every fifteen meters of stuff they extruded, keeping the tower’s height-to-width ratio fixed. Though, toward the end, they started moving a bit faster, making the base splay out, giving it a bit of an Eiffel Tower feel. Even the people who walked into the room claiming to be worried that it would fall over were convinced by this; it had a wide enough stance that it just looked stable. Up and up went the steel as I recited lore that I had picked up from Wikipedia and from meteorology textbooks and long conversations with Ph.D. metallurgists about the different layers of the atmosphere and the varying challenges that the tower would have to contend with: down below, rain and rust. Up higher, icing. Higher yet, wind loading, the possibility of contact with a wandering jet stream (or a wayward jet). Profound cold that would render the metal brittle if we had been dumb enough to use the wrong alloys. Thermal expansion and contraction as the unfiltered sun shone on its higher reaches in the day and then disappeared at night. Each challenge was an opportunity to generate energy with photovoltaics (up high) or convection ducts (down low) or wind turbines (in the middle).\n\nSo much for the pitch.\n\nAnd so much (almost) for my marriage, which barely survived all of the absences, all of those nights in chain hotels far from home, all of those alarming changes in wardrobe and hairstyle.\n\nIF I WERE TO write a book about building the tower, I’d here interpolate a three-year-long chapter entitled Politics and Lawyers. Halfway through it, I got a text message from Carl:\n\nCALI = LOSER\n\nmeaning, Sell the property in California.\n\nMy response was\n\nOK\n\nbut my reaction was a little more complicated. I had known all along, of course, that we’d end up selling at least three of the four properties. But I’d spent time in each of those places and had made friends with the locals, and I didn’t look forward to breaking them the news that their bid—for by this point, each of these things had mushroomed into a complicated bid package binding together state and local governments, unions, banks, and other worthies—had been rejected.\n\nThe answer, simply, was that the tower was going to be visible from the hills above Oakland and Berkeley: a spendy part of the world where lots of rich people were accustomed to looking out the windows of their nice houses and seeing the landscape. And only the landscape. They didn’t want their views marred by a twenty-kilometer-high monstrosity whose stark, ugly, industrial profile was going to be cluttered with ungainly industrial encrustations and gaudy with a Las Vegas–style light show that would sully the purity of the skies night and day.\n\nSouthwestern Texas got killed six months later by environmentalists being used as sock puppets by an unholy alliance of—well, never mind. Demonstrating in court that their claims were bogus would have been expensive. Bankrolled as well as they were, they could have stretched the process out forever by filing legal challenges. Arizona was the next domino to fall. It had always been a long shot, but we’d held on to it mostly to give us greater bargaining power over the Nevada site, where local politicians had smelled money and begun to let us know, in various ways, that we were going to have to play ball.\n\nSo that was how I came to earn four commissions by purchasing four losers for Carl, and another four by selling each and every one of them. We made money on two, lost money on another two, and pretty much broke even on the whole deal.\n\nThat was how the project ended up where it did: between an Indian reservation and a decommissioned military bombing range, out in the southwestern desert, in an area that had already demonstrated its openness to radical transformations of the landscape, first by bombing the crap out of it, then by building a casino complex, and most recently by its wholehearted acceptance of wind farms.\n\nAt about the same time we closed a deal on an aging complex near the Illinois-Indiana border and got to work building a new kind of steel mill. The Great Lakes were still the best place in the world to make steel. This was a far cry from our original scheme to have the mill on-site. But in the intervening years it had become clear that lots of people wanted the kind of steel that a new mill could produce. Hard as it was to believe, the tower had become a minor customer.\n\nTransportation wasn’t that big of a deal. Smaller pieces could be shipped southwest on freight trains. Big stuff was barged down the river system to the Gulf, dragged through the Panama Canal, landed at the head of the Gulf of California, and then transported overland using land trains.\n\nThe site was twenty minutes’ drive from a college town, which gave the employees a place to educate their kids and entertain themselves and gave us a ready supply of fresh young engineering talent.\n\nAs well as a cowgirl-themed gay bar. Which became pretty important when Carl told me—as if this should have been obvious from the beginning—that I was moving there to run the whole thing.\n\nI’m not qualified to construct a twenty-kilometer-high tower, I pointed out.\n\nSince it has never been done before, he said, no one is.\n\nThe engineering is totally beyond my—\n\nWe have engineers.\n\nAll the legal ins and outs—\n\nLawyers.\n\nI was dreading the conversation with Tess but she’d seen it coming long ago. Hell, maybe Carl had even prepped her.\n\nLet’s go, was all she said.\n\nBless her beautiful heart, I thought. But what I said was Huh?\n\nI’ve been looking into it. Precleared it with my boss. I’ll telecommute.\n\nNEITHER OF US REALLY believed that, of course. Her job lasted for all of twelve weeks after we moved.\n\nShe cashed in some stock options and bought the cowgirl bar for less than what she had spent on her last car. With what was left over she bought a pickup truck from a rancher who had sold his land to Carl.\n\nFive years later, the bar had morphed into the hangout for all the engineers, gay and otherwise, who had moved to the area.\n\nAnother five years after that, Tess was operating the First Bar in Space.\n\nOh, people argued about it. Space tourism had been gathering steam. Queasy/giddy tourists drifted around the tiny envelopes of their suborbital capsules and sucked premixed cocktails from nippled sacs and this got billed as the first bar in space. It became like the debate on who had built the first computer: well, depends on what you consider a computer.\n\nWhat do you consider a bar? For Tess it had to have a jukebox, a dartboard, and gravity. You can’t get a head on your Guinness in zero gee.\n\nAt first it was just a shipping container with portholes plasma-torched by Tess’s eternally grateful clientele of elite ultra-high-altitude steelworkers. This was back in the early days when the Square Kilometer—as we called the (actually round) platform at the top of the tower—was still only a couple of thousand meters off the ground. Once we broke through four thousand meters it became necessary to start running oxygen concentrators full-time, even for the altitude-adjusted regulars. On the day the Top Click (as we called the Square Kilometer by that point) pushed up past the altitude of Mt. Everest, we moved the whole operation into a pressurized Quonset hut and filled it with sea-level atmosphere. Beyond ten thousand meters we just started calling it the First Bar in Space. There was carping on the Internet but the journalists and businesspeople who rode the helirail up to the top and sat at the bar taking in the black sky and the curvature of the earth—well, none of them doubted.\n\nI’m leaving a lot out: five years of starting the project, ten years of riding it up. Tess and I had two kids, raised them to teenagerhood, and went through a spell of personal-life hell when she had an affair with a Mohawk ironworker who drifted in from Upstate New York and stormed out a year later when Tess thought better of it. I ran the show for a few years until Carl suddenly announced during a meeting that (a) I had done a fantastic job but (b) I was being replaced effective immediately and (c) he was commencing radiation therapy for prostate cancer forty-five minutes from now. He then gave me the world’s most unusual commercial real estate gig: selling off the Top Click. Obvious conflict-of-interest issues were raised by my wife’s bar; Carl resolved them by giving us a lease in perpetuity, hand-scrawled on the back of a boarding pass.\n\nShipping materials to the top of the tower only became more expensive as it went up, so we had framed in the big structures while the Top Click had been on the ground, then stockpiled steel and other goods that could be used to finish it later. All of it got a free—but very slow—ride to twenty thousand meters. Additional structural work proceeded at a leisurely pace during the years that the Top Click was rising up through the Dead Zone—the altitudes from about seven to twelve kilometers. Below seven, humans could breathe (though most needed oxygen bottles), move around without pressure suits, and enjoy a decent enough view. It was cold as hell, but you could wear warm clothes; it was like being at a base camp on a man-made Himalaya. Much above seven, there wasn’t enough atmosphere to breathe, but there was enough to supply foul weather in abundance. The view down was often blocked by clouds, the view up not yet enlivened by starlight. Past Everest height—nine kilometers or so—we got up into screaming sub-sub-subzero winds that, at their worse, were close to jet stream intensity. There wasn’t much point in trying to keep glass in window frames. Even heavy-looking stuff like shipping containers had to be welded down or it would blow off, fall a few miles, and break something on the ground. There were ways to deal with it; but it basically led to Top Click operations being put in suspended animation until the Struders on the ground pushed it up out the top of the Dead Zone. During that time, we had other things to think about: sheathing the horizontal braces in giant wings, and getting them to work right.\n\nAbove the Dead Zone, things got nice in a hurry. The buildings, which had been empty shells for several years, got shelled in by space-suited workers and then pressurized with proper atmosphere so that shirtsleeved workers could get in, lay carpet, and put on doorknobs.\n\nIt was during that phase, when the Top Click was about seventeen kilometers above the ground, that we threw a party in the First Bar in Space for the purpose of scattering Carl’s ashes. The basic idea being that they would fall for a couple of kilometers, get snatched by the wind, and disperse.\n\nI was the last to arrive, carrying the guest of honor—a Ziploc bag full of Carl—in a messenger bag that looked way too hip for a middle-aged mom in the real estate business. My flight from SFO had been delayed by one monster of a storm front: the kind of thing that had been sweeping west to east across the Great Plains since time immemorial but was rarely seen in our part of the Southwest. But like the proverbial frog in a pan of water, we’d all been getting accustomed to shifts in the climate, and weather events unheard of during the previous century. The airline had found a way to route me around the storm, but as I drove in from the regional airport in Tess’s pickup truck, I could see clearly enough that it was determined to catch up with me: an arc of stratocumulus anvil clouds stretching, it seemed, from Baja to Utah, blotting out the late-afternoon sun and flashing here and there with buried lightning.\n\nIt was the only thing that could make the tower look small.\n\nOne of the engineers, way back at the beginning, had described it as a gas of metal, which was pretty poetic for an engineer but did convey its gist: the minimum of steel needed to do the job, distributed over the largest volume it could feasibly occupy, but in a specific way meant to solve a host of structural problems. At night, when the lights came on, it looked far more substantial than during the day, when it was a glinting cloud that rose up out of the desert like an inverted tornado. If you let your gaze be drawn up high enough—astonishingly high, far above most clouds—you could see its ladder of wings cruising in the jet stream, like a set of venetian blinds hanging inexplicably in space. Above that, frequently obscured by haze and clouds, was the flare at the very top where it broadened to support the Top Click.\n\nEven though I’d been living with—and on—this thing for going on twenty years, I was still impressed with its scale when I approached it as I was doing now. But having Carl’s earthly remains on the passenger seat somehow drew my attention to his ground-level legacy, which now spread out from the base of the tower to a radius of ten or twenty miles. Fanning away to the east-southeast was an expanse of open rangeland, inhabited only by bison, groundhogs, and a few back-to-the-land types: vaqueros and the Indians who had always lived in those parts. Part of it was a bombing range. The rest I had acquired, one ranch at a time, using shell companies so that the landowners wouldn’t gang up on me. Because one of the questions people had asked was What if it gets rusty and falls over? and Carl’s answer had been Then we’ll use demolition charges to fell it like a tree down the middle of the Swath, as this territory had come to be known. Which to me had seemed like bending over backward for the NIMBY types, until I’d understood that Carl had always intended to use the tower as a catapult for launching space vehicles, whose trajectories, for the first twenty miles, would pass right down the middle of the Swath, which he therefore needed to keep clear anyway so that failed rockets would have a place to crash.\n\nThe new highway from the airport ran along the Swath’s northern border for the last few miles, and as I drove in I enjoyed, to the left, a vista of grazing bison and the occasional horse-riding Indian, and to the right, a generic exurban sprawl of strip malls and big-box stores that had sprung up to fill the needs of all the people who had moved here. Behind that line of development I could hear the long blasts of a locomotive whistle: another huge train rolling in from Chicago carrying prefab steel trusses to feed into the Struders.\n\nThe ring line encircling the base was discernible as a crescent of five- to ten-story commercial buildings adorned with the logos of the tech firms and contractors that had set up shop here. Mixed in were hotels and apartment buildings housing temporary residents as well as the younger, more urban crowd who wanted to be close to what had developed into a passable nightlife and entertainment district. From their windows they could look out over residential developments spreading away along the state highway connecting to the college town. All of this had a temporary feel, since it was understood that when the tower topped out and the Struders ground to a halt, the bottom kilometer would develop into a vertical city, a much cooler place to live—climatically as well as culturally.\n\nFor now, though, the tower’s lower reaches were a web of bare trusses with steelworkers, and their robots, crawling about. Welding arcs hung in it like bottled fireflies, and cranes pivoted and picked like hollow mantises. In most building sites, a crane had to be capable of hoisting itself higher as the building grew beneath it, but here the cranes had to keep working their way down the structure as it pushed up from the Struders. It wasn’t rocket science but it did make for some crowd-pleasing erector-set gymnastics, watched by vacationing families and know-it-all retirees from covered viewing platforms spotted around the ring road.\n\nRocket science was the domain of the innermost core, a ten-meter-diameter chimney running all the way up the tower’s central axis. During the first couple of years I had pestered Carl with questions about what specifically was going to go into that empty space—that perfectly round hole at the center of every floor plan.\n\nYou’re assuming I have a secret plan, he had said.\n\nYou usually do.\n\nMy secret plan is that I have no secret plan.\n\nWow!\n\nI am going to sell—you are going to sell—that right-of-way to the highest bidder. On eBay if necessary.\n\nAnd what is the highest bidder going to put in it?\n\nI have no idea. Since it is twenty kilometers long and pointed straight up, I’m going to make a wild guess that it will be something connected with hurling shit into space.\n\nBut you really don’t know what exactly?\n\nHe had thrown up his hands. Maybe a giant peashooter, maybe a railgun, maybe something that hasn’t been invented yet.\n\nThen why did you pick ten meters for its diameter?\n\nIt was easier to remember than eleven point one three nine zero two four . . .\n\nOkay, okay!\n\nThe secret plan worked. The people who won the bidding war—a coalition of commercial space companies and defense contractors—gave the tower a shot of cash and credibility at a time when both had been a little tight.\n\nNow cutting across the ring road, working against an outflow of traffic—workers coming off the day shift, headed home for the weekend—I passed a security checkpoint and rolled across a flyover that had been thrown across the circular railway line. This ramped down to ground level and became a road paralleling the Northwest Spoke.\n\nInstead of paving the spokes all at once—which would have been a huge up-front expense—we had been building them just in time, a few meters and a few weeks in advance of where and when they would be needed. This made it possible to keep the paving crews employed on a steady full-time basis for years. So directly in front of the astonishing bulk of the Northwest Struder was this fringe of preparatory activity: orange flags marking the locations of soil samples, graded and tamped earth, a gray haze of webbed rebar, plywood forms, freshly poured concrete. The giant linked treads and looming hulk of the Struder rising just behind.\n\nOn the top of the Struder, evening-shift workers in safety harnesses were ascending from dressing rooms below to busy themselves on the most recently extruded truss section, inspecting, x-raying, installing sensors and lights and wires. A lot of that work had been done hundreds of miles away when the trusses were being prefabbed, but there didn’t seem to be any computer-driven process that couldn’t be improved upon by humans crawling around on the actual structure and writing on it with grease pencils. As the tower had risen up from the desert, data pouring in from its millions of strain gauges, thermocouples, cameras, and other sensors had given up oceans of information about how the models had, and hadn’t, gotten the predictions right, creating a demand for tweaking crews to make adjustments to newly extruded work before it got pushed so high into the sky that it became hard to reach.\n\nThere was more than one way to the top. Climbing hand over hand had become a new extreme sport. Helipads were available at various altitudes, and work was under way to build a new regional airport at what would eventually be the twenty-five-hundred-meter level—airplanes would land and take off by flying into and out of apertures in the tower’s side, saving them huge amounts of fuel as they avoided the usual ascent and descent.\n\nSurrounding that ten-meter right-of-way in the middle were vertical elevator shafts. But the primary transport scheme was the helirail: a cross between a train, an elevator, and an amusement park ride that corkscrewed up the periphery of the structure, ascending at a steady twenty-degree angle. It was really just a simple ramp, about sixty kilometers long, that had been wrapped around the tower as it was built. Cut a triangle out of paper and roll it around a pencil if you want the general idea. Special trains ran on it with tilted floors so that you always felt you were on the level. Train stations were built around it every two thousand meters altitude. One of those—the second to last—had just been roughed in and was dangling there a few meters off the ground. I was able to clamber up into it via some scaffolding and catch the next up-bound train.\n\nActually train was too grand a word for this conveyance, which was just a single car with none of the luxury appurtenances that would be built into these things later when they were carrying droves of tourists and business moguls. All the regulars knew to empty their bladders first and to bring warm clothes even if it was a warm day at ground level. I shared my car with Joe, an aeronautical engineer who was headed up to fourteen thousand meters to inspect the servomechanisms on a wing; Nicky, an astronomer going to the Top Click to work on the mirror stabilization system for the big telescope a-building there; and Frog, a video producer readying a shoot about the BASE-jumping industry, which was already serving a thousand clients a year. After peppering us with recorded warnings, the car began to hum up the helirail, banking slightly on its gimbals as it picked up speed. A recorded message told us where to look for motion sickness pills and barf bags, then moved on to the more serious matter of what to do if we lost pressurization.\n\nThis was a pretty white-collar passenger manifest, but this was Friday afternoon and most of the workers were headed down for the weekend—as we could see when we looked into the windows of the crowded coaches spiraling down the opposite way.\n\nFor the hundredth time since leaving the funeral home, I reached out and patted the bundle of ashes in my bag. Carl had had a lot to be proud of and had not been shy about taking credit when earned. But I knew, just from watching his reactions, that he took special pride in having created countless blue-collar jobs. His family back home had been steelworkers, electricians, farmers. Carl had always been more comfortable with them than with the crowd at Sun Valley or TED, and when he had passed, the outpouring of grief from those people had been raw and unaffected.\n\nAs we spiraled up, we revolved through all points of the compass every four minutes or so. Views down the brown expanse of the Swath alternated with the panoramic storm front now blotting out the evening sun. The top fringes of the anvils were still afire with bent sunlight but their bases were hidden in indistinct blue-gray murk, cracked open here and there with ice-white lightning.\n\nThe car began to hum and keen as it pushed its way up into an eighty-mile-an-hour river of air. Bars of shadow began to flash down over us as we passed upward through a structure that resembled a six-sided ladder, with each rung a giant wing. For this part of the tower was not so much a structure in the conventional sense as a stationary glider. Or perhaps kite was the correct word for it.\n\nThe idea dated back to the very first months of the design process, when the engineers would work late into the evening tweaking their models and wake up in the morning to find long e-mails from Carl, timestamped at three A.M. The weight of the tower—what Carl called the Steel Bill—kept growing. Sometimes it would creep up stealthily, others make a sickening upward lurch. The problem was wind. The only way to win that fight—or so the engineers thought at first—was to make the tower beefier, so that the downwind legs could push back. Beefy steel catches more wind, increasing the force that’s causing the problem in the first place. Not only that but it demands more steel below to support its weight. This feedback loop produced exponential jumps in the Steel Bill whenever anything got adjusted.\n\nIt wasn’t long before someone pointed out that, from an aerodynamics standpoint, the tower was a horror show. Basically every strut and every cable was a cylinder—one of the draggiest shapes you can have. If we snapped an airfoil-shaped fairing around each of those cylinders, however, leaving it free to pivot into the wind, the drag went down by an order of magnitude and the Steel Bill dropped like—well, like a wrench dropped from the roof of a Top Click casino. And those fairings would have other benefits too; filled with lightweight insulation, they would reduce the thermal ups and downs caused by sunlight and direct exposure to space. The steel would live at a nice in-between temperature, not expanding and contracting so much, and brittleness would be less of a problem.\n\nEveryone was feeling pretty satisfied with that solution when Carl raised an idea that, I suspect, some of the engineers had been hiding in their subsconscious and been afraid to voice: Why not fly the tower? If we were going to all the trouble to airfoilize everything, why not use the kind of airfoil that not only minimizes drag, but also produces lift?\n\nWings, in other words. The tower’s lateral braces—the horizontal struts that joined its verticals together at regular intervals—would be enclosed in burnished-aluminum wings, actuated by motors that could change their angle of attack, trimming the airfoils to generate greater or lesser amounts of lift. When the jet stream played on the tower’s upper reaches like a firehose slamming into a kid’s Tinkertoy contraption—when, in other words, the maximum possible crush was being imposed on the downwind legs—the wings on that side would be trimmed so as to lift the whole thing upward and relieve the strain. Performing a kind of aerodynamic jujitsu, redirecting the very energy that would destroy the tower to actively hold it up. The tower would become half building, half kite.\n\n© 2013, Haylee Bolinger / ASU\n\nPeople’s understandable skepticism about that scheme had accounted for the need to maintain a huge empty swath downwind of it. Many took a dim view of a building that wouldn’t stand up without continuous control system feedback.\n\nWhen we had boarded the helirail, I’d exchanged a bit of small talk with Joe, the engineer sitting across from me. Then he had unrolled a big display, apologizing for hogging so much table space, and spent most of the journey poring over a big three-dimensional technical drawing—the servomechanism he was going to take a look at. My eyes wandered to it, and I noticed he was studying me. When I caught him looking, he glanced away sheepishly. Penny for your thoughts, he mumbled.\n\nOh, I spent years talking to concerned citizens in school gyms and senators in congressional hearings, selling them on this idea.\n\nWhich idea?\n\nExactly, I said. You’ve grown so used to it you don’t even see it. I’m talking about the idea of flying the tower.\n\nHe shrugged. It was going to require active damping anyway, to control oscillations, he said.\n\n‘Otherwise, every slot machine on the Top Click will have to come equipped with a barf bag dispenser.’ Yeah, I used to make a living telling people that. ‘And from there it’s a small step to using the same capability to help support the tower on those rare occasions when the jet stream is hitting it.’\n\nJoe was nodding. There’s no going back, he said. It snuck up on us.\n\nWhat did?\n\nHe was stumped for an answer and smiled helplessly for a moment. Then threw up his hands. All things cyber. Anything with code in it. Anything connected to the Internet. This stuff creeped into our lives and we got dependent on it. Take it away and the economy crashes—just like the tower. You gotta embrace it."
