        "text": "Publishing As Practice\n\nA three part publishing residency\n\nEdited by Ulises: Kayla Romberger, Gee Wesley, Nerissa Cooney, Lauren Downing, and Ricky Yanas\n\nCo-published by: Inventory Press & Ulises\n\nDesign by: Joel Evey & David Wise\n\n7 Â¾ Ã 10 inches, 176 pages\n\nISBN 978-1-941753-40-8\n\n$35.00\n\nORDER NOW\n\nPublishing as Practice: Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, Bidoun centers on the work of three contemporary artists/book publishers who have developed fresh ways of broaching the political in publishing.\n\nThis book documents a residency program at Ulisesâa curatorial platform based in Philadelphiaâthat explores publishing as an incubator for new forms of editorial, curatorial and artistic practice. Over the course of two years, three participants (Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, and Bidoun) activated Ulises as an exhibition space and public programming hub, engaging the public through workshops, discussions, and projects.\n\nHardworking Goodlooking is a design and publishing imprint working primarily out of the Philippines. Dominica is an imprint run by artist Martine Syms dedicated to exploring Blackness as a topic, reference, marker, and audience in visual culture. Bidoun, a non-profit organization and magazine, focuses on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporas. Each organization approached their residency at Ulises in a unique way, bringing a new understanding of what it means to practice publishing.\n\nEdited by Kayla Romberger, Gee Wesley, Nerissa Cooney, Lauren Downing, and Ricky Yanas, Publishing as Practice features a preface by David Senior, Head of Library and Archives at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Ulises CarriÃ³nâs 1975 publishing manifesto âThe New Art of Making Books.â Publishing as Practice also includes writing from Clara Balaguer, Hardworking Goodlooking, Martine Syms/Dominica, Bidoun, Lauren Downing, Kayla Romberger, and Gee Wesley alongside interviews, excerpts, and documentation from each residency.\n\nKen Lum: Klump! â Opening Reception\n\nAugust 30, 2024 from 6 â 9pm\n\nOpeningÂ Reception: Friday,Â AugustÂ 30, 6pm â 9pm\n\nRSVP\n\nKen Lumâs exhibitionÂ Klump!âthe second installment of Ulisesâs year-long, three-part artistsâ multiples seriesÂ Commoditiesâopens onÂ AugustÂ 30, 2024, at Studio 105 at Ray Philly.Â Klump!Â combines and holds in tension two contrary artistic impulses. The white exhibition walls signify an endpoint to art as an uninflected surface, refusing all reference and representation to arrive at a condition of pure aesthetic experience. Small pictures of individuals punctuate the walls like musical notation.\n\nThis work is part of a series by Lum involving full-figure photographic portraits and text in the form of questions. He reflects, âI often experience a simultaneous engagement and estrangement from my environment. Rather than focusing on typologies, I look for patterns in social formations. While I enjoy life, I also find it emptying. These thoughts swirl in this work.â\n\nKen LumÂ is known for his conceptual and representational art in a number of media, including painting, sculpture and photography.Â\n\nCommoditiesÂ considers the defiant and playful nature of the artistsâ multiple through a series of projects/exhibitions and collaborative production with the artists Kameelah Janan Rasheed, Ken Lum, and Candice Lin.\n\nDear Reader: A-B-C Kit\n\nFriday, August 16, 2024 from 6â7:30pm\n\nFor this iteration ofÂ Dear Reader,Â join us for a fun and intimate event of collective bookmaking using Kameelah Janan Rasheedâs Algorithmic Book Composition (A-B-C) - Kit, produced as part of the Ulises artistsâ multiples series,Â Commodities.\n\nIn the kit, participants will find several âalgorithm determinersâ such as a die, color wheels, and sides of jenga blocks, used to create a randomized output. Drawing on the history of Black performance and Fluxus scores, A-B-C offers participants a series of algorithms to determine the design, form, content, and distribution of their book composition. Rasheedâs selection of publications within the exhibitionâs reading room will also support the bookmaking process.\n\nIn a recent interview with curator LadiâSasha Jones for Rasheedâs book,Â in the coherence, we weep, Jones asked about Rasheedâs relationship to play to which she responded, âPlay, not as something frivolous, but as something thatâs rooted in a chance, something thatâs rooted in improvisation . . . You go into play, not knowing whatâs going to happen. And thatâs the exciting part. Thatâs the erotic edge of play. . . . Iâve already seen what the world can offer. Iâm trying to see if we can play towards anything else.â\n\nDear ReaderÂ is a programmatic series that follows the model of an informal book club to delve into Ulisesâs quarterly reading lists through facilitated workshops, lectures, performances, and screenings.\n\nPart 1: âDesignâ Writing and Mark-Making Games with Kameelah Janan Rasheed\n\nSaturday, August 24, 2024, 2 â 4pm\n\nRSVP\n\nThe dayâs first program will focus on designing a series of writing and mark-making prompts. We will take inspiration from the Dadaists, OuLiPians, FLUXUS, and childhood language games. Once we have some context, all participants will be provided with the support and resources to design one prompt/game to be played later in the day. We will end the session by making a 1-sheet book so that participants will have descriptions of other prompts to take home.\n\nMake a chance-based writing game using chalk-drawn hopscotch.\n\nDesign a writing prompt in which participants must write using something other than a pen, pencil, or other traditional writing tool.\n\nCreate a mark-making prompt in which participants cannot use their hands.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to sign up for both sessions, but it is not required.Â 16+ and if younger, please arrive with a guardian.Â Eventbrite registration is appreciated.\n\nPart 2: Game Night with Kameelah Janan Rasheed\n\nSaturday, August 24, 2024 from 6-8pm\n\nRSVP\n\nThe second workshop will be a game night modeled from the ones Rasheed experienced as a child. Participants are welcome to have snacks and socialize alongside playing games and responding to prompts designed by Rasheed and participants from the earlier workshop.\n\nParticipants are encouraged to sign up for both sessions, but it is not required.Â 16+ and if younger, please arrive with a guardian.Â Eventbrite registration is appreciated.\n\nWhat Good Is Eco-Art Without Community?\n\nTuesday, July 9, 2024 at 6pm\n\nJoin the 8th Eco-Social Series event, âWhat good is eco art without community?âÂ with visiting artists Keg de Souza and Alicia Grullon.Â Building on Grullonâs 2023 Hyperallergic articleÂ âWhat Good Is Eco-Art Without Community?âÂ This night of presentations brings together two artists, Keg De Souza and Alicia Grullon, to share their work and observations about the field.

Come enjoy conversation, readings, and Iraqi tea and sweets from the artists and people who brought Al Mudhif to life.Â\n\nWhat happens when you build a traditional structure from the marshes of Iraq in the woods of Pennsylvania? This is the story of Al Mudhif - as told by the artists, Iraqi refugees, Iraq War veterans, and other community members who brought it to life in 2021, at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Education in Philadelphia.Â\n\nMudhifs have been built in Southern Iraq for at least 5,000 years, and are made entirely out of Phragmites reed, which grows abundantly in both Iraq and Philadelphia. In Iraq, Phragmites is a valued building material and indigenous to the area. In the U.S., it is reviled as an invasive plant. Touching on themes of displacement, war, radical hospitality, healing, reconciliation, cultural preservation, and contemporary art, this book lovingly documents the journey from harvesting materials to its final dismantling, and the lessons we learned along the way.Â\n\nEdited by Yaroub Al Obaidi, Sarah Kavage, and L.A. Enck. Introduction by Michael Rakowitz, Daniel Tucker, and Tina Plokarz. Book design by Saif Sarah Designs\n\nMade possible with the support of the Velocity Fund.\n\nDRAFT 04 Launch\n\nFriday, May 17, from 6 â 9pm\n\nDRAFT 04 Launch\n\nRSVP\n\nJoin us for the launch of DRAFT 04, featuring Tag Christof, a New Mexican photographer who has been chasing Americana for over a decade now.

In the truest terms, Ulises is a collection of musings, longings, and assorted activities brought together by a group of friends. This is to say that friendship is the medium, ethos, and structure of Ulises.\n\nUlises Friends School is a part of Ultradependent Public School (UPS) transforming BAK, basis voor actuele kunst, into a schoolhouse and a curriculum to learn what we really need to enact the worlds we really want.Â Emphasizing study as a radically collective, public labor that lives in-between institutionalized hierarchies, UPS inhabits the edges between formal classrooms and everyday life.\n\nAll participants will have the opportunity to be included in a cumulative publication, a âYearbook[let]â made over the three workshop periods.\n\nDay 1: âWith Friends Like Theseâ¦â\n\nDay 2: âTruth be Told / You Didnât Hear it From Meâ¦â\n\nDay 3: âLetâs Stay in Touchâ\n\nMultiple Formats\n\nMarch 16-18, 2023\n\nMultiple Formats: Contemporary Art Book Symposium weaves together conversations about artist books and higher education, pedagogical practices involving artist books, artist advocacy, and artist book distribution, collection, and access.

Enough is enough is enough.\n\nA Certain Kind of Space: How We Sustain Each Other\n\nA Certain Kind of Space: How We Sustain Each Other was part of Common Fieldâs 2020 Online Convening. Watch the video here!\n\nBuilding on previous convening dialogues, presenters ask each other and audience members: How do economics, location, size, and identity shape an artist collective and impact decision making? Who gets to take part? Given the long history of grassroots organizing by artists, why be an artist-run organization in 2020?\n\nWhat does it mean for artistic spaces to survive the current capitalist economic system we work under? Members of artist-run collectives Grizzly Grizzly, Living Room Light Exchange, âsindikit, and Ulises openly discuss how organizational development in itself has become a creative practice, and how that informs their accountability to the artists and the communities they engage. Running an organization often means interacting with, and subverting, an economic system. What is the impact of working this way? This conversation places independent organizations from various geographic locations, which are negotiating different constraints, in dialogue to expand practical strategies for survival, stewardship, and conceptual engagement.\n\nCommon Field Convening\n\nArchival Video\n\nPress Play â LIVE!\n\nSunday, May 31, 2â4PM\n\nRegister\n\nLooking forward to participating in FORTUNEâs online panel with other QT/POC-run small presses and print spaces, including No Shame Distro, Sponge Gourd Collective, Endless Editions, and Other Publishing to discuss print resources and futures.\n\nAs we come together toward an uncertain future, we hope to ground ourselves in print as an act of resource-sharing, of radical gathering, of material resilience â something to hold on to. Join us as we connect with print collectives to share experiences and best practices for inspired, sustainable, accessible, and community-oriented work.\n\nWhat are the strategies, sources of support, and print forebears on which we can lean? How do we continue to document this coming-together?\n\nThis program is part of FORTUNEâs archival practice during the Year of the Rat. Project support provided by The Velocity Fund administered by Temple Contemporary at Tyler School of Art and Architecture, Temple University with generous funding from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.\n\nSci-Fi Sunday, Reading\n\nSunday, January 26, 2020, 2â3pm\n\nRepresenting Ulises for Sci-Fi Sunday at the PMA, poet and artist AnaÃ¯s Duplan will share some of his favorite passages from Colson Whiteheadâs The Intuitionist. The Sci-Fi Sunday reading series is in conjunction with the exhibition âDesigns for Different Futures.â\n\nAnaÃ¯s Duplan is the founding curator for the Center for Afrofuturist Studies, an artist residency program for artists of color, based in Iowa City. He now works as Program Manager at Recess and Adjunct Assistant Professor in Poetry at Columbia University.\n\nThe Intuitionist concerns the travails of Lila Mae Watson, the first black woman elevator inspector in a New York-esque city. The novel seizes upon an unsung wonder in our midst, the elevator, and sings its history, its technology, its romance, adding to the novelistâs solid research a scintillating pinch of sci-fi fantasy. The extensive guild of metropolitan elevator inspectors is split, it would seem, between the Empiricists, who plod through their inspections one material criterion at a time, and the Intuitionists, who take a more mystical, gestalt approach to the detection of safety flaws.\n\nOdds and Ends\n\nFriday, December 6, 2019\n\nSee you at the Odds and Ends Art Book Fair at the Yale University Art Gallery, Friday, December 6th, 11:30 am-4:30 pm â Free and Open to the Public!\n\nWhen the Whirlwind Begins\n\nNovember 8âDecember 11, 2019\n\nWeâre excited to be included in When the Whirlwind Begins at The Anderson Gallery at Virgina Commonwealth University.

Agitating around issues of part-time contracts, workplace safety, lack of benefits, and equity across different vectors, recent months have witnessed a wave of unionizing, landmark labor discrimination lawsuits, public salary sharing, and work for equity of representation of critics and cultural voices, amongst other highly visible and completely invisible work.\n\nWhat comes next after this summer of struggle? Join the conversation, moderated by Michelle Fisher, on behalf of Art + Museum Transparency. Sheâll be joined by New Museumâs Dana Kopel, Drew Ambrogi of Coworker.org, independent curator ChaÃ©dria LaBouvier, and Sara Ziff founder of Model Alliance.\n\nRSVP, Free to attend! If you can, help us out by bringing a snack, or drink, or chair.\n\nCurrent and former employees of art institutions started sharing the terms and salaries of their employment in a public Google Spreadsheet titled âArt/Museum Salary Transparency 2019,â started by Michelle. You can view the spreadsheet here and add your information through this form.\n\nScreening: Reza Abdohâs The Blind Owl\n\nThursday, July 18, 6â8 PM\n\nâThe Blind Owlâ Still with Ron Athey\n\nPlease join us for a screening of Reza Abdohâs âThe Blind Owlâ along with an introduction by Bidoun Senior Editor Michael C. Vazquez. This will be the final program presented by Bidoun in conjunction with Publishing As Practice, an experimental publisher-in-residence project hosted by Ulises and funded by the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage.\n\nReza Abdoh was celebrated for his immersive and maximalist theatre productions, which drew on Greek myth, cable television, BDSM and fairy tales, and made use of unusual urban spaces and audio-visual media. Yet had Abdoh not passed away at the too-young age of thirty-two, he almost certainly would have become a filmmaker of renown.\n\nâThe Blind Owlâ (1992) is Abdohâs only complete feature film. Shot in and around East Los Angeles with members of his Dar a Luz theatre ensemble between performances of the play Bogeyman (1991), the film provides a curious counterpoint to Abdohâs immersive, maximalist, adrenaline-fueled theater productions. Its narrative explores abjection, illness, and belonging through a diverse cast of characters, including sex workers, a diabetic mortician and his caregiver, and a blind man and his disabled transgender companion. The Blind Owl unfurls amid an atmosphere of melancholy that, although often moving, is wholly devoid of affect. The filmâs slow, meditative pacing and contemplative posture have inspired comparisons to theater director Robert Wilsonâs symbolist work, the films of Robert Bresson, and the 1960s American TV show, The Outer Limits.\n\n2019 COMMON FIELD PHILADELPHIA CONVENING\n\nApril 25-28, 2019\n\nUlises is proud to announce our partnership with Common Field â a national network of experimental, independent, visual arts organizations and organizers â to bring the annual Convening to Philadelphia, PA from April 25â28, 2019. The Common Field Convening is an itinerant gathering that brings together 500+ local and national arts organizers to explore the state of the field of artists organizations and to share resources, knowledge and methods for artist-led, artist-run, and artist-centered projects, spaces and practices.\n\nOver the past year, Common Field has worked with Ulises as part of a group of 14 local organizing partners as well as a growing network of 80+ Philadelphia arts organizations and organizers in order to connect the local contexts and conditions with the interests of the national Common Field Network.\n\nAs a platform for gathering the many artist centered organizations, the Convening recognizes the value of their contributions as a critical and central part of the cityâs cultural fabric. It builds awareness for these practices that often take place in unique contexts, and serve and represent more diverse communities. Together we understand there is an urgency to gather around issues of social justice and equity, as well as practical needs and tools for many organizations in our network.\n\nFind out more about the Convening and get your tickets online.

Barr will be joined by writers Meg Pendoley and Blanche Brown in a series of readings for the event.\n\nâConditionerâ considers womenâs sense of alienation from their bodies, caused by gender norms and beauty ideals, and the ways that the wellness and skincare industries either alleviate or exacerbate that alienation. Conditioner explores the nuances of the subject, accounting for the history of American cosmetics and skincare, as well as the ways that preceding feminist movements have addressed them. This is Barrâs second publication with GenderFail.\n\nLiz Barr is an interdisciplinary artist based in West Philadelphia. She makes work about bodies and how we build them. Her zines can be found in libraries and bookstores in Philadelphia and elsewhere, including at Printed Matter, Inc.; Artbook at MoMA PS1; Quimbyâs; and Ulises.\n\nMeg Pendoley is a writer living in Philadelphia. Sheâs interested in queer homes (bodies, houses, neighborhoods), the boundaries they share, and how what happens there might be recorded and kept. Her work appears in Apiary, Cleaver, and Tin Houseâs Open Bar.\n\nBlanche Brown is a poet from north Florida.

GenderFail embraces failure as a site of cultural production. GenderFail has been apart of exhibitions, programs and events at MoMA PS1 (Long Island City), The International Center of Photography (NYC), Wendyâs Subway (Brooklyn), Studio Museum (Harlem), William College Museum of Art (Williamstown), Vox Populi (Philadelphia), EFA Project Space (NYC) and many others.\n\nCommunists Anonymous: First Gathering in Philadelphia\n\nThursday, March 21, 7pm\n\nJoin the first gathering of Communists Anonymous in Philadelphia, a celebration of the constitutive book âSolution 275â294: Communists Anonymousâ (edited by Ingo Niermann and Joshua Simon, Sternberg Press, 2017), with Hammam Aldouri, Mark Johnson, Pavel Khazanov, Kate Kraczon, Marina McDougall Vella, Joshua Simon, Helen Stuhr-Rommereim, and everyone interested in sharing their relations to communisms present, past, and future.\n\nThe members of Communists Anonymous (COMA) suffer from an incurable belief in communism. They donât share any particular school, but they do share an extreme sense of empathy and justice, and therefore detest more or less any form of private property. Because there is currently no communist state in existence, acting out their passion would hopelessly distress them, at best curbing and stabilizing the brutalities of capitalist society.\n\nCOMA is meant to evolve into a worldwide cluster of self-help groups where incurable communists can discuss their recent temptations and relapses in the futile fight against capitalism. COMAâs âfearless moral inventoryâ challenges the historical manifestations of communism as being substantially incomplete in thought and practice and places communism again where it originatesâin the realm of fiction. COMA believes that the most vital dialectics in human history are at play in fiction contradicting reality. Only as fiction can communism manifest itself again beyond doubt.\n\nâSolution 275â294 Communists Anonymous,â Ingo Niermann, Joshua Simon (Eds.)

This collection spans fifty years of Wildingâs artistic production, feminist art pedagogy, and participation in, and organizing of, feminist art collectives, such as the Feminist Art Program, Womanhouse, Womanspace Gallery, and the Womanâs Building. Included are contributions by Faith Wilding, Amelia Jones, Mario Ontiveros, Irinaari Starkhova, Jenni Sorkin, Elizabeth Hess, Mira Schor, Keith Vaughn, Lauren Basing, Shannon Stratton and Daniel Tucker.\n\nFor this event, Wilding will engage in a dialogue with former student, Daniel Tucker, following an introduction by Shannon Stratton, curator of Wildingâs retrospective, âFaith Wilding: Fearful Symmetries.â\n\nShannon R. Stratton is an artist, curator, and writer. She cofounded the artist-run organization Threewalls, Chicago, and until recently the William and Mildred Lasdon Chief Curator at the Museum of Arts and Design, New York.\n\nDaniel Tucker is an Assistant Professor and Graduate Program Director at Moore College of Art & Design here in Philadelphia.\n\nDetails on the book, here\n\nImage: Faith Wilding; excerpt from âWaitingâ performed at Womanhouse, 1972.\n\nCarmen Winantâs âMy Birthâ: Book Launch + Experimental Lecture\n\nThursday, March 7, 6:30â8:30PM\n\nPlease join Ulises for an experimental lecture/book launch by artist and writer Carmen Winant.\n\nIn lieu of a conventional reading or talk, Carmen will deliver a fifteen-minute original script over top of a video that she created â largely looking at the visual content of artists and medical professionals â that acts a compliment to her book, âMy Birth.â The performance will probe the ways that we see and do not see the experience of childbirth.\n\nA book of text and image, âMy Birthâ interweaves photographs of the artist Carmen Winantâs mother giving birth to her three children with found images of other, anonymous, women undergoing the same bodily experience. As the pictorial narrative progresses, from labor through delivery, the womenâs postures increasingly blend into one another, creating a collective body that strains and releases in unison.\n\nIn addition to the photographic sequence, âMy Birthââa facsimile of Winantâs own journalâincludes an original text by the artist exploring the shared, yet solitary, ownership of the experience of birth. âMy Birthâ asks: What if birth, long shrouded and parodied by popular culture, was made visible? What if a comfortable and dynamic language existed to describe it? What if, in picturing the process so many times over and insisting on its very subjectivity, we understood childbirth, and its representation, to be a political act?\n\nIn 2018, Carmen Winant participated in the group exhibitions Being: New Photography at the Museum of ModernArt, Another Echo at the Sculpture Center (NY), and a yet-to-be-titled show at the Columbus Museum of Art; solo exhibitions will take place at Miller Contemporary (NY), Stene Projects (Stockholm), and Cave (Detroit). Winant regularly contributes to Aperture, Cabinet, Time, The Believer, and Frieze magazines, and is at work on a book about the nature of practice.\n\nBook Release: I Will What I Want: Women, Design, and Empowerment\n\nSaturday, February 16, 2â4PM\n\nThe book âI Will What I Want: Women, Design, and Empowermentâ accompanied a 2018 exhibition of the same name, which was presented in New York City and Mexico City. In it, design curators Jimena Acosta Romero and Michelle Millar Fisher explore the complex and contradictory role that design has played in shaping womenâs reproductive agencies since the mid-twentieth century, through second wave feminism, to the non-binary intersections of the present.\n\nThe exhibition presents objects, interfaces, and clothing that has sought to qualify those who have uteruses, menstruate, and/or identify as women as independent and creative subjects in a material world mostly designed by men and for men.\n\nThe book invites the reader to contemplate, from their own perspective, the ways in which these designs have - sometimes for good and at others for bad - governed, shaped, and facilitated their embodied experiences.\n\nThe event is a chance to highlight some of the stories from the book, and engage in audience discussion of this project in the context of several other great recent publications in the same vein. There will be ten copies given away to the first ten visitors who claim them.\n\nMichael C. Vazquez: Surrealist Self-Fashioning\n\nSunday, January 27, 2â4pm\n\nImage: Colette Omogbai, âAgony,â 1963. Oil on Hardboard\n\nJoin us on Sunday, January 27 from 2â4 pm for an illustrated lecture by Bidoun Senior Editor Michael C. Vazquez focusing on surrealist self-fashioning. RSVP HERE\n\nThe paintings of the Nigerian artist Colette Omogbai provoked extreme reactions in the early 1960s, with their vivid, impastoed colors and violently abstracted figures, which conjoined human and animal, life and death. Vazquez explores the contexts on this lost-found artistâgiven pride of place in Okwui Enwezoorâs 2016 Postwar exhibitionâamid other 1960s surrealists in Nigeria, Lebanon, and the United States.\n\nMichael C. Vazquez is a writer, editor and curator whose primary interests include cultural diplomacy, little magazines, music, intimacy, and food. He is a Senior Editor at Bidoun, an award-winning journal of art, culture, and ideas from the Middle East and elsewhere. Previously he edited Transition: An International Review, a magazine of art and writing about Africa and its many diasporas. He was curator-in-residence for the Delfina Foundationâs inaugural season on âThe Politics of Foodâ and a fellow at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. He collaborates frequently with the Colloquium for Unpopular Culture at New York University, and with the artistic working groups Electronic Textures and Women on Airplanes.\n\nBidoun\n\nNovember 29, 2018-July 19, 2019\n\nFor the third and final installment of Publishing as Practice, Bidoun will stage a partial version of its infamous Bidoun Library. Founded in 2009, the Bidoun Library is a presentation of printed matter, carefully selected with zero regard for taste or excellence, that documents the innumerable ways that people have depicted and defined â that is, slandered, celebrated, obfuscated, hyperbolized, ventriloquized, photographed, surveyed, and/or exhumed â the vast, vexed, nefarious construct known as âthe Middle East.â\n\nIn addition to publications, the library will have on view a selection of trailers from the little known genre of Iranian-American âB Movies.â Produced mainly in Los Angeles in the years after the revolution, these resolutely un-canonical (and often un-watchable) low budget films feature mainly American casts with a few Iranian actors. They are the direct descendents of filmfarsi, the vernacular B Movie genre that dominated popular Iranian cinema before 1979, and which employed many of the same directors. Much, if not all, was lost in translation. Some of these films were exported to Asia; others have become cult hits among pulp connoisseurs. Seen together, they shape a schizophrenic picture of what these diasporic directors once imagined the formula for a successful Hollywood action film to be.\n\nThursday, November 29, 7pm: Reza Abdoh: Theatre Visionary\n\nWednesday, December 5, 6pm: Reza Abdohâs Showtapes & Short Films\n\nReza Abdohâs Showtapes and Short Films\n\nWednesday, December 5, 6pm\n\nâSleeping With the Devil,â 1988. USA. Directed by Reza Abdoh\n\nThis screening is at the ICA Philadelphia and is free and open to the public, though registration is appreciated. Register Here\n\nâReza Abdoh: Showtapes and Short Filmsâ is the second of three film screenings presented by Bidoun in conjunction with Publishing As Practice. Bidounâwhose work as a nonprofit and former print magazine focuses on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporasâis Ulisesâs third publisher resident as part of Publishing As Practice. As part of their programming, Bidoun has organized a selection of video excerpts and short films by Iranian-American multimedia artist, Reza Abdoh.\n\nWith his beginnings in experimental theater, Abdoh later took to film and video art, incorporating the same raw energy and subversive imagery that propelled his notoriety as a playwright and director. The fiery intensity of his productions erupts from the erratic choreography and impassioned performances of his casts, fused with his volatile cuts and crude layering of popular culture and iconoclasm. Abdoh sourced and spliced a miscellany of visual motifs, ranging from TV and BDSM to American patriotism and advertisements. His maximalist aesthetic strikes with fervor, weaponizing the anger and alienation experienced by those affected by systemic racism and the AIDS crisis in the United States.\n\nCompiled by his collaborator Adam Soch, the âshowtapesâ present segments of Abdohâs most known theater productions, Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice, Bogeyman, The Law of Remains, and Tight White Right (1990â93). As the first video work made by Abdoh following his own HIV diagnosis, Sleeping with the Devil (1988) stitches together screen tests of a multilingual recount of reporter Geraldo Riveraâs interview with cult leader Charles Manson, and probes the potential for empathy through the inflection and delivery of the actors; while Daddyâs Girl (1991) is a lewd and twisted testimony of sexual abuse and violent revenge. The Tryst (1995), a portion of Abdohâs unfinished second feature, closes the program with the sole footage that was edited by Abdoh before his death and later shown at his memorial, offering a glimpse into a film career tragically cut short.\n\nProgram approx. 60 min.\n\nVideo from the productions The Hip-Hop Waltz of Eurydice, Bogeyman, The Law of Remains, and Tight White Right. 1990â93. USA. Directed by Reza Abdoh. Video design by Adam Soch. 25 min.\n\nSleeping with the Devil. 1988. USA. Directed by Reza Abdoh. With Luis Zaldivar, Ken Roht, Michael Whitmore, Anthony Cristian, Paul Durand, Ingrid A., Steve Oglesby. 12 min.\n\nDaddyâs Girl. 1991. USA. Directed by Reza Abdoh. Cinematography by Adam Soch.

With Tom Fitzpatrick, Tom Pearl, Tony Torn. 7 min.\n\nReza Abdoh: Theatre Visionary\n\nThursday, November 29, 7â8:45pm\n\nFree event: Ticket reservations are suggested\n\nâReza Abdoh: Theatre Visionaryâ is one of three films presented by Bidoun Projects in conjunction with Publishing As Practice: Bidoun, an experimental publisher-in-residence project hosted by Ulises and funded by the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage. Bidounââwhose work as a nonprofit and former magazine focuses on art and culture from the Middle East and its diasporasââis Ulisesâs third publisher resident. The evening will begin with a screening of âReza Abdoh: Theatre Visionary,â a feature length documentary on the pioneering Iranian filmmaker, and conclude with a panel discussion with members of Bidoun.\n\nCreated by Reza Abdohâs longtime video collaborator and archivist Adam Soch, this documentary builds a vivid portrait of Reza Abdoh through archival footage and recent interviews. Members of the Dar a Luz theater company chronicle the making of successive productions with Abdoh in Los Angeles, New York, and abroad. The film also features the artistâs family, evoking a childhood deeply altered by the history of Abdohâs native Iran and an adult creative life in America, bearing the scars of the tumultuous 1980sâthe decade of Reaganism, the end of the Cold War, and the AIDS epidemic that would eventually take his life. Traversing this cultural divide, Abdoh reflected in a 1994 interview, âIâm just an addict for American culture, and Iâm obsessive about it, and it makes me angry. There is so much food for thought and observation in American cultureâ¦. I find it very powerful culture, and I like to critique it, and, in a sense, see where itâs heading and where it can go.â\n\nAdam Soch, US, 2015. 99 min\n\nDominica Closing with Mandy Harris Williams + DJ Osagie\n\nSunday, November 4, 2â6 pm\n\nCelebrate the closing of our second of three publisher residents for Publishing as Practice: Martine Syms has operated through Dominica Publishing. The event will launch with a workshop with LA/NOLA/NYC-based artist Mandy Harris Williams and continue with a set from beloved local DJ, Osagie OG. Discussion, beats, drinks, and snacks.\n\n2PM Mandy Harris Williams will lead audiences in the workshop #BrownUpYourFeed - Getting Fed by Your Feed: An image says a thousand words and reifies hundreds of concepts. An image indicates tens of race, gender and interactive structures in how it is conceived, created, distributed and attended to. This talk/workshop asks us to examine why we follow what we do, and more importantly, how it is serving us. Many of us use Instagram with automaticity, not acknowledging that the images we are feeding ourselves work against our self esteem and value system. How can we design our followed media to sustain and augment our self esteem?\n\n4-6PM+ DJ Set with Osagie OG.\n\nMandy Harris Williams is a theorist, multimedia conceptual artist, writer, educator, and internet/community academic. She is from New York and currently living in Los Angeles. In a nutshell, Mandyâs work seeks to get everybody the love that they deserve.

The book captures a span of 365 days during which the artist updated the 160-character âbioâ section of her Twitter account each day. While tweets are regularly captured by corporate data storage centers this âbioâ section remains the only untraceable and non-archived part of the softwareâs superstructure. âBioâ ultimately left no record of itself, complicating the normative binaries of online/offline and digital/print. An experiment in erasure, self-deletion, and visibility in the expanded sphere of the net, âBioâ anchors itself in the wider lineage of artistsâ canceled texts, but in the age of new data as âsoftâ power.\n\nThe work featured in the New Museum Triennial anthology, The Animated Reader: Poetry of âSurround Audienceâ (ed. Brian Droitcour), and is currently on view as a 365-day internet installation at Contemporary Journal (ed. Carolina Rito).\n\nMaryam Monalisa Gharavi is an artist, poet, and theorist whose work explores the interplay between aesthetic and political valences in the public domain. Prior publications include a translation of Waly SalomÃ£oâs Algaravias: Echo Chamber (Ugly Duckling Presse), nominated for a 2017 PEN Award for Poetry in Translation; the poetry volume The Distancing Effect (BlazeVOX); the artist publication Apparent Horizon 2 (Bonington Gallery); and the chapbook Alphabet of an Unknown City (Belladonna*).\n\nMalcolm Harris is a writer in Philadelphia and the author of âKids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials.â\n\nAfter Ulises (CarriÃ³n)\n\nSunday, July 29, 2018, 2â4PM\n\nPlease join us for a very special presentation entitled âAfter Ulises (CarriÃ³n): Artistsâ Books and DIY Publishing in & Around The Netherlands.â RSVP\n\nAs a project space for bookworks, Ulises CarriÃ³nâs âOther Books and Soâ (Amsterdam, 1975-79) was an experiment across contemporary art, poetry and experimental archiving. It continued a history that began with Fluxus in the 1960s and became the blueprint for a number of artistsâ books and DIY publishing spaces, initiatives and projects in and around the Netherlands, from the 1980s until today. In his informal talk, Florian Cramer will reconstruct this history - and its contemporary overlaps with zine culture and media activism, - show excerpts of Ulises CarriÃ³nâs video works and, with a bit of luck, phone in a former collaborator of CarriÃ³n in the Netherlands.\n\nFlorian Cramer is a reader at Willem de Kooning Academy, Rotterdam, Netherlands, where he also volunteers for the DIY publishing and experimental arts venues & projects PrintRoom, De Player and ZineCamp. He wrote the afterword for Alessandro Ludovicoâs âPost-Digital Printâ and co-authored the zine âThe Moral of the Xerox: Missaletteâ with former Ulises resident Clara Balaguer.\n\nImage: Thunderclap, zine by Amy Suo Wu, that distributes the erased writings of Chinese anarcho-feminist, He-Yin Zhen (1886-1920)\n\nMartine Syms/Dominica\n\nJuly 22âNovember 4, 2018\n\nPhoto: Constance Mensh\n\nFor the second installment of Publishing As Practice, Martine Syms will front as Dominica, the publishing imprint founded by the artist in 2011 dedicated to exploring blackness as a reference, marker, and topic. For the duration of the residency, Martine will transform the Ulises space into a shop selling new screen printed apparel and feature select texts, visual materials, and programming produced by the artist and collaborators. Syms will refashion the Dominica and Ulises websites into in a digital storefront and live streaming platform in the style of an online Home Shopping Network.

Founded by Clara Lobregat Balaguer and Kristian Henson in 2010, the OCD is a research and project production platform out of ParaÃ±aque City and Brooklyn, for social practice in art and design.\n\nHardworking Goodlookingâs three-week residency will be an exercise in running a âmosquito press,â referring to the illegal presses of the Martial Law era (1972-1986) that were critical of the conjugal dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos. As freedom of the press is currently threatened under the regime of neoauthoritarian president Rodrigo Duterte, HWGL will organize a series of intimate talks (and potluck meals) to discuss the Philippinesâ current political situation with Filipino academics. The content generated in these discussionsâplus content mined from long-running research into ideological internet trollsâwill be printed as an homage to the mosquito press format: compiled as the documentation/ephemera of collective radical action, quickly and precariously printed, critical of a dictatorial regime, distributed via informal networks, often at personal risk.\n\nThey Can Never Kill All of the Mosquitoes Reviving the Mosquito Press\n\nApril 14-15, Deep Listening Forum + Potluck Discussions\n\nApril 18-20, Open Studio Visiting Hours\n\nApril 22, Deep Listening Lecture Performance + Mosquito Press Launch\n\nDear Reader: Study in Blue\n\nTuesday, March 13, 6:30â8PM\n\nJoin Ulises for a group discussion facilitated by Connie Yu on the essays âCommitment as a Non-Performativeâ by Sara Ahmed, Andrea Long Chuâs rumination in the work âStudy in Blue: affect, trauma, eventâ from Women & Performance, 2017, and excerpts from the book âThe Undercommonsâ by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney..

Moving between models of laboratory, residency, and academy, ÃsÃ¬kÃ² privileges experimentation over conventional approaches to art making and curatorial inquiry, encouraging participants to workshop ideas, proposals and projects for long-term development and implementation.\n\nâÃsÃ¬kÃ²: On the Future of Artistic and Curatorial Pedagogies in Africaâ chronicles six editions of the program: the first two editions having taken place in Lagos, Nigeria and the subsequent four editions in Accra, Dakar, Maputo, and Addis Ababa, the capitals of Ghana, Senegal, Mozambique and Ethiopia, respectively. The publication documents each unique but related iteration and indexes the work and reflections of the more than 70 cultural producers (from 15 African countries) who have participated in ÃsÃ¬kÃ² from 2010-2016.\n\nStephanie Baptist is an independent cultural producer, editor and writer. For over a decade she has collaborated with noted contemporary artists, organizations and individuals.

What was lost when the scrolls in the ancient library of Alexandria were destroyed? How did Catherine the Greatâs collecting change the way we think? How do Jeff Bezos and Amazon.com expand our appreciation of books as objects? Though the ways we communicate and live vary, history has been created, recorded, and preserved in writing.

By creating proposals and aesthetic models for others to use and adapt, she defines herself as an initiator rather than an author, and often collaborates with multiple institutions as well as many individuals so that the full realization of her artwork occurs when others adopt and perpetuate it.\n\nNora Elmarzouky grew up between Egypt and Pennsylvania. With a BA from Tufts University in International Relations, coupled with her studies in Spain, Morocco, and the Czech Republic, her interest in the interactions between humans, culture, identity, and the built environment was enhanced. She is currently supporting alternative Arab spaces, connecting sustainable dots, a Founders Fellow with Impact100, and expanding in.site collaborative in Philadelphia - a collective of designers and researchers working to make urban development and change more participatory and equitable.
