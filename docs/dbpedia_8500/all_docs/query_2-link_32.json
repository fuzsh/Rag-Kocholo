        "text": "# 1.1 Quality and pertinence of the project's research and innovation objectives (and the extent to which they are ambitious, and go beyond the state of the art) #@QUA-LIT-QL@# Due to multiple aspects, from climate change, space development, diminishment of resources, and overpopulation crisis, the future has become the most important time of the present. \"The future starts now,' says Boaventura de Sousa Santos, 1 Coimbra's University Emeritus Professor. From science fiction to future technologies, humanity has been growing dependant on future scenarios. While some futures are based on algorithms, numbers and calculations 2 (European Commission Report, 2017), there are others, which depend on human imagination. The future is as \"real\" as the past, both residing in imagination; either remembered or as an anticipation of events (K. Lewin, 1936 3). Milojević; Inayatullah (2015) 4 post 4 types of future; predictive, interpretive, critical, and deconstructive. The symbolic constitution of the Future concerns not only how the Future is strategically built, but also how it is developed, grows and influences human imagination. Nowadays, much debate is devoted to Futures Studies from the quantitative perspective aiming to map the future and predict it. This research goes in a new direction, it will add by providing new cutting-edge knowledge combining phenomenology, science fiction and imaginable futures to understand the future that is imagined. Recent studies are gaining evidence in discussing the future within the phenomenological perspective 5 , 6 , 7 , 8. Nevertheless, the literature review demonstrated few studies 9 addressing Imaginable Futures within science fiction. Searching for the word \"science fiction\" at the York Library system (2022), there were 600.000 documents, however, as \"science fiction, phenomenology,\" are searched, only 600 documents were listed. When \"science fiction, phenomenology, future imagination\" are searched, there are 7 works, and 2 somehow related to IMAFS: \"Embodied artificial intelligence in science fiction,\" and \"Three Emotional Stories: Reflections on Imagination, Narrative, and the Self 10 .\" Alan Richardson (2015 11) explains that, this happens because science fiction and future imagination are mainly dissociated in Academic studies. Science fiction is studied in Literature Studies and future imagination in mind or cognitive studies. IMAFS will cover this gap. The concept of imagination is developed in philosophy by Husserl, 12 , 13 whose phenomenology relates it to an illusion, part of the phantasy and imaginary consciousness. 14 Other philosophers elaborated on the matter as stated by Warnock (2018 15), like Sartre's work on Imagination. In the literature review covering The Philosophical Papers 16 database, imagination is found in various contexts: Theories of Imagination (127 works), Imagination and Pretense (138), and Literary Imagination (186). This proposal departs from the science fiction literature, elaborates on imaginable futures within phenomenology, and investigates science fiction literature with the focus on Anthropocene. Fiction, in Latin, is 'fingere,' meaning to shape, invent, and make a pretense. From pure imagination to creative skills, the capacity to compose anew, inventing new realities with the use of science and technology in the literature world is called science fiction (Walsh, 2003) 17. Commonly disseminated through novels, short stories, movies, Pettersson (2018 18) points that these fictional worlds deeply influence reality, from future innovations to shaping human cognition. For example, many scientific discoveries were first described in fictional texts, and\n\nFutures research has lived up to Wells’ prediction by becoming a legitimate scholarly discipline. In this paper, we explore the role of science fiction in creating prototypes of imagined and better futures evident in these narratives even when they are distinct from the futures they predict. We explore the contributions and warnings of utopian and dystopian stories to the development and the specific realisation of future business visions. By drawing on Mannermaa’s framework, a selection of science fiction writings, and the description of sources for innovations, we are able to examine the impact of prototyping on business management. Within this paper we describe scenarios as the mechanisms that test strategic direction while the prototype offers a mechanism for the analysis of business vision. We explore the synergy that exists between creative fiction authors and futurologists, discussing the predictive elements and the source of inspirations for innovators. We argue that while business futurologists appear to offer pedestrian “predictions” and future models, the most impact is achieved with views of the future that are presented as prototypical stories; stories that plant a seed that germinates and comes to fruition in a more distant future.\n\nDirected Fiction is a strategic foresight tool designed to simultaneously consider multiple plausible future states. Four specific foresight tools were employed to develop the scenarios described; Framing, Horizon Scanning, STEEPLE Analysis, and an Axes of Uncertainty diagram. This paper describes a proof-of-concept eBook that uses these tools of foresight to direct a series of fictional short stories towards a contemporary issue. To fully immerse the reader in the scenarios generated, fifteen short stories have been arranged in a Choose Your Own Adventure format comprised of eight separate plotlines with five different plausible outcomes. The point of view for this eBook is written for a Humanitarian Response Team responding to refugees fleeing across the Moldovan border to escape the War in Ukraine. Consider that this same technique could be applied to a whole host of contemporary issues, for example; to examine economic conditions, to consider policy directions, or even to speculate on the performance of political candidates prior to elections. The eBook is available for free here.\n\nThis article looks at how futures studies can use storyworlds to address some of the challenges the field faces. It provides an overview of social constructionism, integral theory/integral futures, and sense-making in the context of the current evolution of futures methodologies. This article also examines the role of narratives generally and science fiction in particular in exploring and communicating about the future. An overview of what storyworlds are and how they have been used in science fiction and futures studies is followed by a pair of cases studies focused on two worldbuilding projects, one for the fictional world of Rilao and the other for the storyworld created for the 2002 film Minority Report. The article concludes with an analysis of how the worldbuilding process is compatible with social constructionism, integral theory/integral futures, and sense-making.\n\nScenarios are stories. In the diverse field of scenario planning, this is perhaps the single point of universal agreement. Yet if scenarios are stories, their literary qualities are often underdeveloped. Scenarios used in business and government frequently do not contain a relatable protagonist, move a plot toward resolution, or compellingly use metaphor, imagery, or other emotionally persuasive techniques of literature. In these cases, narrative is relegated to an adjunct role of summarizing the final results of the workshop. While this neglect of narrative may be reasonable in some contexts, the power of narrative should not be underestimated. Scenario planning methodologies can benefit from using diverse narrative techniques to craft compelling and infectious visions of the future. This article explores the relationship between science fiction and scenarios as story genres and investigates a creative story-telling technique, “Science Fiction Prototyping” (Johnson, 2011). While the method is promising, it is an ultimately problematic means to incorporating narrative into scenario planning.\n\nScience fiction is experiencing a renaissance as the rate of change and uncertainty about the future increases. Organizations, innovators, and changemakers alike are turning to the genre to navigate the future and design for the present, often unaware that generating and using images of the future for strategic purposes is a cornerstone of foresight practice. A fundamental concept in science fiction that is fueling the use of the genre as a strategic tool is worldbuilding. This paper explores how worldbuilding is currently leveraged, how it relates to design and foresight, and how it might further enrich both disciplines. It will propose that design and foresight may benefit from the worldbuilding processes of science fiction authors to design for coherence, user-test worlds, and help society develop a superstructure of culture in order to imagine and create new visions of the future.\n\nEuropean science policy (so-called Horizon 2020) is guided by Grand Societal Challenges (GSCs) with the explicit aim of shaping the future. In this paper we propose an innovative approach to the analysis and critique of Europe's GSCs. The aim is to explore how speculative and creative fiction offer ways of embodying, telling, imagining, and symbolising 'futures', that can provide alternative frames and understandings to enrich the grand challenges of the 21st century, and the related rationale and agendas for ERA and H2020. We identify six ways in which filmic and literary representations can be considered creative foresight methods (i.e. through: creative input, detail, warning, reflection, critique, involvement) and can provide alternative perspectives on these central challenges, and warning signals for the science policy they inform. The inquiry involved the selection of 64 novels and movies engaging with notions of the future, produced over the last 150 years. Content analysis based on a standardised matrix of major themes and sub-domains, allows to build a hierarchy of themes and to identify major patterns of long-lasting concerns about humanity's future. The study highlights how fiction sees oppression, inequality and a range of ethical issues linked to human and nature's dignity as central to, and inseparable from innovation, technology and science. It concludes identifying warning signals in four major domains, arguing that these signals are compelling, and ought to be heard, not least because elements of such future have already escaped the imaginary world to make part of today's experience. It identifies areas poorly defined or absent from Europe's science agenda, and argues for the need to increase research into human, social, political and cultural processes involved in techno-science endeavours."
