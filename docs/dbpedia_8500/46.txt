Via the Viet Nam News Agency, I read that there is Vietnamese science fiction: Sci-fi writer inspires real world thinking, being an interview with Vietnamese SF writer Vu Kim Dung. I don’t think I’d previously been aware of a Vietnamese SF field.

Science fiction has its own large-scale world federation. It has developed rapidly and created many promising authors. In Viet Nam, writers such as Viet Linh, Pham Ngoc Toan, Pham Cao Cung and myself have created science fiction for decades. We have attracted many readers, but so far the genre hasn’t fared well.

I’m curious whether any of these folks made it to the Japanese WorldCon. Any of you met them or know their work?
