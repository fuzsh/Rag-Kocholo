Sad news for Russell Crowe.

According to The Sydney Morning Herald, the actor, 48, and his wife of nine years, Australian singer Danielle Spencer, 43, have decided to separate after nine years of marriage. The pair, who married in April 2003 in a purpose-built chapel at Crowe's farm in South Wales, have two children together, sons Charles, 8, and Tennyson, 6.

Reportedly, the split is in part due to Crowe's busy film schedule, which has kept him away from his family in Sydney for most of the year. The Australian actor has six films coming out in the next 12 months, including "Man with the Iron Fists," "Les Miserables," "Broken City," "Man of Steel," "Noah" and "Winterâ€™s Tale."

The separation is said to be amicable and the couple's number one concern is raising their sons. Crowe will continue to shoot the biblical epic, "Noah," in the U.S. while Spencer will stay with the boys in Sydney.

Crowe and Spencer first met 22 years ago on the set of "The Crossing," before he made it big in Hollywood. Following his relationship with Meg Ryan, he returned to Australia and realized that Spencer was the one for him. Crowe proposed in December 2002, saying, "The thought [of marrying her] crossed my mind the first time I met her."
