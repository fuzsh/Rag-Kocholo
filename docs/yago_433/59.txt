Russell Crowe and wife Danielle Spencer have split after nine years of marriage, according to a report.

According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the couple have separated.

Crowe, 48, and his Australian musician wife, 43, were in the spotlight early in the summer when she was photographed getting cozy with Damian Whitewood, her pro partner on the Australlian edition of Dancing With the Stars.

While she has remained in Australia with their children, he has been busy filming movies overseas.

Crowe and Spencer married in 2003. They have two sons: Charles, 8, and Tennyson, 6.
