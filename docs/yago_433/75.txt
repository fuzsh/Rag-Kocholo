Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer Separate after Nine Years of Marriage

By Nottage and Ward on October 26, 2012

Actor Russell Crowe and his wife, Australian singer Danielle Spencer, have separated after nine years of marriage, according to The Huffington Post. The couple, who had first met 22 years ago on the set of The Crossing, had married in April 2003 in South Wales and have two sons, Tennyson and Charles.

Crowe’s busy work schedule, which has kept him away from his family for the better part of this year, is reportedly one of the reasons for the couple’s split. He has six movies coming out in the next 12 months, including the biblical epic Noah, which he is currently working on. The split is reportedly amicable and the pair remain focused on raising their two sons, who live with their mother in Sydney.

5 Leslie has been the strongest representation I could ask for

Leslie has been the strongest representation I could ask for in a very complicated, emotional matter. She has continuously looked out for my best interest and the best interest of my son. She is always prompt in getting back to me and in keeping me well informed about my case.
