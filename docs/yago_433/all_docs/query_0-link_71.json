        "text": "Amid his separation and divorce from his wife, Russell Crowe is sending a huge selection of over 200 pieces of memorabilia, art, and jewelry to auction for a special sale at Sotheby’s Australia aptly titled “The Art of Divorce.”\n\nThe Oscar-winner married Australian actress and singer Danielle Spencer in 2003. The couple separated in 2012, although the couple’s divorce was only recently finalized (the online catalogue refers to Spencer as Crowe’s “former wife.”) According to the Hollywood Reporter, news of the couple’s divorce settlement surfaced around the same time that Crowe first started promoting the auction on social media, suggesting that Crowe may be monetizing some of his prize possessions to finance the settlement.\n\nIndeed, the auction includes some pricey items, including 19 collectible guitars with pre-sale estimates ranging between $233–390 and $39,000–78,000. Crowe is also offering his collection of jewelry and watches by Asprey, Cartier, Chanel, and Chopard including a 5.13-carat radiant-cut fancy yellow diamond surrounded by marquise-cut white diamonds set in 18-karat white gold and platinum, estimated to sell for between $54,932–78,486.\n\nCrowe is also selling off some of his art. Paintings from actor’s collection of Australian artists—Charles Blackman, Pro Hart, Brett Whiteley, Arthur Boyd, Sidney Nolan, and Robert Dickerson—will also go under the hammer.\n\nOther highlights include memorabilia from his Oscar-winning movie Gladiator (2000). The original chest armor Crow’s character wore is estimated at $15,700 to $23,544, and the matching wrist and shin guards are on offer, too. Crowe is even auctioning a Roman chariot from the film.\n\n“Divorce has its way of making you really examine the things that are essential in life—and the things that are not,” Crowe said in a statement. “Through the process, I had a look around and realized I had a lot of stuff. Career stuff, stuff I’ve collected, and stuff in general. Boxes and boxes of stuff… so in the spirit of moving forward into fresh air, here’s a portion of that collection of stuff.”\n\nSee more of the artwork Crowe will sell at the Sotheby’s auction below:\n\nFollow Artnet News on Facebook:\n\nWant to stay ahead of the art world?
