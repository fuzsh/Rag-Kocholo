        "text": "Russell Crowe (born April 7, 1964, Wellington, New Zealand) is a New Zealand-born Australian actor known for his commitment, intensity, and ruggedly handsome good looks. He won an Academy Award for Gladiator (2000).\n\nAt age four Crowe moved with his family to Australia. He was the son of film and television set caterers, and he made his acting debut at age six on Australian television in the wartime spy adventure series Spyforce. After returning to New Zealand in the late 1970s, Crowe cofounded the rock band Roman Antix, serving as songwriter, guitarist, and lead singer; the group later re-formed as 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and released three full-length albums before disbanding in 2005. Some of the band’s members joined his newer venture, Russell Crowe & the Ordinary Fear of God. In the mid-1980s Crowe began performing in musicals, and from 1986 to 1988 he toured with The Rocky Horror Picture Show as the cross-dressing Dr. Frank N. Furter.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nBest Picture Movie Quote Quiz\n\nIn 1990 Crowe started a film career, appearing in the war drama Prisoners of the Sun and The Crossing, a drama centred on a romantic triangle. In these early efforts, he displayed an innate ability to inhabit the characters he portrayed and for his next film, Proof (1991), received a best supporting actor award from the Australian Film Institute (AFI). Crowe’s career reached a turning point with Romper Stomper (1992), in which he played a menacing neo-Nazi. His performance earned him an AFI best actor award and attracted the attention of Hollywood. After starring as a gay man searching for love in The Sum of Us (1994), Crowe appeared in his first American film, the western The Quick and the Dead (1995). It had little success at the box office, however, as did a series of Hollywood films that followed.\n\nOnly with the role of Bud White, a brutish but vulnerable policeman, in the 1950s crime drama L.A. Confidential (1997) did Crowe’s gift for complex performance combine with a well-written story line to help produce a commercial and critical hit. He acted in a number of films in the late 1990s, earning an Academy Award nomination for his role as tobacco-industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand in The Insider (1999). Two years later he took the academy’s best actor award for his role as Maximus, a Roman general-turned-gladiator in Ridley Scott’s Gladiator. His commanding performance, which blended scenes of yearning love with those of brutal physical violence, helped make the epic one of the highest-grossing films of 2000. He won a third nomination for the best actor award with his starring role in A Beautiful Mind (2001), the story of John Forbes Nash, a real-life Nobel Prize-winning mathematician suffering from schizophrenia.\n\nCrowe also earned critical approval as Captain Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003), a seafaring epic based on the fiction series by Patrick O’Brian. In Cinderella Man (2005) he played real-life boxer James J. Braddock, who staged a timely comeback to help his family out of financial hardship during the Great Depression. After portraying an outlaw in the western 3:10 to Yuma (2007), Crowe starred as an honest policeman working in a corrupt department who tries to bring a drug lord (played by Denzel Washington) to justice in American Gangster (2007). He subsequently appeared in the CIA thriller Body of Lies (2008) and State of Play (2009), in which he played an investigative reporter.\n\nIn 2010 Crowe portrayed the titular outlaw hero in the action drama Robin Hood—his fourth collaboration with Scott—and starred as a mild-mannered man attempting to free his wife from prison in the thriller The Next Three Days. In The Man with the Iron Fists (2012), an homage to kung fu movies, he played a roguish English soldier in feudal China, and in the musical Les Misérables (2012) he performed the role of the determined police inspector Javert. Crowe subsequently appeared as a corrupt New York City mayor in the crime drama Broken City (2013); as Superman’s father, Jor-El, in Man of Steel (2013); as a New York crime boss in the fantasy Winter’s Tale (2014); and as the titular biblical figure in Noah (2014).\n\nIn 2016 Crowe and Ryan Gosling portrayed a pair of seedy private investigators looking into the death of a pornographic actress in the dark comedy The Nice Guys. The following year Crowe starred as Dr. Henry Jekyll in the action-horror film The Mummy. He later assumed the role of a Baptist preacher who sends his son to a gay conversion therapy program in Boy Erased (2018), which was based on a memoir of the same name (2016). In 2019 Crowe was cast as Roger Ailes, the founding president of the Fox News Channel, in the miniseries The Loudest Voice. He later appeared in the thriller Unhinged (2020), playing a man who terrorizes a woman after a traffic incident. In Taika Waititi’s irreverent superhero film Thor: Love and Thunder (2022), Crowe portrayed the god Zeus."
