        "text": "Russell Crowe: Oscar-winning actor, director, musician, pride of Australia, avid rugby fan, guy who threw a hotel phone against a wall that time.\n\nHe's a multifaceted artist, the Australian star is, and though his temper has made more than a few headlines over the years, news yesterday that Azealia Banks had filed a police report accusing Crowe of assault still came as a shock. It has been awhile, after all, since Crowe was publicly accused of misbehaving.\n\nWhile Banks claimed in a since-deleted Facebook post that Crowe called her the n-word, choked her, threw her out of the room (there was apparently a party in the actor's suite at a hotel in Beverly Hills) and spat on her, an alleged eyewitness told TMZ that Banks made a motion as if to throw her glass after saying, \"'You would love it if I broke my glass, stabbed you guys in the throat, and blood would squirt everywhere like some real Tarantino s--t.'\" And that's when Crowe picked her up as if in a big bear-hug and took her out of the room, the source said.\n\nInternational Incident\n\nIn 2002, Crowe personally apologized for yelling at a BAFTA Awards producer in a storage closet after his recitation of a poem during his acceptance speech for his Best Actor win for A Beautiful Mind was cut for time. Crowe insisted he wasn't upset that that part was cut, but rather that the part of his speech in which he thanked mathematician John Nash, whom he played in the film, was excised from the telecast.\n\nRestaurant Wars\n\nBBC News reported later that year that police were called to a Japanese restaurant in Knightsbridge, near famed department store Harrods, because Crowe was fighting in the bar and restroom with wealthy New Zealand businessman and rugby club owner Eric Watson. Their scuffle was reportedly broken up by Ross Kemp, a former star of the still-running British soap opera EastEnders.\n\nThe Infamous Phone Fracas\n\nIn June 2005, Crowe was charged with felony assault and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon after he was accused of throwing a telephone (the weapon in question) at an employee of NYC's Mercer Hotel, the actor allegedly having gone into a rage that the phone was broken. His rep explained that he hurled the phone at the wall and neither hurt nor assaulted anybody.\n\nThe actor did, however, end up pleading guilty to a lesser charge; he also was sued by the hotel concierge for personal damages and ended up paying an undisclosed settlement.\n\n\"I'm extremely sensitive, and that's probably where some of my negative stuff comes from,\" Crowe admitted to Australia's Sunday Night in 2014. \"I'm a little bit intuitive, so I know from a handshake whether somebody means me good or ill. And sometimes I don't want to, once I know where they're coming from, I don't want to play that game anymore.\"\n\nSitting down with Charlie Rose again, Crowe said in 2015 he tries not to take everything so seriously, but in so doing, \"it also means you gotta cut yourself a bit of slack if you're...if you're a dick every now and then, you know. It's bound to happen. You're bound to get somethin' wrong, you know.\n\n\"What I have stopped doing is, I used to...you know, you've probably read many a time that you know, 'I've hit a photographer'â€”I've never done that in my life, never, you know. It's just pure bulls--t. But what I've done is I've saved some of the most stinging verbal barbs just for those sorta people, you know. And they're shredded in now and wounded and bleeding going back to their editor...and they try and put it, like, a physical thing on the fact that I just ripped them apart emotionally with a single sentence.\""
