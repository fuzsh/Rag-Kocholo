        "text": "Russell Crowe dismissed rumours he secretly wed his girlfriend, Britney Theriot in Italy last month.\n\nFans speculated the couple tied the knot after Britney, 39, was spotted with a ring on her wedding finger during an Italian getaway.\n\nAll was revealed during a broadcast of the 2Day FM breakfast show when host Erin Molan explained she had contacted Russell, 53, directly to congratulate him on his supposed big news.\n\nPresenters of the show, Hughesy, Ed and Erin began dissecting the rumour mill when Erin revealed she went straight to the source.\n\nSaying she’d contacted the actor, sending him and his ‘new bride’ well wishes, she went on to add Russell was confused by the note.\n\nAfter Erin suggested her co-worker Hughesy had read something about the apparent marriage and ‘believed it’, Russell replied: ‘Yeah, good guess. We are not married.’\n\nBritney has been in Italy for the last few weeks supporting her boyfriend as he films his latest movie, The Pope’s Exorcist and was leaving her hotel in Rome when the photo sparking speculation was snapped.\n\nShe can be seen sporting a canary yellow sundress, round shades and most notably – a silver band around her wedding ring finger.\n\nConfirming their relationship with a tennis court kiss in November 2020, the story stands that the couple first met on set while filming Broken City.\n\nRussell worked on the project in 2013 when Britney was trying her hand at acting before swapping tinsel town for a life in real estate.\n\nNotoriously private about their relationship, the couple have never publicly addressed the details, but did appear on the red carpet together last month when they attended The Poker Face premiere together.\n\nRussell’s relationship with Britney comes after his split from ex-wife Danielle Spencer in 2018, with whom he shares two sons, Charles, 18, and 16-year-old Tennyson, with.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Russell Crowe, 58, finally makes red carpet debut with girlfriend Britney Theriot, 31, in Rome"
