        "text": "Russell Crowe has been quietly dating new Love Child star Sophia Forrest for three months, with friends saying it’s fast become “serious” after the Gladiator actor recently introduced the actress to his two young sons.\n\n“He’s completely smitten,” reveals one mate. “She has a wonderful exuberance and is a lot of fun, but she’s also really down-to-earth and has a direction in life, which he likes.\n\n“And I know from other friends that she’s just as crazy about Russell as he is about her. She adores him.”\n\nThey met on the set of his movie The Water Diviner four years ago, when she was just 18. She was cast as his character’s son’s love interest after graduating from the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts.\n\n“She definitely caught his eye then, but absolutely nothing happened. He was her first director and she found him really inspiring to work with, so I think for Sophie there was a connection there right from the start,” our source says.\n\nEarlier this year, they caught up again through mutual friends cruising on Sydney Harbour, before attending an Adele concert together."
