        "text": "Russell Crowe is as free as a bird after it emerged his marriage to Australian singer\n\nDanielle Spencer has collapsed.\n\nInsiders blamed the Gladiator star’s hellish workload on their nine-year union ending.\n\nThe couple are said to have walked away on ‘friendly terms’ after becoming the latest big Hollywood couple to lose their way this year.\n\nSpencer is said to be looking after their two boys, Charles and Tennyson, aged eight and six, while Crowe shoots his biblical epic Noah.\n\nThe move came after the 48-year-old struggled to be at home in Oz this year after working on six films: Man With The Iron Fists, Les Miserables,‘Broken City, Man of Steel, Noah and Winter’s Tale.\n\nTwo years ago, Crowe hinted he would walk away from Hollywood completely in a bid to put more time in with the family. At the time the gruff star explained: ‘I want to take a step back and put a normal rhythm back into the kids’ lives. I don’t want to get on a plane again this year.’\n\nThe pair tied the knot in a purpose-built chapel at Crowe’s farm in New South Wales in 2003.\n\nRussell admitted he first set eyes on the 43-year-old blonde 22 years ago on the set of The Crossing.\n\nHe decided to pursue her after his romance in 2000 with Proof of Life co-star, Meg Ryan, flopped.\n\nThe Oscar winner is worth an estimated £40million but it’s unknown if the couple signed a pre-nup.\n\nThe break-up puts them on this year’s scrapheap of big Hollywood couples that include Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes and Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis. Crowe’s spokesman could not be reached."
