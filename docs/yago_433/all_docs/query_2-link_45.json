        "text": "Russell Crowe hit the red carpet at the Rome Film Festival in Italy on Sunday, accompanied by his much younger girlfriend, 31-year-old Britney Theriot. Crowe is 58.\n\nThe New Zealand-born actor was there to promote his new film \"Poker Face,\" which he not only stars in, but also directed.\n\nCrowe and Theriot went public with their relationship in 2020, two years after Crowe finalized his divorce from wife of 15 years, Danielle Spencer.\n\nRUSSELL CROWE'S 'DIVORCE' AUCTION SELLS 'GLADIATOR'ARMOR, OTHER VALUABLE MOVIE GEAR\n\nThe duo was all smiles on the red carpet for the thriller, which also stars Liam Hemsworth and his sister-in-law, Elsa Pataky.\n\nTheriot's black pumps matched her boyfriend's all-black ensemble.\n\nJULIA ROBERTS HONORED, BRALESS OLIVIA WILDE, AND GEORGE AND AMAL CLOONEY'S DATE NIGHT: ACADEMY MUSEUM GALA\n\nJust days earlier, Crowe shut down claims from director P.J. Hogan that the actor had given a terrible audition with Julia Roberts for his 1997 flick, \"My Best Friend's Wedding.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nThe claim first came out in February, when an excerpt of Scott Meslow's book \"From Hollywood With Love: The Rise and Fall (and Rise Again) of Romantic Comedy\" was published in Variety. Hogan was quoted as saying that Crowe gave \"one of the worst table reads I've ever experienced.\"\n\nHogan continued, \"I don't know what went wrongâ€¦Russell was seated opposite Julia. He gripped that script, and he stared at that script, and he didn't look at her once.\"\n\nCrowe did not say anything at the time, but on Friday, he went on the defensive, sharing to his Twitter a statement denying he ever auditioned for Hogan.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Oscar winning actor wrote, \"Pure imagination on behalf of this director. I did not audition for this film. I have never done a table read with the actress mentioned.\""
