        "text": "RUSSELL Crowe has quietly offloaded his trophy Sydney mansion Te Puke to his former wife Danielle Spencer, six years after they bought it for $10m.\n\nThe Gladiator and Master and Commander star, whose Hollywood career has meant long absences from Australia, has transferred ownership solely to Danielle Spencer.\n\nSpencer has lived at the seven bedroom, four bathroom Rose Bay home with the former couple’s sons, Charlie and Tennyson, since 2011.\n\nSet on 1200 square metres overlooking the fairways of the Royal Sydney Golf Club Te Puke, pronounced “the-pook-eh’’, is Maori for “hill”.\n\nSpencer set her heart on the Federation house after a four-year search for a family home aside from their waterfront apartment at the Finger Wharf in Woolloomooloo.\n\nThe couple had considered and rejected Le Manoir, a palatial Bellevue Hill property which was too expensive and needed too much work, and the pricey waterfront Point Piper mansion, Altona.\n\nBut the year following the purchase, the couple split as Crowe continued to fly around the world making back-to-back movies which have cemented his reputation as a force in Hollywood.\n\nCrowe and Spencer met on the set of the Australian film The Crossing in 1989 when she had the higher profile from her role on TV’s The Flying Doctors.\n\nTheir initial relationship lasted five years, while he made his name in 1992’s Romper Stomper and then left Australia and Spencer behind him.\n\nCrowe had romances with co-stars including Sharon Stone, Kim Basinger and Meg Ryan.\n\nAfter five years apart, Crowe and Spencer reunited and married in 2003 at his Nana Glen farm in northern NSW.\n\nSpencer put her career on hold for their sons Charlie, now 13, and Tennyson, 10.\n\nSpencer made a comeback with the Seven Network’s Dancing With The Stars, and has since restarted her singing career.\n\nCrowe’s movies have included The Water Diviner, Noah, Les Miserables, The Man With The Iron Fists, Man of Steel and Boy Erased, which comes out next year.\n\nThe couple’s separation was confirmed when Spencer, 48, emerged with a new partner, Adam Long, last year.\n\nCrowe handed over his half of Te Puke to Spencer in November."
