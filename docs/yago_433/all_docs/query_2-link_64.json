        "text": "Russell Crowe, here with estranged wife Danielle Spencer in 2007, appeared to deny reports that he's seeing Katie Lee, Billy Joe's ex-wife, in a tweet.\n\n(Photo by FRAZER HARRISON/GETTY IMAGES)\n\nThe normally private Russell Crowe appears to admit all is not well with his marriage to Danielle Spencer in a tweet: \"As soon as I finish this job & can get home, my priority is to try to bring my family back together. These latest reports are false & cruel.\"\n\nCrowe has been away from his native Australia filming \"A Winter's Tale\" in the U.S., and the latest reports have him hooking up with Katie Lee, the pert brunette food celebrity and ex-wife of singer Billy Joel. The New York Post says they're \"dating casually.\"\n\nHe and Spencer, who have been married for nine years, have two children together. The Sydney Morning Herald reported in October that the couple had split in the wake of reports that Spencer was now seeing her \"Dancing With the Stars\" (Down Under version) partner Damian Whitewood.\n\nFor more entertainment news and gossip, look for Vicki Hyman's column 'Vicki's Dish' Tuesdays-Saturdays in The Star-Ledger."
