        "text": "When it comes to Australian Hollywood icons, there really isn’t anyone quite like Russell Crowe.\n\nWATCH: Russell Crowe responds to rumours he’s dating Terri Irwin\n\nThe 58-year-old, who was originally born in Wellington, New Zealand in 1964 before he migrated to Australia in 1985, is best known for starring in Gladiator, Les Misérables, and A Beautiful Mind, and, much like his iconic role, it seems he’s conquered a new person in his love life.\n\nBut, who are the lucky women who have been in Russell’s life? Keep reading to find out.\n\nBritney Theriot\n\nCurrently, Russell Crowe is dating American actor-turned-real estate agent Britney Theriot.\n\nRussell and Britney, 31, first met on the set of Broken City in 2013, and have recently made their red carpet debut.\n\nThe pair were first spotted in public together by the Daily Mail in November 2020, and were spotted earlier this year on a family trip in Italy, alongside Russel’s two sons.\n\nAccording to 9Honey, Britney was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and began a real estate company called Mirambell Realty in 2017.\n\nWhile her Instagram profile is private, you can request to follow her on @britriot.\n\nTerri Irwin\n\nBack in 2020, rumours were rampant that Russell Crowe and Terri Irwin were dating after the Hollywood actor visited the Australian zoologist at the John Oliver Koala Chlamydia Ward, according to New Idea.\n\n“Russell and Terri have definitely been spending more time together in recent times,” a source told New Idea in 2019.\n\nBut, as it turns out, the two may have just been good friends.\n\nIn a candid interview with The Courier Mail in March 2020, the 56-year-old revealed that Russell was one of the first people to check up on her when her husband Steve Irwin tragically passed. Neither Russell nor Terri have confirmed their rumoured romance.\n\n“Russell is such a wonderful influence on Terri and she’s always glowing when she’s with him or has just spent time with him,” the inside source continued.\n\nDanielle Spencer\n\nBefore he was dating Britney Theriot and romantically linked to Terri Irwin, Russell Crowe was married to actress and singer Danielle Spence, 51.\n\nThe couple first met in 1989 on the set of The Crossing and had an on-and-off again relationship before tying the knot in Russell’s own backyard in Nana Glen, NSW, in 2003. They announced they had split nine years later in 2012 before officially divorcing in 2015.\n\nThe pair also share two children together, Charlie Spencer Crowe, 17, and Tennyson Spencer Crowe, 14, and bought a $10m mansion in Rose Bay, Sydney.\n\nSpeaking to The Australian Women’s Weekly, Spencer revealed she struggled with the fame and spotlight that came from dating the blockbuster Aussie star.\n\n“I found the whole wedding followed by the baby, all in quick succession, and the accompanying attention kind of disconcerting.” she said.\n\n“I just didn’t want any attention on me. I wanted to hide away and be a mother for a couple of years. It was overwhelming.\n\n“I wanted to just fly well and truly under the radar for a while. When Charlie was first born, we had a couple of security issues and I was more or less hotel-bound in Toronto. There was a price on getting a photo of Charlie, which made it very intimidating to even go out for a walk.”\n\nThe Pacific Drive actress continued: “Each time I ventured out, we’d be attacked by a swarm of photographers, which, as a new mother, made my hackles rise and just made life completely claustrophobic.”\n\n“I didn’t like that phrase of our lives at all – I couldn’t get out and be normal. And I like to be out and be normal. I like to sit in a cafe and observe people. I don’t want to be observed.”"
