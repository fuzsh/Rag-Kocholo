        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe Japanese fusion restaurant in Melbourne stuck to its decision to not entertain the couple.\n\nAn Australian restaurant refused service to Hollywood actor Russell Crowe and his girlfriend Britney Theriot during the weekend.\n\nAccording to media reports, the power couple was denied service for not meeting the restaurant's smart-casual dress code.\n\nThe duo went to Mr Miyagi, a Japanese-fusion establishment in Melbourne, which describes itself as 'casual, but fancy'. Guests wearing \"work gear, activewear, singlets, and thongs (flip-flops)\" are forbidden.\n\nThe pair were dressed in sportswear they wore for their tennis session earlier in the day. The New York Post reported that the staff denied them entry.\n\n\"He (Russell) went there wearing a brand new Ralph Lauren polo having just played a game of tennis and was turned away,\" Crowe's manager Grant Vandenberg was quoted as telling the Daily Mail Australia.\n\nAs per the New York Post report, the management stuck to their decision to not entertain the 'A Beautiful Mind' star, saying no one is above their rules.\n\nThe Herald Sun quoted restaurant owner Kristian Klein, \"We treat everyone the same. It doesn't matter who you are or if you are Russell Crowe. We've got a dress code that we push across every level. We are consistent with it and I don't feel like it's unreasonable. But I know personally if I'm in my thongs (flip-flops) and my boardies (shorts), I'm not going to try and go to a nice restaurant, because I wouldn't be dressed appropriately.\"\n\nOn the work front, the Academy Award winner will be next seen in a horror film, 'The Pope's Exorcist'.\n\nInspired by the actual files of Vatican Chief Exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, the story follows Amorth (played by Crowe) as he investigates a young boy's terrifying possession and ends up uncovering a centuries-old conspiracy the Vatican has desperately tried to keep hidden.\n\nDirected by Julius Avery, the movie stars Daniel Zovatto, Alex Essoe and Franco Nero. The screenplay is written by Michael Petroni and Evan Spiliotopoulos, with a screen story by Michael Petroni and R. Dean McCreary & Chester Hastings.\n\nProduced by Doug Belgrad, Michael Patrick Kaczmarek, and Jeff Katz, The 'Pope's Exorcist' is releasing in cinemas on April 7, 2023, in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.\n\n(With inputs from ANI & IANS)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
