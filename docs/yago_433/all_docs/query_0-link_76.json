        "text": "The Oscar-winning Australian actor, 57, and Spencer also have a second son, Tennyson, 15.\n\nThe former couple met in 1989 on the set of the film The Crossing, before getting married in 2003 in a specially built chapel on Crowe's Nana Glen farm near Coffs Harbour.\n\nThey later announced their split in 2012 but didn't finalise their divorce until six years later.\n\nDespite Crowe's estimated wealth of $90 million at the time, Spencer got a settlement of just $18 million and the couple's Sydney house, thanks to a pre-nuptial agreement.\n\nBut the pair remain friends and even take the occasional family holiday together.\n\nCrowe told news.com.au during an interview in 2015 – three years after their split – that Spencer was \"a great mum\". He added that his work travel demands were a contributing factor to their separation.\n\n\"The platform we have set for the boys is one of consistency. It was clear when we were travelling together that it wasn't the healthiest thing for the kids,\" Crowe said at the time.\n\n\"They had to change schools, make new friends all the time, and there was something in that style of life where the grounded shifted under them all the time. That wasn't good for them.\n\nHe added: \"As a parent, you have a connection with your children that is beyond anything else. We always talk in terms of female intuition, but it can be expanded to parental, mother or father.\""
