During a recent romantic trip to Italy, the New Zealand native’s girlfriend of four years, Britney Theriot, was spotted with a ginormous new sparkler on that finger. Now, a source exclusively tells In Touch the 59-year-old has popped the question!\n\n“They’ve been practically inseparable since they started dating,” says the insider of the Gladiator star and the realtor, 32. “They’ve been planning to wed for a while. Russell’s not a man of grand gestures, but he made it official by giving Britney a ring.” The insider adds that the dad of two, who split from Danielle Spencer in 2012, has changed for the better since meeting Britney."
