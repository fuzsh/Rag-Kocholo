        "text": "Russell Crowe has split from his wife of nine years, Danielle Spencer, it has been reported in Sydney.\n\nThe Oscar-winning actor and his musician wife have separated, with Russell throwing himself into work as a result of the devastating marriage break-up it’s claimed.\n\nThe couple have two children together, Charles and Tennyson, aged eight and six.\n\nIt is understood that the decision was amicable with both parents committed to protecting their boys, revealed The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\nIt continues that the children remain with Miss Spencer while her now-estranged husband continues filming the biblical epic Noah in the US.\n\nNews of the split will be a massive shock to showbiz types in Australia as it was believed they had a steady marriage.\n\nThere were rumours rumours surrounding their relationship in June but the couple quickly acted to show unity.\n\nDanielle was pictured on a night out with her Australia’s Dancing With The Stars dance partner, Damian Whitewood, when Russell was away for a long period of time working on a number of film roles.\n\nWhen Russell returned, he embraced his wife at the airport with a rare display of affection by kissing her in front of the cameras. Media reports Down Under suggested it was “damage control” by the couple.\n\nWatch Russell Crowe's incredible speech after winning Best Actor at the Academy Awards in 2001 below.\n\nThe article reports that Russell is using his busy work schedule as a distraction from heartbreak, with a total of SIX movies in the process of filming. Including the Iron Fist, Les Miserables, Broken City, Superman, Noah and his next project The Winter’s Tale, with Colin Farrell and Will Smith.\n\nRussell and Danielle first met 22 years ago on the set of the film, The Crossing, where they began a romance before splitting up when the Gladiator star went overseas to pursue fame.\n\nIn their time apart, Russell had a high publicised love affair with actress Meg Ryan before returning to Australia to rekindle a relationship with Danielle.\n\nThey married in a purpose built chapel at Russell’s farm in April, 2003 after he proposed a year prior.\n\nShe once said of her husband’s fame and fortune that \"all that stuff has nothing to do with me as a person.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the couple are yet to comment."
