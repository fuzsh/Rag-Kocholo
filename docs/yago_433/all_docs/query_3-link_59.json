        "text": "Love set match! Russell Crowe, and Britney Theriot flaunted their romance at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday (January 29). The 57-year-old Oscar winner and his gorgeous, actress-turned-real estate agent girlfriend, 31, were all smiles as they enjoyed the games cuddling up next to each other in the front row. Russell, rocking a navy polo, looked to be in high spirits while chatting with a friend sitting next to the couple. Britney let her natural beauty shine in a casual V-neck sweater as she took in all the exciting sportsmanship of the championship matches.\n\nThe photogenic pair certainly love the game of tennis. Last August, they were spotted packing on the PDA during a private session. The Gladiator alum couldn’t keep his hands off Britney during the friendly match, as they paused throughout it to give each other a smooch. In March, the A-list couple were spotted playing a game of doubles with friends in Sydney, where a few Hollywood heavyweights were sitting in the stands, including Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, Natalie Portman and Jeff Goldblum.\n\nAlthough the couple hasn’t publicly spoken out about their relationship, they have certainly appeared inseparable. It’s believed Russell first met the former actress on the set of his 2013 film Broken City. The encounter came right as he and actress wife Danielle Spencer separated in 2012, after nearly ten years of marriage. Russell and Danielle married on April 7, 2003 and have two sons, Charles 16, and Tennyson, 14. They finalized their divorce in April 2018."
