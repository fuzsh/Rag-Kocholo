        "text": "Crowe found his lovebird.\n\nRussell Crowe looked smitten while making his red carpet debut with his much-younger girlfriend, Britney Theriot, at the premiere of his new movie “Poker Face” in Rome, Italy, on Sunday.\n\nCrowe, 58, and Theriot, 31, walked the red carpet together and stopped to pose for photos with their arms wrapped intimately around each other.\n\nWhile the duo shied away from any serious PDA, the actor was clearly taken by his leading lady and at one point was seen smiling as he stared into her eyes. He also kept his hand sweetly around her waist.\n\nCrowe was dressed in black slacks, a black sports coat and a black T-shirt. By contrast, Theriot wore a colorful statement dress, clearly wanting to stand out. She finished her look with black pumps and wore her hair in beach waves.\n\nWhile this is the first time the duo have officially taken their love public, Theriot, an actress, seems to enjoy her privacy; her Instagram profile is set to private and has just under 2,500 followers.\n\nThe “Gladiator” star and Theriot have kept their relationship private for some time now. They first sparked romance rumors in November 2020 when they were spotted kissing during a heated round of tennis.\n\nAnd in February 2021, they seemed to be going strong as they were seen playing tennis together again in Australia.\n\nCrowe was previously married to Danielle Spencer, with whom he shares two sons: Charles, 18, and Tennyson, 16.\n\nHe and Spencer, also an actress, married in 2003 but separated in 2012.\n\nAmid their divorce, Crowe infamously auctioned off 227 of his personal items with Sotheby’s Australia in 2018.\n\n“Divorce has its way of making you really examine the things that are essential in life — and the things that are not,” Crowe said in a statement at the time. “Through the process I had a look around and realized I had a lot of stuff. Career stuff, stuff I’ve collected, and stuff in general. Boxes and boxes of stuff … so in the spirit of moving forward into fresh air, here’s a portion of that collection of stuff.”\n\nA fan purchased the leather jock strap that Crowe wore in “Cinderella Man” for $5,400.\n\nThey finalized their divorce in 2018, with the Oscar winner excitedly tweeting, “In other news… yesterday, April 9th 2018 at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time (Aus)… I officially became divorced.Thank you linesman. Thank you ball boys.”"
