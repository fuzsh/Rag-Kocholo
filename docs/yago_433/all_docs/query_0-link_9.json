        "text": "Russell Crowe and his ex-wife Danielle Spencer are still on great terms despite their divorce, after a heartwarming photo posted to social media revealed an inspiring co-parenting relationship.\n\nIn the recent Instagram post, Spencer shared a sweet photo of Crowe alongside their children Tennyson, 17, and Charles, 20, at the Trevi Fountain in Rome.\n\n“My lads and their Dad! Love this photo,” the 54-year-old captioned the moving photograph.\n\nThe pair were married for nine years before separating in 2012. They officially divorce six years later.\n\n“I think because Russell was travelling a lot with work, and we wanted to try and keep the family together and the parents in the same place, I just couldn’t (continue my singing and acting career),” Spencer told KISS FM in a recent interview about their marriage.\n\n“I just thought we can’t both be on location and the kids bought up with a nanny.”\n\nBut despite a lengthy divorce, the couple remains best friends and have coordinated a healthy co-parenting agreement.\n\nSpencer said the pair would go on holiday together every year so their children to have time with both parents.\n\nIn another post to social media, Spencer shared a moving tribute to Crowe on his 59th birthday — and what would’ve been their 20th wedding anniversary.\n\n“Twenty years ago today, I married the father of my boys,” she captioned the post, which included another intimate photo of the actor with his two sons.\n\n“While it is no longer our anniversary, it is still that guy’s birthday. Happy Birthday @russellcrowe,” she added.\n\nSpencer is in a long-term relationship with author Adam Long, while Crowe is currently dating American actress Britney Theriot."
