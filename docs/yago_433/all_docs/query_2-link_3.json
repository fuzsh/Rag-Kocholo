        "text": "Russell Crowe loves the country of Italy so much that the actor once said he would “use any excuse” to travel back there.\n\nSo it’s no surprise that Russell has chosen it as a potential backdrop for a wedding to American fiancee Britney Theriot.\n\nWEDDING SPECULATION\n\nRussell, 60, and Britney, 32, were seen in full-on tourist mode in Rome last week, riding through the bustling streets on scooters ahead of his band The Gentlemen Barbers’ gigs in the city.\n\nAn insider reveals the couple were eyeing up a small church to say “I do” as the country holds special meaning for them both.\n\n“Italy was always going to be their wedding destination. Every time they go there, they come back more in love,” the source reveals of the couple, who began dating in 2020.\n\n“It’s their favourite place to visit in the world – they love the food, the people, the romance, the history. It’s always been their dream to get married there.”\n\nAlong with filming various movies there over the years, Russell has come back to Italy time and again for his musical endeavours, as well as holidays there with Charles, 20, and Tennyson, 18, his sons with ex-wife Danielle Spencer.\n\nRumours he had proposed to Britney also began while they were in Italy in February, when she was seen with a huge diamond sparkler.\n\nITALIAN ROOTS\n\nAnd the nuptials will be even more special after Russell’s discovery earlier this year that he has ancestors from Italy, with his great, great, great grandfather on his mother’s side, Luigi Ghezzi, born in the region of Marche in 1829.\n\nThe insider explains, “The difference this time for Russell is that he’s discovered why he loves Italy so much. Indeed, last year when Russell performed a free concert at the steps of the Roman Theatre, he told the crowd Rome was “the city where my heart beats faster”.\n\nThe Gladiator actor also recalled a moment after a festival in Czechia when he and Britney headed to a nightclub and shared a special moment on the dancefloor – one they’ll likely recreate at their wedding.\n\n“So I took her into my arms and we danced,” Russell told People. “Using the type of moves my old man would, spinning her around and bringing her back.\n\nHer eyes were sparkling with the fun of it all.\n\n“It was like a scene from my childhood. Britney used to be a cheerleader for the [New Orleans] Saints, so she’s got rhythm,” he added.\n\n“As the song ended, I spun her back into me and we kissed. The crowd cheered and the world around us flooded back in. It was just a perfect little moment.”\n\nPost-wedding, they’ll spend more time exploring Italy, before they make their way over to the US. While over there, the pair are sure to catch up with Britney’s friends and family to celebrate.\n\n“They head on a ‘road trip’- style honeymoon when Russell tours the US,” the source says, “They’re likely to keep things secret for now, but expect an announcement soon.”"
