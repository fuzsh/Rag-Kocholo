        "text": "There's nothing more exciting than a trailer for a new Russell Crowe film, is there? Your mind starts filling with questions before it even begins. Will it be his wife that he's trying to save this time, or one of his kids? Which accent will he attempt? And which accent will it inadvertently end up sounding like? How many times during the trailer will he scowl?\n\nIn the case of newest Russell Crowe trailer – for The Next Three Days – the answers are 1) his wife, 2a) Californian, 2b) Welsh or something and 3) once, but for a really long time. But what actually happens during The Next Three Days? Let's consult the trailer to find out ...\n\n1) Russell Crowe is a man with the perfect family. His son is the picture of innocence, his beautiful young wife Elizabeth Banks can't hide her contentment and even Russell himself is attempting a smile. It's not an entirely successful smile – he hasn't expressed any form of happiness since the mid-1980s, so he ends up looking more like a mortally concussed ape than anything – but at least the intention is there.\n\n2) Then, disaster strikes. The police raid Russell's house and arrest him for possession of the world's least-convincing Nottingham accent. Just kidding, they actually arrest him for possession of a dangerous musical career.\n\n3) Just kidding. It's actually Elizabeth Banks who they arrest, and for murder. The punishment is clear – a heavy-handed rectal examination. And, once that has finished, jail.\n\n4) But Russell Crowe has a plan. Realising that this is probably the last film he'll ever make in which he's allowed to have a pretty young wife instead of someone more age-appropriate, he decides to break her out of jail.\n\n5) And for that to happen, he needs the winning expertise of one man: Liam Neeson. Drawing on his experience as a member of the A-Team, Neeson tells Crowe to take the prison guards by surprise with a sudden attack using a helicopter made out of van parts and bits of celery. Then, drawing upon his experience as Aslan, he tells Crowe to sacrifice himself on the sacred Stone Table to fulfil the prophecy of Cair Paravel and bring about the end of the perpetual winter that has blighted the talking animals of Narnia for the last 100 years.\n\n6) After concluding that Liam Neeson has gone a bit mad from trying to be in every film that gets made these days, Russell Crowe ignores all of his advice and just buys a gun.\n\n7) The second part of Crowe's plan to break Elizabeth Banks out of prison involves abandoning his own son at a petrol station. Because, to be fair, child actors come and go but you only get a finite number of pretty young screen wives after your 45th birthday."
