        "text": "IT WAS Danielle Spencer's decision to end her nine-year marriage with Russell Crowe.\n\nWhile the singer and musician has refused to comment on their marriage break up, friends told the Herald yesterday the mother of Crowe's two sons was ''handling things well,'' later confirming that ''yes, it was her decision''.\n\nThe separation had been coming for some time.\n\nLast month locals around the northern NSW coast hamlet of Nana Glen thought it was unusual that Crowe was holidaying with sons Charles and Tennyson without Spencer.\n\nCrowe had flown in from the set of his latest film, the big budget biblical epic Noah in the US, to see his NRL team, South Sydney, in the semi-finals and spend time with his sons.\n\nThere was no sign of Spencer when Crowe and his boys touched down at Coffs Harbour, before taking the short drive to Crowe's lush bush idyll, which since 1999 he has transformed into a private sanctuary complete with its own chapel in a village-like setting, along with a working cattle farm.\n\nCrowe also bought the neighbouring pub at Nymboida, where he opened a museum filled with memorabilia from his Hollywood career.\n\nYesterday Spencer briefly emerged from their $10 million family home in Rose Bay and headed to Redfern's designer furniture precinct, ironically just a few metres from the Rabbitohs' training ground where Crowe, who remains in the US shooting Noah, has often been spotted.\n\nWith news crews camped outside and buzzing overhead in helicopters, Spencer was not being drawn on the subject of her marriage collapse.\n\nA similarly deafening silence was also coming from Crowe's camp, his spokesman saying ''it is unlikely he will be making any statement''.\n\nCracks in the couple's relationship emerged back in June after reports and photos were published of Spencer in a nightclub with her Dancing With The Stars partner Damian Whitewood.\n\nNeighbours report that Crowe has spent time alone at his $14 million Woolloomooloo apartment during his recent trips to Sydney, while his wife and children stay in Rose Bay.\n\nSpencer could walk away from the marriage with a settlement conservatively estimated at $25 million.\n\nThe couple reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement before marrying that ''guaranteed'' Spencer a minimum payout of around $15 million if they stayed together for at least three years, along with the marital home.\n\nThere was also reportedly a $3 million trust fund for each child they have together.\n\nBut Spencer's settlement figure could grow considerably given Crowe has earned about $150 million making films in the years since they married and invested in various business ventures.\n\nAlong with his share of the Rabbitohs, which is understood to be excluded from any settlement, he has opened the Riley Street Gym in Darlinghurst and launched the Black Standard Beef label, which now sells to top restaurants in Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nLoading\n\nBut the real money is tied up in a sizeable property portfolio worth up to $50 million, which includes glamorous homes including the Rose Bay property, the only one bought in both Crowe's and Spencer's names, and farmland on the NSW north coast.\n\nAccording to land title and Australian Securities and Investment Commission searches, the remainder of the property portfolio, which includes farmland, bush cottages and apartments in Kensington, is owned in either the Gladiator star's own name or a variety of companies he has set up, with such imaginative names as Fear of God Films, Gruntland and Max Symous & Son Pty Ltd."
