While the shock split has left the entertainment industry baffled, those closest to the pair have opened up exclusively to WHO about their sadness surrounding the break-up. \"I love them both and I'm naturally sad,\" reveals Spencer's father Don. Adds Caroline Grose, Spencer's bridesmaid at her fairytale wedding to Crowe in 2003: \"It's always sad when your friends decide to separate, but they still care very deeply about each other.\" So what went wrong? Crowe's hectic filming schedule may have been to blame, with sources suggesting his wife tired of living her life alone. \"She was in a lonely marriage living separate lives,\" a source tells WHO. \"You can only do that so long.\"\n\nRELATED: Exclusive: Danielle Spencer's Dad Speaks Out About \"Sad\" Split\n\nROB PATTINSON AND KRISTEN STEWART – CAUGHT ON CAMERA!\n\nThey managed to keep a low profile while repairing their relationship, but Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have finally come out of hiding. The Twilight couple were snapped together in Los Angeles, where they \"spent all weekend together,\" says a source. \"They seem attached at the hip again.\" Taking in a late night date, intimate dinner and a fun night out with friends, the cosy weekend was proof that all is well with young Hollywood's favourite duo. \"They looked happy and everything seemed great,\" reveals a witness. \"They were flirty and held hands, but didn't kiss.\"\n\nRELATED: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson Go Public With Romance For The First Time Since Cheating Scandal\n\nDEMI MOORE'S STRUGGLE TO MOVE ON\n\nWhile it's been almost a year since her marriage to Ashton Kutcher came to an unhappy end, Demi Moore is struggling to put it all behind her. Two months after the break-up, Moore was hospitalised and since then has faced intense scrutiny of her physical and mental health, all the while dealing with Kutcher's very public romance with actress Mila Kunis. Now, as her milestone 50th birthday approaches, Moore is working hard to forge a new path, despite the concerns of her friends and daughters. \"They respect Demi, they love her …. But they can only do so much for her,\" says a family friend.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON OPENS UP!\n\nSpeaking exclusively to WHO, a blissfully happy Jennifer Aniston opens up about her \"sneaky\" engagement to actor Justin Theroux. After months of staying coy, the Hollywood star is lifting the lid on her happiness. \"The biggest story right now is that I have a beautiful partner and a lot of joy. Every. Single. Day,\" Aniston reveals in an interview to mark her latest venture as the face and co-owner of Living Proof haircare. The actress also shares the secrets of her coveted style – from those famous tresses to her workout routine, and opens up about perfect weekends spent with Theroux.\n\nPHOTOS: Blinding Bling: Huge Celebrity Engagement Rings!"
