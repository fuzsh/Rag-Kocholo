        "text": "Though he was born in New Zealand, actor Russell Crowe has been adopted by Australia as one of our own.\n\nAs such, many Australians are curious about both his career and his love life. Allow us to enlighten you with everything to know about Russell Crowe’s girlfriend, Britney Theriot.\n\nRussell, 60, has been linked to his current partner Britney, since 2020, and it’s reported that the now-couple met on the set of Broken City in 2013.\n\nThe Daily Mail first reported on Russell and Britney’s relationship in November 2020, however posts on the latter’s social media account suggest she had been living in Australia since January of that year, meaning the pair likely met and started dating even earlier than reported.\n\nSo who exactly is Britney Theriot? She is a former actress who is from New Orleans in the United States. It’s alleged that she’s currently around 32 years of age, making her about 28 years younger than Russell.\n\nAccording to the Gladiator actor, she also used to be a cheerleader for the New Orleans Saints, and also appeared in the film Broken City alongside her now-partner, where they allegedly first met.\n\nAfter her stint in acting, Britney became a real estate agent and she now performs as a back-up singer for Russell when he performs on stage.\n\nThough they tend to keep their relationship relatively private, Russell and Britney have attended multiple public events together.\n\nNot only that, but Britney has also shared some limited insights into their romance via her social media page.\n\nMost recently, the former actress uploaded a selfie of her and Russell celebrating his milestone 60th birthday.\n\n“Happy 60 years of life to the most legendary legend of all time. ❤️,” Britney shared.\n\nThe 32-year-old has also adopted some of her partner’s favourite Aussie hobbies, including a love of the native wildlife, and of course support for the South Sydney Rabbitohs NRL team.\n\nAs aforementioned, the couple have only attended public events together a handful of times, but many of them have been extremely high-profile. One of these events includes the Australian Open tennis tournament, where Russell and Britney sat courtside in both 2022 2023.\n\nThe pair also made their red carpet debut as a couple in October 2022, at the premiere of Russell’s film, Poker Face.\n\nIt has also been rumoured that the couple may have taken the next step in their relationship! Photos on Britney’s Instagram page indicate that they may be engaged, as she can be seen wearing a sparkler on her left ring finger.\n\nSince their relationship began, Britney has continued to spend time with Russell’s two sons, Charles and Tennyson.\n\nRussell uploaded a selfie of them together along with some friends to X in July 2022, where everyone is smiling and seems to be enjoying themselves on their vacation to Italy.\n\n“Taking the kids to see the old office”, Russell captioned the photo, as they were in Rome where he famously filmed Gladiator.\n\nHe shares his two children with ex-wife Danielle Spencer, an Australian actress and singer."
