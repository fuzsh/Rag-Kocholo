        "text": "Middle-aged Australian actor, Russell Crowe, seems to be having just about as much success in his personal life as he is getting his major motion picture comeback off the ground. According to the latest gossip news updates, the Water Diviner recently asked his ex-wife, Danielle Spencer, to re-marry him via a nude Instagram engagement proposal, just weeks after finally giving up his pursuit of Elizabeth Hurley. Even worse Crowe's relationship bad luck is said to have rubbed off on Nicole Kidman. Word has it that Russell got his old friend in trouble with husband, Keith Urban, and now the angry Aussies are considering divorce over trying to salvage their struggling marriage.\n\nIt seems that Russell Crowe is every bit the life-on-the-edge risk-taker that her plays in his movies, when it comes to love.\n\nAccording to the Globe's sources, Crowe finally tired of trying to convince Hugh Grant's ex, Elizabeth Hurley, that he was worth dating to little avail, and decided instead to refocus his attention on a woman that was once able to see him as sexual being -- his ex-wife Danielle Spencer (via CelebDirtyLaundry):\n\n\"Just weeks ago he was chasing after Elizabeth Hurley.\n\n\"Now the changeable Russell Crowe is begging his ex, Danielle Spencer to take him back and get married again!\"\n\nAfter a few weeks or reportedly getting shut down right and left by Hurley, the informant reports that Russell seemed to be looking for affirmation that he was still sexual attractive in addition to his wedding proposal:\n\n\"Russell sent Dani a naked photo with the message, 'will you marry me'?\"\n\nBeing that Danielle and Russell have yet to announce any sort of wedding plans, once source claiming to be in the know, reveals in the June 15, issue of the National Enquirer that Keith Urban, has grown more than just a little uneasy with how close Crowe and his wife, Nicole Kidman, have grown:\n\n\"Keith caught Nicole spilling [about the sad state or their marriage] to Russell on the phone, and he's furious.\n\n\"Russell's been a friend of the family since day one, but now he's single, and Keith's very uncomfortable with their close bond.\"\n\nWhether or not Keith and Nicole's marriage makes it or not, there isn't too much to be worried about from Russell Crowe -- if his charm doesn't scare the ladies off right away, his naked selfie game will.\n\nÂ© 2024 Classicalite All rights reserved.
