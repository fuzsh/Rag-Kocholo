        "text": "By Nottage and Ward on October 26, 2012\n\nActor Russell Crowe and his wife, Australian singer Danielle Spencer, have separated after nine years of marriage, according to The Huffington Post. The couple, who had first met 22 years ago on the set of The Crossing, had married in April 2003 in South Wales and have two sons, Tennyson and Charles.\n\nCrowe’s busy work schedule, which has kept him away from his family for the better part of this year, is reportedly one of the reasons for the couple’s split. He has six movies coming out in the next 12 months, including the biblical epic Noah, which he is currently working on. The split is reportedly amicable and the pair remain focused on raising their two sons, who live with their mother in Sydney.\n\nWork is often the cause of discord between high-profile couples; other times, it may be the constant publicity and seeming lack of privacy. Whatever the reason, however, high profile couples go through the same, if not additional, stress as normal couples when their relationship starts to fall apart, and like normal couples, they deserve dedicated and effective legal representation to help get them through it.\n\nIf you are planning on getting divorced as a high profile couple in Illinois, the Chicago high profile divorce lawyers at Nottage and Ward can provide you with the discreet representation you need to get through such a difficult time more privately. Call us today at (312) 332-2915 to learn more about our services and how we can help."
