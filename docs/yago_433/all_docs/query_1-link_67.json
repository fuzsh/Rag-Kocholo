        "text": "Michael Caine is 91. He was born in 1933, which was before the invention of sun cream, the photocopier, the nuclear bomb, the microwave, tupperware, velcro, the Frisbee and the car seatbelt. And yet, he seems to have fallen in love with an invention less than 20 years old. Michael Caine loves Twitter, or X, as we now call it. He posts, not every day, but many times a month, and often multiple times in 24 hours – and has done, with a few months-long breaks, since September 2010.\n\nIt’s clearly him who’s posting. There’s the odd dispatch promoting his work – he’s retired from acting these days, and seems to be writing thrillers instead – which is grammatically correct and likely composed by his team. But the vast majority have a different style: very terse, and often with line breaks, giving them a kind of geezery Rupi Kaur effect. “What are your favourite music,” he tweeted on 9 June 2011. “Will stay up all night to see [line break] Super Bowl,” he tweeted on 11 February this year. On May 11: “Use The Difficulty [line break] You can.” A trio on 6 November last year: “Hello all of you.”; “Love”; “Chelsea”.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnd like Kaur, he loves a bit of schmaltz: “Good Night My Sweet Ones” (23 April 2022); “It’s all about Love” (27 November 2023); “Will never give up on you” (5 January); “What’s it all about [line break] Peace” (31 January)”. On 27 September 2011: “You are a child of the Universe like the trees, you have a right to be here”. Compile these into a coffee table book, and market it to old buffers who like to buy old World War Two films on DVD, and you could make a tidy sum.\n\nAnother tweet of his, from Wednesday lunchtime, reads simply: “Calm down”. It went viral – or more viral than usual – because it was almost certainly aimed at the far-right rioters who have been terrorising Britain’s cities. Many of those rioters are probably the type to deeply appreciate Caine’s films. For him to seemingly slap them down, and with words you can easily imagine him issuing in a gravelly Cockney bark, was deeply satisfying.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nReading through Sir Michael Caine’s tweets is an unexpectedly tender experience. Unlike with so many celebrity social media accounts, we get a genuine sense of the man. He really, really loves wishing people a happy weekend (“Have a Great weekend.”; “Have a great weekend everyone.”; “Follow your dream! Be brave! Have a great weekend”). He loves Thanksgiving, and has said on multiple occasions that Britain should have its own version of the holiday. He tweets Italian Job–inspired summaries of his birthday (“blew the bloody candles out”).\n\nHe also posts vintage photos – sometimes with the caption in a follow-up tweet – of him with fellow actors like Roger Moore and Sean Connery, or with his wife Shakira. Many, judging by the icons in the corner, are photos he’s googled and screenshotted on his phone. And on May 15, something was clearly pulling on his heartstrings, because he tweeted, in sequence: “Lets take care of kids in UK”; “Too many kids in UK are living in poverty.”; “Want to raise money for UK kids living in poverty. [line break] Perhaps text by phone. [line break] How do we start.”\n\nIt all conjures an image of a slightly sentimental man sitting in some well-furnished room in the countryside, reliving his glory days and wishing all well. Well, apart from those who need to calm down. Caine is one of this country’s greatest film stars. But through social media, of all things, he became human again."
