        "text": "More than 20 years after the couple met playing lovers in the 1990 movie The Crossing, Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer may not have their Hollywood happy ending after all.\n\nMarried in April 2003, the New Zealand-born Oscar winner, 48, and his Aussie musician wife, 43, are reportedly no longer together, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Crowe's rep has not responded to WHO's request for comment.\n\nThe couple's apparent split comes after rumors of a rocky romance swirled over the summer.\n\nIn June, Spencer was photographed out at a Sydney casino lounge with Damian Whitewood, her pro dance partner on season 12 of Australia's Dancing with the Stars. Photos in Australian media showed the two with their arms around each other.\n\nHowever, days after the cosy pictures of Spencer and Whitewood surfaced, a photo of Crowe affectionally greeting Spencer at the Los Angeles International Airport seemed to hush the buzz.\n\nPHOTOS: Celeb Couples: From Denial To Breakup\n\nSpencer is currently in Sydney with their children – sons Charles, 8½, and Tennyson, 6 – while Crowe stays in N.Y.C., where he took the stage at the Gramercy Theatre Saturday night with Alan Doyle, Sting and Les Misérables costar Samantha Barks.\n\nCrowe, who was famously linked to Meg Ryan during his less-tame days on the set of the 2000 romantic drama Proof of Life, is also filming Noah, a biblical epic costarring Emma Watson.\n\nPHOTOS: Quicky Celebrity Divorces\n\nRELATED: Danielle Spencer: Russell Told Me To \"Get In There And Do My Best\" On Dancing"
