I started thinking recently, `If I believe it is important to baptize my kids, why not me?\"'\n\nCrowe says the baptism will take place in the Byzantine chapel he built at his country ranch in Australia for his wedding to Danielle Spencer in 2003. The couple have two sons, 3-year-old Charlie and 1-year-old Tennyson.\n\n\"It is consecrated and everything,\" Crowe says in the magazine's December issue, now on newsstands. \"Charlie was baptized there. And when Tennyson gets baptized there, I will, too.\"\n\nCrowe � a reformed Aussie bad boy with a reputation for throwing temper tantrums � is more spiritual than people may think.\n\n\"I do believe there are more important things than what is in the mind of a man,\" he says. \"There is something much bigger that drives us all. I'm willing to take that leap of faith.\"\n\nCrowe, who won an Academy Award in 2001 for \"Gladiator,\" co-stars with Denzel Washington in \"American Gangster,\" a Universal Pictures release, which is now in theaters. His screen credits also include \"A Beautiful Mind\" and \"The Insider.\"\n\nMember\n\nJoined:\n\nPosts: 6,186\n\nI do not know the answer to your primary question but I was especially delighted to read this.\n\n\"I do believe there are more important things than what is in the mind of a man,\" he says. \"There is something much bigger that drives us all. I'm willing to take that leap of faith.\"\n\nIt is very troubling to be confronted by college students who essentially believe that there is nothing bigger than themselves. It's even more troubling to note that in most of my classes I have Muslim students who happily proclaim that not only do they have a remedy for Western Society's spiritual degradation but in a few years they will give it.\n\nCDL"
