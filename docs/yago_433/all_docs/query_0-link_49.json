        "text": "The auction on Saturday at Sotheby’s Australia in Sydney carried a provocative title: “The Art of Divorce.”\n\nThe catalog is pulled from the long film career and the personal possessions of the Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe.\n\nThe sale took place on the actor’s 54th birthday and the anniversary of his wedding to the singer Danielle Spencer in 2003.\n\nMr. Crowe split from Ms. Spencer in 2012, and they finalized their divorce last year."
