Looks like Russell Crowe’s bad-boy bachelor days are nearly over. The volatile Oscar winner is planning to marry Australian pop singer Danielle Spencer, whom he first met 12 years ago on the set of the film ”The Crossing,” according to the Associated Press. The wedding will take place in ”mid-to-late 2003,” USA Today reported.

Crowe received permission from Spencer’s father before proposing to her in a Sydney restaurant. The star recently canceled a tour by his band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts, citing a ”massive level of stress” and a desire to spend more time with Spencer. Both Crowe and Spencer will be getting married for the first time.
