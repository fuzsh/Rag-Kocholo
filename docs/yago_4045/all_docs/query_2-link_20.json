        "text": "Colin Andrew Mochrie was on born November 30, 1957, in Kilmarnock, Scotland. His father, an airline maintenance executive, moved the family to Montreal, Canada, in 1964, and finally to Vancouver in 1969. When asked about his childhood, Mochrie said he tended to be a bit of a loner because of moving around so much, but other than that he was a pretty typical kid: \"I fought with my younger brother, was protective of my younger sister and didn't get my parents.\" After he dropped out of school in B.C., he did theater sports and there met Ryan Stiles, with whom he has remained friends for more than 20 years. In 1989, Mochrie married comedian Debra McGrath; they have one daughter, Kinley Mochrie. He worked at Second City in Toronto before joining the British comedy improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1988) (and he also stars in the American version, Whose Line Is It Anyway? (1998)). Mochrie and his family once resided in Los Angeles but moved back to Canada. He had a recurring role on Die Drew Carey Show (1995) as Eugene Anderson. He won the Canadian Comedy award as Male Improvisational Comic. In addition to his TV work, Mochrie has been busy on the stage, which is where he began his career, the early part of which he spent touring with the National Touring Company, and has starred in such popular stage productions as \"She Stoops to Conquer\" and \"The Brady Bunch.\" He also writes as well as stars in the Canadian comedy series Supertown Challenge (1998), as well as the sitcom Blackfly (2001). He has also appeared in such films as John Woo's Killer Target (1991), Love (And Other Disasters) (2006), Die Campbells (1986), Echt blond (1997), and Im Zeichen der Jungfrau (1989)."
