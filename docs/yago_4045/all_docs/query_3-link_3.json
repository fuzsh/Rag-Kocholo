I had an immediate rapport with Ryan, we worked for years in Vancouver before Whose Line … And I’ve been touring with (fellow Whose Line alum) Brad Sherwood now for 14 years, so we’re pretty much in the groove. With Deb, I wouldn’t recommend having to marry every improv partner you work with, but it does help!”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe pair bring their improv stylings to Centrepointe Theatre on Monday.\n\nMochrie says while his acting career has taken him down many strange roads (he’s known, for instance, for playing a cameo role in just about every Canadian show to hit the air in the past 20 years), improv always draws him back.\n\n“The first thing is, I’m really lazy, so it beats having to learn new things. And I love the challenge of it, going out in front of an audience with absolutely nothing, and using only what they give you and your partner, and coming up with a show.\n\n“Before going out on stage, it’s like, ‘OK, we have people who expect a show, and we don’t have one right now.’ So it’s pretty much the closest I’ll ever get to skydiving, or putting my life in danger.”\n\nAnd while many performers speak of the immediacy of that rapport with an audience, perhaps nowhere is that interplay more evident than with improv.\n\n“(The audience) will really set the tone for the evening, so it’s our job to make sure they’re up to the task. And there’s a line we have to tread — people always yell out ‘gynecologist’ or ‘proctologist,’ and yet if we did a scene about them, it would quickly turn on you.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“So we’re trying to get them to play to the top of their intelligence, because it really helps if we get suggestions that really challenge us, or things we’ve never heard before.”\n\n(For the record, Mochrie’s favourite routine on the hit show was the “greatest hits” sketch: “It gave me a chance to sit down, which I always love, and then banter with Ryan and hand it over top these great musical improvisers, and watch them do their magic. So I got to be a participant and a spectator.” His least favourite: anything involving his own singing.)\n\nWith so much reliance on the audience, there have, naturally, been some nights where things didn’t quite go according to plan.\n\nMochrie and Sherwood recently returned from a jaunt through the U.S., and though the show isn’t overtly political, and the schedule stuck mostly to “blue states,” there was one telling encounter at a recent gig in Indiana.\n\n“We were doing a meet-and-greet before the show, and everyone came up and said, ‘Please God, we need to laugh.’ And then we had someone up on stage wearing a Trump hat, and there was a bit of a ‘Make America Great’ chant in the audience, which was really creepy.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“We never do any political thing, but I remember when George W. Bush was in power, Brad one night made a Bush joke and you could immediately sense that the room was split in half. America has a great tradition of making fun of their presidents, but that all kind of stopped with Bush. I guess Republicans just don’t have a sense of humour.”\n\nMochrie is undecided on the notion that no matter what the Trump presidency brings, it will be a boon for comedy.\n\n“Sure, there will be a lot of comedy material, but you know what? I think I’d rather have my real life be safe as opposed to having a chance to make a lot of fun Trump jokes. It doesn’t look that good for the next four years, and I hope we’ll be happily surprised, but I honestly can’t even imagine how that would work out.”\n\nMochrie expects a more familiar crowd once his show hits Ottawa.\n\n“We’ve always had incredible luck with Ottawa audiences. We’ve always found them willing to go with us. Our show is just kind of goofy fun, and that’s universal, no matter your political affiliation or race or creed. You just like to laugh, so most of our energy goes into getting the audience relaxed enough to go on this journey with us and laugh at us.”\n\nColin Mochrie and Debra McGrath\n\nWhere: Centrepointe Theatres (101 Centrepointe Dr.)\n\nWhen: Monday, Dec. 5, 8 p.m.\n\nTickets: $45 at centrepointetheatres.com, at the Centrepointe box office or by calling 613-580-2700\n\nahelmer@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter.com/helmera\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
