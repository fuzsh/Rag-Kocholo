        "text": "Habitat for Humanity Northumberland (HFHN) hopes an upcoming Cobourg event that brings residents to the Sunday dinner table will prove to be fruitful for local housing projects.\n\nHFHN is hosting on Sunday, April 7 its popular Sunday Dinner at the ReStore, located at 764 Division St.\n\nThrough ticket sales from Northumberland County residents and the event’s sponsors, a silent auction, an online raffle and a 50-50 draw, the organization aims to raise $30,000 to support local housing initiatives in Cobourg and Baltimore.\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nTweet this quote\n\nMelissa Morrison, HFHN’s community and fund development co-ordinator, and Cathy Borowec, HFHN’s CEO, shared their thoughts and aspirations for the event with kawarthaNOW.\n\nMorrison said the event was the brainchild of the organization’s former CEO, and HFHN hosted its first Sunday dinner event in 2019.\n\n“We needed to raise money, but we wanted to do something different,” said Morrison. “The Sunday ReStore dinner is all about slowing down. It’s a time to share and connect with our amazing community through a delicious meal in a warm and inviting atmosphere.”\n\n“We often take for granted that a Sunday dinner in a home is a universal experience, but rather it is a privilege that not everyone can enjoy. And with the help of our community, we want to help to create the opportunity for experiences like this for more people in our community through our programming.”\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nThe event is being is catered by Prep Food Co. and features a three-course meal, including cocktails and wine. HFHN said the dinner is a unique and important event.\n\n“Unlike other fundraisers, it’s not a gala. In fact, we go to great lengths to make participants feel as comfortable as possible in our space,” said Borowec and Morrison in collaboration.\n\n“At the heart, we want to bring community members together to enjoy a meal. It is a come-as-you-are event, where we can celebrate the successes of HFHN and our current projects.”\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nTweet this quote\n\nWhile the tickets sold out on February 14 — the first day they went on sale — HFHN will be launching an online raffle and 50-50 draw at the beginning of March. One raffle prize is a one-room makeover provided by Breed Design. More prizes will be announced in the coming weeks, HFHN noted.\n\n“This year we hope to raise $30,000,” Morrison said. “All proceeds will go towards our current build projects, which include a seven-unit net zero build in Baltimore, and a single-family dwelling in Cobourg.”\n\nVisit the HFHN website at www.habitatnorthumberland.ca to learn more about the Sunday dinner fundraiser and related activities. To be placed on a wait list for the sold-out dinner, email mmorrison@habitatnorthumberland.ca.\n\nThe Workforce Development Board (WDB) has just released its 2023-24 Local Labour Market Planning Report, which provides an in-depth look at regional labour market challenges and opportunities from a demand and supply perspective in the city and county of Peterborough, Kawartha Lakes, Northumberland and Haliburton.\n\nAn Employment Ontario project funded in part by the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario, the 96-page report was written by WDB Labour Market Analyst Consultant Sandra Wright. At her disposal was input provided by 66 stakeholders in WDB’s catchment area, with information and feedback gathered through a series of consultations, surveys, and focus groups.\n\nThe 2023-24 Local Labour Market Planning Report is available to view and download at www.wdb.ca/local-labour-market-planning-report/.\n\nIn her report-opening executive summary, WDB’s Chief Executive Officer Jennifer Lamantia provides an overview of some of the report’s key findings:\n\nWith many currently in the workforce expected to retire over the next five to 10 years, many employers are focusing their efforts on the retention of current employees as well as ramping up recruitment.\n\nWith Canada planning to welcome 485,000 new permanent residents in 2024 and 500,000 more in both 2025 and 2026, many employers are looking at hiring a more diversified workforce as a labour shortage mitigation strategy.\n\nWhile the labour shortage due to an aging population is creating a significant workforce challenge, it’s also creating an opportunity for employers to explore new initiatives around workplace culture, new technology adoption, and increased employee diversity.\n\nIn addition, the report notes that sectors reporting labour shortages include health care, construction, education, tourism and hospitality, and retail.\n\nOn the flip side, the list of specific in-demand occupations is long, including nurses, personal support workers, early childhood educators, electricians, millwrights, carpenters, labourers, truck drivers, salespersons, school educators and custodians, cooks and kitchen staff, and administrative and support workers.\n\nAs well as an aging and retiring workforce, there are other challenges affecting access to the labour pool, including available and reliable transportation services, adequate childcare services, and affordable available housing. From a job-seeker perspective, mental health challenges, combined with limited financial means, present a challenge in securing gainful employment.\n\nAs employers look for workers who have skills in areas such as computer literacy, interpersonal communications, and customer service, and who are reliable with a strong work ethic, many have taken measures such as increasing wages, offering more flexible working hours, and implementing hybrid workplaces.\n\nEven so, that hasn’t been enough for some to overcome the labour shortage challenge, with the result being a reduction in operation hours and services offered, and in some cases, outright closure.\n\nTweet this quote\n\nAmong the employment service providers and business attraction and retention organizations involved in the consultation process for the report — and anxious to make good use of its myriad of statistics and related findings to the benefit of their respective clients — are Muskoka-Kawarthas Employment Services, a division of Fleming College, and City of Kawartha Lakes Economic Development.\n\nBoth Rebecca Mustard, economic development manager at the City of Kawartha Lakes, and Sarah Haase, director of workforce development for Muskoka-Kawarthas Employment Services, are on the same page when it comes to the 2023-24 Local Labour Market Planning Report. Each says there’s no such thing as too much information when it comes to having an up-to-date and accurate fact-based overview of regional labour market realities, needs, and challenges at their fingertips.\n\n“It pulls from a number of different data sources and aggregates it all into one place to tell a story,” assesses Mustard, adding “It’s a great tool for us.”\n\n“When we’re doing our planning and working with the business community, this report is very helpful for us to be able to see trends — particularly what’s changing over time when we’re looking at businesses, when we’re looking at jobs, and when we’re looking at demographics. It helps us understand the dynamics of what’s going on in the community, giving us specific information for questions to ask.”\n\nTweet this quote\n\nHaase couldn’t agree more.\n\n“The ability to draw into various communities is incredibly useful,” she says. “Muskoka needs this kind of information, as does Haliburton, Northumberland, and Peterborough.”\n\n“Having the different regions incorporated is very useful when we’re looking at localized solutions for jobs seekers and employers. It really helps us drill down. We have so many different pots of information we can access through Statistics Canada and other areas. What this report does is bring it all together in one spot.”\n\nHaase points to the report’s detailed migration information as an example of the report’s practical use for her agency.\n\n“We very often hear big scope stories in the news about influxes or outgoings in our community, but getting into this really detailed information allows us to make detailed decisions,” she says.\n\n“I’m always keen to see where our shifts in industry have happened. When we’re looking at where we see activity in our industries for job seekers, and where we see employers needing support through employment services, being able to have an industry-by-industry look — and what that can mean as we try to help clients make decisions about training they might want to do or educational steps they’re taking — is invaluable.”\n\nTweet this quote\n\nMustard adds the report helps set priorities for City of Kawartha Lakes Economic Development, answering key questions in the process.\n\n“Where do we need to be putting our time and effort? What’s an industry that might need some stabilization support from a local perspective? How do we then layer that in with what’s going on in the labour force?”\n\nThe report, adds Mustard, is even more essential post-pandemic.\n\n“We’ve all heard a lot of stories that are very true for individual people. This gives us a factual, studied base to weigh those stories and figure out how much of what we are hearing or witnessing is true across the entire population, or whether we are seeing certain experiences in different pockets that aren’t reflected everywhere. It’s helping us make better decisions based on the evidence in the report.”\n\nWhile praising the assistance provided by WDB’s Labour Market Information (LMI) Help Desk, Mustard says the report “brings information to us without us having to go and ask for it all the time. You might be choosing a section of this information when you ask the help desk, but this report gives a broad overview. We’re getting a very holistic view of what’s going on in the labour force.”\n\nTweet this quote\n\nFor her part, Haase notes the report is “one of the few sources in the community that everybody can access” and says employers should take advantage of the up-to-date information and numbers that speak directly to their respective industries.\n\n“It’s one thing to look at data on a spreadsheet, but it’s another thing to know what do we do with that data. An employer can read this report and ask ‘What does my industry look like? Where do I see growth? Where do I see possibilities? If I have a challenge with recruitment, is it because of some of these things that are happening?’ The report gives context and setting along with the data, which is really helpful.”\n\nThe bottom line, according to Haase and Mustard? As a resource to help employment service providers and business attraction and retention organizations do their work effectively, nothing tops having up-to-date date and insights close at hand.\n\n“Part of its usefulness is the fact that it’s there and available,” Haase points out.\n\nFor those who want an overview of the report, WDB will be hosting a half-hour presentation on Zoom at 11 a.m. on Wednesday (February 21), when WDB Labour Market Analyst Consultant Sandra Wright will provide an overview of key changes in local workforce characteristics, including population, employment, unemployment, participation rates, migration and immigration, and education attainment. The session is free, but advance registration is required at eventbrite.ca/e/810369616337.\n\nWDB is also encouraging people to provide feedback about the report by completing a brief online survey at surveymonkey.com/r/2023LLMPFeedback.\n\nFounded in 1996, WDB is a not-for-profit organization located in Peterborough and serving Northumberland, Peterborough, Kawartha Lakes, and Haliburton. WDB is funded by the Ontario Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development to provide labour market information, coordinate employment and training services, and engage employer communities.

Beginning at $35, each menu includes an appetizer, dinner entrée, and dessert, with select locations including a beverage as well.\n\nFrom homemade soups and stews to spread the warmth in the final weeks of winter to comforting authentic cuisine and chocolatey treats to satisfy post-dinner sweet tooths, each restaurant offers an experience that is entirely unique.\n\nTweet this quote\n\n“With the prix fixe menus, we’re taking foodies on a culinary adventure where a restaurant here can double down on what they do best,” says DBIA Vibrancy Manager Hillary Flood. “They are showing off their creative flair on what makes their restaurant special.”\n\nBetween the 10 participating restaurants, there is ample opportunity to explore different styles of cuisine and dine-in atmospheres from casual pubs to fine dining.\n\nSeveral of the eateries offer various price points, with options provided for each course. Paired with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free selections, Brrr-O-Licious gives foodies the opportunity to, as Flood describes it, “create your own adventure.”\n\n“We have seen a real explosion as far as diversity of our restaurant offerings goes and Brrr-O-Licious gives us the opportunity to showcase that diversity,” adds Rees. “Some of them have been really creative with what they’ve done by providing multiple options for each of the price points. There really is something for everyone.”\n\nTweet this quote\n\nBrrr-O-Licious takes inspiration from the playbooks of the popular Winterlicious Toronto and Kingstonlicious programs. Brrr-O-Licious, however, is unique for its wide selection of offerings available within a mid-sized city.\n\n“Our downtown is very much a culinary destination — within a few city blocks, you can taste the world,” Flood points out. “Most mid-sized city downtown districts are composed of antique and retail shops and just the odd restaurant, but we have over 100 restaurant experiences available. Where in most downtowns, shops close at five, that’s when our downtown is just getting started.”\n\nFlood adds that Brrr-O-Licious, with its prix fixe menus, is a way to support locally owned businesses during difficult economic times for everyone.\n\n“We’re no longer dealing with the pandemic but we are just getting started on recovery,” she says, citing high rates of inflation, the cost of goods, and labour shortages as some of the many factors affecting restaurant success.\n\n“Consumer behaviour when it comes to dining out is based on the economy, and right now diners are a little bit more timid with their spending. We’re trying to elevate what’s already available here 24/7, 365 days per year, and demonstrate that robust experience.”\n\nTweet this quote\n\nAnother consumer trend is the increase of take-out and delivery services instead of sitting down to dine in a restaurant. Offering Brrr-O-Licious strictly as a dine-in experience works encourages consumers to not only enjoy diverse cuisine but connect with the people behind it.\n\n“The best way to experience downtown is by foot with the sights, the sounds, and the people that make it so fantastic,” says Flood. “With independently owned restaurants, you get to meet the person behind the brand. There’s an access you don’t necessarily receive from a chain restaurant or ordering through third-party delivery. It’s important to build those human connections.”\n\nOver the 17 days of Brrr-O-Licious, diners can also experience other local happenings such as the First Friday Art Crawl, St. Patrick’s Day celebrations, and March Break events and activities including Trent University’s open house for prospective students.\n\n“There are all kinds of opportunity to welcome people who are here and get them downtown to eat and enjoy so many community events,” says Rees. “As much as we’re an outdoor recreation community, some of those options aren’t available this year, so a better thing to do is come, eat, and enjoy what we have.”\n\nTweet this quote\n\nAs community events invariably bring out-of-town visitors to the downtown as well as locals, Brrr-O-Licious is an opportunity to introduce them to Peterborough’s vibrant culinary scene.\n\n“One of the only things we know for sure is visitors are going to eat and drink while they’re here,” Rees says. “We want to show the best and brightest we have to offer. What better way to get to know the community than to check out the food scene and try something new?”\n\nFor more information on Brrr-O-Licious and to browse the menus of participating restaurants, visit thekawarthas.ca/brrr-o-licious/, where you’ll also find several local accommodation options for visitors wanting to turn their culinary experience into an overnight stay.\n\nBrrr-O-Licious Participating Restaurants\n\nView a larger version of the map\n\nAgave by Imperial\n\nFrom the cousins behind The Imperial Tandoor on Lansdowne, Agave by Imperial serves up authentic Mexican cuisine that fuses traditional recipes with modern techniques. When dining in during Brrr-O-Licious, diners can get a chicken or mushroom flautas (crispy taquitos) served with homemade guacamole as a starter, a slow-cooked short rib with traditional house-made mole and Mexican rice, or a grilled portobello mushroom for a main, and a spiced chocolate mousse with tequila whipped cream for dessert. The special is available at $50 per person.\n\nDirty Burger\n\nAt the family-owned Dirty Burger, Chef Om Patel uses his Indian and Ugandan heritage to craft a one-of-a-kind smash burger paired with craft beer and signature cocktails. The $50 Brrr-O-Licious special comes with a choice of any beer on tap, Vineland Estate Cab Franc, or Pinot Grigio.

For more information, visit the Great Backyard Bird Count website at birdcount.org.\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nTweet this quote\n\n“Participating in the Great Backyard Bird Count is an easy and great opportunity to bird with your friends and neighbours,” says Brooke Bateman, senior director of climate and community science at the National Audubon Society, in a media release.\n\n“Birding with others is a great way to share in the love of birds and learn new skills. Nothing matches the spark of joy in a new birder’s face when they identify their first bird. We invite everyone from all across the globe to make this a tradition with friends and family.”\n\nCombined with other bird counts, results from the Great Backyard Bird Count help create a clearer picture of how birds are faring, including whether individual species are are declining, increasing, or holding steady in the face of habitat loss, climate change, and other threats. Knowing where birds are seen — and not seen —is more important than ever during this El Niño year, and as weather fluctuations caused by climate change influence bird movements.\n\nParticipation in the Great Backyard Bird Count continues to grow every year, with an estimated half a million people from over 200 countries participating last year and submitting checklists reporting more than 7,500 bird species.\n\n“The Great Backyard Bird Count gets bigger every year and that’s such a positive thing,” says David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Engagement in Science and Nature at the Cornell Lab. “We would not be able to track the long-term changes in bird populations without the eyes and ears of all our enthusiastic participants. The world is changing fast, and birds often reflect the impact of environmental change first.”\n\nAs well as helping researchers track bird populations, participating in the Great Backyard Bird Count is a fun outdoor activity for the Family Day long weekend — and it’s good for you.\n\n“It’s well established that time spent in nature is good for us,” Bonter says.\n\nAdvertisement - content continues below\n\nTweet this quote\n\nBirds have been in the news a lot during the past year, with unusual sightings including flamingos in Wyoming and first-ever sightings of a red-flanked bluetail in New Jersey, a cattle tyrant in Texas, and more. Ornithologists speculate these birds may have been blown off course by increasingly fierce storms. With the El Niño phenomenon already influencing weather this year, unusual sightings may continue.\n\n“Strong El Niño conditions this year could bring surprises to the 2024 Great Backyard Bird Count,” says Birds Canada president and CEO Patrick Nadeau. “Temperatures are likely to be warmer which could have an effect on the timing of spring migration and influence food availability. There may be more sightings of unusual visitors wherever you’re looking for birds.”\n\nTo learn how to participate in the Great Backyard Bird Count, visit the Great Backyard Bird Count website at birdcount.org. The website also has tools and information to help both birdwatching newbies and veterans participate in the count. New this year is a map for marking local bird-counting community events, where birders can join up to help celebrate birds in their hometown.\n\nWhile you can simply count the birds you see in your own backyard or in a nearby park, you could also count the birds you see while hiking, cross-country skiing, or snowshoeing (depending on conditions) at one of the conservation areas, wildlife areas, provincial parks, or trails open during the winter in the Kawarthas region.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\nBirdsall Wildlife Area (1300 Birdsall Line, Otonabee-South Monaghan)\n\nDarling Wildlife Area (310 5 Line, Otonabee-South Monaghan)\n\nFleetwood Creek Natural Area (902 Ballyduff Rd., Pontypool)\n\nGanaraska Forest (10585 Cold Springs Camp Rd, Campbellcroft)\n\nGannon’s Narrows Conservation Area (1762 Blackpool Rd., Selwyn)\n\nHarold Town Conservation Area (2611 Old Norwood Rd., Otonabee-South Monaghan)\n\nJackson Creek Trail (610 Parkhill Rd.
