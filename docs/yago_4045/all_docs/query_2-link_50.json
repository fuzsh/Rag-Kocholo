        "text": "Colin Mochrie is an alumnus of Toronto’s famous Second City comedy troupe and is widely considered to be one of the leading improvisers in the world. In 2013, Colin Mochrie was named Canadian Comedy Person of the Year at the Canadian Comedy Awards.\n\nAfter nine years as a regular on the British improvisation series Whose Line is it Anyway?, he became a regular on the American version hosted by Drew Carey, which ran for six years on ABC and three years on ABC Family. In 2011, the entire cast was reunited in Vegas for Drew Carey’s Improv‐aganza, a new series which aired for one season on GSN. A new hit version of Whose Line is it Anyway?,featuring Colin, Wayne, Ryan, and new host Aisha Tyler, is currently airing on the CW Network. Launched in July of 2013 with 12 episodes, it has subsequently been renewed for a second season with an order of 24 more shows to air in 2014.\n\nColin appears regularly in film and television and was notably a cast member of CBC’s classic news spoof This Hour Has 22 Minutes for two seasons. With his wife, Debra McGrath, he produced, wrote and starred in the CBC show Getting Along Famously.\n\nA native of Scotland but life‐long resident of Canada, Colin has remarkably toured worldwide for the past ten years, with Whose Line cast mate Brad Sherwood, performing a live improv show. An Evening with Colin and Brad, has the distinction of being one of the longest running comedy tours in history. Their first live, taped special, Colin and Brad: Two Man Group, will air soon on the CW Network.\n\nDeb McGrath – Deb, a graduate from Ryerson theatre, honed her comedy skills at the famed Second City in Toronto where she met her husband Colin Mochrie. They moved to L.A. when she co-created a show called My Talk Show. Since then, Deb has done a myriad of TV, film, animation and ads. Her work of late has included, Little Mosque on the Prairie where she plays the Mayor, Single White Spenny, the voice of Winners, The Ron James Show. Deb was also nominated for an Actra Award for the movie Expecting and has been inducted into the Scarborough Walk of Fame, a proud moment for this former Scarborough girl.\n\nDeb created, co-wrote, produced and starred in CBC’s Getting Along Famously with her husband Colin. Together they have also played a husband and wife in Love Letters and Sunshine sketches of a Little Town for CBC, and Living in my Car. Deb has just co-created a pilot called Filling the Gaps with Colin and her writing partner Barbara Radecki. With Barb she created a labour of love-their blog http://themiddle-ages.blogspot.com Last year she and Barb were nominated as one of the 100 most influential bloggers in North America."
