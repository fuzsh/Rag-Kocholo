        "text": "PREVIEW\n\nDebra McGrath and Colin Mochrie\n\nUnique Lives series\n\nWhen: Monday, March 2, 7:30 p.m.\n\nWhere: Winspear Centre\n\nAdmission: $40 to $94, available at the door, the Winspear box office, 780-428-1414, or from the website.\n\nInfo: uniquelives.com/edmonton\n\nWhen comedian Joy Behar was forced to cancel her upcoming lecture in the Winspear Centre’s Unique Lives series, Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath were asked to step up in her place.\n\nIt was no problem for the duo, both of whom are used to getting thrown onstage. Mochrie is best known for his regular role in the long-running improv showcase, Whose Line Is It Anyway. McGrath met her future husband three decades ago when Mochrie auditioned for her at Second City in Toronto, where she worked as a writer, actor and producer. The Canadian husband-wife duo — who’ve made varied careers on stage, film and TV — had already been coaxed into speaking at a Unique Lives event in Toronto, where they live.\n\nAdding a couple of shows in Western Canada, where they’re regulars anyway, wasn’t a big deal.\n\n“We are two of the foremost Joy Behar impressionists, so it’s really worked out nicely for everyone,” Mochrie says.\n\nTheir show will cover a 25-year marriage and the ups and downs of showbiz careers. During their destitute early days in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, they had to sell their CD collection piece by piece to pay for diapers and food for their infant son. As that decade progressed, Mochrie’s profile slowly rose in England with the initial success of Whose Line, but he was still only known in Canada as the Snack Fairy — a character in a tutu in a Nabisco advertising campaign — finally becoming a star in the U.S. when ABC picked up the improv show in 1998. (Mochrie just finished taping another season of the show, which now airs on the CW network.)\n\nThe couple have raised a son together, cared for aging parents together and worked together on several CBC sitcoms. They credit both their shared core values and personality differences for their marital success. It doesn’t hurt that Mochrie — shy in person and “not fond of the humans” as McGrath cracks — does most of the cooking. Mochrie calls his wife “a born entertainer.”\n\nBoth have Edmonton connections. A teenage Mochrie lived in Edmonton in 1970, after his mother, worried about the FLQ crisis, moved the family west from Montreal. McGrath’s ex-husband is a producer and director of Die-Nasty, Edmonton’s improv troupe responsible for the annual Soap-A-Thon.\n\nQ: Tell me how you came to the Unique Lives series.\n\nDM: We had been asked to do the gig in Toronto. We had been asked before, but we had mentioned that we just didn’t think our lives were …\n\nCM: Unique or interesting. We’re really setting this up beautifully.\n\nDM: Hence the new title that we’re instituting for our gig: Mediocre and Hope You Like It!\n\nQ: How do you manage to go up onstage when you’re not feeling it, when life is throwing you curve balls?\n\nCM: There’s a thing in theatre, that as soon as you’re onstage in front of the audience, for that amount of time, there’s nothing else. I’ve done shows where my back is totally out, then I’m doing a show where I’m running around, jumping on mouse traps, and I’m fine. As soon as the show’s over, I’m back to being a crippled old man.\n\nDM: And it’s not just adrenalin, that’s what’s interesting. It’s something else. I did a show with raging food poisoning. We were only open a couple of nights, which meant our understudies did not yet know the show. And we had to place garbage cans offstage. We were truly hurling in between scenes. But you get onstage, and for that moment, you’re fine.\n\nQ: Has improv taught you how to approach marriage?\n\nCM: One of the main rules of improv is a thing called “Yes, and …,” where you just accept anything and you build on that. Marriage is more “Yes, dear.” Deb and I, especially in the last couple of years, have been using that as sort of a life lesson, saying yes to things that may feel like they’re out of our comfort zone.\n\nDM: Like this, for example. My husband is a very shy man. This is not his thing to go talk about his life. But it was in our rule thing, of let’s start saying yes to some things.\n\nCM: The basic rules of improv — listening, accepting your partner’s ideas — really do help make your marriage stronger, when you are actually listening to your partner and you don’t start off disagreeing. You try to see their point of view, no matter how idiotic it may be half the time. And we have laughs, which always helps.\n\nbwittmeier@edmontonjournal.com\n\ntwitter.com/wittmeier"
