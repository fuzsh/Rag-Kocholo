        "text": "Famed dynamic duo of improv, Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath bring their customized, quick-witted, and uproariously entertaining show to conferences, galas, and other events everywhere. Guaranteed to have your audience in stitches, their show proves why — when it comes to improv — it’s “best to say yes”.\n\nColin Mochrie came to international prominence for his memorable appearances on both the British and American versions of the top-rated improv series, Whose Line Is It, Anyway? He is a 25-year acting veteran and an alumnus of Toronto’s famous Second City, the comedy training ground of the likes of Martin Short, John Candy, Gilda Radner, Mike Myers, and Dan Ackroyd.\n\nMochrie has also appeared on This Hour Has 22 Minutes, Getting Along Famously, Are You Smarter Than A Canadian 5th Grader, Living in Your Car, Men With Brooms, Death Comes to Town, The Ron James Show, Degrassi High, and She’s the Mayor. Recently, he appeared in the independent films Young Triffie, Inconceivable, Surviving My Mother, Puck Hogs, and Gravy Train. He is also the author of Not Quite the Classics, a book of stories that takes the first and last lines from familiar classics and re-imagines everything in between.\n\nMochrie was named Canadian Comedy Person of the Year at the Canadian Comedy Awards and has won a Writer’s Guild of Canada award, the “Male Improviser of the Year Award” from the Chicago Improv Festival, and a Gemini Award for Best Ensemble Performance in a Comedy Program or Series. He also received the Barbara Hamilton Memorial Award for Lifetime Achievement in Theatre and Advocacy from the Dora Mavor Moore Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Actra Awards.\n\nDebra McGrath also honed her comedy skills at Second City Toronto. Her work has included the Baroness Von Sketch Show, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Single White Spenny, and The Ron James Show. McGrath also created, co-wrote, produced, and starred in CBC’s Getting Along Famously with Mochrie. Together, they have played a husband and wife in Love Letters, Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town, and Living in My Car."
