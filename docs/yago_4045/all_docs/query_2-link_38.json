        "text": "Colin Mochrie returns for a fifth season on the CW to the hysterical improv show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?” along with host Aisha Tyler and fellow stars Wayne Brady and Ryan Stiles, who put their comedic skills to the test through a series of spontaneous improv games.\n\nMochrie is an alumnus of Toronto’s famous Second City comedy troupe and is widely considered to be one of the leading improvisers in the world.\n\nAfter nine years as a regular on the British improvisation series “Whose Line Is It Anyway?,” he became a regular on the American version hosted by Drew Carey, which ran for six years on ABC and three years on ABC Family. In 2011, the entire cast was reunited in Vegas for “Drew Carey’sImprov-A-Ganza.”\n\nMochrie appears regularly in film and television and was notably a cast member of CBC’s classic news spoof “This Hour Has 22 Minutes” for two seasons. With his wife, Debra McGrath, he produced, wrote and starred in the CBC show “Getting Along Famously.”\n\nA native of Scotland but a life-long resident of Canada, Mochrie has remarkably toured worldwide for over a decade, with Whose Line castmate Brad Sherwood, performing a live improv show. “An Evening with Colin and Brad,” has the distinction of being one of the longest-running comedy tours in history. Their current two-man improv show is Colin Mochrie & Brad Sherwood: The Scared Scriptless Tour.\n\nIn 2012, ABC aired “Trust Us With Your Life,” produced by the makers of “Whose Line” and co-starring Mochrie, Wayne Brady, and many of his former “Whose Line” cast members. The show was hosted by Fred Willard.\n\nIn the past, Colin’s writing for television, stage, and magazines has garnered awards. His first book of fiction, Not Quite the Classics, in which he uses the first and last lines of familiar classics as a launching and landing point and re-imagines everything in between, was released by Viking, a publishing arm of Penguin Canada, in October 2013."
