        "text": "SARNIA, February 4, 2020 – Guests of Lambton College’s fourth annual President’s Gala are in for a two-for-one treat.\n\nThe College is pleased to announce that Canadian comedy duo Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath will be headlining this year’s Gala, which is scheduled to take place Saturday, May 9, 2020.\n\nMochrie and McGrath are a husband and wife comedy team who will bring a lively repartee to the renowned event.\n\nMochrie is an alumnus of Toronto's famous Second City comedy troupe and is widely considered one of the leading improvisers in the world. After nine years as a regular on the British improvisation series Whose Line is it Anyway?, he became a regular on the American version hosted by Drew Carey, which ran for six years on ABC and three years on ABC Family. In 2013, Mochrie was named Canadian Comedy Person of the Year at the Canadian Comedy Awards.\n\nMcGrath, a graduate of Ryerson Theatre, honed her comedy skills at Second City in Toronto where she met her husband Colin Mochrie. They moved to L.A. when she co-created a sitcom called My Talk Show. Since then, Deb has done a myriad of TV, film, animation and ads. Her work of late has included Little Mosque on the Prairie where she plays the Mayor, Single White Spenny, and The Ron James Show.\n\nIn addition to an evening with Canada’s most comedic couple, the 2020 President’s Gala will also feature a gourmet dinner prepared by students in the Culinary Management program under the supervision of Lambton College faculty and Red Seal chefs Alastair Mackay and Michael Mansfield, live music, and live and silent auctions.\n\nAll proceeds from the event support the Envision Tomorrow Capital & Equipment Renewal Campaign, which was established to enhance academic programming, student athletic and recreation opportunities, and applied research opportunities. This initiative aims to further position Lambton College as a leader in educational programming and student life, attracting new students to the area and supporting the retention of highly skilled professionals for the local workforce. In only three years, the President’s Gala has raised over $215,000 for the campaign."
