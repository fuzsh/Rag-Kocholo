This year’s special guests were the husband and wife comedy duo of Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath, who performed improv sketches with the help of audience members. Music was provided by Darryl Romphf and Stu and the Tryplanes, while Hensall-raised comedian Nic Bayley served as emcee for the 10th year.\n\n“It was a really great night, and there were so many people who said it was one of their favourites yet,” McCann said of the 15th annual event. “The vibe was positive, uplifting … Very successful.”\n\nMcCann said every year the hospital provides the hospital foundation with a list of equipment that needs to be bought at the hospital. This year the foundation is funding a list of over $500,000 and will include items such as a second ultrasound machine to help reduce waitlists at the hospital.\n\nArticle content\n\nFunds will also be used to help kick start the foundation’s efforts to construct a new medical centre in South Huron. McCann has estimated a new three-storey building could cost about $15 million, and committees are being formed now to work on the project.\n\n“We’ll definitely need all hands on deck throughout South Huron and surrounding areas,” she said of efforts to make a new centre a reality. “It’s no small undertaking, but we know we can make it happen.”\n\nOne of the highlights of the Gala was during an activity called ‘Fund a Need,’ when organizers attempted to raise $50,000 from the audience of 652 in just five minutes. They ended up raising $215,000, including a $50,000 donation from the Exeter Masonic Lodge.\n\n“That was a great surprise,” McCann said of the Mason’s donation. “That is substantially impacting.”\n\nMcCann said through sponsorships the business community contributed $232,000 to the Gala.\n\nOf special guests Mochrie and McGrath, McCann said, “Colin and Debra were just fantastic. Just such down to earth people, and I think the audience just loved them.”\n\nMcCann is already looking ahead to next year’s Gala, which will be held Friday, June 6."
