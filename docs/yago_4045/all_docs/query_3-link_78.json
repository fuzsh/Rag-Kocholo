        "text": "Susan Catto is deputy editor of Hello! Canada and\n\nhas been with the magazine since 2009. After studying at Columbia and Oxford,\n\nshe returned to her native Toronto and became a freelance journalist with\n\nregular gigs at the New York Times,\n\nthe Economist.com, TIME Canada and Lucky. Susan lives in the east end with her husband and two young\n\nkids.\n\nTwitter: @sjcatto, @HelloCanada\n\nDid you always want to be in the media? If not, what other careers were on the horizon?\n\nAs soon\n\nas I discovered magazines, I wanted to be a freelance writer. I did a detour,\n\nearning a doctorate (in eighteenth-century literature, yay!) and even teaching\n\nuniversity courses for two years. I was freelancing at the same time, though,\n\nand journalism always felt like a privilege, not a job. It was a pretty easy\n\ncall to make.\n\nWhere\n\nwould you like to be five years from now?\n\nStill finding my work as interesting and challenging as I do now.\n\nAny\n\nadvice for people getting started in your industry?\n\nRead a\n\nnewspaper every day — and if you read it online, at least scan each headline,\n\ndon’t just click on the stories you are already interested in. Young people who\n\nare curious and well-informed with good general knowledge really stand out. The\n\npeople you are working for or pitching to may be decades older and it helps to\n\nunderstand their cultural reference points. Plus, life is just more interesting\n\nwhen you know stuff!\n\nWhat are your favourite media outlets, not\n\nincluding your own?\n\nFor work, Celebitchy\n\nand the Daily Mail; for fun, The New Yorker and HBO Canada.\n\nBest\n\ninterview you’ve ever had?\n\nI recently interviewed Joan Rivers, which was a kick because I had interned on\n\nher talk show when I was in university. She didn’t remember me, of course, but\n\nit made for a nice rapport and she was as funny, frank and interesting as you\n\nwould expect.\n\nWorst?\n\nAs a\n\nstringer for the New York Times I once had to knock on doors in rural Muskoka\n\n— at night — trying to find a guy who’d just been accused of child molesting.\n\nI didn’t find him but just thinking of what that interview would have been like is bad enough.\n\nBest advice you’ve ever been given?\n\n“No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.”\n\nWhat\n\nrule(s) do you live your life by?\n\nFind the bright side and practice gratitude.\n\nWhat’s\n\nthe most important tip you can give PR pros?\n\nGet to know what we do and don’t cover so you can tailor your pitch to our\n\nmagazine.\n\nBest\n\nexperience you’ve had with a PR pro? We love to hear about #wins.\n\nI\n\nscrewed up the time of my Joan Rivers interview and Lia Caponecchia at the\n\nShopping Channel had to take the flack for it…but still helped me get a new\n\nslot. Lifesaver!\n\nI hate?\n\nPeople\n\nwho are routinely rude or dismissive. Are they really so important/stressed out\n\nthat general standards of politeness don’t apply to them?\n\nI love?\n\nGodiva\n\ndark chocolate-covered pretzels.\n\nReading?\n\nYes,\n\ncompulsively and indiscriminately…\n\nBest place on earth?\n\nOuter Banks, N.C.\n\nDinner guest?\n\nHero?\n\nTina Fey.\n\nFavourite app (or whatever you are downloading these days)?\n\nNetflix,\n\nto catch up on the first few seasons of Breaking\n\nBad.\n\nPool or ocean?\n\nOcean,\n\nno contest!\n\nVoicemail or email?\n\nEmail.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
