        "text": "World famous comedy improvisors Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath are performing at The Blyth Memorial Hall, Friday May 9th.\n\nColin Mochrie is best know for his work on the British and U.S. versions of the comedy improv TV show “Whose Line Is It Anyway?.“\n\nColin Mochrie and Deb McGrath have been performing for decades. Although they once played a con­stantly feud­ing show­biz cou­ple, they’ve been happily married for years.\n\nMet at The Second City\n\nThey married in 1989 after working together onstage with Second City, the famous improvisational comedy theatre. McGrath was directing the company at the time.\n\nThey currently live in Toronto with their two cairn terriers Frisker and Fanny. They have also lived in England, and the United States.\n\nAccording to a Toronto Star article, McGrath says Mochrie is resident chef. “Colin cooks every meal we eat,” says McGrath, who lists her cooking specialities as toast, milk and fruit.\n\nIn 2006 Colin and Deb worked together on the CBC TV show “Getting Along Famously.”\n\nCon­stantly feud­ing show­biz cou­ple.\n\nSet in 1964, Mochrie and McGrath played a constantly feuding showbiz couple. Much of the action took place backstage at their fictional TV variety show.\n\nIn the clip below, Mochrie and McGrath discuss their early memories of TV. For example, while working on “Getting Along Famously” they were stuck at all the smoking and drinking on TV shows in the 1960s.\n\nThe Blyth appearance is the brainchild of Blyth Festival General Manager Deb Sholdice and Mike “Nug” Nahrgang. Both worked at a local pizzeria years ago.\n\nNahrgang, originally from in Clinton, has won several Canadian Comedy awards and appeared on CBC’s “The Ron James Show.”\n\nOn the Internet Nahrgang is renowned as “Mustard Man.”\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, in 2004 “Mustard Man” made the top five of somethingugly.com’s “Ten Worst Things On The Internet” list.\n\nA few of Toronto’s up and coming improvisors, Ashley Comeau, Dale Boyer, Trevor Martin, Mandy Sellers will also be performing.\n\nShow time: 8:00pm Friday May 9th.\n\nTickets can be purchased at The Blyth Festival.\n\nCall the box office: 1-877-862-5984"
