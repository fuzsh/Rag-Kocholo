        "text": "Experience of Colin Mochrie\n\nColin Mochrie got his comedy start by joining the British comedy improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway in 1988, after working at Second City in Toronto. He starred in the American version of the show in 1998 and had a recurring role on The Drew Carey Show in 1995 as Eugene Anderson. He won the Canadian Comedy Award as Male Improvisational Comic.\n\nColin lived in Los Angeles for a while and then moved back to Canada. He performs corporate improv shows with his wife Debra McGrath. He does a thing called Hypro, which combines hypnosis and improv for a one-of-a-kind comedy experience. It includes audience participation that is both entertaining and funny.\n\nColin tours throughout North America with Brad Sherwood with a collection of games from Whose Line Is It Anyway? and have filmed a DVD of their show called Two Man Group: The Colin and Brad Show.\n\nPerformance Style of Colin Mochrie\n\nColin’s dry humour and improv leanings works well for evening events of corporate meetings or at private parties. He also does well at casino events, fundraisers, clubs, festivals, conventions, and trade shows.\n\nWhy hire Colin Mochrie?\n\nMochrie’s unique and somewhat antiquated performance style and razor-sharp wit have made him one of the busiest and most recognizable actors in Canada. If an evening of improv comedy is a great way to end a day-long meeting, Colin is your man. His corporate performances are quick-witted, tour de forces that audiences can never seem to get enough of.\n\nHow to book Colin Mochrie"
