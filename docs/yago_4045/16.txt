In 1989, Mochrie married Debra McGrath. They both voiced characters in the children`s television series Seven Little Monsters (2000â€“03). They have a son, Luke (b. 1990).

He became close friends with fellow improv comedian Ryan Stiles after meeting him at Second City. It is said, in the Second City 40th Anniversary Retrospective, that at one point, Stiles made Colin`s wife (Deb McGrath) laugh so much, that she peed her pants.
