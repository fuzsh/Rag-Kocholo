        "text": "McDougall History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nThe many centuries old Dalriadan-Scottish name McDougall comes from the personal name Dougal. The Gaelic form of the name is Mac Dhughaill and literally means son of Dougal.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the McDougall family\n\nThe surname McDougall was first found in Galloway (Gaelic: Gall-ghaidhealaibh), an area of southwestern Scotland, now part of the Council Area of Dumfries and Galloway, that formerly consisted of the counties of Wigtown (West Galloway) and Kirkcudbright (East Galloway), where they were descended from Dugall eldest son of Somerled, first Lord of the Isles, and his son Duncan who received the lands of Lorn. The Clan was a bitter foe of Robert the Bruce, who made a narrow escape during one battle with the MacDougals only by discarding his cloak. The brooch of this cloak, now known as the Brooch of Lorn, is a treasured possession of the Chief of the Clan. The Clan faced heavy retaliation and was stripped of their lands once Robert the Bruce secured the Scottish throne. The lands were restored to the Clan upon the death of the king, but passed to the Stewarts in 1388 when the last member of the senior branch of MacDougals died without issue.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the McDougall family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our McDougall research. Another 154 words (11 lines of text) covering the years 1175, 1244 and 1316 are included under the topic Early McDougall History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMcDougall Spelling Variations\n\nSpelling and translation were not standardized practices until the last few centuries. Spelling variations are extremely common among early Scottish names. McDougall has been spelled MacDougall, MacDowall, MacDowell, MacDugald, MacDill and many more.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the McDougall family\n\nAnother 44 words (3 lines of text) are included under the topic Early McDougall Notables in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nMcDougall World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name McDougall is the 4,643rd most popular surname with an estimated 7,461 people with that name. 1 However, in Canada, the name McDougall is ranked the 602nd most popular surname with an estimated 8,388 people with that name. 2 And in Australia, the name McDougall is the 594th popular surname with an estimated 6,573 people with that name. 3 New Zealand ranks McDougall as 686th with 1,037 people. 4\n\nMigration of the McDougall family to Ireland\n\nSome of the McDougall family moved to Ireland, but this topic is not covered in this excerpt. More information about their life in Ireland is included in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMcDougall migration to the United States +\n\nMany who arrived from Scotland settled along the east coast of North America in communities that would go on to become the backbones of the young nations of the United States and Canada. In the American War of Independence, many settlers who remained loyal to England went north to Canada as United Empire Loyalists. Their descendants later began to recover the lost Scottish heritage through events such as the highland games that dot North America in the summer months. Research into various historical records revealed some of first members of the McDougall family emigrate to North America:\n\nMcDougall Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nDuncan McDougall, who landed in New Jersey in 1685 5\n\nMcDougall Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nMary McDougall, who landed in New York in 1738 5\n\nAllan McDougall, who landed in New York in 1738 5\n\nAnna McDougall, who landed in New York in 1738 5\n\nArchibald McDougall, who landed in New York in 1738 5\n\nRanald McDougall, who arrived in New York in 1738 5\n\n...

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Buaidh no bàs\n\nMotto Translation: Victory or death\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
