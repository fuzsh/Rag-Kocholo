        "text": "Frank Bidart (born May 27, 1939, Bakersfield, California, U.S.) is an American poet whose introspective verse, notably dramatic monologues by troubled characters, deal with personal guilt, family life, and madness. His unconventional punctuation and typography give his colloquial and economical style an added emphasis.\n\nBidart graduated from the University of California, Riverside, and later studied at Harvard University. He joined the faculty at Wellesley College in 1972. His first volume of verse was Golden State (1973). It contains “Golden State,” an autobiographical account of a father-and-son relationship, and “Herbert White,” the lurid musings of a psychopathic pedophile; the latter was adapted as a short film by American actor and director James Franco. The Book of the Body (1977) features the dramatic monologues of an amputee and of a suicidal anorexic.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry\n\nCritical acclaim attended Bidart’s publication of The Sacrifice (1983), a collection of five long poems about guilt, among them “The War of Vaslav Nijinsky,” an ambitious mixture of poetry and prose about the dancer’s obsession with the tragedies of World War I, and “Confessional,” a psychiatric examination of a mother-and-son relationship. He followed the retrospective In the Western Night: Collected Poems 1965–90 (1990) with Desire (1997) and the chapbook Music Like Dirt (2002), both of which were finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. The poems of Music Like Dirt were later included in Star Dust (2005), which also features new material, including “The Third Hour of the Night,” a monumental narrative that examines the act of creation through the eyes of Renaissance artist Benvenuto Cellini. Watching the Spring Festival (2007), a book of lyric poems, included meditations on American actress Marilyn Monroe and Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova. The poems in Metaphysical Dog (2013) were preoccupied with sex and death. Half-light: Collected Poems 1965–2016 (2017) was awarded a Pulitzer Prize. Bidart’s 11th poetry collection, Against Silence, appeared in 2021. He also edited, with David Gewanter, the collected poems of Robert Lowell (2003)."
