        "text": "We referred above to two McLean brothers who settled at Strathlorne, and were sons of Roderick McLean from the Isle of Rum, Scotland, who, with his family, had settled at Broad Cove shore in 1812.\n\nAbout this same date Allan McIsaac, a native of Canna, Scotland, came to that shore and laid out for himself four hundred acres of land adjoining the McLean lands on the South West.\n\nThis Allan had three sons, John, Alexander and Donald. As we have seen, John settled at Broad Cove Intervale, Alexander and Donald remained at the shore, and got married to two sisters, daughters of Donald McIsaac of Big River who, with Hector McKinnon and Angus Mclsaac No. 1, was the first to settle in Broad Cove. The mortal remains of this Allan McIsaac, with others of that day, are buried on the beach near the entrance to Inverness Harbour. There were no consecrated cemeteries then. We beg leave to suggest that the last resting place of those pioneers should be decently protected from the vulgar trespass of the thoughtless and careless.\n\nAlexander, son of Allan, had a family of six sons and three daughters, namely: John, Donald, Allan, Angus, Aeneas, James, Ann, Mary and Margaret.\n\nJohn, son of Alexander worked faithfully and efficiently on his father's farm till he was past the meridian of life, then he entered the Monastery of Petit Clairvaux, Tracadie, Antigonish, as a lay brother and died there after years of prayers and penance.\n\nDonald, son of Alexander, was the late Father Donald McIsaac, a man of great piety, who served for many years as parish priest at Grand Narrows and River Inhabitants, respectively. In his later years failing health compelled him to retire from the ministry, and he went back to die among his people. He was the very first to be buried in Stella Maris Cemetery at Inverness-on his father's old farm.\n\nAllan and Angus, sons of Alexander, were men of education, and two of the old time teachers of Inverness County. They were natural gentlemen both. Angus died of pneumonia at home, and Allan died out West from natural causes.\n\nAeneas was simple minded and harmless all his life, and lived with his brother James.\n\nJames, son of Alexander, was the youngest son, and the only member of that large family that was married. His wife was Ann McDougall, daughter of Alexander McDougall, Carpenter, of Broad Cove Banks. They had a large family of sons and daughters. The Inverness Railway and Coal Company took for its terminals and working space at Inverness, fifty-three acres of James' farm, and the county paid therefor $100.00 an acre with large costs.\n\nDonald McIsaac, son of Allan, had a family of five sons and five daughters, namely: Allan, Angus, John, Donald, Alexander, Catherine, Mary, Margaret, Teresa and Bella.\n\nAllan was married to Margaret McEachen of Judique and had a family of whom Doctor J. A. McIsaac of New York was one. His son Daniel is now in possession of the old farm, and is also Mayor of Inverness town.\n\nAngus had been for years in New Zealand, accumulated some gold, returned home and entered into business at Margaree. He married Margaret Gillis (Peggy Iain Gobha) of Margaree Forks, and afterwards went to Minnesota, and engaged in farming. He died in Minnesota, after which his widow returned to the County of Inverness.\n\nJohn, son of Donald, was married to Mary McLeod, daughter of Neil McLeod of St. Rose, and had a good family of three sons and two daughters.\n\nDonald, son of Donald, was married to Christy McLeod of Antigonish Harbour, and had a family of two sons and three daughters, all of whom are now dead. He was the Postmaster at Inverness when he died. His widow afterwards died in Antigonish, but was buried at Inverness.\n\nAlexander, son of Donald, died young and unmarried. Three of the daughters of Donald were well married, and two remained single.\n\nAbout five years before Allan McIsaac mentioned above came from P. E. I. to Broad Cove shore, his brother Angus (Aonghnas MacNeil) had settled at the head of the Pond, (now Inverness Harbour) and was the first man to settle there. He had five boys, namely Archibald, Donald, Roderick, Angus, Og and James. They took up a large tract of land consisting of six hundred acres running from the Pond westwardly along the Banks of Broad Cove. This lot was divided and set apart in four equal shares for the four sons Archibald, Donald, Roderick and Angus Og.\n\nArchibald held the moiety at the head of the Pond. He was married to Miss McIsaac, daughter of Neil McIsaac, Foot Cape, and had a large family. After his death the widow sold the farm to Donald Beaton, and moved with all her children to Codroy, on the West coast of Newfoundland. Donald Beaton conveyed this lot to his son John E. who is now the owner and occupant thereof.\n\nThe next lot was taken and occupied by the son Donald (Domhnull Ruadh) who married Mary McDonald of Whycocomagh, and had a family of sons and daughters. After his death his farm was sold for debt by the Sheriff of Inverness to James Gillis who went into possession and reconveyed one-half the lot to Angus and John, two sons of Red Donald. These two brothers still hold their shares. James Gillis occupied his portion for many years, and then sold it to his nephew Hugh Gillis, who conveyed it to his father Angus Gillis, who conveyed it in his turn, to his daughter, Mrs. Allan McDonald, now in actual possession.\n\nThe third lot was held by the son Roderick McIsaac who had a family of two sons and six daughters, namely:- Lewis, Alexander, Mary, Sarah, Jessie, Mary Jr., Margaret and Catherine. On the death of Roderick the farm was divided between the two sons, Lewis and Alexander.\n\nLewis was married to Christy McLean, daughter of Neil McLean, and had one son and three daughters. Lewis himself, his wife and son are dead long since. The daughters got married many years ago and left the place.\n\nAlexander was married to Mary Rankin, daughter of Duncan Rankin, Senior, Sight Point, and had several sons and daughters. He remained on the place all his life and was noted in all respects as an exceptionally just and honest man. His oldest son Rory, who lives on the homestead is now the competent owner and manager of the farm.\n\nThe next lot to the West was that of Angus McIsaac, Og. He had quite a family of able boys. After some years on this farm he decided to move, with his family to Codroy, Nfld. He therefore sold his farm property to the late George Cameron, Mason, who went into possession, was married twice and died there. His two respectable sons, Hugh and George, now own the estate in severalty.\n\nThe next two hundred acre lot was originally owned by Neil McLean, son of Roderick McLean from the Isle of Rum. Neil had two sons and three daughters. On his death the place was given to the two sons, Donald and John, share and share alike. John's share was sold and is now in the hands of George Ross and Harry Ross. Three of Donald's sons, Neil, John A. and Hugh, own their father's share, and are turning it to good account.\n\nThe pioneer settlers on the next farm were three McIsaac brothers Alexander, Donald and Angus, who afterwards moved to Broad Cove Intervale. Their interest in the shore farm was sold to Martin McPherson from Antigonish who did business there on a modest scale for some years. He subsequently removed to Broad Cove Marsh,. and his interests here were acquired by Malcolm Campbell an excellent man, whose descendants are now holding forth there. Malcolm Campbell was married to Catherine Cameron daughter of John Cameron of South West Mabou, with issue, one son, Angus, and one daughter Katie. This Angus is now dead, but was married to Catherine Beaton and left a very large family. Some of that family with their widowed mother are now the parties in possession. Malcolm Campbell's. daughter Katie is the kind and clever wife of John E. Beaton of Inverness.\n\nTHE MacDOUGALLS OF B. C. BANKS.\n\nNow we come to a large block of land containing seven hundred and fifty acres, selected and located by Lachlan MacDougall, a native of Moidart, Scotland, who emigrated with a grown up family in the last stages of the eighteenth century and came here from Antigonish, to mark out and secure a permanent home, in the summer of 1808. He divided this block into three lots of two hundred and fifty acres each. The Eastern lot he set apart for his son Archibald; the central lot for his son Duncan; and the Western lot for his son Alexander. There was another son, Hugh, who founded for himself a home at Broad Cove Marsh, and is elsewhere referred to.\n\nThis Lachlan MacDougall was an exiled scion of the House of Lorn. His people fought like Trojans for William Wallace; but, yielding to the sinister entreaties of \"the red Comyn\", they fought with equal valour against \"The Bruce\", and for Bailiol, and thereby lost their estate. When they lost their estate, they were left to their fate. It was ever thus. When people are deprived of their worldly goods, the world throws them to the wolves. Fortunate are they who believe in another world, and govern themselves accordingly. Lachlan MacDougall was the first man buried in the first Catholic Cemetery of Broad Cove. Archibald MacDougall, son of Lachlan, was married to Mary MacDougall, daughter of Roderick McDougall (Ruaridh Cleirach) of Malignant Brook, Antigonish. She was an aunt of Reverend Roderick MacDonald of Antigonish, and of the late Right Reverend Ronald MacDonald, Bishop of Harbor Grace. When the latter was parish priest in Pictou, he came one day into the settlement of B. C. Banks to collect money. He told his aunt (his mother's sister) he would stay with her that night on his return, but he failed to show up, though the distracted aunt sat up all night for him. He came early next morning and received a sound Gaelic scolding from his aunt. She told him, among other things, that his good father would not pass a night in a stranger's house so near her. His suave reply was:- \"Well, auntie, I suppose my poor father would not do it, but, unfortunately, I took after my mother's people.\"\n\nArchibald MacDougall's family were, Lachlan, Duncan, Ann, Katie, Mary and Margaret.\n\nAnn was married to Lachlan MacDonald, Rear Ranks, and had a large family, namely: Roderick, Archibald, Dougald, Angus, Ann, Mary, Katie, Nancy and Sarah. Lachlan McDonald was married a second time, to Jessie McLellan of West Lake, and had Angus Jr., Margaret and Elizabeth.\n\nCatherine was married to James McInnis of Rear Loch Ban, and had a family of two sons, John and Archibald.\n\nMary was unmarried, and died at home from natural causes. Margaret died at home by an unfortunate accident. She was left alone, and well, in the house one fine day in haymaking time. Mysteriously a fire broke out in some part of the building, which was too far advanced before she discovered it. At once she went outside; but remembering something which she wished to bring with her, she returned into the house and was probably overcome by the smoke and flames. She was burned to death when they found her.\n\nThe farm was left to the two sons, Lauchlin and Duncan, in equal parts. Duncan never got married. For a score of years he carried on a small mercantile business at the Banks, and at the same time conducted the work of the farm. During his business career he walked seven times to Halifax; went there on horseback three times, and with a horse and \"gig\" once. The \"Gig\" was a novelty and a luxury at one time. A cushioned car then would spell sudden death. Old the good old times.\n\nLauchlin MacDougall (son of Archibald) was married to Sarah McIsaac daughter of Roderick McIsaac (Red) with issue, Archibald, Roderick, Mary Ann and Jessie. The two sons died young, and the two daughters married, Mary Ann to John Rankin (Alexander) and Jessie to Charles McDonald (Codroy). Both daughters had smart families.\n\nThis Lauchlin was a particularly cheerful and pleasant man, with an immense fund of the old Scottish legends. He lost his eyesight long before he was an old man, but lived on till he was past ninety in total blindness, and edifyingly resigned to his life and lot.\n\nDuncan MacDougall son of Lachlan Senior, took up the white man's burden on the central lot. He was married to Ann MacDonald, daughter of Lachlan McDonald (Lachinn Mac Ruaridh) of Antigonish with issue: John, Ronald, Dougald, Lachlan, Alexander, Angus, Mary, Ann and Catherine. He and his brother Alexander were married to two sisters. Jane was the name of Alexander's wife. Another sister of theirs by the name of Christy was married to John Cameron (Red) of South River, Antigonish. In this way two of the Macdougall families of B. C. Banks were first cousins of the late Bishop Cameron.\n\nDuncan was a tailor by trade, and died while the family was young, and all together. Duncan's wife also died comparatively young. The daughters Mary and Ann got married at an early age, and the home, which was a favorite stopping place for the wayfarers of the time, was familiarly called \"Tighe na Gillean.\"\n\nThe oldest son, John, was now the head of the house. He was a man of great industry and good judgment, a famous dancer, and withal a kind and genial host. People say he was a poet; we do not know. We did hear some of the songs which he composed, and they ran with wonderful ease and smoothness. They could be put to music like Tom Moore's melodies. We are inclined to believe they indicated something of the \"divine spark.\" He died unmarried.\n\nRonald took up a farm at North Cape Mabou, and lived to a good round age. He was married twice. By the first marriage he had no issue, by the second he had John R., Malcolm, Archibald, John, Duncan, Margaret and Ann.\n\nDougald, also lived at North Cape Mabou, and was married to Margaret McDougall, daughter of Angus McDougall (Ban) of West Lake Ainslie, with issue: Duncan, Alexander, Angus, John, Donald, Archibald, John Jr., Ann, Margaret, Mary and Jane. Duncan, John, John Jr., Ann and Mary are dead; Alexander owns a large farm on the summit of North Cape Mabou, Angus is in San Franciso, Daniel in Sacramento, Archy in Edmonton, Alberta, and Jane in Duluth, Minnesota.\n\nLachlan and Alexander remained on the shore homestead, each owning one-half thereof.\n\nLachlan locally known as Lachinn Ban was married to Mary McEachen daughter of John McEachen (Iain Mac Ewin ic Dhunall) of Mount Young, Mabou, with issue:- Duncan, John L., Hugh L., Mary, Annie, Jane, and Mary Ann.\n\nHugh L., is on the homestead married to Jane MacDonald, daughter of the late Donald McDonald of Broad Cove Chapel, and has a fine family. John L. resides at Strathlorne, is a Barrister of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia, has been practising law in this County for thirty-eight years, is married to Caroline, daughter of the late Hon. Isaac Le Visconte of Arichat, and has four clever living sons, namely: Lachlan Gordon, Bertram Camillus, John Cameron and Isaac Duncan, M. A. Mary was married to the late Angus McIsaac of West Lake, Jane to Martin Gillis of Grand Mira, and Mary Ann to Lachlan Campbell of Campbellton. Duncan and Annie are dead.\n\nAlexander McDougall, son of Duncan, was married to Margaret McIsaac, daughter of Murdoch McIsaac of Broad Cove Intervale, with issue:-John A., Murdoch, Ann, Katie and Jane.\n\nJohn A. was married to Jane Gillis of South West Margaree, issue: Murdoch-Angus, John Alick, Hugh G., James, Maggie Bell, Margaret, Mary Jane and Mary Ann.\n\nMurdoch, son of Alexander, went out West forty years ago and never returned.\n\nAnn was married to the late James McIsaac of Inverness, with issue: Alexander Ronald, Alexander Lachlan, Murdoch, John Francis, James, Dan, Rosa, Mary Maggie, Louise, Cassie and Mary.\n\nKatie was married to Donald McKay late of Glendyer, with issue: John, James, Clarence, Margaret, Maggie Jane, Louise, Rosie, Matilda and Catherine. All these with their mother went away to Winnipeg, Manitoba, and have done and are doing well.\n\nJane, daughter of Alexander, was married in Boston to Angus G. Rankin formerly of Sight Point.\n\nAngus McDougall, son of Duncan, was the youngest of a large family. He was a tailor by trade and never got married. He was lost at sea in a storm, with all on board, on the way to Bay St. George some forty years ago.\n\nMary, daughter of Duncan, was married to Duncan McDougall (Big) of West Lake Ainslie, with issue: Donald, Duncan, Alexander, Margaret, Ann and Mary Ann.\n\nAnn was married to Donald McDonald of South Cape Mabou, with issue: Duncan, Roderick, John, Angus, Ann and Christie.\n\nCatherine was married to Donald MacDonald (John Michael's son) of Rear Judique Chapel, with issue: John, Duncan, Hugh, John Jr., Annie, Mary and Catherine.\n\nAlexander MacDougall, son of Lachlan from Moidart, took possession of the Western lot of the aforementioned block. He was a powerful man physically, and was married as already said to Jane MacDonald, daughter of Lachinn Mac Rualidh, with issue: Lachlin, Dougald, Duncan, Donald, John, Flora, Catherine, Ann, Mary and Christy.\n\nThe three last named daughters remained unmarried.\n\nFlora was married to John Campbell (Ban) of Rear Loch Ban, with issue: John, Donald, Lachlan, Malcolm, Alick, Mary, Jane, Catherine and Christie.\n\nCatherine was married to Donald Jameson of Rrear Loch Ban, and had one son and three daughters.\n\nLachlan, the oldest son, died young and unmarried.\n\nDougald was married to Elizabeth McDonald, daughter of Donald McDonald (Saddler) of Black River, with issue: John, Donald, Alick, Angus, Maurice, Sarah, Jane and Maggie.\n\nDonald was married to Jessie Rankin and had a nice family of sons and daughters. Duncan was never married.\n\nJohn was the youngest, and was a carpenter by trade, went to the United States when quite young, enlisted in the civil war there, and afterwards moved out to the California coast. He settled down in St. Barbara, where he got married, raised a smart family, and died.\n\nThe next pioneer settler at the Banks was old Archibald McIsaac who came here from Antigonish with a brother, Hugh, who settled at South West Margaree. We think they were grand uncles of the late Judge McIsaac of the County Court.\n\nArchibald was married to a daughter of old Lachlin Macdougall (from Moidart) heretofore described. He took up four hundred acres at the Banks which were divided among three of his sons, namely: Archibald, Og, on the old homestead, John, the tailor, in the centre, and Donald on the Eastern side. Donald afterwards sold out his portion to Hugh Rankin, whose heirs and descendants still own it. The heirs of Archibald, Og, and of John, the tailor, are still in possession of their ancestral properties.\n\nArchibald McIsaac had two other sons, Angus and Dougald, besides the above named. The former had a large farm at South Cape Mabou, was married to Mary McDonald, daughter of John McDonald (Michael) of Rear Judique, and d had a large family.\n\nThe son Dougald died suddenly at Grand Narrows in midwinter, after a heavy snow storm. His friends at the Banks were obliged to carry, or pull, the remains home to Broad Cove, on an improvised hand-sled. In connection with his death the following story ran: In a certain house at the Grand Narrows, on a certain night, a little girl in her early teens, saw a vision of a dead man in the house. She got excited and frightened; but they calmed her down by making her believe it was only a dream. The following evening Dougald McIsaac and his brother went into that house to spend the night. Both were in perfect health. The little girl ran screaming to her mother saying, \"Oh, mamma, that is the dead man I saw last night.\" Within an hour Dougald McIsaac had a violent heart pain, and before midnight he was dead.\n\nAnother pioneer settler at Broad Cove Banks was a natural sprig of the heather named Allan MacDonald, very commonly known as Allein Beg. As the name implies, Allan was not a man of bulk physically, but was \"every inch a man.\" He who judged Allan by his size ran an imminent risk of getting left. He came to the Banks with one son, John and two daughters, Sarah and Catherine. Another daughter was married to Captain Angus MacDonald, Tulloch, of West Lake Ainslie. An older son, Ronald, did not, we understand, come with him to Broad Cove Banks.\n\nThe son, John, was a most interesting proposition with his fists. He, too, was a small sized man, but made many bigger men look smaller. He was left-handed, and his punch was deadly. No matter who faced or attacked him, the first blow John landed was the last word in the argument. He was a nice honest clean hearted man when no offence was given him. He left a family of three fine sons, James, Angus and Allen, all of whom are dead.\n\nThe family of Allan Jr., is now in possession of the homestead.\n\nBefore Allein Beg came here he had lived for years at Sight Point. One of his neighbours there was Hugh McLean, better known as Ewin Og, who had wit to burn. He was a poet, with a penchant for playful sarcasm. Allein Beg and Alexander McLeod, an innocent neighbour, were the special objects of his raillery. Allein Beg would come in a rage to kill Ewin Og for his satires. Ewin Og, would restore peace by composing on the spot, a song in praise of Allein Beg. The latter was propitiated, and went away comparatively happy; but before he reached home a fresh satire, much worse than the first, was red hot on his heels. It was not a happy life. The three men sold out at Sight Point, and left the place, Allein Beg coming to the Banks, Sandy McLeod buying a farm at Deepdale, and Ewin Og going to River Dennis. Far enough apart to ensure the preservation of the peace. Poor Ewin Og! He was never bad at heart; but the exuberance of his poetic genius sometimes outran his judgment.\n\nOne of the first families to Settle on Cape Mabou was the family of Patrick McKay who came from Scotland, in the early part of the 19th century. Patrick had three sons and several daughters, who made their homes at North Cape. The names of the three sons were Alexander, Donald and Allan (Ban.) They were staunch and sturdy men of the Presbyterian faith.\n\nAlexander had two sons, Archibald and John, commonly called the \"big boys\" - Na Gillean Mhor - each of whom had a large family. Of these two families, Allan, son of John, is *he only one now left on the 'homestead.\n\nDonald, son of Patrick, was an interesting character, who, also, had two sons, Roderick and Donald. The former of these two sons died unmarried, the latter with a son and daughter is still on the old farm.\n\nAllan (Ban') had a large family of sons and daughters. He was a thrifty farmer who was always noted for his good horses. His oldest son, Donald, succeeded him on the farm where he distinctly \"made good.\"\n\nThere were three McIntyre brothers among the early farmers of North Cape. Their names were Archibald, Donald and Joseph. Each of them had a large family. One grandson of Archibald and a grandson of Donald, are all that are now left of those McIntyres on North Cape.\n\nThere were two able families of Frasers. nearly all of whom have died or dwindled away. One grandson of Simon Fraser (John, son of Neil) is now the only Fraser resident of North Cape, and he is doing well there.\n\nJohn McQuarrie (lain Taillear) was another of the pioneer farmers of North Cape. He had several sons, namely: John, Donald, Edward and Hector, and each of these sons had an intelligent family. Only one son of John Jr., still remains there.\n\nAnother early resident of North Cape was old John McArthur from Canna, Scotland. He had two sons, John and Duncan, both of whom were married. John had a large family, but Duncan died without issue. These men were fine men, very able physically, and quiet and amiable in disposition. Their fine large farm is now vacant and forsaken.\n\nThe most of the settlers of North Cape developed the same impatience for leaving their farms which we deplored in our remarks on South Cape. We adhere to the opinion that it is a costly mistake to quit the cultivation and possession of fertile farms anywhere.\n\nThe farms are the feeders of the world, and nothing else can take their place. Cape Mabou may have its drawbacks and disadvantages. So has every place on earth. That way lies victory.\n\nThe only old settlers at Port Ban and Sight Point who are not elsewhere mentioned were the McIntyre family and Alexander Kennedy.\n\nAbout the year 1810 Alexander Kennedy with his brother Murdoch came to Sight Point. In 1791 they came from Canna, Scotland, to Parrsboro, Nova Scotia, with two other brothers, John and Donald. The two last named came to Broad Cove in 1808 and Alexander and Murdoch came to Sight Point a couple of years afterwards.\n\nMurdoch did not stay long at Sight Point, having taken up a large tract of land at Loch Ban, where some of his descendants still live.\n\nAlexander remained all his life on the Sight Point farm. He was married to a Miss McIntyre, a sister to old Archy McIntyre, by whom he had six sons and two daughters, namely: John, Angus, Neil, Archibald, Donald, Joseph, Mrs. John M. McIntyre, and Catherine. The youngest son, Joseph, and Neil's widow with one of her sons are all that remain on that old homestead.\n\nThe McIntyres who remained at Port Ban were two brothers, John and Donald. Both of them lived, worked and died on the old farm.\n\nJohn was married to a daughter of Alexander Kennedy and had a large family of sons and daughters. The oldest son, Angus, and the unmarried daughter Katie, live on the old farm. One of the daughters was married to the late Angus Gillis, Drover, of Broad Cove Chapel, another to John Campbell, Carpenter, of Inverness, and a third was the first wife of Angus Rankin, Jr., of Sight Point.\n\nDonald McIntyre was a nice man of gentle manner who was very much liked. He was married to Mary McPhee, a daughter of Neil McPhee of North Coal Mines, Mabou, She was an admirable woman and had a family of three sons and three daughters, namely, Angus, Francis and John, Mary, Matilda and Julia.\n\nMary was married to the late Michael Kennedy, son of Murdoch, Matilda to Angus Kennedy, Esquire, son of Murdoch; and Julia to John B. Beaton. The last named couple are dead.\n\nAngus and Francis have been since more than thirty years in the Western States, where we are glad to hear both are doing well. John B. and his wife live in the town of Inverness. The old farm has passed into other hands.\n\nTHE MacLEANS OF FOOT CAPE.\n\nLachlan, son of Hector, first of Muck, had a son named John. This John married a Miss Campbell by whom he had two sons, Lachlin and Alexander. Lauchlin was drowned at the age of twenty-two. Alexander married Eunice MacKinnon by whom he had six children, namely: Lauchlin, Donald, Malcolm, Christy, Mary and Catherine, all of whom, except Catherine, emigrated to Cape Breton in 1826.\n\nLauchlin, known as Lachlinn Mac Alasdair, was born in 1763. He was ground-officer in Rum for thirty years. He married Mary MacKay, by whom he had Donald Ban and Marion, and came to ,Cape Breton in 1826, settling down in Strathlorne at Foot Cape.\n\nHis son Donald Ban was married in Scotland to Christy McLean, daughter of John Mor MacLean of Kilmory in Rum, and had the following family, namely: John, Lachlan, Alexander, Murdoch, Allan, Donald E, Hector, Neil, Marion, Isabel and Christy. Donald Ban died at Foot Cape in 1874 at the age of eighty years. The daughter Marion was married to Squire John MacDonald of Brook Village, and had a family; Christie was married to Donald MacLean (Neil's son) of Broad Cove Banks, and had a family, and Isabel, who always remained. on the homestead, died unmarried.\n\nThe eight sons of Donald Ban were a striking family. They were all large, fine looking men, of very considerable physical strength and, also, exceedingly quiet and peaceable men of excellent disposition. Of the eight sons John and Alexander were the only two that got married. Alexander was the father of Reverend Lachlan Hugh McLean, a young Presbyterian minister of much promise. Allan and Donald E., were familiar school teachers in the County of Inverness. They were among the first batch of Inverness aspirants to qualify under Dr. Tupper's original Education Act for Nova Scotia. They were both pupils of Dr. Forrester at Truro.\n\nTHE MacISAACS OF FOOT CAPE.\n\nDonald McIsaac, Miller, and his brother Allan, were not immigrants, but were permanent residents who gave a vast amount of substantial service. They were sons of John McIsaac described among the first settlers of Broad Cove Intervale.\n\nDonald was married to Mary Gillis (Mhari Aonghas ic Ewin) of South West Margararee. Some of our readers may remember her brother, Martin, an ecclesiastical student who died in Quebec. The family of Donald the Miller were: John, Angus, Allan, Stephen, James, Anthony, and Sarah. When the family were grown up, and all together, they were marked producers. They operated a fine 200 acre farm, a gristmill, sawmill and carding mill. Apart from these milling and farming activities, the son Angus carried on a retail mercantile business until his health gave way. The only members of this family that were married were John, James and Sarah. All the rest died comparatively young. Donald the Miller was a brainy, pleasant and respectable citizen.\n\nAllan McIsaac lived further down towards the shore. He bought the farm on which he made his home. He was married twice. By the first marriage he had five children, namely: Alexander, John, Margaret, Ann and Lizzie. By the second marriage he had Joseph, John A., and Mary Ann. Some of the first family are dead, and all have left this place long since. Joseph and John A., with their interesting families, are settled down on the old homestead, to which they have added by purchase. They are two of the most sane and solid men of the district of Strathlorne.\n\nTHE MacDONALDS OF FOOT CAPE.\n\nLauchlin MacDonald and family were already noted in the sketch ,of B. C. Banks. But two other MacDonalds, two brothers, Allan and Alexander, who came from Canna, Scotland, took up their abode at Foot Cape. Each of them took up a farm of two hundred acres adjoining one another. Both were married and had large families.\n\nAlexander's family were: Hugh, John, Allan, Murdoch, Norman, Neil, Catherine and Christie. John was a farmer, Hugh and Norman were carpenters, Allan was a shoemaker, Murdoch was a tailor, Neil R a mason - and all were wits. The humorous sallies of Norman, Murdoch and Allan are quoted by the younger generations to this day. They were an easy-going, happy-minded family, who never displayed any nervousness to get rich all in a heap: yet they were delightful men to meet and talk to. But they are all gone, and greatly missed.\n\nAllan's family were; Duncan, Neil, Malcolm, Alexander, Roderick, James and Elizabeth. This Allan had received some common school education before he left the old country. He even had some dips into medical works, a circumstance which gave him great demand among the sick of the neigborhood. There were no registered doctors here in those days. Allan was a kind and gentle nurse, a good fiddler, an agreeable companion, and a thoroughly welcome visitor. The neighbors had faith in him, and we have no doubt he helped many sad sufferers."
