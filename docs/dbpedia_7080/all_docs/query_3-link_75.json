        "text": "Hi! Paula,\n\nIt would be wonderful if you could locate Isobel(la) Carswell nee Corrie b 20/2/1818 m 12/2/1841 to William Carswell they had 3 children Thomas b 13/12/1841, Mary b 10/7/1843 and William b 12/9/1845. she was widowed on the death of William 8/8/1845, since then I cannot find anymore on Isobella, son Thomas last known 1851 census living Irongray with his grandmother Mary Corrie, of daughter Mary nothing known,son William d 1923 and is buried in Carlisle cemetery, they lived in New Abbey Kirkcudbright up to the time she was widowed\n\nI need to know where Isobel(la) Thomas and Mary are buried so I can visit the graves and complete my search\n\nBest wishes\n\nIan Carswell\n\nhi ian\n\ngodddd this is hard lol\n\ni have 2 thomas carswells dying 1869 port glasgow dont think yours as there was thomas carswell born in glasgow about the same time as yours, the other died 1887 in north bute once again another thomas born same time in bute so not looking good on that part, the only other thomas carswell i have found dying in newabby died 22/3/1836 so may be related to your william carswell, the same goes for mary and isabella currie but i will keep persisting i love challenges and will contact you as soon as i know anything concrete\n\nhi sandra\n\nwill try for you do you know if they died in scotland or when they were born as at moment no marriage and have tried a few combinations of spelling of names\n\nHi Paula,\n\nIf you are still able to do scottish look ups I would be most grateful if you could find a death for Mary Newall Stevenson, her mother was Sarah Stevenson nee Newall but I think her father's name was Hugh Sharp.\n\nMary was born in Glasgow 23.5.1897, she is on the 1901 census with her mother and Hugh Sharp, any info on her would be appreciated.\n\nThank you\n\njean\n\nHi! Paula,\n\nThe Carswell family are from Kirkgunzeon Kirkcudbright\n\nIsobel Corrie family she was the 8th born of 12 children.\n\nFather Richard Corrie b 1780 farmer Killywhen Kirkgunzeon then Knocklae Balmaclellan and finally Maxwelltown Irongray.\n\nmost sites list Isobel as b at Killywhen Kirkcudbright Abt1819 but I found a Corrie site that lists her birth as Isobel Black Corrie b 20/2/1818 at Lawston Lochrutten which would be the grandparents place, Adam Corrie b 1749 d 30/1/1825 and Isabel(la) Black b 1749 d 6/10/1819\n\nHope this helps , I share a tree with a Paula it may be you\n\nIan\n\nPaula,\n\nThank you for the look ups for Mary Stevenson, the one in Blythswood is her but can't work out which is her death,\n\nthanks very much\n\njean\n\nHi! Paula,\n\nThe light has been switched on, I had never considered the possibility that Isobel had remarried even though she would be in her late 20s early 30s Thomas seemingly kept the Carswell name as I know William the youngest child did, but Mary I do not know. Did Thomas live permanant with his grandmother Mary in Irongray ? did William go to live with the Carswells in Kirkgunzeon ? leaving Isobel and daughter Mary with her new husband ?.more research is need on my part.\n\nBest wishes\n\nIan Carswell\n\nFrank 06,\n\nOn Mary's birth cert.it shows her name as Mary Newall or Stevenson.\n\nMy problem in finding her is that according to the poor relief records she is the daughter of Sarah Stevenson nee Newall and Hugh Sharp.\n\nI have looked under all these names and still can's see her.\n\nthank you\n\njean\n\nSo sorry Frank06, just noticed you did the look ups for Mary's birth and death,\n\nThank you once again. jean\n\nHi Paula,\n\nNot sure if you have any credits left, if so, could you please find who the parents of Archibald Mcdougal who married Margaret Moffat 1841 in Dunbarton. I have a son who was born in 1855 to Archibald & Margaret, Lanark. Thanks\n\nHi Paula - may I take advantage of your good nature for a friend of mine please?\n\nDuncan mcNeil Barclay son of Andrew Barclay marries a Julie Farrell in Mulligar on 23rd February 1919.\n\nDuncan came from Scotland so I daresay did his father? Not sure when Duncan was born\n\nHe was also a soldier but no record of regiment etc\n\nmany thanks in advance for anything you can come up with - understand if you can do nothing"
