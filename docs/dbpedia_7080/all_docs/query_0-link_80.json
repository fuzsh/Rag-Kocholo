All of his brothers were Ironworkers except Jimmie and Joe.\n\nBernie is survived by one son, Daniel and two brothers R.J.

In the same year, Bunty and Jim emigrated along with their young sons, Everett and Dave, to Newfoundland and made their home there.\n\nHe met Charlotte Patricia (Pat) Smith in Toronto, and they later married on 03 August 1968, at St. Cuthbert’s United Church in Toronto. They adopted their son, James David (Jimmy) Hart, and a year later were blessed with a daughter, Kemp Patricia Hart.\n\nDave worked as a high steel tradesman and was part of the crew that built the TD bank centre in Toronto, Ontario. He also appeared in a CBC Canadian film that highlighted steel workers, where he played “himself!”\n\nSome of his passions included boating on “Hart’s Content,” moose-hunting and fishing with family and friends. He loved playing his 12-string guitar and “ugly stick,” enjoying a sing-song, and dancing a “Newfie jig.” Born with many musical talents he shared his heart through music.\n\nAfter retiring, Dave never slowed down, helping family and friends with their renovations, utilizing his skills as a finishing carpenter. Then, fulfilling his dream, he headed back to Newfoundland in 2015. He bought a cabin by the sea as well as a new truck, and shared “life on the Rock” with Beverley Gosse-Kinden.\n\nDave leaves behind his partner of many years, Patricia, and their two children, Jimmy and Kemp Hart, along with a granddaughter, Kelsey Emma Rumley.
