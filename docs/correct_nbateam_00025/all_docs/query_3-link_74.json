        "text": "Free agent Carlos Boozer is in on-going conversations with four teams, including the Dallas Mavericks, according to ESPN.com's Chris Broussard. The others: Los Angeles Clippers, San Antonio Spurs and Toronto Raptors.\n\nBoozer would likely have to choose the Mavericks for the league minimum. A sign-and-trade, possibly involving Raymond Felton, could provide the space. Dallas is expected to use their $2.8 million exception, the only one they have left, on point guard J.J. Barea. The Mavericks could also target guard Jeremy Lin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoozer's 11.9 points and 6.8 rebounds per-game average represented his lowest marks since his rookie year in the 2002-03 season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the LA Daily News, the two-time All-Star and Olympic gold medalist lost his starting job less than two months into the season amid concerns about his defense. He experienced a string of bench sittings so the Lakers could develop younger talent.\n\nMavericks\n\nBe the smartest Mavericks fan.
