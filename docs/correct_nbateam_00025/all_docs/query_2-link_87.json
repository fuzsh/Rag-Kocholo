        "text": "The cat has barely come out of the bag but basketball fans and critics are busy making mock drafts and keeping an eye on college and school prospects. This is one of the major advantages of a structured system, as it helps track the progress of various athletes who are at different stages in their careers.\n\nA basketball player everyone looking at is Cameron Boozer, but who is he? And why is he everyone’s favorite even though he has still not made it to college yet?\n\nWho’s Cameron Boozer?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCameron Boozer, one of the twin sons of former basketball player Carlos Boozer, plies his trade as a power forward for the Christopher Columbus High School. His other twin brother, Cayden, also plays basketball just like Cameron and attends the same school with him. The 6 feet 9 inches Cameron is known for his rebounding skills and aggression that help him contribute both during defense and offense.\n\nAn astute shooter, Boozer led his national team USA to clinch a gold medal in the FIBA Under-16 Americas Championship in Mexico with a humongous 82-point victory against Canada. Boozer was then named the Under-16 Most Valuable Player. His school performances have been equally exemplary which assisted him in bagging the 2023 Gatorade National Boys Basketball Player of the Year in March.\n\nAveraging 21.1 points with 11.3 rebounds per game and 4.2 assists per match, Boozer became the second sophomore player to win the award in boy’s basketball history. The uniqueness of his exploit can be gauged from the fact NBA veterans namely Jayson Tatum, Karl-Anthony Towns, Kevin Love, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James won the award during high school senior years.\n\nBoozer gained much attention while he was playing Nike’s Elite Youth Basketball League and announced his coming by averaging 22.5 points with 12.2 rebounds per game and 4.3 assists per contest. He got noticed by the scouts for his scintillating performance. “Every time I step on the court, I want to improve and just show [NBA scouts] different aspects of my game,” Boozer had stated as per Yahoo Sports.\n\nRead More: As the Second Generation of LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Others Take Centre Stage, NBA Legend Kevin Garnett Swells in Pride\n\nThe sophomore student again proved his mettle when he faced D.J Wagner of the Kentucky and the NBA legend LeBron James’ son Bronny James and won both matchups. Boozer plays quite similar roles both with Nightrydas and Columbus High School. He is known for his exploits around the rim along with three-pointers, with exceptional ball-handling skills, and has also been compared to Kevin Love for his passing ability. Boozer has a number of colleges wanting to draft him.\n\nBut which colleges is Boozer eyeing?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nFor his on-court brilliance, the Florida Mr. Basketball (2023) became one of the first 2025 prospects to receive an offer from the Duke Blue Devils. Interestingly, his father Carlos Boozer also played for the Duke and had won the 2001 NCAA Championship for them.\n\nThough his choice for the NCAA remains a secret, Boozer in an interview with Zagsblog’s Matt Whitfield had mentioned being in touch with seven reputed universities namely – Arkansas, Duke, Kentucky, Memphis, UNC, Michigan, and Miami. Boozer was fighting for the No.1 spot with Cooper Flagg who recently announced his loyalty to the Duke.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nWatch This Story: Following “Superhero” LeBron James’ Footsteps, NBA ROTY Joins College Football Hype, but Not for Coach Prime\n\nBoozer earned a name for himself quite early and hopefully will not disappoint his fans during his college and NBA career. Though it is still not known which college he will commit to, looking at his career till now, any team that gets him will be at an advantage of dominating the court."
