        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Maybe they devised their own plan, or perhaps the Lakers copied what the Houston Rockets did defensively in their first-round playoff series against the Utah Jazz.\n\nWhichever is the case, Jazz forward Carlos Boozer has been scoring less frequently than he did during the regular season.\n\nBoozer averaged 21.1 points per game and scored 20 or more points in 47 of the 81 regular-season games in which he played. But in Utah’s 4-1 series victory over the Rockets, Boozer averaged 16.3 points.\n\nThe Lakers held Boozer to 15 points in Game 1 of this Western Conference semifinal playoff series, and the Lakers had even better success against Boozer in Game 2 on Wednesday.\n\nPartly because Boozer got into early foul trouble, he was held to 10 points and five rebounds, making only 3 of 10 field-goal tries in the Lakers’ 120-110 victory at Staples Center.\n\n“When I get in foul trouble, I feel like I’m letting my team down,’’ Boozer said. “Anytime a player gets into foul trouble early, like I did tonight, it’s tough to get into a rhythm.”\n\nBoozer picked up two quick fouls in the first quarter and went to the bench, after only playing just 61/2 minutes. Boozer started the second quarter, but 19 seconds into it he was whistled for his third foul and went to the bench for the remainder of the half.\n\nAt that juncture, he was scoreless, having missed all three of his field-goal attempts.\n\n“He’s taken some of the same shots that he’s taken all year,” Utah coach Jerry Sloan said.\n\n“I haven’t had a problem with that. He’s a young guy and he hasn’t been in some of those situations before. He’ll work himself out of it.”\n\nBecause Jazz center Mehmet Okur operates a lot on the perimeter, Boozer is Utah’s primary offensive post presence.\n\nAt his best, Boozer can score on a variety of muscle moves inside, on follow shots obtained from offensive rebounds, as well as medium-range jump shots.\n\nBut the Rockets swarmed him with defenders whenever Boozer got the ball inside and the Lakers have used a similar tactic.\n\n“He’s a big body, he’s an explosive guy with a wide base and once he gets you on the block, he can score on you,” Jazz forward Matt Harpring said.\n\nSloan said Boozer’s teammates can play a significant role in helping to loosen things up for him in the interior.\n\n“A lot of it has to do with our people on the perimeter being able to make some shots,” Sloan said.\n\n“If we have people making shots that takes away some of the (defensive) help.\n\n“If we’re not making shots, then (defenders) just lay off even more and pack it in a little bit more. We have to do a better job of spreading the floor.”\n\nBut Sloan said that every possession cannot consist of putting the ball in Boozer’s hands.\n\n“Other people have to be involved in the game, too, if we’re to have a chance to win,” Sloan said.\n\nSaid Jazz forward Andrei Kirilenko: “Teams definitely pay a lot of attention to him (Boozer) because they know he’s a huge force for us.”"
