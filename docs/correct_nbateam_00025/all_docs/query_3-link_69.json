        "text": "Carlos Boozer was part of the NBA from 2002-2015. The 2x All-Star was involved in some of the finer accomplishments of team USA on the international platform. Part of two Olympic campaigns, he won a bronze and a gold medal. To get there, however, Boozer had to make a lot of sacrifices.\n\nIn his memoir, Every Shot Counts: A Memoir of Resilience, Boozer revealed how he was forced to not use his dominant hand. He expressed that his father used his belt, to restrain him from using his right hand during play. While the drill was surely testing, the NBA veteran said that he overcame one of his biggest weakness because of it.\n\nCarlos Boozer’s father’s strategy to make him a better player\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nA dominant limb is a major reason why an athlete thrives in their respective field. In the case of Boozer, he relied a lot on his right hand, which would also affect his movement on the court. While there is nothing wrong with having a dominant side, Boozer’s father wanted to mold him into an all-round player.\n\nFor that, he would wrap his belt on Boozer’s right arm with his waist. This wasn’t a drill that was only applicable while they were on the court. Boozer revealed in the book “When my father said I was going to do everything left-handed, he meant it.”\n\nHe wrote, “At home, I ate my cereal and brushed my teeth with my left hand, while my whole family got involved policing me.” After two months, his father decided it was time to put his practice to the test. This time when they stepped onto a court, Boozer was able to quickly transfer the ball to his left hand, and make shots and layups.\n\nThis brought immense joy to his father as he shouted with pride “Alright now! Wait till the college scouts see you”. Although the drill was restricting, it made Boozer break out of the “one-dimensional player” tag.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nRead More: Tormented by Friend’s Untimely Death, Carlos Boozer Withdrew From Embracing His Dad’s 1 Passion: “Once You See a Life Extinguished…”\n\nSome father-son time and the fishing experience\n\nThe NBA veteran had a disciplinarian at home and he has benefitted a lot from him. In his book, Boozer reveals that his father was very fond of fishing, but was advised to have some of his friends accompany him. At times when his friends couldn’t make it, Boozer would get a chance to join his father.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nAlthough he was irritated by being woken up at 3 am to go fishing, he wrote that there was a lot that he learned from that process. Most important of which was patience, and being in one’s own company. Boozer’s father surely had his way of imparting his wisdom, but looking at the fact that he helped his son become an NBA star, his ways did work their magic."
