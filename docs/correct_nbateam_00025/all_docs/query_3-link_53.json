Boozer also won a Bronze medal in Athens during the 2004 Olympic games. Since his 2002-03 NBA All-Rookie team season, Boozer has finished the season among the league’s top ten performers in field goal percentage five times and top ten rebounders twice.\n\nHe is known for his strength, rebounding and offensive skill set. ESPN.com, lists Boozer among the “game’s best post players” and among the best at scoring (or “finishing”) under the basket with either hand Boozer credits his father for helping him develop his ambidextrous ability.\n\nI recently sat down with him for an interview and opened by asking him to describe his Gold Medal winning experience in Beijing.\n\n“I’ll tell you the same thing everyone is going to tell you, it was amazing, we had a goal set in mind and I think for all of us, the players, coaches, staff all included it was probably the biggest thing we’ve been a part of in sports,” Boozer responded.\n\nI asked Booze if he would do it again in 2012…\n\n“Absolutely, it’s an honor anytime you get to wear USA across your chest,”�and later to describe what it’s like taking the court against a former.\n\n“We’re like brothers, all of us have a special bond; we’re all very close. We stay in touch and talk all the time now, just because of the experience we went through, and the team that brought back pride to USA basketball,” Boozer continued.\n\nI then asked: What are your thoughts on Chicago as a sports town and Olympic host?\n\n“Huge sports town, great fans very committed, great venue, great to have it here in the states, we haven’t had it since Atlanta. And I think it would be well received, we’d have a great turnout here I think, other countries love to come play here”\n\nIt helps that the international icon of basketball, Michael Jordan made his name for himself there…\n\n“Absolutely, and I had a chance to see the plan, they have a great plan for it too.”\n\nWritten by Paul Banks of NBC Chicago, the Washington Times, and the The Sports Bank.\n\nSend Paul an e-mail here: paulb05 AT hotmail DOT com.\n\nAll other e-mail, including advertising and link proposals, send to: [email protected]\n\nMike Elworth's 2023 NBA Mock Draft\n\nMike Elworth's 2024 NBA Mock Draft\n\nFantasy Football Rankings - May 23\n\n2025 NFL Mock Draft - May 21\n\nNFL Power Rankings - Feb. 22\n\nNFL Picks - Feb. 12"
