        "text": "It took one word for Carlos Boozer to outline his role with the Lakers amid a flooded backcourt.\n\nHe said he “absolutely” sees himself as starting for the Lakers after the Chicago Bulls waived him through the amnesty provision. The 32-year-old also described himself as a “spring chicken” entering his 13th NBA season.\n\n“My body feels great,” Boozer said Friday at an introductory press conference at the Lakers’ facility in El Segundo. “I don’t know how long I’m going to play, maybe four, five, six more years, maybe seven. Well see.”\n\nLakers general manager Mitch Kupchak echoed similar optimism and envisioned the two-time All-Star playing productively between three to five more seasons. Kupchak also sounded surprised the Lakers’ $3.25 million bid was enough to secure Boozer’s rights, although it coincided with waiving backup point guard Kendall Marshall.\n\nStill, plenty of questions loom regarding Boozer’s arrival.\n\nHe said he feels “very confident” he can mirror his career averages of 16.3 points on 52.3 percent shooting and 9.8 rebounds per game. He credited Chicago for keeping him in the loop on its offseason plans, but Boozer admitted experiencing frustration last season with the Bulls after playing limited minutes in the fourth quarter because of defensive concerns.\n\n“I was humbled a lot,” Boozer said. “Every chance to play is a great opportunity. It’s a blessing. I already felt that way. But it magnified more to me last year.\n\n“With that outlook on it, I can’t wait to get to work.”\n\nBoozer also gushed about the “versatility” of the Lakers’ front court featuring rookie Julius Randle, Ed Davis, Jordan Hill, Ryan Kelly and Robert Sacre. Even if the 6-9, 266-pound Boozer professes he can play at power forward and center, how can he fit in amid a loaded front court?\n\n“That’s something for us to determine,” said Boozer, mindful the Lakers have not hired a coach yet. “Part of that is competing every day against each other. When we have a coach in place, we’ll find out what the system is and what direction he wants to lead us in.”\n\nBoozer still envisioned himself providing a heavy dose of veteran experience to a crop of promising, albeit young forwards. Boozer also relished teaming with Kobe Bryant, both of whom played together on the 2008 U.S. Olympic team that defeated Spain for the gold medal in Beijing. Boozer and Bryant frequently have talked and exchanged text messages in the past week.\n\n“He said he’s doing great, feeling healthy and he’s motivated,” Boozer said of Bryant. “He said to just come ready to lead and come ready to surprise some people.”\n\nBoozer also recalled how Bryant’s competitiveness during the 2008 U.S. Olympic run became “contagious,” en element that helped the Lakers end his postseason with the Utah Jazz from 2008-2010.\n\n“It was frustrating,” Boozer said. “You wanted to get to the mountain top and you keep getting stopped by the same team.”\n\nTimes have changed, though. Boozer spent time in the office of president Jeanie Buss who has championship trophies lined up against the window that oversees the Lakers’ practice court.\n\n“I’m excited about those championship balls up there,” Boozer said. “That’s what we play for. That’s why I’m here, to help us get back at that level.\n\n“I’m searching for my first one so that’s great motivation for me.”"
