        "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. – Being the son of a former professional athlete can come with its own unique pressures. But for high school basketball stars Cameron and Cayden Boozer, the sons of former NBA and Cleveland Cavaliers star Carlos Boozer, those pressures appear to be small.\n\nThe twin Boozer brothers led their AAU basketball team, Nightrydas Elite, to a first-place finish in Nike’s Peach Jam tournament this past weekend in Augusta, Georgia. Nightrydas Elite took first place in the 16-under bracket, defeating Maine United 58-50 in the championship game.\n\nCameron Boozer, the top-ranked boy’s high school basketball player in the Class of 2025 per ESPN, is used to stealing the spotlight, but it was Cayden Boozer who led Nightrydas in the U16 championship game.\n\nCayden, the 25th-ranked player in the Class of 2025, scored 23 points on 9-14 shooting (1-1 3P) while adding five assists, three rebounds, and three steals in the victory. Cameron, meanwhile, scored five points and reeling in seven rebounds while adding one assist, one block, and one steal.\n\nNightrydas Elite’s championship game win over Maine United was a highly anticipated battle of brothers, with the Boozer twins leading Nightrydas while Cooper and Ace Flagg led Maine. Cooper, the No. 2 ranked player in the Class of 2025 per ESPN, dropped 18 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists in the championship game while Ace scored 12 points to go with four assists and two rebounds.\n\nBoth Boozers are entering their junior year this fall at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami. Cameron currently has college basketball scholarship offers from Duke, North Carolina, Kentucky, Miami, Florida State, Michigan and Arkansas, according to 247 Sports. Cayden, meanwhile, has received scholarship offers from all of those same schools except for Michigan."
