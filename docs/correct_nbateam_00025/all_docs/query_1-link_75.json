        "text": "Kentucky extended offers to twins Cameron Boozer and Cayden Boozer Wednesday night. The brothers are the sons of two-time NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer.\n\nThe brothers announced the offers on their Instagram stories.\n\nCameron is ranked as the No. 1 overall prospect in the 2025 class. Cayden is ranked as a four-star prospect, the No. 22 overall player in the nation, the No. 4 point guard and No. 4 player in Florida according to the On3 Industry Rankings.\n\nFlorida is the favorite to land a pledge from the brothers according to the On3 Recruiting Prediction Machine (RPM). The Gators hold a narrow lead at 42.7% with Florida State close behind at 37.4%.\n\nDuke is also projected to be amongst the favorites in the mix to land the brothers as their dad played with the Blue Devils from 1999-2022. In 2001 Carlos played a pivotal role in helping the Blue Devils win the national championship.\n\nCarlos would go on to be drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the No. 35 pick in the 2002 NBA Draft. He would go on to play 13 seasons in the NBA before officially retiring in 2017. During that time he played with the Cavaliers, Utah Jazz, Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers."
