        "text": "Carlos Boozer played college basketball at Duke before spending more than 10 seasons in the NBA. Now, his sons are being recruited by the Blue Devils’ rival.\n\nMiami (Fla.) Christopher Columbus Five-Star Plus+ power forward Cameron Boozer and Miami (Fla.) Christopher Columbus four-star point guard Cayden Boozer both recorded offers from North Carolina on Sunday night. They announced the offers on Instagram.\n\nCameron is the No. 1 overall prospect in the 2025 cycle, according to the On3 Industry Ranking, a weighted average that utilizes all four major recruiting media companies. Meanwhile, Cayden is the No. 22 overall prospect, No. 4 point guard and No. 4 player in Florida in the On3 Industry Ranking.\n\nDuke, Kentucky and Michigan are some of the programs to already offer the Boozer brothers. Cameron and Cayden have considered the possibility of playing college basketball together.\n\n“If we do go to school together, it’s gotta fit both of us,” Cameron told On3’s Jamie Shaw on Oct. 11. “You know, it might not be very likely for our team to our school to fit both of us, but if it does, definitely we’ll look into that and definitely talk about going to school together.\n\n“I want to go to a school that is big on defense, a school that will get on me when I mess up. When you know I’m doing something wrong, just help me improve as a player. A coach who will help me as a person, just be there for me to talk to.”\n\n“We have definitely thought about it, and it would be really good to play with each other since we’ve played with each other our whole lives,” Cayden told Shaw on Oct. 16. “But the colleges might not have the fit for both of us, so just definitely just about fit and how we can each contribute to the team. So yeah, it’s something we’ve thought about, but we will just take it all as it comes.”\n\nCameron and Cayden Boozer On3 Scouting Summaries\n\nThe following are the On3 Scouting Summaries for Cameron and Cayden Boozer:\n\nCameron: “It is the feel for the game that pops first when watching Cameron Boozer. At only 14, he is usually the youngest player on the floor, however, nothing is ever rushed with him. His basketball IQ with making the right play, and delivering the right pass is levels ahead of his age. Boozer is a smooth spot shooter with consistent three-point range. He has a consistent release with good balance and touch. The athleticism is a question, both vertically and laterally, but his change of pace can get him to his spots. He does have solid straight-line, vertical pop. Boozer can handle the ball in the open floor and has good court vision. Is he done growing? Dad is former NBA all-star Carlos Boozer. Has a fraternal twin brother, Cayden.”"
