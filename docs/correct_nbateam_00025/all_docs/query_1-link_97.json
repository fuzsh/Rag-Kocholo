        "text": "Carlos Boozer is headed to the Lakers' crowded frontcourt after Los Angeles made the winning bid for the veteran forward waived by the Chicago Bulls via the amnesty clause.\n\nThe Lakers made the highest bid under the NBA's modified waiver process for players who were amnestied, the team announced Thursday.\n\n\"Carlos is an established veteran and a proven All-Star, who will be a welcome addition to our team,\" Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said in a statement. \"We're very pleased to have won the bidding process and to have gained his rights, and look forward to his contributions next season.\"\n\nAccording to NBA rules, teams with room under the salary cap had to bid at least $1.4 million US, the amount of the minimum salary for veterans next season. Details of the winning bid were not provided, though ESPN.com reported that it was $3.25 million.\n\nThe amnesty clause allows teams to waive one player in the first five years of the current collective bargaining agreement without his salary counting for cap and tax purposes. Boozer will still be paid the $16.8 million he is due next season in the final season of a contract he signed in 2010.\n\nHe will join a Lakers team that has already agreed to deals with fellow power forwards Jordan Hill and Ed Davis during free agency, and drafted Kentucky's Julius Randle with the No. 7 pick.\n\nBoozer, a two-time All-Star, averaged 15.5 points and nine rebounds in 280 games with the Bulls. His playing time diminished in recent seasons with the emergence of Taj Gibson, and the Bulls needed to clear his salary to sign Pau Gasol and European star Nikola Mirotic."
