        "text": "BASKETBALL\n\nLakers acquire Boozer after submitting highest bid\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers won the bid for forward Carlos Boozer, who was a recent amnesty release by the Chicago Bulls.\n\nNBA teams with room under the salary cap had to bid at least $1.4 million, the amount of the minimum salary for veterans next season. A person who spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity did not say how much the Lakers bid.\n\nThe amnesty clause allows teams to waive a player without his salary counting for cap and tax purposes. Boozer is due $16.8 million next season in the final season of his contract.\n\nBoozer averaged 13.7 points and 8.3 rebounds last season for Chicago.\n\n• Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary High School athletic director Andy Jalwan confirmed that junior forward VJ King plans to transfer to Paul VI Catholic High School in Fairfax, Va.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 King is ranked by ESPN as the No. 1 player in Ohio and No. 5 in the country. He has multiple college offers, including from Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State, Arizona and UCLA.\n\n• Boston Celtics officials said that Hall of Famer Bill Russell was doing OK after collapsing during a speaking engagement near Lake Tahoe, Nev.\n\nA team spokesman said Russell, 80, felt weak after the fall at the Hyatt Regency resort in Incline Village but planned to return home last night.\n\nGOLF\n\nDiaz shoots 62 to lead LPGA event in Sylvania\n\nLaura Diaz, winless in the past 12 years on the LPGA Tour, shot a 9-under-par 62 for a four-stroke lead after the opening round of the Marathon Classic in Sylvania, near Toledo.\n\nIt was a stunning score for Diaz, who has cut back on competitive golf to raise her two children. She hasn’t finished in the top 25 in a tour event since 2010 after winning twice in 2002 and playing in four Solheim Cups.\n\nSharing second are second-year pro Austin Ernst and Lee-Ann Pace, a South African star on the Ladies European Tour.\n\nCYCLING\n\nArmstrong had meeting with doping panel\n\nAn attorney for Lance Armstrong said the former cyclist met in May with the panel investigating the sport’s doping past.\n\nAttorney Elliot Peters declined to reveal specifics of what was discussed in the seven-hour meeting on May?22 in Washington, but said Armstrong set up the meeting.\n\nThe panel is expected to issue its report on doping to the International Cycling Union later this year.\n\nPeters said there was no request or offer to reduce Armstrong’s lifetime ban from sport in exchange for the meeting.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nSabres re-sign Ennis to five-year deal\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres re-signed center Tyler Ennis to a five-year contract worth $23?million.\n\nEnnis led the Sabres with a career-best 21 goals and added 22 assists in 80 games last season."
