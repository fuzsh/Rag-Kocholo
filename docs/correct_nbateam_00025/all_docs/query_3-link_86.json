        "text": "Cayden Boozer came in at No. 15 in the updated 2025 On3 50. During the 2022 Border League, the 6-foot-3 point guard is averaging 17 points, 6 assists, 3.5 rebounds, and 3 steals. He is also shooting 63.6 percent from the field through his first two games.\n\n“I’m a versatile point guard who likes to attack,” Boozer told On3. “I’ll get my teammates involved and have a developing three-point shot. I improved this summer by just controlling the game. I would get sped up, but as the summer went on, I was able to control myself and not allow the defense to speed me up. I’ll watch a lot of Kyrie Irving and Darius Garland, a lot of those quick guards who know how to control the game. CP3 (Chris Paul), too, the way he reads the game and is so patient.”\n\nThe four-star point guard from Miami (FL) Christopher Columbus High was also at the October USA Basketball Junior National Team Minicamp. That is where On3 caught up with Cayden Boozer to get a better feel for where his recruitment is at.\n\n“So right now, I have offers from FIU, Miami, Michigan, Duke, Florida State, Missouri, and Arkansas State,” Boozer said. “I haven’t really done any visits yet; I think I’m going to wait until after the high school season, just so we’re not too jammed in. I know I definitely want to see Missouri and Michigan.”\n\nBoozer talks recruitment\n\nMissouri: “Missouri just got a new coaching staff, so I’m definitely interested in seeing how they play this year. Coach CY (Young) loves how I’m a bigger guard, and I have defensive intensity. He also said he likes how I control the game. He has continued to say he’s loved watching me play and is excited to keep learning about my game.”\n\nMichigan: “I love the coaches have and I love their team, so I’m definitely going to be watching a lot of their games. I don’t know how I would fit in there yet, so I’m definitely excited to watch a lot of games this year and just learn their offenses and defenses.”\n\nBoozer on Duke\n\n“Their program is obviously a pretty big program, one of the top programs in the country. No one really knows what they’re going to do offensively or defensively yet because they haven’t played a game with Coach (Jon) Scheyer yet.\n\n“There is a new coaching staff, but Coach Scheyer and Coach (Jai) Lucas have definitely been very involved in my recruitment. They’ve both come to a lot of my games and a few of my practices. So they definitely want to just learn more about me, talk to me more, and build that relationship.”\n\nPro vs. College\n\n“I’m definitely looking for college,” Boozer said. “Even with the G-League, I mean, they’ve been doing great, but I don’t need the money. I’d rather have my degree and just learn while in college. And in college, there is better exposure and more nationally televised games. So it’s definitely college; that’s the main thing for me right now.”\n\nIn Boozer’s words\n\n“In a college, right now, I’m going to be looking to play for a coach who believes in me,” Cayden Boozer said. “I want to play for a coach who is not going to make it easy for me, one who is going to push me to be my best. Obviously, after college, my goal is the NBA, so I want a coach who pushes me and wants me to succeed.\n\n“We have definitely thought about it (playing in college with twin brother Cameron Boozer), and it would be really good to play with each other since we’ve played with each other our whole lives. But the colleges might not have the fit for both of us, so just definitely just about fit and how we can each contribute to the team. So yeah, it’s something we’ve thought about, but we will just take it all as it comes.\n\n“Also, I’ll look at the fit; I want the school to have a good fit for me where I can play my position and my game.”\n\nScouting report\n\nCayden Boozer is a strong-framed and aggressive point guard. At 6-foot-2, 6-foot-3 is a tough on-the-ball defender. He has quick feet at the point of attack and a strong IQ, understanding angles, and footwork. There is a toughness about Boozer. He is a good passer, plays well out of the pick and roll, his head is up, and has a great pace. He will need to continue to tighten the handle in traffic and continue to hone the reads, but that is natural growth. The jump shot is streaky; it is something he will need to continue developing to become a consistent threat. Boozer finishes well in the paint through contact. He has a twin brother Cameron Boozer who is also a top-ranked prospect in the 2025 class. Is the son of former NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer."
