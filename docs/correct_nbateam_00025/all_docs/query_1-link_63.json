        "text": "Twins Cameron and Cayden Boozer, sons of Carlos Boozer, rank among the top players in ESPN’s 2025 basketball rankings\n\nCameron and Cayden Boozer, twin sons of Carlos Boozer, are among the top players in ESPN’s Class of 2025 basketball rankings, which debuted Thursday.\n\nBoth freshmen at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, Cameron is listed as a 6-8, 215-pound power forward and Cayden is a 6-3, 185-pound shooting guard.\n\n—SDSU: What Darrion Trammell brings to the Aztecs\n\n—Alabama: What Mark Sears brings to the Crimson Tide\n\n—Best available players in the MBB transfer portal\n\nCameron is atop the list at No. 1 in the initial rankings, compiled by ESPN recruiting specialist Paul Biancardi. Cayden, meanwhile, checks in at No. 24.\n\nCarlos, 40, was born in Germany and grew up in Juneau, Alaska. He was a highly sought-after recruit, eventually picking Duke and Mike Krzyzewski over a handful of high-major offers out of high school.\n\nHe was selected 35th overall in the 2002 NBA Draft, making the NBA All-Star team in 2007 and 2008 while a member of the Utah Jazz. Carlos announced his retirement in 2017 after a brief playing stint in China.\n\nNow, his sons Cameron and Cayden are set to keep the family name represented in the world of basketball. Cameron already began receiving college interest before his first high school game and On3 reported earlier this year that they have received offers from Miami and FIU with many more on the way.\n\nHeader image credit: Vence Dorcilien/On3"
