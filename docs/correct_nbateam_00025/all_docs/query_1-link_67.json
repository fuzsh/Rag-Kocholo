        "text": "American basketball player (1937–2012)\n\nFor the American football and athletic director, see Bob Boozer (American football).\n\nRobert Louis Boozer (April 26, 1937 – May 19, 2012) was an American professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Boozer won a gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics and won an NBA Championship as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971. Boozer was a member of the 1960 U.S. Olympic team, which was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as a unit in 2010.\n\nBoozer was born and raised in North Omaha, Nebraska, and graduated from Tech High in Omaha. One of his teammates was future Baseball Hall-of-Famer Bob Gibson.[1] He attended Kansas State University, where he helped lead the Wildcats to the 1958 Final Four[2] and where he received All-America honors in 1958 and 1959. A versatile 6’ 8\" forward, he was selected by the Cincinnati Royals with the first non-territorial pick of the 1959 NBA draft, but he postponed his NBA career for one year so that he could remain eligible to play in the 1960 Summer Olympics.[3] During that year he played with the Peoria Caterpillars, where he won the National AAU Tournament title and earned MVP honors for the tournament.[4]\n\nHe won a gold medal with the Olympic team after they won eight games by an average of 42.4 points. The team was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010.[3][5]\n\nIn the fall of 1960, Boozer joined the Royals with Olympic teammate Oscar Robertson. As a rookie, Boozer contributed 6.4 points[6] and 6.2 rebounds in a reserve role. The following season, he earned a spot in the Royals’ starting lineup and averaged 13.7 points and 10.2 rebounds. Boozer continued to improve, averaging 14.3 points and 11.1 rebounds during the 1962–1963 season, but the emergence of forward Jerry Lucas, a future Hall-of-Famer, soon pushed Boozer out of the Royals' long-term plans.\n\nBoozer's contract was sold to the New York Knicks in the middle of the 1963–64 season, and he spent the next 1½ seasons in New York. Though Boozer was a productive player with the Knicks, he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 1965. After one season in Los Angeles, where he played a supporting role amid players like Jerry West and Elgin Baylor, Boozer was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 1966 NBA Expansion draft.\n\nBoozer was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the 1966 NBA expansion draft. Boozer flourished in his first year with Chicago, averaging 18.0 points and 8.5 rebounds and leading the young franchise into the playoffs. The following year, he averaged 21.5 points and 9.8 rebounds and became the third Bull to appear in the NBA All-Star Game (after Guy Rodgers and Jerry Sloan). During the 1968–1969 season, Boozer averaged a career-high 21.7 points per game, but the Bulls failed to make the playoffs, and Boozer was soon traded to the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nAfter a season with the SuperSonics, Boozer was traded to the Bucks with Lucius Allen for Don Smith.[7] That season, Boozer played a key role as a reserve as the Bucks won their first NBA championship.\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high † Won an NBA championship\n\nYear Team GP MPG FG% FT% RPG APG PPG 1960–61 Cincinnati 79 19.9 .415 .672 6.2 1.4 8.4 1961–62 Cincinnati 79 31.5 .438 .707 10.2 1.6 13.7 1962–63 Cincinnati 79 31.5 .444 .714 11.1 1.3 14.3 1963–64 Cincinnati 32 22.7 .416 .622 5.6 1.0 11.0 New York 49 33.7 .432 .770 7.6 1.3 17.5 1964–65 New York 80 26.7 .440 .779 7.6 1.4 14.2 1965–66 L.A.
