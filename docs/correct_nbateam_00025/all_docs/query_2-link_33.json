        "text": "Carlos Boozer may not have had many accolades in the NBA, but his career was no short of impressive. Playing 13 seasons in the league, Boozer averaged 16.2 points, 9.5 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game, earning 2 All-Star nods. Prior to this, he helped the Duke Blue Devils win the 2001 NCAA championship. And it seems his twins are now on the path to replicate, or maybe even better, the legacy of their father.\n\nBorn on July 18, 2007, Carlos’ twin sons — Cameron and Cayden — have earned quite a name in high school basketball. But more than that, they proved themselves at the international level as well. So let’s have a closer look at their stats and achievements so far.\n\nCarlos Boozer’s twins in high school basketball\n\nCameron and Cayden represent the Christopher Columbus High School. Cameron earned himself the spot of top-ranked overall prospect of the class, as per 247 Sports. Meanwhile, Cayden stood as the 24th-ranked prospect. However, both the players made significant contributions to their teams.\n\nBy his Junior year, Cameron averaged 20.7 points, 11.2 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game for his high school team. During this time, he also earned himself the 2022-23 Gatorade Florida Boys Basketball Player of the Year. “Boozer is the first Gatorade Florida Boys Basketball Player of the Year to be chosen from Christopher Columbus High School,” read a press note. The 6’9 tall Boozer earned the accolade for leading his high school team, Explorers, to a 26-4 record and the Class 7A state championship.\n\nApart from this, Cameron also earned significant attention for his run at the 2024 EYBL. Averaging 25.8 points, and 13.4 rebounds, he found the top spot on the league’s leaderboard in both PPG and RPG categories. Meanwhile, his twin brother led the league in assists per game. Notably, Cayden averaged 11.1 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 6.5 assists per game at the 2024 EYBL.\n\nAs for his high school team, Cayden averaged 14.6 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game till his junior year. So it’s clear that while he contributes to the scoring department as well, Cayden’s proficiency lies in his playmaking skills. Moreover, the twins seem to work quite efficiently with each other as the two have mostly tasted victories in their contests. This includes winning on international platforms as well.\n\nCameron and Cayden’s success at international tournaments\n\nIt is worth mentioning Carlos Boozer helped secure Gold for Team USA at the 2001 FIBA U21 World Championship. Apart from this, he was also part of the 2004 Olympics’ Bronze winning team and the 2008 Olympics’ Gold-winning team. With their performances at the 2023 FIBA U-16 Americas Championship, and the 2024 FIBA U17 Basketball World Cup, Cameron and Cayden have embarked on a similarly successful international journey.\n\nNotably, the two players made it to the 2024 USA Basketball Men’s U17 National Team from 34 invited players. These invitees also included Carmelo Anthony’s son Kiyan and LeBron James’ son Bryce. But neither of them could make it to the roster, despite Kiyan having an impressive EYBL run. Amid such circumstances, both of Carlos Boozer’s sons finding a spot on the team is shows their quality.\n\nThe final roster of the selected players included Cameron, Cayden, Chris Cenac Jr., AJ Dybantsa, Jalen Haralson, Caleb Holt, JJ Mandaquit, Brandon McCoy Jr., Koa Peat, Jordan Smith Jr., Tyran Stokes, and Jaden Toombs. These players represented Team USA and led them to an unbeaten 7-0 record in the tournament. The star players from the team turned out to be the Boozer twins.\n\nCameron averaged 20.1 points, 9.9 rebounds, and 30.7% FG per game. Meanwhile, Cayden averaged just 4.9 points and 2.4 rebounds, but his playmaking stayed on point with 6.4 assists per game.\n\nAs for the leaderboard, Cameron stood at the top in efficiency and rebounds per game, while second in ppg. And Cayden secured the top spot in assists per game. While discussing the international success, it is worth highlighting that the twins also played an important role in the 2023 FIBA U-16 Americas Championship. While Cameron averaged 16.8 points and 9.8 rebounds, his brother averaged 7 points, 3.2 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game. Now it’s to be seen if the two can reach the same level or surpass Carlos Boozer someday in the NBA."
