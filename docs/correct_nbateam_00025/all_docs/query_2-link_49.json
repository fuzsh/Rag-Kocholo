        "text": "By SAM LANCE KANSAS CITY — Instead of a line of coaches to watch No. 2 overall 2025 prospect Cameron Boozer play, it was a line of fans at Nike EYBL Session 4 on Friday. Post-victory for Nightrydas Elite, where Boozer had a team-high 27 points and 12 rebounds in the 72-50 win over the Florida Rebels, a number of kids made their way to the star forward for photos. And he was happy to oblige. After that, Boozer caught up with ZAGSBLOG.com to talk the latest on his recruitment. The 6-foot-9, 235-pound forward from Columbus High School (FL) named six schools recruiting him hardest — Miami, Duke, UNC, Michigan, Florida and Arkansas — with others still in the mix. Here is his breakdown of each school: Miami: They play really fast. They’re a great team. Great coach. Coach [Jim] Larrañaga is a great coach. One of the best coaches in college. One of the winningest coaches in college. He’s been in the game a long time, so. I’d say they pride themselves on defense and they play fast. Things like that.” Duke: “Duke is obviously a great school, one of the most winningest schools in college basketball. So that’s obviously very impressive for them. Just the way the get at it and make deep runs each year.” On relationship with head coach Jon Scheyer: “We’ve been building it for a long time, I think since freshman year. So we have a good relationship.” UNC: “It’s how hard they play, how great their defense is. Another school that’s one of the most winningest schools in college. Things like that. [Hubert Davis] is a great guy. He really gets his players to get after it, compete every night. That’s what made them so good this year. So that’s probably the main thing.” Michigan: “They have a really good offense, really free flowing. They play fast, I would say that. I’m looking to see how they do this year, you know. I didn’t get to see much of FAU but [Dusty May] at Michigan, the team he’s building, it will be cool to see. [May] is a cool guy. He just reached out so I’m just getting to know him.” Florida: “Coach [Todd] Golden, he’s young. He’s hungry and he wants to win. So I really think that’s the biggest thing that stands out about them.” Arkansas: “I don’t know a lot about Arkansas but coach [John] Calipari is a great coach.” Contact with Calipari since move: “We’ve talked a couple of times.” All of the head coaches from the schools listed above were in Indianapolis to see Boozer play last weekend during Session 3. The Kansas City Session 4 is a dead period, so there are no college coaches in attendance. Cameron is the son of former Chicago Bull and two-time NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer. He also has a twin brother, Cayden Boozer, who is a five-star prospect as well and plays for Nightrydas Elite and Columbus. The forward describes himself as a winning player and that is what is most important to Boozer. “Every time I step on the court my goal is to win,” Boozer said. “I’d say that’s the biggest aspect to my game is I’m a competitor. I feel like a lot of times now there’s a lot of great players but they aren’t playing to win. So my rebounding, my effort, my defense. Those are things that really set me apart.” Boozer’s favorite NBA player is Anthony Davis and his favorite musical artist right now is Luke Combs. “I’m in my country era,” Boozer said. A fun fact about Boozer is he plays the cello and has practiced it since fourth grade.
