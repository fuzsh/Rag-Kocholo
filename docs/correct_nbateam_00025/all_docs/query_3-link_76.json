        "text": "No self-respecting Bulls fan could forget the days of Carlos Boozer punctuating his every action on the floor, and every sentence off it, by shouting “Holdat!” — a ready-made hashtag in a social media-obsessed world.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that when it came time to name his new podcast with good friend and former teammate Nate Robinson, “Holdat!” was involved.\n\nIn case you needed a refresher, the duo used part of their inaugural episode on the Sports Illustrated network podcast to explain the meaning of “holdat,” the origins of which can be traced back to “Sticks,” also known as Joakim Noah, who used to yell something like it after his wonky jumpers.\n\nBoozer, who played for the Bulls from 2010-15, told me Noah will be a guest on the podcast soon, but the podcast isn’t just about the NBA. The duo plan to discuss other sports as well as culture and have a variety of guests. Their latest episode features a conversation with actor Michael Rapaport, who got Boozer to tell the incredible story of the time that Prince rented his house and painted it purple.\n\nBoozer and Robinson, who spent the 2012-13 season in Chicago, have been friends for years. Since officially retiring in December, Boozer has appeared on ESPN and TNT and other networks as an analyst, while Robinson is in the upcoming Uncle Drew movie with Kyrie Irving, Shaquille O’Neal and Tiffany Haddish.\n\nThey’ve also both signed on to play this summer in the Big 3 and the American Flag Football League as team captains alongside Michael Vick and Chad Johnson.\n\nBoozer and Robinson spoke separately with The Athletic about their vision for their new podcast, their days in Chicago, being sports dads and much more.\n\nLauren Comitor: How did the podcast come about?\n\nBoozer: Yeah, so basically, I retired, and I was looking to do things I’m interested in and one of the things I’ve always been interested in was broadcasting, and talking about the game, because I talk about the game so much, with my friends, my dad, my brother, people always in my circle are always talking basketball, talking the game. So I hired an agent, Gideon Cohen, and he came to me with an idea for a podcast. I had a bunch of different people I wanted to do it with, and he said it’d be great if I had a partner. The first person I thought of was Nate, because me and Nate talk almost every day about hoops and what’s going on in the NBA today. So I called him up, I said, “Hey, what are you up to?” And he goes, “Man, not much, just getting trained and ready so I can get back in the NBA.” And I said, “Well, why don’t you come and do a podcast with me?” So he was like, let’s do it. He agreed right away. He was excited about it, I was excited about it, and we just jumped on it. And Sports Illustrated was kind enough to see our vision and like what we brought to the table.\n\nAnd the great thing about it is me and Nate’s angle is so different because we were players that played in the NBA for a long time. I played 13 years, he played 10 years, we’re both athletes who are raising athletes, because our kids also play basketball and football and baseball and different sports. So we have that angle as well. And then we’re also people that are very outspoken as far as our views and our thoughts on how the game is, how it’s transcended, how it’s evolved over time, how it’s different than when we played, when we first came in the NBA, and how we can also make it better. So that’s pretty much how it all got started.\n\nRobinson: It was just something we wanted to do, because I’ve done a podcast in the past with my boy T.J. Regan, we were called the Pod Crashers, we had a cool name, too. But yeah, [Boozer] wanted to do something different, and we both are trying to make our transition to life after basketball. So we wanted to do something that was fun and we had total control of. SI gave us our control, make sure we can do pretty much what we want on our podcast and have our guests and do it the way we want to do it and do a great job of pushing our podcast and getting it out there for the world to see and hear.\n\nLC: You’ve already had an actor as a guest, and you’re going to have a former teammate in Joakim. What other kinds of guests do you want to have on?\n\nRobinson: Yeah, we’re gonna get Joakim, we’re gonna get guys that we, teammates we played with…Like we want to reach out to people that’s not into sports. We want to reach everybody. Next week I have a special guest, I’m trying to get Charlie Ward. I know a lot of people probably don’t know who Charlie Ward is, but a quick explanation, an example of who he is: he is one of the first Heisman trophy winners to switch sports and actually make it to the NBA, and you know, me and him share a lot in common, I played football growing up, played in college, and I went to the NBA as well. I didn’t win a Heisman, but I definitely played football at a collegiate level and then switched sports and made it to the NBA. So I want to pick his brain about that and give people sort of the understanding in how hard it is being a two-sport athlete and try to pick your one true love in basketball, football, whatever sport you may pick, or baseball or track or whatever. And have the people listen to what, you know, his route was before me, before them. And kids can be going through that right now, and they don’t have nobody to talk to. So to have the opportunity to listen to Charlie Ward next week on our podcast, and get some information and some knowledge on how to pick your sport, or whatever.\n\nLC: On your first podcast you guys talked about your experience at NBA All-Star weekend and what it was like being on the other end of the media spectrum. Has that been weird or challenging at all?\n\nBoozer: It’s been pretty cool. I’ve been able to do some stuff with Turner Sports, with TNT, and NBA TV, done some stuff with ESPN, FOX, CBS, so I’ve had a little bit of experience, just commentating and broadcasting. But the All-Star weekend was so different because we were in the media, where we’re used to the media trying to climb through each other to get to us to ask us questions. We were the ones that had to try to climb through the sea of media people, trying to get to, you know, LeBron James or Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook, to interview them while they’re experiencing All-Star weekend. So it was pretty cool, very different.\n\nI got a chance to see, you know, how these guys rub elbows and kind of maneuver their way to the front of the line to get their questions asked, because you have a limited window with these All-Stars. So I didn’t realize, it’s like a shark-infested water out there, you gotta fight to get a good spot to get your question out there, before the athlete gets up and walks away. But it’s pretty cool, it’s cool to be able to see both sides of the thing, so to speak, and see what media people have to go through. It gives you a different appreciation for the sacrifices that they make trying to write a good story. So it’s pretty cool, it’s been going great. It’s been great to be back, and get advice from big brothers like Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O’Neal, different guys, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, guys that are my mentors, so I’ve been getting good advice from really, really good guys.\n\nRobinson: Yeah, it’s a little different, but at the same time, we get the opportunity to, I would say ask questions to another celebrity/sports athlete or whatever, we get a chance to ask the questions instead of people asking us the questions. Like kids come to my camp and ask me, oh, what’s your favorite moment of this and that, like we get to be the one asking the questions. And it’s funny, because we ask cool, fun questions, you know, we don’t want to be too personal into people’s business and stuff, but just to give people a glimpse of what kind of person you are by the question that we ask and the answer that we get from that, from that person. So it’s pretty cool to see personalities outside of what their profession is.\n\nLC: What makes you two work so well together?\n\nBoozer: We just have an amazing dynamic. Like we’re real brothers, we played together in Chicago, we hit it off right away and been friends ever since. We’ve had our kids on vacation together, I just went down to Seattle to go snowboarding after All-Star weekend and we hung out with his kids, and then me and my kids and my wife are going out there to go snowboarding for spring break, and we’ll all hang out together. So me and Nate talk almost every day, we’ve always had great ideas. We’re both very similar. We just come in a different package, I’m a little bigger, he’s a little smaller, but we’re both great parents and we focus on our kids first…we dream big, we’re not one of those guys that think inside the box, we think outside the box.\n\nSo we’ve always had the same values in place, you know. We work our butts off, we’ve got a great work ethic, that’s why Nate was able to overcome his height, because his heart is so big, heart over height, he’s one of those guys that works his butt off. Phenomenal athlete, overcame all the odds to get to the NBA and stay in the NBA. I was one of those undersized power forwards, you know, very gifted and very strong. Different things that I had to figure out, ways to be successful at the highest level, you know, made the All-Star team, won a gold medal, and it’s all because of my work ethic. So me and him both have work ethic in common, so with this, we want to share our stories, share our experiences, as a father, as parents, as athletes, to let people know what we deal with on and off the court, from relationship-wise, to being sons, to being fathers, to being brothers, and how you deal with the different pressures that come with, you know, the territory that we step in, and give our perspective, of real players who lived it. So that’s something that me and him both share.\n\nRobinson: Well that year [2012-13 season], for me, I’m just the energy guy, and I love to make people laugh. And Carlos is a guy that loves to laugh. And then we hit it off perfect, like as teammates. Because I’m the jokester, I’m the one that laughs and makes people laugh, and you know, he’s the one that loves to be loud and he loves to laugh. So when I got to the team it was more, everybody was kind of quiet and laid-back, and I’m like man, we gotta kind of get these spirits up, it’s kind of dull in here. It was dull on the team at first before I came. And then once people warmed up to me and opened up to me, I just became very much the life of the party, and the life of the Chicago Bulls, energy-wise. And we had guys like Stickity (Noah), Luol Deng, Rip Hamilton, Kirk Hinrich, we had a great group of guys. And we were a solid team. We loved each other, it was fun. We went to dinner together, we did a lot of things together as a team, and it was just awesome. And then the relationship just, as me and Booz, being brothers, it just kept going forward. You know, he called me offseason, most guys tend to be with their families and do other things, you know Booz was with his kids, he invited me to the Bahamas with his family, I brought my kids, and it was awesome. And we’ve been friends ever since the Bulls.\n\nLC: What was so special about those Bulls teams?\n\nBoozer: Oh my goodness. I came in 2010, and was there for four or five years, and it was amazing. We just had, our roster was amazing — the talent, but also great guys. Our chemistry was, we were so close, we would compete together on the court for three or four hours in practice at the Berto Center, and then we’d go to the games, and we’d hang out together, go to dinner, go to movies, go kick it with each other. But our talent level, like we had Derrick Rose, MVP, Joakim Noah, Defensive Player of the Year, me and Luol [Deng] were All-Stars, they brought in Rip Hamilton a couple years, we had Nate, C.J. Watson, Taj Gibson, like our team was so full of talent. But the talent was all guys that were good guys. So we were just so close. Our chemistry was so good because we had good guys on the team. And then we’re being coached by Coach Thibs, who had a great defensive system, and we were one of the top defensive teams in the league the four years that I was there. When you get your best players to commit to defense, it trickles down throughout the whole team.\n\nThat’s why it’s tough now to watch Chicago now, because they’re like in a rebuilding year, they kind of got rid of everybody. They traded Luol, they amnestied me, D-Rose moved on, Joakim moved on, Taj and Jimmy got traded, it’s a whole new team. So it’s tough to see Chicago not at the top. But every team goes through highs and lows. And they have a lot of good, young talent over there that they can build around, maybe they can get a couple of good free agents as well, and have some success pretty soon. But I’m really intrigued by their young talent that they have now. But it’s tough not seeing Chicago in the playoff hunt, not going to be in the playoffs. I’m just so used to them being a winner.\n\nLC: The Bulls got in trouble with the league for sitting healthy players like Robin Lopez and Justin Holiday. Do you have strong feelings about tanking?\n\nBoozer: So I’ve been a part of a team, when I was in Cleveland my rookie year, this is 2002 — I’m dating myself a little bit — but 2002, my rookie year, we had a talented group of guys — myself, Darius Miles, Ricky Davis, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, we were young, Dajuan Wagner, but we were very talented. And then we’d have games, where I would have like 25 points and 15 rebounds, and I wouldn’t play in the fourth quarter. Ricky would have 30 points, wouldn’t play in the fourth quarter because they were trying to lose. And there’s two sides to every coin — the first side is that the guys that are out there competing every day, trying to improve, and for myself, I was a young guy, a rookie that was trying to establish myself in the NBA, so I was at the point at the time of trying to win. That’s a part of my competitive nature, you play to win the game. They would pull us out so that we wouldn’t win the game. The second part of that coin is, we got enough ping-pong balls to actually have the No. 1 pick and draft LeBron James, and obviously that changed the franchise for the next 20 years.\n\nSo there’s two sides to every coin, now when you’re tanking you have the ability to go get a LeBron James or a Kevin Durant or a Kevin Garnett, or someone like Tim Duncan that can change your franchise for the better, for the next 20 years, then that’s something you have to weigh against, you know, not tanking, and being somewhere in the middle of the pack, and you may be, you know, you’re not going to make the playoffs, but you’re not going to be in the lottery, that’s a tough situation to be in. If you have an opportunity, to get a LeBron James where it’s going to change the franchise…you look at Chicago, when they got Derrick Rose, the No. 1 pick in the draft, it changed their franchise back to being a winning team again after, you know, the Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen era. So it’s one of those things that’s a tough decision to make for coaches, for management, but it’s also one of those things that if it works out for you in the right favor, you can have a lot of success…depending on who you pick in the draft.\n\nLC: Judging by your social media accounts, you both are very involved with your kids’ athletics. How do you balance being a professional athlete and a dad at the same time?\n\nBoozer: So my oldest son, Carmani, is 11, and my twin boys Cameron and Cayden are 10, and all three of them play baseball and basketball. But throughout the years, they played soccer, they played football, they played flag football, they ran track, they’ve done pretty much everything. And I let them pick what they want to do, so, they even played hockey one year…I took them to a couple of Blackhawks games while I was in Chicago, and of course they fell in love with the Blackhawks, and I had them right there up against the glass, and they were like, “Dad, I want to play hockey!” And I’m over here like, “How in the world am I going to find a hockey team for you in Miami?” But sure enough, there’s an indoor ice rink in Kendall, which is maybe like 20 minutes south of where I live at, and they learned how to ice skate over there, and they actually had a hockey team, so all three of them made the 10-and-under travel hockey team. So I just put them in everything, I let them pick, but they love baseball and basketball right now. So a lot of stuff you see on my social media will be my boys playing basketball one weekend, and then playing baseball the next weekend.\n\nRobinson: My oldest son Nahmier is 13, we call him Meezy, his nickname, he plays basketball and football and runs track. I have an 11-year-old son, his name is Ny’ale, his nickname is Rico, he plays basketball and soccer. My daughter is eight, her name is Nayvi, we call her Blue, she plays basketball and does theater and dance, and then my son Nasir, he’s two.\n\nI mean, for now, I just want them to want them to be great, I want them to want to work hard, I want them to want to be successful in whatever they want to do. But in sports, I want to show them, lead by example, showing them how to work hard. Because, I explain to my kids, hard work beats talent when talent don’t work hard. And I explain that to my boys, because with them, they’re already naturally gifted, so now it’s about working hard, maintaining that ability, and trying to master your craft, even at a young age. If you can figure out how to be great at what you do now, when it comes time later on in life, it’ll be easier. You’ll know how to maneuver in what you’re trying to figure out or what you’re trying to accomplish in life, or in the sports world. With them, I take them to the gym and we work on our game, we work on our weaknesses, we work on our strengths, and I just try to guide these guys into a way where they have a foundation, where they can always fall back on, and that’s the fundamentals of sports, working hard, and just trying your best, always try to do your best, that’s what I tell my boys. And then have fun. If you’re not having fun while you’re doing it, there’s no reason why you should be doing it.\n\nLC: Being a professional athlete, is it difficult to watch from the sidelines?\n\nBoozer: I enjoy it, I’ll be honest, it’s like the biggest thrill for me, because I wasn’t one of those dads who forced my kids to do something they didn’t want to do. They chose it on their own, and for me, that makes it even more exciting. And also, I have so much knowledge of, you know, even my son playing baseball, like I’m friends with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez, and different guys, Robbie Cano, who are pros, and they give my kids advice too on what to do and how to become better and how to achieve at the highest level, how to have success. So it’s cool for me. Like Nate will talk to my kids. Nate and my oldest son Carmani share the same birthday, so they always call on their birthday, they always FaceTime each other, and he’s always giving him good advice on what to do on the court, and likewise for me with his kids. So I’m like Uncle Booz, and he’s Uncle Nate.\n\nLC: So you guys are set to play both in the Big 3 and the flag football league. Why were those things you wanted to try?\n\nBoozer: So yeah, I talked to Ice Cube and Roger Mason maybe about three or four months ago, and they were trying to recruit me to come. And I was thinking about playing, but I’m retired, happily retired, and just got married, my kids are at a great age where I can watch them enjoy their childhood right now. But I talked to Ice Cube and I talked to some of the players, like Al Harrington, that played in it, and they really had a great experience. It’s pretty much just 10 games and you have playoffs, you know, it’s great exposure, great fun, you get a chance to play again a little bit, not too much on your body. And it’s only half court, it’s the first team to 50. So I told [Nate], “Let’s go ahead and do this thing, man, let’s go play in the Big 3, have some fun this summer,” and he was all in. He got on a good team, and I got on a good team as well, so we’re going to have some fun this summer.\n\nAnd then he brought to me this flag football game, because they’re starting a flag football league with retired NFL players and also NBA athletes, so I’m all in, because I’ve always loved football, it’s one of my favorites, my Philadelphia Eagles won the championship this year, I’ve been a fan since Randall Cunningham when I was eight years old, so this is a long time coming for me and the city of Philadelphia. But yeah, he brought it to me, he’s like would you want to go play flag football? I said, you know what, why not? Let’s do it. So we’ve got a flag football game this summer, but also there’s going to be a league following that for every year after that.\n\nRobinson: Yeah, I know Booz, he probably played football younger, but he probably got too big to play football after a while. But for myself, in the flag football deal, I was like, who’d be better to bring along than Carlos Boozer? You know, a bigger guy, that can be like a tight end, you know, football’s similar to basketball, you can box out, you can jump, you can catch a ball, you run, score a touchdown like scoring a 3-pointer or a layup or a dunk, same thing, it’s just a different game, similar rules, different game. I just want to take him and Matt Barnes, who’s my other teammate in this, and gonna put a group of guys together, and we’re playing in the NFL flag football tournament in July, and hopefully we can go in and show them that we can, you know, basketball athletes are the best athletes on the planet, and we can keep up with the football guys, and hopefully try to steal a win.\n\nAnd the Big 3…they got a couple new guys this next season, it’s going to be pretty fun this year. I think this year will probably be the most views that the Big 3 has ever had with all the players that’s coming in, so I’m excited about the Big 3 and that coming up in July as well. It’s going to be fun, I get to go out and hoop against the guys that I came up playing in the league against, and we still get to play the game at a high level, so I’m really excited about that\n\n(Top photo: Michelle Farsi/NBAE via Getty Images)"
