        "text": "It’s never too early to talk about the future, especially when we’re talking specifically about the future of the NBA.\n\nThis week a handful of top basketball prospects – all of whom will be playing professionally sooner rather than later – will showcase their skills at the Les Schwab Invitational, an annual holiday tournament held at Liberty High School just outside Portland, Oregon. (Nike is also heavily involved in this tournament, which is often a preview of the Nike Hoop Summit.)\n\nThe biggest names making their Les Schwab Invite debut are Cameron and Cayden Boozer, twin sons of former NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer. Both are expected to be lottery picks in the 2026 NBA draft, and their college recruitment has been closely followed by thousands of diehard hoops fans. Will they follow in their dad’s footsteps and head to Duke? Could Kentucky steal them?\n\nAlong with the Boozer twins, other top players to watch include guards Jase Richardson (signed with Michigan State), the son of former NBA Dunk Contest champ Jason Richardson, and Trent Perry (signed with USC), and 2025 forward Koa Peat.\n\nLast year, current Oregon freshman Jackson Shelstad led West Linn, a local powerhouse, to an upset over the nation’s top-ranked high school team, Sierra Canyon (featuring none other than Bronny James). Afterward, West Linn found itself ranked No. 1 in the country by USA TODAY.\n\nThe tournament tipped off Tuesday, though all of the best prospects, who are traveling from out of state with the teams, don’t start play until Wednesday. You can check out the bracket here.\n\nBoozer twins cruise to another lopsided win\n\nCameron Boozer and twin brother Cayden didn't play many minutes Friday night in the semifinals of the Les Schwab Invite, a showcase event just outside of Portland, Oregon. But they didn't need long to make a big impact.\n\nCameron Boozer scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, his third consecutive double-double of the tournament, in just 20 minutes of play, while Cayden added nine points, five assists and a steal in 18 minutes, leading No. 9 Columbus to a 92-73 win over Central Catholic High (Ore.)\n\nJase Richardson also scored 15, snagging eight rebounds and dishing a team-high six assists.\n\nColumbus advances to the LSI championship game.\n\nCameron Boozer tallies another double-double\n\nCameron Boozer recorded another double-double, as the junior forward scored 33 points and grabbed 19 rebounds Thursday evening in Columbus High's 83-54 win over Beaverton (Ore.) High. Twin brother Cayden Boozer tallied 15 points and eight assists, with just two turnovers, in the victory. Jase Richardson chipped in 17 points and eight assists and had no turnovers.\n\nColumbus (Miami) next takes on Central Catholic High of Portland, Oregon, in the semifinals of the showcase event, considered one of the top holiday high school tournaments in the country.\n\nWith Duke watching, Cameron Boozer dominates at high school showcase\n\nCameron Boozer scored 37 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in just 20 minutes of play as Columbus of Miami dominated Lake Oswego High of Lake Oswego, Oregon, 99-36, in the first round of the Les Schwab Invite on Wednesday night.\n\nBoozer scored 12 points in the first quarter, including a pair of dunks in the opening minutes that made the crowd go \"Ooooh!\" Twin brother Cayden had 10 points, six assists and three steals.\n\nDuke assistant Jai Lucas was in attendance to watch the twins, as was their father, former Duke Blue Devil and NBA player Carlos Boozer. Two-time NBA dunk champion Jason Richardson was also in the crowd cheering on his son, Jace, who scored 14 points and grabbed four steals.\n\nColumbus, the No. 9 high school team in the country according to the latest rankings from Sports Illustrated/SBLive, is on a collision course with No. 15 Harvard-Westlake,\n\nWho is Carlos Boozer’s son?\n\nWe’re going to answer this question with another question – which one of his sons are you talking about?\n\nCarlos Boozer has twin boys, Cameron and Cayden, juniors who are slated to graduate from Miami’s Christopher Columbus High School in 2025. They are considered not only two of the top college prospects in the country but two of the top prospects in the 2026 NBA draft class.\n\nAccording to 247Sports.com, the Boozer twins are considering playing college basketball at Duke, Florida, Florida State, Kentucky and Miami, among others.\n\nCam Boozer, lottery pick\n\nOf the Boozer twins, Cameron – who goes by Cam – is the better (and bigger) one. A 6-foot-9, 235-pound power forward, Cam Boozer has been praised by scouts for his ability to score in a variety of ways, both with his back to the basket and facing the rim. The word that comes up most when talking about Cam Boozer is \"polished.\" He’s also known for having good hands; he can catch just about everything.\n\nCam Boozer is a surefire lottery pick for the 2026 NBA Draft, and might go No. 1 overall. He was favored to be the top selection until AJ Dybantsa, also a 6-foot-9 forward, reclassified to the 2025 class. Now it’s likely that either Dybantsa or Cam Boozer goes No. 1\n\nCayden Boozer, also a lottery pick\n\nBut don’t count out Cayden Boozer, the smaller of the Boozer twins. A 6-foot-3, 190-pound guard, Cayden has described himself as \"a versatile point guard who likes to attack.\" He told On3.com that he’s definitely headed to college, and doesn’t need G League money, though that’s another route open to him.\n\nCarlos Boozer’s NBA career\n\nA 2002 NBA draft pick, Carlos Boozer had an impressive professional career after playing at Duke from 1999-2002. Though he wasn’t selected until the second round (No. 35 overall), Boozer had a long NBA lifespan, playing mostly for the Utah Jazz and Chicago Bulls. He was a two-time NBA All-Star, in 2007 and 2008, and averaged 16.2 points, 9.5 rebounds and 2.2 assists over 13 seasons.\n\nBoozer retired from professional basketball in late 2017. He last played professionally with the Guangdong Southern Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association."
