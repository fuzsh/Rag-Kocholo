        "text": "Carlos Boozer is headed to the Lakers’ crowded frontcourt after Los Angeles made the winning bid for the veteran forward waived by the Chicago Bulls via the amnesty clause.\n\nThe Lakers made the highest bid under the NBA’s modified waiver process for players who were amnestied, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Thursday because no official announcement was made.\n\nAccording to NBA rules, teams with room under the salary cap had to bid at least $1.4 million, the amount of the minimum salary for veterans next season. The person did not say how much the Lakers bid, though ESPN.com reported that it was $3.25 million.\n\nThe amnesty clause allows teams to waive one player in the first five years of the current collective bargaining agreement without his salary counting for cap and tax purposes. Boozer will still be paid the $16.8 million he is due next season in the final season of a contract he signed in 2010.\n\nHe will join a Lakers team that has already agreed to deals with fellow power forwards Jordan Hill and Ed Davis during free agency, and drafted Kentucky’s Julius Randle with the No. 7 pick.\n\nBoozer, a two-time All-Star, averaged 15.5 points and nine rebounds in 280 games with the Bulls. His playing time diminished in recent seasons with the emergence of Taj Gibson, and the Bulls needed to clear his salary to sign Pau Gasol and European star Nikola Mirotic."
