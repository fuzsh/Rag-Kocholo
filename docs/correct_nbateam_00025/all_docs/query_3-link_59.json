        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – When LeBron James got to the Cavs, it didn’t take long for Carlos Boozer to see how good he was.\n\n“I was ‘Wow.’ Once practice started we knew right then and there that he was our best player,” Boozer told cleveland.com on Sunday, Oct. 29, the 20th anniversary of James’ NBA debut. “His vision was amazing, he was jumping over players. He was like the new kid at school trying to fit in. He was overpassing. Obviously he wanted to be liked by everyone. … I’ll be honest, once practice happened and we drafted LeBron and we got to play with him every day, we knew he was something special. At least I did.”"
