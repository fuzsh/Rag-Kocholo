        "text": "The smile widened on Carlos Boozer’s face as he thumbed through his cell phone.\n\nHis three sons ‑ Carmani, 8, and 7-year-old twins Cameron and Cayden ‑ stood side-by-side in streams of pictures the Lakers forward has stored on his phone.\n\nHe looks at the photos constantly like any proud parent would, gushing about simple pleasantries such as watching them play on their youth sports teams.\n\nBut the pictures also provide a visual reminder of the pain and uncertainty he felt more than eight years ago.\n\n“It gets me emotional just thinking about it,” Boozer said in an interview with the Los Angeles Newspaper Group. “I didn’t know if I was going to lose my son.”\n\nOn May 31, 2006, Carmani was born with sickle cell anemia, an inherited blood disorder that the Centers for Disease Control said affects more than 70,000 people in the United States. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital also said about 1 in 500 African-Americans are born with the disease.\n\nBut eight years after spending nearly $2 million on treatment, Boozer said Carmani feels “completely healthy.”\n\nThe 12-year NBA veteran knows this was possible because of his income. The Chicago Bulls will pay him $13.6 million this season after waiving him this offseason through the amnesty provision. The Lakers owe him $3.25 for the 2014-15 season after picking him up off the waiver wire.\n\nOthers are not as fortunate.\n\nThat is why Boozer will host 30 guests in a luxury suite when the Clippers (17-7) play the Indiana Pacers (8-17) tonight at Staples Center. The guests will donate $500 each to fund St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital’s sickle cell disease bone marrow transplant program.\n\n“There is a whole community out there of people and families that are dealing with the same problem I dealt with my family,” Boozer said. “I was lucky enough to have the money (for treatment). There’s a lot of people going through similar things and they don’t have the funding for it.”\n\nBoozer carried the gene that causes sickle cell anemia, but it wasn’t until his ex-wife, CeCe, gave birth to Carmani that they realized this could mark a death sentence.\n\nAccording to St. Jude’s Research Hospital, the disease causes the body to make sickle-shaped red blood cells that can produce deadly side effects. It can stop blood flow, cause organ damage and raise the risk of infection.\n\n“The thought of me losing my son, what do I do?” Boozer said. “Do I put my kid through a life full of torture where he will have a seizure at any given time? Or he may he lose his life? Or maybe he loses an organ and has a difficult life? Or do I roll the dice?”\n\nBoozer and CeCe chose the latter.\n\nThey paid for a bone marrow transplant and in vitro fertilization that produced two healthy embryos. Once CeCe gave birth to her twin sons on July 17, 2007, Cameron’s umbilical cord was frozen and used for the bone marrow transplant to treat his older brother.\n\nCarmani only has one yearly checkup, a number that dwindled from five to two in recent years. But Carmani initially spent 40 consecutive days at Miami Children’s Hospital, something that left Boozer trembling as he retold the experience.\n\n“I remember it like it was yesterday, just seeing him lose his hair and seeing him cry,” Boozer said. “The fear was with us every day. We didn’t know if this was going to work.”\n\nIt did, but it often produced sleepless nights.\n\nBoozer and CeCe alternated shifts seeing Carmani at the hospital during the summer of 2006. While CeCe stayed from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Boozer would work out and then visit overnight from 7 p.m. to 9 a.m.\n\nThe logistics became more complicated once Boozer moved back to Salt Lake City for the 2006-07 season with the Utah Jazz. Doctors informed Boozer that Carmani could not live in Salt Lake City because its altitude would produce lethal side effects.\n\nBoozer praised CeCe, calling his ex-wife “a trooper” for taking care of his children back in Miami and running his former foundation titled Boozer Buddies, which funded treatment for a family every year and provided grants to non-profits devoted to sickle cell research.\n\nBoozer also expressed gratitude for Jazz owner Larry Miller, former coach Jerry Sloan and his teammates for showing support and granting him occasional leaves of absence to see Carmani. But Boozer understandably called that year “stressful.”\n\n“It was an unbelievable season,” Boozer said. “We take basketball so seriously and this livelihood is so serious. Then something like this happens in your life. Then you realize what’s really important.”\n\nBoozer channeled that anxiety into averaging 20.9 points on 56.1 percent shooting and 11.7 rebounds per game en route to one of his two career All-Star appearances.\n\nHe has not fared as well with the Lakers. Though Boozer has averaged 13 points on 50.7 percent shooting, Lakers coach Byron Scott recently demoted him to the bench amid criticism over his defense.\n\nBoozer publicly admitted last week he disagreed with Scott’s move. But later that day, Boozer noted the insignificance of that development relative to his off-court hardships.\n\n“The first thing I do when I wake up is I thank God I have my kids and my family,” Boozer said. “I thank God I’m here today. When you see the possibility of losing your first born, it makes you appreciate life so much more. You don’t take any day for granted.”\n\nThat explains Boozer’s thought process on a number of fronts.\n\nHe plans to launch another foundation similar to Boozer’s Buddies, considering it shut down after he and CeCe divorced. Though they have remained apart the past two years, Boozer said his divorce with CeCe hasn’t affected his relationship with his children or the frequency with which he visits them.\n\nBoozer also spends his offseason at his home in Miami with his three sons.\n\nHe described his children as “best friends,” and noted the varying favorite sports among Carmani (basketball, football), Cameron (ice hockey) and Cayden (baseball). Boozer also showed his sons an ESPN documentary highlighting their story, which he says sparked the children to have more appreciation for each other.\n\n“I do whatever I can to be with them,” Boozer said. “Those were days I may not have had. But God blessed me to have them. I don’t want to miss out.”\n\nBoozer then thumbed through his phone again and looked at some more photos. His smile widened some more."
