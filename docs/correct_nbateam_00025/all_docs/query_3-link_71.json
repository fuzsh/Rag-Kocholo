        "text": "Whom do you trust?\n\nCarlos Boozer, who is making a bigger name for himself by shopping his services than he ever made as a basketball player, claims he never had a handshake deal to remain in Cleveland with the Cavaliers.\n\nTeam owner Gordon Gund says otherwise, that Boozer is backing out on an agreement. “He and his agent made it very clear that if we respected them, and provided the security he was looking to gain, he would respect us.”\n\nThat chain of respect was broken when Boozer bolted the Cavs to accept an offer of $68 million over six years from the Utah Jazz. Gund could have kept Boozer in Cleveland for at least a year for just under $700,000, with no long-term assurance he would stay.\n\nBut according to the team owner, Boozer and his wife wanted immediate financial security. So Gund told him, in effect, to sit tight and he would pay him $5 million next year as part of a $41 million deal over six years.\n\nThe average person cannot even comprehend those numbers.\n\nBoozer as much as said that the conversation with Gund never took place.\n\nThe facts are so entangled and there are so many nuances involved in National Basketball Association contracts that the reader would be best advised to read the details in the sports pages, where our talented sportswriters can explain them in depth. For this purpose, however, we will return to our original question: In a showdown of values between the team owner and one of his basketball players, when the answer boils down to a multi-million dollar matter of truth or disdain for the truth, “Whom do you trust?”\n\nWe’ll put our money on the owner.\n\nGund has always been known as a truthful person.\n\nIn fact, in some respects, when Boozer’s contention is examined closely, it doesn’t even make sense."
