        "text": "A member of Duke’s 2001 NCAA Championship team, Carlos Boozer was a late draft pick in 2002 (35th overall) and played for the Cleveland Cavaliers for two years before a free agent controversy saw him bolt for the Utah Jazz (allegedly the Cavs released him making him a conditional free agent so that they could sign him back to a larger deal, which allowed him to sign with Utah for more money; Boozer said he never agreed to that with Cleveland) and it was in Salt Lake that his star rose. Boozer would be a two time All Star with Utah and also a Third Team All-NBA Selection and in his six seasons as a member of the Jazz he averaged a healthy 19.3 Points and 10.5 Rebounds per Game. It should be mentioned that during this time he helped the United States win the 2008 Olympics Gold Medal."
