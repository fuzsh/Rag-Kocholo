        "text": "The Lakers’ once-barren roster suddenly has become loaded with frontcourt players. The latest move entailed Wednesday’s winning bid to pick up former Bulls forward Carlos Boozer, according to a league source familiar with the situation.\n\nThe Bulls waived Boozer this week through the so-called amnesty provision, which requires the team to still pay the $16.8 million left on his remaining contract, albeit without the money counting against the team’s salary cap. The Lakers’ bid price, believed to be at $3.2 million, offsets the balance that the Bulls still owe the 12-year NBA veteran.\n\n“Carlos is an established veteran and a proven all-star, who will be a welcome addition to our team,” Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said in a statement. “We’re very pleased to have won the bidding process and to have gained his rights, and look forward to his contributions next season.”\n\nThe Lakers opted to pick Boozer up this way instead of including him in a sign-and-trade to facilitate Pau Gasol’s defection to Chicago because of the obvious price difference. But the NBA’s current labor deal prohibits players picked up through an amnesty claim, such as Boozer, to be traded at any point during the season. Still, the Lakers believed the monetary savings trumped that factor.\n\nBoozer averaged 13.7 points and 8.3 rebounds through 76 appearances with the Bulls, but he faced reduced playing time amid concerns about his defense. Whoever the Lakers hire as their next head coach will also have to figure out how to assort the team’s crowded frontcourt. Such options will include seventh overall pick Julius Randle and Ed Davis, whom the Lakers reportedly agreed to terms this week believed on a two-year deal. The Lakers also have Jordan Hill and Robert Sacre, both of whom will play at center. The Lakers also hope to re-sign Ryan Kelly, who was given a $1.1 million qualiying offer to make him a restricted free agent.\n\nAt Peace\n\nMetta World Peace was back in Los Angeles on Wednesday for the 2014 ESPY awards, eager to share a litany of laughs. That included his explanation for the Lakers finishing 27-55 last season.\n\n“Sometimes you have to go to sleep and take a break,” said World Peace, whom the Lakers waived in 2013 through the amnesty provision. “They’re like a sleeping bear. They’ll wake up out of hibernation and then get back on top.”\n\nLots of that hinges on Kobe Bryant, who played in six games last season amid injuries to his left Achilles tendon and left knee.\n\n“He told me he’s going to come back and carry the team. I believe him,” said World Peace, who helped the Lakers to an NBA title in 2010. “If he wants something that bad, he can get it.”\n\nA source familiar with World Peace’s thinking said he would love playing with the Lakers, Clippers or Knicks, who waived him last season through a buyout. But there is a sense that if the Lakers have had contact with World Peace’s representatives, those discussions currently have not advanced beyond anything preliminary. World Peace added teams from China, Russia and Turkey are also interested.\n\n“I’m not retiring from basketball because I’m in great shape,” said World Peace, who said he has healed from a right knee injury that hampered him last season. “There’s a couple of teams that we might be looking at. But they’re trying to find guys they believe can help them win a championship. They might be looking in the wrong direction. There’s no better direction than picking up me.”"
