        "text": "I am nostalgic for the 2003–10 Cleveland Cavaliers, and I do not understand why. Five trips to the postseason, the team never won one NBA Finals game. They underachieved, considering they employed the best NBA player from the 2007 playoffs on (I would argue from 2005–06 on). They overachieved, considering the roster talent they placed around him. They broke my heart.\n\nSame time, they made me love the sport. They gave me something to do, entertainment to consume, and people to talk to. In upstate New York, I listened to Joe Tait call games on WTAM 1100. I yelled with Mike Snyder at a postgame caller who suggested Cleveland would be up 2–0, rather than down 0–2, if Michael Jordan was their star, rather than LeBron James, after Game 2 of the 2007 Eastern Conference Finals vs. Detroit. (I don’t recall hearing from that caller after Game 5.) I spent my free time on the old Cavs.com message boards, chatting Cavaliers, baseball, and standard bullshit. I stayed up all night before the 2008 trade deadline, after reporter Brian Windhorst suggested a big move may be on the horizon. (The Cavaliers completed a mega-deal the following afternoon, injecting new life into a talent-deficient roster and energy into a fan base that craved something different.)\n\nI have thought about this era of Cavaliers basketball a lot lately, zigging while many others on Cavs/NBA Twitter zag toward the 2016 championship. Coming up on 10 years from “The Decision,” I have studied the LeBron 1.0 Cleveland Cavaliers, careful not to apply 2020 NBA sensibilities to rosters constructed one or two decades prior. The obvious failure is that the Cavaliers failed to surround James with adequate supporting talent. The best team of the era, the 66-win 2008–09 Cleveland Cavaliers, succeeded on fit more so than talent. To understand why these Cavaliers could never get over the hump — in an era before the inevitability of certain champions — you have to start before the Cavaliers even drafted James. Before “The Decision,” there were bad decisions, reasonable decisions that did not turn out, and bad luck.\n\nThese are the ways the Cleveland Cavaliers failed LeBron James 1.0.\n\nThe Cavaliers were poor, unlucky drafters, and in the instances they hit, they were not committed to that talent maturing there. This mattered later on, as the Cavaliers lacked talented young players to grow with James and/or to trade for stars that became available.\n\nIn 2007, the summer after the Cavaliers advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time, the Boston Celtics — who finished 24–58 the season prior — formed a “superteam” and passed them in the Eastern Conference hierarchy. This was supposed to be Cleveland’s time, with James headed into his fifth NBA season, and the Cavaliers having overcome the Detroit Pistons — who’d been to five consecutive conference finals — the postseason prior. Though roundly beaten by the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals, James had announced himself in the Detroit series, specifically a Game 5 road win. Rather than progress, the 2007–08 Cavaliers regressed, finishing with five fewer regular season wins than the two years prior and a negative net rating. Boston, meanwhile, acquired two stars and won a championship their first year together. The moves were made possible because Boston had assets, mostly young players, that other teams wanted. Besides James, the Cavaliers had failed here.\n\nJim Paxson, the villain of this story, was the Cavaliers’ general manager from 1999 to 2005. Between 1999 and 2003, there were draft hits: Andre Miller in ’99, Jamal Crawford (swapped for Chris Mihm, later traded for Tony Battie, later traded for Drew Gooden and Anderson Varejão) in 2000, Carlos Boozer (more on him later) in ’02, and James in ’03. Add Zydrunas Ilgauskas, a ’96 Cavaliers draftee and two-time NBA All Star (’03, ’05), and that’s a playoff-caliber five immediately. Of course, with a 2002–03 roster that talented, the Cavaliers probably are not 17–65 and in position to draft James No. 1.\n\nThat was part of the rationale for trading Miller after three seasons, the rest being Cleveland was wary of paying the man what he was due. Miller, the No. 8 pick in 1999, averaged 17 points and 11 assists in 2001–02. (Ironically, it was Denver — eager to build around star rookie forward Carmelo Anthony — who gave Miller the pay day he was seeking in 2003.) In trading Miller, the Cavaliers received no long-term assets.\n\nIf not for bad luck and managerial incompetence, the Cavaliers’ 2002 draft class could have been a significant moment in franchise history, delivering the team two above-average or star players to develop alongside James. Cleveland selected Dajuan Wagner at No. 6 and Boozer at No. 35. Despite promising moments, Wagner played merely 102 games with Cleveland in three seasons, his career ended by colitis, a non-basketball-related condition. Boozer, a Round 2 hit, played only two seasons with the Cavaliers, averaging 16 points and 11 rebounds in 75 starts his second year there.\n\nThough Boozer’s departure drew the forward, rather than the Cavaliers’ front office and ownership, contempt from fans for years to come, it was 100% facilitated by the team’s foolishness. The Cavaliers controlled Boozer for one more season at less than $700,000. They could have very easily exercised the team option, let Boozer and LeBron grow another season together, and revisited a long-term deal when the team opened up ample cap space the following summer. Instead, the Cavaliers let him out of the contract, hoping to agree on a long-term deal that summer; Boozer signed with Utah for about $30 million more than the Cavaliers could offer. Handshake deal or no, the Cavaliers could not possibly expect Boozer to decline an extra $30 million. In watching Boozer walk, the Cavaliers received no long-term assets.\n\nThe first seven years of James’ career, the Cavaliers acquired two helpful players in the draft: Daniel Gibson, drafted No. 42 in 2006, and J.J. Hickson (he was fine), No. 19 in 2008. In 2004, Cleveland spent a top 10 pick on Luke Jackson, who played less than 50 games with the team; Wagner and Jackson played a combined 148 games for the Cavaliers; by comparison, Collin Sexton has played 147 NBA games and Anthony Bennett 151. (Prior to James, they had selected DeSagana Diop No. 8 in 2001. He started 5 games in four seasons there.) The Cavaliers did not have first-round picks in 2005 nor 2007, having traded the former in a 1997 deal for Wesley Person, who never played with James, and the latter in a 2005 deadline deal for Jiří Welsch. If my math is correct, Welsch scored fewer than 50 points for the Cavaliers in 16 games. (The ’04–05 Cavaliers were 31–21 upon acquiring Welsch; they lost their next six games, missed the playoffs, and ownership, front office, and head coach all changed over prior to the ’05–06 season.)\n\nEarly in James’ career, Cleveland should have been active in every trade discussion for star supporting talent, but — after years of wasted draft selections (this point specifically has been made by Windhorst on ESPN’s “Hoop Collective” podcast) and Danny Ferry’s summer 2005 spending spree (more later) — they lacked assets of value to deal. Too early on, Cleveland was relegated to making moves on the margins. In 2007–08, Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett were traded to Boston; they beat Cleveland in the playoffs twice and won one championship. Rashard Lewis was sign-and-traded to Orlando; the Magic beat* (the lifers will get the asterisk) the Cavaliers in the playoffs once to advance to an NBA Finals. Pau Gasol was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won two championships. Jason Kidd was traded to Dallas; the Mavericks, with Kidd, beat James’ Miami Heat to win the 2011 Finals.\n\nThe Celtics’ acquisitions are the most notable to me here, them being the “superteam” that most frequently foiled James’ Cavaliers and ultimately sent him to Miami, in search of better teammates. Similar to Cleveland pre-James, the Celtics were in a rut, having missed the postseason three of the prior four years. Unlike Cleveland, they drafted and developed. Boston drafted Delonte West No. 24 in 2004 and turned him into a fringe starter. They hit on Al Jefferson, the centerpiece of the Garnett trade, at No. 15 in ’04. They found a scorer, Ryan Gomes, way down at No. 50 in ’05. Gerald Green, No. 18 in ’05, was an outstanding athlete with shooting ability. Best of all, they leveraged Phoenix’s unwillingness to spend (and, clenches fists, the ’07 first acquired in the Welsch trade) into Rajon Rondo, No. 21 in ’06.\n\nBoston kept its picks, present and future, and drafted moderately well in less-than-ideal spots — a path to success readily available to every franchise. Their best selection of the period, No. 5 in 2007, was sent to Seattle with West and Wally Szczerbiak (acquired from Minnesota in a trade involving Ricky Davis, the former Cavalier) for Allen. Jefferson, Gomes, Green, future picks, and other filler were traded to Minnesota for Garnett. Like that, Boston had acquired two championship-starved stars while keeping Rondo.\n\nWith the clock ticking on LeBron James 1.0, the Cavaliers allowed an Eastern Conference opponent to pass them by.\n\nIn 2005 free agency, the Cavaliers went all in on the wrong player, valuing upside and youth above fit. Larry Hughes was a good player coming off a good season, and projecting forward, maybe the best player available that summer. But he was not the right player for that team.\n\nThe most important summer of James’ seven years in Cleveland, the organization was undergoing change at all levels. Dan Gilbert purchased the team from Gordon Gund prior to the conclusion 2004–05 season. Gilbert initially sought to hire a general manager prior to a coach, but reversed course and hired Mike Brown, boasting his championship pedigree and defensive focus. Gilbert, the Detroit man, flirted with hiring Pistons coach Larry Brown to lead the front office, but the team introduced Danny Ferry, another Spur, as general manager days prior to free agency. Headed into its most important free agency period of the decade, the Cavaliers were not blessed with organizational stability nor a lot of preparation time.\n\nNevertheless, the Cavaliers had money — lots of money, by 2005 cap standards — and they had a star. Per The New York Times, the Cavaliers were one of six teams with cap flexibility, having only $21 million of a $49 million salary cap committed for the ’05–06 season. “The biggest buyer on the market will likely be Cleveland,” previewed the Times’ Liz Robbins. “With new ownership and Danny Ferry as the recently installed general manager, the Cavaliers are under pressure to provide the right pieces around LeBron James to keep him happy.” (James could have become a restricted free agent as early as 2007. He signed a three-year extension in summer 2006, putting himself in position to sign for 30% of the cap as a seven-year player in 2010.)\n\nThe Cavaliers’ No. 1 priority in free agency was to find James a running mate. To put the 2004–05 team in perspective, Jeff McInnis was second in minutes; Robert Traylor, who never played in the NBA again, was seventh; and Ira Newble started 69 games (not nice). The top-level wing talent pool in free agency was not deep, but there were notable names: Allen, Michael Redd, Hughes, and Joe Johnson (restricted). Writing for the New York Sun, John Hollinger ranked all four in his free agent “A” list, with Hughes — and his 21.6 player efficiency rating the season prior in Washington — No. 1.\n\nIt’s important to remember the Cavaliers’ positioning here. The “Robin” pickings were slim. Johnson would ultimately net his incumbent team, Phoenix, draft capital in a sign-and-trade Cleveland could not easily part with, because of preexisting obligations and a league-imposed restriction on trading first-round picks in consecutive years. Redd and Allen were financially incentivized to return to their current teams. Still, Cleveland had substantial room to operate under the cap and a young superstar, still on a rookie deal that would pay him under $6 million per season through 2006–07; in theory, the time to leverage the space was now, while it existed.\n\nWith Allen, 30, re-signing with Seattle, the Cavaliers’ choices were effectively Hughes or Redd. Hughes was coming off a career-best year (22 PPG, 6.3 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 2.9 steals) and entering his age-27 season, a timeline Ferry thought coincided well with the 20-year-old James. His defensive chops — first-team All-Defense and league-leader in steals — no doubt appealed to Brown. Back when positions mattered, he filled a position of need, SG. Still, the warning signs were there. He shot 43% from the field in 2004–05 and sub-40%, on 16.5 attempts per game, the season before that. (In covering the anatomy of the deal, Sports Illustrated’s Ian Thomsen reported that Cleveland fans asked Hughes about his shooting percentages in Washington.) Though Cleveland had not yet acquired the personnel to surround him with shooters, it was understood outside threats would pair well with James’ passing brilliance. In recapping Redd’s free agency, Hollinger wrote, “This ace shooter would have been lethal paired with LeBron James ….” Hughes, by contrast, shot 28% on 3s in ’04–05. Hughes, who struggled with injury throughout his two-plus years in Cleveland too, last played 75+ games in 1999–00. “[H]e’s not a perfect fit in Cleveland,” wrote ESPN’s Chad Ford in breaking the deal. “Hughes is not a good 3-point shooter (a big need for the Cavs), has a history of injuries and has been inconsistent throughout his career.” Ferry signed Hughes to a five-year, $70 million deal; Cleveland would be Hughes’ fourth team in eight seasons.\n\nRedd and Allen each seemed like a better fit, at the time and in hindsight. Ferry viewed Allen — who, again, may not have been an option for Cleveland — as a less-than-ideal co-star for James because of age; Allen averaged career-highs in points the next two years in Seattle, won a championship in Boston (beating Cavaliers in playoffs twice), and teamed with James to win a championship in Miami in 2012–13, after Hughes was out of the NBA. Redd, a Columbus, Ohio, native and former Buckeye, was probably a more realistic target for Ferry. Milwaukee could, and did, offer substantially more money, yet Redd took a visit with Cleveland regardless. Redd, entering his age-26 season, had averaged 20+ PPG the two seasons prior, never shot below 35% from 3, and had appeared in 75+ games for three consecutive seasons (full disclosure, injuries would be a factor after 2005–06). Nevertheless, per Thomsen’s reporting, Ferry informed Redd at the meeting he was moving forward in another direction, prompting him to re-sign with Milwaukee. Redd finished a career-best ’05–06 season with 25+ PPG on 45% FG, 40% 3P, leading the Bucks to a 10-win improvement and the playoffs.\n\nSummer 2005, the Cavaliers also re-signed Ilgauskas (5 years, $52 million) and signed floor-spacers Donyell Marshall (4 years, $21 million) and Damon Jones (4 years, $16 million). Z was a justifiable overpay in a slim market; he was coming off two All-Star seasons in three years, checked boxes on both ends for Cavalier teams limited in supporting talent, and had built up equity for his doggedness in returning from injury. He played an important role for the next four seasons, and was valuable in the fifth in returning Antawn Jamison via trade prior to re-signing. Marshall and Jones had moments but were mostly forgettable signings. (My favorite fan nickname from the era was “Amon Ones,” for Damon Jones, minus the “D” and the “J.” In fairness, Jones was 38% or better on 3s each of his three seasons in Cleveland. Marshall, meanwhile, was 32% from 3 in 2005–06, on five attempts per game, after shooting above 40% the prior two seasons.) It’s as if Ferry overcompensated here for going slasher over shooter in signing Hughes, knowing full well he needed to address Cleveland’s shooting woes from the year prior — No. 28 in 3P makes, No. 27 in 3P attempts and percentage. Like Hughes and Z, Jones and Marshall were traded in the course of their contracts.\n\nThis piece, of course, is baked in revisionist history, and I try to be mindful of that. The Cavaliers were under immense pressure to sign James’ “Pippen,” and it’s hard to see through the posturing and rumor mill to determine whether Redd really could’ve been theirs. (Milwaukee offered more money, familiarity, and rookie No. 1 selection Andrew Bogut.) Once you got past Hughes, the wing options were role players who may or may not have been available to the Cavaliers— Bobby Simmons, most improved in 2005 but a decline thereafter; Latrell Sprewell, never played again; Michael Finley, 32, choosing among contenders; Cuttino Mobley, entering his age-30 season. (Raja Bell, who signed for well under half of Hughes’ money in Phoenix, may have been the best fit, given his shooting, defense, and spirit.)\n\nA lot of Hughes’ struggles the first year could be attributed to factors outside his control. Cleveland ripped off eight consecutive wins early, including a 123–120 win at Philadelphia where Hughes and James combined for 73 points. Through 28 games, Hughes was averaging 16 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists, and the Cavaliers were 18–10. Hughes, though, required surgery on a broken finger and would miss three months, returning in April. Hughes missed four of Cleveland’s 13 postseason games after the death of his brother, 20-year-old Justin Hughes. Up 3–2 vs. Detroit in the conference semifinals, Cleveland’s shooting and non-James scoring woes were front and center. In a potential Game 6 clincher at home, Cleveland’s guards scored 6 points, total (Ronald Murray, 4; Eric Snow, 2; Jones, 0; Hughes, DNP). They lost by two points. In Games 6 and 7 combined, Cleveland shot 3–24 from 3.\n\nThe most appropriate criticism of Hughes — not scoring enough nor efficiently — dovetailed with the team’s most persistent weakness, its offense. Hughes’ numbers for the 2006–07 season — 15 points (40% FG, 33% 3P), 4 assists, 4 rebounds, 70 games played — were underwhelming for a No. 2. So were the advanced statistics — No. 7 on the team in PER the first two seasons (14.0, 12.1), No. 11 the first year and No. 10 the second in true shooting, No. 8 in win shares the first year, No. 5 the second. Hughes surely wasn’t helped by backcourt mate Snow, a non-threat (he attempted four field goals per game and four 3s total in 2006–07), or a defense-first coach. Brown, to his credit, toyed with starting combinations later in the year before settling on Sasha Pavlović in Snow’s place and Hughes at the nominal point. The move coincided with Cleveland’s best stretch of the season, at just the right time; the Cavaliers won eight straight in March and finished 17–7 in their last 24. Hughes scored 27 points on over 50% shooting in a Game 1 win over the Wizards and double figures the next 7 games before his postseason started to fall apart. He shot 3-of-17 in a possible closeout game vs. New Jersey, his second 3-of-17 playoff game in two seasons. He missed a bunny to win a conference finals game at Detroit. He played through a debilitating foot injury until missing Games 3 and 4 of the NBA Finals. He logged 44 minutes total in the Finals, when Cleveland desperately needed perimeter defense to contain Tony Parker drives; Parker got to the rim regularly and won Finals MVP.\n\nHughes’ minutes and production dipped further in 2007–08, as the team similarly regressed. It now seemed likely Hughes would be moved if his contract would allow it. After a December 23 home loss to Golden State, beat writer Branson Wright — effectively concealing any and all holiday spirit — reported, “The best news to come out of Sunday’s debacle is that the Cavs are seeking to trade Larry Hughes, according to league sources.” Hughes came off the bench, shot 1/8, and finished with 2 points and a game-worst -23. That season, Hughes missed stretches in November and December. He finished in single-digit scoring in over half his 40 games as a Cavalier. (He did run off a stretch of 10 consecutive games in double figures immediately before being traded to Chicago, including a 40-point performance at Orlando. There, Hughes and James combined for 69 of the Cavaliers’ 118 points, on an efficient 20/34 FGs, in beating an Eastern Conference contender.)\n\nThe flashes from Hughes were too infrequent, the games missed too frequent, and the fit the rest of the time too clunky. Instead of 2007–08 being a leap year to true contention, after Cleveland overachieved in beating an unsuspecting Pistons team the year prior, the Cavaliers were stale. Ferry turned a significant portion of the roster over at the deadline. With two-and-a-half guaranteed LeBron years left, the Cavaliers required an overhaul.\n\nCleveland, years behind in the asset game, started to reconstruct its roster in the bridge 2007–08 season before taking off in 2008–09. Rather than shoehorn best available player into the role of James’ co-star, as the team tried with Hughes, the Cavaliers thrived on fit.\n\nIn roster maneuverability, the Hughes contract set the Cavaliers back — the opportunity cost being the players they could have signed in 2005 and/or cap flexibility they could have pushed into subsequent years. Though Cleveland was able to trade Hughes, doing so required taking in a post-prime, post-pay day Ben Wallace, who signed in 2006 for 4 years, about $60 million. In other words, the Hughes money was to be tied up in an underachieving player. In that same transaction — which also involved shipping out Gooden, Marshall, Newble, and 2006 first-round selection Shannon Brown — Ferry acquired players who seemed to offer something the team needed. Wally Szczerbiak, plus-40% from 3 in five of the previous six seasons, made an All-Star team playing off superstar Garnett in Minnesota. Delonte West, a combo guard, could do a little bit of everything. Joe Smith, a former No. 1 overall selection, was a more versatile fourth big, an instant upgrade on Marshall. Szczerbiak, Wallace, and West each started all 13 of Cleveland’s playoff games.\n\nThe best I can recall, as early as the 2007 series vs. New Jersey, the Cavaliers were most successful offensively with LeBron-plus-shooters lineups. In a closeout Game 6 on the road, the Cavaliers blitzed the Nets 27–12 in the fourth, 18 points coming from 3, with mostly a James-Gibson-Jones-Marshall-Varejão five. Though Cleveland struggled mightily scoring vs. Boston in the 2008 conference semifinals (they cleared 90 points in two of seven games), NBA.com advanced lineup statistics corroborate Cleveland scored efficiently with three- and four-player groups consisting of James and shooters.\n\n(As a brief aside, the Cavaliers’ offensive woes throughout Brown’s early years made the timing of January 2008 contract extension, not immediately after a surprise trip to the Finals but rather several months later when the Cavaliers were a below-expectations 19–18 and near the bottom of the NBA in scoring, funny. I remember many fans on message boards clamoring for a change.)\n\nThe Cavaliers’ leap year was 2008–09, jumping from 45 to 66 wins. Prior to the season, they traded for Maurice Williams, losing only Smith (he would return after a buyout) and Jones. Williams was a terrific fit next to James, a non-traditional PG who played well off ball and could create his own offense. (In many ways, Williams, a 2016 NBA champion, foreshadowed how well James and Kyrie Irving, a player substantially more skilled than Williams, would coexist.) That season, Williams averaged 17.8 PPG (47% FGs, 44% 3P), 4.1 assists; Williams was the first teammate of James’ career to average over 17. He made the All-Star team as an injury replacement, James’ first All-Star teammate since 2005. West, the starting SG, converted a career-high 40% of his 3s, and “Boobie” Gibson, in a more suitable role of bench player, shot 38% on four attempts per game. The Cavaliers finished No. 5 in 3P attempts and makes, and No. 2 in percentage — categories where they finished Nos. 13, 14, and 15, the year prior. That season, Brown had appointed an offensive coordinator, John Kuester. Cleveland was still about league-average (No. 13) in points per game, but because they ground games to a halt (No. 25 in pace). The Cavaliers were No. 4 in offensive rating, averaging 112.4 points per 100 possessions. The LeBron 1.0 Cavaliers always had an identity — James being great and secondarily team defense — but now, in the sixth year, the whole exceeded the sum of the parts. They were a team. They blew opponents out, were dominant at home (39–2, with one of the losses a meaningless overtime one on the season’s final day), and were very outwardly having fun with it.\n\nUnfortunately, the Cavaliers’ supporting players were not good enough in the conference finals, and the team lost to Orlando in 6. In a one-point Game 1 loss at home, Cleveland surrendered a Lewis three up two in the final seconds, after just having fouled out Dwight Howard. Williams shot 6/19 in that loss, and 5/15 in a 2-point overtime loss in Game 4. Cleveland’s bench was outscored by Mickaël Piétrus, by himself, in Games 1, 3, 4, and 6, Orlando’s four wins. For the postseason, James posted a 37.4 PER, the second-highest playoff PER in NBA history (Hakeem Olajuwon, 38.96, 1988, 4 games); no other Cavalier posted a PER over the league-average 15.\n\nThe most talented team of the era, the 61-win 2009–10 Cavaliers, had the right names at the wrong points of their careers. The Cavaliers traded for Shaquille O’Neal, a body to throw at Howard in the playoffs. (In Cleveland’s first game vs. Orlando that season, a Nov. 11 road win, Howard was limited by fouls and scored only 11 points in 32 minutes.) The O’Neal trade created an awkward fit with mainstay Ilgauskas, who was moved to the bench. Williams’ numbers dipped, West’s numbers dipped as he was benched for Anthony Parker, and by the playoffs Gibson was about excised from the rotation. Still, on a strictly points-per-game basis (No. 9), it was the best offense of Brown’s tenure. (Michael Malone was the team’s new offensive coordinator, after Kuester accepted the head coach job in Detroit.) The “win now” pressure all the way up, Ferry executed a win-now deadline move for Jamison, who — like James’ prior year teammates — struggled in some big moments. Jamison shot 26% on 3s in 11 playoff games, and finished in single-figure scoring three of six games vs. Boston, including Games 5 and 6. Asked to do about everything seven years in, James demonstrated a passiveness at moments indicative of a player who recognized his team was not good enough.\n\nAs James walked into the tunnel after the closeout Game 6 loss, I think a lot of fans knew it was over, this time. I figured it out after Game 5, when the Cavaliers were ran off their home floor, losing the 2nd half 70–44. (I listened to Game 6 on a long drive home from college for summer recess, unaffected.) Game 5 was the second time they were blown out on their home floor that series, having lost the 3rd quarter 31–12 en route to a 104–86 loss in Game 2. (They were quite possibly on their way to losing comfortably in Game 1 too, if not for a momentum-shifting Williams dunk over Paul Pierce.)\n\n***\n\nI am no NBA front office man — though I may sometimes be tempted to play one on Twitter — but history tells us there is no one approach to team-building around a superstar. Some teams were extremely fortunate with a run on draft hits (Oklahoma City), a run on draft hits plus team-friendly contracts (Golden State), having championship pedigree and longevity (San Antonio), or having championship culture in a desirable market (Miami). Teams in similar situations to Cleveland (no such fortune; small, non-glamour market) have tried different approaches in the past two decades, but to now have attained no greater success. Turns out the key to such team-building is being extremely competent at all times! Denver aggressively sought big-name supporting talent to pair with Anthony (Miller, Kenyon Martin, Allen Iverson, Chauncey Billups), and made it out of the first-round once. New Orleans had a co-star, David West, when they drafted Chris Paul and tried to plug roster holes (Tyson Chandler, Peja Stojaković, Morris Peterson); they never made it to the conference finals. The Pelicans generated 5 playoff wins in 7 seasons of Anthony Davis. Milwaukee has recently drawn comparisons to Cleveland’s 2008–09 team, in the way they’ve constructed a roster suited to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s strengths (better supporting talent).\n\nJames’ brilliance erased a lot of Cleveland’s deficiencies — of its supporting players and in its team-building, under Paxson and Ferry. Had the Cavaliers won the championship in 2008–09, or for that matter any year of LeBron 1.0 (they came the closest to beating the Celtics of any team in the 2007–08 playoffs, with an Ilgauskas-Wallace starting frontcourt), I would probably be here holding it up as the single greatest individual performance in a team sport ever, or certainly of my lifetime. Of course, that goes back to where this whole experiment failed, in that Cleveland needed James to be superhuman, above and beyond the best player on the floor, to win.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2010, the Cleveland Cavaliers failed LeBron James."
