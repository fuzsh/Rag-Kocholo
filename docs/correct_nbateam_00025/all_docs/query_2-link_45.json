        "text": "Editor’s Note: This story is the final installment of our four-part series highlighting Carlos Boozer and his book – Every Shot Counts: A Memoir of Resilience. Published by HarperCollins, the book was released Oct. 3 and can be found in hardcover, e-book and audiobook versions. The Fayetteville Observer/USA TODAY Network will highlight key moments from Boozer’s journey, from his time with Coach K and Duke basketball to life off the court.\n\nDuke basketball legend Carlos Boozer has two chapters in his new book – “Every Shot Counts: A Memoir of Resilience\" – dedicated to his four children.\n\nCarmani, Cameron and Cayden – Boozer’s sons – are highlighted in an earlier chapter and Bloom, Boozer’s daughter, gets the final chapter of his memoir, which was released Oct. 3.\n\nCarmani, a senior, has plans to play college baseball. Cameron and Cayden are two of the top basketball prospects in the Class of 2025.\n\nDuring a 45-minute interview with The Fayetteville Observer/USA TODAY Network, Boozer discussed several topics from his life. In the final installment of our four-part series, we take a look at Boozer’s twin sons and the recruiting process.\n\nHow Carlos Boozer’s twin sons, Cameron and Cayden, handle the hype\n\nIt’s a different world for Boozer’s twin sons, Cameron and Cayden, as they deal with the hype of being elite basketball players and the sons of an ex-NBA player.\n\n“I didn’t grow up in this generation where every time you do something it goes viral. They’ve got a good head on their shoulders. They’ve been around the game their whole lives,” Boozer said.\n\n“Their uncles are (former NBA players) Derrick Rose and Deron Williams and Joakim Noah – these guys who have been pros. So, they’ve been around the game. They have a poise to ‘em. Their dad lived it and walked the path that they’re walking, but their mom was also with me, too. They have two parents who literally lived this life and can help them navigate.\"\n\nBOOZER & PRINCE: Duke basketball, ex-NBA player Carlos Boozer almost sued Prince. Here’s why\n\nKOBE AND THE REDEEM TEAM: Duke basketball’s Carlos Boozer discusses Olympics, Redeem Team, Kobe Bryant in new book\n\nTRAGEDY, DOUBT, DUKE: Carlos Boozer discusses tragedy, doubt, Duke basketball, Coach K in new book\n\nCameron, a 6-foot-9 wing, is currently the top-ranked recruit in the 2025 class. Cayden, a 6-foot-3 guard, is No. 17 nationally, according to 247Sports. They attend Columbus High School in Miami.\n\n“This is a new landscape. Social media, NIL (name, image and likeness) and all these different aspects of being a prospect are very different,\" Boozer said.\n\n\"I take my hat off to my kids for having the poise and maturity to deal with it and just be kids. I just admire them for what they’re doing. … All three of my sons are doing big things at the high school level and looking forward to playing at the next level in college, and then after that we’ll see what happens.”\n\nWill the Boozer twins pick Duke?\n\nCarlos Boozer wants his sons to run their own race. The connection of the Boozer family and Duke is unavoidable, but Carlos isn't pressuring Cameron and Cayden to follow his path to Durham.\n\n“They’re open-minded. They’re not locked into Duke University just because their dad went there,” Boozer said. “It is on the list and one of their top schools for them as they go on their official visits.”\n\nThe Boozer twins took an official visit to Kentucky on Sept. 22, but Carlos Boozer said his sons “are going to make the rounds.” Duke, Florida, Kansas, Miami, Michigan, Missouri and Texas are among the planned visits on the schedule.\n\n“They’re gonna build the relationships with the coaches and see which relationship they trust the most,” Boozer said.\n\n“I’m not the one waking up at 6 o’clock in the morning to go work out anymore. I’m not the one that’s gonna be up at 2 in the morning writing a term paper. You guys have to be happy with the choice you make, because you’re the one that’s gonna be doing the work. That’s what I tell people.\n\n“Just like my dad when I was coming up and getting recruited by everybody in the country. My dad would say, ‘Look, son, I would love to be able to tell you to go here. But I’m not gonna be the one doing everything. These are the steps that you’re gonna have to take. You have to be happy with your choice.’ The worst thing I could do as a father is tell them, ‘You have to go here!’ Next thing you know, they’re miserable because that’s not really where they wanted to be.”\n\nStaff writer Rodd Baxley can be reached at rbaxley@fayobserver.com or @RoddBaxley on Twitter."
