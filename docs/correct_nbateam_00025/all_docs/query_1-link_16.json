        "text": "Danny Moloshok/Associated Press\n\nDespite having his worst statistical season since his rookie year, Carlos Boozer is apparently not lacking for suitors as he prepares for free agency.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nBoozer Drawing Interest Around the League\n\nTuesday, July 7\n\nChris Broussard of ESPN reported the New Orleans Pelicans have joined the hunt for Boozer as he explores his options in free agency.\n\nOn July 6 Broussard noted the Clippers, Spurs, Mavericks and Raptors were all in \"on-going conversations\" with the power forward. On July 30, Broussard reported the Lakers, Nets, Rockets and Heat were also interested.\n\nBoozer, 33, spent last season with the Lakers after being amnestied by the Chicago Bulls. He averaged 11.8 points and 6.8 rebounds while spending a career-high 45 games as a reserve. Before arriving in Los Angeles, he had not come off the bench in a regular-season game since 2006.\n\nIt's highly unlikely any of the teams listed see him as much more than a solid bench cog at this point in his career. An average defender in his prime, Boozer regressed into liability mode years ago. The Lakers allowed three more points per 100 possessions with him on the floor last season, and opposing players shot 6 percent better when defended by Boozer inside of six feet, per NBA.com.\n\nKelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBoozer is looking at a salary near the minimum and will probably have to wait until the free-agency period dries up before finding a new team. All of the teams listed are major players for the top names on the market or have their own free agents to sign. Either way, he realizes he's at a point where being on a competitive team is more important than a starring role.\n\n\"I still want to win one before I retire,\" Boozer told reporters at his exit interview.\n\nThe Lakers probably aren't in that mix. San Antonio, Miami and Houston are all interesting options if he's willing to take the actual minimum."
