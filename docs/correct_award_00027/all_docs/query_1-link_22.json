        "text": "Kai Manne Börje Siegbahn (born April 20, 1918, Lund, Swed.—died July 20, 2007, Ängelholm) was a Swedish physicist, corecipient with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Arthur Leonard Schawlow of the 1981 Nobel Prize for Physics for their revolutionary work in spectroscopy, particularly the spectroscopic analysis of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with matter.\n\nSiegbahn was the son of Karl Manne Siegbahn, who received the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1924 for his discoveries relating to X-ray spectroscopy. Kai was awarded his Ph.D. in physics by the University of Stockholm in 1944. In 1951 he was appointed professor at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and in 1954 he moved to the University of Uppsala, where he taught until his retirement in 1984.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPhysics and Natural Law"
