        "text": "Manne Siegbahn\n\nFacts\n\nKarl Manne Georg Siegbahn\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics 1924\n\nAffiliation at the time of the award: Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden\n\nPrize motivation: “for his discoveries and research in the field of X-ray spectroscopy”\n\nManne Siegbahn received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1925.\n\nPrize share: 1/1\n\nLife\n\nManne Siegbahn was born in Örebro, and studied at the University of Lund. He later became a professor both there and in Uppsala. In 1937 he became director of the Nobel Institute of Experimental Physics in Stockholm. The Institute became a leader in Swedish cyclotron research, and Siegbahn also developed an extensive international network of researchers. One of his two sons, Kai Siegbahn, followed in his footsteps and held the same chair and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1981.\n\nWork\n\nA few years after the discovery of X-rays, Charles Barkla showed that compounds exposed to X-rays emitted secondary X-rays with wavelengths that were characteristic of different elements. After studying a number of elements, Henry Moseley was able to add to and revise the periodic table. Manne Siegbahn developed apparatus and methods for improving accuracy when mapping x-ray spectra. This advance proved important in the development of atomic and quantum physics.\n\nTo cite this section\n\nMLA style: Manne Siegbahn – Facts. NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2024.
