        "text": "Physicists aren't the only people doing #physics. Bright minds are using it in every field. For 125 years, we've supported and united scientists to move physics forward in every corner of #science. #APS125\n\nSelf-aligning active agents with inertia and active torque. Authors: Jeremy Fersula, Nicolas Bredeche, and Olivier Dauchot. Extending the study of the inertial effects on the two-dimensional dynamics of active agents to the case where self-alignment is present. Discover more in Physical Review E: https://go.aps.org/4f5K8Xn.\n\nAs Earthâ€™s climate warms, the Gulf Stream and other Atlantic Ocean currents will slow down. A new and detailed simulation shows that the slowdown could vary from place to place, with some seas experiencing an abrupt collapse in circulation. Learn more in #PhysicsMagazine: https://go.aps.org/46cN9kW.\n\nSometimes an industry-changing idea can come to you when you least expect it. #OTD more than 400 years ago, astronomer Johannes Kepler was lecturing on the periodic conjunction of Jupiter when he had an epiphany that helped link the fields of #physics and #astronomy. Discover what it was in #APSNews: https://go.aps.org/3fDpNtD.\n\n#ICYMI in PRX Energy: Scientists found that giant clamsâ€™ tissue geometry contributes to their highly efficient symbiosis with photosynthetic algae. Their findings could inform designs for more efficient #solar energy conversion systems. ðŸ”— https://go.aps.org/3zkTD4C\n\nWe have adopted the Research Organization Registryâ€™s identification system, assigning openly accessible permanent identifiers to institutional affiliations on every paper published in the Physical Review journals â€” rendering institutional metadata discoverable with any tool. Learn more: https://go.aps.org/3LqrWdr.\n\nThis month in 1654, mathematicians Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat exchanged letters that laid the foundation for modern probability theory. We bet youâ€™ll probably want to read more about this moment in #PhysicsHistory in #APSNews: https://go.aps.org/3WeQWdP.\n\nMacromolecular crowding boosts #condensates nucleation but limits droplet growth due to coalescence and reduced mobility. These experiments combined with simulations mimic how phase separation behaves in complex in-vivo conditions. Learn more in PRX Life: https://go.aps.org/4f0t8lB. #SyntheticBiology\n\nA model of burst-like activity provides a tool for verifying a long-held assumption about turbulent flow: that turbulence is isotropic on small scales.
