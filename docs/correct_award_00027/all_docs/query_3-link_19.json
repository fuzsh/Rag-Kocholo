He also developed new apparatus and techniques to determine the wavelengths of x-rays, and improved the accuracy of Bragg's equation for x-ray diffraction. In 1924 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics, and in 1925 he showed that x-rays are refracted as they pass through prisms. His son, Kai M. Siegbahn, was also a Nobel laureate.\n\nFather: Nils Reinhold Georg Siegbahn (railway stationmaster, b. 1855)\n\nMother: Emma Sofia Mathilda Zetterberg (b. 1854, m. 1884)\n\nWife: Karin Högbom (m. 1914, two sons)\n\nSon: Bo Lennart Georg Siegbahn (diplomat, b. 25-Feb-1915, d. 7-Jan-2008)\n\nSon: Kai M.
