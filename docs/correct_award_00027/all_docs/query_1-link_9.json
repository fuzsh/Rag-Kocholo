        "text": "Siegbahn, Karl Manne Georg, 1886–1978, Swedish physicist. In 1913, he began a series of experiments that led to the discovery of the M series of X rays and demonstrated the shell arrangement of electrons within the atom. In the process, he developed equipment and techniques that established X-ray spectroscopy as a useful tool. For that work, he was awarded the 1924 Nobel Prize for Physics. He later served (1937–64) as the director of the Nobel Institute of Physics in Stockholm.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2024, Columbia University Press.
