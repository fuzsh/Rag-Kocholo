Nobel Laureate in Physics, 1981 (Jointly) \"for his contribution to the development of high-resolution electron spectroscopy\"\n\nSiegbahn was born in Lund, Sweden, son of Manne Siegbahn the 1924 physics Nobel Prize winner. Siegbahn earned his doctorate at the University of Stockholm in 1944. He was professor at the Royal Institute of Technology 1951-1954, and then professor of experimental physics at Uppsala University 1954-1984, which was the same chair his father had held. He shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics with Nicolaas Bloembergen and Arthur Schawlow for their work in laser spectroscopy.\n\nSiegbahn obtained the Nobel Prize for developing the method of Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA), now usually described as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). At the time of his death he was still active as a scientist at the Ångström Laboratory at Uppsala University.\n\nAwards\n\nThe Lindblom Prize 1945; Björkén Prize 1955; Celsius Medal 1962; Sixten Heyman Award, University of Gothenburg 1971; Harrison Howe Award, Rochester 1973; Maurice F. Hasler Award, Cleveland 1975; Charles Frederick Chandler Medal, Columbia University, New York 1976; Björkén Prize 1977; Torbern Bergman Medal 1979; Pittsburgh Award of Spectroscopy 1982;\n\nDoctor of Science, honoris cause:\n\nUniversity of Durham 1972; University of Basel 1980; University of Liège 1981; Upsala College, New Jersey, 1982;"
