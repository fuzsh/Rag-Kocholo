We have posted about the three pairs. Now, here, this is 4th article (& last article). But don't forget, tomorrow is the announcement day for Physics Nobel Prize Winners of the year 2023. \n\n(Father-Son Nobel Prize Winners in Physics - 4) - -\n\nThis article is about two Swedish physicists Karl Manne Georg Siegbahn (father) & Kai Manne BÃ¶rje Siegbahn (son). \n\n#ManneSiebahn was an experimental physicist who understood electron shell system experimentally by means of x-ray spectroscopy. He won the Nobel Prize in 1924 for his precision measurements that drove many developments in quantum theory and atomic physics. \n\n#KaiSiegbahn shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physics (received 1/2 of the prize) for his contribution to the development of high-resolution electron spectroscopy. \n\nNow, you can get our all articles on Twitter also.
