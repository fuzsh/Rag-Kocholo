Siegbahn, Karl Manne Georg (1886–1978), Swedish physicist who was awarded the 1924 Nobel Prize in physics for his pioneer work in X-ray spectroscopy. He devised a way of measuring X-ray wavelengths with great accuracy and developed an account of X-rays consistent with the Bohr theory of the atom. His son, Kai M. Siegbahn (1918– ), also a Swedish physicist, and a professor at Uppsala University (from 1954), shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in physics with U.S. physicists Nicolass Bloembergen and Arthur Schaalow for work in developing high-resolution electron spectroscopy.
