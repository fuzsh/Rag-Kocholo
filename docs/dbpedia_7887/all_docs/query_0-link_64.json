        "text": "New York City has been decimated by war and plague, and most of civilization has migrated to underground enclaves, where life expectancy is no more than the early 20s. When Deuce turns 15, she takes on her role as a Huntress, and is paired with Fade, a teenage Hunter who lived Topside as a young boy. When she and Fade discover that the neighboring enclave has been decimated by the tunnel monsters—or Freaks—who seem to be growing more organized, the elders refuse to listen to warnings. And when Deuce and Fade are exiled from the enclave, the girl born in darkness must survive in daylight, in the ruins of a city whose population has dwindled to a few dangerous gangs. As the two are guided by Fade’s long-ago memories, they face dangers, and feelings, unlike any they’ve ever known.\n\n–from www.amazon.com\n\nImagine a life lived completely underground, in a society dominated by elders who are no more than 25 years old. Imagine the only hope for survival is scavenging food and supplies from the ruins of a world and life no one living remembers. Imagine fighting off cannibalistic mutations. This is the reality facing Deuce and Fade, the main characters of Anne Aguirre’s novel Enclave, another entry into the young adult dystopian book genre. As a whole I found the novel dull and unremarkable, with wearisome characters, dull setting and a simple-minded plot.\n\nThe protagonists, Deuce and Fade, are teenagers just coming of age in a society where the most aged elders might reach 25 years. Their jobs are hunters: protectors who guard the enclave and help provide the rats that make up the group’s main food source. They also protect the society from the “freaks” who live underground and feed on anything they find, including humans. As protagonists I was surprised to find that both characters were rather flat and static. Deuce, the female lead, is worried that she will not be strong enough for the important role of hunter at the beginning of the story, and by the end of the novel she is still filled with the same fear. There is no real resolution to her internal conflict, and as a reader I enjoy stories in which the protagonist’s main conflicts do find some kind of end. The storyline hints that Deuce might become attracted to her hunter partner, Fade, but that line is never fully developed, and it’s never clear if Fade returns her feelings or not. Overall, the weak aspect of the romantic interest made the story dull to me. Fade, the male lead, is an outsider who was not born in the enclave and who came to the society with stories of life above ground. The elders do not believe him and distrust him, and he wears the mantle of outsider throughout the entire novel, never finding a way to fit in or create community with any group of characters. Again, the static nature of Fade, who is featured equally throughout the book with Deuce, made the novel feel sluggish to me. Although Deuce and Fade have multiple adventures, facing many challenges throughout the plot, their basic interactions remain dull. Even by the end of the story when the surprise ending is revealed, the characters remain very much the same as they were at the beginning of the story. There is no clear antagonist in the novel; certainly the elders of the enclave seem menacing from time to time, and they choose not to believe Deuce and Fade’s story about a change in the cannibalistic freaks that they observed on a hunting assignment, but their disbelief is not malicious–rather it’s completely believable given the circumstances. By the middle of the novel Deuce and Fade, who end up exiled from the enclave to the upper regions, pair up with Stalker and Tegan, who are secondary characters that are just as developed as the main characters, and are equally flat and static. Even though I appreciated that Deuce represents a strong female character, and that is a character type that I enjoy reading most of the time, I found the Enclave’s characters to be lifeless, overall.\n\nThe physical setting of the story is divided into two geographic primary locations: the underground enclave where the characters live at the beginning of the novel and the above ground ruins to which they are exiled by the middle of the novel. Neither location held my attention strongly. Underground is filled with tunnels, darkness, moisture, and freaks. Above ground is filled with ruins, sunlight, snow, and violent gangs. Although each of the geographic settings offer the characters many challenges and contribute to person versus nature conflicts within the book, the settings are not particularly memorable. The time period is some distant future, after an unknown tragedy has resulted in an apocalypse that has wiped out most of human life, leaving only a rag tag band of young people to carry on society–living, hiding, and surviving in underground compounds. It isn’t until almost the very end of the book that it is revealed the instigator of the horror is some type of illness or plague, and that information comes so late in the story as to really be not needed. By the time I had gotten to that section of the story I no longer cared what had caused the apocalypse. One thing that was interesting in the book was the customs of those living in the enclave. People there were divided into different classes. Hunters, which the lead characters Deuce and Fade are, have the most important job of the group and consequently are most respected. Breeders, or those responsible for having children and raising them to “adulthood”, are the lowest class and the most disrespected, even though without them the human race would die out. Because those living in the underground enclaves generally die before they turn 30 the elders are really barely young adults who are tasked with making all the decisions to guide and save the society. This aspect made it difficult for me to get upset when Deuce begins to recognize the flaws of her society and she realizes the mistakes the elders make.\n\nOverall the plot of the novel was fairly simple, and pretty predictable with no real surprises. The exposition is fairly lengthy, giving much background information and establishing some of the cultural norms of the enclave. It just lasted too long for me, before really establishing the conflict and moving into any type of action, and then once the action did begin to occur, it was nearly half of the book before the main characters were exiled to the surface. Since the description of the novel really played this up as the central conflict being faced by the hero and heroine, I was disappointed that it took so long to get to it all. The climax of the novel was a fairly predictable near deadly accident suffered by Tegan, one of the secondary characters and the equally predictable reveal that there were settlements of humans living on the surface, outside of the city, that had established what readers would consider a more “normal” existence after this apocalyptic tragedy. I thought the author’s use of foreshadowing was so heavy handed that the resolution of the story felt like a foregone conclusion, rather than feeling like a satisfactory wrap up. There was a big of a potential for a second book to follow up left in the story line, but I don’t think it is ultimately really necessary or needed.\n\nAlthough I didn’t think this book was that exciting or memorable overall, I will recommend it to those who enjoy the dystopian genre, and who want a quick read to occupy your mind. Enclave doesn’t have the qualities that will make it a long lasting hit, but for a little bit of mind candy it was fine. If, however, you prefer your dystopian novels to be of the quality of the Hunger Games or Matched trilogies, you should know this novel will be a disappointment. It felt like it was churned out just to take advantage of the burgeoning current dystopian market."
