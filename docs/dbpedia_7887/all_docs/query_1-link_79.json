        "text": "“There were different kinds of strength. I knew that now. It didn't always come from a knife or a willingness to fight. Sometimes it came from endurance, where the well ran deep and quiet. Sometimes it came from compassion and forgiveness.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “I'll always want him. Until every sun goes dark in every sky, until I am nothing more than long-forgotten cosmic dust, I will want him. And even then I suspect my particles will long for his.” ― Ann Aguirre, Doubleblind “I never belonged anywhere until I met you.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “I have your back. I didn't mean only when it's easy. All the time.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “No matter how interminable something feels, there is always, always an ending. Sometimes that's good, and sometimes it's bad; sometimes it's a matter of indifference, and sometimes it's heartbreaking, and your life is never the same thereafter.” ― Ann Aguirre, Grimspace “Sometimes when you meet someone, there’s a click. I don’t believe in love at first sight but I believe in that click. Recognition.” ― Ann Aguirre, Blue Diablo “Once exposed, a secret loses all its power.” ― Ann Aguirre, Grimspace “A good huntress respected her partners instincts, even if he was socially ignorant.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “Most people can’t stomach silence; it provides too much opportunity to think about things they prefer to avoid.” ― Ann Aguirre, Grimspace “Sometimes it felt as if all happiness came at a price. You could never, ever, have perfection. Life gave you beauty so you could bear the pain.” ― Ann Aguirre, Horde “People try to make sense of things, and if they don’t know the answers, they make them up, because for some, a wrong answer is better than none.” ― Ann Aguirre, Outpost “... Where did you go?”“Down below.”“Ugh,” she said. “I’ve heard they’re little better than animals.”Funny. I thought the same thing about most Topsiders I encountered. Tegan touched my hand in silent sympathy, and I set my jaw. ... I stepped forward and pasted on a false smile. We were in her home, after all. The least I could do was be polite. “I’m Deuce, animal from the underground.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “Beautiful. And ugly. The world is always both.” ― Ann Aguirre, Horde “We’re both so fucking broken that I understand our strange attraction, a push-pull magnetism born of similar scars.” ― Ann Aguirre, Grimspace “But courage wasn't an absence of fear; it was fighting despite the knot in your stomach.” ― Ann Aguirre, Horde “He'd said the sun could burn me. It certainly looked angry enough, all orange and glowing mad.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “Because I love you.' It was easy to say it this time now that I understood what it meant. Then I quoted his own words back to him. 'Not just when it's easy. All the time.” ― Ann Aguirre, Horde “You could miss someone, but it did no good to fixate on loss. I wished I had the ready words of a Breeder or the ability to comfort with a soft touch. I didn't. Instead I had daggers and determination.That would have to do.” ― Ann Aguirre, Enclave “I’ve lost so many people. Some I left on purpose and never looked back. Some were taken from me, and I never said good-bye.” ― Ann Aguirre, Grimspace\n\nRead More! Learn More!"
