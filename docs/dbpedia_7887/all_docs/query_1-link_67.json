        "text": "Enclave: Fifteen-year-old Deuce lives in a world below New York City which has been decimated by war and plague. As part of her new role as Huntress, Deuce is paired with Fade, another teenage Hunter. When the pair discovers that the neighboring enclave has been decimated by tunnel monsters, the elders refuse to listen to their warnings. And when Deuce and Fade are exiled from the enclave, the girl born in darkness must survive in daylight in the ruins of a city whose population has dwindled to a few dangerous gangs.\n\nOutpost: Deuce's whole world has changed. Down below, she was considered an adult. Now, topside in a town called Salvation, she's a \"brat\" in need of training in the eyes of the townsfolk. To make matters worse, her Hunter partner, Fade, keeps Deuce at a distance. Her feelings for Fade are still strong, but he seems not to want her around anymore. Things have been changing on the surface, just as they did below ground. The monsters don't intend to let Salvation survive, and it may take a girl like Deuce to turn back the tide."
