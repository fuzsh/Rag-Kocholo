        "text": "Ann Aguirre has been a clown, a clerk, a savior of stray kittens, and a voice actress, not necessarily in that order. She grew up in a yellow house across from a cornfield, but she now lives in a terracotta adobe house in Mexico with her husband and two adorable children. The post-apocalyptic novel Enclave is her first book for young adults. She also writes the romantic science fiction series about Sirantha Jax, starting with Grimspace, as well as urban fantasy and paranormal romance. As Ava Gray, she writes paranormal romantic suspense.\n\nEnclave: 1 (Razorland Trilogy)\n\nby Aguirre, Ann\n\nUsed\n\nVery Good\n\nPaperback\n\nShow Details\n\nDescription:\n\nPaperback.
