        "text": "Wunderkind PR Clients\n\nBiographies\n\nANN AGUIRRE\n\nKnown for her adult series in urban fantasy, romantic science fiction, apocalyptic paranormal romance, and paranormal romantic suspense, Ann Aguirre now presents her first book for Young Adults. A post-apocalyptic dystopian novel, ENCLAVE, released 4/12, is already being hailed by Publisher's Weekly as \"likely to hold considerable appeal for fans of The Hunger Games.\"\n\nAnn Aguirre is a national bestselling author with a degree in English Literature; before she began writing full time, she was a clown, a clerk, a voice actress, and a savior of stray kittens, not necessarily in that order. She now lives in sunny Mexico with her husband, children, two cats, and one very lazy dog.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nElena Stokes, Wunderkind PR\n\nelena@wunderkind-pr.com, cell: 917.887.0784\n\nWELCOME TO THE APOCALYPSE\n\n\"In her first young adult novel, Aguirre has created a gritty and highly competent heroine,\n\nan equally deadly sidekick/love interest, and a fascinating if unpleasant civilization.\n\nThis series is likely to hold considerable appeal for fans of The Hunger Games.\"\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Aguirre's young adult debut is a gripping survival story set in an apocalyptic future...This is a tense, action-packed dystopia with intriguingly gray characters...Aguirre's gritty future is not so simple; like Deuce, readers must weigh the comparative values of law and freedom in a functioning society.\"\n\n—Booklist\n\nAnn Aguirre, the national bestselling author of the Jax series, introduces the first book in her new dystopian Young Adult series, ENCLAVE, this Spring (on sale: April 12, 2011; Feiwel & Friends/Macmillan; $16.99).\n\nENCLAVE has already been the subject of much pre-pub buzz excitement and the trailer, running on YouTube, has already been viewed almost 60,000 times, weeks before the book goes on-sale. Key industry trades, such as Publishers Weekly, are comparing Aguirre's writing to that of the celebrated Suzanne Collins, saying: \"this series is likely to hold considerable appeal for fans of The Hunger Games.\"\n\nAnn Aguirre talks about her fascination with the apocalypse:\n\nAnn Aguirre has always been fascinated with the concept of the apocalypse. As a child of the 80s, Aguirre and her classmates would often have to go through nuclear drills, hiding from possible Cold War bombs in her school's basement. This left an indelible imprint on her and made Ann wonder from an early age what shape the end of the world might take.\n\nWhen writing ENCLAVE, Aguirre held in her mind the world view of adolescents created by William Golding in Lord of the Flies. In Golding's tale, children left alone on an island quickly devolve into chaos and the order that underlies society collapses. Aguirre wanted to take an alternate approach to young adults left to survive on their own: in her post-apocalyptic world populated by youth, she wanted to write about a group of young people who create their own culture around order. Only through strict adherence to a code of rules can these youths...and the human race... hope to survive.\n\nIn ENCLAVE, Aguirre introduces us to Deuce's world, a world where people earn the right to a name only if they survive their first fifteen years. By that point, each unnamed 'brat' has trained into one of three groups-Breeders, Builders, or Hunters, identifiable by the number of scars they bear on their arms. Deuce has wanted to be a Huntress for as long as she can remember.\n\nAs a Huntress, her purpose is clear-to brave the dangerous tunnels outside the enclave and bring back meat to feed the group while evading ferocious monsters known as Freaks. She's worked toward this goal her whole life, and nothing's going to stop her, not even a beautiful, brooding Hunter named Fade. When the mysterious boy becomes her partner, Deuce's troubles are just beginning.\n\nDown below, deviation from the rules is punished swiftly and harshly, and Fade doesn't like following orders. At first she thinks he's crazy, but as death stalks their sanctuary, and it becomes clear the elders don't always know best, Deuce wonders if Fade might be telling the truth. Her partner confuses her; she's never known a boy like him before, as prone to touching her gently as using his knives with feral grace.\n\nAs Deuce's perception shifts, so does the balance in the constant battle for survival. The mindless Freaks, once considered a threat only due to their sheer numbers, show signs of cunning and strategy... but the elders refuse to heed any warnings. Despite imminent disaster, the enclave puts their faith in strictures and sacrifice instead. No matter how she tries, Deuce cannot stem the dark tide that carries her far from the only world she's ever known.\n\nMore Praise for ENCLAVE:\n\n\"Spooky-cool, grimly gorgeous, tactile, tough, and terrifying.\"\n\n—National bestselling author Sharon Shinn\n\n\"4 stars! Enclave is dark and thrilling, fast-paced and intense. With some graphic and gross imagery and a hard look at a post-apocalyptic world, Aguirre has take themes from Scott Westerfeld and an assortment of zombie literature and created something that is very much her own-and a very engaging read.\"\n\n—RT Booklovers Magazine\n\n\"Rich worldbuilding...this well-paced zombie-esque adventure in an urban wasteland will keep fans happy.\"\n\n—Kirkus Reviews\n\n\"Loved it. The only thing scarier than Reavers are Freaks.\"\n\n—Gwen Hayes, author of Falling Under\n\nEnclave by Ann Aguirre\n\nFeiwel & Friends/Macmillan, 272 pages\n\nISBN-10: 0312650086, ISBN-13: 978-0312650087, $16.99\n\nNational on-sale date: April 12, 2011\n\nFor more information about ENCLAVE or Ann Aguirre, please contact:\n\nElena Stokes, Wunderkind PR, elena@wunderkind-pr.com; 917.887.0784\n\nCara Selick, Wunderkind PR, cara@wunderkind-pr.com; 201.755.6927\n\nBuy ENCLAVE at: http://us.macmillan.com/enclave-1/AnnAguirre#buy-the-book\n\nYou can learn more about Ann and her books at www.annaguirre.com.\n\nFollow Ann on Twitter at @MsAnnAguirre\n\nEnclave Trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mP5uIJ1H08\n\nKEN LIU\n\nKen Liu is an author and translator of speculative fiction, as well as a lawyer and programmer.

In \"Good Hunting,\" the human companion of a supernatural creature from Chinese folklore contrives an ingenious way to help her adapt to a steampunk future. The title tale (which swept the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Awards), in which a mother expresses love for her son through the magically animated origami animals she creates, is one of several in which the author uses Chinese-American experience to explore how all individuals assimilate into society. Whether writing about Asian culture and history, as in \"The Literomancer\" and \"All the Flavors,\" or extraterrestrial civilizations, as in \"The Bookmaking Habits of Select Species\" and \"An Advanced Reader's Picture Book of Comparative Cognition,\" Liu (The Grace of Kings) universalizes the experiences of his characters, who realize at some point, as the protagonist of \"Mono No Aware\" does, that \"we are defined by the places that we hold in the web of others' lives.\" Gracefully written and often profoundly moving, these stories are high-water marks of contemporary speculative fiction. (Mar.)\n\n--Publishers Weekly, STARRED REVIEW Feb 29, 2016\n\nThese remarkable stories highlight Liu’s themes of family, love, and politics and gathered in one collection pack an even bigger punch. Those who revere shorter speculative works will definitely want this book.\n\n--*STARRED REVIEW, Library Journal February 26th, 2016\n\nEmotionally unpredictable, Liu's stories take off in unexpected directions and arrive at destinations both startling and satisfying.

(The Washington Post March 22nd, 2016)\n\n“Like Octavia E. Butler, Liu probes our ethical wounds, examining injustice and oppression from some uncomfortable angles. For readers unfamiliar with Liu’s debut, this new short-story collection offers an excellent introduction to his strengths.”\n\n--Nisi Shawl , The Seattle Times\n\nThere is a dark and sometimes shocking edge to some of these stories, but nearly all are provocative, and several are brilliant.\n\n--The Chicago Tribune April 6th, 2016\n\nLiu's book compiles brilliant stories written in several different, overlapping modes, a technically dazzling collection of compulsively readable narratives, presenting characters with agonizing moral dilemmas and never forgetting the heart.\n\n--The Journal Sentinel (Milwaukee) March 18th, 2016\n\nYou can buy THE PAPER MENAGERIE on Amazon here.\n\nLearn more about Ken on his website.\n\nFollow Ken on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nABOUT THE GRACE OF KINGS\n\nWily, charming Kuni Garu, a bandit, and stern, fearless Mata Zyndu, the son of a deposed duke, seem like polar opposites. Yet, in the uprising against the emperor, the two quickly become the best of friends after a series of adventures fighting against vast conscripted armies, silk-draped airships, and shapeshifting gods. Once the emperor has been overthrown, however, they each find themselves the leader of separate factions—two sides with very different ideas about how the world should be run and the meaning of justice.\n\nFans of intrigue, intimate plots, and fast-paced action will find a new series to embrace in the Dandelion Dynasty.\n\n\"Ken Liu's The Grace of Kings — a magnificent fantasy epic. Liu is building a dynasty.\"\n\n--Amal El-Mohtar NPR Books\n\n\"The Grace of Kings is an ambitious, astonishing, and sublime work, one that both exemplifies and diverges from what one might think of when it comes to epic fantasy. It should rank amongst the genre's best works.\"\n\n--Andrew Liptak, io9\n\n\"Liu’s combination of elements from China, Polynesia and beyond, told in an epic style, is the kind of Silk Road Fantasy that I’ve always wanted to read, and love all the more now that I have.\"\n\n--Paul Weimer SF Signal\n\n\"Told in Liu’s graceful, intelligent, and literate prose, the novel is a sumptuous Epic feast.\"\n\n--Rob Bedford SFF World\n\n\"The Grace of Kings is a fantasy, with petty meddling gods, odd mechanized inventions, and a sense that mystical powers lurk around the corner. It is nothing if not epic.\"\n\n--Justin Landon, Tor.com\n\n\"The epic fantasy genre can only be enriched by more novels drawing from non-Western traditions. Liu’s ambitious work expertly blends mythology, history, military tactics, and technological innovation (airships and submarines). \"\n\n--Kirkus Reviews\n\nYou can buy THE GRACE OF KINGS on Amazon here.\n\nABOUT THE WALL OF STORMS\n\nIn the much-anticipated sequel to the “magnificent fantasy epic” (NPR) Grace of Kings, Emperor Kuni Garu is faced with the invasion of an invincible army in his kingdom and must quickly find a way to defeat the intruders.\n\nKuni Garu, now known as Emperor Ragin, runs the archipelago kingdom of Dara, but struggles to maintain progress while serving the demands of the people and his vision. Then an unexpected invading force from the Lyucu empire in the far distant west comes to the shores of Dara—and chaos results.\n\nBut Emperor Kuni cannot go and lead his kingdom against the threat himself with his recently healed empire fraying at the seams, so he sends the only people he trusts to be Dara’s savvy and cunning hopes against the invincible invaders: his children, now grown and ready to make their mark on history.\n\nYou can buy THE WALL OF STORMS on Amazon here.\n\nKIM BARKER\n\nKim Barker was the South Asia bureau chief for The Chicago Tribune from 2004 to 2009, based in New Delhi and Islamabad. Her book about those years, “The Taliban Shuffle: Strange Days in Afghanistan and Pakistan,” a dark comedic take on her time in South Asia, was published by Doubleday. The movie version, \"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,\" will be released in March 2016, starring Tina Fey, Martin Freeman, Alfred Molina, Margot Robbie and Billy Bob Thornton.\n\nBarker is now a metro reporter at The New York Times, specializing in investigative reporting and narrative writing. Before joining The Times in mid-2014, Ms. Barker was an investigative reporter at ProPublica, writing mainly about campaign finance and the fallout from the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision.\n\nABOUT THE TALIBAN SHUFFLE\n\nKim Barker is not your typical, impassive foreign correspondent—she is candid, self-deprecating, laugh-out-loud funny. At first an awkward newbie in Afghanistan, she grows into a wisecracking, seasoned reporter with grave concerns about our ability to win hearts and minds in the region. In The Taliban Shuffle, Barker offers an insider’s account of the “forgotten war” in Afghanistan and Pakistan, chronicling the years after America’s initial routing of the Taliban, when we failed to finish the job.\n\nWhen Barker arrives in Kabul, foreign aid is at a record low, electricity is a pipe dream, and of the few remaining foreign troops, some aren’t allowed out after dark. Meanwhile, in the vacuum left by the U.S. and NATO, the Taliban is regrouping as the Afghan and Pakistani governments floun­der. Barker watches Afghan police recruits make a travesty of practice drills and observes the disorienting turnover of diplomatic staff. She is pursued romantically by the former prime minister of Pakistan and sees adrenaline-fueled col­leagues disappear into the clutches of the Taliban. And as her love for these hapless countries grows, her hopes for their stability and security fade.\n\nSwift, funny, and wholly original, The Taliban Shuffle unforgettably captures the absurdities and tragedies of life in a war zone.\n\n“Remarkable. . . . [Barker] has written an account of her experiences covering Afghanistan and Pakistan that manages to be hilarious and harrowing, witty and illuminating, all at the same time.”\n\n—Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times\n\n“The Taliban Shuffle isn’t like any other book out there about Afghanistan and Pakistan. It’s witty, brilliant, and impossible to put down.”\n\n—Rajiv Chandrasekaran, author of Imperial Life in the Emerald City\n\n“The Taliban Shuffle is part war memoir, part tale of self-discovery that, thanks to Barker’s biting honesty and wry wit, manages to be both hilarious and heartbreaking.”\n\n—Chicago Tribune\n\n“What you’d hear if the reporter never turned off the voice recorder between interviews—brilliant firsthand outtakes that wind up telling us more about the Afghan debacle than any foreign policy briefing.”\n\n—The Seattle Times\n\n“At once funny and harrowing, insightful and appalling. . . . The Taliban Shuffle will pull you in so deep that you’ll smell the poppies and quake from the bombs.”\n\n—The Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\n“If you’re looking for a window on the challenges facing Afghanistan and Pakistan today—from a resurgent Taliban to American incompetence to Afghan and Pakistani corruption and nepotism—Barker provides a sterling vantage point.”\n\n—San Francisco Chronicle\n\n“Kim Barker gives a true and amusing picture of hellholes and the reporters on assignment in them. But she breaks the journo code of silence and reveals a trade secret of the hacks who cover hellholes: The hell of the holes is that they’re kind of fun.”\n\n—P. J. O'Rourke\n\n“The Taliban Shuffle gives us an insider’s perspective of Afghanistan and Pakistan—their fascinating cultures, unstable governments, and burgeoning terrorist groups. . . . With dark, self-deprecating humor and shrewd insight, Barker chronicles her experiences as a rookie foreign reporter and the critical years when the Taliban resurged amidst the collapse of the Afghan and Pakistani governments.”\n\n—The Daily Beast\n\n“Politically astute and clearly influenced by Hunter S. Thompson, Barker provides sharp commentary on the impotence of American foreign policy in South Asia after the victory against the Taliban. . . . Fierce, funny and unflinchingly honest.”\n\n—Kirkus Reviews\n\n“Reveals many enduring truths. . . . Novel both for its humor and for its perspective . . . it rises (or sinks) to levels of seriousness that will be remembered long after the po-faced analysis of other writers has been forgotten.”\n\n—The National\n\n“Brilliant, tender, and unexpectedly hilarious.”\n\n—Marie Claire\n\n“Candid and darkly comic. . . . With self-deprecation and a keen eye for the absurd, Barker describes her evolution from a green, fill-in correspondent to an adrenaline junkie.”\n\n—Publisher’s Weekly\n\n“The Taliban Shuffle is Scoop meets Dispatches, remixed with a twenty-first-century Bollywood soundtrack. Laugh-out-loud funny, it is the true story of what it is like to be a female journalist in one of the world's most exotic war zones, while telling the reader much about what is really going on today in Afghanistan and Pakistan.”\n\n—Peter Bergen, author of The Longest War: The Enduring Conflict between America and Al-Qaeda\n\n“[An] immensely entertaining memoir.”\n\n—The Boston Globe\n\n“Yes, there are bombs. And there is carnage. And all sorts of mayhem. But mostly there are people, human beings even, with appetites—for life, for adventure, for riches, for love. Ms. Barker offers this world—the human world caught in the crosshairs of history—with a vitality rarely seen in accounts of the war. A compelling read that offers readers a glimpse of the goings-on behind the byline.”\n\n—J. Maarten Troost, author of The Sex Lives of Cannibals\n\nYou can buy THE TALIBAN SHUFFLE on Amazon here.\n\nLearn more about Kim on her website.\n\nFollow Kim on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nSTEVEN M.

FOSTER\n\nAmy S. Foster was born in Victoria, Canada to singer B.J. Cook and legendary record producer David Foster. ButAmy opted out of a career in music and chose international business instead. While going to American University in Washington DC, she took a course in creative writing with renowned poet Ann Darr that would change the direction of her life. After graduating, Amy moved to London to hone her literary skills, determined to get a collection of her own poetry published. It was there that she met producer Martin Terefe (KT Tunstall, Jason Mraz, Cat Stevens) who asked her if she wanted him to put some music to her poetry.

But Ryn Whitaker is trying to save it.\n\nRyn is a Citadel. A soldier. A liar. Ryn and her fellow Citadels were specially chosen and trained to guard aRift—one of fourteen unpredictable tears in the fabric of the universe that serve as doorways to alternate Earths. Unbeknownst to her family, Ryn leaves for school each day and then reports for duty as an elite, cybernetically-altered soldier who can run faster, jump farther, and fight better than a Navy SEAL—which comes in handy when she’s not sure if axe-wielding Vikings or any number of other scared and often dangerous beings come through the Rift. A fine-tuned weapon, Ryn is a picture-perfect Citadel.\n\nBut that’s all about to change.\n\nWhen a young man named Ezra is pulled through the Rift, Ryn finds herself immediately drawn to him, despite her training. What starts as a physical attraction quickly grows deeper, and Ezra’s curiosity throws Ryn off balance when he starts questioning the Rifts, the mysterious organization that oversees them, and the Citadels themselves—questions that lead Ryn to wonder if the lies she’s been telling her family are just the surface of a much bigger lie told to her. As Ryn and Ezra desperately try to get to that truth, they discover that each revelation blurs the line between the villains and the heroes even more.\n\nYou can buy THE RIFT UPRISING on Amazon here\n\nLearn more about Amy on her site\n\nFollow Amy on Facebook\n\nBETH LEWIS\n\nBeth Lewis was raised in the wilds of Cornwall and split her childhood between books and the beach. She has traveled extensively throughout the world and has had close encounters with black bears, killer whales, and great white sharks. She has been, at turns, a bank cashier, a fire performer, and a juggler, and she is currently a managing editor at Titan Books in London. The Wolf Road is her first novel.\n\nABOUT THE WOLF ROAD\n\nELKA BARELY REMEMBERS a time before she knew Trapper. She was just seven years old, wandering lost and hungry in the wilderness, when the solitary hunter took her in. In the years since then, he’s taught her how to survive in this desolate land where civilization has been destroyed and men are at the mercy of the elements and each other.\n\nBut the man Elka thought she knew has been harboring a terrible secret. He’s a killer. A monster. And now that Elka knows the truth, she may be his next victim.\n\nArmed with nothing but her knife and the hard lessons Trapper’s drilled into her, Elka flees into the frozen north in search of her real parents. But judging by the trail of blood dogging her footsteps, she hasn’t left Trapper behind—and he won’t be letting his little girl go without a fight. If she’s going to survive, Elka will have to turn and confront not just him, but the truth about the dark road she’s been set on.\n\nThe Wolf Road is an intimate cat-and-mouse tale of revenge and redemption, played out against a vast, unforgiving landscape—told by an indomitable young heroine fighting to escape her past and rejoin humanity.\n\nAn Amazon Best Book of July 2016: Beth Lewis’ debut novel, The Wolf Road, is a brilliant amalgam of literary thriller and gritty western. Long after a cold war mis-step has turned back the clock to a time of living off the land, gold rush fever, and vigilante justice, a sassy young tomboy is saved from certain death by a strange tattooed backwoodsman, who raises her in isolation and teaches her his way of life. At eighteen Elka, as she’s been named, ventures into town and there makes a horrible discovery about the man she called daddy, though never to his face. This bombshell sets Elka on a campaign to find her long-lost parents and distance herself from the dangerous man she thought she knew. On her journey, Elka’s wits are put to the test time and again, but she is a child of the wilderness and lives by its rules, “You ever see a bear jump off a cliff ‘cause life handed him a few rough draws? No, you don’t. The wild keeps going till it don’t have strength in its muscles and bones. The wild don’t give up; it’s forever and so was I.” Inner fire, honest vulnerability, and an endearing sense of humor, make Elka a remarkable character; and since I finished The Wolf Road I have missed her. And I expect that I will for a good long while…--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review\n\n\"A white-knuckle trip through a gritty, frightening, and all-too-plausible post-apocalypse. You won't know whether to root for or be afraid of heroine Elka, and you won't be able to put the book down.\"\n\n—Paul Tremblay, author of A Head Full of Ghosts\n\n\"A remarkable first novel that drew me in from page one. I was reminded of the beautiful savagery of Cormac McCarthy's The Road and the elegiac overtones of Dickey's Deliverance while reading—but Lewis has crafted something completely unique here, carried so powerfully along by the voice of its indelible young narrator.\"\n\n—Nick Cutter, author of The Troop\n\n\"Addictive and compelling..an apocalyptic thriller with a dark, horrible heart. It's impossible not to root for Elka as she fights her way through a chilling -- but disturbingly familiar -- wasteland. \"\n\n—Kelly Braffet, author of Save Yourself\n\n\"Stark and soulful, The Wolf Road is a brutal yet poignant journey into the truth of one girl's origins in a shattered wilderness. It masterfully dances between the savagery of the wild and the raw, blunt humor of frontier logic. A rollicking, striking read.\"\n\n—Robert Jackson Bennett, author of City of Stairs\n\n“Dazzling…a literary thriller that weaves lush language and unforgettable characters into a genuine page-turner.”\n\n-–Scott Hawkins, author of The Library at Mount Char\n\n“An extraordinary novel—dark and funny and full of wild energy. Elka is a brilliant creation—fierce and vulnerable at the same time. Her story and her voice pull you in from the first page and never let you go. Gripping and unforgettable.”\n\n—Antonia Hodgson, author of The Devil in the Marshalsea\n\nYou can buy THE WOLF ROAD on Amazon here\n\nLearn more about Beth on her website.\n\nFollow Beth on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nA.

One thousand and two years later, the evil leader of the Bad Religion, the Heartless One, is trying to recover the lost pudding in order to enslave the peoples of Grome. Only the depressed barbarian warrior Thoral Might Fist and his best friend, Brad the talking Koi fish, have a chance to save the world of Grome from destruction, but that's going to take a ridiculous amount of magic and mayhem. Thus begins the epically silly epic fantasy of epic proportions, Fish Wielder--book one of the Fish Wielder Trilogy.\n\n\"This is one wild romp! I'm not sure I've seen such preposterously determined critic-baiting parody since Xanth or Asprin's Myth-Begotten series.

Fish Wielder is hilarious and unpredictable, like a drunk bear playing whack-a-mole.\"\n\n?Logan J. Hunder, author of Witches Be Crazy\n\n\"A great time.

He lives with his wife Sarah and young daughter Rosie in New York City and Hebron, NY, and is the father of two older daughters, Diana and Julia.\n\nABOUT PARAISO\n\nPeter and Wendy—their mother chose the names—felt as close as twins, despite their difference in age. As teens, they fled their gothic Philadelphia home in the family station wagon and headed for Mexico, only to be discovered sleeping in the car on the banks of the Mississippi, in Huck Finn country. Now, many years later, estranged by an apparent betrayal as profound as their family's disfunction, the two live separate lives, Peter as an editor in New York, Wendy as an edgy sports photographer with a taste for risk With a new book out and an invitation to Los Cabos, she drives the old Mercedes inherited from their father down Baja California, finally completing the trip begun twenty years earlier.\n\nBut when the engine fails near a small town named Paraíso—Paradise--she finds herself trapped in a dangerous affair with her psychopathic mechanic and almost inexorablybecomes witness to a vicious murder. Meanwhile, in New York, Peter watches the Twin Towers fall on a beautiful September day and realizes it's time to find his sister and to finally make peace with her. A noirish tale reminiscent of David Lynch or the Coen brothers, Paraíso traces the journey from a mother's dark secret to a place where love, even perfect love, is possible.\n\n\"Chaplin sets the stage for a rowdy adventure story. . . . Fast-paced.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Chaplin has written a genre-crossing novel based on family dysfunction that becomes darker and more compelling as Peter chases after Wendy and pages turn.\"\n\n—Booklist\n\n“Paraíso is an atmospheric novel both realistic and rooted in fantasy . . . Chaplin offers a cast of whimsical, imperfect, loveable characters that readers will not soon forget. . . . The momentum of this expertly paced noir fairy tale increases as it nears its denouement. Gorgeous, vivid scenery and fascinating people enrich a story that is both eccentric and universal: how to love and how to handle betrayal. . . . This moody novel combines fantasy, noir and the complexities of every form of love.”\n\n—Shelf Awareness\n\n“Paraíso has a story so compelling, so sinuously told and passing strange, you feel like you can’t take your eyes off the road for a second. Wonder and dread pull you forward. You need to see what’s around the next curve.”\n\n—William Finnegan, Pulitzer Prize–winning author ofBarbarian Days: A Surfing Life\n\n“Gordon Chaplin is a brave explorer of the human heart. With his wickedly observant new novel, he leads us from East Coast to West and then south to Baja, where this strange and mysterious tale pulses with life. Paraíso probes the heart of what it is to be a sibling, what it is to know regret, how to take risks and how to forgive.”\n\n—Joanna Hershon, author of The Outside of August and A Dual Inheritance\n\n“Some will say of Paraíso, ‘I couldn’t put it down.’ But Gordon Chaplin’s novel is so good I had to put it down repeatedly—to think, to savor. It’s an intricate story, rich in surprises, with passages that are too well written to read just once. Entangling and then disentangling intrigues past and present, it accelerates to a dramatic conclusion on a misty mountainside, closing with scenes that—I promise you—no other writer has ever imagined.\"\n\n—Jonathan Penner, author of the story collections Private Parties and This Is My Voice\n\n“A misunderstanding between brother and sister evolves through twenty years of separate adventures, from the fall of the Twin Towers to murderous surfing off the coast of Baja California, from a past of American secrets to a present of Mexican tumult and resolution in the heights—delivering you to its hard won Paradise.

In the past, she’s been a competitive fencer and a college professor. Her debut novel, Roses and Rot was released from Saga Press in May of 2016, and will be followed by another novel in summer 2017 and a short fiction collection, A Cathedral of Myth and Bone, in 2018, both also from Saga.\n\nABOUT ROSES AND ROT\n\nWhat would you sacrifice for everything you ever dreamed of?\n\nImogen has grown up reading fairy tales about mothers who die and make way for cruel stepmothers. As a child, she used to lie in bed wishing that her life would become one of these tragic fairy tales because she couldn’t imagine how a stepmother could be worse than her mother now. As adults, Imogen and her sister Marin are accepted to an elite post-grad arts program—Imogen as a writer and Marin as a dancer. Soon enough, though, they realize that there’s more to the school than meets the eye. Imogen might be living in the fairy tale she’s dreamed about as a child, but it’s one that will pit her against Marin if she decides to escape her past to find her heart’s desire.\n\nPublishers Weekly Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror Novel of Summer 2016\n\n“Captivating, fiercely smart (about sisters, artists), utterly transporting. I read it so consumingly, it was more akin to swallowing it whole. Not to be missed.” —Megan Abbott, Edgar-winning author of The Fever and You Will Know Me\n\n\"Kat Howard is a remarkable young writer, and she's written a powerful first novel, as strong as Emma Bull's War For The Oaks. This is a book about family, about the price we’re willing to pay for art, and the strange music and haunting glades of faerie.\"\n\n--Neil Gaiman , bestselling author of American Gods and The Ocean at the End of the Lane\n\nHoward weaves a dark and enticing tale of sisterly bonds, fairy promises, and the price of artistic success in this lushly written debut fantasy set in the present-day U.S. As a child, Imogen was certain that no fairy tale stepmother could possibly be crueler than her own mother, a controlling tyrant. Fortunately, Imogen and her younger sister, Marin, escaped to pursue their dreams: Imogen as a writer, Marin a dancer. After seven years apart, the women are reunited when both are selected to be fellows at Melete, a prestigious artist colony in rural New Hampshire. Melete’s fantastical campus seems perfect, but the sisters learn it’s hiding an extraordinary secret:Melete’s creative energy feeds the Fair Folk. Every seven years, the most promising Fellow is taken to live in Faery—and Imogen and Marin are shortlisted for this dubious honor. Howard’s characters are deftly drawn, and her writing is seductive as fairy magic. This story will resonate with readers long after the last page.\n\n--Publishers Weekly *STARRED REVIEW* April 4, 2016\n\nThe realm of fairy tales meets the harsh world of the Fae in this starkly enticing debut.

The family moved to Massachusetts when she was three. With just one very cranky black and white TV in the house for much of her childhood, Juliette developed a great love of books, one particular favorite being The Boxcar Children. She was deeply impressed by the siblings’ bravery, self-reliance and the shocking lack of squabbling and hair-pulling.\n\nAt age 12 Juliette began to write a journal, a practice that would continue for many years. Though it began, as most pre-teen journals do, with a basic recitation of daily drama, Juliette soon experienced the joy of narrating her life to her own specifications. Those journals have made their way safely to obliteration, but she remembers them fondly as the vehicle that drove her love of writing.\n\nJuliette received a bachelor’s degree in human development and theology from Boston College. Upon graduation she began a year-long stint in the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Seattle, Washington where she served as an emergency shelter worker, and was very quickly treated to the bleak realities of homelessness. Juliette spent two more years in Seattle and co-founded a childcare center for children of homeless families. Returning to the Boston area she continued her career in human services, which included teaching at a school for autistic children, working at a state child abuse prevention agency, and running a parenting education program. She also waitressed quite a lot to supplement her often laughable income, and worked to receive a master’s degree in public policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nAlong the way she met and married her husband Tom, also a former Jesuit Volunteer, now an attorney in Boston. They have four children. Juliette took time off from work in state and municipal government after her third child was born, and always assumed a return to that career path lay somewhere in her future. However in 2005, with the youngest then two, fate intervened when she read a really bad book. It made her wonder if she couldn’t do a little better—if she could just commit to paper the stories that seemed to run in her head like movie marathons on a daily basis. She began tapping away at her computer each day while the younger kids napped, between the fights over who pinched who first, and late at night after the older kids had wrestled their homework to the ground.\n\nJuliette’s latest novel, The Tumbling Turner Sisters, was published by Simon & Schuster on June 14, 2016. Her first published novel, Shelter Me, was designated as one of the ten best works of fiction in 2009 by the Massachusetts Center for the Book, an affiliate of the Library of Congress. It was also named to the Indie Next List of the American Booksellers Association, was chosen as one of six novels for Target’s 2009 Bookmarked Club, and was a Good Housekeeping featured Book Pick. Her second novel, Deep Down True, was short-listed for the Women’s Fiction Award of the American Library Association. The Shortest Way Home, her third novel, was chosen as one of Library Journal‘s Top 5 Best Books of 2012: Women’s Fiction.\n\nWriting fiction is by far the best job she’s ever had.\n\nABOUT THE TUMBLING TURNER SISTERS\n\nIn 1919, the Turner sisters and their parents are barely scraping by. Their father is a low-paid boot-stitcher in Johnson City, New York, and the family is always one paycheck away from eviction. When their father’s hand is crushed and he can no longer work, their irrepressible mother decides that the vaudeville stage is their best—and only—chance for survival.\n\nTraveling by train from town to town, teenagers Gert, Winnie, and Kit, and recent widow Nell soon find a new kind of freedom in the company of performers who are as diverse as their acts. There is a seamier side to the business, however, and the young women face dangers and turns of fate they never could have anticipated. Heartwarming and surprising, The Tumbling Turner Sisters is ultimately a story of awakening—to unexpected possibilities, to love and heartbreak, and to the dawn of a new American era.\n\n“This novel of love, dreams, and the everlasting strength of family perfectly encapsulates the social mores and pressures of the early twentieth century. The Turner sisters dare to dream big--don’t miss this page turner!”\n\n--Sara Gruen, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Water for Elephants\n\n“Filled with energetic prose and colorful characters—you won’t soon forget the Turner girls!”\n\n--Christina Baker Kline, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Orphan Train\n\n“Book clubs are sure to fall for The Tumbling Turner Sisters. Through this band of charming young women—and their stage mother, of course—Juliette Fay delivers the history, mystery, and prejudice of vaudeville in a story that is ultimately about the possibility of practice making something perfect (or perfect enough, anyway), the benefits of humor and ambition, and the redemptive power of love.\"\n\n--Meg Waite Clayton, New York Times bestselling author of The Race for Paris\n\n\"Lovable, memorable characters propel this heartwarming story, which makes you laugh while it makes you think, then sticks with you long after the last vibrant page is savored.\"\n\nLynn Cullen, bestselling author of Twain's End and Mrs. Poe\n\n\"The Turner sisters come tumbling out of this terrific story, full of life, passion and trouble. Forced into a life in vaudeville, the four young girls and their mother push the boundaries of propriety to achieve their dreams in a world that doesn’t often allow women to have dreams. Gert and Winnie shine as each, in her own way, fights for her right to be who she is. A great piece of historical fiction that rings true one hundred years later.\"\n\nB.A. Shapiro, NYT bestselling author of The Muralist and The Art Forger\n\n\"Evoking the entrepreneurial, madcap era of vaudeville, Juliette Fay immerses us in the trials, joys, and dangers of three young women, whose bid for success is as uproarious and heartbreaking as the time in which they lived.\"\n\n--C.W. Gortner, bestselling author of Mademoiselle Chanel\n\n“The Tumbling Turner Sisters explores vaudeville with stunning humanity and sharp humor. Juliette Fay’s novel of sisters forced by their ultimate stage mother into this show business world of fanciful facade hiding cutthroat innards reveals America—from Jim Crow laws to skirting prohibition. Like Little Women, these four sisters, facing loss and poverty, reveal a family with an unbreakable core of fortitude and love.”\n\nRandy Susan Meyers, bestselling author of Accidents of Marriage\n\n\"As colorful as its vaudeville setting, The Tumbling Turner Sisters made me laugh, cry, and clap my hands with delight as I cheered on these four lovable and spunky sisters. A big-hearted tale of adventure.\"\n\n--Ann Mah, author of Mastering the Art of French Eating\n\n\"Packed with lively characters and charming detail, Juliette Fay's thoughtful prose sheds light on an almost forgotten part of entertainment history.\"\n\n--Allie Larkin, bestselling author of Stay and Why I Can’t Be You\n\n“The Tumbling Turner Sisters takes you on a wild ride through the glory days of vaudeville, following Winnie and Gert as they hit the gritty floorboards of backwater theaters, pick themselves up, and strive again toward laughter-filled heights. The prose is riveting as the sisters carry their family out of poverty in a time of racially charged political turmoil. Through Juliette Fay’s multilayered characters, I feel the sisters’ entanglements and passions as if they were my own.”\n\n--E. B. Moore, author of An Unseemly Wife and Stones in the Road\n\n“An absorbing and heartfelt tale of four sisters in desperate contortions to keep their family aloft. I loved this slice of theatrical history, and Fay’s meticulous research brings to life the vivid playhouses and costumed performers — ingénues and divas, swindlers and sots. I stayed awake far too late wondering whether the girls would come in for a safe landing.”\n\n--Nichole Bernier, author of The Unfinished Work of Elizabeth D.\n\nYou can buy THE TUMBLING TURNER SISTERS on Amazon here.\n\nLearn more about Juliette on her website.\n\nFollow Juliette on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nANNE FRAISER\n\nAnne Frasier writes fiction and nonfiction in the genres of suspense, mystery, thriller, romantic suspense, paranormal, and memoir.

Clarke’s Nebula Award–winning novella “A Meeting with Medusa,” this novel continues the thrilling adventure of astronaut Howard Falcon, humanity’s first explorer of Jupiter from two modern science fiction masters.\n\nHoward Falcon almost lost his life in an accident as the first human astronaut to explore the atmosphere of Jupiter—and a combination of human ingenuity and technical expertise brought him back. But he is no longer himself. Instead, he has been changed into an augmented human: part man, part machine, and exceptionally capable.\n\nWith permission from the Clarke Estate, Stephen Baxter and Alastair Reynolds continue this beloved writer’s enduring vision and have created a fresh story for new readers. The Medusa Chronicles charts Falcon’s journey through the centuries granted by his new body, but always back to mysteries of Jupiter and the changing interaction between humanity and the universe. A compelling read full of incredible action right from the beginning, this is a modern classic in the spirit of 2001 and The Martian.\n\n\"A worthy sequel to a classic.\"\n\n--Jack McDevitt , Bestselling and Nebula award-winning author of SEEKER and STARHAWK\n\n\"Two of the most acclaimed contemporary hard SF writers successfully team up in this ambitious epic space opera, spanning almost 800years, that expands the themes raised by Arthur C. Clarke’s classic 1971novella, A Meeting withMedusa. Clarke’s hero, Howard Falcon, suffered horrific injuries in anaccident in 2080, surviving only by cybernetic surgery; his new abilities ledhim to a successful search for extraterrestrial life and positioned him to bean “ambassador... between the creatures of carbon and the creatures of metal.”That unsought status tests Falcon as, over the centuries, robots begin tobecome self-aware and seek autonomy. Humankind’s expansion of its reach beyondEarth provides more opportunity for conflict, and the authors do a superior jobof predicting plausible political developments. The novel’s reach does come atthe expense of some psychological depth, but fans of the authors’ other workwon’t be disappointed.\"\n\n--Publishers Weekly *STARRED REVIEW* May 2, 2016\n\nYou can buy THE MEDUSA CHRONICLES on Amazon here.\n\nLearn more about Stephen on his website and Alastair on his website.\n\nFollow Alastair on Twitter.\n\nMISHELL BAKER\n\nMishell Baker is a 2009 graduate of the Clarion Fantasy & Science Fiction Writers’ Workshop.

The Library at Mount Char is his first novel.\n\nABOUT THE LIBRARY AT MOUNT CHAR\n\nCarolyn's not so different from the other people around her. She likes guacamole and cigarettes and steak. She knows how to use a phone. Clothes are a bit tricky, but everyone says nice things about her outfit with the Christmas sweater over the gold bicycle shorts.\n\nAfter all, she was a normal American herself once.\n\nThat was a long time ago, of course. Before her parents died. Before she and the others were taken in by the man they called Father.\n\nIn the years since then, Carolyn hasn't had a chance to get out much. Instead, she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient customs. They've studied the books in his Library and learned some of the secrets of his power. And sometimes, they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God.\n\nNow, Father is missing—perhaps even dead—and the Library that holds his secrets stands unguarded. And with it, control over all of creation.\n\nAs Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her, all of them with powers that far exceed her own.\n\nBut Carolyn has accounted for this.\n\nAnd Carolyn has a plan.\n\nThe only trouble is that in the war to make a new God, she's forgotten to protect the things that make her human.\n\nPopulated by an unforgettable cast of characters and propelled by a plot that will shock you again and again, The Library at Mount Char is at once horrifying and hilarious, mind-blowingly alien and heartbreakingly human, sweepingly visionary and nail-bitingly thrilling—and signals the arrival of a major new voice in fantasy.\n\n“Wholly original…the work of the newest major talent in fantasy.”\n\n—Wall Street Journal\n\n\"Freakishly compelling...through heart-thumping acts of violence and laugh-out-loud moments, this book practically dares you to keep reading.\"\n\n--Atlanta Magazine\n\nAn engrossing fantasy world full of supernatural beings and gruesome consequences.\"\n\n--Boston Globe\n\n\"Vivid...the dialogue sings...you'll spend equal time shuddering and chortling.\"\n\n--Dallas Morning News\n\n“A spellbinding story of world-altering power and revenge…Hawkins has created a fascinating, unusual world in which ordinary people can learn to wield breathtaking power—and he's also written a compelling story about love and revenge that never loses sight of the human emotions at its heart.

Platoon sergeant Andrew Grayson must crash-course train new volunteers—all while dulling his searing memories of battle with alcohol and meds.\n\nKnowing Earth’s uneasy respite won’t last, the North American Commonwealth and its Sino-Russian allies hurtle toward two dangerous options: hit the Lanky forces on Mars or go after deserters who stole a fleet of invaluable warships critical to winning the war.
