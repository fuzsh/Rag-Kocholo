DUE OUT FEBRUARY 13, 2018\n\nAmazon US (ebook, print, Audible, MP3 audio, CD audio)\n\nBarnes & Noble (HARDCOVER)\n\nHARPERCOLLINS (HARDCOVER/EBOOK)\n\nFANFICTION: https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/rachel-caine/honor-among-thieves.htm\n\nJOURNEY OF A BOOKSELLER: http://bkfaerie.blogspot.ca/2018/01/honor-among-thieves-by-rachel-caine-ann.html\n\nAPPLE TUNES: https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/honor-among-thieves/id1229856573?mt=11\n\nPUBLISHER’S WEEKLY: https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-06-257099-4\n\nABOUT THE BOOK:\n\nZara Cole has been in and out of New Detroit’s rehab facilities for treatment of her antisocial disorder. There’s no adjusting Zara’s attitude, though. A painful past has made her stronger than most, which is why she chose life in the Zone instead moving with her family to Mars. In her eyes, living inside a dome isn’t much better than a prison cell.\n\nStill, when Zara commits a crime that has her running scared, jail might be exactly where she’s headed. Instead Zara is recruited into the Honors, an elite team of humans selected by the Leviathan–a race of sentient alien ships—to explore the outer reaches of the universe as their passengers.\n\nZara seizes the chance to flee Earth’s dangers, but when she meets Nadim, the alien ship she’s assigned to along with fellow Honor Beatriz, Zara starts to feel at home for the first time, along with a devotion she’s never experienced before. Yet nothing—not her Honors training or her street smarts—could have prepared her for the dark, dangerous truths that lurk behind the glitter of starlight.\n\nHonor Among Thieves is the first book in a daring new sci-fi series by bestselling authors Rachel Caine and Ann Aguirre.\n\nBOOK EXCERPT:\n\nI feel the stars.\n\nEnergy pulses against my skin, murmuring secrets about this small galaxy, about orbits and alignments and asteroids streaming in space. Impulse makes me want to dive and swim those currents, but I control these urges.\n\nI shift my attention to the flutters of life within my skin.\n\nMarko glows orange with crimson streaks. He is warm, always the easiest to find. Just now, he stands and stares at the blue-green orb swirling below us. I cannot swim down to see what he remembers of this place. The planet’s gravitational pull would break my bones. But he shows me flashes: smiling faces, a field of flowers, an old woman with eyes like slices of sky.\n\n“I’ll miss you,” I tell him.\n\nHe starts, surprised to hear me, as if he’s ever truly alone. “Me too. It was a good run.”\n\nHe once told me that it’s strange when we talk; he thinks I should find him as insignificant as he does the bacteria in his stomach. But I have had time to acclimate to the strangers in my system. I safeguard the small voices, as is my privilege and duty. There will be more to my life, but only when I’ve proven myself.\n\nThe stars sing again, this time in strong, seductive harmony. I resist their melody, but the call is growing stronger.\n\nDespite my passengers, I am empty in a way I cannot name. Marko tells me it is because our voyage is over; he calls this sadness. Perhaps I have learned this feeling from him. My first Honor gave me a human name, Nadim, and I have kept it safe, along with the other words and shapes and colors that shade my new existence. Like sadness.\n\nI do not like this low orbit, but I must wait. I have been ordered to wait.\n\nMy new Honors will come.\n\nBOOK REVIEWS:\n\n“This series opener from Caine (the Great Library series) and Aguirre (the Immortal Game trilogy) is both a thrilling SF novel and a deeply philosophical examination of the nature of love. Keenly wrought characters, imaginative world building, and an inventive plot engage and gratify while urging readers to stay curious, question authority, and fight injustice.”\n\n—Publishers Weekly, Starred Review\n\n“Ann Aguirre and Rachel Caine are the definition of a double threat. Honor Among Thieves is proof — pitch-perfect pacing and unexpected twists make it a heart-stopping thrill ride. I loved every minute of it!”\n\n—Kami Garcia, #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Beautiful Creatures & author of The Lovely Reckless\n\n“Caine and Aguirre’s immersive world and unforgettable characters will absolutely enthrall readers.”\n\n—Zoraida Cordova, author of Labyrinth Lost and the Vicious Deep trilogy\n\n“Honor Among Thieves is an action-packed novel sure to keep readers waiting impatiently on its sequel…a breath of fresh air to the YA community.”\n\n— Voice of Youth Advocates (VOYA)\n\n“Caine and Aguirre create a fresh and fascinating story of interspecies bonding, the power of music, and the effects of trauma on good creatures.”\n\n— ALA Booklist\n\n“This story about unconventional connections and conflicts both interpersonal and intergalactic is a satisfying first outing in a planned series that should appeal to fans of Yancey’s 5th Wave trilogy or of Morgan’s (or the CW’s) The 100.”\n\n— Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books\n\n“I very much enjoyed reading Honor Among Thieves and would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, science fiction, and other action-y novels.”\n\n— Vicky Who Reads\n\nBOOK TRAILER: HERE\n\nRACHEL CAINE\n\nABOUT RACHEL CAINE\n\nCHECK OUT HER YOUTUBE CHANNEL HERE\n\nRachel Caine is the #1 internationally bestselling author of fifty novels, including the New York Times bestselling Morganville Vampires young adult series.
