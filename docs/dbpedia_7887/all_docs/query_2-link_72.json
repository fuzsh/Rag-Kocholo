        "text": "I chose the book Enclave by Ann Aguirre. This book is about a post-apocalyptic dystopia where Deuce is a Huntress trainee in the tunnels beneath the long-fallen ruins of New York City. Like the rest of the Hunters, Deuce wants only to provide her city with meat and protect it from the zombie like Freaks. In the novel Deuce is living under the protection of a very controlling communist type government. Who partners up Deuce and Fade, an outsider to the enclave. Who doesn’t really fit with the clan. Soon the two are banished and must embark on a new adventure, to the abandoned city Topside. Up there, they need a whole new set of survival skills to protect them against everything from sunlight to violent gangs of rapists and thugs—not to mention the ever-present and growing packs of Freaks. The two are fighting to survive to get to a safe place but are forced into unlikely alliances and new acquaintances. As the story progresses we see the protagonists Deuce and Fade learn to work together and form a strong bond. In the beginning Deuce hated Fade they were incompatible, they failed to be a team. But out all alone they realised to work together and seemed to accept the change in there lives. I learned that in desperate times people need to stick together, and how much trust and leadership play a role in making or breaking a strong society. For example the elders in the enclave. Who strived to keep their citizens complacent and obedient by using control, fear tactics, etc. and the government typically hid any signs or relics from the past in order to lie and confuse their citizens about what the world used to be like. Here we can see the power of blind trust the elders had earned over the years when it became a make or break situation very early on in the plot. Speaking of the plot, in my book Enclave there have been moments of excitement but as a whole, it seems pretty unoriginal. There’s been a trend to write dystopia fiction where the futuristic setting actually mimics primitive surroundings, humans are reduced to an uncivilized state in order to survive, there’s a strong heroine who is skillyfully capable of defending herself and others, most of the society is being controlled by a communist-type government which invokes fear in its citizens to keep them in their control at all times. I wanted to like this book. After reading numerous reviews comparing Enclave to Hunger Games and Divergent, I couldn’t wait to devour another exciting novel. Unfortunately, this book fell flat. The characters are not well-developed. I never really bonded with Deuce since we have no specific information concerning her former family, the lack of any real detailed interactions with those she considered her close friends. Moreover In Enclave, Deuce and Fade are frequently attacked by Freaks…smarter Freaks….hungry Freaks….a large number of Freaks…Freaks with the ability to reason…again and again. There’s no real creativity in the conflict Deuce, Fade, and the Enclave face beyond attacks from this mutant species. Even the names given to different groups in the novel, such as Breeders, Brats, and Freaks, lack originality. And the more I read the book I could see a pattern evolving. Nothing new happened after every turn freaks would appear and I lost interest in the book. But overall I love the book and the plot and I give it a 4/5 and I recommend it to everyone especially if you are a hunger games , maze runner type fan.\n\nMy Passage analysis:"
