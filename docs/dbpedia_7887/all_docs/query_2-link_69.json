        "text": "Population control is destroying the world! Ann Aguirre in her dystopian book “Enclave” shows the community as an organism made of four parts which are running it. There are breeders which produce children; they have hunters who hunt for food and the builders who build houses and everything else. Also there is elders who judge and punish people. The people who are sick or disabled are killed as well as their parents. That is because the people are not as intelligent and can’t make the medical help better, the people are very afraid of the elders and can’t have their own thought, and the world is full of creeps witch kill and eat whatever they find. The book Enclave is an example of social commentary, because it talks about Population control, creates awareness, and makes people want to take actions. The Population control is cause for the world destruction which is shown in a dystopian book “Enclave” by Ann Aguirre by showing the Community control done by the government, which is killing and controlling the population count and controlling the people in the Enclave with fear. That is proven on page 4. “One in the Enclave can’t have much independent thought and if you say something, you can see how you fare in topside” (Aguirre, 4). …show more content…\n\nThat is shown in the beginning of the book”Enclave”. “We lost so many newborns and children that we called all the brats Boy or Girl along with a number”(Aguirre 9). Also The people are killed during the naming ceremony by infections and other diseases that is proven in the book “Enclave”.”everyone who had survived the naming ceremony”(Aguirre 8). The second quote is mysterious and creates awareness that not a lot of children survive the naming ceremony. Both the cruelty and despair coming from the book make humankind want to take actions to help the people of Enclave which makes the book an example of a social commentary"
