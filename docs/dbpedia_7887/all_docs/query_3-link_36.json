        "text": "The Catholic Charismatic Renewal has reached over 160 million Catholics throughout the world. The first structures formed within the Catholic Charismatic Renewal were called “service committees,” and Pentecost Today USA (NSC) was the first of these service committees.\n\nFounding members began working together soon after the 1967 Duquesne Weekend at The Ark and The Dove in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania, which many see as the birthplace of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal. Pentecost Today USA (NSC) was officially formed in 1970 and incorporated in 1971 and has headquarters at The Ark and The Dove. Further information can be found at: www.PentecostTodayUSA.org"
