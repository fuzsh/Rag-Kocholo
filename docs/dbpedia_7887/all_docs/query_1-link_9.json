        "text": "You’ve written well over 20 plus books over the years. Was there one that gave you more trouble than others?\n\nI’ve published over forty novels since 2007. My husband was seriously ill this year. He spent time in ICU on an incubator. To be honest, I don’t know how I got my work done during that time. It was difficult, but I did keep pushing forward incrementally. I was working on two projects concurrently, Bitterburn and Witch Please. I managed to finish both of them, but those books were probably the hardest for me to complete. Thankfully, Andres improved and he’s doing well now, and readers can look forward to those stories.\n\nEach of your series’ have been different lengths. What’s the planning process like for the Sirantha Jaxseries, which has six, compared to Immortal Game, which has three?\n\nI had no idea how long the Jax series would be. In the beginning, I wanted to sell as many books possible; I also didn’t want to write twenty novels with characters I’d grown tired of. Readers deserve my best, my most passionate and enthusiastic work. While I admire writers who can stay with characters for the long haul, my attention span is too short. Six is the longest series for me because I’m always looking for the shiny and new. Writing trilogies or standalones allows me to pursue new interests without disappointing my readers. Over the years, I’ve learned what works best for me and it’s better for my longevity, helping me avoid burnout. In terms of planning, I know what my rough story arc is and how many books I’ll take to get there. Before I start writing, I have the book’s start and end point firmly in mind. Everything in between, I figure out as I go.\n\nHow long were you a part-time writer before you became a full-time one?\n\nSince I was eight. I wrote my first story then, my first novel at fifteen. It took me twenty years to be published, but persistence pays off. There’s no guarantee of success if a writer perseveres, there’s definitely no shot if they quit.\n\nWhat does literary success look like to you?\n\nMoney is one metric. Making bestseller lists is another. Both are nice, but these days, I care most about writing stories I’m excited about. When I finish a book that comes out exactly as I envisioned and my readers love it, that’s the hallmark of success, one that never fails to put a smile on my face. And when I get feedback from readers, telling me that my story moved them or helped them through a tough time, that’s priceless.\n\nThe names in Enclave are extremely unique. What gave you the idea for the naming ceremony?\n\nIn the past, when the infant mortality rate was so high, pioneer families often didn’t name their children until it was clear they would survive past young childhood. That’s why there are old graves marked with names like “Bub” or “Baby Girl Gleason.” They’d use a nickname instead and only formally christen the child when they lived past the danger point. I unspooled that. I figured the infant mortality rate would be high in an underground society too. Many societies have coming of age rituals with a cultural or religious component and many receive an adult name as a rite of passage. There’s also a tradition in Korea on a child’s first birthday where they offer the child a range of objects to see which one the child gravitates toward, as a predictor of their future. Like if the baby is offered a gavel, a stethoscope, and a spoon, grabbing the gavel means they’re destined to be a judge. I thought it would be cool if the College enclave residents got their names that way—from the pile of gifts offered on their naming day.\n\nWhat is the most difficult part about writing for you?\n\nThe writing. That sounds flippant, but seriously, creating something from nothing is tough. I love revisions, where I polish what already exists. There’s nothing more frustrating than having a scene in your head that won’t come out the way you’re imagining it. I suspect it might be like that for an artist too, when you have a picture on your head but your skill can’t get it on canvas the same way. At any rate, it’s exhausting to draft a book, but edits are fun.\n\nWhat is the most surprising thing you discovered while writing the Razorland Trilogy?\n\nI came across fascinating information regarding the longevity of canned goods. One anecdote relates that a can of veal, which was more than a hundred years old and had gone on an Arctic expedition with William Parry in 1820, was opened in 1938 and fed to a cat. In a similar case, the steamboat Bertrand sank in the Missouri River in 1865 due to excessive weight of its provisions. It was recovered north of Omaha, Nebraska, in 1968. Among the goods were cans of brandied peaches, oysters, plum tomatoes, honey, and mixed vegetables. Chemists analyzed the food for spoilage and nutrition; though it wasn’t fresh anymore, it was still all as safe to eat as when it was canned. That’s surprising, right? I had no idea canned goods would be edible after more than a hundred years!\n\nDid publishing your books change your writing process?\n\nYes. I don’t have time to tinker. I need to get the book done and move on. It’s a relief, TBH.\n\nYou’ve written under the pen name Ava Gray; was there a specific reason you had wanted to use a pseudonym?\n\nThat wasn’t my decision. I was told that I should separate my romances because if I’m writing young adult, I need another name for the sexy stuff. But it’s a lot of work maintaining two websites. I don’t write young adult anymore because my kids are in their twenties and my impetus has changed. I started writing YA for them, because they asked me to, and now they’re grown and reading other genres."
