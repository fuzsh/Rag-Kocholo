        "text": "In 1819, when ten-year-old Louis Braille began his studies at the Royal Institution for Blind Youth in Paris, students were taught to read books that used embossed print letters. Reading was very slow and it was impossible to write anything by hand. After an army captain visited the school and demonstrated “night writing,” Braille was inspired. Night writing was created to allow soldiers to communicate silently on the battlefield using a raised-dot alphabet. Louis Braille found the system complicated and modified it, developing the six-dot cell that is still in use today.\n\nThe original format for braille was a letter-to-letter translation from print. A system using contractions was later developed to make reading faster and books less bulky. In 1932 contracted braille was adopted as the braille code for the English-speaking world.\n\nToday readers who are new to braille sometimes find it easier to learn uncontracted braille as a first step. This minibibliography presents the English-language uncontracted braille titles produced by NLS. Included are numerous short works like Flash Fiction, a collection of very short stories, none more than 750 words and anthologies of myths and legends, novels, and nonfiction. They may be requested from your network library. The digital titles can be downloaded on the Braille and Audio Reading Download (BARD), which allows registered patrons to download digital books and magazines.\n\nContents\n\nFiction\n\nNonfiction\n\nFiction\n\nThe books of the Razorland Trilogy by Ann Aguirre should be read in the following order:\n\nEnclave\n\nby Ann Aguirre\n\nIn a post-apocalyptic future, Deuce, a huntress, brings back meat while avoiding the deadly Freaks outside her underground enclave.
