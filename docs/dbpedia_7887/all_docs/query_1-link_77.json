A visitation with family will be held at 5:00 PM, Friday, April 21, 2023, words of Love and Faith will be given by her youth minister, Tino Hernandez at 6:00 PM, and a rosary service will be held at 7:00 PM at Heartland Funeral Home in Early. Catholic Mass service will be held at 9:30 AM, Saturday, April 22, 2023 in St. Mary Queen of Peace Catholic Church, Brownwood, Texas with burial to follow at Cedar Point Cemetery.\n\nAriel was born July 2, 2001 in San Angelo, Texas to Alfred and Amy Aguirre. She was always a loving child with a big heart who loved to go to church and be involved in the church youth group. Ariel graduated from Brownwood High School and attended college at Angelo State University where she met Juan Martinez, fell in love and got married. Juan and Ariel married September 28, 2020 in Leakey, Texas and made a home in Leakey. Ariel was a homemaker and mother to their son, Lucas Martinez. She was a very involved mother who was always teaching Lucas new things. She loved the outdoors and animals, so she would plan adventures in the outdoors that the family could take all together. Ariel enjoyed photography, giraffes and sunflowers, hiking, animals and movies, but her favorite thing was being wife to Juan and mom to Lucas, the rock of their family.\n\nAriel is survived by her husband, Juan Martinez of Leakey, Texas; son, Lucas Martinez of Leaky; mother, Amy Brummett of Brownwood; sister, Ariah Aguirre of Brownwood; brothers, Mathew Aguirre, Freddy Aguirre, Isaac Aguirre and Joshua Aguirre all of Brownwood; and many cousins and friends.\n\nAriel was preceded in death by her grandparents, Walter and Frances Brummett"
