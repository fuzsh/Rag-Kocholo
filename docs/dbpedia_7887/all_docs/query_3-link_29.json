        "text": "Lenín Moreno was born in the town of Nuevo Rocafuerte, which is currently part of Orellana, so Isabel won $200.\n\nHowever, producers were later made aware that when Lenín Moreno was born in 1953, Nuevo Rocafuerte was part of the province of Napo Pastaza. In 1960, Napo Pastaza was divided into two, and Nuevo Rocafuerte was part of the canton of Aguarico, which was deemed part of the new Province of Napo. Orellana became a canton in the boundary reforms of 1969, and the current arrangement regarding Orellana being a province did not come into force until further reforms in 1998.\n\nDue to this ambiguity, it was decided that the question had two correct answers, Napo being one of the correct ones. Isabel was then given a new $400 question."
