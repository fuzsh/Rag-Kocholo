        "text": "May 1966\n\nHarlan Bryant, Ph.D., presides over the creation of MSU Denver as acting president.\n\nBryant, who was president of Western State College in Gunnison, Colorado, at the time, had helped prepare the proposal for the creation of MSU Denver known as the “Green Report.” He was about to leave on a camping trip when he got the call inviting him to oversee the creation of a new college. Each week during his four-month tenure, Bryant worked up to 14 hours a day preparing for the launch.\n\nJune 13, 1965\n\nTom Cook is the first teacher at MSU Denver\n\nCook was working in broadcast media when he became a charter member of the faculty. He established the first broadcasting curriculum in Colorado, received the Distinguished Faculty Award in 1983 and earned the Distinguished Service Award in 1988. He died in September 2002.\n\n1966\n\nKenneth Phillips, Ph.D., is named first president of MSU Denver\n\nDuring his six-year tenure, Phillips made it his mission to talk with anyone who would listen about the new college, and enrollment increased to more than 7,200. He also began the conversation about finding a campus for MSU Denver, as it was quickly outgrowing the downtown buildings that had served as its first home.
