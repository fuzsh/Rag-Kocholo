        "text": "Summary:\n\nThe horde is coming.\n\nSalvation is surrounded, monsters at the gates, and this time, they're not going away. When Deuce, Fade, Stalker and Tegan set out, the odds are against them. But the odds have been stacked against Deuce from the moment she was born. She might not be a Huntress anymore, but she doesn't run. With her knives in hand and her companions at her side, she will not falter, whether fighting for her life or Fade's love.\n\nAhead, the battle of a lifetime awaits. Freaks are everywhere, attacking settlements, setting up scouts, perimeters, and patrols. There hasn't been a war like this in centuries, and humans have forgotten how to stand and fight. Unless Deuce can lead them.\n\nThis time, however, more than the fate of a single enclave or outpost hangs in the balance. This time, Deuce carries the banner for the survival of all humanity.\n\nRelease Date: October 29, 2013\n\nAge Group: YA\n\nSource: Review copy from publisher\n\nReviewed By: Kelli\n\nReview:\n\nI've had Horde sitting on my \"to read\" book shelf for months now, and after finally reading it, all I can think is \"Why did I wait so long to read this awesome book?\" Horde was definitely the best book of the Razorland trilogy; and also an all-time favorite read for me.\n\nI love the world Aguirre has created. It's unique, terrifying and exciting. She ended Outpost with a promise to explain how the Freaks came to be and to finally give us some answers about their existence. I've been wondering for years about the Freaks: are they vampires? Animals? Mutations of humans? Some kind of zombies? I'm so pleased to say that Aguirre delivered on her promise and every question I had about the Freaks was answered to perfection!\n\nHorde is still Deuce's story; however, she's not the same girl who grew up underground. She's grown and changed so much throughout the series, softening up in many ways, getting tougher in others. I've loved watching her growth as a character, and seeing her become a more well-rounded character has been very gratifying.\n\nAguirre's pacing is just right in Horde. There's a lot of action, but not so much that the book feels too focused on fighting. I'm not a lover of fight scenes, but they could not be avoided with this story, and Aguirre spreads them out to make the story feel balanced.\n\nI'm not going to include spoilers in this review, but I will say that Horde went in a direction I was completely not expecting. At first, I was put off by how the story was wrapping up; but I soon came to understand it really was the perfect conclusion to the story, with an emphasis on kindness and humility, and the general goodness of human nature.\n\nI finished this book with a smile on my face. It's going to be hard to let go of the characters I've come to love throughout the Razorland series; but at the same time, I'm thrilled to see what Aguirre comes up with next!"
