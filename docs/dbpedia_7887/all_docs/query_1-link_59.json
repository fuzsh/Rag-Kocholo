        "text": "Just Kept Getting Better and Better!\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nAbsolutely! I really liked this book and loved the series. I thought it was just going to be about the Enclave. And to tell the truth that was my least favorite part. But then, (spoiler alert) Deuce goes \"topside\" and an entire new phase of the book begins. This series spans so many different locations it really keeps it interesting.\n\nWhat does Emily Bauer bring to the story that you wouldnâ€™t experience if you just read the book?\n\nThe passion of Deuce. Other reviews mention the narrator's high pitched voice bothering them. I completely disagree. The main character is 15 when the book starts so should not have been told by a grown woman with a deep voice. Emily Bauer did a wonderful job reading as Deuce in the first person. Especially when Deuce showed pride of being \"a huntress\". Personally if I had read the book, I wouldn't have put so much life into the character and her attitude and personality would have been lost.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nYes. I even started listening at work with headphones.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nDefinitely don't pass up Outpost and Horde. The books keep getting better and better until the very end, which left me smiling.\n\nOne of my new favorites!\n\nWhat made the experience of listening to Enclave the most enjoyable?\n\nAnn Aguirre combines the best elements of a story: an exciting plot, dynamic characters and a great ending. I couldn't put this series down. Duece and Fade are a great pair and this series kept me wondering the whole time. I am thankful to say I loved it from beginning to end. Ann Aguirre has become one of my new favorite authors.\n\nWhat other book might you compare Enclave to and why?\n\nIt is a distopian book and therefore could be compared to Divergent or the Hunger Games but in my opinion is much better. Duece is a much stronger character. Katniss could be annoying and Tris sometimes didn't make sense.\n\nWhat does Emily Bauer bring to the story that you wouldnâ€™t experience if you just read the book?\n\nEmily Bauer has an interesting voice and to be honest at first it took a little getting used to but she brought the story alive for me. I enjoy listening to stories so much more than reading them.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nYes, I couldn't put it down.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nLoved the whole series!!!\n\nSo close to perfection\n\nWhere does Enclave rank among all the audiobooks youâ€™ve listened to so far?\n\nI've only listened to a handful of audiobooks so far, but Enclave is definitely up at the top.\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nThe story was good, if a little confusing at times. The characters sometimes seemed a little unreal, but that was part of the reality to the world created by Aguirre. Something happened topside, and people were forced down below for safety from the dystopian universe. Then, decades go by and new generations don't even know any of the old ways. So, it was a very intriguing story. We go from underground, to questioning the new ways, to topside, with a healthy dose of suspense, intensity, and danger mixed throughout.\n\nHave you listened to any of Emily Bauerâ€™s other performances before? How does this one compare?\n\nI haven't listened to any of the narrator's other performances. But this one was fine.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nI did want to keep listening. The whole story was so fresh and unique that I couldn't wait to want to know what would happen next (even if I was good at predicting what would happen).\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nNice little romance that wasn't overwhelming or overbearing to the story--it just sort of wove in without being forced. Seemed realistic enough.\n\nYou'll get used to the Narrator\n\nAny additional comments?\n\nThis series is amazing. It is real, dark, funny, a story of redemption.... it's honestly great. It is the best series I have read since Hunger Games and I have read them all.\n\nThe narrator is awful. Just Awful and does Deuce no justice but you get used to her and then it's not nearly as bad. I get it- I almost stopped because of her too but it's worth it to keep going. I promise.\n\nGood YA Dystopian Fiction\n\nWould you listen to Enclave again? Why?\n\nYes, but mainly because I would need a refresher before diving into the next book in the series.\n\nWhat did you like best about this story?\n\nI thought the story was relatively unique, or at least as unique as most YA dystopian fiction. I thought it had some good twists and the characters had some real depth and I found myself wanting to know more about them. The \"freaks\" were a little too fantasy for me, but otherwise the world was believable and the relationships felt real. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this genre.\n\nExciting!\n\nENCLAVE is fantastic. It was like a movie in my mind. For being a relatively short book, it covers A LOT and the journey is incredibly exciting. Deuce has worked her whole life to be a Huntress. Itâ€™s all sheâ€™s ever wanted. Sheâ€™s brave and strong for a New Blood. She lives by the rules. Then she gets partnered with Fade (how cool is his name?!). Heâ€™s not like everyone else and Deuce isnâ€™t sure how to deal with him. He makes her second guess everything sheâ€™s ever been taught and awakens a new understanding within her.\n\nIâ€™m completely impressed with Ann Aguirreâ€™s imagination and ability to create post-apocalyptic magic. I was enthralled by the story and attached to the characters. Iâ€™m rooting for them in every way.\n\nGripping Story and Interesting Worldbuilding\n\nI greatly enjoyed this first book. It was a pleasure to read a story with a strong lead female character and a more thoughtful and reticent male character. The story progressed well and there was a lot of interesting action throughout. Quite a few sections of the book are so riveting that it would be hard to stop listening!\n\nI've listened to both the first and the second books in this series and it was very pleased with both the world and the character building. I'm greatly looking forward to the next book in the series as a result!"
