"The Life I Lead" is a song from the film Mary Poppins. It was composed by the Sherman Brothers and sung by George Banks.

In the film[]

The song serves as the introductory one as well as the leitmotif for George and is performed by him as he is walking home from work. It describes the punctual, efficient, but distant way in which he runs his household. Through it, he reveals that he likes order and consistency, going so far as to mention specific times for when events must happen. One lyric contains the only reference to the time period of the film, 1910 England during the reign of King Edward VII.

The song is later reprised several times. At one point, Mary Poppins sings a verse from it. It also appears near the end, in a much more somber tone. George performs it after he thinks that his dreams have been shattered.
