        "text": "Strophic: A A A A A A (most folk music)\n\nRondo: A B A C A D A\n\nTheme & Variation: A A’ A’’ A’’’ A’’’’ etc.\n\nAccounting for variation:\n\nWhen a section repeats but is slightly modified from its original format, it is referred to as PRIME. So section “A” becomes “A Prime,” “A Double Prime,” and so forth to distinguish each new variation of A that is not the same as the original. It is written out with an apostrophe (see Theme & Variation above) for each new variation of the section.\n\nRHYTHM\n\n“Blinding Lights” clocks in at 172 BPM, which is extraordinarily fast for a pop song. Throughout, the tempo stays steady without slowing or speeding. The beats are grouped in sets of four which means it is in quadruple meter and the subdivision of the beats is in even sets of two, so more specifically, simple quadruple meter. For those with some previous music knowledge, this would be identified as 4/4 time.\n\nMELODY\n\nThe melody of “Blinding Lights” is in minor; but notice that it only sounds “melancholy” rather than sad, this is because it’s using a form of C Pentatonic Minor (C Eb F G Bb) that removes several of the traditional minor intervals, so it sounds too hollow to be truly minor. Untrained ears would certainly not need to get that specific - but knowing it is in minor is important. The contour of the melody is flat-falling through the first half of the verses and flat-rising through the second half. The choruses have a rising-falling motion.\n\nHARMONY\n\nThere is very limited harmony in this song, mostly relying on unison (voice and synth) or solo (voice or synth) lines and “power chords” (open parallel fifth intervals) rather than full triad chords. The harmony is consonant and minor.\n\nTIMBRE\n\nFirst, make sure you’ve identified all the instruments/voices that are present in this track (that’s called INSTRUMENTATION). Then, decide what kind of adjectives describe each instrument or voice you hear. The Weeknd’s timbre is breathy, mellow, and velvety. He sounds calm and cool even though the lyrics imply a crisis. The synthesizer sounds warm, thin, ringing with quite a lot of reverb at the end of lines. The drum machine’s timbre is thin, shimmery, and cutting in direct contrast with the synth and voice. Notice that every timbral choice on this track was made to connect with a 1980’s synth-pop nostalgia. It sounds very much like the Stranger Things soundtrack or other “throwback” songs that are popular in current pop music trends.\n\nDYNAMICS\n\nThere is not much dynamic variety in “Blinding Lights”. The voice is continuously at a mezzo-forte volume while the background parts tend to be mezzo-piano, under the voice for support. When the voice is absent, the synthesizer increases in volume to take over the main melodic texture.\n\nTEXTURE\n\nThe texture of “Blinding Lights” is mostly homophonic because there is a single, solo singer with accompaniment. When the singer is not singing, the synthesizer becomes the melody. The additional voices serve as harmony or “call-response” echo, but the voices are never singing separate melodies at the same time.\n\nThere is one moment of polyphony at 3:05 when the singer and synthesizer each have different melodies at the same time. After the polyphonic moment, the singer and synthesizer finish the phrase in unison as the song ends.\n\nFORM\n\nAn easy way to predict form for music with lyrics is by looking at the lyrics written out. Often they are “chunked” out in sections and you can predict that each section will be a different letter in a form pattern. By seeing how the lyrics line up and number of lines per section, it can be easy to guess ahead of time what the form is before even hearing the song. Also, predicting that most radio songs will be in some kind of song form (ABAB) or modified song form is a good guess before you begin listening. For “Blinding Lights,” the song starts with a Hook (a short, ‘grabby’ introduction melody played by the synth). When the Weeknd’s voice enters on “I been tryna call …,” this is the first A section (and also the first verse). B begins at the chorus when the lyrics “I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights …” start. Following this first chorus, there is another synth Hook. Next is an A’ (A prime) at “I'm running out of time …” This would be considered A prime because it is shorter than the first A section. The chorus then happens two more times for B and B’ (the melody goes higher but it is still in the same format as the B chorus). The Hook synth melody sounds one more time and the song finishes with a B” (just the first two lines of the chorus).\n\n(Hook) A B (Hook) A’ B B’ (Hook) B’’"
