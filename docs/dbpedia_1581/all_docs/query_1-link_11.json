        "text": "Plan\n\nPremium\n\nCountry\n\nUSA\n\nDevice\n\niPhone 6 in combination with Windows 10 desktop player\n\nOperating System\n\niOS 12 / Windows 10\n\nMy Question or Issue\n\nI connect my bluetooth headphones to my phone to play music at work since my work computer doesn't have bluetooth. Then I use the desktop app as a \"remote\" to control playback through the phone. I have done this for months. Today while listening to the \"Brain Food\" playlist, spotify started skipping 20 to 30 seconds into each song after the previous song was done. This essentially makes Spotify unusable. I've never seen this behaviour before. I'm guessing there is a bug having to do with crossfading, which I have disabled. If it crossfaded the songs, but then actually failed to blend the songs and just started the second song where it -would- have been 100% that song after crossfade ended.\n\nHey @coolbackyard and welcome to the Community.\n\nHope you're doing great!\n\nThis is an expected behaviour on some playlists made by Spotify where songs are crossfaded.\n\nHowever, if you don't like this, I’d suggest starting a new thread in the Community Ideas Exchange.\n\nThis’ll allow users, Stars, and Moderators to vote and comment on it\n\nCorrect, songs get the first 20-30 seconds of them chopped off. I have crossfade disabled.\n\nI mentioned a bug with crossfade thinking a spotify developer could see that and know where in the algorithm to start looking for a bug. It appears that it \"thinks\" it needs to crossfade the songs, but then just starts the next song where a 20 to 30 second crossfade (which is a huuuge crossfade) would end and just the current song remains playing.\n\nHey @coolbackyard,\n\nSorry for the delay\n\nCould you check this playlist on another device or with another account to see if the same thing happens?\n\nAlso, would you mind sharing the link to it?\n\nPlease note that as I already mentioned some of playlists made by Spotify have this type of crossfade by default and it's tweaked by Spotify so there's no option to turn that off and this playlist you're listeting to might be one of them.\n\nThanks\n\nI've also noticed this issue, for example with the Spotify playlist \"Brain Food\" skipping the first 10-25 seconds of songs. I've used this playlist for the last few years and never noticed this before. It's also very interesting to me that this ONLY happens on some of these playlists. It's like there was an attempt to crossfade it, but as others mention, it just cuts off the beginnings of songs.\n\n* Platforms:\n\nMacOS - v1.1.5.153.gf614956d\n\nAndroid - v8.5.3.716\n\n* Cross-fade disabled\n\nI'm encountering this same issue on my iPhone XS Max with the Lo-Fi Beats playlist as well. It will play a song until it's end and then the next song starts playing by skipping the first 20 seconds in and not from the beginning. I just listened to this playlist yesterday and it was NOT having this issue\n\niOS version 12.2\n\nSpotify version 8.5.2.666\n\nEDIT: I just updated Spotify to version 8.5.3.784 on my phone and the issue persists. Have also encountered the issue when trying it on my Desktop app as well.\n\nI recently started experiencing the same thing in \"Lo-Fi Beats\". Sometimes it skips 40 seconds into the next song, with some crossfade for approximately 3-5 seconds. Happens both on my Mac and on my Android device. I used to have crossfade set to 1 second, and now I've turned the option completely off, and it still skips way into songs cutting them off.\n\nI've gone through a few songs and they systematically cuts off the intro to the songs, so this does seem to be an intentional feature.\n\nHere's a way to reproduce it:\n\nOpen the playlist [Lo-Fi Beats].\n\nGo to this song [chapter], skip to the last few seconds and experience it skipping to 35 seconds into the next song [Proud of You] even if you have crossfade explicitly turned off.\n\nCould we get an option to turn this feature off?\n\n[Lo-Fi Beats] https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWQRwui0ExPn?si=6kFzME-GTNmjEViUUOlH7w\n\n[chapter] https://open.spotify.com/track/79e0IMV7d0IgXrKQmCPspS?si=z86ITESORoGhAzIVK3uPlQ\n\n[Proud of You] https://open.spotify.com/track/6mRmaBAb8ysO3pcGDaegL2?si=kXqQHIC7RHWnkKgTDItEng\n\nSame problem, playlist Brain Food and Lo-Fi Beats. Very annoying! and keeps happening randomly for last months and now persists. Happens with crossfading on and off, after restart, reinstall and cleaning of cache in Windows and Android.\n\nAny ETA on a fix?\n\nIf I want a crossfade, I will set a crossfade in the settings. Don't decide for me Spotify!\n\nThis is not a bug, I spotted this also and after a google search I found this..\n\nhttps://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Partners-Web-Player-etc/Auto-crossfading-in-playlists-how-to-...\n\nIn short the reply to another user was:\n\nThanks for getting in touch!\n\nThere is some playlists we have created and mixed together for you. These playlists are auto crossfading and you can't switch this off. You can however drag all songs into one of your own playlists and decide if you'd like to cross fade or not.\n\nHope this helps. Let us know if you have further questions.\n\nHave a nice day!"
