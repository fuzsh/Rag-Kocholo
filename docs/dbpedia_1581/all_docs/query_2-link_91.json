We first introduce a new analytical tool, the *redemption curve*, which represents the redemption price as a function of redemption pressure. We use it to discuss historical de-peggings (e.g. in DAI, UST). We then describe a new dynamic redemption curve with desirable robustness properties and show how to implement a primary market based on this curve. The system is part of Gyroscope.",

        "text": "Dai Stablecoin\n\nThe process of developing the Dai Stablecoin System has matured significantly over the course of the last year. We innovated in the Ethereum community by being the first project to release a well-defined reference implementation, written in Haskell, for our proposed system. This effort has helped with the simplification of the system’s design, increased project efficiency, and has attracted the attention of formal verificiation specialists who now want to focus on Maker. It is becoming more and more likely that Maker will be the first non-trivial decentralized application to be formally verified before launch. In this proposed presentation, I would like to talk about the usefulness of rigorous specification and external reference implementations for the benefit of other Ethereum projects.\n\nA review of short term interest rates of tokens in the Ethereum Defi space, why they exist and how to interact with those smart contracts\n\nThis a review of the current interest rate economics in the Ethereum space. A quick look at loanscan.io will show tons of projects interacting with each other to create lending and borrowing opportunities. We are here to review why they exist and show on a practical level how to interact with these smart contracts. Most use cases will be earning a high-interest rate or getting a loan of a cryptocurrency.How do you make sure your money is safe, what risks are you taking, how is this different than lending/borrowing money in the \"real\" world? We will go through a practical example of taking USD and entering the crypto world, interacting with a smart contract and earning interest. The hope is to teach anyone to do this in 10 minutes.\n\nEconomics of Ethereum 2.0\n\nThis will be a presentation reviewing the Ethereum 2.0 Economics for an average validator. The talk will highlight the validator economics based on the current spec that can be expected for Phase 0 and Ethereum 2.0 at a mature state. The presentation will result in a call for community feedback on the proposed economics, which will be done through a public facing Ethereum 2.0 calculator built by the EF and ConsenSys.\n\nShouldn’t we rethink debt? What DeFi can learn from susu’s and immigrant lending clubs\n\nWith hundreds of millions collateralized in products like Compound Finance and Maker, the Ethereum community is rightfully rallying around #DeFi. Yet, one could easily draw portentous parallels to the systemic risks of financial innovations in the early 2000s: credit default swaps, hybrid securities, and so on. In this lightning talk I will implore our community to look toward another concept of lending used around the world: the susu. The susu (tanda in Latin America, hui in Asia, or a “rotating savings and credit association: ROSCA), is a type of short-term no-interest loan among members of a small community. Each person in the susu makes the same contribution to the pool of money, and on a rotating basis, one person receives the total amount added to the pool. I first encountered this concept when visiting my partner’s family in Trinidad and Tobago, and am studying how communities in NYC rely on these informal lending clubs to pay for a flight, a home down-payment, or just for fun. If Ethereum will bring greater financial access, we should focus less on imitating the sophisticated financial products of Wall Street and instead look to the ways that communities without financial access already get by.\n\nTransparent Dishonesty: Blockchain Front-running Taxonomy\n\nFront-running has been an issue in financial instrument markets since the 1970s. With the advent of the blockchain technology, front-running has resurfaced in new forms we explore here, instigated by blockchains decentralized and transparent nature. In this paper, we draw from a scattered body of knowledge and instances of front-running across the top 25 most active decentral applications (DApps) deployed on Ethereum blockchain, and an instance of abnormal behaviour of a mining pool to participate in an ICO. We also introduce a taxonomy of front-running attacks on blockchain and map the proposed solutions to front-running into useful categories. Published at Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2019: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.05164\n\nBlock building after the Merge\n\nWe are seeing the emergence of a specialized role on the Ethereum network dedicated to assembling the contents of each block as the ecosystem grows and the impact of \"maximum extractable value\" (MEV) becomes clear. This talk investigates block building after the Merge and what considerations the move to proof-of-stake brings to the process along with what norms we should strive for to avoid dangerous centralization pressures while maximizing validator profits.\n\nCompositionality: The 10x Engineer Secret Sauce\n\nProponents of blockchains argue that compositionality is a key feature. What is compositionality though? Maybe surprisingly, there is a rich mathematical framework in which the concept can be made precise as a theory of systems. In this workshop, we provide a primer of that theory and we showcase two practical applications based on it: compositionality in game theory (open games) and in formal verification (automata). The workshop is aimed at devs. There are no mathematical prerequisites.\n\nCryptoeconomics Dive: LP Volatility Harvesting Across Yield Rates\n\nThis talk furthers the concept of volatility harvesting. Currently, Uniswap and other major dexes see a huge part of their trading volume consist of the result of volatility in the market. Value changes and as a result, trading volume spikes and LPs profit. When extending yield, which is also quite a volatile concept, to AMMs, volatility harvesting is increased further to not only affect value but also the yield that value creates.\n\nEconomic Incentives and Souls in Schelling-point Based Oracles\n\nSchelling-point based oracles, such as Kleros, can be used to attribute soulbound tokens (SBTs) to individuals based on subjective evaluations of their backgrounds and expertise. Moreover, mechanisms using SBTs can complement economic incentives in such oracles; for example, an SBT-conscious random selection process can determine the voters on a given question. We will focus on how the interplay of economic and social elements in such systems can be designed to maximize resistance to attacks.\n\nEvaluating the PBS Experiment: Early insights from MEV-Boost and the Builder Market\n\nPBS is a major change to the core Ethereum protocol. It attempts to minimise negative effects of MEV by delegating block building to a market of block builders. This talk would cover what we have learned from the rollout of mev-boost, focusing on what is happening in the builder market, and what this means for the future of in-protocol PBS. What are the main improvements that we can make to the PBS design in response to how this prototype version is performing?\n\nThe Fight for MEV\n\nThe Fight for MEV is a talk that focuses on the two most \"famous\" MEV solutions designs, CowSwap and Flashbots. It will go over the differences in how each model is designed, and why each solution has made those choices (users, objectives). We will end on how we see the future at CowSwap in relation to the merge, MEV, and the overall Ethereum DeFi ecosystem."
