The regular series comprised a six-part serial called Doctor Who: Flux, which opened with The Halloween Apocalypse [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021). and concluded with The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021).. This was followed by a trilogy of specials in 2022: a New Year Special, Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).; an Easter Special, Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022).; and BBC Centenary Special The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., which celebrated BBC 100.\n\nIn July 2021, it was announced that both Chris Chibnall and Jodie Whittaker would be departing at the end of this series, making good on a private agreement between the two to leave the programme after three series.[1] On 20 July 2022, composer Segun Akinola announced on his social media platforms that he would also be leaving Doctor Who after production of the BBC Centenary Special.[2]\n\nAlthough initially reported in an announcement by Chibnall that this series would only contain 8 episodes[3], it was later announced that, in addition to the six episodes of the main series and two specials following in 2022 (similar to those at the end of David Tennant's run), a further feature-length special was in the works for the end of the era. Including this new \"trio of specials\", the total count was brought up to 9.[1] The reduced episode count from the usual 11 was due to constraints running a production during the COVID-19 pandemic.[3]\n\nAt San Diego Comic Con @ Home on 25 July 2021, it was also announced that the main series would follow a serialised format, meaning it would be one serial spanning six episodes[4], similar to Torchwood: Children of Earth (and most Doctor Who television stories prior to the 1996 TV Movie).\n\nAt a press event held on 19 October 2021, it was revealed that the main series would be comprise one single story known as Flux, which would be told over 'six episodes – or chapters, as they're going to be labelled' and 'changes the way we deal with characters – characters who go across more than one episode, monsters who go across more than one episode.'[5]\n\nA series of behind the scenes features were released to YouTube.\n\nThe series continued the ongoing storyline exploring the Doctor's past and the Timeless Child.\n\nThe series also explored a new subplot of the Doctor's TARDIS heavily malfunctioning and decaying over the course of the storyline, something that reached a conclusion in the New Year Special when the Doctor reset the TARDIS system.\n\nOverview\n\nStoryline continuation\n\nAccording to Chris Chibnall, the previous series finale Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020)./The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020). laid the groundworks of the storylines throughout this series.[6]\n\nOn 8 October 2020 at the live-streamed New York Comic-Con panel, Mandip Gill revealed that series 13 would delve deeper into Yasmin Khan's past and touch on \"mental health issues\".[7]\n\nOn 5 December 2020, Gill told Radio Times that while her co-stars, Bradley Walsh and Tosin Cole, felt ready to leave during the preceding New Year Special Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)., she was not ready to leave the TARDIS behind, saying there's still more to explore about Yaz's past and mental health.[8]\n\nOn 1 January 2021, following the broadcast of Cole and Walsh's final scenes, comedian John Bishop was officially announced in a teaser trailer as playing incoming companion, Dan.[9]\n\nIn an interview shared by the BBC on 24 October, Matt Strevens mentioned that series 13 would solve some loose ends from the reveal in the preceding series, saying that \"[series 13] picks up on a lot of the things the Doctor learned about herself and her history at the end of series 12.\"[10]\n\nReturning foes\n\nSimilar to the preceding series 12, series 13 would see the return of numerous aliens and villains.\n\nThe Sontarans returned as significant antagonists for the first time since series 4's The Sontaran Stratagem [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008)./The Poison Sky [+]Helen Raynor, Doctor Who series 4 (BBC One, 2008).. However, several Sontarans had appeared in the time in-between, most notably Strax - last seen in series 8's Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).. For series 13, the Sontarans' appearance was redesigned, with their armour being recoloured silver and appearing more weathered, similarly to the appearance of the Sontarans first seen in the 1974 story The Time Warrior.\n\nThe Weeping Angels also returned as significant antagonists for the first time since the 2013 Christmas Special, The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).,although they made numerous cameo appearances in the time in between, the last of which being the 2021 New Year Special, Revolution of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2021 (BBC One, 2021)..\n\nThe Cybermen, specifically the Cyber-Warriors, also returned after debuting in the Series 12 finale, Ascension of the Cybermen [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020). / The Timeless Children [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 12 (BBC One, 2020).. Additionally, Ashad returned in the The Power of the Doctor [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Centenary Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)..\n\nThe bronze Daleks also returned after serving as the main antagonists in Revolution of the Daleks. For series 13, they made two cameos in the episodes Once, Upon Time [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One, 2021). and The Vanquishers [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who series 13 (BBC One and BBC America, 2021)., before returning as the main antagonists in the 2022 New Year Special, Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., concluding a trilogy of New Year Specials with them as the main antagonists. They returned once more in the Centenary Special The Power of the Doctor. For Eve of the Daleks, a new variant of Dalek, Dalek Executioners, debuted, although unlike those of the spin-off series Time Lord Victorious, these Dalek Executioners were bronze Daleks with a remodeled gunstick resembling a Gatling gun.\n\nThe Sea Devils also returned for the Easter Special Legend of the Sea Devils [+]Ella Road and Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who Easter Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022)., having last been seen in 1984 story Warriors of the Deep.\n\nThe Master also returned as a significant antagonist in the The Power of the Doctor after having last appeared in the series 12 finale, Ascension of the Cybermen/The Timeless Children.\n\nCast\n\nThe Doctor - Jodie Whittaker\n\nYasmin Khan - Mandip Gill\n\nDan Lewis - John Bishop\n\nRecurring\n\nKarvanista - Craige Els\n\nSwarm - Sam Spruell\n\nJoseph Williamson - Steve Oram\n\nDiane Curtis[11] - Nadia Albina\n\nInston-Vee Vinder - Jacob Anderson\n\nAzure/Anna - Rochenda Sandall\n\nClaire Brown - Annabel Scholey\n\nPassenger - Jonny Mathers\n\nBel - Thaddea Graham\n\nThe Grand Serpent - Craig Parkinson\n\nVoice of the Daleks & Cybermen - Nicholas Briggs\n\nFugitive Doctor - Jo Martin\n\nSonya Khan - Bhavnisha Parmar\n\nProfessor Jericho - Kevin McNally\n\nKate Stewart - Jemma Redgrave\n\nVoice of the Daleks - Nicholas Briggs\n\nKarl Wright - Jonny Dixon\n\nGraham O'Brien - Bradley Walsh\n\nThe Master - Sacha Dhawan\n\nAshad - Patrick O'Kane\n\nGuest\n\nRitskaw[12] - Jonathan Watson\n\nKragar - Dan Starkey\n\nSwarm - Matthew Needham\n\nEn Sentac - Sarah Amankwah\n\nK-Toscs - Charlie Oscar\n\nWilder - Richard Tate\n\nJames Stonehouse - Paul Leonard\n\nWilma - Heather Bleasdale\n\nKev - John May\n\nJón - Gunnar Cauthery\n\nWeeping Angel - Barbara Fadden\n\nSkaak - Jonathan Watson\n\nMary Seacole - Sara Powell\n\nEileen - Sue Jenkins\n\nNeville - Paul Broughton\n\nGeneral Logan - Gerald Kyd\n\nSvild - Dan Starkey\n\nPriest Triangle - Nigel Lambert\n\nAwsok Tecteun - Barbara Flynn\n\nPolice Officer - Chantelle Pierre\n\nVoice of the Mouri - Amanda Drew\n\nReverend Shaw - Alex Frost\n\nGerald - Vincent Brimble\n\nJean - Jemma Churchill\n\nMrs. Hayward - Penelope McGhie\n\nNamaca - Blake Harrison\n\nPeggy - Poppy Polivnick\n\nWeeping Angels - Isla Moody, Lowri Brown\n\nFarquhar - Robert Bathurst\n\nMillington - Nicholas Blane\n\nSontaran Commander Stenck - Jonathan Watson\n\nOod - Simon Carew\n\nVoice of Ood - Silas Carson\n\nWaiter - Guy List\n\nAlastair Lethbridge-Stewart - Nicholas Courtney\n\nKumar - Kammy Darweish\n\nAlfie - George Caple\n\nSenstarg - Dan Starkey\n\nShallo - Dan Starkey\n\nStevie (Grand Serpent Victim) - Sonny Walker\n\nDaleks - Nicholas Pegg, Barnaby Edwards, Jon Davey\n\nSarah - Aisling Bea\n\nNick - Adjani Salmon\n\nMary - Pauline McLynn\n\nZheng Yi Sao - Crystal Yu\n\nJi-Hun - Arthur Lee\n\nYing Ki - Marlowe Chan Reeves\n\nYing Wai - David K.

He stated: \"In this strangest of years, the Doctor Who production team have worked wonders to get the show back into production. Given the complexity of making Doctor Who, and with new and rigorous working protocols, it's going to take us a little longer to film each episode, meaning we expect to end up with eight episodes, rather than the usual 11.\"[3]\n\nIn an interview with Radio Times on 28 November, Chibnall opened up a bit more about the struggles of making the show during a global pandemic while trying to avoid fans thinking about the pandemic while watching the series, saying: \"Basically, for the past six months we've been going, 'How do we make Doctor Who in the middle of a pandemic?' We had to re-interrogate absolutely everything. We couldn't do Spyfall this year. We won't be able to do overseas filming. Editorially, production-wise, logistically, health and safety-wise, it's had a massive impact. But where we are is incredibly exciting. As much as possible at the moment everybody's smiling, and we've got some really lovely, great, mad scary ideas.\"[17]\n\nProducer Matt Strevens reassured fans that the quality of the series would not be affected, saying: \"The biggest thing is that when series 13 finally does air, whenever that is, we never want people to watch it under the caveat of the virus, going, 'Ah, well, but they made this during the pandemic.' We want to make sure that when you watch it, it's – no pun intended - timeless, and feels as exciting and as high-end as we've tried to make the series since we took over. That was the driving impulse behind looking at the narratives and reducing the number of episodes slightly: we want to make sure we can give people the biggest production values possible.\"[17]\n\nOn 25 July 2021, during the Comic Con @ Home, Chibnall announced that the series had undergone changes in format, giving it a storytelling style similar to Classic Who era, with it being a singular multi-part story throughout the entire season.[4]\n\nIn Doctor Who Magazine issue 570, Whittaker spoke about the difficulty of shooting a particular scene set in a small bedroom due to social distancing rules applying still and preventing all crew getting into the room together.[18]\n\nChibnall further stated that it had been incredibly difficult on set to get the show done, saying they had to \"reimagine their job\", however that they had been able to \"do all the things [we] normally do in terms of character interactions\".[19]\n\nIn an interview shared by the BBC on 24 October, Jodie Whittaker spoke about what it was like filming during the pandemic, saying that the filming started late because of it and there was a whole different feel to get used to because of the travelling restrictions preventing overseas filming and because no one had seen each other for a year and that \"[everyone] want[ed] to make sure [they're] not the person to make a mistake as the domino effect [could] be so catastrophic on set\".[20]\n\nCrew\n\nProducers\n\nIn an interview with Television Magazine in June 2017, Chibnall promised that his run would be \"bold\" and \"risky\".[21]. (Contrary to common belief, he made no mention of a five-year plan, but his friend, James Strong indicated his belief that the position was a five year project.[22]) This plan involved the revelation of the Timeless Child, given at the end of series 12.[23]\n\nInterestingly, the five-year-plan would come to pass with the Centenary Special releasing on 23 October 2022 completing the run which had begun when filming for the \"Chibnall-era\" began on 31 October 2017 with series 11.[24]\n\nChibnall revealed to Doctor Who Magazine #568 on 19 August 2021 that he would be \"free and clear\" of the show's production in 2022, the year of the specials.[25]\n\nDirector\n\nJamie Magnus Stone returned to direct the first filming block from this series, along with DOP Robin Whenary consisting of episodes 1, 2 and 4. Stone also directed the Centenary Special.[26]\n\nAzhur Saleem directed the second filming block consisting of episode 3, 5 and 6 of the series.\n\nAnnetta Laufer directed the New Year Special.\n\nHaolu Wang directed the Easter Special.\n\nWriters\n\nChris Chibnall wrote all 6 episodes of the series with episode 4 being co-written by Maxine Alderton.\n\nChris Chibnall also wrote all 3 Specials[27], with Special 2 co-written by Ella Road.\n\nOriginal Series 13\n\nIt was revealed in DWM 570 that there were originally more writers scheduled for the original format of the series, this was later re-confirmed on the podcast WHO Corner to Corner:[18][28]\n\nMaxine Alderton was originally confirmed as a \"core writer\" for the series.[29]\n\nEd Hime originally returned to write an episode of the series.[30][28]\n\nPete McTighe originally returned to write an episode of the series.[31][28]\n\nNina Métivier originally returned to write an episode of the series.[28]\n\nVinay Patel originally returned to write and episode of the series.[28]\n\nJoy Wilkinson originally returned to write an episode of the series.[28]\n\nPre-production\n\nTracie Simpson announced at a Gallifrey One convention on 15 February 2020 that pre-production on the series would begin in June the same year.[32]\n\nFilming\n\nThis section needs a cleanup.\n\nThis should be converted into proper prose, or at least grouped into fewer paragraphs for ease of reading.\n\nTracie Simpson announced at the Gallifrey One convention on 15 September 2020 that filming would begin in September the same year.[32] This was, of course, delayed due to the Coronavirus pandemic, with spikes in cases and deaths at around this time.[15]\n\nPrincipal photography officially began on 2 November 2020 at Roath Lock Studios.[33]\n\nFilming on location first began on 13 and 16 November at Morlais Quarry, Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales.[34] Filming also took place at some point in November in Penwyllt

March.[44]\n\nFilming then went on at Atlantic College in Llantwit Major, Wales in front of an old stone house located on the campus on 17 March.[44]\n\nFilming later took place at Kongs Cardiff and The Hayes, both located in Cardiff, on 18 March.[44]\n\nFilming took place at the Royal Albert Dock in Liverpool on 22 March.[45]\n\nNext, filming took place at the Museum of Liverpool on 23 March.[46]\n\nFilming then took place at the Church of St Luke and Metropolitan Cathedral in Liverpool on 24 March.[47]\n\nFilming moved to St George's Hall in Liverpool on 25 March.[48]\n\nFilming took place in Grangetown in Cardiff on 4 May.[49]\n\nFilming continued in Salisbury Avenue in Penarth, Wales on 13 May.[50]\n\nFilming took place at the A Bond Warehouse at Cumberland Road in Bristol on 4 June.[51]\n\nFilming went to Sully Beach in Barry, Wales on 25 June.[52]\n\nFilming took place at Roath Lock Studios on 5, 6, 22, 23 and 26 July[53] while filming took place again on Sully Beach on 15 July.[54] Additional filming also took place at Cardiff Bay on 26 July.[55] Filming wrapped soon after.[56]\n\nFilming on the separately scheduled Centenary Special began on 23 August in

course of the series, they would gradually break apart, similar to Time and Space as seen in the series, with the rainbow coloured threads at the end of each YouTube video unravelling more and more, while the BBC WHO logo would shatter further and further.\n\nThe specials following the main series were also given their own uniquely themed logo variants across social media.\n\nSeries 13 marks the first time the title sequence has received a subtitle, in this instance Flux, below the main title of the show.\n\nIt is the second time a season has received an overarching title, following The Trial of a Time Lord for Season 23.\n\nJodie Whittaker said she \"cried her eyes out\" on her final day of filming.[69]\n\nFlux is the first serial since season 26 and the first 6-part story since The Armageddon Factor (discounting the unaired Shada and animated story Dreamland).\n\nDespite being the shortest season in the history of the show in terms of episode count, Flux formed the longest continual storyline in the revived series as of 2022 (at just over 320 minutes in total, across six episodes), and is the second longest-running serial only beaten by The Trial of a Time Lord (at around 350 minutes total, across 14 episodes) as of 2022.\n\nThe main Series 13 was the first season since Season 23 of the Classic Series to not introduce any new writers.\n\nIt is also the only season to have only two credited writers, and the first time the current showrunner has written all episodes, with only episode 4 having a co-writer.\n\nThe three specials that followed, shared the same style, with only special 2 being co-written.\n\nPete Levy directed the shot of the Doctor looking through the long disposal shaft in the TARDIS console in The Vanquishers.[70]\n\nAs a result of the passing of Queen Elizabeth II on 8 September 2022 the marketing for The Power of the Doctor got messed up due to a \"10 Day Mourning Period\", which caused the 582 issue of Doctor Who Magazine to be released (15 September) before the official reveal of the title, which got pushed to 21 September.\n\nThe large gap between the broadcast of the Centenary Special, released in October 2022, and the broadcast of the 60th Anniversary Specials (2023 specials), released in November 2023, marks the second time since the tradition began, that a Winter Special has been omitted.\n\nThe first time this happened was when the Series 12 opener Spyfall: Part One was broadcast on New Year's Day 2020 instead.\n\nThis is the first time since the tradition began that no new episode, special or otherwise, has aired over the festive period, on Christmas or New Year.\n\nThe original New Year’s Special was originally going to be a lot closer related to the previous two Specials, but had to be hastily changed to what Eve of the Daleks [+]Chris Chibnall, Doctor Who New Year Special 2022 (BBC One, 2022). eventually became.[71]\n\nLogo Gallery\n\nAliens and enemies\n\nKill Disks\n\nThe Division\n\nEn

So now our shift is done, and we're handing back the TARDIS keys. Jodie's magnificent, iconic Doctor has exceeded all our high expectations. She's been the gold standard leading actor, shouldering the responsibility of being the first female Doctor with style, strength, warmth, generosity and humour. She captured the public imagination and continues to inspire adoration around the world, as well as from everyone on the production. I can't imagine working with a more inspiring Doctor – so I'm not going to!\" to which Whittaker adds: \"In 2017 I opened my glorious gift box of size 13 shoes. I could not have guessed the brilliant adventures, worlds and wonders I was to see in them. My heart is so full of love for this show, for the team who make it, for the fans who watch it and for what it has brought to my life. And I cannot thank Chris enough for entrusting me with his incredible stories.\"[79]\n\nOn 16 August the official Doctor Who social media accounts posted a new publicity photo.

Matt Strevens said of the series \"I can't wait for the audience to come on the Flux ride with us. It's our biggest adventure yet with so many brilliant new characters to fall in love with.
