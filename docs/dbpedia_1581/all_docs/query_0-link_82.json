The fundamental issue is that biological targets are molecular factors. Diseases, however, represent emergent properties at the scale of the organism that result from dynamic interactions between multiple constantly changing molecular factors. For a pharmacologic/biologic therapy to be effective, it must target the dynamic processes that underlie the disease. Here we propose a classification of ventricular arrhythmias that is based on our current understanding of the dynamics occurring at the subcellular, cellular, tissue and organism scales, which cause arrhythmias by simultaneously generating arrhythmia triggers and exacerbating tissue vulnerability. The goal is to create a framework that systematically links these key dynamic factors together with fixed factors (structural and electrophysiological heterogeneity) synergistically promoting electrical dispersion and increased arrhythmia risk to molecular factors that can serve as biological targets. We classify ventricular arrhythmias into three primary dynamic categories related generally to unstable Ca cycling, reduced repolarization, and excess repolarization, respectively. The clinical syndromes, arrhythmia mechanisms, dynamic factors and what is known about their molecular counterparts are discussed. Based on this framework, we propose a computational-experimental strategy for exploring the links between molecular factors, fixed factors and dynamic factors that underlie life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. The ultimate objective is to facilitate drug development by creating an in silico platform to evaluate and predict comprehensively how molecular interventions affect not only a single targeted arrhythmia, but all primary arrhythmia dynamics\n\nVentricular arrhythmias in the absence of structural heart disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nPrystowsky, Eric N; Padanilam, Benzy J; Joshi, Sandeep; Fogel, Richard I\n\n2012-05-15\n\nVentricular arrhythmia (VA) in structurally normal hearts can be broadly considered under non-life-threatening monomorphic and life-threatening polymorphic rhythms. Monomorphic VA is classified on the basis of site of origin in the heart, and the most common areas are the ventricular outflow tracts and left ventricular fascicles. The morphology of the QRS complexes on electrocardiogram is an excellent tool to identify the site of origin of the rhythm. Although these arrhythmias are common and generally carry an excellent prognosis, rare sudden death events have been reported. Very frequent ventricular ectopy may also result in a cardiomyopathy in a minority of patients. Suppression of VA may be achieved using calcium-channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, and class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs. Radiofrequency ablation has emerged as an excellent option to eliminate these arrhythmias, although certain foci including aortic cusps and epicardium may be technically challenging. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) is rare and generally occurs in patients with genetic ion channel disorders including long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic VT, and short QT syndrome. Unlike monomorphic VT, these arrhythmic syndromes are associated with sudden death. While the cardiac gross morphology is normal, suggesting a structurally normal heart, abnormalities exist at the molecular level and predispose them to arrhythmias. Another fascinating area, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation and early repolarization syndrome, are undergoing research for a genetic basis.

However, the selection of patients for implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), as well as programming of the ICD, is unclear. OBJECTIVES The objective of this study was to identify predictors, characteristics, and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ARVC. METHODS The Multidisciplinary Study of Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy established the North American ARVC Registry and enrolled patients with a diagnosis of ARVC. Patients were followed prospectively. RESULTS Of 137 patients enrolled, 108 received ICDs. Forty-eight patients had 502 sustained episodes of ventricular arrhythmias, including 489 that were monomorphic and 13 that were polymorphic. In the patients with ICDs, independent predictors of ventricular arrhythmias in follow-up included spontaneous sustained ventricular arrhythmias before ICD implantation and T-wave inversions inferiorly. The only independent predictor for life-threatening arrhythmias, defined as sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) â¥240 beats/min or ventricular fibrillation, was a younger age at enrollment. Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP), independent of the cycle length of the VT, was successful in terminating 92% of VT episodes. CONCLUSIONS In the North American ARVC Registry, the majority of ventricular arrhythmias in follow-up are monomorphic. Risk factors for ventricular arrhythmias were spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias before enrollment and a younger age at ICD implantation. ATP is highly successful in terminating VT, and all ICDs should be programmed for ATP, even for rapid VT.

Much controversy remains regarding the best therapeutic interventions for this specific patient subset. We aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of patients with a history of life-threatening VA due to CAS with various medical interventions, as well as the need for ICD placement in the setting of optimal medical therapy. A multicentre European retrospective survey of patients with VA in the setting of CAS was aggregated and relevant clinical and demographic data was analysed. Forty-nine appropriate patients were identified: 43 (87.8%) presented with VF and 6 (12.2%) with rapid VT. ICD implantation was performed in 44 (89.8%). During follow-up [59 (17-117) months], appropriate ICD shocks were documented in 12. In 8/12 (66.6%) no more ICD therapies were recorded after optimizing calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy. SCD occurred in one patient without ICD. Treatment with beta-blockers was predictive of appropriate device discharge. Conversely, non-dihydropyridine CCB therapy was significantly protective against VAs. Patients with life-threatening VAs secondary to CAS are at particularly high-risk for recurrence, especially when insufficient medical therapy is administered. Non-dihydropyridine CCBs are capable of suppressing episodes, whereas beta-blocker treatment is predictive of VAs. Ultimately, in spite of medical intervention, some patients exhibited arrhythmogenic events in the long-term, suggesting that ICD implantation may still be indicated for all.\n\nNon-Invasive Assessment of Susceptibility to Ventricular Arrhythmias During Simulated Microgravity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCohen, Richard J.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe Cardiovascular Alterations Team is currently conducting studies to determine what alterations in hemodynamic regulation result from sixteen days of simulated microgravity exposure in normal human subjects. In this project we make additional measurements on these same study subjects in order to determine whether there is an increase in susceptibility to ventricular arrhythmias resulting from simulated microgravity exposure. Numerous anecdotal and documented reports from the past 30 years suggest that the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias among astronauts is increased during space flight. For example, documented runs of ventricular tachycardia have been recorded from crew members of Skylab and Mir, there was much attention given by the lay press to Mir Commander Vasily Tslbliyev's complaints of heart rhythm irregularities in July of 1997, and cardiovascular mechanisms may have been causal in the recent death of an experimental primate shortly after return from space. In 1986, a Mir cosmonaut, Alexander Laveikin, was brought home and replaced with an alternate cosmonaut as a result of cardiac dysrhythmias that began during extravehicular activity. Furthermore, at a joint NASA/NSBRI workshop held in January 1998, cardiac arrhythmias were identified as the highest priority cardiovascular risk to a human Mars mission. Despite the evidence for the risk of a potentially lethal arrhythmia resulting from microgravity exposure, the effects of space flight and the associated physiologic stresses on cardiac conduction processes are not known, and an increase in cardiac susceptibility to arrhythmias has never been quantified. In this project, we are determining whether simulated space flight increases the risk of developing life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances such as sustained ventricular tachycardia (defined as ventricular tachycardia lasting at least 30 seconds or resulting in hemodynamic collapse) and ventricular fibrillation. We are obtaining measures of\n\nAmiodarone in the treatment of refractory supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWheeler, P. J.; Ingram, D. V.; Puritz, R.; Chamberlain, D. A.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nAmiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent unrelated to other drugs in current use. It has been little used in Britain, and no formal clinical trials have been possible because the drug has not been licensed by the Committee on Safety of Medicines. Nevertheless it has unique properties which can be valuable in the treatment of a wide spectrum of arrhythmias, particularly supraventricular tachycardias. Amiodarone has a slow onset of action and is cumulative. A sustained action is therefore achieved without the need for frequent maintenance dosage. Fifty patients have been treated with amiodarone in maintenance doses ranging from 200 mg on alternate days to 200 mg twice daily either alone, or in combination with conventional therapy. All were resistant to conventional therapy alone or could not be treated with usual agents because of unwanted drug effects. Of 27 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, 18 were completely controlled and the other 9 were markedly improved. Six of 8 patients with recurrent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were well controlled symptomatically. Results were predictably less satisfactory in 15 high risk post-infarction patients with malignant arrhythmias and severe myocardial damage, but 6 were probably improved as a result of amiodarone. All patients on maintenance therapy for 3 months or more developed corneal microdeposits. None has any visual symptoms or other ocular defect, and treatment has not been curtailed as a result of this well recognized effect which is believed to be reversible and benign. Amiodarone can control patients with otherwise refractory arrhythmias including some which are life-threatening. Formal clinical trials are needed to define accurately its future role in the prevention and treatment of serious rhythm disorders of the heart.

Both ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias are now well described as prominent clinical components of LVNC. Throughout the spectrum of age, these arrhythmias have been associated with prognosis and outcome, and their clinical management is therefore an important aspect of patient care. The risk of sudden death seems to be associated with ventricular dilation, systolic dysfunction, and the presence of arrhythmias. Proposed management strategies shown to have efficacy include antiarrhythmic therapy, ablation techniques, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study sought to investigate incidence and predictive factors of ventricular arrhythmias in ACM. Retrospective observational study of the clinical characteristics and long-term arrhythmic events in 282 consecutive patients with ACM (94 individuals) and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) (188 individuals) evaluated between 1993 and 2011. During a median follow-up of 38months (IQR:12-77), 42 patients died and 79 underwent heart transplantation [31 (33%) with ACM vs 90 (48%) with IDCM; p=0.017]. A total of 37 (13%) patients [18 (19%) ACM vs 20 (11%) IDCM; p=0.048] suffered malignant ventricular arrhythmias. On multivariate analysis, left bundle branch block (LBBB) (OR 2.4; CI95%: 1.2-5; p=0.015) and alcoholic aetiology (OR 2.3; CI95%: 1.1-4.5; p=0.026) were the only independent predictors of malignant ventricular arrhythmic events. A total of 18 (19%) ACM patients experienced 20 malignant ventricular arrhythmic events (4 aborted SCD, 8 SCD and 8 appropriate ICD therapies). At baseline evaluation, the only independent predictor of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in ACM patients was LBBB (OR 11.2; CI95%: 2.6-50; p=0.001). No malignant ventricular arrhythmias were recorded during follow-up in ACM patients if left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) had increased or remained â¥40%. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias are more frequent in ACM than in IDCM. LBBB identifies ACM patients with increased risk of SCD. No malignant ventricular arrhythmias were found during follow-up in ACM patients when LVEF was â¥40%. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Although abnormal Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors (RyR2) has been linked to arrhythmogenesis, the molecular mechanisms triggering release of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that increased RyR2 phosphorylation by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is both necessary and sufficient to promote lethal ventricular arrhythmias. mice in which the S2814 Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II site on RyR2 is constitutively activated (S2814D) develop pathological sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release events, resulting in reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) load on confocal microscopy. These Ca(2+) release events are associated with increased RyR2 open probability in lipid bilayer preparations. At baseline, young S2814D mice have structurally and functionally normal hearts without arrhythmias; however, they develop sustained ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death on catecholaminergic provocation by caffeine/epinephrine or programmed electric stimulation. Young S2814D mice have a significant predisposition to sudden arrhythmogenic death after transverse aortic constriction surgery. Finally, genetic ablation of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II site on RyR2 (S2814A) protects mutant mice from pacing-induced arrhythmias versus wild-type mice after transverse aortic constriction surgery. our results suggest that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation of RyR2 Ca(2+) release channels at S2814 plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death in mice with heart failure.\n\nÎ²1-Adrenoceptor blocker aggravated ventricular arrhythmia.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yan; Patel, Dimpi; Wang, Dao Wu; Yan, Jiang Tao; Hsia, Henry H; Liu, Hao; Zhao, Chun Xia; Zuo, Hou Juan; Wang, Dao Wen\n\n2013-11-01\n\nTo assess the impact of Î²1 -adrenoceptor blockers (Î²1 -blocker) and isoprenaline on the incidence of idiopathic repetitive ventricular arrhythmia that apparently decreases with preprocedural anxiety. From January 2010 to July 2012, six patients were identified who had idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias that apparently decreased (by greater than 90%) with preprocedural anxiety. The number of ectopic ventricular beats per hour (VPH) was calculated from Holter or telemetry monitoring to assess the ectopic burden. The mean VPH of 24 hours from Holter before admission (VPH-m) was used as baseline (100%) for normalization. Î²1 -Blockers, isoprenaline, and/or aminophylline were administrated successively on the ward and catheter lab to evaluate their effects on the ventricular arrhythmias. Among 97 consecutive patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias, six had reduction in normalized VPHs in the hour before the scheduled procedure time from (104.6 Â± 4.6%) to (2.8 Â± 1.6%) possibly due to preprocedural anxiety (P < 0.05), then increased to (97.9 Â± 9.7%) during Î²1 -blocker administration (P < 0.05), then quickly reduced to (1.6 Â± 1.0%) during subsequent isoprenaline infusion. Repeated Î²1 -blocker quickly counteracted the inhibitory effect of isoprenaline, and VPHs increased to (120.9 Â± 2.4%) from (1.6 Â± 1.0%; P < 0.05). Isoprenaline and Î²1 -blocker showed similar effects on the arrhythmias in catheter lab. In some patients with structurally normal heart and ventricular arrhythmias there is a marked reduction of arrhythmias associated with preprocedural anxiety. These patients exhibit a reproducible sequence of Î²1 -blocker aggravation and catecholamine inhibition of ventricular arrhythmias, including both repetitive ventricular premature beats and monomorphic ventricular tachycardia.

Life-threatening arrhythmias (LTA) can occur and worsen prognosis. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence and outcome of LTA in TTC, as well as its predictive factors and clinical implications. We studied 214 consecutive cases of TTC over 8 years. The study cohort was divided into 2 groups: those with LTA (LTA group) and those without (non-LTA group). LTA was defined as ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or cardiac arrest. LTA occurred in 10.7% of patients mainly in the first 24 hours of hospitalization: ventricular tachycardia (n = 2), ventricular fibrillation (n = 11), cardiac arrest (n = 10: 5 asystole, 3 complete heart block, and 2 sinoatrial block). LTA were associated with lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a high rate of conduction disturbances. In-hospital (39.1% vs 8.9%; PÂ <Â .001) and 1-year mortality (47.8% vs 14.1%; P < .001) rates were significantly increased in the LTA group. LVEF and QRS duration >105 ms were independent predictors of LTA. In cases where a device was implanted, conduction disturbances persisted after the index event despite complete recovery of LVEF. There was no ventricular arrhythmia recurrence during follow-up. LTA occur early in patients presenting with TTC and is associated with significantly worse short- and long-term prognosis. Left ventricular impairment and QRS duration >105 ms are independent predictors of LTA. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in the acute phase without further recurrence recorded in hospital survivors, whereas severe conduction disorders persisted during long-term follow-up. These findings may have implications on the choice of device therapy for this specific patient subgroup. Copyright Â© 2018 Heart Rhythm Society. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Most individuals that receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators never experience a life-threatening arrhythmia. Genetic factors may help identify who is most at risk. Patients with an ICD and extended follow-up were recruited from 34 clinical sites with the goal of oversampling those who had experienced LTA, with a cumulative 607 cases and 297 controls included in the analysis. A total of 1,006 Caucasian patients were enrolled during a time period of 13 months. Arrhythmia status of 904 patients could be confirmed and their genomic data were included in the analysis. In this cohort, there were 704 males, 200 females, and the average age was 73.3 years. We genotyped DNA samples using the Illumina Human660 W Genotyping BeadChip and tested for association between genotype at common variants and the phenotype of having an LTA. We did not find any associations reaching genome-wide significance, with the strongest association at chromosome 13, rs11856574 at Pâ=â5Ã10â»â¶. Loci previously implicated in phenotypes such as QT interval (measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave as measured by electrocardiogram) were not found to be significantly associated with having an LTA. Although powered to detect such associations, we did not find common genetic variants of large effect associated with having a LTA in those of European descent. This indicates that common gene variants cannot be used at this time to guide ICD risk-stratification.

Its long-term consumption may induce cardiovascular adverse effects. We assessed the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in rats which subjected to chronic nandrolone plus high-intensity endurance exercise. Animals were grouped as; control (CTL), exercise (Ex): 8 weeks under exercise, vehicle group (Arach): received arachis oil, and Nan group: received nandrolone decanoate 5 mg/kg twice a week for 8 weeks, Arach+Ex group, and Nan+Ex. Finally, under anesthesia, arrhythmia was induced by infusion of 1.5 Î¼g/0.1 mL/min of aconitine IV and ventricular arrhythmias were recorded for 15 min. Then, animals' hearts were excised and tissue samples were taken. Nandrolone plus exercise had no significant effect on blood pressure but decreased the heart rate (P<0.01) and increased the RR (P<0.01) and JT intervals (P<0.05) of electrocardiogram. Nandrolone+exercise significantly increased the ventricular fibrillation (VF) frequency and also decreased the VF latency (P<0.05 versus CTL group). Combination of exercise and nandrolone could not recover the decreasing effects of nandrolone on animals weight gain but, it enhanced the heart hypertrophy index (P<0.05). In addition, nandrolone increased the level of hydroxyproline (HYP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) but had not significant effect on glutathione peroxidase of heart. Exercise only prevented the effect of nandrolone on HYP. Nandrolone plus severe exercise increases the risk of VF that cannot be explained only by the changes in redox system. The intensification of cardiac hypertrophy and prolongation of JT interval may be a part of involved mechanisms. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Apropos of 24 cases].\n\nPubMed\n\nCoeurderoy, A; Almange, C; Laurent, M; Biron, Y; Leborgne, P\n\n1985-12-01\n\nThe severity and prognosis of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias in childhood were studied in 24 patients (12 boys, 12 girls) with an average age of 8 years at the time of diagnosis of the arrhythmia. Investigations included clinical assessment and analysis of basal ECG (morphology of the arrhythmias) and dynamic recordings (Holter and exercise stress testing). The clinical course was followed for an average of 3.8 years. The patients were classified in two groups: monomorphic arrhythmias (Group I) and polymorphic arrhythmias (Group II). Group I was divided into 4 subgroups: isolated ventricular extrasystoles (IA), 11 patients; ventricular extrasystoles with bursts of ventricular tachycardia (IB), 6 patients; sustained ventricular tachycardia without intercritical extrasystoles (IC), 1 patient; accelerated idioventricular rhythm (ID), 2 patients. Subgroups IA, IB and ID were characterised by the absence of symptoms, the disappearance of the arrhythmia on exercise, the decreased efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs and an excellent prognosis. Therapeutic abstention was the rule in these patients. Patients in Group IC were characterised by the variability of their symptoms, the absence of exercise induced arrhythmias, the need for treatment in most cases and a good long-term prognosis. Group II was divided into 2 subgroups: adrenergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (IIA), 2 patients, and non-adrenergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (IIB), 2 patients. Patients in Subgroup IIA were characterised by syncope on exercise or emotion, the need for betablocker therapy which considerably improved the patients symptoms but which did not usually prevent sudden death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nGenome-Wide Association of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Activation With Life-Threatening Arrhythmias\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMurray, Sarah S.; Smith, Erin N.; Villarasa, Nikki; Nahey, Tara; Lande, Jeff; Goldberg, Harold; Shaw, Marian; Rosenthal, Lawrence; Ramza, Brian; Alaeddini, Jamshid; Han, Xinqiang; Damani, Samir; Soykan, Orhan; Kowal, Robert C.; Topol, Eric J.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjectives To identify genetic factors that would be predictive of individuals who require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), we conducted a genome-wide association study among individuals with an ICD who experienced a life-threatening arrhythmia (LTA; cases) vs. those who did not over at least a 3-year period (controls).

A total of 1,006 Caucasian patients were enrolled during a time period of 13 months. Arrhythmia status of 904 patients could be confirmed and their genomic data were included in the analysis. In this cohort, there were 704 males, 200 females, and the average age was 73.3 years. We genotyped DNA samples using the Illumina Human660 W Genotyping BeadChip and tested for association between genotype at common variants and the phenotype of having an LTA. Results and Conclusions We did not find any associations reaching genome-wide significance, with the strongest association at chromosome 13, rs11856574 at Pâ=â5Ã10â6. Loci previously implicated in phenotypes such as QT interval (measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave as measured by electrocardiogram) were not found to be significantly associated with having an LTA. Although powered to detect such associations, we did not find common genetic variants of large effect associated with having a LTA in those of European descent. This indicates that common gene variants cannot be used at this time to guide ICD risk-stratification. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00664807 PMID:22247754\n\nLeft atrial booster pump function is an independent predictor of subsequent life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy.\n\nPubMed\n\nNegishi, Kazuaki; Negishi, Tomoko; Zardkoohi, Omeed; Ching, Elizabeth A; Basu, Nivedita; Wilkoff, Bruce L; PopoviÄ, Zoran B; Marwick, Thomas H\n\n2016-10-01\n\nLeft atrial (LA) function helps to preserve cardiac output and to control pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in the setting of left ventricular (LV) impairment, but little is known about the contribution of the LA function to ventricular arrhythmia. We sought whether LA booster pump function was associated with arrhythmias in patients undergoing primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation for non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM), independent of global longitudinal strain (GLS) and mechanical dispersion (MD). We identified 124 NICM patients (56 Â± 13, 67 male) who underwent echocardiography pre-ICD implantation for primary prevention. The main outcome measure was appropriate ICD therapy (anti-tachycardia pacing or shock). The mitral A-wave was used as an LA functional marker. MD was defined as standard deviation of time to peak strain of each segment. Over a median follow-up of 3.8 Â± 2.2 years, 36 patients had appropriate ICD therapy, including 23 shocks. Patients with appropriate ICD therapy had lower A-wave velocity (P < 0.001), larger LA volume (P < 0.001), and impaired circumferential MD (P = 0.006), but similar ejection fraction (EF) (P = 0.40) and GLS (P = 0.11). In sequential Cox proportional hazards models, A-wave, E/A ratio, and GLS were significantly associated with outcomes, independent of age, sex, and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator or left bundle branch block. In nested Cox models, mitral A-wave had a prognostic value incremental to models with LV systolic (EF and GLS) and diastolic functional parameters (E/A, E/e', and LA volume) and MD. LA booster pump function was an independent and incremental predictor of arrhythmias in NICM over GLS and MD, and may aid better risk stratification in this population.

Nowadays, patients with cardiovascular disease are more encouraged to take part in physical training programs. Nevertheless, high-intensity exercise is associated to a higher risk for sudden death, even in apparently healthy people. During an exercise testing (ET), health care professionals provide patients, in a controlled scenario, an intense physiological stimulus that could precipitate cardiac arrhythmia in high risk individuals. There is still no clinical or statistical tool to predict this incidence. The aim of this study was to develop a statistical model to predict the incidence of exercise-induced potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (PLVA) during high intensity exercise. 6415 patients underwent a symptom-limited ET with a Balke ramp protocol. A multivariate logistic regression model where the primary outcome was PLVA was performed. Incidence of PLVA was 548 cases (8.5%). After a bivariate model, thirty one clinical or ergometric variables were statistically associated with PLVA and were included in the regression model. In the multivariate model, 13 of these variables were found to be statistically significant. A regression model (G) with a X(2) of 283.987 and a p<0.001, was constructed. Significant variables included: heart failure, antiarrhythmic drugs, myocardial lower-VD, age and use of digoxin, nitrates, among others. This study allows clinicians to identify patients at risk of ventricular tachycardia or couplets during exercise, and to take preventive measures or appropriate supervision.

These abnormalities include hereditary channelopathies: long QT, short QT and Brugada syndromes. These syndromes are a notable concern, particularly in young people, due to their high propensity for severe ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Current evidence suggests the involvement of an increasing number of drugs in acquired forms of long QT and Brugada syndromes. However, drug-induced short QT syndrome is still a rarely reported condition. Therefore, there has been speculation on its clinical significance, since few fatal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death cases have been described so far. Drug-induced proarrhythmia is a growing challenge for physicians, regulatory agencies and the pharmaceutical industry. Physicians should weigh the risks of potentially fatal outcomes against the therapeutic benefits, when making decisions about drug prescriptions. Growing concerns about its safety and the need for more accurate predictive models for drug-induced fatal outcomes justify further research in these fields. The aim of this article is to comprehensively and critically review the recently published evidence with regard to drug-induced life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. This article will take into account the provision of data to physicians that are useful in the identification of the culprit drugs, and thus, contribute to the prompt recognition and management of these serious clinical conditions.

Limited information is available concerning atrial arrhythmias in ARVD/C. The purpose of this study was to characterize spontaneous atrial arrhythmias in a large registry population of ARVD/C patients. Patients (n = 248) from the Johns Hopkins ARVD/C registry who met the diagnostic criteria and had undertaken genotype analysis were included. Medical records of each were reviewed to ascertain incidence and characteristics of atrial arrhythmia episodes. Detailed demographic, phenotypic, and structural information was obtained from registry data. Thirty-five patients with ARVD/C (14%) experienced one or more types of atrial arrhythmia during median follow-up of 5.78 (interquartile range 8.52) years. Atrial fibrillation was the most common atrial arrhythmia, occurring in 80% of ARVD/C patients with atrial arrhythmias. Patients developed atrial arrhythmias at a mean age of 43.0 Â± 14.0 years. Atrial arrhythmia patients obtained a total of 22 inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks during follow-up. Older age at last follow-up (P <.001) and male gender (P = .044) were associated with atrial arrhythmia development. Patients with atrial arrhythmias had a higher occurrence of death (P = .028), heart failure (P <.001), and left atrial enlargement on echocardiography (P = .004). Atrial arrhythmias are common in ARVD/C and present at a younger age than in the general population. They are associated with male gender, increasing age, and left atrial enlargement. Atrial arrhythmias are clinically important as they are associated with inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks and increased risk of both death and heart failure.

A left bundle branch block, inferior axis morphology arrhythmia is the hallmark of RVOT arrhythmias. VAs from other sites of origin can mimic RVOT VAs, and ablation in the RVOT typically fails for these VAs. To analyze reasons for failed ablations of RVOT-like VAs. Among a consecutive series of 197 patients with an RVOT-like electrocardiographic (ECG) morphology who were referred for ablation, 38 patients (13 men; age 46 Â± 14 years; left ventricular ejection fraction 47% Â± 14%) in whom a prior procedure failed within the RVOT underwent a second ablation procedure. ECG characteristics of the VA were compared to a consecutive series of 50 patients with RVOT VAs. The origin of the VA was identified in 95% of the patients. In 28 of 38 (74%) patients, the arrhythmia origin was not in the RVOT. The VA originated from intramural sites (n = 8, 21%), the pulmonary arteries (n = 7, 18%), the aortic cusps (n = 6, 16%), and the epicardium (n = 5, 13%). The origin was within the RVOT in 10 (26%) patients. In 2 (5%) patients, the origin could not be identified despite biventricular, aortic, and epicardial mapping. The VA was eliminated in 34 of 38 (89%) patients with repeat procedures. The ECG features of patients with failed RVOT-like arrhythmias were different from the characteristics of RVOT arrhythmias. In patients in whom ablation of a VA with an RVOT-like appearance fails, mapping of the pulmonary artery, the aortic cusps, the epicardium, the left ventricular outflow tract, and the aortic cusps will help identify the correct site of origin. The 12-lead ECG is helpful in differentiating these VAs from RVOT VAs. Copyright Â© 2013 Heart Rhythm Society.

This is a retrospective, population-based cohort study of all women with a live birth between 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2011 in British Columbia, Canada. Cox proportional hazards models, yielding hazard ratios (HRs), were used to estimate the risk of hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia associated with domperidone exposure within six months postpartum. The study population consisted of 225â532 women with 320â351 live births. There was only one death during the six-month postpartum period among the study population, and thus we did not perform any analyses of all-cause mortality. We identified 21 hospitalizations for ventricular arrhythmia. Adjusting for age, smoking and prior history of ventricular arrhythmia and cardiovascular disease, the risk of ventricular arrhythmia hospitalization was approximately double among those exposed to domperidone, but the results were not statistically significant (HRâ=â2.25, 95%CI 0.84-6.01). Adjustment for body mass index in the 74% of women for whom it was known further reduced the association (HRâ=â1.69, 95%CI 0.48-5.96). We found a possible association between exposure to domperidone and hospitalization for ventricular arrhythmia among a cohort of women who have recently given birth. Future studies are needed to confirm this association. Copyright Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sixty-eight beat-to-beat time series from 13 patients with an ICD were analyzed to quantify heart rate variability and ventricular arrhythmias. The episodes of VT were classified in one of two groups depending on whether the sinus rate in the 1 min preceding the VT was greater or less than 90 beats per minute. In a subset of patients, increased heart rate and reduced heart rate variability was often observed up to 20 min prior to the VT. There was a non-significant trend to higher incidence of premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) before VT compared to control recordings. The patterns of the ventricular arrhythmias were highly heterogeneous among different patients and even within the same patient. Analysis of the changes of heart rate and heart rate variability may have predictive value about the onset of VT in selected patients. The patterns of ventricular arrhythmia could not be used to predict onset of VT in this group of patients.\n\nComputational model based approach to analysis ventricular arrhythmias: Effects of dysfunction calcium channels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGulothungan, G.; Malathi, R.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nDisturbed sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) handling is known to be a major predisposing factor for life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac contractility in ventricular tissue is prominent by Ca2+ channels like voltage dependent Ca2+ channels, sodium-calcium exchanger (Na+-Ca2+x) and sacroplasmicrecticulum (SR) Ca2+ pump and leakage channels. Experimental and clinical possibilities for studying cardiac arrhythmias in human ventricular myocardium are very limited. Therefore, the use of alternative methods such as computer simulations is of great importance. Our aim of this article is to study the impact on action potential (AP) generation and propagation in single ventricular myocyte and ventricular tissue under different dysfunction Ca2+ channels condition. In enhanced activity of Na+-Ca2+x, single myocyte produces AP duration (APD90) and APD50 is significantly smaller (266 ms and 235 ms). Its Na+-Ca2+x current at depolarization is increases 60% from its normal level and repolarization current goes more negative (nonfailing= -0.28 pA/pF and failing= -0.47 pA/pF). Similarly, same enhanced activity of Na+-Ca2+x in 10 mm region of ventricular sheet, raises the plateau potential abruptly, which ultimately affects the diastolic repolarization. Compare with normal ventricular sheet region of 10 mm, 10% of ventricular sheet resting state is reduces and ventricular sheet at time 250 ms is goes to resting state very early. In hypertrophy condition, single myocyte produces APD90 and APD50 is worthy of attention smaller (232 mS and 198 ms). Its sodium-potassium (Na+-K+) pump current is 75% reduces from its control conditions (0.13 pA/pF). Hypertrophy condition, 50% of ventricular sheet is reduces to minimum plateau potential state, that starts the repolarization process very early and reduces the APD. In a single failing SR Ca2+ channels myocyte, recovery of Ca2+ concentration level in SR reduces upto 15% from its control myocytes. At time 290 ms, 70% of ventricular sheet\n\nImportance of the atrial channel for ventricular arrhythmia therapy in the dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator.\n\nPubMed\n\nDijkman, B; Wellens, H J\n\n2000-12-01\n\nPerformance of dual chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems has been judged based on functioning of the ventricular tachycardia:supraventricular tachycardia (VT:SVT) discrimination criteria and DDD pacing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of dual chamber diagnostics to improve the electrical and antiarrhythmic therapy of ventricular arrhythmias. Information about atrial and ventricular rhythm in relation to ventricular arrhythmia occurrence and therapy was evaluated in 724 spontaneous arrhythmia episodes detected and treated by three types of dual chamber ICDs in 41 patients with structural heart disease. Device programming was based on clinically documented and induced ventricular arrhythmias. In ambulatory patients, sinus tachycardia preceded ventricular arrhythmias more often than in the hospital during exercise testing. The incidence of these VTs could be reduced by increasing the dose of a beta-blocking agent in only two patients. In five patients in whom sinus tachycardia developed after onset of hemodynamic stable VT, propranolol was more effective than Class III antiarrhythmics combined with another beta-blocking agent with regard to the incidence of VT and pace termination. In all but three cases, atrial arrhythmias were present for a longer time before the onset of ventricular arrhythmias. During atrial arrhythmias, fast ventricular rates before the onset of ventricular rate were observed more often than RR irregularities and short-long RR sequences. Dual chamber diagnostics allowed proper interpretation of detection and therapy outcome in patients with different types of ventricular arrhythmia. The advantages of the dual chamber ICD system go further than avoiding the shortcomings of the single chamber system. Information from the atrial chamber allows better device programming and individualization of drug therapy for ventricular arrhythmia.\n\nElectrical stimulation-based renal nerve mapping exacerbates ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial ischaemia.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Bing; Zhou, Xiaoya; Wang, Menglong; Li, Xuefei; Zhou, Liping; Meng, Guannan; Wang, Yuhong; Wang, Zhuo; Wang, Songyun; Yu, Lilei; Jiang, Hong\n\n2018-06-01\n\nBlood pressure elevation in response to transient renal nerve stimulation (RNS) has been used to determine the ablation target and endpoint of renal denervation. This study aimed to evaluate the safety of transient RNS in canines with normal or ischaemic hearts. In ten normal (Group 1) and six healed myocardial infarction (HMI) (Group 2) canines, a large-tip catheter was inserted into the left or right renal artery to perform transient RNS. The left stellate ganglion neural activity (LSGNA) and ventricular electrophysiological parameters were measured at baseline and during transient RNS. In another 20 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) canines, RNS (Group 3, nâ=â10) or sham RNS (Group 4, nâ=â10) was intermittently (1âmin ON and 4âmin OFF) performed for 1âh following AMI induction. The LSGNA and AMI-induced ventricular arrhythmias were analysed. In normal and HMI canines, although transient RNS significantly increased the LSGNA and facilitated the action potential duration (APD) alternans, it did not induce any ventricular arrhythmias and did not change the ventricular effective refractory period, APD or maximum slope of the APD restitution curve. In AMI canines, transient RNS significantly exacerbated LSG activation and promoted the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias. Transient RNS did not increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in normal or HMI hearts, but it significantly promoted the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in AMI hearts. Therefore, electrical stimulation-based renal nerve mapping may be unsafe in AMI patients and in patients with a high risk for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nRisk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with nonsedating antihistamine drugs\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJosÃ© de Abajo, Francisco; RodrÃ­guez, Luis Alberto GarcÃ­a\n\n1999-01-01\n\nAims To quantify and compare the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias associated with the use of five nonsedating antihistamines: acrivastine, astemizole, cetirizine, loratadine and terfenadine. The effects of age, sex, dose, duration of treatment, and the interaction with P450 inhibitor drugs were also examined. Methods We carried out a cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using the UK-based General Practice Research Database (GPRD). The study cohort included persons aged less than 80 years old who received their first prescription for any of the five study drugs between January 1, 1992 and September 30, 1996. We estimated relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias with current use of antihistamines as compared with non use. Results The study cohort included 197 425 persons who received 513 012 prescriptions. Over the study period 18 valid cases of idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias were detected. Nine occurred during the current use of any antihistamine, resulting in a crude incidence of 1.9 per 10 000 person-years (95%CI: 1.0â3.6) and a relative risk of 4.2 (95%CI: 1.5â11.8) as compared with non use. Astemizole presented the highest relative risk (RR = 19.0; 95%CI: 4.8â76.0) of all study drugs, while terfenadine (RR = 2.1; 95%CI:0.5â8.5) was in the range of other nonsedating antihistamines. Older age was associated with a greater risk of ventricular arrhythmias (RR = 7.4; 95%CI: 2.6â21.4) and seemed to increase the effect of antihistamines (RR = 6.4; 95%CI: 1.7â24.8). The proportions of high dose terfenadine and the concomitant use with P450 inhibitors among current users of terfenadine were 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively over the study period with no single case of ventricular arrhythmias occurring in the presence of these two risk factors. Conclusions The use of nonsedating antihistamines increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias by a factor of four in the general population.

MI in the perinatal period in a structurally normal heart and with ventricular arrhythmia as a presenting feature has not been thoroughly described. Published case reports describe treatment methods extrapolated from adult MI. However, due to the rare occurrence, the most appropriate acute treatment for both MI and ventricular arrhythmia in newborn infants remains unknown. CaseâA male term infant with perinatal asphyxia and need for extensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation at birth had ventricular tachyarrhythmia and ST-elevations on electrocardiogram. Four hours after birth, he died from cardiogenic failure. A thrombus at the right coronary artery was found on autopsy. ConclusionâMI in the perinatal period in a structurally normal heart is very rare and mortality is high. Although acute treatments extrapolated from adult MI has been described to result in favorable outcomes in newborn infants, guidelines are lacking on how to manage acute MI and associated ventricular arrhythmia.

In this study, we will describe the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of a cohort of patients with this novel arrhythmia. Eight patients (5 men; median age, 25 years) with RBB-AIVR/VT were consecutively enrolled in the study. Pharmacological testing, exercise treadmill testing, electrophysiological study, and catheter ablation were performed in the study patients, and ECG features were characterized. All RBB-AIVR/VTs were of typical left bundle-branch block morphology with atrioventricular dissociation. The arrhythmias, which demonstrated chronotropic variability, were often isorhythmic with sinus rhythm and were accelerated by physical exercise, stress, and intravenous isoprenaline infusion. The rate of RBB-AIVR/VT varied from 45 to 200 beats per minute. Two patients experienced syncope, and 3 had impaired left ventricular function. Metoprolol was proven to be the most effective drug to decelerate the arrhythmia rate and relieve symptoms. Electrophysiology study was performed in 5 patients and the earliest activation with a sharp RBB potential was localized in the mid or distal RBB area. Catheter ablation terminated the arrhythmia with subsequent RBB block morphology during sinus rhythm. During follow-up, patients' symptoms were controlled with normalization of left ventricular function either on metoprolol or by catheter ablation. RBB-AIVR/VT is an unusual type of ventricular arrhythmia. It can result in significant symptoms and depressed ventricular function and can be successfully treated with catheter ablation.

To assess the added value of CMR in etiological diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias after an inconclusive conventional investigation. Patients undergoing CMR between 2005 and 2011 for investigation of ventricular arrhythmias were included (n=113). All had documented arrhythmias. Those with a definite diagnosis from a previous investigation and those with evidence of coronary artery disease (acute coronary syndrome, typical angina symptoms, increase in biomarkers or positive stress test) were excluded. CMR results were considered relevant when they fulfilled diagnostic criteria. Of the 113 patients, 57.5% were male and mean age was 41.7 Â± 16.2 years. Regarding the initial arrhythmia, 38.1% had ventricular fibrillation/sustained ventricular tachycardia (VF/VT) and 61.9% had less complex ventricular ectopy. CMR imaging showed criteria of a specific diagnosis in 42.5% of patients, was totally normal in 36.3%, and showed non-specific alterations in the remainder. In VF/VT patients, specific criteria were found in 60.4%, and in 31.4% of those with less complex ectopy. The most frequent diagnoses were arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, ventricular non-compaction and myopericarditis. It is worth noting that, although there was no evidence of previous coronary artery disease, 6.2% of patients had a late gadolinium enhancement distribution pattern compatible with myocardial infarction. CMR gives additional and important information in the diagnostic work-up of ventricular arrhythmias after an inconclusive initial investigation. The proportion of patients with diagnostic criteria was 42.5% (60.0% in those with VF/VT), and CMR was completely normal in 36.6%. Copyright Â© 2012 Sociedade Portuguesa de Cardiologia.

The existence of spatio-temporal distribution of excitable gap during arrhythmia suggests that multiple and timed stimuli delivered over a region may permit capture over larger areas. Our objective in this study was to evaluate the efficacy of using spatially distributed pacing (DP) to capture activation during ventricular arrhythmia. Data were obtained from rabbit hearts which were placed against a lattice of parallel wires through which biphasic pacing stimuli were delivered. Electrical activity was recorded optically. Pacing stimuli were delivered in sequence through the parallel wires starting with the wire closest to the apex and ending with one closest to the base. Inter-stimulus delay was based on conduction velocity. Time-frequency analysis of optical signals was used to determine variability in activation. A decrease in standard deviation of dominant frequencies of activation from a grid of locations that spanned the captured area and a concurrence with paced frequency were used as an index of capture. Results from five animals showed that the average standard deviation decreased from 0.81 Hz during arrhythmia to 0.66 Hz during DP at pacing cycle length of 125 ms (p = 0.03) reflecting decreased spatio-temporal variability in activation during DP. Results of time-frequency analysis during these pacing trials showed agreement between activation and paced frequencies. These results show that spatially distributed and timed stimulation can be used to modify and capture activation during ventricular arrhythmia.\n\nDiscrete potentials guided radiofrequency ablation for idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Enzhao; Xu, Gang; Liu, Tong; Ye, Lan; Zhang, Qitong; Zhao, Yanshu; Li, Guangping\n\n2015-03-01\n\nDiscrete potentials (DPs) have been recorded and targeted as the site of ablation of the outflow tract arrhythmias. The aim of the present study was to investigate the significance of DPs with respect to mapping and ablation for idiopathic outflow tract premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) or ventricular tachycardias (VTs). Seventeen consecutive patients with idiopathic right or left ventricular outflow tract PVCs/VTs who underwent radiofrequency catheter ablation were included. Intracardiac electrograms during the mapping and ablation were analysed. During sinus rhythm, sharp high-frequency DPs that displayed double or multiple components were recorded following or buried in the local ventricular electrograms in all of the 17 patients, peak amplitude 0.51 Â± 0.21 mV. The same potential was recorded prior to the local ventricular potential of the PVCs/VTs. Spontaneous reversal of the relationship of the DPs to the local ventricular electrogram during the arrhythmias was noted. The DPs were related to a region of low voltage showed by intracardiac high-density contact mapping. At the sites with DPs, lower unipolar and bipolar ventricular voltage of sinus beats were noted compared with the adjacent regions without DPs (unipolar: 6.1 Â± 1.8 vs. 8.3 Â± 2.3 mV, P < 0.05; bipolar: 0.62 Â± 0.45 vs. 1.03 Â± 0.60 mV, P < 0.05). The targeted DPs were still present in 12 patients after successful elimination of the ectopies. Discrete potentials were not present in seven controls. Discrete potentials and related low-voltage regions were common in idiopathic outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias. Discrete potential- and substrate-guided ablation strategy will help to reduce the recurrence of idiopathic outflow tract arrhythmias. Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

We previously reported electrocardiogram characteristics during outflow tract ventricular arrhythmias that helped distinguish VT related to ARVD/C from idiopathic VT. To prospectively validate these criteria. We created a risk score by using a derivation cohort. Two experienced electrophysiologists blinded to the diagnosis prospectively scored patients with VT/premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with left bundle branch block/inferior axis pattern in a validation cohort of 37 ARVD/C tracings and 49 idiopathic VT tracings. All patients with ARVD/C had their diagnosis confirmed based on the revised task force criteria. Patients with idiopathic VT were selected based on structurally normal hearts with documented right ventricular outflow tract VT successfully treated with ablation. The scoring system provides 3 points for sinus rhythm anterior T-wave inversions in leads V1-V3 and during ventricular arrhythmia: 2 points for QRS duration in lead Iâ¥120 ms, 2 points for QRS notching, and 1 point for precordial transition at lead V5 or later. A score of 5 or greater was able to correctly distinguish ARVD/C from idiopathic VT 93% of the time, with a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 91%. We describe a simple scoring algorithm that uses 12-lead electrocardiogram characteristics to effectively distinguish right ventricular outflow tract arrhythmias originating from patients with ARVD/C versus patients with idiopathic VT.

But there are certain situations like a recent myocardial infarction where the standard guidelines do not recommend the implantation of an ICD while the patient can still be at a risk of demise due to a life threatening ventricular arrhythmia. There could also be a temporary indication for protection while explanting an infected ICD system. The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is a device which comes to the rescue in such situations. In this brief review, we discuss the historical aspects of the development of a WCD, technical aspects as well as the clinical trial data and real world scenario of its use.

Trends in the time of day that arrhythmias occur also were noted. We sought to establish whether pediatric and young adult congenital heart disease implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) recipients have circadian or seasonal variability in shock frequency, similar to adult populations. Data from ICD patients at six pediatric centers in North America were analyzed to assess the timing of life-threatening arrhythmias. The populations consisted of children and adults with congenital heart disease and ICDs placed for malignant arrhythmias. Data were considered in 46 patients who received appropriate therapy (total 139 episodes) for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Multiple variables were analyzed, including time of day, day of week, and month of year. In contrast to previously studied adult patients, fewer events occurred in the early morning (7.5%), with the most therapies occurring between 6 P.M. and midnight (35%). An increased frequency of therapies was observed in the fall and winter (September-January), representing 60% of all appropriate shocks. Unlike adult populations, Mondays did not have an increased frequency of malignant arrhythmias. Pediatric and adult congenital heart disease populations have moderate seasonal and 24-hour variation in ICD event rate, with some distinctly different peaks than those seen in typical adult ICD populations. These findings suggest circadian variation in arrhythmia vulnerability that may differ from conventional occupational, physical, or emotional stressors.

However, there are limited data on the association between excess weight and the risk of ectopic ventricular activity. We investigated the association between body mass index (BMI) and the risk for ectopic ventricular activity (defined as multiple ventricular premature beats (â¥3), ventricular bigeminy, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or sustained ventricular tachycardia) during exercise stress testing among 22,516 apparently healthy men and women who attended periodic health screening examinations between the years 2000 and 2014. All subjects had completed maximal exercise stress testing annually according to the Bruce protocol. Subjects were divided at baseline into three groups: normal weight (BMIââ¥â18.5âkg/m(2) and<25; Nâ=â9,994), overweight (BMIââ¥â25 andâ<â30; Nâ=â9,613) and obese (BMIââ¥â30; Nâ=â2,906). The mean age of study subjects was 47âÂ±â10 years and 72% were men. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the cumulative probability for the development of exercise-induced ectopic ventricular activity arrhythmias was highest among obese subjects, intermediate among overweight subjects and lowest among subjects with normal weight (3.4%, 2.7% and 2.2% respectively; pâ<â0.001). Multivariate binary logistic regression with repeated measures of 92,619 ESTs, showed that obese subjects were 33% more likely to have ectopic ventricular arrhythmias during exercise compared with subjects with normal weight (pâ=â0.005), and that each 1âkg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with a significant 4% (pâ=â0.002) increased adjusted risk for exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Obesity is independently associated with increased likelihood of ectopic ventricular arrhythmia during exercise.

A phaeochromocytoma was diagnosed on the basis of the urinary concentration of catecholamines and computerised tomography of the adrenal glands. After stabilisation of his cardiac rhythm and blood pressure with alpha and beta adrenergic blockade and anti-arrhythmic treatment the right adrenal gland, which contained the tumour, was successfully resected. The diagnosis of a phaeochromocytoma should be considered when recurrent ventricular arrhythmias are associated with intermittent hypertension after myocardial infarction.

A. 3rd; Michaud, G.; Zipes, D. P.; El-Sherif, N.; Venditti, F. J.; Rosenbaum, D. S.; Albrecht, P.; Wang, P. J.; Cohen, R. J.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nThis investigation was performed to evaluate the feasibility of detecting repolarization alternans with the heart rate elevated with a bicycle exercise protocol. Sensitive spectral signal-processing techniques are able to detect beat-to-beat alternation of the amplitude of the T wave, which is not visible on standard electrocardiogram. Previous animal and human investigations using atrial or ventricular pacing have demonstrated that T-wave alternans is a marker of vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias. Using a spectral analysis technique incorporating noise reduction signal-processing software, we evaluated electrical alternans at rest and with the heart rate elevated during a bicycle exercise protocol. In this study we defined optimal criteria for electrical alternans to separate patients from those without inducible arrhythmias. Alternans and signal-averaged electrocardiographic results were compared with the results of vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias as defined by induction of sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation at electrophysiologic evaluation. In 27 patients alternans recorded at rest and with exercise had a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 75%, and overall clinical accuracy of 80% (p <0.003). In this patient population the signal-averaged electrocardiogram was not a significant predictor of arrhythmia vulnerability. This is the first study to report that repolarization alternans can be detected with heart rate elevated with a bicycle exercise protocol. Alternans measured using this technique is an accurate predictor of arrhythmia inducibility.\n\nStatins as anti-arrhythmics: a systematic review part II: effects on risk of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbuissa, Hussam; O'Keefe, James H; Bybee, Kevin A\n\n2009-10-01\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that statins may possess anti-arrhythmic properties in addition to their lipid-lowering effects. Studies which reported the association of statins with the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias were identified through a systematic review of the published literature. Statins have been associated with a significant reductions in ventricular arrhythmia in cardiomyopathy patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, although randomized trials have not been completed. Published data suggests that statins may possess anti-arrhythmic properties that reduce the propensity for ventricular arrhythmias. Most of this data is observational; more randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed.\n\n[Complex ventricular arrhythmias and carvedilol: efficacy in hemodialyzed uremic patients].\n\nPubMed\n\nCice, G; Tagliamonte, E; Ferrara, L; Di Benedetto, A; Iacono, A\n\n1998-06-01\n\nCarvedilol has been shown to be effective in systemic hypertension and coronary artery disease in patients with end-stage renal disease, on maintenance hemodialysis. The aim of our study was to assess the effects of carvedilol on ventricular arrhythmias in these patients. Ninety-eight uremic patients maintained on hemodialysis, with complex ventricular arrhythmias (class III, IV and V of Lown's classification), not only during dialysis, were included in the study. They were divided into two groups, with mild-to-moderate hypertension or coronary artery disease. The efficacy and safety of carvedilol (50 mg/day) was compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized, double-blind study. Carvedilol significantly reduced, in both hypertensive and ischemic patients, total ventricular premature contractions (82.7 +/- 11.3 vs 358.1 +/- 73.9, p < 0.001; 88.3 +/- 24.4 vs 369.9 +/- 77.8, p < 0.001), repetitive ventricular premature contractions (1.3 +/- 1.3 vs 6.3 +/- 3.5, p < 0.001; 1.2 +/- 0.7 vs 6.9 +/- 2.6, p < 0.001) and episodes of ventricular tachycardia (1.1 +/- 1.2 vs 11.8 +/- 7.5, p < 0.001; 1.4 +/- 1.2 vs 14.0 +/- 8.3, p < 0.001). In placebo-treated patients, instead, these parameters were not significantly changed (329.1 +/- 76.5 vs 361.7 +/- 71.7, NS, and 324.6 +/- 79.7 vs 359.3 +/- 58.1, NS; 6.2 +/- 3.7 vs 7.3 +/- 3.7, NS, and 4.9 +/- 2.2 vs 6.1 +/- 3.2, NS; 9.8 +/- 6.3 vs 13.3 +/- 8.0, NS, and 9.0 +/- 6.2 vs 12.4 +/- 7.8, NS). Carvedilol confirmed a significant effect on myocardial ischemia and systemic hypertension. No significant side effects were reported. Ventricular arrhythmias are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on hemodialysis. They are often due to an underlying cardiac disease, namely systemic hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy and coronary artery disease. The results of our study show that the antiarrhythmic effect of carvedilol is linked, at least partly, to an improvement of the underlying cardiac disease.

We describe our initial experience with the new module during ablation of ventricular arrhythmias. Eighteen consecutive patients with idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias or ischemic ventricular tachycardia (VT) were studied. In the latter group, a combined endocardial and epicardial ablation was performed. Of the 14 patients with idiopathic arrhythmias, 12 were ablated in the outflow tract (OT), 1 in the midseptal left ventricle, and 1 at the left posterior fascicular area; acute successful ablation was achieved in 11 (78.6%) patients. The procedure was discontinued due to close proximity of the arrhythmia origin to the coronary arteries (CA) in 2 patients. Acute successful uncomplicated ablation was achieved in all 4 patients with ischemic VT. During ablation in the coronary cusps commissures, the CARTOÂ® Segmentation Module accurately defined the cusps anatomy. The precise anatomic location provided by the module assisted in successfully ablating when information from activation mapping was not optimal, by ablating at the opposite side of the cusps. In addition, by demonstrating the precise location of the CA, it allowed safe ablation of arrhythmias that originated in close proximity to the CA both in the OT area and the epicardium, eliminating the need for repeat angiography. The CARTOÂ® Segmentation Module is useful for accurate definition of the exact anatomic location of ventricular arrhythmias and for safely ablating them especially in close proximity to the CA.

Material and Methods: Fourty two children with mitral valve prolapse and 32 healthy children were enrolled into the study. Twelve-lead electrocardiograms, autonomic function tests, echocardiography and 24-hour rhythm Holter tests were performed. Electrocardiograms were magnified digitally. The QT length was corrected according to heart rate. The patients were grouped according to the number of premature ventricular contractions and presence of complex ventricular arhythmia in the 24-hour rhythm Holter monitor test. Heart rate variability measurements were calculated automatically from the 24-hour rhythm Holter monitor test. Orthostatic hypotension and resting heart rate were used as autonomic function tests. Results: The mean age was 13.9Â±3.3 years in the patient group and 14.6Â±3.1 years in the control group (p>0.05). Thirty four of the patients (81%) were female and eight (19%) were male. Twenty five of the control subjects (78%) were female and seven (22%) were male. The QT dispersion and heart rate corrected QT interval were found to be significantly increased in the children with primary mitral valve prolapse when compared with the control group (56Â±16 ms vs. 43Â±11 ms, p=0.001; 426Â±25 ms vs. 407Â±26 ms, p=0.002, respectively). In 24-hour rhythm Holter monitor tests, ventricular arrhythmias were found in 21 out of 42 patients (50%) and 6 out of 32 control subjects (18.8%) (p=0.006). QT dispersion was found to be significantly increased in patients with premature ventricular contractions â¥ 10/day and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias compared to the control group without ventricular premature beats (p=0.002). There was no significant difference in autonomic function tests and heart rate variability measurements between the patient and control\n\nRisk stratification personalised model for prediction of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients with chronic heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nFrolov, Alexander Vladimirovich; Vaikhanskaya, Tatjana Gennadjevna; Melnikova, Olga Petrovna; Vorobiev, Anatoly Pavlovich; Guel, Ludmila Michajlovna\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe development of prognostic factors of life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) continues to maintain its priority and relevance in cardiology. The development of a method of personalised prognosis based on multifactorial analysis of the risk factors associated with life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances is considered a key research and clinical task. To design a prognostic and mathematical model to define personalised risk for life-threatening VTA in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The study included 240 patients with CHF (mean-age of 50.5 Â± 12.1 years; left ventricular ejection fraction 32.8 Â± 10.9%; follow-up period 36.8 Â± 5.7 months). The participants received basic therapy for heart failure. The elec-trocardiogram (ECG) markers of myocardial electrical instability were assessed including microvolt T-wave alternans, heart rate turbulence, heart rate deceleration, and QT dispersion. Additionally, echocardiography and Holter monitoring (HM) were performed. The cardiovascular events were considered as primary endpoints, including SCD, paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) based on HM-ECG data, and data obtained from implantable device interrogation (CRT-D, ICD) as well as appropriated shocks. During the follow-up period, 66 (27.5%) subjects with CHF showed adverse arrhythmic events, including nine SCD events and 57 VTAs. Data from a stepwise discriminant analysis of cumulative ECG-markers of myocardial electrical instability were used to make a mathematical model of preliminary VTA risk stratification. Uni- and multivariate Cox logistic regression analysis were performed to define an individualised risk stratification model of SCD/VTA. A binary logistic regression model demonstrated a high prognostic significance of discriminant function with a classification sensitivity of 80.8% and specificity of 99.1% (F = 31.2; c2 = 143.2; p < 0.0001).

It can be a 'lifesaving' procedure in the acute setting of VA storm. Current reports on ablation in VA storm are in the form of small series and have relative small representation in a large observational series. The purpose of this study was to systematically synthesize the available literature to appreciate the efficacy and safety of ablation in the setting of VA storm. The medical electronic databases through 31 January 2012 were searched. Ventricular arrhythmia storm was defined as recurrent (â¥ 3 episodes or defibrillator therapies in 24 h) or incessant (continuous >12 h) VA. Studies reporting data on VA storm patients at the individual or study level were included. A total of 471 VA storm patients from 39 publications were collated for the analysis. All VAs were successfully ablated in 72% [95% confidence interval (CI) 71-89%] and 9% (95% CI: 3-10%) had a failed procedure. Procedure-related mortality occurred in three patients (0.6%). Only 6% patients had a recurrence of VA storm. The recurrence of VA was significantly higher after ablation for arrhythmic storm of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) relative to ventricular fibrillation or polymorphic VT with underlying cardiomyopathy (odds ratio 3.76; 95% CI: 1.65-8.57; P = 0.002). During the follow-up (61 Â± 37 weeks), 17% of patients died (heart failure 62%, arrhythmias 23%, and non-cardiac 15%) with 55% deaths occurring within 12 weeks of intervention. The odds of death were four times higher after a failed procedure compared with those with a successful procedure (95% CI: 2.04-8.01, P < 0.001). Ventricular arrhythmia storm ablation has high-acute success rates, with a low rate of recurrent storms. Heart failure is the dominant cause of death in the long term. Failure of the acute procedure carries a high mortality.\n\nPrevention of ventricular arrhythmia and calcium dysregulation in a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia mouse model carrying calsequestrin-2 mutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlcalai, Ronny; Wakimoto, Hiroko; Arad, Michael; Planer, David; Konno, Tetsuo; Wang, Libin; Seidman, Jon G; Seidman, Christine E; Berul, Charles I\n\n2011-03-01\n\nCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial arrhythmic syndrome caused by mutations in genes encoding the calcium-regulation proteins cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) or calsequestrin-2 (CASQ2). Mechanistic studies indicate that CPVT is mediated by diastolic Ca(2+) overload and increased Ca(2+) leak through the RyR2 channel, implying that treatment targeting these defects might be efficacious in CPVT. CPVT mouse models that lack CASQ2 were treated with Ca(2+) -channel inhibitors, Î²-adrenergic inhibitors, or Mg(2+) . Treatment effects on ventricular arrhythmia, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein expression and Ca(2+) transients of isolated myocytes were assessed. Each study agent reduced the frequency of stress-induced ventricular arrhythmia in mutant mice. The Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil was most efficacious and completely prevented arrhythmia in 85% of mice. Verapamil significantly increased the SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes, diminished diastolic Ca(2+) overload, increased systolic Ca(2+) amplitude, and prevented Ca(2+) oscillations in stressed mutant myocytes. Ca(2+) channel inhibition by verapamil rectified abnormal calcium handling in CPVT myocytes and prevented ventricular arrhythmias. Verapamil-induced partial normalization of SR Ca(2+) content in mutant myocytes implicates CASQ2 as modulator of RyR2 activity, rather than or in addition to, Ca(2+) buffer protein. Agents such as verapamil that attenuate cardiomyocyte calcium overload are appropriate for assessing clinical efficacy in human CPVT.

We used implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) records of ventricular tachyarrhythmias to assess the role of air pollution as a trigger of these potentially life-threatening events. The study cohort consisted of 203 cardiac patients with ICD devices in the Boston metropolitan area who were followed for an average of 3.1 years between 1995 and 2002. Fine particle mass and gaseous air pollution plus temperature and relative humidity were measured on almost all days, and black carbon, sulfate, and particle number on a subset of days. Date, time, and intracardiac electrograms of ICD-detected arrhythmias were downloaded at the patientsâ regular follow-up visits (about every 3 months). Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were identified by electrophysiologist review. Risk of ventricular arrhythmias associated with air pollution was estimated with logistic regression, adjusting for season, temperature, relative humidity, day of the week, patient, and a recent prior arrhythmia. We found increased risks of ventricular arrhythmias associated with 2-day mean exposure for all air pollutants considered, although these associations were not statistically significant. We found statistically significant associations between air pollution and ventricular arrhythmias for episodes within 3 days of a previous arrhythmia. The associations of ventricular tachyarrhythmias with fine particle mass, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and black carbon suggest a link with motor vehicle pollutants. The associations with sulfate suggest a link with stationary fossil fuel combustion sources.

However, overall arrhythmia risk was not increased in large-scale CRT clinical trials. Increased TDR as measured by T(peak ) -T(end) (TpTe) was associated with arrhythmia risk in CRT in a single-center study. This study investigates whether QT interval, TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio are associated with ventricular arrhythmias in patients with CRT-defibrillator (CRT-D). Post-CRT-D implant electrocardiograms of 128 patients (age 71.3 years Â± 10.3) with at least 2 months of follow-up at our institution's device clinic (mean follow-up of 28.5 months Â± 17) were analyzed for QT interval, TpTe, and TpTe/QT ratio. Incidence of ventricular arrhythmias was determined based on routine and directed device interrogations. Appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation was delivered in 18 patients (14%), and nonsustained ve"
