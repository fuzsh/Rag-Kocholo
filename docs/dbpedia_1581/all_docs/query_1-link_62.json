        "text": "Many things have changed on The Masked Singer stage over the years, but one thing has remained mercifully the same — the clue packages.\n\nEach season, all of the contestants get their own batch of cryptic hints and references to help the audience at home figure out who is under the masks, and season 8 is no different. And like each season before it, EW is rounding up all of the info to be gleaned from each clue package, as well as what happens during the singers' time on stage, and the latest guesses from panelists Ken Jeong, Nicole Scherzinger, Jenny McCarthy-Wahlberg, and Robin Thicke.\n\nWithout further ado, here's everything you need to know about each of these new contestants. Can you figure out who's under the mask?\n\nHarp\n\nClue package:\n\n\"Life does have a funny way of putting you exactly where you need to be,\" she says to start the first clue package\n\nShe's shown being judged at the pearly gates of Heaven\n\nShe auditioned for \"the biggest show in the world\" as a teen, but she didn't \"fit the mold\" and was turned down\n\nShe's shown dancing, and later seen wiping tears away\n\nEven though she was devastated, Harp later got the opportunity of a lifetime and became \"an idol for anyone that felt like an outsider\"\n\n\"The no's in my life made me stronger, but I am not taking no for an answer tonight\"\n\nBinoculars, a call sheet listing Harp in a leading role, two bouquets of roses, a person wearing a witch's hat, and 3D glasses all appear in the first clue package\n\n\"It feels incredible to be crowned the first queen of season 8, but I am up against two new singers tonight and I have to crush this performance,\" she says to start the second clue package\n\nThe casting sheet, witch hat, binoculars, and 3D glasses all appear again, this time on pedestals\n\n\"I've been labeled competitive my whole life, but I don't see that as a bad thing — it means you've worked hard to be the best\"\n\nSays she's \"always on time\"\n\nHer new clue for her second clue package is a CD called \"Night Night\"\n\n\"This queen lives to fight another day. But heavy is the head that wears the crown, and between me and you, it can be pretty nerve-racking knowing I have to go back into battle again,\" she says to start the third clue package\n\n\"This week, I'm trying to remind myself to have a little fun, live in the moment, and just enjoy my reign\"\n\nHer clues from previous packages are shown again\n\nHer new clue for her third clue package is a Christmas-themed cupcake with a Santa on it: \"Hey, I get royalties for these, right?\"\n\nTo start the fourth package, she says she really wants to win because she's always been a fan of the show\n\nShe and her family and friends always watch the show and it's been very hard not saying anything to them\n\nHer man thinks she's filming a movie, no one knows except her mom, because they're \"very alike\"\n\n\"She was a singer just like me, she's my rock. If I had a handful of people that believed in me the way that my mom believes in me, I know that I can soar so far.
