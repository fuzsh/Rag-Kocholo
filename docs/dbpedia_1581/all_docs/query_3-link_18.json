        "text": "There’s an emotional moment at the end of Celine Dion‘s new documentary I Am in which she triumphantly sings her favorite song after experiencing a stroke.\n\n“I gotta be me / Gotta be I / Gotta be who I know I am inside / Can finally breathe, taking it in, look at me flying!” Celine sings.\n\nThat song is “Who I Am” by Wyn Starks and he’s reacting to the moment.\n\nWyn actually rose to fame just two years ago after singing the original song during his audition on America’s Got Talent. He made it to the Qualifiers round, but didn’t advance to the finals.\n\nAfter watching Celine‘s documentary, Wyn wrote on Instagram, “I have no words to describe what I’m feeling! I’ll be on cloud 9 for the rest of my life! It’s such a full circle moment because @celinedion has been such an inspiration to me and her music has helped me get through so many obstacles in my life so seeing her belt out ‘Who I Am’ with such strength and resilience in spite of everything she’s going through will be a moment I’ll never forget. I still get emotional thinking about it!”\n\nHead inside to listen to the song and to read the lyrics…\n\nYou can listen to Wyn‘s song below!\n\nWatch the America’s Got Talent audition below!\n\nRead the “Who I Am” lyrics below!"
