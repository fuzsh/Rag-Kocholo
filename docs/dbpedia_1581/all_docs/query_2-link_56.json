        "text": "In a world dominated by singles and streaming, it's even more important for albums to be cherished and preserved. The Recording Academy celebrates albums as essential, beloved formats of artistic expression, especially in the coveted Album Of The Year Category.\n\nFrom gutsy pop to psychedelic soul, the eight nominees for Album Of The Year at the 2024 GRAMMYs — which are notably dominated by women, people of color, and the queer community — are a reflection of the joyous diversity within the music community.\n\nBelow, take a deeper dive into who's in the running for Album Of The Year on Music's Biggest Night.\n\nJon Batiste — World Music Radio\n\nOn the opening track of World Music Radio, Jon Batiste importantly reminds listeners that music is not just a passive recreation, but an experience. Or, at least the interstellar radio host Billy Bob does.\n\nNarrated by Billy Bob, Batiste's 21-song concept album is made to sound like it's an actual radio station; amid intermittent static and between-song messaging, the station welcomes a slew of high-profile musical guests, ranging from Lana Del Rey to NewJeans to Lil Wayne. Including everything from smooth DJ interludes to crystal-clear saxophone solos to sparkling piano riffs, World Music Radio has something for everyone within its one-hour runtime.\n\nWith five GRAMMYs under his belt — including one for Album Of The Year — Batiste understands the significance of pushing boundaries in music. Consequently, World Music Radio questions genre as much as it questions how we can make the world a more inclusive place.\n\nAccording to an Instagram post, Batiste's album aims to \"'re-examine and redefine terms like world music as they exist in the culture.\"' The \"'re\"' prefix is what music is all about: reliving memories, reinventing what's been done before, and redefining things we previously thought we understood. Riding the airwaves all the way to an Album Of The Year nomination, Batiste's latest visionary work reminds us to reconsider what we think we know — and then, dial in.\n\nboygenius — the record\n\nOn the vinyl version of the record, a locked groove leaves listeners perpetually listening to a single word: \"'waiting.\"' The lyric goes eternally unfinished.\n\nBut good things come to those who wait, and for boygenius, a year like 2023 has never made this more discernible. Less than a year after the group debuted at Coachella and embarked on not one but two tours, they're now in the running for the GRAMMY for Album Of The Year.\n\nSkyrocketing to headliner fame this year, the indie rock supergroup composed of Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus released their debut album back in spring. Preceded only by a singular, successful EP from five years prior, the record proves itself to be very much worth the wait: chock-full of dreams of arson, $20 bills, and calls to kill the bourgeois, it froths with charisma and jocular amity.\n\nThis marks boygenius' first collective GRAMMY nomination, as well as the first nominations for Baker and Dacus. Bridgers' Punisher made her a 4-time GRAMMY nominee at the 63rd GRAMMY Awards. But it's not the group's only nod at the 2024 show — boygenius earned six nominations in total, including Record Of The Year.\n\nWhat makes the record so momentous is its testament to the trio's vibrant, long-standing friendship — specifically, a companionship rooted in queerness, as well as in opposition to the idea that women in the industry should be pitted against each other. the record intensely and unmistakably feels the gravity of their organic bond, and in this way, it stands for so much more than 12 songs.\n\nMiley Cyrus — Endless Summer Vacation\n\nIt's time to give Miley Cyrus her flowers. The GRAMMY-nominated artist already struck gold earlier this year, with her liberating lead single \"'Flowers\"' breaking records left and right. The track blossoms with the sweet nectar of independence, and this embrace of freedom is the heart of Endless Summer Vacation.\n\nHer album's title denotes a perpetual stretch into eternity, but if there's one thing Cyrus is known for, it's change. Whether it's radically altering her style or switching up her aesthetic, the longtime pop queen knows that creative adaptability is one of her many strengths.\n\nEndless Summer Vacation spotlights this versatility, from Cyrus warmly soaking up \"'Violet Chemistry\"' to reflecting on when she \"'Used To Be Young.\"' Her signature gravelly drawl suits the album's disco-infused, beachy production — a major shift from the unyielding, punk rock of predecessor Plastic Hearts (2020), or the power pop-trap spotlighted on her 2019 EP, SHE IS COMING.\n\nNotably, this marks Cyrus' first Album Of The Year nomination for her own work (she received a nod for her feature on Lil Nas X's 2021 LP Montero). The honor praises not just Endless Summer Vacation as a salient career highlight, but also applauds the singer's resilience after years of musical shapeshifting — Cyrus was due for a well-deserved vacation.\n\nLana Del Rey — Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd\n\nOn her ninth studio album, Lana Del Rey honors kintsugi, or the ​​Japanese art of repairing broken pottery pieces with gold. Now, with an Album Of The Year nomination, she could be taking home GRAMMY gold.\n\nDel Rey's last nomination in this Big Four category was for Norman Fucking Rockwell! at the 2020 GRAMMYs. While NFR! freewheeled along the West Coast, paving a soft rock landscape inspired by '70s Americana, Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd leans away from Del Rey's habitual worldbuilding. Instead, the singer let spirituality guide her music-making process, dabbling in everything from gospel to trap.\n\nEven though Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd is Del Rey's most natural album yet, the work still feels otherworldly. Throwing caution to the wind, she delves into the multifaceted nature of her identity, candidly examining personal matters relating to religion, mortality and family.\n\nIn the same way a pottery artist might delicately approach kintsugi, Del Rey approaches making music with a keen eye and open heart. She searches for ways to sculpt beauty from flaws and fractures — after all, that's how the light gets in.\n\nJanelle Monáe — The Age Of Pleasure\n\nThe rush of a crush, the sigh from a single touch — euphoria comes in many beautiful forms, and on her latest album, Janelle Monáe wants you to experience all of them.\n\nThe Age Of Pleasure ushers in Monáe's vision of rapture, dreamily blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. The 10-time GRAMMY-nominated artist has long defied labels, whether it be regarding genre or their personal identity, and their latest album celebrates love in all its color and fluidity.\n\nIt's all smooth sailing in The Age Of Pleasure. Soulfully, the multihyphenate singer swims through romantic R&B, plunges into funky rap, and bathes in soft pop radiance — but above all, Monáe floats. She's untroubled and unbothered, and that's more than enough to warrant raising a glass.\n\nMonáe's nomination for Album Of The Year acknowledges not just the thrill of living a life carefree, but also celebrates the divinity of all-encompassing love. The album is more than hips and lips galore: beyond giving into passion, it's about cherishing community and, most importantly, choosing joy for yourself.\n\nOlivia Rodrigo — GUTS\n\nThough she's the youngest nominee on the list, Olivia Rodrigo knows she has nothing to prove.\n\nAlready a 3-time GRAMMY winner before her 20th birthday, the \"'drivers license\"' singer/songwriter unsurprisingly resisted the sophomore slump. On her plucky second album GUTS, she leans a little more into punkish pent-up rage than the crying-on-the-bathroom-floor heartache of her 2021 debut, SOUR — and impressively, her determination earned her a second consecutive GRAMMY nomination for Album Of The Year.\n\nWhether her self-reflection appears in the form of piano-led balladry or pop-rock headbangers, Rodrigo tackles wilted relationships, growing pains and everything in between with her characteristically refreshing charm. From the gritty, Joan Didion-inspired \"'all american b—\"' to the leave-him-to-rot breakup anthem \"'vampire,\"' GUTS knows how to make a statement without forgetting to have a bit of fun.\n\nRodrigo, who won the GRAMMY for Best New Artist at the 2022 ceremony, understands the resonant power of her pen, and the singer's swift ascent to fame mirrors her swelling talent. It's already been almost two years since the smash success of \"'drivers license,\"' but Rodrigo isn't taking her foot off the gas.\n\nTaylor Swift — Midnights\n\nBest believe Taylor Swift is still bejeweled.\n\nOf the megastar's extensive discography, Midnights might just be its crowning jewel thus far. Swift's tenth studio album dives deeper into pop experimentalism, steering away from the indie folk journeys that folklore and evermore so calmly encompassed; Midnights silhouettes the life of a beloved, high-profile \"'Anti-Hero\"' and assertively offers some of Swift's most ambitious work yet.\n\nIt's this fearless ambition that makes Swift no stranger to the GRAMMYs. On top of nearly 50 nominations total, the 12-time GRAMMY winner is the first and only woman solo artist to win Album Of The Year three times for her solo recordings. As Swifties know, she loves to break her own records — and if Midnights takes home GRAMMY gold, Swift would become the artist with the most Album Of The Year wins of all time.\n\nThis Midnights nomination marks a climax for Swift's career, and even though the singer has collected countless milestones, this year might be her most colossal yet. As she continues to bring all of her musical eras to life, Swift isn't just reliving her musical past — she's writing her future.\n\nSZA — SOS\n\nSZA knows how to build anticipation. Keeping her fans in suspense for five years, the prolific GRAMMY winner released her 2022 sophomore album SOS to wide critical acclaim — and while its title suggests a sense of helplessness, SOS puts forth plenty of strength.\n\nSZA understands the vast power of vulnerability, and she wields this power expertly, whether it be forcefully or delicately. During the album's wade through loneliness and insecurity, the singer occasionally employs features from friends like Don Toliver, Phoebe Bridgers, and Travis Scott, but above all, SZA's self-discovery remains in the spotlight.\n\nThe R&B star scored her first GRAMMY just two years ago, sharing the award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance with Doja Cat for their lovable collaboration \"'Kiss Me More\"' at the 2022 GRAMMYs. While the pop-rap collaboration bubbles with lost-in-the-moment delight, SOS looks at life with a wider lens; in her single \"'Shirt,\"' SZA admits that she's \"'in the dark right now/ feeling lost but I like it,\"' and it's these glimmers of self-assurance that show her a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThis Album Of The Year nomination nods to the singer's personal growth since her 2017 debut Ctrl. Although SZA sings about a fear of letting other people define her, SOS rejects other people's terms and soars as a bold reclamation: by defying others, she rediscovers herself.\n\nThe 2024 GRAMMYs, officially known as the 66th GRAMMY Awards, returns to Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena on Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024, and will broadcast live on the CBS Television Network and stream live and on-demand on Paramount+ at 8-11:30 p.m. ET/5-8:30 p.m. PT.\n\nThe Recording Academy and GRAMMY.com do not endorse any particular artist, submission or nominee over another. The results of the GRAMMY Awards, including winners and nominees, are solely dependent on the Recording Academy's Voting Membership.\n\n2024 GRAMMY Nominations: See The Full Nominees List\n\nThree months after OneRepublic began promoting their sixth album, Artificial Paradise, in February 2022, the band unexpectedly had their biggest release in nearly a decade. The pop-rock band's carefree jam, \"I Ain't Worried,\" soundtracked Top Gun: Maverick's most memeable scene and quickly became a global smash — ultimately delaying album plans in favor of promoting their latest hit.\n\nTwo years later, \"I Ain't Worried\" is one of 16 tracks on Artificial Paradise, which arrived July 12. It's a seamless blend of songs that will resonate with longtime and newer fans alike. From the layered production of \"Hurt,\" to the feel-good vibes of \"Serotonin,\" to the evocative lyrics of \"Last Holiday,\" Artificial Paradise shows that OneRepublic's sound is as dialed-in as it is ever-evolving.\n\nThe album also marks the end of an era for OneRepublic, as it's the last in their contract with Interscope Records. But for the group's singer, Ryan Tedder, that means the future is even more exciting than it's been in their entire 15-year career.\n\n\"I've never been more motivated to write the best material of my life than this very moment,\" he asserts. \"I'm taking it as a challenge. We've had a lot of fun, and a lot of uplifting records for the last seven or eight years, but I also want to tap back into some deeper material with the band.\"\n\nAs he's been prepping Artificial Paradise with his OneRepublic cohorts, Tedder has also been as busy as he's ever been working with other artists. His career as a songwriter/producer took off almost simultaneously with OneRepublic's 2007 breakthrough, \"Apologize\" (his first major behind-the-board hit was Leona Lewis' \"Bleeding Love\"); to this day he's one of the go-to guys for pop's biggest names, from BLACKPINK to Tate McRae.\n\nTedder sat down with GRAMMY.com to share some of his most prominent memories of OneRepublic's biggest songs, as well as some of the hits he's written with Beyoncé, Adele, Taylor Swift and more.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Apologize,\" 'Dreaming Out Loud' (2007)\n\nI was producing and writing other songs for different artists on Epic and Atlantic — I was just cutting my teeth as a songwriter in L.A. This is like 2004. I was at my lowest mentally and financially. I was completely broke. Creditors chasing me, literally dodging the taxman and getting my car repoed, everything.\n\nI had that song in my back pocket for four years. A buddy of mine just reminded me last month, a songwriter from Nashville — Ashley Gorley, actually. We had a session last month, me, him and Amy Allen, and he brought it up. He was like, \"Is it true, the story about 'Apologize'? You were completely broke living in L.A. and Epic Records offered you like 100 grand or something just for the right to record the song on one of their artists?\"\n\nAnd that is true. It was, like, 20 [grand], then 50, then 100. And I was salivating. I was, like, I need this money so bad. And I give so many songs to other people, but with that song, I drew a line in the sand and said, \"No one will sing this song but me. I will die with this song.\"\n\nIt was my story, and I just didn't want anyone else to sing it. It was really that simple. It was a song about my past relationships, it was deeply personal. And it was also the song that — I spent two years trying to figure out what my sound was gonna be. I was a solo artist… and I wasn't landing on anything compelling. Then I landed on \"Apologize\" and a couple of other songs, and I was like, These songs make me think of a band, not solo artist material. So it was the song that led me to the sound of OneRepublic, and it also led me to the idea that I should start a band and not be a solo artist.\n\nWe do it every night. I'll never not do it. I've never gotten sick of it once. Every night that we do it, whether I'm in Houston or Hong Kong, I look out at the crowd and look at the band, and I'm like, Wow. This is the song that got us here.\n\nBeyoncé — \"Halo,\" 'I Am…Sacha Fierce' (2008)\n\nWe were halfway through promoting Dreaming Out Loud, our first album. I played basketball every day on tour, and I snapped my Achilles. The tour got canceled. The doctor told me not to even write. And I had this one sliver of an afternoon where my wife had to run an errand. And because I'm sadistic and crazy, I texted [songwriter] Evan Bogart, \"I got a three-hour window, race over here. Beyoncé called me and asked me to write her a song. I want to do it with you.\" He had just come off his huge Rihanna No. 1, and we had an Ashley Tisdale single together.\n\nWhen you write enough songs, not every day do the clouds part and God looks down on you and goes, \"Here.\" But that's what happened on that day. I turn on the keyboard, the first sound that I play is the opening sound of the song. Sounds like angels singing. And we wrote the song pretty quick, as I recall.\n\nI didn't get a response [from Beyoncé after sending \"Halo\" over], which I've now learned is very, very typical of her. I did Miley Cyrus and Beyoncé \"II MOST WANTED\" [from COWBOY CARTER] — I didn't know that was coming out 'til five days before it came out. And when I did \"XO\" [from 2013's Beyoncé], I found out that \"XO\" was coming out 12 hours before it came out. That's how she operates.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Good Life,\" 'Waking Up' (2009)\n\n[\"Good Life\"] was kind of a Hail Mary. We already knew that \"All the Right Moves\" would be the first single [from Waking Up]. We knew that \"Secrets\" was the second single. And in the 11th hour, our engineer at the time — who I ended up signing as a songwriter, Noel Zancanella — had this drum loop that he had made, and he played it for Brent [Kutzle] in our band. Brent said, \"You gotta hear this drum loop that Noel made. It's incredible.\"\n\nHe played it for me the next morning, and I was like, \"Yo throw some chords to this. I'm writing to this today.\" They threw some chords down, and the first thing out of my mouth was, [sings] \"Oh, this has gotta be the good life.\"\n\nIt's the perfect example of, oftentimes, the chord I've tried to strike with this band with some of our bigger records, [which] is happy sad. Where you feel nostalgic and kind of melancholic, but at the same time, euphoric. That's what those chords and that melody did for me.\n\nI was like, \"Hey guys, would it be weird if I made the hook a whistle?\" And everyone was like, \"No! Do not whistle!\" They're like, \"Name the last hit song that had a whistle.\" And the only one I could think of was, like, Scorpion from like, 1988. [Laughs.] So I thought, To hell with it, man, it's been long enough, who cares? Let's try it. And the whistle kind of made the record. It became such a signature thing.\n\nAdele — \"Rumour Has It,\" '21' (2011)\n\n\"Rumour Has It\" was the first song I did in probably a four year period, with any artist, that wasn't a ballad. All any artist ever wanted me to write with them or for them, was ballads, because of \"Halo,\" and \"Apologize\" and \"Bleeding Love.\"\n\nI begged [Adele] to do a [song with] tempo, because we did \"Turning Tables,\" another ballad. She was in a feisty mood [that day], so I was like, \"Okay, we're doing a tempo today!\"\n\nRick Rubin was originally producing the whole album. I was determined to produce Adele, not just write — because I wanted a shot to show her that I could, and to show myself. I stayed later after she left, and I remember thinking, What can I do in this record in this song that could be so difficult to reproduce that it might land me the gig?\n\nSo I intentionally muted the click track, changed the tempo, and [created that] whole piano bridge. I was making it up as I went. When she got in that morning. I said, \"I have a crazy idea for a bridge. It's a movie.\" She listens and she says, \"This is really different, I like this! How do we write to this?\"\n\nI mean, it was very difficult. [But] we finished the song. She recorded the entire song that day. She recorded the whole song in one take. I've never seen anyone do that in my life — before or since.\n\nThen I didn't hear from her for six months. Because I handed over the files, and Rick Rubin's doing it, so I don't need to check on it. I randomly check on the status of the song — and at this point, if you're a songwriter or producer, you're assuming that they're not keeping the songs. Her manager emails my manager, \"Hey, good news — she's keeping both songs they did, and she wants Ryan to finish 'Rumour Has It' production and mix it.\"\n\nWhen I finally asked her, months later — probably at the GRAMMYs — I said, \"Why didn't [Rick] do it?\" She said, \"Oh he did. It's that damn bridge! Nobody could figure out what the hell you were doing…It was so problematic that we just gave up on it.\"\n\nOneRepublic — \"Counting Stars,\" 'Native' (2013)\n\nI was in a Beyoncé camp in the Hamptons writing for the self-titled album. [There were] a bunch of people in the house — me, Greg Kurstin, Sia — it was a fun group of people. I had four days there, and every morning I'd get up an hour and a half before I had to leave, make a coffee, and start prepping for the day. On the third day, I got up, I'm in the basement of this house at like 7 in the morning, and I'm coming up with ideas. I stumble across that chord progression, the guitar and the melody. It was instant shivers up my spine.\n\n\"Lately I've been losing sleep, dreaming about the things that we could be\" is the only line that I had. [My] first thought was, I should play this for Beyoncé, and then I'm listening to it and going, This is not Beyoncé, not even remotely. It'd be a waste. So I tabled it, and I texted the guys in my band, \"Hey, I think I have a potentially really big record. I'm going to finish it when I get back to Denver.\"\n\nI got back the next week, started recording it, did four or five versions of the chorus, bouncing all the versions off my wife, and then eventually landed it. And when I played it for the band, they were like, \"This is our favorite song.\"\n\nTaylor Swift — \"Welcome to New York,\" '1989' (2014)\n\nIt was my second session with Taylor. The first one was [1989's] \"I Know Places,\" and she sent me a voice memo. I was looking for a house in Venice [California], because we were spending so much time in L.A. So that whole memory is attached to me migrating back to Los Angeles.\n\nBut I knew what she was talking about, because I lived in New York, and I remember the feeling — endless possibilities, all the different people and races and sexes and loves. That was her New York chapter. She was so excited to be there. If you never lived there, and especially if you get there and you've got a little money in the pocket, it is so exhilarating.\n\nIt was me just kind of witnessing her brilliant, fast-paced, lyrical wizardry. [Co-producer] Max [Martin] and I had a conversation nine months later at the GRAMMYs, when we had literally just won for 1989. He kind of laughed, he pointed to all the other producers on the album, and he's like, \"If she had, like, three more hours in the day, she would just figure out what we do and she would do it. And she wouldn't need any of us.\"\n\nAnd I still think that's true. Some people are just forces of nature in and among themselves, and she's one of them. She just blew me away. She's the most talented top liner I've ever been in a room with, bar none. If you're talking lyric and melody, I've never been in a room with anyone faster, more adept, knows more what they want to say, focused, efficient, and just talented.\n\nJonas Brothers — \"Sucker,\" 'Happiness Begins' (2019)\n\nI had gone through a pretty dry spell mentally, emotionally. I had just burned it at both ends and tapped out, call it end of 2016. So, really, all of 2017 for me was a blur and a wash. I did a bunch of sessions in the first three months of the year, and then I just couldn't get a song out. I kept having, song after song, artists telling me it's the first single, [then] the song was not even on the album. I had never experienced that in my career.\n\nI went six to nine months without finishing a song, which for me is unheard of. Andrew Watt kind of roped me back into working with him. We did \"Easier\" for 5 Seconds of Summer, and we did some Sam Smith and some Miley Cyrus, and right in that same window, I did this song \"Sucker.\" Two [or] three months later, Wendy Goldstein from Republic [Records] heard the record, I had sent it to her. She'd said, very quietly, \"We're relaunching the Jonas Brothers. They want you to be involved in a major way. Do you have anything?\"\n\nShe calls me, she goes, \"Ryan, do not play this for anybody else. This is their comeback single. It's a No. 1 record. Watch what we're gonna do.\" And she delivered.\n\nOneRepublic — \"I Ain't Worried,\" 'Top Gun: Maverick' Soundtrack (2022)\n\nMy memory is, being in lockdown in COVID, and just being like, Who knows when this is going to end, working out of my Airstream at my house. I had done a lot of songs for movies over the years, and [for] that particular [song] Randy Spendlove, who runs [music at] Paramount, called me.\n\nI end up Zooming with Tom Cruise [and Top Gun: Maverick director] Jerry Bruckheimer — everybody's in lockdown during post-production. The overarching memory was, Holy cow, I'm doing the scene, I'm doing the song for Top Gun. I can't believe this is happening. But the only way I knew how to approach it, rather than to, like, overreact and s— the bed, was, It's just another day.\n\nI do prescription songs for movies, TV, film all the time. I love a brief. It's so antithetical to most writers. I'm either uncontrollably lazy or the most productive person you've ever met. And the dividing line between the two is, if I'm chasing some directive, some motivation, some endpoint, then I can be wildly productive.\n\nI just thought, I'm going to do the absolute best thing I can do for this scene and serve the film. OneRepublic being the performing artist was not on the menu in my mind. I just told them, \"I think you need a cool indie band sounding, like, breakbeat.\" I used adjectives to describe what I heard when I saw the scene, and Tom got really ramped and excited.\n\nYou could argue [it's the biggest song] since the band started. The thing about it is, it's kind of become one of those every summer [hits]. And when it blew up, that's what Tom said. He said, \"Mark my words, dude. You're gonna have a hit with this every summer for, like, the next 20 years or more.\"\n\nAnd that's what happened. The moment Memorial Day happened, \"I Ain't Worried\" got defrosted and marched itself back into the top 100.\n\nTate McRae — \"Greedy,\" 'THINK LATER' (2023)\n\nWe had \"10:35\" [with Tiësto] the previous year that had been, like, a No. 1 in the UK and across Europe and Australia. So we were coming off the back of that, and the one thing she was clear about was, \"That is not the direction of what I want to do.\"\n\nIf my memory serves me correct, \"greedy\" was the next to last session we had. Everything we had done up to that point was kind of dark, midtempo, emotional. So \"greedy\" was the weirdo outlier. I kept pushing her to do a dance record. I was like, \"Tate, there's a lot of people that have great voices, and there's a lot of people who can write, but none of those people are professional dancers like you are. Your secret weapon is the thing you're not using. In this game and this career, you've got to use every asset that you have and exploit it.\"\n\nThere was a lot of cajoling. On that day, we did it, and I thought it was badass, and loved it. And she was like, \"Ugh, what do we just do? What is this?\"\n\nSo then it was just, like, months, months and months of me constantly bringing that song back up, and playing it for her, and annoying the s— out of her. And she came around on it.\n\nShe has very specific taste. So much of the music with Tate, it really is her steering. I'll do what I think is like a finished version of a song, and then she will push everyone for weeks, if not months, to extract every ounce of everything out of them, to push the song harder, further, edgier — 19 versions of a song, until finally she goes, \"Okay, this is the one.\" She's a perfectionist.\n\nOneRepublic — \"Last Holiday,\" 'Artificial Paradise' (2024)\n\nI love [our latest single] \"Hurt,\" but my favorite song on the album is called \"Last Holiday.\" I probably started the beginning of that lyric, I'm not joking, seven, eight years ago. But I didn't finish it 'til this past year.\n\nThe verses are little maxims and words of advice that I've been given throughout the years. It's almost cynical in a way, the song. When I wrote the chorus, I was definitely in kind of a down place. So the opening line is, \"So I don't believe in the stars anymore/ They never gave me what I wished for.\" And it's, obviously, a very not-so-slight reference to \"Counting Stars.\" But it's also hopeful — \"We've got some problems, okay, but this isn't our last holiday.\"\n\nIt's very simple sentiments. Press pause. Take some moments. Find God before it all ends. All these things with this big, soaring chorus. Musically and emotionally and sonically, that song — and \"Hurt,\" for sure — but \"Last Holiday\" is extremely us-sounding.\n\nThe biggest enemy that we've had over the course of 18 years, I'll be the first to volunteer, is, this ever-evolving, undulating sound. No one's gonna accuse me of making these super complex concept albums, because that's just not how my brain's wired. I grew up listening to the radio. I didn't grow up hanging out in the Bowery in CBGBs listening to Nick Cave. So for us, the downside to that, and for me doing all these songs for all these other people, is the constant push and pull of \"What is their sound? What genre is it?\"\n\nI couldn't put a pin in exactly what the sound is, but what I would say is, if you look at the last 18 years, a song like \"Last Holiday\" really encompasses, sonically, what this band is about. It's very moving, and emotional, and dynamic. It takes me to a place — that's the best way for me to put it. And hopefully the listener finds the same.\n\nLatest News & Exclusive Videos\n\nWhen it comes to exploring Lana Del Rey's discography, it can be hard to know where to start. The pop songstress has a sprawling catalog, consisting of nine albums, four EPs, and a handful of other standalone singles.\n\nYou could begin with Born To Die, her highly influential major label debut, or its moody follow-up, Ultraviolence, her first to top the Billboard charts and ultimately establish her staying power as an artist. Perhaps you choose to start with her Album Of The Year GRAMMY nominees Norman F—ing Rockwell! or Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd.\n\nOr maybe you're an incredibly diehard fan with encyclopedic knowledge who wants to start where it all began, on Rey's first album Lana Del Ray (note the spelling difference), which never saw official physical release and contained just a rough draft of the cultural force Del Rey would become.\n\nFollowing Del Rey's career is rewarding, but requires some commitment to listen to, and understand, everything she's put out. It can be intimidating to approach an artist with such a robust, varied catalog. You can go with more mainstream pop offerings like her collaborations with Taylor Swift and The Weeknd, or dive into something more inspired by the orchestra like early track \"National Anthem.\" This is true for fans with any amount of exposure to Del Rey, from those just discovering her music to those looking to become an expert.\n\nAs Ultraviolence turns 10, GRAMMY.com presents the levels of Lana, a series of jumping off points to explore all the music Del Rey has to offer. Dig into three songs across four different levels of fandom — Beginner, Intermediate, Expert, and Diehard — to further your Lana knowledge. These songs give a peek into various aspects of Del Rey's body of work, and serve as encouragement to continue exploring.\n\nBeginner\n\n\"Summertime Sadness,\" Born to Die (2012)\n\nThe Beginner Level of Lana is for those who have heard of Del Rey, but have never sat down with her music before. This makes \"Summertime Sadness,\" her biggest song to date, the perfect place to start.\n\nIt's reductive to simply label Del Rey's oeuvre \"sad girl music,\" but for the uninitiated, it's a simple descriptor to start with. \"Summertime Sadness\" combines the pop production, elements of classical music, and existential despair that is present throughout Del Rey's career. And Cedric Gervais' remix has turned \"Summertime Sadness\" into a club banger to help her appeal to those who gravitate more to the dance floor.\n\n\"Young and Beautiful,\" The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film (2013)\n\nIt speaks to Del Rey's cultural reach and musical vision that a non-album single is one of her most iconic songs. Written for the 2013 The Great Gatsby movie adaptation, \"Young and Beautiful\" also serves as a helpful thematic introduction to Del Rey.\n\nThroughout her writing, Del Rey examines youth, Americana, and the American Dream, and how each of these uniquely American ideals are full of decay and liable to corruption and disappointment. On \"Young and Beautiful,\" she asks if her lover will still care when she's no longer either of those things, and the somber tone indicates the likely answer. This song will introduce fans to Del Rey's penchant for using orchestral backing for her music, and illustrate how intertwined with popular culture she really is.\n\n\"Mariners Apartment Complex,\" Norman F—ing Rockwell! (2019)\n\nThe past two songs have introduced Del Rey's \"sad girl\" persona, but over the years, she has evolved far past being so easily defined. \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" is the perfect next step for beginners, opening up the popular perception to her to reveal more of her complexity.\n\nLyrically, it finds Del Rey pushing back on sorrow being her only emotion. Musically, it's a great introduction to more of the ethereal, synth-filled sound that has come out of her partnership with superproducer Jack Antonoff. And in terms of placing her within the culture, \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" is the first single from her sixth album Norman F—ing Rockwell!, which earned Del Rey her first Album Of The Year nomination in 2019.\n\nIntermediate\n\n\"Brooklyn Baby,\" Ultraviolence (2014)\n\nAt the Intermediate level, it's time to start getting into more of the nuances that Del Rey brings to her writing — and, in turn, how much she's influenced her peers, and how respected she is amongst them.\n\n\"Brooklyn Baby\" is some of her sharpest writing, equal parts playful needling and affectionate tribute to the snooty New York art scene. One of the most indelible tracks off of Ultraviolence, the song epitomizes the entire record's move towards more rock instrumentation, with a guitar-based sound. It references legendary rock artist Lou Reed, who was slated to appear on the track before his death in late 2013, showing just how highly she's thought of by other artists.\n\n\"Love,\" Lust for Life (2017)\n\nFor as much as Del Rey recognizes how fallible many of our culture's ideals are, she's always been a romantic. \"Love,\" the first single from 2017's Lust for Life, is a prime example of this.\n\nThe whole album is a big play on her love of classic Hollywood imagery, including the video for \"Love,\" and the song is a dreamy throwback to '50s love songs. If \"Mariners Apartment Complex\" chides anyone thinking Del Rey can only be sad, \"Love\" is a full rebuke, as it's one of her most straightforwardly optimistic tracks. Commercially, \"Love\" was Del Rey's highest-charting feat since Ultraviolence (landing at No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100), further establishing that she had longevity.\n\n\"Chemtrails over the Country Club,\" Chemtrails over the Country Club (2021)\n\n2020 and the pandemic did a number on everyone, radically altering lives and shaking faith in many of the institutions of everyday life. That unmooring is felt on Del Rey's seventh album, Chemtrails over the Country Club, and particularly on its title track.\n\nDel Rey is as sharp as ever in exploring the pulse of American society on the dreamy, disaffected number. \"You're in the wind, I'm in the water/ Nobody's son, nobody's daughter\" is a breathtaking piece of writing that became a TikTok favorite, illustrating Del Rey's continuing ability to relate to the youth.\n\nExpert\n\n\"F—ed My Way Up To the Top,\" Ultraviolence (2014)\n\nAs we enter the realm of the Expert Lana Del Rey fan, we're firmly out of album singles territory. From here, it's all deep cuts and non-album tracks.\n\nDel Rey has been no stranger to controversy — some warranted, some not. An early knock against her was that the mid-20th century aesthetic and perceived submissiveness in her music was anti-women or anti-feminist, a surface-level reading that in the years since has been largely dispelled.\n\nThe singer has worked to combat it herself on tracks like Ultraviolence's \"F—ed My Way Up To the Top,\" which takes that perceived notion to its extreme. At the same time, it's another in a long line of tracks in which Del Rey has embraced her own sexuality and sensuality as something to be celebrated and claimed, not something to be ashamed of.\n\n\"Art Deco,\" Honeymoon (2015)\n\n2015's Honeymoon isn't necessarily underappreciated, as it received positive reviews upon release debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, but \"Art Deco\" isn't likely to appear on many playlists. It should, though, as the track illustrates how much of musical chameleon Del Rey really is, with a sultry, hip-hop inspired rolling beat.\n\nIt treads some familiar territory thematically with trying to find acceptance in night life, but Del Rey is really comfortable here. She shows more of her knowledge of art history by relating the subject of the song to the defining characteristics of the titular art movement, revealing just how much thought she puts into her aesthetic.\n\n\"Fingertips,\" Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd (2023)\n\nDid you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd is arguably Del Rey's most intimate album, exploring details of her family and their history that fans have only previously seen brief glimpses of. At the same time, it is partially an examination of her own legacy and work, only natural for someone with as much output as Del Rey, let alone her frequent references to death and finality.\n\nBoth of these things combine in \"Fingertips,\" a standout track from the album. A nearly six-minute long ballad, it's musically airy while emotionally devastating — and, for a true Del Rey fan, encapsulates so much of her legacy in just one song.\n\nDiehard\n\n\"Yayo,\" Paradise (2012)\n\nFor fans in the Diehard level, everything before is old news. This is for fans who want to fully live the Lana life, who have all her albums on vinyl and have carefully built their image and fashion around her.\n\nSpeaking of her image, this section starts with \"Yayo,\" an extremely early deep cut. This track originally appeared on Lana Del Ray before being reworked and rereleased on the Paradise EP in 2012. The song leans heavier than most into the '50s imagery and floats along at a dreamy, lilting pace. While not as refined as her later work, \"Yayo\" is an indicator Del Rey had a solid idea of who she wanted to be as soon as she started.\n\n\"Season of the Witch,\" Non-album Single (2019)\n\nDel Rey has done several covers throughout her career, and quite successfully. Norman F—ing Rockwell! features her cover of Sublime's \"Doin' Time,\" which is one of the highlight tracks from the record. Less known is Del Rey's spooky cover of '60s classic \"Season of the Witch.\"\n\nWritten for the 2019 horror film Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, the song fits Del Rey's style perfectly. The Americana/flower crown aesthetic of her younger years always leaned witch-adjacent, and Del Rey takes her soft vocals into playfully sinister territory. It's a fun cover, and shows just how many gems Del Rey has in her discography for those fans willing to dig.\n\n\"Say Yes to Heaven,\" Non-album Single (2023)\n\n\"Say Yes to Heaven\" was never supposed to be heard. A late cut from Ultraviolence, the track remained buried for years before being leaked in 2016. It lurked on the internet, only known to superfans, before gaining steam with the rise of TikTok and finally seeing an official release in 2023.\n\nThe deep cut is peak Del Rey ballad material, a tender love song imploring her partner to accept happiness. It's another rebuke of the idea that she can't be happy, and it gives insight into some of her earlier writing.\n\nAs a resurfaced older track, \"Say Yes to Heaven\" may not necessarily indicate the direction Lana Del Rey is set to go on her forthcoming album, Lasso (especially considering Del Rey has teased she's \"going country\" for her next release). But it's a beautiful reminder of the affecting narratives and arresting vocals that have made her beloved to so many, no matter the level of fandom.\n\nSongbook: A Guide To Billie Eilish's Musical Ventures & Artistic Ingenuity\n\nMoby’s past and present are converging in a serendipitous way. The multiple-GRAMMY nominee is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his seminal work, Play, the best-selling electronic dance music album of all time, and the release of his latest album, always centered at night.\n\nWhere Play was a solitary creation experience for Moby, always centered at night is wholly collaborative. Recognizable names on the album are Lady Blackbird on the blues-drenched \"dark days\" and serpentwithfeet on the emotive \"on air.\" But always centered at night’s features are mainly lesser-known artists, such as the late Benjamin Zephaniah on the liquid jungle sounds of \"where is your pride?\" and Choklate on the slow grooves of \"sweet moon.\"\n\nMoby’s music proves to have staying power: His early ‘90s dance hits \"Go\" and \"Next is the E\" still rip up dancefloors; the songs on Play are met with instant emotional reactions from millennials who heard them growing up. Moby is even experiencing a resurgence of sorts with Gen Z. In 2023, Australian drum ‘n’ bass DJ/producer Luude and UK vocalist Issey Cross reimagined Moby’s classic \"Porcelain\" into \"Oh My.\" Earlier this year, Moby released \"You and Me\" with Italian DJ/producer Anfisa Letyago.\n\nMusic is just one of Moby’s many creative ventures. He wrote and directedPunk Rock Vegan Movie as well as writing and starring in his homemade documentary,Moby Doc. The two films are produced by his production company, Little Walnut, which also makes music videos, shorts and the podcast \"Moby Pod.\" Moby and co-host Lindsay Hicks have an eclectic array of guests, from actor Joe Manganiello to Ed Begley, Jr., Steve-O and Hunter Biden. The podcast interviews have led to \"some of the most meaningful interpersonal experiences,\" Moby tells GRAMMY.com.\n\nA upcoming episode of \"Moby Pod\" dedicated to Play was taped live over two evenings at Los Angeles’ Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The episode focuses on Moby recounting his singular experiences around the unexpected success of that album — particularly considering the abject failure of his previous album, Animal Rights. The narrative was broken up by acoustic performances of songs from Play, as well as material from Always Centered at Night (which arrives June 14) with special guest Lady Blackbird. Prior to the taping, Moby spoke to GRAMMY.com about both albums.\n\n'Always centered at night' started as a label imprint then became the title of your latest album. How did that happen?\n\nI realized pretty quickly that I just wanted to make music and not necessarily worry about being a label boss. Why make more busy work for myself?\n\nThe first few songs were this pandemic process of going to SoundCloud, Spotify, YouTube and asking people for recommendations to find voices that I wasn’t familiar with, and then figuring out how to get in touch with them. The vast majority of the time, they would take the music I sent them and write something phenomenal.\n\nThat's the most interesting part of working with singers you've never met: You don't know what you're going to get. My only guidance was: Let yourself be creative, let yourself be idiosyncratic, let the lyrics be poetic. We're not writing for a pop audience, we don't need to dumb it down. Although, apparently Lady Blackbird is one of Taylor Swift's favorite singers.\n\nGuiding the collaborators away from pop music is an unusual directive, although perhaps not for you?\n\nWhat is both sad and interesting is pop has come to dominate the musical landscape to such an extent that it seems a lot of musicians don't know they're allowed to do anything else. Some younger people have grown up with nothing but pop music. Danaé Wellington, who sings \"Wild Flame,\" her first pass of lyrics were pop. I went back to her and said, \"Please be yourself, be poetic.\" And she said, \"Well, that’s interesting because I’m the poet laureate of Manchester.\" So getting her to disregard pop lyrics and write something much more personal and idiosyncratic was actually easy and really special.\n\nYou certainly weren’t going in the pop direction when making 'Play,' but it ended up being an extremely popular album. Did you have a feeling it was going to blow up the way it did?\n\nI have a funny story. I had a date in January 1999 in New York. We went out drinking and I had just gotten back the mastered version of Play. We're back at my apartment, and before our date became \"grown up,\" we listened to the record from start to finish. She actually liked it. And I thought, Huh, that's interesting. I didn't think anyone was going to like this record.\n\nYou didn’t feel anything different during the making of 'Play?'\n\nI knew to the core of my being that Play was going to be a complete, abject failure. There was no doubt in my mind whatsoever. It was going to be my last record and it was going to fail. That was the time of people going into studios and spending half a million dollars. It was Backstreet Boys and Limp Bizkit and NSYNC; big major label records that were flawlessly produced. Play was made literally in my bedroom.\n\nI slept under the stairs like Harry Potter in my loft on Mott Street. I had one bedroom and that's where I made the record on the cheapest of cheap equipment held up literally on milk crates. Two of the songs were recorded to cassette, that's how cheap the record was. It was this weird record made by a has-been, a footnote from the early rave days. There was no world where I thought it was going to be even slightly successful. Daniel Miller from Mute said — and I remember this very clearly — \"I think this record might sell over 50,000 copies.\" And I said, \"That’s kind of you to say but let's admit that this is going to be a failure. Thank you for releasing my last record.\"\n\nWas your approach in making 'Play' different from other albums?\n\nThe record I had made before Play, Animal Rights, was this weird, noisy metal punk industrial record that almost everybody hated. I remember this moment so vividly: I was playing Glastonbury in 1998 and it was one of those miserable Glastonbury years. When it's good, it's paradise; it's really special. But the first time I played, it was disgusting, truly. A foot and a half of mud everywhere, incessant rain and cold. I was telling my manager that I wanted to make another punk rock metal record. And he said the most gentle thing, \"I know you enjoy making punk rock and metal. People really enjoy when you make electronic music.\"\n\nThe way he said it, he wasn't saying, \"You would help your career by making electronic music.\" He simply said, \"People enjoy it.\" If I had been my manager, I would have said, \"You're a f—ing idiot. Everyone hated that record. What sort of mental illness and masochism is compelling you to do it again?\" Like Freud said, the definition of mental illness is doing the same thing and expecting different results. But his response was very emotional and gentle and sweet, and that got through to me. I had this moment where I realized, I can make music that potentially people will enjoy that will make them happy. Why not pursue that?\n\nThat was what made me not spend my time in ‘98 making an album inspired by Sepultura and Pantera and instead make something more melodic and electronic.\n\nAfter years of swearing off touring, what’s making you hit stages this summer?\n\nI love playing live music. If you asked me to come over and play Neil Young songs in your backyard, I would say yes happily, in a second. But going on tour, the hotels and airports and everything, I really dislike it.\n\nMy manager tricked me. He found strategically the only way to get me to go on tour was to give the money to animal rights charities. My philanthropic Achilles heel. The only thing that would get me to go on tour. It's a brief tour of Europe, pretty big venues, which is interesting for an old guy, but when the tour ends, I will have less money than when the tour begins.\n\nYour DJ sets are great fun. Would you consider doing DJ dates locally?\n\nEvery now and then I’ll do something. But there’s two problems. As I've become very old and very sober, I go to sleep at 9 p.m. This young guy I was helping who was newly sober, he's a DJ. He was doing a DJ set in L.A. and he said, \"You should come down. There's this cool underground scene.\" I said, \"Great! What time are you playing?\" And he said \"I’m going on at 1 a.m.\" By that point I've been asleep for almost five hours.\n\nI got invited to a dinner party recently that started at 8 p.m. and I was like, \"What are you on? Cocaine in Ibiza? You're having dinner at 8 p.m. What craziness is that? That’s when you're putting on your soft clothes and watching a '30 Rock' rerun before bed. That's not going out time.\" And the other thing is, unfortunately, like a lot of middle aged or elderly musicians, I have a little bit of tinnitus so I have to be very cautious around loud music.\n\nAre you going to write a third memoir at any point?\n\nOnly when I figure out something to write. It's definitely not going to be anecdotes about sobriety because my anecdotes are: woke up at 5 a.m., had a smoothie, read The New York Times, lamented the fact that people are voting for Trump, went for a hike, worked on music, played with Bagel the dog, worked on music some more went to sleep, good night. It would be so repetitive and boring.\n\nIt has to be something about lived experience and wisdom. But I don't know if I've necessarily gotten to the point where I have good enough lived experience and wisdom to share with anyone. Maybe if I get to that point, I'll probably be wrong, but nonetheless, that would warrant maybe writing another book.\n\nMachinedrum's New Album '3FOR82' Taps Into The Spirit Of His Younger Years"
