        "text": "The music video for the song “Try That in a Small Town” by the country music star Jason Aldean appears to have been edited to remove violent images of Black Lives Matter protests after criticism that the song and the accompanying video were offensive.\n\nThe updated video, six seconds shorter than the original, no longer includes video clips from Fox News in Atlanta showing police violence against protesters during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. However, the video is still set at a Tennessee courthouse that was the site of a lynching, and it includes other clips of criminal activity and clashes between protesters and the police.\n\nPortions of the Fox News clip appeared twice in the original music video, first projected against the exterior of the courthouse as Aldean sings about actions that he claims would not be tolerated in a small town: “carjack an old lady,” “cuss out a cop,” “stomp on the flag.”\n\nThe removed clip was filmed in Atlanta during the nationwide protests that followed the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. The demonstrations grew so tense in Atlanta that the city’s mayor urged protesters to go home, and the governor of Georgia declared a state of emergency.\n\nCountry Music Television stopped airing the video last week, but did not confirm that it had done so in response to backlash against the song. The network and Mr. Aldean’s record label, BBR Music Group, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. In a statement to The Washington Post, which reported the changes to the video, BBR said that “the video footage was edited due to third-party copyright clearance issues.”\n\nAldean’s music video was filmed outside the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tenn., where an 18-year-old Black man, Henry Choate, was lynched by a white mob in 1927 after he was falsely accused of raping a 16-year-old white girl.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
