        "text": "Lady MarmaladeLabelle\n\nThe chorus of \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir\" in \"Lady Marmalade\" is French for \"Do you want to sleep with me tonight?\" When Labelle performed it on television, they had to change it to \"Voulez-vous danser avec moi ce soir\" (Do you want to dance with me tonight?).\n\nThe ReflexDuran Duran\n\n\"The Reflex\" became a #1 hit for Duran Duran when Nile Rodgers remixed it using a sampler. Simon Le Bon refuses to say what it's about, but says it's \"kind of childish song.\"\n\nHelter SkelterThe Beatles\n\nThe first version of The Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" was a 27-minute jam, so you can imagine what Ringo was going through pounding away on drums. To convince the guys he needed a break, he screamed, \"I've got blisters on my fingers!\" This was included on the fadeout.\n\nYou're A Friend Of MineClarence Clemons\n\nClarence Clemons, who played the sax in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, had the biggest solo hit of anyone in the group - aside from Springsteen - when \"You're A Friend Of Mine\" hit #18 in 1985.\n\nCruiseFlorida Georgia Line\n\n\"Cruise\" climbed from 6-5 on the Hot 100 in its 34th week. In doing so it set a record for the slowest ascent to the Top 5 in the chart's history, which was beaten by Imagine Dragon's \"Radioactive\" 42-week clamber to #4 three weeks later.\n\nJetPaul McCartney & Wings\n\nThe Australian band Jet took their name from the 1973 song of the same by Paul McCartney and Wings.\n\nChris Squire of YesSongwriter Interviews\n\nOne of the most dynamic bass player/songwriters of his time, Chris is the only member of Yes who has been with the band since they formed in 1968.\n\nHe Hit Me (And It Felt Like A Kiss): A History Of Abuse PopSong Writing\n\nSongs that seem to glorify violence against women are often misinterpreted - but not always.\n\nMuhammad Ali: His Musical Legacy and the Songs he InspiredSong Writing\n\nBefore he was the champ, Ali released an album called I Am The Greatest!, but his musical influence is best heard in the songs he inspired.\n\nFrancesca BattistelliSongwriter Interviews\n\nThe 2011 Artist of the Year at the Dove Awards isn't your typical gospel diva, and she thinks that's a good thing."
