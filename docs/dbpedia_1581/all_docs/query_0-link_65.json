In 2014, our economy added jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s. The unemployment rate plunged to its lowest point in over 6 years, far faster than economists predicted. Ten million Americans gained the security of health coverage. And we continued to cut our dependence on foreign oil and invest in renewable energy, making us number one in the world in oil, gas, and wind power. These achievements took place against a backdrop of longer‑term economic strength. Since the crisis, we’ve seen our deficits cut by twothirds, our stock market double, and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years. The housing market is rebounding. Manufacturers are adding jobs. More Americans are finishing college than ever before. Now America is poised for another good year, as long as Washington works to keep this progress going. But even as the economic recovery is touching more lives, we need to do more to restore the link between hard work and opportunity for every American. That’s the idea behind middle-class economics—the simple fact that our country does best when everyone has a fair shot, does their fair share, and plays by the same set of rules. Over the course of this year, I will continue to put forward ideas to make that fundamental value a reality—not just so that more Americans can share in their country’s success, but so that more Americans can contribute to their country’s success. At this moment when our economy is growing and creating jobs, we’ve got to work twice as hard, especially Economic Report of the President | 3 in Washington, to build on our momentum. And I will not let politics or partisanship roll back the progress we’ve achieved on so many fronts. I want to work with the Congress to invest in middle-class economics in three key ways. First, let’s help working families achieve greater security in a world of constant change. That means giving Americans the peace of mind that comes with knowing they’ll be able to afford childcare, college, health care, a home, and retirement. At a time when having both parents work is an economic necessity for many families, high-quality, affordable childcare isn’t a nice-to-have— it’s a must-have. That’s why I’ve proposed tripling the maximum child tax credit to $3,000 per child per year, and creating more slots in childcare programs nationwide. Meanwhile, we’re the only advanced country in the world that doesn’t guarantee workers either paid sick leave or paid maternity leave. Let’s help more States adopt paid leave laws and put it to a vote in Washington too, because no parent should ever have to choose between earning a paycheck and taking care of a sick child. Of course, nothing helps families make ends meet like raising wages. We still need to pass a law that guarantees women equal pay for equal work. We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they’ve earned. We still have a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. That means minimum-wage workers are actually earning 20 percent less than they were when President Reagan was in office. It’s time to give some of America’s hardest-working people a raise, because wages of $14,500 a year are simply not enough to support a family. In a 21st century economy, we should lower taxes on working families and make mortgage premiums more affordable, so responsible families can own their own homes. And we should strengthen programs like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid that help workers save for retirement and protect them from the harshest adversities. These ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of Americans, and I look forward to working with the Congress to get them done. Second, middle-class economics means helping more Americans upgrade their skills so that they can earn higher wages down the road. By the end of the decade, two in three jobs will require some higher education. Yet far too many young people are priced out of college. That can’t stand in the 21st century, and that’s why my Administration has 4 | Economic Report of the President announced a bold new plan to offer 2 free years of community college to responsible students. Let’s work together to make college as free and universal as high school, because a modern economy requires a highly educated workforce. While we strengthen the higher education system, my Administration is working to update our job training system and connect community colleges with local employers to train workers directly for existing, highpaying jobs. And I’ve encouraged more companies to offer educational benefits and paid apprenticeships so more workers have a chance to earn a higher‑paying job even if they don’t have a higher education. Finally, as we better train our workers, we need to ensure that our economy keeps creating high-skilled, high-wage jobs for our workers to fill. That means building the most competitive economy anywhere, so that more businesses locate and hire in the United States. Let’s start by making sure that our businesses have 21st century infrastructure—modern ports, stronger bridges, better roads, clean water, clean energy, faster trains, and the fastest internet. A bipartisan infrastructure plan would create thousands of middle-class jobs and support economic growth for decades to come. Investments in science, technology, and research and development can fuel new inventions and breakthroughs that will keep American businesses one step ahead of the competition. And protecting a free and open internet, and extending its reach to every classroom and community in America, will ensure that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world. At a time when 95 percent of the world’s consumers live outside our borders, new trade agreements would help American businesses reach new markets and put stronger environmental and labor standards in place, to ensure that all countries are playing by the same, fair set of rules. The trade deals that my Administration is negotiating in the Atlantic and the Pacific regions would do just that. And to make our economy more competitive, let’s build a tax code that truly helps middle-class families get ahead. Let’s reform our business tax system to close wasteful loopholes, lower the rate, and simplify the system so small business owners spend less time on accounting and more time running their businesses. And let’s reform our broken immigration system, so the United States continues to be the number one destination for highly-skilled immigrants. Economic Report of the President | 5 Over the past 6 years, America has risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. A new foundation is laid. A new future is ready to be written. It’s up to all of us—Democrats, Republicans, and Independents—to write it together. the white house february 2015 6 | Economic Report of the President the annual report of the council of economic advisers letter of transmittal Council of Economic Advisers Washington, D.C., February 19, 2015 Mr. President: The Council of Economic Advisers herewith submits its 2015 Annual Report in accordance of the Employment Act of 1946 as amended by the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.

. 320 Economic Report of the President C H A P T E R 1 MIDDLE-CLASS ECONOMICS: THE ROLE OF PRODUCTIVITY, INEQUALITY, AND PARTICIPATION A s the 2015 Economic Report of the President goes to press, the U.S. economic recovery continues to accelerate. The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.8 percent over the past two years, compared with 2.1 percent in the first three-and-one-half years of the recovery. The speedup is particu‑ larly clear in the U.S. labor market, where the pace of job gains has improved each year since President Obama took office. The American private sector has created 11.8 million new jobs over 59 straight months, the longest streak on record. 2014 was the best year for overall job growth since 1999, usher‑ ing in 3.1 million new jobs, and the unemployment rate fell 1.3 percentage points between 2013 and 2014, the largest decline in three decades. A reduc‑ tion in long-term unemployment, one of the economy’s major post-crisis challenges, accounts for most of the fall in the unemployment rate. As the U.S. recovery has progressed, the economy has grown in a more sustainable way than before the global financial crisis began. In fact, the United States has improved several structural imbalances that jeopardized the economy’s stability prior to the crisis. The domestic energy production boom has reduced U.S. dependence on foreign oil, helping to narrow the current account deficit and reduce U.S. dependence on foreign borrowing. Health-care prices have been growing at the lowest rate in nearly 50 years. The Federal Budget deficit has fallen at the fastest pace since the post-World War II demobilization, and households are spending less of their income servicing debts than they have in decades. But one key benchmark of the economy goes beyond increases in national income accounts and decreases in financial deficits: the wellbeing of the middle class and those working to get into the middle class. 21 It is essential that a broad range of households share in the United States’ resurgent growth. This year’s Report views the recovery through the lens of the typical middle-class American family. It begins with a review of recent economic progress and provides historical and international context for the key factors impacting middle-class incomes: productivity growth, labor force participation, and income inequality. The President’s approach to economic policies, what he terms “middle-class economics,” is designed to improve these elements and ensure that Americans of all income levels share in the accelerating recovery. The Progress of the U.S. Economic Recovery After the global financial crisis, the United States and many other countries faced obstacles to recovery that were more challenging than those posed by a normal cyclical recession. Despite being hit particularly hard by the financial crisis, the United States has recovered faster than many of its developed-world counterparts. The recession began with a collapse in household wealth and global trade that initially exceeded the declines at the onset of the Great Depression, as shown in Figure 1-1a and Figure 1-1b. The headwinds to recovery included weak bank balance sheets that constrained credit supply, highly indebted consumers that constrained credit demand, and substantial investment overhang in key cyclical sectors such as housing.

Middle-Class Economics: The Role of Productivity, Inequality, and Participation | 23 Box 1-1: Macroeconomic Rebalancing A broad set of economic structural imbalances that pre-dated the financial crisis have improved in the recovery. The United States has reduced its indebtedness on four levels: in international trade (as a net recipient of global capital flows), in gross national saving (as a result of reduced Budget deficits), in the household sector, and in the private-business sector. On top of recent acceleration in U.S. output and employment growth, these structural improvements lay the foundation for more sustainable growth beyond the current business cycle. On the international side, the current account deficit as a share of GDP—a measure of U.S. net transactions with the rest of the world in goods, services, and income—increased steadily for nearly two decades, but fell in the Great Recession and has continued to drift down in the recovery. Recently, the deficit fell to the smallest share of GDP since the 1990s. Drivers of the recent decline include the domestic energy produc‑ tion boom and an increase in domestic saving that has reduced the U.S. need for foreign financing. Domestically, gross saving has increased as a share of the economy, driven by the reduction in Federal dissaving amid the fastest pace of deficit reduction since the demobilization after World War II. The pace of discretionary spending reductions was faster than optimal, creating challenges for growth. However, when taken together with factors such Percent of GDP 2 Figure 1-i Current Account Balance, 1970–2014 1 0 -1 -2 2014:Q3 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 1970 1980 1990 2000 Note: Shading denotes recession.

While many households still face challenges, the aggregate ratio of debt-to-disposable income in the household sector has decreased to a level last seen in 2002, as households have both increased their savings and reduced their borrowing. The combination of lower debt levels and lower interest rates has reduced the aggregate value of households’ debtservice payments to 9.9 percent of disposable income, the lowest level since at least 1980. America’s corporations have also partially shed their debt burdens. Corporate debt-to-equity ratios in the non-financial sector have retraced all of the increase that resulted from the crisis. The recovery’s challenges were compounded by unprecedented State and local government spending cuts that dragged on growth through the first few years of the recovery. A wide range of shocks and slowdowns in other countries have also restrained the U.S. recovery. The Recovery in GDP and Labor Markets Although there is more work to do, the U.S. economy has managed a lasting and growing recovery amid these challenges. Despite the steeper ini‑ tial declines, both trade and wealth recovered faster after the Great Recession 26 | Chapter 1 than during the Great Depression. In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. economy grew 0.7 percentage point faster per year than in the first three-and-one-half years of the recovery. A large increase in personal consumption growth and a shift from State and local contraction to expansion contributed to the pickup over this period. More recently, growth in 2014 was aided by a shift toward a more neutral stance for Federal fiscal policy, an important reminder of the need for policymakers to avoid returning to the harmful impact of seques‑ tration and fiscal brinksmanship. The recovery’s strength has been particularly pronounced in the labor market. The pace of total job growth rose to 260,000 a month in 2014, up from 199,000 a month in 2013, as shown in Figure 1-2. As recently as 2013, most forecasters expected that the unemployment rate would not fall to 5.6 percent until after 2017—but it did so in December 2014, as shown in Figure 1-3. The labor force participation rate has stabi‑ lized since fall 2013. Long-term unemployment and the number of workers employed part-time for economic reasons – while still elevated – have also declined. These labor market improvements have begun to translate into wage gains for middle-class workers. Average earnings for production and non‑ supervisory workers, shown in Figure 1-4, function as a reasonable proxy Figure 1-2 Average Monthly Nonfarm Employment Growth, 2008–2014 Thousand Jobs per Month 300 200 173 188 199 2011 2012 2013 260 89 100 0 -100 -200 -300 -298 -400 -500 -424 2008 2009 2010 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics; CEA calculations. 2014 Middle-Class Economics: The Role of Productivity, Inequality, and Participation | 27 Figure 1-3 Unemployment Rate and Consensus Forecasts, 2008–2014 Percent of Labor Force 11 2010 Forecast 10 9 2011 Forecast 2012 Forecast 8 2013 Forecast 7 2014 Forecast 6 5 4 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Note: Annual forecasts are current as of March of the stated year.

This real wage growth, however, still falls well short of what is needed to make up for decades of sub-par growth. Real median family incomes were at mid-1990s levels in 2013, as shown in Figure 1-5. There is no denying the strength of the aggregate recovery, but its benefits have not yet been fully shared with middle-class families. A Brief History of Middle-Class Incomes in the Postwar Period The ultimate test of an economy’s performance is the well-being of its middle class. This in turn has been shaped by three factors: how pro‑ ductivity has grown, how income is distributed, and how many people are participating in the labor force. Although many of these factors have evolved continuously, varying from year to year, it is instructive to divide the postWorld War II years into three periods that capture major differences among the trends in these three variables. Specifically, these periods are: the Age of Shared Growth from 1948 to 1973, where movements in productivity, participation, and distribution aligned; the Age of Expanded Participation from 1973 to 1995, when women entered the labor force at a rapid pace but Middle-Class Economics: The Role of Productivity, Inequality, and Participation | 29 Table 1-2 Middle-Class Income Growth and its Determinants, 1948–2013 1948-1973 Age of Expanded Participation 1973-1995 Age of Productivity Recovery 1995-2013 Average Household Income for the Bottom 90 Percent (World Top Incomes Database) 2.8% -0.4% -0.2% Median Household Income (Census Bureau) N/A 0.2% 0.0% Median Household Income with Benefits (CBO, adj. for household size) N/A 0.4% 0.4% N/A 0.7% 1.3% Age of Shared Growth Real Middle-Class Income Growth Median Household Income with Gov't Transfers/Taxes (CBO, adj. for household size) Productivity Growth (annual rates) Labor Productivity Growth 2.8% 1.4% 2.3% Total Factor Productivity Growth 1.9% 0.4% 1.1% Top 1 Percent 11.3% → 7.7% -0.1 pp/yr Income Shares Bottom 90 Percent 7.7% → 13.5% 13.5% → 17.5% +0.3 pp/yr +0.2 pp/yr 66.3% → 68.1% 68.1% → 59.5% 59.5% → 53.0% +0.1 pp/yr -0.4 pp/yr -0.4 pp/yr Labor Force Participation Rate Overall 59% → 61% +0.1 pp/yr 61% → 67% +0.3 pp/yr 67% → 63% -0.2 pp/yr Prime Age Male (25-54) 97% → 95% -0.1 pp/yr 95% → 92% -0.2 pp/yr 92% → 88% -0.2 pp/yr Prime Age Female (25-54) 35% → 52% +0.7 pp/yr 52% → 76% +1.1 pp/yr 76% → 74% -0.1 pp/yr Note: Income levels from the World Top Incomes Database and the Census Bureau are deflated with the CPIU-RS price index, and income levels from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) are deflated with the personal consumption expenditures price index.

The United States enjoyed rapid labor productivity growth, averaging 2.8 percent annually. Income inequality fell, with the share of income going to the top 1 percent falling by nearly one-third, while the share of income going to the bottom 90 percent rose slightly. Household income growth was also fueled by the increased participation of women in the workforce. Prime-age (25 to 54) female labor force participation escalated from one-third in 1948 to one-half by 1973. The combination of these three factors increased the aver‑ age income for the bottom 90 percent of households by 2.8 percent a year over this period. This measure functions as a decent proxy for the median household’s income growth because it ignores the large, asymmetric changes in income for the top 10 percent of households. At this rate, incomes double every 25 years, or about once every generation. While these levels of shared income growth and low income inequality worked to benefit the middle class, it is important to recognize that these fac‑ tors do not capture the many non-economic dimensions (such as racial and gender discrimination) on which the United States has made considerable progress over the past half-century. Accordingly, while this period illustrates the combined power of productivity, income equality, and participation to benefit the middle class, it is not necessarily a model for other important aspects of domestic policy. The Age of Expanded Participation (1973-1995) Starting in 1973 and running through 1995, two of the three factors that had been driving middle-class incomes derailed. Labor productivity growth slowed dramatically to only 1.4 percent annually, in part due to the exhaustion of pent-up innovations from World War II, reduced public investment, dislocations associated with the breakup of the Bretton Woods international monetary system, and the oil shocks of the 1970s. Not only did the economy grow more slowly in these years, but these smaller gains were distributed increasingly unequally—the share of national income that went to the top 1 percent nearly doubled, while the share that went to the bottom 90 percent fell accordingly. As a result, productivity gains did not boost middle-class incomes and average income in the bottom 90 percent declined by 0.4 percent a year during these years. One important factor that prevented a larger fall in middle-class incomes was greater labor force par‑ ticipation. The share of dual-income households rose as women surged into the labor force even faster than in the Age of Shared Growth. Middle-Class Economics: The Role of Productivity, Inequality, and Participation | 31 Some alternative and likely more accurate measures of middle-class income show slight increases during these years. Real median household income as measured by the Census Bureau rose by 0.2 percent a year from 1973 to 1995. And after including employer-paid health premiums and adjusting for changing family size, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that median income climbed 0.4 percent a year, and 0.7 percent a year after taxes and transfers. But regardless of how it is measured, middleclass income growth clearly slowed dramatically over this period. The Age of Productivity Recovery (1995-2013) The third period is defined as lasting from 1995 through 2013, though it will take a longer perspective to understand whether and how the Great Recession and the current recovery fit into this period. Amid the worst recession since the Great Depression, the average real income for house‑ holds in the bottom 90 percent declined at a 0.2 percent annual rate during these years. When including employer-paid health premiums and adjusting for family size, median income rose 0.4 percent a year according to CBO data, still considerably slower than in the Age of Shared Growth. Largely as a result of substantial tax cuts, post-tax and post-transfer incomes rose at a 1.3-percent average annual rate in this third period. Labor productivity grew at a 2.3 percent annual rate over the period as a whole, near the rates achieved in the first era, fueled by a new economy that made unprecedented advances in the production and use of informa‑ tion technology. However, these gains did little to contribute to rising wages for the middle class as the trend of worsening inequality from the previous era continued into this period. The share of income going to the bottom 90 percent fell to 53 percent, well below the 68 percent earned by this group in 1973. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate fell as women’s entry into the workforce plateaued and even started to drift down, albeit at onehalf the pace of the decline in prime-age male participation, a notable trend over the entire postwar era. After 2008, the retirement of the baby boomers added to the decline in participation. While productivity growth was high on average from 1995 to 2013, it varied substantially within this period. It was higher from 1995 to 2005, declined prior to the start of the crisis, and then was adversely affected by the crisis itself. Understanding the degree to which the years 1995 through 2013 should be considered a single regime for the productivity growth rate, or one with an adverse break in the trend during or just before the crisis, will take many more years of data and analysis. 32 | Chapter 1 The Importance of Productivity, Inequality, and Participation As productivity, the income distribution, and participation evolved over the past 65 years, middle-class incomes went from doubling once in a generation to showing almost no growth at all by some measures. But if these three factors had recently continued the strong trends observed in ear‑ lier periods, the outcome for typical families would be quite different. Four counterfactual thought experiments give a sense of the magnitudes involved in this dramatic change: • The impact of higher productivity growth. What if productivity growth from 1973 to 2013 had continued at its pace from the previous 25 years? In this scenario, incomes would have been 58 percent higher in 2013. If these gains were distributed proportionately in 2013, then the median household would have had an additional $30,000 in income. • The impact of greater income equality. What if inequality had not increased from 1973 to 2013, and instead the share of income going to the bottom 90 percent had remained the same? Even using the actual slow levels of productivity growth over that period, the 2013 income for the typical household would have been 18 percent, or about $9,000, higher. • The impact of expanded labor force participation. What if female labor force participation had continued to grow from 1995 to 2013 at the same rate that it did from 1948 to 1995 until it reached parity with male participation? Assuming that the average earnings for working women were unchanged, and maintaining the actual histories of productivity and income distribu‑ tion, the average household would have earned 6 percent more in 2013, or an additional $3,000. • The combined impact of all three factors. Finally, if all three factors had aligned—if productivity had grown at its Age of Shared Growth rate, inequality had not increased, and participation had continued to rise—then these effects would have been compounded and the typical household would have seen a 98-percent increase in its income by 2013. That is an additional $51,000 a year. In combination, these factors would have nearly doubled the typical household’s income had they sustained their more favorable readings from earlier historical periods. Productivity, inequality, and participation consti‑ tute the fundamental challenges facing the future of middle-class incomes, and this year’s Report addresses policies designed to strengthen all three. But first, this chapter situates the United States’ recent progress in these dimen‑ sions in a global context.

They do not consider second-order effects or interactive effects. The first thought experiment assumes that an increase in productivity is associated with an equal increase in the Census Bureau’s mean household income. The second thought experiment uses the Census Bureau’s mean income of the middle quintile as a proxy for median income. The third thought experiment assumes that newly-participating women will have the same average earnings as today’s working women, and halts the growth of female labor force participation when it matches male participation. The first and third thought experiments assume that income gains are distributed proportionally such that mean and median incomes grow at the same rate. Dollar gains are calculated off a base of the Census Bureau’s median household income in 2013. The fourth thought experiment compounds the effects of the first three.

The Drivers of Middle-Class Incomes: An International Comparison A wide range of advanced economies has faced similar challenges for middle-class incomes. Most of today’s large advanced economies expe‑ rienced rapid growth in the immediate post-World War II years followed by substantially slower growth and plateauing, as shown in Figure 1-6. That development took place relatively early in the United States (around 1973) and later in other countries (for example, around 1980 in France and Canada). In Japan, middle-class incomes slowed in the 1970s and have sub‑ stantially declined over the past two decades. Labor Productivity Growth The first driver of incomes—labor productivity growth—underlies the progress of both potential GDP and family income. Over the past year, the 34 | Chapter 1 Figure 1-6 Growth in Real Average Income for the Bottom 90 Percent, 1950–2013 Index, 1950=100 (log scale) 6 600 6 6 500 6 6 400 6 6 6 300 6 6 5 5 200 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 100 5 4 4 4 1950 1960 1970 Japan Germany France Italy United Kingdom Canada 2013 United States 1980 1990 2000 2010 Note: Data for all countries exclude capital gains.

Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reduced their productivity growth estimates for many high-income countries. In recent years, the United States has been somewhat better situated than many other advanced economies, in part because this country has been the center of much high-tech innova‑ tion. In fact, the United States has defied the trend in other high-income economies by experiencing a pickup in productivity growth over the last 20 years. In contrast, productivity growth has generally declined in most other high-income economies over the same period, as shown in Figure 1-7. Income Inequality The second important factor influencing the dynamics of middle-class incomes is inequality. This, too, is a global issue. In the United States, the top 1 percent has garnered a larger share of income than in any other G-7 country in each year since 1987 for which data are available, as shown in Figure 1-8. From 1990 to 2010, the top 1 percent’s income share rose 0.22 percentage point a year in the United States versus 0.14 percentage point a year in the United Kingdom. While comparable international data are scarce after 2010, the gains of the top 1 percent continued since then in the United States, until a noticeable downtick in 2013.

Although the United States has enjoyed a strong labor market recovery amid surging employment, its labor force participation rate has fallen more than that of other high-income countries. The recent decline in the labor force participation rate is largely the result of demographic changes. Since 2008, when the first of the baby boomers turned 62 and became eligible for Social Security, the baby boom has become a retirement boom. This loss of productive workers was com‑ pounded by the severe recession that hit around the same time. But even before either of these events, the economy already faced labor force par‑ ticipation challenges, including a long-running decline in male labor force participation and an end to the rapid increase in female participation. Since the early 1990s, the United States has experienced a marked decline in labor force participation among males aged 25 to 54 (“prime age”), as shown in Figure 1-9. In this regard, the U.S. experience has been something of an outlier compared to many other high-income countries. Since the financial crisis, U.S. prime-age male participation has declined by about 2.5 percentage points, while the United Kingdom has seen a small uptick and most large European economies were generally stable.

The story is somewhat similar among prime-age females. Historically, the United States showed leadership in bringing women into the workforce. In 1990, the United States ranked 7th out of 24 current OECD countries reporting prime-age female labor force participation, about 8 percentage points higher than the average of that sample. But since the late 1990s, women’s labor force participation plateaued and even started to drift down in the United States while continuing to rise in other high-income countries, as shown in Figure 1-10. As a result, in 2013 the United States ranked 19th out of those same 24 countries, falling 6 percentage points behind the United Kingdom and 3 percentage points below the sample average. A recent study found that the relative expansion of family leave and part-time work programs in other OECD countries versus the United States explains nearly one-third of the United States’ relative decline (Blau and Kahn 2013). The challenges facing productivity growth, inequality, and labor force participation are all substantial. As this Report further details, the United States has important structural opportunities that can help address each of the challenges, though the degree to which we do so will also depend on the policies that we choose to adopt. 38 | Chapter 1 The 2015 Economic Report of the President The well-being of the middle class and those working to get into the middle class is the ultimate test of an economy’s performance. The best way to grow the economy on a sustainable and inclusive basis is to address squarely the three drivers of incomes: productivity growth, income inequal‑ ity, and labor force participation. With these factors in mind, this year’s Report reviews the progress the economy has made and identifies the areas where more work is needed. Chapter 2 reviews the macroeconomic performance of the U.S. economy during 2014, including the growth of output and employment, the continued decline in the unemployment rate, the housing market, the growth of wealth over the year, and the improvement in the deficit as a fraction of GDP. The chapter also explains the economic assumptions about future growth that underlie the President’s Fiscal Year 2016 Budget, includ‑ ing the economic benefits of the President’s agenda. Chapter 3 reviews the opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. labor market. Perhaps no recent economic development has been more sur‑ prising than the rapid fall in the unemployment rate, spurred by the pickup in the rate of job growth in 2014. But economic performance must be gauged by more than just the unemployment rate—a successful job market also encourages labor force participation, supports quality jobs, and facilitates effective job matching of workers and positions. The American workforce and family lives have changed drastically over the last half-century. Women now represent almost one-half the workforce, married couples increasingly share child-care responsibilities, and people live—and work—longer than in the past. Chapter 4 examines these recent changes in American family life and their implications for labor markets. It also as analyzes Americans’ access to paid leave and workplace flexibility policies and the economic evidence on how these policies can benefit workers, firms, and our economy. Both Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 address two factors affecting middle-class incomes: labor force participation and the income distribution. Chapter 5 shifts the focus to productivity growth with an examination of business tax reform as well as a briefer discussion about the complemen‑ tary issues in individual taxation. The chapter summarizes the international context for business tax reform, describes the President’s approach to reform, and documents four channels through which reform can boost pro‑ ductivity and living standards: encouraging domestic investment, improving the quality of investment, reducing the inefficiencies of the international tax system, and investing in infrastructure. Middle-Class Economics: The Role of Productivity, Inequality, and Participation | 39 Chapter 6 reviews the profound transformation of the U.S. energy sector. The United States is producing more oil and natural gas, generating more electricity from renewables such as wind and solar, and consuming less petroleum while consuming the same amount of electricity. To build on this progress, to foster economic growth, and to ensure that growth is sustainable for future generations, the President has set out an aggressive allof-the-above clean energy strategy. This chapter lays out the key elements of the strategy: enhancing energy security and laying the foundation for a lowcarbon future in ways that also support economic growth and job creation. Finally, Chapter 7 situates the United States in the context of the global economy. The United States is more integrated with the rest of the world than ever before. This chapter examines the impact on the economy of increased global interdependence, through both international trade in goods and services and financial transactions in international capital markets. It presents empirical evidence on the economic effects and benefits to the middle class of enhanced U.S. trade, highlighting the United States’ central position to take advantage of the growth in world trade in services. These issues are important for understanding both productivity growth and the distributional implications of globalization. Conclusion The 2015 Economic Report of the President considers the recovery and our economic future from the perspective of the typical American fam‑ ily. Although workers have begun to reap the benefits of our accelerating recovery, a skewed income distribution and subdued labor force participa‑ tion have restrained the full benefit of U.S. growth from accruing to the middle class. As the economy continues to grow, President Obama’s focus on middle-class economics is designed to foster productivity growth in a shared and sustainable way, so that the typical family participates fully in the Nation’s resurgence. These are the values that should drive American economic policy in this next age for the middle class, and they are the values that animate this Report. 40 | Chapter 1 C H A P T E R 2 THE YEAR IN REVIEW AND THE YEARS AHEAD T he U.S. economy took another major step forward in 2014 as it continued to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Real gross domestic product (GDP) has grown at a solid 2.8-percent annual pace over the past two years, a pickup from the 2.0-per‑ cent pace seen during the 12 quarters of 2010 through 2012. The labor market firmed markedly during 2014, as reflected in the fastest pace of job gains since 1999 and nearly the fastest decline in the unemployment rate since 1983. Cumulatively, the private sector added 11.5 million jobs during 59 consecutive months (through December 2014) of positive job growth, the nation’s longest streak of uninterrupted private-sector job growth on record. The unemployment rate declined 1.1 percentage points during the 12 months of 2014, or almost an average of 0.1 percentage point a month, falling to 5.6 percent by year end (see Figure 2-1). Real average hourly earn‑ ings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose 1.5 percent over the 12 months of the year, as nominal wage growth continued to run somewhat ahead of the subdued pace of consumer price inflation. While substantial progress has been made, the economic recovery remains incomplete, and more work remains to support growth, boost job creation, and lift wages. The strengthening of the labor market occurred while real GDP grew 2.5 percent during the four quarters of 2014. The quarterly pace of economic growth was uneven as unusually cold and snowy weather contributed to a first-quarter drop in real GDP (at a 2.1-percent annual rate). The economy rebounded in the second and third quarters at a nearly 5.0-percent annual rate, followed by a slowing to 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter (advance estimate). Growth in consumer spending, business fixed investment, and exports sustained average aggregate demand growth during the four quarters of 2014, albeit with substantial quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Inventory investment proved uneven. The State and local sector bottomed out in 2012 41 Figure 2-1 Unemployment Rate, 1975–2014 Percent 11 10 9 8 7 6 Dec-2014 5 4 3 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 Note: Shading denotes recession.

Although slow growth among our international trading partners limited the growth of foreign demand, U.S. exports still grew 2 percent during the four quarters of the year. Manufacturing production also grew 4.5 percent during the four quarters as annual motor vehicle assemblies reached 11.7 million units in 2014, their highest level since 2005. The price of imported petroleum, as measured by the spot price of European light crude oil from the North Sea (known as Brent), averaged $108 per barrel during the first eight months of the year but fell to $63 per barrel for the month of December. The price decline reflected both increased global supply, including U.S. production, and weak world consumption, and it lowered the Nation’s net petroleum bill by roughly $70 billion at an annual rate and dampened headline inflation in the final months of the year. Although fiscal restraint continued in fiscal year (FY) 2014 with the Federal Budget deficit falling 1.3 percentage points to 2.8 percent of GDP, the restraint was less severe than during the two preceding years and mostly reflected the effects of automatic stabilizers rather than changes in the structural deficit. The cumulative five-year (2009 to 2014) decline in the deficit-to-GDP ratio was the steepest five-year drop since the demobilization following WWII. Following the October 2013 government shutdown, the two-year Ryan-Murray budget agreement (in December 2013) helped pro‑ vide fiscal-policy stability during FY 2014 and FY 2015. The Consolidated 42 | Chapter 2 and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, signed into law in December 2014, will help to extend this more stable fiscal environment into 2015. By the fourth quarter of 2014, consumer sentiment, as measured by both the Reuters/University of Michigan index and the Conference Board index, reached its highest levels since 2007, which likely reflects the additional fiscal certainty, improving income and employment expectations, and declining gasoline prices. Key Events of 2014 Aggregate Output Growth during the Year Growth during the year was volatile partly due to exceptionally severe weather in the first quarter and a puzzling first-quarter decline in reported health-care spending, followed by a surge in growth as the level of real out‑ put rebounded in subsequent quarters. Cold weather played a major role in depressing GDP in the first quarter; in fact, it was the third most unusually cold quarter in the past 60 years. Four snowstorms in the first quarter were severe enough to be rated on the Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale, an index produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that aims to capture the economic impact of snowstorms on populations. Prior to 2014, no quarter going back to 1956 had more than three such storms. The bad weather appears to have reduced many of the weather-sensitive components of GDP. Outright real spending declines occurred in inventory investment, equipment investment, residential investment (mostly reflecting a drop in real estate commissions), exports (especially to Canada), and State and local government spending (mostly through construction spending). Also, real consumer spending on goods registered below-trend growth. Weakness in these categories was only partially offset by higher consumer spending on services, which rose owing to a weather-related increase in electric and natural gas utility outlays. Growth rebounded to 4.6- and 5.0-percent annual rates in the second and third quarters followed by a 2.6-percent rate in the fourth quarter. Over the four quarters of the year, real GDP grew 2.5 percent. Figure 2-2 shows the growth rate of real output, as represented by the average of the incomeside and product-side measures.1 Measured in this way, real output grew 2.5 percent during the first three quarters of 2014, up slightly from 2.3 percent 1 Real output can be measured as the sum of the product-side components (known as gross domestic product, GDP) or by the sum of the income-side components (known as gross domestic income, GDI). In principle, these two quantities are the same, but these two measures will differ due to measurement error. Figure 2-2 plots both measures and their average.

Relative to this 2.5-percent pace, growth was fast in durable goods consumption and business fixed investment while growth was slow (but still positive) in consumer spending on nondurables and services, exports, Federal nondefense purchases, and State and local spending. Residential investment grew at about the same pace as overall GDP. Inventory investment (both farm and nonfarm) contributed a bit to GDP growth during 2014, and it played an important role in the quarterto-quarter fluctuations. An aggregate of consumption and fixed investment, known as private domestic final purchases (PDFP), is an especially predic‑ tive indicator of future real GDP growth. Real PDFP grew 3.2 percent dur‑ ing the four quarters of 2014 (see Box 2-1). Fiscal Policy Federal fiscal policy was less restrictive during FY 2014—which ended on September 30, 2014—than a year earlier. It was also more predictable, since Congress had agreed in December 2013 on discretionary spending caps for the remainder of FY 2014 and all of FY 2015; and on appropria‑ tions bills for FY 2014 and FY 2015, enacted in January and December 2014, respectively. The agreement to end the 16-day October 2013 shutdown (the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2014), together with subsequent 44 | Chapter 2 Box 2-1: Private Domestic Final Purchases as a Predictive Indicator of GDP Real GDP, like many indicators, can be volatile from quarter-toquarter for purely transitory reasons related to fluctuations or measure‑ ment issues that provide little information about the underlying state of the economy. As discussed in the text, 2014 provides an example with a sharp contraction in GDP in the first quarter of 2014 and a sharp expansion in the second quarter, suggesting a fluctuation around an underlying economic trend. One reason why GDP is so volatile is that subcomponents can have large transitory fluctuations, for example, the volatile inventory investment component of GDP, which subtracted from the first quarter of 2014 and added to it in the second quarter.

Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts; CEA Calculations. Do other national income concepts provide a better gauge of the underlying trend in economic activity? One way to assess this is to deter‑ mine which factors provide the best prediction of one-quarter ahead real GDP growth, thereby capturing the more inertial component or compo‑ Sorted nents of GDP. Of the candidates, one might consider lags of overall real component value -0.01 GDP itself, Government or the lagged values of individual spending-side components Exports 0.01 of real GDP (consumer spending, fixed investment, Inventories 0.02 and government 0.22 measure of real spending). GDP One might also consider the income-side Final Sales of Dometic Product 0.23 GDP, known as gross domestic income (GDI), which Imports 0.28would be identical 0.29 to GDP butFixed forInvestment measurement error. The best predictor could be some Mean Output (GDP, GDI) 0.29 combination of these components.

On this scale, a perfect predictor would have an R2 of 1, and a variable with no correlation would have an R2 of 0. Among the possi‑ bilities shown in Table 2-i, consumer spending and fixed investment are good predictors of future GDP. The best-fitting predictor, however, is an aggregate of these two variables called private domestic final purchases (PDFP). This is likely attributable to the fact that PDFP excludes the volatile and possibly inaccurate measures of exports, imports, inventory investment, and government spending. It therefore equals the sum of consumption and fixed investment. As can be seen, PDFP predicts future GDP growth better than the lags of GDP itself, GDI, or a simple average of GDP and GDI. PDFP also predicts GDP better than final sales (GDP less inventory investment) and all the other components of GDP. Figure 2-i below illustrates that real PDFP growth is much more stable than real GDP growth. Although PDFP growth was low in the first quarter of 2014 (because weather affected consumption and fixed investment), it was not negative because PDFP excludes volatile com‑ ponents like inventory investment. PDFP then rebounded in the second and third quarters but not by as much as GDP. In the second, third, and fourth quarters, growth of PDFP was stable at 3.8, 4.1, and 3.9 percent, respectively. In contrast, real GDP growth was more volatile, surging to Figure 2-i PDFP versus GDP Growth, 2012–2014 Percent Change, Annual Rate 6 2014:Q4 5 3.9 4 3 Real PDFP Growth 2.2 2 1.8 1.6 2.1 3.4 2.5 2.7 2.7 2.3 4.6 3.8 3.5 4.1 2.8 3.9 2.6 1.8 1.0 1 0.1 0 Standard Deviation (2012:Q1-2014:Q4) GDP: 2.0 PDFP: 1.0 -1 -2 -3 Real GDP 4.5 4.2 Growth 5.0 2012:Q1 2012:Q3 2013:Q1 -2.1 2013:Q3 2014:Q1 2014:Q3 Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts of the United States; CEA calculations. 46 | Chapter 2 5.0 percent in the third quarter boosted by defense and net exports, and then slowing to 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter when these components reversed direction. Overall, the growth rate of PDFP is more stable than GDP, allowing a reasonable quarter-by-quarter measure of the underly‑ ing growth rate of the economy. agreements reached in December 2013 and the following January, sus‑ pended the debt ceiling through March 2015, provided partial relief from the automatic sequestration of discretionary spending in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, and resulted in appropriations bills that funded the Federal Government through the end of FY 2014. In September, Congress passed a continuing resolution to fund the government through December 11, 2014. Finally, in mid-December, the 113th Congress passed and the President signed an appropriations bill that funded most of the Federal Government through the end of FY 2015. This legislation provided positive support to a number of key initiatives, including the extension of the FY 2014 funding gains for early childhood education, investment in manufacturing innova‑ tion hubs around the country, and provision of additional funding for key financial watchdogs like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission.2 In addition, Congress retroactively approved a variety of tax “extenders” that affected 2014 liabilities, including incentives for research and development and clean energy, and tax deduc‑ tions for teacher expenses. The five-year decline of 7.0 percentage points in the deficit-to-GDP ratio since FY 2009 has been the largest since the demobilization at the end of World War II. The Federal deficit-to-GDP ratio fell 1.3 percentage points to 2.8 percent in FY 2014. The year-to-year reduction in this ratio followed steeper declines of 1.7 and 2.7 percentage points in fiscal years 2012 and 2013, respectively (see Figure 2-3). The deficit-to-GDP ratio in FY 2009 was elevated by the steep recession as well as by fiscal measures deployed to combat that recession. Overall, fiscal support substantially raised the level of output and employment during and after 2009, as discussed in the 2014 Economic Report of the President (Chapter 3). But the reduction in the deficit has acted as a drag on growth rates, especially in 2013. One source of fiscal drag during 2012 and 2013 was the end of various countercyclical fiscal policies following the recession, the largest change being the expiration of the payroll tax cut at the end of 2012. The declining deficit in 2014 largely 2 http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/12/17/ omb-director-shaun-donovan-passage-hr-83-consolidated-and-further-continuing-appropr The Year in Review and the Years Ahead | 47 Percent of GDP 12 Figure 2-3 Federal Budget Deficit, 1950–2016 10 8 6 4 2 FY 2016 0 -2 -4 -6 -8 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 Fiscal Year 2000 2010 Note: Orange markers denote administration forecasts.

At its December 2013 meeting, the FOMC announced a decision to reduce the monthly increase in its holdings of long-term securities by $10 billion a month to $75 billion a month.
