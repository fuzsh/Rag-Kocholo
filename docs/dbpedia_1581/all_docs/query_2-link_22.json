        "text": "I enjoyed listening to Dana's Best Jump & Jam Tunes CD! I found myself tapping to the beat of many songs. One of the things I like about this CD is that so many of the songs are nursery rhymes. They have simple melodies, fun rhythms and positive, upbeat messages. Many of them are about animals and the importance of doing the right thing in life. The \"I Love Mommy\" song is very simple yet it is a reminder of the most important people in our lives - our family.\n\nThere are twelve songs on the CD. It's too difficult to pick a favorite, I love \"Barnyard Hoedown,\" \"Jumping Beans,\" \"Five Green and Speckled Frogs and \"I Love Mommy. The reason why I like \"Barnyard Hoedown\" so much is because it is a country song with animal voices, a kid's choir and ends with a cow mooing. The \"Jumping Beans\" is really cool because of its Spanish flavor and the inclusion of a xylophone. I also think \"Five Green and Speckled Frogs\" is funny because of the frogs croaking in it. Finally, the \"I Love Mommy\" is particularly touching lullaby with having a heartfelt simple message about loving your family.\n\nDana Cohenour sings all the songs on the CD is really great. Her voice is very pretty and she can make funny sounds with her voice like singing with different accents. She also does the fun musical arrangements.\n\nThe message of this CD is about the importance of respecting animals, doing the right thing and loving your family. What sticks out in mind the most is the kids' choir singing, the animal voices and Dana singing in different styles. I also like all the nursery rhymes.\n\nWhile I think kids of various ages will enjoy this, I recommend it to ages 3 to 7 because the songs are nursery rhymes with animal sounds. I give this 4 out of 5 musical stars for its positive upbeat songs and inclusion of animal and kid voices.\n\nBy Abigail Zoe L., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 9\n\nI love to sing dance and just be a child at heart so I love this CD. It is simply wonderful because it has songs for kids of all ages. It has songs that had me wanting to get up, dance, sing and have fun and I found myself doing just that. I love that Raffi sings songs that are fun and memorable and just plain silly!\n\nIncluded are 16 unique songs kids can dance, sing, learn and just have a good time along with Raffi. This would be great for parties or sleepovers and will pick you up if you are feeling blue. They are very kid-friendly and teach lessons such as everyone grows up, what the sun is and what it does best. On the flip side, there are songs that are funny and silly and will have you up out of your seat and whirling around your house.\n\nThe Wheels on the Bus and If You're Happy and You Know It are classics that have a few twists added which make them even cuter. My favorites are Baby Beluga and Love Bug. I love these two because they are very sweet and very clever and had me laughing and dancing. The Baby Beluga is about a baby beluga's day and what it did. Love Bug is about the love bug and how everyone has one and how it shares love and happiness throughout the world.\n\nThis CD really made me feel like I was 5 or 6 again and I loved it. It really lets you be carefree and silly and not have to worry about things that older kids have to worry about. For example, things that really bothers me is that I have to do school, worry about money, boys and report cards and what my parents think of me. When I listen to this music I let all that stress go and kicked back to relax and just have fun and go back to that time of my life when I had no worries, bills or strife. I think that it could really help kids deal with all kinds of things and bring them a bit of joy to their day.\n\nI recommend this for kids ages 2 to 12. Kids will love how Raffi sings songs that are fun and educational. They are easy to follow and invite the listeners to sing and dance along. I give this CD 5 out of 5 singing and dancing stars shooting across the sky.\n\nReviewed by Morgan B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 12\n\nThis CD is a mixture of new and old children's songs. Many of the old songs are favorites and the children got up and danced and sang along to them. Some of the newer or, not so familiar songs, are upbeat and exciting. The first half of the CD are fun, fast paced and kids loved them and danced along. Some of the slower paced ones did not hold my grandchildren's interest as much. An old favorite, \"The Wheels on the Bus\" was their favorite. Also a new version of De O, Daylight Come and Me Wanna Go Home is delightful. They know the words to this song and clapped their hands and danced along. They also were quite partial to \"Down By the Bay,\" \"Apples & Bananas,\" \"Ring, Ring Banana Phone,\" \"Let's Play\" and \"Shake the Sillies Out.\" My kids loved the faster paced songs."
