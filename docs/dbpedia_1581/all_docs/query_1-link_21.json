        "text": "When Undertale exploded onto the scene in 2015, it was inescapable. In middle school, people would still go crazy over games, sure, but it was usually a communal experience. In Minecraft, we built worlds together and sabotaged each other for no good reason. With Five Nights at Freddy’s, we’d gather around someone brave enough to play it for us, and try not to chicken out at the jumpscares. But with Undertale, there was more there than just the excuse to spend time with someone. It’s simplistic graphics and premise hid colorful characters and a depth of story that took multiple playthroughs to truly appreciate. It may have been groundbreaking for the time, but with no experience in RPGs (let alone good ones), it was life changing for me. I didn’t end up playing it myself till college, but I watched and rewatched gameplay videos, dug around on wikis and forums for every little secret or bit of dialogue to figure out every mystery the story invited. Put simply, I was obsessed.\n\nI could write a whole essay on Undertale and its quasi-sequel Deltarune, but that’s not what today’s entry is about. You see, though I hardly consider myself an expert, I am a big fan of music. Mainly disco and select classic rock nowadays, but as embarrassing as it is to admit, in middle through high school I listened extensively to video game OSTs. The work that goes into crafting the score to a game can often be overlooked and underappreciated, as it can’t just sound good — it has to fit the pace and mood of the scene it’s set to. As with all scoring, the right song in the wrong place can make or break a scene. Just look at Star Wars. Watch a scene, any scene without the accompanying music and watch how the awkward the pacing becomes. Honestly, George Lucas might be broke today without John Williams carrying his films.\n\nBut I digress. Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale, gained international recognition and indie-game superstar status after his game was released, and since then, his career has taken him far beyond his humble origins. He now meets and works with his heroes and inspirations, and has an army of fans that wait with bated breath on every release of his. I know this well, being one of them. But even though it’s the games he makes (and the gameplay and writing within) that have made him famous, the bulk of his work is as a composer. He’s got a knack for the piano and a tendency to add repeating leitmotifs to new songs, but outside of this, there’s a lot of variety in his work over the years. Today, I’d like to focus on perhaps his most popular song (and, if you were on the Internet circa 2015, you’re probably sick of): Megalovania.\n\nI will place this warning here to get it out of the way: I will try to keep spoilers to a minimum, as I recommend a lot of the media I am about to cover, but I will have to mention the context in which each theme plays. Some of these may be obvious spoilers you already know; others may not be. Regardless, spoilers inbound for The Halloween Hack, Homestuck, Earthbound, and Undertale.\n\nIf you know of Megalovania, most likely you know it as Sans’s theme, or the final boss theme from Undertale’s Genocide Route. It was catchy, complex, epic, and accompanied one of the most memorable (and difficult) moments in the game. Just as Sans became the game’s most popular character, so did his boss theme become the most popular song from the soundtrack. A search through YouTube nowadays will still yield hundreds of remixes, covers, animatics, etc. both old and new. I don’t think words can really do justice to Sans’s meteoric rise to fame. His role as that route’s final boss is meant to be a massive spoiler, but it’s probably one of the most well known things about him in the sphere of Internet cultural osmosis. I mean, I just looked up ‘sans undertale’ on Google Images, and some of the first results are fanart of his fight.\n\nYou also have to remember that this was the era of Vine, and so just as the game was getting popular, you’d get plenty of short memes that simplified a moment or character from the game into a punchline. The first ten notes of Megalovania (or in some cases, even the four notes) became recognizable enough that they could be inserted into a video with a still image of Sans and that was all you needed. That was comedy for you. It makes since with this song, specifically, given that it revolves around the continuous repetition of those first ten notes until the song breaks into electric guitars accompanied by chiptune piano and trumpets. As long as you knew the beginning, you could just hum or scat it on loop and you were already there.\n\nBut before it became the Internet’s darling meme song, it was a much simpler piece made for a ROM hack, 6 years before Undertale’s release. As a teenager, Toby Fox went under the moniker ‘Radiation’ and posted often on the Earthbound forum Starmen.net. For the uninitiated, Earthbound (or Mother 2 in Japan) is a 1994 role-playing game developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a massive cult following. It was the second in a series of three games, and yet for decades, it was the only game from its series to release in the US. It performed poorly commercially due to an awful marketing campaign and higher price, but among people that did give it a chance, they found something truly unique that a million nerds at their computers have been trying to replicate ever since — Toby Fox being one of them.\n\nSo what’s so unique about Earthbound? It’s your standard Japanese role playing game (JRPG for short) about a young boy named Ness charged by a time travelling alien with saving the universe from this ultimate embodiment of evil, Giygas. Where most entries in the genre at the time were in some magical medieval fantasy setting, Earthbound ditched the cloaks and swords for t-shirts and baseball bats. It was set in a modern (or at least, 80s-ish) world and featured psychic powers and aliens, making it more of a science-fiction story. But it was also known for its comedic designs, events, and dialogue, while still keeping a strong emotional throughline and an infamously horrific final boss sequence. When you hear about ‘scary moments in innocent games’, 9 times out of 10 they’re about to tell you about the fight with Giygas.\n\nIn the 2000s and onward, we’ve seen a lot of games trying to recapture Earthbound’s lightning in a bottle, with a steady flow of RPGs with modern settings and plenty of comedy. Even if the game isn’t an RPG, you still see Earthbound’s DNA across the indie landscape — LISA The Painful, Omori, Cave Story, Night in the Woods, Celeste, and of course, Undertale. But the most dedicated Earthbound fans in the 2000s flocked together to something more than a game — they made a community: Starmen.net. A forum on which people talked about their playthroughs, theories, fan fiction, and fan games. It was here a young Toby Fox cut his teeth by managing the ‘PK Hack’ forum dedicated to ROM hacks (a game made by editing the original game with new aspects) of Earthbound. In 2008, he submitted his own hack to the Starmen.net Halloween Funfest — “Press the B Button, Stupid!” otherwise known as “The Halloween Hack.”\n\nThis hack, though Toby Fox admits shame for it now, saw extensive changes to the original game, following a new lead character in a new story taking place months after the defeat of Giygas. You play as Varik, a character from the Brandish series, who must journey to Winters and stop the source of the monsters that have destroyed the land and threaten to spill over elsewhere. That is the story, at least, for the first 20–30 minutes. You quickly find the suspect — the absentminded Dr. Andonuts from the original game — and can choose to kill him or, as the hack’s name suggests, press the B button to refuse, causing you to enter his mind and go on a journey through his subconscious. You learn a lot about the man who became a monster, and finally journey to the center of his mind where you end up killing him anyway. But the soundtrack is pretty neat! It’s a lot of reused tracks from Earthbound, but a good amount of new ones composed by Fox himself, including the original version of Megalovania. No small feat, considering the difficulty of adding music into a pre-existing ROM, as well as the accessibility of music editing software in 2008 for a 17 year old.\n\nThe Halloween Hack’s version of Megalovania is also a final boss theme for Andonuts, and is much simpler here. It retains the ten notes (which really do make the song, no matter what you do to it) and has a bassier chiptune piano that comes in alongside the repeating opening, but lacks a lot of the extra bits Undertale’s version features after the fact. Originally, Fox wanted to include the song ‘Megalomania’ from Live a Live as the final boss theme, but never got to it. As a homage, though, he named his own track after it, adding -vania to go with the Halloween theme. The song bears a resemblance both to its namesake as well as ‘Gadobadorrer’ from Brandish 2: The Planet Buster (Varik’s native game). The latter even features a primitive version of that ten-note opening that Megalovania is so famous for. I also think ‘Techno Boss Battle’ from this first soundtrack is worth mentioning, but let’s move on.\n\nNow’s the part of the article that I’m sure may make many, including close friends of mine, groan and close the tab: Homestuck. Also a story with a lot of DNA drawn from Earthbound, Homestuck is a webcomic created by Andrew Hussie, and the fourth story created for the website “MS Paint Adventures”. It was unique for its multimedia format that featured panels, long sequences of text, gifs, videos, flash games, and even ARG elements later on. The videos and games included in the comic were backed by an original soundtrack created by a team of musicians, one of whom was Toby Fox. There’s a lot more to Homestuck and its history that I won’t get into here, but may do so in a later article. For now, we’ll focus on Fox’s contributions, though there are several prominent composers that went on to do impressive projects of their own.\n\nAs Hussie worked on the comic, and planned flash animations to accompany the story, they put out a call for musicians and composers to help make music for them, and the Homestuck Music Team formed in 2009, growing in size and scope as the comic progressed. There were nine primary members, but in total there were around 120 total artists credited to the music team alone. Toby Fox became the leader of the music team, producing and co-producing over a hundred songs on the 30+ albums the team released (not even going into the unused songs, demos, alternate versions in the Sound Test). Allegedly, during all this, Toby Fox even moved in with Hussie and lived in their basement over the next few years. Something that began to emerge here was Toby Fox’s fondness for leitmotifs (something the rest of the team also picked up as well).\n\nA leitmotif is a sequence of notes that, in fiction, is typically assigned to a certain character, setting, or story. It may appear in different compositions as a reprisal or musical reference, and oftentimes in score can indicate the presence or reference to the subject of the leitmotif. For example, going back to Star Wars, take the Imperial March, or Darth Vader’s theme. Many people are familiar with that ‘dun dun dun, dun dun dun’ sound, so much that you can hum it and understand what it is in reference to. Even though there was a specific score where the Imperial March first appeared, that sequence of notes and instruments reappearing in other songs are used to accompany appearances of Vader or the Empire — and that’s a leitmotif.\n\nCharacters would often have leitmotifs in the Homestuck soundtrack that would reappear in other music, even if the song was not directly focused around them. For those familiar, the character Dave Strider is associated with the first twelve notes or so of the song ‘Beatdown’. Further versions of ‘Beatdown’ appear in the comic and soundtrack as remixes, and sometimes those notes will feature in a song at a moment when Dave appears in the corresponding flash animation, or in songs about characters related to Dave. Of note is the leitmotif of Toby Fox’s song ‘Penumbra Phantasm’: it appeared in 16 songs (both Toby’s and others’), and yet the original song was never released!\n\nThe Homestuck version of Megalovania (stylized MeGaLoVania) was used in the flash animation “Wake”, and prominently features the characters Aradia and Vriska, the former fighting with Jack Noir while the latter fights with Tavros. The most notable thing about this version is the heavy, heavy use of overdrive guitar (provided by Joren “Tensei” de Bruin), and the addition of a secondary leitmotif towards the end of the song (“Spider’s Claw” from the album Alternia, also by Fox). Guitar strums lead in the song, followed by the original instrumentation from the hack (cleaned up a bit), before guitar takes the lead with a more upbeat chiptune piano and new sections that would carry over to Undertale. The ‘Spider’s Claw’ section near the end plays during Vriska’s confrontation, due it to being Vriska’s leitmotif.\n\nQuitting his work as moderator of ‘PK Hack’ in 2011, Fox would continue working on the music team for a while in the early 2010’s, but had aspirations to tell his own story. As early as 2012, he had started planning Deltarune (his current project), but 2012 also saw the announcement of the Homestuck Adventure Game (later named Hiveswap). Naturally, Fox wanted to assist with the Adventure Game, but also wanted to gain some experience making games so he could provide input and make Deltarune down the line. So, in 2012, he began development on Undertale, and announced a KickStarter campaign a year later.\n\nToby admitted that he had little idea of how to actually make a game, so he focused on developing the game system by system. Starting with the text system, he moved onto the battle system, which informed a lot of the game’s plot and structure. He was particularly inspired by Touhou Project, being a fan of ZUN and his music, and so subverted typical RPG mechanics by featuring a bullet hell system (in which the character must move around on screen to dodge projectiles). He tried to keep development restricted to as few people as possible, though enlisted artist Temmie Chang to bring life to a lot of the game’s sprites. The soundtrack, one of the elements critics have praised most about the game, was inspired by Touhou Project as well, though also drew elements from his Earthbound beginnings and Homestuck Music Team career. Similar to the method by which Hussie scripted flash animations, the music came first, and the scene was paced around it.\n\nBefore we dive back into Undertale, there’s a few fun tidbits I’d like to mention. There were actual several versions of Megalovania created for Homestuck in total, mostly slight derivations on the original or the ‘Wake’ version that featured in the Sound Test. Fox worked on a tribute album called “I Miss You — Earthbound 2012” that featured tracks inspired by the game contributed by a group of musicians. One of the tracks he made was ‘Fallen Down’ — later reused in Undertale, while he made a song titled ‘Megalo Strike Back’ that has entirely different leitmotifs, but similar instrumentation to both Megalovania and ‘Pokey Means Business’ from Earthbound. There was also the fan game ‘Mother: Cognitive Dissonance’ that had an updated rerelease in 2014 which featured an original version of Megalovania (a remix based on the original Halloween Hack version). The game’s development was unrelated to Fox, but he expressed approval for the remix. This version, though unofficial, is often included with compilations of Megalovania’s history, and is notable for being a major remix created before Undertale’s release.\n\nFinally, we’re back where we started. Undertale releases, becomes extremely popular, and the fight with Sans and accompanying theme achieves Internet immortality. This version of the theme is a complete redo rather than a simple remix like Homestuck’s version. There are several tracks of instrumentals featured, such as a more subdued guitar, swirling electronic strings, an echo of the ten-note pattern with more bass, drum beats, and several more sections in addition to Homestuck’s contributions. Outside of Megalovania, though, the entire soundtrack is lush with everything from silly chiptune to sweeping piano pieces to more hard-rock inspired boss themes. Character and location leitmotifs also return from his earlier days, giving rise to jokes that Undertale’s soundtrack is ‘the same three songs repeated’.\n\nAfter Undertale made him more of a household name, Toby Fox started to shy away from public appearances, primarily due to how batshit crazy his fandom became. Nevertheless, the critical acclaim it received led to numerous honors and opportunities for the young composer, from being on Forbes’ “30 under 30” list in 2018 to meetings with Shigesato Itoi (the creator of Earthbound) and collaborations with Masahiro Sakurai (the creator of Super Smash Bros.), ZUN, and Itoki Hana, among others. After returning to the Homestuck Music Team temporarily to assist with the final few flashes, he collaborated with James Roach on the soundtrack for Hiveswap Act 1. His contributions and commissions are numerous and scattered across several games in the late 2010’s — early 2020’s, indie or otherwise. Dweller’s Empty Path, Omori, Escaped Chasm, PRAY, Little Town Hero, and even Pokemon: Sword and Shield featured Toby Fox’s work in some capacity.\n\nThe first chapter of Deltarune released finally in 2018, with the second chapter in 2021, and more on the way. It shows a refinement upon the formula of Undertale, with a larger team, more complex artwork, a longer and more linear story, improved party-based RPG mechanics, and at least in my opinion, better music. The Undertale soundtrack and all prior work was impressive, but Deltarune shows more of a mastery in terms of the layering and amount of instrumentation put into each track. Just listen to stuff like ‘Rude Buster’ or ‘BIG SHOT’ and hear what a marked difference there is from ‘Enemy Approaching’ and ‘Speak of Justice’. I won’t pass judgement on Deltarune just yet, as only a quarter of the game is out thus far, and it will evolve as future chapters come out.\n\nAccompanying this newfound wave of success was the earth-shattering reveal that Sans would be given entry into the newest entry into the Super Smash Bros. series, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Granted, it was just as a purchasable Mii costume, but the fan reaction was still completely hysterical. Hell, I bet someone that Sans would never get into Smash, and had to film myself eating literal dirt when this all happened. And dirt doesn’t taste good! You also have to understand that in addition to the latent hype that Sans and Undertale had among the gaming community, it was considered a high honor for a character to be added to Smash Bros. Most people wanted their favorite character to get added as a full time fighter, with a Mii costume being somewhat of a let down, but for smaller, indie titles like Undertale, being recognized at all was one hell of a feat. Sans’s inclusion cemented Undertale as something so popular that even Nintendo knew it. And alongside the costume was the added bonus of a certain song added to the game, that you could set to play on certain stages. Megalovania.\n\nFrom a song in a Nintendo ROM hack to a song in an actual Nintendo game, in only 11 years. Isn’t that crazy? It’s crazy to me, at least. I mean, this guy was a teenager posting on forums about Earthbound and composing in his room, and now his music has whole symphony orchestras doing tribute concerts and a circus playing it for the Pope. I’m not even kidding about that last part. The Pope has heard Megalovania. What a world. But I digress.\n\nThe current most recent version of Megalovania is largely a remix of Undertale’s version in the same way that Homestuck’s version was a remix of the Halloween Hack’s. It starts off with the previous version’s ten note intro, before continuing with higher pitched versions of the accelerated chiptune ten-note sequence. The drums are more pronounced, and the overdrive guitar even sings louder in the background. It’s a more subtle change than in previous versions, but you can hear the instruments performing with more intensity. I even think I hear faint piano in the background. But as you get into the latter half of the song, everything switches up. It breaks down at first into a piano piece with an almost marching-band drum sound to back it up, with strings and what sounds like the original Halloween Hack instrumental faded coming in to join. The strings then stand alone for a moment, before the usual repetition rushes back in and an overdrive guitar goes absolutely ham. Then at the very end, we hear two additional leitmotifs from Undertale: ‘Heartache’ (Toriel’s theme) and ‘Bonetrousle’ (Papyrus’s theme). Toriel and Sans are very close and Papyrus is his brother, so here you see Toby’s usual playing with leitmotifs return on his grandest stage yet.\n\nNow, this is just my own guess, but the Halloween Hack-sounding instrumental and overdrive guitar in the latter half almost seem like a love letter to the song’s history (its previous two versions). I’ll likely never get the chance to talk to Toby and ask him, but you can be sure I’ve sent emails and comments before asking about it. After all, the song’s inclusion in Smash really represents Toby Fox’s whole musical journey, as it’s followed him every step of the way. From learning to make music and making simple projects as an Earthbound fan, to making connections and gaining practice through the Homestuck Music Team, to making his very own video game and skyrocketing into the stratosphere, to where he is now and beyond. It’s a fun journey to follow, personally speaking, and I’m excited to see where he and his music go next. And if anyone reading this is in contact with Mr. Fox — or if you are Mr. Fox — maybe consider putting me in touch with him? I’m not a rabid, obsessed fan, I promise."
