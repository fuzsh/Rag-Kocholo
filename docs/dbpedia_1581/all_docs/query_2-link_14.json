        "text": "Artist: My Morning Jacket\n\nAlbum: The Waterfall II\n\nYear: 2020\n\nGrade: C+\n\nIn Brief: I’m more inclined to call this album a series of deleted scenes from 2015’s The Waterfall than a true sequel to it. While I’m glad that the material finally saw the light of day, and there are a few potential classics to be unearthed here, most of the material is overly slow and ponderous, and it doesn’t hang together well as a continuous listening experience. MMJ is capable of doing mellow mood-setters quite well, but usually it’s because they remember to slowly ramp up the guitar pyrotechnics, and lean on their vintage psychedelic rock and R&B influences. A number of these songs seem quite stark due to those elements being scaled back, which makes The Waterfall II their most tepid and tedious listening experience since the band’s early days.\n\nThis may be an unpopular opinion among My Morning Jacket fans, but I’m just gonna say it anyway: The Waterfall is MMJ’s best album. Perhaps I’m just a different type of listener than the ones the band attracted in their early days, when they were renowned for their extended live jams and for making records that had plenty of space for Jim James and co. to show off their instrumental skills while playing the “how slow can you go” game. I’ve always been intrigued by the Kentucky band’s blend of vintage country, R&B, blues and 70s pop sounds – they’re a tough band to classify due to how they jump around from one track to the next. The problem is that it became an Achilles heel when listening to most of their records – at last for someone like me who expects there to be some sense of momentum and continuity throughout an album. Maybe I’m just not a chill enough guy to really get the vibe these guys were going for back in the day. But I thought they consolidated their influences quite well on The Waterfall – a relatively more upbeat record that had its fair share of strong guitar solos and passionate performances on both the rockers and the ballads. They did it convincingly enough that I didn’t mind most of the lyrics basically being ruminations on metaphysical mumbo-jumbo. That record was a huge bright spot in my summer of 2015, and it still holds up well today. So of course, when MMJ finally announced the release of its companion record, The Waterfall II, in the summer of 2020, my immediate response was, “Yes, please!”\n\nNow of course, we knew this record existed since the moment The Waterfall dropped. The band was pretty excited about the prolific sessions that led to two album’s worth of material being recorded, and at the time, they hinted that the companion album’s release was just around the corner. Then years went by, and we heard next to nothing from the band. A few songs from these sessions surfaced in the form of soundtrack contributions or standalone singles – one of them had even been kicking around in the band’s live sets as far back as 2011. Jim James seemed preoccupied with his own solo career, making me a bit concerned for the band’s future when he put out back-to-back records without any indication that he had returned to the band in between. Honestly, it seemed like the band had lost faith in the material, and too much time had passed for them to salvage enough of it or splice it together with new material to make a record they’d be completely satisfied with. And then 2020 happened, and everything changed. Unable to tour, or to feasibly work on new music in the studio together due to social distancing effectively bringing the music industry to a screeching halt, the band understandably changed their perspective concerning those lost tracks. The story goes that Jim James heard the album’s opening track “Spinning My Wheels” on shuffle on his digital music player, realized all over again what a good track it was, and felt some regret that the rest of the world hadn’t been able to hear it yet, which kicked off the discussion about finally releasing the album. I don’t doubt that, but I also can’t blame the band for saying “Well shoot, we’ve had nothing new out in 5 years and we’ve got to make money somehow”, and just deciding to put out whatever they had in the vaults. I’d have been fine with this in 2015 or 16, so there’s no reason I should object to it now.\n\nThe thing is… this isn’t that good of a sequel. I’ve come to expect a slight drop in quality whenever a band puts out Part II of a record years after the fact, particularly when the track selection for Part I was made before they were sure they were going to release two albums. If the intent with The Waterfall was to make a record that was a little more nimble on its feet and less ballad-heavy, then it’s understandable that they kept the slower songs on that record to a minimum – a decision which I think helped the ballads “Get the Point” and “Only Memory Remains” to really stand out, when ordinarily those are tracks I might have been tempted to skip. But if the band’s usual habit it to record a bunch of slow stuff, then well… guess what’s left over? A lot of slow stuff that would have torpedoed the flow of The Waterfall. I’m not saying by any stretch of the imagination that MMJ is only a good band when they play at a loud volume or a fast tempo. A few of the slower and longer songs here are actually quite beautiful, and I wouldn’t have minded a little extra space being made for them on the original album. But with seven out of ten tracks going for more of a chill, ambient approach, with only a few of them showing any real instrumental flair, not only does it get tedious to listen to the entire thing in a row, it makes the few more up-tempo tracks rather jarring by comparison. The group’ more free-wheeling and psychedelic tendencies come out on the remaining three tracks, much like how they did on The Waterfall‘s title track, “Spring (Among the Living)”, and “Tropics (Erase Traces)”. I wouldn’t say any of those are immediate favorites, but they’re all welcome breaks from an otherwise mostly monotonous listening experience. There’s only so much of Jim James’ soothing falsetto crooning and light, fluffy keyboards or rote acoustic guitar chords that I can take before I start wanting to hear something with a little more meat on its bones. The contrast between most of these tracks and most of the original album is stark enough that they honestly could have given this record a different title, and I’d have had no clue that all twenty songs were recorded during the same sessions. It just doesn’t have the same spirit to it – which is perhaps the most damning criticism I can give for a sequel to a record that made its mark by practically oozing spirituality.\n\nAnd here’s where I know I’m breaking with popular opinion once again, because damn, this thing seems to be getting its fair share of critical acclaim, with several reviewers even going so far as to say it outshines the original Waterfall. This is nuts to me, but perhaps it speaks to the wildly different expectations that fans have of MMJ depending on when they got on board with the ban. My entry point was 2008’s Evil Urges – by no means a perfect record, but one that often bedazzled me with its experimentation and its sensitivity. Having gone back in time to he band’s earlier works, I can also see why 2005’s Z got a lot of acclaim – parts of it are sparse and beguiling just as their earliest records are, but there’s some genuine kick-ass guitar work on that record. I guess you had to have been around since the Tennessee Fire / At Dawn era to really consider The Waterfall II a welcome return to form for MMJ. Personally, while I’m glad that a few new gems got to see the light of day, I now find myself wishing that the band had instead saved these tracks for future albums, reworking them slightly and parceling out a few of them at a time as they discovered that they fit the mood of whatever they decided to work on in 2021 and beyond. When the normal cycle of recording and touring will even resume for the band is of course anyone’s guess, and honestly at this point it’s hard to even gauge Jim James’ enthusiasm level for recording with them again. But I sure hope this isn’t the last LP we ever get from the band. It would be such a whimper of a note for them to go out on.\n\nINDIVIDUAL TRACKS:\n\n1. Spinning My Wheels\n\nMy initial response to the slow pace and the lullaby-esque keyboard melody of this song is “OK, benefit of the doubt”. Removed from my disappointment with most of the rest of this record, I actually can see a solid reason for this track to be slow, contemplative and dreamy, because man, Jim James must have been incredibly burned out when he wrote this. Don’t let the sleepy drums tapping out the beat at a glacial pace and the barely-there drums fool you – this song captured an existential crisis in the making. Songs about being weary after so many years on the road are quite common for bands like this, especially when live shows are how they connect best with their audience. Songs that basically find the singer admitting he’s been doing the same thing for so long that he feels almost no joy in it and he’s definitely taking a break are something else entirely. This might explain why MMJ hasn’t been terribly active as a band since The Waterfall came out, at least not in terms of making new music together. The lyrics are heartfelt, and I really do feel some pain for the guy as he opens the album with this doozy of an admission: “I’ve been wrong for so long/Risking my life for the sake of the song/Stayed committed to the holy ghost/Even though the devil is who I needed most.” This is where I have to wonder how much distance there really was between the writing of The Waterfall and its sequel – the lyrics to “Compound Fracture” found James proclaiming that “God and the Devil were made up anyway”, and now he’s singing as though they are real and he simply picked the wrong side. If those two songs were originally planned to be part of the same narrative arc, then wow, that’s a pretty serous shift in a man’s outlook on the universe that the band was trying to capture there. While picking apart the lyrics to this one is quite fascinating, I do feel like it needs some sort of pathos to really make it stick – I get that it’s meant to be a breather and for that reason it needs to stand out from MMJ’s usual material, but even a slow but passionate guitar solo, or some sort of hint at a climax near the end would have been nice.\n\nGrade: B-\n\n2. Still Thinkin’\n\nNormally when an album starts off slow from a band you’d expect to give you a more energetic opening track, it’s natural to figure that the second track will start to get things ramped up. Of course, when you’ve got ten leftover tracks that didn’t quite fit your vision for another album and you throw them altogether, you can’t really plan things as well pacing-wise, so you end up with a track like this that does little more than tread water. There are a few moments where I feel like this one’s really trying to bring back some of the flavors of MMJ that we knew and loved from previous records. I hear hints of slide guitar, but the arrangement isn’t overly country-influenced. Horns blurt in fits and starts, but don’t do nearly enough to put a soulful stamp on the song. The rhythm is syncopated and it feels like it wants to be more playful, as if the band had just listened to “Happy Together” by The Turtles and wanted to emulate that sort of a mood, but they got the tempo all wrong and didn’t have an interesting enough chord progression to compensate. James’ sad sack lyrics about realizing he keeps on fooling himself by thinking he’s still got a chance with someone who has long since left him (or else they were never together in the first place) potentially could support a more whimsical musical approach – the kind that makes it clear he’s sort of poking fun at his own bad habits by writing it – if the band could just find a way to kick it up a notch. Unfortunately, the song can only muster up about as much flavor as a can of La Croix.\n\nGrade: C\n\n3. Climbing the Ladder\n\nAt last, some genuine signs of life! OK, so it’s an extremely dorky country riff that sounds like something straight out of the 70s, when country bands were still figuring out how much they wanted to rock and rock bands were still figuring out how country they wanted to be. But it’s totally on-brand for MMJ, so I’ll take it! The drums and bass have some real bounce to them here, James is finally singing as though he actually wants to be heard in the back row, and the lyrics… well, we’re still in the doldrums lyrically, but it seems to be a bit of a theme on this record that James wants to get away from his rockstar lifestyle and just enjoy some peace and quiet with someone he loves for a while, so I can’t fault him for being consistent about it. There’s even a surprisingly gritty guitar solo midway through the song that reminds us not every single sharp edge that this band once sported has been sanded off. Just about the only thing I don’t like here is how the tempo randomly slows down during the second verse, as if the song were suddenly climbing up a steep hill, only to pick up momentum again on its way down the other side. The Waterfall‘s title track pulled off the tempo changes a lot more convincingly. Still, this is song is the best thing that the sequel has going for it thus far.\n\nGrade: B\n\n4. Feel You\n\nScratch what I just said. This is the best thing the sequel has going for it, period. Actually, this is one of the best damn songs in the entire MMJ catalogue – the one song on this album that I’m genuinely annoyed didn’t make it onto the original. Strangely enough, it’s the longest song on the album, and it’s also a fairly mellow one. Mood-wise, it’s the most romantic and borderline sexy thing that the band has recorded since “Thank You, Too!” on Evil Urges – this one is similar, down to the strings that pretty much scream “70s throwback pop ballad!”, but the band gels incredibly well here and they give it more time to marinate. The piano chords immediately establish a chord progression that the song sticks to through its runtime – James is the master of throwing in all sorts of seventh chords to give a song an especially romantic or nostalgic feeling, and I’m thrilled to hear that talent on display here. The lead guitar line is downright delectable – I wouldn’t even really call it a solo since it repeats a few times, so I guess it’s more of an instrumental refrain, one that makes brilliant use of hammer-ons and pull-offs to give it more of a fluid sort of feel, accomplishing for the electric guitar what the original album’s standout track “Like a River” did for the acoustic. The chorus of “All I wanna do is feel you” could come across as corny – it might even be downright creepy in a more upbeat, aggressive song, or if the lyrics suggested that he was fantasizing about someone who was a stranger to him or who had rebuffed his advances. This one feels more like it’s coming from the perspective of a long-term, committed relationship in which the romance has dried up and been replaced with a lot of bickering, and his heart is just aching to get back to the moments of tenderness they once shared. And sure, some of that is sexual, making the desire to “feel you” a literal one, but I also think it has a double meaning, like how we say “I feel you” to empathize with someone who has shared about some sort of pain or difficulty they’re going through, and those sorts of conversations are important to a couple’s bond as well. I’ll be honest – this is easily one of the most repetitive songs on the album, and there’s even a point where I could poke fun at a clearly improvised-on-the-spot lyric: “Are we under covers, raining blood?/R.E.M. covers, Reign In Blood.” (OK, can’t say I’ve heard many love songs that reference both R.E.M. and Slayer before. That’s… different.) Yet I’ve got nothing but total adoration for this one. It just melts my heart, and I find myself wishing it didn’t have to end.\n\nGrade: A+\n\n5. Beautiful Love (Wasn’t Enough)\n\nI’ve dogged on this record a bit for not not having much of a flow, but I’ve got to say that the little piano flourish that opens this song makes for quite a nice segue out of “Feel You”, which makes me wonder if the two songs were always intended to go back-to-back. It unfortunately gives off a bit of a “Has-been crooner sits down at the piano during a cheesy Vegas show to tell you his life story” sort of vibe, but then the band takes it in a surprising direction with more of a sparse, stomping, staccato rhythm, playing against the expected velvety smoothness they were setting us up for. I wouldn’t say they’re playing the blues genre-wise here, but they might be doing so in spirit, with a side of bitter sarcasm. Thanking an ex for giving you “the gift of another’s love” is certainly a backhanded compliment – basically you’re saying that the relationship crashing and burning left an opening for you to meet someone else who you’re much happier with. James seems to genuinely grapple with his lingering anger towards his ex and his inability to forgive her in the chorus, which I guess fits with the overall theme of The Waterfall, which is learning to let go of the things you can’t control while putting a stop to the negative energy inside your own mind that you actually can do something about. In this case, it’s a lesson not yet learned, but at least he can admit he has a problem. There’s another distorted guitar solo in this song where I would have least expected it – it’s not particularly long or complex, but it fits the dejected, sneering tone of the song perfectly. My biggest complaint about this one is that it seems to end too early, right when the piano crescendo coming out of the second refrain sounds like it wants to lead into a bridge or a more definitive moral to the story. I’m not sure if they deliberately left it open-ended here, or if James just couldn’t figure out how to finish writing the song.\n\nGrade: C+\n\n6. Magic Bullet\n\nFinally we get to some “jammier” material in the second half of the record. This particular song seems to have been born out of a jam session that James figured made a good pairing with a lyric about wanting to be set free from the temptation to medicate his sorrows with a good stiff drink or a smoke – he seems to conclude that these things are only distraction when what he really needs to lift him out of the doldrums is a connection to his fellow human beings. The band’s funk influences are a little more prominent here, thanks to the horn section (which finally gets to let loose a little more), the fuzzy bass, and the stuttering rhythm. The guitar isn’t as central of an instrument to the backbone of this song, but once again there are a few fuzzy solos to be enjoyed. It’s not a total barn-burner, but I appreciate how it builds from something more skeletal at the beginning into a full band production where it sounds like everyone is genuinely having fun playing their instruments. At the end of the day, that’s really the #1 thing I expect to hear on a My Morning Jacket record.\n\nGrade: B\n\n7. Run It\n\nMy brain keeps telling me that this song is called “Get Back, Kotter”. I tend to associate My Morning Jacket with all things 70s, so naturally I just assumed the were somehow referencing the sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter. Turns out that the actual lyric, which James repeats many times, is “Can’t try much harder to get back to water/Gonna get back hotter, get back, get back to water.” What this means, I honestly couldn’t say, but the verses make it pretty clear that he’s got no time for unkind people, and if you bring that sort of negative energy to the party, he’s gonna run you right out the door. Musically, this is a pretty relaxed tune that has a bit of an “unplugged” vibe to it – the bass and electric guitar are obviously plugged in, but they take more of a subdued, bluesy approach, while the percussion is played by hand and arguably the most prominent instrument is a rather saloon-y piano. These would be good building blocks for a mellower jam session, but the melody never really breaks out of the basic and repetitive structure that it starts with, so the track never really gets a chance to build. Two minutes in, you pretty much know how the next two minutes and change are gonna go until it fades out.\n\nGrade: C\n\n8. Wasted\n\nNow this is what I’m talking about. This is a song that starts off with a great riff, but also takes its time to develop, and it gets to morph and change and give everyone in the band a solid part to play. This six-minute jam feels like it was purpose-built to be the highlight of a live show (unlike most of this record, which would probably put audiences to sleep). It leans more heavily on the band’s psychedelic and progressive sides, due to its slow but sludgy and heavy guitars in the intro and outro, and its funky midsection which bumps up the tempo a bit more as the keyboards, guitars, and horn section all get to take their turns ratcheting up the intensity. I’d have been fine with this as an instrumental jam, though the sing-along chorus in the first third is fun, too. Lyrically, this one’s a bit of a nothing burger – basically it’s just another rumination on the feeling James has that he’s been wasting his time chasing something illusory. I don’t really mind that, because the few lyrics we do get don’t spend a ton of time repeating, and the last four minutes or so of the song wisely let the instruments do all the talking. This would have worked just fine for me as an album closer – or at least, I can see that working on an album that wasn’t so short on up-tempo content that it would have wound up with like five ballads in a row leading up to this.\n\nGrade: B+\n\n9. Welcome Home\n\nThis track was originally debuted during an iTunes session in late 2011, which featured the band mostly performing holiday songs. You can tell from the lyrics about the leaves on trees changing colors and being glazed over with snow that it was meant to evoke the time of year when people visit friends and extended family that they might not get to see much during the rest of the year, and are (at least ideally) warmly welcomed despite whatever conflicts might have occurred between them in the past. I can’t fault the band for the laid-back, inviting mood of the song, but unfortunately it’s another in a long line of acoustic My Morning Jacket songs where pretty much every instrument that contributes is doing something so subtle that it feels like the band’s talents are being wasted. Sure, it’s vaguely pretty, and as a breather track between more up-tempo songs in the vein of “Get the Point” or “Wonderful (The Way I Feel)”, I guess I wouldn’t mind it. But it pretty clearly predates most of the songs that surround it – I know the sessions for The Waterfall date back to 2013, and they may well have re-recorded this track for the album before other, newer compositions pushed it onto the cutting room floor. But it definitely has that feeling of being that previously released track from a live session or compilation that bands sometimes awkwardly cram into a new album’s track listing when they’re short on content or when the label forces their hand.\n\nGrade: C-\n\n10. The First Time\n\nPutting this track back-to-back with “Welcome Home” is an absolute crime of pacing. Even though both are similarly slow, it’s awkward as hell when the soft conclusion of the previous track suddenly cuts into the vocal cold open that begins this one. It’s the last in a long line of signals that the band released this collection without thinking through how listenable it would be if played from end to end. This last track seems to be all warm, fuzzy feelings with very little to back it up on the performance side. Sure, I find James’ wistful falsetto to be inviting, and the gentle, shimmering guitars are similar in style to “Feel You”, just with a far less interesting part to play. The band spends the entire song softly ruminating on the same two chords, which doesn’t give them the chance to do much of anything captivating, and while the lyrics seem to find James at a moment of genuine peace, apparently having reconciled with his lover and finding some of those old feelings from when they first fell in love flooding back into his heart again. Nice sentiment, but this is ultimately a rather boring song that overstays its welcome at the end of an album that has already done so on a much larger scale.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nWHAT’S IT WORTH TO ME?\n\nSpinning My Wheels $.75\n\nStill Thinkin’ $.25\n\nClimbing the Ladder $1\n\nFeel You $2\n\nBeautiful Love (Wasn’t Enough) $.50\n\nMagic Bullet $1\n\nRun It $.25\n\nWasted $1.25\n\nWelcome Home $0\n\nThe First Time $.50\n\nTOTAL: $7.50\n\nBAND MEMBERS:\n\nJim James: Lead vocals, lead and rhythm guitars\n\nTom Blankenship: Bass\n\nPatrick Hallahan: Drums, percussion\n\nBo Koster: Keyboards, percussion, backing vocals\n\nCarl Broemel: Guitar, pedal steel, saxophone, backing vocals\n\nLISTEN FOR YOURSELF:"
