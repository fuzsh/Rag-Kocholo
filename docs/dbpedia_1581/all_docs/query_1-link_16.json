        "text": "1975 song by Fleetwood Mac\n\n\"Landslide\"Song by Fleetwood Macfrom the album Fleetwood Mac ReleasedJuly 1975 ( )Recorded1975GenreFolk rock[1]Length3:19LabelRepriseSongwriter(s)Stevie NicksProducer(s)\n\nFleetwood Mac\n\nKeith Olsen\n\nAudio sample\n\n\"Landslide\" is a song by the British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac, written and performed by Stevie Nicks. The song was first featured on the band's self-titled album Fleetwood Mac (1975). The original recording also appears on the compilation albums 25 Years – The Chain (1992), The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac (2002) and 50 Years – Don't Stop (2018), while a live version was released as a single 23 years later from the live reunion album The Dance (1997). \"Landslide\" reached No. 51 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 10 on the Adult Contemporary chart. \"Landslide\" was certified gold in October 2009 for sales of over 500,000 copies in the United States. According to Nielsen Soundscan, \"Landslide\" sold 2,093,186 copies in the United States as of 2017.[2]\n\nIn 2021, the song was listed at No. 163 on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\".[3]\n\nThe song is written and composed in the key of B-flat major and is set in a 2\n\n2 time signature (alla breve) with a tempo of 80 beats per minute.[4]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nNicks has said that she wrote the song while contemplating either going back to school or continuing on professionally with guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. Nicks wrote \"Landslide\" while she was financially supporting both herself and Buckingham by taking up jobs as both a waitress and a cleaning lady.[5] Following the release of their debut album Buckingham Nicks, they had been dropped from their recording contract by Polydor Records before they could release a follow-up. Nicks wrote the song while visiting Aspen, Colorado, sitting in someone's living room \"looking out at the Rocky Mountains pondering the avalanche of everything that had come crashing down on us ... at that moment, my life truly felt like a landslide in many ways.\"[6]\n\nThe song is one of Fleetwood Mac's most frequently performed during tours. Nicks has sung it on every Fleetwood Mac tour since joining the band, with the exception of the Shake the Cage tour, and has performed it on all of her own solo tours from 2005 onwards.[7] A live performance of \"Landslide\" recorded on 27 June 1980 at the London Wembley Arena was included on Live.[8]\n\nWhile \"Landslide\" was never issued as a single on its initial release in 1975, Fleetwood Mac did release a live version from Fleetwood Mac's 1997 album The Dance; it peaked at number 51 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the band's 24th entry on the chart. \"Landslide\" also reached the top 30 on both the US and Canadian adult contemporary charts. Other live recordings of \"Landslide\" also appear on Live in Boston (2004), Crystal Visions – The Very Best of Stevie Nicks (2007) (with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra), The Soundstage Sessions (2009), Soundstage, and the Live in Chicago DVD.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nIn a contemporary review, Rolling Stone wrote that Nicks seemed \"lost and out of place\" on \"Landslide\" and that her voice sounded \"callow and mannered\".[9] Retrospective reviews have been more positive, with certain publications such as The Guardian and Paste ranking \"Landslide\" amongst the band's best work.[10][11] AllMusic described \"Landslide\" as a traditional song \"built on a very simple (and very effective) country-folk-inspired chord progression\".[12]\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nStevie Nicks – vocals\n\nLindsey Buckingham – guitars\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales for \"Landslide\" Region Certification Certified units/sales Denmark (IFPI Danmark)[21] Gold 45,000‡ United Kingdom (BPI)[22] Platinum 600,000‡ United States (RIAA)[23] Gold 500,000 ^ / 2,093,186[2]\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nCover versions\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Landslide\"Song by the Smashing Pumpkinsfrom the album Pisces Iscariot Released4 October 1994 ( )Length3:10LabelVirginSongwriter(s)Stevie NicksProducer(s)Billy Corgan, Ted de BonoMusic video on YouTube\n\nAlternative rock band the Smashing Pumpkins recorded an acoustic arrangement of the song that was featured as the B-side to their 1994 single \"Disarm\" and later on their B-side collection Pisces Iscariot.\n\nThe group's arrangement went on to be one of the rock band's most-beloved tracks and even had the approval of Nicks herself. As she told fans during a 1998 online chat with SonicNet, \"There's nothing more pleasing to a songwriter than [someone else] doing one of their songs. ['Landslide'] also led me to being friends with Billy Corgan and the possibility that we'll work together,\" she said of the Smashing Pumpkins frontman. \"Over this song, there's been this incredible connection ... he reached out ... I believe that my poetry is really meant for everyone, no matter what age.\"\n\nThe new version was a hit, making it to the top three on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States that year and No. 30 on the US Airplay charts. The song was also featured on the US version of their greatest hits album Rotten Apples. It was later used in the TV show Alias on season 1 in the episode Page 47.\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nWeekly chart performance for \"Landslide\" Chart (1994) Peak\n\nposition Canada Top Singles (RPM)[24] 47 US Radio Songs (Billboard)[25] 30 US Alternative Airplay (Billboard)[26] 3\n\nDixie Chicks\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Landslide\"Single by Dixie Chicksfrom the album Home Released26 August 2002 ( )GenreCountryLength3:50Label\n\nOpen Wide\n\nMonument\n\nColumbia\n\nSongwriter(s)Stevie NicksProducer(s)\n\nDixie Chicks\n\nLloyd Maines\n\nDixie Chicks singles chronology\n\n\"Long Time Gone\"\n\n(2002) \"Landslide\"\n\n(2002) \"Travelin' Soldier\"\n\n(2002)\n\nMusic video on YouTube\n\nAmerican country music group the Dixie Chicks released a cover of \"Landslide\" on 26 August 2002 as the second single from their 2002 album, Home.

The band performed the song with Nicks at VH1 Divas Las Vegas in 2002.[citation needed] The music video for the song was directed by Jim Gable and edited by Scott C. Wilson.[citation needed]\n\nThis version, featuring the band's two- and three-part harmonies, reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.[27][28] On the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, it is the band's only number-one single.[29] After Maines publicly criticised President George W. Bush and the imminent Allied invasion of Iraq, triggering a backlash, it fell to number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 in one week and left the chart a week later.[30]\n\nOutside the United States, \"Landslide\" reached number two in Canada and became the band's only top-10 hit in Australia, where it reached number six.[31][32] It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[33][34]\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nUS and Canadian CD single[35][36]\n\n\"Landslide\" (album version) – 3:49\n\n\"Landslide\" (the Sheryl Crow remix) – 3:47\n\nAustralian CD single[37]\n\n\"Landslide\" (the Sheryl Crow remix)\n\n\"Landslide\"\n\n\"Landslide\" (live from the Kodak Theater)\n\n\"Landslide\" (video version)\n\nEuropean maxi-CD single[38]\n\n\"Landslide\" (album version) – 3:49\n\n\"Long Time Gone\" – 4:08\n\n\"Landslide\" (the Sheryl Crow remix) – 3:47\n\n\"Landslide\" (the Sheryl Crow remix—video) – 3:45\n\nUK CD single[39]\n\n\"Landslide\" (the Sheryl Crow remix) – 3:47\n\n\"Landslide\" (album version) – 3:49\n\n\"Landslide\" (live from the Kodak Theater) – 4:07\n\n\"Landslide\" (the Sheryl Crow remix—video version) – 3:45\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications\n\n[edit]\n\nCertifications and sales for \"Landslide\" Region Certification Certified units/sales Australia (ARIA)[34] 3× Platinum 210,000‡ United States (RIAA)[33] 2× Platinum 2,000,000‡\n\n‡ Sales+streaming figures based on certification alone.\n\nRelease history\n\n[edit]\n\nRelease dates and formats for \"Landslide\" Region Date Format(s) Label(s) Ref.
