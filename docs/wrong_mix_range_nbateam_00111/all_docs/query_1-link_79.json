        "text": "Statement-making makes “SportsCenter.”\n\nA teeth-clenching, clutch 3-pointer. A chest-to-face dunk. A shot swat to the second row.\n\nBut sometimes, a statement is made amid the basketball whirlwind — a statement so strong, yet so brief, even fervent and focused fans miss it.\n\nSuch was the case Friday night at the Pepsi Center, when Nuggets guard J.R. Smith entered the game against the Lakers and went right at Kobe Bryant — as a defender.\n\n“His very first play he fronted Kobe, instead of waiting for Kobe to kick his butt,” Nuggets coach George Karl said of Smith, who slithered in front of Bryant and prevented the all-star from receiving the ball in the low post. “(Smith) knew that he would have to do some work early.”\n\nSmith’s statement that night to the Lakers — and to his coaches and teammates — was that he’s willing to fight on defense. For years, Smith was a defensive matador, waving the red flag, allowing players to pass. Now he’s a defensive matador who utilizes his sword, so to speak.\n\n“I’ve been picking up my intensity,” Smith said, “trying to get a hand on the ball, scrambling, running around trying to find any open man, running around hard.”\n\nSmith still is no Bruce Bowen. But in his first three games back from a season-starting suspension, Smith’s defense has been as impressive as his offense — if not more impressive, according to Karl.\n\nWhat does all this mean?\n\nWell, assuming this defensive upgrade isn’t a fluke, this could mean more playing time for Denver’s top reserve — so far, Smith has averaged 14.3 points and 27 minutes per game. In previous seasons, Karl has called Smith a “good-bad player.” And after Monday’s practice, Karl said Smith’s minutes are based on just how much “bad” Smith can eliminate from his performances. And with Smith playing passionate defense, “the more he will be effective,” said Karl, whose Nuggets (7-3) play Toronto (5-5) tonight at the Pepsi Center.\n\nIn previous seasons, Karl sometimes mixed and matched his lineup in the final minutes of close games, putting in Smith for an offensive possession and then, say, Anthony Carter or Dahntay Jones for a defensive possession.\n\n“I think (Smith) will be in more,” Karl said in reference to late-game defensive situations. “I definitely won’t say all,” noting that the coach also likes newcomer Arron Afflalo as a defensive shooting guard.\n\nBut the fact that Karl is even having this internal debate shows Smith’s progress.\n\nNuggets assistant Jamahl Mosley spends ample time coaching Smith, and Mosley sees Smith’s evolving work ethic in film study and practice sessions, which leads, in part, to plays such as the Kobe-fronting or Smith’s drawn charge in Friday’s 105-79 rout of the Lakers.\n\n“He’s coming into a maturity about himself,” Mosley said. “He’s understanding what it takes to get to that next level. He’s always been a guy who has seen other people achieve certain things, but I think he’s determined enough to get to that next level. That’s been the biggest improvement — his maturity level and his ability to work and go after what he wants.”\n\nSmith said he has never been this confident playing defense. In Smith’s second game, for instance, he had four steals. For Karl, though, it’s the little things that aren’t on the stat sheet that showcase Smith’s confidence.\n\n“I think he’s understanding that, for us, so much of defense comes from when our weakside defense is alert and active,” Karl said, “and too many times over the last few years, our weak side has been asleep. But lately, our weak side is learning and J.R. is a part of that. He’s learning to rotate early, help early, and sometimes he’s a free safety and he’s allowed to go anywhere he wants to go. And then his one-on-one defense and his courage to get over screens has improved too.”\n\nBenjamin Hochman: 303-954-1294 or bhochman@denverpost.com\n\nToronto at Denver\n\n7 p.m. tonight, ALT, KKHI 101.9 FM\n\nSpotlight on Chris Bosh: The 6-foot-10 post player is playing like an MVP this season, averaging 27.7 points (ranking fifth in the NBA) and 11.6 rebounds (third). “His height, versatility, quickness and ball handling makes him tough,” Nuggets guard Arron Afflalo said. “And he’s stepping out and shooting some 3s sometimes.” Bosh has hit 6-of-7 shots from 3-point range this season.\n\nNuggets: Rookie guard Ty Lawson (strained calf) said he will play tonight, and forwards Kenyon Martin (patella tendinitis) and Chris Anderson (patella tendinitis) are expected to play, coach George Karl said. Anthony Carter (strained hip) remains questionable. . . . The Nuggets are 3-0 at home. . . . Joey Graham played the previous four seasons with Toronto, averaging 6.4 points. . . . Martin and Carmelo Anthony held community events Monday. Anthony donated meals to families at the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver (Johnson Branch) and Martin donated Thanksgiving turkeys at the Lawrence Street Shelter.\n\nRaptors: Toronto is coming off a 101-100 loss Sunday at Phoenix, falling to 2-4 on the road. . . . Point guard Jose Calderon is ninth in the NBA in assists with an average of 6.7. Center-forward Andrea Bargnani ranks second in free-throw percentage (93.9), trailing the Nuggets’ Lawson (94.1). . . . Tonight’s game could be a shootout — the Raptors are fourth in the NBA in scoring and the Nuggets rank fifth. Benjamin Hochman, The Denver Post"
