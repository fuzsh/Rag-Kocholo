        "text": "Game 6 of the NBA Finals, the biggest game in the history of the Cavaliers franchise. If they win, they force a Game 7, putting them one game from the first championship in franchise history. If they lose, their season is over, and LeBron James has fallen short once again, squandering another year and another opportunity for Cleveland to finally smile.\n\nThe tip was won, the ball went to J.R. Smith, and destiny called him. He had to make the moment his.\n\nYes, J.R. Smith started off an NBA Finals game with an airballed 30-footer with plenty of time on the shot clock. (I know this Vine doesn't go far enough to the left to capture the ball thudding off the floor, but trust me, it does. Blame J.R. for shooting so far away.)\n\nIt's not all bad -- as J.R's daughter pointed out today, winning doesn't matter -- it's cool enough that he's even on the team!\n\n(Cleveland started the game on an 8-0 run and Smith hit a big three later in the first quarter, but this moment was still funny.)"
