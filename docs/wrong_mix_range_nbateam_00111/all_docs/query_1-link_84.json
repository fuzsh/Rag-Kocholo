        "text": "EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (April 13, 2023) – J.R. Smith is a sophomore at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. During his freshman year, Smith joined the men’s golf team, adding to his new collegiate experiences. In addition to being a relatively new student, he also happens to be a retired NBA superstar. On April 4, Prime Video released “Redefined: J.R. Smith.” The docuseries follows Smith as he pursues a college education and new athletic passion at A&T.\n\nSmith’s story serves as a powerful reminder that with determination and resilience, one can overcome even the toughest setbacks and achieve success. Having been drafted to the NBA straight out of high school at just 19, Smith suddenly finds himself without an NBA team to call home and in search of redefining his life and career. The series picks up with Smith setting new intentions for himself, getting a college education, participating in a collegiate sport and navigating the nation’s largest historically Black university.\n\nCurrently available on Prime Video, “Redefined: J.R. Smith” is executive produced by LeBron James and Maverick Carter with their multi-Emmy award-winning athlete empowerment brand UNINTERRUPTED. The docuseries is presented by Prime Video Sports and produced by UNINTERRUPTED."
