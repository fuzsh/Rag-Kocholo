        "text": "J.R. Smith is a retired NBA player who played for 16 years in the NBA and won three NBA Championships.\n\nEarl Joseph Smith III, nicknamed “J.R.” was born in Freehold, New Jersey on September 9, 1985. He was raised in Millstone Township, New Jersey, and played basketball for Lakewood High School in Ocean County, New Jersey through his sophomore year. As a junior, he enrolled at Saint Benedict’s Preparatory School in Newark, New Jersey, where he excelled at basketball, as well as football and track. As a senior, Smith focused exclusively on basketball. He was invited to play in the 2004 McDonald’s All-American Game, where he was named the co-Most Valuable Player. He was also designated as a Second-team Parade All-American. Smith declared for the NBA Draft after his senior year in high school.\n\nDrafted by the New Orleans Hornets, he had a good showing in his rookie season. Smith started in 56 of the 76 games that he played in and averaged 10 points, two rebounds, and two assists per game while playing an average of 25 minutes per game. He was part of the Dunk Contest held during All-Star Weekend of his rookie year, and he placed third in the competition. In his second season with the Hornets, he had a falling out with the head coach and by the end of the season had gone from starting to the bench. He was traded to first the Chicago Bulls and then the Denver Nuggets before the start of the next season.\n\nSmith was suspended for 10 games during his first season with the Nuggets for his part in an in-game altercation between the Nuggets and the Knicks, commonly referred to as “Malice at the Palace” in sports lore. During the 2007–08 season, he started in 18 of the 81 games that he played in for the Nuggets and recorded an average of 15.2 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game. While he would not be a starter for Denver during the next two seasons, he gained a reputation as a great sixth man recording similar statistics both of those years.\n\nThe 2011–2012 season saw the NBA Lockout, which caused Smith to go overseas and play in the Chinese Basketball Association. He played 32 games for the Zhejiang Golden Bulls under a contract reportedly worth $3 million. Smith averaged 34 points, seven rebounds, four assists, and two steals per game during that season. He did not return to the United States at the end of the lockout due to his obligation to the Zhejiang Golden Bulls.\n\nWhen he did return from China, Smith signed with the New York Knicks. He finished the regular season with them and played in their postseason. He averaged 12 points per game for the Knicks during this time, which included a total of 40 games during the regular and postseason. He would spend two and a half more seasons with the Knicks. During the 2012-2013 season, he averaged more than 18 points, five rebounds, two assists, and a steal per game. The next season, he averaged 14.5 points, four rebounds, and three assists per game. During his final year with them, his average points decreased to 10.9 points, with two rebounds and three assists per game. After 30 games in the 2014-2015 season, he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nSmith made an immediate impact after arriving in Cleveland, starting in 45 of the 46 games that he played in for them that season. He played roughly 32 minutes per game and recorded an average of 14 points with three rebounds and four assists per game. He re-signed with the Cavaliers for the following season and started in every game he played in, averaging 12.4 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 1.1 steals per game. He also started in 21 playoff games for the Cavaliers that season, helping them to win the NBA Championship.\n\nFor the next season, the Cavaliers signed Smith to a four-year $57 million deal and he again helped the team to another NBA Championship, averaging 8.6 points per game. Smith struggled during the next two seasons, seeing his numbers plummet, as he only averaged 8 and 6 points per game those seasons, respectively. The Cavaliers waived him at the end of the 2018-2019 season.\n\nIn 2020, Smith signed with the Lakers, playing in the last six regular season games and the playoffs with them and former Cleveland teammate, Lebron James. He won his third NBA Championship with the Lakers.\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA, he enrolled at North Carolina A&T State University where he is playing for the golf team and maintained a perfect grade point average.\n\nIn 2015, Smith obtained a federal trademark registration for a logo that includes the words “J.R. SMITH YOUTH FOUNDATION” for charitable fundraising services. Smith created an annual golf tournament, which helps to raise funds for his charity. The J.R. Smith Youth Foundation is designed to help young people."
