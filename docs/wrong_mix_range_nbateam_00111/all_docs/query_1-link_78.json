        "text": "Shavlik Randolph explains why J.R. Smith’s people constantly get in fights in China: “The other teams are told to have a player that tries to play physical with him and rough him up… He’s sitting there playing against double & triple teams the whole game. I think his family is just protective & they don’t like to see players play that physical with him. He’s over here scoring 35 or 40 points a game & someone is in the game specifically to try to play hard against you or foul you.”\n\nChandler’s camp understands this and hopes to sign a long-term contract with the Nuggets. If the two sides can’t work out a deal, Chandler is prepared to sit out the remainder of the season and test free agency in July. He would still be a restricted free agent, but he would be able to sign an offer sheet and more teams would have money to throw around.\n\nMultiple sources say Smith is looking for the opportunity to showcase his talents and while the Knicks certainly need help at guard, J.R. has already had a stint with Carmelo Anthony. That may not be as appealing to Smith as some might think. A more appealing option might be the Minnesota Timberwolves who have their $2.5 million, are suddenly a .500 team and have a true need at the two long-term. Coach Rick Adelman has a tremendous reputation for bringing out the best in players who have had difficulty adjusting to the NBA (Metta World Peace nee Ron Artest).\n\nCarmelo Anthony thinks J.R. Smith, his former teammate in Denver, could handle New York well if he were to sign with the Knicks. “Yeah, I think so, he’s one of those type of players,” Anthony told a small group of reporters after the Knicks’ win over the Nets on Saturday. “If it happens, it happens and I’ll be happy.”\n\nMike D’Antoni acknowledged the Knicks’ need for another shooter and indicated the club would be “aggressive’’ in looking at free agent guard J.R. Smith. Smith, a former Nugget, will be eligible to play in the NBA once FIBA clears him following his Chinese Basketball Association playoff run. He’s on the Knicks’ radar and the feeling appears to be mutual — unless the club is getting used again. Smith tweeted on Friday: “New York City is where it’s at!’’\n\nThe Clippers will continue to search for ways to improve their team by looking at the best available free agents, and J.R. Smith will be considered one of the best for NBA teams when he becomes available after his team in the Chinese Basketball Assn. finishes its season. The New York Knicks might have a big advantage in landing Smith because of the possibility he could be a starter for them and make more money, according to two people with knowledge of the situation who were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. The Clippers don’t have the mini mid-level exception because they used it on Martin, but the Knicks still have that exception, which is worth $2.5 million. But the Clippers have two trade exceptions from the Eric Gordon and Al-Farouq Aminu trade to New Orleans for Chris Paul. One is for $3.8 million and the other is for $2.7 million, and the Clippers are willing to use those exceptions on any player. The Clippers also could use the veteran’s minimum of $1.2 million to sign a free agent."
