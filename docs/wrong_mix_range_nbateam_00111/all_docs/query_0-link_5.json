For the boxer, see Ishe Smith.\n\nIshmael Larry \"Ish\" Smith (born July 5, 1988) is an American professional basketball player who last played for the Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. Smith holds the record of playing for the most NBA franchises, at 13. He won an NBA championship with the Nuggets in 2023.[1]\n\nSmith attended Central Cabarrus High School playing under Scott Brewer. He averaged 24.8 points and 9.8 assists per game as a senior and led Central Cabarrus to a 25–3 record and a MECA–6 Conference regular season and tournament title, which earned him the Meca–6 Conference Player of the Year in 2006, all-conference honors and being named Piedmont Player of the Year by The Charlotte Observer's (he also earned the last two accolades as a junior).[2]\n\nWhen he graduated, he was ranked as the No. 28 point guard in the country according to Rivals.com while being rated by Scout.com as the No. 17 point guard and the No. 82 prospect nationally.[2]\n\nSmith played college basketball for Wake Forest, finishing second all-time for assists in school history.[2] In his four years with the Deacons he had averages of 9.2 points, 5.1 assists, 3.7 rebounds and 1.26 steals in 121 games. He also stands as the only player in school history with 1,000 points (1,114) and 600 assists (612) in his career.[3]\n\nAs a senior, Smith averaged 13.2 points, 6.0 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.68 steals. He was named Second-Team All-ACC and earned Second-Team All-District honors from the NABC. Smith also received the team’s Murray Greason Award and Team Assists Leader award after finishing third in the ACC and seventh nationally in assists per game in 2009–10.[3]\n\nAfter going undrafted on the 2010 NBA draft, Smith signed with the Houston Rockets on August 23, 2010.[3] On January 17, 2011, he was assigned to the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA Development League.[4] He was recalled by the Rockets on January 24, reassigned on February 1,[5] and recalled again on February 7.\n\nOn February 24, 2011, Smith was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies along with teammate Shane Battier in exchange for Hasheem Thabeet, DeMarre Carroll and a future first-round draft pick.[6] Smith made 15 appearances for the Grizzlies in the 2010–11 season after the trade, all off of the bench. On December 14, 2011, Smith was waived by the Grizzlies.[7]\n\nOn December 16, 2011, Smith was claimed off waivers by the Golden State Warriors.[8] On December 28, he started for the Warriors in a win against the New York Knicks in place of the injured Stephen Curry, scoring 11 points, with 6 rebounds and 4 assists.[9] Smith was later waived by the Warriors on January 13, 2012.[10]\n\nOn February 2, 2012, Smith signed with the Orlando Magic.[11] On August 15, 2012, he re-signed with the Magic.[12]\n\nOn February 21, 2013, Smith was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks along with JJ Redick and Gustavo Ayón in exchange for Beno Udrih, Doron Lamb and Tobias Harris.[13]\n\nOn August 29, 2013, Smith and Viacheslav Kravtsov were traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Caron Butler.[14] In his third game with the Suns, Smith dished out a career-high 8 assists in a 104–98 win over the New Orleans Pelicans.

Smith became one of only three Suns backups since the 1980s to collect at least two 8-assist games in less than 20 minutes of playing time in a single season; the others being Jeff Hornacek and Goran Dragić.[15] On February 21, 2014, he scored a then-career-high 15 points in a 106–85 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[16] On July 15, 2014, he was waived by the Suns.[17]\n\nOn July 19, 2014, Smith signed with the Houston Rockets.[18] However, he was waived by the Rockets on October 27 after appearing in seven preseason games.[19]\n\nOn November 7, 2014, Smith signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder to help the team deal with numerous injuries.

He went 11 of 14 from the field and finished three points shy of his career high—his previous season high was 19 points.[43] On October 20, 2018, he scored all 15 of his points in the second half, including the game-winning basket, in a 118–116 win over the Chicago Bulls.[44] On January 14, 2019, he returned to action against the Utah Jazz after missing 19 games with a torn adductor muscle.[45] He aggravated the injury in his third game back.[46]\n\nOn July 9, 2019, Smith signed with the Washington Wizards, and played his first game with the team on October 23, 2019, scoring 7 points.[47] This marked the 11th team that Smith played for in the previous eight seasons.\n\nOn August 7, 2021, Smith signed with his hometown team, the Charlotte Hornets.[48] The signing marked Smith's record-tying 12th different NBA franchise, joining Joe Smith, Chucky Brown, Jim Jackson, Kevin Ollie and Tony Massenburg as the only players to play for 12 different NBA teams.[49]\n\nOn February 10, 2022, Smith was traded back to the Washington Wizards, alongside Vernon Carey Jr., in exchange for Montrezl Harrell.[50]\n\nOn July 6, 2022, Smith was traded, alongside Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Monté Morris and Will Barton.[51] On October 19, 2022, Smith made his team debut.
