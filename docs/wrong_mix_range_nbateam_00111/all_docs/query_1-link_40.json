        "text": "JR Smith Biography\n\nJR Smith earned McDonald’s All-American honors while playing at Saint Benedict’s Preparatory School in 2004. After an impressive 25-point MVP performance at the All-American game he declared for the NBA Draft and was selected in the first round with the 18th overall pick by the New Orleans Hornets. During his first season with the Hornets he averaged 10.3 points per game, and has gone on to become one of the premier scoring threats in the league. After four seasons in New Orleans he signed with the Denver Nuggets and has since become a member of the New York Knicks. While playing for the Knicks he posted a career high 18.1 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in route to earning the NBA Sixth Man of the Year award in 2013. In the playoffs he has been just as solid, averaging 13 points per game in seven postseason appearances with a career high 18.3 points per game in 2008 with the Nuggets. Thus far in his eleven year NBA career he has averaged 13.3 points per game and been a valuable ambassador for each team he has played for.\n\nBook JR Smith for your Next Event"
