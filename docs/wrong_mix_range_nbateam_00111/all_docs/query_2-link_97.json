        "text": "(EDITOR’S NOTE: The Cavaliers and JR Smith have separated following the publication of this article. Smith will remain away from the team while the Cavs attempt to trade him.)\n\nDETROIT — When the Lakers’ charter jet touches down Tuesday afternoon at Hopkins, LeBron James will briefly step back into his old life again for only a moment. James has moved on and is presumably happy with his new life in Los Angeles. Those left behind are still sorting through the rubble and emotions that always seem to accompany his exits.\n\nLarry Nance Jr. remains thrilled with how everything has worked out. He bought a house in his hometown even before signing a lucrative extension over the summer and has lunch with his parents multiple times a week. Just a kid from Akron who is happy to be home.\n\nGeorge Hill remains grateful for the opportunity to play in the Finals for the first time in his career while acknowledging his future here is uncertain and could be ending by the trade deadline.\n\nThen there is JR Smith. He is finding it harder and harder to hide his contempt toward the organization these days. Smith has asked to be traded twice, but he’s still here in part because he refuses to accept a buyout. He made it clear in a conversation with The Athletic on Monday that he has no relationship with general manager Koby Altman and he has no interest in playing for a team that has no interest in winning.\n\nIt might be clear by now the Cavs are tanking, but Smith is the first player to say as much publicly.\n\n“I don’t think the goal is to win. The goal isn’t to go out there and try to get as many wins as you can,” Smith said. “I think the goal is to develop and lose to get lottery picks. I think that was always the plan.”\n\nAnd as long as the Cavs are operating this way, Smith is not interested in being part of it.\n\n“Not if the goal isn’t to compete, to win,” he said.\n\nThe Cavs are facing a bit of a credibility crisis with some of their veterans. The talk all summer was how they still had enough to compete, how they were going to push for a playoff berth even without James. Then two games into the season, they pivoted to benching veterans and going with a youth movement — even before Kevin Love’s surgery and Tyronn Lue’s firing.\n\nI asked Hill when the organization recalibrated, when they went from competing to developing (tanking). Hill backed Smith in a sense. This was always the plan.\n\n“I think it recalibrated before Game 1 was even played,” Hill said. “In the summer, it felt like politically you have to say we can still do these things because you want everyone to buy in to being here. Once everybody is here, I don’t know. The directions change.”\n\nThe organization insisted to Love they were going to compete, which is part of the reason he signed here long term. The Athletic reported previously that Kyle Korver was assured he would be bought out or traded if James left, yet he’s still here.\n\nAnd now there is the realization this team never intended to compete. Executives around the league shook their heads in disbelief all summer at the idea the Cavs could contend for the playoffs with this roster. Now it’s clear they never really believed it, either. It was just an ill-conceived stunt to try to keep interest high both publicly and internally among the players.\n\n“I’ve been on teams where we’ve won 18 games and the development stage was to try to win at any cost,” Smith said. “It wasn’t just for my development or the next person. The goal was always to win.”\n\nBut Smith insists that isn’t happening here. The results indicate he’s on to something. The Cavs trailed by 30 points Monday at Detroit and never led despite having five days off between games.\n\nThe harsh reality is the Cavs are right where they need to be. They need to lose these games, keep their draft pick (it is top 10 protected) and develop guys like Collin Sexton and Cedi Osman while waiting for one of the Duke studs to arrive next summer.\n\nBut that isn’t what they sold their players or the public. They kept up this silly “playoffs” belief even when everyone else understood it wasn’t reality.\n\n“I think that was to save face with everybody else, honestly,” Smith said.\n\nOf course, trading Smith is easier said than done because of his contract situation. If Smith, who shares an agent with James in Rich Paul, wanted out so badly, he could give back a few million dollars on his current deal and the Cavs would probably send him on his way. But Smith refuses to negotiate a buyout, so the two sides remain locked in this staring contest.\n\n“I don’t want my legacy to be remembered like that in Cleveland,” Smith said of a buyout. “I don’t think that’s fair to the people I see every single day walking around the arena. I don’t think that’s fair to the trainers or equipment guys. … I just look at it differently than being traded. I don’t like the statement of getting bought out.”\n\nThe Cavs were made aware of Smith’s remarks after the loss to the Pistons. They declined comment.\n\nAntawn Jamison arrived in Cleveland at the trade deadline in 2010 expecting to compete for a championship. When the Cavs were stunned by Boston in the second round, Jamison was trapped here for another year after James bolted for Miami. Jamison was a prisoner counting the hours until his release.\n\nNow Hill is that veteran who was traded to Cleveland midseason expecting to play for a championship. And while the Cavs did make the Finals, now Hill is trapped here the year after a James departure. At least publicly, he’s keeping a stiff upper lip about it.\n\nHe remains thrilled he had the opportunity to play in an NBA Finals, although he was haunted most of the summer by his missed free throw at the end of Game 1 against Golden State. If Hill makes that shot, Smith doesn’t have the chance to forget the score and maybe the Cavs win Game 1. Maybe it changes the complexion of the entire series.\n\n“You’re a little depressed at first because as a player, as a competitor, you put the blame on yourself a little bit. All summer it kind of bothered me,” Hill said. “If I hit that free throw, would it have been a different series? Or would it just have been 4-1? It’s getting a win instead of getting skunked. But if it’s 4-1 then it really doesn’t matter about one fucking game. But who knows? I hit that, the pressure is on them now. Maybe it’s a different series.”\n\nHill has no animosity toward James for leaving. He deeply admires what James has accomplished both on and off the court and believes what he has done for kids in Akron — from his I Promise School to his agreement with the University of Akron to provide scholarships to his foundation kids who qualify — separates him from his contemporaries like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.\n\nThe Cavs will honor James for his 11 years in Cleveland with a tribute during the game Wednesday, and Hill hopes fans in attendance cheer him accordingly.\n\n“If you boo him, you’re an asshole,” Hill said. “He just means too much to this city, to this organization.”\n\nNance was in attendance in 2010 when James returned for the first time as a member of the Heat. But he didn’t boo despite being trapped in a crock pot of hate. Nance was a high school basketball star attending the game with his father, another Cavs legend. So there was a certain level of decorum expected from them. Nance and his father sat there quietly and soaked it all in.\n\nNance is now married and settled here. He has no regrets about the midseason trade that brought him home.\n\n“Do I resent the trade or regret it? Absolutely not,” Nance said. “Everywhere I go, people ask ‘Don’t you miss Bron?’ or ‘Don’t you wish you were still in L.A.?’ I don’t wish I was still in L.A. I’m happy here. I’m signed here for a long time. I’m home. I can handle where we’re at right now because I’m happy and happiness matters over everything else.”\n\nNance is happy. James is happy. Hill is content. Smith is still searching for his new normal. It’s all part of the seismic shifts James creates wherever he goes. At this point, the Cavs are just trying to pass this kidney stone, get through Wednesday’s festivities and return to their long road to recovery.\n\n“I thank them for giving me the opportunity to come here last year to do something that I may never have another chance to do, and that’s play in the NBA Finals,” Hill said. “I’m forever grateful to Cleveland no matter what.”\n\n(Photo of JR Smith: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images)"
