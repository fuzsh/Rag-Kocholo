The Enemy played the first of their four goodbye shows in their home city this weekend.

The popular rock trio, who announced in April they were set to draw their decade-long career in the music industry to a close, performed on Saturday night.

The band took to the stage at The Empire, situated in Far Gosford Street, as part of their Last Orders Tour.

The sell-out performance will be followed up by three shows in October.

Tom, Andy and Liam put on a brilliant performance for their fans, with many taking to social media after the show concluded to share their thoughts.

Many were disappointed the band were calling it a day, with others praising their performance.

The band will continue to tour the UK extensively, before taking to the stage at the Far Gosford Street venue for three shows on three consecutive nights, between October 6 and October 8.

Across their decade-long career, The Enemy have performed numerous times in Coventry, in a range of venues stretching from the Kasbah to The Empire, HMV, Seven nightclub, and Rehab Warehouse.

Between 2006 and 2008, the Coventry natives performed at three consecutive Godiva Festival events in War Memorial Park.
