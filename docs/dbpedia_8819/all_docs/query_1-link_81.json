        "text": "The Enemy is a popular English rock band, comprised of three talented musicians who bring their professionalism and passion for music to every event they attend. Having formed in 2006, the band takes inspiration from icons such as Oasis and The Clash when creating their top hits. When looking to hire a respected rock band to entertain audiences at your event, do not hesitate in booking The Enemy today.\n\nConsisting of Tom Clarke, Andy Hopkins, and Liam Watts, The Enemy first performed as the opening act at Coventry’s Godiva Festival in 2006. First gaining acclaim when they were mentioned in the NME as the act most likely to ‘break your windows’, the talented musicians gained the opportunity to forward as the supporting act for Oasis, The Fratellis, Kasabian, The Paddington’s, Ash, Manic Street Preachers, The Rolling Stones, and Stereophonics on their UK tours. Also gaining the chance to perform at a variety of festivals throughout 2007, including Glastonbury, The Enemy gained great success that year.\n\nThroughout their illustrious career, The Enemy have released four successful albums to date. Having performed across the UK for 10 years, in 2016, they decided that the band was going to split, but due to their incredible popularity throughout the music industry, The Enemy announced their reunion in 2022. In celebration of their debut album, they are completing a UK tour, honouring the incredible music that they have created as a band."
