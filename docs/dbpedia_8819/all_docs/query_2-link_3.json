What does Jesus say about the prophets?\n\n[Jesus said that none of them were like by the people of their hometowns.]\n\n2. How many widows did the prophet Elijah save from starvation during the famine?\n\n[Elijah saved only one widow.]\n\n3. How many lepers did the prophet Elisha cure?\n\n[He cured only one Syrian, Naaman.]\n\n4. How did the people of Nazareth react to Jesus' preaching?\n\n[They tried to throw him over a cliff.]\n\n5. Did Jesus escape?\n\n[Yes, he slipped through the crowd and got away.]\n\nHomePage | Calendar | Epiphany 4 Art | Epiphany 5 Lesson | Epiphany Cover"
