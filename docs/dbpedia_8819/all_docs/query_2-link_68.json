        "text": "OUR ENEMIES WILL VANISH: The Russian Invasion and Ukraine’s War of Independence, by Yaroslav Trofimov\n\n“Kyiv was still a city at peace,” Yaroslav Trofimov writes about the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2022, the day before Russian forces invaded Ukraine. The sun was shining, the bars were full; he saw no scenes of panic buying at the shops or snaking lines at the A.T.M.s.\n\nBut like the title of his new book, “Our Enemies Will Vanish,” Trofimov’s depiction of an idyllic Kyiv only emphasizes the brutal realities of the ensuing war. Trofimov is the chief foreign-affairs correspondent at The Wall Street Journal and the author of two previous books, “Faith at War” (2005) and “The Siege of Mecca” (2007). This time, as a Kyiv native, he has an intensely personal connection to his subject.\n\n“It felt wrong to wear on the streets of my own hometown the vest and the helmet that I had donned hundreds of times in Iraq, Afghanistan and other war zones,” Trofimov writes, driving past locations from his Soviet-era adolescence, including the cinema where he watched Fellini films and the botanical garden where he had his first kiss.\n\nLong before the invasion, Vladimir Putin had depicted Ukraine as an “artificial” country that ultimately belonged to Russia. His territorial ambitions were further inflamed during the pandemic, when he spent months of self-isolation “reading the wrong history books,” as Trofimov acerbically puts it. (Trofimov has yet another personal connection to Putin’s war: His colleague, Evan Gershkovich, has been detained by Russia for nearly 300 days, awaiting trial on charges of espionage that The Wall Street Journal and the American government steadfastly deny.) Trofimov is candid about his own feelings of outrage toward Russian forces: “How dare they, I thought.”\n\n“Our Enemies Will Vanish” is clearly not an outsider’s account, though as an experienced reporter, Trofimov mostly avoids the twin temptations of personalizing and pontificating, instead hewing closely to what he sees. He also provides some requisite historical context. The real start date of the war, he says, was eight years before the 2022 invasion, in 2014, when Putin declared that eastern and southern Ukraine should be known as Novorossiya, or “New Russia,” and seized control of Crimea and Donbas.\n\nFrom those early victories, Putin took the wrong lesson. In 2022, Moscow expected to wrap up the whole operation in 10 days — which might very well have happened, had Putin been satisfied with restricting Russian efforts to eastern Ukraine, instead of setting his sights on the entire country.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
