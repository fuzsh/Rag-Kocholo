        "text": "Politics and music go hand in hand. There have been, and continue to be, several prominent groups that have consistently made a good living delivering their respective ideologies to the masses. Here are 25 more notable bands with no problem unleashing their political voices.\n\n1 of 25\n\nAnti-Flag\n\nAnti-Flag\n\nAs we'll see, the punk genre is ripe for politically charged musical aggression. After all, isn't that the point? Anti-Flag has not enjoyed true mainstream success, but its left-wing message involving human rights and knocking big government has attracted a loyal and impressive following since its 1996 debut, Die for the Government.\n\n2 of 25\n\nBad Religion\n\nBad Religion\n\nWhile these pop-punk pioneers claim they don't necessarily politicize their music, the band has been outspoken against at least two Republican presidents — George W. Bush and Donald Trump, indirectly — and right-wing politics on 2019's Age of Unreason, which features a mix of the 2018 hit \"The Kids Are Alt-Right.\"\n\n3 of 25\n\nBlack 47\n\nBlack 47\n\nThese Celtic rockers for New York City were a semi-popular pub band during the 1990s and opened the door for others of the ilk to shine. Led by frontman Larry Kerwin, Black 47 consistently infused politics into its music and was quite good live. Whether tales of the IRA or opposing war and socializing its lyrics, Black 47 was more than willing to share a message and a pint or two with fans.\n\n4 of 25\n\nBlack Flag\n\nBlack Flag\n\nTrue pioneers of the hardcore punk movement in the United States, Black Flag was politically and socially conscious, especially when Henry Rollins joined the band in 1981. Like other punk groups, Black Flag challenged the establishment and conformity while also addressing awareness of the severity of poverty and the shunning of the lower class in America.\n\n5 of 25\n\nThe Clash\n\nThe Clash\n\nSocialism was at the forefront of The Clash's music. Its left-wing approach played well with anti-Nazi and other liberation groups and movements. Come on, the band had an album called Sandinista! At the forefront of The Clash's cause was Joe Strummer, a bed-wetting socialist who understood that music gave him an outlet for his beliefs in a way that would rankle the establishment — as a true punk should.\n\n6 of 25\n\nCreedence Clearwater Revival\n\nJohn Meore/The Journal News via Imagn Content Services, LLC/USA TODAY\n\nWhile John Fogerty and CCR liked to sing about lazy, country Southern living, the group was also quite political in its tone. It tackled issues of racism, poverty, and oppression. Like many acts of the 1960s and '70s, CCR took an anti-Vietnam War stance. Perhaps none more prominent than classic rock and pop culture favorite \"Fortunate Son.\"\n\n7 of 25\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young\n\nLarry McCormack/The Tennessean via Imagn Content Services, LLC/USA TODAY\n\nAs a foursome, it put out \"Ohio,\" one of the great protest songs of all time. An attack on then-President Richard Nixon and the national guard shootings of students at Kent State University. Plus, 1970s' Déjà Vu featured the hit \"Teach Your Children,\" a song about the effects of war on children. On their own — particularly Neil Young — the four have always used music to get their political message heard.\n\n8 of 25\n\nDead Kennedys\n\nDead Kennedys\n\nWidely considered the most influential of the hardcore punk bands in the United States. Led by frontman Jello Biafra, the Kennedys made a living with their anti-establishment and government stance. Political preference didn't matter. As time passed, the band, specifically Biafra, fought censorship with the brunt of its energy aimed at Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC).\n\n9 of 25\n\nDropkick Murphys\n\nGreg M. Cooper/USA TODAY Sports\n\nThese Boston Celtic punk rockers are all about the people, supporting and celebrating labor unions (\"The Worker's Song\") and championing veterans (\"Heroes from Our Past\"). While the band has had issues with Republican politicians, notably former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, its members have confirmed themselves a mix of Democrats and independents.\n\n10 of 25\n\nGreen Day\n\nJeff Curry/USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn truth, Green Day was musically relatively late to the political party. As the band's popularity grew, it always had to defend its credibility to those labeling it as pop-punk posers. However, the group started showing maturity on albums such as Nimrod (1997) and Warning (2000). Then, 2004's conceptual gem American Idiot merged Green Day's political interests with music. The album is a champion for the lower and middle classes while also taking shots at big business and big government.\n\n11 of 25\n\nJefferson Airplane\n\nRon Elkman/USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nOne of the more celebrated bands of the 1960s San Francisco music scene. Its acid/psychedelic rock sound was in step with the usual socially conscious issues of the '60s (anti-government, anti-war, and peace and love). Perhaps the Airplane's most politicized song was 1969's \"Volunteers,\" a shot at the United States government and the Vietnam War.\n\n12 of 25\n\nMegadeth\n\nMegadeth\n\nFrontman Dave Mustaine has always been a little bit surly. Mustaine is an intelligent guy who is very opinionated (he reportedly championed the Barack Obama birther conspiracy), especially when it comes to politics. \"Peace Sells\" offers a dark view of the world back in the mid-1980s, while commercial smash \"Symphony of Destruction\" touches on anarchy amid election season.\n\n13 of 25\n\nMidnight Oil\n\nMidnight Oil\n\nIt took some time for the Australian alternative rockers to enjoy mainstream success, but they did eventually break through with 1987's Diesel and Dust. Littered with its support of left-wing causes, environment awareness, and support of Australia's Indigenous people (\"Beds Are Burning\"), the album allowed Midnight Oil to become relevant on the international music scene.\n\n14 of 25\n\nN.W.A\n\nDerick E. Hingle/USA TODAY Sports\n\nSay what one will about any controversy surrounding N.W.A. and its lyrics, but the influential gangster rap act was brutally honest. Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, and the rest of the outfit knew no other way to express their thoughts on systemic racism, police brutality, poverty, and oppression. Perhaps that's why the group's legacy continues to get stronger.\n\n15 of 25\n\nPearl Jam\n\nGetty Images\n\nOne of the great live bands of all time, Pearl Jam has never shied away from using the stage as a pulpit. Particularly lead singer Eddie Vedder. There has always been a punk element to the band, thus its roundabout anti-establishment tone. The group has gone after Ticketmaster, George W. Bush (\"Bu$hleaguer,\" \"World Wide Suıcide\") and addressed issues such as suıcide and gun violence (\"Jeremy\"). Pearl Jam has always wanted to give fans a voice and not be afraid to use it for their beliefs.\n\n16 of 25\n\nPeter, Paul and Mary\n\nTim Dillon/USA TODAY\n\nLike many bands during the 1960s, politics and awareness of the changing social climate were popular topics in popular music. When it came to this famed trio, Peter, Paul, and Mary were not overtly critical of the government or certain policies. Still, as folk music stars, they offered a more harmonic and calming approach to the overall cause and movement.\n\n17 of 25\n\nPublic Enemy\n\nMatthew O'Haren/USA TODAY Sports\n\nLike many rap acts, racial and social injustice issues were a prominent part of PE's musical arsenal. The band's mainstream presence was much bigger than most of its contemporaries, so its word was stronger. \"Fight the Power,\" written for Spike Lee's classic Do The Right Thing, highlighted racial tensions in America. At the same time, \"911 is a Joke\" brought awareness to the lack of urgency in the medical response to predominantly Black neighborhoods. Those are just two examples of the passionate message Chuck D, Flavor Flav, and Co. sought to convey.\n\n18 of 25\n\nPu$$y Riot\n\nThomas Hawthorne/The Republic/USA TODAY\n\nDonald Trump is probably not a fan of this cult-favorite female Russian punk band. While its stage presence is built around conceptual and performance art, its musical message is not in line with the Russian government, specifically the group's disdain for president Vladimir Putin. Plus, it will throw in some feminist flare and girl-power stamina for fun.\n\n19 of 25\n\nRage Against the Machine\n\nTanya Breen via USA TODAY\n\nRage has been able to amass a huge following because of its unique rap/metal and alternative sound, thanks in large part to the genius guitar playing of Tom Morello. The band's lyrics have also constructively challenged authority, addressing issues such as police brutality (\"Killing in the Name\") and systemic racism. The band's leftist views attack the U.S. government and regularly question foreign policy (\"Bulls on Parade\"), all while turning their live shows into a frenzy of passion.\n\n20 of 25\n\nRise Against\n\nRise Against\n\nOne of the more underrated punk outfits. (Pop-tinged, too.) This Chicago-based band has always mixed politics into their music. \"Ready to Fall\" tackles environmental issues, and the band endorsed Barack Obama during his first presidential run in 2008. In a throwback to the early days of hardcore U.S. punk, various band members live a straight-edge lifestyle.\n\n21 of 25\n\nSex Pistols\n\nRichard E. Aaron/Redferns/Getty Images\n\nThe infamous English punks had just one studio album. However, it might be the most politically charged punk record of all time. Like the band itself, the album was a breeding ground for controversy. \"God Save the Queen\" was a campy attack on Queen Elizabeth II, and \"Anarchy in the U.K.\" looks at civil war in the United Kingdom. It remains one of the most celebrated and important albums in the history of punk.\n\n22 of 25\n\nSleater-Kinney\n\nSleater-Kinney\n\nArguably one of the great alt-punk outfits to come out of the 1990s. Carrie Brownstein, Corin Tucker, and formerly Janet Weiss have influenced many with a more mature take on the \"riot grrrl\" round. The band wasn't afraid to shatter female stereotypes, champion feminism, and take a serious approach to same-sex relationships and shunning conformity.\n\n23 of 25\n\nBruce Springsteen and the E Street Band\n\nRobert Deutsch/USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nOK, we mentioned we weren't going to showcase solo artists, but Bruce did some of his most political work with the E Street band backing him. Specifically on Born in the U.S.A. The title track is a protest song. It's also important to note that E Streeters like Nils Lofgren and Steve Van Zandt have infused politics into their own music away from the band.\n\n24 of 25\n\nSystem of a Down\n\nSystem of a Down\n\nWhile the band has been criticized for being all over the metal map, it's still popular within a genre in which acts have struggled to enjoy sustained commercial success. However one wants to describe the group, it can be agreed that System of a Down usually has something worth listening to when it comes to politics. The band has sung about the drug wars (\"Prison Song\"), bureaucracy (\"Cigaro\"), and even the Armenian genocide (\"Holy Mountains\").\n\n25 of 25\n\nU2\n\nPeter Ackerman via USA TODAY\n\nPolitical history and awareness have always been part of U2's stellar catalog. From the early protest days of War (\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"New Year's Day\") and right up until the latest version of Songs of Experience (2017). Bono and Co. have no problem voicing their take on the political climate of the moment and solidarity, but their off-stage activism also makes U2 perhaps the most socially conscious band on the planet.\n\nA Chicago native, Jeff Mezydlo has professionally written about sports, entertainment and pop culture for parts of four decades.
