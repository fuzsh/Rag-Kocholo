        "text": "My good pal Axl Rosenberg and I are two very different people, a basic tenet of MetalSucks that our readers often do not understand, with very different tastes in music.\n\nThat said, I agree wholeheartedly with the assessment he made about Imonolith when he wrote up both their first and second singles: move right along, nothing to see here! Bo-ring.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the band features Ryan Van Poederooyen and Brian Waddell from the Devin Townsend Project, Threat Signal’s Jon Howard, Kai Huppunen from Methods of Mayhem, and Scott Whalen (Econoline Crush). Byron Stroud and Jed Simon from Strapping Young Lad used to be in the band, but both quit.\n\nOne would think, especially given the (now-former) SYL affiliation, that Imonolith would be capable of producing something at least minorly slap-worthy, but both prior singles and the latest, “Becoming the Enemy,” sound as if they should’ve been released to mainstream rock radio 15 years ago… and even then they wouldn’t’ve had enough mustard to cut it. Even a guest vocal appearance from Avatar’s Johannes Eckerström can’t save this one: it’s boring nu-metal riffs gussied up to appear more edgy and aggressive, but it ain’t workin’."
