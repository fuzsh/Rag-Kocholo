        "text": "An Enemy of the People: A Theater Project from America’s Hometown will present acclaimed actors, elected officials, scientists, journalists, and local community members performing dramatic readings of scenes from Henrik Ibsen’s 1882 play An Enemy of the People to help frame powerful, guided audience discussions aimed at generating connection, understanding, compassion, and positive action.\n\nThe play tells the story of a doctor who discovers the water supply in his small, rural town has been poisoned by a tannery. Despite his efforts to convey the truth to the public, the doctor fails to save his community from environmental disaster and is ultimately scapegoated for his whistleblowing. An Enemy of the People was first performed in Norway in 1882, and yet it speaks to the present moment as if it were written for our time.\n\nThe project will officially premiere in Washington D.C. in late February, with a second set of presentations scheduled in Knox County in early April–at Knox Memorial Theater in Mount Vernon at 6:00pm on April 6, and at Oden Hall in Gambier on April 7 at 4:00pm."
