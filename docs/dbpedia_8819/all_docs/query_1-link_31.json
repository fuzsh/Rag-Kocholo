        "text": "\"1989 …\"\n\nPublic Enemy's Flavor Flav and Chuck D come in hard right from the first words of the group's culture-shifting hip-hop anthem, namechecking the year of its creation as the social, racial, and political backdrop for the bold rebuke to come. What follows is one of music's most potent musical statements of any era or genre — a sound and a fury that landed \"Fight The Power\" in its rightful spot in the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame as part of the class of 2018.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://tools.applemusic.com/embed/v1/song/859660761?country=us\" height=\"110px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\nThe song's inception began when director Spike Lee approached Public Enemy about penning an anthem for his 1989 film, Do The Right Thing. Chuck D got right to work on a flight to Europe for a tour with Run D.M.C., during which he wrote most of the lyrics that, when set to a punchy Bomb Squad (Public Enemy's production team) track, became a fixture not only of music history but American culture.\n\nMore than an outpour of outrage, \"Fight The Power\" captured the urgency of racial tensions happening in both Lee's film and in the real neighborhoods of New York, in addition to announcing the group's refusal to be ignored.\n\nLandmark moments like this one are no mistake. Here are seven insights into \"Fight The Power\" you might not have known.\n\n1. Isley Inspiration\n\nAccording to Chuck D, the song was inspired by the Isley Brothers' song of the same name that was released as a single in 1975. The message behind both songs is similar and the Isleys even went as far as to call racial oppression \"bulls***,\" a bold move at the time that didn't stop the song from hitting No. 1 on the R&B singles chart. But Public Enemy's refresh dealt with abuse of authority on a whole new level of directness.\n\nAs Chuck D explained to Rolling Stone, \"The challenge was, could we make something entirely different that said the same thing in another genre?\"\n\nPublic Enemy were more than up to that challenge, but it's quite possible their anthem would have at least had a different hook were it not for the Isley Brothers' bravery.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://tools.applemusic.com/embed/v1/song/426328445?country=us\" height=\"110px\" width=\"100%\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\n\n2. Keep On Fighting\n\nIn June 1989 \"Fight The Power\" was released as a single from the soundtrack for Do The Right Thing, hitting No. 1 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. Public Enemy also included a different version of the song on their third studio album, 1990's Fear Of A Black Planet, a release that eventually sold over 2 million copies and cemented the group as voice of the hip-hop movement. The song has been widely used ever since as a protest anthem against social injustice far beyond the confines of Brooklyn, prompting Chuck D to call it \"the most important record that Public Enemy have done.\"\n\n3. Favor Flav's GRAMMY Moment\n\n\"Fight The Power\" was nominated for Best Rap Performance for the 32nd GRAMMY Awards, though the trophy was ultimately awarded to Young MC's \"Bust A Move.\" Never one to be outdone, Flavor Flav jumped onstage with Young MC uninvited, crashing his acceptance speech. \"I'd like to thank Flavor Flav for breaking up the monotony of my acceptance speech,” Young MC noted.\n\nFor all his antics, Flav's role in Public Enemy was a deceptively brilliant one. The Roots' Questlove said it best when he placed \"Fight The Power\" at No. 8 on his Top 50 Hip-Hop Songs Of All Time list.\n\n\"Flavor Flav's bats***\" crazy stance was used as bait (I fell for it) to attract the unaware. Once trapped inside, Chuck D's baptist preacher rapid-fire scream was the nail in the coffin. The best sweet and sour combo in hip-hop. Actually, the original contrary duo in hip-hop,\" wrote Quest.\n\n4. Sax Appeal\n\n\"I wanted to have a sax in the record but I didn't want it in a smooth, melodic fashion,\" producer Hank Shocklee of the Bomb Squad said, \"I wanted someone to play it almost like a weapon, and Branford [Marsalis] was the guy.\"\n\nIndeed, Marsalis wields his sax in a most unusual way on \"Fight The Power,\" thanks largely to Shocklee's inventive guidance.\n\n\"Hank did something that I'll never forget,\" said Marsalis. \"He made me do one funky solo, one jazz solo and one just completely avant-garde, free-jazz solo. And I said, 'Which one them are you going to use?' And he said, 'All three of them motherf***ers,' and he threw all three up. And the s*** was killer. You had this Wall of Sound come in and the saxophones came in, and it was a Wall of Sound to accompany a Wall of Sound.\"\n\n5. Not Their King\n\nPerhaps the most explosive and controversial moment in the entire song comes when Chuck D's denounces Elvis Presley. \"Elvis was a hero to most/But he never meant s*** to me you see,\" he snarls at the top of the third verse, before calling him a \"straight-up racist.\" Later, Chuck D clarified the intent of the lyric was not to directly attack Presley personally, but rather to point out the gross inequity in the way our culture picks its heroes.\n\n\"Elvis and John Wayne were the icons of America. And they kind of got head-and-shoulder treatment over everybody else,\" Chuck D said in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2014. \"It's not that Elvis was not a talented dude and incredible in his way, but I didn't like the way that he was talked about all the time, and the pioneers [of rock and roll], especially at that time, weren't talked about at all. When people said 'rock & roll' or 'the King,' it was all 'Elvis, Elvis, Elvis, one trillion fans can't be wrong' type of s***.\"\n\n6. What About John Wayne?\n\nLater on in the same verse Flavor Flav chimes in, addressing John Wayne with a similar detest as Presley. Evidently the intention of the lyric, while symbolic to a degree, was much more direct.\n\nIn that same 2014 interview, Chuck D said, \"But as far as 'motherf*** him and John Wayne' ... yeah, f*** John Wayne to this minute [laughs]. John Wayne is 'Mr. Kill All the Indians and Everybody Else Who's Not Full-Blooded American.' The lyric was assassinating [Presley's and Wayne's] iconic status so everybody doesn't feel that way.\"\n\n7. Bomb Squad Explosion\n\nNo anthem can be truly effective without being equal parts concept and feeling. For all its lyrical bombast, the hammer of \"Fight The Power\"'s message is swung by its beat. The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy's producer collective led by brothers Hank and Keith Shocklee, employed a myriad of samples, including Trouble Funk, the Dramatics and James Brown, and pushed the tempo 10 or so BPMs (beats per minute) faster than the common rap songs of the era, creating the perfect sonic vehicle for the song's social message.\n\nThe Bomb Squad's dense, meticulous and masterful production is further proof that all the right pieces must be in place for a song like \"Fight The Power\" to have a seismic, sustaining impact.\n\n\"Dream On\": 7 Facts About Aerosmith's Classic Song | GRAMMY Hall Of Fame\n\n\"That was the first time hip-hop was accepted in those walls,\" Hodge says sitting backstage at Red Rocks. It was also the first time Hodge composed orchestral accompaniments to a hip-hop album.\n\nSince then, Hodge has composed symphonic works for other rappers including Jeezy and Common, and is set to deliver a symphonic rendition of Anderson .Paak's 2016 album, Malibu, at the Hollywood Bowl in September.\n\nHodge's passion for orchestral composition began when he was very young. He played upright bass by age seven and continued to practice classical composition in his spare moments while touring as a bassist with Terence Blanchard and Robert Glasper. On planes. In dressing rooms. In the van to and from the gig.\n\n\"It started as a dream. I didn't know how it was going to be realized. My only way to pursue that dream was just to do it without an opportunity in sight,\" Hodge says. \"Who would've known that all that time people were watching? Friends were watching and word-of-mouth.\"\n\nHis dedication and word-of-mouth reputation eventually led Nas to entrust him with the orchestral arrangements for Illmatic. He asked Hodge and another arranger, Tim Davies, to write for the performance at the Kennedy Center.\n\n\"[Nas] didn't know much about me at all,\" Hodge says. \"For him to trust how I was going to paint that story for an album that is very important to him and important to the culture, I have not taken that for granted.\"\n\nRead more: How 'Illmatic' Defined East Coast Rap: Nas’ Landmark Debut Turns 30\n\nThose parts Hodge wrote for the Kennedy Center are the same parts he conducted at Red Rocks. Over a decade later, he channels the same drive and hunger he had when he was practicing his compositions between gigs. \"I hope that I never let go of that. I feel like these opportunities keep coming because I'm approaching each one with that conviction. Like this could be my last.\"\n\nBefore this latest performance, GRAMMY.com spoke with Hodge about bridging the worlds of classical and hip-hop, influencing the next generation of classical musicians, and how his experience as a bassist helps him lead an orchestra.\n\nThroughout history, orchestral music has been celebrated by the highest echelons of society, whereas hip-hop has often been shunned by that echelon. What is it like for you to bring those two worlds together?\n\nI love it. I've embraced the opportunity since day one. I was a young man showing up with Timberlands on and cornrows in my hair, and I knew the tendency to act and move in a certain perception was there. I knew then I have to represent hope in everything I do. I choose to this day to walk with a certain pair of blinders on because I feel like it's necessary. Because of that I never worry about how the classical world perceives me.\n\nOftentimes I'll stand before them and I know there may be questions but the love I show them, what I demand of them, and how I show appreciation when they take the music seriously…almost every situation has led to lifelong friendships.\n\nI believe that's been part of my purpose. It's not even been to change minds or change perceptions. In serving the moment, even when people have preconceptions, they're in front of me playing music I wrote. How do I serve them best? How do I bring out the best in them just like I'm trying to bring out the best in the storyline of a hip-hop artist that may not relate to their story at all? The answer is just to be selfless. That's eliminated the distraction of trying to convince minds.\n\nWith that unifying principle, would you consider conducting the orchestra the same thing as playing bass with Robert Glasper?\n\nThe way I try to be selfless and serve the moment, it's no different. Maybe the skillset that's required. For example, conducting or working within a framework of composed music requires a certain way of making sure everybody's on the same page so we can get through these things on time and keep going. But I serve that moment no differently than when myself and Robert Glasper, Chris Dave, Casey Benjamin RIP, are creating a song in the moment.\n\nI actually don't even think about how one thing is affecting the other. I will say the beauty of the bass and the bassists that have influenced me — from Ron Carter to the great Marcus Miller, Victor Wooten — is the way they can stand out while never abandoning the emotion of the moment. Remembering what is perceived as the role of the bass and how it glues things in a unique way. Harmonically and rhythmically. Being aware of the responsibility of being aware of everything.\n\nI think that's one thing that's carried over to orchestrating and thinking about balances and how to convey emotion. I think some things are innate with bassists. We're always navigating through harmony and having a conversation through a lens of placement with drums. Placement with the diction if they're singers or rappers. There are a lot of decisions bass players are making in the moment that we don't even think about. It's just secondhand. But it's how are we serving what's necessary to make the conversation unified. I think that's one thing that's served me well in composition.\n\nWhat's one song you're particularly excited to dive into for the Anderson .Paak arrangements?\n\nSo I'm intentionally not thinking in that way because we decided to treat it like a movie. Start to finish no matter what. With that in mind, I'm trying to approach it as if the whole thing is an arcing story because I didn't realize the succession of how he placed that record was really important to him.\n\n**Hip-hop is often a very minimalist genre while an orchestra is frequently the opposite with dozens of instruments. How do you maintain that minimalist feel when writing orchestra parts for hip-hop albums like Illmatic?**\n\nI'm so glad you asked that because that was the biggest overarching thing I had to deal with on the first one. With Nas. Because Illmatic, people love that as it is. Every little thing. It wasn't just the production. Nas's diction in between it, how he wrote it, how he told the story, and the pace he spoke through it. That's what made it. So the biggest thing is how do I honor that but also try to tell the story that honors the narrative of symphonic works? [The orchestra is] fully involved. How do I do things in a way where they are engaged without forcing them?\n\nIllmatic was a part of my soundtrack. So I started with the song that meant the most to me at that time: \"The World is Yours.\" That was the first piece I finished, and I emailed Pete Rock and asked \"How is this feeling to you?\" If the spirit of the song is speaking to him then I feel like this is something I can give to the people no matter how I feel about it. And he gave the thumbs up.\n\nSo instead of overly trying to prove a point within the flow of the lyrics, how do we pick those moments when the orchestra is exposed? Let them be fully exposed. Let them tell a story leading into that. Make what they do best marry well into what Nas and the spirit of hip-hop and hip-hop sampling do best. And then let there be a dance in between.\n\nThat first [Illmatic] show was a great experiment for me. I try to carve out moments whenever I can. Let me figure out what's a story that can combine this moment with this moment. That's become the beauty. Especially within the rap genre. To let something new that they're not familiar with lead into this story.\n\nJay-Z has made more critically beloved albums than Vol. 2 (Reasonable Doubt and The Blueprint both fall in that category). He has made albums with bigger hits (The Blueprint 3 had a No. 1 hit with \"Empire State of Mind\"). But he has never made a more important LP.\n\nVol. 2 was the album that made Jay a superstar. Its Annie-sampling title track (produced by the late 45 King) sent him to the stratosphere — a process he actually documented on his follow-up album. But the record wasn’t just a commercial novelty. It showed Jay at the absolute top of his game: cocky, funny, and brilliant. Case in point: his novel approach to storytelling in \"Coming of Age (Da Sequel),\" where all the important action takes place in just a few seconds, inside the characters’ heads.\n\nRead more: Songbook: How Jay-Z Created The 'Blueprint' For Rap's Greatest Of All Time\n\nLudacris - 'Word of Mouf' (2001)\n\nAround the turn of the millennium, Def Jam had its sights set on conquering new territory. Specifically, the South. So they set up Def Jam South and hired Scarface to head it up. The entity’s biggest success came from an Atlanta DJ who went by Chris Luva Luva on the air, but began rapping as Ludacris.\n\nWord of Mouf was Luda’s second album, but it was the one that really cemented his stardom with songs like \"Rollout (My Business),\" \"Area Codes,\" and the immortal \"Move Bitch\" (the last of which has had an artist-approved second life as a protest chant). The album proved that the South was here to stay, and that Def Jam would have a role in determining its hip-hop future.\n\nLearn more: A Guide To Southern Hip-Hop: Definitive Releases, Artists & Subgenres From The Dirty South\n\nScarface - 'The Fix' (2002)\n\nSpeaking of Scarface and Def Jam South, Face had no intention of dropping music while running the label. But, in his telling, Def Jam exec Lyor Cohen insisted on it, paying handsomely for the privilege.\n\n\"There were so many things working in my favor on that album,\" Scarface wrote in his memoir Diary of a Madman. \"For the first time, I was working on an album for a label that believed in me 100 percent and didn’t want anything from me except for me to make the dopest album I could possibly make. And they went out of their way to make that possible.\"\n\nDef Jam’s history of putting out classics inspired Face on The Fix, he writes in that book. And in the end, the album stands up there with any of them. It is one of only a small handful of rap records to earn a perfect five-mic rating from The Source, and it belongs in that rarified air with projects like Illmatic and Aquemini.\n\nKanye West - 'The College Dropout' (2004)\n\nYes, today Kanye West is the worst: a Hitler-loving, Trump-supporting, paranoid, antichoice, antisemite who stands accused of sexual harrassment. But two decades ago, the world met a Mr. West who at least seemed very different.\n\nThe College Dropout presented an artist who was already extremely well-known as a beatmaker. But Kanye’s carefully crafted persona as the bridge between mainstream rap and the underground — \"First n— with a Benz and a backpack,\" as he put it — meant that he appealed to pretty much everyone. The College Dropout wasn't West at the top of his rap game, but it did show his skill at developing song concepts, at beats, and at creating an artistic vision so powerful, and so relatable, that it captivated an entire generation."
