        "text": "Featuring Mudvayne and All That Remains\n\nTickets for the 33-city nationwide tour on-sale this Friday, April 26\n\nMegadeth is bringing its iconic live show to North America with a 33-city, nationwide tour, Destroy All Enemies, produced by Live Nation, this fall including stops in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston, St. Louis and many more. Tickets for all dates will be on sale Friday at 10am local time with an exclusive presale for the Cyber Army/Megadeth Digital beginning today, Tuesday, April 23 at 12pm local time Megadeth.com.\n\nBringing along Mudvayne and All That Remains, the tour begins in Rogers, Arkansas on August 2 and runs throughout the month before wrapping in Nashville, Tennessee on September 28. Performing classic hits from Rust In Peace, Countdown to Extinction and more, the tour also brings Dave Mustaine and bandmates back to North America to perform their latest studio album The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead! Featuring some of Mustaine’s strongest-ever songwriting, the tour offers an equally ambitious live performance that delivers on all fronts.\n\n“Our ‘Crush The World’ tour has been a tremendous experience for the four of us,” shared Dave Mustaine. “We are all playing tight, and that has made it possible for me to really focus on solos and singing, we are playing more songs than ever before, and we are closer to each other, onstage AND off. I’m excited to see Mudvayne, and All That Remains. Join us as we DESTROY ALL ENEMIES.”\n\nThe North American jaunt comes on the heels of a highly anticipated and successful stint in Latin America wrapping this month and starting back up in Europe this summer. With stops in Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and México and forthcoming dates in Sweden, Italy, France, Germany and more, the band’s global appeal and lasting impact is more apparent than ever as continued calls for international touring are demanded.\n\nMegadeth, alongside founder and frontman Dave Mustaine, are renowned for their unparalleled energy and mastery on stage. In 2023, the GRAMMY-Award winning band dominated arenas and festivals, reaffirming its status as one of heavy metal’s most formidable live acts. Dubbed “as ferocious and hard-hitting as ever” by AllMusic, Megadeth enjoyed sold-out shows and critical acclaim on the latest run of the Crush The World Tour captivating audiences and showcasing the latest and greatest hits.\n\nFor more information and to purchase tickets to the Destroy All Enemies Tour, visit www.megadeth.com.\n\nDestroy All Enemies U.S. Tour 2024\n\nAug 2 Rogers, AR Walmart AMP\n\nAug 3 Houston, TX 713 Music Hall\n\nAug 5 Albuquerque, NM Isleta Amphitheatre\n\nAug 6 Denver, CO Ball Arena\n\nAug 8 Phoenix, AZ Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre\n\nAug 9 Los Angeles, CA YouTube Theater\n\nAug 10 Concord, CA Toyota Pavilion at Concord\n\nAug 12 Auburn, WA White River Amphitheatre\n\nAug 13 Bend, OR Hayden Homes Amphitheater\n\nAug 16 Las Vegas, NV Bakkt Theatre at Planet Hollywood\n\nAug 17 Salt Lake City, UT Maverick Arena*\n\nAug 20 Irving, TX The Pavilion at Toyota Music Factory\n\nAug 21 Austin, TX Germania Insurance Amphitheater\n\nAug 23 Macon, GA Atrium Health Macon Amphitheater*\n\nAug 24 West Palm Beach, FL IThink Financial Amphitheatre\n\nSept 3 Tinley Park, IL Credit Union 1 Amphitheatre\n\nSept 5 Huntington, WV Marshall Health Network Arena*\n\nSept 6 Charlotte, NC PNC Music Pavilion\n\nSept 7 Raleigh, NC Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek\n\nSept 9 Reading, PA Santander Arena*\n\nSept 10 Albany, NY MVP Arena*\n\nSept 11 Boston, MA Leader Bank\n\nSept 13 Bethel, MY Bethel Woods Center For The Arts\n\nSept 14 Wantagh, NY Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater\n\nSept 15 Richmond, VA Virginia Credit Union Live!*\n\nSept 17 Cincinnati, OH Riverbend Music Center\n\nSept 18 Pittsburgh, PA Stage AE\n\nSept 20 Noblesville, IN Ruoff Music Center\n\nSept 21 Clarkston, MI Pine Knob Music Theatre\n\nSept 24 Minneapolis, MN The Armory\n\nSept 26 St Louis, MO Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre STL\n\nSept 27 Southaven, MS Bankplus Amphitheater at Snowden Grove*\n\nSept 28 Nashville, TN Nashville Municipal Auditorium\n\n*Non Live Nation Dates\n\nAbout Megadeth:\n\nWith a musical legacy spanning four decades, Megadeth has sold in excess of 50 million albums worldwide earning numerous accolades including 1 Grammy award with 13 nominations and five consecutive platinum albums.
