        "text": "For Chuck D, who rose to fame in the ’80s with Public Enemy and now is on tour with the rap-rock supergroup Prophets of Rage, writing his new book on the history of hip-hop was a serious labor of love.\n\n“When somebody says they love something it was my job to say, ‘If you love something, you should know about it,'” he said by phone from a fast-food drive-thru on his way to a Prophets of Rage rehearsal in Los Angeles recently. “Go beyond the urban mythology of it all, with somebody who is credible with the knowledge of it.\n\n“I was able to not just put a face onto this book to legitimize it,” Chuck D said. “I’ve been on the lecture circuit for 35 years. My topics have been rap, race, reality and technology.\n\n“And I’ve been very clear about telling people that if you say you love anything you’ve got to go beyond the hype.”\n\n“Chuck D Presents This Day in Rap and Hip-Hop History” arrived at booksellers earlier this month and is intended to tell the true history of the musical genre, from its birth on Aug. 11, 1973 – when DJ Kool Herc entertained a house party in the Bronx with his newfound ability to manipulate vinyl records — through all the significant moments in rap over the next four decades.\n\nAs the leader and lyricist of Public Enemy, Chuck D has long taken the world seriously, creating music that addressed topics from race and politics to social ills and economic injustice. When, in 2009 and 2010, several radio projects arose, including his online radio station Rapstation, he decided to start treating the history of rap with the same gravity, recruiting Montreal-based DJs and writers Duke Eatmon and Ron Maskell to contribute this week or this day in rap history segments to the broadcast.\n\n“The contributors to the book (Eatmon and Maskell), we had been clarifying and curating rap music and hip-hop as an art form on my radio shows,” Chuck D said of the decision to create the book.\n\nAdd to that recent events, such as the opening of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in 2016, the induction of Public Enemy into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013 and the ongoing misconceptions of what rap is and is not, and the time felt right, he says.\n\n“It was like, ‘How do we kind of reduce the urban myth of it all?'” Chuck D said. “Because you will have a lot of people who will believe all the lower things that came on the lower rings of the branch of the music.”\n\nHe is talking, he explained, about the ideas of some that rap isn’t “real music,” that it overly glorifies the negative aspects of life, that it’s not a force for the positive change that can make a society stronger.\n\n“I thought, ‘Wow, what limited narrative are you thinking of rap?'” Chuck D said. “It was just the right time for the book. It was the right time maybe 10 years ago for the book. I had seen other music history books that had come out and I thought, ‘Why not hip-hop and rap music?'”\n\nCreating a canon\n\n“Chuck D Presents This Day in Rap and Hip-Hop Music” is organized chronologically with more entries after the first few years when the music started to grow at an exponentially faster rate. Hip-hop-influenced visual artists including Askem, Scared of Monsters and the Los Angeles-based street artist Shepard Fairey, who also writes the foreword, illustrate the book, which Chuck D is quick to point out is based on facts, but also told from the point of view of someone who has lived and worked in the world of hip-hop for most of its existence.\n\n“Whenever an art form falls into the hands of the corporations instead of the curators and contributors there’s got to be somebody who says, ‘Uh uh, no, no, no, no,'” he said. “The acknowledgment of the legitimacy of the art has always been kind of overlooked. And I think the coverage of the art form might not be as organic and honest as the art itself.”\n\nChuck D hopes that hip-hop will eventually have the same canon of accepted wisdom across multiple generations that rock and roll history does.\n\n“Somebody from the rock and roll idiom knows there’s some standards that have to be upheld,” he says. “And some journalist can’t just come out of left field and call it what they want to call it. The same thing in rap and hip-hop, but the body of people to make sure the walls are respected is not there yet. We don’t have those gatekeepers that I hope we have in five to 10 years.”\n\nContinuing to Rage\n\nThe group Prophets of Rage takes its name from the song of the same name on Public Enemy’s 1988 album “It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.” In addition to Chuck D and DJ Lord from Public Enemy it includes rapper B-Real from Cypress Hill and Tom Morello, Tim Commerford and Brad Wilk from the more rock-oriented groups Rage Against The Machine and Audioslave.\n\nThat kind of rock-rap collaboration is typical of music today, and has led to Prophets of Rage being booked for upcoming Southern California dates as diverse as the mostly metal Ozzfest in Devore on Saturday, Nov. 4, and the annual alternative KROQ holiday show Almost Acoustic Christmas at the Forum in Inglewood on Dec. 9.\n\n“The only ones that don’t understand that are the old business heads,” Chuck D says. “There’s no rhyme or reason in their mind how Prophets of Rage could play to 2.6 million people before our first legitimate record. It’s not an easy thing to come up in the score card.\n\n“The no-brainer answer is, ‘Yeah, they’re bringing the catalogs and the fans of Cypress Hill, Public Enemy and Rage Against The Machine to an event,” he says. “But we found out this year that there’s a whole new being that probably was a fan of neither band, that might be 15 years old and think: ‘I’m going to take these OGs and this is going to be my group. Rage Against The Machine, Public Enemy and Cypress Hill were my dad’s groups. And taking that under their wing and run with with.\n\n“And that’s a little hard for a marketer to understand.”\n\nAfter the book gets launched and Prophets of Rage gets its run, he says he’s not sure what he wants to do next.\n\n“I go one year at a time, man, I’ve got a long list and I kind of cross them off when I can,” Chuck D says. “The only thing that is really in my vision is how can I be of service to the art form and all the artists so it can be easier for them.\n\n“My thing is about the respect of the total art form, front to back.”\n\n‘Chuck D Presents This Day in Rap and Hip-Hop History’\n\nAuthor: Chuck D\n\nInformation: Black Dog & Leventhal, 352 pages"
