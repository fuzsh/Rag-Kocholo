The Jerk is back.\n\nInsanely hot, confident, and very, very rich CEO Aiden Parker is still every bit the stud he was back in high school, when I was just the insignificant, awkward little sister of his best friend.\n\nHe teased me mercilessly and left my teenage heart trampled on the floor.\n\nBecause of course I had a massive crush on him.\n\nWho didn’t?\n\nHe was the Golden Boy back then, and as he struts through the front door of my bakery like he owns the place, I can see…Nothing’s changed.\n\nWell, nothing, that is, except his big city designer suit, so out of place in our little Texas hometown, a suit that okay, undeniably fits him in all the right places. He’s taller, broader than when I last saw him years ago, but those ash-blond locks falling rakishly over his burnt honey-colored eyes is still the same.\n\nHis biceps are bigger, and with a glance at his pants that hug him tighter in the front and the back, I can see that he’s all grown up too, and he's definitely been working out.\n\nMmm. What I wouldn’t give to…\n\nBROOKE!\n\nDamn, girl! Get ahold of yourself!\n\nFocus on the\n\nAiden’s back in town, grudgingly, from what I hear, to be the best man at my brother Sam's wedding.\n\nAnd I'm the Maid of Honor. So we'll have to work together...for now.\n\nAiden and Sam were always thick as thieves.\n\nWhich makes sense, because I can never, ever forgive Aiden for stealing my heart, and treating it like dirt.\n\nI hate him with the heat of a thousand El Paso summer suns for bullying me and teasing me about my feelings for him, about books being my only friends, and whatever other taunts his devilish mind could come up with.\n\nJoke’s on him now though, because he didn’t make it three steps inside my shop before locking his gaze with mine.\n\nHe looks me up and down, and I swear, Aiden Parker’s mouth is hanging open.\n\nI shake out my auburn locks until they spill, glossy and heavy down my back.Chin lifted, I give him a come hither smile.\n\nThat’s right, buddy - take it aaall in.\n\nI’m not the same deer in headlights, insecure girl he used to know.\n\nI’ve grown up, filled out, and I’m a woman now, which means I can see how badly he wants me.\n\nI can also tell that Aiden doesn’t recognize me at all, and as he closes his mouth and gets his game face back on, as he walks purposefully over to me to lay his best pickup line on me, all I can do is wait for my sweet revenge.\n\nI’m about to give Aiden Parker, the self-made gazillionaire who was just voted Texas’ Most Eligible Bachelor, a taste of his own medicine. Hell, I might just pour the whole bottle down his throat.\n\nBecause you know that old saying…don’t mess with Texas?\n\nWell - I’m a Texas gal through and through.\n\nI just hope this plan doesn’t backfire on me.\n\nBecause this is a dangerous game I’m about to play.\n\nHow can I get through my brother’s wedding and make Aiden sorry he ever met me - all without falling for his legendary charms?\n\nMy eyes narrow.\n\nAfter what this jerk did to me in high school…\n\nI’m sure going to try and find out.\n\nFrom rising author Hadley Stone comes a new enemies-to-lovers small town romance featuring never before seen characters that will have"
