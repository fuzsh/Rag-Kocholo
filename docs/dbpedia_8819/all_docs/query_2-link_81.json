        "text": "Two-party system still works\n\nI am writing in response to Bob Cushman’s letter in last week’s Northville Record.\n\nHe closed his letter, in which he generally labeled Democrats as being communists in disguise, by saying, “… if you vote on the Democratic Party side of the ballot, you are an enemy to the principles upon which our great country was founded.\"\n\nI take extreme exception with just about everything he says, but especially with his closing remarks. I am a Democrat, and I do a lot of voting on that side of the ballot these days, but I began my political life as a registered Republican. I changed my registration not so much because my political beliefs changed, but rather because the Republican Party changed. The basic principles and underlying goodness of Republicans of the cloth of Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower began to evaporate in the age of Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay. The Republican Party was no longer my party.\n\nI do not hate the Republican Party, nor do I hate the members of it, nor do I consider them to be the enemy of anything American. They are no longer my party, but I recognize that our entire system of government requires a healthy two-party system, and to damn one of the parties as being an enemy of the country is to damn the political system on which our country is based. Those who would damn this system are the true enemies of “the principles upon which our great country was founded.\"\n\nJohn D. Webster\n\nNorthville\n\nNo fake news\n\nMy mistake, Mr. McLaughlin. My letter of March 2 mistakenly attributed a law, passed by the Republican congress, and signed by Donald Trump, with one of Trump's many silly executive orders. So worse than an executive order, H.J. Res. 40 makes it legal in law for around 75,000-plus mentally ill people to be able to purchase the firearm of their choice. These people whose mental issues are severe enough that they qualify for Social Security disability, or are deemed unfit to handle their own affairs, will no longer be part of the national background check database. No \"fake news\" here, but it was quite refreshing, Mr. McLaughlin, to see a Trump supporter in lock step with the ACLU.\n\nI also found it strange and puzzling that when my friend, Bob Breslin, wrote about the many wonderful friends he has made that have enriched his life, and came to this country as immigrants, you decided to go on a rant about illegal immigration, and felt the need to speculate on their immigration status. Bob Breslin's letter expressed the warmth and richness of his friendships with those he knows that have come here from other countries to contribute to our way of life. I'm quite sure you have nothing to fear from his friends.\n\nSteve Lawrence\n\nNorthville Township\n\nEnd gerrymandering\n\nThank you for your recent issue featuring immigration. I found the facts regarding refugees especially helpful. I was not familiar with the regulations regarding refugee immigration. I appreciate the balance in the supporting articles and the attempt to cover the issue from differing perspectives. Even though my parents were immigrants, I sometimes forget the challenges people face when relocating to a foreign country and was unaware of the refugee process.\n\nI would love to see the same level of coverage given to gerrymandering, a topic which is frequently misunderstood. Two weeks ago I attended a forum in East Lansing regarding gerrymandering. Four groups presented at the event: The League of Women Voters, Michigan Election Reform Alliance, American Civil Liberties Union and CountMIVote.\n\nGerrymandering is a non-partisan issue. Republicans and Democrats are guilty of carving out districts to guarantee their party's dominance. Politicians are said to pick their voters instead of voters picking their politicians. In Maryland, Democrats manipulated districts in their favor much like Republicans altered the maps in Michigan for their gain.\n\nPoliticians from opposing parties are often hesitant to voice their objection; instead, they lie in wait for the chance to rewrite the boundaries in their favor. Fair representation may be achieved through various methods, including appointing independent commissions or developing a proportional representation system. Carving up districts to resemble salamanders is not a fair method. I admit I am a Democrat who wants this nonsense to end in Michigan, but I want the same for Maryland. All states should aim for fair representation. I encourage you to contact the organizations I mentioned (LWV, MERA, ACLU, and CountMIVote) to explore this topic.\n\nThank you again for making the editorial decision to educate and inform your readership instead of contributing to the sound bite rhetoric which fills social media. I wouldn't mind seeing issues devoted to campaign financing/election reform in Michigan and charter schools/vouchers.\n\nNancy Czech\n\nHighland\n\nNew immigrants should assimilate\n\nThe legal immigrants coming into this country today are different from the immigrants coming here 100 years ago. A 100 years ago, the immigrants wanted to build a \"new\" and better life here in America. They were driven to learn our language, work hard to get ahead and helped to form our society as it is today.\n\nThe immigrants coming in today reflect the sign that the young man is holding up. \"I'm Muslim & American, # Deal with it.\" I agree with Terry Olexsy when he says that the legal immigrants need to learn English and assimilate into our society, instead of creating a small homeland of their own within this country and expecting us to change and accept this. And any legal immigrant coming here, if they want to belong here, should be making an effort to assimilate instead of demonstrate. This young man will have to \"deal with it.\"\n\nCarol Maynard\n\nNorthville\n\nTrott at it again\n\nDave Trott's weekly Sunday love letter to constituents had Congressman Trott making the wildly exaggerated claim that government regulations \"impose a burden of $1.89 trillion on the economy each and every year.\" As usual his claim is not sourced and of course does not take into account any monetary savings that regulations generate , like protecting personal life savings and retirement accounts or positive externalities like the millions of lives regulations have saved or the millions of jobs that owe their existence to regulations. Studies abound that find that the many businesses engaged in responding to regulation create as many or more jobs than they destroy.\n\nTrott goes on to brag about three bills he supported that would reduce regulation and likely endanger the health, welfare and finances of citizens by removing consumer protections now enjoyed and by permiting polluters to pollute and pillagers to pillage. Unfortunately Trott would have us all believe that businesses would never do anything that would cause loss or injury to consumers. Not surprising since Trott's family fortune was born out of deregualation of the mortgage industry coupled with lax enforcement of then existing consumer protections.\n\nRecently in the Republican war on regulation that Trott actively supports, we saw The Clean Water rule, which prevented the dumping of toxic substances and animal excrements into tributary streams eliminated, a rule that had prevented Social Security disability recipients judged incapable of conducting personal affairs due to mental impairment or illness from purchasing guns abolished and a fiduciary rule that would require financial advisers while handling retirement accounts to operate in their client's best interests instead of their own blocked. Shamefully, \"puppy mills\" were even deregulated. Considering the ridiculous GOP proposal that would arbitrarily require two existing regulations be abolished for each new one enacted, it seems as though Trott and his Republican colleagues are bent on making Americans poorer, dumber and sicker and the 1 percent richer through deregulation.\n\nMitch Smith\n\nCanton\n\nA breath of fresh air\n\nAfter President’s Trump’s visionary, optimistic and forward-looking speech to Congress on Tuesday night, you could just feel the nation’s spirit being lifted.\n\nPresident Trump outlined a comprehensive plan that would restore our nation’s economy for everyone, rebuild our weakened military, secure our borders, and restore the respect and enforcement of our laws in order to keep our citizens safe and allow them to pursue their individual dreams.\n\nWhat a breath of fresh air, after eight years of the heavy government repression of the Obama administration. Remember, President Obama was the only president to serve eight years in our nation’s history — the only one — without even one year of 3 percent GDP growth. The nightmare of crushing government regulations and endless intrusion by the Obama administration into our daily lives is finally over!\n\nPresident Trump repeatedly reached across the aisle to the Democrats during this speech. Unfortunately, based on the sour looks on the faces of the Democrat leaders, they did not seem very interested – despite their previously professed concerns for many of these same issues.\n\nAccording to a recent nationwide Rasmussen poll, 45 percent of U. S. voters now think that the U.S. is headed in the right direction – one of the highest readings in over 12 years of regular polling and up dramatically from the 13 percent back in October of 2013 under the prior administration.\n\nIf we work together as a nation to implement the blueprint that President Trump outlined in this speech, our future will be bright indeed!"
