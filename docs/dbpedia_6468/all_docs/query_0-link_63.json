It should be noted, however, that some letters he sent to foreign political leaders that have not been released in Russia are available in foreign archives. Two such letters written by Stalin to China’s leader Chang Kaishek in 1939 and 1941 are reproduced here. Both come from Taiwan’s Historical Archive. His 1941 letter, written soon after the attack on Pearl Harbor, suggests that when the time came Stalin intended to fight against Japan in violation of the Soviet-Japanese Pact of Neutrality.\n\nKeywords: I.V.

The influence of the Mongol government on the process of the disappearance of the veche order in Russia: historiography oh the issue.........32\n\nHu Weiyang\n\npostgraduate student\n\nM.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University, History Faculty, the Department of Russian History until the early XIX century\n\n119192, RF, Moscow, 27/4, Prospect Lomonosovskiy\n\nE-mail: fantacticskill@qq.com\n\nThe article examines the views of scientists on the role of the Mongol government in the process of the disappearance of the veche order in Russia. Veche is one of the key institutions of the ancient Russian statehood. Veche acted as a city government body and had a number of fundamental rights, among which the right to call and expel the prince stands out. After the Mongol invasion, references in sources about the activities of the veche in Russian cities are less common. Mongol rule in Russia undoubtedly had a certain impact on the development of the Russian political system. To understand the complex processes of the formation of a centralized Russian state, it is important to determine the role of the Mongolian government in the development of Russian political institutions, incl. veche orders. The purpose of this work is to present the views of scientists on the influence of the Golden Horde on the process of liquidation of the veche in Russia. The article presents the most authoritative works of pre-revolutionary, Soviet and modern scientists, outlines the main concepts and formulates conclusions about the three main approaches of scientists to the role of Mongolian power in the disappearance of the veche. The study showed a lack of unity in understanding the influence of the Golden Horde on the process of liquidating the veche order in Russia.\n\nKeywords: The Golden Horde, Russia, veche, historiography, Mongol influence\n\nKirpichnikov I.A.

Ryazan service community in the historiographic conceptions of the Time of Troubles................................................................................39\n\nIVAN ALEXEYEVICH KIRPICHNIKOV\n\nPhD student, Lomonosov Moscow State University\n\nRussia, Moscow, Lomonosovsky 27-4\n\ne-mail: ivkirs@mail.ru\n\nThe author analyzes the key explanatory moves which help to include the Ryazan service community into the social conceptions of the Time of Troubles (1605-1613). The main part of actual ideas about the Ryazan service community at the beginning of the 17th century goes back to the classic monograph by S.F. Platonov, who had a significant impact on the entire subsequent historiography. The author analyzes the change in the view on the role of the Ryazan service community in the events of the crisis during the transition from the idea of «peasant war» (I.I.Smirnov, V.I. Koretsky) to the concept of «civil war» (V.D. Nazarov, A.P. Pavlov, R.G. Skrynnikov, B.N. Florya). It is stated that the main attention is paid to the figure of the P.P. Lyapunov, while the social history of the Ryazan gentry as a community of service people needs further special study.\n\nKeywords: Muscovy, Time of Troubles, provincial gentry, local administration, governor, Lyapunov, regionalism, local elite.\n\nShabelnikova N.A.

In connection with the interest in the study of the Far Eastern region as a zone of transcultural contact both in historical retrospect and at the present stage, the issues of studying the genesis of ethnic forms of organized crime and the history of countering them by society and the state are of particular relevance. The article draws attention to the fact that the Hunghuz operated in the north-east of China, Korea and Mongolia, as well as adjacent territories of Russia, such as the Far East in the second half of the XIX – early XX centuries. The largest number of gangs, according to research, was concentrated on the territory of the Amur region and Primorye. The article outlines the main directions of studying the problem and provides a brief description of them. It is concluded that there is a need for an in-depth study of the forms, methods and effectiveness of countering khunkhuznichestvo, a critical understanding of the available research, and an expansion of the source basis for the study of the problem.

At the «helm of power»: a political struggle British Whigs versus Tories in 1705-1715..............................................................................59\n\nMARINA IBRAGIMOVNA ROMANOVA\n\nCandidate of Historical Sciences, Docent\n\nAssociate Professor at the Department of National and Universal history\n\nof Pacific National University\n\n680021, Russian Federation, Khabarovsk, Vladivostokskaya st. 67-26\n\nE-mail: maromanova@yandex.ru\n\nThis article is devoted to the complex and controversial period of the struggle of the British Whigs with the Tories for power during the reign of Queen Anne. This conflict, on the one hand, gave impetus to the process of liberalizing the Whig grouping (appeal for support to public opinion; the “Sunderland incident”, which raised the question of who should serve ministers: the crown or the parliamentary majority; the “Office Act”, which contributed to the formation of the concept of the prerogative of parliament in matters of government appointment). On the other hand, in the struggle for power, the Whigs used anti-liberal methods (favoritism; court intrigues; bribery; the adoption of the “Property Qualification Act”, which limited the number of bourgeois parliamentarians), and after gaining power, they began to move away from the main political slogan of whigism – the demand for parliamentary prerogative in favor of personal financial and career interests. This contradiction caused the first serious disagreements in the Whig grouping and marked the beginning of the split of Whigism into “conservative” and “radical” directions.\n\nKeywords: England of the XVIII century, Whigs, Tories, liberalism, parliament, royal prerogative, favoritism, Duke of Marlborough, Ch.Sunderland, R.

The British government and the military of the coalition army took the initiative. The need to build railway communications was associated with the poor condition of the cart roads on the Balaklava–Sevastopol line. The second reason was to deliver the food and shells in time to the combat positions of the besieged Sevastopol. The article uses the information and materials of the English historiography. The valuable facts about Turkey’s participation in the construction of the railway and the subsequent transaction for its acquisition were found in the Ottoman archives, which allow us to completely reconstruct the history of the English railway in the Crimea.\n\nKeywords: Crimean War, Sevastopol, Russian Empire, England, railway, Ottoman archives.\n\nVlasov N.A.

The problem of gratitude became topical issue in public opinion of both countries after the Congress of Berlin (1878) and remains quite a controversial point till present days. The analysis of Bismarck beliefs is based on the examination of wide set of his texts and reports including official correspondence, parliament speeches, and private conversations. This thorough research allows us not only reconstruct Bismarck views but also place them into the broader context of his outlooks and assess the sincereness of his words. The main conclusion of the present research is that Bismarck considered Russian-Prussian and Russian-German relations of XIX century as a sequence of “reciprocal favors” from both sides. But from his point of view neither party had reasonable grounds to expect special gratitude from its partner. In mutual support both sides pursued their own interests. Bismarck thought that accusations of German diplomacy after the Congress of Berlin were unjust and unreasonable; they were result of an inadequate apprehension from the side of Russian political elite and public opinion.\n\nKeywords: Otto von Bismarck, Russian-German Relations, Congress of Berlin, International cooperation, Gratitude\n\nZotova A.V., Wang Ren Zhi (St. Petersburg).

A feature of that time was the active establishment of direct contacts between the subjects of the Russian Federation and various regions of the People’s Republic of China. One of the convincing examples of such bilateral cooperation was the contacts of the Legislative Assembly of St. Petersburg with the largest industrial cities and regions of China. The St. Petersburg parliament skillfully uses legislative instruments to create a favorable investment climate in the metropolis. An example of this is the successfully developing multi-billion-dollar Baltic Pearl project, which illustrated the colossal potential of cooperation between St. Petersburg and Chinese business. Petersburg lawmakers strive to develop multilateral relations between St. Petersburg and the Chinese regions.\n\nKeywords.

Yaragskogo 75 st.\n\nmkhan@yandex.ru\n\nIf we proceed from the principles of causal analysis, then the period of the early Middle Ages, according to its internal logic of the dynamics of the general historical process, is a continuation of the era of late antiquity, and, like this, is very rich in events significant for Russian historiography. It was at this time that at first it was designated as a cultural and civilizational space, and then Kievan Russ was formed and reached its peak. At the same time, the states of the mountainous cluster of the western Caspian region become clearly visible. Together, the latter form a very intricate, mosaic-arranged cultural and civilizational world. At this stage, a multifaceted and continuous relationship is tied and progressively developed between the two designated parties. At the same time, we note that the latter begin to be traced back in the period when not Kievan Rus, but pre-Kievan Rus was present on the political map of the Central Eurasian region. However, as multiple facts indicate, these interrelationships, in a designated period of time, acted not as some completely independent, but dialectically the opposite, as a phenomenon that depended in its origin on more global historical processes. Note that a somewhat detailed review of Russian-Dagestan relations in the pre-Kiev period is possible only with the fullest possible reading of the context of international contradictions that filled both the Caspian and Central Eurasian regions at that time.\n\nKeywords: Eurasia, Dagestan, Kievan Russ, Arab Caliphate, Byzantine Empire, Khazar Kaganate, Frankish State, Western Caspian Territory, military-political interaction\n\nIvanova E.E.

Analysis of written sources has shown its continuity in relation to the pre-Mongol ceremony. The presence of the khan’s ambassador at the enthronement was not obligatory. In order to enhance the solemnity and sacralization of what is happening, as well as to ensure greater publicity, they tried to time the date of enthronement with a church holiday. Earlier it was assumed that the prayer “Bless the king and prince” was read at the ceremony in the temple. Recent studies have shown that it could not be read at the enthronement earlier than the 90s. XIV century. The author supports the opinion that the set of objects repeated in the spiritual charters of the Grand Dukes could be used at the ceremony as coronation insignia.\n\nKeywords: ceremony, enthronement, the great Vladimir prince, khan’s ambassador, prayer, insignia.\n\nGrivastova A.N.

The main areas of study of the problem in modern research are outlined. A general description of the activities of state security agencies and Far Eastern EPRON’s personnel in the field of production activities, personnel support, as well as sending confidential correspondence is given. Attention is drawn to the fact that EPRON’s specialists had to operate in conditions of huge length of the maritime borders of the Pacific and North coasts of the USSR, significant demand for submarine specialists, and insufficient material and technical equipment. The author concludes that the results of the interaction of the Pacific expedition of EPRON with state security agencies significantly contributed to strengthening the strategic positions of the Soviet state, improving the safety of navigation on the Far Eastern borders of Russia, and also laid the foundations for the subsequent development of emergency rescue and ship raising in the region.\n\nKeywords: EPRON, Pacific Fleet, Pacific, Far East Basin, sea rescue service, special service, interaction, personnel.\n\nRuzaev S.V.

Personnel issues in the work of the Sevastopol city committee of the CPSU (b) in 1941-1942 .......................................................................156\n\nSTANISLAV VALER’EVICH RUZAEV\n\nDepartment of Modern History of Russia,\n\nInstitute of History, Saint Petersburg State University.\n\nRussian Federation, St. Petersburg, Mendeleevskaya linia, 5.\n\nE-mail: galeb2@yandex.ru\n\nThe article is devoted to the issues of staffing the party apparatus of Sevastopol in 1941-1942. Already on the eve of the defense of the city, an acute personnel shortage arose, which was due to mobilization, as well as evacuation to the Caucasus. In November-December 1941, there was a massive promotion of new workers to leadership positions, while, first of all, the personal qualities of people, their ability to work in extreme conditions, were taken into account.\n\nAn attempt to streamline the system of replenishing party cadres was undertaken in the winter and spring of 1942, when the front was stabilized near Sevastopol. At the meetings of the bureau of the city party committee, a large group of workers were approved, appointed to positions in the fall of 1941 and having proved their competence in the conditions of the first and second storming of the city. At the same time, the apparatus of the city committee and district committees was strengthened by the old workers who had arrived from the evacuation, while they were not always appointed to their previous positions. Through the efforts of the city party committee, as well as the operational group of the Crimean regional committee of the CPSU (b), party training was organized.\n\nBy the beginning of the third assault, the backbone of the party organization of Sevastopol, with the exception of the bureau, was made up of nominees of the wartime. It was they who became direct assistants to the secretary of the city committee, B. A. Borisov, who headed the work of city organizations in the context of the third assault. At the end of June 1942, a partial evacuation of the party activists was organized, however, these measures should be considered unsuccessful. A significant number of the city’s party workers remained in Sevastopol and completely shared the fate of its defenders.\n\nKeywords: defense of Sevastopol 1941-1942, party bodies, city committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks, personnel training, evacuation.\n\nSmagol O.S.

Bologna and Ferrara ...................................................................163\n\nOxana SERGEEVNA SMAGOL\n\nPhD student. Art history department, Faculty of History, Lomonosov Moscow State University\n\nLomonosovskii prospect, 27-4, GSP-1, 119991 Moscow, Russian Federation.\n\nE-mail: oksanassm@yahoo.com\n\nThe problem in focus is that of Renaissance symmetry in Emilia Romagna Quattrocento palaces’ facades, Bologna and Ferrara “palazzi” being chosen here as signal examples of Italian emilian secular architecture of the period in question. Taking into consideration Renaissance architectural treatises and basing on published contemporary technical investigations, the facades mentioned are interpreted in the context of Lombard and Venetian 15th century architecture, with the result that those of Bologna tend to present just a hint on symmetry, though clinging to Lombard palaces’ facades compositions, while those of Ferrara seem to have been more regular before deterioration and changes. And both are deeply rooted in local tradition.\n\nKeywords: Renaissance architecture, Quattrocento, Ferrara, Bologna, palazzo, Addizione Erculea\n\nVolkov A.S. (St. Petersburg). Excavations of L. K.

A nobleman by birth, who received a medical education in St. Petersburg, devoted himself to archaeology. In 1871, L. K. Ivanovsky, on the instructions of the Imperial Archaeological Society, conducted a trial excavation in the Novgorod province. Since 1872, until the death of the researcher in 1892, his life and activities are associated with the western part of the St. Petersburg province, the area of the Izhora upland.\n\nThe article is devoted to the archaeological excavations of the famous scientist Lev Konstantinovich Ivanovsky, conducted in the period from 1873 to 1891 on the territory of the Izhora plateau. The article deals with the entire period of archaeological research with the designation of the sites of excavations, the issue of further study of archaeological sites found by L. K.

Memory tourism as a pedagogical technology in France (on the example of the First World war).......................................................177\n\nYULIYA MIKHAILOVNA GALKINA\n\nTeaching Assistant,\n\nChair of modern and contemporary history\n\nUral Federal University\n\n620000, Russia, Yekaterinburg, Lenin Ave., 51\n\nE-mail: galkinskaya@gmail.com\n\nThe article discusses one of the areas of commemorative practices – memory tourism and the practice of using it as a teaching technology for modern French students. Memory tourism in recent decades became popular in many European countries. As for France, according to the Direction of the Centenary Mission of the Great War, France “had the sad privilege of becoming the main battleground of the First World War,”, therefore the 2014 anniversary stimulated the development of tourist routes associated with the sites of memory of the Great War. Despite the fact that “memory tourism” plays a significant role in the development of the local economies of France, recently its potential has been widely used in the field of education. Thus, the Directorate of Heritage, Memory and Archives, which is part of the French Ministry of Defense, initiated the development of “educational memory tourism”, creating tourist routes for pupils and students, encouraging the younger generation with educational trips and awards for their contribution to the digital equipment of tourist routes and museum expositions. The author comes to the conclusion that today an official, national-patriotic view of the events of the First World War dominates in the field of educational tourism, since there are virtually no alternative commemorations involving tourist routes.\n\nKeywords: First World War, France, historical policy, memory tourism, commemoration, war tourism.\n\nSoldatenko V.F.
