        "text": "T\n\nhe Law School remembers and honors the legacy of Lani Guinier, who taught here from 1988 and 1998 and passed away on Friday, January 7, 2022.\n\nWith heavy hearts, the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School joins others in legal academia and the profession as a whole in mourning the passing and honoring the remarkable legacy of Lani Guinier, a brilliant and influential scholar and lawyer.\n\nGuinier was a faculty member at the Law School for 10 years, from 1988 to 1998, and inspired students in our classrooms as she produced some of her most authoritative scholarship.\n\nDean Emeritus Colin Diver, who served as the dean of the Law School from 1989 to 1999, recalls Guinier’s unequivocal commitment to civil rights and racial justice.\n\n“During Lani’s 10-year tenure at Penn Law, Lani pushed the envelope in many important and constructive ways: advocating for alternative voting methods, such as cumulative voting, questioning the implicit expectations of law school faculty that female students behave like ‘gentlemen,’ or proposing alternative methods for evaluating and selecting applicants to the Law School,” Diver said. “As a scholar, teacher, and public intellectual, she made immense and lasting contributions.”\n\nCurrent Dean and Bernard G. Segal Professor of Law Ted Ruger emphasized the lasting impact of Guinier’s work, noting that “Professor Guinier’s work illuminated fundamental tensions and fractures in our democracy and suggested innovative reforms; her work is as relevant today as it was when first published.”\n\nPrior to joining the Law School faculty, Guinier began her lifelong career advancing civil rights in the Civil Rights Division of the Office of the Assistant Attorney General Drew S. Days. She then joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, where she led the voting rights project with adept litigatory tenacity, winning 31 out of the 32 cases she argued.\n\nSenior Adjunct Professor of Global Leadership and Associate Dean of International Affairs Rangita de Silva de Alwis remembers inviting Guinier to Washington, D.C., to speak on electoral reform and pluralism to a group of women parliamentarians from countries in democratic transition.\n\n“In that audience were two young parliamentarians, Naheed Farid from Afghanistan and Dr. Alma Lana from Kosovo. In a Pashtun-led legislative assembly, Naheed was an ethnic minority. In an Albanian-led parliament, Alma was an ethnic minority,” said de Silva de Alwis. “The U.S. government does not always understand the complexity of ethnic identity in the different communities it seeks to help, but Lani Guinier did. Even in her death, her work will continue to have impact on nations seeking to strengthen their democracies and in classrooms studying the nature of bias.”\n\nStudents in de Silva de Alwis’s “Women, Law, and Leadership” course study and discuss the lasting relevance of Guinier’s revolutionary scholarship.\n\n“I am so grateful that the class on ‘Women, Law and Leadership’ gave us, students, the opportunity to study Professor Guinier’s work and scholarship. Professor Lani Guinier’s work, particularly her groundbreaking scholarship, ‘Becoming Gentlemen: Women’s Experiences at One Ivy League Law School,’ paved the way for Black women like me to exist and feel seen in these legal spaces,” said President of the Black Law Students Association Simone Hunter-Hobson L’23. “Her scholarship’s commitment to centering women’s voices and experiences remained a focal point for my work in Professor de Silva de Alwis’s course and inspired me to think about how crucial it is to put Black women’s stories at the forefront of legal scholarship.”\n\nGuinier once referred to her commitment to civil rights — and voting rights in particular — as both her professional and spiritual work and authored six books, over 40 articles, and dozens of editorial pieces throughout her career. She also earned 11 honorary degrees and numerous awards for her uncompromising advocacy, including among them the NAACP Legal Defense Fund William H. Hastie Award in 1993; the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania’s 14th Annual Civil Liberties Award in 1995; and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law of the Boston Bar Association’s Leadership Award in 2002.\n\nGuinier’s influence on this institution and the legal profession was immense and touched many. As an ardent litigator, a dynamic advocate, and a trailblazing academic, Guinier was unafraid to stand firm behind the principles of democracy, equality, and equity that underpin the essence of what it means to fight for justice in America. As we remember her, we also reaffirm our commitment to those same principles and strive to honor her by prioritizing civil rights and racial justice within our classrooms and, more broadly, within the laws we work tirelessly to uphold and advance.\n\nLewis Beatty, Jr. L’49, a World War II veteran and a Media, Pennsylvania., attorney for nearly seven decades, died August 18. He was 96.\n\nMr. Beatty was born in Media and graduated from Swarthmore High School in 1942. He earned a civil engineering degree from Cornell University in 1945, earned the McMullen Scholarship, and entered the Navy V-12 program.\n\nAfter graduating, he served in the U.S. Navy’s Seabees in the Philippines through the end of World War II. He had been slated for the invasion of Japan, and he never doubted that the atomic bomb and subsequent surrender of Japan saved his life. Under the G.I. Bill, he attended and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1949, where he was elected class president.\n\nMr. Beatty practiced law in Media for 68 years and retired from Beatty Lincke law firm in 2017 at age 92. He was President of the Delaware County Bar Association in 1974 and was a 39-year member of the American College of Trust and Estates Counsel. He was President of the Board of Directors of Sunnycrest Farm for orphaned boys for 10 years.\n\nIn the 1950s, Mr. Beatty did legal work for the Elwyn Institute, and his payment was a big basket of apples. He remembered disappointment that his staff ate the apples before he could enjoy one. In the 1960s, he was school board Solicitor for Upper Darby, Glenolden and helped in the merger of Interboro School District. In 1996, he was voted Pro Bono Man of the Year by Delaware County Legal Assistance.\n\nMr. Beatty was Director and past Chairman of the Board of Delaware County Memorial Hospital; later Director and past Chairman of Crozer Keystone Health System. He was a longtime member, Trustee, Elder and Deacon of Swarthmore Presbyterian Church. He was a 60-year member of Rose Valley Folk, sang as a tenor for 50 years with the Valley Voices, and was a 24-year member of Media Rotary. Additionally, he enjoyed a 74-year family membership to Rolling Green Country Club and was a member of the Union League of Philadelphia for 53 years.\n\nHe loved his wife, family, and friends, and he loved spending time with them at their cabin in New Albany, Pennsylvania., where they could enjoy the quiet beauty of the Endless Mountains. He was remembered for his dry wit, and some of his favorite quips included, “Everything is coming up roses,” “Write if you get work, and hang by your thumbs,” “You’re too good to be true,” “Shazaam,” and ending with “Onward and upward.”\n\nMr. Beatty is survived by his wife of 71 years, Peggy; their four children Roy, Lewis III, Elizabeth, and David; seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.\n\nKenneth Syken L’52, a family man and former Philadelphia attorney, died May 25. He was 92.\n\nHe was born in South Philadelphia and maintained a residence in Ventnor, New Jersey. Mr.Syken was the oldest of three children. When he was four, his father died of leukemia. Mr. Syken later helped his family by selling newspapers at 5th and Market streets. He attended South Philadelphia High School and Temple University and went on to become an editor of the law review at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nUpon graduation, he served in the Army and worked at the Judge Advocate General’s office in Frankfurt, Germany. In Philadelphia, he was a Partner in the firm of Richter, Syken & Ross.\n\nHe met Sandra Elner, also from South Philadelphia, at the Tamiment Resort in the Poconos. They married in 1962 and were by each other’s side for the next 59 years. They had two children, Marc and William, and moved to the suburb of Dresher, Pennsylvania, where they lived along with his mother Ida. On long summer weekends he enjoyed swimming in the ocean, setting up a beach chair, and holding court with family and friends, often ordering steak sandwiches from Sack O’ Subs for dinner. An early riser, he would go out in the morning and come home with a newspaper and Hershey bars for his sons.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Sandra; brother Lewis; sons Marc and William; grandchildren Nathan and Emily; and step-grandchildren Lucy and Phoebe.\n\nDean Cameron Frank Sr. L’54, former General Counsel for HH Robertson Corporation, died on Sept. 29. He was 92.\n\nOriginally from Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Mr. Frank spent the majority of his adult years in McCandless Township outside of Pittsburgh. Mr. Frank and his wife of 66 years, Patricia, recently had moved to a beautiful cottage at Passavant Retirement Community in Zelienople.\n\nMr. Frank was strong, smart, and hard working. He graduated from Bucknell University in 1951 and went on to the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Mr. Frank was an Army veteran and served in Germany following World War II. After marrying Patricia in 1955, they moved to the Pittsburgh area. He worked for many years as General Counsel for HH Robertson Corporation. He was a longtime active member of Northmont Presbyterian Church.\n\nMr. Frank loved to ski, hike, and read books about world history. He was very active with his four sons and his grandchildren and was fortunate to have a great-grandson.\n\nHis smile, laugh, and heartfelt hugs will be sorely missed by his family and friends.\n\nMr. Frank was preceded in death by his sister Lucy Frank-Lockhead. He is survived by his beloved wife Patricia; his sons Bill (Karen), Deane Jr. (Jana), Jim (Tracey), and Karl (Nancy); his grandchildren Wendell, Garrett, Chris (Natasha), Dennis, Bryn, Ryan, Vanessa, Natalie, and Allison, along with his great-grandson Oskar.\n\nJames “Jim” Muller L’56, who survived Nazi Germany as a child and later had a 60-year legal career, died Sept. 28. He was 90.\n\nAs a Jewish child in Nazi Germany, Mr. Muller knew persecution at a young age. On November 9, 1938 — Kristallnacht — he watched his synagogue get torched and his father arrested by the Gestapo. Soon after, he was chased by a noose-wielding gang of Hitler Youth. Only by the intervention of a kindly umbrella-wielding old man was he saved.\n\nAfter his father’s release from Buchenwald, the family escaped into Switzerland, where they spent more than two years looking for a country that would take them. They arrived in the United States on April 1, 1941, settling on a chicken farm in Atco, New Jersey.\n\nMr. Muller attended law school at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1956. At Penn, he met a bright, pretty undergraduate named Joan Dickman ED’56. They began to see each other and were married in June of 1957. Two sons, first David and then Eric, came along within the first five years of their marriage.\n\nMr. Muller practiced law in Camden, Haddonfield, and Cherry Hill for about 60 years. He was a stalwart of the Camden County Bar and respected across the decades for his intellect and his professionalism. He developed deep expertise in commercial law, bankruptcy, and real estate, and enjoyed finding creative ways not just to help clients solve their legal problems but also to help their businesses grow and thrive.\n\nA life that began with years of loss might not be expected to turn into one of generosity. Mr. Muller’s did. Whether working pro bono to help an Auschwitz survivor obtain reparations or devoting hundreds of volunteer hours to send 200 Cherry Hill High School East band students on a European adventure they’d never forget or making a bridge “loan” to a needy person with no intention of seeking repayment, Mr. Muller took no greater joy than in helping others. Knowing he’d helped was all the thanks he ever wanted.\n\nMr. Muller was preceded in death by his wife, parents, and sister Beatrice. He is survived by his sons; nieces Martha and Ruth; and grandchildren Abby, Daniel, Julia, Nina, and Benjamin. Words cannot capture the pride he took in their accomplishments or the joy he derived from their uniqueness.\n\nDonn Slonim W’53, L’56, a longtime New Jersey tax lawyer, died July 14.

He also enjoyed hiking, kayaking, bridge and singing. After moving to Narragansett, Rhode Island, he belonged to two choruses, but did the bulk of his singing — favoring songs from the Great American Songbook — in the car. Mr. Slonim was known for his generosity. He volunteered at nursing homes, led hikes for the blind, and prepared taxes for the elderly. He was very kind and very funny.\n\nMr. Slonim was preceded in death by his brother Ralph.

Letters he wrote his wife about his experience there later became the basis for the 1988 film Mississippi Burning.\n\nLocally, he was affiliated with the United Political Action Committee of West Chester and worked to improve public education for minority students and established the ward system of voting to give minority voters access to voting. He was also a member of the board of directors of Cheyney University, the nation’s first historically black university.\n\nIn 1984, he joined the landmark class action case Halderman v.

In 1986, he received the Saul Tischler Family Law Section Award, and he won the Alfred C. Clapp Award for Excellence in Legal Education in 1996.\n\nHe also taught Family Law at Rutgers Law School in Camden, New Jersey, and served on several boards, committees, and subcommittees. Until his retirement five years ago, Mr. Hymerling was named “best lawyer,” “super lawyer,” “top attorney,” and “awesome attorney” by legal publications.\n\nMr. Hymerling married his wife Rosie in 1969, and the two enjoyed collecting various items, including stamps, old books, videos, and Flyers hockey memorabilia. The Inquirer ran a feature on their 500-piece art collection in 2012. The couple also sponsored groups including the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Symphony in C Orchestra, the Markeim Art Center, and the Garden State Discovery Museum. They were active at Temple Emanuel in Cherry Hill for more than 40 years.\n\nHe was remembered for his generosity, intellect, and tenacity.\n\nIn addition to his wife, Mr. Hymerling is survived by son Mark, three grandchildren, a sister, and other relatives.\n\nWilliam “Bill” Schilling C’66, L’69, PAR’03, Penn’s longtime Director of Student Financial Aid, died Dec. 9. He was 76.\n\nMr. Schilling was born in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Upper Darby High School in 1962 and attended the University of Pennsylvania as a Federal Work Study recipient, working part-time in the University’s laundry room and financial aid office while he earned his bachelor’s degree. Until his retirement in 2012 — and, indeed, for several years thereafter — Mr. Schilling never left Penn, having taken a job as a financial aid officer following his graduation from the University’s Law School; he would rise to the role of Director of Student Financial Aid in 1980 and remain in that position for more than 32 years.\n\nDuring his tenure at Penn, Mr. Schilling committed himself to making an Ivy League education possible for students of all backgrounds and means. He oversaw the manifold expansion of the University’s undergraduate financial aid program and pioneered a no-loan aid policy, ensuring that students in need receive only grants, not loans, in support of their education. He supplemented this work for educational equity in his volunteering with the College Board and the Mendenhall-Tyson Scholarship Foundation.\n\nBeyond his working life, Mr. Schilling was blessed with a beautiful bass voice and sang for years in his church choir and with the Wayne Oratorio Society. In 1976, he met and fell in love with Patricia Charlesworth (née Connelly), a nurse, while she cared for his father in a time of illness. The two were married in March 1978, in the living room of the house where he grew up and where they would go on to raise their children.\n\nIn 2018, with his children raising families of their own, Mr. Schilling formally adopted his eldest three children, the daughters and son of Pat’s previous marriage. Mr. Schilling lived a life of gentleness, generosity, humility, and faith. In his quiet way, he modeled an unwavering love and devotion to his children in his fierce love for their mother, and he radiated joy in his closeness with his grandchildren. His happiest days were spent in the simple joys of home: peaceful days spent in the company of his beloved wife, his loyal dog, and his loving children and grandchildren, who knew how deeply they, too, were loved by him.\n\nMr. Schilling is preceded in death by his brothers, Yates and Fred. He is survived by Pat, his beloved wife of 43 years; their children Amy, Donny, Gail, and William “Drew”; and grandchildren Benjamin, Jacob, Sara, Emily, Nathaniel, Katherine, and Kira. He was joyfully anticipating the birth of his first great-grandchild, expected in February 2022.\n\nCharles Morris C’63, L’72, a lawyer, banker, and prolific author, died Dec. 13. He was 82.\n\nMr. Morris was born in Oakland, California, and attended Mother of the Savior Seminary in Blackwood, New Jersey. He earned his bachelor’s degree in journalism from Penn in 1963 and then served as Director of the New Jersey Office of Economic Opportunity from 1965 to 1969.\n\nWhile he worked for New York City government — he was the assistant budget director and welfare programs director for Mayor John Lindsay — he earned his law degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1972. He then worked as Secretary of Social and Health Services in Washington State. He later served as Director of the Vera Institute of Justice in London.\n\nHis experience in welfare programs led him to write his first book in 1980, The Cost of Good Intentions: New York City and the Liberal Experiment, which explored the Lindsay administration’s welfare spending. It also critiqued government officials who knew the programs failed to solve underlying problems but continued them anyway.\n\nIn the book, Mr. Morris espoused some neoconservative ideas, but he never ascribed to such simplistic labels. While some of his economic ideas fell into the neoconservative camp, he also held that raising the minimum wage would not destroy jobs. Mr. Morris decried that the nation’s healthcare system benefited the richest Americans, and he said graduate schools of business have been wrong for decades to ignore the importance of manufacturing.\n\nMr. Morris shocked the country’s economists when he wrote The Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers and the Great Credit Crash in 2007. It was published in 2008 and uncannily predicted, in precise terms, the global economic recession of that year. The book won the Gerald Loeb Award for business reporting, and Mr. Morris also appeared in the Oscar-winning documentary about the economic crisis called Inside Job.\n\nMr. Morris was a regular contributor to the Los Angeles Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Atlantic Monthly. The self-taught economist penned 15 books, including A Rabble of Dead Money: The Great Crash and the Global Depression: 1929–1939 (2017); Comeback: America’s New Economic Boom (2013); The Sages: Warren Buffett, George Soros, Paul Volcker, and the Maelstrom of Markets (2009); The Surgeons: Life and Death in a Top Heart Center (2007); The Tycoons: How Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, and J.P. Morgan Invented the American Supereconomy (2005); and American Catholic: The Saints and Sinners Who Built America’s Most Powerful Church (1997).\n\nMr. Morris died the same day as his sister, Marianne. He is survived by his wife, Beverly; children Michael, Matthew and Kathleen; and four grandchildren.\n\nBernard Lee L’77, PAR’02, a nationally known real estate lawyer based in Philadelphia, died Nov. 7. He was 71.\n\nFollowing his graduation from the Law School in 1977, Mr. Lee joined the Real Estate department at Wolf Block and practiced there until 2009 when he, along with 54 other lawyers from Wolf Block, joined Cozen O’Connor.\n\nMr. Lee’s legal sophistication and business judgment guided many of Philadelphia’s most transformative projects over the last several decades, including the development and financing of the Pennsylvania Convention Center; the South Philadelphia Sports Complex; the City of Philadelphia police headquarters; and the start of the revival of Amtrak’s 30th Street Station area. He also led the development and financing of the Ritz Carlton (now Westin Hotel) at Liberty Place, Hilton Hotel at Penn’s Landing, and Hilton Hotel’s Waldorf Astoria line.\n\nIn his honor, Cozen O’Connor renamed its IL Diversity and Inclusion Fellowship to the Bernard Lee Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Scholars Program in recognition of his passion for mentoring young lawyers and developing a pipeline of diverse talent within the firm and the legal profession. The scholarship was also expanded, increasing the potential in scholarship funds to $15,000. The firm anticipates increasing the number of scholars.\n\nThe firm established the Cozen O’Connor 1L Diversity and Inclusion Fellowship in 2018 for students in their first year of law school with a demonstrated commitment to diversity and inclusion. Scholars participate in the firm’s summer associate program following their 1L year and a diversity & inclusion mentorship program.\n\nHe was remembered as a true gentleman of uncommon wisdom, grace, and humility and a trailblazer for his profession. As one of the longest-tenured African American attorneys of his generation to ascend to the highest ranks of the Am Law 100, he worked to pave the way for other diverse attorneys to follow in his footsteps. He was a former President of The Barristers’ Association of Philadelphia, a local affiliate of the National Bar Association (a national network of African American attorneys and judges); a longtime leader in the Real Estate Executive Council (a trade association for diverse real estate executives); and general counsel to the local chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi, an historically African American collegiate fraternity. For such service, he received numerous awards and recognitions, including the Women’s Division of the National Bar Association Renaissance Man Award and the Sadie Alexander Barristers’ Award.\n\nHe was beloved by colleagues as a mentor and friend to many and remembered for his hearty laugh and willingness to listen.\n\nMr. Lee is survived by his wife Kathy C’77 and children Michelle C’02 and Michael, both of whom followed in their father’s footsteps to become Philadelphia lawyers.\n\nFrederick “Rick” Rohn L’77, a partner at Holland & Knight, died August 9. He was 69.\n\nAfter graduating from Colgate University and the University of Pennsylvania Law School, Mr. Rohn began his legal career at White & Case. He moved on to Sacks Montgomery, where he specialized in construction matters. At the time of his death, he was a Partner in the law firm of Holland & Knight’s New York office.\n\nMr. Rohn also had a gratifying second career as an adjunct professor at Cardozo Law School, where he taught a course on drafting contracts and was able to share his knowledge and mentor future lawyers.\n\nHe loved his family and friends, sailing, theater, and keeping up with every type and style of new music.\n\nMr. Rohn is survived by his wife of almost 41 years, Frances; sons Michael and David; grandchildren Benjamin and Norah; siblings Kathleen, Douglas, and Barbara, as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and other extended family.\n\nThe Honorable Ruben Martino L’82, a family man and New York Housing and Family Court judge, died Dec. 11, 2020. He was 64.\n\nJudge Martino was born and raised in the Bronx, and he graduated from Bronx High School of Science, Yale University, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He began his career as a staff attorney for Bronx Legal Services. He then worked his way to becoming the senior supervising attorney. In 1994, Judge Martino was appointed to the Housing Court and later appointed to the Family Court by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He passionately worked and practiced law for 38 years.\n\nIn 1983, he married the love of his life, Joyce Cortez. They raised three children, Ruben Anthony, Eric, and Yesenia. He was a family man who cared deeply about helping others above himself. When he wasn’t working, he was helping his kids with homework, driving them to piano practice, or picking them up from a friend’s house. He would keep in touch with his friends and was gifted at maintaining healthy relationships. He would visit his uncle William regularly on the weekends to provide him with food, fix his telephone, and spend quality time together. He was very kind, generous, and humble.\n\nJudge Martino was also incredibly passionate about playing basketball, painting, salsa dancing, and reading. He and his wife took salsa dancing classes together and would dance at home anytime salsa music played on the radio. Every Friday after work, he would play his favorite sport, basketball, with coworkers. He always cherished spending time with people around him.

She exemplified Penn’s core values of professionalism, excellence, and integrity that, despite having many options following her graduation, she remained on campus as a professional at the Annenberg School.\n\nShe was remembered as a joyful and witty student in the ML Program, extolling the great wonders of learning at the law school. She found it exhilarating and fun, often expressing disbelief in her great fortune in finding the ML Program and the many friends she made there.\n\nMs. Goldschmidt worked in various roles throughout Penn. She most recently served as the Annenberg School of Communications’ Associate Director of Finance, a job she described as perfect, with colleagues she respected and admired and who loved and respected her, too.\n\n“Marley was not only an incredibly intelligent and skilled employee, she was a dear friend to so many of us, and what we will miss most,” said Patty Lindner, Annenberg’s Executive Director of Finance & Facility Operations.\n\nMs. Goldschmidt was born in Bryn Mawr Hospital on June 10, 1991.
