        "text": "Using Your UGPA and LSAT Score to Predict Likelihood of Admission to Law School\n\nResults for the UGPA/LSAT search are computed using a proprietary logistic regression model employing fall 2021 full-time application and admission data as reported by all ABA-approved law schools. The results presented represent approximately a 95 percent probability that an applicant to a particular school for fall 2021 would have had the stated percentage likelihood of admission. Logistic regression assumes certain statistical patterns in the data and may slightly over- or under-represent the actual probability of admission of an applicant to that year’s class if those patterns were not uniformly present. For instance, this model might overestimate the probability for admittance for applicants just under the lowest score that a school accepted in 2021, and it might underestimate the probability for admittance for applicants just above that score. For more details on acceptance ranges at each school, please review the school’s full Official Guide page.\n\nPlease keep the following in mind when reviewing the likelihood of admission figures:\n\nAll likelihood of admission percentages reflect admission data for the fall 2021 full-time entering class. This data may or may not reflect current admission probabilities at a given law school.\n\nIn the reporting of the data by the law schools, the highest LSAT score was used for candidates who had multiple scores.\n\nLaw school decision-makers consider many factors in the admission process other than undergraduate GPA and LSAT score, including letters of recommendation, work experience, personal statements, extracurricular and civic activities, life experiences, breadth of undergraduate curriculum, and many others. Learn more about how law schools make admission decisions.\n\nMost applicants apply to a number of law schools based on a range of admission possibilities and other criteria. This search is designed to help you identify a number of schools, based on overlapping ranges. To research schools more in-depth, use the links provided to visit each law school’s full Official Guide page."
