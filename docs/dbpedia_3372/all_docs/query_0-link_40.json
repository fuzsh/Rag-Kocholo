        "text": "Harvard possesses one of the longest and proudest traditions in college football. From the program's founding days in 1874, through seven National Championships, and now in the days of the prestigious Ivy League, Harvard has been a leader in the sport. Here is a look at some of the memorable events in Crimson football history:\n\nPhoto Gallery of Harvard Football Traditions\n\nPhoto Gallery of Harvard Football Pregame Tailgates\n\nPhoto Gallery of the Harvard-Yale Rivalry\n\nMay 14, 1874\n\n-Football is born in Cambridge as Harvard accepts a proposal from McGill University for a two-game series at Jarvis Field. Harvard wins the opener, 3 goals to 0. The schools battle to a 0-0 draw the following afternoon.\n\nJune 4, 1875-Harvard plays its first-ever intercollegiate game, facing Tufts. Just as historic is that the Crimson is outfitted in a football uniform, believed to be the first time a team has been so identified. The squad is adorned in the school colors, with a uniform of white shirts and pants, with crimson trimming and crimson hose.\n\nNovember 13, 1875-Harvard and Yale play for the first time. The Crimson wins this initial meeting, held at Hamilton Field in New Haven, with four goals and four touchdowns to no goals and no touchdowns for the Elis. A group of 150 Harvard faithful makes the journey on the evening train from Boston.\n\nOctober 31, 1881-Harvard plays the first East-West intersectional football game ever as it hosts Michigan at the South End Grounds in Boston. The Crimson takes a bite out of the Wolverines, 4-0, as part of a 6-1-1 season.\n\nJanuary 6, 1885-Believing that the sport had degenerated into \"modified mayhem\", the Athletic Committee presents a report to the Harvard faculty which bans football from campus that coming fall.\n\nNovember 3, 1886-Rule changes allow football to return to Harvard in 1886. The Crimson rolls to a 156-0 win over Exeter, its highest single-game total ever. Harvard will establish a national collegiate record for points, amassing 765 during its 12-2 campaign. The record stands to this day.\n\nMarch 14, 1889-Harvard holds what is believed to be the nation's first-ever spring football practice when team captain Arthur J. Cumnock leads the team in drills on Jarvis Field.\n\nNovember 22, 1890-Harvard captures its first of seven national championships! The Crimson finishes 11-0 and defeats Yale, 12-6, on the season's final day.\n\nNovember 30, 1893-William H. Lewis becomes Harvard's first black captain when he is elected for the honor prior to the Pennsylvania game. He replaces B. G. Waters, who was injured a week earlier against Yale. Lewis, enrolled in the Harvard Law School, held a similar post while attending Amherst in 1891. Lewis goes on to be elected to the Cambridge City Council as a Republican in 1899, is elected to the Legislature in 1901, and named Assistant United States Attorney for Boston in 1903. In 1910, Lewis is appointed by President Taft as Assistant Attorney-General of the United States.\n\nNovember 30, 1893-The first football scoreboard is used. The Harvard Athletic Association unveils this invention of Arthur Irwin, a Bostonian and a professional baseball player and manager, in the Crimson's 26-4 win over Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day.\n\nOctober 1, 1898-An 11-0 win over Williams starts the Crimson on a 32-game unbeaten streak (31-0-1) that continues until the final game of the 1900 campaign. Along the way, Harvard captures national titles in 1898 and 1899.\n\nOctober 31, 1903-Glenn S. \"Pop\" Warner, coach of the famed Carlisle Indians, introduces the hidden ball trick in a game against Harvard. The ploy is unleashed during the second half kickoff, and the resulting touchdown moves Carlisle ahead, 11-0. The Crimson delivers the Halloween day treat, however, winning 12-11.\n\nNovember 14, 1903-Harvard Stadium, the nation's first permanent concrete stadium for athletics, opens when Harvard faces Dartmouth.\n\nSeptember 29, 1906-Harvard plays its first game since the introduction of the forward pass. The rule change was necessitated by the increasingly brutal nature of football as a way to open up the game. The configuration of Harvard Stadium, with its stands close to the playing field, forced the rules committee to opt for this innovation rather than widen the field by 40 feet.\n\nNovember 7, 1908-The legendary Jim Thorpe and his Carlisle squad visit the Stadium. Thorpe is shut down and his squad blanked, 17-0, as part of Harvard's 9-0-1 season.\n\nNovember 20, 1909-Hamilton Fish, a two-time All-American in an era when only 11 players earned the distinction, completes his career at Harvard. The rugged 6-4, 200-pound tackle graduated cum laude in 1910 and rose to the rank of Major in the Fourth Division Infantry during World War I. From 1920 until 1946, he was elected to the United States Congress as a representative from New York.\n\nNovember 18, 1911-Harvard embarks on its school-record 33-game unbeaten streak with a 5-3 win over Dartmouth at the Stadium. The streak covers the entire 1912, 1913, and 1914 seasons and the first four games of 1915. The Crimson went 30-0-3 before Cornell finally put a halt to the streak with a 10-0 win on October 23, 1915.\n\nNovember 21, 1914-The great career of Charlie Brickley '15 comes to a conclusion with a 36-0 rout of Yale in New Haven. Hampered by an injury for part of the year, Brickley still adds one extra point to the cause. He remains the Crimson's all-time scoring leader with 215 points.\n\nNovember 25, 1916-Percy Haughton coaches his final game for the Crimson, as he and his entire staff enter the service for World War I. As head coach of the Crimson for nine years, Haughton posted an incredible 71-7-5 record. Harvard won three national titles in his tenure (1910, 1912, 1913).\n\nJanuary 1, 1920-Harvard wins the Rose Bowl and its last of seven National Championships. The Crimson finishes 9-0-1 by edging Oregon, 7-6, in the Tournament of Roses contest.\n\nOctober 31, 1925-Number one defeats number two as Harvard, the oldest college in America, tops William & Mary, the second-oldest, by a 14-7 count at The Stadium.\n\nNovember 22, 1930-Barry Wood '32 throws a pair of touchdown passes and plays the entire 60 minutes as Harvard finishes the season by blanking Yale, 13-0. In addition to being an All-American quarterback, Wood was a three-year letterwinner in hockey and baseball.\n\nOctober 30, 1937-Vernon Struck '38 sets a school single-game record by rushing for 233 yards in a 34-6 win at Princeton. The mark stands until 1991. He also scores a pair of touchdowns in the win.\n\nNovember 20, 1943-College football is again depleted because of war, but 45,000 fans turn out at the Stadium to see squads from Harvard and Boston College battle to a 6-6 draw. It is the first meeting between the schools in any athletic competition in 24 years.\n\nOctober 11, 1947-Chester Pierce '48, a standout tackle for the Crimson, becomes the first Black student-athlete to play against a white college in the South when Harvard meets the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.\n\nNovember 22, 1947-Ken O'Donnell makes his final of eight interceptions on the season to set a school record. The mark has only been equaled once, by Cecil Cox in 1985.\n\nOctober 30, 1948-Hal Moffie's school-record 89-yard punt return for a TD helps key a 20-13 Harvard win over Holy Cross at the Stadium.\n\nNovember 17, 1951-Tom Ossman rushes for five touchdowns, setting a school record in the Crimson's 34-21 win over Brown.\n\nOctober 11, 1952-Dick Clasby dashes for a 96-yard touchdown in the Crimson's 42-0 victory over Washington University of St. Louis, the longest run from scrimmage in school history.\n\nOctober 31, 1953-QB Carroll Lowenstein throws for a school-record five touchdowns as Harvard routs visiting Davidson, 42-6.\n\nNovember 20, 1954-Harvard wins its 500th game by tackling Yale, 13-9, at the Stadium.\n\nOctober 13, 1956-The Ivy League begins formal play in football as Harvard crushes Cornell, 32-7, in Ithaca.\n\nNovember 7, 1959-A 14-0 win at Princeton clinches the first winning season for head coach John Yovicsin. This begins a string of 10 straight winning years for the Harvard coach.\n\nNovember 25, 1961-Harvard earns its first share of the Ivy football title, finishing 6-1 in the League after topping Yale, 27-0. Columbia also claims a portion of the coveted crown.\n\nOctober 14, 1967-Place-kicker Tom Wynne opens the scoring against Columbia with a school-record 51-yard field goal. The kick helps inspire the Crimson to a 49-14 victory over the Lions.\n\nNovember 23, 1968-The fabled 29-29 \"win\" over Yale enables Harvard to preserve a perfect 8-0-1 season, the school's first undefeated campaign since 1920. Harvard tallies 16 points in the game's final 42 seconds to knot the score.\n\nNovember 17, 1973-Pat McInally '75 sets a\n\nHarvard record with 13 receptions, including a pair of touchdown grabs, in a 35-32 win against Brown.

Junior Mike Lynch '77 boots a 26-yard field goal in the final seconds to deliver the 10-7 victory over Yale at the Bowl.\n\nNovember 17, 1979-Harvard is the final obstacle to a perfect season for Yale, and spoils the Elis' bid with a 22-7 upset at the Bowl.

The Crimson averages better than 30 points per game and its dominating defense surrenders just four TDs in League play.

It marks the first triple-overtime game in Ivy League history and the first Harvard-Yale game to go to extra periods.\n\nNovember 11, 2006 —The Ivy League's most hallowed record falls by the wayside as Clifton Dawson breaks loose for a 55-yard run against Penn to surpass former Cornell great Ed Marinaro as the Ancient Eight's all-time rushing leader. Dawson runs for 119 yards against the Quakers to finish the game with 4,781 yards, bettering Marinaro's longstanding mark of 4,715. Dawson would finish his spectacular career with 4,841 rushing yards and 60 rushing touchdowns, both Ivy League records.\n\nSeptember 22, 2007—The first night football game at Harvard Stadium takes place in front of 18,898 fans. The Crimson scores the first touchdown under the lights on its opening drive, going 80 yards in eight plays with Liam O'Hagan connecting with Corey Mazza on a 21-yard scoring pass.

The Elis, looking for their first unblemished season in 47 years and first outright Ivy title in 26 years, enter the game ranked 11th and leading the nation in rushing offense and passing defense. Harvard limits them to just 66 rushing yards and 109 total yards and holds Yale QBs to only 43 yards on 22 attempts. Harvard QB Chris Pizzotti throws for 316 yards and four touchdowns as the Crimson hands Yale its worst loss to Harvard at the Bowl since 1914.\n\nNovember 22, 2008 - The Crimson won its 13th league championship. The Crimson became just the eighth team in Ivy history to win the title after losing the league opener. An undefeated non-conference schedule propelled the Crimson to a 9-1 mark with four players being selected All-America.\n\nNovember 21, 2009 —Harvard wins its fifth straight game at Yale Bowl by scoring two late touchdowns in a 14-10 thriller against first-year Yale coach Tom Williams. With Yale leading 10-0 late in the fourth, Harvard drove 76 yards in 1:50 on six plays to make it a 10-7 game. Yale got the ball back and converted a pair of first downs to move the ball to its own 37 as the clock crept inside the four-minute mark. Yale eventually found itself in fourth down with 22 yards to go from its 25 yard line at 2:40 on the clock. With the league's best punter in Tom Mante waiting to boot it down field, new Yale coach Tom Williams instead called an improbable reverse run on a fake punt. John Powers evaded a would-be tackler in the backfield and moved behind a wall of blockers along the left sideline but Collin Zych blew up a double team block and Anthony Spadafino stopped Powers seven yards shy, giving Harvard the ball at Yale's 40 yard line with 2:25 as a stunned Yale crowd looked on. It took Harvard just three plays to devastate the crowd again as Chris Lorditch cut across the middle of the field and then swiftly past two defenders up the seam as QB Collier Winters lofted a perfect pass over the inside coverage. Thirty two yards later, Harvard suddenly led 14-10 before linebacker Jon Takamura finished the victory with an interception.\n\nNovember, 2009 - Among The Nation's Best\n\nIn 2009, Harvard football put the finishing touches on a decade that saw Harvard post the second highest national winning percentage in the Football Championship Subdivision and seventh highest in all of Division I. Harvard's .768 winning percentage from 2000-09 trailed only Montana while FBS schools Texas, Boise State, Oklahoma, Ohio State and Florida were the only school sto finish shead of Tim Murphy's Crimson. Rounding out the national top 10 in the decade was LSU, USC and Appalachian State.\n\nDivision I Winning Percentage Football Championship Subdivision\n\nWinning Percentage\n\n(2000-2009) Division I (FBS & FCS)\n\nWinning Percentage\n\n(2000-2009) 1. Montana 120 24 .833 1. Texas 109 13 .893 2. Harvard 76 23 .768 2. Boise State 112 17 .868 3. Appalachian State 102 33 .756 3. Montana 120 24 .833 4. Northern Iowa 80 29 .734 4.

Appalachian State 102 33 .756\n\nNovember 12, 2011 - Number 14 and a First\n\nOn November 12, 2011, Harvard recorded its 14th Ivy League championship with a resounding 37-20 victory over Penn at The Stadium. Noteworthy in the accomplishment was that the Crimson clinched the outright championship in Week 9 of the season - a first in program history.\n\nNovember 23, 2013 - Seven in a Row\n\nPaul Stanton, Jr., scored four touchdowns, leading the Crimson to a 34-7 victory at the Yale Bowl, Harvard's seventh straight win over the Elis. Harvard's victory gave the Crimson a 9-1 record for the year, as the squad earned a share of the program's 15th Ivy League crown.\n\nNovember 22, 2014 - Perfection\n\nWith its 31-24 victory over Yale, the Crimson capped a perfect 10-0 season by winning the outright Ivy League title before a home crowd of 31,062 at Harvard Stadium. The Ivy crown was the 16th in program history and eighth under head coach Tim Murphy. Harvard also completed its 17th perfect season and first since 2004, while topping the Bulldogs for a program record eighth-straight season. Harvard also became the second Ivy League school to ever host ESPN's College GameDay as 1.9 million viewers watched the nation's preeminent college football preview show.\n\nNovember 7, 2015 - 22-Straight\n\nHarvard topped Columbia in New York on this date, giving the Crimson its 22nd-straight victory, tied for the third-longest win streak in program history.\n\nNovember 21, 2015 - Three-Peat\n\nBy downing Yale, 38-19, before more than 52,000 fans at the Yale Bowl, the Crimson captured its third-consecutive Ivy League title, marketing the first three-peat in program history. Harvard also extended its win streak over Yale to a program-record nine games and won its 15th-consecutive road game, also a school record.\n\nNovember 17, 2018 - Victory at Fenway\n\nIn its 135th playing of The Game, Harvard capped the season by defeating Yale. Senior quarterback, Tom Stewart, led the Crimson to a commanding 45-27 historic victory over the Bulldogs with three TD's and a combined 312 yards as the offense totaled 605 yards. Senior Zach Miller secured a Crimson victory with the game-ending interception.\n\nHarvard's Greatest Catches\n\nTwo of the greatest catches in Harvard football history helped deliver Ivy League championships to the Crimson.\n\nIn 1968, tight end Pete Varney caught a two-point conversion with no time left on the clock that completed Harvard's 16-point comeback in the final 42 seconds against Yale and gave the Crimson a 29-29 \"win.\" Both teams finished the season undefeated at 8-0-1.\n\nIn 2001, Carl Morris's thrilling 62-yard catch and run for a touchdown came during a showdown of unbeatens against Penn as the Crimson rallied from a 14-point deficit to win, 28-21. The victory was part of Harvard's 9-0 campaign, the first perfect season for the Crimson in 88 years."
