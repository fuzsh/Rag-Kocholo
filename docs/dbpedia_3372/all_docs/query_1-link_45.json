        "text": "Professor Redish received his AB with highest honors in political science from the University of Pennsylvania and his JD magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. After graduation, he served as law clerk to the Honorable J. Joseph Smith of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n\nThe First Amendment Encyclopedia states that Professor Redish is “one of the nation’s foremost authorities on constitutional law and the First Amendment.” He is the winner of the 2021 Daniel J. Meltzer Award, created in 2017 by the Association of American Law Schools and given once every three years to honor a scholar for path-breaking scholarship and excellence in teaching in the field of Federal Courts. Described in a review of his book, Judicial Independence and the American Constitution: A Democratic Paradox (Stanford; 2017), as “the foremost scholar and theorist of American judicial independence,” Professor Redish is the author or co-author of more than 100 articles and 17 books. Stanford University Press published his book, The Adversary First Amendment: Free Expression and the Foundations of American Democracy, in 2013, and his book, Wholesale Justice: Constitutional Democracy and the Problem of the Class Action Lawsuit, in 2009. In addition, he is one of the primary revisers of the multi-volume treatise, Moore’s Federal Practice.\n\nProfessor Redish has been consistently ranked among the 25 most-cited legal scholars of all time in studies conducted by William S. Hein & Company. He was included in a list of the top 20 legal scholars for impact on judicial decision making in a 2016 study conducted by St. Thomas University Law School. His scholarship has been quoted or cited in 22 Supreme Court opinions. He has also been consistently recognized by the Institute for Scientific Information for being among the most highly-cited researchers worldwide. He has authored op-eds in both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn 2012, Professor Redish was honored by the law school with a Festschrift, a conference honoring his scholarly accomplishments. A special issue of the Northwestern Law Review was devoted to scholarly articles about his writings. In 2016, the law school honored Professor Redish with a conference to commemorate the 45th anniversary of his very first scholarly article, written as a third-year law student, which has been widely recognized as the source of the modern doctrine of First Amendment protection of commercial speech.\n\nAs a visiting professor at the University of Michigan Law School, Professor Redish won the L. Hart Wright Outstanding Teacher Award. He is also a three-time winner of the Robert Childress Memorial Award for Teaching Excellence, a two-time winner of the First Year Course Professor Award, and winner of a variety of other teaching awards at Northwestern.\n\nProfessor Redish has appeared as an expert witness before numerous congressional committees on such subjects as First Amendment protection of free expression, class actions, and congressional power to control federal jurisdiction. In addition, he has made frequent appearances in the national media, including Today, ABC and NBC national news, CNN, Court TV, CSPAN, public television, and National Public Radio."
