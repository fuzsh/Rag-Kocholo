Our goal is to document the all-encompassing Black experience, specifically in the United States, but throughout the entire African diaspora by building, sustaining, and protecting a safe platform for Black voices to be heard and understood.\n\nWe document the Diaspora’s cultural experiences globally through storytelling, content creation, content curation & social advocacy to shift narratives and paradigms. We aim to inform & inspire through dynamic, creative, & transformative content."
