Wade, and William K. Wyant, announced yesterday.\n\nAlthough now resident in Dunster House, Lewis was at one time a member of the Leverett House Committee. He was on the board of the Lampoon as Narthex, and in his Freshman year was sub-Art Chairman of the Red Book.\n\nOther appointments of members of the Album Staff have not as yet been made by Lewis, but the chairman is at present devoting his time to the selection of Seniors to fill the other posts necessary to the issue of the final publication of the class of 1935."
