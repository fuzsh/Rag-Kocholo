        "text": "A NYC educator, civil rights activist and social worker at the turn of the 20th century, William Lewis Bulkley was best known for founding one of three organizations that merged to become the National Urban League (NUL). His work to obtain educational and employment opportunities for African Americans became the NUL’s main purpose and its initial slogan “Not alms but opportunity” came from one of Bulkley’s speeches.\n\nBulkley was also a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and served on its first Executive Committee. He was a charter member and Treasurer of the New York Association for the Protection of Colored Women, helped the Charity Organization Society work on the tuberculosis problem, and helped the New York Association of Neighborhood Workers plan summer outings for children. He opened a YMCA for African Americans in Brooklyn and started a vocational school for African Americans in Manhattan.\n\nAs a scholar—the fourth African American to earn a Ph.D and the third to receive one from an American university—Dr. Bulkley gave numerous lectures on the condition of African Americans. He worked as a principal in the New York City public school system for over two decades.\n\nWilliam Lewis Bulkley was born in Greenville, South Carolina in 1861. He and his wife Mary Fisher Carroll were among the first college students to attend Claflin University in Orangeburg and may have met each other there. Bulkley’s father Vincent Bulkley, a Methodist Episcopalian minister, was one of the school’s founding trustees. According to Bulkley expert and Ridgewood, New Jersey librarian Peggy Norris, Mary’s parents were slaves who were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Evidence Norris has found points to Irish plantation owner James Parsons Carroll as being Mary’s grandfather.\n\nBulkley’s free parents were also of mixed race, as were several generations before them, starting with forced relationships during slavery. As the eldest son of the Rev. Vincent Bulkley, William was active in Methodist Church affairs in South Carolina. In 1889 he was elected a delegate to the World’s Sunday School Convention in London.\n\nAfter graduating from Claflin, Bulkley attended Wesleyan University in Connecticut and received his Ph.D from Syracuse University in 1893. He also studied abroad at the University of Strasbourg in Germany and la Sorbonne in France. He returned to Claflin as a professor teaching Latin, Greek, and German and became a vice president at the college.\n\nBorn at the start of the Civil War, Bulkley lived through the “Nadir Period”—the worst time of racial oppression since the civil war, marked by legal “separate but equal” segregation, job discrimination, and escalating racial violence. In South Carolina in the 1890’s—by some accounts the worst decade for lynchings of African Americans—Bulkley spoke out against the lynchings that took place around him. In A Voice from the South published in The Wesleyan Argus, he compared lynching to the Reign of Terror in France:\n\n“Then innocent men and women suffered death by the guillotine; now innocent men and women perish by bullet and hemp. Then men and women were given at least the semblance of a trial; now men and women are not brought into court. Then the executions were in the day-time; now the victims are ruthlessly dragged out of prisons and out of their homes to furnish sport for midnight marauders. Then Robespierre and Danton held the power and authority of state, and sentenced to death whom they would; now lawless beings discountenance the ‘powers that be’ and revel in blood.”\n\nIn 1899 the professor left the South and moved his family to Brooklyn, New York where he first worked as an elementary school teacher. He was quickly promoted to principal. As the Great Migration of blacks from the South to the North ensued, it created a crisis for African Americans arriving in NYC who could not find adequate housing and were excluded from anything but menial jobs.\n\nBulkley worried that African Americans would find it impossible to escape the “quagmire” and urged whites to employ them and consider their own interests:\n\n“You cannot circumscribe vice; it is contagious. Leave these millions of Negros to battle alone with this terrible weight with which they are now burdened and they would prove themselves little better than mortals if they did not follow the lines of least resistance and sink lower and lower into indolence, vagrancy and criminality… If for the sake of argument, it be granted that they are all that their most virulent enemies charge them with being, so much greater is the need of sparing no efforts for their uplift, not so much for their sakes as for your sakes.”\n\nBulkley’s rare status as an African American scholar enabled him to bring his appeals to top philanthropists and progressives. To form the Committee for the Improvement of the Industrial Condition of the Negro in New York (CIICNNY), he won the backing of the Armstrong Association. According to Guichard Parris and Lester Brooks, authors of Blacks in the City, A History of the National Urban League, the Armstrong Association enlisted some of the most prominent men in the country, from presidents of the United States to mayors of cities, as well as business and academic leaders, such as Andrew Carnegie and Harvard University President Charles William Eliot. At various times, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft reportedly participated in Armstrong Association activities. John Jay Schieffelin, president of the NYC Chapter, and a descendant of the first U.S. Chief Justice John Jay, was a key supporter of Bulkley’s and the CIICNNY. Bulkley’s and Schieffelin’s organizing activities at Schieffellin’s East 66th Street mansion and their fundraisers at Carnegie Hall were reported in the New York Times and other publications. Their partnership lasted some ten years.\n\nFive years after the CIICNNY was launched, the need to train social workers led to the establishment of another group – the Committee on Urban Conditions Among Negroes (CUCAN), headed by CIICNNY employee, George Haynes. According to Blacks in the City, Bulkley was on a small team chosen to nominate officers and the executive board of the CUCAN.\n\nWhen the CIICNNY, CUCAN, and the National League for the Protection of Colored Women merged to form what is today the National Urban League, Bulkley became a vice chairman of the consolidated organization as did Ruth Baldwin, wife of railroad magnet William Baldwin. According to a 1950 commemorative year book published by the NUL upon its 40th anniversary, Bulkley was Vice Chairman of its Executive Board from 1911-1914.\n\nFrom the start of the CIICNNY, Booker T. Washington, whose Tuskegee Institute also received financial support from the Armstrong Association, watched Bulkley’s progress closely. So did W.E.B. Du Bois. Du Bois and Washington were at odds with each other’s approach to secure “racial uplift,” with Du Bois insisting upon immediate equal rights and Washington calling instead for acceptance of limited rights which some believed was a more realistic goal. Bulkley managed to straddle this fence. On the one hand, he raised money for lawsuits, joined Du Bois in the Niagara Movement, and signed “the call” to form the NAACP. On the other, he was driven to address the pressing need to help his students graduate and find employment. He championed the cause that would become the NUL’s enduring mission to end job discrimination and provide job training. He started an evening school that modeled such training and the Board of Education considered exemplary.\n\nIn The Crisis, the NAACP’s magazine edited by Du Bois, Bulkley was listed as an officer and member of the NAACP’s Executive Committee in all magazine issues published from late 1910 to early 1912. He was part of the leadership team that overlapped both the NUL and NAACP and helped to develop their initial strategies and organizing structures.\n\nIn 2013, Susan D. Carle, an American University law professor and Yale Law School graduate, published Defining the Struggle: National Organizing for Racial Justice, 1880-1915. The book chronicles the intense organizing activity that occurred leading up to the establishment of the NUL and NAACP. Bulkley was one of several forgotten African American figures profiled in Carle’s book. According to the author, without their efforts the “almost miraculous successes” that followed would not have been possible.\n\nBulkley’s last known public appearance at a civil rights meeting was in 1915 when he attended a conference called by Du Bois in Amenia, New York. He remained in the NYC public school system for eight more years and upon retirement joined his family in France.\n\nBulkley died in Nice in 1933 before he could know that the NAACP and NUL would become the largest and most influential African American civil rights organizations in the United States.\n\n– Denise Bulkley de Murcie"
