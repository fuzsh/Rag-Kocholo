        "text": "List of the best college football players of 1892\n\nThe 1892 College Football All-America team was composed of college football players who were selected as the best players at their respective positions for the 1892 college football season, as selected by Caspar Whitney for Harper's Weekly and the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Whitney began publishing his All-America Team in 1889, and his list, which was considered the official All-America Team, was published in Harper's Weekly from 1891 to 1896. Harvard Law School student and football center William H. Lewis became the first African-American to be selected as an All-American in 1892, an honor he would receive again in 1893.\n\nWC = Walter Camp[1]\n\nCW = Caspar Whitney, published in Harper's Weekly magazine.\n\nBold = Consensus All-American[2]\n\nFrank Hinkey, Yale (College Football Hall of Fame) (WC, CW)\n\nFrank Hallowell, Harvard (WC, CW)\n\nAlexander Hamilton Wallis, Yale (WC, CW)\n\nMarshall Newell, Harvard (College Football Hall of Fame) (WC, CW)\n\nArt Wheeler, Princeton (College Football Hall of Fame) (WC, CW)\n\nBert Waters, Harvard (WC)\n\nWilliam H.
