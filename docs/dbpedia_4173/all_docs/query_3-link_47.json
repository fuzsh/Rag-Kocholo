        "text": "Now they just need to fix the customization screen being 4:3 aspect ratio and the low-quality pre-rendered cutscenes.\n\nNot holding out hope for the latter, but it's nice to see Capcom actually putting in a bit of effort to patch their releases for once.\n\nI doubt they would ever do proper physical again on Switch, for all territories that is, since their current Cheapcom tactic works, but this news and the quality of the Megaman Zero/ZX Collection gives me hope for the future in terms of quality.\n\nYeah not sure how putting makeup on trash is going to make it any less rubbish but go ahead.\n\nKnock yourselves out Capcom.\n\nGenuinely hope these jokers stop attempting to release games on the Switch.\n\nEverything they have come up with is either one of these things or all of them:\n\nOver priced\n\nPoorly ported\n\nAncient ports\n\nTake up far too much storage space\n\nNo physical games\n\nHonestly from where i am sitting they're doing more harm than good. This is like anti-support.\n\nI am so happy they have no further plans to puke out anything else on the Switch. Hopefully it remains that way.\n\n@PlayedNSlayed EA really stopped caring years ago.. i kinda get why too, they had issues with Nintendo even from the Wii days. EA hated the Wii, famously called it \"2 Gamecubes glued together\".\n\nbut Capcom...\n\nI am just beyond done with them.\n\nThey went from fully supporting the 3DS with Exclusive games and dedicated support just 3 years ago.\n\nTo releasing old poorly ported over priced games that are not worth the money they cost on the Switch just 3 years later.\n\nNothing to indicate why they dropped support in such a way and in the face of the Switches increased support from other developers and the success of the console itself.\n\nThis genuinely makes no sense.\n\nBut i am done trying to make sense of this crap. I won't give them any more of my money.\n\n@raisenv Oh my bad man, i didn't care to go into too much detail on why its trash but in all honesty it's not the game itself but the way in which it has been presented.\n\nIt comes as digital only, it takes up over 5 gigs of storage... 5 gigs? For a game from 2005 with minimal improvements? I mean the game was released on the PS2... i just can't go into the details of how lazily this must have been ported.\n\nThe worst part about this is who actually cares about these games?... there's so many other Capcom IPs that people care so much more about, I doubt this thing even shifted 500k on an install base 52+m, Capcom doesn't seem too bothered what they put on the Switch or whether it even sells or not.\n\nA bit off the topic of your comment but look at their top selling games list they put together a few weeks back, https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/02/capcom_updates_its_million-seller_list_94_games_have_surpassed_the_milestone\n\nNow look at where you see the Switch, not till MHGU which is listed with the 3ds at 3.4m sold... damn thing sold 2.8m on the 3DS meaning even MHGU on the Switch hasn't even hit 1m.\n\nto put it another way MH4 has sold more on it's own than all Capcom games on the Switch combined\n\nThey dont have a single game on the Switch that has sold 1m on its own, the ones that are sitting at the bottom of the list are also listed with PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nThis is 100% their own doing too, they knowingly put drudgery on here and over charge us for it, Now look at the 3DS...\n\nThe difference in support is just ridiculous. This works both ways though, they don't care about the Switch and obviously they are not picking up sales even remotely close to what they use to get on the 3DS, i hope Capcom never make another game on the Switch again.\n\nTo be totally honest i wouldn't be surprised if they are doing this so they can point to the Switch and say \"they don't buy our games so we don't need to make games for them\".\n\n@razer There are a bunch of factors you're not considering. So, from the top. Game size. Yes, this was a PS2 game. That ran at 480i. Every texture, effect and model needs to be upscaled to 1080p. This makes files a lot bigger.\n\nYes, Digital-only stinks, but that has the added benefit of letting someone only get DMC 1 and 3, letting them ignore 2 ever existed. I also advocate for Digital games the majority of the time (there are cases, such as de-listing, that I'm aware of and oppose).\n\nAs to Who Cares. A LOT OF PEOPLE. They're a niche, yes, but a sizable and vocal niche who REALLY appreciate having official Style/Weapon Switching support. This is an incredible update to a Classic of the genre.\n\nYou seem very focused on sales numbers alone, when total sales is a really bad number to focus on. That's why it took so long to get DMC5, because Capcom expected 4 to do Call of Duty numbers back in the day. It sold great! Fantastic even, best of any DMC at that point. But CoD numbers? No. They made profit and still called it a failure when it wasn't.\n\nNow, Monster Hunter 4. It sold so we'll because MonHun was Nintendo/3DS exclusive at that point. And everyone in Japan had a 3DS for this reason. Western sales don't matter here, because that game wasn't released over seas. 4 Ultimate was, and that has its own sales figures. It sold about as much, a little more, and was released in most regions. The whole world bought the update as much as Japan ALONE bought the first.\n\nUltra Street Fighter 2 was considered a HUGE success and it ain't on that list. So consider what Capcom considers to be a success these days, and be happy they're making such good content for the Switch Platform. I think they're performing admirably. With Monster Hunter World selling so well, they can focus on making more niche projects for Switch and other systems, like DMC3 with the update and MMZero Collection.\n\nThat's my 2 cents\n\n@SergeEXE i think your missing the ultimate point here.\n\nI mean are you genuinely trying to say that Capcom's support on the Switch is what it use to be on the 3DS? Because a child can see otherwise.\n\nYou say that Capcom sold so well on the 3DS because their games were exclusive but other developers made exclusive games for the 3DS too, so why didn't their games sell a combined total of 15+m?\n\nBecause outside actually saying that, there is no defense for what they are doing.\n\nYou can pretend that they are supporting the Switch but the evidence shows differently.\n\nYes i am focused on numbers because developers use the numbers to site reasons for dropping support.\n\nDo you think CoD should have stayed because it made a little profit? It barely broke even on the Wii U and won't ya look at that. No CoD at all on the Switch.\n\nIt's their own fault, they made a poor effort so they could use it as an excuse to drop support.\n\nEA did the same thing and Capcom are following down the same route.\n\nI don't follow everything these guys say but they have a point in many cases. Particularly here.\n\nhttps://www.ccn.com/devil-may-cry-3-switch-release-shows-capcom-hates-nintendo-fans/\n\n2 other things i wanted to mention and ask.\n\nFirst is Ultra Street Fighter 2s sales figures are bundled in with Street Fighter 2 i think. Thats on the list.\n\nThe other thing i wanted to ask... do you think its good that Capcom concentrates on bigger game releases for other consoles while giving the Switch old over priced ports that nobody has ever asked for? (Niche, like you said)...\n\nDo you think thats a good thing?\n\n@Razer You know, most PS2 games used single-layer DVD that can hold 4.7GB of data, some can even exceed that and resorted to dual disc or using higher capacity DVD9. I don't know what DMC3 used back then, or if it even fill the full capacity of the disk. But with a lot of cinematics and voiced cutscenes, I'm pretty sure it's close to filling the whole disk. The point is, 5GB for the enhanced version with upgraded visual (including upscaled textures etc) is very reasonable, I thought it'd be bigger than that . And really, for today's standard 5GB digital game is basically nothing.\n\nAs for your general Capcom complain itself, maybe one of the reason got to do with their engine. The older one, MT Framework was very versatile and can work in even 3DS. The current one, RE Engine, seems to require heavy horsepower and maybe tricky if not impossible to port to Switch.\n\nBefore anyone say \"but Witcher 3 and Doom etc\", every engine is unique especially a company's proprietary one. What works in one engine may not work in another. And certainly nobody should torture themselves playing DMC5 on Switch if it has choppy frame rate.\n\n@raisenv sorry man you should space out your paragraphs, makes it a bit easier on the eyes for people on mobile.\n\nYeah i do see your point about file size actually but then again they still released the game for £20 digitally and £60 for the collection of 1 2 and 3 while the HD collection of all 3 is £30 on the PS4 and Xbox.\n\nYou can't say \"Switch tax because of carts\" when its digital only. Thats pure greed\n\nAnd i honestly do not believe their lack of effort on the Switch has anything to do with their engine.\n\nCapcom have always been good at making games on Nintendo hardware and their games especially on the 3DS have constantly sold well, it's stupid to consider that they didn't speak to Nintendo to factor in upcoming hardware requirements when creating a new engine.\n\nBusinesses just don't do things that way, they would have seen the revenue that Nintendo hold for their business and they would have certainly factored these things in.\n\nIt was even stated that Capcom made requests from Nintendo on the Switch before it was released.\n\nWhy would Capcom make any requests if they never planned to support the console past old, over priced, niche ports?\n\nClearly something changed, maybe Capcom expected more dedicated exposure on the Switch for themselves and were turned off by the level of competition they would have to deal with from other developers?\n\nMaybe the success of MHW set their greedy hides on a different path?\n\nWhatever the reason for the sudden drop in support, i doubt it would be as an uninformed decision as \"our engine is too good for the hardware\". That narrative just doesn't fit when you think of the potential revenue generated from the MH franchise on the 3DS.\n\nThe people lining their pockets with that money in Capcom HQ would certainly have spoken to Nintendo prior to making any new engine. Which we know they did.\n\nI mean one could easily argue that with the success of MHW in the west, it would be a good time to explore an exclusive title for the Switch, as with its install base, the demand for a game on the Switch and the success of the franchise on previous hardware, it would just make sense to look at this.\n\nBut nothing Capcom has done as of late make any sense anymore.\n\n@raisenv i personally think you're selling the Switch off short here, like most others... \"if you want the latest and greatest, the Switch isn't for you\" I'm sorry but that's a foolish excuse people give when third parties don't make the effort and Switch fans lap it up and make excuses for them - They don't need to release the newest versions of their games to show us support and you know it - Both Square Enix and Ubisoft have proven that.\n\nCharging the same price for all digital games as PS4 and Xbox One would be a good start in not shafting Switch owners too but thats a separate topic...\n\nNext people will start saying \"yeah but the Switch must be harder to develop for so that's why the old ass ports are nearly double price for us\"...\n\nIt's just an excuse and you're feeding into that narrative - tell me, if porting games is a more viable option for Capcom, why has Octopath Traveller sold more than all of Capcoms efforts on the Switch combined?\n\nI'm no developer but I'd be willing to bet money that making Octopath cost Square less money than all of the ports Capcom have puked on us.\n\nLike i said before, Capcom have the capability to develop exclusive games that are evergreen sellers on Nintendo hardware that sell as much as Nintendo own games\n\nThey could makes games that would sell 10m+ copies on the Switch and they squander that potential to give us old ass ports and you and many like you just excuse them for it."
