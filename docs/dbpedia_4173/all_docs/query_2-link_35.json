        "text": "Author’s Note: As you can probably guess from the title, this article is going to be heavy on spoilers for Devil May Cry 5. Readers have been duly warned.\n\nI don’t often talk video games on this blog (Sunglass, you hardly talk anything on this blog anymore!) but Devil May Cry 5 released last week to huge acclaim and attention, acclaim it has earned it as far as I can tell.\n\nConfession time – I haven’t actually played a single DMC game yet because I have the reflexes of a rheumatic fainting goat, and don’t have a computer or console able to play the titles anyways. That being said, I’ve always loved watching other people play the games and enjoy a lot of the aesthetics and sense of the humor of the series. DMC 5 has been just as fun to tune into because of how naturally it extends the high-octane, stylish gameplay design from the most well-regarded titles of the franchise, while also effectively paralleling their story themes and character development.\n\nRecently, at this year’s Game Developers’ Conference, there was a panel describing aspects of DMC 5’s game design. Specifically, it focused on an overarching design philosophy which contributed to emotionally cathartic experiences in both the mechanics of gameplay and its resolution of multiple storylines carried over from previous games.\n\nAfter seeing the presentation, I had a conversation with some friends about how Capcom could potentially tackle a remake of the older games in the franchise, in the same vein as the Resident Evil 2 Remake, also from earlier this year. That remake was both a critical and sales success because it recreated RE2 with modern game design conceits (over-the-shoulder camera with an aiming reticule in lieu of tank-style controls, for example) while still preserving the atmosphere and challenge in ways that fit with the new gameplay mechanics.\n\nIt wasn’t simply an HD reskin, but a complete overhaul of the game, re-imagining and re-contextualizing memorable set-pieces and characters in new and interesting ways. This experience was consistently driven by a philosophy mindful of elements which made the best modern games in the franchise successful, drawing from both RE4 and the engine of RE7 Biohazard.\n\nDMC 2 is a game which has been largely glossed over by players of the franchise, much less Capcom itself. It got a grand total of thirty seconds of reference in the recap material for 5. Heck, even the anime is more integral to this game since Morrison and Patty both have appearances or spoken dialogue in its cutscenes. Lucia just gets an appearance in the Japan-only prequel novel.\n\nMost of the reason for this lowly position of regard comes from its lackluster gameplay. DMC 2 attempted to produce an even deeper, more extensive action-based gameplay experience than its predecessor. “Attempted” being the key word here. The result of an absurdly short production period, DMC 2 adds a second protagonist, Lucia, but loses the fast-paced combat based on building combos with varied weapon styles. Instead, the game only offers Dante and Lucia reskinned swords which feature the exact same combos and movepools. It also lacks any sort of meaningful variety in missions and enemy encounters as a result of the limited weapon options both characters must suffer with.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics themselves are relatively straightforward to fix in an updated remake. All Capcom’s development team has to do is provide a better variety of weapons, and also redesign bosses to be more interesting fights than just “sit in the corner and spam bullets until it dies”.\n\nDull gameplay aside, DMC 2’s lack of unique weapons also leads to a lack of specific, cathartic “hell yeah!” moments which change how the game is played. Every other DMC title has multiple weapons to add completely new ways of approaching enemy encounters and new ways of feeling like a stylish badass when pulling off combos on them to boot. This adds replay value to the game because it allows for new strategies players can attempt on previously-fought encounters or bosses. The new weapons Lucia and Dante both gain during 2 only change basic damage output and range, not the combos in a significant way.\n\nBut variety can also be added through other mechanics than just a weapons loadout. It can also be added by doing more with the new concepts for the Devil Trigger mechanics introduced in this game. The first new mechanic is the ability to customize this super form with different “devil hearts” which give different effects, such as changing the element of the attacks, increasing damage output, adding a healing effect, or enabling flight, among other things. DMC 2 also introduces a “desperation Devil Trigger” form for Dante, which can be activated when he hits critically low health.\n\nWhile this game introduces these new concepts, it doesn’t tie them into any sort of justification within the game’s narrative or the characterizations of our protagonists who make use of the Devil Trigger forms.\n\nIf you’ve read the rest of my articles, you should know by this point I LOVE narratives which effectively parallel their themes across multiple levels, and DMC follows the Shonen Action trope of paralleling significant events of character development with significant power upgrades. Typically in DMC games, these are tied to the Devil Trigger forms used by the different characters, and can completely change how their gameplay works, either through the rest of the missions on a story mode, or in subsequent playthroughs on different modes. For example, Dante can’t even Devil Trigger in 1 or 3 until specific story events happen, and Nero doesn’t gain the ability to DT and use the sword Yamato until almost halfway through 4.\n\nEmbellishing these Devil Trigger mechanics should benefit the game not just by creating a deeper play style with different strategies to be used, but also by creating significant touchstones of development for both Dante and Lucia’s characters. Therefore they should also be built into cathartic moments in the plot. As it so happens, the panel on DMC 5 talks about this concept and frames it in the narrative-building sense of “Setback vs Awakening”.\n\nIn other words, the game’s story poses a significant challenge to the characters, and then shows how they gain a new strength or power as a result of overcoming it.\n\nTo really make DMC 2 stand out within the franchise and to tie it closer in with the main themes which connect the other games then, we need to also revamp the existing storyline to fit the structure of “setback vs. awakening” clearly and consistently. What might a remastered narrative for DMC 2 look like then, to effectively set up more memorable moments within the game’s experience?\n\nAs other people have pointed out in the wake of DMC 5’s release, the story of the game provides resolution for an arc fundamentally focused on family. Dante comes to terms with his role as a son of Sparda and his relationship with Vergil, and later on Vergil has his own resurrection and accepts his (admittedly reluctant) role as Nero’s father. That’s on top of Nero’s own newfound role as a mediator and peacemaker uniting the two previously bitterly-conflicted brothers.\n\nSeriously, for a game that’s almost entirely focused on killing the crap out of demons in increasingly-ridiculous ways, it gets a lot of mileage out of its plot by simply featuring interesting characters and being consistent and straightforward about their interactions and motivations. I want DMC 2 to use that same impetus to make its story interesting as well. So let’s look at how it might fit into this theme based on its chronological position within the franchise.\n\nBefore the events of this game, Dante has been through two separate occasions where he had presumed his brother dead, only to find him again and then subsequently be forced to kill him personally . To say that would ruin your day would be an understatement. In addition to this, he has also come to understand his connection to his father’s legacy more intimately, both in contrast to Vergil’s lust for power in DMC 3, but also in the resolution of defeating the demon king, Mundus, responsible for destroying his family in DMC 1.\n\nBut Dante’s story didn’t end there. His inherited responsibility to protect the human world from demons keeps going. And going. And going!\n\nJust think about it, all the upstart demons who try to invade Earth, all the corrupt humans who try to use demonic power for their own selfish ends. Even if he’s successful in all these jobs, the constant drudge of cleaning up these messes would eventually make his mission seem pointless, or would seemingly invalidate the sacrifices already made to seal demons away from the human world. And even with his newfound comrades alongside him, the concept that he is the only person to bear the burden of responsibility in continuing Sparda’s work must have grown to be unbearably heavy. We can see that even in the Inoue-written anime series, where Dante is still upbeat and joking while around others, and much more down when alone with his own thoughts.\n\nAnd so we arrive at the “Setback” for Dante – Despair.\n\nDespair is an emotion which can be defined in a number of ways, but a definition I’ve found useful places it in relation to something perceived as a good which is difficult to attain. Despair is the emotional response we have when we believe that good to be impossible to achieve, and so turn away from it in response.\n\nDMC 2 as it stands now doesn’t do a lot of heavy lifting for Dante’s character, but we can infer his despair from his outward demeanor. He was hiding a lot of anger and bitterness in DMC 1 already, but the wisecracking woohoos are completely gone from the sequel. The only reason he gives for showing up for the job is for a story about Sparda, a connection to his father’s legacy. In other words, Dante thinks it impossible that he alone could live up to Sparda’s legacy and despairs in that thought. Questioning his own purpose and responsibility, he’s looking for answers to justify his fight in this game.\n\nHow could the game set this up? Well DMC games have always been relatively light on plot. This isn’t a Kingdom Hearts title where we require twenty-minute long expository cutscenes with flashbacks to explain intricate metaphysical mechanics. (There’s demons. Dante has this huge sword. He kills demons with said sword. There’s your world-building!) But it doesn’t take a lot to introduce this idea, just a short scene of Dante at his storefront, and a chance for the audience to see his mindset This could happen explicitly in interactions with the other characters — Lady and Trish are great for this, both of them know him well enough to know when something’s off. Or, the audience could also simply infer it through his reaction upon initially receiving the job. Disinterest at first, then reluctant acceptance when he’s offered more information about Sparda.\n\nOf course he can’t stay in that mindset for the whole game, we need something to shake him out of that despair and give him a better reason to fight than simple filial obligation.\n\nEnter our secondary protagonist – Lucia.\n\nThe setback/awakening duology of development fits with Lucia’s character more explicitly, which makes sense because she already has more explicit development through the course of the game. We’re introduced to her as another demon hunter, who also claims to also be a successor of a legacy of demon hunters who fought alongside the legendary Dark Knight, Sparda. Also like Dante inherited his role from his father, Lucia inherited this role from her grandmotherly figure and mentor, Matier.\n\nBut Lucia is also able to Devil Trigger, a power that normal humans obviously shouldn’t have. As it turns out, Lucia herself is also a demon, but one artificially created by the game’s main villain, an evil corporate oligarch named Arius. Originally intended to be a bodyguard/spy/general-purpose underling for purposes of taking over the world in a very generic way, she was considered defective, and tossed out as garbage. But instead of dying, Lucia was adopted by Matier, who cared for her and raised her like a child.\n\nThe “setback” for Lucia is obvious. The revelation of her origin hits her hard, and she becomes convinced that she’ll eventually lose her adopted identity and revert into a monster who will attack the people she once swore to defend. Her mission at this point in the game becomes suicidal, seeking to stop the man responsible for unleashing demonic forces and creating her, and also dying in the process.\n\nHer “awakening” then comes from Dante’s interactions with her. Later on, she asks Dante to kill her, and he (of course) refuses. At the end of the game, Arius’ plans (of course) backfire and they have to kill the demon he summoned before it arrives on Earth. Lucia wants to be the one to plunge into hell and fight it, since it’s assumed to be a one-way trip, and she still doesn’t see herself as worth saving. But Dante offers a coin toss to decide who goes in. He “wins”, jumps through the hellmouth, and then Lucia realizes that he used a trick coin with two heads.\n\nInterestingly enough, the “awakening” for Dante also comes from this scene, as evidenced by him willingly choosing to sacrifice himself to protect Lucia and the world, and doing it in such a playful way as a trick coin. Their interaction marks the point where both demon hunters come to a new understanding of their mission to kill the crap out of said demons. Dante is moved by Lucia’s devotion to protect humanity. Not to mention, the fact Lucia’s position as an heir to a demon-hunting legacy is one built on familial bonds not shared by blood. At the same time, Lucia comes to understand her own humanity when Dante not only refuses to kill her, but entrusts her to continue the fight on Earth while he’s taking care of things in the underworld.\n\nIn short, Dante learns that he isn’t alone, and comes to appreciate the allies he’s made in his fight as a kind of family. Lucia comes to appreciate herself and trusts her own power to protect others. But the simple text as shown in a cutscene isn’t enough to make truly memorable gameplay moments, regardless of how tightly written and directed they are. How could this awakening then be demonstrated either through new gameplay mechanics or encounters in the endgame to reinforce these connections?\n\nThe culmination of both characters’ arcs can be understood by re-contextualizing the Devil Trigger mechanics, along with Dante and Lucia’s final boss fight showdowns.\n\nFor Lucia, the very fact she even has Devil Trigger mechanics poses both a challenge and cathartic reward within her character arc. Gameplay-wise, it would be interesting to see Capcom adapt the “Devil Heart” mechanic for her unique use, and distinguish her fighting style from Dante’s weapon-swapping. This new style might then focus on utilizing lesser-powered Devil Trigger forms in different scenarios (similar to the idea of Nero using expendable Devil Breaker arms with multiple utilities). When she comes to the awakening of how her ability is used to protect others, this can be paralleled by her unlocking her own classic Devil Trigger form, rather than one that comes from defeating other demons or items laying around the environments.\n\nAnother way to parallel her awakening is by contrasting her true, angelic Devil Trigger form against her final boss fight – Arius himself, but now twisted into a monstrous mockery of humanity after his plans predictably backfire.\n\nArius on the left, and Lucia’s DT form on the right (if it wasn’t obvious)\n\nMaking the villain an evil businessman seems like the lowest-effort social commentary possible, but it works here if handled properly. The franchise is pretty consistent in depicting demons — and humans who wish to exploit demonic power, so becoming demons in the process– as using other innocent humans as fodder for flesh, blood and souls. DMC 2 needs to play that angle up with Arius, though not to such a ridiculous degree that we wrap back around into the DmC reboot’s level of edge, mind you. Seeing Arius gain the power he desires and completely losing his self in the process, while Lucia gains her sense of self as a result of her newfound awakening would be a great way to set off her character’s development.\n\nDante himself already has a unique “desperation” Devil Trigger mechanic which can activate when he reaches critically low health, and has much greater damage output along with a different design.\n\nNow, this is just me writing wild head-canons, but I think that like with Lucia, the fact he has this form at all signifies the challenge his character faces. Despairing of his purpose and finding himself unable to live up to his bloodline’s legacy, Dante’s despair is leading him away from his connections to humanity, and creates this more monstrous-looking DT form in moments of immense stress (i.e. low health). An explicit relation between Dante gaining his Desperation DT and this mindset would also justify why it’s a mechanic in this title, but not in the others.\n\nAlso like Lucia, this connection can be further emphasized by contrasting Dante with his final boss fights in the game. Unfortunately, while Lucia’s story arc is very straightforward and plainly-shown in the events of DMC 2, both of Dante’s opponents lack a lot of explicit context. Argosax the Chaos, the monster Arius was attempting to siphon power from, is a terrible boss comprised of a melted conglomeration of previous bosses of equally-terrible designs. The ACTUAL final boss, Despair Embodied, itself has zero justification for its presence provided in the game at all. So please bear with me as try to hack in an explanation for, not just their existence, but also how they might highlight Dante’s characteristic epiphany in the endgame.\n\nFirst of all, we can extrapolate from the idea of Argosax existing as an eldritch abomination which absorbs the essences of other demons and creatures throughout the game. The player actually fight several different forms of Argosax during the missions of DMC 2, including one instance where it merges out from the stone, mortar and glass of a skyscraper. We could then feasibly understand Argosax as something fundamentally formless, instead taking on forms provided by other objects or living beings. If Arius was binding it using sorcery to try and use its power, then this final fight can be explained as Argosax taking on the forms of the other demons also produced by Arius’ meddling. When Arius dies, and the rituals he used are undone, Argosax is freed to take on the form of something else.\n\nAnd guess who’s stuck in Hell with it at that moment!\n\nIn this revision then, Despair Embodied is no longer just a Giant Space Flea From Nowhere, but has a more explicit connection with Dante’s character arc, as Argosax is empowered by taking on the form of Dante’s own despair.\n\nIf Lucia fights her opposite – a human corrupted by demonic power into something less than human – then Dante versus Despair Embodied also reflects his struggle against his opposite. In this case, his demonic side completely and irrevocably removed from any connections to humanity. I mean, it’s already depicted as a flaming humanoid apparition with a giant sword, a redesign to make it appear more like Dante’s Desperation DT form would hammer that point home more significantly.\n\nOh, and come to think of it, Dante’s upgraded “Sin” Devil Trigger in 5 also borrows design influence from 2’s Desperation DT. This re-imagining then adds an extra layer of dramatic irony onto its design being used to represent the final fusion of both Dante’s demonic and human halves into the “true” form of his power.\n\nAnyways, by defeating Despair Embodied, Dante shows he still has the resolve to continue fighting to protect humanity against the encroaching forces of darkness, rather than succumbing to that darkness (as Vergil did).\n\nIn conclusion, if you’ve made it through 3500 words of blatant headcanons from someone who has only watched Let’s Plays of DMC games, thank you for putting up with this nonsense. None of these points really represent dramatic changes in DMC 2 in actuality though. In order to truly create an effective remake of the game, Capcom would have to completely overhaul the gameplay style and missions to create an experience both fun and challenging. And by that, I mean challenging in the way players have come to expect from DMC 5’s tight scaling and well-designed enemy encounters. More specific details of gamplay mechanics are beyond me, as well they should be because I am terrible at playing flashy, combo-based action games.\n\nBut what I really like to do is to talk about how heroic narratives can shape emotional reactions within their audiences. Somehow, the full arc of the DMC franchise managed to do that with shocking effectiveness.\n\nNow that the main story of the Sons of Sparda has apparently reached its conclusion with 5, it’d be interesting to see a canonical part of that narrative revisited and connected to its successors more explicitly. Especially considering DMC 2‘s place in the canon of the series now slots it definitively before DMC 4. The themes in this game could potentially build interesting groundwork for the more upbeat and goofy “Crazy Pizza Uncle” Dante we came to know and love in that title, as he begins value the bonds he’s made in a different way. And perhaps, a little more of a long-shot here, a re-vamp of DMC 2 could lay the groundwork for more appearances from Lucia in the future as well.\n\nHey, you never know."
