        "text": "I think it is about time to finally get this post done. More people are doing their big videos on this game and most of the fans know what happens in this title. I know I still did not do a post on the reboot game, but to be honest… that will still be a work in progress. Also, why do I want to talk about the bummer title when we got the actual Devil May Cry 5! The reason why I did these posts was to celebrate the series and I even had to cover the second game and try to bring light and a different point of view to most of its glaring problems. There is a lot to love about Devil May Cry and now this fifth entry is probably a huge collection of why fans and its creators have loved it for so long.\n\nI will not lie, this game feels like a finale in many ways. We got tons of plot points that were introduced in three and four that finally got their proper follow-ups. On top of that we had a prequel novel with events before five that actually had Lucia from the second game and man the amount of personality, she had in that one novel is far better than how she was presented in the game. Along with that we got many great callbacks to the entire series and yes this includes the reboot game. Devil May Cry 5 has everything and while some may think having things that represent the reboot game seems to be wishy washy, because it can seem this game was making no enemies in the fanbase. To be honest though, even a fan like me can say there are good to even great things to the reboot title (which will be for another day). I do find the callbacks to the first DMC to also be interesting because both the original and reboot title were not done by the man; we know for Devil May Cry now, Hideki Itsuno. Being with this franchise for a long time though and seeing its many faces, this man learned how to merge things together with perfection.\n\nSpeaking of perfection, I am torn with saying this is the best Devil May Cry game ever. The action in this game is just the best! So much variety is given with only three characters and two in particular are like over ten characters in one and the third one is literally four in one. There are even foes that have come back from the original game like Sin Scissors and Nobodies. The only big flaw here though is that the DMC series finally got rid of those puzzles and while secret missions do have some fun little puzzles to solve, DMC5 breaks the tradition and actually does go for the reboot’s way of level design a bit. In 5, you are walking straight a whole lot, but at times I would rarely notice because the action is that good. So as of right now the remaining Resident Evil in DMC is literally the engine that runs in this game.\n\nOnto the other aspect of Devil May Cry that has been with the series ever since the beginning is Dante. As talked about before, Dante as always been the cool surfer bro when he is on the job. Dante in the original game shrugs off danger like he is a Toku hero. In Devil May Cry 3 we get to see that attitude take a reckless variation until he finally notices what he needs to do. Then with the fourth game, Dante got to act like a mentor passing off the torch to another son of Sparda. For this new look into Dante’s life we actually get his anime personality at the beginning. Dante has no running power or water in his place and still just rests at his desk. A new job comes up and he hears something that kicks his gears right back in. Dante’s self-destruction comes clear in this title and it finally adds in a larger sense of relatability to him. Back then we loved his moments of fun and also took in his sadness as well (with the first game, it got taken more as a joke sadly…). Also let us add on the fact that is been teen years since we got to see this demon hunter back in action. Dante is us; he has been waiting for another gig and so have we. The major difference is that Dante actually does not want to waste any time though. It sure is interesting to see Dante with age becomes narrowminded in a fashion.\n\nNow back in fashion, is the youngest Devil Hunter, Nero. With this character, I took a look at his punk attitude and while that is still clearly here, we get to see his full character and take a step forward as well. To be frank, this easily could have the title of Nero’s Awakening. Yes, the main character role is given to Nero again and while many would think after DMC4, they would not do that again. The issues with Nero’s debut was because of budget restraints for the most part. It felt unfair to Nero and it is only thanks to time and a major misstep from the franchise to make fans warm up to him. Nero was my beginning with the series so seeing how he deals with these new events is heartwarming. Itsuno even gives Nero shorter hair and somehow people mistook him for Dante from the reboot title. Both Nero and Donte share a punkish attitude so this short hair look works for Nero and they also made sure to give him some Vergil details since that will be a major thing later on.\n\nAlong with Nero is a whole new look into how he plays. Back then, Nero only had his one special arm that gave him the greatest grab in video games. Nero can still do the famous Snatch move, but Nero has far more than just grabs. Nero has electricity, parries, time stops, flying arms, and even a freaking Mega Buster! That is only about half of the arms’ abilities and these are an insane concept to add to the Devil May Cry series. In a way this is a method of keeping some Resident Evil in the series since the arms have to be used with a worry about your inventory. The arms are a bit fragile so when taking a hit, they break and you can break them yourself to unleash a powerful move. At first, Itsuno was questioning if they should make the Devil Breakers similar to Dante with his weapons, but they wanted to make Nero stand out in many ways. The team decided to work with consumable weapons (and this time not like a Holy Water that subtracts your score). Either way these items really show Nero’s character well. They have large impact, but with reckless behavior can lead to messy situations and regretting your actions.\n\nOnto the aspect of regret we have our brand-new character, V (yes that is his name). V actually brings back a style of cool that was almost in the series before and that is goth. The original Donte had more gothic themes along with his British punk aspects and to be honest, it would have been fine in my opinion. Now is it better to have a new character pick up this theme, yes that is for sure. A new character can bring new aspects to a series just like Nero introduced the punk attitude. In a way though… V does take ideas from Donte because of who he actually is. Now we get to the part where all chains are off. What I am implying here is that V is Vergil. Vergil who has been seen as posh cool and a character who had loss after loss. Vergil split himself into two and V is the human half with barely any demon power. V is extremely fragile as he is a literal husk of what Vergil left behind. A big reason why William Blake is being used for this game ever since the beginning. That opening statement is all about how holding grieving emotions towards another just leads to a path of destruction. V is now the one who notices that and wants to redeem his errors.\n\nNow V is still not a perfect man, but taking steps to fix what he has done is improvement none the less. On top of that V even brings a new style of combat into the series, summoning. V has three summonses where they are all from Devil May Cry original. Even the summons mention how they were born. These summonses were created from memories of when Vergil was Nelo Angelo a huge aspect Vergil wanted to get rid of. The demon, Urizen has no memories he just knows he has suffered losses from Dante and wants power! V being the shell of the part of Vergil’s life he wanted to shed is truly literal since he even tried to get rid of those memories which made the summons, Griffon, Shadow, and Nightmare. V brings new tactical combat to the series and while your familiars do the damage, V has to bring the finishing blow. V is extremely fragile and relies on stepping away for the most part. The gothic themes even come clearer when playing as him. His slender designs while wearing pure black clothes and with those tattoos just create an interesting image of a fighter. V even uses a cane to walk around. The best part about V is that you control your summons with different buttons, except for Nightmare until you ride and control him. You can even taunt while the partners are attacking and it is the greatest!\n\nI am sorry if this is going to be an extremely long post, but there is still more to cover here. We got another new character by the name Nico. Sure, she is not a playable character, but her importance is large none the less. Originally designed to be another badass character, Nico was going to be more of a straight arrow that loved her craft. Through some improvising though the actress found a new way to show how Nico acts. Nico is playing things up while keeping a cool demeanor. When she is in the van, she is one of the devil hunters, hell this van is a Devil Weapon! She knows how dangerous things are and tries to hide it because this is pure bliss. She actually relates to any fan of the series since we love what we are watching, but if this was our reality, we would be extremely afraid. She also works so well with Nero from the get go since they both come from a story where they were neglected by their fathers. This is why these two have brother and sister like relationship so quickly and I love it so much. Nico easily became my favorite girl of the series which is impressive and it’s all thanks to how an actress wanted to add in some comedy for the character.\n\nOkay now for the big, big, and I mean big spoilers for this game and some of the greatest moments the series ever had. The return of Vergil and what that could bring after so many years. Vergil has always been an important figure in the series even in the first game with his Nelo Angelo appearance. So, what is in store for Vergil this time around, yes, he becomes the final boss again like his role in Devil May Cry 3 and yet so much has changed for him. Vergil now returns to where Dante has grown older and even seeing his son take steps that both Vergil and Dante never could do. A family is reunited with this one character returning. Two brothers are back and a son gets to meet his father for the first time. Family is an extremely large part of the Devil May Cry series ever since day one. The first Dante wanted revenge for the death of his mother and we got to see how fragile of a topic this was for him. This only got expanded in his prequel title where he sheds a tear for the loss of his brother and feeling pain that only Lady knows as well. The thing is though, Dante accepts what he has done after all of these years.\n\nTaking a bit of a detour to talk about other mechanics in the game that really enrichen the experience. The first one is Dante’s new power, the Sin Devil Trigger. Dante can now achieve higher than his father and wields a new sword under his own name. This new Devil Trigger really just shows off how powerful Dante as become. You do not get the healing factor with this one, but the damage output is insane! Dante even gets the largest weapon load of the entire series. Dante can have all of his swords after finishing the game at different difficulties, the return of the Kalina Ann and its second version which Dante dual wields them, new crazy weapons like the Faust Hat and the Cavaliere, and new spins on Ebony and Ivory and even Cerberus. Along with all of this you can even show off your skills to others thanks to the Cameo mechanics. Where your data is saved and can pop up to help players or to simply show off in the background. There is just so much style in this game and it makes sure you get the chance to show it off yourself.\n\nVergil is back and what happened because of him? A giant demon tree is summoned so that the demon half, Urizen can acquire power that the demon king, Mundus had. Which is quite an interesting detail since before the final fight with Urizen, we see him covering his true self. Vergil caused chaos yet again and with him back, Dante holds nothing back. Dante goes for the first attack, yes Dante of all people. He has no warm embrace for his brother, his heroic sense takes a violent turn. Dante has already done this before, twice to be specific. He holds no regrets on his past even if it still was damaging to his overall life. Dante has become tired of all this.\n\nAs for Vergil returning, he had two different experiences at the same time. Urizen, the demon wanting power and V the man who got to see the true terror of that. We even get to learn the reason for how Vergil came to be which is mommy issues. Yes, this has become a joke in the series as well, but Eve is extremely important to how Dante and Vergil are as characters. Dante was saved and Eve did not get to Vergil in time, leaving him to run for his life alone. Vergil took that as he was left behind and had to defend himself hence his quest for power. It’s something many fans (including myself) have looked into before since that feeling of loss from both the demons and his family made him feel worthless. Vergil still holds his family in importance because its fact of why he is around and how much he wanted his mother to love him. On top of that Vergil does admit that he fell in love with a woman in his past. Again, his past love could be another reason for why he wanted new power since he had a family to protect. Vergil simply got lost gaining that new power.\n\nIn a way, Dante’s narrow mindlessness is similar since he has only been getting stronger and even with a new Devil Trigger to boot as well. Power clouds the mind and both of these idiots lost a lot. Dante even mentions he barely remembers any peaceful moments with his brother, he only knows of when they fought. These two never took time to forgive each other, they only kept fighting. This became their method. Even if Vergil finally got to reflect on his past with regret for his quest of power, he still held onto an old desire. V mentions this before fusing back with Urizen, they both hold that feeling to finally win. Dante’s heroism and Vergil’s desires simply just end of clashing with each other every single time while in reality they both share the burden of loss, but there is one to unite them.\n\nThis is the moment when Nero takes his main character slot. Throughout this fifth title, we saw Nero becoming more reckless. Nero sees that power is all that he needs and says that straight to Dante’s face. Dante called him a deadweight before and that just motivated Nero to get stronger in a bad way. Still Nero ends up being caring to others around him since that is how he grew up. He had people to care for him unlike Dante and Vergil who had to live on their own. When Nero learns Vergil is his father, he starts to really question many things. Originally, he was just fighting to prove his mentor wrong, now it became a moment where he could lose family again. Growing up with Kyrie and Credo gave him a family and falling in love with Kyrie became strength for him. The loss of Credo then gives Nero tons of regret, he never forgave himself for it. Now Nero learns who his father is and now he learns that his mentor was an uncle the entire time. Nero tries to accomplish the number one thing that never happened in a Devil May Cry game, to reunite a family.\n\nDevil May Cry 1 and 3 had Dante fighting his brother and even killing him later on. Sparda’s family was forever torn on that faithful day when Eve died. The two brothers took different paths. Dante taking the side of what the hero wanted to save. Vergil took focus on what his father was, a demon and a legend, with a search for power. Nero fought for the thing he never fully had and he is back to do that now since it has been his entire goal in life. Nero lives with what Sparda’s actual legacy is, family. Sparda was a demon who ended up being a hero and yet the most important thing to him was family. He fell in love with a human woman and started one. His sense of justice came from love. Dante did not want to lose anyone close to him, hence why he closed his heart away and acted like the over the top hero. Vergil lost his focus for power even if it could have started with great intent. Nero never strayed from this path and he knocked some sense into these devil boys, to finally forgive each other.\n\nI cannot tell you how much this moment feels for any fan of the series. For me, I started with Nero and got to learn of Dante and his story later on and it feels correct. This is why Nero was taking the main character slot, he finally does the impossible. Nero prevents anyone from dying, the bloodshed is over. Seeing this moment being his awakening to his devil power and saying “Fuck you!” to all of this; is the biggest impact in the entire series. It throws a huge middle finger to a major trope since no one is going to lose here. Nero gets to prove himself in such an important moment of his life. Nero’s final fight with Vergil is beyond great since it’s the son proving he is right while his father needs to prove dominance. Now Dante and Vergil go away for who knows how long, but Nero has gained the possibility of being able to see his family in the future.\n\nHideki Itsuno has mentioned that this could be the end for him and this series. To be honest, this is a perfect end right here. The man who started with the first misstep in the series with the second game, created a legacy for himself. Devil May Cry 3 brought new life into Dante and a fourth game kept the image strong. The reboot happened and only made him more motivated to make this proper return bigger than ever. He even found many ways to tribute the original game something he never worked on because that was Hideki Kamiya. It’s amazing to put it simply. This man creates an ending for a franchise he didn’t even start. At the same time, he put everything into this game. The original motif of family, the sons of Sparda story telling that started with Devil May Cry 3, and finishing the passing of the torch that the previous game started. There are even many aspects of the reboot title with how the game plays and some funny references inserted as well. Itsuno loves this series even if it had missteps before, it only creates passion to do better. Thank you, Itsuno and to all of the teams of Devil May Cry you started a new trend of action games and closed a big book on it.\n\nNow we can truly ask this. Dante will we meet again?\n\nAlright here we are, we get to some great material here. This was a redemption for Hideki Itsuno where his first work was Devil May Cry 2, but that game was not his fault at all. Again being put on the team late in development meant he had to try his best to salvage something. His next appearance with the franchise will be with being the director once more for the third game in the series. Many consider this to be the highest peak of the franchise, sure not in the sales department, but for just being one of the best games not only for Capcom. This is considered the game that started the Character Action genre thanks to many new mechanics for the series. There is going to be a whole lot to cover with this game so I guess we should start with the man himself, Dante.\n\nDante in this game is completely different from his last two appearances. The first Dante acted like a smug superhero and in the sequel he was nearly silent. For the third game; with this being a prequel its the youngest Dante around and man he is a goofball. This started the trend of Dante being the lovable oaf and boy do we love him. Dante keeps the red coat of course and yet he decides to wear no shirt, at least he got pants on. Dante is a reckless youth for sure and with that comes a whole ton of style. Many of Dante’s actions can be seen as less efficient because he loves to drag a fight out and do something cool all the time. The introduction scene proves this since Dante has many foes stab him with their scythes and then he walks off like nothing happened. He proceeds to bust his jukebox to get one track to get him going. Dante eats pizza, slides on his enemies, and even does a Matrix stylized moment with billiard balls. This is one of the best tone establishments for any game around. Dante is no superhero or quiet type, he is loud and destructive!\n\nThis is also where the style goes all out here because there are many ways to be stylish. Dante starts out with four possible styles to play as. There is Trickster where you can dodge attacks with ease, Swordmaster gives you extra moves to use, Gunslinger gives you Devil May Cry 2’s gun mechanics with some extra flair, and Royalguard gives you a parry move that can also be used as an attack. The amount of options you got here is insane and sadly you can only be one at a time until you get to a new level or to the statues where you can change everything. The additions of new weapons are back and extremely varied. Of course Dante as his Rebellion which actually started in DMC2, the design here though is the one we know and love. Cerberus is the triple ice nunchuck that gets many hits in. Agni and Rudra are dual swords with elemental properties of fire and wind that gives you tons of movement attacks. Nevan an electric guitar weapon that can shoot projectiles and pillars of volts! Finally, we get to Beowolf a weapon with light properties that are the usual gauntlet weapons. The weapon selection is diverse here and with having two at all times to freely switch to, the experimentation is large. On top of that this is the game where the Devil Triggers became extremely popular. With help from the lead designer from the Shin Megami Tensei series we got amazing demonic looks for both Dante and his rival for this game.\n\nSo with Dante we easily got more fluid controls and freedom to do whatever you want and there are still two styles to use later on. The amount of things Dante got in this game is insane. For the most of his journey in this game, Dante is not a good person, like at all. We still end up loving him though because we see the tragedy he is living and it only gets worse later on. In the end though, Dante keep his smile and finds a true path to follow which we soon get to how he is like in the first game and his next appearance in the fourth game. Dante might be doing the unthinkable and yet still comes off an understandable character with flaws we can relate to. He deals with the death of his mother in an uncontrollable manner. He is only eighteen and who knows what he has been doing before those years. Taking revenge in the fun way was the best option for Dante since he needed to cope. With the first Dante, we loved him for being a silly hero. While still silly he became more relatable and those moments when he starts to become the hero feels enlightening and rewarding, since his biggest challenge is no joke in this game.\n\nWell time to gush about one of gaming’s greatest rival characters around. Like the hell with Gary Oak, it’s all about Vergil! Vergil has been shown in the series before when he was Nelo Angelo. We did not get a whole lot from him in that since he was being used by Mundus. This is Vergil’s true introduction to the series and it was a strong one, so strong that the reboot had to cash on this by making their own Vergil. It’s insane that he got this much love simply from one game, I’m not kidding. Sure Vergil got to be playable later on in DMC 3’s and 4’s special editions, but those happened later. The reason why Vergil worked so well was his relation to Dante and how similar they were and yet so different.\n\nThe first thing to notice with Vergil is his first scene where he kills the big reaper monster with one slice. This was technically the first boss in the game and many people had trouble with him when DMC3 first launched in the States since the difficulties were lying to them. The normal mode was actually on hard which I bet got people angry and getting good really fast. Dante wastes so much time with attacking demons and Vergil does the complete opposite. So high chance people will think Vergil is silent with his quick fighting style. Quite the different actually, he is stoic for sure, but not quiet. Hell, Vergil even has his own funny lines, he is just rather dry with his approach. On top of that both Dante and Vergil are young and still act like kids in many ways. They did not grow up properly as mentioned before.\n\nDante and Vergil lost their mother at a young age and with both of them, they wanted revenge. Dante made his business to hopefully find the demon one day, but in the end he soon made his business more about the people. Dante got to see what his father’s (Sparda) legacy does to other people and Dante felt responsible for that. With Vergil he focused on his revenge only and while selfish for sure, Vergil had a true purpose to fight unlike Dante in the beginning. Vergil made sure he did not want to feel that pain again and to do that he needed to become more powerful. Vergil aimed for his father’s legacy to make himself stronger so that he can prevent the pain he felt as a child. I feel many people ignore this side of Vergil and think of him as a bland character and yet that is not the case. Vergil is deeply wounded inside and while Dante hides it with silly antics, Vergil hides it with a stone cold face. These are two brothers fighting not only themselves, but are even fighting the pain in their hearts.\n\nSo with these two clashing not only in battle, but personalities this got to make a very amazing set of boss fights for Vergil. Oddly enough just like with Nelo Angelo you fought him three times. The third game repeats this and the scaling to them are amazing. Dante with no purpose loses the fight, when awakened with new powers he can stay toe to toe with Vergil, and then with a purpose in his heart he finally defeats Vergil. All three fights are huge stables for the franchise, especially the second fight because still to this day that second theme for Vergil is being remixed as we speak. The interactions of the protagonist and his foil are so important to any story. It’s amazing how in the early days people just knocked on Devil May Cry’s story and yet there is true structure here and gripping characters, which reminds me of a certain… Lady.\n\nMary who soon goes with the name Lady after she moves on from her past, is another big fan favorite in the series. With how Lady was used in this game was important since she is the sole reason why Dante got to see what trouble has been brewing up. Lady herself comes with family issues where her father wanted Sparda’s powers and did everything he could for that. This lead to the death of Lady’s mother and soon getting Lady packing heat for revenge. The comparisons to Lady and Trish are easy to note since they are female characters that help our main character. Trish reminded Dante of his mother and got Dante to express mercy after who knows how many years of demon slaying. Lady got to show Dante how important finding a purpose is and to defend people from the true horrors caused by his family. Lady with her lovely assortment of guns really showcases the first time a pure human can really fight in the hard task of demon slaying. Her best weapon the Kaliana Ann is a fan favorite weapon and even has a new version of it the upcoming fifth game. The giant rocket launcher is durable and explosive. This become more important later on in the fourth game as well since she was not all that present in the original version, Lady got to be playable later on.\n\nWhich comes to probably the most important part of why Devil May Cry 3 is so awesome, the beginning of an amazing cast. Ruben Lagden comes to play as Dante and fans loved his performance. The same for Daniel Southworth playing Vergil. When the motion capturing became a big thing for this game, they had to make sure to get actors that are ready for some stunts. Ruben even made sure to get someone like Southworth since he has experience with stunt acting before during his times with Power Rangers. The motion capturing really brought these characters to life and the scene directing was top-notch too. A big thing that ends up happening is that many moves end up coming from the scenes. Dante sliding on foes, Lady and Dante shooting each other’s bullets, and Vergil deflecting bullets with his sword. This game established the idea of making sure to make a scene with a move that can be done in the game. Hell you can even see Dante use Lady’s motorcycle as a weapon which is now a thing in the fifth game! So this mindset is still living on to this day.\n\nThis game even comes with many secrets that would be unable to pull off in today’s gaming age. One of Dante’s styles is the Doppleganger where he can summon a copy of himself to fight with. If you had a second controller plugged in and activate this mode, a second player can control the clone. The same even happens when Vergil fights alongside Dante which is funny to see Vergil being playable come in a later edition of the game since he could be used in the base game for a short moment. Devil May Cry 3 even continued the secret missions and a whole lot better this time around and did it in the original game’s fashion. Challenges that vary between fighting and knowing the game. This game also has a boss rush stage and its rewarding to fight bosses with all you got and you can do this whenever too. The game comes with a stage select as soon as you beat level one. You can easily grind and train on level one as long as you need to. The game while being challenging is never unforgiving since it gives you so many options to not only go back and play again and find new secrets and methods to fight hard bosses or simply kill enemies in more stylish flair.\n\nOverall it is no wonder why Devil May Cry 3 is a special game. Things could only get higher after the sequel and while it did not sell as well, the legacy this game has lived on longer for sure. This started a trend of Character Action games including the fourth game of the series. Also this was the era where Capcom had everybody following them. When Resident Evil 4 happened, everyone was doing the third person shooter. Then with Devil May Cry 3, everyone wanted to make an awesome action game. Devil May Cry 3 holds a big image with its Dante being a reckless youth being challenged by his twin brother who easily set himself forward more than Dante. Along with them was a feisty lady that got to show the strength of humans. The production on this game is special thanks to memorable performances and insane action pieces. Things should only get better after this since Devil May Cry finally gets to be on more than one platform with its fourth game and with it comes a new face.\n\nThis is not going to be an easy one. With the beginning of Devil May Cry, it is easy to define what makes it cool thanks to Hideki Kamiya putting his ideal of cool into the game. This sequel right here is an interesting one to look at. Sadly, Hideki Kamiya did not work on this title even though he was still working with Capcom. High chance Viewtiful Joe was taking his time. So, for this second game featuring the demon hunter Dante was handled by a new team. Development was not going well though and this was Hideki Itsuno’s first DMC title under his belt when he was thrown onto this project as the director. Poor Itsuno was tossed into a bad game from the start because knowing that the game was still slated for its original release date and have to get a full game done at the halfway mark already gone, there was no way of saving this game. Itsuno has talked about how when he was thrown into the project one of the few things that was fully done was the move Stinger. Still a big thing with this game is that the developers took notes from the fans’ responses to the first game and used it for number 2. What did people want and did they get it?\n\nFor the character Dante, fans grown to love his silly behavior that started from the first game. Now what we got in Devil May Cry 3 and 4 is still different from the original Dante. The original Dante as mentioned before acts like a Toksatsu hero which is something Kamiya has a soft spot for. Let us bring up one of the glaring problems of the original Dante though, his lines. Now this could have been because of translation errors or being translated too accurately and not changing them to fit English better, but who really knows. All I know the light about darkness reaching someone’s heart is up there with Zero’s “What am I fighting for?!” for one of the funniest moments in a Capcom game. Maybe some people had issues with that line or other lines possibly. The reason I bring this up is because Dante is mostly silent in the sequel. While this is a drastic change to the character can a silent protagonist be cool? The answer to that is yes, there have been many famous characters that barely speak a line, especially in video games. To be honest though I feel like Dante is tapping into a different type of media hero for this game and a good way to find that out is to look at some certain weapons.\n\nThose weapons are sadly not the swords because well there are just swords for new weapons, but there are many different types of guns still around and these things are broken. A big problem people had with the original game was that the guns were too weak. The sequel decided to make the guns stronger and they got some major steroids injected into them. This game also added some free aiming functions which oddly enough still continues to this day. Dante can shoot in all directions and he has some insane things with his guns in both gameplay and cutscenes. With this focus on the guns, could Dante be more focused on a Western hero, like cowboys and gunslingers? One character that comes to mind for me with this mentality of not talking all that much, but has some insane gun play would be The Man with No Name. Again, this is proving that having a character being silent is not impossible and conveying greatness can simply come from body language. DMC 2 simply tried to make Dante a different type of cool and while it did not work, people still love this design for Dante to this day. This design even got into Shin MegamiTensei 3. So, what is the reason why a silent Dante does not work?\n\nA big reason to bring up is that this game try to make lightning strike twice. Trish was a popular character and had high demand to be playable. There is a Trish option in the game, but in reality, her spotlight gets taken by a new female character, Lucia. With Lucia she happens to be a created being made by the villain of this game. If this sound familiar well that is because Trish was created by Mundus to lure Dante. While Trish had reason to be a created creature was that Dante still had trouble striking her down and had hope for her. Trish ends up becoming a better person and not a devil, because “Devils never cry.” This line is even repeated with Lucia when she tells Dante to kill her and she sheds a tear. So not only does it feel that Dante is not giving his all, the overall game’s presentation isn’t either. Everything just comes across as boring.\n\nWhile a new character is playable her effect on the series was not a strong one. I get that the idea of twin swords and throwing weapons such as knives and grenades fits Devil May Cry well enough, but again DMC 2 just fails at the concept. I mean you can even look at Lucia’s design and see she has a reverse color palette compared to Dante. Dante with white hair and a red outfit compared to the red haired, Lucia wearing a white outfit. I see the parallel here and I think they wanted to try and make a new female be more comparable to Dante this time around. Sadly, Dante in this game is near mute and Lucia comes off as a half-baked character. The lack of lines does not help at all too. So, can Lucia be considered cool? She has her own version of a Devil Trigger which has a nice design being an angelic looking demon. Another interesting concept to work with, but again just never comes to full fruition. At least Bayonetta gave us the female Dante we needed.\n\nFor weapons… yea the variety is gone this time for something a bit simpler to wrap around. I am not sure if this was an asked for thing, but high chance this was just because of time restraints more than anything else. Dante gets three swords and five guns, Lucia gets three sets of swords and five throwable weapons, and Trish has Sparda. Yes, oddly enough Trish using Sparda started here and she can do her famous toss with that weapon here too. This is going to be a point I will bring up when we get to another game in the series about making things easier. While being easy can be good for new players sometimes it gets rid of some flashy aspects. Back in the days people could not making everything a quick time event. The original DMC had so much charm because it had flair that even I am still amazed could have been done on the Playstation 2. So, making things easier this time around really ends up making the sequel shallower than anything. Sword combos were too simple and guns just broke the game where Dante can just stand still most of the time. The whole idea of Dante moving around constantly and changing into a completely different weapon is gone. Now these days we have easy combat that looks flashy and people will praise that even if it’s the same thing as just pressing one button over and over again with no variety.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI am going to make some enemies here.\n\nWhat is there left to say for Devil May Cry 2, it was a train wreck from the start with the idea of having a different team work on this. I feel like if this project was just given to Kamiya and his team, this sequel would have been better. In the end though, this game ended up leading to much more than any would think. Future games in this series took notes from it and even expanding on the gun mechanics. There are even rumors among fans that the second game is going to be canon thanks to Devil May Cry 5. Hideki Itsuno did start out with a dud game, but he never fully forgot it. He ended up taking ideas and using them for other sequels which leads us to the third game of the series. Devil May Cry 3, the game that started the Character Action genre as we know it and is arguably not only the best Devil May Cry game, but another one of Capcom’s royal pieces of treasure.\n\nI am also going through DMC2 right now on my LP channel.\n\nDMC2 Playlist"
