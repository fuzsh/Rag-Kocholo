        "text": "With so many new games and movies coming out, it can be hard to keep up. Lucky for you, IGN is here to help with a weekly round-up of the biggest releases each and every week. Check out the latest releases for this week, and be sure to come back next Monday for a new update. Note: The prices and deals compiled below are accurate at the time we published this story, but all are subject to change.\n\nDevil\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $23.99 with Prime (PS4 or Xbox One)\n\nThis action-packed set chronicles the first three adventures of Dante, the world's toughest demon slayer. Included are Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 2, and Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening.\n\nBurnout\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $31.99 with Prime (PS4 or Xbox One)\n\nThe fifth entry in the gonzo racing series, Burnout Paradise gives players license to wreak havoc in Paradise City, the ultimate racing battleground, with a massive infrastructure of traffic-heavy roads to abuse. Gone is the need to jump in and out of menus and aimlessly search for fun like many open world games; in Burnout Paradise, every inch of the world is built to deliver heart-stopping Burnout-style gameplay. Every intersection is a potential crash junction and every alleyway is an opportunity to rack up moving violations. Feel the adrenaline course through your veins as you take to the road for the first time in Paradise City, where the action is all around you. Explore the city, discover events, and look for the best opportunities to crash, jump and pull signature takedowns. In Burnout Paradise you are given the keys to the city, but it's up to you to earn the keys to the meanest and most dangerous cars on the street, and earn your Burnout license.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $19.96 (Blu-ray)\n\nFrom our Review: While not as powerful as his Spanish language classics Pan’s Labyrinth and The Devil’s Backbone, The Shape of Water is director Guillermo del Toro’s strongest Hollywood film to date. It’s a visually and emotionally engrossing fable, one that synthesizes so many of this unique filmmaker’s peculiar tastes and diverse artistic influences. It is a fairy tale, a monster movie, a Noir, a social commentary, and a valentine to the Golden Age of Hollywood, but above all else, it is a love story.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nJustice\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $24.96 (Blu-ray)\n\nFrom our Review: The best aspects of Justice League are the chemistry between its cast and the film’s individual depiction of each superhero. Unlike in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, these characters, Batman included, are decidedly heroic instead of unlikable and impersonal. They make an effort to save civilians and spare lives, and, ahem, come together to help each other. Justice League has some good moments and some bad ones, but it ultimately ekes out just enough entertainment value to warrant a look-see.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nFerdinand\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $19.96 (Blu-ray)\n\nFrom our Review: The pitch for Ferdinand is simple. Like so many other classic kids movies and stories from throughout time, it all stems from the idea of a character born into a certain kind of world or family, but with the unique desire to do the complete opposite of what that world or family says they must. What happens if a rat doesn’t want to steal food, but wants to cook? Or, as in the case of Ferdinand, what if a bull doesn’t want to spend his life fighting matadors in a ring? What if, instead, he’d rather spend his days smelling flowers and rolling through hills?\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nI,\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $19.96 (Blu-ray)\n\nFrom our Review: Okay, pop quiz: What do you actually know about Tonya Harding?\n\nAssuming you were around in the 1990s and actually remember who Tonya Harding is, you can probably only recall a handful of the major bullet points. Tonya Harding was an Olympic figure skater. She was at least partially responsible for a violent assault on one of her competitors, Nancy Kerrigan. She was all anyone could talk about in 1994, before fading into relative obscurity. (You might also recall that she co-starred in the 1996 low budget action movie Breakaway, but let’s be honest, you probably don’t.)\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nCall\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $19.96 (Blu-ray)\n\nFrom our Review: If you’ve ever wanted to spend an entire summer at an Italian villa hanging out with Armie Hammer, just swimming, reading, listening to New Wave music and wearing extremely fetching and comfortable clothes, then have I got a movie for you.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $19.99 (Blu-ray)\n\nFrom our Review: There are good movies, there are bad movies, there are awful movies, and then there’s The Room, a movie so mind-explodingly incompetent that it feels like it shouldn’t exist. James Franco’s new film The Disaster Artist reveals the strange but (apparently) true story of how the worst movie ever made actually got made, and it’s an unusually heartwarming ode to outsider art.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nSee it on Steam for $26.99 (PC)\n\nAlso downloadable on PS4 or Xbox One\n\nThe Council is an episodic game that delivers a fresh new take on the narrative adventure genre, where gameplay comes from manipulating and maneuvering through character encounters using the unique Social Influence system. Make hard-hitting decisions, develop an array of skills, and directly impact how the story unfolds. The consequences are permanent and may result in persistent physical disfigurements or mental traits that help or hinder the rest of the player’s adventure. With permanent, long-lasting consequences, there is no going back. Plunge into a tale of intrigue and manipulation in the style of a classic murder mystery, interacting with a cast of alluring characters each hiding their own dark secrets. Trust no one while uncovering dire truths -- no matter the cost to mind and body.\n\nThe Council begins in 1793, with players taking the role of secret society member Louis de Richet after he was invited to a private island off the shores of England by the enigmatic Lord Mortimer. Joining him are a number of high profile guests, including Napoleon Bonaparte and President of the newly-formed United States of America George Washington. The strange nature of this private reception goes beyond just the prestigious guests -- Richet’s own mother has recently gone missing on the island, while each member of the colorful cast seems to have their own hidden agendas.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nCoffin\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, March 13, 2018\n\nDownloadable on Nintendo Switch\n\nCoffin Dodgers sees you take on the role of saving one of seven quirky retirement village residents, each racing for their soul in \"pimped up\" mobility scooters against none other than the Grim Reaper himself. Our old heroes are armed with a variety of homemade weapons and gadgets to take on anything the Grim Reaper and his Zombie army may throw at them. Can you survive the retirement village?\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nKirby\n\nRelease Date: Friday, March 16, 2018\n\nSee it on Amazon for $47.99 with Prime (Nintendo Switch)\n\nIn Kirby Star Allies, the ever-friendly puffball can recruit enemies by hitting them with hearts to gather a party of up to four characters, or join with up to three friends for co-op play. Kirby can even combine copy abilities to create combo attacks for defeating enemies and solving puzzles.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nLucas M.
