        "text": "Few video game directors have a résumé like Viewtiful Joe and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya. On top of those titles, he’s also well known for creating and directing the original Devil May Cry, and directing Resident Evil 2 during his time at Capcom. Now the director, who is never afraid to voice his opinion (or block fans that don’t read his previous answers) on Twitter, has commented on both Devil May Cry 3 and 4.\n\nWhile his answers were short, Kamiya made sure to compliment Devil May Cry 3. “Nice scenario,” he commented. He didn’t have praise to give Devil May Cry 4, however, and instead decided to complain about its infamous dice game. “Dice thing is SHIT,” wrote Kamiya.\n\nCheck out Hideki Kamiya’s full tweet below:\n\nIf you’re failing to remember what the “dice thing” is, it’s a mini-game featured twice in Devil May Cry 4. In both chapters 6 and 19, Nero uses a mysterious die in order to move of “your other self” around. The statue can land on various colored platforms, and the player has to survive enemies & other hazards during this time. It was widely criticized by many fans, especially at higher difficulties, although there are ways to manipulate the dice game. In one of DMC4‘s better moments, Dante winds up chopping the dice block in half, and bypasses the entire mini-game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oi-00QPQAA\n\nDevil May Cry 4 is available now on PlayStation 4, while fans will have to use their PlayStation 3 if they want to play the HD collection version of Devil May Cry 3.\n\nDo you agree with Hideki Kamiya? Let us know in the comments below."
