        "text": "The summer 2024 anime season is now here, but there's plenty to look forward to as we creep towards the fall season. We've recently had new release dates for Blue Lock season 2, Dandadan, and Look Back, to name but a few in October.\n\nBut, beyond that, what else is there on the horizon? To help cut through the noise, we've put together a complete guide to the dozens of new and ongoing anime in 2024, as well as a look back at every major series that aired or debuted this year. Need more to look forward to? There's major Netflix titles such as Arcane and The Witcher to also keep an eye on.\n\nFirst, you’ll find everything in a brief list by order of release date. Then, we’ll dig into each a little more – why you should be excited, and a snapshot of all their major release and streaming details – in the alphabetical list a little further down.\n\nReady? Below, you’ll find almost 50 titles, with big names mixed in with old favorites like Dragon Ball. There are ongoing series, new adaptations, and so much more. You might just find your next favorite anime. It’s all here in our guide to new anime in 2024.\n\nOnce you’re done, be sure to check out our list of best anime and best anime shows on Netflix, plus the latest on four major names coming soon: Jujutsu Kaisen season 3, the Chainsaw Man movie, Demon Slayer Infinity Castle movie trilogy, and One-Punch Man season 3.\n\nNew anime in 2024\n\nJust a quick note before we start: anime is traditionally divided into four seasons: winter (January-March), spring (April-June), summer (July-September), and fall (October-December).\n\nWe've also kept old release dates below so you have a full calendar you can refer back to throughout the year.\n\nNetflix has also given us a glimpse of the year ahead with its Netflix anime 2024 trailer.\n\nOngoing anime and released anime in 2024\n\nBlood of Zeus season 2 (out now)\n\nBlue Exorcist season 3 (out now)\n\nClassroom of the Elite season 3 (out now)\n\nDelicious in Dungeon (out now)\n\nFrieren Beyond Journey’s End (out now)\n\nKingdom season 5 (out now)\n\nMaboroshi (out now) [MOVIE]\n\nMasters of the Universe: Revolution (out now)\n\nOne Piece: Egghead (out now)\n\nSolo Leveling (out now)\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins: Four Knights of the Apocalypse (out now)\n\nPokemon Horizons: The Series (March 7, 2024 in US)\n\nSand Land (March 20, 2024)\n\nRe: Monster (April 4, 2024)\n\nThat Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime season 3 (April 5, 2024)\n\nMushoku Tensei season 2, part 2 (April 7, 2024)\n\nThe Fable (April 7, 2024)\n\nKaiju No. 8 (April 13, 2024)\n\nMy Hero Academia season 7 (May 4, 2024) - ongoing\n\nDemon Slayer season 4 (May 12, 2024)\n\nHaikyuu the Movie: Battle at the Garbage Dump (May 31, 2024) [MOVIE]\n\nBaki Hanma vs. Kengan Ashura (June 6, 2024) [MOVIE]\n\nUltraman: Rising (June 14, 2024) [MOVIE]\n\nCode Geass: Roze of the Recapture (June 21, 2024)\n\nRising Impact (June 22, 2024)\n\nSuicide Squad Isekai (June 27, 2024)\n\nBlue Lock: Episode Nagi (June 28, 2024) [MOVIE]\n\nThe Imaginary (June 28, 2024) [MOVIE]\n\nMy Deer Friend Nokotan (July 3, 2024)\n\nOshi no Ko season 2 (July 3, 2024)\n\nNier: Automata Ver1.1a (July 5, 2024)\n\nTower of God season 2 (July 7, 2024)\n\nWistoria: Wand and Sword (July 7, 2024)\n\nT-P BON season 2 (July 17, 2024)\n\nFrom Me to You season 3 (August 1, 2024)\n\nKengan Ashura season 2 part 2 (August 15, 2024)\n\nRick and Morty anime (August 15, 2024)\n\nTerminator Zero (August 29, 2024)\n\nOverlord: The Sacred Kingdom (September 20, 2024 in Japan)\n\nUzumaki (September 28, 2024)\n\nDandadan (October 3, 2024)\n\nLook Back (October 4, 2024 in Japan) [MOVIE]\n\nBlue Lock season 2 (October 5, 2024)\n\nTomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft (October 10, 2024)\n\nMy Hero Academia: You're Next (October 11, 2024)\n\nBleach Thousand-Year Blood War part 3 (October 2024)\n\nAttack on Titan The Movie: The Last Attack (November 8, 2024 in Japan) [MOVIE]\n\nArcane season 2 (November 2024)\n\nDragon Ball Daima (Fall 2024)\n\nThe Witcher: Sirens of the Deep (late 2024)\n\nBeastars season 3 (December 2024)\n\nDevil May Cry (2024)\n\nMoonrise (2024)\n\nOne Punch Man season 3 (TBC)\n\nAnime shows out in 2024\n\nBelow is nearly every major upcoming anime show out in 2024. It ranges from Netflix's upcoming slate of video game entries - Devil May Cry and Tomb Raider both feature - to some old favorites and new faces.\n\nWe're starting in alphabetical order and that means beginning with perhaps this year's most hotly anticipated anime: Arcane season 2.\n\nArcane season 2\n\nRelease date: November 2024\n\nWhere to watch Arcane season 2: Netflix\n\nArcane, the anime set in the League of Legends universe, was a smash hit upon its release in November 2021. Three years on, we’re finally getting the fallout to the conflict between the cities of Piltover and Zaun – and the two sisters caught in the middle: Vi (Hailee Steinfeld) and Jinx (Ella Purnell). An Arcane season 2 trailer was released earlier in 2024, teasing a \"nightmarish augmentation\" and a major storyline for Singed. A new poster has also emerged, featuring a reversal of Vi and Jinx's relationship...\n\nBeastars season 3\n\nRelease date: December 2024\n\nWhere to watch Beastars season 3: Netflix\n\n2024 marks the year where we say goodbye to Beastars, the anime set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, looking at the rising tensions between carnivores and herbivores. The series focuses on the affable grey wolf Legoshi and his complicated relationship with rabbit Haru at the Cherryton school.\n\nBleach: Thousand-Year Blood War part 3\n\nRelease date: October 2024\n\nWhere to watch Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War part 3: Hulu/Disney Plus\n\nYes, Bleach is still going and, yes, it's still amazing. The adaptation of the final arc continues and sees Ichigo return for 'The Conflict'. The first trailer was released at Jump Festa and offers up a scintillating teaser for the upcoming battle between our protagonist and Wandenreich's emperor Yhwach.\n\nBlood of Zeus season 2\n\nRelease date: Out now\n\nWhere to watch Blood of Zeus season 2: Netflix\n\nAfter the twin-related twist at the end of the first season, Blood of Zeus is set to be an epic addition to Netflix's burgeoning anime collection. With Heron still reeling and the gods gunning for the son of Zeus, it's all available for an Olympus-sized binge with season 2 now on Netflix\n\nBlue Exorcist season 3\n\nRelease date: Finished airing\n\nWhere to watch Blue Exorcist season 3: Crunchyroll\n\nBlue Exorcist fans sure have been patient. The first season premiered way back in 2011 and the second season arrived in 2017. After another long break, the new season will continue the saga of Rin, the son of Satan. Expect more brutal cliffhangers and surprises as we return to True Cross Academy.\n\nBlue Exorcist adapted the Shimane Illuminati Saga, with all new episodes now available on Crunchyroll.\n\nBlue Lock season 2\n\nRelease date: October 5, 2024\n\nWhere to watch Blue Lock season 2: Crunchyroll\n\nBlue Lock has a spin-off movie out this year (see more below for that), but there's also a new season to look forward to.\n\nDon't expect a Jose Mourinho-style second season syndrome here, however. The soccer anime aims to hit the heights of its initial run, which saw fledgling forward Isagi form part of Japan's hilariously overblown new project to find a star striker - by putting hundreds of students through their paces in a prison-style structure. The new season will adapt the manga's Japan U-20 arc, which sees the Blue Lock contenders pit their skills against Japan's youngest, most prodigious talents.\n\nCode Geass: Roze of the Recapture\n\nRelease date: June 21, 2024\n\nSet after the events of the acclaimed Lelouch of the Resurrection, Roze of the Recapture will supposedly be the first of a multi-part saga. Roze will be played by the prolific voice actor Kohei Amasaki. Little else is known about the project's story, however.\n\nThe first part of Code Geass: Rozé of the Recapture will launch on Disney Plus on June 21, 2024.\n\nClassroom of the Elite season 3\n\nRelease date: Finished\n\nWhere to watch Classroom of the Elite season 3: Crunchyroll\n\nAs the name might suggest, Classroom of the Elite focuses on the cohort of the Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School, a facility designed to nurture the best and brightest Japan has to offer. Unfortunately for newcomer Kiyotaka, he's in class 1-D - 'D' for 'Defective'. The third season rounded out the manga's arc that covers the first school year.\n\nDandadan\n\nRelease date: October 3, 2024\n\nWhere to watch Dandadan: Netflix/Crunchyroll\n\nCould this be the next big anime in 2024? Dandadan has sold over 3 million copies and its odd premise - Momo and Okarun, who believe in spirits and UFOs respectively, before coming into contact with poltergeists and extraterrestrials amid a budding romance - has proven to be a hit with readers. It's all set to release this October.\n\nDelicious in Dungeon\n\nRelease date: Ongoing\n\nWhere to watch Delicious in Dungeon: Netflix\n\nThis year started off piping hot with Delicious in Dungeon, a kooky anime series that centres on the bid to rescue adventurer Falin from the belly of the beast - literally.

Not caught up? You're missing out. It tells the story of Ohma Takita, a modern-day gladiator who enters tournaments just for the love of fighting and decimating his opponents.

Needless to say, we'll keep it brief: the anime focuses on two twins who find themselves embroiled in the world of pop idols, all deliciously wrapped up in a murder mystery. The second season is setting up to be a must-watch, in our eyes.\n\nPokemon Horizons: The Series\n\nRelease date: Out now\n\nWhere to watch Pokemon Horizons: The Series: Netflix\n\nSo long, Ash!

Unfortunately for Fable, being surrounded by the criminal class might prove a little too hard to ignore...\n\nThe Seven Deadly Sins: Four Knights of the Apocalypse\n\nRelease date: Out now\n\nWhere to watch The Seven Deadly Sins: Four Knights of the Apocalypse: Netflix\n\nThe sequel to The Seven Deadly Sins takes place several years after the defeat of the Demon King.

What's not to like?\n\nUzumaki\n\nRelease date: September 28, 2024\n\nWhere to watch Uzumaki: Toonami/Adult Swim\n\nIt's about time this list had a bit more of a horror flavor.

It focuses on a baseball player moonlighting as the superhero, who suddenly has to look after kaiju offspring after defeating its mother. The new poster showcases the loveable baby, as well as revealing a June release date.\n\nAnime out beyond 2024\n\nThis next small batch are among the biggest names on the list but are almost certainly not coming out in 2024. Still, they're worth mentioning here so we can give you the full picture.\n\nChainsaw Man - The Movie: Reze Arc\n\nIn a slight surprise, Chainsaw Man isn't getting a second season - not yet, anyway.

The hype surrounding the show had died down a little but an incredible new trailer not only increased our expectations, it also suggests we could be seeing One-Punch Man season 3 on our screens very soon."
