        "text": "Alright here we are, we get to some great material here. This was a redemption for Hideki Itsuno where his first work was Devil May Cry 2, but that game was not his fault at all. Again being put on the team late in development meant he had to try his best to salvage something. His next appearance with the franchise will be with being the director once more for the third game in the series. Many consider this to be the highest peak of the franchise, sure not in the sales department, but for just being one of the best games not only for Capcom. This is considered the game that started the Character Action genre thanks to many new mechanics for the series. There is going to be a whole lot to cover with this game so I guess we should start with the man himself, Dante.\n\nDante in this game is completely different from his last two appearances. The first Dante acted like a smug superhero and in the sequel he was nearly silent. For the third game; with this being a prequel its the youngest Dante around and man he is a goofball. This started the trend of Dante being the lovable oaf and boy do we love him. Dante keeps the red coat of course and yet he decides to wear no shirt, at least he got pants on. Dante is a reckless youth for sure and with that comes a whole ton of style. Many of Dante’s actions can be seen as less efficient because he loves to drag a fight out and do something cool all the time. The introduction scene proves this since Dante has many foes stab him with their scythes and then he walks off like nothing happened. He proceeds to bust his jukebox to get one track to get him going. Dante eats pizza, slides on his enemies, and even does a Matrix stylized moment with billiard balls. This is one of the best tone establishments for any game around. Dante is no superhero or quiet type, he is loud and destructive!\n\nThis is also where the style goes all out here because there are many ways to be stylish. Dante starts out with four possible styles to play as. There is Trickster where you can dodge attacks with ease, Swordmaster gives you extra moves to use, Gunslinger gives you Devil May Cry 2’s gun mechanics with some extra flair, and Royalguard gives you a parry move that can also be used as an attack. The amount of options you got here is insane and sadly you can only be one at a time until you get to a new level or to the statues where you can change everything. The additions of new weapons are back and extremely varied. Of course Dante as his Rebellion which actually started in DMC2, the design here though is the one we know and love. Cerberus is the triple ice nunchuck that gets many hits in. Agni and Rudra are dual swords with elemental properties of fire and wind that gives you tons of movement attacks. Nevan an electric guitar weapon that can shoot projectiles and pillars of volts! Finally, we get to Beowolf a weapon with light properties that are the usual gauntlet weapons. The weapon selection is diverse here and with having two at all times to freely switch to, the experimentation is large. On top of that this is the game where the Devil Triggers became extremely popular. With help from the lead designer from the Shin Megami Tensei series we got amazing demonic looks for both Dante and his rival for this game.\n\nSo with Dante we easily got more fluid controls and freedom to do whatever you want and there are still two styles to use later on. The amount of things Dante got in this game is insane. For the most of his journey in this game, Dante is not a good person, like at all. We still end up loving him though because we see the tragedy he is living and it only gets worse later on. In the end though, Dante keep his smile and finds a true path to follow which we soon get to how he is like in the first game and his next appearance in the fourth game. Dante might be doing the unthinkable and yet still comes off an understandable character with flaws we can relate to. He deals with the death of his mother in an uncontrollable manner. He is only eighteen and who knows what he has been doing before those years. Taking revenge in the fun way was the best option for Dante since he needed to cope. With the first Dante, we loved him for being a silly hero. While still silly he became more relatable and those moments when he starts to become the hero feels enlightening and rewarding, since his biggest challenge is no joke in this game.\n\nWell time to gush about one of gaming’s greatest rival characters around. Like the hell with Gary Oak, it’s all about Vergil! Vergil has been shown in the series before when he was Nelo Angelo. We did not get a whole lot from him in that since he was being used by Mundus. This is Vergil’s true introduction to the series and it was a strong one, so strong that the reboot had to cash on this by making their own Vergil. It’s insane that he got this much love simply from one game, I’m not kidding. Sure Vergil got to be playable later on in DMC 3’s and 4’s special editions, but those happened later. The reason why Vergil worked so well was his relation to Dante and how similar they were and yet so different.\n\nThe first thing to notice with Vergil is his first scene where he kills the big reaper monster with one slice. This was technically the first boss in the game and many people had trouble with him when DMC3 first launched in the States since the difficulties were lying to them. The normal mode was actually on hard which I bet got people angry and getting good really fast. Dante wastes so much time with attacking demons and Vergil does the complete opposite. So high chance people will think Vergil is silent with his quick fighting style. Quite the different actually, he is stoic for sure, but not quiet. Hell, Vergil even has his own funny lines, he is just rather dry with his approach. On top of that both Dante and Vergil are young and still act like kids in many ways. They did not grow up properly as mentioned before.\n\nDante and Vergil lost their mother at a young age and with both of them, they wanted revenge. Dante made his business to hopefully find the demon one day, but in the end he soon made his business more about the people. Dante got to see what his father’s (Sparda) legacy does to other people and Dante felt responsible for that. With Vergil he focused on his revenge only and while selfish for sure, Vergil had a true purpose to fight unlike Dante in the beginning. Vergil made sure he did not want to feel that pain again and to do that he needed to become more powerful. Vergil aimed for his father’s legacy to make himself stronger so that he can prevent the pain he felt as a child. I feel many people ignore this side of Vergil and think of him as a bland character and yet that is not the case. Vergil is deeply wounded inside and while Dante hides it with silly antics, Vergil hides it with a stone cold face. These are two brothers fighting not only themselves, but are even fighting the pain in their hearts.\n\nSo with these two clashing not only in battle, but personalities this got to make a very amazing set of boss fights for Vergil. Oddly enough just like with Nelo Angelo you fought him three times. The third game repeats this and the scaling to them are amazing. Dante with no purpose loses the fight, when awakened with new powers he can stay toe to toe with Vergil, and then with a purpose in his heart he finally defeats Vergil. All three fights are huge stables for the franchise, especially the second fight because still to this day that second theme for Vergil is being remixed as we speak. The interactions of the protagonist and his foil are so important to any story. It’s amazing how in the early days people just knocked on Devil May Cry’s story and yet there is true structure here and gripping characters, which reminds me of a certain… Lady.\n\nMary who soon goes with the name Lady after she moves on from her past, is another big fan favorite in the series. With how Lady was used in this game was important since she is the sole reason why Dante got to see what trouble has been brewing up. Lady herself comes with family issues where her father wanted Sparda’s powers and did everything he could for that. This lead to the death of Lady’s mother and soon getting Lady packing heat for revenge. The comparisons to Lady and Trish are easy to note since they are female characters that help our main character. Trish reminded Dante of his mother and got Dante to express mercy after who knows how many years of demon slaying. Lady got to show Dante how important finding a purpose is and to defend people from the true horrors caused by his family. Lady with her lovely assortment of guns really showcases the first time a pure human can really fight in the hard task of demon slaying. Her best weapon the Kaliana Ann is a fan favorite weapon and even has a new version of it the upcoming fifth game. The giant rocket launcher is durable and explosive. This become more important later on in the fourth game as well since she was not all that present in the original version, Lady got to be playable later on.\n\nWhich comes to probably the most important part of why Devil May Cry 3 is so awesome, the beginning of an amazing cast. Ruben Lagden comes to play as Dante and fans loved his performance. The same for Daniel Southworth playing Vergil. When the motion capturing became a big thing for this game, they had to make sure to get actors that are ready for some stunts. Ruben even made sure to get someone like Southworth since he has experience with stunt acting before during his times with Power Rangers. The motion capturing really brought these characters to life and the scene directing was top-notch too. A big thing that ends up happening is that many moves end up coming from the scenes. Dante sliding on foes, Lady and Dante shooting each other’s bullets, and Vergil deflecting bullets with his sword. This game established the idea of making sure to make a scene with a move that can be done in the game. Hell you can even see Dante use Lady’s motorcycle as a weapon which is now a thing in the fifth game! So this mindset is still living on to this day.\n\nThis game even comes with many secrets that would be unable to pull off in today’s gaming age. One of Dante’s styles is the Doppleganger where he can summon a copy of himself to fight with. If you had a second controller plugged in and activate this mode, a second player can control the clone. The same even happens when Vergil fights alongside Dante which is funny to see Vergil being playable come in a later edition of the game since he could be used in the base game for a short moment. Devil May Cry 3 even continued the secret missions and a whole lot better this time around and did it in the original game’s fashion. Challenges that vary between fighting and knowing the game. This game also has a boss rush stage and its rewarding to fight bosses with all you got and you can do this whenever too. The game comes with a stage select as soon as you beat level one. You can easily grind and train on level one as long as you need to. The game while being challenging is never unforgiving since it gives you so many options to not only go back and play again and find new secrets and methods to fight hard bosses or simply kill enemies in more stylish flair.\n\nOverall it is no wonder why Devil May Cry 3 is a special game. Things could only get higher after the sequel and while it did not sell as well, the legacy this game has lived on longer for sure. This started a trend of Character Action games including the fourth game of the series. Also this was the era where Capcom had everybody following them. When Resident Evil 4 happened, everyone was doing the third person shooter. Then with Devil May Cry 3, everyone wanted to make an awesome action game. Devil May Cry 3 holds a big image with its Dante being a reckless youth being challenged by his twin brother who easily set himself forward more than Dante. Along with them was a feisty lady that got to show the strength of humans. The production on this game is special thanks to memorable performances and insane action pieces. Things should only get better after this since Devil May Cry finally gets to be on more than one platform with its fourth game and with it comes a new face."
