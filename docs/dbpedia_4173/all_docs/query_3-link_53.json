        "text": "Just like Dante, Lady's age was also kept ambiguous.\n\nWhat we do know is that Dante was 18 years old in the Devil May Cry 3 Manga, which took place a year before Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening. So he was 19 years old in DMC3 and Mary (before she renounced her name and went by Lady) was still in high school at the time so she could’ve been around 15-18 years old.\n\nWe also know that she’s suppose to be younger than Dante and her wearing a school uniform from a Catholic school in the manga confirms that. She does wear an alter version of it in DMC3, in which she loses her tie, her white blouse is loose and pull out, her pleated skirt is shorter and turned into a weapon belt and she wears black shorts underneath, etc. She still looks the same, so hardly any time had passed. On an unrelated note, I wonder if she dropped out of school or went back to graduate early at the end of DMC3?\n\nIn the anime series Lady still wears her Devil May Cry 3 outfit, but occasionally she changes it to different clothing. Which unfortunately doesn’t tell me much about her age, besides that she uses her old school uniforms as some sort of go-to demon hunting outfit.\n\nHowever, something that I took into consideration was that in Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry: The Animated Series she owns a motorcycle. So keeping that in mind in order for her to get a license for it she must be at least 16 years old. However, learner's permits are available for those age 14, but they must ride under the supervision of a licensed motorcycle operator who’s at least 19 years old. But I suppose the age may vary on the location and/or laws...\n\nIf I had to guess I’ll say she was 16 years old in DMC3, giving her a 3 year difference between her and Dante. That would make her...\n\nDevil May Cry 3 Manga = 15 years old Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening = 16 years old Devil May Cry 1 = 25 years old Devil May Cry: The Animated Series = 25/26 years old Devil May Cry 2 = 30 years old (assuming Dante was 33 years old) Devil May Cry 4 = 35 years old (assuming Dante was 38 years old) Devil May Cry 5 = UNKNOWN (but I’m guessing 37 years old if it’s assumed that Dante is 40 years old in this)\n\nEven though Lady is completely human, it’s not ludicrous to believe that she would have a youthful appearance. I know for some people being in your late 30s to early 40s is old, but if you look up celebrities a couple of them don’t look their age at all. It all depends on a couple of factors -- genetics, healthy eating, keeping in shape, and taking care of your skin with moisturizers, sunblock and so on.\n\nEven from personal experience I know this very well. For example, people tend to assume that I’m a teenager or younger. There was even a time when I went to a diner with my sister and the waitress asked her if she wanted a kids menu for me. That hasn’t been the only incident though, much of the confusion is because of my short height (and causal, sometimes loose-fitting clothing too).\n\nIt also doesn’t help that Capcom has a habit of making female characters look ageless. I suppose the same can be said about some of the male characters too, but it’s easier to tell that they’re older though. It wouldn’t be the end of the world if they had a wrinkle or two."
