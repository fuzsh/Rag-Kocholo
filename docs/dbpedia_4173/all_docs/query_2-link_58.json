        "text": "Devil May Cry is a series of hack-n-slash and/or beat ’em up video games that combines classic puzzle solving, survival horror, stylized combat, and multiple weapons.\n\nIf you’re a fan of the games or just curious, check out these facts.\n\nThe original trilogy was developed by Capcom, who had previously brought us Street Fighter (1987) and Resident Evil (1996), respectively.\n\n2001 brought us the original game, Devil May Cry.\n\nGame designer Hideki Kamiya had finished work on Resident Evil 2 (1998) and was planning the next game.\n\nThe working title was Resident Evil: Team Little Devil.\n\nWhilst researching Medieval Spanish architecture, he soon changed the concept and premise.\n\nWith more of a focus on survival horror, he directed and released Devil May Cry. The game was released on October 16, 2001.\n\nThe game followed half-demon, paranormal mercenary Dante and his challenge – stop the demon emperor Mundus from making a return to the human world and taking complete control.\n\nIn this game, Dante was voiced by Drew Coombs.\n\nDante was assisted in this game by the humanoid demon creation Trish, who bore a great resemblance to Dante’s mother.\n\nTrish had the ability to wield lightning.\n\nShe reappeared on numerous occasions, including Devil May Cry 4, Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, where she was a playable character.\n\nDevil May Cry 2\n\nDevil May Cry 2 was released in 2003 and followed Dante on his mission to stop businessman Arius and his intentions to summon the devil lord Argosax.\n\nMatthew Kaminsky took on the role of Dante’s voice for this game.\n\nDuring the game, Dante met and was assisted by Lucia, an artificially created demon and member of a clan who wished to protect humans and life.\n\nShe was a playable character in the game.\n\nDevil May Cry 3\n\nDevil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening burst onto the scene in 2005 as a prequel to the previous games.\n\nDante is set with the task of stopping his brother Vergil and the devil-worshiping scholar Arkham from merging the human and the demon world into one entity.\n\nDante’s Awakening saw the emergence of Reuben Langdon, who not only voiced Dante but performed the motion capture for the character as well.\n\nInterestingly, Langdon went on to reprise his role as Dante in Devil May Cry 4, the English dub of Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, and Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, where Dante was a playable character.\n\nDante’s newfound friend in this game was the human Mary, who changed her name to Lady after meeting Dante.\n\nA demon hunter, she is Arkham’s daughter and is responsible for the narration of the game.\n\nLady also reappeared in Devil May Cry 4 and Devil May Cry: The Animated Series.\n\nDevil May Cry 4\n\nDevil May Cry 4 split the game with two playable characters; Dante, who came to defeat the evil known as Sanctus, and Nero, a half-demon who is trying to save his friend (and love) Kyrie from Sanctus’ clutches.\n\nThis game introduced Johnny Yong Bosch, who performed the voice and motion capture requirements for Nero.\n\nAnd in chronological order…\n\nInterestingly, the chronological order of the games is:\n\n– Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening\n\n– Devil May Cry\n\n– Devil May Cry 4\n\n– Devil May Cry 2\n\nDMC: Devil May Cry was released by Ninja Theory in January 2013.\n\nThis game is set in a parallel universe, where the player takes control of a young Dante and the exploits of him as a young demon hunter.\n\nThe game is not related to any of the numbered games."
