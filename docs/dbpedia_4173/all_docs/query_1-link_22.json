        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nSmilingShadows\n\n100%PlayStation 4\n\n13h Played\n\nThis party's gettin' crazy! Let's rock!\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is an astonishing leap in quality from not just DMC 2 but DMC 1 as well. This is where the series really found its heart and soul. Dante is one of the most endearingly dorky goofballs of a protagonist in the history of video games and Vergil is literally the coolest motherfucker ever and you cannot tell me otherwise.\n\nAside from the single room with platforming, controls were great. The incorporation of multiple different styles of gameplay make the variety in choice for combat excellent and the number of new weapons is great. My personal favorites had to be Cerberus and Beowulf. I wasn't the biggest fan of Nevan however and found its usefulness to be extremely circumstantial.\n\nFor a PS2 game, the quality of animation in cutscenes and models feels like 5-6 years ahead of its time and the action scenes are pure eye candy.\n\nI found that this game solved the issues I had with DMC 1's mission structure and made each nearly level enjoyable. The exception to this would be the level inside Leviathan (mainly due to the shitty filter it puts onscreen) and the boss rush. Due to the variety, style meter, drip-feeding of new weapons and unlocking of new moves, combat never got boring. Even when it was completely superfluous, I fought nearly every battle I came across. The only enemies I didn't like were the angel demons that show up late-game due to their ability to phase through the environment and being extremely hard to land consistent blows on.\n\nBosses are where this game excels and stumbles the most in my opinion. Cerberus is a fantastic introductory boss and was just pure fun to fight. Gigapede was lame in design and had a shitty camera. Jester was fairly good but didn't need three fights. Agni and Rudra were fun but fairly tough to beat. The Heart of Leviathan was a filler boss that was more annoying to beat than enjoyable. Nevan was alright but suffered from prolonged invincibility and occasional poor telegraphs. Beowulf was a fucking blast and his hyper-aggressive fight was a constant battle of stress and adrenaline. Geryon was good and had a great cinematic approach to his fight. Lady was really really easy and I kinda wish she got a more difficult battle. Similarly the Doppelganger was a cakewalk and spent most of the fight taunting rather than actually fighting.\n\nSpecial mention needs to be given to the utter fucking disaster that was Arkham's fight. Up until this point, aside from the camera in Gigapede's fight, I hadn't have considered anything about this game to be \"awful\". Then, Arkham's fight began. The first half is okay, though his eel-attack is fucking impossible to avoid without Lady's rocket launcher. Then Vergil shows up. Now, you lose half of your moves and the ability to use Devil Trigger and have Vergil flail about half-copying your inputs and half-doing his own thing. The second half of the fight becomes a total clusterfuck of arbitrarily limiting your moveset and handicapping you for literally no reason. Vergil should've just been an A.I. controlled character, it would've allowed for the cinematic approach to this fight to occur while still giving you full access to your moves.\n\nSpeaking of Vergil, special mention needs to be given to how fucking incredible all of his fights are. His battles are both mechanically and narratively excellent and test your skills up to that point perfectly. I'm so glad there was a third Vergil fight after Arkham because it allowed for the game to end on a high note rather than a sour one.\n\nThe music in this game is legendary. Dark-angelic-gothic-rock-metal-orchestra is the best way of describing the way this music sounds and if that sounds totally badass then I encourage anyone reading this to give the OST a listen.\n\nThe cast is great. Dante, as previously stated is beyond lovable and comes off as snarky and quippy in the way modern video games wish they could be. Every second Vergil is on screen, your eyes will be glued to whatever he is doing. His presence is utterly commanding and terrifying. Lady is a firearms badass and I really wish she was playable. Her arc with Arkham was really enjoyable to watch. Arkham, for how shitty his fight was, is the simplest character of the lot but I found it worked the best when contrasted with Vergil's blind ambition, Dante's playfulness, and Lady's vengefulness. He's a piece of shit that you can't wait to see put six feet under and the writers knew this.\n\nOverall, aside from one horrible boss fight and a few iffy levels, this game is a masterpiece. I cannot recommend it enough. As it is a prequel, you don't even need any info from the first two games in order to understand it. You need to play DMC 3, it's an utter joyride.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nMaxio\n\n100%PC\n\n150h Progress\n\nDMC3's one of the top 10 games i've ever played. One of the best hack n slash games.\n\nThe cinematics were great, the story is great. The combat is really fucking good, i could do it for hours on end.\n\nThe bosses and all the stages were memorable. The first act inside the office was great, the introduction to the game and the cinematics were cool.\n\nI love the character designs, especially Dante.\n\nDevil Arms\n\nRebellion: Basic but it's the best one out of the rest and I prefer it over them.\n\nCerberus: It's great to use, the moveset is fun.\n\nAgni & Rudra: It was alright not much to fight with, wasn't my fav.\n\nNevan: It's very forgettable since i rarely used it.\n\nBeowulf: In the top 3 weapons, looks very fkn cool. Fun to fight with too.\n\nDidn't fuck around with firearms much other than ebony & ivory.\n\nBoss Fights:\n\nHell Vanguard: It was annoying at first but it's fairly easy. Not that interesting.\n\nCerberus: Cool fight, used to love it.\n\nGigapede: Really tedious boss, it wasn't really fun just memorable cause of the stage and annoying boss.\n\nJester: Really fuckin cool character. The cutscenes of him were always cool to watch. Boss fight was fairly easy.\n\nAgni and Rudra: They were ass, nothing interesting.\n\nLeviathan Heart: The whole stage and the boss was alright. Cutscenes were cool tho.\n\nNevan: It was fun\n\nBeowulf: Literally had to look up the fight cause i forgot the boss even existed. I remember the cutscene, that's about it.\n\nGeryon: It was a fun stage and the fight in the arena was kinda fun too.\n\nLady: I remember it being too long, it was a boring stage tho.\n\nDoppelganger: Really fucking cool. The scene and the fight itself were very cool.\n\nArkham: I can't recall much more than a blob but i'm sure it was cool.\n\nVergil: Every fight and scene with him is just great. The fights were challenging and really great. The cutscenes with interactions between him and dante were especially great.\n\nSpecial Edition had few additional things that I can't really remember. Pretty sure it was that Vergil was playable in this edition. I fucked around with him but I didn't finish the game with him.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nYannis_Spirou\n\n65%Nintendo Switch\n\n10h Played\n\nFirst of all, I want to say that I'm surprised by the quality of Nintendo Switch's port of Devil May Cry 3, it's genuinely a great port with some cool minor additions.\n\nAside from that, I'm also surprised by how well the game aged for the most part, particularly its combat system. I wish the upgrade system was deeper and the weapons would have more skills to unlock, but it's not that big of a deal, there are many weapons to use and the combat system by itself is highly enjoyable and flashy nonetheless.\n\nThe story is nothing special or interesting but it's not an important part of the game. At least the characters are nice and they make up for the lack of engaging storytelling.\n\nAlso, the pacing is pretty good, and it's an important part of the game.\n\nUnfortunately, the visuals and the audio haven't aged as well as the gameplay, but the music is quite okay actually.\n\nWhat aged even worse though, is the absolutely horrible camera, boring level design and the repetitive looking areas.\n\nMost of the boss fights are badly designed with either boring gimmicks, questionable hit boxes or unbalanced moves in some instances.\n\nLastly, there's a lot of unnecessary backtracking after a while, and the puzzles are all tedious, with some of them barely giving you any clues for some reason.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Fun combat system that holds up very well\n\n+ Serviceable characters\n\n+ Consistent pacing\n\n+ Decent music\n\nCons:\n\n- Very bad camera\n\n- Uninspired level design and environments\n\n- Mostly annoying boss fights\n\n- Frustrating backtracking and puzzles\n\nNarrative: ?/10\n\nGameplay: 7/10\n\nContent: ?/10\n\nCharacters: 5/10\n\nMusic: 6/10\n\nGraphics/Audio: ?/10\n\nFinal Rating: 6.5/10\n\n- Pretty Good -\n\nDevil May Cry 3 is a great game for the time it originally came out, but it didn't age well in most areas aside from the combat system.\n\nDo I recommend it?:\n\nNot really, unless you've already played Devil May Cry 5 before and you want to get deeper into the series, otherwise, there's no reason to bother with Devil May Cry 3 in my opinion.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nSilverek\n\n80%PC\n\n13h 31m Played\n\nDidn't expect that after first 2-3 hours, but the game is holding up insenly good for almost a 2 decades old title.\n\nBosses are really enjoyable - some of them are kinda basic, but they are just really enjoyable to fight\n\nGame is not easy even on just \"Normal difficulty\" - sadly you can't try higher ones before you finish the game, but that's maybe a good thing becouse everyone would just got obliderated on first-try highest difficulty after i looked what improvments enemies has there.\n\nHas nice replay ability - i really don't like replaying levels in game, but i here i was enjoying it, tho didn't do much of it becouse DMC 4/5 are still waiting.\n\nDespite game reusing assets like crazy (becouse of where the action is taking place), every level feels like something new just a bit - especially becouse of the number of weapons, there is not enough time at all to get any good at using more than 1 weapon in just one playthrough and then you have styles, range weapons, combos between them, getting SSS etc. etc. holy shit this game despite only being 12-15h long with doing all of the side stuff it really has a tools for NG+, NG++ etc.\n\nOverall it's a great game and despite not liking the idea to repeat game right after finish for NG+ i would clearly even now at least finish Hard with new character and maybe even the hardest difficulty on one of them if i didn't have DMC 4/5 to play now."
