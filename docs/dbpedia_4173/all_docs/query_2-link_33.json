        "text": "Alright time to finish this look into the Devil May Cry franchise (until DMC6 is a thing) with the reboot of the franchise. Now I am not here to talk about the development of the game the whole time. I am here to dissect this game and see what makes it cool. I did it for Devil May Cry 2 so I think this game should give me an easier time. DMC2 has no emotion and this reboot is full of many loud emotions, a bit too loud nearly all the time. Also, the reboot came in an interesting time period so this game has a bit of a time capsule feel to it and is helpful to know this in what this title tried to do. Now I will be using my personal nicknames for some of these characters or ones I am going to make up right now for this post. Expect to hear all the Donte names possible here because I am not a fan of this character like many are. Still without bias I have to find what makes not only this character cool in some eyes, but the entire game as well.\n\nTo start things off the first thing I want to bring up is the original Donte in that trailer that everyone got mad about. This is going to be a hot take right here, but I personally feel that this character would have been far better if we got the original version. Now do I agree this is Dante? Hell no! This would still be a strange twist on the character regardless. Still I think the Donte we got in the end was just your usual bland protagonist of his time. This British punk feels more alive with gothic tones added to him compared to a kid that pretty much just feels he watched Fight Club one too many times. I can even see a certain style being added to this draft of the character. He smokes which could have added some cool taunts like simply smoking in front of foes and even tossing the bud at foes similar to Dante with the rose or Kiryu from Yakuza when he smokes. On top of that that first Donte fits what the game also has with the enemies and such. I personally really dislike how clean cut the Donte we got was. He really could just be placed into many other games with no problem. So yes, Donte was going to be a mess no matter what happened, it’s just I think the one we got just made things worse.\n\nWith Donte… we got one loud mouth punk, wait that sounds like Nero more than Dante. Already we have this interesting misstep since Donte takes some notes from Nero more than Dante. Nero even swears more than the other characters in actual DMC and with Donte, he swears so much that the word “fuck” can be used in his biography. Now this style of attitude can click with people. Saying whatever you want and being snarky to anything around you. Donte even changes throughout his journey so he does go through character development to where he needs to take a position to stop another, on paper that sounds fine. The problem is that we deal with a basic “Down with the man” story and paper-thin characters. On a design basis though I can see what Donte wants to be. A punk with a heart of gold. The short hair works with his “A” shirt and coat. He looks a bit sloppy and that is the point. Sadly, it loses some of those points because of how clean he looks. It just reminds me of some 90’s video game covers with these obvious people only dressing like these bad dudes for the cover.\n\nRemember when people thought this new look for Nero was Dino?\n\nIs there anything good to say about Donte really? I think there is even if it’s not my taste. Again, his attitude can be endearing for some. This has been seen with Nero, insulting these scary monsters and posing to feel bigger than them. Donte has some of that like how he casually goes through wreckage when he is getting dressed in the opening scene, there are people who get a laugh from that and the time the pizza covers his junk. Sadly, I think it goes really downhill for the character after that. Sure, he still insults some demons here and there, but he sadly can have some standard angry faces and blank looks when seeing new demons to fight. He takes fighting a bit more seriously compared to Dante, sure whatever. He still does get into the fight by screaming out which many characters in action games do. I also do feel he has some style when fighting, the red weapons pack a punch and when he uses the gauntlets, he does his own take with them. He acts a bit more like a drunk brawler in some ways, especially when he is reeling his fists back. Then the blue weapons have smooth and fast motions on top of that he can fly around with those type of powers. The gameplay does well for showcasing this character better than the story can ever do, which is a bit sad because there was a character here.\n\nAnother thing to note was how this game came out during the time when Capcom was aiming for the “Western” tastes. Take note this is when they thought their usual style was not winning out even if Capcom had good sales already, even with DMC4. With the idea of a western mindset is well the joke of edge. We all know what this means, people wanted the characters that say no to the usual methods and be beefy boys. Kratos from God of War and even something like Nier getting localized has proof of this. The original Donte was a bit lankier and the final version we got easily added some muscle to him. Donte also fit the bill for that age range of our usual main character in this era of video games. If he had a shaved head it would have even been more obvious, but no they had to go with the black hair and never ever go to white hair at all, man even this so-called rebel character even loses his backbone in his design later on. Still the edge factor was real in this overall experience and while it has become a joke, this was a legit trend and should not be ignored.\n\nHow about the other characters? Well Vergil’s counterpart, Vernot has his same share of troubles. First there was that stupid hat he was wearing which got patched out in later versions of the game, I’m not joking. Still I will be honest here, I do think the beginning of Vernot was not a bad take on Vergil. It actually did stay true to some of what Vergil was. Dante was the slop and Vergil was the serious one, Dante dressed poorly in DMC3 and 5 and Vergil always looked more formal. DMC5 Vergil even carries a similar design scheme too with having the blue being a bit more subdued. Vernot’s black coat really stands out especially when you see his bottom half having the blue the character is known for. He looks far more proper and his design does actually hold some hints to what he actually is by the end (too bad the story did really bad setting that up). The obvious thing would be the blue band on his arm, I bet everyone knows what that could be hinting towards knowing how this character wanted to rule in the end.\n\nMany other characters now… man there is not a lot to say about them. Kat is the damsel in distress which is really in bad tastes considering how Ninja Theory pretty much called previous female characters in the series and even Bayonetta, whores with guns. Mundus in this game is a scummy business man or a better way to put it, a poor man’s Lex Luthor. Then the only boss I think that had any flavor would be Bob since he is a loud spokesperson for a news channel and his boss fight really reflected that well. The varying images on his face showing how much he needs to save his own face all the time. Some other bosses fit a bit more of a gross out style which for some is their sense of humor, then I will give props for not making a succubus sexy (you don’t see that often, was it funny… no, but hey they tried and by tried I mean a bunch of “F” bombs). At least this game stuck to an art style and made these demons disgusting and did not go all over the place. The enemies can have some nice designs and they speak loud just like the demon hunter, El Donte so they match.\n\nAnother thing this game has would be its visual presentation. Not only does it stand out with this, it’s not a bad one by any means. Personally, I am not for the loudness of it at times, but there is actual effort into making these distorted worlds. There was even a short level where you pretty much go through a Fox News channel, that was actually pretty nice (you cannot get any louder than Fox News, am I right?). Probably the best level that fits with the style they were going for was the club. The music keeps a constant beat with the background following with it, the colors change around too. Even the stage you are on has slight changes, its visually appealing. There were even the moments where you get to experiment with new powers which looks lovely as well. I’m happy they had some quiet and beautiful scenery here and there to balance things out. So visually speaking the game can be a treat at times and there are fun things to look in the background too. So, props to the reboot there, it’s nice to look at when the game is actually playing.\n\nTo be honest the game always looks far more appealing when it’s just gameplay, which makes sense you want to have a game look fun to play. While it has some issues with some control options that can only be for the person playing. While there is a bit of a hurdle or two for me personally because I am too wired into how other DMC games play. There are some stylish combos to be done here and the weapon switching in that game does have some faster access. Then with the best version removing the whole color defenses, you can go all out with combos. So, on paper there is a good number of things to try out, but the game does have some broken weapons, but hey, so does other DMC titles. I feel Donte probably has the best crowd control of all the DMC characters in the franchise. He has weapons that have widespread effects, can launch others into the sky, even his Devil Trigger slows down time. This character manages to be a mixture of DMC combos with Bayonetta like systems. Combos that can be easy to do, but also have them really connect well with each other too to fully master them. I do think the game has only aged poorly with its story. Some of its presentation can be still be loved and with sixty frames now being common in the better versions of the game, it can be enjoyed like other DMC games with combat. This is where it can actually be better than the second game.\n\nDevil May Cry 2 is just full on boredom. It was a dull presentation, barely any great moments with the low amounts of dialogue and story, and no real strong sense of style. At least with the reboot game there is a sense of style here that can work for some people. The presentation is loud and colorful and has an obvious contrast with the grey real world, but hey it’s something more than DMC2. There are more enjoying combos to experiment with and it feels a bit more rewarding to do so as well. Donte has far more things to do compared to DMC2 Dante. While the story can be frustrating there can be some guilty pleasures with it now these days while people barely even try with DMC2. While this reboot can be loud and annoying, I would still put more effort into it compared to the kid just eating glue.\n\nOverall, this game was a mess, but an interesting one nonetheless. It really reminds me of the time period of 2013 when the game released and how that era was for gaming. Especially for Capcom around that era. This game really ended up doing some good in the end though. I feel like the wait for DMC5 only got better with this reboot because it couldn’t recreate that same spark the original games had. When that first reveal for this fifth game finally happened, it just filled fans with more joy. The reboot was gone and what came back were the true demon hunters we got to experience. I have to actually thank the reboot also for the fact that this game got me to play more DMC in general. I started with the fourth game and the whole backlash this reboot was getting encouraged me to really look back on the franchise. So just remember, even with some bad moments in a franchise, it can always pick itself back up in far greater ways you can imagine, just like how Devil May Cry 3 completely shocked people and now so did Devil May Cry 5.\n\nI think it is about time to finally get this post done. More people are doing their big videos on this game and most of the fans know what happens in this title. I know I still did not do a post on the reboot game, but to be honest… that will still be a work in progress. Also, why do I want to talk about the bummer title when we got the actual Devil May Cry 5! The reason why I did these posts was to celebrate the series and I even had to cover the second game and try to bring light and a different point of view to most of its glaring problems. There is a lot to love about Devil May Cry and now this fifth entry is probably a huge collection of why fans and its creators have loved it for so long.\n\nI will not lie, this game feels like a finale in many ways. We got tons of plot points that were introduced in three and four that finally got their proper follow-ups. On top of that we had a prequel novel with events before five that actually had Lucia from the second game and man the amount of personality, she had in that one novel is far better than how she was presented in the game. Along with that we got many great callbacks to the entire series and yes this includes the reboot game. Devil May Cry 5 has everything and while some may think having things that represent the reboot game seems to be wishy washy, because it can seem this game was making no enemies in the fanbase. To be honest though, even a fan like me can say there are good to even great things to the reboot title (which will be for another day). I do find the callbacks to the first DMC to also be interesting because both the original and reboot title were not done by the man; we know for Devil May Cry now, Hideki Itsuno. Being with this franchise for a long time though and seeing its many faces, this man learned how to merge things together with perfection.\n\nSpeaking of perfection, I am torn with saying this is the best Devil May Cry game ever. The action in this game is just the best! So much variety is given with only three characters and two in particular are like over ten characters in one and the third one is literally four in one. There are even foes that have come back from the original game like Sin Scissors and Nobodies. The only big flaw here though is that the DMC series finally got rid of those puzzles and while secret missions do have some fun little puzzles to solve, DMC5 breaks the tradition and actually does go for the reboot’s way of level design a bit. In 5, you are walking straight a whole lot, but at times I would rarely notice because the action is that good. So as of right now the remaining Resident Evil in DMC is literally the engine that runs in this game.\n\nOnto the other aspect of Devil May Cry that has been with the series ever since the beginning is Dante. As talked about before, Dante as always been the cool surfer bro when he is on the job. Dante in the original game shrugs off danger like he is a Toku hero. In Devil May Cry 3 we get to see that attitude take a reckless variation until he finally notices what he needs to do. Then with the fourth game, Dante got to act like a mentor passing off the torch to another son of Sparda. For this new look into Dante’s life we actually get his anime personality at the beginning. Dante has no running power or water in his place and still just rests at his desk. A new job comes up and he hears something that kicks his gears right back in. Dante’s self-destruction comes clear in this title and it finally adds in a larger sense of relatability to him. Back then we loved his moments of fun and also took in his sadness as well (with the first game, it got taken more as a joke sadly…). Also let us add on the fact that is been teen years since we got to see this demon hunter back in action. Dante is us; he has been waiting for another gig and so have we. The major difference is that Dante actually does not want to waste any time though. It sure is interesting to see Dante with age becomes narrowminded in a fashion.\n\nNow back in fashion, is the youngest Devil Hunter, Nero. With this character, I took a look at his punk attitude and while that is still clearly here, we get to see his full character and take a step forward as well. To be frank, this easily could have the title of Nero’s Awakening. Yes, the main character role is given to Nero again and while many would think after DMC4, they would not do that again. The issues with Nero’s debut was because of budget restraints for the most part. It felt unfair to Nero and it is only thanks to time and a major misstep from the franchise to make fans warm up to him. Nero was my beginning with the series so seeing how he deals with these new events is heartwarming. Itsuno even gives Nero shorter hair and somehow people mistook him for Dante from the reboot title. Both Nero and Donte share a punkish attitude so this short hair look works for Nero and they also made sure to give him some Vergil details since that will be a major thing later on.\n\nAlong with Nero is a whole new look into how he plays. Back then, Nero only had his one special arm that gave him the greatest grab in video games. Nero can still do the famous Snatch move, but Nero has far more than just grabs. Nero has electricity, parries, time stops, flying arms, and even a freaking Mega Buster! That is only about half of the arms’ abilities and these are an insane concept to add to the Devil May Cry series. In a way this is a method of keeping some Resident Evil in the series since the arms have to be used with a worry about your inventory. The arms are a bit fragile so when taking a hit, they break and you can break them yourself to unleash a powerful move. At first, Itsuno was questioning if they should make the Devil Breakers similar to Dante with his weapons, but they wanted to make Nero stand out in many ways. The team decided to work with consumable weapons (and this time not like a Holy Water that subtracts your score). Either way these items really show Nero’s character well. They have large impact, but with reckless behavior can lead to messy situations and regretting your actions.\n\nOnto the aspect of regret we have our brand-new character, V (yes that is his name). V actually brings back a style of cool that was almost in the series before and that is goth. The original Donte had more gothic themes along with his British punk aspects and to be honest, it would have been fine in my opinion. Now is it better to have a new character pick up this theme, yes that is for sure. A new character can bring new aspects to a series just like Nero introduced the punk attitude. In a way though… V does take ideas from Donte because of who he actually is. Now we get to the part where all chains are off. What I am implying here is that V is Vergil. Vergil who has been seen as posh cool and a character who had loss after loss. Vergil split himself into two and V is the human half with barely any demon power. V is extremely fragile as he is a literal husk of what Vergil left behind. A big reason why William Blake is being used for this game ever since the beginning. That opening statement is all about how holding grieving emotions towards another just leads to a path of destruction. V is now the one who notices that and wants to redeem his errors.\n\nNow V is still not a perfect man, but taking steps to fix what he has done is improvement none the less. On top of that V even brings a new style of combat into the series, summoning. V has three summonses where they are all from Devil May Cry original. Even the summons mention how they were born. These summonses were created from memories of when Vergil was Nelo Angelo a huge aspect Vergil wanted to get rid of. The demon, Urizen has no memories he just knows he has suffered losses from Dante and wants power! V being the shell of the part of Vergil’s life he wanted to shed is truly literal since he even tried to get rid of those memories which made the summons, Griffon, Shadow, and Nightmare. V brings new tactical combat to the series and while your familiars do the damage, V has to bring the finishing blow. V is extremely fragile and relies on stepping away for the most part. The gothic themes even come clearer when playing as him. His slender designs while wearing pure black clothes and with those tattoos just create an interesting image of a fighter. V even uses a cane to walk around. The best part about V is that you control your summons with different buttons, except for Nightmare until you ride and control him. You can even taunt while the partners are attacking and it is the greatest!\n\nI am sorry if this is going to be an extremely long post, but there is still more to cover here. We got another new character by the name Nico. Sure, she is not a playable character, but her importance is large none the less. Originally designed to be another badass character, Nico was going to be more of a straight arrow that loved her craft. Through some improvising though the actress found a new way to show how Nico acts. Nico is playing things up while keeping a cool demeanor. When she is in the van, she is one of the devil hunters, hell this van is a Devil Weapon! She knows how dangerous things are and tries to hide it because this is pure bliss. She actually relates to any fan of the series since we love what we are watching, but if this was our reality, we would be extremely afraid. She also works so well with Nero from the get go since they both come from a story where they were neglected by their fathers. This is why these two have brother and sister like relationship so quickly and I love it so much. Nico easily became my favorite girl of the series which is impressive and it’s all thanks to how an actress wanted to add in some comedy for the character.\n\nOkay now for the big, big, and I mean big spoilers for this game and some of the greatest moments the series ever had. The return of Vergil and what that could bring after so many years. Vergil has always been an important figure in the series even in the first game with his Nelo Angelo appearance. So, what is in store for Vergil this time around, yes, he becomes the final boss again like his role in Devil May Cry 3 and yet so much has changed for him. Vergil now returns to where Dante has grown older and even seeing his son take steps that both Vergil and Dante never could do. A family is reunited with this one character returning. Two brothers are back and a son gets to meet his father for the first time. Family is an extremely large part of the Devil May Cry series ever since day one. The first Dante wanted revenge for the death of his mother and we got to see how fragile of a topic this was for him. This only got expanded in his prequel title where he sheds a tear for the loss of his brother and feeling pain that only Lady knows as well. The thing is though, Dante accepts what he has done after all of these years.\n\nTaking a bit of a detour to talk about other mechanics in the game that really enrichen the experience. The first one is Dante’s new power, the Sin Devil Trigger. Dante can now achieve higher than his father and wields a new sword under his own name. This new Devil Trigger really just shows off how powerful Dante as become. You do not get the healing factor with this one, but the damage output is insane! Dante even gets the largest weapon load of the entire series. Dante can have all of his swords after finishing the game at different difficulties, the return of the Kalina Ann and its second version which Dante dual wields them, new crazy weapons like the Faust Hat and the Cavaliere, and new spins on Ebony and Ivory and even Cerberus. Along with all of this you can even show off your skills to others thanks to the Cameo mechanics. Where your data is saved and can pop up to help players or to simply show off in the background. There is just so much style in this game and it makes sure you get the chance to show it off yourself.\n\nVergil is back and what happened because of him? A giant demon tree is summoned so that the demon half, Urizen can acquire power that the demon king, Mundus had. Which is quite an interesting detail since before the final fight with Urizen, we see him covering his true self. Vergil caused chaos yet again and with him back, Dante holds nothing back. Dante goes for the first attack, yes Dante of all people. He has no warm embrace for his brother, his heroic sense takes a violent turn. Dante has already done this before, twice to be specific. He holds no regrets on his past even if it still was damaging to his overall life. Dante has become tired of all this.\n\nAs for Vergil returning, he had two different experiences at the same time. Urizen, the demon wanting power and V the man who got to see the true terror of that. We even get to learn the reason for how Vergil came to be which is mommy issues. Yes, this has become a joke in the series as well, but Eve is extremely important to how Dante and Vergil are as characters. Dante was saved and Eve did not get to Vergil in time, leaving him to run for his life alone. Vergil took that as he was left behind and had to defend himself hence his quest for power. It’s something many fans (including myself) have looked into before since that feeling of loss from both the demons and his family made him feel worthless. Vergil still holds his family in importance because its fact of why he is around and how much he wanted his mother to love him. On top of that Vergil does admit that he fell in love with a woman in his past. Again, his past love could be another reason for why he wanted new power since he had a family to protect. Vergil simply got lost gaining that new power.\n\nIn a way, Dante’s narrow mindlessness is similar since he has only been getting stronger and even with a new Devil Trigger to boot as well. Power clouds the mind and both of these idiots lost a lot. Dante even mentions he barely remembers any peaceful moments with his brother, he only knows of when they fought. These two never took time to forgive each other, they only kept fighting. This became their method. Even if Vergil finally got to reflect on his past with regret for his quest of power, he still held onto an old desire. V mentions this before fusing back with Urizen, they both hold that feeling to finally win. Dante’s heroism and Vergil’s desires simply just end of clashing with each other every single time while in reality they both share the burden of loss, but there is one to unite them.\n\nThis is the moment when Nero takes his main character slot. Throughout this fifth title, we saw Nero becoming more reckless. Nero sees that power is all that he needs and says that straight to Dante’s face. Dante called him a deadweight before and that just motivated Nero to get stronger in a bad way. Still Nero ends up being caring to others around him since that is how he grew up. He had people to care for him unlike Dante and Vergil who had to live on their own. When Nero learns Vergil is his father, he starts to really question many things. Originally, he was just fighting to prove his mentor wrong, now it became a moment where he could lose family again. Growing up with Kyrie and Credo gave him a family and falling in love with Kyrie became strength for him. The loss of Credo then gives Nero tons of regret, he never forgave himself for it. Now Nero learns who his father is and now he learns that his mentor was an uncle the entire time. Nero tries to accomplish the number one thing that never happened in a Devil May Cry game, to reunite a family.\n\nDevil May Cry 1 and 3 had Dante fighting his brother and even killing him later on. Sparda’s family was forever torn on that faithful day when Eve died. The two brothers took different paths. Dante taking the side of what the hero wanted to save. Vergil took focus on what his father was, a demon and a legend, with a search for power. Nero fought for the thing he never fully had and he is back to do that now since it has been his entire goal in life. Nero lives with what Sparda’s actual legacy is, family. Sparda was a demon who ended up being a hero and yet the most important thing to him was family. He fell in love with a human woman and started one. His sense of justice came from love. Dante did not want to lose anyone close to him, hence why he closed his heart away and acted like the over the top hero. Vergil lost his focus for power even if it could have started with great intent. Nero never strayed from this path and he knocked some sense into these devil boys, to finally forgive each other.\n\nI cannot tell you how much this moment feels for any fan of the series. For me, I started with Nero and got to learn of Dante and his story later on and it feels correct. This is why Nero was taking the main character slot, he finally does the impossible. Nero prevents anyone from dying, the bloodshed is over. Seeing this moment being his awakening to his devil power and saying “Fuck you!” to all of this; is the biggest impact in the entire series. It throws a huge middle finger to a major trope since no one is going to lose here. Nero gets to prove himself in such an important moment of his life. Nero’s final fight with Vergil is beyond great since it’s the son proving he is right while his father needs to prove dominance. Now Dante and Vergil go away for who knows how long, but Nero has gained the possibility of being able to see his family in the future.\n\nHideki Itsuno has mentioned that this could be the end for him and this series. To be honest, this is a perfect end right here. The man who started with the first misstep in the series with the second game, created a legacy for himself. Devil May Cry 3 brought new life into Dante and a fourth game kept the image strong. The reboot happened and only made him more motivated to make this proper return bigger than ever. He even found many ways to tribute the original game something he never worked on because that was Hideki Kamiya. It’s amazing to put it simply. This man creates an ending for a franchise he didn’t even start. At the same time, he put everything into this game. The original motif of family, the sons of Sparda story telling that started with Devil May Cry 3, and finishing the passing of the torch that the previous game started. There are even many aspects of the reboot title with how the game plays and some funny references inserted as well. Itsuno loves this series even if it had missteps before, it only creates passion to do better. Thank you, Itsuno and to all of the teams of Devil May Cry you started a new trend of action games and closed a big book on it.\n\nNow we can truly ask this. Dante will we meet again?\n\nAlmost completely finished with this look of the Devil May Cry series and the last post was looking into the highest point of the series to many eyes. This next game though still has that same thing though from many other fans. While the fourth game easily has some problems for sure, a whole new look on the combat system really took this one to new heights. Capcom even took another bold move with this franchise and introduce a new main character, Capcom does this a whole lot to be honest. Street Fighter 3 originally had Alex be the new main character and even Ace Attorney tried to get a new face with Apollo Justice. How did fans respond though? With Street Fighter 3 The New Generation, the loss of characters like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li did not stick well. Ryu and Ken were put in the original version of the third game quickly after the initial reactions. Even then we got characters like Chun-Li and Akuma in later versions. Ace Attorney still did major focus for Apollo Justice, but in the next two games after his, he had to share the spotlight. So how did the new son of Sparda turn out, was he loved or hated and is it smart to stick with Nero for Devil May Cry 5?\n\nTo clear one thing up first is that Nero does come from Dante originally. When the first teaser for the next Devil May Cry game was out, it still stuck with a young Dante. High chance it would have been directly after Devil May Cry 3 and before the original game in regards to the timeline. With the finished version it placed after the first game and many fans still pushed Devil May Cry 2 to the end to pretend it does not exist. The truth is that this fourth game with its story is placed after the original sequel. Which is mind boggling to admit. So, with all that in mind what ended up happening with the story? I do not doubt that most of the story from the early drafts still stuck because we do have focus for Vergil and his weapon, Yamato. Replace young Dante with a new rebellious youthful character and relations with Vergil too and things can still work out the same. This does bring one of the biggest gripes with Nero that he acts a bit too similarly to Dante, especially young Dante. This easily could have been keeping most of the original script, but Nero still has many of his own quirks that fans still love to this day and I think the fifth game is going to heavily focus on.\n\nNero’s version of cool is the rebellious punk. Nero has a bit more tendency to swear and loses his anger quite often. Nero’s taunts are extremely aggressive and insulting and can be completely full of himself with his love for rock and heavy metal. The best taunt that still continues is when Nero is literally rocking out on an air guitar. Along with his attitude being on the high spectrum, a focus for his style is aggression. Nero has many charge moves which sure Dante and his share of those too, but with Nero he really focuses on the big hits. Nero’s gun the Blue Rose is a huge hand cannon of a pistol with charge shots that does much better than Dante’s Ebony and Ivory. He also has the Red Queen a sword that can charge up through revving it like an engine. This is still what fans love of Nero’s combat the most because getting those charges up and into full blast makes a lovely display of flames! On top of that Nero might not have different styles, but he brings an incredibly powerful arm to make up for that.\n\nNero’s Devil Bringer brings an incredibly new technique for the series. While Dante always needs to worry about moving to his foes to keep style up, luckily Dante can have a move with Trickster that just makes him teleport in front of people. On top of that Dante has many moves that move him forward, like the classic Stinger. Nero’s arm makes enemies come to him because he can grab you from nearly anywhere! The reach of this move call Buster can get silly and on top of that you can combo a short grab into a big grab. This is the biggest thing with Nero and Itsuno knew how to makes this important. Every boss that Nero fights, has a unique animation for when he gets a big grab in for all foes, including bosses. The amount of excitement you can get from simply getting those big grabs on a boss is probably the best thing of this entire game.\n\nAnother thing to mention with Nero is his actor, Johnny Young Bosch. Another Power Ranger actor comes into the Devil May Cry cast since the last one did so well for them with portraying Vergil. They decided to get another one and we all know the Bosh is one of the top voice actors of the chain. Johnny really brought that badass attitude well for Nero and knowing his did motion capturing as well makes it a whole lot better too. Again, this man knows his physical acting too since he does know martial arts and even did stunt work for his time on Power Rangers and for other projects. It was another good pick to have this type of actor be with the Devil May Cry series.\n\nNero really stood out with his style of fighting while his character was not fully fleshed out, I do feel his next game is really going to highlight his reckless behavior and I bet he will learn and grow from that as well. One thing that people got to love early for him though was his connection to Vergil. We all know that Nero is the son of Vergil which still blows my mind that Vergil was the first one to have canon sex, especially for how Vergil was. The team easily knew that Vergil was still excited for and in a Special Edition we ended up getting him in this game, but during the initial run, Nero held the Yamato and his Devil Trigger was a different one with it. Nero already had a fully transformed arm, but his whole body does not change while in Devil Trigger, he summons a spirit that stands behind him (insert Jojo references here) and the best sword of the series is for Nero to use. Then remember the Buster? Well there are even more unique grab animations with Nero’s spirit. Nero’s use of the Devil Trigger is fun when you know how to stun foes and get in a grab while in Devil Trigger. With Dante and Vergil, you wanted Devil Trigger to not only get health, but also an edge in battle. You wanted to save the transformation with Nero and it does not hurt because Nero has many great tools to keep the fighting going without it.\n\nEven with a new main character, the original guy had to stay around and he is your first fight in this game, what?! While a tutorial fight for the most part, it is crazy to think you had to actually fight Dante and there is a legit boss fight later on. Dante does go through the curse of “What old weapons?” and only keeps his trusty Rebellion, Ebony and Ivory, and Coyote. When you do play as Dante one big change for him though was the style switch on the fly. In the third game, you had to stick with one style until the next mission screen or whenever you get to a statue. This fourth game decides to have Dante switch freely with them. Dante has five styles in this game which are; Trickster, Swordmaster, Gunslinger, Royalguard, and Dark Slayer. This idea really opens up the combo potential with Dante since the ability of switching with ease is amazing. Dante’s new weapons also really work with this. A fan favorite is the Lucifer and Trickster combinations since you can teleport around and keep throwing or setting projectiles. A new gun is given to Dante with the Pandora and Gunslinger really opens the possibilities with that one. Dante keeps a gauntlet weapon with Gilgamesh because of course he does. Then even Dante has Yamato which is why he has Dark Slayer. Just look up combo videos on Dante because this game is insane with them!\n\nOn top of that, how did Dante act in this game? It was stated that Nero could have been placed in while a younger Dante was originally planned for this game. Now we got Dante older than the original game. I will say they get a perfect mix of what makes Dante himself over the series. The only one that is not around would be Devil May Cry 2, for obvious reasons. Still he has the cool vibes of him from the original title and his silly antics from his youthful days. One cool thing to add is that Ruben had a lot more to do with this title and helped out with many hurdles the team was going through, especially with Dante. When Dante got Lucifer, the team had trouble thinking of how to show it off, so Ruben had a brilliant idea. This scene is a fan favorite for sure has Dante makes many sexual implications as he is thrusting many of his spikes into the slate, yes, it is glorious. One thing to note is that Dante is straight up untouchable in this game! We got to remember this is after Mundus and no one is still getting close to him yet.\n\nWhile Dante could easily just destroy everyone in sight there is far more to be done for his character. Dante gets to act like a mentor character for Nero which considering his has the blood of Sparda in his veins, it feels right. While his relation to Dante is obvious and I bet Dante actually knows. Having these two fights it out was a great way to not only establish Nero that he can take more than expected, but also show that Dante’s being overzealous can get the better of him. Then it’s fun to see their styles of cool clash with seeing how Dante and Nero taunt each other. Nero is far more aggressive and then Dante is just so playful (that little moment where Dante tries revving up his sword is the best!). Nero even gives him the bird when talking about Yamato. The mixture of having these two being playable was a smart move, but sadly that also brings a problem with this game.\n\nNo matter how many characters were added to this game, what does not help that there are really only like one or two unique bosses. Dante ends up fighting many of the same bosses that Nero does. Then if you play as Vergil you just got to do the whole campaign as him only and repeat all the boss encounters. In the whole campaign you got to fight the first three bosses like three times! Sure, you get one each with Dante and then when playing as Nero if you did not replay missions you can see how Nero fights these bosses with his Devil Trigger. Then you even repeat the same areas and sure some get a bit of a change or two and it makes it easier on repeat visits. Then it also gets old real fast when you have to repeat areas. At least with the third game you exploring and going back to old places felt better and that is thanks to how missions flowed in that game. This fourth game really drags things out.\n\nOverall, Devil May Cry 4 is an amazing game and has the best combat of the entire series. The insane combo videos that are still being made for this game will live on. While it took a while to get a proper sequel for this series, DMC4 and its Special Edition had tons of fan support that get this game around. The name Devil May Cry never died and when games like Bayonetta came out it only got more support. Sadly, the next Devil May Cry we end up getting was different so to say, but in the end, I will have to cover it at some point. For now, though I want to get ready for the real fifth entry of the franchise which I already played the demo and loved it, Nero feels like his old self, but his new arm really brings some amazing new and dumb things for him. These devils will never surrender.\n\nAlright here we are, we get to some great material here. This was a redemption for Hideki Itsuno where his first work was Devil May Cry 2, but that game was not his fault at all. Again being put on the team late in development meant he had to try his best to salvage something. His next appearance with the franchise will be with being the director once more for the third game in the series. Many consider this to be the highest peak of the franchise, sure not in the sales department, but for just being one of the best games not only for Capcom. This is considered the game that started the Character Action genre thanks to many new mechanics for the series. There is going to be a whole lot to cover with this game so I guess we should start with the man himself, Dante.\n\nDante in this game is completely different from his last two appearances. The first Dante acted like a smug superhero and in the sequel he was nearly silent. For the third game; with this being a prequel its the youngest Dante around and man he is a goofball. This started the trend of Dante being the lovable oaf and boy do we love him. Dante keeps the red coat of course and yet he decides to wear no shirt, at least he got pants on. Dante is a reckless youth for sure and with that comes a whole ton of style. Many of Dante’s actions can be seen as less efficient because he loves to drag a fight out and do something cool all the time. The introduction scene proves this since Dante has many foes stab him with their scythes and then he walks off like nothing happened. He proceeds to bust his jukebox to get one track to get him going. Dante eats pizza, slides on his enemies, and even does a Matrix stylized moment with billiard balls. This is one of the best tone establishments for any game around. Dante is no superhero or quiet type, he is loud and destructive!\n\nThis is also where the style goes all out here because there are many ways to be stylish. Dante starts out with four possible styles to play as. There is Trickster where you can dodge attacks with ease, Swordmaster gives you extra moves to use, Gunslinger gives you Devil May Cry 2’s gun mechanics with some extra flair, and Royalguard gives you a parry move that can also be used as an attack. The amount of options you got here is insane and sadly you can only be one at a time until you get to a new level or to the statues where you can change everything. The additions of new weapons are back and extremely varied. Of course Dante as his Rebellion which actually started in DMC2, the design here though is the one we know and love. Cerberus is the triple ice nunchuck that gets many hits in. Agni and Rudra are dual swords with elemental properties of fire and wind that gives you tons of movement attacks. Nevan an electric guitar weapon that can shoot projectiles and pillars of volts! Finally, we get to Beowolf a weapon with light properties that are the usual gauntlet weapons. The weapon selection is diverse here and with having two at all times to freely switch to, the experimentation is large. On top of that this is the game where the Devil Triggers became extremely popular. With help from the lead designer from the Shin Megami Tensei series we got amazing demonic looks for both Dante and his rival for this game.\n\nSo with Dante we easily got more fluid controls and freedom to do whatever you want and there are still two styles to use later on. The amount of things Dante got in this game is insane. For the most of his journey in this game, Dante is not a good person, like at all. We still end up loving him though because we see the tragedy he is living and it only gets worse later on. In the end though, Dante keep his smile and finds a true path to follow which we soon get to how he is like in the first game and his next appearance in the fourth game. Dante might be doing the unthinkable and yet still comes off an understandable character with flaws we can relate to. He deals with the death of his mother in an uncontrollable manner. He is only eighteen and who knows what he has been doing before those years. Taking revenge in the fun way was the best option for Dante since he needed to cope. With the first Dante, we loved him for being a silly hero. While still silly he became more relatable and those moments when he starts to become the hero feels enlightening and rewarding, since his biggest challenge is no joke in this game.\n\nWell time to gush about one of gaming’s greatest rival characters around. Like the hell with Gary Oak, it’s all about Vergil! Vergil has been shown in the series before when he was Nelo Angelo. We did not get a whole lot from him in that since he was being used by Mundus. This is Vergil’s true introduction to the series and it was a strong one, so strong that the reboot had to cash on this by making their own Vergil. It’s insane that he got this much love simply from one game, I’m not kidding. Sure Vergil got to be playable later on in DMC 3’s and 4’s special editions, but those happened later. The reason why Vergil worked so well was his relation to Dante and how similar they were and yet so different.\n\nThe first thing to notice with Vergil is his first scene where he kills the big reaper monster with one slice. This was technically the first boss in the game and many people had trouble with him when DMC3 first launched in the States since the difficulties were lying to them. The normal mode was actually on hard which I bet got people angry and getting good really fast. Dante wastes so much time with attacking demons and Vergil does the complete opposite. So high chance people will think Vergil is silent with his quick fighting style. Quite the different actually, he is stoic for sure, but not quiet. Hell, Vergil even has his own funny lines, he is just rather dry with his approach. On top of that both Dante and Vergil are young and still act like kids in many ways. They did not grow up properly as mentioned before.\n\nDante and Vergil lost their mother at a young age and with both of them, they wanted revenge. Dante made his business to hopefully find the demon one day, but in the end he soon made his business more about the people. Dante got to see what his father’s (Sparda) legacy does to other people and Dante felt responsible for that. With Vergil he focused on his revenge only and while selfish for sure, Vergil had a true purpose to fight unlike Dante in the beginning. Vergil made sure he did not want to feel that pain again and to do that he needed to become more powerful. Vergil aimed for his father’s legacy to make himself stronger so that he can prevent the pain he felt as a child. I feel many people ignore this side of Vergil and think of him as a bland character and yet that is not the case. Vergil is deeply wounded inside and while Dante hides it with silly antics, Vergil hides it with a stone cold face. These are two brothers fighting not only themselves, but are even fighting the pain in their hearts.\n\nSo with these two clashing not only in battle, but personalities this got to make a very amazing set of boss fights for Vergil. Oddly enough just like with Nelo Angelo you fought him three times. The third game repeats this and the scaling to them are amazing. Dante with no purpose loses the fight, when awakened with new powers he can stay toe to toe with Vergil, and then with a purpose in his heart he finally defeats Vergil. All three fights are huge stables for the franchise, especially the second fight because still to this day that second theme for Vergil is being remixed as we speak. The interactions of the protagonist and his foil are so important to any story. It’s amazing how in the early days people just knocked on Devil May Cry’s story and yet there is true structure here and gripping characters, which reminds me of a certain… Lady.\n\nMary who soon goes with the name Lady after she moves on from her past, is another big fan favorite in the series. With how Lady was used in this game was important since she is the sole reason why Dante got to see what trouble has been brewing up. Lady herself comes with family issues where her father wanted Sparda’s powers and did everything he could for that. This lead to the death of Lady’s mother and soon getting Lady packing heat for revenge. The comparisons to Lady and Trish are easy to note since they are female characters that help our main character. Trish reminded Dante of his mother and got Dante to express mercy after who knows how many years of demon slaying. Lady got to show Dante how important finding a purpose is and to defend people from the true horrors caused by his family. Lady with her lovely assortment of guns really showcases the first time a pure human can really fight in the hard task of demon slaying. Her best weapon the Kaliana Ann is a fan favorite weapon and even has a new version of it the upcoming fifth game. The giant rocket launcher is durable and explosive. This become more important later on in the fourth game as well since she was not all that present in the original version, Lady got to be playable later on.\n\nWhich comes to probably the most important part of why Devil May Cry 3 is so awesome, the beginning of an amazing cast. Ruben Lagden comes to play as Dante and fans loved his performance. The same for Daniel Southworth playing Vergil. When the motion capturing became a big thing for this game, they had to make sure to get actors that are ready for some stunts. Ruben even made sure to get someone like Southworth since he has experience with stunt acting before during his times with Power Rangers. The motion capturing really brought these characters to life and the scene directing was top-notch too. A big thing that ends up happening is that many moves end up coming from the scenes. Dante sliding on foes, Lady and Dante shooting each other’s bullets, and Vergil deflecting bullets with his sword. This game established the idea of making sure to make a scene with a move that can be done in the game. Hell you can even see Dante use Lady’s motorcycle as a weapon which is now a thing in the fifth game! So this mindset is still living on to this day.\n\nThis game even comes with many secrets that would be unable to pull off in today’s gaming age. One of Dante’s styles is the Doppleganger where he can summon a copy of himself to fight with. If you had a second controller plugged in and activate this mode, a second player can control the clone. The same even happens when Vergil fights alongside Dante which is funny to see Vergil being playable come in a later edition of the game since he could be used in the base game for a short moment. Devil May Cry 3 even continued the secret missions and a whole lot better this time around and did it in the original game’s fashion. Challenges that vary between fighting and knowing the game. This game also has a boss rush stage and its rewarding to fight bosses with all you got and you can do this whenever too. The game comes with a stage select as soon as you beat level one. You can easily grind and train on level one as long as you need to. The game while being challenging is never unforgiving since it gives you so many options to not only go back and play again and find new secrets and methods to fight hard bosses or simply kill enemies in more stylish flair.\n\nOverall it is no wonder why Devil May Cry 3 is a special game. Things could only get higher after the sequel and while it did not sell as well, the legacy this game has lived on longer for sure. This started a trend of Character Action games including the fourth game of the series. Also this was the era where Capcom had everybody following them. When Resident Evil 4 happened, everyone was doing the third person shooter. Then with Devil May Cry 3, everyone wanted to make an awesome action game. Devil May Cry 3 holds a big image with its Dante being a reckless youth being challenged by his twin brother who easily set himself forward more than Dante. Along with them was a feisty lady that got to show the strength of humans. The production on this game is special thanks to memorable performances and insane action pieces. Things should only get better after this since Devil May Cry finally gets to be on more than one platform with its fourth game and with it comes a new face.\n\nThis is not going to be an easy one. With the beginning of Devil May Cry, it is easy to define what makes it cool thanks to Hideki Kamiya putting his ideal of cool into the game. This sequel right here is an interesting one to look at. Sadly, Hideki Kamiya did not work on this title even though he was still working with Capcom. High chance Viewtiful Joe was taking his time. So, for this second game featuring the demon hunter Dante was handled by a new team. Development was not going well though and this was Hideki Itsuno’s first DMC title under his belt when he was thrown onto this project as the director. Poor Itsuno was tossed into a bad game from the start because knowing that the game was still slated for its original release date and have to get a full game done at the halfway mark already gone, there was no way of saving this game. Itsuno has talked about how when he was thrown into the project one of the few things that was fully done was the move Stinger. Still a big thing with this game is that the developers took notes from the fans’ responses to the first game and used it for number 2. What did people want and did they get it?\n\nFor the character Dante, fans grown to love his silly behavior that started from the first game. Now what we got in Devil May Cry 3 and 4 is still different from the original Dante. The original Dante as mentioned before acts like a Toksatsu hero which is something Kamiya has a soft spot for. Let us bring up one of the glaring problems of the original Dante though, his lines. Now this could have been because of translation errors or being translated too accurately and not changing them to fit English better, but who really knows. All I know the light about darkness reaching someone’s heart is up there with Zero’s “What am I fighting for?!” for one of the funniest moments in a Capcom game. Maybe some people had issues with that line or other lines possibly. The reason I bring this up is because Dante is mostly silent in the sequel. While this is a drastic change to the character can a silent protagonist be cool? The answer to that is yes, there have been many famous characters that barely speak a line, especially in video games. To be honest though I feel like Dante is tapping into a different type of media hero for this game and a good way to find that out is to look at some certain weapons.\n\nThose weapons are sadly not the swords because well there are just swords for new weapons, but there are many different types of guns still around and these things are broken. A big problem people had with the original game was that the guns were too weak. The sequel decided to make the guns stronger and they got some major steroids injected into them. This game also added some free aiming functions which oddly enough still continues to this day. Dante can shoot in all directions and he has some insane things with his guns in both gameplay and cutscenes. With this focus on the guns, could Dante be more focused on a Western hero, like cowboys and gunslingers? One character that comes to mind for me with this mentality of not talking all that much, but has some insane gun play would be The Man with No Name. Again, this is proving that having a character being silent is not impossible and conveying greatness can simply come from body language. DMC 2 simply tried to make Dante a different type of cool and while it did not work, people still love this design for Dante to this day. This design even got into Shin MegamiTensei 3. So, what is the reason why a silent Dante does not work?\n\nA big reason to bring up is that this game try to make lightning strike twice. Trish was a popular character and had high demand to be playable. There is a Trish option in the game, but in reality, her spotlight gets taken by a new female character, Lucia. With Lucia she happens to be a created being made by the villain of this game. If this sound familiar well that is because Trish was created by Mundus to lure Dante. While Trish had reason to be a created creature was that Dante still had trouble striking her down and had hope for her. Trish ends up becoming a better person and not a devil, because “Devils never cry.” This line is even repeated with Lucia when she tells Dante to kill her and she sheds a tear. So not only does it feel that Dante is not giving his all, the overall game’s presentation isn’t either. Everything just comes across as boring.\n\nWhile a new character is playable her effect on the series was not a strong one. I get that the idea of twin swords and throwing weapons such as knives and grenades fits Devil May Cry well enough, but again DMC 2 just fails at the concept. I mean you can even look at Lucia’s design and see she has a reverse color palette compared to Dante. Dante with white hair and a red outfit compared to the red haired, Lucia wearing a white outfit. I see the parallel here and I think they wanted to try and make a new female be more comparable to Dante this time around. Sadly, Dante in this game is near mute and Lucia comes off as a half-baked character. The lack of lines does not help at all too. So, can Lucia be considered cool? She has her own version of a Devil Trigger which has a nice design being an angelic looking demon. Another interesting concept to work with, but again just never comes to full fruition. At least Bayonetta gave us the female Dante we needed.\n\nFor weapons… yea the variety is gone this time for something a bit simpler to wrap around. I am not sure if this was an asked for thing, but high chance this was just because of time restraints more than anything else. Dante gets three swords and five guns, Lucia gets three sets of swords and five throwable weapons, and Trish has Sparda. Yes, oddly enough Trish using Sparda started here and she can do her famous toss with that weapon here too. This is going to be a point I will bring up when we get to another game in the series about making things easier. While being easy can be good for new players sometimes it gets rid of some flashy aspects. Back in the days people could not making everything a quick time event. The original DMC had so much charm because it had flair that even I am still amazed could have been done on the Playstation 2. So, making things easier this time around really ends up making the sequel shallower than anything. Sword combos were too simple and guns just broke the game where Dante can just stand still most of the time. The whole idea of Dante moving around constantly and changing into a completely different weapon is gone. Now these days we have easy combat that looks flashy and people will praise that even if it’s the same thing as just pressing one button over and over again with no variety.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI am going to make some enemies here.\n\nWhat is there left to say for Devil May Cry 2, it was a train wreck from the start with the idea of having a different team work on this. I feel like if this project was just given to Kamiya and his team, this sequel would have been better. In the end though, this game ended up leading to much more than any would think. Future games in this series took notes from it and even expanding on the gun mechanics. There are even rumors among fans that the second game is going to be canon thanks to Devil May Cry 5. Hideki Itsuno did start out with a dud game, but he never fully forgot it. He ended up taking ideas and using them for other sequels which leads us to the third game of the series. Devil May Cry 3, the game that started the Character Action genre as we know it and is arguably not only the best Devil May Cry game, but another one of Capcom’s royal pieces of treasure.\n\nI am also going through DMC2 right now on my LP channel.\n\nDMC2 Playlist\n\nWelcome to a new series of posts I will be making around the Devil May Cry series. Originally, I was thinking of just making one post about why Dante is cool, but that would betray the entire point of asking why things are cool to begin with. Yes, Dante is our main character for three whole games (four if you count reboot) and while for the fourth game he took a more mentor-like role it seems that the fifth game is going to be good with sharing the spotlight this time around. There will still be a look into why Dante is amazing, but we still have other characters in this series. These games rarely have a large supporting cast, but each game still has a distinct cast at the very least. Then along the series there are many different things to talk about with presentation and mechanics. Also, I will be looking at every game in the series which will include the first sequel and the reboot. While I may not like those games there is still something to look at because Devil May Cry always tries to be the stylish game. It started a new era of action games into what we know as Character Action games now these days. With that all said, let us take a look into the game that started it all, Devil May Cry.\n\nProbably the first thing to talk about with the original game is the director of this game, Hideki Kamiya. Before the days of Platinum and Bayonetta, Kamiya was working with Capcom and made some damn important games. The focus here being Devil May Cry and later on we got Viewtiful Joe and Okami down the line. Even Shinji Mikami has some presence with this title as well since DMC was originally Resident Evil 4. Capcom says the high sense of action is the reason why it got changed and I bet that is a case when you do look at the Resident Evil 4 we did get, even if the fifth and sixth games went on that path in the end. I also feel that the use of demons could have been a reason for the departure as well since we always dealt with bio terrorism. Still there is something important about what these two game creators brought to the table for the first game and that is what is cool to them.\n\nFor Kamiya, he made Dante to be the spitting image of the awesome guy we all want to be. Which if you find an image of him while he was younger and looking at something like Viewtiful Joe and Wonderful 101, you can tell this guy liked his superheroes. Now when I say that keep in mind, he is a Japanese man and while Japan has a love for the American heroes, they have their own history with heroes as well. A big part of that history would be the Tokusatsu genre. Super Sentai, Kamen Rider, Metal Heroes, and Ultraman four franchises with a lot to offer and then there are one shot series that did belong to a franchise. With Wonderful 101 we see the Sentai elements for sure and I think Carranger is probably one of the best ones to look at for the comparisons. Viewtiful Joe clearly takes pages from the single hero aspects which would be a lot, but he has a Rider Kick so that helps out. So, what would Dante be? I think he would be the Kamen Rider as well. Knowing that those shows are for kids can also explain Dante’s behavior. He would rarely swear and never drinks or smokes. On top of that Dante has his Devil Trigger which gives him a brief transformation. The original riders were cyborgs who were already strong, but their transformed state shows off their true potential. Dante is a demon/human hyrbrid and his demon form would be the transformation. I can easily link the Showa era of Kamen Rider clearly inspired the Dante we know from the first game.\n\nAs for Shinji Mikami that has to deal with the character Trish. While Kamiya had his dream hero, Shinji had his dream girl in Devil May Cry. From what I know from Hideo Kojima, there are sure some Japanese men who love blonde bombshells. Trish would be no exception to this since that is what she is. Hell, she even has a female biker look something that Jeane would pick up in her Bayonetta 2 look. Funny enough Jeane is actually Kamiya’s dream girl so the idea for the secondary to be someone’s fictional crush stuck in Bayonetta even. Along with Trish’s black costume and of course them being tights I guess you could stick that into some bondage territory. This could mean Trish is a dominating woman and seeing how the first thing she does is impale Dante with a sword and then throw her motorcycle at him, yea Trish is no pushover. So, Shinji likes a woman who plays rough and oddly enough the game he is not a part of is where Jill Valentine becomes a blonde.\n\nNow we get to one of the biggest core concepts of Devil May Cry and that is how danger is shown. For Dante danger is barely a thought at times as he would rarely show himself having a hard time. This motivates the player to be the best and keep up that stylish direction while playing the character. For the first game I bet people felt good in the beginning since all you were really facing were demonic puppets. Then you get Alastor and stop unleashing your full move set and the Devil Trigger. Now the player is feeling awesome doing stingers and million stabs and I bet feels a bit invincible right now. The game does a great job of showing you things are only going to get harder when the first boss appears, Phantom. Now these days people know the way around him, but in the beginning this boss caused people to go on that easy option. Phantom was a boss that would deliver all the pain and would rarely stop his assault. I bet many players were then shocked to see Dante glance him off then in the scene right after you actually beat him. To me this motivates a player to make sure Dante keeps the image of being the cool guy and the game even ranks you on your performance even. This ranking system would then be in mostly every action game afterwards, even No More Heroes had one and its back in Travis Strikes Again.\n\nAnother aspect of Devil May Cry would be all the weapons you can get in this game. You start out with swords and guns. The guns start to change some principles as the shotgun is nothing like the pistols. This is already showing you that your input and opinions are important here. Do you want to get right in a demon’s face the hit hard with the shotgun or do you want to space yourself out with the pistols? Then while getting some other swords like Force Edge and Sparda, the gauntlet weapon Ifrit really stands out and becomes a stable in the franchise. This was a big part about being stylish since you could not just stick to one thing at a time. You could change on the fly like in other titles, but the game always wanted you to try everything out and learn. Variety lead to many good rewards in this game and even some bad ones like the swimming sections. Then a weapon like Sparda was completely different from your usual sword flair. Knowing when to use certain weapons was a big part of why action games started to always give you a large pool of weapons, because one player does better with one thing than another and vice versa.\n\nOnto the next boss is the third most important character, Nelo Angelo. With Phantom this demon had some lines with Dante and of course in Dante fashion talks trash at the demonic spider scorpion. Then comes the new boss where Dante already likes the look of him which just has Angelo snapping his finger and walk outside while prompting Dante that this fight is happening outside. Nelo Angelo even taunts you during your fights and you start to see something, this boss fights similarly to you. I will save this for later, but Nelo Angelo did start a popular trend of fighting a FOIL. Nelo Angelo has such a strong presence and soon with other demons we get to see that Dante does appreciate that they bring a good fight. Dante has fun with fights even if he has a mission to complete in the end. It is like he is finding stress relief during a task that would be stress inducing. We can even see that later with Leon in RE4 so Capcom must have loved the idea of a badass acting like nothing is wrong, insert your bingo joke here. Things do start to break though as Dante gets to learn about a certain demon.\n\nMundus the demon that is responsible for the death of Dante’s mother and the demise of his brother. Throughout the story of this game, Dante sees Thunderhawk get killed by Mundus in cruel fashion. Dante actually got to respect Thunderhawk and seeing the demon bird get killed with no remorse bothered Dante. We now finally get to a demon that irks Dante and Mundus is no joke. The path leading to Mundus is a nice spectacle of itself. In the game the journey has you fighting demons in this wrecked castle and some of these demons were ugly. They spewed out so many liquids out of them and never look refined at all. Getting to Mundus though we get to see a chapel like area where Mundus has himself as a statue. He hides behind this shell to make himself look like a god which he is trying to achieve. When you fight him though you get to see the ugly parts inside of him as he is just like the others. This is something Bayonetta continued with having angels being the villains, they look regal on the outside, but peeling away their armor shows their true self. This is also Dante’s hardest fight to this day as no one else comes close to this since Dante has to turn into the spitting image of his father to finally settle the score.\n\nWe get to see a lot from Dante in this first game. In the beginning he acts like the hot shot with barely breaking a sweat. We see that he honors his foes and appreciates a good fight. Dante even has a soft spot for his family since Trish resembles his mother and when defeating Nelo Angelo he knew that his brother is now gone from his life. Then with Trish even if she betrayed him, Dante still could never deal a killing blow to her. Not only since Trish looked like his mother, he still had hope that she would be a good person in the end. Sure, the line delivery was a bit awful, but the idea is still there. It is great to feel awesome playing as a stylish action character and Dante can also hit to the fields with his personality, something which we will easily get to at many later points.\n\nSo, the first Devil May Cry is a flawed game, but oddly enough still holds up thanks to Kamiya’s direction. The first game also leads to sequels wanting to continue on certain aspects and possibly change the cool aspects too. Some lead to the franchise evolving and then others were just ignored or even caused a bit of chaos in the circles. Either way with the first game it was obvious it was trying to be the awesome game. While a bit limited because of the times the presence of Devil May Cry is still strong. The big thing with the first game is variety as you do fight a whole lot, but the mixture of Resident Evil puzzles, swimming in a first-person view, and even having a shooter fight can be found in action games later on. The puzzles have always been around, swimming did continue for a bit, and the shooting segments lived on in Bayonetta. Then of course the feeling of being cool exists in many other games after it, except for the sequel which is another story.\n\nNext one is going to be a hard one to do…"
