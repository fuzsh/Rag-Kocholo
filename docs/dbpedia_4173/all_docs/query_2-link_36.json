        "text": "Y/N POV\n\nI descended another flight of stairs, deeper into the tower when suddenly I felt the entire place begin shaking once again. I nearly lost my footing but I was able to lean against the nearby wall. I growled to myself \"Arkham must be opening the gateway to the Demon world.\n\nI quickened my pace from here, I knew it was crucial that I reach the top of Temen-Ni-Gru. I knew that woman wouldn't stand a chance against Arkham and to be honest, if Sparda's power was like people said, I doubted even Dante would be able to defeat him alone.\n\nSpeaking of Dante and that woman, my trek lead me to what appeared to be one massive drop downwards. As unlikely as it would seem, I had a hunch this was my best bet, which seems strange considering that I wanted to be going up and this was a massive drop downwards.\n\nAnyway, I leapt down the hole and landed at the bottom, looking straight ahead, I was met with a door. As I got closer, I could hear the sound of gunfire, explosions and blades striking one another, As I opened said door, I bet you can guess who I came across.\n\nOn the other side of the door was some kind of library, as soon as I entered, I narrowly ducked a very familiar rocket, which flew through the now-open door and exploded behind me. I turned around and was instantly met with an ensuing battle between Dante and that same woman. She fired a series of rockets and grenades at him as he dodged repeatedly.\n\nI sighed in annoyance before drawing both Light and Dark, my two Hook Swords. As the woman used her grapple hook to pull herself upwards and Dante leapt up to meet her in mid-air, I also leapt upwards.\n\nAs Dante and the woman went to slash at one another with Rebellion and the bayonet of the rocket launcher respectively, I leapt in between then and spread Light and Dark out to the sides, effectively blocking both their attacks.\n\nI forced them to separate as all three of us landed back on the ground, I looked between both of them and sternly said \"That's enough you two! There are more important issues going on here than whatever petty squabble you are having.\"\n\nThe woman spoke up first, warning me \"Y/N, step aside, this doesn't concern you. The only reason I'm letting you live is because of how much you've helped me. This demon on the other hand-\"\n\nDante retorted \"Oh yeah? What did little old me do wrong?\" I was growing frustrated as I yelled \"Be quiet both of you!\" The woman added \"I told you to stay out of this Y/N.\" She then began attacking Dante one again.\n\nAnd again, I intervened. As she went in for a slashing attack, I withdrew Light and instead just used Dark to block her attack. I stared at her, not angrily but strictly. The woman stepped back abruptly and used her grapple to get a distance.\n\nShe fired a rocket in our direction which we both dodged easily. I looked up to see the woman standing on top of one of the bookshelves. She ignored me and instead aimed her rocket launcher towards Dante and fired another round.\n\nHe dodged it and instantly retaliated by drawing his two handguns and shooting towards her. I don't know why, but I actually found myself leaping in the way, slicing through all the bullets except one which landed in my shoulder earning a pained grunt.\n\nI landed back on the ground and Dante instantly asked \"What was that for?\" I looked up at him and said \"This fight is senseless. But if it shuts the two of you up, then go ahead.\" Dante didn't need to be told twice as he rushed towards the woman, handguns drawn.\n\nThe two battled for some time, I just leaned against one of the wall and watched, there was no point trying to get in the way of these two. The fight didn't last long though and in the end the woman was left leaning against one of the bookshelves.\n\nShe attempted to fire numerous rounds at him however they all missed and eventually she ran out of ammunition. Dante leaned closer to her, in a somewhat uncomfortable manner, I heard him mutter \"I'll take care of him.\" He tried to get closer but she looked away, clearly uninterested.\n\nAs Dante stepped away, the woman asked \"Why do you care so much?\" Dante responded \"This whole business started, with mine and Y/N's father, sealing the entrance between the two worlds. And now, our brother's trying to break that spell and turn everything into demonville. This is our family matter too.\"\n\nHe turned away again, continuing \"Quite frankly, at first, I didn't give a damn. But because of you, I know what's important now, I know what I need to do.\" I stepped forward and said in a calm tone \"Hey.\"\n\nThis gained their attention as I spoke up, addressing the woman \"Lady, Mary, Miss, whatever I can call you. Do you know why I always helped you?\" She looked confused, I stepped forward, placed a gentle hand on her shoulder and continued.\n\n\"It's because I've been where you are. As I told you, my mother was a human and she was brutally killed right in front of me by a horde of demons, I never found our who sent the demons aside from seeing a black mist that appeared over our house with what seemed like three glowing red eyes watching. I don't know how I survived, but I spent the next several years hunting demons, hoping I would find the one responsible. That lead me to right now.\"\n\nI paused for a moment, both Dante and the woman were listening as I continued \"Can you imagine how it felt when Vergil told me I myself was a Demon? The very thing I swore to exterminate? But now, I have a chance to right that wrong in my life.\"\n\nI turned to leave, Dante close behind until we heard the woman saying \"Wait.\" We turned around as Dante said \"Trust me. I'll make things right for you.\" He turned to me and said \"Both of you.\" He finished by saying \"That's what MY soul is telling me to do.\"\n\nThe woman reached for her rocket launcher and held it out towards both me and Dante, saying \"Use this.\" Dante asked \"How much is it gonna cost me?\" The woman replied \"It's free for Y/N, but you can give me your name.\" Dante responded with his own name \"Dante.\"\n\nShe held the rocket launcher out again and I gently took it into my hands. I slung it over my shoulder before surprisingly, gently placing my hand on the woman's shoulder again, we just stared at one another in silence before I turned to follow Dante out of the room.\n\nAs we were walking out, the woman once again called out \"Y/N, Dante.\" We turned around as she begged \"Please, free my father.\" We both nodded as Dante calmly said \"We will.\" I added \"Lady.\" Before the two of us left the room completely.\n\nAuthor's Note: And that's it for this chapter, unlike the last one, I really enjoyed writing this one so I really hope that you also enjoyed it. We're nearing the end of the segment with only three chapters left, I really hope you like them and as always, thank you for reading."
