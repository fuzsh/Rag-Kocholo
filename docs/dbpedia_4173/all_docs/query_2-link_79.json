Mysteriously, Vergil had seemingly disappeared from the face of the earth years ago... ...Surrounding Vergil are countless fierce demons! Although both Dante and Vergil share the same blood of Sparda, they have completely different goals. And so Dante heads off towards the tower, to settle things once and for all with Vergil. Meanwhile, the devil hunter Lady is also making her way towards this mysterious tower, with a score of her own to settle. And so, the wheels of fate start to turn for the humans, demons, and men who are both. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Controls ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Left Analog stick - move around Right Analog Stick - Move camera up - Item Menu left - file menu right - map down -equip menu D-pad when not in the game, move cursor Triangle - Devil Arm Attack Square - Gun Attack X - Jump Circle - Style move, check, cancel L1 - Devil Trigger Mode, cancel Devil Trigger Mode L2 - Switch guns L3 - (while holding R1), change lock-on target R1 - Lock-on target R2 - Change Devil Arms R3- Reset Camera Select - Taunt Start - Subscreen ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Characters ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Dante - The hero of this who series.

The Legend of Sparda. When I was young my father would tell me stories about it. Long ago, in ancient times, a demon rebelled against his own kind for the sake of the human race. With his sword, he shut the portal to the demonic realm and sealed the evil entities off from our human world. But since he was a demon himself, his power was also trapped on the other side. I never believed it. I thought it was a child's fairy tale. But I discovered that this so called legend wasn't a myth at all. Sparda existed. How do I know? Well...I met the sons of Sparda. Both of them, Though the same blood of their father flowed through their veins, the two battled each other fiercely like arch enemies. It seemed as if they derived some sort of twisted pleasure from this brotherly fighting. *Dante is disarmed, stabbed, then he falls* But in the end...onky one was left standing. *Vergil runs back and lunges then fade to black* ******************************************************************************* (Mission 1 - Crazy Party. Violent Response to an Insane Caller) +Cutscene+ The phone rings as Dante gets out the shower. He flips the chair into an upright position, sits, and nonchalantly answers the phone. Dante: Sorry not open for business yet. *Nonchalantly hangs up the phone and grabs a slice of pizza* I haven't even picked a name for this joint and I'm already getting calls. Arkham stands at the door, looks around, walks in and looks around some more. Dante: You a customer too? Well if you want to use the bathroom, help yourself. The toilet's in the back. Arkham: Are you Dante? Son of Sparda? Dante: Where did you hear that? Arkham: from your brother. *Looks at Dante's amulet* He sent this invitation for you. Please accept it. Arkham flips over the table as Dante does a back flip away from it and lands on its side, and grabs his Ivory gun out the air then holsters it. Dante: Invitation huh? *Catches pizza box and gets ready to eat a slice when a gang of 1st Hell Prides stick their sickles into him in a failed ambush. Dante survives this attack like it's nothing and pushes one away and walks around dragging anothe 1st Hell Pride and pushes it off and picks up another pizza slice after passing his Ebony gun. He then removes the sickle piece and throws it at the ceiling fan and knocks it down onto more 1st Hell Prides. Dante: This party's just getting crazy! Let's rock! Jukebox fails to work. Dante smashes it and the music plays while Dante fights off more 1st Hell Prides in style. Dante: The end? Don't bet on it. +end cutscene+ -Dante's office- Seriously now, do we necessarily need to tell you how to beat this first level? You only encounter 1st Hell Prides and 7th Hell Lusts. All you gotta do is shoot everyone tha moves (or slash them if you prefer). Just concentrate on getting the red orb and raising the combo bar as high as possible. This is a good level to practice your skills. There are hidden red orbs in the drums in the corner. +cutscene+ The ceiling falls down, Dante goes for his pizza but a 7th Hell Lust steps on it and Dante kills it. Dante takes his coat and walks off. +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 2 - The Blood Link. Bludgeon the Devils like an iron hammer.) +cutscene+ Dante walks out of his building and notices the wreckage as a crowd of 1st Hell Prides surround him. Dante: Damn it! You guys totally wrecked my shop. And I haven't even named it yet. You're gonna pay for that. *tosses up Rebellion sword and throws his coat on and grabs Rebellion and sneezes as the rest of the building falls* I hope you have enough to cover all this. +end cutscene+ -Dante's Office: Front- The enemies here are 1st hell Prides, 3rd hell Wraths and 7th Hell Lusts. When dealing with 3rd Hell Wraths, try to shoot from afar because the explosion can hurt you. The explosion can hurt other enemies too. Be sure to get the vital Star S next to the steps. Once everyone is down, you have your first boss fight ------ Boss Fight: Hell Vanguard Be sure to attack from the rear. When it tries to swing at you, jump behind it and slash it. There are times when you can clash swords with enemies and here is one of them. Clash up to three times and move out the way. This raises the combo bar a little. You can pummel it a little bit from there too. ------ +cutscene+ A tower rises out of nowhere in the middle of the city and Dante looks up. Dante: It's been nearly a year since we last met. Where does the time go? Vergil looks down as the Hell Vanguard retreats. Dante: No doubt you've got some fun planned for me. Right Vergil? +End cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 3 - The Devil's Tower. Invade the colossal tower.) +cutscene+ Vergil: Arkham Arkham: Well? Doesn't it excite you? The Temen-ni-gru has revived. The Great One who ruled this earth as the medium between the Human World and the Demon World. Isn't it a magnificent view? The greatest minds of their time. Those who revered evil, constructed this glorious edifice. Now after two milleniums of confinement it can at last fulfill the purpose for which it was intended. Vergil: That's none of my concern. Did he have it? Arkham: Of course. he's taking good care of it. After all it is the only momento left from the mother you both lost. Vergil: But he has no idea of its true power. The Hell Vanguard arrives and gets slain by Vergil. *cut to scene of Lady riding her motorcycle* Lady: I found it. 1st Hell Prides arrive and lady burns them with the back burner of her motorcycle as she speeds off. -66th Slum Avenue- Walk forward for a scene of arriving Enigmas. Now take on the 1st Hell Prides, 3rd hell Wraths, and 7th Hell Lusts and use the wall jump to get the Enigmas above, The Drive is a good way to earn a stylish combo. Enter the door at the end. -Bullseye- There is a blue barrier in the room. Smash everything for red orbs and a green orb in the place above. Behind the slot machines is a Demon crest. hit it till all torches light up and break the barrier. You can get the shotgun from the wall and enter the door. -Love Planet- A new enemy by the name of 4th Hell Sloths join the usual 1st Hell Prides and 7th Hell Lusts in this fight. You will notice the red barrier in the area. You must kill everyone to destroy it. There is a pole to use to swing and kick enemies. When they are all gone, exit to 13h Avenue. -13th Avenue- There are hidden red orbs behind the L in Love Planet sign. There are no enemies to fight. Take out the dumpsters for more red orbs. There is a statue where you must perform a Crazy combo to break it for a red orb and a blue orb fragment. There is another blue fragment in the area. You can go to a secret mission in this area and defeat all enemies in the alloted time for a blue orb fragment. +cutscene+ Cerberus breaks out of the ice. Cerberus: Leave now mortal! The likes of you are forbidden in this land! You who are powerless are not worthy to set foot here. Dante: Wow I've never seen a talking mutt before. You know in a dog show, you'd definitely take first place. Cerberus: You a mere human, make a mockery of me?! *blows ice beam which Dante dodges.* Dante: Easy Fido!. How about I take you for a walk? Come on Puppy, let's go. Cerberus: You'll regret this you worm. Dante: It's showtime. Come on! +end cutscene+ ------ Boss Fight: Cerbeus How original, Capcom? We seen a moster like this in Megaman Zero 3. Shoot off the ice from its heads and attack the legs to make it lay down in pain and pummel the heads. When it rears back, it will rain ice crystals on you and if it raises a leg, it will stomp and send a wave of icicles. If it charges up a beam, it will fire a block of ice or three later on. On occassion, it will freeze the floor and you must stay off of it. As it losses energy, it will start swiping at you wildly. It will also lunge at you too, so shoot at it or use a Striker as it is being pulled back. Soon the heads will be destroyed and victory and the Cerbeus Nunchackus are yours. The Trickster Style is recommended in this fight. ------ +cutscene+ Cerberus: You are not human aren't you? Dante: Who knows? Sometimes I ask myself. Cerberus: I acknowledge your ability. Take my soul and go forth! You have my blessing! *explodes* Dante takes the Cerberus nunchackus and practices. Dante: Too easy! Dante walks away as lady barges in and almost runs over Dante with her motorcycle. Dante: Are you going to the party? What's the hurry? Did you get an invitation? Lady fires a rocket which Dante avoids then rides like it's a surfboard and directs it at the ceiling. Lady wheelie jumps over Dante and leaves. Dante: This just keeps getting better and better. +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 4 - The Uninvited One. Find the key to the stairs.) +cutscene+ Vergil: Looks like we have an uninvited guest! Arkham: Is that so? Vergil: A human! A woman! Arkham: I'm afraid I should ask the uninvited one to leave. *gets up* That is what you want. Vergil: Actually, I happened to be acquainted with that woman. Arkham: *walks off* A storm is approaching. +end cutscene+ -Chamber of Echoes- There are crimson flames surrounding a doorway so ignore it for now and make your way up the steps and get all the red orbs as you can and enter the blue door.

The future knows no bounds for those who deftly march to meet it.\" Then enter the red door. ------ Boss Fight: Gigapede The trick is to stay on its back and slash it to pieces with the rebellion or the Cerebus Nunchakus. If you have an Air Hike, then you can stay on its back easier especially when it flips over. Just watch for electricity and you should take too much damage if any. ------ Enter the door and grab the shining object. This is the Astronomical Board. +cutscene+ Dante tries to show the door open but it won't open. Then he tries to kick it down to no avail. he pulls out Ebony n Ivory but Jester stops him. Jester: Yoo hoo! There's no need to use violence, devil boy. Wait, wait, wait, you better listen to what others say, lad. *Dante puts down guns* This tower is very sturdy you see. Your tricks will do no good. No good! Dante: *hold gun to Jester's nose* Zip it, or I'll pierce that big nose. Jester: That could be a problem! Just hear me out. You've got nothing to lose, right? My name is Jester, and I know a thing or two about this place. That thing there is a power generator this entire sector. In order to open the door, you need to apply a little SOMETHING to it first. Do you know what that is kid or is that too difficult for you? *laughs* Dante shoots at jester's feet and makes him dance (seems like Jester danced on purpose). Dante: Get to the point or do you wanna keep dancing? Jester: Actually, I prefer a sword to be my partner. *bows* May I have a dance my lady? Dante swing Rebellion but misses Jester and hits the stone and the door rises. Jester: Bingo! That is what the something is. Remeber that kid. Write it down on your hand if you don't trust your head! *dances as Dante shoots at him* Dante: I see! Thanks! You still piss me off though! +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 5 - Of Devils and Swords. Unleash your might on the Gatekeepers.) Dante walks in Jester: Thanks for destroying the lock for me, devil boy. And welcome to hell. Please accept my gift. Don't be humble, just take it. *Blood oozes from the fountain* After all, we're buddies aren't we? Out comes BloodGoyles, Dante knocks one of them into the wall. Dante: Well isn't that special? To be honest, I was expecting something a little better than this. +end cutscene+ Shoot the bloodgoyles till they petrify them finish them off with devil arm attacks. Exit out the red door then out the green one. This puts you back at the Chamber of Echoes. -Chamber of Echoes- Head up the stairs and insert the Astological Device into the round figure. A portal similar to the Air Hike forms at the very bottom in the center. Drop down a few levels and get a shining object which is the Vajura. Go back to the blue door and return to the Living Statue Room. In the area in the opposite direction of the cage at the very top, is where you insert the Vajura at the end. The cage rises and you can get the Soul of Steel. Defeat all Enigmas and 6th hell Gluttonies and return to the Chamber of Echoes. Use the Air Hike in the center to make it to get back to the green door at the higher level. Now you can run over the pit without falling and reach the other side. Use the Cerberus nuchackus on the statue for an Alright combo and get a Blue orb fragment. Use the soul of steel on the wall and it will reveal a door. -Surge of Fortunes- Before going to the elevator, try out Secret Mission 2 and kill all Enigmas without getting touched for a Blue orb fragment. After you hit the demon crest till the flames are all lit then get on the elevator. 1st Hell Prides will cause the elevator to fall if too many get on so kill them or knock them off quickly till you reach the top. -Azure Garden- Get the three red orbs above then go outside and jump on a column for 1000 red orbs. Go around and smash everything for red orbs and a green one. use the God of Time if necessary then enter the door. +cutscene+ Rudra: look Brother! It's been ages, but we finally have company Agni: I see that! Rudra: We must entertain our guest! Agni: You're right! We have to come up with something! Rudra: Brother, our guest is sighing. Agni: SIGH? What is SIGH? Rudra: Well a sigh is when... Dante: Enough already. How long are you two gonna keep carrying on like this? In case you didn't get the hint, I'll spell it out. Your guest wants to go through. Got it. Rudra: Our job here is to guard this door. Agni: That's right! We cannot let you pass *both break out the stones and attack* +end cutscene+ ------ Boss Fight: Agni and Rudra To make this hard battle easy to finish, be sure to kill one brother when the other one is on deaths door so the other one won't have time to get the other sword and make like hell for you. Use Trickster style and if you have it at Level 2 then you can air dash. Avoid all attacks and boy we hate that camera. It's hard to see what coming. Avoid the swing and hit the brothers from behind. If you want to play dirty, fool the brothers into hitting one another to help. Agni uses fire and Rudra uses wind. Avoid these attacks because they do lots of damage and you might need a star to help you along. Clashing weapons, stuns them and do it enough times, they'll lose their weapon temporarily and will be open for more damage. If they charge away, pump Ebony n Ivory bullets into them and avoid their upcoming charges or stomps. Hang in their and you'll get the Agni n Rudra blades. The trickster style level 2 helps a lot since the Air Dash helps you avoid attacks better. ------ +cutscene+ Rudra: Wait Agni: Yes, wait. We have been waiting for a long time! Rudra: Yes a very long time. Agni: For someone stronger than us Rudra: Someone who can control us. Agni: My name is Agni Rudra: And my name is Rudra. You shall take us with you. Both: we could be a great help to you! Dante: Okay, but on one condition. A&R: What is it? Name it! Danter: No talking. Agni: Fair Enough! Rudra: As you wish. Dante practices Rudra: Impressive. Dante bangs the swords together. Dante: no talking. *silence* Good. +end cutscene+ Go through the door to end Mission 5. ******************************************************************************* (Mission 6 - Family Ties. Clear the trial and forge a new path.) +cutscene+ No words here. Just a cutscene of Lady fighting off various enemies. Once they are all gone she takes off and leaves. +end cutscene+ -Goddess Chamber- Go back to the spot before you fought Agni and Rudra and get the red orbs and green one and return to the start. Run up the stairs and examine the statue. It says \"The goddess statue's piercing stare is focused on the front door.\" Stand on the statue to get 2000 red orbs. -Chamber of Three Trials- Use the God of Time if needed. There are four stones. The one in front says: Passing one trial still shows lacking. Passing two trials expands horizons. Passing all trials unlocks one's true potential. The three stones behind it talk about the Trials of Wisdom, Skill, and of the Warrior. You can take the trials in any order but we recommend that you try the trial of the warrior first since its the hardest and the other trials will be a piece of cake once you are done with it. -Trial of the warrior- Inscription: Your warrior's heart will be put to the test in the chamber ahead. Light all of the crests to supress the evil spirit's rage. This means you need to light both demon crests to cause damage to the enemies in this room. It's a wild fight but if you made it this far, this is no sweat if you take your time to light the crests before getting attacked. You fight 1st Hell: Prides, 3rd Hell: Wraths, 4th Hell: Sloths, and 7th hell: Lusts. You'll get the Essence of Fighting as a prize. -Trial of Skill- Now on to the trial of Skill. Get past this and the last trial is a cakewalk. Inscription: Your techniques will be put to the test in the chamber ahead, overcome the onslaught of obstacles to guarantee your future. The rows of spikes inch towards you as you move forward, move to the opposite side of the ones coming from the sides. Run under the ceiling ones and jump over the floor ones on the way to the Essence of Technique. It ain't over yet. 6th Hell Gluttonies and Enigmas appear and attack. You have the option of fighting them but if you are low on health, just run on out. There is no red barrier here. -Trial of Wisdon- This is too easy. Inscription: Your wisdom will be put to the test in the chamber ahead. use your lifetime experience from the crawling infant; to the man standing tall; and finally to the old man leaning on his cane. In other words, look at the number of dots above the door. Enter the door with four above since it represents the crawling infant, then enter the door with two dots since it represents the man standing tall, and then the door with three since it represents the old man leaning on his can. Basically, each dot represents the number of legs you walk on in your lifetime. The Essence of Wisdom is yours. Walk back to the Goddess Statue and enter the three essences. The first one has no effect, the second one blows away the rocks blocking the exit. The third one gets you the Artemis gun. -Dark Corridor- Use the Agi n Rudra swords on the statue to get an Alright combo and a Blue orb fragment and wall jump for the red orbs. Get the red orbs above the stairs and move on. +cutscene+ Lady is reloading her guns and gets up. Arkham: Well Well Lady points a gun at the directon of the voice Arkham: You've grown sronger. Lady: Go to Hell. Arkham: You point a gun at me? Your own kin? Your dear papa? Lady: The only family I ever had was my mother, and she's dead! *shoots at Arkham* Arkham: You break my heart. After all, it was I who gave you your name... my darling daughter. *drops a book on Lady's face and tosses her off the cliff as she is falling, she shoots back at him and nicks his chin with a bullet as she falls into the abyss.* ******************************************************************************* (Mission 7 - A chance meeting. Duel of the demon's children.) +cutsecene+ Lady falls but Dante catches her by the foot Dante: Well, this is my kind of rain. No wonder the sky looks so funny today. Lady: Let me go! Dante: let you go? But it would be a waste if you ended up as just a pretty stain. Lady shoots Dante in the head and falls some more using the knofe of the gun to break her fall and the gun as a perch. Dante: What the hell was that for? Here I am trying to help you and you show your gratitude by shooting me?! *gets shot in the head again* Whatever, do as you please. Lady: So he's a demon too... Dante: I'm beginning to think I've got rotten luck with women. *Wipes blood stain on the wall* +end cutscene+ Before moving on. Go back and get the red and green orbs from their exact spots they were in from Mission 5 and 6 and return to the start. There is also a secret Mission 3 in the pocket where you must stay airborne for at least 20 seconds. You do this by getting near a wall and keep wall jumping as the enemies touch your feet for added leverage. You get a blue orb fragment. -Heaven Rise Chamber- Drop all the way down first. Get any red orbs you can on the way down and enter the red door to enter the Divine Library. -Divine Library- Move forward and a blue barrier appears. Smash the normal statues for orbs and do the same for the gang of Damned Pawns you face too. Attack them from the reatr to safely defeat them. Under one of them is a Orihalcon Fragment. This will get rid of the blue barrier and allow you to exit. -Heaven Rise Chamber- Use the Air Hikes to get the red orbs and return to the start. Now keep going up and get more red orbs and keep an eye for a Holy Water because the top level is one level above. Enter the green door. -Pitch Black Void- On the balcony, jump on the broken column for 1500 Red orbs then at the stairs are more red orbs above and a blue orb fragment. Use the trickster style to get the latter if you are having trouble. Then enter the door. -Skull Spire- Smash everything for Red orbs. Destroy the Damened Pawns. There is a Vital Star S behind the fence so jump over and get it. Enter the door and face a new enemy called the 5th Hell Greed. These guys are apain. Be sure to take them out first as they send out ghouls that form into 1st Hell Prides. Victory gets you the Siren's Shriek. -Lift Room- You'll need Rebellion to destroy the statue with the stylish combo and get a blue orb fragment. On the device above, insert the Orihalcon fragment. This allows you to take a shortcut back to the Chamber of Echoes. Use the Siren's Shriek on the flamed door to move on. Kill the 7th Hell Lusts and a 3rd Hell Wrath then run back and get the red orbs out the objects and a yellow orb at the end. Then run all the way upstairs. -Cursed Skull Chamber- Break the wall. Strike the Demon Crest till a swinging ball appears. Break the ball for a crystal skull. Kill the 5th Hell Greeds and the 7th Hell Lusts to exit. Return to the Chamber of Echoes then take the elevator back to the Tranquil Room but visit the God of Time if needed. -Tranquil Room- Defeat the hell Vanguard like you did in Mission 2 as well as 5th Hell Greeds and the 1st Hell Lusts they produce, Go back to Skull Spire and use the Crystal Skull at the door. Hack and slash the crystal for Red orbs. -Moonlight Mile- Run up the hill till you get a cutscene. ------ Boss Fight: Vergil Round 1 Get in Vergil's face and provoke him into attacking then jump over or side roll quickly and make him miss then pound on him as much as you can before he blocks ypur attack and tries to retaliate. You do this the whole fight. Later on in the fight he'll send projection attacks which you can avoid by moving or staying close to him. If you hopefully have Trickster style level 2 then dodging him is easier especially with the Air Dash. ------ +cutscene+ The two continue to fight. They clang swords then Dante pulls out Ebny and fires but Vergil reflects the bullets and lines them up on the floor and throws them back. Dante slices the bullets in half. Vergil: Why do you refuse to gain power? The power of our father Sparda? Dante: Father? I don't have a father. I just don't like you, that's all. The two repeat the fight scene of the intro. After Vergil impales Dante... Vergil: Foolishness, Dante, foolishness. Might controls everything. And without strength, you can't protect anything *pulls out sword a little* Let alone yourself. *Snatches amulet as Dante falls then pulls back hair and walks away with Dante's sword.* Vergil impales Dante again this time with Rebellion in the belly. Arkham: Do you finally have it? Vergil: Yes! Now the spell Sparda cast will be broken! Arkhan look s down upon Dante and walks away as Dante lays in a pool of blood. The sword eyes glow red as Dante gets up and go after Vergil and catches the sword with his hand bleeding over it. Vergil: I see, a devil inside you has awakened as well. Dante throws Vergil away but he lands on his feet and gets ready to strike. Arkham: Wait! We should leave. For the moment we have all that we need. Dante glows and walks slowly. Vergil and Arkham walk away as Dante Devil Triggers for the first time and collapses in a pool of blood. +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 8 - A renewed fear. Burst from the great demon's womb.) +cutscene+ Dante wakes up, walks towards the edge, hits a pillar and jumps down shooting Blood Goyles as he falls and slashes them. He leaps off the side of the cliff and tries to fly and ends up being swallowed by Leviathan +end cutscene+ -Leviathan's Stomach- There are five membranes to attack. The first two are visible on the ledge above from the start. Each membrane causes a tusk to retract from the exit. Avoid the stomach acid and get the membrane behind the school buss and return to the start and take the path below and it will lead to an acid waterfall and another membrane. Wall Jump through the holes with no waterfalls and cross the bridge and get red orbs out the crystal and the last membrane is on the opposite side. Climb down. Go into the opening behind the school bus. -Leviathan's Intestine- Just keep moving till a Gigapede chases you. Don't bother fighting it yet. Let it chase you till it gets caught up in a column it can't go through. Now you can kill the Gigapede in a cruel manner. Run up to it and slash it then run back to avoid its chompers and repeat the pattern. You get red prbs for killing it. -Leviathan's Retina- There is a device in the center of the room. Kill as many 2nd Hell: Envy as you can till an Ignis Fatuus forms. The place darkness but the Ignis Fatuus light everything up around you. Exit back to the Heart Core Chamber. On the way is a statue that can only be broken with a stylish Cerberus combo. Also on the way back, the Gigapede returns. Secret Mission 4 is hard. You have to ride to the top but the 1st Hell Prides have black smoke. You're almost to the chamber, 2nd Hell: Envies have inhabited the place where you started. Kill them all and enter the cavity. Its dark but watch out for the acid pools. There is a God of Time just before the exit. -Heart Core Chamber- Insert the Ignis Fatuus in the tablet to remove the protective barriers. ------ Boss Fight: Heart of Leviathan There are three life bars. The long one is for the heart and the short ones are for the organs on the sides. Take one of the organs life energy to zero and the heart reveals the green core. This is where the heart take damage and you win when the heart dies. Sounds easy, no? Well it's not. 2nd Hell Envy interfere. So be sure to attack one organ, and when they get close, move to the other organ. Do not kill the 2nd Hell Envies because the red orbs get absorbed by the organs and provoke an attack. Left one causes a laser to appear, the right one will send homing balls both from the green core. ------ +Cutscene+ Arkham: People once cried out in fear of this tower. Temen-ni-gru, a foundation that brought fear. Fear. yes, fear. *closes book* can't you feel it? The rage and agonies of people. Those who are confined here with their desires of evil being fulfilled. It was all because Sparda slammed the door to the Demon World in their faces.. Vergil: What's wrong? Arkham: Nothing. +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 9 - Faded memories. Christen the sorceress of the abyss with a blade.) +cutscene+ Leviathan falls dead to the ground and Dante busts out his eye with Lady holding him at gunpoint. Dante: so this is the next stage? Lady: Wait! Dante: If you're asking for a date. Forget it. Cause I make it a point not to go out with women who shoot me in the head, Lady: Date a demon? I'm not that desperate. Besides I really don't care for guys who stink like blood. Dante: *sniffs self* You're right *pulls out Ivory* The two start shooting at various demons. Dante: So tell me! What's your name? Lady: I don't have a name. Dante: OL, then what should I call you? Lady: I don't care. Whatever you want. Dante: Whatever Lady *retreats to the stairs* I'll leave this to you. Cuz I don't want to miss the party. Lady: Who counted on you anyway? +end cutscene+ Examine the device near the door. It says you'll need a special power to operate it so move on and move across the bridge and onto the next door. -Provisions Storeroom- There are four Arachnes to fight here. Shoot them to death with Artemis + Gunslinger Style because slicing them to death will risk you realeasing small Arachnes that does damage i they jump on you. There is a green orb to collect here too. The red barrier disappears when the Arachnes are all dead. -Subterranean Garden- The inscription on the stone says: Radiate the image sunken in the depths below to open a new path.

Jump down run under the waterfall -Limestone Cavern- Go left and ignore the enemies and drop down the small pocket for a Devil Star. Fighting is not such a good idea, go back to the start and into the hole ahead and go to Secret Mission 5 and smash everything within the time limit. This is a good place to fill up on red orbs. Once done, ignore the enemies and run straight for the Sunken Opera House. -Sunken Opera House- +cutscene+ Dante walks forward and a swarm of bats appear and form into a lady vampire. Her name is Nevan. Nevan: Hmm, Welcome sir. Is this your first time here. Dante: yeah it is. you'll be nice to me won't you? Nevan: of course I will. I'll treat you so nicely, you'll never want to leave. Dante: Now that's what I'm talking about. *pulls out Rebellion* Nevan Walks off and blows and electric kiss. Nevan: Then come on Sugar. ------ Boss Fight: Nevan To do damage to her, you have to slice the bats away from her then pummel her in Devil Trigger Mode till she forms a black pudle and reappears elsewhere with new bats. She shouts out verbal phrases that indicate what attack she will do. \"Get ready, sugar.\" - Ballerina Spin \"Don't you like it?\" - direct lightning bolt \"Now you will become tired.\" - a beam from below you \"How's this?\" - A swarm of electric balls home in on your last location each. \"Are you afraid of sex?\" - Rows of lightning. \"This is not over\" - absorb life energy Backflip with no words - Black shadow wave Lightning ball - floor is electrified When she is low on life, she'll rush at you defenselessly and tried to suck your life and add it to hers. Devil Triggering prevents that. To avoid the floor electicity, Air hike or Wall Jump to avoid damage. Hang in there and victory is yours. ------ As Nevan falls, Dante catches her and hold her in a romantic way. Nevan: My you're sweet. *gets ready to bite Dante but gets an Ivory bullet in the belly. Dante: You'd think so, wouldn't you? Nevan: All right. I'll help you. Your father was a handsome demon devil but you're no sluch yourself. *turns into a guitar* Dante decides to throw a self concert like a rock star. +end cutscene+ Exit out the Opera House. +cutscene+ Lady fights off various enemies and tosses a gun up and puts a clip in her mouth and starts blasting with other guns.

The world where Sparda's power has been sealed. And the one who will lift the incantation is you, his own son. It must be fate. *door opens* Vergil: Does that woman really bother you? Arkham: What are you talking about? Vergil: Why didn't you kill her? Perhaps because she is your daughter? Did some pesky fatherly love get in your way? Arkham: That is none of you're Vergil stabs Arkham and blood drips onto the book. Vergil: to further your study of the block arts, you sacrificed your loving wife. To become a devil as well. Knowing this I thought you'd be more useful to me, but I was wrong. *impales Arkham more* No wonder your attachment of power is incomplete. Arkham: What about you? You're an incomplete being as well. Both demon and human blood mingle in your veins. Vergil: Shut up *removes sword and sheats it as Arkham drops dead on the floor.* Now that the final door is open, I have no use for you. +end cutscene+ -Limestone Cavern- Get the stone mask and go out the other door through the Opera House and make your way back out. You can use Secret Mission 5 to fill up on red orbs. Once outside, use Nevan to break the statue for a blue orb fragment. All the red orbs are back in their spots. Place the stone mask on the statue with a bright light to raise a bridge that leads to a Neo Generator. Secret Mission 6 is on the side of it. You must collect all red orbs in 30 seconds. -Round Pathway- As you make your way back to the start of Mission 9, you'll be caged here and have to fight three Dullahans. Hit them from the rear to defeat them and proceed. Kill the Enigmas as before as well as the Archanes including two big ones. At the door, Dante plays soccer with the neo Generator and kicks it into a mouth to rotate the bridge. Go out and get the red orbs from near Leviathan's eye and go back in and cross the bridge. -Mobile Throughway- You come across Arkham's dead body. +cutscene+ Dante: Well that was quick Lady: That man...did you kill him> Dante: So what if i did? The two have a gun face off. Dante: Ooh, I love a fast woman. Lady: Shut up. He was obssessed with becoming the Devil. So much he killed his own wife. For that he butchered innocent people too. He's the most vile kind of creature. To top it off, that filthy scum is my father. Dante: Well, we have something in common. I have a dysfunctional family too. Lady: And what do you know about family?! You're a demon! This is my father... my family! This was all supposed to end by my hand! *puts gun down* Dante: Aren't you gonna shoot> Well that's a switch. Lady: Just go. I don't care anymore. Dante: Family huh? +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 11 - Revenge. Give a guest from the past an adequate homecoming.) +cutscene+ Lady looks down at her father, Arkham. Arkham moves and coughs. Arkham: Where am I? It's dark. I can't see anything. Lady: You're still alive, I see. Arkham: Mary? Is that you? What's happening? Where's your mother? Lady/We'll call her Mary now: My mother? You killed her remember? Arkham: Yes. That's right. I killed her, with my own hands. What horrible thing have I done? I was too weak. I succumed to his influence. Mary: You mean, you were possessed?! Arkham struggles to breath Mary: Father? Arkham: Yes, I was manipulated. Manipulated by a devil, named Vergil. Mary: Vergil Arkham: He is attempting to bring the demon world back to this modern day. A world that Sparda sealed off. Mary: Sparda? I thought he was a myth. Arkham: If the demons return, this world will be thrown into chaos. Stop him. Stop Vergil. Mary: Me? *cries* Arkham: You are such a sweet child, just like your mother *dies* Mary: Father! FATHER! *sobs and lays book on Arkham's chest* Vergil! +end cutscene+ -Gears of Madness- We highly suggest that you equip a weapon with the Air Hike technique because you'll need it for some spots. Start off by killing the two Enigmas. On the way to the door is a Devil Star on a ledge. -Altar of Evil Pathway- Here is a spot where the Air Hike is useful. Use it at the entrance to land on some pipes and there is a Blue Orb Fragment in the pocket. You'll face a new enemy called Soul Eaters and they are pains in the asses. The best way to kill them is to touch the smoke or wait for them to get ready for a ttack and pump a spiral shot into them -Altar of Evil- There is a statue with a sword in it. Use that sword for leverage to get to the balcony. Use Devil Arms to push the cube into the slot with a red jewel above it. Break a wall on the balcony to reveal another cube and get behind it and push it into another open slot. You'll have to take out the Soul Eaters and an irritating Hell Vanguard to exit this room. Deal with the Hell Vanguard first then kill the Soul Eaters. -Temperance Wagon- At the entrance, jump down the stairs and use a showtime combo with Agni n Rudra on the statue. Knock aside the statue and drop down for a green orb and a Holy Water. Get back up and push the statue further and stand on it for hidden red orbs. Get on the train and get ready to ride. Kill everyone on board to reach the end of the ride. -Torture Chamber- Move towards the shining object +cutscene+ Bewoulf: Sparda Dante: Awww, you poor thing. Didn't your mother teach you how to use a door. Bewoulf: That odor. I know it. Dante: *sniffs self* Gimme a break. Tell you what, next time I'll try to wear some cologne, okay? Bewoulf: It's that stench of betrayal. The odor of that accursed Sparda! I will annhilate every last blood relation of Sparda! *charges Dante* Dante: *dodges* A son cleaning up his dad's mess, huh? Where've I heard this story before? *points Ebony n Ivory* ------ Boss Fight: Bewoulf Use Swordmaster Style and your Agni n Rudra Devil Arms and jump up to Bewoulf's good eye and start slashing at it. As Bewoulf writhes in pain, maneuver to his side or rear and start slashing Bewoulf. As Bewoulf loses energy, he'll start charging at Dante, and at one point he'll throw a tantrum and cause debris to fall and launch them at you. The debris leave red orbs when they break which is hopefully not on you, Devil Triggering saves you some damage by healing you. Holy Water do good damage to Bewoulf too. As long as you avoid his punches then you'll be fine. He'll be more relentless when he is almost down so have some Vital Stars ready. He will fall eventually. ------ +cutscene+ Bewoulf pounds Dante into the ground at the same time as Dante's Rebellion slices out Bewoulf's other eye. Bewoulf: The odious one whose heart pumps the blood of Sparda? Though my sight is gone, I remember your scent! I shall hunt you down for eternity if I must. Until I rid this earth of your foul smell *retreats* Dante: Why do I have to do the heat for my father?! COme on man, cut me some slack. +end cutscene+ Get the red orbs and walk towards the object. +Cutscene+ Arkhamn's dead body is gone. +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 12 - Hunter and hunted. Reclaim the bridge before the soul is lost forever.) +cutscene+ Dante picks up the Haywire Neo-Generator and feels strange then Jester appears. Jester: This is amazing! Even devil boy is no match for it! *Dante grabs Jester and holds him at gunpoint with Ebony* You're not gonna shoot me, are you? If you do, I'll die, you know. Dante: If that's what it will take to shut you up. It bugs the crap out of me when someone talks more than I do. Jester: Don't act so rashly, my boy. I got a doozy of a story for you, but if you snuff out my voice like that, I won't be able to tell it now, will I? *gets thrown aside* I thought I was a goner for sure. Oops! You saw it too, didn't you? The huge tower jutting out of the ground? That thick shaft that causes women to shudder is actually a tunnel -- linking the demonic domain to the human world. And of course, your brother, Vergil is the one who controls it by using your mommy's amulet. Dante: Amulet? Jester: He's headed to the control room in the basement. If you don't hop down there quick like a bunny, he'll open the gate to hell. Isn't that a scary thought? Dante: And you are telling me this because? Jester: Oops! I forgot to mention one teeny wittle item. That gizmo there is actually the KEY to move forward. But the tricky thing is, it sucks the souls of those who hold it. So I think you'd better hurry! But, in return for your soul, it'll give you power! Marvelous, isn't it? Just let your spirit drive you and go for it. Dante: Wish you would have told me that in the first place. You big mouth moron! *enters Devil Trigger mode* +end cutscene+ Good news: You have infinite Devil Trigger mode. But the bad news is that your life will drain slowly, so have your Vital Stars handy. If you play your cards right, you won't need that many or any at all. We got through this part using only one star. Run to the train system and kill everyone quickly. Some enemies are nice enough to give you green orbs which is why we didn't use that many stars in the first place. Get the green orbs that was in the lower level where the train station ends and hop back up and return to the Alter of Evil and defeat the 6th Hell Gluttonies and the 7th Hell Lusts to exit then in the next rooms, ignore the Bloodgoyles then in the Marble Throughway, you must destroy 1st Hell Prides, 7th Hell Lusts, and a Hell Vanguard. (FUCK! So much for using no vital stars but if you are quick enough you might just do it afterall.) Head back to the rotating bridge and the bridge will shift again. Cross the bridge. -Spiral Corridor- There is a large vital star near the entrance and a God of Time. Run down the spiral of stairs. Enter the door to the underground Arena. +cutscene+ 1st Hell Prides arrive but Geryoun rides in and knocks them over the bridge. Dante: Talk about Horse Power. A chicken race with a horse, huh? Fair enough. +end cutscene+ ------ Boss Fight: Geryon Pump his ass full of led and use Air Hikes to avoid his charges or you'll be sorry. After a while, the bridge will fall. But before it does, Geryon will momentarily stop and give you a chance to pummel it with whatever Devil Arms are at hand. Use Devil Trigger mode for more damage. +cutscene+ The bridge falls and both Dante and Geryon fall into the arena. Dante: First chicken now gladiator. This just keeps getting better and better. Too bad no one is here to enjoy the show. +end cutscene+ Continue to pump led into Geryon and keep stepping away in a circle to avoid the missiles. Geryon will try to swerve into you. Air hike or side roll to avoid it then get on the carriage and pound on it with your Devil Arms as you go for a ride before Geryon disappears or you fall off. Later in the fight, Geryon will send blue flames and red balls at you. The red balls momentarily freeze you (actually slow you down). Keep Geryon at bay and continue to jump on it when it stops and pummel it till victory is yours. ------ +cutscene+ Geryon tires out and turns into a blue orb and enters Dante's chest. Rocks fall and Dante enters quicksilver mode and stops them. +end cutscene+ Get the orbs and enter the new door. +cutscene+ Vergil looks at the hole in the center and Bewoulf confronts him. Bewoulf: I found you, seed of Sparda! I told you that I remember your rancid scent! No matter where you run to, you can never hide from me! +Vergil slashes and jumps on Bewoulf's back* Y-You are not the one I faced before... But this smell... There are two of them! That excrement Sparda had two sons! Vergil sheaths his sword and Bewoulf's head falls to pieces. Vergil receives the Bewoulf Devil Arms and practices with it. +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 13 - Chaps' Warm welcome. Battle of blood between brothers) +cutscene+ Vergil holds the Amulets and they form into one and fall into the circle. He then cuts his hand and fills the circle with his blood. +end cutscene+ -Effervescene Corridor- You start of fighting Damned Pawns and Damned Bishops. The bishops attack with red fireballs -Spiral Staircase- Stand in the doorway at the end an Air Hike for 1700 red orbs. Examine the red light for a Secret Mission 8. Here you must kill everyone. At the bottom of the stairwell, ignore the door and go left to that door -Luximous Corridor- Go down towards the screen and wall jump tp get the Devil Star. Kill more Damned Pawns and a Damned Bishops. But they are actually optional fights. No more enemies to fight for the rest of the level save the boss. Enter the first door you see available. -Vestibule- Break the second light from the top on the second row then break the light on top of the third row and follow the light path. Smash the light inside to direct it to the hole and get the Orihalcon. Go back and there is a pocket with a Bullhorn statue. Examine it to go to Secret Mission 9 where you let no one escape. Back in the Luxinous Corridor. Ignore the chessmen and go down the path and enter the Obsidian Path. -Obsidian Path- Use the God of Time if needed. You'll need a Stylish Nevan combo on the statue. We recommend switching to Swordmaster style here too. Insert the Orihalcon and get ready to face Vergil for the second time. +cutscene+ Vergil: Why isn't this working? Is there something missing? Must more blood be shed? Dante: You seem to be in bad mood. Vergil: Dante... Dante: So... my mother's amulet is the key that unlocks the door to the demon world. Good plan, pop. Vergil: Just the opposite actually. Originally it was the key to the demon world but was given to human as a gift. Dante: It doesn't matter to me one way or the other. More importantly, I've come all this way. I'm sure you have time for one more game... right? Vergil: Why not? Afterall we share the same blood... I'll just use more of yours to undo daddy's little spell. Dante: So, you want a piece of me literally. Okay bro, come and get it. If you can. +end cutscene+ ------ Boss Fight: Vergil Round 2 This fight would be easier than Round 1 now that you have Devil Trigger. Take off as much life as you can while avoiding the diagonal swipes from his Bewoulf attacks as well as his wild punches. He'll utter a few words and he'll learn how to Devil Trigger himself. So much for an easy fight. SHIT! Stay as far away from him as you can as he regains strength and wait for his Devil Trigger to wear off. Have some stars ready for this rough fight. Another thing to watch out for is his double projection attack and his dash slash attack. Holy Water takes a chunk of his energy big time. ------ +cutscene+ The two keep fighting as Mary comes in armed. Dante: Sorry but this is no place for a little girl. So beat it. Mary: Shut up! *runs in and interruots the fight only to be knocked aside and the three have a three way faceoff.* You forced him into this! Vergil: Is that what you think? Foolish girl. Dante and Vergil cut each other and both and kneel in pain Jester: Bravo! Bravo! I never dreamed that things would go so smoothly. Well done everyone, well done! Dante: You! Jester: Don't be a bad girl, Mary. *throws Mary away* Or you can expect a spanking from daddy later. Jester's gonna spank your butt. Spank you on the butt. Vergil: Insane buffoon! I don't know where you came from but you don't belong here. Now leave! Jester: Zowie, that was close. But you've taken quite a trouncing today, haven't you Vergil? You could have chopped me into confetti by now if you're in your tip-top condition. Vergil: Damn you! Jester: You have lost... Arkham: Because you've underestimated humans. Mary: What's going on? Arkham: Good girl. Pure and Innocent... just like your mother. Mary: You bastard! Jester: It's time for your spanking, my dear! You want to know why the spell didn't break, hmm Vergil? You have two amulets, and Sparda's blood. You've got everything you needed to unleash the evil... Dante: I told you before I don't like anybody with a bigger mouth than mine. Jester: You are wounded and weak, even I can do... THIS to you! Arkham: Two amulets... a set of Sparda's blood. Now I need one more key. He sacrificed two things to suppress the tremendous force of this tower: His own Devil's blood, and a mortal priestess. I needed you, in whose body flows the same blood as the sacrificed woman. His spell cannot be undone without your blood! Jester: It is quite a ride, you know. If any of you had died, my little plan would have gone to waste! So my job is to let you battle each other and weaken you, but at the same time I need to guide you here to make sure you are kept alive. I've gone so far as dressing like a complete idiot! It's time for bed, Mary. You can go to visit your dear mother... Mary: Try me! Vergil: It is time for the clown to bow out, Arkham. Dante: Dude, the show's over! Arkham: Impressive. I expected nothing less fomr the devil's descendents. But aren't you forgetting something, Vergil? The spell is broken. What do you think will happen next? Let's welcome chaos. Just sit and wait... Wait for the birth of a new god! I shall take over the power of Sparda! +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 14 - Drive. Charge upward to the sky.) +cutscene+ Castle top rises and statues appear on top of the tower. Meanwhile... Dante: Are you gonna go? Mary: Yes. I'm going to finish him off. Dante: Well you might as well forget it. 'Cause you're no match for him. Mary: Regardless I must go. I had a chance to stop him before but I couldn't. I'm responsible for all this mess. Dante: Responsible? Does it bother you that much? Mary: He's my father. Besides, who else can undo what he's done? **grapples up a pillar.** A demon like you, wouldn't understand. **goes up** Dante: Father and family huh? Well I'll go too. But you better worry if you don't want me to take all the credit. Note: You'll notice the number 14. +end cutscene+ -Lair of Judgement Ruins- Go to the edge of where the pit is and get the Bewoulf Devil Arms then go to the God of Time and equip it then go around and continue further to the east corner for 1500 red orbs then head back to where you started and go down the east path and do a crazy Bewoulf combo which you hit for red orbs till it breaks then the elevator up. -Subterran lake- Run straight ahead to the entrance -Top Obsidian Path- Run to the end of the wall and at the end, wall jump in the corner for 1300 hidden red orbs. Then enter the door on the side. -Altar of Evil- Defeat the Bloodgoys here. -Temperance Wagon- Get the green orb if needed then ride the moving train and defeat all enemies. Once they are all gone, the ride ends, Then go upstairs and enter the door. Switch to trickster style. -Hell's Highway- This maze like area should be called Chessman's Alley LOL! Move in the blue room then go the green room. Defeat all the Damned Pawns to lift a gate then reenter the blue room and go to the pink room and defeat the Damned Knights. Enter the red room and defeat the Damned Knights and a Damned Bishop.Now there is a matter to kill the Damned Knights and Damned Bishops on route to a Blue Orb Fragment and proceed further. -Subterran Garden- Stand on the Statue for 500 red orbs then go over to where the God of Time is and to left of the wall, wall jump the wall next to it then wall Hike into the area to get a green orb. This is why we stated to use Trickster styke earlier. Now get out and go through the door across. -Subground Water Vein- Kill the Enigmas then you have an option of going to the Obsidian Path and fighting for a Vital Star S. Otherwise, double back and enter the blue portal. -Love Planet- You are back in Love planet. Enter the bar and smash everything for orbs then go back in Love Planet and go out the other exit and get the Holy Water and hop up the broken debris and you get a cutscene of Danter riding a motorcycle up the mountain and thus end of mission. ******************************************************************************* (Mission 15 - The Gate Crusher. Control the tower, control your destiny.) +cutscene+ Mary climbs a cliff as Dante is walking +end cutscene+ -Provisions Store Room- Destroy the Arachne and get the green orb in this room. Then again you can chicken out to save energy. -Devil Sprout Lift- Go up the stairs and examine the switch. You need three Orichalcon pieces. Go down the stairs -Forbidden Land: Front- There is a red orb generator crystal above, wall jump to reach it, Strike the Demon Crest to light all flames then run back to the Provisions Storeroom. The Arachne are all gone. Light up the Demon Crest here -Gears of Madness- Defeat the Bloodgoyles and watch the edges of the gears. They are sharp. Head to the Altar pf Evil Pathway -Altar of Evil Pathway- Carefully move through the blades avoiding the Soul Eaters for now then get the Orihalcon Fragment then head back and kill the Soul Eaters if you want and carefully move past the blades back to Gears of Madness -Gears of Madness- Light up the Demon crest and exit the door. -Rounded Pathway and Provisions Storeroom- Jump through the spinning columns and ignore the Dullahans. Enter the door and defeat Arachne and Giant Arachne then get another Orihalcon Fragment. But then again, you can get the piece and chicken out and return to the Rounded Pathway area. Light up the Demon Crest and enter the Top Subterra Lack. -Top Subterran Lack- Get the red orbs and enter the door and maneuver through columns and Soul Eaters for the last Orihalcon Fragment. It helps to use the Killer Bee (from Bewoulf) to get over the column as you enter and exit the door. All you need to do now is put in the pieces and end the mission. But there are Arachnes and Giant Arachnes to kill on the way and this time you can't chicken out. +cutscene+ Arkham: He plucks the threads that make us dance, finger and toe. We surrender, enjoy to the lowest of the foul and rank. We submerge through darkness, rancid filth, hour by hour we move downward, ever closer to hell. In a slow, steady, gait. Now, let the world resonate. Sloth, Gluttony, Greed, Envy, Lust, Wrath, and Pride. A bell of chaos that tolls human desires. After two thousand long years, the one sealed gate to the demonic world will open. Destruction! Carnage of Despair! Let your instincts drive you. Entrap this world in fear! As its very name Temen-ni-gru strikes terror into the hearts of mankind. And I, will become the order to rule this wasteland, engulf with pandemonium. The demonic power that Sparda once imprisoned... will be mine! +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 16 - Win or Lose.

Hit one ball twice then get to the other ball and knock it to the center. Now you can get the Onyx Moonshard. FUCK! The red seal appeared, they are a couple Fallen (DOUBLE FUCK!). Return to the beginning and insert the Onyx Moonshard in its spot then go through the right door and then go to the Living Statue Room. Kill the Bloodgoyles and Enigmas to unseal the doors. -Walking Sun Chamber- Strike the Demon Crest till a ball falls. Stand on it and beat the shit out of it till it breaks and unravels a wall. Get the Golden Sun and fend off a couple Damned Rooks and some Damned Knights. Take out the Rooks first. Now just head back to the Sun and Moon Chamber. Insert the Golden Sun to seperate the walls and enter the door. -Ice Guardian's Chamber- Just play chicken and head for the exit above the fallen rocks. -Surge of Fortunas- Same story here, just play chicken and go through the exit. -Endless Interum- Get the 100 Red orbs and proceed to... -Giant Walking Chamber- Play chicken once more and you're home free till you reach Mary. -Incandescent Space- Get the Vital Star S, use the God of time and proceed. -Divine Library- +cutscene+ Dante: What's wrong you tired? Then stand back I'll take care of this. Mary: No, YOU stand back. Mary shoot Dante in the abdomen which does nothing. Dante: I've told you, you can't do it! Don't you get it? This is not a human's job. Mary: You are the one who doesn't get it. It's not something you can reason with. It has nothing to do with me being a human and you being a demon. I'm driven by the inability to forgive him! My soul is screaming demanding me to kill him. That's enough motivation to keep me going. Besides, this is my family matter. You should stay out of it. Dante: Okay, Lady. I get the picture now, but I can't just sit back and watch either. I'm pretty pissed at him too you know. Now get out of my way, or there will be some consequences. Mary: Fair enough. I wasn't planning to let any demon live anyway. Not even one. *shoots rocket which Dante avoids* +end cutscene+ ------ Boss Fight: Lady/Mary Mary is a fast runner. You can easily take off a chunk of her life if you can catch up to her and start using your Devil Arms. Damage her enough and she'll grapple out of the way and drop a grenade. When she says \"OK\", she'll fire a rocket so stand clear. She'll say \"Get ready\" before she shoots a rocket also. Later on in the fight, she'll grapple to the top of a column more and drop more grenades. THen when she is on her last legs. She'll yell \"DIE\" and fire a swarm of rockets at you. Keep up the fight to win. ------ +cutscene+ Mary keeps firing at Dante and missing badly till she runs out of bullets. Dante gets up close to her. Dante: I'll take care of him. Lady: Why do you care so much? Dante: This whole business started with my father sealing the entrance between the two worlds. And now, my brother is trying to break that spell and turn everything into demonville. This is my family matter. Quite frankly, at first, I didn't give a damn. But because of you, I know what's important now. I know what I need to do. Lady: Wait! Dante: Trust me! I'll make things right for you. That's what my soul is telling me to do. Lady: Use this. *offers Kalina Ann to Dante* Dante: How much is it going to cost me? Lady: You can give me your name. Dante: ...Dante. *takes Kalina Ann* Lady: Dante. Please, free my father.

There is a Blue Orb Fragment in the Elevator area. Head back to the God Cube Chamber. -God Cube Chamber- Go up another set of cubes and enter the door. Go through where the Trial of Wisdom used to be and defeat the Arachnes and go to the Trial of Skill and make it past the spears. They come at you from two sides and leave only one space of safety. Exit through the hole in the wall and use the ground hike to enter. -Pitch Black Void- Get the red orbs and enter the door. -Skull Spire- Defeat the Abyss enemies in this room. From here, you return to where you fought Vergil the first time but face Doppleganger instead. +cutscene+ Dante: I know why you're here. You're here to ask me some questions. But too bad, I've already answered them myself. I don't need you anymore. Come on, poser. +end cutscene+ ------ Boss Fight: Doppleganger There is a pattern to beating him. Lure the Doppleganger near one of the lights while beating on it with the Bewoulf then make it light up in his face and blind him. It takes five Bewoulf hits to light up a light. To be safe, hit a light twice and dodge the Doppleganger's dash attack then hit it twice more then when the Dopple ganger gets close, hit it once more to light it up and pound on him. Next move to a different light and repeat the pattern till victory is yours. ------ +cutscen+ Dante: ...thought I lost my shadow for a second. +end cutscne+ Get the red orbs and enter the portal and head up the stairs. ******************************************************************************* (Mission 18 - Invading Hell.

Then enter the mirror. -Damned Chessboard- The whole Damned Chess Family is here. The pieces are dark when immobile and invincible. They'll turn white when ready for attack. When the Damned King comes alive, go after him often and destroy him. Succeding in doing so will destroy the others immediately. That's we call \"CHECKMATE\". -Road to Despair- The Fallen are annoying. Just play chicken here and let the bridge form and enter the mirror. You can also stay and strike the crystal for red orbs too. -Lost Souls Nirvana- OK, this liiks awfully familiar. We all know that Devil May Cry series is made by Capcom, right? It seems they are taking another element from one of their other series which involves their franchise character, Megaman. That's right folks. You'll be fighting your old bosses again except Mary but if you look on a color slab, all you have to do is light up the colors that form a circle. Red - Heart of Leviathan Orange - Double the enemies of Mission 2 Yellow- Gigapede Green - Agni n Rudra Cyan - Cerberus Blue - Geryone Purple - Nevan White - Bewoulf Black - Doppleganger.

Use the God of Time if needed and enter the door. +cutscne+ Dante enters and blocks Arkham's Sparda sword strike Arkham: Welcome. What do you think after looking at your father's image? Dante: It's like staring at a backed up toilet. Why do you always stick your nose into other family's business? Come on dude, don't you have any hobbies? The two laugh. Arkham: You can still talk big after seeing THIS? I feel it... the power... I feel the devil's power overflowing in my body, the power of SPARDA! *transforms* Dante: Dude, my father wasn't so hideous. Can't you tell by looking at me? Anyway that shape suits you better. Let's begin the main event! ------ Boss Fight: Arkham The strategy here is to pound on his upper body into submission with aerial combos with Agni n Rudra or Bewoulf's Swordmaster Air Special. Keep hitting the upper body till it retreats and sends its legions at you. Use Kalina Ann to dispose of the little buggers and commence the assault when Arkham returns. When his life is halfway gone... +cutscene+ Arkham: No use! Regardless of how strong you are, you are nothing but a half breed. You cannot defeat a pure demon, the real Sparda! *a hand comes out only to be sliced away by Vergil* Who's this? Damn you! Vergil: I've come to retrieve my power. You can't handle it. Dante: Look at you, making a big dramatic entrance and stealing my spotlight. Vergil: Well... You don't possible believe that he deserves to be our main event now do you? Dante: Now that you've mentioned it, you're right. Arkham: Do you feel you can defeat me? Defeat the power of your father? The great Sparda? Vergil: You should come to realize you cannot control the power of Sparda. Dante: You're wasting your time, buddy. I think he needs to learn the hard way. +end cutscene+ Now you cannot use Special attacks or Devil Trigger with Vergil around. You must use single attacks on the upper half and fight off legions till Arkham dies. If Dante is grabbed, you control Vergil and free him. ------ +cutscene+ The two continue to pummel Arkham. Arkham: It cannot be. It cannot. DIE! *swats away Ebony and Vergil catches it* Vergil: I will try it your way for once. Dante: Remember what we used to say? Arkham: DON'T DO IT! Vergi and Dante: JACKPOT! *shoots* Arkham: I have the power of Sparda...! Vergil: Not very classy for someone's dying words. *gives back Ebony to Dante* The two jump into the holw and grab their amulets +end cutscene+ ******************************************************************************* (Mission 20 - Screaming Souls.

Arkham: Wait! Please... do you really want to shoot me? Can you shoot me? Your own father? WHAT HAVE I DONE WRONG? Even heroic Sparda sacrifices the woman so that he could become a legend... I wish to be a GOD! And I sacrificed one miserable human being for that reason. That is all... was that really so awful? ...I have unfinished business to take care of. Help me Mary.

Dante: No way, you've got your own. Vergil: But I want yours, too. Dante: What are you going to do with all that power huh? No matter how hard you try, you're never gonna be like father. Vergil: You're wasting time! Dante: We are the sons of Sparda. Within each of us flows his blood. But more important, his soul! And now, my soul is saying it wants to stop you! Vergil: Unfortunately our souls are at odd, brother. I need more power. Dante: And we're supposed to be twins... Vergil: Twins... riiiight. +end cutscene+ ------ Last Boss Fight: Vergil Round This fight is just like the last two battles. However, Vergil can stay in Devil Trigger mode for a very long time and even regain all his energy back. There is a way to combat this. Before he Devil Triggers, take off as much life as you can while avoiding as many of his attacks as you can. When he Devil Trigger. Forget waiting for him to go back to normal. Keep beating on him, preferably in Devil Trigger yourself to avoid being knocked back and he'll return to normal prematurely. Then commence the assault while avoiding his. When he is very low, he'll say \"you're going down\" and will form a blue sphere around him. Devil Trigger and move away from his repeated Helm Breakers till he returns to normak and continue the barrage. If he Devil Triggers anytime afterwards, don't worry because he'll only do mutiple projection attacks then return to normal. Go for the kill and beat the game. ------ +cutscene+ Vergil: Am I... being defeated? Dante: What's wrong? Is that all you've got? Come on, get up! You can do better than that. Vergil: *rises* The portal to the human world is closing Dante, because the amulets have been separated. Dante: Let's finish this first. I have to stop you, even if that means killing you. The two charge once more and Dante wins the duel and Vergil falls. Vergil: No one can have this Dante. It's mine. It belongs to a son of Sparda. Leave me and go, if you don't want to trap in the demon world. I'm staying. This place, was our father's home. Dante tries to catch Vergil as he falls but gets cut in the hand. He picks up the Sword of Sparda and leaves. +end cutscene+ +cutscene+ Dante: You're still here. Mary: I need that back. Dante: No late charges I hope? Mary: Hmm... I'll think about it. Dante: We should be fine for now, but I'm sure he'll back soon. Very soon. Mary: Are you crying? Dante: It's only the rain. Mary: The rain already stopped. Dante: Devils never cry. Mary: I see. Maybe somewhere out there even devil may cry when he loses a love one. Don't you think? Dante: Maybe. Mary: By the way... Looks like, we're gonna be busy for awhile. Dante: So, bring it on! I love this... This is what I live for! And I'm absolutely crazy about it! +end cutscene+ As the credits roll, try to kill 100 enemies alongside Mary and you'll get a special ending. THe last enemy is a Hell Vanguard. +Final cutscene+ Lady: What happened next? Nothing, really. We took care of all the remaining devils and that was it. I still have a job to do that's far from done, which is to eliminate every last demon. I need to ensure that monsters like my father never come about again. Then he promised to help me hunt down the demons, even though he's part one himself. But now I realize, there are human as evil as any devil, as well as calm and compassion demons in this universe. At least I've found one so-called devil who's able to shed tears for those he cares about. That's enough for me to believe in him. Dante: Now I can start my business. Lady: Oh, speaking of a kind devil, he finally decided on a name for his shop. It took him quite awhile to pick one. Want to know the name? Both: Devil May Cry. +end cutscene+ +Special cutscne if you defeat 100 enemies in the credits+ Vergil: It would be fun to fight with the Prince of Darkness. If my father did it, I should be able to do it too! Author Note: By DMC1 terms, he must have lost. +end cutscene+ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Secrets ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hard Mode - Beat Normal Mode Easy Mode - Die twice in Normal Mode Dante Must Die Mode - Beat Hard Mode Doppleganger style - Defeat Doppleganger in Mission 17 Gallery - Complete Easy or Normal Mode Gallery update - Complete Hard Mode Heaven or Hell Mode - Complete Dante Must Die Quicksilver style - Defeat Greyon in Mission 12 Unlock Everything At the Start Menu, hold down L1, L2, R1, R2 and rotate the left analog stick until you hear Devil May Cry.
