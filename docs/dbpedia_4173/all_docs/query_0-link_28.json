We also have the final placement of Devil May Cry 2 in the timeline, which has been quite annoying to figure it out since many sources kept conflicting with each other.\n\nObviously, that means my old post of Devil May Cry: How Old Is Dante? needs to be updated. So with the new information Dante’s ages would be...\n\nDevil May Cry 3 Manga = 18 years old\n\nDevil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening = 19 years old\n\nDevil May Cry 1 = 28 years old\n\nDevil May Cry: The Animated Series = 28 - 30 years old\n\nDevil May Cry Vol. 2 Novel = 33 years old (these events happened in the same year, just several months before DMC2)\n\nDevil May Cry 2 = 33 years old\n\nDevil May Cry 4 = 38 years old\n\nDevil May Cry 5: Before the Nightmare = 43 years old\n\nDevil May Cry 5 = 44 years old\n\nIn DMC5, Patty Lowell is confirmed to be 18 years old (on the 3rd of May -- or that was just when she was having her birthday party) in the game. So that would mean she was 8 years old in the anime for that to be possible.\n\nThat would also mean that Nero was 14 years old during that time, making the anime occur 5 years before DMC4. This matches up with Hideki Itsuno (the director of DMC2, DMC3, and DMC4) said about Nero being 19 years old in DMC4 -- the same age that Dante was in DMC3. And it would be another 5 years after that game that DMC5 occurs, which would make Nero currently 25 years old. But in DMC5:BtN, Nero would’ve been 24 years old since this novel takes place the year before it.\n\nIn the prequel novel, Devil May Cry 5: Before the Nightmare, it is set before the events of DMC5. It confirmed that Dante returned to Vie de Marli one year before the start of DMC5, and Matier scolds him for not visiting her or Lucia for 10 years since DMC2. That would make Dante 43 years old at the time of DMC5:BtN. Also, Nico discusses Fortuna's destruction 5 years ago. She moves in with Nero and Kyrie afterwards, and then after a year, Nero's arm get stolen in DMC5."
