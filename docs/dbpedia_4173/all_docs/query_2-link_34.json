        "text": "Let’s rock baby!\n\nEasily one of the coolest additions to this list, “Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening” was anarchic, bloody, loud and violent. Exuding a stylistic combat system that benefitted from an absurd visual fluidity that made every blistering encounter with the malformed demons feel as though it was your last. From the very first confrontation, instigating one of the most justifiable acts of violence, after Dante’s pizza is crushed by the foot of a cloaked assailant, Dante eliminates several adversaries by slicing a pool table in half, shooting the cue ball into the suspended cluster of balls that has hurtling past him for multiple Fatalities, I knew this was something special. Having already played and completed the series previous two incarnation I knew what to expect from this Gothic themed aberration of the Resident Evil series. You can immediately distinguish the games emphasis on a more effectual approach to combat that was sadly absent from its predecessor, establishing confrontations that necessitated a formidable agility, fleet dexterity and a logistical objective. Though the game excelled at the traditional hack n slash, liquidate enemies into a fine sulphuric paste methodology the game was brutally relentless.\n\nIf Dmc3 were obliged to shack your partner’s hand it would steal them away, marry them, take both the house, your kids and the dog in the divorce settlement before you even introduced them. Enemies, though singularly were easy to resist relied on sheer numbers to overwhelm you, coordinating horde like advances that required crucial versatility of your progressively expansive artillery and proficiency in their utilisation. Almost every stage introduced a new foe or a variant to engage with, one that demanded an adaptation to an immediately redundant strategy. It was challenging and downright frustrating at times, yet satisfying in masochist kind of way. There was this energetic sophistication that made every recurrent button press seem urbane and graceful, even though I looked like an agitated shopper trying frantically to get my pin code to verify. The bosses too posed their own significant challenges, providing conflated dangers due to their embellished physicality and exceedingly hostile yet singular combat styles. Whether it was their inflated stature or malformed concepts, each boss looked and felt unique.\n\nThe gothic architecture and other garish aesthetics only compounded the real sense of encroaching peril, as the suppression of reality became more distorted and sense of isolation became an arresting anxiety, as Dante slowly navigated his way through this dilapidated tower that at times assumed a façade reminiscent of a cathedral. The ornate arches sweeping along corridors and elaborate doors played havoc with your sense of direction, becoming the games most persistent impediment. But as brooding and macabre the clustered environments appeared to be you could always rely on Dante to provide commentary and insight that, uttered by anyone else would sound derivative and cliché. Dmc3 for me portrayed the most realised interpretation of Dante, and really the first time he was given a personality. His pithy, petulance and egotistical proclivities somehow made him a more appealing character, exhibiting an abstract masculinity that was both irritating yet endearing. Not to mention a destructive sibling rivalry that could challenge even the Gallagher brothers enduring contempt.\n\nThe most compelling reason for elevated and coveted position on my top ten is an amalgamation of all these many formidable attributes, but it’s most perennial influence was its riff heavy, orchestral/metal soundtrack. The rousing orchestral tempo, fused with the aggressive fervour of metal punctuated every battle in this game to such an exhilarating degree. The soundtracks energizing compliment made every slice of your blade seem like the difference between life and death. I can still recite the individual themes for most the boss encounters including all 3 Dante VS Vergil iterations. In fact it’s a soundtrack I still listen too.\n\nThe series, at least for the time being is seemingly on a permanent hiatus, owing to the rather divisive nature of its passive re-imagining, which is sad and by no means a way to end my first entry into the top 10 most inspirational games. Instead here is one of my favourite scenes from Dmc3 that emphasises the absurd violence, humour and intoxicating awesomeness of this franchise. Cheers.\n\n#8. Tales Of Symphonia.\n\n#9. TMNT’S II.\n\nForged by the festering saccharine of days past, kindling the charring remains of credibility that has since yielded to the flaunting exposure of their own exulted arrogance. These are the exemplary confederates that cultivated enduring momentum, generating plaudits and accolades for their prodigious performances. Now they have become exultant caricatures of their former selves. Gathered into an innocuous auditorium, with each individuals reticent gaze fixed studiously on the varnished timbered flooring, averting any of the crowds admonishing and judicious glares. Its one thing to be ridiculed by satirised sketches, parodied or honoured in a homage that honours your influence in the industry; that’s simply a measure of ones cultural significance in the public domain. But to inspire a new generation of better quality interpretations can only provoke an agitated feeling of rejection and embarrassment at your now stuttering career. Cynics and fans alike waited patiently to hear each participants indiscretions, to observe their fallen idols finally acknowledge what many have lamented for years. Dante was first to address the assembled spectators with murmurings between parties trying to ascertain who the ageing, bleakly attired individual was with only vague recollections that verified his identity.\n\nFor those unaware, Dante had established himself not once, but twice! His inaugural outing as the eponymous demon hunter in the Devil May Cry and again in DMC3, after souring public opinion with his divisive starring role in the forgettable DMC2. Despite a meek resurgence in 2013’s DmC, he’s rejuvenated look and ebonized follicles stunted his distinctive charismatic personality which alienated many of the existing fan base, and failed to connect with a new generation. The games subsequent failure had detrimental repercussions for Dante as opportunities to expand his range as an actor evaporated like a fart in the wind, as his fortune deteriorated. He was solemnly forced to partake in copious reality shows, become the chief antagonist in an episode of Soap Opera East Enders, performing fleeting stunt work for Ted Danson on CSI, as well as he’s recent guest appearance on Agatha Christie’s Poirot, as passer-by number 3; all to maintain his lavished excesses and sate his addiction for accumulating those little plastic things in pizza boxes that stop the toppings from embedding into the cardboard. Back in 2010, Dante was also embroiled in an ongoing confrontation with God of Wars Kratos, accusing the aggressive Greek god that the comparative ubiquity of their respective roles were just a little too similar, which subsequently culminated in a hostile affray, concluding in the deaths of 2 Norse gods, the spilling of copious liqueurs, a cat getting scared and Dante commencing an illicit affair with Kratos new partner, Aphrodite’s. Tonight he was far more passive. Dante rose cautiously from his seat, placing his ornate pistols dutifully on the table beside him and approached the podium to dispense his forlorn rebuke. His overt, charismatic quips were seemingly scuttled by years of isolation as he faltered to find the appropriate words in the mangled parchment he carefully smoothed down. Discernibly parched, he drank the glass of water adorning the bespoke dais and finally vocalised his long-suffering reproach: “I want to first sincerely apologize for the continuing declination of this once great series on behalf of everyone involved. It was certainly not my intent to dilute the bravado of this character by introducing melancholic themes, Nero, an emo hair style and a mutated, sentient helicopter. Please accept our humble apologies, our condolences and please, blame Capcom.”\n\nThe Scripted assertion lacked the indelible presence associated with Dante, but the tepid applause he received was respectful, if not affirming acceptance of the rebuttal. A relatively benign acquittal from this seemingly ornery crowd, but perhaps the convening spectators would be far more amiable towards the next Capcom affiliated orator……\n\nBeing critical is such an immediate retort for me that it has become something of an anthology. I’m often crass in my expressive dialogue, quick to dispute singular conjecture if my own insolent view contradicts their own, with even the most theoretical of inquiries provoking aggressive stance of defiance and sarcastic retaliations, despite the placid intention of the inquest. Becoming a fan of a game places you in such a vulnerable position, merely because such a confined affinity is often greeted by convening mediation by refluent assailants, simply due to the subjective terms of applied endearment. Whereas a disparate congregation would consolidate existing enmity, in empathetic unity to admonish what they would consider, a poorly executed game. Now nutritionists are concerned about the escalating obesity and cholesterol of children, with their diminutive size afflicted by the extravagant level of glucose consumed by their stunted configuration. I however fear the measurable fallow of analytical deduction, the expansion of ignorance of our collective nations and the overall collaborative deficiency of gamers mental comprehension.\n\nIt’s fascinating how nimble us gamers are at revoking previously admirable resolve for a series. We regularly demonstrate conflicting views on what constitutes as good, that it’s often impossible to accurately gauge what is deemed appropriate for all concerned. Some request an elevation to the game-play, to be more immediate and intuitive, others conversely may require a more advanced progression in the narrative, or complete aberration of the established characters. Independently gamers are capable of soliciting insightful, constructive observations, expressed with succinct mediation or rationalised opinions. As an amalgamation however, its difficult to differentiate between the permissive expressions of some amid the convulsive splutter’s of venom, dismissive flippancy and infuriated aggressors that implore with vehemence that their favourite character has been tarnished because of his follicles, darkened tone.\n\nYou may recall a humorous incident a couple of years ago concerning an alteration to one enduring, demon slaying Nephilim more generally recognised as Dante. DmC’s preliminary footage negated any tangible assertions to the overarching narrative or progression–or perhaps declination–of this popular vagrant, whose remedial riposte to any situation was to unsheathe rebellion (sword) and condense everyone in the immediate vicinity into aqueous coagulation. But despite the sparsity of its allurements and an impressive demonstration of its combat system, the video caused salivating heresy, simply because of Dante’s auburn locks. Well perhaps that’s not the primary pretext, but certainly the punctuation for much of fan discourse, which certainly exemplifies the displaced prerogatives of what gamers value. One man’s continuity, is another’s repetition I guess. Gamers, when suitably prompted can criticise anything; the artistry of a games cover, the superfluous ambiance of a settlement, frame rates, the pigmentation of a characters eyes or the latent personification of a females cleavage. And there’s nothing inherently erroneous in proclaiming a games falsity. It’s the type of extroverts that participate in orchestrated pacts with other vindictive hypocrites to pervade the casual observer, that galvanise their farcical postulation’s by allocating 1/10 scores on IMDB with multiple accounts making any fair, reflective assessment of a game rendered virtually mute by the excessive manipulation of its aggregation. Now imagine if that kind of puerile commitment could be harnessed and utilised for more receptive progression, rather than dismissive revile?\n\nNow anyone who knows me, or has had the misfortune of conversing with me will testify to my flippant gestures and dismissive policies. I can conclude that your mumbling with audited progression something of a rebuke that motions towards kettles and darkened cavity. And yes the credibility of my own humility in this instance is vacuous, considering the scolding pronouncements recited with an audible tone of condescension that often frequents much of my appraisals. But despite my contradictions, I’d like to believe that any animosity that, if not retentive is conveyed with judicious, agnostic pragmatism. Well, unless we are referencing Call of Duty. Which reminds me. I need to visit IMDB.\n\nDo gamers expect too much? Or should we accept nothing less than perfection? Let me know your thoughts.\n\nIf you’re as inquisitive, potentially neurotic and certainly harbouring myopic, distant tendencies as I do, then your probably frequently left pondering questions posed by friends, families and colleagues; is there really a superior being that watches over us? Will we ever truly reach a state of former prosperity after this recension? Is the sky green or are we all just merely colour blind? How has Keanu Reeves retained the status of “actor” without actually submitting any such vocations for over 2 decades? All very probing, intimately diverse conundrums, all requiring sufficient deliberation and level of sophisticated, detailed analysis, that even Stephan Hawking would struggle to evaluate such queries with a definitive and accurate hypothesis. But above all over routes of inquisitive enquiries, with incessant though passionate curiosity, is how I can refrain-with increasing abstinence-from Saturday night television, and alternatively devote my precarious time to gaming instead?\n\nThe sheer volume of allotted time I’ve apparently, negligently dedicated leaves many people with an apprehensive contortion, of perplexed bewilderment so clearly tethered across their complexion, with just the tiniest, discernible hint of resentment and perhaps even vague notion of pity, as though my methods should only be subtlety audible through hushed tones. To them such diligence to gaming is a propensity only reciprocated by an isolated teenager, bereft of any social interactions. What seems to escape these individuals is that I enjoy dispelling the monotony of laboured, wholly uninspired TV like colonic irrigation, rather than suffering the indignity of sacrificing the scattered increments of internal functions that deteriorate with an exertion of its incessant presence, accosting what little intellectual capacity that hasn’t been corrupted, by protecting it from further penetrating fissures. I don’t hold any concealed vendetta or a moralistic aversion to the proceedings, nor do I deliberately tarnish what appears to be a highly revered form of entertainment, but I simply nurture a considerable lack of empathy for regurgitated concepts, intent on reducing the general populace imagination for ingenuity, especially considering the abundance of talented on-line contributors ,without the collateral allurement afforded by television correspondence.\n\nBesides all the negativity and menagerie of episodic comas, as well as putting aside my internal antagonism, there is a surprising, beneficial ramifications from regular television frugality. Its seems like a selfish request to depart from the vicinity of your partner in favour of the blissful accordance of your console, that cordially entices you like a burlesque dancer, with her alluring trappings and exotic persuasions. And though my girlfriend isn’t the least bit inclined to subvert my gaming aspirations with embittered resentment, nor does she associate with games in the similar, cathartic enthusiasm that my years of potentially excessive perspiration, have bestowed. But programmes that I perceive as derivative and repetitive, seem to enrich my girlfriends jovial persuasions, which as a consequence allows each of us the desired time–without the restrictive approximation of ourselves–to hinder the credible enjoyment you can have from being separated from one another, admitting the fabled hospitality of seclusion from each others presence. There’s a mutual solidarity in our embellished desires for alternate separatism, that allows for not only further allotted virtual exploits for myself, but a harnessing of your relationship.\n\nBut I’ve averted further from the point of this meandering article, which appears to be a flippant revulsion to the industry as an entity. The fact remains that I would rather preserve my resources parrying the advances of devilish abominations in God of War, or pirouetting gracefully with deadly, interspersed reprisals to any foe that attempts further blasphemous advancements upon my person in DMC, rather than observing a distressed individual, divulging bereaved sentiments of how they were inspired to belch vocalised diarrhoea to the nation–for “entertainment purposes”–after the tragic demise of their mother, due to the shock of witnessing her fateful dog being used as an inadvertent ramp for a fire engine, that was attempting to extinguish the flames that had enveloped their family home which is now a smouldering carcass. Perhaps I’m being slightly too remiss in conclusions and blatant supposition, but the only alternative to my futile ramblings, is that television is more emotive and absorbing than any game could ever be. Hmm? Interesting theory, but let me counter that argument with this one, retaliative gesture……*Powers up PlayStation*\n\nDo you seek solace in the company of your games whilst others watch TV? Or can you majestically incorporate both? Let me know your thoughts on this almost irrelevant subject matter. Cheers.\n\nI’ve always held a strong affinity for the captivation and overall seduction of simulated music in computer games. The way music captures a defining moment with fluid synchronicity and encapsulates it with just the simplest of orchestral tones, that remain permanently ingrained in your memory, long after you’ve forgotten the initial game that it featured in. I’m constantly humming some ominous but distinctly recognisable tune, plucked randomly from somewhere in the deepest recesses of my mind, that illuminates an instinctive smile of tranquillity but still difficult to competently differentiate exactly where its origins lie. It’s like a momentary act of providence of domesticated comfort, somehow encapsulating those moments with an accentuated melody. Illustrative memories are almost secondary in comparison, with auditory sounds emphasising your whimsical recollections. Familiarised music is comforting, with nostalgic implications that remind you of simpler times, and I bet that if I was to hypothetically ask you about any game-new or old-that apart from sporadic interludes of hazy illustrations formulating cognitive reactions, that you could vividly, without little pause, comfortably recite a theme, sound or any form of musical interlude with almost perfect clarity.\n\nThe auditory percussions are just as important as the visual stimulants and graphical superiority to such an extent, that you may not even realise what an influence a piece of music can be. There can be a strange absurdity associated with particular pieces of music, compelling but also motivation to persevere even when all conceivable hope has dissipated. For instance, almost everyone can recite, hum or vocalise any musical accompaniment to Sonic the Hedgehog; the intro music, a particular boss battle or jovially recall of themes with involuntary foot tapping, to the composition of the Green Hill zone or Chemical Plant. Me, the drowning music featured in Sonic still haunts my dreams, as I continue to search for those illusive, ascending bubbles to restore oxygenated order and grant a desperate reprieve from asphyxiation. As the countdown descends-5-and the music accelerates-4-to reiterate the growing urgency-3-for Sonic to breath, as you become more agitated-2-consumed by the impending predicament that you know-1-is unavoidable and then-0-the struggle is over, and your responsible.\n\nResident Evil 2 featured the disconcerting ambiance that amplified the terrible sense of isolation, which was created, not by the percussing concertos or booming gravitas associated with an orchestra, but through the subtle influences of minimal interludes of disconcerting bells, the slow foreboding creaking of the doors and constant ticking of a distorted clock which all culminate in deterring you from functioning on an emotional level. Subverting rational deliberation and leave you (me) cowering in the corner, evaluating the minimum ammunition at my disposal and devising either an appropriate plan, as well as motivating courage to open the door to the adjacent room, or merely adopting the fetal position for another hour (of course the latter is an exaggeration that I never considered) cough. Where would games like DMC be if not for the highly influential, accelerated break beats that inspire the generous slaughtering of a plenitude of emotionally crippled, demonic spawns? The kinetic hostility is proportionately more evocative with the appropriate musical accompaniment. With an audible depiction of a physical retaliation, any subjected combative situation is heightened by musical stimulants.\n\nBut as usual, I digress too furtively and have strayed far from my initial point; that the sounds, music, no matter how genial, generic or inconsequential are important. Whether a conductor brandishing that musical stick to illicit beautifully crafted crescendos, or created via a synthesiser by one man, copious amounts of coffee and patience, iconic music will live forever in your auditory portion of your psyche. Or in my case, an unrelenting nightmare. Forgive Me Sonic!!\n\nWhat video game music will you never forget? Let me know your most memorable musical pieces."
