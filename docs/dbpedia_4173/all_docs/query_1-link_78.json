You can use AethersX2 to play PS2 games without buying PlayStation 2 and can even be played on mobile devices. You must download the BIOS and install it to AethersX2. After that you have to prepare an ISO format game.\n\nDownload\n\nAethersx2 Android | Download\n\nNethersx2 Mod Android | Download\n\nAethersx2 IOS | Download\n\nAethersx2 Windows | Download\n\nAethersx2 Linux | Download\n\nAethersx2 Mac | Download\n\nDownload BIOS\n\nGame iso\n\nHow To Install Aethersx2\n\n1. First of all, of course you have to download the aethersx2 application, bios and games. After downloading, you can immediately install and open the application. After opening it then select next.\n\n2. Here there is an FAQ that you can read first, then select next.\n\n3. In the third step here there are several options, select Optimal/Safe if your device has high end specifications and select Fast/unsafe if your device has specs i>Low End.\n\n4. In the fourth step, you select import bios.\n\n5. Select one of the bios that you downloaded earlier.\n\n6. Check that the bios is active.\n\n7. Then select next.\n\n8. The fourth step is to add the game that was downloaded earlier.\n\n9. Select Game Directory.\n\n10. Select Next.\n\n11. Select Game.\n\n12. Tekken 5 Screenshot\n\n13. God Of War 2 Screenshot\n\n14. God Hand Screenshot\n\nRequestment\n\nRequirements for installing aethersx2 are a minimum of Android 7.0 (Nougat) and above and an architecture supported by Arm64 (64bit).\n\nTo use aethersx2 smoothly and smoothly when playing games, we recommend that you meet the following specifications:\n\nAndroid\n\nProsesor : Use Minimum Qualcomm Snapdragon 870\n\nAndroid Version : Android 10 +\n\nWindows\n\nProsesor : Use Minimum Intel core i3 gen 10 +\n\nWindows Version : Windows 10 +\n\nLinux\n\nProsesor : Use Minimum Intel core i3 gen 10 +\n\nLinux Version : Ubuntu 20 +\n\nHow To improve Device performance\n\nUse Skia's Vulkan renderer, especially if your device uses a Mali GPU. but in some games it may not support you can use opengl if that happens.\n\nFor some devices using Mali gpu, enabling the Threaded Presentation feature in Advanced Settings can improve performance significantly but in some devices it will crash (for example google pixel 7)\n\nUnderclock the CPU, which is able to mimic the performance pipeline by setting the cycle rate to a negative number, and skip cycles to a positive number in System settings. This will crash some games, and cause crashes when this feature is enabled if the game does not support it.\n\nIf the game slows down depending on your eyes, this may be due to the GS download renderer, which is very slow on low spec GPUs. You can toggle the hardware download mode feature to Asynchronous or Disabled, but this may cause some problems to the app and it may crash.\n\nYou could try switching the SPU3's mixing mode to Async Mix instead of Timestretch. But in some games it is not compatible, it is recommended to try it first.\n\nFor some devices (e.g. Sony, Xiaomi, Samsung and Pixel), using affinity control can increase performance to the highest level.\n\nLowering the number of gpu renders can improve performance, but this will hurt the image quality (suitable for low spec devices).\n\nIf after updating the aethersx2 application it becomes slow and the performance seems to be slow, you can delete the data and cache then enter the application again.\n\nUse the OpenGL renderer if your device has low specifications.\n\nFeatures\n\nGPU\n\nSupports 3 modern renderers, namely OpenGL, Vulkan and software. adjust this renderer to your device's specifications, because if it doesn't match it will reduce performance or the game will crash.\n\nAdding a resolution level feature from the smallest 1.5x to 8x will make the game display clearer, but in some games this is not supported.\n\nOffers custom bilenier filtering that you can choose nearest-neightbot (point), bilenier (forced), bilenier (ps2), bilenier (forced excluding sprite).\n\nMipmaping : automatic, off, basic, full (ps2 mips).\n\nSupport cusrom trilinear filtering.\n\nanisotropic filtering 1x to 16x.\n\nBlending Accuracy minimum, basic, medium, hight, full, ultra.\n\nTexture Preloading : partial and full.\n\nAspect Ratio : Sretch, auto standard, strandard, widescreen.\n\nSettings\n\nWe will provide aethersx2 settings that are suitable for your device, so that the experience of using aethersx2 is smoother. We divide it into two settings, namely Low End for devices with low specifications (device specifications below Snapdragon 870) and High End Devices with high specifications (device specifications above Snapdragon 870).\n\nLow End Settings\n\nInterface\n\nFast boot : Enable\n\nSystem\n\nAffinity control mode : Disable\n\nMulti Treaded VU1 : Enable\n\ninstant VU1 : Enable\n\nFast CDVD : Disable\n\nWarn About Unsafe Settings : Disable\n\nEnable Frame Limit : Disable\n\nGPU\n\nGpu Render - For Mali GPU use Vulkan, For Andreno Use OpenGL.\n\nUpscale Multiple : 1x native\n\nBilinear Filtering : Bilinear (Forced)\n\nMipmaping : Disable\n\nTrilinear Filtering : Disable\n\nAnisotropic Filtering : Disable\n\nBlending Accuracy : minimum\n\nTexture Preloading : None\n\nAspect Ratio : Auto Standard\n\nFMV Aspect Ratio : Off\n\nBilinear Upscaling : None\n\nEnable widescreen patches : Disable\n\nEnable No-Interlacing patches : Disable\n\nHost Vsync : Disable\n\nFXAA Shader : Disable\n\nTV Shader : None\n\nShade Boost : Disable\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nEnable EE Recompiler : Enable\n\nEnable VU0 Recompiler (Micro Mode) : Enable\n\nEnable VU1 Recompiler : Enable\n\nEnable IOP Recompiler : Enable\n\nEE FPU Correct Add/Sub\n\nEnable Fast Memory : Enable\n\nGPU Palette Conversion : Enable\n\nDithering : OFF\n\nDe-Interlacing : AUTO\n\nCRC Fix Level : OFF\n\nVsync Queue Size : 1 Frame\n\nSoftWare Rendering Threads : 4 threads\n\nInteger Scaling : Disable\n\nScreen Offsets\n\nShow OverScan : Disable\n\nAnti Blur : Disable\n\nDisable Interlace Offset Disable\n\nSkip presenting Duplicate Frames : Enable\n\nSync to Host Refresh Rate : Disable\n\nDisable Threaded Presentation : Disable\n\nEnable Logcat Logging : Disable\n\nEnable File logging : Disable\n\nEnable EE Console : Disable\n\nEnable EOP Console : Disable\n\nEnable CDVD Read Logging : Disable\n\nDebug GPU Device : Disable\n\nDisable FrameBuffer Fetch : Disable\n\nDisable Duel-Source blending : Disable\n\nOverride Texture Barriers : AUTO\n\nOverride Geometry Shaders : AUTO\n\nHigh End Settings\n\nInterface\n\nFast boot : Enable\n\nSystem\n\nAffinity control mode : Disable\n\nMulti Treaded VU1 : Enable\n\ninstant VU1 : Enable\n\nFast CDVD : Disable\n\nWarn About Unsafe Settings : Disable\n\nEnable Frame Limit : Disable\n\nGPU\n\nGpu Render - For Mali GPU use Vulkan, For Andreno Use OpenGL.\n\nUpscale Multiple : 8x native\n\nBilinear Filtering : Bilinear (PS2)\n\nMipmaping : Full\n\nTrilinear Filtering : Enable (PS2)\n\nAnisotropic Filtering : 2x\n\nBlending Accuracy : High\n\nTexture Preloading : None\n\nAspect Ratio : Stretch (Fil Screen)\n\nFMV Aspect Ratio : WideScreen\n\nBilinear Upscaling : Smooth\n\nEnable widescreen patches : Enable\n\nEnable No-Interlacing patches : Disable\n\nHost Vsync : Disable\n\nFXAA Shader : Disable\n\nTV Shader : None\n\nShade Boost : Disable\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nEnable EE Recompiler : Enable\n\nEnable VU0 Recompiler (Micro Mode) : Enable\n\nEnable VU1 Recompiler : Enable\n\nEnable IOP Recompiler : Enable\n\nEE FPU Correct Add/Sub\n\nEnable Fast Memory : Enable\n\nGPU Palette Conversion : Enable\n\nDithering : OFF\n\nDe-Interlacing : AUTO\n\nCRC Fix Level : OFF\n\nVsync Queue Size : 1 Frame\n\nSoftWare Rendering Threads : 5 threads\n\nInteger Scaling : Disable\n\nScreen Offsets\n\nShow OverScan : Disable\n\nAnti Blur : Disable\n\nDisable Interlace Offset Disable\n\nSkip presenting Duplicate Frames : Enable\n\nSync to Host Refresh Rate : Disable\n\nDisable Threaded Presentation : Disable\n\nEnable Logcat Logging : Disable\n\nEnable File logging : Disable\n\nEnable EE Console : Disable\n\nEnable EOP Console : Disable\n\nEnable CDVD Read Logging : Disable\n\nDebug GPU Device : Disable\n\nDisable FrameBuffer Fetch : Disable\n\nDisable Duel-Source blending : Disable\n\nOverride Texture Barriers : AUTO\n\nOverride Geometry Shaders : AUTO\n\nTips\n\nForce GPU Rendering: enable this feature in device settings Settings > Developer Options > Enable Force GPU Rendering. Enabling this feature will improve performance and graphic quality but drains battery usage, we recommend deactivating it when not playing games.\n\nForce 4X MSAA: enable this feature in device settings Settings > Developer Options > Enable Force 4x MSAA. Enabling this feature will improve performance but drains battery usage, we recommend deactivating it when not playing games.\n\nGame Mode: Activate Game Mode if your device provides this feature, game mode on default devices usually provides more effective performance options.\n\nBattery Saver: Make sure you activate battery saver mode on your device to provide maximum performance.\n\nUse a cooler or be in a cool place, so that processor performance remains stable when playing games. because if your cellphone gets hot, the processor performance will automatically decrease.\n\nUse a USB controller so that control when playing games is easier and more comfortable, this will improve your gaming experience.\n\nGame"
