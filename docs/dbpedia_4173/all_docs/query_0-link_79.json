        "text": "Capcom has been scooping up new domain name registrations and one for Devil May Cry 5 has got gamers speculating that it's a sign of a big reveal at the upcoming E3 2018 event.\n\nAccording to a DMC Discord server (via ResetEra), the domain name for Devil May Cry 5 was registered for Capcom by the GMO Internet Group.\n\nAccording to IGN, it was registered along with other domains for the Japanese video game developer, including one for Monster Hunter: World and Resident Evil 7.\n\nNow IGN is speculating that the registration for Devil May Cry 5 is a sign that a reveal is coming at E3 2018, which gets underway on June 12.\n\nFans have been eagerly anticipating a new Devil May Cry game ever since its director Hideaki Itsuno teased on the last day of 2017 that he had a new game in the pipeline that was reaching its \"climax\".\n\nMuch to the delight of gamers, the game director tweeted: \"Happy new year! I am sorry that I can not present a new project last year. The development of the project is now under climax. I am making a great game so please expect it.\"\n\nItsuno hasn't actually confirmed that the unnamed project is Devil May Cry 5 but there have been persistent rumors that it is.\n\nThe rumors were only fuelled when Capcom recently rolled out remasters of the first three games in the series for the Devil May Cry HD Collection for PC, PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nAnd then a few days ago, Austrian dealer Gamesware sparked even more excitement when it listed the game in PS4 Edition and Xbox One edition, detailing that the title was appearing in 2018. There wasn't much other information that could be gleaned from the listing as it was not accompanied by any artwork or character information.\n\nBut that teaser came as the voice actor for Vergil in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, Daniel Southworth shared a photo on his Facebook that was accompanied by the words \"E3\" and \"motion capture,\" according to SegmentNext, which gave rise to further speculation of an E3 announcement for Devil May Cry 5.\n\nWe shall know soon enough is there is indeed an E3 announcement coming when the gaming conference kicks off next week in Los Angeles."
