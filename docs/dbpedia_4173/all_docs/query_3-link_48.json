        "text": "The hints about new features in the Switch port of Devil May Cry 3 seem to have been explained, but is it a prelude to a Smash Bros. reveal?\n\nEarlier in the week, Devil May Cry producer Matt Walker hinted that Capcom were adding ‘a little something extra’ to the upcoming Switch port of Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition, due out on 20 February.\n\nHe didn’t say any more than that, except to watch out for surprise announcements on 16 January, 30 January, and 13 February. Which is all very unexpected as the previous two Switch ports have come and gone with little fanfare.\n\nBut newly released screenshots, and an update to the official site, seem to give away what the new features are: style switching from Devil May Cry 4.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DevilMayCry/status/1214577683952091136\n\nStyle switching allows you to change styles mid-combo, giving you access to different abilities and weapons as you fight, and you can see in the screenshots the names Swordmaster and Gunslinger in the top left-hand corner.\n\nThe website even spells it out, with the following text: ‘Will you prioritise speed or defence? Swordsmanship or gunplay? The new Style Change system allows you to experience the action through a number of unique Styles allowing for unprecedented variety. Level up the Styles and weapons as you see fit and create a playstyle all your own.’\n\nStyles were in Devil May Cry 3, but you had to switch them manually between missions or at a divinity statute, so it’s quite a big new feature to add.\n\nWhether that counts as a leak or not we’re not sure, but it does seem to give the game away, as the feature wasn’t added to the series until Devil May Cry 4 and isn’t in the remasters of Devil May Cry 3 on other formats.\n\nBut that begs the question of what is going to be announced on the three dates Walker mentioned? It seems unlikely that there’d be even more features added to the Switch remaster so maybe it’s something to do with Devil May Cry 5? Perhaps new DLC of some sort?\n\nOr there’s the ongoing rumour that Devil May Cry’s Dante will be added to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Many have speculated that that’s why the older games are being ported over to the Switch and Nintendo has said that the fifth and final character from the initial Fighter Pass will be added by February 2020.\n\nAn early answer may come from the Nintendo Direct today, at 2.30pm, which is entirely focused on Pokémon. If that doesn’t reveal the new DLC character, then the odds of it being Dante greatly increase.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE : Capcom to ‘awaken dormant IPs’ after ‘indisputable’ success of Devil May Cry 5\n\nMORE : Devil May Cry 1 coming to Switch but is Dante coming to Smash Bros.?\n\nMORE : Devil May Cry 5 review – diabolically stylish"
