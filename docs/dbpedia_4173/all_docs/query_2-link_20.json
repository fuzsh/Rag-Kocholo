        "text": "Past to future story of Mundus plus some extra info\n\n(Wiki copy) Thought you might fond it interesting about how changed up the story lines get....\n\nMundus is the sadistic king of the demon world. Resembling a seraph, he was defeated by Sparda 2,000 years ago.Mundus is dozens of feet tall, with white feathered wings and a third eye on his forehead. He is disloyal, killing one of his generals simply for failing to defeat Dante. Mundus, the nemesis of Dante and Sparda, is responsible for the death of Dante's mother and the corruption of his brother.\n\nHe is the primary antagonist in Devil May Cry, creating Trish to resemble Eva so she could lure Dante to Mallet Island. Mundus and his servants try to kill Dante but Dante is victorious, winning Trish's loyalty and defeating Mundus (who promises to return). Mundus is the only demon Dante cannot kill, even with Trish's help.\n\nA statue of Mundus is seen briefly in Devil May Cry 2. Using this form in the first game (until Dante confronts him), he breaks out of the \"shell\" with an angelic appearance and a scar across his chest. Mundus appears in a bonus scene at the end of Devil May Cry 3, when Vergil sees him as three red glowing orbs in the sky surrounded by electricity (his original form in Devil May Cry). In Dante's storyline in the PlayStation 2 version of Viewtiful Joe, he possesses Captain Blue to take revenge on Dante and Trish. Mundus also appears in the second Devil May Cry novel in a parallel universe, where he is confronted by Dante and Nelo Angelo's forces.\n\nIn DmC: Devil May Cry, Mundus is the primary antagonist: the solidly-built Kyle Ryder, a ruthless banker who controls the world through debt and demonic control. He and Sparda rose through the demonic ranks 9,000 years before the game's events. The triangular \"Mundus\" symbol appears on his forehead as a scar, and he is defeated after the Hellgate was shut down. Mundus is voiced by Tony Daniels in Devil May Cry and Louis Herthum in DmC: Devil May Cry.\n\nSparda is the demonic knight who rebelled for humanity's sake 2,000 years before the events in the Devil May Cry 3 manga. He defeated many demons and their emperor, Mundus, before sealing the gateway between the demonic and human worlds. Sparda's heroism made him legendary in the human world, and he is known as \"the Legendary Dark Knight\".[23]\n\nIn Devil May Cry and its successors, Sparda left his power in his sword (known as the Force Edge or the Sparda) in the demonic realm. To seal the gateway between the worlds Sparda sacrificed his blood and that of a mortal priestess, using two complementary amulets as a key which he brought into the human world. To work, the amulets must be joined. Near the end of his life Sparda took a human wife (Eva) and fathered twin sons (Dante and Vergil).[36] He gave the amulets to Eva, who passed them on to their sons. Vergil and Dante each received a powerful, enchanted sword from their father; Dante's sword was Rebellion, and Vergil's was Yamato.[38] It is unknown how Sparda died, and Dante believed that there was confusion surrounding his father and his legacy.\n\nIn DmC: Devil May Cry, Sparda was Mundus' closest ally and most-trustworthy lieutenant after they rose through the demonic ranks 9,000 years before the events of the game. Sparda fell in love with, and married, Eva (an angel); they had twin sons, Nephilim named Dante and Vergil. Eva was later killed by Mundus, and Sparda was imprisoned in eternal torment. Mundus and the other demons considered the Nephilim threatening, because they had angelic and demonic powers and could kill a demonic king.\n\nDante, the series' primary protagonist, is a mercenary specializing in the paranormal and the primary playable character in the first three Devil May Cry games. He is distinguishable by his red clothing, short silver hair, quick wit, dark sense of humor and cocky attitude. Dante usually has two heavily customized M1911 based pistols (called Ebony and Ivory) or a two-handed sword known as Rebellion.\n\nThe character was voiced by Drew Coombs in the original Devil May Cry and Matthew Kaminsky in Devil May Cry 2. Reuben Langdon received the role in Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, and has returned to the role twice: in Devil May Cry 4 and Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds and in Devil May Cry: The Animated Series.[5] Dante's Japanese voice in Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, and Project X Zone is provided by Toshiyuki Morikawa.\n\nDmC: Devil May Cry features a different Dante from a parallel universe separate from the original series. This version of Dante (a \"nephilim\", described in the game's mythology as a half-angelic, half-demonic hybrid)[6] is voiced by Tim Phillipps. In this version, Dante initially has black hair which turns white near the end of DMC: Devil May Cry. While he is still just as sarcastic and cocky as the original, his attitude is significantly more punk like than the laid back original. Changes to his signature weapons include a slimmer sword, as well as his guns resembling Desert Eagle handguns with the grips twisting to a sharp point, which makes it lack any detachable magazines or a magazine release."
