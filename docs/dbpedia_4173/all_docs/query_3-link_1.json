The sequel had been in development without the input of original series director Hideki Kamiya, and needed some serious course correction.\n\nAs it happened, Itsuno came to Devil May Cry 2 too late to make it great. But he and his peers resolved to pour all of their shared experience of fighting games into Devil May Cry 3.\n\n“And if this isn’t received well, if this doesn’t sell well, that’s it,” he said at the time, as recounted to The Guardian. “We’ll just have to quit Capcom, and do something else.”"
