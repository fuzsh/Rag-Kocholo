        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nDonquixote Doflamingo\n\nBackground:\n\nDonquixote Doflamingo, nicknamed \"Heavenly Yaksha\", is the captain of the Donquixote Pirates. Prior to his imprisonment, he was a member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea with a frozen bounty of Beli 340,000,000, as well as the most influential underworld broker under the codename \"Joker\". He is also a former World Noble, descended from the Donquixote Family.\n\nHe is the first son of the late Donquixote Homing and the older brother of the late Rosinante, both of whom he killed out of feeling betrayed by them. Doflamingo became the King of Dressrosa after taking the throne from Riku Doldo III eight years before the start of the series. He ruled the country tyrannically until he was stripped of his positions as a Warlord of the Sea and king after he was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy near the end of the Dressrosa Arc. After Doflamingo was arrested by Admiral Fujitora along with most of his crew, he was locked up at Impel Down and placed in Level 6. Vegapunk later cloned Doflamingo as one of the Seraphim to replace the Warlords.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nSuperhuman Physical Characteristics,\n\nMaster Hand-to-Hand combatant,\n\nAcrobatics,\n\nCompetent with a flint-lock pistol and can use his feathered coat as a shield,\n\nLimited Poison Manipulation (Utilizes lead bullets in his pistol),\n\nHaki (Intermediate Haoshoku, Intermediate Kenbunshoku, Intermediate Busoshoku),\n\nThread Manipulation (Via Ito-Ito no Mi),\n\nLimited Air Manipulation (Can kick hard enough to create an air wave capable of bisecting three towers),\n\nBody Puppetry (By wrapping threads via Parasito, can control the movements of his opponents with his strings by piercing the nape of the neck where the cervical is located),\n\nPseudo-Flight (Via Sora no Michi),\n\nLimited Fire Manipulation (Via Overheat),\n\nDuplication (Can create a perfect replica of himself to fight alongside him: The Black Knight),\n\nLimited Telepathy Negation (His Birdcage has shown the ability to cut off Transponder Snails ability to telepathically communicate with each other),\n\nLimited Body Control and Regeneration/Self-Healing (High-Low via Shufuku Sagyo),\n\nTransmutation (Capable of converting objects into threads, and control them via Awakening, but has only been shown capable of converting inanimate objects),\n\nAfterimage Creation,\n\nDanmaku,\n\nResistance to Heat Manipulation (Was unaffected by Sanji's Diable Jambe despite the latter's ability to harm the opponent's bones with it),\n\nIce Manipulation (Thawed himself free from Kuzan's ice),\n\nMadness Manipulation, Mind Manipulation and Soul Manipulation via Willpower (Through sheer willpower they can resist losing their mind when absorbing shadows through the Kage Kage no Mi. Shadows belonging to strong willed people are difficult to control, allowing them to rebel against Moria's pact which usually immediately submits a shadow to his supremacy and orders. Spiritual energy is contained within one's soul/life; this energy is represented by the fighting power or the Haki itself. Those with strong souls, which are homologous to shadows, resist the effects of Brook's soul manipulation)\n\nWeaknesses: He has a very pronounced god complex, having a deep-seated arrogance about his self-worth being above others, which, while it does not have a direct affect on his effectiveness in combat, does affect his overall thought process, which can be exploited if approached a specific way, such as when Trafalgar Law revealed his connection to the family of D to surprise and anger him, leaving him open for an attack.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nHisoka Morow\n\nBackground:\n\nHisoka speaks little of his past because he is uninterested in it. It is revealed, however, that Hisoka joined the Phantom Troupe under false pretenses at some point after the Kurta massacre, and about two years before the events in Yorknew City, after defeating the previous #4.\n\nAround the same time, he \"initiated\" Kastro to Nen at the Heavens Arena, sensing potential in him. He then took part in the 286th Hunter Exam, during which he murdered 20 examinees. He was disqualified for almost killing an examiner during his first attempt.\n\nDuring his time in the Phantom Troupe, Hisoka may have shirked his duty of attending their meetings, as Machi made sure to let him know that attendance at the upcoming one in Yorknew City was mandatory for all members (not just those with nothing better to do) and the leader might personally come after him for skipping out, and Franklin later asked her if she was sure Hisoka would be present, which she was not.\n\nPowers and Abilities:\n\nSuperhuman Physical Characteristics,\n\nGenius Intelligence,\n\nEnhanced Senses (Detected Kalluto Zoldyck while he was using Zetsu. Kalluto's Zetsu was described as \"flawless\"),\n\nMaster Hand-to-Hand Combatant (Hisoka can fight on par with Chrollo Lucilfer and can fight entire crowds. He is superior to the likes of Gotoh, who is in turn vastly superior to Canary, who at the age of 13 was able to singlehandedly defeat a group of armed bandits even without Nen),\n\nAcrobatics,\n\nNen Manipulation (Transmuter; Hisoka is an extraordinarily talented Nen user of prodigious talent. He can use the four basic and all of the advanced techniques. His aura is described as ominous and eerie even in Ten),\n\nAccelerated Development (Hisoka is considered to be a Nen prodigy, learning the basic principles in a few weeks when it would take an average person a year to learn Ten. During his fight with Moritonio he displayed the ability to use Gyo despite never being taught that, and quickly developed his signature Nen ability, Bungee Gum, on the fly and defeated Moritonio with it),\n\nEnhanced Fear Manipulation (His aura is described as disgusting and scary and his aura terrified Gon and Killua and would have killed them had Wing not got involved),\n\nWeapon Mastery (Hisoka is highly adept with using playing cards as weapons and has never been shown to miss in the entire series. He was also able to create a makeshift flail and wielded it skilfully enough to harm Chrollo),\n\nTransmutation and Adhesive Manipulation (Hisoka can turn his aura into a sticky elastic substance called Bungee Gum),\n\nSurface Scaling (Hisoka can walk on walls with Bungee Gum),\n\nAttack Reflection (Hisoka can deflect projectiles back at his opponent. He was able to launch Razor's ball right back at him and sent all of Gotoh's coins back at him),\n\nLimited Illusion Creation (With Texture Surprise, Hisoka can manifest imagery to change its appearance and texture. He claims he can replicate over 1,000 textures and can fool Nen users of the Spider's calibre),\n\nStealth Mastery (Was able to remain hidden from Killua, Amane, and Tsubone, who are all highly skilled assassins. Snuck into the Hunter's Association HQ and assassinated Teradein without being seen),\n\nResurrection (Hisoka can use Bungee Gum to restart his heart, resuscitating him),\n\nLimited Inorganic Physiology (Hisoka has replaced his lost hand, leg, and parts of his face with Bungee Gum and Texture Surprise),\n\nImmense Pain Tolerance (Was smiling despite having broken all of his fingers. Did not mind losing both arms to Kastro. Didn't notice that his leg was blown off),\n\nWeaknesses: His immense pain tolerance can be used against him, as Hisoka failed to notice his leg was blown off by Chrollo's Sun and Moon. Zetsu involves keeping one's aura exclusively in the body; it makes a Nen user more vulnerable to physical, and Nen attacks because one doesn't have any aura on the outside of one's body to protect oneself.\n\n—————————\n\nSong: No Strings Attached (Brandon Yates)\n\nDonquixote Doflamingo's confident strides took him through the elaborate flower field within the confines of his opulent castle. His signature grin remained ever present, while the soft rustle of his pink feathered cape accompanied his every motion. Unbeknownst to many, the warlord secretly controlled the island of Dressrosa, aided by his fearsome crew, the Donquixote Pirates.\n\nDoflamingo suddenly sensed a presence through his keen Observation Haki, his gaze shifting towards a nearby tree. Maintaining his characteristic smile, he spoke aloud,\n\n\"You truly believe you can catch a Warlord of the Sea off guard? Either you're audacious or idiotic.\"\n\nHisoka elegantly walked across the side of the tree trunk, coming into view. With characteristic flamboyance, he addressed Doflamingo, the Heavenly Demon. Hisoka said, his voice filled with a hint of theatricality.\n\n\"Ah, your illustrious reputation truly holds up, Doflamingo. I was curious to see if you would notice the faint trace of my presence.\"\n\nHe then descended to the ground, a picture of refined elegance. Doflamingo's hand raised slightly, his demeanor exuding menace despite his smile as he issued a warning, his eyes narrowing at the sight of Hisoka.\n\n\"My power reigns supreme. If you've come to challenge me, know that the gap between us is wider than the celestial heights where I rule and the lowly hell where you are destined.\"\n\n\"Oh, you are clearly mistaken. I am merely here to-\"\n\nBefore Hisoka could finish his sentence, flourishing a hand while doing so, Doflamingo used barely perceivable Haki enhanced string to cut an invisible incoming line of Bungee Gum Nen that Hisoka tried to discreetly cast.\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nHisoka's eyes widened marginally, and he let out a soft, impressed gasp, a flicker of surprise crossing his expression. A malevolent chuckle escaped Doflamingo's lips as he boasted,\n\n\"If you think you can gain the upper hand with underhanded tactics, you're sorely mistaken. I've reached where I am today because I'm not so easily fooled.\"\n\nHisoka maintained his ever-present smirk, acknowledging Doflamingo's stealth maneuver. He responded,\n\n\"And don't think you're completely discreet either. I acutely sensed the strings you surreptitiously conjured from your fingertips.\"\n\nDoflamingo's unwavering smile wavered for a brief moment, revealing a flicker of surprise and annoyance, which caused an artery on his forehead to pulsate slightly. He couldn't help but think to himself,\n\n\"How did he discern the nature of my Devil Fruit power so effortlessly?\"\n\nHisoka executed a swift rush, launching a powerful kick at Doflamingo. In a quick reaction, the Heavenly Demon lifted his leg to block the assault, his signature chuckle echoing.\n\n\"Seems like this will be a more intriguing encounter than I initially assumed.\"\n\nHe mused, his tone laced with amusement. Hisoka attempted a follow-up attack, trying to pivot and strike with his opposite leg. However, Doflamingo deftly responded by twirling forward, avoiding the blow. As he spun, he invoked his unique ability, declaring,\n\n\"Pentachromatic Strings!\"\n\nIn response, five vibrant strings sliced through the air, leaving bleeding slashes on the body of the magician. Surprisingly, rather than reacting to the pain, Hisoka appeared to relish it.\n\n\"Mmm, the cutting edge of your strings feels absolutely delightful!\"\n\nHisoka articulated in an aroused voice, mildly unsettling Doflamingo with his twisted enthusiasm. Seizing the opportunity, the magician retracted his leg and promptly utilized his Bungee Gum Nen to disrupt the Heavenly Demon's footing, readying himself for a subsequent offense.\n\nHisoka swiftly prepared another kick, only to have it intercepted by the Heavenly Demon's arms fortified with Haki. The Magician utilized them as a point of leverage to form his Nen into purple flails, which he hurled from behind. Doflamingo showcased impressive defense, enveloping his back with Haki to withstand the strikes.\n\nUndeterred despite the futility of his previous attacks, Hisoka landed gracefully, readying another powerful kick. However, midway through his movement, he suddenly found himself suspended in mid-air, seized by slender strings that held his body motionless. Doflamingo ascended into the air, employing the strings to elevate his position, capturing the magician in his control. Doflamingo's tone exuded confidence as he stated,\n\n\"I informed you that the difference in our capabilities is akin to two vastly different realms. Your powers may be intriguing, but I've grown weary of this encounter. What do you think of this?\"\n\nHe proceeded to tighten the strings gripping Hisoka's body, causing blood to seep through the points where the strings sliced into his flesh. The magician gritted his teeth with a grin, trying to endure the pain of the tight strings cutting into his flesh. Hisoka managed to respond, his voice strained but still maintaining a hint of arousal.\n\n\"Ah, it's a bit... kinky, don't you think?\"\n\nDoflamingo's eyebrow twitched in response at Hisoka's twisted remark. The Heavenly Demon found the magician's reaction both off-putting and intriguing in its own morbid way. He replied with a hint of disdain.\n\n\"You're one sick, masochistic freak.\"\n\nAs a wicked smirk spread across his lips, Doflamingo retrieved a childhood trinket – a flintlock pistol, aiming it directly at the suspended Hisoka. With a cold tone and a deadly smile, he uttered the menacing words,\n\n\"If you crave like so much, find joy in your demise.\"\n\nHe squeezed the trigger, firing off three bullets in quick succession, their trajectories aimed at the magician. The magician manifested a flurry of playing cards, coated with Nen, between his nimble fingers. With a swift flick of his wrists, Hisoka sent the cards hurtling through the air, slicing up the incoming bullets while simultaneously targeting the Celestial Dragon. The Heavenly Demon reacted with great agility, deflecting two cards with a well-timed Overheat whip of strings. The last card found its mark, slicing through Doflamingo's beloved pistol, rendering it useless.\n\nWitnessing the look of startled disbelief on Doflamingo's face, Hisoka couldn't help but chuckle at the sight. In a taunting tone, he teased,\n\n\"Oh? Did I happen to shatter your precious little toy? Please, don't shed tears for it. It's simply a plain old gun.\"\n\nCountless veins of fury became visible across Doflamingo's face. The \"plain old gun\" held particular significance, known only to his trusted crew members. His anger boiled over, and he raised his hand, pointing at Hisoka.\n\n\"You insolent pest. You'll rue your audacity! String Bullet!\"\n\nDoflamingo unleashed a barrage of compacted string bullets, aiming to inflict excruciating damage on his enemy before bringing an end to the encounter. With a swift motion of his body, Hisoka summoned a sturdy Nen barrier to intercept the incoming string bullets momentarily. The reflected projectiles then returned towards Doflamingo. The Celestial Dragon adeptly crossed his arms, coating them with Haki to absorb the impacts. This allowed The Magician to spin his Nen flails around, successfully tearing through the strings binding him, liberating him from the restrictive constraints.\n\nHisoka leapt up, and launched a Nen-coated string, attempting to land a strike on Doflognito. The Heavenly Demon swiftly evaded the attack by dodging his head to the side. Hisoka retrieved his card, grazing the Celestial Dragon, but this momentary distraction left him exposed to a powerful front flip kick to the face as he landed on the ground with a resounding thud.\n\nDoflamingo propelled himself forward, preparing to execute another Pentachromatic Strings assault. However, Hisoka swiftly countered the incoming attack with a Nen-enhanced punch. In a swift act, Hisoka attempted to extend his Nen as offensive extensions, only to have Doflamingo seize them and deliver a powerful Haki-fortified kick to the magician's stomach, causing him to double over.\n\nDespite the resilience of his Nen and his enjoyment for pain, the relentless impacts were beginning to take a toll on the magician. He retreated, clutching his aching stomach muscles in discomfort. Doflamingo couldn't repress his smirk, clearly enjoying the sight of his adversary's discomfort.\n\n\"Oh, I see you're finally grasping the depth of this battle. Seems like you've bitten off more than you can chew.\"\n\nThough admitting the gravity of his disadvantage, The Magician's face beamed with excitement. His pained smile shifted back to a wide grin, and he exclaimed with perverse enthusiasm,\n\n\"Mmm, your power is absolutely delightful! I could be in danger of losing my head if I don't remain vigilant!\"\n\nAs Hisoka's Nen glowed over his crotch area, it shined so brightly so you would not be able to tell how big his erection was. Doflamingo flew forward with his string powers, still somewhat unsettled by The Magician's unusual enjoyment of the battle. With a swift move, he executed a kick with a string connected to his knee and foot, shouting, \"Be careful with what you say. Fretsaw!\"\n\nHisoka dodged the attack, but the castle that Doflamingo's pirate family resided in and the hill it perched upon were abruptly severed, shooting upward into the air before crashing back to the ground with a thunderous impact. Hisoka's eyes widened at the feat, and his visible joy around his groin went down. Having witnessed such a display, he realized that Doflamingo's words about the difference in their powers hadn't been an empty boast. It became abundantly clear that the Celestial Dragon possessed an extraordinary strength that he had yet to match. As Doflamingo roared,\n\n\"Pentachromatic Strings!\"\n\nHisoka was swiftly slashed across the back, his blood seeping from the wound. The Magician swiftly dodged away from the attack, recognizing the need to maintain a safe distance from the Celestial Dragon's powerful assault. With a determined expression, Hisoka removed a deck of cards, coating them with his Nen, and propelled them at Doflamingo. However, the Celestial Dragon effortlessly countered the assault by shielding himself with his feathered cape, which glowed black as it absorbed the barrage of cards. The Haki-imbued defense effectively neutralized the incoming attack, leaving Doflamingo unscathed.\n\nAs the last of Hisoka's cards left his hand, The Magician prepared to launch another assault. But to his surprise, he found himself unable to move. Looking down, he saw that a single thin string was impaled into the back of his neck, effectively paralyzing him. Doflamingo's taunting words echoed,\n\n\"Did you, for a moment, think you had a chance? The truth is, I allowed you to fight as long as I did because I wanted to allow you to entertain the illusion of victory before revealing that you never stood a chance. You're now under my absolute control. The battle is over. I have won.\"\n\nDoflamingo flexed his fingers, clearly enjoying his newfound dominance over The Magician. A chilling shift occurred in the atmosphere, the air taking on a dark, ominous purple hue. A sense of bloodlust emanated from Hisoka, growing stronger by the second. With fierce determination, The Magician declared,\n\n\"I refuse to let anyone, including you, control my actions. Now, you've awakened a fierce desire within me. There's only one way to quell this intensity.\"\n\nThe air crackled with tension as Hisoka unleashed a savage, animalistic scream, his Nen surging within him as it destroyed the string controlling him. Doflamingo, despite being taken aback by the immense bloodlust radiating from The Magician, refused to falter. Channeling his pride and arrogance, he proclaimed,\n\n\"I am a Celestial Dragon! I am inherently superior to every living being because of my prestigious birthright! You're just an abnormal, perverse, repulsive clown, and your existence pales in comparison to my divine status!\"\n\nDoflamingo unleashed his Conqueror's Haki, the overwhelming aura of his will power crashing against the intense bloodlust emanating from The Magician. The two forces collided, causing a noticeable tension in the air as their opposing pressures clashed. The Celestial Dragon's ambitious spirit sought to overpower Hisoka's similarly strong bloodlust, each will determined to gain dominance over the other.\n\nThe battle reached its most intense stage as they engaged in a fierce, close-quarters brawl. Nen-imbued attacks, infused with the power of Ryu, clashed with attacks fortified by Haki, causing shockwaves that reverberated throughout the flower-bedecked plateau. Their strikes and counterstrikes unleashed waves of energy, the combination of purple aura and black Haki creating a display of immense power and destruction.\n\nDoflamingo, utilizing his incredible string powers, caught one of The Magician's incoming punches and swung him around, then slammed him forcefully to the ground, smashing him through numerous trees in the process. Ignoring the pain, Hisoka freed himself from the strings restraining him and dashed forward once more. With a cry of \"Fallbright!\" Doflamingo hurled five sharp strings at The Magician, each one lodging deeply into his body. Despite the painful stabs, Hisoka barely flinched, his focus unbroken as he pressed on with his determined charge.\n\nHisoka jumped and took a a big leap to go for a diving kick. Doflamingo countered it with a Haki enhanced kick, before using his other leg to push the Magician back into the air, leaving him vulnerable. With a swift, aerial move, Doflamingo ascended to Hisoka, grabbing both his wrists. He then created a string connecting the heel of his foot to his knee. The Heavenly Demon positioned his string-rigged leg over The Magician's right shoulder, setting up another deadly Fretsaw maneuver. The two spun towards the ground after making a full revolution, and slammed into the earth with a resounding impact.\n\nDoflamingo stood over the prone Hisoka, admiring the result of his attack. The right arm of The Magician lay severed, bleeding heavily from the injury. A smug smile formed on Doflamingo's face as he taunted,\n\n\"Are you satisfied with the pain? Does it suit your tastes?\"\n\nDefying the conventions of debilitating injury, Hisoka displayed an unexpected resilience. Undaunted, he swiftly extended his remaining hand, ensnaring Doflamingo's head in a strong grip of Bungee Gum Nen. With a hard pull, he forced the Heavenly Demon to kneel down, before retaliating with a swift and powerful Nen-amplified kick to Doflamingo's abdomen. The pain from the impact briefly registered on Doflamingo's face, but his determination remained unshaken. Utilizing his strings, he swiftly severed Hisoka's left arm, adding to the growing collection of severed limbs. Doflamingo leapt back, taking a moment to collect himself. Baring his teeth, he declared,\n\n\"Your defiant spirit even in defeat is admirable, like a wild canine cornered. You should consider yourself fortunate that I am going to bestow upon you a death that exceeds your worth.\"\n\nDoflamingo manifested two colossal, dense sheets of string, ensnaring The Magician's armless body within their grasp. With a cocky stance, he crossed his arms, before uttering the command,\n\n\"Break White!\"\n\nThe Heavenly Demon tightened his grip, applying immense pressure that crushed Hisoka's immobilized form. The Magician's severed limbs spurted blood as the intense force was exerted upon his body. Doflamingo, no longer interested in the defeated Hisoka's lifeless body, began walking away. But as he paused, he was taken aback by a sudden, unexpected resurgence of bloodlust coming from Hisoka. However, this time, the intensity of the bloodlust felt even stronger than before.\n\n\"How is this impossible...\"\n\nHe mumbled the Celestial Dragon, genuinely puzzled by the inexplicable phenomenon. Hisoka's body miraculously stood tall, as though made of a rigid piece of lumber. With a display of incredible skill and determination, he used his Nen powers to restart his vital organs, specifically reinvigorating his heart and lungs. A truly remarkable feat. Furthermore, The Magician transformed the Bungee Gum into arm-like structures, effectively creating organic replacements for his missing limbs.\n\nInfused with a renewed and even more intense bloodlust, Hisoka's attacks gained strength and speed, surpassing his previous efforts. Despite Doflamingo's valiant attempts to defend himself with Armament Haki-shielded arms, it became evident that Hisoka's newfound power was even greater than before. With each strike, The Celestial Dragon felt the increased force and ferocity, signaling that this battle had entered an entirely new level of intensity.\n\nDespite the growing intensity of the struggle, Doflamingo maintained his smug smile, trying to project an air of confidence and superiority.\n\n\"I see you have somehow managed to resurrect yourself with even greater power than before. However, despite your increased speed, your attacks still lack the weight and impact to truly threaten me. But I suppose you have earned the right to witness the ultimate technique at my disposal.\"\n\nDoflamingo soared into the air using his versatile strings, heading towards the bustling town of Dressrosa. Hisoka, displaying remarkable agility and determination, pursued closely behind, skillfully leaping and jumping from one surface to the next, attempting to match the Heavenly Demon's pace. Doflamingo, attempting to gain some distance and disrupt Hisoka's pursuit, executed a swift turn and launched his Overheat technique, intending to lash out and dispel any platforms that could provide assistance. However, The Magician swiftly manipulated the falling rubble, drawing it towards himself in order to utilize it as a new jumping point and continuing his relentless pursuit.\n\nAs Hisoka drew near, Doflamingo swiftly defended himself using a barrage of Pentachromatic Strings, creating an effective barrier to keep The Magician at bay. Sensing an opening, the Heavenly Demon quickly countered with an Athlete-powered kick, a skill that combined Haki and a sharp-pointed shoe to deliver a potent blow. The force of the kick propelled Hisoka away, creating some breathing room for Doflamingo. Sensing the imminent threat posed by Hisoka's relentless assault, Doflamingo again called out,\n\n\"Break White!\"\n\nOnce more, he unleashed a series of large string sheets, aiming to ensnare The Magician. However, Hisoka's remarkable speed and precision allowed him to swiftly maneuver across the sheets, closing the distance with a Nen-charged Ryu punch. Undeterred, Doflamingo swiftly countered with his Pentachromatic Strings, using his Haki-reinforced feather cape for protection first, and then striking back with them, effortlessly swatting The Magician away.\n\nBoth opponents landed on solid ground, their breaths momentarily heavy from the intense battle. Hisoka, though visibly winded, still stood his ground, his determination unwavering. Doflamingo, still wearing his signature smile, couldn't help but comment on The Magician's abilities.\n\n\"Your Devil Fruit powers are indeed intriguing,\" he acknowledged. \"Your use of a gummy aura and ability to resurrect yourself are impressive, albeit a bit unusual. However, you should know that the capabilities of my String-String Fruit go far beyond just creating and manipulating strings. You've yet to witness the full extent of my awakened powers.\"\n\nSeeing Hisoka gearing up for another strike, Doflamingo anticipated the incoming Nen-powered Ryu punch. Recognizing an opportunity, the Heavenly Demon swiftly placed his hand on the ground, transforming the surrounding terrain into strings. With a commanding shout of \"Off White!\" two colossal sheets of strings shot up from the changed ground, forming a shield to block The Magician's attack.\n\n\"Is he a transmuter too? But his range and power is too great for this level of Nen. How can he possess such strong transmutation skills?\"\n\nHisoka found himself contemplating Doflamingo's abilities, particularly his apparent possession of transmutation skills but with a level of range and power that seemed to defy conventional Nen limits. As Doflamingo unleashed a relentless barrage of strings, made from the transformed terrain, The Magician was on the defensive, struggling to fend off the numerous, powerful attacks.\n\nHisoka, finding himself in an increasingly difficult situation, realized he was running out of options. With every surface he attempted to jump to, it changed into strings that attacked him continuously. Only his Nen abilities allowed him to keep from being completely overpowered by the relentless onslaught. Doflamingo, finally ensnaring Hisoka in strings, smirked confidently and declared,\n\n\"Listen up, shrimp. From the very start, you never stood a chance. This is the end.\"\n\nWith Hisoka completely immobilized inside the cocoon of strings, trapped in the air, all he could do was struggle against the bindings, realizing the dire situation he was in. Doflamingo, exuding an aura of absolute authority, raised sixteen pointed spires of strings, each one tipped with a powerful coating of Armament Haki. With an arrogant sneer, he proclaimed,\n\n\"This is your fate for challenging a Celestial Dragon! I'll use my ultimate technique, the 'God Thread!'\"\n\nThe sheer power and intensity behind the Heavenly Demon's attack became evident as he prepared to unleash his fearsome 'sixteen holy assassin bullets.' Doflamingo smirked as he unleashed the fearsome power of his \"God Thread.\" The sixteen pointed spires, tipped with Armament Haki, pierced through Hisoka's body with ease. With a sudden flex of his hand, the strings tore The Magician apart, causing an explosion of flesh and blood. Hisoka's remains lay defeated, his once powerful form now reduced to pieces, unable to withstand the sheer force of the Celestial Dragon's devastating technique.\n\nDoflamingo stood victorious, basking in the aftermath of his triumph. With a menacing smile, the Celestial Dragon spread his arms wide, savoring the moment as the chaotic scene around them reverted back to the familiar surroundings of downtown Dressrosa.\n\n\"We each have our destined places. I was chosen from Heaven, while you reside in the depths of Hell. Fools like you have no right to spoil this world with your very existence.\"\n\n——————\n\nStrength: These two may be some of the strongest in their respective worlds, but Doflamingo had all the advantages. First off, Hisoka Morow may have had the power to fight on par with Uvogin's power, reaching a couple of kilotons of power with his Nen, but Doflamingo has the power to threaten cities on a much wider scale, and hold his own against Luffy in Gear 4, their power around then being approximately 300 GT of TNT, making Doflamingo 107 million times stronger.\n\nSpeed: Hisoka once dodged an explosion, and has regularly kept up with the Zoldyck family, who boasts lightning fast speeds. However, Doflamingo not only has observation haki, which would let him know in advance what's coming, he somewhat scales to Gear 4th Luffy, both of whom can react to 10X light speed.\n\nSkill: Doflamingo has the more skill, as while Hisoka may be a Nen prodigy, the Heavenly Demon has had decades to train with his Devil Fruit abilities, and can hold his own against fighters with either superior abilities, or physical stats.\n\nExperience: While it's unknown who has the greater experience in the variety of combatants they've fought, Doflamingo has the advantage of being 14 years older, letting him have more time to grow his power than Hisoka.\n\nPowers: As tricky as Hisoka's Bungee Gum Nen is, it lacks in the sheer quantity of abilities that the String-String Fruit possesses at Doflamingo's control, the versatility of which would slowly but surely overwhelm him\n\nThe winner is Donquixote Doflamingo.\n\n————————————————————\n\nNext time:\n\n\"My sword has gotten very dull. However, it's three times as thick and does three times the damage of a normal sword. You'd better pray you die quickly, or this could be painful.\"\n\n\"Don't be so quick to throw away your life. No matter how disgraceful or embarrassing it may be, you need to keep struggling to find your way out until the very end.\""
