        "text": "Sony PlayStation 2 Games\n\nThe name Sony is almost synonymous with the range of PlayStation games. PlayStation video game consoles have dominated many gamers’ homes for years after the huge success of the first model.\n\nAfter the launch of the first PS, Sony went ahead to release the second version known as PlayStation 2 at the beginning of the new millennium.\n\nPS2 was another huge success. By March 2012, Sony had sold over 150 million pieces of the game console.\n\nHowever, towards the end of 2012, Sony announced that they would halt production of PS2 in Japan and in the rest of the world in early 2013. By the time PS2 production stopped, the console had been in the market for 12 years, making it the oldest gaming console at the time.\n\nThe 6th generation PS2 also dominated over other popular gaming devices such as Nintendo’s GameCube, Sega’s Dreamcast, and Microsoft’s Xbox. Besides the original PS2, Sony had also launched another slimmer and more lightweight version called Slimline PlayStation 2.\n\nKey Features of PlayStation 2\n\nThe main engine of PS2 comes integrated with 40GB memory. You also get an 8GB memory card included. The console is compatible with previous PS versions. It also comes with support for Dual Shock and Dual Shock 2 using a cable connection.\n\nYou will also never run short of games to play on PS2. There are over 3,800 titles to choose from. Undoubtedly, the most famous PS2 game is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.\n\nOther notable PS2 titles include the likes of Resident Evil 4, Shadow of the Colossus, and Mortal Kombat - Deception just to mention a few. There are thousands of other games that you can explore for your enjoyment and entertainment.\n\nDownload PlayStation 2 Games ISOs\n\nSony may have stopped production of PlayStation 2 but it is still quite possible to play the retro games you enjoyed in the past without any problem or obstacle. Yes, you can do it by using PlayStation 2 games ISOs and emulators.\n\nThe first thing that you will need to do is to download the PS2 emulator to your computer. One of the best emulators for PC today is the PCSX2 that is supported in both Windows and Mac OS operating systems. You can then connect the controllers and your device will work just as well as the original PS2.\n\nIf you have an Android device, you can download the DamonPS2 Pro emulator to play PS2 games on your device at 650FPS and with touchscreen optimized controls. The PlayStation 2 emulators are available on our website for free download.\n\nThey are high-quality emulators with the best graphics for all PS2 ROMs including racing, sports, and Japanese RPG games."
