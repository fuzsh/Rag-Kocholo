Besides Divine Comedy/Dante's Inferno, and Resident Evil, Devil May Cry was also inspired by Castlevania: Symphony of the Night:\n\n- Nevan in DMC3 is a reference to the Succubus boss.\n\n- Dante is half-human, half-demon, while Alucard is half-human, half-vampire, and both men have white hair.\n\n- the music has some dark, Gothic-like genre playing, then changes to heavy metal/rock in both games.\n\n- Shadow from DMC1 is a reference to the one enemy in the inverted castle level, Black Panther.\n\n- both Dante and Alucard have a doppelganger-like boss. Before Alucard's doppelganger emerges, there is some sort of door that has a certain symbol or pattern on it that is similar to the lights in the DMC3 doppelganger battle.\n\n3. In Ace Attorney: Trials And Tribulations, when Maya gets confused of a computerized woman's words, Phoenix answers, \"No Maya, this is Sparda\".\n\n4. Some of the Devil May Cry characters have starred in a couple CapCom games as cameos. One being CapCom Cardfighters (see the misc gallery), and CapCom Fighting Evolution in Jedah's ending (pic shown below):\n\n5. The reason Dante wears red and has white hair is because it's a Japanese tradition of how they create their rolemodels/superheroes (they usually wear red). And the white hair is from a Japanese folklore that has something to do with demon possession.\n\n6. DmC: Devil May Cry is not part of the Devil May Cry series, according to CapCom and Ninja Theory.\n\n7. In the DMC1 novel, Tony/Dante goes on a date with a certain someone by the name of Claire (see fact #2 in the DMC1 trivia on what I'm getting at).\n\n8. Although corrupted Vergil appears as a DLC outfit in Ultimate Marvel vs CapCom 3, his Nelo Angelo form was excluded due to technical difficulties implementing the model with Vergil's playstyle. Instead, he is given the Sparda form. And due to his use of the Yamato, he bears a resemblance to the DMC1 version of Sparda where the Yamato was first introduced in the Legendary Dark Knight costume. This was also the same reason as to why his Nelo Angelo form was not present in Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition.\n\n9. According to Bingo Morihashi (scenario director for Devil May Cry 2, 3, and 4), the canonization and plot lines of the Devil May Cry series are already messed up, and this happens with almost every single game made by CapCom.\n\nHideaki Itsuno says to Bingo, \"If it has to be a parallel world, then it's a parallel world.\" Then later on says, \"You don't even have to explicitly say it's a parallel world.\" Bingo then tells him that doing that may mess up the continuity, but Itsuno did not care, saying those kinds of things happen all the time. It assuaged Bingo's concerns, since it was Hideki Kamiya saying it afterall, and always blamed Kamiya for all his work's screw-ups.\n\n10. There is a knock-off Devil May Cry phone app called, \"Rambo Revenger\", and it's free:\n\n11. Ebony and Ivory are named after a song with the same name(s), by Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder. As for the portraits on the handles, it is unknown on who they are. Descriptions state in some sources that they are just Victorian women with ebony and ivory coloured hair.\n\n12. In DMC1 when Dante uses Air Raid in his Sparda form, there are fleshy tubes and a tear in his back, revealing his spine. However, in DMC3 the fleshy tubes are gone but the opening in the back remains, and what appears to be fleshy material underneath the top wings.\n\n13. The bartender in the DMC3 manga is a reference to the one cop character shown in an old concept for DMC1, when it was originally going to be Resident Evil 4.\n\n14. According to Hiroyuki Nara (character motion artist of DMC2, 3, and 4), the reptilian enemies of this series are ranked from weakest to strongest. Blade being the weakest with the Frosts coming next, then Assault, then Blitz being the strongest.\n\n15. According to Makoto Tsuchibayashi (character creator of DMC1), Sparda was a Count when he lived in the human world.\n\n16. Bayonetta was originally going to be DMC5. Hideki Kamiya (creator of DMC1) approached CapCom after DMC4's release, and requested to collaborate with them to make a DMC5. CapCom unfortunately declined, and the idea got tweaked and made into a different game.\n\n17. According to the DMC1 novel, Ultimate Marvel vs CapCom 3, DMC4 and the Anime, Dante is able to sense the presence of demons from his nose. Meaning he can smell a demon's presence. In the DMC1 novel, the smell is described as being equivalent to death, rot, decay and sulfur. In the anime, it's described as smelling like blood and feces.\n\n18. Dante has a dislike for things with \"too many legs\". Nero, on the other hand, has a dislike for toads.\n\n19. As we are all aware, Dante loves strawberry sundaes. One of the nicknames of a strawberry is \"The Devil's Fruit\", or \"Fruta del Diablo\". The origin of this nickname is a sad one, referring to field workers and their work conditions for when picking strawberries.\n\n20. Most of the gameplay is non-canon with the entire series. For example, move-set strategies that the player(s) choose(s), unlockable costumes, and full gameplays for some characters like Vergil, Lady, and Trish are non-canon with what happens in the Devil May Cry universe.\n\n21. Dante has the ability to shoot guns at an extremely fast pace. So fast, in fact, that it would be equivalent to firing a machine gun. This has been witnessed throughout the entire series. Despite the DMC1 novel being non-canon, there are explanations for how Dante/Tony shoots with his guns provided for him before obtaining Ebony & Ivory, and before awakening his true self, where he would pull the triggers repetitively at extremely high speeds, causing his guns to crap out on him from how trigger happy he gets.\n\n22. According to the Devil May Cry Wiki and crimsonsguns on tripod.com, these are the types of firearms some of the weapons in Devil May Cry are:\n\nEbony & Ivory = Colt 1911s\n\nBlue Rose = Smith & Wesson Model 500 Double-Action Revolver\n\nNeedle Gun (This gun is also featured in Dino Crisis 2) = M249-E1 SAW\n\nSubmachine Guns = Heckler & Koch MP5Ks\n\nGrenade Gun = Penn Arms TL-8 Revolver Launcher\n\nMissile Launcher = FIM-92 Stinger\n\nSpiral = Lahti L-39 20mm Anti-Material Rifle\n\nArtemis = Modified P.R.L 412 (A Resident Evil 4 weapon)"
