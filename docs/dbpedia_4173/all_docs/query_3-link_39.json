        "text": "Devil May Cry is a fan-favorite gaming franchise. The franchise has reached the pinnacle of the gaming world with its unique styles and new added features. Steam gave Devil May Cry 5 a perfect rating after it was released in 2019. It was developed by Capcom. The previous game was released more than a decade ago, so the hype surrounding the Devil May Cry 5 was quite high.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe glimpses before the release and the gameplay trailer proved that it was going to be great. After it was released, people loved it, and the game was applauded. But it was not easy to make the game. The director of the game had to set a few ground rules that were to be followed by everyone on his team. It was a major groundbreaking moment for the game.\n\nDevil May Cry 5 Director Set Ground Rules From Day 1\n\nDevil May Cry 5 is an action-adventure multiplayer game released on 8th March 2019. The game was directed by Hideaki Itsuno. Hideaki Itsuno had a major role in the game’s huge success. While Capcom was busy with Resident Evil 7 and Monster Hunter World, Itsuno was secretly planning for Devil May Cry 5. The director felt a certain kind of pressure since this was the first game of the series in a decade. DMC 2 set a bad record for the franchise, so it was crucial to get the franchise up on its feet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read: “Everybody struggled during that generation”: One PlayStation Console Was a Nightmare for Devil May Cry 3\n\nWith elaborate cutscenes, gorgeous visuals, new online features, and a more modern essence, DMC 5 was going to be a pure action-based game. Half of that developing team shifted to DMC 5 under Hideaki Itsuno after they finished making Resident Evil 7. Itsuno had a target of ensuring that the loyal followers of the franchise were satisfied, and he wanted to attract new gamers, too.\n\nIt was revealed by The Verge that Hideaki Itsuno was very serious regarding DMC 5. Itsuno said,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can’t say that at the time I knew I was doing it correctly. The approach I took was very much, don’t touch the ceiling, the ceiling is where our fans are going to be, and if we touch that they’re going to be angry. So make sure that that ceiling is untouched. But let’s make sure that the entry is a lot more user friendly. It was really nice to hear a lot of our hardcore users say ‘Oh, we get it.’”\n\nThese ground rules set by Hideaki Itsuno helped Devil May Cry 5 reach groundbreaking records. The game sold 2 million copies in just two weeks after its release. By January 2020, it crossed 3.9 million copies worldwide. Even after four years of its release, Devil May Cry 5 is still popular among old gamers, and new gamers are looking to have a taste of it. As of January 2023, the game has sold 6.5 million copies.\n\nAlso Read: Devil May Cry: 5 Demonic Marvel Characters Dante Can Drag Through Hell in a Fight\n\nDevil May Cry Will Be Adapted Into An Anime\n\nThe good news seems to never end for the DMC lovers. Netflix announced that a new Devil May Cry anime is in production. On 29 September 2023, Netflix released a teaser of the upcoming anime. The release date and the cast have not been announced yet. Devil May Cry anime will be based on Adi Shankar’s Bootleg Multiverse. Hideaki Itsuno and Seung Wook Lee are the executive producers, along with Adi Shankar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStudio Mir and Shankar Animation are the production companies. Alex Larsen is the writer, and it was announced that the first season will have eight episodes. It will also have a crossover with Castlevania. From the overall point of view, it is like a festival for Devil May Cry lovers. After the success of the fifth installment, they will get to enjoy the anime.\n\nAlso Read: The Resident Evil 4: Separate Ways DLC Will Have Seven Chapters\n\nSource: The Verge"
