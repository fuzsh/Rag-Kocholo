        "text": "Okay, take this with a generous grain of salt, even if by all accounts it sounds like it could be true.\n\nAccord to a leak on ResetEra (yeah, I know), Capcom is currently at work on Devil May Cry 5. In fact, the game’s been in development for a couple of years now. Capcom was ready to announce the game at the upcoming PlayStation Experience next month, but after the negative feedback Sony received from their E3 2017 showcase, they have reportedly decided to instead debut it at E3 2018. So, why announce it at a Sony event? Well, according to the leak, Sony is partially funding the game, with it set to be a PS4 exclusive, or have some sort of exclusivity.\n\nThere’s more. The game will pick up after Devil May Cry 4, with Hideaki Itsuno directing, and Rueben Langdon reprising his role as Dante. There will potentially be three playable characters including Dante, with DMC 4‘s Nero being one of them. DMC 5 will also have Dante at his most serious, but will still have his verbal jabs. The game will introduce a new dynamic camera system, an improved style system that will see enemies react differently depending upon which style you’re using, and dynamic environment destruction. It won’t be an open world game, but the levels will be more expansive, similar to Dragon’s Dogma. Bosses are also a major focus of the game, with one of the boss fights moving between multiple areas. The game will also run at 60fps."
