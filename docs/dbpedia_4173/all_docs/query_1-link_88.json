        "text": "It is said that approximately two thousand years ago, in the depths of hell, a demon rose against the devil and waged a one-person struggle to defend the human world. This legend dates back approximately 2000 years.\n\nDante, who works as a private investigator of the supernatural in the current day, has recently realized that the devil is gathering his forces in preparation for another assault on humanity. Dante’s blood contains the power of ancient demons, and as his strength increases, he can turn into a demonic condition and use this ability to fight the evil he confronts.\n\nDante will begin his conflict with the demonic legions armed only with a sword and his twin pistols, Ebony and Ivory. However, as the match progresses, Dante comes into possession of more potent weapons, such as a shotgun, that will assist him in his goal. However, for Dante to defeat the devil, he must also find unique weapons possessing various elements’ powers. When properly channeled, these weapons allow Dante to call upon demonic energy and tremendous fire assaults against multiple foes."
