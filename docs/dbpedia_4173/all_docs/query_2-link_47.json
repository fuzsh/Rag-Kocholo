Clearly, I am not afraid of the dark.” - Cassandra Clare\n\n---\n\nNOTE: This blog makes use of many scans from the game Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, which were later discovered to be fabricated. While this was NOT the fault of the contributors who participated in the making of this blog, information taken from this game should be disregarded, and the verdicts considered outdated. We apologize for any confusion or misinformation this may have caused.\n\n---\n\nDante, the half-human, half-demon hunter from Devil May Cry.\n\nBayonetta, the platinum-starred angel-slaying Umbra Witch.\n\nWhen demons, angels, eldritch horrors and everything in between (so long as it's supernatural) starts to invade our planet, these two will be there to defend it from total annihilation. Armed with friends, charms, looks, and most importantly: a fuckton of weapons, they have saved the world, the universe and even the multiverse all while looking (and being) badass at it.\n\nThese two stylish demon hunters have fought before (with controversial results, depending on who you ask), but in the time since, we’ve gotten a greater look at what they can do from Devil May Cry 5, Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat, and Bayonetta 3. And so today, 7 years later, they are going to face off in a rematch for the ages. Will Dante make Cereza say hi to Lucifer once again, or will Bayonetta make this devil cry one last time? It's time to find out who would win in this DEATH BATTLE!\n\nHowever, before we get into the thick of things, we have several important notes…\n\nRegarding Hellboy VS Nero\n\nThere's an elephant in the room that we need to address, that being the Hellboy VS Nero blog from 2 years ago. That blog spread a lot farther than we were expecting it to, and it wasn't written with the expectation that it would be scrutinized as much as it was. Because of that, the wording in the blog wasn't very careful, and the links weren't triple-checked to make sure everything was airtight, which is what led to some errors like (accidental) improper scan cropping.\n\nWe want to let you know that we've heard a lot of your criticism and have done our best to work from the ground up to reevaluate everything, and make this blog as comprehensive as possible. If you're going into this with the expectation that we're just gonna shit on Dante or that you're going to need to tear apart what we say, we think you may be pleasantly surprised with what you see.\n\nMore than anything, though, our goal with this blog was that people would come away from it feeling as though Dante was given a fair shake and that both characters were treated with the respect and appreciation that they deserve. A lot of people didn't feel that with Nero, and that's definitely unfortunate. We hope this blog is a better experience for anyone who felt that way.\n\nThat being said, while we 100% are willing to listen to criticism (as this blog should demonstrate), we would also like to kindly ask that people be constructive with said critiques. It is more likely that we will listen to a point if it's directed in a tasteful manner rather than a form of name calling or passive aggressive insult. It's important to have discussions, but it's also important for said discussions to be respectful and not vitriolic.\n\nAt the end of the day these are fictional characters, and these blogs have zero stakes beyond being entertainment. We hope that anyone with any issues with our evaluations prior will at least take the time to see our new perspective.\n\nRegarding Canon and Included Media\n\nFor Dante, we will be looking at canonical Devil May Cry content, including the games, novels, anime, and guides. You can find all media used on this blog here.\n\nFor Bayonetta (We should note we're using Cereza specifically due to certain circumstances in 3), all three of her games will be used, as will all guides and the Bloody Fate film. While Bayonetta 3 implies the three main Bayonettas across the games are different, it is also specified they have similar experiences. For the purposes of this blog, they will be treated as a composite.\n\nCredits\n\nHuge Thanks to Comicygal, Senzu, and Bayonetta Minaj for assistance in acquiring access to the Bayonetta Artbooks, interviews, and other Bayonetta material. Likewise, Huge Thanks to RedReaper, Mr.Mangler, Galens, Crim and Sevil for assistance in accessing DMC content not available on Divinity Statue and for assistance with footage. You all rock!\n\nWithout further ado…\n\nBackground\n\nDante\n\n“Trish...devils never cry... These tears, tears are a gift only humans have. And we humans, never give up... are you ready?”\n\nTwo thousand years ago, a great evil turned its attention to the Human World. The Demon King Mundus decided it was time to rule over both the realm of man and demons, only to then be opposed by a lone demon warrior, Sparda. Eventually Sparda settled down with a woman named Eva, and had twin sons, Vergil and Dante. Eva was a kind and loving mother, beloved by her children and husband. Not all things last though. When the twins turned eight, Eva gave them each half of an amulet, not long after Sparda disappeared, having supposedly passed away. Taking this opportunity for revenge, Mundus’ forces came upon the family. Eva lost her life in the tragedy and the twins were separated, with Dante believing his brother had perished. Following his mother’s final instructions, Dante took up the name Tony Redgrave and hid away from the demons.\n\nAt the age of 18, Dante discovered that his brother Vergil was not only still alive, but plotting to open a passage to the Demon World their father had sealed long ago. Encountering a young woman named Mary, Dante was caught in a plot by the dark scholar, Arkham. At the behest of said scholar, he was soundly defeated by Vergil, who took his half of the amulet their mother had left them, but inadvertently awakened Dante’s full demonic abilities. Then he teamed up with Mary, renamed Lady, to stop the duo. Vergil was then betrayed by the Scholar, who wished to take Sparda’s sealed away power as his own. Both brothers together defeated Arkham, and Lady killed the mad man, who was in reality her father. Not content, Vergil dueled Dante one final time, with Dante emerging the victor. The encounter left Vergil trapped in the Demon World, while Dante returned to Earth.\n\nOver the next several years, Dante worked with other devil hunters to stop more demonic threats from the underworld, such as the Demon Kings known as Pluto and Medea. During this time, Mundus had captured Vergil and had turned him into his personal knight, Nelo Angelo. Plotting to finally finish off Sparda’s descendants and once more take over the Human World, Mundus made a demon in the visage of Eva, named Trish. Trish convinced Dante to come to Mallet Island, under the false notion of defeating her evil master.\n\nOn Mallet Island Dante faced many dangers, like the demonic weapon Nightmare and Nelo Angelo. Through his skill and show of will, Dante defeated Nelo, who exploded and was thought to have perished. Dante learned of Trish’s deceit, yet still saved her life from certain death. Trish repaid the favor, dying to save Dante from Mundus’ wrath. Fueled by anger, Dante accepted the power of his father’s sword (The Sword of Sparda) and faced off in a climactic battle with the Demonic Lord. Dante emerged victorious, and sealed Mundus away with the help of a revived Trish. Together, Trish and Dante worked from their shop, renamed “Devil Never Cry.”\n\nThe Son of Sparda soon discovered he had a nephew left by his brother Vergil on a land that Sparda once reigned over. In a mission to stop a corrupt church from abusing the power of his father, Dante discovered Nero, his nephew. Together the two took down the evils on Fortuna, and Dante reclaimed the Yamato before passing it down to Nero. Vergil, however, had not died all those years ago. He had barely survived and came back to take his old blade from his son. Using the sword, Vergil split himself into V and a demon named Urizen. Urizen would use the ancient plant called Qliphoth to gain power by consuming blood from mankind. Dante, V, and Nero tried to stop the monster, but Dante was left for dead, with V and Nero barely escaping.\n\nA month later, V awakened Dante, who then used his own blade Rebellion to fuse with the sword of Sparda. He also met Nico, granddaughter of Nell. Now at the pinnacle of his power, Dante defeated Urizen. V and Urizen merged back together into Vergil, and the two brothers set to settle the score once and for all. And after a climactic battle, it was settled not by the Sons of Sparda, but his grandson. And now the Legendary Devil Hunter is in the Demon World, bringing endless suffering to the scum of the underworld.\n\nBayonetta\n\n\"As long as there's music, I'll keep on dancing!\"\n\nLong since erased from the records of time, there once existed two European clans who served as overseers of history for the powers that be: the Umbra Witches, dwellers of the darkness, and the Lumen Sages, controllers of light. The clans paid each other great respect, and their efforts to maintain the balance between them defended the just passage of time. Yet one day, that balance was toppled. The Lumen Sages declared war against their others, the Umbra Witches. In the end all but one Lumen Sage and two Umbra Witches. For the Lumen Sages, a man by the name of Balder. For the Umbra Witches, Jeanne and her best friend Cereza.\n\nCereza was a bit special compared to other witches. She was the child of both a Lumen Sage and Umbra Witch. This unfortunately is a taboo and as such made the young Cereza an outcast. After the battle against the sages, Cereza was sealed away by Jeanne and her coffin was sent to the bottom of a lake for 500 years until she was awakened. Cereza, now going by Bayonetta, began wandering the world with amnesia, until she met the fallen angel Rodin and the informant Enzo.\n\n20 years after being awakened, she met once again with Jeanne and the two fought multiple times, until she revealed the truth to Bayonetta at Isla Del Sol. Then, they went off to defeat Father Balder, who was actually Bayonetta's father. But even after defeating him, he still had one more trick up his sleeve: reawaken Jubileus the Creator in order to unite the Trinity of Realities and allow Paradiso to rule over the universe. But through her combat prowess and Jeanne helping her to summon Queen Sheba, Bayonetta managed to kill Balder and send Jubileus hurling into the sun.\n\nAfter a long journey, Bayonetta finally fully recovered her memories and became a sort of unofficial protector for the world, eventually taking on Loptr, who sought the power of the God of Chaos Aesir, in a conflict that spanned both the past and present. And ultimately, Cereza's battles would take her to the multiverse against the artificial human Singularity, who sought to destroy and rule the entire Trinity of Reality, in a multiversal invasion that cost the lives of almost every single Bayonetta across the multiverse. Until Arch-Eve Origin Bayonetta (the Bayonetta of 3) saved them all along with the multiverse itself… at the cost of her own life, making sure Singularity went down before her.\n\nDespite this Cereza's life coming to an end, she had managed to find a worthy successor of the Bayonetta name, in her and Luka's alternate-universe daughter Viola. Though regardless of who the Bayonetta name is used by, whether it be a variant from another universe or a successor, Cereza will always be remembered as the Bayonetta who's one-of-a-kind under the moon.\n\nExperience & Skill\n\nDante\n\nDespite his overall cockiness, Dante is exceptionally skilled in combat. He is a quick learner, mastering the Devil Arms he acquires within moments of obtaining them, and quickly getting the hang of utilizing his various Styles. He is a master swordsman, proving himself superior to Sparda’s best students and being claimed to have surpassed his father as well. He is equal to his brother Vergil, who is the pinnacle of swordplay in DMC, and could match Gilver, who was able to instantly read all of Dante’s moves through analyzing them, which Dante says should be impossible.\n\nDante at age 19 was precise enough to shoot cue balls, striking all them into one another in turn tossing them into all the demons with near pinpoint accuracy. Later on in life, he managed to fight off Chen in swordsmanship, who gained the power and knowledge of the Beastheads, transferring that to experience and stealing Sparda’s sword skills. Dante fended him off with one hand, keeping up with him despite Chen’s precognition.\n\nDante has bested Mundus’ best warriors, who have hundreds years of combat experience, actively participating in a full scale war with the armies of Argosax. Dante has even defeated the former god Bolverk, who was known as Odin. Bolverk was Argosax’ most skilled fighter, as well as the rival of Sparda, and yet was completely outclassed by the pizza-loving demon hunter. Perhaps most impressively, at a young age he defeated the Black Knights with ease, said Knights being made with Sparda, Dante, and Vergil's combat data. Dante’s skills have been so honed he can sense danger off of raw reflexes and instinct alone. In his best display of skill, Dante was able to defeat Chen, who had literally absorbed all knowledge from countless timelines and was able to apply it to combat.\n\nDante has shown decent knowledge in martial arts, knowing kung fu and actively demonstrating his martial skill with Balrog. With Balrog, he displays extremely impressive break dancing styled kicks, likely Capoeira, as well as a weaving boxing fighting style with lots of jabs. Dante knows various different fighting styles,and is skilled in hand-to-hand combat, and Royal Guard is described as being Demon martial arts.\n\nHe has impressive latent abilities in acrobatics and weapon usage, as he mimicked Vergil’s style with precision, despite Trish never seeing Dante use a katana before, and has the uncanny ability to be able to use and master every weapon he comes across at a touch. He should scale above Gilver, as he’s a clone of him and Vergil, who is described to be able to seemingly absorb information from a weapon. He has a sharp mind, able to instantly understand the true power extent of Mundus' generals in the alternate universe, and the intentions of Modeus and Baal in the anime.\n\nOverall, Dante is an extremely deadly fighter who quite frankly is the peak of combat that Devil May Cry has to offer.\n\nBayonetta\n\nBefitting her overall confidence in battle, Bayonetta has proven time and time again that she’s an extremely skilled and talented combatant. She is a master with firearms as well as hand to hand combat and magic, and is also extremely skilled in fighting entire hordes of enemies at once, even going so far to mix in dancing to her fighting style to style all over her opponents. Despite this overly flashy style, Bayonetta has proven quite effective in not only confusing opponents with her bizarre movements, but overwhelming them with unconventional attacks.\n\nShe has consistently fought various high-ranking angels in her time, such as Fortitudo, Temperantia, etc. This also extends to demons such as Alraune and Phantasmaraneae (the latter of whom creates smaller demons to overwhelm its victims). However, most impressively is that she has fought the various Homunculi created by Singularity, as well as multiple gods such as Aesir and Jubileus. She has shown to be able to stay focused on her opponents even in the advent of various insane things going on around her, or being thrown at her from all sides. She is capable of dealing with Baldur, who was able to launch an attack from a satellite in space. She can keep pace with and overwhelm Jubileus, who constantly changes the battlefield to her advantage. She can fight opponents such as Aesir and Singularity, who can warp reality itself in their fights.\n\nShe can also match other Umbra Witches such as Jeanne. Unlike Bayonetta who was sealed away for 500 years and must fight based on her pure instinct, Jeanne has spent 500 years honing her skills in combat, yet Bayonetta can match her evenly in skill. This is even more absurd when you realize that Bayonetta had no actual witch training, and merely got her skills by observing other witches and training on her own. This is on top of her mastery of controlling demons with various temperaments, and summoning the ones who best counter her foes.\n\nFinally, Bayonetta is capable of keeping up with herself as well. She was able to fight one of the many versions of herself in France, not only matching her, but defeating her. She was also able to defeat that particular Bayonetta’s mother Rosa, who utilized the Umbra Clock Tower demon, which granted her tricky abilities such as teleportation and an onslaught of heavy weaponry.\n\nBayonetta’s marksmanship is notably extremely good, considering she can land multiple headshots despite attacking rapidly and at times in awkward angles, such as laying on her back on top of a moving angel. Her weapon mastery extends far beyond guns however; she is shown to immediately be able to masterfully utilize any weapon she gets her hands on. List of weapons including swords, nunchaku, whips, bows, scythes, chainsaws, yo-yos, etc. She was even able to match Singularity Definition in combat, despite it having all the data of the multiverse and the memories of all Bayonettas that have existed.\n\nOverall, Bayonetta is an extremely capable and skilled combatant who has consistently fought multiple opponents who would be far more experienced than her, matching them in skill whether they be witch, sage, angel, demon, homunculi or deity. No matter what her world throws against her, Bayonetta will always be ready to dance.\n\nEquipment\n\nDante\n\nDevil Arms\n\nDante uses a set of weapons known as “Devil Arms”, living weapons that contain the power and soul of various demons. The demons who manifest as these weapons normally need to be subdued, defeated, or convinced to help Dante of their own will before they can be wielded. Additionally, when Dante enters his Devil Trigger forms (explained below), he can harness the power of these weapons to slightly modify the physical form and abilities his Devil Trigger will take on. These weapons are incredibly powerful, and cannot be used by anyone, as if you do not have “strength” you will be swallowed by the weapon. Devil Arms can also regenerate from damage.\n\nRebellion\n\nIntroduced in Devil May Cry 2, it is Dante’s most iconic blade throughout the series to date. Given to him by his father, Sparda, it contains Sparda’s power and is the physical manifestation of Dante’s power. As such, the blade contains immense amounts of renown and might, and is one of the three most powerful blades in existence. With Rebellion, Dante can unleash a blade of air when swinging it. As the natural opposite to Yamato, it can withstand Yamato’s attacks, which are sharp enough to cut through space and dimensions. Not only that, but it also features the precise opposite of Yamato’s power of splitting Man and Demon, fusing Man and Demon. It was also the same blade that gave rise to Dante’s Devil Trigger at the age of 19, throughout the events of Devil May Cry 3.\n\nEbony & Ivory\n\nCrafted by Nell Goldstein, it’s a memento of one of Dante’s many lost mother figures. She was an incredibly gifted and skilled gunsmith, and personally made these due to the fact Dante himself breaks any normal gun he touches by firing at superhuman speeds. Ebony is his long-range arm, while Ivory is designed for quick drawing and rapid fire. They fire bullets enhanced by Demonic Energy, and the projectiles contain spirits. They have been used to seal away threats Dante himself cannot kill, such as Mundus, and are some of his most prominent handguns.\n\nDMC3 Weapons\n\nCerberus\n\nA set of nunchaku that allow Dante to utilize the power of ice for himself, it is a powerful Devil Arm that Dante used in his journey throughout the Temen-ni-gru. As it was made with the essence of the Cerberus clan, its powers over the cold should not be understated, as it was only destroyed by matching Balrog, who was amplified by a shard of Yamato after purposely training his power to defeat Argosax.\n\nAgni and Rudra\n\nTwin sets of blades that control the elements of fire and wind, capable of creating gusts of wind and infernos of flame. These winds are so great that with Rudra alone, he can create entire meteorological events such as tornadoes. On the other hand, the flames of Agni burn so brightly that they can melt even the most frigid of temperatures and burn Demons, who are naturally resistant to many forms of fire and hellfire.\n\nSeparate they are formidable, and together they are unstoppable, creating fiery whirls of destruction and amplifying their already potent destructive powers. Dante uses them both for the best and most stylish of results. Dante obtained these items in the Temen-ni-gru by defeating two Demons of the same name, and ever since then has kept the two as his own personal dispenser of both pain and justice to demons, though they occasionally talk, much to his chagrin.\n\nNevan\n\nA quite literally electric guitar, Nevan attacks and strikes with poise unmatched as it demonstrates control over lightning itself, allowing Dante to fire and summon the element as well as bats. Furthermore, this guitar is also doubling as, I kid you not, a scythe to tear into foes with gusto and deal out tons of damage at once. Nevan also has the ability to distort the space around Dante from just the sounds he plays, damaging his opponents by merely playing music, which he is quite good at doing in general thanks to his natural talent and aptitude for any act he may partake in.\n\nBeowulf\n\nBeowulf does damage with the essence of the Light Beast itself, a gauntlet and greaves set that was created by Vergil after Beowulf escaped Dante. Later on, Dante himself finds the gauntlets and uses them, utilizing his own spin on Vergil’s attacks and adding his very own, alongside his already massive arsenal of weapons makes this a fearsome weapon. As it’s made with the Lightbeast, it of course can do all sorts of light-related attacks, such as firing a blast of energy, or attacking with an aura of photons to smash Dante’s enemies into dust. In a localization of a description, it’s even said to create small supernovas.\n\nArtemis\n\nMade by the old architect of Devil Arms and Demonic Artifacts, Machiavelli, Artemis can manipulate and fire beams of light-arrows with ease and poise. One of the oldest Devil Arms ever, it is an impressive ranged weapon capable of raining from above, firing arrows directly, rapid fire and even locking on to targets. Its light beams all attack and fire however Dante desires, on as many targets as he wants. These shots are capable of doing all sorts of damage and stunning enemies, and are more than capable of dishing out destruction to rain hell upon Demon Kind. The energy beams from the weapon are made of demonic energy.\n\nSpiral\n\nA sniper Dante uses throughout the events of his older brother reviving the Demonic Tower, the Temen-ni-gru, it’s a capable firearm with high damage output. This is further amplified by Demonic Energy enhancing his attacks, making them that much more potent and that much more deadly.\n\nThe bullets from it can ricochet off of walls and hit multiple enemies, however Dante learned a skill in which he intentionally makes the bullet ricochet multiple times to pick up speed, making it more lethal.\n\nKalina Ann\n\nThe original Kalina Ann, it was given to Dante by Lady. It was named after her mother, who was slain by Arkham for power in a ritual. It's a behemoth that fires massive damage at decent speeds, and has a bayonet claw function. It does heavy damage, moves fast, and has wonderful range. Its rockets can also track enemies.\n\nPeak of Combat Weapons\n\nBlades and Guns\n\nIn Peak of Combat, Dante’s weapon selection is immense. It contains a sizable amount of different origins and abilities, all of which will be displayed here for clear use in Dante’s arsenal:\n\nFear Manipulation, Madness Manipulation, and Aura: Shadow - Madness, Awakened Thorns, Vajra Gloves, The Ripper, Vajra Gloves - Demon Blood, Crazy Blood and Bones, and the Fear Witch. Each of these have statements that mention the very aura of these weapons, merely looking at Demons, and also the presence of the weapon itself will cause fear as well as destroy the “will to fight.”\n\nSoul Manipulation, Non-Physical Interaction and Soul Absorption: Sound of the Demon, Sound of Mourning, Sound of Silence, Flaming Executioner, Evil Soul of Condensation Weeping, Sinful Soul of Condensation Light, Devil Soul of Condensation Spirit, and Doom Metal. All of these relate to the soul in some capacity, whether this be absorption, collection, or other means.\n\nMagic: All Demonic energy is referred to as magic, but also, Death Metal. A weapon that explicitly states it uses magic.\n\nMagic Absorption and Magic Empowerment: Heavy Iron Cage, Berserker Axe, Magic Pattern, The Violent, and Evil Soul of Condensation Weeping. These weapons absorb magic for power.\n\nBlood Absorption and Blood Empowerment: Withered Thorns, Greedy Thorns, Awakened Thorns, A of Hearts, Proposed - A of Spades, The Bloodstained, The Hidden One, and The Ripper. These weapons do the same, except for blood.\n\nElectricity Manipulation: Demonic Buddha's Fist - Lord, Electric Iron Fist, Electric Iron Fist - Black Blade, Electric Iron Fist - Morning Glory, and Thunder & Storm. These weapons allow Dante to utilize electricity for their respective attacks.\n\nFire Manipulation: Shadow - Dream Demon, K of Spades, Proposed - K of Spades, True - K of Hearts, Fist of Dragon Flame, Fist of Demon Flame, Fist of Sacred Flame, Searing Frost Blade, Frozen Flame Blade, Frost and Flame Blade, Asura's Red Flame, Asura's Demon Flame, and Asura's Extreme Flame. These weapons allow the use of fire for Dante’s offense, granting him that element’s benefits.\n\nHoly Manipulation: Lucia's Redemption. A Holy Weapon that can be used for more damage against Demon Kind. ,\n\nLight Manipulation: Lucia's Redemption, and Sinful Soul of Condensation Light. Grants Dante the power of light for attacks.\n\nRegeneration Negation: Goddess of Vengeance, Goddess of Wrath, Goddess of Glory. Allows Dante to negate the regeneration of Demons.\n\nIce Manipulation: Cold Roar, Extremely Cold Roar, Extremely Cold Fury, Sleeping Behemoth, Magic Edge Behemoth, Ice Cursed Behemoth, Searing Frost Blade, Frozen Flame Blade, Frost and Fire Blade, Moon of Silent Night, Moon of Cold Night, Moon of Ice Night. Weapons that give Dante the power over the cold, increasing his range of ice-based options.\n\nMind Manipulation: Flaming Inquisitor, and Eternal Heavenly Gan. More references to manipulating minds (via fragrance) or gaining a mind and then using it to judge prey.\n\nWeather Manipulation: Divine Punishment & Demonic Curse.\n\nSound Manipulation: Sound of the Demon and the Sound of Silence. Attacks via soundwaves.\n\nPurification (Type 2): Indestructible Heavenly Gan, Nirvana Heavenly Gan. Purifies the soul.\n\nMinor Transmutation: The Thousand Teeth, The Violent, The Unparalleled. Made up of Gilgamesh, which transmutes organic matter for power.\n\nSupernatural Willpower via Lucia's Redemption. Fortifies the mind.\n\nDMC1 Weapons\n\nForce Edge\n\nThe Force Edge is the dormant version of the Devil Sword Sparda. Containing a fraction of the power of Sparda, it was used by Arkham for more power and to become a Demon, but was ultimately taken by Dante and Vergil. After a final battle, Dante laid claim to this item and used it in place of Rebellion in the events of Devil May Cry 1, allowing it to be awakened into its true form. Now resides as part of Devil Sword Dante, but irregular Full Custom from Devil May Cry 5 allows Dante to use all weapons at once, and there should be no reason Dante can’t revert the blade. Force Edge homes in on opponents and can create a whirlwind when thrown.\n\nDevil Sword Sparda\n\nThe Devil Sword Sparda is the true form of the Force Edge. It grants a portion of the great Sparda’s power, and was used by Dante to achieve the Sparda Devil Trigger, a higher level of power from the normal Devil Trigger that allowed Dante to fight and defeat Mundus. It allowed Dante to fire runes, summon a dragon, and potentially resurrect the dead. This blade was also used to hold in place the sealing of Demon World, and hid Dante’s presence whilst he was in danger of being discovered. It can extend into a long spear, or take on the form of a scythe.\n\nAlastor\n\nHolding within the Spirit of Lightning, this sword amplies the user’s speed and grants them access to the power of Lightning itself. The speed amplification is enough to boost an alternate Trish to be faster than Dante himself, and grant the ability to fly. It also has the ability to fly and protect Dante on its own. Alastor can predict incoming evil to warn Dante of, even when danger is not physically approaching.\n\nIfrit\n\nA set of gauntlets and greaves much like Balrog. Ifrit has the capability to manipulate flames to an impressive level and range of ability, melting sub-Absolute Zero ice, as well as damaging those who would be traditionally resistant to flames. This is because it was imbued with the spirit of a fire-elemental demon and its attacks are charged with magical hellfire, far more intense than any natural source of flame could ever produce.\n\nThe Hellfire it produces is not to be scoffed at, and it has an ability unique to itself known as Magma Drive, a blast of intense heat that’ll turn anything it comes into contact with to ash, as well as another unique ability known as Meteor, where Dante will lob entire balls of fire at his enemies in an attempt to raze them down.\n\nGrenade Gun\n\nA Grenade Launcher that Dante has, made not only for the slaughter of demons, but also crowd control, able to detonate explosive shrapnel and reduce them all to ash. Said Grenade Gun does massive damage, more than any other normal gun Dante has outside of Lady’s pride and joy. It has a much slower reload rate and is liable to leave Dante wide open, but it’s still one of Dante’s more powerful firearms.\n\nNeedle Gun\n\nUsed for underwater combat, Dante has a Needle Gun he uses to kill those beneath the earth and plague the trenches of the deep. Outside of this, the firearm is incredibly basic, mainly assisted by the fact Dante can enhance any firearm he puts his hands on with Demonic Energy. As such, it's a mundane firearm that isn’t very notable and honestly is easily overlooked.\n\nNightmare β\n\nNightmare-β is a Devil Arm that acts like a gun, firing Demonic Energy as its form of bullets to kill and maim its targets and prey. Its projectiles have the peculiar ability to bounce off walls and ricochet towards targets or other enemies if it was to miss or hit and still continue flying. In order to function, it must drain Demonic Energy from its user, but fortunately for Dante, he’s essentially a walking endless repository of the stuff to use and manipulate for this weapon to feed on and deal damage with. It is one of the more dangerous firearms in Dante’s arsenal.\n\nDMC2 Weapons\n\nVendetta and Merciless\n\nMerciless is a sword Dante has access to in DMC2. It is weaker than Rebellion but has a much longer reach than the standard keepsake blade, and strikes moderately faster. Unlike the many weapons Dante has access to, it has no unique abilities. It is not made of a Demon, nor does it have any other redeeming qualities of its own to benefit Dante outside of looking different from his standard sword.\n\nVendetta is the polar opposite of this, being a standard sword that is stronger than Rebellion at the cost of a slower attack and smaller range. Similar to Merciless, and unlike the many weapons Dante has access to, it has no unique abilities, is not made of a Demon, nor does it have any other redeeming aspect.\n\nGuns\n\nSMGs\n\nA set of low-power but incredibly high fire-rate submachine guns. They hit rapidly, faster than most can respond to, and as such easily make up for their lack of damage by stacking damage.\n\nShotgun/Coyote-A\n\nAn ordinary shotgun that Dante uses to kill low-level demons throughout the first few Devil May Cry games. After some time, Dante eventually modified the shotgun and renamed it Coyote-A. Coyote-A is a heavily modified firearm made specifically for causing the demise of the hordes of hellspawn, doing far more damage than Ebony and Ivory.\n\nMissile Launcher\n\nA high power Missile Launcher that fires slowly. Similar to the Grenade Launcher, but with missiles. While it has low accuracy and slow movement, it has absurdly high firepower, giving even greater crowd control. Besides, who says a Devil Hunter can’t have fun while on the job?\n\nBeryl’s Anti-Tank Rifle\n\nThis firearm absorbs and destroys the bonds of magic as well as magic itself with Anti-Magic bullets. Dante himself says that being touched by them would likely remove his superhuman abilities; this effect can even create vortexes that absorb and destroy magic. Dante was given this weapon by Beryl after the events of Vol. 2, so he should be able to use this weapon in combat.\n\nDMC4 Weapons\n\nGilgamesh\n\nMade by a material that transmutes organic matter for power, Gilgamesh is used by Dante after defeating Echidna. It obviously amplifies the strength of a user’s blows, and can be amplified an extra layer further through the engines that exist on it for extra oomph. It dishes out slower attacks, but it’s clearly worth it given the level of extra firepower it allows Dante to deal. It also has some extra range with the drills and saws on the arms and legs respectively.\n\nLucifer\n\nLucifer is a Devil Arm that maintains endless explosive lightsaber-like swords that Dante can freely manipulate through positioning and placing them around the battlefield, to set up and dish out intense and crazy amounts of damage at once in one big and satisfying finish. There is no set limit to the number he can manifest, which he can detonate with a clap or the toss of a rose.\n\nPandora\n\nAn all-you-can-kill buffet, as this weapon turns into six hundred and sixty six different weapons with their own ways to deal damage. Currently only seven are known. Formations 13 (Epidemic), 124 (Hatred), 262 (Jealousy), 398 (Revenge), 422 (Grief), 594 (Argument), and 666 (Omen). They range from missile launchers, a minigun, a giant laser cannon, a super mega beyblade, a moving missile vehicle, and a massive flash of light. Made by Machiavelli, the same man who made Artemis, it’s the most versatile weapon in his arsenal.\n\nPF013: Epidemic: Turns Pandora into a blowgun, though it looks more like a small missile launcher to us.\n\nPF125: Hatred: Turns Pandora into a bazooka. Projectiles from said bazooka can reduce enemies to ashes.\n\nPF398: Revenge: Turns Pandora into a laser cannon.\n\nPF262: Jealousy: Turns Pandora into a gatling gun.\n\nPF594: Argument: Turns Pandora into a small vehicle capable of firing a multitude of homing missiles (up to 14).\n\nPF422: Grief: Turns Pandora into a triple-bladed shuriken-esque boomerang. It always comes back to Dante, but will seek out any opponent he locks onto.\n\nPF666: Omen: Dante opens the suitcase creating a blast of light that damages all surrounding enemies in a large explosion.\n\nYamato\n\n(Note: Dante is only getting a fragment of Yamato, read below for info)\n\nYamato is one of the three swords Sparda split his power into, so it’s natural Dante had access to this weapon himself. Its power is so immense, holding unimaginable power in even only splinters. Its fragments are still sharp and powerful enough to pierce the boundaries between worlds. It can slice through dimensions and space, thus ignoring conventional durability (it cuts through both matter and space-time) and can separate “Power from Heart” and Man from Devil. In the process, it split off the memories of Vergil’s enslavement and created V, as well as his familiars. It revived Nero, giving him more power and access to his father’s Summoned Swords. It can also be used to cut off the Human World from that of the Demons, and can allow transport between them via cutting space and creating portals even after the realms had been locked by Sparda.\n\nIt also was able to separate Nero from the Savior, which was a being made of melded-together spirit and demon matter. Dante notes that Nero’s body would have been dissolved, to such a degree Nero lost his memories and ability to think clearly. Vergil and Urizen also once used the sword to create a barrier.\n\nWhile Dante no longer has the blade, he still has a shard of it he used to escape the Demon World, and Yamato was a part of his standard arsenal throughout the events of Devil May Cry 4, like many of his other one time game specific weapons. When Dante wielded it, he could send attacks that cut through dimensional barriers, which he used to cut a Hell Gate, and use the Dark Slayer fighting style.\n\nDMC5 Weapons\n\nDouble Kalina Ann\n\nA pair of rocket launchers that Dante obtained from Lady and the granddaughter of the best weaponsmith in the modern era, Nell Goldstein, Nico Goldstein. The original Kalina Ann was already a monstrous force, but this is its power times two. The Kalina Ann II is identical to the Kalina Ann in every way, meant to serve as a replacement, but when put together a secret mechanism activates that allows Dante to fire them as a laser of death.\n\nCavaliere/Cavaliere R\n\nMotorcycle buzzsaw combo weapon. It is as cool as it sounds. With it, Dante shreds through armor, shields, flesh, anything really. It’s a damage-dealing set of weapons that rank among the most stylish and crazy weapons in gaming history.\n\nKing Cerberus\n\nA Multiform weapon that uses ice, fire, and lightning in the form of triple Nunchaku, Bō Staff, and a Sansetsukon. Described by Nico as the upgrade to the original Cerberus from Devil May Cry 3, Dante gained it from slaying the leader of the Cerberus clan. If the original Cerberus can match a Yamato amped and trained Balrog who specifically aimed to defeat Argosax, imagine what his King can do.\n\nDr. Faust\n\nA Devil Arm made by Nico based on her father’s research; fires crystallized demon blood like bullets. It is also stylish as hell and can invoke the most amazing dance ever. With it, Dante can place hats on targets and pull them towards himself, and create a protective shell of crystals that attack enemies that get too close. The Hat itself can also attack enemies for Dante, and can fire crystallized blood meteors. By sacrificing Red Orbs, Dante can increase the damage it causes, to the point it is the second most powerful attack in DMC5’s gameplay.\n\nBalrog\n\nBalrog is a set of gauntlets and greaves that attack and damage with the hottest fires of Hell, more intense than even the great demon Berial’s flames. These hell flames damage on a level that completely eliminates Demons like the Fury. The greaves allow for great evasion and punishing blows, with fierce and powerful attacks that can also be separated into two categories, these being Kick Mode and Blow Mode.\n\nWith Kick Mode Dante attacks with much more swift leg-based attacks, and Blow Mode is more focused on punches that hit incredibly hard. Dante gained this weapon shortly before the start of Devil May Cry 5, and did so after defeating an Yamato-amped Balrog—the left hand of Argosax—who specifically trained his power to defeat his previous master.\n\nDevil Sword Dante\n\nDevil Sword Dante is the representation of Dante’s power, his very being placed into a blade that truly represents the merging of his humanity and demonic nature. This blade is composed of both the Devil Sword Sparda and the Rebellion, Dante’s keepsake sword from his father. It has great power, created by Rebellion’s ability to merge Man and Devil.\n\nIt was made and forged from Dante’s own body after absorbing the Rebellion and Sparda blades and turned into a new Weapon entirely, granting him a new Sword Formation ability, and his newest Devil Trigger state, Sin Devil Trigger. Dante can materialize this weapon wherever and whenever he wants. It also has a will of its own, using the Sword Formation ability to back up Dante offensively and defensively.\n\nSword Formation\n\nSword Formation is a move that summons glowing red swords similar to Vergil's Summoned Swords, which enhance Dante's capabilities. The swords will copy Dante's melee moves, dealing extra damage and sometimes having unique effects, such as Balrog's kick-launcher Updraft now kicking the enemy into a persistent spinning sword-wheel that forms in mid-air. They can even be used as a shield and detect nearby threats, slashing automatically to keep them at bay. They can even be fired as beyblades.\n\nStars/Consumables\n\nVital Star\n\nThe Vital Star is a green star-shaped stone made through alchemy, and heals the user so that they may be at peak performance. These come in three different sizes, Small, Medium, and Large, and these Stars are able to repair any injury, no matter how grevious. Green Orbs also achieve the same.\n\nDevil Star\n\nThe Devil Star is a purple star-shaped stone made through alchemy, and restores as well as grants the user Demonic Energy, being both a magic refill as well as a method of granting beings temporary access to a limited variant of the powers Dante possesses. White Orbs also achieve the same.\n\nGold Orbs\n\nYellow Orbs and Gold Orbs are magical yellow and gold stones created through a secret alchemical process. They revive the user from the dead, allowing anyone to cheat the inevitable to live a second time without consequence.\n\nHoly Star\n\nThe Holy Star is a blue star-shaped stone filled with divine blessings, and will cure the user of any and all ailments.\n\nUntouchable\n\nThe Untouchable is a yellow star-shaped stone that grants the user complete and total invulnerability as well as infinite Demonic Energy for a limited amount of time. The period of time is unknown, but is quite brief.\n\nSmell of Fear\n\nThe Smell of Fear is a pink vial that grants the user a three-hit shield that protects them from damage. It’s a useful thing to have in a pinch and honestly doesn’t add much to Dante’s arsenal outside of a little extra protection alongside his other defensive measures.\n\nHoly Water\n\nHoly Water is a vial of divinely-blessed water, used by Dante for insta-killing Demons, or highly damaging those that don’t die. These waters do massive damage to all Demons, except those like Dante because of his human heritage blocking his weakness, even if he uses them while in Devil Trigger.\n\nArtifacts\n\nBangle of Time\n\nAn item likely made by Sparda, as it was a memento of Eva, his wife. It can completely stop time, but drains the user’s Demonic Energy to function, yet it’s worth it. It even functions on Demons that function normally in the Demon World’s incoherent time flow. It has the power of Za Warudo!\n\nThe Perfect Amulet\n\nThe Perfect Amulet is an artifact Dante gains after he defeats Nelo Angelo, who is his brother after having his existence warped by Mundus. It is the unification of two halves, as Eva split this Amulet in two and gave it to her twin sons on their eighth birthday. This was originally the key of the Temen-ni-gru, alongside the Force Edge, that sealed the worlds apart from one another, using the power of Sparda.\n\nHowever, Dante himself uses this Amulet to freely travel between these two realms. Whilst it’s unclear if the Perfect Amulet became apart of the Devil Sword Sparda due to the cutscene inconsistencies of Devil May Cry 1, Dante is able to use it as a separate object and ability regardless, and he clearly still has it by Devil May Cry 2’s Novel, which takes place significantly after the death of Mundus.\n\nThe Amulet\n\nThe Amulet is a powerful artifact Dante uses throughout the events of Devil May Cry 2, which allows him to imbue all attacks with fire, ice, or lightning elements, fly, stop time, and increase speed as well as power output. The Amulet functions with “Hearts”, with each Heart granting their own effect:\n\nChronoheart: The ability to stop time.\n\nHealing Heart: Improved regenerative capacity.\n\nOffense Heart: Amplifies Dante’s damage output by two times.\n\nQuick Heart: Amplifies Dante’s speed by ten times.\n\nAerial Heart: Allows the user to fly\n\nFrost Heart: Applies ice element into attacks\n\nFlame Heart: Applies fire element into attacks\n\nElectro Heart: Applies lightning element into attacks\n\nAqua Heart: Improves movement capacity in water.\n\nThe Book of Demons\n\nThe Book of Demons is the most powerful artifact in Dante’s possession, as it allows the user to absorb and seal souls, or parts of souls all creatures have and turn them into data, granting the user all of the powers of those stored inside. This grants Dante a lot of extra firepower, as he gains a massive amount of powers to utilize for himself, and grows that power list by using the Book of Demons to gain more souls. Simply battling a Demon is enough for the book to engrave a piece of their soul, as the book made a page for Pluto and Faye despite both escaping right before Dante could kill them.\n\nCreated by Matriarch Matilda as one of six artifacts to hold the power of a great demon king, the book was retrieved from the Temen-ni-gru and has its own consciousness. It chose Dante to be its wielder, and only will accept those who can resist its power. This means that, as such, Dante should have access to the collective powers of the Demons sealed inside the Book of Demons, and any Dante should add into its pages. The book has been sought after by numerous demonic and human entities for its otherworldly powers and properties, once even being used to perform miracles.\n\nSoul Complexity\n\nThis application of the book is rather consistent, given that absorbing a soul can give you its power in Devil May Cry. As mentioned before, the Soul in DMC is a bit abstract in nature. Souls in Devil May Cry are composed of many abstract and essential aspects, these being power, the abstract essence of one’s existence, (altogether being their) Name, something which is only a portion of the Soul. The Soul itself is also made of other aspects, such as their mind, memory, the information of their body, and the information of their ancestors.\n\nThis “principle” predates the creation of the Demonic World, with Names being so important that Demons mold their powers after them, which is in line with the fact one’s mind is integral to the results of one’s Demonic Power, something that is echoed in Devil May Cry 5 not once, but twice.\n\nCover Functions\n\nDante can place pages of the book on it as a cover to give him bonuses. For example, choosing Pluto as the cover demon, allows you to put more runes in the book. This applies to all Superbosses. Selecting a book’s passive by choosing the boss grants you bonus effects:\n\n[5] Phantom: Reduce Damage from mobs by 5%\n\n[5] Nevan: Increase Damage of long range attacks by 10%\n\n[4] Minotaur: Reduce Damage from Bosses by 5%\n\n[5] Beowulf: Increased Damage by 5%\n\n[7] Plutone: Increase Critical hit rate by 10%\n\n[7] Faye: Increase Critical Hit damage by 10%\n\n[] Indicates how many runes you can place in the slots of the book.\n\nRunes\n\nThe book can also break seals, and has slots for Runes to amplify Dante’s powers a level further. Runes were built off ancient tablets from the Demon World representing Chaos, Darkness, and Void. The effects of the Runes range from buffs to physical attacks, ranged attacks, regen, Devil Trigger duration, increased defenses, and improves the functionality of Green Orbs/healing items. All runes collected here.\n\nAn example of a more specific rune is the Rune of the Demon King, a rune that can increase a character's damage against boss-type demons, created by an ancient priestess who received revelations from several ancient holy tablets. The Demon Servant Rune is a rune that increases a character's damage against non-boss type demons, and the Elemental Rune increases the damage of a character's attributes.\n\nPage Abilities\n\nAlso, since it manipulates the individual aspects of the soul, the Book itself (without accounting for Demons inside) grants Dante:\n\nSealing and Sealing Negation (For being able to seal Demon soul/soul pieces and being able to break seals)\n\nInformation Analysis (The book provides information on each Demon it gains a page of)\n\nPower Absorption (Via absorbing the power of the trapped soul)\n\nData Manipulation (The book integrates the soul as data)\n\nSoul Manipulation (Self explanatory, absorbs souls)\n\nMind Manipulation (The mind is an aspect of the soul in DMC)*\n\nMemory Manipulation (Memory is part of the soul)*\n\nInformation Manipulation (The soul all the information of the body and its ancestors since ancient times, which the book has access to)*\n\nEssence Manipulation (Via the abstract nature of names, which is part of demon souls in DMC)*\n\n* Indicates that these applications of the soul are exclusive to Devil May Cry. That said, it should be applicable to affecting the equivalents in other verses if the characters cannot resist its effects.\n\nAs well as the Absorption of those essential aspects (which is all of the listed things except Sealing and Sealing Negation).\n\nThe Demons inside the Book of Demons are cataloged here. Abilities the book gives from Demons include:\n\nRegeneration: All but the weakest Demons are capable of regenerating from losing all of their essential aspects, making them nigh-unkillable as they continually get up and continue the fight. Time-frame isn't specified.\n\nSoul Manipulation: Many Demons are capable of attacking the Soul.\n\nPossession: Numerous Demons, including Greed, are capable of possessing inanimate objects by projecting their consciousness across the Demon World to the Human World. Demons can also possess corpses.\n\nVariations of Immortality: From Demon Physiology, as Demons don’t age and can regenerate from injuries normally fatal to others. Some Demons can resurrect as a new Demon in the form of their soul and rage. Mourning Banshee can return from death immediately if even one single aspect of its prey remains. Banshee is shown to return after Dante kills it the first time, reappearing about 1 minute after death, with Dante commenting on its return.\n\nCurse Manipulation, Death Manipulation, Healing: From the Devil Choir/Angel of Damnation, which can place and remove curses, ranging from healing to death spells.\n\nSound Manipulation: From the Mourning Banshee, as it attacks via sonic screams.\n\nAir, Weather, and Lightning Manipulation: From Griffon and Nevan, who can manipulate lightning, air, and general weather phenomena.\n\nAbsolute Zero: The Frosts attack at temperatures below/beyond absolute zero.\n\nIce Manipulation: From Cerberus and Frost. It can be used for teleports, ice-based regeneration, and weapons for the Frost, with general ice manipulation for Cerberus\n\nRage Power: From Minotaur, who can enhance his strength through rage.\n\nFire Manipulation: From Faye and Phantom, both of which can manipulate flames.\n\nPrecognition, Retrocognition, and Cosmic Awareness: From the Conundrum, which can view the past, the present, countless futures, even ones considered impossible, and across dimensions as well as space-time continuums, as its eye perceives those within the Demon World, Human World, and “Beyond” at once (refer here to how timelines in DMC work). This doesn’t affect those who are among Demon Kings, but Dante has interacted with a similar power in the form of the Beastheads, which do.\n\nDemonic Influencing: The Fallen Priest can influence other Demons to fight by its side.\n\nResurrection/Necromancy/Summoning: Demons like Phantom can resurrect spirits of the dead for attacks, turning them into columns of fire, as well as Pluto, who can summon the dead.\n\nShapeshifting/Body Control: From Nevan, Frost, Griffon, and Demon Physiology. Nevan and Griffon can turn themselves into lightning, Frost can turn into an ice vapor to teleport, and most demons can control their bodies to make weapons.\n\nExistence Erasure: The Fallen Priest can erase every aspect of a Demon from existence, including their Soul, which includes their name, mind, and memory.\n\nHoming Attacks: From Beowulf, as well as Pluto.\n\nForcefield Creation: From Pluto, who has a forcefield that absorbs damage for him before exploding when it’s limit is reached.\n\nRage Power: From Minotaur, who can enhance his strength through rage.\n\nVoid Manipulation: From Faye, who can use the power of the Void to “bypass all defenses.” as well as create portals.\n\nEnergy Manipulation: From Faye, who can fire lasers.\n\nAnti-Magic Defenses: From Phantom, whose body is naturally covered in an Anti-Magic exoskeleton that makes it virtually impenetrable to magical attacks.\n\nTemporal resistance: All Demons can naturally exist without worry in an incoherent time flow\n\nSpace-Time Manipulation: From Pluto, who can manipulate space and time with his Abyssal Spear. This is also presumably the same Spear that separated the realms in alternate translations of the Devil May Cry 3 Prequel Manga (see q/a), which he also uses in Peak of Combat to create a hole in reality. It’s also stated that Faye manipulates Space. Dante gains access to the Abyssal Spear via a Devil Card, which whilst only a bonus attack in gameplay, does mean that for all intents and purposes he has the powers of Pluto and the Abyssal Spear (more on that below).\n\nDevil Cards\n\nNext are devil cards that Dante collects when finishing quests/missions in Peak of Combat. Devil Cards are gifts from the Demon World and are tied to the Book of Demons, which acts as a bestiary of the demons listed on the cards. Dante can attach these to his weapons for bonus effects. He can “limit break” these cards and increase their max level by fusing the same Devil Card with itself or using magic crystals.\n\nList of available Devil Cards and their effects. Superboss Devil Cards allow Dante to summon an attack from said boss, such as summoning electric bats from Nevan. The boss cards are listed below:\n\nPluto/Abyssal Spear\n\nMentioned beforehand, the Abyssal Spear is the Weapon of the God of Evil known as Pluto. It grants Pluto control over space and time and can be used to travel through dimensions. Dante gains access to this weapon in the form of a Devil Card, which allows Dante (or Vergil and Lady in gameplay) to summon the spear above his opponents for a surprise attack. At any time, the user of the spear can call it to themselves in case it is removed from their grasp. In conjunction with the piece of Pluto’s soul in the Book of Demons (when used as the cover) grants Dante access to Pluto’s abilities alongside the Spear’s benefits. These abilities include:\n\nTime-Space Imprisonment: Releases a time-space deceleration ball, which forms a time-space deceleration force field when it hits the target, slowing down the movement of enemies within range.\n\nCelestial Fall of the Hundred Blades: Projects the demonic Abyssal Spear over the enemy's head and continuously attacks them downward. It is stated that thousands of spears can be dropped from this move.\n\nEternal Silence of the Galaxy: Rains starlight down on the area, continuously striking enemies within range.\n\nSkybreaker: The user projects the Abyssal Spear above themself, constantly tracking the enemy's position and waiting for an opportunity to attack.\n\nDarkness Forever: Expands out a forcefield, which absorbs some of the damage taken, and shatters when it exceeds the limit.\n\nFaye\n\nFaye is the demon daughter of a member of the Guardian Clan. Her full demonic side was exposed by the Demon Queen, Medea. The Book of Demons recorded an entry for Faye after Dante battled her twice. Faye is usable as a Cover for the book, and as such is open to ability usage in the same fashion as Pluto. Faye can control demons against their will. Her moveset description will be listed below:\n\nPhase Leap: Faye opens two portals by channeling the power of the void, nullifying all types of enemy defenses through the movement of phases.\n\nNight Walk on the Deserted River: Faye jumps up and then quickly dives down to trample the floor, the force of ten thousand pounds of her descent can cause the ground to shake.\n\nSpinning Radiation: Faye fires multiple beams of laser light through her magical wings, the enemies she hits will be left with no bones.\n\nLaw of Thunderstorm: Faye wraps herself in lightning and spins herself around quickly, the powerful traction force will crush and grind everything nearby into powder immediately.\n\nBurning Karmic Fire: Faye gathers a huge fireball and detonates it, the embers from the impact will burn up everything around it\n\nBeyond this, Faye can control the weather and make flame tornadoes and flaming meteorites, trap enemies in water to suffocate them, and control ice in different ways like an ice ground pound (full fight linked).\n\nNevan\n\nNevan’s devil card spawns electric bats in combat to assist Dante. Her cover in the book. Her moveset below:\n\nShadow Bat Shield: The bat family members loyal to Nevan are transformed into shields to protect Nevan and take some of the damage for her. When the shield is broken, Nevan will be weakened and unable to move for a period of time.\n\nBat Ray: Nevan gathers the magical power of lightning into a ball and constantly shoots it at the enemy, or chasing it like a bat.\n\nThunder Dance: Nevan turns lightning into a sharp blade with a spinning dance, and slices enemies who dare to approach.\n\nBat Light Blade: Nevan unleashes three blades of bat light in front of her, and the sharp blades will cut enemies in two.\n\nPhantom Lightning Formation: Nevan summons thunder and lightning to form a phantom thunderstorm, which can confuse the enemy and easily penetrate the target.\n\nVoltaic Curtain: Nevan will weave lightning and spread it like a curtain on the ground. The lightning will flow over the enemy and paralyze them.\n\nBeowulf\n\nDante can use the abilities of Beowulf via its devil card. The card increases physical based damage Dante deals out. Its book cover. It's moveset is:\n\nMeteor Shower: Beowulf gathers the magic of light into his legs and continuously stomps on the ground while releasing his magic, continuously hitting the enemies within range.\n\nStacked Light Storm: Beowulf collects the magic of light in his throat, and releases it in an instant after overlapping and increasing continuously, the power is enough to pierce everything he sees.\n\nWings of Light・Explosion: Beowulf explodes with the power of his wings of magical light, and enemies who dare to approach him will be knocked away.\n\nWings of Light・Magic Vector: Beowulf will converge magic power to the wings of magic light, which become multiple magic vectors to track and strike the enemies.\n\nSteel Cage: Beowulf's powerful force will shake down the cages inside the sacred cage, and the cage shaped like a bronze bell, is strong enough to break the bones of inexperienced demon hunters under the impetus of Beowulf's strange power.\n\nMinotaur\n\nDante can use the abilities of Minotaur via its devil card. The card increases thunder based damage Dante deals out. Its cover in the book. It's moveset is:\n\nPunching For The Top: Minotaur slams both fists to the ground and assumes a charging stance, concentrating his power in his legs, then releasing it in one breath and charging at the enemy.\n\nBrute Force Heavy Throw: Minotaur tries to grab the enemy, then slams it to the ground with enough force to crush tenacious right.\n\nRaging Rage: Minotaur builds up his magic power to strengthen himself, and at the end of the attack, he explodes into a frenzy and enters a rage state, greatly increasing his attack power.\n\nMeteor Rift: Minotaur leaps forward and then throws a series of punches like a meteor shower, with enough force to crack the Earth.\n\nDust Obliterator: Minotaur uses his heavy body to lunge at the enemy, his huge body is enough to make the enemy have nowhere to run.\n\nPeak Fall: Minotaur's body leans back, his heavy body is like a mountain collapsing, crushing the enemy behind him.\n\nCerberus\n\nDante can use the abilities of Cerberus via its devil card. The card increases ice-based damage Dante deals out. It's moveset is:\n\nSeadrift Jet Stream: The cold air is gathered in front of Cerberus, which then forms a number of jets upwards to repel the enemies above.\n\nIce Spike: Each of the three heads of Cerberus shoots dry ice spikes forward, attacking enemies in a fan-shaped area.\n\nThousand Mile Freeze: Cerberus gathers ice magic in his front claws and slaps them to the ground, forming a line of ice spikes to strike enemies.\n\nAbsolute Zero: Each of the three heads of Cerberus releases an icy breath that can frostbite and even freeze enemies.\n\nIce Age: The Ice Age is a momentary release of the ice magic power accumulated by Cerberus, and the resulting ice shock is enough to frostbite the enemy.\n\nGriffon\n\nDante can use the abilities of Griffon via its devil card. The card increases lightning-based damage Dante deals out. It's moveset is:\n\nDouble Thunder Break: Griffon unleashes a ball of lightning that lands and forms two pulsing lightning bolts that penetrate the enemy in the middle.\n\nThunderlock Rampage: Griffon hovers in the air and then swoops to the center of the field, spreading multiple pulses of lightning in all directions and trapping the enemy. The lightning then converges and strangles the enemy.\n\nMillions of Thunderstorms: Griffon rises into the air and releases lightning balls to continuously bombard ground targets.\n\nClaw Attack: Griffon rises into the air and locks onto the target, then quickly uses his claws to tear down the enemy.\n\nRush: When Griffon is on the ground, he locks onto his target and quickly charges, trampling enemies in his path.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThe Secret Key of Space Time\n\nAn item from Peak of Combat, it is a key that allows Dante to access new areas that are locked spatially.\n\nDemon Vessel\n\nA vessel that can temporarily trap a demon’s soul, it is used by the Demon Hunters Guild.\n\nGolden Soul Stone\n\nA mysterious stone with the power to resurrect the dead. Can be obtained in Peak of Combat.\n\nBayonetta\n\nUmbran Watch\n\nSaid to represent the \"heart\" of an Umbra Witch, an Umbran Watch is what grants Bayonetta and other Umbra Witches their abilities, everlasting life, and maintains the contract with Inferno. It can even preserve a host's body for a small period of time should they be killed in battle like with Jeanne, allowing for someone else to retrieve their soul from Inferno to revive them, given their soul returns within the given time limit.\n\nHowever, if the Umbran Watch is sufficiently damaged, it will weaken Bayonetta considerably for a moment. And if the Umbran Watch is destroyed, then she will not only lose her powers, but also her ability to keep Umbran Demons under her control, which can (and has) lead to a fatal end for her. Though thankfully for Cereza, it takes a lot to even damage an Umbran Watch, let alone destroy it, with Singularity Definition being the only foe Bayonetta has fought who's capable of performing such a feat.\n\nBayo 1 Weapons\n\nScarborough Fair\n\nBayonetta’s default guns in Bayonetta 1, which push her magic to their limits and are durable enough to channel even the Wicked Weaves. The individual names of each handgun are Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme. They can also load lipstick for a good headshot. Its shots are capable of ricocheting off walls.\n\nBullet Climax: Bayonetta stands motionless and concentrates on aiming on enemies and objects around her. She can easily hit targets all her sides and above her without changing her foot stance with little difficulty.\n\nCharge Modifier: Causes Scarborough Fair to fire off 5 shots rapidly in a row, allowing Bayonetta to stack up damage.\n\nHandguns\n\nA couple of basic human guns from Rodin that Bayonetta usually uses prior to obtaining her primary four-set pistols for a game. While she does see them as \"cheap toys\", they do manage to get the job done for kicking fresh angel ass… for a bit at least, hence the label she gave them. Unlike Bayonetta's more iconic weapons, the handguns weren't made to handle the power of her Bullet Arts, so she has to be careful in using them. Heck, she broke an entire casket worth of handguns in one of the first fights we see her in.\n\nOnyx Roses\n\nShotguns that contain the souls of fairies. Each shot from these guns contains a curse from the trapped fairies’ souls. With the Charge Modifier, Bayonetta can charge the shots from the Onyx Roses, which results in the rapid firing of several shots in a row. Bullets released from the weapon during a charge attack can bounce off solid substances once or twice.\n\nShuraba\n\nA living katana containing the heart of the Demon God of War, Asura. The blade is constantly seeking out the blood of its victims, and can even suck out their souls upon defeat. When equipped, Bayonetta’s Wicked Weave punches take on the form of giant spectral blades, and she can charge up her attacks to unleash massive slashes.\n\nMoonlight Massacre is a special attack Bayonetta can perform with Shuraba, where she draws a demonic seal in front of her with the blade and then slashes through it, unleashing a red energy beam at full charge.\n\nKulshedra\n\nA possessed whip that contains the soul of the ancient serpentine demon Kulshedra. The power of Kulshedra is channeled from its hilt. Bayonetta will generally spin Kulshedra around and thrust it upwards in a spiral, causing damage to everything around her and above her. The long reach of the whip makes it ideal for crowd control.\n\nDurga\n\nA pair of claws that contains the soul of the thousand armed demon Durga. One controls lightning, and the other controls fire. Equipping Durga provides Bayonetta with one major benefit: resistance to the corresponding attribute. For example, a flaming Durga can deal normal damage to flaming enemies that normally cannot be attacked directly, and a flaming Durga on the feet allows Bayonetta to walk through lava fields with ease. These weapons also imbue Bayonetta’s Wicked Weaves with their respective elemental attributes when equipped.\n\nOdette\n\nA pair of bladed skates that contain the soul of the Demon Witch, Odette. Using the power of Odette allows Bayonetta to call upon the power of ice. These skates can freeze enemies upon contact and increase Bayonetta’s mobility by allowing her to skate around a battlefield at high speeds instead of running. Frozen opponents can be thrown through the use of Bayonetta’s Wicked Weaves. Also grants resistance to ice based attacks and environments.\n\nLt. Col. Kilgore\n\nContaining the soul of the Vietnam War Madman Lt. Col. Kilgore, these launch explosive shells with incredible magical power. Bayonetta can also use them like a pair of tonfas for melee attacks.\n\nSai Fung\n\nThese nunchaku contain the soul of the fastest bird in all of Inferno. Attacks from these weapons are so fast that even a god couldn’t keep up with them. These nunchaku are also able to attack from a distance due to being containing a gun barrel.\n\nBazillions\n\nFour guns created by an unknown super-civilization. They’re powered by an energy source called Bazillionium, with their shots being able to instantly break down the molecular bonds of their target and possibly even having the power to open a portal to another dimension. Through Rodin’s tinkering, the guns have also gained demonic powers. They can fire both large laser beams and smaller, more compact shots.\n\nUmbran Sisters\n\nMagical weapons used for the Bullet Arts. While resembling flintlock pistols, they’ve been used long before humans invented said weaponry. The Umbra Sisters are designed to fully exploit their user's magical abilities in both melee and long-range. Bayonetta used these weapons in the past, functioning similarly to her modern-day guns in terms of combat application.\n\nRodin\n\nMysterious bracelets once used by the fallen angel and main man himself, Rodin, in holding dominion over a portion of Paradiso. The bracelets adapt themselves to the user’s power and memories, offering unstoppable supernatural power and allowing the bracelets to take the form of many different weapons. These weapons include a double bladed axe, a flaming flail, a hammer, a gun, a harp bow, claws, wheels, chainsaws and a trumpet capable of firing orbs of energy, essentially acting as an entire arsenal packed into just one weapon.\n\nWith Rodin, Bayonetta can use Sloth's swords, which can awaken feelings of gluttony, profanity, doubt, idiocy, rage, and arrogance when cutting the target. It also allows her to summon Enrapture's staff, which can absorb energy from nearby targets. Rodin can thrust out a shield that emits a shockwave that knocks enemies back, transform into the whip dropped by Resentment, and increase Bayo’s damage output by 20%.\n\nPillow Talk\n\nThis lightsaber is a vessel for Mahavairocana, a demon who seduced women by messing with their dreams. Due to Rodin's conjuring, the demonic power this weapon summons is incredibly potent at killing angels, used for slicing straight through enemies.\n\nAngel Arms\n\nThese weapons originally belonged to the angels of Paradiso (until Bayonetta killed all of them). The weapons range from staves, chain blades that can morph into a bow, a sword, trumpets that shoot energy, and staffs that can steal life energy. Though powerful, these weapons are very temporary, and can only be used a limited number of times before dissipating.\n\nBayo 2 Weapons\n\nLove is Blue\n\nBayonetta’s default handguns in Bayonetta 2. Individually, their names are Prelude, Minuet, Toccata and Nocturne. These weapons are comparable to Scarborough Fair in terms of control and power, and are used in a similar way. Alongside their default melee and ranged uses in combat, they can also summon Wicked Weaves and allow Bayonetta to use the Umbran Climax, which uses the user’s stored magic power to greatly enhance their abilities.\n\nRakshasa\n\nA pair of swords which absorbed the demon god Rakshasa and subsequently were cleansed with Soma. As Rakshasa's chakra flows into the wielder, they are easy for Bayonetta to use on both hands and legs. Rakshasa transforms Bayonetta’s Wicked Weaves into giant swords.\n\nAlruna\n\nA whip containing the soul of the demon Alraune, which slithers as if it were alive. Any who hear the crack of the whip will feel Alraune whisper a curse in their ears.\n\nTouching the vines fills the victim’s mind with cursed screams that instantly drives them mad. The whip also has poison laced into it, from the demon it was born from, enhancing its effectiveness. This poison can cause death and affect the very soul.\n\nKafka\n\nA bow and arrow made from a man who became a hideous insect, very subtle with the reference. Despite being made into a weapon, the man is still alive as the bow’s frame and launches venomous bugs as projectiles. When in use, Bayonetta’s Wicked Weaves become giant dragonflies that fire like poisonous arrows.\n\nChernobog\n\nA scythe containing souls captured by the god of death Chernobog. Rodin restored this scythe back to its former glory with a new set of souls. Those cut by its three blades have their wounds infected by darkness, and their souls rots and falls to the bottom of Inferno. Moreso, it seals the souls of its victims within itself. Its Wicked Weaves become giant sweeping scythes when in use.\n\nUndine\n\nTwo flamethrowers containing the soul of Undine, who committed suicide after a failed relationship. Undine's jealousy manifests as searing flames, granting Bayonetta the ability to manipulate powerful flames to burn her opponents to ash, while her breath of lament grants the ability to manipulate ice that can freeze any foe in their tracks, allowing these weapons to serve a dual purpose.\n\nTakemikazuchi\n\nA giant hammer forged from the thunder god Takemikazuchi's divine sword, the Futsuno-mitama. Rodin rebuilt it into a hammer to suit his tastes, with a single swing from it being enough to split the heavens and cause the earth to tremble. While the hammer is extremely heavy, its sheer power allows it to break the guard and armor of any opponent, zap opponents with lightning and stun enemies with shockwaves.\n\nSalamandra\n\nChainsaws that are made up of every single part of the infernal dragon, Salamandra. Its sharp scales were forged into the weapons' teeth, and its heart supplies their engines. Even the strongest of armors find themselves getting effortlessly ripped apart by the teeth of these chainsaws. Bayonetta can use these weapons as a pair of high momentum skates… somehow.\n\nChain Chomp\n\nBayonetta can use a Chain Chomp from Mario, wielding it like a massive flail with her leg and swinging it around as it bites at whatever it can. By using her Umbran Climax, she can let it loose and explode on whatever it bites onto, even allowing it to grow in size. This beast is so powerful that Rodin can't even tame it. That implies it’s canon.\n\nUmbran Armor\n\nA heavy-duty, vehicular type of transport designed by the Umbra Witches to be used only in their most desperate of battles, with immense physical strength and in-built machine guns. This armor can be summoned as part of Umbran Climax when the Earrings of Ruin accessory is equipped. It can also be summoned through the Infernal Demon Umbran Clock Tower.\n\nDevil Arms\n\nWeapons dropped by Demons upon defeat with a Torture Attack. The weapons range from dual swords, whips, shotguns, a spinning bladed top of death, etc. Like their angelic counterparts, they dissipate after a short time.\n\nBayo 3 Weapons\n\nColour My World\n\nA set of guns made by Rodin, these weapons are made for the Umbran combat style “Bullet Arts”. These guns also channel the power of one of Bayonetta summons Madama Butterfly which allows them to have extra power, which increases exponentially with Demon Masquerade (more on that later). The names of the individual guns are Orange Blossom, Yellow Sunshine, Green Grass and Blue Sky. As always, they shoot things good.\n\nG-Pillar\n\nA large Anti-Caliber Anti-Materiel rifle that incorporates tissue from the Demon Gomorrah. While its shape makes it seem like a gun, Bayonetta instead uses it as a giant club, its hits emitting a dark flame that increases its damage.\n\nIgnis Araneae Yo-Yo\n\nA pair of yo-yos that contain clones of the Demon Phantasmaraneae’s energy reactor. They can be used at a range while spinning around blades that will also spew out magma from their cores. They are also used so that Bayonetta can skate around at high speeds.\n\nDead End Express\n\nCreated by the Infernal Demon Wartrain Gouon from his own parts, this half-chainsaw half-train hybrid weapon grinds into enemies with its deadly blades, weighing more than a ton in total. Impossible for a normal human to use, but not Bayo, who applies it like a club. It can also be used as a vehicle through its ability to morph into a miniature train, both for transport and for combos.\n\nRibbit Libido-BZ55\n\nA microphone stand used by the Demon Baal, which has continually absorbed magic over hundreds of years, and so has gained abilities like converting voices into destructive sound waves and amping the user’s strength and durability based on how they sing. The stand can also be used as a spear to deliver piercing and slashing attacks.\n\nSimoon\n\nA pair of fans that were crafted solely from the feathers of fledglings of the Infernal Demon Malphas. Lighter than paper yet more durable than steel, the fans are used to slash enemies with twin arcs of feathers. They are capable of delivering attacks on par with Malphas' own, and allow for merging with Malphas through Demon Masquerade.\n\nTartarus\n\nA pair of steel weapons, made out of the rubble from the fallen Umbran clock tower. Their \"gate\" can open to unleash many offensive weapons, including gatling guns and spiked arms. Some say that the weapons contain the souls of the Umbra Witches who died when the tower fell, and that the restless spirits behind the gate are the witches after having melded with Inferno’s miasma. Bayonetta uses the spirits of her fallen clan for up-close boxing, manifesting Tartarus’ weaponry from the formed gate for extra punishment.\n\nAbracadabra\n\nA weapon created by Mictlantecuhtli. The hat is Abra and the cane is Cadabra. In tandem, they can create items ranging from doves to bombs to entire vehicles to launch towards their targets. As a result, not even the user can predict what will happen when it’s used, though it’s still a highly effective monster slayer. The portal inside can be used to teleport, along with being able to shoot balls of electricity. When used with Demon Masquerade, the user channels Mictlantecuhtli's inexplicable power.\n\nCruel Altea\n\nA weapon formed of Labolas, a type of Infernal Demon made from lost pets, how heartless. The remote attack units on its limbs can be shot at enemies and manipulated at a range, and it can emit absolute zero freeze breath from its mouths that freezes enemies, obviously. Bayonetta can use it for some devastating ice attacks and beams.\n\nCassiopeia\n\nEssentially an anchor, this weapon was once used against the Demon Kraken before its wielder was defeated and sunk to the bottom of the ocean. The weapon itself was embedded in Kraken's body and so absorbed magic power over centuries. It’s rumored a Heike general in the late Heian period used it against the leader of a race of underwater demons. In combat, the weapon’s sharpened tip is launched out with a chain, allowing Bayonetta to swing it at enemies at a range.\n\nNintendo Costume Weapons\n\nBayonetta is apparently a closet Nintendo fan and enjoys cosplaying as various Nintendo heroes in her spare time.\n\nMaster Sword\n\nThe mythical blade wielded by the heroes of Hyrule, those who possess the Spirit of the Hero and Triforce of Courage, to banish great evil. Its power is legendary, and the blade itself can cut down the most powerful of monsters with relative ease.\n\nThe Master Sword can only be wielded when Bayonetta is wearing the Hero of Hyrule costume and Shuraba is equipped as the weapon in her hands. She will use it as she wielded Shuraba in the first game, sharing its Wicked Weaves and Charge Modifier.\n\nArwing Guns\n\nBased on the blueprints of a space fighter obtained by Rodin, this device was created by combining magic, science and technology, and does not contain the souls of demons or gods. As a result, the guns are difficult to manage, and need a special suit to display their true power. Using these guns, Bayonetta can fire off volleys of laser blasts, which can be charged up for extra damage.\n\nGalactic Bounty Hunter Costume\n\nThe advanced power suit of a female bounty hunter with built-in arm cannons, built to let the wearer survive hostile alien environments. With its cannons, Bayonetta can fire off powerful charge shots, and can even turn into the iconic Morph Ball.\n\nMushroom Kingdom Princess Costume\n\nComing in both Peach and Daisy variants, these costumes, when worn, allow Bayonetta to summon the great turtle king himself through her Wicked Weaves, replacing her usual attacks.\n\nAccessories\n\nBayo 1 Accessories\n\nPulley's Butterfly\n\nA treasure made by the witch Turnadot, using the wearer’s magic energy to give divine protection. Whoever wears the Bracelet will create butterflies that can take damage the user would originally take.\n\nInfernal Communicator\n\nBayonetta can use this item to make a temporary contract with the Little Devils, an infamous band of demon youth, and can summon them in battle to help her attack enemies.\n\nStar of Dinéta\n\nThis artifact was made by the witch Yenaldooshi.

Dante, Vergil and Nero, alongside their Hybrid physiology, have a special lineage of demonic power that is exclusive to them, which comes from the Demon Lord Sparda. This thanks to them having the sameblood andsoul ashim.\n\nDante gains a plethora of abilities thanks to his heritage, being a Son of Sparda. Because the Legendary Dark Knight himself was a cut above all other Demons in the series, as a consequence, Dante and Vergil are more powerful than any other conceivable Hybrid in Devil May Cry. He has immense stamina, as Dante recovers from stamina use quickly, and Devil Trigger replenishes it. He fought Urizen for several hours in their first clash, and repeatedly fought Vergil for 39 days straight after cutting down the Qliphoth (may have rested in between fights) whilst trapped in the Underworld in the ending of Devil May Cry 5.\n\nDante can breathe in space and underwater, and can walk on water.\n\nDemonic Energy\n\nDante's physical power comes from his Magic/Demonic power. Every Demonic power, physical or magical, shares the same source of energy, Demonic Energy. The loss and increase of DE directly correlates to Dante’s power, speed, and durability. Here we see how his reflexes, his agility and his speed are becoming slower and sloppier as he grows weaker by the second when he is being stripped of his Demonic Power, forcing him to use his guns as they are the only ones that don't run on his Demonic Energy. Concurrently, Dante’s Demonic Energy restores itself at a rapid rate. A strong human spirit can amplify Demonic Power.\n\nDemonic Power is often used to boost someone's attributes, an example of this is when Gilver, using the nexus, starts making the Demon World energy flood into the Human World, having said energy close to him boosts his power and defense to the point Dante's attacks stopped working. Dante can also channel his Demonic Energy into his weapons to further enhance them to perform devastating attacks as seen in the case of Rebellion, and Dante can even amplify his firearms, like his signature dual handguns, Ebony and Ivory, to boast a lot more firepower and better accuracy.\n\nDante can even weaponize this energy for various applications:\n\nShooting explosive energy out of his sword\n\nCreating platforms that allow him to double jump or dash forward, this sometimes requires a specific weapon.\n\nTo charge his pistols, shotguns, and other weapons with his own demonic powers\n\nPutting energy into vehicles to make them go faster\n\nDestroying walls and shaking a building just by powering up\n\nLastly, Devil Trigger completely revitalizes the user and boosts all stats, via more demonic energy.\n\nRegeneration\n\nDante possesses an incredibly potent healing factor. Even before awakening his full Demonic Power, he could regenerate from multiple impalements and gunshots (hundreds at once and a headshot in one occurrence). He can walk off removing a large sword from his chest (which may or may not have also sliced through his head). His healing potential is on par with his brother, who regenerated from being sliced clean in half before his body could fall apart. Dante also has solid pain tolerance, being able to casually walk around, put on a song, eat pizza and fight with scythes stabbed all over his body (refer to resistances for more examples of pain tolerance).\n\nNotably though, Dante used to have one weakness in the form of his heart, which if damaged sufficiently could incapacitate or hypothetically kill him. While fatal to him in his younger years, Dante has since improved the application of his healing to his heart. Impalement through the heart only knocked Dante out when taken off guard by Sid (and once the blade was lifted, he recovered instantly), and his healing capabilities have only skyrocketed since. Dante’s Devil Trigger additionally enhances his regenerative potential.\n\nHis regeneration is on par if not superior to Nero, who can regenerate entire limbs, and was able to heal from having his body melted by the Savior in the DMC4 Novel (The Savior is made of melted down physical and spiritual matter, which is what it was causing Nero to suffer before he healed). Specifically, what occurred was Nero was absorbed by the Savior to be melted down like the demons that make it, physically and spiritually. Nero loses his entire body and his sense of being. Dante calls out to Nero from outside, which makes him realize he still exists and he starts reforming his body from his memories alone. Dante sends Yamato into The Savior, which separates Nero’s essence from it via its ability to cut off man from Demon. Yamato assists Nero in healing the final bits of his body, but the text makes clear Nero had restored his head, right arm, torso, and more from nothing. This was done by a Nero far weaker than Dante’s current peak.\n\nThe actual limit to this healing is explored with Dante’s brother, Vergil. After being caught by Mundus, the Demonic Emperor forced Vergil’s very soul into an artificial soldier body, creating Nelo Angelo. Upon Nelo’s defeat, Vergil’s body and soul seemingly explode, with guides confirming Vergil was completely destroyed. Despite this, years later Vergil was able to return from the dead in DMC5, though it left him in a near death state. Ironically this is similar to Mundus himself, who was able to return from his body being destroyed, but was reduced to a weaker state in doing so.\n\nVergil’s long timeframe is due the removal of his demonic Name by Mundus, and the placement of another name on him that being Nelo Angelo, and his loss of will and resolve after this occurred. Similarly, Nero was only able to regenerate from being physically and spiritually melted by the Savior after realizing he still exists and having the resolve to restore himself. Likewise, he is only able to reach his full demonic potential and heal his demonic arm in DMC5 after resolving his emotional confusion by speaking to Kyrie.\n\nDante’s regeneration likewise would be on the same tier, and be tied to his resolve and stamina. The regeneration and statistics of Demonic Hybrids are hard tied to stamina and can be weakened/lowered for a time until the Hybrid regains said stamina. Dante makes a note in 4’s novel that he would rather avoid being turned to ash, which makes sense since repeated regeneration from this would drain him.\n\nNote: Nero being unable to regenerate his arm in 5 is not a contradiction to the above. Vergil notably steals his Demonic Power, leaving Nero unable to summon his prior Devil Trigger, and hybrids have regen negation of their own (see next section). Vergil is even shown manifesting the removed arm in his taunts. Nero is also conflicted emotionally until the end of 5, and as said above, emotions are tied to potency.\n\nDemons being able to return from the destruction of their body and soul isn't exactly new. Middle-class and higher Demons are able to regenerate from this level of destruction over time, though the time-frame can vary. Visions of V shows that certain demons can return from death if their soul/core remains intact. As for Dante himself, it's likely he could return as well if given enough time, as stated above.\n\nHealing Negation\n\nSparda and his kin seem to be able to leave Demons with permanent wounds, despite their healing potential mentioned above. Sparda was able to nullify Beowulf’s regeneration and leave a scar on his eye, despite the fact all Demons above the weakest are stated to be able to regenerate from the loss of all their essential aspects. This is seen again with Berial: Nero was able to inflict fatal wounds on Berial and he needed to retreat to the Demon World to recover his strength and even after coming back to the Human World again, Berial states that he is not completely recovered from his battle with Nero.\n\nDante was capable of permanently destroying two heads of the Cerberus in battle with it, as when it became a Devil Arm, only one head was left. Perhaps one of the more obvious examples is Dante killing Sid with Abigail’s power in only one shot in their second fight, but in the first, while underestimating Sid’s new power, the Demon was simply able to regenerate from blood. In his fight with Chen (who was 70 percent Sparda and enhanced by the reality warping Beastheads), Dante and Chen delivered blows to each other that were noted to impair their regeneration, leaving them with broken limbs despite the usual potency of their healing being able to easily deal with such wounds.\n\nControl over Names/Aspects\n\nSouls are one of the most important aspects in the Devil May Cry universe, as not only do they contain the Mind, Memories and all the information of the being and even its ancestors, they also contain the Names of Demons which are the abstract essence that give demons all their power. Demon Names are stated to be a fundamental part of their existence that can shape the world and change the value of everything. The name embodies not only a Demon’s power, but their very form. Some examples are Frosts, Nightmare (generates nightmares), Phantom, and Plasma (literal embodiments of electricity).\n\nSpeaking of, it’s shown that Dante and Vergil have access to the ability of removing and giving names through Sparda’s power, with Sparda himself using it long ago. Sparda had removed the names from seven Demons, which left them powerless. Upon receiving a name, the Demons regain form. Vergil himself grants a Name to Sloth and the other seven sins to undo the first set of Sparda’s seals on Temen-ni-gru (it is implied Dante would have been able to do this as well). Dante and Vergil are explicitly stated to have the same powers, as they also have the same soul.\n\nDante himself used this power to survive as a teen by renaming himself Tony Redgrave, after Rebellion (which is imbued with Sparda’s power), instructed him to, but he later took his true Name once more. As seen there, it also affected his memory, and his power. Upon taking his true Name, his portion of Sparda’s power was suppressed no longer. As such, although he doesn’t use it often, it is certainly another impressive ability he has, which should affect a portion of one’s soul, their power, and the abstract essence of one’s existence.\n\nNote: Some Demons can function without a Name, though the ones that can are stated to be able to do so due to their inherent skills. Nobodies specifically wear magic masks that empower them in order to overcome a lack of a name.\n\nSupernatural Senses\n\nA Son of Sparda’s senses are also vastly more capable than an ordinary human, allowing Dante to see spirits leave possessed bodies, see the souls a Hell Greed Summons and sense aura and danger from his surroundings. Dante can smell the scent of blood and detect the dark aura which radiates from it, pick up the scent of Demons (as well as an opponent’s) from far distances, see at night, and sense killing intent from another dimension approaching. He can even detect things like power levels, magic and magical energy, and surges of “evil”. Dante also once sensed an incoming phone call before it happened.\n\nHis brother Vergil has been able to sense Lady entering the Temen-ni-gru while in meditation, and was able to see through illusions with his senses. Dante has also been able to notice illusions.\n\nSupernatural Willpower\n\nThe willpower of Sparda’s children is beyond being defined as “normal”. Vergil was shown to resist mind control and enslavement from Mundus for 9 years, despite his Name being literally changed by the demon (basically warping his very aspect). Vergil only gave in when shown his mother’s pendant. Dante himself is capable of wielding the Sword of Sparda, which is noted to require great willpower to do so. Both Dante and Vergil were able to wield the sword’s prior form, the Force Edge, which deformed Arkham into a blob because he lacked the necessary willpower.\n\nSoul Interaction\n\nOf course, what’s a Demon Hunter without the ability to interact with Demons? Dante’s capable of hurting the intangible type Demons of the Underworld, and can kill a Demon possessing a woman without harming the host, separating them in the process. Vergil’s human aspect V has also shown it is possible to hold souls, as he held the soul core of Nightmare in order to return it.\n\nSealing\n\nSparda and his family have shown skill in the ability of creating seals. This allows them to also seal alway those who they normally can’t defeat, such as when Sparda sealed Mundus and Argosax. Sparda placed a seal on the realms, locking Mundus in a subsection of the Demon World and removing his powers, forcing Mundus to slowly have to regain them after 2000 years. It is worth noting that Sparda’s seals that don't involve outside help (like using blood from a priestess) are power based and can potentially be broken out of, but doing so is noted to permanently lower the power of the being who does so (it is noted though the seals got weaker over time as well).\n\nDante’s ammo has spirits sealed inside, and he himself sealed Mundus after he returned, with the Son of Sparda being stated to have sealing power beyond Sparda himself. One of Sparda’s best seals involved locking Argosax in a subspace in the Demon World noted to have “no exit”. Dante can also nullify power like his father could. In conjunction with Vergil, Dante separated Arkham from the Force Edge and sent him back to the Human World, while inside the Demon World.\n\nReactive Evolution\n\nPerhaps Dante’s most powerful ability is his continual evolutionary capacity. As a teen, Dante was capable of improving his skills extremely fast in combat, even against demons that have techniques that allow them to perceive patterns far beyond their opponent's abilities, and against the Black Knights, with said opponents being made of combat data from Vergil, Sparda, and Dante.\n\nDante gains boosts in power by simply demon hunting. This is a trait carried by all of Sparda’s descendants. For example, Nero trained for one month to get stronger to face Urizen once again, b"
