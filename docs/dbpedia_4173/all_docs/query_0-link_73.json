        "text": "Alright time to finish this look into the Devil May Cry franchise (until DMC6 is a thing) with the reboot of the franchise. Now I am not here to talk about the development of the game the whole time. I am here to dissect this game and see what makes it cool. I did it for Devil May Cry 2 so I think this game should give me an easier time. DMC2 has no emotion and this reboot is full of many loud emotions, a bit too loud nearly all the time. Also, the reboot came in an interesting time period so this game has a bit of a time capsule feel to it and is helpful to know this in what this title tried to do. Now I will be using my personal nicknames for some of these characters or ones I am going to make up right now for this post. Expect to hear all the Donte names possible here because I am not a fan of this character like many are. Still without bias I have to find what makes not only this character cool in some eyes, but the entire game as well.\n\nTo start things off the first thing I want to bring up is the original Donte in that trailer that everyone got mad about. This is going to be a hot take right here, but I personally feel that this character would have been far better if we got the original version. Now do I agree this is Dante? Hell no! This would still be a strange twist on the character regardless. Still I think the Donte we got in the end was just your usual bland protagonist of his time. This British punk feels more alive with gothic tones added to him compared to a kid that pretty much just feels he watched Fight Club one too many times. I can even see a certain style being added to this draft of the character. He smokes which could have added some cool taunts like simply smoking in front of foes and even tossing the bud at foes similar to Dante with the rose or Kiryu from Yakuza when he smokes. On top of that that first Donte fits what the game also has with the enemies and such. I personally really dislike how clean cut the Donte we got was. He really could just be placed into many other games with no problem. So yes, Donte was going to be a mess no matter what happened, it’s just I think the one we got just made things worse.\n\nWith Donte… we got one loud mouth punk, wait that sounds like Nero more than Dante. Already we have this interesting misstep since Donte takes some notes from Nero more than Dante. Nero even swears more than the other characters in actual DMC and with Donte, he swears so much that the word “fuck” can be used in his biography. Now this style of attitude can click with people. Saying whatever you want and being snarky to anything around you. Donte even changes throughout his journey so he does go through character development to where he needs to take a position to stop another, on paper that sounds fine. The problem is that we deal with a basic “Down with the man” story and paper-thin characters. On a design basis though I can see what Donte wants to be. A punk with a heart of gold. The short hair works with his “A” shirt and coat. He looks a bit sloppy and that is the point. Sadly, it loses some of those points because of how clean he looks. It just reminds me of some 90’s video game covers with these obvious people only dressing like these bad dudes for the cover.\n\nRemember when people thought this new look for Nero was Dino?\n\nIs there anything good to say about Donte really? I think there is even if it’s not my taste. Again, his attitude can be endearing for some. This has been seen with Nero, insulting these scary monsters and posing to feel bigger than them. Donte has some of that like how he casually goes through wreckage when he is getting dressed in the opening scene, there are people who get a laugh from that and the time the pizza covers his junk. Sadly, I think it goes really downhill for the character after that. Sure, he still insults some demons here and there, but he sadly can have some standard angry faces and blank looks when seeing new demons to fight. He takes fighting a bit more seriously compared to Dante, sure whatever. He still does get into the fight by screaming out which many characters in action games do. I also do feel he has some style when fighting, the red weapons pack a punch and when he uses the gauntlets, he does his own take with them. He acts a bit more like a drunk brawler in some ways, especially when he is reeling his fists back. Then the blue weapons have smooth and fast motions on top of that he can fly around with those type of powers. The gameplay does well for showcasing this character better than the story can ever do, which is a bit sad because there was a character here.\n\nAnother thing to note was how this game came out during the time when Capcom was aiming for the “Western” tastes. Take note this is when they thought their usual style was not winning out even if Capcom had good sales already, even with DMC4. With the idea of a western mindset is well the joke of edge. We all know what this means, people wanted the characters that say no to the usual methods and be beefy boys. Kratos from God of War and even something like Nier getting localized has proof of this. The original Donte was a bit lankier and the final version we got easily added some muscle to him. Donte also fit the bill for that age range of our usual main character in this era of video games. If he had a shaved head it would have even been more obvious, but no they had to go with the black hair and never ever go to white hair at all, man even this so-called rebel character even loses his backbone in his design later on. Still the edge factor was real in this overall experience and while it has become a joke, this was a legit trend and should not be ignored.\n\nHow about the other characters? Well Vergil’s counterpart, Vernot has his same share of troubles. First there was that stupid hat he was wearing which got patched out in later versions of the game, I’m not joking. Still I will be honest here, I do think the beginning of Vernot was not a bad take on Vergil. It actually did stay true to some of what Vergil was. Dante was the slop and Vergil was the serious one, Dante dressed poorly in DMC3 and 5 and Vergil always looked more formal. DMC5 Vergil even carries a similar design scheme too with having the blue being a bit more subdued. Vernot’s black coat really stands out especially when you see his bottom half having the blue the character is known for. He looks far more proper and his design does actually hold some hints to what he actually is by the end (too bad the story did really bad setting that up). The obvious thing would be the blue band on his arm, I bet everyone knows what that could be hinting towards knowing how this character wanted to rule in the end.\n\nMany other characters now… man there is not a lot to say about them. Kat is the damsel in distress which is really in bad tastes considering how Ninja Theory pretty much called previous female characters in the series and even Bayonetta, whores with guns. Mundus in this game is a scummy business man or a better way to put it, a poor man’s Lex Luthor. Then the only boss I think that had any flavor would be Bob since he is a loud spokesperson for a news channel and his boss fight really reflected that well. The varying images on his face showing how much he needs to save his own face all the time. Some other bosses fit a bit more of a gross out style which for some is their sense of humor, then I will give props for not making a succubus sexy (you don’t see that often, was it funny… no, but hey they tried and by tried I mean a bunch of “F” bombs). At least this game stuck to an art style and made these demons disgusting and did not go all over the place. The enemies can have some nice designs and they speak loud just like the demon hunter, El Donte so they match.\n\nAnother thing this game has would be its visual presentation. Not only does it stand out with this, it’s not a bad one by any means. Personally, I am not for the loudness of it at times, but there is actual effort into making these distorted worlds. There was even a short level where you pretty much go through a Fox News channel, that was actually pretty nice (you cannot get any louder than Fox News, am I right?). Probably the best level that fits with the style they were going for was the club. The music keeps a constant beat with the background following with it, the colors change around too. Even the stage you are on has slight changes, its visually appealing. There were even the moments where you get to experiment with new powers which looks lovely as well. I’m happy they had some quiet and beautiful scenery here and there to balance things out. So visually speaking the game can be a treat at times and there are fun things to look in the background too. So, props to the reboot there, it’s nice to look at when the game is actually playing.\n\nTo be honest the game always looks far more appealing when it’s just gameplay, which makes sense you want to have a game look fun to play. While it has some issues with some control options that can only be for the person playing. While there is a bit of a hurdle or two for me personally because I am too wired into how other DMC games play. There are some stylish combos to be done here and the weapon switching in that game does have some faster access. Then with the best version removing the whole color defenses, you can go all out with combos. So, on paper there is a good number of things to try out, but the game does have some broken weapons, but hey, so does other DMC titles. I feel Donte probably has the best crowd control of all the DMC characters in the franchise. He has weapons that have widespread effects, can launch others into the sky, even his Devil Trigger slows down time. This character manages to be a mixture of DMC combos with Bayonetta like systems. Combos that can be easy to do, but also have them really connect well with each other too to fully master them. I do think the game has only aged poorly with its story. Some of its presentation can be still be loved and with sixty frames now being common in the better versions of the game, it can be enjoyed like other DMC games with combat. This is where it can actually be better than the second game.\n\nDevil May Cry 2 is just full on boredom. It was a dull presentation, barely any great moments with the low amounts of dialogue and story, and no real strong sense of style. At least with the reboot game there is a sense of style here that can work for some people. The presentation is loud and colorful and has an obvious contrast with the grey real world, but hey it’s something more than DMC2. There are more enjoying combos to experiment with and it feels a bit more rewarding to do so as well. Donte has far more things to do compared to DMC2 Dante. While the story can be frustrating there can be some guilty pleasures with it now these days while people barely even try with DMC2. While this reboot can be loud and annoying, I would still put more effort into it compared to the kid just eating glue.\n\nOverall, this game was a mess, but an interesting one nonetheless. It really reminds me of the time period of 2013 when the game released and how that era was for gaming. Especially for Capcom around that era. This game really ended up doing some good in the end though. I feel like the wait for DMC5 only got better with this reboot because it couldn’t recreate that same spark the original games had. When that first reveal for this fifth game finally happened, it just filled fans with more joy. The reboot was gone and what came back were the true demon hunters we got to experience. I have to actually thank the reboot also for the fact that this game got me to play more DMC in general. I started with the fourth game and the whole backlash this reboot was getting encouraged me to really look back on the franchise. So just remember, even with some bad moments in a franchise, it can always pick itself back up in far greater ways you can imagine, just like how Devil May Cry 3 completely shocked people and now so did Devil May Cry 5.\n\nI think it is about time to finally get this post done. More people are doing their big videos on this game and most of the fans know what happens in this title. I know I still did not do a post on the reboot game, but to be honest… that will still be a work in progress. Also, why do I want to talk about the bummer title when we got the actual Devil May Cry 5! The reason why I did these posts was to celebrate the series and I even had to cover the second game and try to bring light and a different point of view to most of its glaring problems. There is a lot to love about Devil May Cry and now this fifth entry is probably a huge collection of why fans and its creators have loved it for so long.\n\nI will not lie, this game feels like a finale in many ways. We got tons of plot points that were introduced in three and four that finally got their proper follow-ups. On top of that we had a prequel novel with events before five that actually had Lucia from the second game and man the amount of personality, she had in that one novel is far better than how she was presented in the game. Along with that we got many great callbacks to the entire series and yes this includes the reboot game. Devil May Cry 5 has everything and while some may think having things that represent the reboot game seems to be wishy washy, because it can seem this game was making no enemies in the fanbase. To be honest though, even a fan like me can say there are good to even great things to the reboot title (which will be for another day). I do find the callbacks to the first DMC to also be interesting because both the original and reboot title were not done by the man; we know for Devil May Cry now, Hideki Itsuno. Being with this franchise for a long time though and seeing its many faces, this man learned how to merge things together with perfection.\n\nSpeaking of perfection, I am torn with saying this is the best Devil May Cry game ever. The action in this game is just the best! So much variety is given with only three characters and two in particular are like over ten characters in one and the third one is literally four in one. There are even foes that have come back from the original game like Sin Scissors and Nobodies. The only big flaw here though is that the DMC series finally got rid of those puzzles and while secret missions do have some fun little puzzles to solve, DMC5 breaks the tradition and actually does go for the reboot’s way of level design a bit. In 5, you are walking straight a whole lot, but at times I would rarely notice because the action is that good. So as of right now the remaining Resident Evil in DMC is literally the engine that runs in this game.\n\nOnto the other aspect of Devil May Cry that has been with the series ever since the beginning is Dante. As talked about before, Dante as always been the cool surfer bro when he is on the job. Dante in the original game shrugs off danger like he is a Toku hero. In Devil May Cry 3 we get to see that attitude take a reckless variation until he finally notices what he needs to do. Then with the fourth game, Dante got to act like a mentor passing off the torch to another son of Sparda. For this new look into Dante’s life we actually get his anime personality at the beginning. Dante has no running power or water in his place and still just rests at his desk. A new job comes up and he hears something that kicks his gears right back in. Dante’s self-destruction comes clear in this title and it finally adds in a larger sense of relatability to him. Back then we loved his moments of fun and also took in his sadness as well (with the first game, it got taken more as a joke sadly…). Also let us add on the fact that is been teen years since we got to see this demon hunter back in action. Dante is us; he has been waiting for another gig and so have we. The major difference is that Dante actually does not want to waste any time though. It sure is interesting to see Dante with age becomes narrowminded in a fashion.\n\nNow back in fashion, is the youngest Devil Hunter, Nero. With this character, I took a look at his punk attitude and while that is still clearly here, we get to see his full character and take a step forward as well. To be frank, this easily could have the title of Nero’s Awakening. Yes, the main character role is given to Nero again and while many would think after DMC4, they would not do that again. The issues with Nero’s debut was because of budget restraints for the most part. It felt unfair to Nero and it is only thanks to time and a major misstep from the franchise to make fans warm up to him. Nero was my beginning with the series so seeing how he deals with these new events is heartwarming. Itsuno even gives Nero shorter hair and somehow people mistook him for Dante from the reboot title. Both Nero and Donte share a punkish attitude so this short hair look works for Nero and they also made sure to give him some Vergil details since that will be a major thing later on.\n\nAlong with Nero is a whole new look into how he plays. Back then, Nero only had his one special arm that gave him the greatest grab in video games. Nero can still do the famous Snatch move, but Nero has far more than just grabs. Nero has electricity, parries, time stops, flying arms, and even a freaking Mega Buster! That is only about half of the arms’ abilities and these are an insane concept to add to the Devil May Cry series. In a way this is a method of keeping some Resident Evil in the series since the arms have to be used with a worry about your inventory. The arms are a bit fragile so when taking a hit, they break and you can break them yourself to unleash a powerful move. At first, Itsuno was questioning if they should make the Devil Breakers similar to Dante with his weapons, but they wanted to make Nero stand out in many ways. The team decided to work with consumable weapons (and this time not like a Holy Water that subtracts your score). Either way these items really show Nero’s character well. They have large impact, but with reckless behavior can lead to messy situations and regretting your actions.\n\nOnto the aspect of regret we have our brand-new character, V (yes that is his name). V actually brings back a style of cool that was almost in the series before and that is goth. The original Donte had more gothic themes along with his British punk aspects and to be honest, it would have been fine in my opinion. Now is it better to have a new character pick up this theme, yes that is for sure. A new character can bring new aspects to a series just like Nero introduced the punk attitude. In a way though… V does take ideas from Donte because of who he actually is. Now we get to the part where all chains are off. What I am implying here is that V is Vergil. Vergil who has been seen as posh cool and a character who had loss after loss. Vergil split himself into two and V is the human half with barely any demon power. V is extremely fragile as he is a literal husk of what Vergil left behind. A big reason why William Blake is being used for this game ever since the beginning. That opening statement is all about how holding grieving emotions towards another just leads to a path of destruction. V is now the one who notices that and wants to redeem his errors.\n\nNow V is still not a perfect man, but taking steps to fix what he has done is improvement none the less. On top of that V even brings a new style of combat into the series, summoning. V has three summonses where they are all from Devil May Cry original. Even the summons mention how they were born. These summonses were created from memories of when Vergil was Nelo Angelo a huge aspect Vergil wanted to get rid of. The demon, Urizen has no memories he just knows he has suffered losses from Dante and wants power! V being the shell of the part of Vergil’s life he wanted to shed is truly literal since he even tried to get rid of those memories which made the summons, Griffon, Shadow, and Nightmare. V brings new tactical combat to the series and while your familiars do the damage, V has to bring the finishing blow. V is extremely fragile and relies on stepping away for the most part. The gothic themes even come clearer when playing as him. His slender designs while wearing pure black clothes and with those tattoos just create an interesting image of a fighter. V even uses a cane to walk around. The best part about V is that you control your summons with different buttons, except for Nightmare until you ride and control him. You can even taunt while the partners are attacking and it is the greatest!\n\nI am sorry if this is going to be an extremely long post, but there is still more to cover here. We got another new character by the name Nico. Sure, she is not a playable character, but her importance is large none the less. Originally designed to be another badass character, Nico was going to be more of a straight arrow that loved her craft. Through some improvising though the actress found a new way to show how Nico acts. Nico is playing things up while keeping a cool demeanor. When she is in the van, she is one of the devil hunters, hell this van is a Devil Weapon! She knows how dangerous things are and tries to hide it because this is pure bliss. She actually relates to any fan of the series since we love what we are watching, but if this was our reality, we would be extremely afraid. She also works so well with Nero from the get go since they both come from a story where they were neglected by their fathers. This is why these two have brother and sister like relationship so quickly and I love it so much. Nico easily became my favorite girl of the series which is impressive and it’s all thanks to how an actress wanted to add in some comedy for the character.\n\nOkay now for the big, big, and I mean big spoilers for this game and some of the greatest moments the series ever had. The return of Vergil and what that could bring after so many years. Vergil has always been an important figure in the series even in the first game with his Nelo Angelo appearance. So, what is in store for Vergil this time around, yes, he becomes the final boss again like his role in Devil May Cry 3 and yet so much has changed for him. Vergil now returns to where Dante has grown older and even seeing his son take steps that both Vergil and Dante never could do. A family is reunited with this one character returning. Two brothers are back and a son gets to meet his father for the first time. Family is an extremely large part of the Devil May Cry series ever since day one. The first Dante wanted revenge for the death of his mother and we got to see how fragile of a topic this was for him. This only got expanded in his prequel title where he sheds a tear for the loss of his brother and feeling pain that only Lady knows as well. The thing is though, Dante accepts what he has done after all of these years.\n\nTaking a bit of a detour to talk about other mechanics in the game that really enrichen the experience. The first one is Dante’s new power, the Sin Devil Trigger. Dante can now achieve higher than his father and wields a new sword under his own name. This new Devil Trigger really just shows off how powerful Dante as become. You do not get the healing factor with this one, but the damage output is insane! Dante even gets the largest weapon load of the entire series. Dante can have all of his swords after finishing the game at different difficulties, the return of the Kalina Ann and its second version which Dante dual wields them, new crazy weapons like the Faust Hat and the Cavaliere, and new spins on Ebony and Ivory and even Cerberus. Along with all of this you can even show off your skills to others thanks to the Cameo mechanics. Where your data is saved and can pop up to help players or to simply show off in the background. There is just so much style in this game and it makes sure you get the chance to show it off yourself.\n\nVergil is back and what happened because of him? A giant demon tree is summoned so that the demon half, Urizen can acquire power that the demon king, Mundus had. Which is quite an interesting detail since before the final fight with Urizen, we see him covering his true self. Vergil caused chaos yet again and with him back, Dante holds nothing back. Dante goes for the first attack, yes Dante of all people. He has no warm embrace for his brother, his heroic sense takes a violent turn. Dante has already done this before, twice to be specific. He holds no regrets on his past even if it still was damaging to his overall life. Dante has become tired of all this.\n\nAs for Vergil returning, he had two different experiences at the same time. Urizen, the demon wanting power and V the man who got to see the true terror of that. We even get to learn the reason for how Vergil came to be which is mommy issues. Yes, this has become a joke in the series as well, but Eve is extremely important to how Dante and Vergil are as characters. Dante was saved and Eve did not get to Vergil in time, leaving him to run for his life alone. Vergil took that as he was left behind and had to defend himself hence his quest for power. It’s something many fans (including myself) have looked into before since that feeling of loss from both the demons and his family made him feel worthless. Vergil still holds his family in importance because its fact of why he is around and how much he wanted his mother to love him. On top of that Vergil does admit that he fell in love with a woman in his past. Again, his past love could be another reason for why he wanted new power since he had a family to protect. Vergil simply got lost gaining that new power.\n\nIn a way, Dante’s narrow mindlessness is similar since he has only been getting stronger and even with a new Devil Trigger to boot as well. Power clouds the mind and both of these idiots lost a lot. Dante even mentions he barely remembers any peaceful moments with his brother, he only knows of when they fought. These two never took time to forgive each other, they only kept fighting. This became their method. Even if Vergil finally got to reflect on his past with regret for his quest of power, he still held onto an old desire. V mentions this before fusing back with Urizen, they both hold that feeling to finally win. Dante’s heroism and Vergil’s desires simply just end of clashing with each other every single time while in reality they both share the burden of loss, but there is one to unite them.\n\nThis is the moment when Nero takes his main character slot. Throughout this fifth title, we saw Nero becoming more reckless. Nero sees that power is all that he needs and says that straight to Dante’s face. Dante called him a deadweight before and that just motivated Nero to get stronger in a bad way. Still Nero ends up being caring to others around him since that is how he grew up. He had people to care for him unlike Dante and Vergil who had to live on their own. When Nero learns Vergil is his father, he starts to really question many things. Originally, he was just fighting to prove his mentor wrong, now it became a moment where he could lose family again. Growing up with Kyrie and Credo gave him a family and falling in love with Kyrie became strength for him. The loss of Credo then gives Nero tons of regret, he never forgave himself for it. Now Nero learns who his father is and now he learns that his mentor was an uncle the entire time. Nero tries to accomplish the number one thing that never happened in a Devil May Cry game, to reunite a family.\n\nDevil May Cry 1 and 3 had Dante fighting his brother and even killing him later on. Sparda’s family was forever torn on that faithful day when Eve died. The two brothers took different paths. Dante taking the side of what the hero wanted to save. Vergil took focus on what his father was, a demon and a legend, with a search for power. Nero fought for the thing he never fully had and he is back to do that now since it has been his entire goal in life. Nero lives with what Sparda’s actual legacy is, family. Sparda was a demon who ended up being a hero and yet the most important thing to him was family. He fell in love with a human woman and started one. His sense of justice came from love. Dante did not want to lose anyone close to him, hence why he closed his heart away and acted like the over the top hero. Vergil lost his focus for power even if it could have started with great intent. Nero never strayed from this path and he knocked some sense into these devil boys, to finally forgive each other.\n\nI cannot tell you how much this moment feels for any fan of the series. For me, I started with Nero and got to learn of Dante and his story later on and it feels correct. This is why Nero was taking the main character slot, he finally does the impossible. Nero prevents anyone from dying, the bloodshed is over. Seeing this moment being his awakening to his devil power and saying “Fuck you!” to all of this; is the biggest impact in the entire series. It throws a huge middle finger to a major trope since no one is going to lose here. Nero gets to prove himself in such an important moment of his life. Nero’s final fight with Vergil is beyond great since it’s the son proving he is right while his father needs to prove dominance. Now Dante and Vergil go away for who knows how long, but Nero has gained the possibility of being able to see his family in the future.\n\nHideki Itsuno has mentioned that this could be the end for him and this series. To be honest, this is a perfect end right here. The man who started with the first misstep in the series with the second game, created a legacy for himself. Devil May Cry 3 brought new life into Dante and a fourth game kept the image strong. The reboot happened and only made him more motivated to make this proper return bigger than ever. He even found many ways to tribute the original game something he never worked on because that was Hideki Kamiya. It’s amazing to put it simply. This man creates an ending for a franchise he didn’t even start. At the same time, he put everything into this game. The original motif of family, the sons of Sparda story telling that started with Devil May Cry 3, and finishing the passing of the torch that the previous game started. There are even many aspects of the reboot title with how the game plays and some funny references inserted as well. Itsuno loves this series even if it had missteps before, it only creates passion to do better. Thank you, Itsuno and to all of the teams of Devil May Cry you started a new trend of action games and closed a big book on it.\n\nNow we can truly ask this. Dante will we meet again?\n\nThis is not going to be an easy one. With the beginning of Devil May Cry, it is easy to define what makes it cool thanks to Hideki Kamiya putting his ideal of cool into the game. This sequel right here is an interesting one to look at. Sadly, Hideki Kamiya did not work on this title even though he was still working with Capcom. High chance Viewtiful Joe was taking his time. So, for this second game featuring the demon hunter Dante was handled by a new team. Development was not going well though and this was Hideki Itsuno’s first DMC title under his belt when he was thrown onto this project as the director. Poor Itsuno was tossed into a bad game from the start because knowing that the game was still slated for its original release date and have to get a full game done at the halfway mark already gone, there was no way of saving this game. Itsuno has talked about how when he was thrown into the project one of the few things that was fully done was the move Stinger. Still a big thing with this game is that the developers took notes from the fans’ responses to the first game and used it for number 2. What did people want and did they get it?\n\nFor the character Dante, fans grown to love his silly behavior that started from the first game. Now what we got in Devil May Cry 3 and 4 is still different from the original Dante. The original Dante as mentioned before acts like a Toksatsu hero which is something Kamiya has a soft spot for. Let us bring up one of the glaring problems of the original Dante though, his lines. Now this could have been because of translation errors or being translated too accurately and not changing them to fit English better, but who really knows. All I know the light about darkness reaching someone’s heart is up there with Zero’s “What am I fighting for?!” for one of the funniest moments in a Capcom game. Maybe some people had issues with that line or other lines possibly. The reason I bring this up is because Dante is mostly silent in the sequel. While this is a drastic change to the character can a silent protagonist be cool? The answer to that is yes, there have been many famous characters that barely speak a line, especially in video games. To be honest though I feel like Dante is tapping into a different type of media hero for this game and a good way to find that out is to look at some certain weapons.\n\nThose weapons are sadly not the swords because well there are just swords for new weapons, but there are many different types of guns still around and these things are broken. A big problem people had with the original game was that the guns were too weak. The sequel decided to make the guns stronger and they got some major steroids injected into them. This game also added some free aiming functions which oddly enough still continues to this day. Dante can shoot in all directions and he has some insane things with his guns in both gameplay and cutscenes. With this focus on the guns, could Dante be more focused on a Western hero, like cowboys and gunslingers? One character that comes to mind for me with this mentality of not talking all that much, but has some insane gun play would be The Man with No Name. Again, this is proving that having a character being silent is not impossible and conveying greatness can simply come from body language. DMC 2 simply tried to make Dante a different type of cool and while it did not work, people still love this design for Dante to this day. This design even got into Shin MegamiTensei 3. So, what is the reason why a silent Dante does not work?\n\nA big reason to bring up is that this game try to make lightning strike twice. Trish was a popular character and had high demand to be playable. There is a Trish option in the game, but in reality, her spotlight gets taken by a new female character, Lucia. With Lucia she happens to be a created being made by the villain of this game. If this sound familiar well that is because Trish was created by Mundus to lure Dante. While Trish had reason to be a created creature was that Dante still had trouble striking her down and had hope for her. Trish ends up becoming a better person and not a devil, because “Devils never cry.” This line is even repeated with Lucia when she tells Dante to kill her and she sheds a tear. So not only does it feel that Dante is not giving his all, the overall game’s presentation isn’t either. Everything just comes across as boring.\n\nWhile a new character is playable her effect on the series was not a strong one. I get that the idea of twin swords and throwing weapons such as knives and grenades fits Devil May Cry well enough, but again DMC 2 just fails at the concept. I mean you can even look at Lucia’s design and see she has a reverse color palette compared to Dante. Dante with white hair and a red outfit compared to the red haired, Lucia wearing a white outfit. I see the parallel here and I think they wanted to try and make a new female be more comparable to Dante this time around. Sadly, Dante in this game is near mute and Lucia comes off as a half-baked character. The lack of lines does not help at all too. So, can Lucia be considered cool? She has her own version of a Devil Trigger which has a nice design being an angelic looking demon. Another interesting concept to work with, but again just never comes to full fruition. At least Bayonetta gave us the female Dante we needed.\n\nFor weapons… yea the variety is gone this time for something a bit simpler to wrap around. I am not sure if this was an asked for thing, but high chance this was just because of time restraints more than anything else. Dante gets three swords and five guns, Lucia gets three sets of swords and five throwable weapons, and Trish has Sparda. Yes, oddly enough Trish using Sparda started here and she can do her famous toss with that weapon here too. This is going to be a point I will bring up when we get to another game in the series about making things easier. While being easy can be good for new players sometimes it gets rid of some flashy aspects. Back in the days people could not making everything a quick time event. The original DMC had so much charm because it had flair that even I am still amazed could have been done on the Playstation 2. So, making things easier this time around really ends up making the sequel shallower than anything. Sword combos were too simple and guns just broke the game where Dante can just stand still most of the time. The whole idea of Dante moving around constantly and changing into a completely different weapon is gone. Now these days we have easy combat that looks flashy and people will praise that even if it’s the same thing as just pressing one button over and over again with no variety.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nI am going to make some enemies here.\n\nWhat is there left to say for Devil May Cry 2, it was a train wreck from the start with the idea of having a different team work on this. I feel like if this project was just given to Kamiya and his team, this sequel would have been better. In the end though, this game ended up leading to much more than any would think. Future games in this series took notes from it and even expanding on the gun mechanics. There are even rumors among fans that the second game is going to be canon thanks to Devil May Cry 5. Hideki Itsuno did start out with a dud game, but he never fully forgot it. He ended up taking ideas and using them for other sequels which leads us to the third game of the series. Devil May Cry 3, the game that started the Character Action genre as we know it and is arguably not only the best Devil May Cry game, but another one of Capcom’s royal pieces of treasure.\n\nI am also going through DMC2 right now on my LP channel.\n\nDMC2 Playlist\n\nNow that I have time to actually be calm about Devil May Cry 5 (I am so lying right now; the excitement levels are still at the top). I think talking about this title’s importance is needed. When I started with the series was with the fourth installment. I have known about the series, but the PS3 was my first Sony console and I always seen tons of Dante thanks to Devil May Cry 3 videos on the internet. I even watched the animated series which some people like to get mad about that product, but I am simply okay with it. Either way the most obvious point to mention is that it has been ten years since we got numerical sequel for this franchise. There was the reboot game which we shall get to at some point in this post. Lately Capcom seems like it is bringing back their old golden standard, I mean not only is there Devil May Cry we also got Megaman and more to standard Resident Evil game. Overall though, this fifth title is going to be extremely important to the market as the Devil May Cry name has only been getting stronger over time.\n\nSo with the mention of DmC: Devil May Cry, the reboot title developed by Ninja Theory there is no doubt it damaged the franchise a bit. Whether you like the game or not, it cannot be ignored that the issues with DmC did cause some conflicts. Capcom simply wanted a Western take on the franchise which soon got a bit out of hand thanks to the development team. Ninja Theory did listen to Capcom about what they wanted for this title, but then how they reacted to the initial spark of insanity is made everything go crazy. Ninja Theory calling out fans which soon lead to articles saying that fans were being dumb and a disappointment to the franchise itself. Also, the whole fact that the company compared the female characters of the franchise to prostitutes, classy. So, with the madness that began from a teaser trailer is quite silly. When the company is then starting to throw insults, the anger is easier to understand. Now when the game did first come out, yea there were issues to the game itself. Later on, though they did make a new version of the game and fixed many of those problems, including some cut scenes. Either way though, DmC was a bit too damaged to be saved and while the fourth game got a special edition, it still took some time for number five.\n\nCapcom clearly did not forget about the franchise since Dante still had his fighting game appearances, but at this point he was up there with Darkstalker characters with the fact that they will just be in the fighting games. High chance the interest came back up though even before Marvel VS Capcom Infinite when the special edition of the fourth game did well in sales. The sales numbers were actually one of the big reasons why the reboot even happened in the first place. So why did Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition do well? The obvious answer was that high chance with the turmoil, it did get more people to know the name of the franchise. I bet while not selling well, the reboot did get attention from outsiders. Then with the magic of the internet and being able to buy so much from online services and those HD ports of the first three games, people just had time to check this franchise out during the quiet times. Devil May Cry is getting more fans, so this fifth game could be big for the sales numbers.\n\nThis has always been Devil May Cry’s biggest issue in its history. The original game did well to make it into a franchise and while the first and second games did good in sales, the third game did the worst. The first game did the best in sales out of the first three, that is not a good sign. The fourth game actually did the best which is thanks to making that game for Microsoft’s consoles as well compared to the Sony only days. Still Capcom was not impressed by the numbers. Now we are back to the original feel of the series after the reboot game, if this game does well, there could be more demon hunters in the future.\n\nNow for some personal reasons why I am saying that Devil May Cry 5 is important is because of the recent scene that action games are having right now. God of War for the Playstation 4 came out and while many people did like it, there were some people quite confused with it. I would be one of the confused ones because the combat was so poor compared to so many other action titles. Whenever someone would have this opinion the fans of the new God of War will tell those people that the game is being better regardless because of the focus on its story. I will be blunt about this, if a game is going to have action in it, have the action be good. I would rather play DmC before the new God of War because thanks to the newer version of the reboot it plays a whole lot better, sure that story is still awful, but I rather have a more action-packed adventure compared to a game where walking takes half of the game. Does Devil May Cry have exploration? Yes, this is because of its Resident Evil roots and exploring was still being done better than the straight line you mostly have in God of War.\n\nI told you all I had some beef with this game\n\nI feel like the action game genre is having a bit of trouble lately and of course the overall love for cinematic games. The thing is that there are many games I can call cinematic games but having that not be a problem. The Bayonetta series is proving that it can have amazing production values through its action and not just cut scenes. Bayonetta is quite the opposite in that factor too since the cut scenes can play like a slide show at times and still be enjoyable. There is also the fact that I feel an action game needs a skip function for the scenes. The problem with these games focusing on its walking and such, it feels that the cut scene effect takes too long even in-game play. Devil May Cry never had this trouble and while they do have their cut scenes, I can have more enjoyment with them. Games like Bayonetta and Devil May Cry have a more simplistic fun with their cut scenes and there is nothing wrong with that. Hell, I can easily remember them more for the fun they shown me, like Devil May Cry 3’s opening scene.\n\nOr when Dante rocks out!\n\nGoing back to these cinematic games, like God of War for example. I do fear that the movie styled games are going to cut down on the combat. God of War shows us this by adding things that are simply not needed. Walking, walking, and walking. Okay there are more problems like the whole camera view in that game and how it just gives Kratos a blinking indicator on his back on when an enemy is going to attack. While it was not a bad idea of why it is there, it creates a problem that makes reading foes easier. The previous God of War games did not have this problem and while I am not a big fan when the series quickly went into QTE hell, I can still say those games had better combat. I really have to call out on God of War’s combat when a PS2 game called God Hand has similarities to it and have a deeper combat system, maybe a bit too complicated, but I rather learn to play an action game. God of War never really shows this and the further you get in, it gets easier thanks to the new weapons you gain. The farther you get into God Hand you still need to set up your move list and while you have more to use, you need to know how they work together.\n\nWhile God of War is better made, God Hand still comes off as better experience for me.\n\nBayonetta did make the whole process of learning combos easier and in return they made the enemies for aggressive. Bayonetta teaches you of to dodge to get big rewards and those games never have an indicator on her back. The experimentation is still around thanks to new weapons you can use. It gets around a problem that games like Kingdom Hearts has for me with how easy it is to use one button to win the game. Devil May Cry follows these ideas as well and thanks with a strict combo system that depending on a certain rank you have, you can actually start to damage some of the enemies. Metal Gear Rising teaches you to play offensively and still read the foe so that you can parry and get right back into your attacks. The Yakuza franchise has open combat and teaches you to store energy and use the environment around you. While action games can be hard to get into, I feel that is a massive appeal to them because when you master them, you can start to have more fun with the combat. Then thanks to multiple methods of mastering combat just keeps opening up possibilities of how you can play and learn. Action games needs to teach people the hard way at times and it’s fine to struggle in the beginning. A game like God of War does not have these factors which makes the combat too easy to learn and yet be a game that is slow to get through.\n\nOverall, my biggest hope for a game like Devil May Cry 5 is that the mainstream audience can start to learn more about the good feelings of intense action. Games like Dark Souls and Bloodborne do well with being known has hard action games. There is no reason why any action game should make itself easier with its mechanics. The only option is to give more possibilities to use and learn because with that method people can find their own ideas. Bayonetta did do well thanks to the sequel it rightly deserved and there is even Nier Automata that even tells a strong story along with rich and open combat. So far Devil May Cry 5 is showing off its flashy combat correctly thanks to many ideas and weapons to use for combos. All that is left to say is that my Devil Trigger has been pulled as I cannot wait to enjoy the rich combat that Devil May Cry has been known for, as I hope many others will learn as well.\n\nNero can ride on his own arm! Who needs Dad of War?!"
