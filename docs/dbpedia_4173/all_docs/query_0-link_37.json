        "text": "I read somewhere that the first director of DMC2 disliked Kamiya's Dante + Bingo Moriashi don't like to write for Dante. And Itsuno wants to exclude Dante from the Story there is an interview with Itsuno in the manga Vision of V he says DMC5 is the story of Nico, V (ergil) Nero but he's not talking about Dante.\n\nVergil had better treatment than Dante. I hope with all my heart that Kamiya gets Dante back and makes a game; Because Itsuno and Capcom are doing ****.\n\nI'm interested in reading this if there's a link.\n\nIt's always best to confirm directly from the staff.\n\nI remember how fans made assumptions that Hideki Kamiya has \"hard feelings\" towards Capcom for \"what they did to his beloved franchise\".\n\nBut when interviewed, he still shows respect for Capcom and will block anyone who speaks ill of the company on his Twitter.\n\nSo yeah, I'd rather hear it from the developers themselves.\n\nThere's also the artbook stuff. @berto posted them a while back.\n\nOdd. I didn't get a notification for this mention.\n\nAnyway. Hate is probably not the right word. God, I hate having to keep saying it like this. I feel like I'm advertising. I made a video a while back and I talked about this. It's not that they hate Dante but rather that they don't know what to do with him. Dante is Kamiya's character and Itsuno's mentioned in interviews how he doesn't want to 'desecrate' the character, but they don't know how to go about making him talk, move or be. That's why they want to shift to Nero, because he is their creation and they feel more comfortable working on him.\n\nOdd. I didn't get a notification for this mention.\n\nAnyway.

Bayonetta feels like DMC's excesses dialed up to 11. So I'm skeptical how he'd handle the storytelling.\n\nBingo and Itsuno's problems with Dante aren't uncommon. They are more present if you read franchises like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, Doctor Who etc. Learning how to adapt to existing franchises is a skillset you learn. It's probably more common in the States than Japan.\n\n“DMC 3” has even been called “DMC 0” at times.\n\nBingo: There were talks of setting it in a parallel world at first, because Vergil being alive doesn’t quite mesh with the events of “DMC (1)”. But Itsuno-san said, “If it’s interesting, then do it and don’t worry. If it has to be a parallel world, then it’s a parallel world.” I agreed, so I went ahead and wrote it that way.\n\nSo at some point, DMC3 could have been an alternate reality or even a reboot....?"
