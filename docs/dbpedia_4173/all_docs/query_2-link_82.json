        "text": "Devil May Cry is one of the biggest gaming series that has been entertaining fans for years. Hideki Kamiya developed the action-adventure game franchise. Capcom is primarily responsible for its development and distribution. The series revolves around the demon hunter Dante and his endeavors to stop several demon invasions of Earth. Hideaki Itsuno designed the games, and Bingo Morihashi wrote the scripts. Devil May Cry 5 was published on March 8, 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe series has been a success; the major entries have sold 29 million copies worldwide and garnered Capcom’s Platinum Title award. The series released the first three Devil May Cry games for PS2, PC, and Nintendo Switch. They released Devil May Cry 3 and 4 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, and according to the designer of the game Hideaki Itsuno that was the nightmare for the series.\n\nRead More: “There’s been a rich mix of influences”: Not Just God of War, Deck13’s Atlas Fallen Takes Inspiration from 3 More Iconic Games\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHideaki Itsuno Expresses His Disappointment At PS3\n\nHideaki Itsuno is a game director and creator from Japan. He has spent his whole career at Capcom, overseeing the Rival Schools, Power Stone, Devil May Cry, and Dragon’s Dogma games. In a new video interview posted by Bokeh Game Studio, Itsuno talked to Bokeh creative director and creator Keiichiro Toyama about the letdown of PS3 for the Devil May Cry Game. He said:\n\n“It was strange with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 that we could work with so many semi-transparent layers. We could just pile them up to make visual effects. On the contrary, we couldn’t do this from the PlayStation 3 onwards. Everybody struggled during that generation. We felt let down.”\n\nItsuno stated that there was a significant difference between designing Devil May Cry 3 for the PlayStation 2 and Devil May Cry 4 for the PlayStation 3. PlayStation 3 and onwards didn’t allow for easy building-block-style development like the PS2 and PS1.\n\nRead More: Genre-Shattering Facts About Dante, You Must Know Before Devil May Cry Netflix Anime\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlayStation 3 Hardware was Difficult for Developers\n\nWhen compared to other systems, the PlayStation 3 is infamous for its complicated architecture. It was one of Sony’s greatest failures since no one anticipated the corporation to make a mistake after the success of its two prior platforms. One of the most contentious issues among developers is the hardware decisions connected to its Cell CPU, which made the development process extremely difficult. Sony’s decision about its third console had a significant impact on the development scene, as it became difficult to move projects forward because everything creators had learned while developing games for prior systems was rendered useless.\n\nBecause of the PS3’s unique architecture and Cell processor, replicating the system would be extremely difficult, which may explain why PS3 titles are only available via cloud streaming on PlayStation 5.\n\nRead More: Devil May Cry Inspired Lost Soul Aside is On Its Way, and It Is Looking Goooood\n\nAdvertisement"
