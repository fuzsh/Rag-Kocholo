        "text": "Director of many renowned Devil May Cry titles including, Devil May Cry 2, Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening, and Devil May Cry 4 as well as Dragon’s Dogma, and Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen, Hideaki Itsuno is a name well known to many gamers especially die-hard DMC fans. On 31st December, 2016 Hideaki Itsuno announced on his twitter that he will “exert” himself in order to release a new game in 2017. In his feed, he didn’t mention whether or not the game will be a continuation of the DMC series, or a sequel to the Dragon’s Dogma titles. All fans can do now is patiently wait for more news to be announced.\n\nFollow @QooApp_EN"
