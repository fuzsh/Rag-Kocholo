        "text": "{Ruined House, La Guardia, Spain}\n\nIt's time to test the new dungeon.\n\n[ID Create: Demons]\n\nAs I activate the dungeon, I feel the place shifting, and I find myself in a wasteland with only a few dead trees. The sky is full of black clouds and have a reddish orange color that make it seems like it's burning.\n\nThis is the first time I see the world having a change this drastic, normally is just a copy without the people, but this is completely different. The form of the terrain is the only thing preserved, because the mountains in the horizon are the same as in the real world.\n\nThen, a few shadows appears on the floor, and while I summon [Gae Dearg], some humanoid beings with grey skin wearing a black cloak and a scythe emerge from the darkness.\n\n[Observe]\n\n[Observe]\n\nName: First Hell (Pride)\n\nRace: Demon\n\nTier I\n\nPower: C-\n\nI know this things, they are the basic enemy in the game Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening.\n\nThey charge at me, but this demons are to slow, so I simply dodge their scythe slashes and use my lance to eliminate them. Some more keep spawning, but the result is still the same.\n\nThen, I have to sidestep to avoid some kind of green goo that was shot to me. I turn around to see the culprit and use [Observe] on the humanoid creature with light red skin and bandages on its face wielding a bigger scythe than the Prides.\n\n[Observe]\n\nName: Second Hell (Envy)\n\nRace: Demon\n\nTier I\n\nPower: C\n\nSeeing the attack have failed, the Envy lunges at me a bit faster than the first monster with its weapon prepared, but I parry its blade with the red spear and deliver a kick with my shoes coated with wind, but instead of send it flying, the goo in its feet keep the demon anchored on the ground, making it drop the scythe, so I pierce him with the tip of the lance.\n\nI continue defeating more of these demons for a while, recieving a few hits at times, and then a screen pops up.\n\n[New Quest: Coffin to the Grave]\n\nA few demons responsible for the summoning of more of their kind are reunited in the same place.\n\nDefeat the demons Greed (0/3)\n\nRewards: 20 FP, 100 SP, 100 GP, EXP\n\nReading this, I look around the place, but I don't see any new demon apart from the few Pride and Envy approaching. However, all of them are coming from the same direction, so I take flight and head towards the location of the spawning.\n\nAfter a few minutes I see a huge ravine with new enemies wandering around.\n\nThe first type I can discern is something similar to a Pride, but taller and with longer arms, carrying a huge ball in their backs."
