        "text": "Here’s Devil May Cry 5’s in-game description of the Cavaliere, an actual weapon Dante is able to wield. (I haven’t made this up.)\n\n“Cavaliere – a motorcycle fused with a demon that splits in two to be wielded as twin swords.”\n\nWhen equipped, Dante dons two motorbike chassis as if they were chrome boxing gloves. While the description above may say sword, chainsaw is far more accurate. As a combo escalates, the two halves fuse together to form a rideable bike, allowing Dante to power-slide his way through demons. It’s gloriously absurd, as you’d imagine, and stupidly fun to use.\n\nBut there’s more to the Cavaliere than you might think. Behind its ostentatious design lies the essence of how Capcom is navigating its return to the series (the last instalment was produced in 2013 by British studio Ninja Theory) and particularly the character of Dante.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\n“Whenever we start making a Devil May Cry game,” game director Hideaki Itsuno tells me, “One thing we think about is: ‘What new weapons are we going to have for Dante?’”\n\nIt’s a question Itsuno has pondered several times before, having previously directed DMC3 and 4. Fortunately, he’s developed a method.\n\n“The idea you start from is ‘What’s cool to a kid in their early teens?’ So we had the guitar in Devil May Cry 3. Guitars are cool to kids that age, and motorcycles are, too.\n\n“The motorcycle is actually something we’ve wanted to do for a long time. In DMC 2 he rode off into the sunset on a motorcycle, and in DMC3 we were trying to get a motorcycle weapon in the game but eventually ran out of time.”\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nIn fact, there’s an early form of Cavaliere in Devil May Cry 3. “There are remnants in there, “ says Itsuno. “There’s this cutscene where he has a motorcycle as he’s falling down the tower, and he uses the bike like nunchucks to kill some flying enemies. We call that the ‘bike-chuck’ at the time. So eventually when it came time to create new weapons for this one, we talked about how we should definitely do the motorcycle this time. But what is it going to be like? That’s when one of the animators came up with the idea ‘what if it splits into two and it’s like this dual-wielding chainsaw thing?’ And that’s how that whole design started.”\n\nSo even Dante’s newest toy is rooted in the past, guided by the same principles that shaped the series early on. There’s a sense of continuity that was perhaps lacking from 2013’s DmC, which rebooted the character. “At its core is the essence of what people loved about the old stuff,” says Itsuno.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nBalancing continuity and innovation is perhaps the biggest challenge faced by any long-running series with a devoted fanbase. Do you innovate even though it might alienate your biggest fans? To move forward things have change. But Devil May Cry 5 is attempting to circumvent that problem by embracing the design principles that have always underpinned the series.\n\n“We’ve noticed that if you take something away people start to get upset. For instance, we have the Devil Breakers this time, but if we completely took away the functionality that the Devil Bringer had, then people might get upset. People might say ‘I like being able to do that’. So we have that [but in a slightly different form]. We have the wire snatch in the game, which is the same as being able to pull the enemies in with the Devil Bringer.” Old functionality but in a new form.\n\nThis philosophy of adding, giving the player options, directly feeds into the Dante's distinct style of play. He's extremely capable – able to switch fluidly between different weapons on-the-fly (melee and firearms) and between unique fighting styles. One minute you'll be dodging across the map, placing yourself within striking distance of an enemy; the next minute you'll switch style to parry an incoming attack. He feels commanding, and I guess he should – he's been doing this for sometime. Again, there's something familiar but also new and exciting about this older Dante.\n\nI never expected a motorbike chainsaw sword to hold the key to tradition, but having played as Dante, pulled a wheelie into the guts of a towering boss, racking up a load of style points – it all makes sense.
