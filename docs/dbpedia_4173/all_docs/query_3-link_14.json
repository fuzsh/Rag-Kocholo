        "text": "In an interview with Famitsu, Devil May Cry series Director Hideaki Itsuno opened up about the development of Devil May Cry 2. Perhaps the most contentious entry within the series, Itsuno revealed when he initially joined the project. Director Itsuno also revealed that he joined development half-way through the development of Devil May Cry 2. [Thanks, Famitsu!]\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhen asked about his role with Devil May Cry 2, Itsuno said this:\n\nI joined in the middle of development. Development on the title was difficult, and I joined as a Director and advisor in the later half of the development. How I became Director and advisor is a strange story in the first place. However, the development time for Devil May Cry 2 was too short, and I couldn’t make something I was satisfied with.. After the development of Devil May Cry 2 was finished, I asked “Please, let me make Devil May Cry 3.”\n\nHe also revealed that once development on Capcom vs. SNK 2 ended, he was planning on creating an original RPG. While considering a trip to Machu Picchu, Capcom made him the director of Devil May Cry 2. The original RPG he had planned to create at the time was, in fact, Dragon’s Dogma."
