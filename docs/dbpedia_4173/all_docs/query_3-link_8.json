        "meta_description": "1. Stephanie Cheeva did NOT do the voice of Lady because she has an Eastern European accent she cannot get rid of. But she did the mo-cap of Lady, while Kari Walhgren did the voice. 2. In this game, Dante and Vergil are 18-19 years old. Although CapCom confirmed that they're 18 in the manga, they are unsure whether to make the manga canon, or not. For now, it's considered as canon. 3. Cerberus appeared in the 3rd circle of inferno in Divine Comedy/Dante's Inferno, and Cerberus was the 3rd mission's boss in DMC3. Also in the 3rd circle of inferno, there is a heavy rain mixed with hail, and one of Cerberus' heads shoots ice to the roof, which later falls like rain, explaining why he's ice element. 4. Lady/Mary was named after Jesus' mother, Lady Mary/The Virgin Mary. Also, Lady has the name \"Esmeralda\" engraved in both sides of her motorcycle, which is probably a reference to Space Adventure's Cobra's beloved companion \"Lady\", whose original name was Esmeralda. Just like Dante, it was Cobra who gave his companion the name, Lady. 5. Beowulf is a reference to Divine Comedy's/Dante's Inferno's Geryon, who is the angel that carries Dante and Vergil at some point of inferno. It keeps most of the features Geryon had: Shining wings, large body and scorpion's tail. They named him Beowulf though due to his creature concept. However: 6. Geryon is a reference to the horse that carried the dead in Dante's Inferno/Divine Comedy. They have moved the name 'Geryon' to the horse for some reason. Speaking of DMC3's Geryon, they were originally going to add demonic beings/corpses inside his carriage instead of missiles. 7. Jester was originally gonna be named Joker. 8. Arkham's name was orginally gonna be named Hyne (pronounced Hai-neh). 9. Due to restrictions on the PS2's technological capabilities, there could only be as many as the Abysses showing on screen at once in Vergil's prologue. 10. All in-game animation (except the taunts, cutscenes, and all of DMC4) required no motion capture. 11. The Bruce Lee-like taunt that Dante does before he fights Cerberus was originally going to be one of the taunts in the game. 12. At the beginning of the first mission 9 cutscene, they had to remodel/reskin Dante just for it due to getting soaked in blood. 13. On mission 13 after defeating Vergil for the 2nd time, the battle scene when Lady steps in was going to be longer, having Lady fight against Dante and Vergil. Unfortunately, they had to cut it short due to the fact that Lady (who is human) has no chance of defeating them (half demons). 14. Dante's Rising Dragon ability is a reference to Ryu from Street Fighter's Rising Dragon. 15. In Ace Attorney: Dual of Destinies, there is an easter egg where the character Trucy says for Apollo to dress as Agni, and some other character to dress as Rudra. 16. If you reverse the mission start song in DMC3, it turns out to be the DMC1 mission start song. 17. Lady was originally going to have a spinoff game that was going to take place just after this game. 18. Besides Christianity, CapCom uses Islamic references in Devil May Cry 3, which is 'The Door Of Ka'aba'. If you look closely in some missions and cutscenes, you can see the words, \"Allah\", and \"La ilaha illallah\". 19. This game was a bit inspired by the Anime, Inuyasha: - Dante and Inuyasha both wear red, have white hair, have a cocky attitude, and carry a large sword. - Vergil and Sesshomuru both wear cold colours, have some sort of grudge against their brother, hide their emotions, and carry a katana. 20. In the 1st mission 9 cutscene when Lady is in the process of changing her bullet cartridges for her guns, the set of bullets that drop to reveal the secret #9 message also inscribes \"9mm Lucia\". This is an homage to Lucia in DMC2, who was the Leading Lady of the game that came before Lady's introduction. 21. According to the Devil May Cry 3: Note of Naught book, they were originally going to have the Bloodgoyles/Blood Dragons carry enemies:",

This is an homage to Lucia in DMC2, who was the Leading Lady of the game that came before Lady's introduction.\n\n21. According to the Devil May Cry 3: Note of Naught book, they were originally going to have the Bloodgoyles/Blood Dragons carry enemies:\n\n22. In the one promotional art work where Dante's sitting at his desk with his phone, they were originally going to add more elements on his desk such as a pizza.\n\n23. Dante's devil trigger design consists of 3 elements: A cow, a bird, and a locust. The cow's element was the horns. The bird's elements were the eyes, arms, talons, wings, and feet. The locust's elements were the face and body.\n\n24. Arkham's scar on his face was from when he sacrificed his wife, and the ritual went awry.\n\n25. Lady's design was for the purpose of \"Moe\", a Japanese term for \"sex appeal\", or an effect that brings about excitement. Her look was inspired by Julia/Yulia Volkova, of the Russian girl group, t.A.T.u.\n\n26. Devil May Cry 3 was originally going to be \"Devil May Cry 0\", set in a parallel universe after the events of Devil May Cry 1, where Vergil is revived for an unknown reason. But due to the already complicated plot lines and canonizations of the entire series, it couldn't happen.\n\n27. Even though Hideki Kamiya (creator of the 1st Devil May Cry game) left CapCom during production of this game, he still contacted a few of the developers for this game on social media and threw some ideas at them.\n\n28. Dante's bare-torso'd look is based off of a certain trendy look for Japanese and Korean popstars.\n\n29. Vergil's hair was originally shorter before it was tweaked to be the same length as Dante's.\n\n30. The number of Legions that Arkham summons in his blobby form was originally going to be 100, but ended up dropping down to about 20.\n\n31. In the original DMC3 game, when Vergil aids you in the battle against Arkham, you can control Vergil for a slight bit of time when Dante is held in Arkham's deadly grasp.\n\n32. This game is also a 2-player game. How this is done is by equipping Doppelganger, then going into DT mode, and making the 2nd player press 'start'. The only problem is that you have to keep going into DT mode and making the 2nd player press 'start' every time you go to a next area.\n\n33. During the cutscene of Arkham's monologue when he opens the hell gate to the demon world, the bells' ringing are supposed to be the pained cries of the fallen angels attached to the bells.\n\n34. Jester was originally going to be Arkham's subordinate.\n\n35. According to Morihashi Bingo, scenario director of DMC2, 3, and 4, on mission 13 after defeating Vergil, he wanted to show the actual physical transformation of Jester to Arkham, and Arkham to Jester. But due to technical limitations, it couldn't happen.\n\n36. Lady was originally going to be older than Dante and smoke cigarettes, according to Morihashi Bingo. But Hideaki Itsuno, director of DMC 2, 3, and 4 wouldn't accept that because he wanted the game to appeal to a Japanese audience by making her into a high schooler.\n\n37. On the final mission 18 cutscene in the HD version of this game (Xbox360, PS3, and PC), there is an audio error right after Arkham transforms into Sparda, where the audio gets looped back to the beginning of the cutscene.\n\n38. For seven missions, Dante's Rebellion stays in its dormant state, and then transforms when Dante awakens his demonic abilities. It remains in its new form from thereon-out, except in the weapons icon, where it remains in its dormant state.\n\n39. Beowulf's concept was also inspired by the Assyrian and Babylonian demon, Pazuzu, who also happens to be a villain in Dungeons & Dragons, and the movie The Exorcist.\n\n40. Using the same concept as DMC2, the citizens in the city where Temi-Ni-Gru appeared (and where Dante lives) have transformed into lesser demons (the seven sins) due to being consumed by corruption and darkness. The other reason for citizens not being shown in this game was due to the PS2's technological capabilities.\n\n41. Leviathan's insides are connected to the Envy area of Hell, hence why the Hell Envies are common enemies inside it.\n\n42. In Naru Omori's one conceptual renders of Dante, Vergil and Lady, you can see how much detail has been put into their models. For Dante, one detail is the hidden teeth (which people seem to miss for when it comes to drawing fan art based on it), and pubic hair. Other details on him also include slight breakouts/white heads (It'll be hard to show here due to the quality and colour blending that can trick the eye into not noticing them).\n\nFor Vergil, you can see pores on his face. And for Lady, you can see freckles and scars on her legs."
