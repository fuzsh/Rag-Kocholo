        "text": "Despite positive reception from critics and game reviewers, 2013’s DmC: Devil May Cry has always been controversial with fans of the Devil May Cry series. But no matter how you might have felt about the divisive re-imagining of Dante and Vergil, it seems that Hideaki Itsuno approves and he says that he would love a sequel.\n\nIn addition to directing Devil May Cry 5, Itsuno is the creative director behind Dragon’s Dogma, Power Stone. Itsuno also served as director of Devil May Cry 3 and 4, positioning him as a foremost authority on the creative direction of Devil May Cry games. And according to a report from USGamer, Itsuno would have no problem with DmC continuing as a series and would love to see a sequel.\n\nBut here’s the catch: Itsuno believes that it would have to come from Ninja Theory, the British studio that laid the groundwork for DmC. \"It wouldn't be DmC without Ninja Theory,\" said Capcom producer Matt Walker. “So much of the amazing style and substance in that game was only possible because they have such a knack for what's cool.\"\n\nAnd apparently, a sequel to DmC was always of interest to Itsuno and Capcom. \"On the dev side we certainly wanted to and thought we would work with Ninja Theory again to create a sequel to DmC, but that unfortunately didn't get off the ground,\" said Itsuno.\n\nDmC isn’t Ninja Theory’s only success though. Since then, it has developed games like Disney Infinity 3.0 and the critically acclaimed Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice (which has received four BAFTA Awards and three Game Awards). Previous games such as Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and Heavenly Sword were also well received.\n\nLast year, the studio was acquired by Microsoft and folded into the company's Xbox Game Studios, which means if it and Capcom began any conversation about a DmC 2, they would need Microsoft’s blessing to go through with it.\n\nStill, even though a DmC 2 may not be in the works any time soon, it’s nice to know that the DmC: Devil May Cry isn’t the red-headed stepchild of the series that some believe and has the favorable blessing of one of the franchise’s top creators."
