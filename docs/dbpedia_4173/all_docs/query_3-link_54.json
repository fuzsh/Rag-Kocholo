        "text": "The anime world is all set to witness the beginning of the series based on the game Devil May Cry. A new teaser trailer was released by Netflix on Wednesday. Adi Shankar created it, and the South Korean animation firm Studio Mir animated it. The series, however, has no scheduled release date. Fans are eagerly waiting for this widely popular game to have an anime adaptation and are hoping that the series will be as good as the game.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, this could not have been possible without the director Hideaki Itsuno, who was the mastermind behind one of the most popular games of the series Devil May Cry 5. He single-handedly saved the entire series and even the action-gaming genre by making this game one of the biggest at the time.\n\nRead More: Devil May Cry Inspired Lost Soul Aside is On Its Way, and It Is Looking Goooood\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHideaki Itsuno Saved The Action-Gaming Genre With Devil May Cry 5\n\nCapcom’s Devil May Cry 5 is an action-adventure game released in 2019. It is the sixth installment in the Devil May Cry series overall and the fifth mainstream installment. On March 8, 2019, Capcom launched it for the PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One. Itsuno directed Devil May Cry 5, to make it his best effort yet. He attempted to balance the game for both new and returning players by including a variety of difficulties and challenges. In an interview with the Verge, he said:\n\n“I did feel like I didn’t want to have it stop at me. That’s the last thing I want.”\n\nHe wanted the series to go on for generations and did not have to stop at him. He wanted to bring a more realistic design inspired by the RE Engine used in Capcom’s previous work, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Critics praised Devil May Cry 5 for the variety of methods brought by the three characters, as well as the handling of the narrative. Although Itsuno got connected with the game a little late, he developed a deep relationship with the series.\n\nRead More: “Everybody struggled during that generation”: One PlayStation Console Was a Nightmare for Devil May Cry 3\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHideaki Itsuno’s Relation With Devil May Cry\n\nItsuno has been strongly identified with Devil May Cry for some time, even if he hasn’t been a part of it since its inception. Itsuno has stayed with the franchise since Devil May Cry 2, remaking it into an iconic name. He stated:\n\n“I kind of look at it as the difference between being blood-related to your child and raising your child. I might not be related by blood, but at the same time I feel like I was the one responsible for raising it.”\n\nAfter Itsuno worked hard on Devil May Cry 5, the game won multiple awards and sold over two million copies in less than two weeks after its debut, increasing to more nearly six million copies as of January 2023, making it the franchise’s best-selling game.\n\nRead More: Genre-Shattering Facts About Dante, You Must Know Before Devil May Cry Netflix Anime\n\nAdvertisement"
