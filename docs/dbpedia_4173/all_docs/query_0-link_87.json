        "text": "\"Now you've really crossed the line.\"\n\nThe Resident Evil follow-up that metamorphosed into its own IP during development, Hideki Kamiya’s Devil May Cry arrived on the PlayStation 2 to largely rapturous acclaim in 2001. Two years after 2003’s much maligned Devil May Cry 2, director Hideaki Itsuno bounced back with 2005’s prequel, Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening. Such was DMC3’s success that it warranted an enhanced follow-up a year later in the shape of the Special Edition. Leon, Darren Forman, Josh and the Cane and Rinse community speak about the DMC franchise past and present, as well as getting into the nitty gritty as regards to the intricacies of DMC3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition, plus there's also your Three Word Reviews of the game of course.\n\nhttp://media.blubrry.com/caneandrinse/caneandrinse.com/podcast/cane_and_rinse_issue_sixty_three.mp3\n\nMusic used in this issue:\n\n1: Devils Never Cry by Tetsuya Shibata\n\n2: Taste the Blood by Tetsuya Shibata\n\nCane and Rinse 63 was edited by Darren Gargette\n\nDo you have an opinion about this particular game or maybe about our podcast in general? Then why not venture into our forum and leave us your feedback. Whilst there you could also interact with our ever-growing and friendly community, in discussing past, present and future videogames (and lots of other stuff too!) and perhaps even arrange some games with like-minded individuals. Sound good? Come and say hello at The Cane and Rinse forum\n\nJosh takes a look at the origin story of Dante in Devil May Cry 3 (PS2 version):\n\nIf you like these Quick Rinse videos you can find many more (plus a few other bits and bobs) over on the Official Cane and Rinse YouTube channel."
