        "text": "@windleopard I thought Steven R. McQueen and Colton Haynes would be good for DmC Dante.\n\nMalese Jow would be been good for Kat. Lauren Cohen would be perfect for Lady, just give her a pixie cut.\n\nFor Mundus I would've brought in Aaron Eckhart but he maybe too big for a TV show. So I would've used James Marsters.\n\n@Morgan they would ended up inventing a love triangle.\n\n\"The Devil Factor\" has a love triangle between Dante, Helena, and Christie. It's not as overwrought as the CW has done but it still counts.\n\n@Ronin\n\nThere you go. It's cliche but fans can't complain because what do you think Nero is.... XD.\n\nAnyway the CW is pretty bad at these things. I wouldn't pitch a show to them if they were the last network on earth.\n\nI second that.\n\nBonus for the part about The Badlands. I was SO disappointed by the ending.\n\nSo the TLDR version of the thread:\n\nNero is a better fit for the the CW. He's alot younger than the other characters and he worked better when he was more idealistic. So having him start out as a wannabe tough guy/lone wolf and becoming a team player is a good arc for him. The initial plan for Kyrie was to either have her become a villian or reject Nero because he kills Credo. The latter helps sets up a possible love triangle and possible redemption arc for her.\n\nClassic Dante would work better on Showtime or HBO. Lean into the Tony Redgrave era of his life and you have a good Penny Dreadful-esque show.\n\nTony Redgrave should be like this guy.\n\nThe anime has a good setup for a DMC show. Just give it better plots and more interesting characters.\n\n@Morgan he works. You think he could pull off both Dante and Vergil?\n\n@V's patron Yes. But for the live action portrayal, Dante is played by Sean, and Vergil is in Nero Angelo form so he's played by a preposterously tall and broad-shouldered stunt actor in a suit of armor and his voice is dubbed over by someone totally different, like a modern day Darth Vader. One because F Vergil, two because literally everyone will benefit from not inviting incessant fan-tantrums comparing a real life actor to Dan Southworth's VA role and how iconic he is and blahdy blah.\n\n@V's patron Yes.

One because F Vergil, two because literally everyone will benefit from not inviting incessant fan-tantrums comparing a real life actor to Dan Southworth's VA role and how iconic he is and blahdy blah.\n\nIt would be funny if Langdon and Southworth pop up as other characters. One of them could be Grue .\n\nDon't even bother naming the characters. Dan cameos as a snappily-dressed bartender with a few lines or two, and Reuben gets a secondhand cameo as someone watches a video/show/movie he already acted in, or a made-for-the-show advertisement for a fictional product/service. What are people gonna do, get mad about it?\n\nAnyway, Sean Faris as Dante.\n\nLook him up, and thank me later.\n\nI haven't seen him in anything other than Never Back Down and those two episodes of Leverage. He any good in any of the other stuff he's appeared in?\n\nThough I think he'd be better as Nero from what I remember of his character in Never Back Down.\n\nI haven't seen him in anything other than Never Back Down and those two episodes of Leverage. He any good in any of the other stuff he's appeared in?\n\nHe was good in Pawn, Forever Strong, Smallville (he played Byron Moore), Pretty Little Liars, and I haven't seen Gangster Land yet but I'll let you know how he is in that one.\n\nYou have a link to this information?\n\nRandom DMC4 facts\n\nVergil's kid, allright. https://i-h2.pinimg.com/564x/40/84/aa/4084aa887d7338ac1b8865426f75a893.jpg?b=t\n\nIt's this one actually.\n\nthese are the closest I could find.\n\nMy thought that Kyrie was originally a villian was just me misrembering one off the posts. Althought I don't mind doing that myself.\n\nTo me, Nero just came across as uninspired in 4. So I'd have to tweak him if I had to pitch a film or tv show on him.\n\nIronically he's an easier fit for the CW than Dante. He's always just felt like he skewed younger than the others. Plus his relationship with Kyrie feels tailor-made for the CW demographic."
