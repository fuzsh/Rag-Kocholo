When asked about his favorite character, Itsuno explained that it is hard to pick just one. He then went into detail about the development of Nero, which he found to be the most difficult. This was due to wanting a character that would reflect the quality of the series visually, and through gameplay.

However, Director Itsuno then talked about the development of Vergil and how he came to appear in Devil May Cry 3. Itsuno said this:

..Vergil was hard. I wanted to create a rival for Dante, but ran into a dead end. There was a time when Vergil was likely to become a gangster-like character. But this would be too different, so I came up with the idea of the current Vergil by simply thinking Dante is red and Vergil is blue.

He also revealed in the interview that one of the series staples is about feeling “cool.” Additionally, Director Itsuno mentioned that while each Devil May Cry title has a different theme, that sense of “coolness” is what ties the series together.
