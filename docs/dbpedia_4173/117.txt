CAPCOM game director Hideaki Itsuno revealed in an interview posted on Thursday with game news website VG247 that CAPCOM allowed him to work on either a sequel to the Dragon's Dogma game, or Devil May Cry 5, and Itsuno chose to do the latter. Itsuno noted that he already had ideas for a possible Dragon's Dogma 2 when he decided to direct Devil May Cry 5. He added that he is already "gearing up" for his next game project, but he did not specify the name of the project.

Game director and designer Hideaki Itsuno has directed Devil May Cry 2, Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening, Devil May Cry 4, Dragon's Dogma, and Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen.
