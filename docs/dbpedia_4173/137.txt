You can quit complaining now â€“ Dante's back with his silver locks, and he's brought fellow grey top Nero along for the ride. As previously announced, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition will be making its way to the PlayStation 4 this summer, marking the return of the divisive Japanese developed entry over eight years after its original release. But this ain't going to be your standard port.

Writing on the PlayStation Blog, director Hideaki Itsuno explained that this particular edition will feature the largest cast of playable characters in a DMC title to date, with fan favourites Vergil, Lady, and Trish joining the fight. There'll also be a bevy of new modes, costumes, and more, making this something of a definitive edition.

Vergil will be based upon his Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition rendition, but the developer has added in elements from DmC: Devil May Cry. A new 'Concentration' mechanic will make his attacks more powerful if you play "calmly and flawlessly", while the 'Grim Trick' ability will enable you to teleport around the field of play.

Lady, meanwhile, will focus on long-range attacks, shaking the series up, while Trish will place her demon slaying efforts solely on the Sparda sword. "This again makes for a play style that will feel distinctly different from anything that you've seen in the game until now," Itsuno explained. There's a trailer below showing off all of these additions in the franchise's usual flashy style.

We're just pleased to see that that peroxide's been put to good use.
