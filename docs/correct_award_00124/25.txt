The Patrick White Award is an annual literary prize. The award was established in 1975 to advance 'Australian literature by encouraging the writing of novels, short stories, poetry and/or plays for publication or performance'. Rather than being awarded for an individual work, the award acknowledges writers who have made a significant contribution to Australian literature.

White used the funds from his 1973 Nobel Prize in Literature award to establish the philanthropic trust that supports this prize.
