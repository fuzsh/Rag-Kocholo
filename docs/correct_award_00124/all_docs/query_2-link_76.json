        "text": "Dr. E. Donnall Thomas (1990)\n\nThomas forever changed cancer treatment when he pioneered bone marrow transplantation. His most powerful legacy: the number of lives saved worldwide every year thanks to his work.\n\nDr. Leland âLeeâ Hartwell (1992)\n\nBy identifying âcheckpointâ genes that determine whether a cell is dividing normally, Hartwell provided important clues to cancer, which arises from uncontrolled cell growth.\n\nDr. Linda Buck (2003)\n\nBuck did groundbreaking work on odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system â the network responsible for our sense of smell.\n\nBedford assisted public health departments around the nation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the World Health Organization in interpreting SARS-CoV-2 genomic data. He uses powerful computers and complex statistical methods to study the spread and evolution of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, influenza, Ebola and Zika viruses. Bedford and his collaborators have been instrumental in tracking and understanding SARS-CoV-2 in real-time. Bedford co-developed the open-source platformÂ NextstrainÂ to provide a continually updated view of viral phylogenetics, or virus âfamily trees.âÂ\n\nRothâs work has led to major advances in basic biology, some of which have tremendous potential for human health. In particular, his research on induced metabolic hibernation, in which he has reversibly reduced the core temperature of mice to 10 degrees Celsius without loss of life or neurological problems, could one day lead to major breakthroughs for a host of human ills caused by tissue damage from lack of oxygen, and could potentially be used to help buy time for critically ill trauma patients on organ transplant lists and in operating rooms, emergency rooms and battlefields.\n\nFor more than 225 years, theÂ American Academy of Arts and SciencesÂ has been honoring excellence and providing service to the nation and the world. Through independent, nonpartisan study, its ranks of distinguished âscholar-patriotsâ have brought the arts and sciences into constructive interplay with the leaders of both the public and private sectors. The Academy was founded during the American Revolution by John Adams, James Bowdoin, John Hancock and other leaders who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government and its constitution. Its purpose was to provide a forum for a select group of scholars, members of the learned professions, and government and business leaders to work together on behalf of the democratic interests of the republic. Today the Academy is an international learned society with a dual function: to elect to membership men and women of exceptional achievement, drawn from science, scholarship, business, public affairs and the arts, and to conduct a varied program of projects and studies that are responsive to the needs and problems of society.\n\nDr. Harold Weintraub (1988) - deceasedÂ\n\nDr. Leland \"Lee\" Hartwell (1998)\n\nDr. E. Donnall Thomas (1998)Â - deceasedÂ\n\nDr. Robert N. Eisenman (2003)\n\nDr. Mark Groudine (2006)\n\nDr. Linda Buck (2008)\n\nDr. Lawrence Corey (2012)\n\nDr. Gary Gilliland (2016)\n\nDr. Sue Biggins (2018)\n\nDr. Nancy E. Davidson (2019)\n\nDr. Denise Galloway (2019)\n\nDr. Julie Overbaugh (2020)\n\nDr. Steven Henikoff (2022)\n\nDr. Harmit Malik (2022)\n\nTheÂ American Association for the Advancement of ScienceÂ is an international nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing science around the world by serving as an educator, leader, spokesperson and professional association. In addition to organizing membership activities, AAAS publishes the journal Science as well as many scientific newsletters, books and reports, and it spearheads programs that raise the bar of understanding for science worldwide.\n\nDr. Paul Neiman (1990)\n\nDr. John Potter (1990)\n\nDr. Robert Day (1994)\n\nDr. Mark Groudine (1994)\n\nDr. John Lee (1994)\n\nDr. David Thomas (1994)\n\nDr. Linda Buck (2001)\n\nDr. Meng-Chao Yao (2005)\n\nDr. Philip Greenberg (2006)\n\nDr. Maxine Linial (2007)\n\nDr. Denise Galloway (2008)\n\nDr. Gerald Smith (2008)\n\nDr. Elizabeth \"Betz\" Halloran (2009)\n\nDr. Roger Brent (2010)\n\nDr. Robert N. Eisenman (2010)\n\nDr. Steven Henikoff (2012)\n\nDr. Rainer Storb (2014)\n\nDr. Adam Geballe (2017)\n\nDr. Harmit Malik (2019)\n\nDr. Deborah Donnell (2020)\n\nThe U.K.-basedÂ Royal SocietyÂ is a fellowship of many of the worldâs most eminent scientists and is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence. The Societyâs fundamental purpose, reflected in its founding charters of the 1660s, is to recognize, promote and support excellence in science and to encourage the development and use of science for the benefit of humanity.\n\nDr. Linda Buck (2015)\n\nThe Joseph F. Fraumeni Jr. Distinguished Achievement Award is bestowed annually by theÂ American Society of Preventive Oncology. It honors outstanding scientists in the areas of preventive oncology, cancer control and prevention. Presented since 1983, the award was renamed in 2016 in honor of renowned cancer epidemiologist Dr. Joseph Fraumeni Jr., scientist emeritus of the National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. He is perhaps best known for his discovery (along with Dr. Frederick P. Li) of an inherited increased risk of early-onset cancers known as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.\n\nDr. John Potter (1999)\n\nDr. Polly Newcomb (2013)\n\nDr. Beti Thompson (2018)\n\nTheÂ Howard Hughes Medical InstituteÂ is a nonprofit research organization that engages in the direct conduct of research. The institute's original charter states, âThe primary purpose and objective of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute shall be the promotion of human knowledge within the field of the basic sciences (principally the field of medical research and medical education) and the effective application thereof for the benefit of mankind.â\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute Investigators (current)\n\nDr. Steve Henikoff (1990â)\n\nDr. Harmit Malik (2013â)\n\nDr. Sue Biggins (2015â)\n\nDr. Jesse Bloom (2018â)\n\nDr. Trevor Bedford (2021â)\n\nDr. Erick Matsen (2021â)\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute Investigators (alumni)\n\nDr. Harold Weintraub (1990â1995) - deceased\n\nDr. Jim Priess (1994â2011)\n\nDr. Eric Holland (1995â1998)\n\nDr. Steve Hahn (1997â2005)\n\nDr. James Roberts (1997â2006)\n\nDr. Leonid Kruglyak (2000â2005)\n\nDr. Cecilia Moens (2000â2012)\n\nDr. Adrian Ferre DâAmare (2008â2011)\n\nDr. Linda Buck (2002â2017)\n\nHoward Hughes Medical Institute Investigators Simons Faculty Scholar\n\nDr. Jesse Bloom (2016â)\n\nTheÂ Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, or PECASE, conferred annually at the White House, is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on outstanding scientists and engineers beginning their independent careers. The award embodies the governmentâsÂ commitment to maintaining the nationâs leadership in science by producing outstanding scientists and engineers and nurturing their continued development.\n\nThe PECASE is intended to recognize some of the finest scientists and engineers who, while early in their research careers, show exceptional potential for leadership at the frontiers of scientific knowledge during the 21st century. The award fosters innovative and far-reaching developments in science and technology, increases awareness of careers in science and engineering, gives recognition to the scientific missions of participating agencies, enhances connections between fundamental research and national goals, and highlights the importance of science and technology for the nationâs future.\n\nDr. Effie Petersdorf (1999)\n\nDr. Cecilia Moens (2000)\n\nDr. Bill Grady (2005)\n\nDr. Harmit Malik (2008)\n\nDr. Ulrike \"Riki\" Peters (2008â2013)\n\nTheÂ Allen Distinguished Investigator AwardÂ program was launched in 2010 by the Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group, a division of the Allen Institute. The award funds early-stage research that is less likely to receive support from traditional funding sources but has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of biology. The award confers $1.5 million in research support over three years for studies of lymphoma, neuroscience, the immune system, aging and development, and basic biology.\n\nDr. Matthias Stephan (2018)\n\nTheÂ W. M. Keck FoundationâsÂ Distinguished Young Scholars Program is a groundbreaking initiative created to give the nationâs most promising young scientists the resources needed to pursue potentially breakthrough biomedical research projects. Established as a five-year program in 1999, the W. M. Keck Foundation renewed the program for additional years in 2004 and 2008. The program ended in 2009. During its existence, it awarded nearly $55 million to 54 of Americaâs most promising scientists, many of whom have gone on to publish pioneering work and assume leadership positions in their field.\n\nDr. Bruce Clurman (1999)\n\nDr. Christopher Johnston (2020)"
