        "text": "Abstract: As the most renowned Australian modernist writer, Patrick White has been Australia’s only Nobel Literary Prize laureate. Himself a homosexual writer, White had been undergoing the suppression and repression of the then mainstream culture in Australia, and was only able to express his sexual identity and value in his literary works in an indirect and concealed way. The sexual identities in his writings are very often in an unstable and uncertain state of fluidity. The exploration of the gender and sexuality identities in White’s works is conducive to a better understanding of his insights into aspects of humanity."
