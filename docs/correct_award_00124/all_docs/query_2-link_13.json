        "text": "CALL FOR PAPERS: PATRICK WHITE'S CENTENARY\n\nThe year 2012 marks the centenary of the birth of Australia's Nobel-prize winning author Patrick White who died just over twenty years ago. Since his death, White's critical reputation has suffered somewhat, although there are signs now of renewed interest in his work. Cercles, the major French online journal for academic work in the field of Anglophone studies, will dedicate a special issue to Patrick White in 2012 in order to celebrate the centenary of the author.\n\nSubmissions for papers to be included in this issue are called for, especially, but not only, from non-Australia based scholars.\n\nPapers can address any major aspect of White's fiction including, for example, transnational perspectives, regional aspects, metaphysics, myth-making, recognition (including a discussion of the Patrick White award), aesthetics or representations of Indigenous Australians. Papers that address and theorise gender, sexuality and queer readings of White's work are also welcome.\n\nProposals of book reviews on Patrick White scholarship are also solicited.\n\nPlease submit an abstract of up to 200 words simultaneously to both Editors (details provided below) as soon as possible. Full length essays will be expected by the end of March 2012. The Chicago Manual of Style is the guide for referencing.\n\nBesides publishing several essays on contemporary Australian fiction, Jean-François Vernay is the Co-Editor of a special issue of Antipodes entitled Fear in Australian Literature and Film 23: 1. He is the author of three monographs: Water from the Moon: Illusion and Reality in the Works of Australian Novelist Christopher Koch (Cambria Press, 2007) and Panorama du roman australien des origines à nos jours (Paris: Hermann, 2009) translated as The Great Australian Novel– A Panorama (Brolga, 2010) and a forthcoming essay on fiction, literary theory and criticism that will be published in May 2012 by Editions Pascal.\n\nBlog: http://jean-francoisvernay.blogspot.com/\n\nContact: vernayj@yahoo.com\n\nDavid Coad is a Lecturer at the University of Valenciennes, in France. After a doctorate on the religious metaphysics of Patrick White, obtained at the University of Paris III – Nouvelle Sorbonne, he published a collection of essays on Patrick White in 1997. Other publications include Gender Trouble Down Under: Australian Masculinities (Valenciennes: PUV, 2002) and The Metrosexual: Gender, Sexuality, and Sport (New York: SUNY, 2008).\n\nContact: coad@neuf.fr"
