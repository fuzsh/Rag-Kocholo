        "text": "First published in The Sydney Morning Herald on October 1, 1990\n\nPatrick White, Australia's most celebrated writer, died yesterday morning at his home in Centennial Park. He was 78.\n\nWhite was the first Australian to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 1973, for his novel Eye of the Storm.\n\nHe is the only Australian writer known to many readers, in various languages, overseas. They have formed their (often bizarre) impressions of this society from his books.\n\nAt home, he has generally been recognised as the long-awaited Great Australian Writer, at least since he won the Nobel Prize.\n\nAlthough not a popular writer in the ways that Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson are, and though probably many modern Australian novels have outsold his, White was always pleased to find he had sympathetic \"ordinary\" readers(as distinct from academics, whom he scornfully ignored) scattered through the suburbs that he satirised.\n\nThe frequently heard phrase \"like something out of Patrick White\" reveals how widely he has affected our consciousness, and even readers more familiar with newspaper accounts of his latest controversial political involvement than with his fiction were well aware of him as the Grand Old Man of Australian Letters.\n\nPatrick Victor Martindale White was born in London on May 28, 1912, the son of V.M. White. His early education was at Tudor House, Moss Vale, followed by a stint of jackarooing on the Monaro and around Walgett.\n\nHe returned to England to complete his education first at Cheltenham College and then at King's College, Cambridge.\n\nHe travelled extensively in Western Europe and the United States and, during World War II, he served as an intelligence officer in the RAF in the Middle East and Greece. After demobilisation, he settled on a farm at Castle Hill in Sydney's north-west.\n\nHe wrote prolifically for over half a century - novels, short stories and plays - sustaining a level of creativity unrivalled in this country. The variety of his characters and settings, his styles and modes, was prodigious.\n\nEach new work was a fresh and unpredictable departure, but also one which extended, and qualified, his fascination with the paradoxes of human experience, which most often he located in Australia, past or present.\n\nHow well qualified he was to present Australia's human comedy became an issue in the 1950s and 1960s, when he came fully into prominence. Although his first novel, Happy Valley (1939), had won the Australian Literature Society's Gold Medal, there was not much awareness of him here until the appearance of The Tree of Man (1955) and Voss (1957).\n\nPraised in England and the US (where, like all his novels, they were first published), these reworked the staple Australian family saga of pioneering and the tragic inland journey of exploration in a modernist manner.\n\nThis manner entailed a pronounced, if questioning, religious dimension which confused the developing, and opposed, orthodoxies of Australian literature.\n\nFor some who favoured democratic social realism, White was outside the native tradition. For others, White's \"universality\" was a welcome alternative to an embarrassing provinciality.\n\nPersonally, White seemed to be outside the mainstream of Australian culture at that time. Given his background, he seemed to many an Anglo-Australian from the colonial past.\n\nInstead of writing about \"the Common Man\" for an audience of the same, in the \"characteristically\" Australian way, he seemed an elitist aesthete tainted by the misanthropy of modernism.\n\nIt was not until after the war and his decision to return to Australia to live that he engaged fully with his Australian experience. His first truly individual novel, and also his most experimental, The Aunt's Story (1948), imaginatively projects his memories of his Australian childhood and later wanderings in Europe and America.\n\nOn returning to Australia with Manoly Lascaris, the Greek poet he met during the war who became his life-long companion, White, in response to what he felt was the provincial pettiness of local critics, assumed the role of proud Proustian recluse or Joycean exile at Castle Hill at a time when it was a rural retreat on the outskirts of the city.\n\nIn the 1960s, in novels, short stories and plays, he lashed out at what he saw as the philistinism and materialism pervading contemporary Australia, epitomised in the mythic suburb of Sarsaparilla, modelled on Castle Hill.\n\nThis was an extraordinarily prolific period, with the novel Riders in the Chariot, the plays The Season at Sarsaparilla and A Cheery Soul, and the short story collection The Burnt Ones appearing in successive years from 1961 to 1964. The heavily satiric phase in White's writing also coincided with a more general awareness, assisted by Barry Humphries (whom White admired), that post-war Australia was characterised by values that were essentially suburban\n\nWith comic satire, White was relocating \"literature\" (usually thought of as remote, and most often imported) in the contemporary and the familiar. The stimulus his example provided other writers cannot be overestimated: here was the internationally known author of The Tree of Man and Voss, which by comparison now seemed quite classical, engaging playfully and often savagely with the immediate and the mundane.\n\nThis stimulus can be seen most markedly with the drama. After the earlier-written The Ham Funeral was rejected for the 1961 Adelaide Festival, but given a successful fringe production outside it, White wrote The Season and A Cheery Soul (later revived at the Sydney Opera House).\n\nSatiric but also affectionate towards suburbia, they broke with the prevailing realist conventions. In spirit and techniques, many plays of the\"new wave\" dramatists a few years later had much in common with them. In the short story and the novel White was also making writers, and perhaps more importantly readers, aware of a wider range of possibilities.\n\nIn 1964 Patrick White and Manoly Lascaris moved from Castle Hill to Centennial Park. The novel The Solid Mandala (1966) was the last of his\"Sarsaparilla\" books. Sydney and Sydney society provided most of the settings for his next novels, The Vivisector (1970) and The Eye of the Storm (1973), and the \"shorter novels\" collected in The Cockatoos (1974).\n\nWith the move to Centennial Park came increasing involvement in political issues. White's opposition to censorship and the Vietnam War, and his concern over Aboriginal rights and urban development, led to his publicly supporting Labor in 1972.\n\nIn 1974, the year after he won the Nobel Prize, he was named Australian of the Year. After the dismissal of the Whitlam Government, he returned his Order of Australia and became a supporter of constitutional reform and republicanism.\n\nA bitter critic of the Fraser Liberal Government, he soon became disillusioned with the new Labor Government's policies on uranium mining and foreign alliances and supported the Nuclear Disarmament Party instead.\n\nOnce assumed to be a reactionary Anglophile, White later revealed himself to be a patriotic progressive. Although his politics were of an idealistic rather than a party kind, they involved a lot of marching and speechmaking, even as his health declined.\n\nHis writing, once hailed or attacked for being more \"universal\" than Australian, also reveals a deep involvement with his own country, its history and potential.\n\nThe major historical conflicts that have provided Australian writers with distinctive themes - conflicts between the Aborigines and white settlers, between the convicts and their governors, between Sydney and the Bush - recur throughout his works, as do versions of his own experiences, all presented with an unprecedented eye, and ear, for social differences and tensions.\n\nIn 1976, White returned to the historical novel with A Fringe of Leaves, based on the story of Eliza Fraser, and in 1978 his return to the stage was marked by Big Toys, a contemporary morality about public corruption focused on the uranium issue (two other plays followed in 1983).\n\nHis autobiography, Flaws in the Glass, appeared in 1981. A merciless, and artful, self-examination, it omits his many acts of generosity such as his support for Aboriginal education, his presentation of a collection of paintings to the NSW Art Gallery, and his setting aside money from the Nobel Prize to establish an award for older Australian writers whose work has not received adequate recognition.\n\nIn Flaws in the Glass White was frank about his homosexuality, a subject that he had addressed in The Twyborn Affair (1979), the novel that had appeared immediately before the autobiography. A text for the post-modernist present, The Twyborn Affair showed White continuing to respond provocatively and playfully to changing social and literary attitudes.\n\nAs ever, White's new work broke out of the categories his interpreters have attempted to force him into. The more fervent, and humourless, have attempted to canonise him as a saint or a sage.\n\nPlayfulness also characterised his 1986 novel, the slighter Memoirs of Many in One.\n\nPatrick White remains the greatest Australian writer to date by far, not only because he produced more major works than any other Australian writer has but also because, beyond that, he transcended the cultural divisions from the past which he encountered on returning to Australia after the war.\n\nLoading\n\nHe was both contemporary and a traditionalist, an Australian and simultaneously an international writer; his works are both local and universal, realist and symbolic, social and metaphysical.\n\nLesser writers (and critics) might see these as necessarily opposed categories. White assimilated them, playing them against each other.\n\nOnce seen as aloof from Australian \"reality\" and culture, White changed our perceptions of these, as they have themselves changed over the long time he was writing about them.\n\nWhite's being here contributed to those changes and to an altered consciousness of Australia. He opened up \"the country of the mind\" and, like Voss's, his spirit is still there."
