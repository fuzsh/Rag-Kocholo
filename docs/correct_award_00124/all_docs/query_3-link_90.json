        "text": "Twenty two-year-old Sydney-born Melbourne-based writer and performer Kim Ho has won this year's Patrick White Playwrights' Award, announced at a ceremony at Sydney's Roslyn Packer Theatre on Monday night — where his winning play, Mirror's Edge, also received a rehearsed reading.\n\nHo's play beat 126 entries to receive the $7,500 prize for an original and unproduced script, established by Sydney Theatre Company in 2000 in honour of the Nobel Prize-winning playwright.\n\nHo, who had a viral hit in 2013 with his short film The Language of Love (currently clocking 839,116 views on YouTube, no small thanks to spruiking by Stephen Fry and Ellen Degeneres), told the ABC: \"It's incredibly humbling and a really big honour to win a prize in Patrick White's name. His politics and work … his disdain for 'flag wagging' nationalism, I think he called it, has influenced my writing a lot.\"\n\nAlso announced on Monday was the recipient of the Patrick White Playwrights' Fellowship: screenwriter and playwright Sue Smith, whose plays Kryptonite and Machu Picchu have been part of Sydney Theatre Company's mainstage seasons in recent years.\n\nThe fellowship, awarded annually since 2011, awards $25,000 to an established Australian playwright whose work has been produced professionally in Australia within the last four years. It recognises the recipient's already outstanding body of work and commissions them to write a new play to premiere with the company.\n\nSmith is currently working on Hydra, a commission from the Queensland Theatre that will tell the story of Australian writers, collaborators, and lovers Charmian Clift and George Johnston, and their much-mythologised sojourn to the Greek Islands in the early 1960s.\n\n\"I wanted to look at creative partnerships, marriages between creative people,\" says Smith, \"and how often the woman's career tends to suffer because the man's career dominates for whatever reason\".\n\nSmith, who made her name writing for landmark Australian series Prisoner: Cell Block H and Brides of Christ, said: \"Writers often feel a little bit cast into the outer darkness. … I think [the fellowship] will just invigorate me, it'll make me feel like what I'm doing is part of a larger piece of creation rather than scribbling away, alone, in isolation\".\n\nHo agreed that the artistic support that the prize represents is as important as the financial boost: \"I think a lot of writers have a tendency towards self-criticism and awards like this give us a lot of confidence to say, 'Oh we're on the right track. We can do this!'\"\n\nMirror's Edge is a complex work that interweaves three timelines between 1851 and the present day, all responding to a single location: Lake Tyrell in central Victoria. The lake is most famous now amongst Instagram tourists, especially from east Asia, for the almost magical way the lake's water meets the sky at the horizon, creating a perfect mirror.\n\nHo says the play \"is about the joys and difficulties of cross-cultural interaction and particularly cross-cultural interactions through time\".\n\nMirror's Edge had a partial reading at Melbourne Theatre Company's Cybec Electric program in 2017 and was produced at the Union House Theatre of the University of Melbourne in August of that year.\n\nHo plans to use his winnings to develop the play further. \"It has a cool 70–80 minute run time and I'm thinking of expanding it out a bit, giving it a bit more room to breathe. … [The award] will fund another research trip to the region where its set.\""
