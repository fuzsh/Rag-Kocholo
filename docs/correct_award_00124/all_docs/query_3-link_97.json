        "text": "For Australian Realist writers (\"Marxist-Leninist\"), White was a bourgeois formalist. For the Leavisites who tyrannised the English departments, he was \"irrelevant\" - but then so, except for Joseph Conrad and D. H. Lawrence, was every other 20th-century writer. For the Australian literary establishment, White was an interloper who had taken on the \"matter of Australia\", but wasn't really an \"Australian\" writer at all. For the first decade after his return to Australia from Europe in 1948, White lived in almost total anonymity in the semi-rural suburb of Castle Hill, outside Sydney. He bred prizewinning schnauzers, helped his partner, Manoly Lascaris, to work a 21/2-hectare farm, and waited; then, between 1952 and 1957, he produced two masterpieces, The Tree of Man and Voss.\n\nHE DID MAKE AN occasional appearance in the review pages, but, until April 1958 - when Voss won the first Miles Franklin Award, and its author appeared in a newspaper photograph flanked by the Prime Minister, Mr Menzies, and Dr Evatt, the Leader of the Opposition, was featured on the \"telly\", and at 46 attempted his first public speech - what we now call the media knew nothing of White. It was not that he did not want attention, and the admiration it represented, but that he feared its effects: on his vanity, which was sizeable, but most of all on his work. And when it came he feared it even more. (It came, he discovered, as a double-edged sword. He was hugely admired - \"Gush\", he called it - but also savagely reviled. After the move to the city at Martin Road, the spectacle was endless: Sydney's very own theatre of cruelty, in which White, out there on the heath at Centennial Park, was at one and the same time a saintly, irascible, grandly suffering old Lear - mad, of course, but always good for a rant - and the mad king's licensed Fool.)\n\nWhen, in March 1948, White and Lascaris settled at Castle Hill, he had already published three novels, the last of them his first clear masterpiece, The Aunt's Story (1948); and he was, in his own mind, returning to the New South Wales of his childhood, as he had reimagined it in the opening section of that book. Thirty years later, at the birthplace of Henry Lawson, another Australian writer and reluctant returnee, he explained, \"Henry, like many others, found he couldn't escape. He was driven back, I suspect, as I was by glimmers of remembered landscape, by scents and sounds from hot days, to childhood, the source of creation, when perception is at its sharpest\". For White, that remembered landscape was pastoral, but in no way idyllic (for two years in his late youth he had worked as a jackaroo on family properties); its social world simpler, closer to beginnings, than the over-refined and divided Europe of the 1930s, which he had watched slide towards the barbarous destruction of Barcelona in 1938, to be followed by London, Hamburg, Dresden, and the organised murder of the Nazi concentration camps.\n\nIt is important, given his later savage disillusionment, to recognise the extent to which, in 1948, after the deprivations and ruins of Europe, Australia presented itself to White, as it did to so many displaced Europeans, as a world untouched, even primitively \"innocent\", a source of recovery and fresh beginnings; in his case, of the sort of recovered experience that might go into the novels he meant to write. To Ben Heubsch, his New York publisher and his mentor in those early years, he had written: \"Rediscovering my home country was an interesting experience and full of nostalgia. I have been impressed by a great many things. The people are beginning to develop, and take an interest in books, in paintings, and music, to an extent that surprises me, knowing them 14 years ago. One gets the impression that a great deal is about to happen.\" It's the last phrase that matters.\n\nSharing his life with Lascaris, whose family had fled the horrors of Smyrna in 1922 to exile in Athens, had led White to identify with the suffering and loss that for many was European history in the mid-20th century. Some of the survivors were now in Australia: \"New Australians\" as Manoly was, and as White felt himself to be. The group of displaced Central Europeans, mostly Jews, who made up his close circle once they were settled at Castle Hill, and who fed his hunger for ideas, conversation, music, were of this kind: the Kriegers, Klari Daniel, later the Fehers. At the same time, Manoly's vision of Australia as a place free of the old hatreds and divisions of Europe allowed White to see in a new light the land he himself had been exiled from - first to school at Cheltenham, then to Cambridge. He turned his back now on the \"mental deadness and apathy\" of England after World War II and the \"jardin exotique\" where the Aunt, Theodora Goodman, began her journey \"into her own distance\", towards \"that solitary land of the individual experience, in which no fellow footfall is ever heard\".\n\nHe was soon brought down to earth. The Aunt's Story established him as a major figure in New York, but what mattered to Australians was London, and London was lukewarm. In Australia itself, the book was barely noticed. Deeply wounded, White abandoned fiction, devoted himself to gruelling farm work, fell into depression, put aside the new book he had been working on, A Life Sentence on Earth, and wrote nothing more for the next three years. When he took up the book again, A Life Sentence had become The Tree of Man (1955), but the belief that life is itself punitive, a slow working, through suffering and acceptance, towards a kind of redemption, remained, and he extended the idea when he saw his own punishment as (a reference to Australia's penal beginnings) a sentence to life in Australia.\n\nMeanwhile, to his cousin Peggy Garland he wrote: \"When we came to live here I felt life was, on the surface, so dreary, ugly, monotonous, there must be a poetry hidden in it to give it purpose, so I set out to discover that secret core\"; and in his essay \"The Prodigal Son\" in 1958: \"I wanted to discover the extraordinary behind the ordinary, the mystery and the poetry which alone could make bearable the lives of such people (Stan Parker in The Tree of Man), and incidentally, my own life since my return\". The Tree of Man is in every detail grounded in a local and experiential Australia, both the landscape, its colours, moods, smells, and the minutiae of social life in and around Castle Hill (or Durilga, as he calls it here, later Sarsaparilla). But the drama, as again in Voss, is an elemental one, and, though it takes place in small souls, is of epic dimensions: the conflict between Man and the Land, Man and Nature, Man and himself, Man and God.\n\nAmericans (Russians, too) see their lives in psychogeographical terms, as versions of the national story, and on a scale commensurate with their countries' \"space\", and American writers, from James Fenimore Cooper and Herman Melville through Scott Fitzgerald to Saul Bellow, have made good use of this. Australians, mostly, distrust such moves. White's triumph in The Tree of Man, and again in Voss, was to write lives that were emblematic of the national story, and to make his stage the whole \"empty\" continent - also to open the way for later writers. It was this that led the Nobel Committee, in their citation, to speak of him as having \"introduced a new continent to world literature\".\n\nRejecting the phantasmagorical narrative style of The Aunt's Story, White adopts for The Tree of Man a direct visual method, though far from any \"dun-coloured realism\". It has the pared-down simplicity of fable, but the vision is non-naturalistic and painterly, in the style, say, of Russell Drysdale - figures spare, angular, isolated, objects all jagged edges - as Voss later, on White's own admission, was \"visually in the Sidney Nolan manner\". In The Tree of Man, every object is inhabited by an animate force, yet every word, every image, seems stilled, as if independently examined and seen afresh. An overmastering \"God\" is everywhere, in the land and its unpredictable moods of flood, fire and drought, in buckets and dinner-plates, in other people - even the most unlikely; in the very spit out of their mouths. \"Each man's life is a mystery,\" White told Marjorie Barnard in 1956, \"between himself and God.\" Behind the close observation, the range and variety of character, especially in the Sydney episodes of Voss, so rich in satire and White's peculiar brand of comedy, lies the mystery of God - His nature, His purpose - and the even greater mystery of Man. In \"The Prodigal Son\", White offered his assessment, after a decade, of the land he had been assigned by fate to make fiction of:\n\nIn all directions stretched the Great Australian Emptiness, in which the mind is the least of possessions, in which the rich man is the important man, in which the schoolmaster and the journalist rule what intellectual roost there is, in which beautiful youths and girls stare at life through blind blue eyes, in which teeth fall like autumn leaves, the buttocks of cars grow hourly glassier, food means steak and cake, muscles prevail, and the march of material ugliness does not raise a quiver from the average nerves. It was the exaltation of the \"average\" that made me panic.\n\nWHITE IS LOOKING back here to the moment of The Tree of Man, but the Australia he rails against is much closer to the world of the Sarsaparilla novels that were still to come, Riders in the Chariot (1961) and The Solid Mandala (1966).\n\nWhite's earliest American admirer, James Stern, in a letter of 1964, detects a degree of anger in these novels, a move towards the grotesque, that he finds disappointing after the grandeur of the earlier books; an early appearance, too, of the heavily judgemental. White defended himself:\n\nUnfortunately we live in black times, with less and less that may be called good. I must reflect the blackness of those times. I tried to write a book about saints, but saints are few and far between. If I were a saint myself I could project my saintliness, perhaps, endlessly in what I write. But I am a sensual and irritable human being. Certainly the longer I live the less I see I like in human beings of whom I am one.\n\nTo Heubsch he wrote at much the same time: \"It is really a hateful country and I think if I were 15 years younger I would go away and stay away for good. As it is I hope to take root in this new house, which will be closer to the source of something I want to write.\" The \"book of saints\" was Riders in the Chariot. The new house overlooked Centennial Park in central Sydney. Of the four saints of Riders, Ruth Godbold and Mary Hare are among White's most fully imagined and deeply felt creations. Of the others, Mordecai Himmelfarb now seems worked up, though the Auschwitz scenes and the Lady from Czernowitz retain their power, and Alf Dubbo, \"the blackfellow, or half-caste\" painter, is at this point embarrassing.\n\nMrs Jolley and Mrs Flack, vaudeville figures whose gentility would do credit to Edna Everage, Sarsaparilla's defenders of Home and Hoover, for whom all is sanctified by cake - surely two of the great comic monsters of modern fiction - provide a chorus for the progress of the Jew, Himmelfarb, towards a mock crucifixion in Harry Rosetree's Brighta Bicycle Lamps factory at Barranugli. History in Australia repeats itself as larrikin horseplay, but is no less brutal because Himmelfarb's persecutor - \"Blue\" of the splendid torso and toothless head, that Antinous of the suburbs - lacks a designer uniform, and no searchlights turn the sky overhead to a cathedral. The effect is of a Sarsaparilla Bosch.\n\nIn Riders, White's fascination with a Blakean God-driven world-without-God is at its most desolate. It is his large attempt to deal with the lostness of the 20th century. The Solid Mandala is similarly divided between the damned and the saved (of the twin brothers Arthur and Waldo Brown, one is a savant or saintly \"dill\", the other a desiccated intellectual and failed writer), but this last glimpse of Sarsaparilla and the older Australia of White's boyhood has moments more lyrical than anything in his earlier books, and in the mandala Arthur Brown dances for Mrs Poulter it comes close to an achieved vision and transcendence. But transcendence is for the few. As for union, the final image - of Mrs Poulter consumed by hopeless love for her husband, and the ungiving Bill contemplating his loin chop - is White at his bleakest: a world where love has to exist on itself alone, and the sadness of the creatures in their isolation one from another is complete.\n\nThe year 1964 marked a watershed in White's life and work. His mother's death at the end of 1963 had made him more than \"better off\" financially and had removed one of his deepest emotional ties and nervous irritations. He could now deal with her in a book. Heubsch, the publisher for whom he had written five novels in the previous 25 years, died in August 1964, and, as Marr suggests, \"a formal grandeur that now faded from White's writing had reflected Heubsch himself\". In October, he and Manoly moved to Martin Road. In the weeks before, White burned all his papers, including the manuscripts and drafts of the early novels. Two weeks later he finished the first draft of The Solid Mandala. This was the last of Sarsaparilla.\n\nAlways impatient and easily bored, White now dropped his European friends of the Castle Hill days: \"I was there at the right time,\" Klari Daniel, who had given him so much for the Himmelfarb section of Riders in the Chariot, warned Maria Preaurer. \"He squeezes you out like a lemon and when it is dry he turns to someone else.\"\n\nThese old-style Central Europeans could not keep up with his new tastes and ideas. He was moving to the Left. His friends now were literary people like the Duttons and Maie Casey, the painters, Sidney Nolan, Brett Whiteley and others, whose exhibitions he followed and whose paintings he bought, the comic performer Barry Humphries, the historian Manning Clark and, as he was drawn back to his first love - the theatre - the young actors who, over the next two decades, became his adopted children, and the directors who successively took on the plays: John Tasker, Jim Sharman, Neil Armfield.\n\nWhite wrote letters to the Sydney Morning Herald defending fellow playwrights against hostile criticism, bought the books of younger writers and sent them off to publishers overseas and influential friends.\n\nThe old Australia he had been drawn back to, and so powerfully recreated, was passing. Australia, like other places in the swinging '60s, was on the move: sexual liberation of all kinds; protests, demonstrations; a mineral boom that saw enormous fortunes made, and development projects initiated that would tear the heart out of the older cities. Values that had grown up as a response to hardship and poverty - a hardbitten stoicism and self-reliance (relieved at times by humour), a hanging-together that could also, as White knew, show its darker side in a clannish suspicion of whatever was \"different\" - had given way to crass materialism, a new openness to experience but also to unrestrained egotism and greed.\n\nOne reaction to this was the plays and novels White wrote in the late 1960s and early '70s. As he put it in his Nobel prize essay in explaining the move to Martin Road: \"I had . . . the conscious wish to extend my range by writing about more sophisticated Australians, as I have done in The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm.\"\n\nWhat he means is big-city people like the society ladies who make their first appearance in the Mrs Godbold section of Riders; the painters, actors and lawyers who crowd the pages of these novels, replacing the \"ordinary people\" of the Sarsaparilla period, who, small as they may be, are touched with a kind of nobility. The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm are overwrought, excessive, unlikeable books, full of larger-than-life (theatrical) characters and grotesques, lurid situations, and an oddly old-fashioned view of the artist as sacred monster; a march of folly in which the traditional decencies have given way to rank opportunism and cannibalistic greed.\n\nA SECOND REACTION, which in some ways grew out of White's move towards the theatre and itself had its theatrical side, was his involvement in the protest movement, beginning in December 1969 with his signing of a Petition of Defiance against the National Service Act - a brave gesture this, that might have led to imprisonment. Reluctantly at first, he became a regular protest marcher and speaker: against the Vietnam War, uranium mining, an Olympic Sports Centre at Moore Park, a monorail; for the Whitlam government after the 1975 dismissal (White voted Labor for the first time in 1972); for peace, Aborigines, the republic.\n\nA grim, Boris Karloff-like presence with a tremulous upper-class accent (he was a nervous speaker), a dilly-bag for his eye-drops, and a woollen beanie, he became a familiar figure on public platforms.\n\nNone of this was strictly political. As long before as 1938, in a letter to his Spanish lover, Pepe Mamblas, he had confessed: \"I have no head for international, or indeed any variety of politics - one is either born to it or one isn't\". His sympathies were always engaged at a human level. His vision was religious. He had the fervour of an old-time salvationist preacher. \"I pray regularly,\" he told the crowd at his last appearance:\n\nI pray that we may care for the sick as human beings . . . I pray that we may feed, not only the starving nations, but the starving in our midst - that we may recognise the needs of our neglected old people and our disillusioned youth - comfort the failed - the humiliated - the deranged - remove fear from the threatened - the frightened - eliminate torture - and see that the poor and blacks receive the justice so often denied them - throughout the world - around Australia - and in our cities with their mix of sophisticated corruption and childish values.\n\nOne other aspect of his public life in these decades was the quarrels. White fell out with all the \"pollies\" he had once supported, because all they cared for in the end was votes and their big-end-of-town supporters. But he fell out with almost everyone: the Duttons, Nolan, Whiteley, Humphries.\n\nBecause, like much-loved children, they had failed his high hopes of them by failing themselves. By not writing the books or painting the paintings their talent demanded; or by chasing success and honours, or wasting their time in socialising, or by changing partners, or taking the wrong side in politics. All these represented departures from the strict standards White set, and which he himself, severely, stoically, adhered to.\n\nMeanwhile the plays and film scripts kept coming - Big Toys and The Night the Prowler (1976), Netherwood and Signal Driver (1983), Shepherd on the Rocks (1986).\n\nA Fringe of Leaves, suggested by a series of paintings by Nolan, begun in 1961 and abandoned, was finished in 1975; in 1979, in a splendid return to form, came the finest of White's later novels, The Twyborn Affair, its first section one of the most moving things he ever wrote and the one place, after the early masterpieces, where he really did \"extend his range\" - his emotional range.\n\nA memoir, Flaws in the Glass, appeared in 1981; finally, Memoirs of Many in One, a last work in which everything that was serious in the early books suffered a final daring transformation to burlesque: not least of all the author, that impossible person Patrick White. The papers newly displayed by the National Library in Canberra record this period well: drafts of the terrible letters in which old friends were finally dismissed, drafts of plays and filmscripts, of Flaws in the Glass, the unfinished The Binoculars and Helen Nell and Dolly Formosa and the Happy Few, and Many in One; recipes; 10 notebooks (1930-1970) in which we read the opening sentences, hastily set down and corrected, of most of the novels: glimpses of the writer's own first glimpse of a new fictional world, the visionary insight and chemical change in him that was a new book. Most moving of all, to anyone who was close to him, under what the Library calls \"Realia\": a beanie, a beret, a pair of spectacles.\n\nRealia. I can hear the hoot he would have given, then the long-drawn-out diphthongs of his mock Australian accent, ree-ah-leeah, at the translation of these ordinary objects of his poor existence into the realm of the iconic, the extraordinary - the glasses he needed for his milky marble old eyes, the beret, the woollen beanie Manoly knitted - exhibited not as objects but (as in \"Australiana\") as the left-over oddities of a lost and now mythological continent. He would have been amused by that.\n\nDavid Malouf's books include Dream Stuff, 2000, An Imaginary Life, 1978, Harland's Half Acre, 1984, and 12 Edmondstone St, 1985."
