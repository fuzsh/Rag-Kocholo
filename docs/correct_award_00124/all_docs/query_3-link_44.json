        "text": "It is 2015 and I am on a panel at the Cheltenham literature festival in England alongside two other Australian writers, Bill Granger and Kathy Lette. The theme of our conversation is Australia itself, our culture and our writing, and, as so often happens when antipodeans try to make sense of “down under” for a British audience, the discussion is halting, superficial.\n\nI am sweating, uncomfortable onstage, aware that although there are so many things I want to say that are critical of my country – of our complacency, our parochialism, our immaturity in addressing the legacies of racism, our sordid and degrading contemporary politics – I am finding myself defensive, even antagonistic.\n\nSign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon\n\nNot 10 minutes ago, while trying to relax in the green room and getting to know my fellow panellists, I had been reciting silently to myself the list of negatives that I felt duty-bound to convey to the audience. But now, in front of the crowd, I am struggling to make myself understood. I am happy to rant against my nation but I don’t want these Europeans to lord it over us, me, we Australians on the stage. I want their continent to take responsibility for the colonial history that spawned us. But I hear myself sounding petulant and feel guilty that I am undermining the good humour of my fellow panellists. I can almost pick up the murmur from the crowd: That Aussie sure has a chip on his shoulder.\n\nIt’s during question time that a member of the audience throws me a lifeline. Christos, what do Australians think of Patrick White these days? he asks. And now my response is immediate and sure. I have only just finished reading White’s The Tree of Man and the writing remains vivid, as if grafted to my memory. I express as best as I can how deeply affected I have been by the novel, that it accomplishes so much of what we writers wish to do and so seldom achieve: the power and intensity of timelessness. It is, I say, one of the great novels, and my statement doesn’t require the qualification of that lousy adjective “Australian”. It is one of the great works of literature. And although I disavow the need for the qualifier, the scents and sounds, the speech and syntax, the brutality and beauty of my continent permeates the writing. I can’t answer for all Australians, I conclude by saying, but I do feel a certain shame that it has taken me so long to come to this book.\n\nI don’t think my answer satisfied him.\n\nMonths after returning home I find myself going back to the man’s question, to puzzle over it and try to make sense of it. By now I am completely immersed in White’s writing. On New Year’s Eve I had made a resolution to spend all of 2016 reading the man’s work. Before this, I had tried to read Voss in high school and, as a young man, had read The Twyborn Affair. I had seen a production of White’s play The Ham Funeral and I had read his short stories. Also while in high school, I had watched the film The Night the Prowler, scripted by White and directed by Jim Sharman. (I maintain that the film is criminally neglected to this day.)\n\nSo it wasn’t that White was unknown to me, nor that I bore him any particular resentment or suspicion. But by the end of 2016 I knew that the man had written three of the greatest novels of the 20th century: The Tree of Man, The Solid Mandala and The Eye of the Storm. In saying this, I don’t mean to diminish the strengths and ravishing literary eloquence of Voss, Riders in the Chariot, The Vivisector and The Twyborn Affair, which I also believe to be great works. But there are novels that in the reading enact a transformation that sees their characters and language become part of oneself, that literally change the way you look upon the world.\n\nIf you are both a reader and a writer, then this transformation initiates the alchemy of inspiration; the structure that a great writer employs – their discipline, their control – and their fierce will to tell a story and create an imaginary world that resonates with the reality the reader inhabits, will inevitably become part of the way you wish to tell your own stories and will influence the way you conjure your own imaginary worlds. Reading a great writer is a challenge because it always makes you want to better yourself.\n\nI wish I had it in me to write an epic such as The Tree of Man. I am grateful to The Solid Mandala for reminding me that the suburban and the quiet can be as transcendent and inspiring as the cosmopolitan and the calamitous. As for The Eye of the Storm, I find it inconceivable to write again about family without thinking of how the structure of that novel allows characters to sing individually, contrapuntally, and also as essential components of a whole. So I am ashamed that it took me so long to come to this understanding of White. And also pissed off: why didn’t my tutors, my fellow writers and our critics make sure I got there earlier?\n\nThis sense of pissed-offness is the reason I agreed to write a short book about White. The question the man asked me in Cheltenham was not disconnected from the halting conversation we were having onstage about what it means to be Australian and how such meanings influence the kind of writing we do. Patrick White, winner of the Nobel prize in literature, is arguably the most eminent of Australian writers but I was able to work for close to two decades as a writer without feeling either the need or the desire to engage with his work.\n\nAs a man and as a reluctant public intellectual, White was vitriolic in his contempt for so many aspects of Australian culture. But he was also unusual in refusing the siren song of expatriation that seemed irresistible to so many artists of his generation. And he was a white man, not merely of settler origins but a member of the “squattocracy”. This must have played a part in my cavalier disregard of his work. I made the assumption that he was one of the “dead white males”, a judgemnt bolstered by the postmodern, anti-canonical, feminist and postcolonial criticism that was beginning to dominate literary criticism and the academy in the 1980s, when I was a university student. That was, of course, the question beneath the question, the real question, that the man from the audience was posing: What does Patrick White’s work mean to us now? Does it still speak to us?\n\nIn trying to answer this, I don’t want to lose sight of the greater objective, which is to honour the writing itself. But to do that, I have to continue to wrestle with the question of how White speaks to us in the present.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Christos Tsiolkas on Patrick White, the third instalment of the Writers on Writers series, which is out now through Black Inc"
