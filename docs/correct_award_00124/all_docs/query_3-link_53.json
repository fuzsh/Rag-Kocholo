(...) In this wilderness cries the voice of Patrick White, Australian extraordinary, who has quite other, more austere and indeed prophetic ambitions. (...) (H)is failures are certainly the equivalent, and perhaps the measure, of other men's success.\" - David Pryce-Jones, The New York Review of Books (8/11/1970)\n\n\"Patrick White is a strongly individual, richly gifted, original and highly significant writer whose powers are remarkable and whose achievement is large. His art is dense, poetic, and image-ridden. It is always a substantial and genuine thing. At its finest it is one which goes beyond an art of mere appearances to one of mysterious actuality.\" - William Walsh, in Patrick White's Fiction (1977)\n\n\"White's corpus deals, in every style from farce to tragedy, with a small number of themes but a vast number of characters. He has constructed a continuous literary protest against materialism and the dullness of realism.\" - Ken Goodwin, in A History of Australian Literature (1986)\n\n\"It continues to scandalize me that cultivated English-language readers exist, in Britain and America, who have never read White and who don't realize that those who have taken the trouble to do so are inclined to rank him with Nabokov or Beckett -- or indeed Faulkner.\" - Peter Craven, Times Literary Supplement (14/5/2004)\n\n\"Readers who want to explore the difficult, uneven terrain of Whites novels should, however, begin with the masterpieces of his mid-career, The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm. These are thunderingly powerful, full of emotional depth and grandeur, epigrammatic and ironic, with brilliant scrutiny of human character and motives. Their intermittent bursts of livid misanthropy come like an asthmatics rasping spasms.\" - Richard Davenport-Hines, The Spectator (31/3/2012)\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nof the author's work:\n\nPros:\n\nSuperb writing, stylistically very impressive\n\nBig themes, comprehensively tackled\n\nRivetting stories\n\nCons:\n\nA very dense and heavy style, requiring both attention and effort on the part of the reader\n\nThe stories are not necessarily fast-paced: often relatively little happens -- though White can surprise you\n\nWith few exceptions his books are dark and sombre (though there is a subtle humour throughout)\n\nAlmost all his books are long\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nthe complete review's Opinion\n\nPatrick White is one of the major English-language writers of the second half of the twentieth century, and still the grand old master of Australian literature. His strong narrative voice and his wrenching tales make him an always fascinating read. White's books evolved from the very traditional to, ultimately, the very experimental. Even in his early work he is resolutely modern, trying to do more with fiction than most novelists care or dare to.\n\nHis novels are deceptive, with their weight and their stories which are frequently placed earlier in this century -- or in the last. White wrestles with the profound questions of our age, never opting for the easy answers (there are no \"happy endings\" or even truly positive resolutions in his work). He gives the reader food for thought -- often, it seems, too much for comfort.\n\nHis Australia may not be the true Australia (he always got a lot of flack for his portrayal of his homeland), but it serves his fiction extremely well in novels such as Voss, A Fringe of Leaves, Riders in the Chariot, and The Eye of the Storm. Make-believe or not (we think: not) it is a very real place, foreign and apart from the general locales of modern fiction but just as useful and ably serving his purposes.\n\nMore than anything White is a pleasure to read. His style -- careful, solid, but also very daring -- is captivating, and the reader can never be certain of what will come next. Willing to learn, adapt, and experiment, White's work continued to evolve, peaking not once but several times.\n\nAn eminently worthy Nobel laureate, he deserves a large audience. He is a demanding writer, but worth the effort.\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\nPatrick White:\n\nPatrick White at books and writers\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1973 - Press Release\n\nPatrick White's Books at the complete review:\n\nThe Aunt's Story (A-)\n\nBig Toys (B)\n\nThe Cockatoos (B+)\n\nThe Eye of the Storm (A)\n\nA Fringe of Leaves (B)\n\nThe Hanging Garden (A-)\n\nHappy Valley (B+)\n\nThe Living and the Dead (B+)\n\nMemoirs of Many in One (B)\n\nPatrick White Speaks (C+)\n\nRiders in the Chariot (A)\n\nSignal Driver (B)\n\nThe Solid Mandala (A-)\n\nThree Uneasy Pieces (A-)\n\nThe Twyborn Affair (A-)\n\nThe Vivisector (B+)\n\nVoss (A+)\n\nOther books of interest under review:\n\nSee Index of Australian and NZ literature\n\nSee Index of Books by Nobel laureates under review\n\nIndex of other Author Pages at the complete review\n\nReturn to top of page.\n\n© 1999-2021 the complete review\n\nMain | the New | the Best | the Rest | Review Index | Links"
