        "text": "Established by Patrick White following his Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973 for authors who have made a significant but inadequately recognised contribution to Australian literature.\n\nNovel that chronicles the Parker family over the decades during which their farm becomes part of Sydney's suburban expansion.\n\nNovel of four people who realised they share the same vision of the title.\n\nNovel based on the survival of a woman after a shipwreck. It reflected the experience of Eliza Fraser and the wrecking of the Stirling Castle off the Queensland coast in 1836.\n\nOne of Sydney's oldest law firms, Allens has been part of the legal, commercial and architectural history of the city.\n\nFounded by the Spanish and Portuguese residents of Darlinghurst in the late nineteenth century, bodegas operated as wine bars throughout the twentieth century, coming into their own as postwar migrants looked for food and wine from home.\n\nOriginally Dharug country, the area that became Castle Hill was granted to settlers in the 1790s and some set aside for the Government Farm in the 1800s. Sydney's only convict rebellion started there in 1804. Farming gave way to orchards and later market gardens. By the 1960s Sydney was encroaching, and Castle Hill has since turned into a residential suburb.\n\nSydney's pre-industrial culture was comprehensive and public, and most European inhabitants were players, performers or spectators. After 1850, distinct but overlapping cultures emerged, imported and adapted from Europe and America. New forms of cultural transmission after World War I enabled the elaboration of new cultures based on ethnicity, age and gender, which have combined to produce Sydney's cultural diversity.\n\nLong demonised and persecuted, gay men have been part of Sydney life since first settlement. Two centuries have seen attitudes and perceptions change dramatically.\n\nTraditionally owned by the Dharug people, Laughtondale was named after John Laughton, who jumped ship in Sydney and became a boatbuilder and orchardist.\n\nWriting in and about Sydney started with letters, journals and official reports, but has grown to encompass every genre of literature.\n\nThe long and varied cultural history of the Paris Theatre, home to movies, vaudeville, cabaret, 'revues' and drama, gives an insight into the ups and downs of theatre and cinema life in Sydney over the twentieth century.\n\nThe process of suburbanisation is arguably one of the most important developments in Sydney's post-invasion history. Kilometres of suburbs have for decades dominated the physical evolution of Sydney and its ideological underpinnings.\n\nWestern Sydney is a region of great diversity and complexity: a patchwork of cultures, language, ethnicity, personal histories, religion, education, income and status. On the rural foundation of the large estates granted to early settlers, development in the twentieth century has proceeded in waves, with infrastructure and facilities generally lagging behind population growth. Despite ethnic complexity and socio-economic disadvantage, the region has maintained a sense of stability and social cohesion.\n\nWhen builders labourers, organised by their union, refused to work on projects they found socially or environmentally undesirable, in Sydney in the 1970s, they started a new form of environmental activism. The Green Bans were to change the way Sydney developed\n\nKings Cross exists in Sydney's imagination as much as it does in any physical form, and pinning down its geographical boundaries is difficult. It has loomed large in Sydney's culture since the first houses were built nearby in the 1830s, and continues to attract tourists and Sydneysiders alike.\n\nSydney's monorail was opposed from the moment its construction was announced. Derided as an eyesore and an ineffective solution for Sydney's growing transport needs, the passing of the monorail attracted over 1500 passengers for its final journey in July 2013. We explore the history of the monorail Sydney-siders loved to hate.\n\nFor a century the Mitchell Library has been Sydney's memory, a storehouse of treasures and a club of eccentric scholars. It is all but impossible to write or read about the history of Australia, the Pacific and the Antarctic without being in debt to the great collector and eccentric recluse David Scott Mitchell.\n\nSumner Locke Elliott, actor, playwright and novelist, lived in Sydney until 1948 and thereafter in the United States. In the 1960s after a successful career as a playwright he decided to reinvent himself as a novelist and of his ten novels five are based on his life in Sydney between the 1920s and 1940s. He won the Miles Franklin Award in 1963 and the Patrick White Award in 1977."
