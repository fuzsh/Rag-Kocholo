Patrick White History Education Scholarships (2)\n\nJ. Patrick White (1926-2006) began teaching American constitutional law and politics at the NIU Department of History in 1961. His interests in this field centered on the role of judges and courts as policymakers in a democratic society. While at NIU White also served in a number of administrative positions, among them director of Foreign Study programs and assistant chair of the Department of History. In more than thirty years at NIU his dedicated style of teaching influenced the careers of numerous students, and he received the NIU Excellence in Teaching Award in 1986. Patrick White generously contributed to many educational efforts, and when he retired from NIU in 1993 he established and funded an endowment through the NIU Foundation to provide financial assistance to students in the teacher certification program. The J. Patrick White History Education Scholarships recognize teacher certification candidates in History and the Social Sciences at the beginning of student teaching who have exhibited excellence in their discipline, curriculum planning, scholarship, and potential as a teacher. The scholarships are awarded for the semester of student teaching.\n\nMonetary Award: multiple awards, $300-$3000\n\nEligibility: Students admitted to the Educator Licensure Program, completing all requirements\n\nApplication: Student must be nominated by the Teacher Certification Program\n\nDeadline: Nominations are made during the fall and spring semesters.\n\nOscar Matasar History Scholarship\n\nOscar Matasar (1915-1996) was an alumnus of the NIU Department of History. After finishing high school he had to work for two years in order to finance his further education. Mr. Matasar's ambition was to become a teacher of history. He began his studies at NIU in 1939, and after serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, returned to NIU to complete his degree. He received an M.A. in Latin American history from the University of New Mexico and went on to become a high school history teacher for almost thirty years. Oscar Matasar cared deeply about education, social responsibility, and altruism. He volunteered his talents and contributed generously to many causes, especially adult education. The scholarship in his honor is given to recognize a student of high academic achievement with financial need. Students from a non-traditional background or those belonging to an underrepresented group are especially encouraged to apply.\n\nMonetary Award: $1000 and a book prize\n\nEligibility: Undergraduate history majors who have completed at least six hours of history courses at NIU, financial need\n\nApplication: Students who wish to apply should submit the application form, two letters of recommendation by Department of History faculty submitted by the letter writer to history@niu.edu, and a two to three page personal statement to the department office at history@niu.edu. The personal statement should explain how and why the student became interested in history, career goals, or any other information the applicant feels important to be considered. Applicants should also demonstrate financial need. Students may also apply through MyScholarships.\n\nMarvin Rosen Undergraduate Scholarship\n\nThis scholarship is given in honor of Marvin Rosen (1934-2001), who taught history at NIU for almost forty years, and who was known for his strong dedication to teaching and connecting with students, especially undergraduates. Rosen's ability to engage students sometimes involved delivering impassioned lectures standing atop his desk, and unapologetically standing by his often non-conformist views without ever expecting students to agree, but challenging them to examine their own beliefs instead. His dedication to mentor student's interests and achievements in history went far, in one case as far as claiming not to be able to drive, so that he could hire a student as his chauffeur and thus provide him with financial assistance as he continued to educate him on the road. The Department of History established an endowment in Marvin Rosen's memory that honors his spirit as a teacher and recognizes a student whose desire to learn history extends beyond the classroom. Students who recently developed a strong interest in history, and especially freshmen and sophomores in survey classes, who show motivation and initiative to be challenged further by more intense study of historical questions, and whose academic record speaks to these developments, are encouraged to apply.\n\nMonetary Award: $500\n\nEligibility: Undergraduate history majors or minors who have completed at least six hours of history courses at NIU\n\nApplication: Students who wish to apply should submit the application form, one letter of recommendation by a Department of History faculty submitted by letter writer to history@niu.edu, and a 500-750 word personal statement to the department office at history@niu.edu. The personal statement should explain how and why the student became interested in history, career goals, or any other information the applicant feels important to be considered. Applicants may also apply through MyScholarships.\n\nJames P. and Mary Clare Sczepaniak Scholarship\n\nMonetary Award: $250 per awardee renewable up to three times. Up to three awards will be made per academic year. Funds are subject to availability.\n\nEligibility: To qualify for this scholarship, initial applicants must be undergraduate history majors who have completed at least 15 but no more than 45 total credit hours and have a 2.75 or higher cumulative undergraduate GPA.\n\nApplication: Students who wish to apply should submit the application form and a one page personal statement in a PDF format to history@niu.edu. The personal statement should explain how and why the student became interested in history, outline career goals, address financial need, and provide any other information the applicant believes to be relevant to the application.

The letter of recommendation should be submitted by the letter writer directly to the department in electronic format to history@niu.edu.\n\nRenewals: Candidates for renewal will be reviewed by the department each spring. Renewals will be based on maintaining a 2.75 GPA and demonstrating progress towards the degree. The department may ask for additional materials as necessary.\n\nAnita M.
