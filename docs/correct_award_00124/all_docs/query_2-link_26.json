        "text": "HAPPY BIRTHDAY – Patrick White, born 28 May 1912\n\n“To understand the stars would spoil their appearance.”\n\nPatrick White was born in England, but came to Australia when still a baby. He was the first Australian novelist to win the Nobel Prize for Literature and he was awarded many other honours during his life.\n\nHe is considered the greatest writer of 20thC Australia and I always feel I ought to like his novels, but I don’t! I found Tree of Man dull and I never cared for a single one of its characters, nor did I enjoy Voss or The Eye of the Storm. Perhaps I am missing something vital, and maybe on his birthday I should be giving his works another go? If you are a huge Patrick White fan, tell me what I am missing and why I should be reading his books?\n\nPatrick White died on 30 September 1990, aged 78.\n\nI believe the best biography is Patrick White by David Marr.\n\nShare your thoughts in the comment area below.\n\nThe Tree of Man by Patrick White\n\nVoss by Patrick White\n\nThe Eye of the Storm by Patrick White\n\nPatrick White: A life by David Marr\n\nI only recommend books I have read and know.
