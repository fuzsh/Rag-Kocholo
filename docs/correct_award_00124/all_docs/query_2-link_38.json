        "text": "January 25, 2022\n\nChristos Tsiolkas gives his insights to Patrick White writings in his On Patrick White novella. This series of Writers on Writers by one Australian on another’s works raises a variety of insights – so in essence you get two for the price of one. Interestingly, Christos starts by contrasting their divergent cultural backgrounds, with his Greek peasant ancestry and White’s landholding white Australian squattocracy. Yet he also acknowledges the influence of White’s life partner Manoly Lascaris, a former Greek army officer. In discussing White’s works, Christos discussion includes aspects of landscape, spirituality, sensuality, exile, migrants, emptiness of Australia and the progressive movements he supported. Tsiolkas comprehends the nuances of Patrick White and his most significant contribution to literature, that includes a Nobel Prize for Literature. A concise analysis of White’s works makes this a four-star read rating. Given there are more titles, over time they too will be enjoyed.\n\nAugust 6, 2023\n\nAn interesting, brief discussion of Patrick White’s nine novels. Tsiolkas states that White wrote three of the greatest novels of the twentieth century, ‘The Tree of Man’, ‘The Solid Mandala’,and ’The Eye of the Storm’. He provides short quotes from a number of the novels, making some interesting observations about each of the novels.\n\nHe concludes this short book by stating, “Patrick White, accused of misogyny and misanthropy but the writer of some of the greatest female characters in fiction. Patrick White, the child of a long-vanished squattocratic past, whose sympathy lay with the migrant and the outsider and who made these outsiders the centre of his fiction…” (page 90, Black Inc edition).\n\nThis book was first published in 2018.\n\nPatrick White won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1973. The only Australian to win this prize.\n\nSeptember 29, 2018\n\nMy rating here is quite biased: I am totally in favour of anyone who praises and recommends the novels of Patrick White.\n\nThis book is one of the Writers on Writers series in which leading Australian writers reflect on another Australian writer who has inspired and fascinated them. Christos Tsiolkas, one of Australia’s more successful writers in a number of fields, has a Greek migrant background, and his particular insights sheds new ways of appreciating White and his work. His re-reading of a number of White’s works sheds new light on aspects both of his contribution to Australian and world literature, both when they were written, and now.\n\nThe main theme one finds over and over again in White’s novels concentrates on individuals who inhabit “strange” worlds which are very much their homelands but in which they are actually, or perceive themselves to be, more peripheral, like outsiders. These individuals are of many types, loved/hated, creative/destructive, cherished/despised, intelligent/ignorant, simple/complicated, gender-specific/gender-fluid, etc. often with no discernible unifying quality except one: the ability to encounter strange mystical experiences where their individuality is central and not peripheral, and with which they are familiar but do not necessarily understand.\n\nTsiolkas rightly sees a connection here with the Australian, and increasingly global, reality of a significant element of the migrant experience, and also gives proper recognition to the influence of White’s lifelong companion Manoly Lascaris in this achievement. The image of individual suffering and humanism suffused with exalted mystical insight is both stunning and humbling at the same time.\n\nThis is an excellent introduction for those not familiar with White’s works, and a valuable reminder that we should never take for granted what we have in them — something to cherish for ourselves and to share with the world.\n\n[Note to the publisher: My copy of this book contains 95 pages of large, wide-spaced text, yet within these few pages, I discovered a number of typos regarding the titles of some of Patrick White’s novels. As far as I can tell, The Aunt’s Story managed to get through relatively unscathed, except for p. 10, where it appears incorrectly as An Aunt’s Story. On p. 43, there is a reference to the non-existent play A Night in Sarsaparilla; this could be a reference to Night on Bald Mountain, but I suspect it really should be A Season at Sarsaparilla. Finally, White’s first book Happy Valley was unfortunately given the wrong title The Happy Valley in all of its six mentions in the text: p.17, p.18 (twice, once in the text, once in the footnote), p.22, p 24, and p.90. Not good enough!]\n\nMarch 17, 2020\n\nPatrick White is one of my favourite authors and the effect of reading this was to bring his works back to life in my memory and now I want read them all over again. All of them. Tsiolkas took me to the heart of White's particular voice as only one who can really connect with this prickly, complex, lyrical, powerful and deeply humane writer can. Personally I think making a reader want to read or reread the writer written about is the best thing a critical or literary analysis or reading experience or biographical work can do. This is a very satisfying mix of all these responses.\n\nJanuary 19, 2019\n\nEven though I don’t read that many books by men, I’m a Tsiolkas completist and I am currently trying to make my way through all of Patrick White’s novels too. This book was an easy, satisfying, nourishing read for that reason. I did get confused by the timeline and the structure didn’t quite coalesce for me, but it was a decent long form essay regardless.\n\nMarch 16, 2023\n\nChristos Tsiolkas’s take on Patrick White is intelligent and perceptive, and highly readable. He covers most of the important works and clearly admires the great novelist. His critique of The Tree of Man, for which White won the Nobel Prize, is just about perfect summed up as ‘the power and intensity of timelessness’.\n\nTsiolkas gives the reader an interesting anecdote about his time at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in the UK where feels defensive on behalf of Australia when he calls The Tree of Man ‘one of the great novels’ that does not ‘require that lousy adjective “Australian”. This is such a pedantic and perplexing, even contradictory statement, by one who says he felt shame for taking such a long time to read this book.\n\nPatrick White helped define the term ‘cultural cringe’ and he certainly understood it because it seeps through the pores of his writing, as surely as the themes of his writing were conditioned by his sense of place. The disavowal of the qualifier, “Australian” by Tsiolkas is almost insulting because without the enhancement of this adjective we do not identify ourselves.\n\nFinally, l take umbrage to Tsiolkas using the qualifier, “mongrel” to refer to Australia as a ‘mongrel nation’. We are a rich nation of many definable cultures - indigenous and multicultural.\n\n4 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nJanuary 3, 2019\n\nFinished: 03.01.2019\n\nGenre: non-fiction (96 pg)\n\nRating: A\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a short but comprehensive companion of\n\nPatrick White's best known novels. I would recommend it to\n\nanyone who is about to read White's books.\n\nPatrick White was the child of a squattocratic past\n\n....but his sympathies lay with the migrant and outsider.\n\nThis is the center of his fiction.\n\nHe created an imaginative language that one calls Australian.\n\nMay 9, 2019\n\nI was thinking about Patrick White earlier this year when this caught my eye. It turned out to be fortuitous when we discussed Barracuda in our reading group. Tsiolkas writing about White helped me understand what also drives him as a writer, particularly his interest in outsiders. While he and White have a connection in both being homosexual, Tsiolkas is provocatively ‘out there’ whereas White was discreet about his sexual preferences. In other ways their lives couldn’t have been more different - White coming from the colonial squatter class and Tsiolkas from a Greek immigrant family. However, Tsiolkas also gives a great deal of credit to Manoly Lascaris, White’s life partner, for helping White understand the immigrant perspective and link that to his ‘outsider’ characters. Tsiolkas is passionate about the continuing relevance of White’s literature. His analysis of particular novels and the quotes he chooses pay tribute to White’s genius. I recommend this to anyone interested in writing and particularly Australian literature.\n\nJuly 31, 2019\n\nA timely reminder of the greatness of Patrick White."
