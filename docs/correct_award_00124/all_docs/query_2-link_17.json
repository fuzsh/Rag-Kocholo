        "text": "Reviews From the Archive\n\nAn occasional series, cross-posting my reviews from Read the Nobels, and retrieving some from my journals.\n\nTo see my progress with completing the Read the Nobels Challenge, see here.\n\nThe Tree of Man, by Patrick White, winner of the Nobel Prize in 1973\n\nI am more comfortable about sharing my 2006 journal notes about Patrick White’s The Tree of Man than I have been for some of my other more mediocre ‘reviews from the archive’. I had read PW’s novel before, but these are my thoughts from when I re-read it for discussion in a book group to which I belonged.\n\nIt is not, of course, a scholarly review, nor one with any particular insights. But it makes me want to read the book again. FWIW here it is…\n\n8th January, 2006\n\nThe Tree of Man is a very rich work, deceptively simple in plot, and mysteriously dense in language. I read it first years ago when I was at Teachers’ College, where it mystified us all. I don’t remember now, how much of it I then understood, but I did retain over the years, a sense of the simple heroism of Amy and Stan Parker. What has also stayed with me is a sense of the Australian bush — its vast spaces, its silence, its timelessness.\n\nRe-reading it, thirty years later [i.e. in 2006], there are new resonances. I begin to understand White’s theme of the tension between permanence and transience as they play out in the Parkers’ lives. I begin to understand how both of them are never sure if they love one another but have a long marriage based on affection and habit.\n\nBEWARE: SPOILERS (though anybody reading PW for the plot is going to be disappointed).\n\nThere are many sterile relationships in the novel. Thelma Parker marries the solicitor Mr Fosdyke, for reasons of status. She has no children, only asthma, and as she discovers at the club to which she belongs, she is never really accepted despite her efforts with elocution and the purchase of a ‘crocodile bag’. Madeline Fisher’s family ignore her after Madeline’s death because she cannot ever be rich enough. White is merciless in his depiction of this wasted tragic life, preoccupied with society and appearances and achieving nothing at all, not even attendance at the Government House dinner because her father’s funeral is held that day.\n\nThe imperatives of sex are comprehensible now too, as they were not 30 years ago. The one-ness of young lust and love becomes transformed into a separateness. Amy has an adulterous but brief relationship with a travelling salesman; in her old age she thinks she would have liked to have had many more. But Stan’s only shame comes from the night he found out about this relationship, went down to the city and got drunk and nearly strangled an old hobo woman in his rage. In my twenties, I simply did not even notice the tragedy of this event in their marriage. I forgot about it and read on, absorbing the betrayal as part of things. Just as Stan seemed to, but did not. He remembered it on his deathbed.\n\nThe final scenes are more confusing than ever. I know that there are religious aspects to White’s writing, and I have an inkling that he’s drawing on Revelations but I’m not sure how*. Mrs O’Dowd’s death, for example, is almost comic, with hordes of people from the district there, and almost no room for her husband near the bed. Yet they send for Amy, who has neglected her friend out of inertia, and amongst all the hubbub, and the strange two-page story that is told by the nameless Man from Deniliquin, it is she who announces the death even as the doctor, awash with self-importance, prepares some belated pain relief. He has been out delivering a baby — inverting the words of the Book of Common Prayer in the midst of death we are in life. Amy has been holding her friend’s hand, and felt it grow cold, but in an echo of Stan’s long ago inability to tell about the dead man upside-down in the tree in the flood, Amy could not say anything until she had to. And then she gets up and goes away, leaving the carnival crowd to lay out Mrs O’Dowd and mutter about how Amy Parker had always been stuck-up and had no reason to be.\n\nWhite seems to be saying, however, that the Parkers were private people, bewildered by their own emotions and yet reconciled to events in life that may have crushed others. Ray’s death, shot in a bar-room brawl, seemed almost inevitable to them. They were reconciled to his wastrel ways, suspecting no good of him but ignorant of the details of his life of crime. (Not exactly petty crime either; he’d done time in prison). Amy loved her little grandson Ray, and had a good relationship with Edith, the unfortunate daughter of a Methodist minister who’d hoped to reform him. But she refused even to acknowledge the grandchild Ray had with Lola, his ‘fancy woman’. An unexpected hardness in Amy, or so it seemed to me.\n\nWhen Stan found out about Ray’s death from the newspaper, he didn’t tell Amy, but ‘hoped to put it off for a bit.’ It was Mrs O’Dowd who came to commiserate and found herself having to tell Amy about it, while Stan was down in the city discovering that he had another grandchild, also called Ray. (Rays of sunshine? Light of someone’s life?) This Ray, however, rejected Stan’s overtures, just as Amy had refused to know him. Another parallel, that both these two know important things that impact on the other, yet say nothing about it.\n\nIn our era, where marriages founder daily because of failures of communication, Amy and Stan’s long marriage is a marvel. Their world shrinks as the land around them is subdivided but the rose Amy planted survives, and she even finds the long-lost silver nutmeg grater that she’d thought was stolen. Permanence and impermanence entwined.\n\n* I still haven’t read Revelations.\n\nI finished reading the book and journalled it on the 8th of January, 2006.\n\nAs readers will know from my previous ‘review from the archive’ I am reading David Marr’s Patrick White, a Life. He has a lot to say about The Tree of Man — its gestation; its reception at home and abroad; and how various scenes and characters derive from PW’s own life and experiences, but I’ll save that for another day.\n\nCredits:\n\nThe Tree of Man by Patrick White, Penguin Modern Classics 1961, 1976 reprint, ISBN 0140016570, first published 1955\n\nHello, again, Lisa. I have now finished reading “The Tree of Man”, begun back in October.\n\nIt was interesting to read one of your comments, drawing on the Marr biography, about White’s editors arguing with him over his sentences and stylistic eccentricity. I would have argued, too.\n\n“The Tree of Man” is a book that, towards the end, sent me scrambling back to much earlier pages to review the first appearance, for example, of the silver nutmeg grater, and its loss, when it is found again shortly before Stan dies. Not many writers demand that kind of retrospection from readers: the narrative is usually relentlessly forward. (Elizabeth Goudge, the Twentieth century English author, also requires readers to look back to earlier material to consolidate the retrospective connections.)\n\nWhite’s occasional mention of Amy’s sexuality was interesting, at a time when contraception was controversial, and often furtive. It is clear that she enjoys sex. Her spontaneous sex in middle-age, repeated several times, with the married travelling salesman seems extremely unlikely, as does her reflection in old age that she would have enjoyed having more sex with strangers.\n\nOne thing struck me regarding the progression of time. We are not told people’s ages, so a chronological time-line is a matter of guesswork. But we have the Great War, fairly early in the novel, by which time Stan and Amy are married and have children. Stan enlists fairly soon after the war breaks out in August 1914. He eventually gets to the Western Front. But after he returns, there is no clear mention of the Great Depression. Nor is there any mention of the Second World War. And then Stan dies, clearly an old man, worn out physically.\n\nSuppose Stan is 40 years old in 1914. (If he had been much older, he would almost certainly have been rejected by the Army, although some middle-aged men lied about their age and enlisted.)\n\nThen, in 1939, when World War II begins, Stan would be twenty-five years older — sixty-five.\n\nDying as a man who has lived to a considerable old age, I imagine Stan died older, probably substantially older, than sixty-five. But there is no mention of WW II.\n\nIf he died an old man before WW II began, he would surely have been too old to enlist in 1914.\n\nCan you please shed any light on this?\n\nI put it down to carelessness on White’s part, and wonder if any of his editors noticed the question of Stan’s age?\n\nThanks,\n\nJohn"
