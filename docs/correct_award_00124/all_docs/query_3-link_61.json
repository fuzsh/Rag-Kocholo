        "text": "23 Australian Prose Writings by Writers of European Descent: Patrick White: Voss\n\nDr. Mrinmoy Pramanick\n\nEarly English literature in Australia is significant today for their historical and social value but not for their literary value per se. 20th century observed that the Australian English literature is recognized by the readers and critics beyond Australia. And it is also found that the literature of 20th century is thematically different than the literature of the 19th century. Gradual transformation from rural life to urban life can be observed in the literature of these two centuries. Besides this the concept of cosmopolitanism also has been reflected in the literature. With the emergence of the aboriginal writings in Australian English a new horizon was unfolded in the history of Australian literature and such literatures were critically acclaimed in different parts of the world (History of Literature Introduction).\n\nPatrick White: An Introduction\n\nPatrick White was born in 1912 in Knightsbridge, London, and he passed away in 1990. He born to the Australian parents. In his early age of just six months, his parents came back to Australia. During his schooldays he used to stay in a boarding school in South Wales. White went to England to study literature in the King’s College, Cambridge University, from 1932 to 1935. During his study in England he realized his sexual feelings for the men but like many others he was afraid to express it (Patrick White).\n\nHe is one of the most renowned and well-known Australian author to the world. He wrote almost twelve novels and almost thirty short stories. He was also a playwright and screenplay writer. One of his stories was adapted into film (Life of Patrick White).\n\nHis creation in prose includes, Happy Valley (1939), The Living and the Dead (1941), The Aunt’s Story (1948), The Tree of Man (1955), Voss (1957), Riders in the Chariot (1961), The Solid Mandala (1966), The Vivisector (1970), The Eye of the Storm (1973), A Fringe of Leaves (1976), The Twyborn Affair (1979), Memoirs of Many in One (1986), The Hanging Garden (2012) and collections of short story are The Burnt Ones (1964), The Cockatoos (1974), Three Uneasy Pieces (1987), and an autobiography Flaws in the Glass (1981)1. Besides this he wrote quite a good number of poems and few plays as we mentioned earlier.\n\nPatrick won several prestigious awards for his different literary contributions. It is worth to mention that he is the only Nobel Laureate from Australia till date. His work Voss was recognized by the government of Australia for the first time and he was awarded Miles Franklin Literary Award, same award again went to Patrick for his another novel Riders in the Chariot, and again further in 1968 for his book The Vivisector. A new horizon was introduced to the Australian literature observed a path breaking experience when Patrick was honoured with the Nobel Prize in 1973 for his contribution in literature. White was identified as “Existential Explorer” and a statement was made by Karin Hansson on the comment of the Nobel committee on Patrick’s works which is, “When Patrick White was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1973, the Swedish Academy’s commendation referred to the author’s epic and psychological narrative art as having introduced a new continent into literature” (Hansson, Karin;). Patrick’s art of storytelling and his historical importance as the most prominent author of the continent who made the continent to get a permanent position in the map of the world of literature.\n\nIn the article posted on the site of the Nobelprize.org, Karin Hansson historicise Patrick’s works and divides works in several parts. It is argued that Patrick carries the legacy of both the Europe and the Australia. A wide experience of his living in different parts of the world including Middle East and Greece brought different world views into his writings. One side he was influenced by his knowledge and study of literature in Europe another side he was also influenced by his experiences in staying in Middle East and Greece as a serviceman. His stay in Middle East and Greece made him remind about his own country Australia (Hansson, Karin;). According to Karin Patrick was very much influenced by European epic style, Greek mythology and Judeo-Christian mysticism, psycho analysis of C.G. Jung and the thought of stream of consciousness being influenced by James Joyce. Karin divides his literary life in several parts, as we mentioned earlier. According to Karin, first phase of Patrick’s writer’s life includes the books like The Aunt’s Story and The Tree of Man, the second phase of his literary life includes Voss, Riders in the Chariot, and The Solid Mandala. The third phase of his literary career is divided on The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm. A Fringe of Leaves and The Twyborn Affair are included in the last phase of his literary life by the critic Karin (Hansson, Karin;).\n\nPatrick White: Prose Writing\n\nPatrick was very much interested and he had his own experience with the nature and rural life, which have been portrayed in his The Aunt’s Story (1948) and The Tree of Man (1955). The Tree of Man received wider reception from the Europe. Karin Hansson mentions that, these two novels focused on the humanity and this is for the first time. Themes like madness and sanity, reality and illusion, communication and existential questions are addressed in these novels (Hansson, Karin;). In later phase, in Voss, Riders in the Chariot, and The Solid Mandala, according to Karin, we find novels based on more than one central characters or protagonist; whereas in the first phase novels were written based on one protagonist. White always addresses contrast and contradiction from his position in his writing. One side he talks about humanity and man’s power and in other novel he speaks about divinity and high spirituality with mysticism. The third phase of his writing included novels like The Vivisector and The Eye of the Storm is quite interesting. These two novels are based on the single protagonists but all of them are ‘dominated by the image of the Eye, which is given a multidimensional function’ (Hansson, Karin;). These three phases of White’s writing shows how much involved he was with his narrative and style of writing and making of his characters. These initiatives are changed in every phases and each phase of writing has its own distinctiveness. In the last phase he includes two novels, like A Fringe of Leaves and The Twyborn Affair where protagonists or central characters are achieving self-discovery (Hansson, Karin).\n\nPatrick reflected the conflict between an individual and the universe in his different writings. He portrays the tragedies of life in different contexts in different writings. The man was observed in his writings as a very micro unit in the context of the universe where the man is negligible creature almost. White adopted Australian aboriginal myths in his several writings. Being mystic he presented his experience of God-Man relation into his literature.\n\nPatrick White like Christina was a modernist writer who refused the nationalistic approach in literature along with the use of bush myths. He even refused realism as a method of writing literature or as an idea of writing literature. Some of the critics comment that White used a postmodern narrative style of self-reflexivity ( POSTMODERNISM IN AUSTRALIAN LITERATURE ).\n\nTo know White, is to know the historical and political and philosophical complexities in intellectual thoughts of the literature of Australia. White throughout his life, through his writings addressed different kinds of complexities prevailed in the culture, society and mind. His extensive experiences of travelling across the continents brought different worldviews, even simultaneously many worldviews in a same novel. Moreover, we can find an ontological reading with this novel that is in 20th century, in Australia, Europeans and Australians stay together, and this is the nature of 20th century. Fighting against colonial hegemony is reconstructing own identity stronger but not fighting against the culture and people of European descent. If we read Kari Hulme’s renowned book The Bone People, we can see her deepest respect to this pre-given but modern context of a nation where voice of resistance will be there but not the cultural hatred as the coexistence is reality and better culture dialogue has to be made together by the equal and sustainable living of the people.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this module we have learnt about Australian prose tradition and we have discussed very briefly in the growth and development about the English literature in Australia. We have tried to historicise Patrick White in the very context of the Australian English literature. His contribution in literature, influence and reception also are discussed here. Nobel Prize related articles are referred here in this module to get glimpses about the reception of the author among the wider readers’ world as well as White’s reception in the sphere of critical thoughts and intellectual writings on literature. We have briefly discussed about White’s writing style and common contexts and characteristics of his writings. Patrick’s novel Voss is discussed here especially with the reference of his other novels and writings. Students may follow the list of sources in reference section and also the further list section. The module’s aim is to make student more interested in the topic.\n\nyou can view video on Australian Prose Writings by Writers of European Descent: Patrick White: Voss\n\nReferences:"
