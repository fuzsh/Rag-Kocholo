        "text": "SOURCE: GREEKHERALD\n\nMinimalist poet, Antigone Kefala, has been announced as the winner of the 2022 Patrick White Literary Award for her contribution to Australian literature.\n\nThe award, presented by Perpetual, recognises Kefala’s achievements as a poet, and a writer of fiction and non-fiction.\n\n“I am full of admiration for Patrick White, and for the encouragement he has given to Australian writers. I met him several times and liked him,” Kefala said on winning the award.\n\n“I am very honoured to receive this prestigious award given in his name, and the recognition it offers, as for a long time my writing has existed outside the major lines of Australian literature.”\n\nKefala has written three works of fiction (The First Journey, The Island and Alexia) and five poetry collections (The Alien, Thirsty Weather, European Notebook, Absence: New and Selected Poems, and Fragments).\n\nFragments won the 2017 Judith Wright Calanthe Award and was shortlisted for the Prime Minister’s Award for Poetry.\n\nThe Patrick White Literary Award was established by Nobel Prize-winning author Patrick White. For the past 48 years, it has been awarded to an author who has made an ongoing contribution to Australian literature but may not have received adequate recognition.\n\nAs part of the Patrick White Literary Award, Kefala will receive $15,000."
