        "text": "It was in the early 1960s that Carmel Bird met Patrick White. Her then-boyfriend was involved in a production of The Season at Sarsaparilla in Adelaide and there were drinks with the great man who was to become Australia's only winner of the Nobel prize for Literature.\n\nShe had just had a story published in The Australian Women's Weekly – her first commercially published work – but sitting at the same table as him she was in awe of White. \"We did talk briefly about the production, but not about writing.\"\n\nFast forward 55 years and Bird is the latest recipient of the award that White set up with the money from the Nobel to honour Australian writers who were deemed not to have received due recognition. Bird, who lives in Castlemaine, wins $20,000.\n\nShe has been shortlisted for the Miles Franklin three times, but says other than the Phillip Hodgins medal, this is the first award she has won. \"I am honoured to win it and to be on the list with writers I have admired who have received the prize.\"\n\nBut she is under no illusions about how her novels and short stories are perceived, despite frequent critical praise. \"I have been conscious that my writing stood and stands outside the mainstream. But that is how I write; my writing is my writing. I love it and own it and will continue to do it.\"\n\nThe award judges said her imagination was extraordinarily wide-ranging: \"Bird's voice is truly original: witty, stylish and allusive, it invests trust in the reader to appreciate her literary and cultural references.\"\n\nIn September, her ninth novel and 30th book, Family Skeleton, was published. Fairfax reviewer Peter Pierce wrote that it was \"as vibrant and off-beat as those that have gone before\" and one of her \"most accomplished and enjoyable fictional escapades\".\n\nSome previous award-winners have received the prize at a stage when none of their books has been in print. Bird, however, has nine titles in print and has just finished the manuscript of her 10th novel."
