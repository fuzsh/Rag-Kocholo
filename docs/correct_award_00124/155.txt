Patrick Whiteâs Nobel Prize, medal and diploma

Gold Medal

Patrick White (1912â1990) is the only Australian to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

In awarding White the Nobel Prize, the Royal Swedish Academy described his writing as âan epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literatureâ. The watercolour drawing accompanying the diploma was created by Gunnar Brusewitz and was inspired by Whiteâs novel, The tree of man.

White had a long association with the Mitchell Library dating back to childhood memories of being brought here in 1917 to witness the donation of his uncleâs peerless collection of pre-Federation postage stampsâthe H. L. White Postage Stamp Collection. White used the Library for research, was a donor of books and artwork during his lifetime and, on his death, bequeathed his entire book collection to the Library.

Whiteâs published works include The auntâs story (1948); The tree of man (1955); Voss (1957) and Riders in the chariot (1961). The Patrick White Award, established by White with funds from his Nobel prize money, is awarded annually to a writer who has not received adequate recognition.
