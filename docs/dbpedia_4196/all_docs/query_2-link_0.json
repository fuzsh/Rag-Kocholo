        "text": "The Rouse Ball Professorship of Mathematics is one of the senior chairs in the Mathematics Departments at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. The two positions were founded in 1927 by a bequest from the mathematician W. W. Rouse Ball. At Cambridge, this bequest was made with the \"hope (but not making it in any way a condition) that it might be found practicable for such Professor or Reader to include in his or her lectures and treatment historical and philosophical aspects of the subject.\"[1]\n\nList of Rouse Ball Professors at Cambridge\n\n[edit]\n\n1928–1950 John Edensor Littlewood\n\n1950–1958 Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch\n\n1958–1969 Harold Davenport\n\n1971–1993 John G.
