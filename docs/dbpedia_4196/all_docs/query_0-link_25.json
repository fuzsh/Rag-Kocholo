        "text": "These are extracts from the film “Thinking Space”.\n\nHow do mathematicians think? This 60 minute documentary film features nine UK-based mathematicians offering insights into their mathematical thinking across a broad range of mathematical research fields.\n\nThrough explorations of their various thought processes, the film portrays mathematicians who are grappling with advanced mathematical ideas. We are presented with the concepts of imagination, intuition, and wonder, as well as rigorous mathematical deduction.\n\nThe film features Kevin Buzzard, Peter Donnelly, Tim Gowers, Martin Hairer, Roger Penrose, Caroline Series, Richard Thomas, Reidun Twarock, and Karen Vogtmann.\n\nThe film was commissioned by The London Mathematical Society, as part of its 150th Anniversary Celebrations. The full length version of the film is available here.\n\n(Please click on the images to view the extracts.)"
