The advisory committee shall consist of not less than eight persons, a majority of whom shall be resident members of the Regent House and at least two of whom shall be persons who are not resident members of the University. The committee shall propose a list of persons for consideration by the Council. The Council shall give public notice of the name of the person nominated and shall submit a Grace to the Regent House for the appointment of that person to the office of Vice-Chancellor.\n\nAdmission.\n\n2. A Congregation of the Regent House for the formal admission of the Vice-Chancellor shall be held, as soon as conveniently may be after the Vice-Chancellor has entered upon office, on a day in term appointed by the Council. The Chancellor or, in the Chancellor's absence, the Proctors shall preside.\n\nProcedure at Congregation.\n\n3. At the Congregation the Senior Proctor shall ask the Vice-Chancellor, Dabis fidem te bene et fideliter praestiturum (praestituram) omnia quae spectent ad officium procancellarii academiae Cantabrigiensis? The Vice-Chancellor shall reply, Ita do fidem. The Senior Proctor shall then admit the Vice-Chancellor by saying, Auctoritate nobis commissa admittimus te ad officium procancellarii hujus academiae, in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. The Junior Proctor shall thereupon deliver to the Vice-Chancellor the insignia of the office. If a Grace has been submitted and approved for the admission of the Vice-Chancellor to the degree of Master of Arts under Statute B, III, 6 or a degree by incorporation under Statute B, III, 7, he or she shall be presented for that degree by the Registrary.
