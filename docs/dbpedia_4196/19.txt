This photograph was recently discovered in the estate of F.C. Strachan (back row, 4th from left). It shows the members of Trinity Mathematical Society in 1938. The photo was taken in Nevileâ€™s Court at Trinity College and features some prominent 20th century mathematicians.

Hermann Bondi (3rd row, 5th from left) was an Austrian-born British mathematician and cosmologist who is best known for the development of the Steady-state theory of the universe together with Fred Hoyle and Thomas Gold.

Abram Besicovitch (front row, 4th from left) was Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics in 1950-1958, a position currently hold by Fields-medallist Timothy Gowers. He is highly regarded for his work on combinatorial methods and real analysis.

Charles Coulson (front row, 3rd from right) was an applied mathematician and theoretical chemist who worked on applications of the quantum theory of valencies. He was also Chairman of Oxfam from 1965 to 1971. His doctoral students include the well-known physicist Peter Higgs.

Most notable for TMS however were the contributions of R.L. Brooks (front, 3rd from left), C.A.B. Smith (3rd row, 3rd from right), A.H. Stone (2nd row, 3rd from right) and W.T. Tutte (3rd row, far right) who discovered the Squared Square. For more information also see here.

We would like to express our thanks to the family of Mr Strachan for the provision of this photograph.
