However, studies examining associations between running biomechanics and RE report inconsistent findings.\n\nObjective\n\nThe aim of this systematic review was to determine associations between running biomechanics and RE and explore potential causes of inconsistency.\n\nMethods\n\nThree databases were searched and monitored up to April 2023. Observational studies were included if they (i) examined associations between running biomechanics and RE, or (ii) compared running biomechanics between groups differing in RE, or (iii) compared RE between groups differing in running biomechanics during level, constant-speed, and submaximal running in healthy humans (18–65 years). Risk of bias was assessed using a modified tool for observational studies and considered in the results interpretation using GRADE. Meta-analyses were performed when two or more studies reported on the same outcome. Meta-regressions were used to explore heterogeneity with speed, coefficient of variation of height, mass, and age as continuous outcomes, and standardization of running shoes, oxygen versus energetic cost, and correction for resting oxygen or energy cost as categorical outcomes.\n\nResults\n\nFifty-one studies (n = 1115 participants) were included. Most spatiotemporal outcomes showed trivial and non-significant associations with RE: contact time r = − 0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] − 0.15 to 0.12); flight time r = 0.11 (− 0.09 to 0.32); stride time r = 0.01 (− 0.8 to 0.50); duty factor r = − 0.06 (− 0.18 to 0.06); stride length r = 0.12 (− 0.15 to 0.38), and swing time r = 0.12 (− 0.13 to 0.36). A higher cadence showed a small significant association with a lower oxygen/energy cost (r = − 0.20 [− 0.35 to − 0.05]). A smaller vertical displacement and higher vertical and leg stiffness showed significant moderate associations with lower oxygen/energy cost (r = 0.35, − 0.31, − 0.28, respectively). Ankle, knee, and hip angles at initial contact, midstance or toe-off as well as their range of motion, peak vertical ground reaction force, mechanical work variables, and electromyographic activation were not significantly associated with RE, although potentially relevant trends were observed for some outcomes.\n\nConclusions\n\nRunning biomechanics can explain 4–12% of the between-individual variation in RE when considered in isolation, with this magnitude potentially increasing when combining different variables. Implications for athletes, coaches, wearable technology, and researchers are discussed in the review.\n\nProtocol registration\n\n10.17605/OSF.IO/293ND (OpenScience Framework).\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s40279-024-01997-3.\n\nKey Points\n\nAmong spatiotemporal variables, ground contact time, flight time, and duty factor showed trivial and non-significant associations with running economy, while a higher step frequency was weakly associated with a better running economy.Lower vertical displacement and higher vertical and leg stiffness were moderately associated with better running economy, while joint angles at specific instances of the gait cycle, joint angle range of motion, peak vertical ground reaction force, mechanical work variables, and electromyographic muscle activation showed non-significant and often trivial associations with running economy. Nevertheless, some non-significant trends of at least a small magnitude were observed for some outcomes (e.g., co-contraction duration, joint angles at toe-off).Overall, our findings show that biomechanical variables can explain 4–12% of the between-individual variance in running economy when considered in isolation, with this magnitude potentially increasing when combining different variables.\n\nIntroduction\n\nRunning economy (RE) represents the amount of oxygen or energy required to run at a given steady-state speed and is considered an important determinant of running performance, alongside other variables such as the maximum oxygen uptake (V˙O2max) and the ability to run at a high percentage of V˙O2max [1–3]. These three factors can collectively account for approximately 89%–95% of the variance in long-distance running performance [4], or speed at anaerobic threshold [5, 6]. However, RE has been shown to have a stronger association with running performance than V˙O2max within homogeneous running populations [7, 8], although there are some conflicting findings [9]. Further support for the importance of RE for running performance is provided by the dominance of East Africans in distance running events, which has often been attributed to their superior RE compared with other ethnicities [10, 11]. Finally, changes in RE have been shown to have strong associations with changes in running (i.e., time-trial) performance in studies that acutely alter RE, for example by shoe wear manipulations [12, 13], as well as long-term studies, in which changes in RE correlate with changes in time-trial performance [14]. While much of the previous work focused solely on male runners, it is likely similar findings would be present in female runners due to limited sex differences in RE when measured at relative intensities [15, 16].\n\nDue to the importance of RE for running performance, knowledge about factors that can (a) influence RE, and (b) be modified to improve RE, is crucial for coaches and athletes, as well as researchers. Several factors have been shown to be associated with RE, such as anthropometrical measures, biochemical aspects, musculotendon properties, and running biomechanics [17–22]. Specifically, longer lower leg length has been associated with better RE in a group of high-level male European distance runners [18]. The proportion of type I and type II fibers has also been associated with RE, although the evidence is often conflicting [17, 19–21, 23]. Finally, several running-related spatiotemporal characteristics, kinematics, and kinetics have also been associated with RE [23–25]. Of these factors, running biomechanics is the only factor that can be modified both acutely (i.e., during a race) and chronically (i.e., over the course of a training program).\n\nPrevious work considering how biomechanics influences RE between runners has shown that 54% of the between-individual variation in RE (expressed as mLO2∙kg−1∙min−1) was explained by two kinematics and one kinetic variable [23], whilst others have shown three kinematics to explain 39% of the between-individual variance in RE (expressed as kcal∙kg−1∙km−1) [24]. In terms of modifying running biomechanics, within-subject changes in running kinematics and kinetics have been reported to explain up to 94% of the changes in RE over a 10-week running program in female runners [26, 27]. Given the modifiable nature of running kinematics and kinetics, coaches and athletes often try to optimize them in an attempt to improve RE and hence running performance. For example, studies have manipulated stride length [28, 29] and ground contact time [30] to show that small adjustments to these characteristics could be beneficial for runners whose self-selected gait deviates from a gait that would mathematically minimize oxygen or energy cost, which would thus improve RE. Similarly, some wearable technologies claim to help enhance performance by attempting to aid runners in modifying factors such as vertical displacement or footstrike pattern, often based on the implicit assumption that there is a common economical running technique for all runners (at least for the modified component) [31].\n\nAlthough multiple studies have investigated the association between running biomechanics and RE, the evidence is often inconclusive or even conflicting. For instance, while some studies reported rearfoot striking to be associated with a better RE [23, 32], other studies reported fore-/mid-foot striking to be associated with a better RE [24, 33], and yet several studies reported no differences in RE between runners with different footstrike patterns [34, 35]. These conflicting findings may reflect differences in the methods used to assess running biomechanics and RE (e.g., no use of a fixed speed for all participants), or differences due to sampling variation with small sample sizes. However, they could also reflect true differences in the most economical running biomechanics between (groups of) individuals [36]. Although several reviews have covered the relationship between running biomechanics and RE [25, 31, 37, 38], they have also discussed the association of RE with other variables such as footwear or physiological factors. As a result, such reviews have provided a limited detailed critical appraisal of conflicting findings regarding the association between running biomechanics and RE. Further, they were all narrative reviews that had no systematic search and therefore could have missed relevant studies. A systematic review can highlight best practices in data collection and limitations, both of which may be used by future studies to further investigate associations between running biomechanics and RE. Additionally, a meta-analysis can weigh studies according to their precision and thereby provide a more informative estimate of the association between running biomechanics and RE. As such, a systematic review with meta-analysis that (i) provides an updated and comprehensive overview of the associations between running biomechanics and RE, and (ii) discusses potential reasons for conflicting findings would be beneficial. Therefore, the primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available evidence on the association between running biomechanics and RE as investigated in observational studies. Such evidence is important to inform coaches, athletes, researchers, and developers of wearable technologies on running biomechanics modification strategies, ultimately allowing for more effective improvements in RE.\n\nStudies that investigate the correlation between RE and running biomechanics at different speeds do not always report consistent associations across speeds (e.g., [39, 40]). Further, it is well known that shoes can influence RE [41–43] and running biomechanics [44, 45] and shoe standardization across individuals may therefore impact the correlations between RE and running biomechanics. Similarly, the method used to express RE (i.e., oxygen or energy cost), and normalization of RE for resting or standing oxygen/energy expenditure may impact the established correlations. As a secondary aim, we therefore also explored if the association between running biomechanics and RE was modulated by running speed, the use of standardized shoes, the method used to express RE (i.e., oxygen or energy cost), and normalization of RE for resting or standing oxygen/energy expenditure. Further, given the potential influence of anthropometric characteristics [46–49] and age [50–52] on RE and running biomechanics, we also explored whether sample homogeneity for height, mass, and age affected the magnitude of the correlations.\n\nMethods\n\nRegistry of Systematic Review Protocol\n\nA systematic review of the literature was performed using guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 6.0) and following the checklist for the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 (PRISMA) [53]. The protocol was prospectively registered on the OpenScience Framework (https://osf.io/293nd/). Registration occurred after searches had been conducted, but before screening was completed.\n\nEligibility Criteria\n\nTo be included, studies had to (i) be cross-sectional studies that determined associations between running biomechanics and RE, or compared running biomechanics between two or more groups differing in running economy, or compared running economy between two or more groups differing in running biomechanics (e.g., footstrike comparison studies), during level (0 and 1% incline), constant-speed motorized treadmill, or overground running at sub-maximal speeds (i.e., respiratory exchange ratio < 1.0 or below lactate threshold/respiratory compensation point); (ii) be performed among healthy, non-injured humans between 18–65 years; (iii) measure biomechanical variables (spatiotemporal, kinematics, kinetics, and muscle activity outcomes were all included); (iv) be written in English; and (v) measure RE using respiratory gas analysis (both oxygen and energetic cost and linear or allometrically scaled data were included). Grey literature such as conference abstracts and theses were included only if they provided sufficient methodological details, or if the authors provided this upon request. Data on running above the anaerobic threshold/respiratory compensation point, sprinting (defined here as > 25 km∙h−1 or > 7 m∙s−1 [54]), barefoot running, running with orthopedic inserts, musculoskeletal modeling studies, running in a fatigued state, and running with additional mass were excluded. We did not apply restrictions to the training level of the sample.\n\nInformation Sources\n\nThree electronic databases (MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase) as well as two pre-print servers (SportRxiv and BioRxiv) were searched. The searches covered all dates of available literature, with the date of the last search being September 30, 2020. No limits were applied for language within each database to prevent exclusion of articles that were not assigned a language. Search alerts were created to monitor any new search results after the date of the last search up to April 1, 2023. Any articles identified by this search were assessed by two researchers (BVH and KF) for eligibility. One researcher (BVH) double-checked the included papers from the systematic search and modified the eligibility criteria to limit the scope of the review, for example, by only including studies that assessed correlations with all participants running at the same speed as opposed to a percentage of their ventilatory threshold or V˙O2peak. Hand searching of reference lists and forward citation searching of included studies was also used to identify articles. An additional narrative search was performed on February 1, 2022, for studies that compared both RE and biomechanics with participants running in different shoes. Although we were not interested in the effect of shoes, studies comparing running economy and running biomechanics between different shoes collected all information to compute correlations between running biomechanics and RE. Therefore, the authors of these studies were emailed to request averaged correlational data across shoes between the measured running biomechanics and RE so these data could also be included in the analyses.\n\nSearch Strategy\n\nA PICO systematic search strategy was developed for PubMed together with a research librarian, and using the Word Frequency Analyser tool (http://sr-accelerator.com/#/help/wordfreq) to suggest potentially relevant search terms [55]. The Research refiner tool (https://ielab-sysrev2.uqcloud.net/) was subsequently used to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the search, while the Polyglot Search Translator Tool (https://sr-accelerator.com/#/polyglot) was used to adapt the search to other databases [56, 57]. The final search consisted of terms for running, running economy, and running biomechanics. The search string used for all databases is reported in Supplementary File S1 of the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM).\n\nStudy Selection\n\nDuplicate references were first removed using an online deduplicate tool for systematic reviews (https://sr-accelerator.com/#/libraries/dedupe) [58] and subsequent manual methods. Two authors (BVH and KF) then independently screened titles and abstracts to determine initial eligibility using systematic review software (Rayyan) [59]. Blinding of authors was used to reduce bias during this process. Finally, the authors reviewed the full texts of all articles to determine their eligibility for inclusion based on the eligibility criteria. Disagreements in eligibility decisions were resolved through discussion, or with a third reviewer (IM) when required.\n\nData Collection Process\n\nData extraction was completed independently and in duplicate by four authors (KF, IB, BVH, MC) using a standardized form that was pilot tested on five randomly selected included studies and refined accordingly through discussions with BVH and IM. The data were then merged by two authors (BVH, MC) and any discrepancies in the extracted data were resolved through discussion. Extracted data from each full-text article included (i) study identification information; (ii) study design; (iii) sample size; (iv) sex and nationality/ethnicity; (v) age, height, and body mass; (vi) running ability (e.g., weekly distance, personal best times, and RE); (vii) running surface; (viii) data collection equipment and procedures (e.g., wearable device or 3D motion capture, gas exchange equipment); (ix) running speeds; (x) footwear; (xi) data analysis approaches (e.g., verification of steady-state, corrections or no corrections of RE for resting oxygen/energy expenditure); (xii) correlations between biomechanics and RE for correlational studies, or (xiii) means and standard deviations for relevant outcome measures; and (xiv) an exact p-value, t-value, or confidence intervals when a study compared RE/biomechanics between groups differing in biomechanics/RE, respectively. If insufficient data were reported, or when more metrics were measured than reported in the results (e.g., studies that assessed duty factor but did not report correlations for contact time and flight time), the corresponding authors were contacted by email. If the corresponding author did not respond, we contacted other authors of the paper and also used different contact methods (e.g., ResearchGate). When data were not presented in tables or text and when authors did not provide the requested data, these were extracted from figures using WebPlot Digitizer (Web Plot Digitizer, V.4.1. Texas, USA) [60] where possible.\n\nRisk-of-Bias Assessment\n\nAlthough several risk-of-bias tools are available [61–63], most tools are developed for risk-of-bias assessment of intervention studies and therefore contain several criteria that are not relevant to the observational studies included in this review. Therefore, we modified the risk-of-bias tool developed by Hoy and colleagues [64] and used this to perform a risk-of-bias assessment independently by three authors (IJ, KF, BVH). More information on the criteria used in risk-of-bias assessment can be found in Supplementary File S2 of the ESM. The risk of bias was assessed based on the information reported in the published paper and not on information provided by the authors, except for information regarding steady-state verification as this was often missing in the papers. Disagreements in risk-of-bias assessment were resolved by discussion before the scores were merged into a spreadsheet. The mean kappa agreement between the authors was 0.95 (nearly perfect). The risk of bias was considered in the interpretation of the results by applying the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system [65]. Briefly, the overall quality was initially rated as high and downgraded one level to moderate, low, or very low for each of the following limitations: total sample size < 100 participants (imprecision), high (I2 > 50%) statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency), > 50% of studies in the meta-analysis had one or more risk-of-bias items assessed to be high risk (risk of bias). For individual study outcomes, we used the same criteria but rated the risk for statistical heterogeneity down if there was only one study reporting on a specific outcome.\n\nStatistical Analysis\n\nEffect Size and Synthesis of Studies Providing Correlations\n\nPearson correlation coefficients between running biomechanics and RE were considered the primary effect size of interest. If studies reported a Spearman’s rank correlation, we converted this to a Pearson correlation using Eq. 1 as Spearman’s correlations are typically smaller than Pearson correlations [66]:\n\nr=2sin(rsπ6)\n\n1\n\nwhere rs is Spearman’s rank correlation.\n\nThe sampling distribution of (Pearson) correlation coefficients is increasingly non-normal (i.e., skewed) with stronger correlations because it is bound from − 1 to 1 [67]. Correlations were therefore transformed to Fisher’s z as detailed previously [67] to better approximate a normal distribution. The z-transformed correlation coefficient was then meta-analyzed to obtain a weighted point estimate with 95% confidence intervals, and these were back-transformed into a Pearson correlation coefficient using an integral z-to-r transformation [68] to aid interpretation. Correlations were interpreted as < 0.1 trivial; 0.1–0.29 small; 0.30–0.49 moderate; 0.5–0.69 large; 0.7–0.89 very large; 0.9–0.99 nearly perfect [69].\n\nThe synthesis of z-scores across studies was done using a random-effects model, with a separate random-effects meta-analysis being performed when two or more studies reported on the same outcome. A substantial proportion of studies included in this review provided two or more correlation coefficients (e.g., at multiple speeds). Two effects from the same study (e.g., correlation coefficients between the two variables at different speeds) are likely more similar than two effects from two different studies due to the use of the same participants and data collection and analysis procedures within each study. The inclusion of multiple effects from the same study would therefore violate the assumption of independence in traditional meta-analyses. To account for this, we conducted a three-level meta-analysis (i.e., a multi-level model). By using a three-level structure we accounted for three different variance components distributed over the three levels in the model. This included sampling variance of the extracted effect sizes at level one, variance between the extracted effect sizes within the same study at level two, and variance between studies at level three. We used cluster-robust variance estimation methods [70] with small-sample adjustments [71] to adjust the within-study standard errors for correlations between effect sizes. To do so, the method required an estimate of the mean correlation between all pairs of within-study effect sizes (ρ), which was used to correct the between-study sampling variance (τ2) for statistical dependencies [72]. Since information about the sampling correlations among effect sizes was limited, this correlation was set to 0.6 [72]. Sensitivity analysis with correlations of 0.4 and 0.8 showed no differences in the outcomes of the meta-analyses.\n\nThe inverse of the standard error was used to determine the weight (i.e., contribution) of each effect (i.e., correlation coefficient) in the meta-analysis. Within the multi-level meta-analysis implemented, the standard error (and thus weight) of each study was determined by a combination of within- and between-study heterogeneity in effect sizes, the correlation between effect sizes within each study, and the sample variance of each effect size as described in Eq. 2 [73]:\n\nwj=kjkjt^2+kjρσj2+ω^2+(1-ρ)σj2\n\n2\n\nwhere wj is the weight of study j, kj the number of effect sizes within study j, t^2 the between-study heterogeneity, ρ the correlation between the within-study effects, ω^2 the within-study heterogeneity, and σj2 the sample variance of each effect. The sample variance of each effect (i.e., of the Fisher’s z-transformed correlation) was in turn directly proportional to the sample size as shown in Eq. 3 [67]:\n\nσj2=1n-3\n\n3\n\nwhere n is the sample size.\n\nWithin this weighting procedure (Eq. 2), a large between-study variation in effect sizes will result in relatively more equal weights given to different studies. Further, when there is large within-study variability in effect sizes, relatively more weight will be given to studies that provide multiple effect sizes because the average estimate from such a study will yield a more accurate estimate of the real effect than a study that provides only one effect. This weight will, however, also depend on the correlation assumed between the effect sizes. Specifically, if the correlation between within-study effect sizes is high, averaging highly correlated estimates does not substantially improve the precision relative to using one effect size. Finally, effect sizes with small variance (i.e., large sample size, see Eq. 3) will receive more weight than effect sizes with larger variance.\n\nAll model parameters were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method. Tests of individual coefficients in all models, and their corresponding confidence intervals, were based on a t-distribution. Multilevel meta-analyses and meta-regressions were performed in R (version 4.2.0, R Foundation for Statistical Computing) [74] using the metafor package [74], whereas the clubSandwich package [72] was used to implement the robust methods with correlated and hierarchical effects.\n\nThe heterogeneity of the correlations across studies was assessed using the I2 statistic obtained from the multi-level model. Briefly, the variance components of the pooled correlation coefficient were decomposed into sampling variance of the observed correlations (level 1), and variance within (level 2) and between studies (level 3). This I2 (level 3) represents the percentage of the total variation in estimated effects across studies due to heterogeneity rather than chance and was interpreted as small (I2 < 25%), moderate (I2 = 25–49%), and high (I2 > 50%) [75]. We only report and use the I2 (level 3) for the GRADE criteria (see Sect. 2.7).\n\nMeta-regressions were performed when at least ten effects (i.e., correlations) were available for an outcome [67, 76]. Meta-regressions were performed with running shoes (i.e., standardized vs non-standardized shoes), RE units (i.e., oxygen or energy cost), and normalization of RE (i.e., corrected for resting or standing oxygen/energy expenditure) as categorical outcomes when at least two studies reported on each moderator. Categorical moderators were dummy coded (e.g., oxygen cost = 1, energy cost = 0) to allow the regression coefficient to be interpreted as the difference in effect size between two levels of the moderator. If studies reported correlations between running biomechanics and energy cost expressed as caloric units and oxygen cost, we used the caloric units for all analyses. We performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate the difference in correlations between running biomechanics and RE with RE expressed as oxygen or caloric cost to investigate the impact of this decision (Supplementary File S3, see ESM). When no specification of shoe standardization was reported, we assumed participants ran in non-standardized shoes. Similarly, RE was assumed to be not corrected for resting or standing oxygen/energy expenditure if this was not specifically reported. Meta-regressions were performed with speed, and the coefficient of variation in height, mass, and age as continuous outcomes. The coefficients of variation for height, mass, and age were determined from the reported mean and standard deviation in each study and were used as continuous outcomes because the homogeneity of a group on these outcomes could affect the magnitude of the correlations given the potential influence of anthropometric characteristics [46–49] and age [50–52] on RE and running biomechanics. If there were sufficient studies to perform a multi-variable meta-regression (i.e., at least 10 effects per moderator), we combined variables in the following fixed order: (a) RE units, (b) shoe standardization, (c) speed, (d) normalization of RE, while always ensuring at least 10 effects were available per moderator.\n\nLeverage, outlier, and influential case diagnostics were conducted for all meta-regression models by examining hat, Cook’s distance, and studentized residuals [77–79]. Cases exceeding three times the mean value for hat and Cook’s distance, as well as an absolute studentized residual > 3, were considered influential. These red-flagged estimates (i.e., correlation coefficients) were then dropped from the dataset, and meta-regression models were refitted without them. If the interpretation of the meta-regression model did not change after excluding influential estimates, the original model was retained. In contrast, if the interpretation of a given meta-regression model changed as a consequence of removing influential cases, the model without influential cases was retained and reported instead.\n\nEffect Size and Synthesis of Studies Providing Between-Group Differences\n\nSome studies compared running biomechanics and RE between two groups running at a similar speed and did not report a correlation coefficient, but instead reported mean and standard deviations for RE and some biomechanical outcomes of each group, as well as a statistic representing the between-group difference. Specifically, six studies reported or provided RE data for runners running with a rearfoot or mid/forefoot strike. As the RE data were reported in different units, standardized mean differences for independent groups were computed using procedures outlined by Borenstein et al. [67]. Briefly, the RE data in the rearfoot strike group were subtracted from the mid/forefoot strike group to determine the mean difference, which was then divided by the pooled within-group standard deviation to determine the standardized mean difference. The resulting standardized mean differences and their variance were corrected for small sample bias using a correction factor [67].\n\nAfter the effect sizes (i.e., standardized mean differences) for each comparison were calculated, a meta-analysis was performed using similar procedures as for the correlational data reported in Sect. 2.8.1. Briefly, a cluster-robust variance estimation method [70] with small-sample adjustments [71] was used to adjust the standard error for the overall standardized mean difference, with clustering at the study level. The sampling correlation between the effect sizes was assumed to be 0.6. In addition, the inverse of the standard error was used to weigh each effect as detailed in Eq. 2. Note, however, that the sample variance of each effect was determined for standardized mean differences of independent groups (as opposed to correlations) as detailed by Borenstein and colleagues [67]. Finally, the model’s parameters were estimated using the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method and p-values and confidence intervals were based on a t-distribution.\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe variability in designs and outcomes among eligible studies required several decisions to ensure the data could be appropriately combined for meta-analysis. These decisions are specified in Supplementary File S4 (see ESM). Most importantly, joint or segment angles were expressed in the same reference frame (e.g., higher values representing higher flexion in all studies for a given outcome) so that correlations were also directionally consistent. Two authors (BVH and IM) were involved in checking the reference frame assignment to ensure accuracy. Further, step and stride frequency were combined in one analysis, and we refer to stride frequency throughout the paper to ensure consistency. A similar approach was used for step and stride length. Further, while most studies reported vertical oscillation during a stride or step (i.e., including the flight phase), some studies reported only on the stance phase vertical displacement. Because step vertical oscillation and stance vertical displacement have highly similar correlations with RE [24], we combined all outcomes in one analysis and refer to these as vertical oscillation for consistency. While different methods were used to classify footstrike patterns (e.g., foot–ground angle, footstrike index), we will collectively refer to footstrike angle in Sect. 3 and Sect. 4 as this was the dominant method used in the included studies.\n\nPublication Bias\n\nPublication bias was not assessed because there was only a small number of studies included in most meta-analyses and we did not see any reason why studies reporting no correlation between RE and biomechanics would be less likely to be published than studies finding a significant correlation. Additionally, we included studies that did not directly aim to assess the relationship between running biomechanics and RE. Therefore, these studies are unlikely to be affected by publication bias. Finally, we also reduced the potential impact of publication bias by checking the consistency between the measured biomechanical outcomes, and reported biomechanical outcomes in Sect. 3.\n\nResults\n\nSearch Results\n\nThe initial literature search yielded 2014 records through electronic databases (Fig. ). Title and abstract screening resulted in exclusion of 1570 records. After screening 58 records for inclusion/exclusion criteria, 17 records were excluded, resulting in 41 articles being identified from the original search. A combination of forward citation searching for articles that passed title/abstract screening and monitoring of newly published literature using the search alerts and regular manual checking of relevant journals yielded an addition 15 records for consideration in the review. Five of these were subsequently excluded because the authors did not provide the requested data, resulting in a total number of 51 articles included in the review.\n\nStudy Characteristics\n\nDetailed study characteristics are reported in Table . All 51 studies included in this review provided either correlations between running biomechanics and RE (38 studies), compared RE between groups differing in running biomechanics (e.g., footstrike angle; 5 studies [32, 34, 35, 80, 81]), compared running biomechanics between groups differing in RE (5 studies [23, 82–85]), or provided both correlations and between-group comparisons (3 studies [81, 86, 87]). The total number of participants in the included studies was 1115 (904 males, 227 females). Note that three studies used the same sample [88–90], but analyzed different biomechanical outcomes. The sample size of these studies was counted only once for the overall sample size calculation. Of the 51 included studies, 35 included only males, 2 only females, 13 both males and females (only one presented sex-disaggregated data), and one did not specify the sex of included participants. Fifty studies recruited participants that were runners or physically active in other sports, and one study did not specify the physical activity of the participants [40]. Running speeds used for RE assessment ranged from 2.22 m∙s−1 [40, 91] to 5.56 m∙s−1 [92]). Sixteen studies standardized shoe wear, while 38 studies did not, or at least did not explicitly report that they had.\n\nTable 1\n\nStudy reference; design within our meta-analysisParticipant characteristics\n\nM/F; mean ± SD age (years); height (cm); mass (kg); ethnicityRunning ability\n\nSubjective description of range of running abilities; mean ± SD personal best times; weekly training distance (km∙w−1); running experience (years); V˙O2max (mL∙kg∙min−1); running economy (in different units)Assessment of running economy\n\nEquipment used; speed/relative intensity; duration of run; period for data analysis; verification steady-stateExpression of running economy\n\nUnits; equation used to determine energy cost from V˙O2 (if applicable); resting or standing V˙O2 or energy expenditure (EE) subtracted from RE (if any)Assessment of running biomechanics\n\nTime of measurement (concurrent with running economy or separate); equipment used; surface; shoes; leg used for data collection (if applicable)Biomechanical variables measuredAdelson et al.

In one study [93], male and female participants ran at a different constant speed. RE was expressed in mlO2∙kg−1∙km−1 in nine studies, mlO2∙kg−1∙min−1 in 23 studies, and kcal∙kg−1∙km−1 in seven studies. Other commonly employed units for RE were W∙kg−1 (k = 4), J∙kg−1 (k = 1), J∙kg−1∙m−1 (k = 5), J∙kg−1∙min−1 (k = 2), mLO2∙kg−0.75∙km−1 (k = 1), and mlO2∙kg−0.75∙min−1 (k = 2). Several studies reported RE in multiple units, and thus the total is higher than 51. Forty studies described methods used to check for a steady state, which included verification of the respiratory exchange ratio below 1.0 (22 studies [24, 39, 40, 80, 81, 86, 88–90, 93–104], measurement of blood lactate concentration (12 studies [23, 24, 40–43, 82, 92, 105–108]), and visual inspection of a plateau in the oxygen consumption (V˙O2) and/or carbon dioxide expired (V˙CO2) data (21 studies [34, 35, 39, 80, 82, 84–86, 88–90, 94–96, 98, 99, 106, 109–112]). Most studies (k = 18) employed multiple methods to check for steady state [32, 83, 87, 113–120], while 11 studies did not report any steady-state verification. Six studies subtracted resting (3 studies [23, 91, 111, 113]) or standing (3 studies [24, 81, 86]) V˙O2 or energy expenditure from running V˙O2 or energy expenditure. Most studies (k = 44) did not report whether such a subtraction was performed, and one study [101] explicitly stated that no subtraction was done. Four studies used allometric scaling when normalizing RE for body mass [97, 99, 117, 120] while 47 studies used linear scaling. Finally, six studies used the Péronnet equations to compute the energetic cost from V˙O2 and V˙CO2, one study used the Brockway equation, three referred to Fletcher [121], who used the Lusk equation, one study used the Jeukendrup equation [122], one study used a method described by Kyröläinen based on blood lactate [111], and one used the Weir equation [123].\n\nThirty-one studies assessed running biomechanics and RE simultaneously, while 14 studies performed these assessments separately. The remaining six studies did not specify these components. Thirty-three studies used three-dimensional motion capture and/or an instrumented treadmill or ground-mounted force plate to measure running biomechanics, four studies used photoelectronic cell systems, contact laser platforms, or an optical measurement system. The remaining studies used accelerometry (k = 2), two-dimensional measurements (k = 10), and other methods such as surface electromyographic electrodes (k = 5) or electro goniometers (k = 1).\n\nRisk of Bias in Studies\n\nThe risk-of-bias score of included studies is reported in Fig. . Most studies were at moderate or high risk of bias for not clearly describing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Conversely, only a few studies were at high risk of bias for the data collection and analysis procedures.\n\nSpatiotemporal Outcome Measures\n\nAmong the spatiotemporal outcomes investigated (contact time [Fig. ], flight time, swing time, stride time, duty factor, stride length, normalized stride length, and stride frequency), only stride frequency was significantly associated with RE (Table , Figs. , , , and ). The results of the meta-regressions are detailed in Supplementary File S5 (see ESM) and two meta-regression examples are shown in Figs. and .\n\nTable 2\n\nOutcomeSummary of findingsQuality of evidence synthesis (GRADE)knWeighted mean correlation coefficient (95% CI)I2 (%)Direction effectImprecisionInconsistencyRisk of biasOverall qualitySpatiotemporalContact time40591− 0.02 (− 0.15 to 0.12)52.3↔None− 1NoneModerateFlight time182420.11 (− 0.09 to 0.32)25.8↔NoneNoneNoneHighSwing time153200.12 (− 0.13 to 0.36)75.1↔None− 1NoneModerateStride time122130.01 (− 0.48 to 0.50)90.2↔None− 1NoneModerateDuty factor19372− 0.06 (− 0.18 to 0.06)15.0↔NoneNoneNoneHighStride length192070.12 (− 0.13 to 0.36)64.1↔None− 1NoneModerateNorm. stride length81600.27 (− 0.23 to 0.65)67.8↔None− 1NoneModerateCadence37593− 0.20 (− 0.35 to − 0.05)60.3↓None− 1NoneModerateVertical oscillationVertical oscillation233170.35 (0.19 to 0.49)56.0↑None− 1NoneModerateVertical oscillation normalized for step length2240.20 (− 1.00 to 1.00)35.2↔− 1NoneNoneModerateHip and pelvisHip angle footstrike4690.05 (− 0.75 to 0.79)0.00↔− 1NoneNoneModerateHip angle ROM31240.21 (− 0.65 to 0.84)4.96↔NoneNoneNoneHighCoM-heel distance footstrike71240.04 (− 0.38 to 0.44)3.41↔NoneNoneNoneHighHip angle toe-off581− 0.00 (− 0.78 to 0.78)59.2↔− 1− 1NoneLowKneeKnee angle footstrike8174− 0.02 (− 0.34 to 0.31)53.4↔None− 1NoneModerateShank angle footstrike41510.07 (− 0.85 to 0.88)44.1↔NoneNoneNoneHighPeak knee flexion during stance71980.27 (− 0.14 to 0.60)69.2↔None− 1NoneModerateKnee angle ROM31240.23 (− 0.73 to 0.88)31.3↔NoneNoneNoneHighKnee angle toe-off6950.05 (− 0.50 to 0.57)38.6↔− 1NoneNoneModerateAnkle and footFootstrike index/anglea6156− 0.02 (− 0.59 to 0.55)60.3↔None− 1NoneModerateAnkle angle footstrike8174− 0.18 (− 0.51 to 0.20)68.6↔None− 1NoneModeratePeak ankle angle during stance467− 0.07 (− 1.00 to 1.00)69.1↔− 1− 1NoneLowAnkle angle toe-off71100.13 (− 0.35 to 0.55)56.9↔None− 1NoneModerateKineticAbsolute vertical ground reaction force4112− 0.27 (− 0.66 to 0.23)0.00↔NoneNoneNoneHighNormalized vertical ground reaction force4480.28 (− 0.49 to 0.81)0.00↔− 1None− 1LowVertical stiffness18236− 0.31 (− 0.56 to − 0.05)68.2↓None− 1NoneModerateLeg stiffness18287− 0.28 (− 0.52 to − 0.03)68.2↓None− 1NoneModerateKnee stiffness2600.11 (− 1.00 to 1.00)40.4↔− 1NoneNoneModerateAnkle stiffness2600.10 (− 1.00 to 1.00)46.5↔− 1NoneNoneModerateTotal mech. work8540.37 (− 0.05 to 0.68)0.00↔− 1NoneNoneModerateNegat. mech. work3220.08 (− 1.00 to 1.00)26.8↔− 1NoneNoneModeratePosit. mech. work3220.18 (− 0.96 to 0.98)0.00↔− 1NoneNoneModerateMuscle activityEMG gluteus maximus stance227− 0.10 (− 0.78 to 0.70)0.00↔− 1NoneNoneModerateEMG biceps femoris stance473− 0.09 (− 0.46 to 0.32)0.00↔− 1NoneNoneModerateEMG gastroc.

S4–S6, see ESM). Similarly, segment angles relative to the global reference frame were not associated with RE (Table ). Meta-regression results are detailed in Supplementary File S5 (see ESM).\n\nKinetic Outcomes\n\nPeak vertical ground reaction forces were not significantly associated with RE overall (r = − 0.02, or when considering absolute r = − 0.27 or normalized r = 0.28 outcomes separately; Table ). Meta-regression was not undertaken for these outcomes due to insufficient effects. Similarly, a higher vertical and leg stiffness were both associated with a moderate and small significant reduction in oxygen/energetic cost (r = − 0.31 and − 0.28, respectively, Supplementary File S6, Figs. S2–S3, see ESM). The results of the meta-regressions are detailed in Supplementary File S5 (see ESM).\n\nOne study further reported a higher anterior–posterior and medio-lateral impulse to be non-significantly associated with a higher energy cost (r = 0.25 and 0.37, respectively) [88]. Storen and co-workers [120] reported no significant correlations between the braking or propulsive forces (correlation magnitudes not reported), but runners with a higher oxygen cost showed a higher sum of the horizontal and vertical forces (r = 0.66). Similarly, Williams and Cavanagh [23] reported the group with the lowest oxygen cost exhibited lower horizontal braking forces than the group with medium oxygen cost, which in turn exhibited lower braking forces than the group with high oxygen cost, although no differences reached statistical significance. One final study reported a trivial correlation between average braking forces and energy cost (r = 0.07), but a moderate correlation between average propulsive force and energy cost (r = 0.30) [81].\n\nMechanical Work Outcomes\n\nTotal, negative, or positive mechanical work were not significantly associated with RE (Table ). Meta-regression was not undertaken due to insufficient effects.\n\nElectromyographic Outcomes\n\nSurface electromyographic activation of the gluteus maximus, soleus, gastrocnemius medialis/lateralis, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris long head, and tibialis anterior during stance was not significantly associated with RE (Table ). Meta-regression was not undertaken due to insufficient effects.\n\nBetween-Group Comparisons\n\nThe only between-group comparison with sufficient data for meta-analysis was footstrike angle. Meta-analysis showed that RE did not significantly differ between footstrike classified into rearfoot or midfoot/forefoot strikers (standardized mean difference = − 0.02, Table , Supplementary File S6, Fig. S7, see ESM).\n\nSensitivity Analysis\n\nWe performed an informal sensitivity analysis to compare whether the correlations between various biomechanics and RE were affected by the expression of RE as oxygen or energetic cost within the same study by comparing the correlation coefficients (Supplementary File S3, see ESM). These analyses revealed that the correlations were very similar with both analyses (mean difference of r = − 0.03 and 0.01 for contact time and cadence, respectively). Additionally, we compared the sensitivity of the correlation coefficients to two different stoichiometric equations. This resulted in negligible mean differences of r = 0.01.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the available evidence on the association between running biomechanics and RE as investigated in observational studies. In the following sections we first discuss the most important findings from the meta-analyses and (to a lesser extent) individual study results, and we discuss potential biomechanical/physiological mechanisms for each of the observed effects. We also briefly compare the associations found in our review of observational studies with findings from longitudinal studies that investigated changes in running biomechanics and RE, and with studies that investigated associations between running biomechanics and running performance. Finally, we provide practical implications of our findings for coaches, researchers, and developers of wearable technology. Note that we also discuss non-significant correlations as ‘trends’ when their magnitude is at least small (r > 0.1) and when the correlation is consistent with other significant biomechanical outcomes. For example, a larger vertical oscillation could result from a larger knee flexion during stance, but the latter may not be significant due to the small number of studies assessing this outcome.\n\nSpatiotemporal Outcomes\n\nModerate GRADE evidence showed that a higher stride frequency was weakly but significantly (r = − 0.20) associated with a lower energetic cost of running (Table , Fig. ). Between-group studies included in this review that compared cadence between groups differing in RE also reported a higher cadence in the more economical group [83], or no difference between groups [82]. At the fixed running speed used in all included articles, a low stride frequency means that runners adopt a long stride length, which can lead to higher braking impulses [125]. Greater braking during the initial phase of the stance phase necessitates a larger horizontal propulsive force production during the remaining stance phase to reaccelerate the center of mass to maintain running speed. The generation of propulsive force involves energetically expensive concentric contractions and is an important component of the metabolic cost of running [24, 126]; see also Sect. 4.4. These mechanisms may therefore partly explain the association between a higher stride frequency and lower energy cost. However, the small magnitude of the correlation between stride frequency and RE should be noted. The small magnitude observed may be due to differences in anthropometrics (e.g., height and body mass) between individuals that in turn can cause differences in the most economical stride frequency between individuals [46–49], and thereby reduce the magnitude of the correlation. We explored whether more homogeneous groups showed stronger correlations between stride frequency and RE by performing a meta-regression with the coefficients of variation in height or body mass as continuous predictors (Supplemental File S5, see ESM). However, this indicated that the correlation between stride frequency and RE did not differ with smaller coefficients of variation in height and body mass (i.e., reflecting a more homogeneous group). Therefore, a higher stride frequency is weakly associated with better RE, but the homogeneity of anthropometrics across studies does not appear to alter the strength of the observed relationship. Running speed and running economy units both significantly moderated the correlation between cadence and RE (Supplemental File S5, Fig. ), such that the correlation became larger with increases in speed, and decreased with RE expressed as oxygen cost.\n\nBased on (a) the significant association found between stride frequency and RE, and (b) the inverse relationship between stride length and stride frequency at a given running speed, one would expect a shorter stride length also to be associated with a lower energy cost. While the direction of the effect did indeed suggest shorter stride lengths were associated with a lower energy cost (r = 0.12; moderate GRADE evidence), the association was not significant. This is likely due to the ~ 65% smaller sample size and thus lower statistical power in the stride length analysis compared with the stride frequency analysis (Table ). A similar reason likely explains the lack of significant associations for stride length normalized to height. Interestingly, the correlation for normalized stride length was approximately double compared with stride length (r = 0.27; moderate GRADE evidence). This suggests that individuals with short stride lengths relative to their height might have better RE than those with long stride lengths relative to their height. Stride length normalized to height may therefore be more relevant to inform on running economy, and potentially presents a useful variable to modify when optimizing running economy, although further research is required to substantiate this notion.\n\nStride time, ground contact time (Fig. ), flight time, and swing time were not significantly and mostly trivially associated with RE (moderate–high GRADE evidence). One between-group study included in this review also found no differences in these outcomes between groups differing in RE [82]. Combining these findings with the significant correlation observed between stride frequency and RE suggests that the higher stride frequency seen in more economical runners may be achieved using different combinations of contact and flight times that are equally economical. This supports the notion that contact time can be self-optimized and operates within a narrower optimal range than stride frequency [30]. Mechanistically, the trivial association between contact time and RE may be because a shorter contact time requires a faster force production, which in turn requires a higher fascicle/fiber shortening velocity and this increases energy costs [22, 127]. Conversely, a longer contact time may lead to more dissipation of stored elastic energy into heat (e.g., [128]), and may reflect a longer braking phase and thus higher braking impulse, both of which require metabolically expensive concentric muscle action to generate propulsive force to maintain a similar running speed. The trivial correlation between contact time and RE is notable as it is often believed that a short contact time is reflective of better RE based on the findings of several studies in highly trained runners [100, 129]. However, these studies either did not standardize running speed [129], or measured RE above the anaerobic threshold [100], and our findings suggest that this effect is not observed when running speed is standardized and when measured at a metabolic steady state.\n\nIn line with the findings for contact and flight time, duty factor (i.e., contact time/[contact time + flight time]; reflecting the proportion of stride time spent on the ground) was also not significantly associated with RE (high GRADE evidence, Table ). Mechanistically, this may be because runners with a low duty factor (e.g., long flight time) rely more on a larger vertical displacement (which increases energy cost), but also better use elastic energy (i.e., optimization of the spring-mass model; which reduces energy cost), while runners with a high duty factor rely more on energetically costly forward propulsion, but also limit energetically costly vertical displacement [39, 130]. The net effect is therefore that both lower and higher duty factors can be economical. Whether a runner adopts a lower or higher duty factor may in turn reflect differences in musculotendinous properties. Runners with a low duty factor (longer flight time, shorter contact time) have, for example, been shown to exhibit a higher rate of force development, muscle activation, and H-reflex of the soleus compared with runners with a high duty factor [131]. Runners may therefore simply self-organize to the technique that is most economical for their musculotendinous properties with sufficient training (e.g., [27]). Simply altering contact or flight time (and thus duty factor) without determining if a runner already produces a metabolically optimized running gait may force them to use a technique that is not economical for their current musculotendinous properties and could reduce rather than increase performance. Further research is required to investigate whether alterations in musculotendinous properties could allow individuals to use a different running technique that in turn is more economical.\n\nOur meta-regression, however, indicated that the correlation between duty factor and RE became significantly larger (from moderate negative correlations to small positive correlations) with increases in running speed (Supplementary File S5, see ESM). This suggests that high duty factors (shorter contact times and/or longer flight times) are associated with lower energy costs at relatively slower speeds, but higher energy costs at higher speeds. This may be explained as follows: at relatively slow running speeds, the contact time is relatively long (e.g., 275 ms at 2.78 m∙s−1), and this leads to more dissipation of elastic energy into heat as compared with shorter contact times [128]. By adopting a relatively shorter contact time and increasing the flight time at these slow speeds, less elastic energy may dissipate, thus benefiting energy costs. Conversely, at higher speeds, the contact time is already shorter (e.g., 175 ms at 4 m∙s−1) and further reductions in contact time may not yield much benefit from an elastic energy dissipation perspective, while they may be more energetically costly from a f"
