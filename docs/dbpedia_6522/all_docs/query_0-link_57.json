        "text": "Uterine fibroids: current perspectives\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKhan, Aamir T; Shehmar, Manjeet; Gupta, Janesh K\n\n2014-01-01\n\nUterine fibroids are a major cause of morbidity in women of a reproductive age (and sometimes even after menopause). There are several factors that are attributed to underlie the development and incidence of these common tumors, but this further corroborates their relatively unknown etiology. The most likely presentation of fibroids is by their effect on the womanâs menstrual cycle or pelvic pressure symptoms. Leiomyosarcoma is a very rare entity that should be suspected in postmenopausal women with fibroid growth (and no concurrent hormone replacement therapy). The gold standard diagnostic modality for uterine fibroids appears to be gray-scale ultrasonography, with magnetic resonance imaging being a close second option in complex clinical circumstances. The management of uterine fibroids can be approached medically, surgically, and even by minimal access techniques. The recent introduction of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) and aromatase inhibitors has added more armamentarium to the medical options of treatment. Uterine artery embolization (UAE) has now been well-recognized as a uterine-sparing (fertility-preserving) method of treating fibroids. More recently, the introduction of ultrasound waves (MRgFUS) or radiofrequency (VizAblateâ¢ and Acessaâ¢) for uterine fibroid ablation has added to the options of minimal access treatment. More definite surgery in the form of myomectomy or hysterectomy can be performed via the minimal access or open route methods. Our article seeks to review the already established information on uterine fibroids with added emphasis on contemporary knowledge. PMID:24511243\n\nUterine fibroids: clinical manifestations and contemporary management.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoherty, Leo; Mutlu, Levent; Sinclair, Donna; Taylor, Hugh\n\n2014-09-01\n\nUterine fibroids (leiomyomata) are extremely common lesions that are associated with detrimental effects including infertility and abnormal uterine bleeding. Fibroids cause molecular changes at the level of endometrium. Abnormal regulation of growth factors and cytokines in fibroid cells may contribute to negative endometrial effects. Understanding of fibroid biology has greatly increased over the last decade. Although the current armamentarium of Food and Drug Administration-approved medical therapies is limited, there are medications approved for use in heavy menstrual bleeding that can be used for the medical management of fibroids. Emergence of the role of growth factors in pathophysiology of fibroids has led researchers to develop novel therapeutics. Despite advances in medical therapies, surgical management remains a mainstay of fibroid treatment. Destruction of fibroids by interventional radiological procedures provides other effective treatments. Further experimental studies and clinical trials are required to determine which therapies will provide the greatest benefits to patients with fibroids. Â© The Author(s) 2014.\n\nFibroids and in-vitro fertilization: which comes first?\n\nPubMed\n\nRackow, Beth W; Arici, Aydin\n\n2005-06-01\n\nThere is no consensus about the impact of uterine fibroids on fertility. This review explores past and recent studies that investigated the effects of submucosal, intramural, and subserosal fibroids on in-vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes. We discuss the importance of proper evaluation of the uterus and endometrial cavity, and current options for optimal fibroid management in patients desiring fertility. Several studies have reviewed the data on fibroids and infertility, further exploring this potential relationship. Two recent studies investigated reproductive outcomes before and after myomectomy, and IVF outcomes based on fibroid size and location. Both studies concluded that fibroids can impair reproductive outcomes. Several papers thoroughly reviewed medical and surgical management options for patients with fibroids and desired fertility. Although several medical therapies may reduce fibroid volume or decrease menorrhagia, myomectomy remains the standard of care for future fertility. Recent data identified an increased rate of pregnancy complications after uterine artery embolization compared with laparoscopic myomectomy. A new procedure, magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound ablation, shows promise for the management of symptomatic fibroids, and possibly for the management of fibroids prior to pregnancy. As with embolization, more data are needed to evaluate postprocedure fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Fibroid location, followed by size, is the most important factor determining the impact of fibroids on IVF outcomes. Any distortion of the endometrial cavity seriously affects IVF outcomes, and myomectomy is indicated in this situation. Myomectomy should also be considered for patients with large fibroids, and for patients with unexplained unsuccessful IVF cycles.\n\nRole of vitamin D in uterine fibroid biology.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrakta, Soumia; Diamond, Justin S; Al-Hendy, Ayman; Diamond, Michael P; Halder, Sunil K\n\n2015-09-01\n\nTo provide a detailed summary of current scientific knowledge on uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) inÂ vitro and in inÂ vivo animal models, as well as to postulate the potential role of vitamin D3 as an effective, inexpensive, safe, long-term treatment option for uterine fibroids. PubMed search articles were used to identify the most relevant studies on uterine fibroids, as well as effects of vitamin D3 on uterine fibroid cells and fibroid tumor growth in inÂ vivo animal models. University research laboratory. Not applicable. None. Not applicable. Despite numerous publications available on uterine fibroids, information about the role that vitamin D3 plays in the regulation of uterine fibroids is limited. Most of the recent vitamin D3-related studies on uterine fibroids were published from our group. Recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D deficiency plays a significant role in the development of uterine fibroids. Our recent studies have demonstrated that vitamin D3 reduces leiomyoma cell proliferation inÂ vitro and leiomyoma tumor growth in inÂ vivo animal models. These results postulate the potential role of vitamin D3 for an effective, safe, nonsurgical medical treatment option for uterine fibroids. This article reviews human and animal studies and uncovers new possibilities for understanding the vitamin D-based therapeutic option for an effective, safe, long-term treatment of uterine fibroids. On the basis of these results, a clinical trial with vitamin D3 or a hypocalcemic analog, paricalcitol, may be warranted for nonsurgical medical treatment of uterine fibroids.

METHODS: We conducted an electronic search on the following databases PubMed and Medline (1950-2013); (1980-2013); Cochrane library (1993-2013). RESULTS: A total of 36 articles were retrieved after the initial electronic search. Careful assessment of the retrieved studies led to the final selection of 5 articles for inclusion in the review. CONCLUSION: Tranexamic acid may reduce blood loss perioperatively in myomectomies. It may reduce the menorrhagia in patients with fibroids, however a stratification of fibroids by size and location is required to define the responses. It is safe in general, with mild adverse effects observed in some cases. More studies with a double-blind randomized design and larger numbers of participants are necessary to reach more precise and safe conclusions. PMID:25516866\n\nThe natural history of fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nMavrelos, D; Ben-Nagi, J; Holland, T; Hoo, W; Naftalin, J; Jurkovic, D\n\n2010-02-01\n\nFibroids are common, hormone-dependent, benign uterine tumors. They can cause significant morbidity and the symptoms depend largely on their size. The aim of this study was to describe the natural history of fibroids and identify factors that may influence their growth. This was a retrospective longitudinal study of premenopausal women who were diagnosed with uterine fibroids on ultrasound examination. All women underwent at least two transvaginal ultrasound scans, which were all performed by a single operator. Fibroids were measured in three perpendicular planes and the mean diameter was calculated. The size and position of every individual fibroid was assessed and recorded on a computerized database. The volume of each fibroid was calculated using the formula for a sphere. A total of 122 women were included in the study. Their median age at the initial examination was 40 (range, 27-45) years. Seventy-two (59.0%) were nulliparous and 74 (60.7%) had multiple fibroids. The median interval between the initial and final examination was 21.5 (range, 8-90) months. The median fibroid volume increased by 35.2% per year. Small fibroids (< 20 mm mean diameter) grew significantly faster than larger fibroids (P = 0.007). The median increase in size was significantly higher in cases of intramural fibroids (53.2 (interquartile range (IQR), 11.2-217)%) than in subserous fibroids (25.1 (IQR, 1.1-87.1)%) and submucous fibroids (22.8 (IQR, - 11.7 to 48.3)%) (P = 0.012). Multivariate analysis retained only fibroid size at presentation as an independent predictor of fibroid growth. The growth of fibroids in premenopausal women is influenced by the tumor's size at presentation.\n\nImage-guided thermal therapy of uterine fibroids\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShen, Shu-Huei; Fennessy, Fiona; McDannold, Nathan; Jolesz, Ferenc; Tempany, Clare\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThermal ablation is an established treatment for tumor. The merging of newly developed imaging techniques has allowed precise targeting and real-time thermal mapping. This article provides an overview of the image-guided thermal ablation techniques in the treatment of uterine fibroids. Background on uterine fibroids, including epidemiology, histology, symptoms, imaging findings and current treatment options, is first outlined. After describing the principle of magnetic resonance thermal imaging, we introduce the applications of image-guided thermal therapies, including laser ablation, radiofrequency ablation, cryotherapy and particularly the newest, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery, and how they apply to uterine fibroid treatment.

Uterine fibroid reduction and symptom relief after uterine artery embolization for fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nPron, Gaylene; Bennett, John; Common, Andrew; Wall, Jane; Asch, Murray; Sniderman, Kenneth\n\n2003-01-01\n\nTo evaluate fibroid uterine volume reduction, symptom relief, and patient satisfaction with uterine artery embolization (UAE) for symptomatic fibroids. Multicenter, prospective, single-arm clinical treatment trial. Eight Ontario university and community hospitals. Five hundred thirty-eight patients undergoing bilateral UAE. Bilateral UAE performed with polyvinyl alcohol particles sized 355-500 microm. Three-month follow-up evaluations including fibroid uterine volume reductions, patient reported symptom improvement (7-point scale), symptom life-impact (10-point scale) reduction, and treatment satisfaction (6-point scale). Median uterine and dominant fibroid volume reductions were 35% and 42%, respectively. Significant improvements were reported for menorrhagia (83%), dysmenorrhea (77%), and urinary frequency/urgency (86%). Mean menstrual duration was significantly reduced after UAE (7.6 to 5.4 days). Improvements in menorrhagia were unrelated to pre-UAE uterine size or post-UAE uterine volume reduction. Amenorrhea occurring after the procedure was highly age dependent, ranging from 3% (1%-7%) in women under age 40 to 41% (26%-58%) in women age 50 or older. Median fibroid life-impact scores were significantly reduced after UAE (8.0 to 3.0). The majority (91%) expressed satisfaction with UAE treatment. UAE reduced fibroid uterine volume and provided significant relief of menorrhagia that was unrelated to initial fibroid uterine size or volume reduction. Patient satisfaction with short-term UAE treatment outcomes was high.\n\nImpact of periodic health examination on surgical treatment for uterine fibroids in Beijing: a case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Hai-Yun; Yang, Ling-Ling; Zhou, Shan\n\n2010-12-07\n\nDuring the past 2 decades, there has been a rapid proliferation of \"health examination center (HEC)\" across China. The effects of their services on public's health have not been systemically investigated. This study aimed to assess the impact of periodic health examination (PHE) at HEC on surgical treatment for uterine fibroids in Beijing residents. We identified 224 patients with a primary diagnosis of uterine fibroids who had surgical treatment at four Level-1 general hospitals in Beijing, from June 1, 2009 to October 20, 2009. Controls were women who did not have surgery for uterine fibroids, matched (1:1 ratio) for age (within 2 years). A standard questionnaire was used to inquire about whether participants had PHE at HEC during the previous 2 years. PHE at HEC within 2 years were associated with surgical treatment for uterine fibroids. Odds ratios was 4.05 (95% CI, 2.61-6.29 P < 0.001), after adjustment for marital status, whether have children, annual family income, health insurance, education level and self-rated uterine fibroids-related symptom severity. Our study showed PHE currently provided at HEC in China were associated with significantly increased use of surgical treatment for uterine fibroids in women. Further studies are needed to assess the effects of PHE on clinical as well as on broad societal outcomes in Chinese in contemporary medical settings.\n\nUterine Fibroid Embolization for Symptomatic Fibroids: Study at a Teaching Hospital in Kenya\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMutai, John Kiprop; Vinayak, Sudhir; Stones, William; Hacking, Nigel; Mariara, Charles\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective: Characterization of magnetic (MRI) features in women undergoing uterine fibroid embolization (UFE) and identification of clinical correlates in an African population. Materials and Methods: Patients with symptomatic fibroids who are selected to undergo UFE at the hospital formed the study population. The baseline MRI features, baseline symptom score, short-term imaging outcome, and mid-term symptom scores were analyzed for interval changes. Assessment of potential associations between short-term imaging features and mid-term symptom scores was also done. Results: UFE resulted in statistically significant reduction (P < 0.001) of dominant fibroid, uterine volumes, and reduction of symptom severity scores, which were 43.7%, 40.1%, and 37.8%, respectively. Also, 59% of respondents had more than 10 fibroids. The predominant location of the dominant fibroid was intramural. No statistically significant association was found between clinical and radiological outcome. Conclusion: The response of uterine fibroids to embolization in the African population is not different from the findings reported in other studies from the west. The presence of multiple and large fibroids in this study is consistent with the case mix described in other studies of African-American populations. Patient counseling should emphasize the independence of volume reduction and symptom improvement. Though volume changes are of relevance for the radiologist in understanding the evolution of the condition and identifying potential technical treatment failures, it should not be the main basis of evaluation of treatment success.

Clinical presentations include abnormal bleeding, pelvic masses, pelvic pain, infertility, bulk symptoms and obstetric complications. Almost a third of women with leiomyomas will request treatment due to symptoms. Current management strategies mainly involve surgical interventions, but the choice of treatment is guided by patient's age and desire to preserve fertility or avoid âradicalâ surgery such as hysterectomy. The management of uterine fibroids also depends on the number, size and location of the fibroids. Other surgical and non-surgical approaches include myomectomy by hysteroscopy, myomectomy by laparotomy or laparoscopy, uterine artery embolization and interventions performed under radiologic or ultrasound guidance to induce thermal ablation of the uterine fibroids. There are only a few randomized trials comparing various therapies for fibroids. Further investigations are required as there is a lack of concrete evidence of effectiveness and areas of uncertainty surrounding correct management according to symptoms. The economic impact of uterine fibroid management is significant and it is imperative that new treatments be developed to provide alternatives to surgical intervention. There is growing evidence of the crucial role of progesterone pathways in the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids due to the use of selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs) such as ulipristal acetate (UPA). The efficacy of long-term intermittent use of UPA was recently demonstrated by randomized controlled studies. The need for alternatives to surgical intervention is very real, especially for women seeking to preserve their fertility. These options now exist, with SPRMs which are proven to treat fibroid symptoms effectively. Gynecologists now have new tools in their armamentarium, opening up novel strategies for the management of uterine fibroids. PMID\n\nDealing with uterine fibroids in reproductive medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nGambadauro, P\n\n2012-04-01\n\nWomen who wish to conceive are nowadays more likely to present with uterine fibroids, mainly because of the delay in childbearing in our society. The relationship between uterine fibroids and human reproduction is still controversial and counselling patients might sometimes be challenging. This paper is to assist those involved in the management of patients of reproductive age presenting with uterine fibroids. The interference of fibroids on fertility largely depends on their location. Submucous fibroids interfere with fertility and should be removed in infertile patients, regardless of the size or the presence of symptoms. Intramural fibroids distorting the cavity reduce the chances of conception, while investigations on intramural fibroids not distorting the cavity have so far given controversial results. No evidence supports the systematic removal of subserosal fibroids in asymptomatic, infertile patients. Myomectomy is still the 'gold standard' in fibroid treatment for fertility-wishing patients. In experienced hands, hysteroscopic myomectomy is minimally invasive, safe, and effective. Abdominal and laparoscopic myomectomy might be challenging, but potential risks could be reduced by new strategies and techniques.\n\nUterine fibroid management: from the present to the future.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonnez, Jacques; Dolmans, Marie-Madeleine\n\n2016-11-01\n\nUterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas or myomas) are the most common form of benign uterine tumors.

Two large epidemiologic cohorts have provided some support for increased fibroid risk with infant soy formula feeding in women, but both cohorts relied on self-report of clinically diagnosed fibroids. Objective: We evaluated the relationship between infant soy formula feeding and ultrasound-detected fibroids. Methods: The Study of Environment, Lifestyle & Fibroids (SELF) is an ongoing cohort study of 1,696 African-American women ages 23â34 years with baseline ultrasound screening to detect and measure fibroids â¥ 0.5 cm in diameter. Questionnaire data on soy formula feeding during infancy was ascertained for 1,553 participants (89% based on motherâs report), of whom 345 were found to have fibroids. We estimated the association between soy formula feeding and fibroid prevalence and tumor number using log-binomial regression. Among those with fibroids, we compared fibroid size between soy formula-exposed and unexposed women using multivariable linear regression. Results: We did not observe an association between soy formula feeding and fibroid prevalence [adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.3]. Nor were exposed women with fibroids more likely to have â¥ 2 tumors than unexposed women with fibroids (aPR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.7, 1.6). However, exposed women with fibroids had significantly larger fibroids than unexposed women with fibroids. On average, soy formula feeding was associated with a 32% increase in the diameter of the largest fibroid (95% CI: 6%, 65%) and a 127% increase in total tumor volume (95% CI: 12%, 358%). Conclusions: Our observation that women fed soy formula as infants have larger fibroids than unexposed women provides further support for persistent effects of early life phytoestrogen exposure on the uterus.

Patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids (n = 101) were treated by selective bilateral UAE using 500- to 710-{mu}m polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles. Baseline measures of clinical symptoms, sonography, and MRI taken before the procedure were compared to those taken 1, 3, 6, and 12 months later. Complications and outcomes were analyzed for associations with fibroid size, location, and number. Reductions in mean fibroid volume were similar in patients with single (66.6 {+-} 21.5%) andmoreÂ Â» multiple (67.4 {+-} 25.0%) fibroids (p-value = 0.83). Menstrual improvement occurred in patients with single (93.3%) and multiple (72.2%) fibroids (p = 0.18). Changes in submucosal and other fibroids were not significantly different between the two groups (p's > 0.56). Linear regression analysis between primary fibroid volume as independent variable and percentage reduction of fibroid volume after 1 year yielded an R{sup 2} of 0.083 and the model coefficient was not statistically significant (p = 0.072). Multivariate regression models revealed no statistically or clinically significant coefficients or odds ratios for three independent variables (primary fibroid size, total number, and fibroid location) and all outcome variables (percent reduction of uterus and fibroid volumes in 1 year, improvement of clinical symptoms [menstrual, bulk related, and urinary] in 1 year, and complications after UAE). In conclusion, neither the success rate nor the probability of complications was affected by the primary fibroid size, location, or total number of fibroids.Â«Â less\n\nModern management of uterine fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nLevy, Barbara S\n\n2008-01-01\n\nUterine fibroids are the most common tumor of the reproductive tract in women of reproductive age. Although they are benign tumors that are often asymptomatic, uterine fibroids may cause debilitating symptoms in many women, such as abnormal uterine bleeding, abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, urinary frequency, constipation, pregnancy loss, dyspareunia, and in some cases infertility. Several approaches are available for the treatment of uterine fibroids. These include pharmacologic options, such as hormonal therapies and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists; surgical approaches, such as hysterectomy, myomectomy, myolysis, laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion, magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery, and uterine artery embolization. The choice of approach may be dictated by factors such as the patient's desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumor characteristics. New treatment options for uterine fibroids would be minimally invasive, have long-term data demonstrating efficacy and safety, have minimal or no incidence of fibroid recurrence, be easy to perform, preserve fertility, and be cost effective. New treatment approaches are under investigation, with the goals of being effective, safe, and less invasive.\n\nIntraoperative ultrasound-assisted enucleation of residual fibroids following laparoscopic myomectomy.\n\nPubMed\n\nHao, Yan; Li, Si-Jing; Zheng, Ping; Wu, Xia; Sheng, Jie; Yuan, Dong-Lan; Zhou, Qi; Wei, Wei; Duan, Ai-Hong; Wu, Qing-Qing; Lu, Dan\n\n2018-05-25\n\nTo investigate if intraoperative ultrasounds by laparoscopic and transvaginal ultrasonography (LUS and TVS) could improve enucleating the residual fibroids following laparoscopic myomectomy (LM). From March to December 2016, 78 women with uterine fibroids underwent LM, LUS and TVS were applied to detect residual fibroids and to guide surgeons to enucleate them after the visible fibroids were removed during LM operation. The total number of residual fibroids found by LUS was 140, and the total number found by TVS was 127 following LM (Pâ¯=â¯0.03). LUS is statistically superior to TVS in the detection of residual fibroids in the anterior wall (Pâ¯=â¯0.004), in the detection of intramural fibroids (Pâ¯=â¯0.002), and in the detection of fibroids with a diameter ranging from 0.5 to 1â¯cm (Pâ¯=â¯0.002). According to the total number of enucleated fibroids by LM, patients were divided into three groups (Group 1: 2 to 4, Group 2: 5 to 7 and Group 3: â¥8 fibroid counts). The percentages of patients in each group with residual fibroids at the end of surgery were 22.2%, 51.9% and 66.7% respectively. Both LUS and TVS are beneficial to surgical treatment of fibroids by assisting enucleation of residual fibroids following LM, while LUS is more effective in localizing residual fibroids than TVS.

Summary Statements 1. Subserosal fibroids do not appear to have an impact on fertility; the effect of intramural fibroids remains unclear. If intramural fibroids do have an impact on fertility, it appears to be small and to be even less significant when the endometrium is not involved. (II-3) 2. Because current medical therapy for fibroids is associated with suppression of ovulation, reduction of estrogen production, or disruption of the target action of estrogen or progesterone at the receptor level, and it has the potential to interfere in endometrial development and implantation, there is no role for medical therapy as a stand-alone treatment for fibroids in the infertile population. (III) 3. Preoperative assessment of submucosal fibroids is essential to the decision on the best approach for treatment. (III) 4. There is little evidence on the use of Foley catheters, estrogen, or intrauterine devices for the prevention of intrauterine adhesions following hysteroscopic myomectomy. (II-3) 5. In the infertile population, cumulative pregnancy rates by the laparoscopic and the minilaparotomy approaches are similar, but the laparoscopic approach is associated with a quicker recovery, less postoperative pain, and less febrile morbidity. (II-2) 6. There are lower pregnancy rates, higher miscarriage rates, and more adverse pregnancy outcomes following uterine artery embolization than after myomectomy.

Baseline patient characteristics, fibroid burden, and impact on life.\n\nPubMed\n\nPron, Gaylene; Cohen, Marsha; Soucie, Jennifer; Garvin, Greg; Vanderburgh, Leslie; Bell, Stuart\n\n2003-01-01\n\nTo determine baseline characteristics of women undergoing uterine artery embolization (UAE) for symptomatic fibroids. Multicenter, prospective, single-arm clinical treatment trial. Eight Ontario university and community hospitals. Five hundred fifty-five women undergoing UAE for fibroids. Baseline questionnaires completed before UAE. Questionnaires were analyzed for demographic, medical, and gynecologic histories. Fibroid symptoms, impact of symptoms, previous consultations, and treatments were also analyzed. The Ontario cohort (66% white, 23% black, 11% other races) had an average age of 43. Thirty-one percent were under age 40. Most women were university educated (68%) and working outside the home (85%). Women reported heavy menstrual bleeding (80%), urinary urgency/frequency (73%), pain during intercourse (41%), and work absences (40%). They experienced fibroid-related symptoms for an average of 5 years and consulted with on average of three gynecologists before UAE. High fibroid life-impact scores were reported by 58%. Black women were significantly younger (40.7 vs. 44.0 years), more likely to experience symptoms longer (7 vs. 5 years), and more likely to undergo myomectomy before UAE (24% vs. 9%) than white women. Our study illustrates that large numbers of women with highly symptomatic fibroid disease are averse to surgery despite their burden of suffering and are actively seeking alternatives to hysterectomy.\n\nUterine Fibroids: Diagnosis and Treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nDe La Cruz, Maria Syl D; Buchanan, Edward M\n\n2017-01-15\n\nUterine fibroids are common benign neoplasms, with a higher prevalence in older women and in those of African descent. Many are discovered incidentally on clinical examination or imaging in asymptomatic women. Fibroids can cause abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pressure, bowel dysfunction, urinary frequency and urgency, urinary retention, low back pain, constipation, and dyspareunia. Ultrasonography is the preferred initial imaging modality. Expectant management is recommended for asymptomatic patients because most fibroids decrease in size during menopause. Management should be tailored to the size and location of fibroids; the patient's age, symptoms, desire to maintain fertility, and access to treatment; and the experience of the physician. Medical therapy to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding includes hormonal contraceptives, tranexamic acid, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or selective progesterone receptor modulators are an option for patients who need symptom relief preoperatively or who are approaching menopause. Surgical treatment includes hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery.\n\nThe conservative and interventional treatment of fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoosz, Alexander Stephan; Reimer, Peter; Matzko, Matthias; RÃ¶mer, Thomas; MÃ¼ller, Andreas\n\n2014-12-22\n\nFibroids are the most common benign tumors in women. One-third of all women of reproductive age undergo treatment for symptomatic fibroids. In recent years, the spectrum of available treatments has been widened by the introduction of new drugs and interventional procedures. Selective literature review on the treatment of uterine fibroids, including consideration of several Cochrane Reviews. Fibroids can be treated with drugs, interventional procedures (uterine artery embolization [UAE] and focused ultrasound treatment [FUS]), and surgery. The evidence regarding the various available treatments is mixed. All methods improve symptoms, but only a few comparative studies have been performed. A meta-analysis revealed that recovery within 15 days is more common after laparoscopic enucleation than after open surgery (odds ratio [OR], 3.2). A minimally invasive hysterectomy, or one performed by the vaginal route, is associated with a shorter hospital stay and a more rapid recovery than open transabdominal hysterectomy. UAE is an alternative to hysterectomy for selected patients. The re-intervention rates after fibroid enucleation, hysterectomy, and UAE are 8.9-9%, 1.8-10.7%, and 7-34.6%, respectively. The main drugs used to treat fibroids are gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs and selective progesterone receptor modulators. Multiple treatment options are available and enable individualized therapy for symptomatic fibroids. The most important considerations in the choice of treatment are the question of family planning and, in some cases, the technical limitations of the treatments themselves.\n\nUterine fibroids â whatâs new?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWilliams, Alistair R.W.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUterine fibroids are the commonest benign tumours of women and affect all races with a cumulative lifetime risk of around 70%. Despite their high prevalence and the heavy economic burden of treatment, fibroids have received remarkably little attention compared to common female malignant tumours. This article reviews recent progress in understanding the biological nature of fibroids, their life cycle and their molecular genetic origins. Recent progress in surgical and interventional management is briefly reviewed, and medical management options, including treatment with selective progesterone receptor modulators, are also discussed.

Materials and Methods: Thirty-five consecutive women (mean age 43 years; range 26-52 years) with symptomatic uterine fibroids underwent UAE and MR imaging before and within 2 months after UAE. The patients were divided into incomplete and complete fibroid infarction groups on the basis of the postprocedural gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging findings. Two independent observers reviewed unenhanced MR angiography before and after UAE to determine bilateral uterine and ovarian arterial flowmoreÂ Â» scores. The total arterial flow scores were calculated by summing the scores of the 4 arteries. All scores were compared with the Mann-Whitney test. Results: Fourteen and 21 patients were assigned to the incomplete and complete fibroid infarction groups, respectively. The total arterial flow score in the incomplete fibroid infarction group was significantly greater than that in the complete fibroid infarction group (P = 0.019 and P = 0.038 for observers 1 and 2, respectively). In 3 patients, additional therapy was recommended for insufficient fibroid infarction. In 1 of the 3 patients, bilateral ovarian arteries were invisible before UAE but seemed enlarged after UAE. Conclusion: The total arterial flow from bilateral uterine and ovarian arteries in patients with incomplete fibroid infarction is less well reduced than in those with complete fibroid infarction. Postprocedural MR angiography provides useful information to estimate the cause of insufficient fibroid infarction in individual cases.Â«Â less\n\nLaparoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Radiofrequency Ablation of Uterine Fibroids\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMilic, Andrea; Asch, Murray R.; Hawrylyshyn, Peter A.\n\nFour patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids measuring less than 6 cm underwent laparoscopic ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) using multiprobe-array electrodes. Follow-up of the treated fibroids was performed with gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and patients' symptoms were assessed by telephone interviews. The procedure was initially technically successful in 3 of the 4 patients and MRI studies at 1 month demonstrated complete fibroid ablation. Symptom improvement, including a decrease in menstrual bleeding and pain, was achieved in 2 patients at 3 months. At 7 months, 1 of these 2 patients experienced symptom worsening which correlated with recurrent fibroid on MRI. ThemoreÂ Â» third, initially technically successfully treated patient did not experience any symptom relief after the procedure and was ultimately diagnosed with adenomyosis. Our preliminary results suggest that RFA is a technically feasible treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids in appropriately selected patients.Â«Â less\n\nMR-guided Focused Ultrasound for Uterine Fibroids\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n...

The aim of the present study was to explore the association between number of induced and spontaneous abortions and the risk of uterine fibroids in middle-aged and older Chinese women. A total of 14,595 retired female employees from the Dongfeng-Tongji cohort study were included in our analysis. Information on induced and spontaneous abortions was collected by trained interviewers through face-to-face interviews. Diagnosis of uterine fibroids was based on ultrasound or self-reported physician diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between number of induced and spontaneous abortions and the risk of uterine fibroids. The prevalence of uterine fibroids was 15.1% among all participants. Higher number of induced abortions was associated with an increased risk of uterine fibroids (1 induced abortion: odds ratios [ORs]â=â1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-1.48; 2 induced abortions: ORâ=â1.45, 95% CI 1.28-1.64; and â¥3 induced abortions: ORâ=â1.62, 95% CI 1.39-1.90). Compared with women without induced abortion, ORs for women with 1, 2, and â¥3 were 1.17 (95% CI 1.03-1.32), 1.21 (95% CI 1.06-1.39), and 1.36 (95% CI 1.15-1.61), respectively, after adjustment for potential confounders. No association was observed between the number of spontaneous abortions and the risk of uterine fibroids. The findings of this study showed that induced abortion may be an independent risk factor for uterine fibroids in middle-aged and older Chinese women.\n\nDegenerated uterine fibroid mimicking hydrometra: fallacy in CT\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTok, CH; Bux, SI; Mohamed, SI; Lim, BK\n\n2006-01-01\n\nFibroids are the commonest uterine neoplasms, occurring in 20% - 30% of women of reproductive age.

Methods Of the 157 patients who had received MRgFUS treatment in the Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Hospital from March, 2015 to February, 2016; this study examined 6 of the cases where, after high intensity focused ultrasound treatment, intramural uterine fibroids protruded towards the endometrial cavity to be removed by hysteroscopic myomectomy. The high intensity focused ultrasound utilized in the cases were Philips Achieva 1.5 Tesla MR (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) and Sonalleve HIFU system. Results The volume of fibroids ranged from 26.0 cm3 to 199.5 cm3, averaging 95.6 cm3. The major axis length ranged from 4.0 cm to 8.2 cm, averaging 6.3 cm. Fibroid location in all of the patients was in intramural uterine before treatment but after the high intensity focused ultrasound treatment, the fibroids were observed to protrude towards the endometrial cavity in at least Day 5 or up to Day 73 to allow hysteroscopic myomectomy. Conclusions In some cases, after an intramural uterine fibroid is treated with MRgFUS, fibroid volume is decreased and the fibroid protrudes towards the endometrial cavity. In this case, hysteroscopic myomectomy can be a useful solution.

The procedure utilizes recent technological advancements in instrumentation and imaging, allowing surgeons to treat numerous fibroids of varying size and location in a minimally invasive fashion. Early and mid-term data from multi-center clinical trials have demonstrated safety and efficacy, with resolution or improvement of symptoms and significant volume reduction. Re-intervention rates for fibroid symptoms have been low. The procedure is well tolerated with a typically uneventful and rapid recovery requiring NSAIDs only for postoperative pain. While post RFA pregnancy data are limited, the results are promising.\n\nLong-term treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate â.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonnez, Jacques; VÃ¡zquez, Francisco; Tomaszewski, Janusz; Nouri, Kazem; Bouchard, Philippe; Fauser, Bart C J M; Barlow, David H; Palacios, Santiago; Donnez, Olivier; Bestel, Elke; Osterloh, Ian; Loumaye, Ernest\n\n2014-06-01\n\nTo investigate the efficacy and safety of ulipristal acetate (UPA) for long-term treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids.

Patients received up to four 3-month courses of UPA 10 mg daily, immediately followed by 10-day double-blind treatment with NETA (10 mg daily) or placebo. Amenorrhea, fibroid volume, endometrial histology. After the first UPA course, amenorrhea occurred in 79% of women, with median onset (from treatment start) of 4 days (interquartile range, 2-6 days). Median fibroid volume change was -45% (interquartile range, -66%; -25%). Amenorrhea rates were 89%, 88%, and 90% for the 131, 119, and 107 women who received treatment courses 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Median times to amenorrhea were 2, 3, and 3 days for treatment courses 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Median fibroid volume changes from baseline were -63%, -67%, and -72% after treatment courses 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

A 37-year-old patient, gravida 1, abortus 1, with uterine fibroids was treated with 5âmg of UA daily for 13 weeks starting eight months after a multiple laparotomic myomectomy. Fibroid shrinkage and restoration of the morphology of endometrial cavity were evaluated in order to allow a subsequent pregnancy. A decrease of the uterine fibroids and a normal morphology of the endometrial cavity were noted by transvaginal ultrasound after treatment. An endometrial biopsy excluded histologic endometrial changes. Three months after the end of UA the patient reported amenorrhea for 5 weeks and a clinical pregnancy was confirmed with transvaginal ultrasound. She underwent a subsequent uneventful pregnancy. Thus, the spontaneous pregnancy after UA to reduce fibroid size may support the potential clinical utility of this selective progesterone receptor modulator in the management of women with pregnancy desire and uterine fibroids after a prior myomectomy. Patients who refuse a new surgical procedure and/or those who are going to undergo assisted reproductive techniques would benefit from UA. It effectively shrinks fibroids, avoids risks of a new surgical procedure, and allows an immediate attempt at conception after the end of treatment.\n\nClinical limitations of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification of uterine fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaughlin-Tommaso, Shannon K; Hesley, Gina K; Hopkins, Matthew R; Brandt, Kathleen R; Zhu, Yunxiao; Stewart, Elizabeth A\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo determine the reproducibility of classifying uterine fibroids using the 2011 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system. The present retrospective cohort study included patients presenting for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids at the Gynecology Fibroid Clinic at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA, between April 1, 2013 and April 1, 2014. Magnetic resonance imaging of fibroid uteri was performed and the images were independently reviewed by two academic gynecologists and two radiologists specializing in fibroid care. Fibroid classifications assigned by each physician were compared and the significance of the variations was graded by whether they would affect surgical planning. There were 42 fibroids from 23 patients; only 6 (14%) fibroids had unanimous classification agreement. The majority (36 [86%]) had at least two unique answers and 4 (10%) fibroids had four unique classifications. Variations in classification were notÂ associated with physician specialty. More than one-third of the classification discrepancies would have impacted surgical planning. FIGO fibroid classification was not consistent among four fibroid specialists. The variation was clinically significant for 36% of the fibroids. Additional validation of the FIGO fibroid classification system is needed.

In addition to International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis and procedure codes and clinical characteristics, text data-mining software was used to derive information from imaging reports to confirm the presence of uterine fibroids. Results of each algorithm were compared with expert manual review to calculate the positive predictive values for each algorithm. Algorithm 1 was composed of the following criteria: (1) age 18-54 years; (2) either â¥1 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for uterine fibroids or mention of fibroids using text-mined key words in imaging records or documents; and (3) no International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision or Current Procedural Terminology codes for hysterectomy and no reported history of hysterectomy. The positive predictive value was 47% (95% confidence interval 39-56%). Algorithm 2 required â¥2 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for fibroids and positive text-mined key words and had a positive predictive value of 65% (95% confidence interval 50-79%). In algorithm 3, further refinements included â¥2 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision diagnosis codes for fibroids on separate outpatient visit dates, the exclusion of women who had a positive pregnancy test within 3 months of their fibroid-related visit, and exclusion of incidentally detected fibroids during prenatal or emergency department visits. Algorithm 3 achieved a positive predictive value of 76% (95% confidence interval 71-81%). An electronic health record-based algorithm is capable of identifying cases of symptomatic uterine fibroids with moderate positive predictive value and may be an efficient approach for large-scale study recruitment.

Materials and Methods: The medical records of 772 patients who underwent hysterectomy because of uterine fibroids were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of endometrial polyps in the histopathologic examination. Demographic, clinical and histopathologic findings of the patients with and without endometrial polyps were compared. Studentâs t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearsonâs Chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis were used for statistical analysis. Results: The prevalence of the endometrial polyps in uterine fibroid cases was found 20.1% (n=155). Age â¥45 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.06-2.44]; p=0.014), presence of hypertension (23.9% vs. 17.5%; p=0.047), endometrial hyperplasia (OR 4.00; 95% CI: [1.92-8.33]; p<0.001) and cervical polyps (OR 3.13; 95% CI: [1.69-5.88]; p<0.001) were significantly associated with the coexistence of endometrial polyps and uterine fibroids. Endometrial polyps were more common in patients with â¥2 fibroids (p=0.023) and largest fibroid <8 cm (p=0.009). A negative correlation was found between condom use and endometrial polyps (8.1% vs. 3.9%; p=0.044). Conclusions: The prevalence of the endometrial polyps coexisting with uterine fibroids was 20.1%. Age, hypertension, endometrial hyperplasia, cervical polyps, and number of fibroids were positively correlated; condom use and size of largest fibroid were negatively correlated with the coexistence of these two pathologies.

W.; McKillop, Graham; Walker, Jane; Horne, Andrew W.; Newby, David E.; Anderson, Richard A.; Semple, Scott I.; Marshall, Ian; Lewis, Steff C.; Millar, Robert P.; Bastin, Mark E.; Critchley, Hilary O. D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective There are no long-term medical treatments for uterine fibroids, and non-invasive biomarkers are needed to evaluate novel therapeutic interventions. The aim of this study was to determine whether serial dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and magnetization transfer MRI (MT-MRI) are able to detect changes that accompany volume reduction in patients administered GnRH analogue drugs, a treatment which is known to reduce fibroid volume and perfusion. Our secondary aim was to determine whether rapid suppression of ovarian activity by combining GnRH agonist and antagonist therapies results in faster volume reduction. Methods Forty women were assessed for eligibility at gynaecology clinics in the region, of whom thirty premenopausal women scheduled for hysterectomy due to symptomatic fibroids were randomized to three groups, receiving (1) GnRH agonist (Goserelin), (2) GnRH agonist+GnRH antagonist (Goserelin and Cetrorelix) or (3) no treatment. Patients were monitored by serial structural, DCE-MRI and MT-MRI, as well as by ultrasound and serum oestradiol concentration measurements from enrolment to hysterectomy (approximately 3 months). Results A volumetric treatment effect assessed by structural MRI occurred by day 14 of treatment (9% median reduction versus 9% increase in untreated women; Pâ=â0.022) and persisted throughout. Reduced fibroid perfusion and permeability assessed by DCE-MRI occurred later and was demonstrable by 2â3 months (43% median reduction versus 20% increase respectively; Pâ=â0.0093). There was no apparent treatment effect by MT-MRI. Effective suppression of oestradiol was associated with early volume reduction at days 14 (Pâ=â0.041) and 28 (Pâ=â0.0061). Conclusion DCE-MRI is sensitive to the vascular changes thought to accompany successful GnRH analogue treatment of uterine fibroids and should be considered for use in future mechanism/efficacy studies of proposed fibroid drug therapies.

Four hundred and three patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids who underwent HIFU were retrospectively analyzed. The energy efficiency factor (EEF) was set as dependent variable, and the factors possibly affecting sonication dose included age, body mass index, size of uterine fibroid, abdominal wall thickness, the distance from uterine fibroid dorsal side to sacrum, the distance from uterine fibroid ventral side to skin, location of uterus, location of uterine fibroids, type of uterine fibroids, abdominal wall scar, signal intensity on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and enhancement type on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) were set as predictors to build a multiple regression model. The size of uterine fibroid, distance from fibroid ventral side to skin, location of uterus, location of uterine fibroids, type of uterine fibroids, signal intensity on T2WI, and enhancement type on T1WI had a linear correlation with EEF. The distance from fibroid ventral side to skin, enhancement type on T1WI, size of uterine fibroid, and signal intensity on T2WI were eventually incorporated into the dosimetry model. The distance from fibroid ventral side to skin, enhancement type on T1WI, size of uterine fibroid, and signal intensity on T2WI can be used as dosimetric predictors for HIFU for uterine fibroids.\n\nCDB-4124 does not cause apoptosis in cultured fibroid cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoeder, Hilary; Jayes, Friederike; Feng, Liping; Leppert, Phyllis C\n\n2011-09-01\n\nSelective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs), such as asoprisnil (J867) and ulipristal (CDB-2914), have been shown to reduce fibroid volume in vivo and to induce apoptosis in vitro. CDB-4124 (telapristone), a SPRM with different side groups, also reduced fibroid volume in vivo, and we hypothesized that this SPRM would also cause apoptosis in cultured fibroid cells. Immortalized, progesterone receptor-positive fibroid cells, known to be capable of apoptosis, were grown to 80% confluence in serum-containing media. Cells were then treated for 48 hours in serum-free media with 0, 10, 100, or 1000 nmol/L CDB-4124. Actinomycin-D and staurosporine were used as positive controls to induce apoptosis. Apoptosis was quantified using a TUNEL-fluorescein kit. Images were captured with a widefield-fluorescence microscope and analyzed using MetaMorph image analysis software. To validate results, Western blots of total cell lysates were probed for cleaved caspase-3 (c-CASP3). Experiments were repeated 3 times using independent cell batches. Analysis of 19 712 nuclei indicated 14.8% Â± 10.9% (mean Â± SEM), 8.4% Â± 4.6%, 8.2% Â± 4.7%, and 9.3% Â± 6.3% apoptosis in 0, 10, 100, and 1000 nmol/L CDB-4124-treated cells, respectively. There was no evidence of elevated c-CASP3 over vehicle control after treatment with CDB-4124. CDB-4124 did not significantly induce apoptosis in cultured fibroid cells under the conditions described suggesting apoptosis may not be the main pathway responsible for CDB-4124-induced fibroid shrinkage. Variations in SPRM biological effects may be due to differences in fibroid source cells, binding kinetics, or extracellular matrix characteristics, and can be exploited in further investigations of the mechanisms of action of SPRMs in fibroid biology.\n\nHigh-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) in Uterine Fibroid Treatment: Review Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMahmoud, Mustafa Z; Alkhorayef, Mohammed; Alzimami, Khalid S; Aljuhani, Manal Saud; Sulieman, Abdelmoneim\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHigh-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a highly precise medical procedure used locally to heat and destroy diseased tissue through ablation.

No experimental electrical conductivity data have previously been reported for human uterine fibroids. In this study electrical data (voltage) from selected inÂ vivo clinical procedures on human uterine fibroids were used to numerically model the treatments. Measured versus calculated power dissipation profiles were compared to determine uterine fibroid electrical conductivity. Numerical simulations were conducted utilising a wide range of values for tissue thermal conductivity, heat capacity and blood perfusion coefficient. The simulations demonstrated that power dissipation was insensitive to the exact values of these parameters for the simulated geometry, treatment duration, and power level. Consequently, it was possible to determine tissue electrical conductivity without precise knowledge of the values for these parameters. Results of this study showed that an electrical conductivity for uterine fibroids of 0.305âS/m at 37Â°C and a temperature coefficient of 0.2%/Â°C can be used for modelling Radio Frequency Ablation of human uterine fibroids at a frequency of 460âkHz for temperatures from 37Â°C to 100Â°C.\n\nLiving with uterine fibroids\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... care provider for uterine fibroids.

After surgery, she spontaneously sloughed a large mass of fibroids that arrested in the cervical canal during passage. Four days after gynecological extraction, she developed copious vaginal discharge that contained enteric contents. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a fistula between the small bowel and the uterus. She subsequently underwent hysterectomy, left oophorectomy, and small-bowel resection. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful.\n\nNew approaches to the management of fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaw, R W\n\n1991-12-01\n\nIt is clear that gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists have potential as a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of fibroids. They are effective in decreasing the size of most fibroids but, on ceasing treatment, regrowth does occur. Because of their effect on calcium homeostasis, long-term unopposed use of these agonists is not recommended. However, sequential addback therapies could be useful in both counterbalancing the hypoestrogenic side effects and in protecting bone mineral density. Although surgery is likely to remain the primary therapy for fibroids, pretreatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists for 3 to 4 months before myomectomy or before hysteroscopic resection offer many advantages in facilitating these procedures and reducing peroperative blood loss. Further studies are required to establish the most satisfactory treatment regimens with this exciting group of drugs for a condition whose etiology is still poorly understood.\n\nInflammatory fibroid polyp of sigmoid colon.\n\nPubMed\n\nLifschitz, O; Lew, S; Witz, M; Reiss, R; Griffel, B\n\n1979-01-01\n\nA case of inflammatory fibroid polyp of the sigmoid colon is presented.

Symptomatology of the inflamed fibroid polyp in this part of the gut closely simulates gastrointestinal malignancy. The treatment is surgical excision of the polyp, or colonoscopic resection when it is possible.

They are monoclonal tumors of the uterine smooth muscle, which spring from myometrium. It is estimated that they occur in 50-60% of the female population and rise to 70% by the age of 50. While mostly asymptomatic, myomas can be connected with several conditions, including abnormal bleeding with subsequent anemia, pelvic masses, pelvic pain, bulk symptoms, unfavorable impact on fertility and obstetric complications. Factors, which predispose the emergence of fibroids are: hormones, Afro-American ethnicity, age, obesity, adverse pregnancy outcome history, early menarche, genetic factors, alcohol, caffeine or eating too much red meat. On the other hand, there are factors, which can decrease this risk: pregnancy, early menopause and tobacco smoking. There are several mechanisms of fertility impairment in females with fibroids: alternations in uterus function (flawed blood supply, increased contractility), changes in the normal uterus anatomy, local hormonal changes induced by fibroids. In this review the connection between fibroids and infertility is analyzed.\n\nAyurvedic intervention in the management of uterine fibroids: A Case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nDhiman, Kamini\n\n2014-01-01\n\nUterine enlargement is common in reproductive life of a female.

The fibroid pseudocapsule is composed of a neurovascular network rich in neurofibers similar to the neurovascular bundle surrounding a prostate. The nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy has several intriguing parallels to myomectomy. It may serve either as a useful model in modern fibroid surgical removal, or it may accelerate our understanding of the role of the fibrovascular bundle and neurotransmitters in the healing and restoration of reproductive potential after intracapsular myomectomy. Surgical innovations, such as laparoscopic or robotic myomectomy applied to the intracapsular technique with magnification of the fibroid pseudocapsule surrounding a leiomyoma, originated from the radical prostatectomy method that highlighted a careful dissection of the neurovascular bundle to preserve sexual functioning after prostatectomy. Gentle uterine leiomyoma detachment from the pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle has allowed a reduction in uterine bleeding and uterine musculature trauma with sparing of the pseudocapsule neuropeptide fibers. This technique has had a favorable impact on functionality in reproduction and has improved fertility outcomes. Further research should determine the role of the myoma pseudocapsule neurovascular bundle in the formation, growth, and pathophysiological consequences of fibroids, including pain, infertility, and reproductive outcomes.

A retrospective review of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the uterus was performed to assess pre-embolization fibroid morphology. Data were collected on fibroid size, type, and number and included analysis of follow-up imaging to assess response. There have been 67 pregnancies in 51 women, with 40 live births. Intramural fibroids were seen in 62.7% of the women (32/48). Of these the fibroids were multiple in 16. A further 12 women hadmoreÂ Â» submucosal fibroids, with equal numbers of types 1 and 2. Two of these women had coexistent intramural fibroids. In six women the fibroids could not be individually delineated and formed a complex mass. All subtypes of fibroid were represented in those subgroups of women achieving a live birth versus those who did not. These results demonstrate that the location of uterine fibroids did not adversely affect subsequent pregnancy in the patient population investigated. Although this is only a small qualitative study, it does suggest that all types of fibroids treated with UAE have the potential for future fertility.Â«Â less\n\nMRI Assessment of Uterine Artery Patency and Fibroid Infarction Rates 6 Months after Uterine Artery Embolization with Nonspherical Polyvinyl Alcohol\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDas, Raj, E-mail: rajdas@nhs.net; Gonsalves, Michael; Vlahos, Ioannis\n\nPurpose: We have observed significant rates of uterine artery patency after uterine artery embolization (UAE) with nonspherical polyvinyl alcohol (nsPVA) on 6 month follow-up MR scanning. The study aim was to quantitatively assess uterine artery patency after UAE with nsPVA and to assess the effect of continued uterine artery patency on outcomes. Methods: A single centre, retrospective study of 50 patients undergoing bilateral UAE for uterine leiomyomata was undertaken. Pelvic MRI was performed before and 6 months after UAE. All embolizations were performed with nsPVA. Outcome measures included uterine artery patency, uterine and dominant fibroid volume, dominant fibroid percentage infarction,moreÂ Â» presence of ovarian arterial collaterals, and symptom scores assessed by the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life questionnaire (UFS-QOL). Results: Magnetic resonance angiographic evidence of uterine artery recanalization was demonstrated in 90 % of the patients (64 % bilateral, 26 % unilateral) at 6 months. Eighty percent of all dominant fibroids demonstrated >90 % infarction. The mean percentage reduction in dominant fibroid volume was 35 %. No significant difference was identified between nonpatent, unilateral, and bilateral recanalization of the uterine arteries with regard to percentage dominant fibroid infarction or dominant fibroid volume reduction. The presence of bilaterally or unilaterally patent uterine arteries was not associated with inferior clinical outcomes (symptom score or UFS-QOL scores) at 6 months. Conclusion: The high rates of uterine artery patency challenge the current paradigm that nsPVA is a permanent embolic agent and that permanent uterine artery occlusion is necessary to optimally treat uterine fibroids. Despite high rates of uterine artery recanalization in this cohort, satisfactory fibroid infarction rates and UFS-QOL scores were achieved.Â«Â less\n\nThe positive effect of targeted marketing on an existing uterine fibroid embolization practice.\n\nPubMed\n\nChrisman, Howard B; Basu, Pat Auveek; Omary, Reed A\n\n2006-03-01\n\nAlthough uterine fibroid embolization is an effective treatment option for symptomatic women, it is unclear what methods can be used to expand referrals in an already established practice. The authors tested the hypothesis that an advertising strategy focused on a defined target market can expand an existing uterine fibroid embolization practice. A market-driven planning sequence was employed. This included a determination of goals, an examination of current competition, determination of target market based on local environment and previous consumer use, pretest of product sample, and implementation of advertisement. Based on the analysis the authors determined that the target audience was professional black women aged 35 to 45. A specific weekly magazine was selected due to readership demographics. An advertisement was run for 8 consecutive weeks. The authors prospectively tracked patient inquiries, clinic visits, cases performed, and revenues generated for 3 months following the initial advertisement. All patients were seen in a fully staffed, preexisting fibroid clinic located within an urban, university-based academic practice performing 250 uterine fibroid embolizations annually. Ninety calls were received directly related to the advertisement. There were 35 clinic visits, which resulted in 17 uterine fibroid embolizations and 52 total MR imaging procedures. Eighteen patients were not considered candidates based on established protocols. The 17 extra cases performed over 3 months represented a 27% increase in case volume. Total professional cash collections for these cases (including MR imaging) were 58,317 US dollars. The cost of advertising was 8,000 US dollars. As a result of existing infrastructure, no additional costs were necessary. This resulted in a net revenue gain 50,317 US dollars and a nonannualized rate of return of approximately 625%.

Nine hundred couples with unexplained infertility who participated in the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) clinical trial. Participants were randomized to one of three arms (clomiphene citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropins), and treatment was continued for up to four cycles or until pregnancy was achieved. Conception (serum hCG increase), clinical pregnancy (fetal cardiac activity), and live birth rates. A total of 102/900 participants (11.3%) had at least one documented fibroid and a normal uterine cavity. Women with fibroids were older, more likely to be African American, had a greater uterine volume, lower serum antimÃ¼llerian hormone levels, and fewer antral follicles than women without fibroids. In conception cycles, clinical pregnancy rates were significantly lower in participants with fibroids than in those without uterine fibroids. Pregnancy loss before 12Â weeks was more likely in African American women with fibroids compared with non-African American women with fibroids. There was no difference in conception and live birth rates in subjects with and without fibroids. No differences were observed in conception and live birth rates in women with non-cavity-distorting fibroids and those without fibroids. These findings provide reassurance that pregnancy success is not impacted in couples with non-cavity-distorting fibroids undergoing OS-IUI for unexplained infertility. NCT01044862.

Although a number of international obstetrics/gynecology societies have issued evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of symptomatic uterine fibroids, many of these guidelines do not yet reflect the most recent clinical evidence and approved indication for one of the key medical management options: the selective progesterone receptor modulator class. This article aims to share the clinical experience gained with selective progesterone receptor modulators in Europe and Canada by reviewing the historical development of selective progesterone receptor modulators, current best practices for selective progesterone receptor modulator use based on available data, and potential future uses for selective progesterone receptor modulators in uterine fibroids and other gynecologic conditions.

None of these treatments is a panacea, and what is conspicuous is the lack of an effective long-term medical therapy for a disorder so common among women of reproductive age. It has been known for some time that progesterone and its receptors enhance proliferative activity in fibroids and this has raised the possibility that anti-progestins and (PRMs) could be useful in the medical management of fibroids. Some of the compounds which have produced promising results in recent clinical trials or research studies include mifepristone, CDB-4124 (telapristone), CP-8947, J-867 (asoprisnil) and CDB-2914 (ulipristal acetate or UA). UA has recently completed Phase III clinical trials with very encouraging results, and has now acquired a licence for clinical use in Europe. While considerable research has yet to be done on the long-term safety and efficacy of UA there is nevertheless good reason for optimism on the emergence of effective medical therapy in the form of UA and possibly other PRMs. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This retrospective cohort study evaluated all women with singleton gestations who had a routine second-trimester ultrasound at 17-23 weeks gestational age from 2010 to 2013. When fibroids were noted, their presence, number, location and size were recorded. Exclusion criteria included a history of cervical conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), uterine anomalies, maternal age greater than 40 years, and a previously placed cerclage. The primary variable of interest was short cervix (<25âmm). Secondary variables of interest included gestational age at delivery, mode of delivery, indication for cesarean, malpresentation, birth weight, and Apgar scores. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed. Fibroids were identified in 522/10 314 patients (5.1%). In the final multivariable logistic regression model, short cervix was increased in women with fibroids (OR 2.29, 95% CI: 1.40, 3.74). The number of fibroids did not affect the frequency of short cervix. Fibroids were significantly associated with preterm delivery (<37 weeks), primary cesarean, breech presentation, lower birth weight infants, and lower Apgar scores. Women with uterine fibroids may be at higher risk for a short cervix. Fibroids are also associated with several adverse obstetric and neonatal outcomes.\n\nUlipristal acetate versus placebo for fibroid treatment before surgery.\n\nPubMed\n\nDonnez, Jacques; Tatarchuk, Tetyana F; Bouchard, Philippe; Puscasiu, Lucian; Zakharenko, Nataliya F; Ivanova, Tatiana; Ugocsai, Gyula; Mara, Michal; Jilla, Manju P; Bestel, Elke; Terrill, Paul; Osterloh, Ian; Loumaye, Ernest\n\n2012-02-02\n\nThe efficacy and safety of oral ulipristal acetate for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids before surgery are uncertain. We randomly assigned women with symptomatic fibroids, excessive uterine bleeding (a score of >100 on the pictorial blood-loss assessment chart [PBAC, an objective assessment of blood loss, in which monthly scores range from 0 to >500, with higher numbers indicating more bleeding]) and anemia (hemoglobin level of â¤10.2 g per deciliter) to receive treatment for up to 13 weeks with oral ulipristal acetate at a dose of 5 mg per day (96 women) or 10 mg per day (98 women) or to receive placebo (48 women). All patients received iron supplementation. The coprimary efficacy end points were control of uterine bleeding (PBAC score of <75) and reduction of fibroid volume at week 13, after which patients could undergo surgery. At 13 weeks, uterine bleeding was controlled in 91% of the women receiving 5 mg of ulipristal acetate, 92% of those receiving 10 mg of ulipristal acetate, and 19% of those receiving placebo (P<0.001 for the comparison of each dose of ulipristal acetate with placebo). The rates of amenorrhea were 73%, 82%, and 6%, respectively, with amenorrhea occurring within 10 days in the majority of patients receiving ulipristal acetate. The median changes in total fibroid volume were -21%, -12%, and +3% (P=0.002 for the comparison of 5 mg of ulipristal acetate with placebo, and P=0.006 for the comparison of 10 mg of ulipristal acetate with placebo). Ulipristal acetate induced benign histologic endometrial changes that had resolved by 6 months after the end of therapy. Serious adverse events occurred in one patient during treatment with 10 mg of ulipristal acetate (uterine hemorrhage) and in one patient during receipt of placebo (fibroid protruding through the cervix). Headache and breast tenderness were the most common adverse events associated with ulipristal acetate but did not occur significantly more frequently than with placebo\n\nScaled signal intensity of uterine fibroids based on T2-weighted MR images: a potential objective method to determine the suitability for magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery of uterine fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Hyun; Yoon, Sang-Wook; Sokolov, Amit\n\n2015-12-01\n\nMagnetic Resonance-guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) is a non-invasive method to treat uterine fibroids. To help determine the patient suitability for MRgFUS, we propose a new objective measure: the scaled signal intensity (SSI) of uterine fibroids in T2 weighted MR images (T2WI). Forty three uterine fibroids in 40 premenopausal women were included in this retrospective study. SSI of each fibroid was measured from the screening T2WI by standardizing its mean signal intensity to a 0-100 scale, using reference intensities of rectus abdominis muscle (0) and subcutaneous fat (100). Correlation between the SSI and the non-perfused volume (NPV) ratio (a measure for treatment success) was calculated. Pre-treatment SSI showed a significant inverse-correlation with post treatment NPV ratio (pâ<â0.05). When dichotomizing NPV ratio at 45 %, the optimal cut off value of the SSI was found to be 16.0. A fibroid with SSI value 16.0 or less can be expected to have optimal responses. The SSI of uterine fibroids in T2WI can be suggested as an objective parameter to help in patient selection for MRgFUS. â¢ Signal intensity of fibroid in MR images predicts treatment response to MRgFUS. â¢ Signal intensity is standardized into scaled form using adjacent tissues as references. â¢ Fibroids with SSI less than 16.0 are expected to have optimal responses.\n\nThe role of angiogenic factors in fibroid pathogenesis: potential implications for future therapy\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTal, Reshef; Segars, James H.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground It is well established that tumors are dependent on angiogenesis for their growth and survival. Although uterine fibroids are known to be benign tumors with reduced vascularization, recent work demonstrates that the vasculature of fibroids is grossly and microscopically abnormal. Accumulating evidence suggests that angiogenic growth factor dysregulation may be implicated in these vascular and other features of fibroid pathophysiology. Methods Literature searches were performed in PubMed and Google Scholar for articles with content related to angiogenic growth factors and myometrium/leiomyoma. The findings are hereby reviewed and discussed. Results Multiple growth factors involved in angiogenesis are differentially expressed in leiomyoma compared with myometrium. These include epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding-EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-Î² and adrenomedullin. An important paradox is that although leiomyoma tissues are hypoxic, leiomyoma feature down-regulation of key molecular regulators of the hypoxia response. Furthermore, the hypoxic milieu of leiomyoma may contribute to fibroid development and growth. Notably, common treatments for fibroids such as GnRH agonists and uterine artery embolization (UAE) are shown to work at least partly via anti-angiogenic mechanisms. Conclusions Angiogenic growth factors play an important role in mechanisms of fibroid pathophysiology, including abnormal vasculature and fibroid growth and survival. Moreover, the fibroid's abnormal vasculature together with its aberrant hypoxic and angiogenic response may make it especially vulnerable to disruption of its vascular supply, a feature which could be exploited for treatment. Further experimental studies are required in order to gain a better understanding of the growth factors that are involved in normal and pathological myometrial angiogenesis, and to assess\n\nERÎ± inhibited myocardin-induced differentiation in uterine fibroids.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiao, Xing-Hua; Li, Jun-Yan; Dong, Xiu-Mei; Wang, Xiuhong; Xiang, Yuan; Li, Hui; Yu, Cheng-Xi; Li, Jia-Peng; Yuan, Bai-Yin; Zhou, Jun; Zhang, Tong-Cun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nUterine fibroids, also known as uterine leiomyomas, are a benign tumor of the human uterus and the commonest estrogen-dependent benign tumor found in women. Myocardin is an important transcriptional regulator in smooth and cardiac muscle development. The role of myocardin and its relationship with ERÎ± in uterine fibroids have barely been addressed. We noticed that the expression of myocardin was markedly reduced in human uterine fibroid tissue compared with corresponding normal or adjacent myometrium tissue. Here we reported that myocardin induced the transcription and expression of differentiation markers SM22Î± and alpha smooth muscle actin (Î±-SMA) in rat primary uterine smooth muscle cells (USMCs) and this effect was inhibited by ERÎ±. Notably, we showed that, ERÎ± induced expression of proliferation markers PCNA and ki-67 in rat primary USMCs. We also found ERÎ± interacted with myocardin and formed complex to bind to CArG box and inhibit the SM22Î± promoter activity. Furthermore, ERÎ± inhibited the transcription and expression of myocardin, and reduced the levels of transcription and expression of downstream target SM22Î±, a SMC differentiation marker. Our data thus provided important and novel insights into how ERÎ± and myocardin interact to control the cell differentiation and proliferation of USMCs. Thu"
