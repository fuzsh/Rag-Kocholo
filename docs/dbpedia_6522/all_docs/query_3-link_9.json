        "meta_description": "Abstract. This work presents a connection between the density variation\nwithin the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and changes in the\nintensity of solar radiation. On a seasonal timescale, these changes take\nplace due to the revolution of the Earth around the Sun. While the Earth,\nduring the northern-hemispheric (NH) winter, is closer to the Sun, the upper\nmesosphere expands due to an increased radiation intensity, which results in\nchanges in density at these heights. These density variations, i.e., a\nvertical redistribution of atmospheric mass, have an effect on the rotation\nrate of Earth's upper atmosphere owing to angular momentum conservation. In\norder to test this effect, we applied a theoretical model, which shows a\ndecrease in the atmospheric rotation speed of about\nâ¼4âmâsâ1 at a latitude of 45â\nin the case of a density change of 1â% between 70 and 100âkm. To support\nthis statement, we compare the wind variability obtained from meteor radar\n(MR) and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite observations with fluctuations in the length of a day\n(LOD). Changes in the LOD on timescales of a year and less are primarily\ndriven by tropospheric large-scale geophysical processes and their impact on\nthe Earth's rotation. A global increase in lower-atmospheric\neastward-directed winds leads, due to friction with the Earth's surface, to an\nacceleration of the Earth's rotation by up to a few milliseconds per\nrotation. The LOD shows an increase during northern winter and decreases\nduring summer, which corresponds to changes in the MLT density due to the\nEarthâSun movement. Within the MLT the mean zonal wind shows similar\nfluctuations to the LOD on annual scales as well as longer time series, which\nare connected to the seasonal wind regime as well as to density changes\nexcited by variations in the solar radiation. A direct correlation between\nthe local measured winds and the LOD on shorter timescales cannot clearly be\nidentified, due to stronger influences of other natural oscillations on the\nwind. Further, we show that, even after removing the seasonal and 11-year\nsolar cycle variations, the mean zonal wind and the LOD are connected by\nanalyzing long-term tendencies for the years 2005â2016.",

        "text": "According to the first Kepler law, the Earth travels in a good approximation on an elliptical trajectory around the Sun. Within a year the distance between both celestial bodies changes. During the northern-hemispheric (NH) winter the range is approximately 3.29â% shorter than in the NH summer. Due to the inverse square law, where the intensity I of the radiation is inversely proportional to the EarthâSun distance squared, this shorter distance between the Sun and the Earth during boreal winter leads to an increased heating of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) resulting in an expansion of the MLT and thermosphere, compared to the annual mean. Another effect on the expansionâshrinking of the MLT is given by the variability of solar radiation due to the 11-year solar cycle effect. FigureÂ 1 shows a scheme of the EarthâSun constellation and the resulting effects, which will be explained in the following. Previous studies such as Walterscheid (1989), Marsh etÂ al. (2007), Emmert (2015), and Lee etÂ al. (2018) showed that solar cycle variations affect the atmospheric density, temperature, chemical composition, and winds over the whole atmosphere, but in particular in the MTI (mesosphereâthermosphereâionosphere) system. A model simulation by Marsh etÂ al. (2007) showed responses to changes in the 11-year solar cycle for the whole atmosphere. For example, they showed that due to differences in the solar radiation between solar maximum and solar minimum temperature changes by over 100âK occur in the lower thermosphere. Further, they showed the occurrence of tropospheric wind and temperature changes due to changes in solar radiation. But they also mention that changes in the climatology due to solar radiation are too complex to be explained by simplified methods. Stober etÂ al. (2014) showed that a solar cycle effect between 2002 and 2013 led to changes in the neutral density within the MLT region by up to 2.5â%. Furthermore, satellite measurements showed on global scales a neutral density decrease by up to â¼30â% between solar maximum and solar minimum at about 400âkm (Emmert etÂ al.,Â 2010). For the 2009â2010 winter season, Stober etÂ al. (2012) showed a connection between the neutral density and the expansionâshrinking of the atmosphere by using meteor radar (MR) winds, lidar, and Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite temperature measurements. Further, they showed a strong anti-correlation of neutral air density and prevailing zonal winds. This indicates that an increase/decrease in the neutral density occurs almost simultaneously with a decrease/increase in zonal wind speed, respectively.\n\nChanges in the thickness of the atmosphere, resulting from differences in the distance between the Earth and Sun as well as from solar cycle effects, go along with changes in the Earth's rotation speed. Based on the conservation of angular momentum L, the angular velocity Ï for an altitude-defined atmospheric layerÂ a, with the thickness aoâai, can be estimated by\n\n(1) L = J Ï = 2 5 m a o 5 - a i 5 a o 3 - a i 3 Ï ,\n\nwhere J is the moment of inertia for a spherical shell, which rotates about an axis through the center; ai and ao are the inner and outer radius of the spherical shell; and m is the atmospheric mass. On this occasion the atmospheric mass is calculated according to Trenberth and Guillemot (1994) by\n\n(2) m = â« r 0 â â« 0 2 Ï â« - Ï / 2 Ï / 2 Ï r 2 cos Ï d Ï d Î» d r ,\n\nwhere Ï=Ï(Î»,Ï,r) is the density of air at longitude Î» and latitude Ï, and r is the distance from the Earth's center, while r=r0 at the surface of the Earth. In a good approximation the Earth's surface can be described as an ellipsoid r02=a2(1-2Î±sin2Ï) , where a is the equatorial radius, Î±=(a2-b2)/2a2 is related to the flattening, and b is the polar radius. With respect to the height above the surface z, this results in r2=(a+z)2(1-2Î±sin2Ï) and dr=(1-2Î±sin2Ï)12dz . Further, under the assumption that Ï=Ï1(r)Ï2(Î»,Ï) , the atmospheric mass can be derived by\n\nm=â«02Ïâ«-Ï/2Ï/2[â«0âÏ1(z)a+z2dz]Ï2(Î»,Ï)1-2Î±sin2Ï32(3)cosÏdÏdÎ».\n\nThe integral with respect to z and the relation to the measurements of the surface pressure ps can be estimated by solving\n\n(4) p s = â« 0 â Ï 1 ( z ) g ( z ) d r ,\n\nwhere g is the acceleration due to gravity. Considering that g is a function of height and latitude, the total atmospheric mass can be written in numerical terms as m=5.22371Ã1015pâ¾s , where m is given in kilograms and pâ¾s is given in hectopascal, for standard gravity at 45â latitude. More detailed information about the estimation of the total mass of the atmosphere can be found in Trenberth and Guillemot (1994). According to Trenberth and Smith (2004) the total mean mass of the atmosphere is 5.148Ã1018âkg and varies slightly on annual scales mainly due to the amount of available water vapor.\n\nA method to measure variations in the rotation speed of the solid Earth is estimating the time the Earth needs for a full rotation. In the following, we define the crust, mantle, and core of the Earth as solid Earth. To estimate the percentage of the atmospheric rotation velocity from the solid Earth rotation velocity, their rotation rate and their variations are necessary. The time the Earth needs for a full rotation is not constant. The rate of rotation and the orientation of the Earth's axis varies in time and space. Perturbations in the Earth's rotation rate are caused either by external forces, such as the influence of celestial bodies, or by internal torques, which are large-scale geophysical processes (Brzezinski etÂ al.,Â 2001). These internal torques are a combination of relative movements and mass reallocation of Earth's core, mantle, crust, oceans tides, and the atmosphere. Geographical differences in wind pattern and oceans cause shifts in the air and in the water masses. Earthquakes displacing the Earth's mantle might also influence the Earth's rotation on longer timescales (Carter and Robertson,Â 1986).\n\nOn timescales less than a year the dominant geophysical process to influence the duration of the Earth's rotation is the atmosphere (Volland,Â 1988). Every large-scale momentum exchange in the Earth's atmosphere on the Earth's surface increases or decreases the Earth's surface rotation, due to the law of conservation of total angular momentum within its system. The total angular momentum of the Earth's atmosphere M can be approximately written as\n\n(5) M = â« v Ï apc L apc d V = â« v Ï apc r Ã ( u rel + Ï Ã r ) d V ,\n\nwhere Lapc is the angular momentum of an air parcel of unit mass, Ïapc the density of the air parcel, urel the relative velocity, and ÏÃr the velocity due to the rotation of the Earth (Madden and Speth,Â 1995).\n\nThe total angular momentum and the velocities can be split into two parts. The mass part MÏ represents the value the angular momentum would take if the atmosphere were vertically and horizontally stationary relative to the ground, and the relative part Mr describes the part of the atmosphere angular momentum that is due to the motion of the atmosphere relative to the Earth's rotation. Following Madden and Speth (1995), Egger etÂ al. (2007), and Driscoll (2010) these parts of angular momentum can be written as\n\nM=MÏ+Mr=r4Ïgâ«02Ïâ«-Ï/2Ï/2psfccos3Î¸dÎ¸dÎ»(6)+r3gâ«01000â«02Ïâ«-Ï/2Ï/2urelcos2Î¸dÎ¸dÎ»dp.\n\nThus, changes in the atmospheric angular momentum depend on the sum of different torques dM/dt=TF+TM+ âothers. Here TF is the friction torque, TM is the mountain torque, and others torques include, for example, the gravity wave torque, which is small compared to the other two mentioned. The friction torque is exerted on the Earth's surface mainly due to frictional forces between the wind and the surface. If eastward-directed surface winds are prevailing on a global scale, this torque leads to an increase in the rotation rate due to a transfer of angular momentum from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface. The mountain torque is based on the surface pressure and orography, and it is the torque which is exerted on the Earth's surface due to a difference in pressure on two sides of a mountain. Both torques vary according to their global location and reach values in the range of 1019âNm (Driscoll,Â 2010; Egger etÂ al.,Â 2007; deÂ Viron and Dickey,Â 2014). The dominant exchange of the angular momentum between the atmosphere and Earth takes place in the atmospheric boundary layer, which, depending on the orography and latitude, has a typical thickness of about 1âkm at midlatitudes (Volland,Â 1988).\n\nAlready in the 1960s and 1970s scientists showed that fluctuations in the orientation of the Earth's rotation axis, on seasonal timescales, are associated with changes in the eastâwest tropospheric wind on a global scale and therefore accompanied with a transfer of angular momentum between the Earth's crust and the atmosphere (Lambeck,Â 1978; Munk and MacDonald,Â 1961). Changes in the speed of the Earth's rotation axis can be seen in fluctuations in the duration around a day. These fluctuations have been measured since the 1960s using the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) technique. The fluctuation in the day length is the difference between the astronomically determined duration of a full day 2ÏâD and the standard 86â400âs, whereby D is the angular velocity (Aoki etÂ al.,Â 1981). Henceforth, we use the acronym LOD for the fluctuations in the length of day. The LOD can be written as\n\n(7) LOD ( t ) = 2 Ï D - 86 400 s .\n\nWithin the estimation of the LOD the sidereal time gets converted into solar time, by taking into account the Earth's position, nutation, precession, and motion with respect to the stars. Detailed information about the transformation from sidereal time into solar time can be found in Aoki etÂ al. (1981); Schnell (2006).\n\nCarter and Robertson (1986) studied the influence of geophysical processes of the atmosphere on the duration of a day. They showed that, when the globally averaged mean winds from east to west increase, the rotation rate of the Earth decreases and the day gets longer. Rosen and Salstein (1991) showed that the effect of the wind on the LOD decreases with heights, by showing that winds in the atmospheric layer between 1000 and 10âhPa contribute 0.5âms, winds from 10 to 1âhPa contribute 0.03âms, and winds above 1 hPa contribute less than 4âÂµs to the interannual LOD budget. The impact of large-scale geophysical processes like El NiÃ±o (Dickey etÂ al.,Â 1994) and the stratospheric quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) can also be seen in the LOD (e.g., Eubanks etÂ al.,Â 1988; Volland,Â 1988).\n\nOn short timescales a change in the Earth rotation can lead to an uneven heating of the Earth's surface, which results in temperature differences between the surface and the atmosphere above. This can further cause convection currents, which leads to pressure differences in the atmosphere and results in a different wind formation, which can influence the day length. The influence of the solar radiation is stronger for higher altitudes and also for longer time series. An increase in the solar radiation, which can be caused due to a slowing of the Earth's rotation, leads to an expansion of the higher atmosphere, which further results, due to the conversion of angular momentum, in a slower rotation of the atmosphere. What further needs to be considered is, for example, the influence of volcanic eruptions, which influence the Earth's rotation as well as the atmospheric chemistry and temperature (She etÂ al.,Â 2015). Changes in these parameters can further lead to changes in the neutral density.\n\nWithin this study, we focus on heights between 60 and 100âkm. These heights are sensitive enough to density changes due to the changes in the intensity of solar radiation. After we describe the data we used in this study in Sect.Â 2, we show results and discuss the theoretical change in the rotation speed due to an expandingâshrinking atmosphere in Sect.Â 3. We will show that due to the expansionâshrinking effect, even under the assumption of equal density distribution between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere (SH), differences in the prevailing wind occur. Furthermore, we will show a connection between the LOD and the prevailing wind by showing correlations in the MLT region by using MR and MLS data for one polar and two midlatitude locations. We use the LOD data to show how deep the influence of solar radiation penetrates into the atmosphere. The conclusions are found in Sect.Â 4.\n\n3.1 LOD and neutral air density at the MLT\n\nFigureÂ 2 shows composites of zonal winds from MR measurements at Andenes, Juliusruh, Collm, and Davis. These data are estimated by using a mean wind adaptive spectral filter (Stober etÂ al.,Â 2017). It uses a 1-day sliding window, which mainly removes the impact of short-term variations, such as atmospheric tides and gravity waves. All three NH stations show almost similar wind patterns, with typical mesospheric eastward-directed winds during the winter, with mean values of up to 10âmâsâ1, and a wind reversal during spring. The spring wind reversal occurs earlier at midlatitudes than at polar latitudes. During the summer considerable vertical wind shear is present with westward-directed winds below 90âkm for Andenes, below 88âkm for Juliusruh, and below 85âkm for Collm. Above these heights a strong eastward jet occurs. The westward and the eastward jets reach wind values of up to 40âmâsâ1 at all three locations. These annual wind climatologies are consistent with previous studies, e.g., Manson etÂ al. (2004), Hoffmann etÂ al. (2010), and Jacobi (2012). Compared to Andenes a nearly opposite wind pattern can be seen for Davis. A dominant eastward-directed wind occurs between March and September for the complete observation range. Between September and March a vertical wind shear occurs, which reaches heights above 100âkm around October. Compared to the NH stations the summer vertical wind shear remains mainly below 90âkm.\n\nBesides the radar data, we additionally use MLS data within this study to extend the vertical coverage down to 60âkm. In Fig.Â 3 the zonal wind is shown for the high-latitude location of Andenes, for middle latitudes at Collm, and for the southern latitude location Davis. The altitude ranges between â¼60 and â¼90âkm geopotential height. A comparison of the MLS composite winds with MR composite winds results in a qualitatively good agreement for the seasonal amplitudes and phases. Both NH locations show eastward-directed winds between September and April for nearly all altitudes, with values of up to 40âmâsâ1 for the high-latitude area and up to 60âmâsâ1 for the midlatitudes. During summer westward-directed wind dominates below 95âkm and reaches values of up to 30âmâsâ1 for the high latitudes. For the middle latitude, below 90âkm, the wind reaches values of up to 50âmâsâ1. A similar pattern of an eastward-directed wind occurs in both cases during summer above 90âkm geometric height. The SH location also shows a similar wind pattern to the observed MR data. In the following discussion we will focus on the MLS altitude range 60â80âkm and use the MR data for the altitudes between 80 and 100âkm.\n\nAccording to previous studies such as Emmert etÂ al. (2004) and Stober etÂ al. (2012), a connection exists between the thickness of an atmospheric layer and the density fluctuation within that layer. Stober etÂ al. (2012) explained the occurrence of this connection by showing variations in the neutral density, based on MLS and MR observations, together with changes in the MLT geometric height. Furthermore they showed a strong anti-correlation between the simultaneous occurrence of the zonal wind and the density change within the mesosphere.\n\nTo underline this statement, we show in the following part the connection between the expanding MLT and the atmospheric rotation speed. FigureÂ 4 shows, as an example, the theoretical variation in the atmospheric rotation velocity with height due to a density increase up to 1â% between 70 and 100âkm. The calculation is done in 2âkm height layers and for the latitude of 45â. Different latitudes lead to slightly different values of g, which is used in Eq.Â (4). The density increase takes place for longer timescales during a solar maximum (Emmert etÂ al.,Â 2010) and on annual timescales during the winter, when the EarthâSun distance is smaller. Both cases influence the temperature within this atmospheric layer as well as their expansion compared to the annual mean. Overall the density variation during an 11-year solar cycle is stronger than the variation caused by the changes in the EarthâSun distance. According to Eqs.Â (1)â(4), we estimated for three different cases (linear, red; exponential, green; and a Gaussian-shaped, blue, density increase) the resulting theoretical change in the rotation speed within these heights, with the solid Earth rotation speed (black) as background flow. Based on the conserved quantity of the angular momentum within a narrow atmospheric layer (2âkm vertical) this sums up, according to each case, to a decrease in the rotation speed by up to â¼2â4âmâsâ1, with the strongest variation within the Gaussian-shaped curve. These results fit to the observations by Stober etÂ al. (2012) and show the dependence of the rotation speed within an atmospheric layer due to changes in the neutral density. However, we are not able to extract a specific wind value only based on wind measurements.\n\nBased on ERA40 data, Trenberth and Smith (2004) showed that the global mean of the surface pressure is nearly constant, and surface pressure anomalies at the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere are nearly identical, but the fluctuations are opposite in sign. These anomalies are mainly due to the changing amount of available water vapor in the atmosphere. Under the assumption of opposite surface pressure anomalies within both hemispheres and therefore by neglecting other factors such as different gravity wave forcing between the hemispheres, we assume, on annual scales, similar pressure values within the MLT region. Therefore the prevailing wind within the MLT region should be similar in magnitude between Andenes and Davis, which are located at the same latitude in the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. To underline the influence of the intensity of the solar radiation on the density and also on the amplitude of the zonal wind, we compare the evolution of the seasonal mean wind measurements from the NH station Andenes (69.3ââN) and SH station Davis (68.3ââS). FigureÂ 5 shows, for both stations, the winter and summer mean wind for the altitudes at 88 and 96âkm. The northern winter includes the mean of the months of December, January, and February and the southern winter the months June, July, and August. The northern winter period comes along with the perihelion, which is the point where the Earth comes nearest to the Sun. At the perihelion, the intensity of the solar radiation on the upper atmosphere is stronger during the aphelion. While during the winter season the wind values are higher over Davis for both altitudes, they are higher over Andenes during the summer season, especially at 96âkm, with values of up to 10â20âmâsâ1. Both seasonal wind differences are consistent with the change in the average density within the upper mesosphere, resulting from the different distance between the Earth and Sun and leading to the variation of the averaged zonal wind, as shown in Stober etÂ al. (2012). We have to note that others factors exists, which are more dominant for the wind differences between both locations at theses altitudes. Other physical processes also have a strong effect on the hemispheric wind differences, e.g., the topography, chemical composition of the atmosphere (Lee etÂ al.,Â 2018; Marsh etÂ al.,Â 2007), and the occurrence and propagation of gravity waves. These waves are the main drivers of the atmospheric wind circulation and therefore also influence the local wind differences at both hemispheres. Furthermore, gravity waves lead, compared to the annual mean, to a colder summer mesosphere and a warmer winter mesosphere (LÃ¼bken etÂ al.,Â 2014). These temperature differences also fit well to the atmospheric expansionâshrinking. Unfortunately, we are not able to estimate a precise value on how strong the connection is between mean zonal wind and the LOD based only on wind measurements. For a more detailed understanding of these phenomena global density observations would be required.\n\n3.2 Correlation of mean winds and LOD\n\nIn the following we want to show that the LOD (fluctuations in the length of a day) correlates with the prevailing wind from the four stations. If the Earth's rotation is constant the LOD should be zero; however, small wobbles of the Earth's rotation between the days cause tiny fluctuations in the day length. These have to be compensated for by a momentum transfer between the different parts of the Earth including the atmosphere. As the atmosphere is slaved to the Earth crust, because the atmospheric momentum and mass are much smaller than that of the Earth core, the atmosphere has to respond to changes in the rotation velocity. So far we use the LOD explicitly as reference for the changes in the rotation speed, which can be seen in the zonal wind, as well as to verify up to which height the solar-driven density effect is dominant. Therefore, Figs.Â 6 and 7 show wind values for Andenes, Collm, and Davis at different altitudes and the LOD by using the same filtering method as done for the winds. Two different altitudes in the MLT are considered from the MR winds for all locations: (1)Â 80âkm, where within a year a change between eastward- and westward-directed wind occurs; and (2)Â 96âkm, which is the altitude where the wind, during each hemispheric summer, shows the opposite direction compared to at 80âkm (see Fig.Â 2). Positive wind values correspond to eastward-directed winds and positive LOD values correspond to a longer duration of the day. If not explicitly mentioned, the results of the two midlatitude stations are nearly identical. Therefore we only show the results for the location around Collm.\n\nAt 80âkm (Fig.Â 6) the oscillation pattern of the smoothed zonal wind (blue) and the smoothed LOD (black) are similar for Andenes. According to previous studies the LOD consists of superpositions of several periods, such as 0.5Â years, 1Â year (VondrÃ¡k and BurÅ¡a,Â 1977), 2â3Â years (Buffet,Â 1996), 5.9Â years (AbracaÂ del Rio etÂ al.,Â 1999), and others (e.g., Holme and deÂ Viron,Â 2013; Munk and MacDonald,Â 1961). According to AbarcaÂ del Rio etÂ al. (2003) an accurate estimation of the impact of the solar radiation is quite complicated, due to the fact that internal oscillations in the climate system show variations with the same frequency as the 11-year solar cycle. Further, Gray etÂ al. (2010) support this statement and mention that the problem is further complicated due to the small influence of the solar forcing on the climate. Nevertheless, Chapanov and Gambis (2008) showed that, based on a decomposition of the LOD, the solar activity (10.47Â years) is included. Also the zonal wind includes a superposition of several periods such as the solar cycle, diurnal and semidiurnal tides, and more (e.g., Emmert etÂ al.,Â 2010; Hoffmann etÂ al.,Â 2010). Therefore, we additionally show with the red line a smoothed zonal wind after removing variations due to the 11-year solar cycle. The influence of the solar cycle on the daily zonal wind is relatively small; therefore the smoothness of the red line is enhanced for better visualization. Changes in the LOD are sluggish compared to variations in the wind, due to the amount of momentum which is needed to influence the Earth's rotation speed. According to Dickey etÂ al. (1994), a direct effect between the stratospheric and tropospheric zonal wind and the day length exists on annual timescales due to long-term geophysical effects, such as QBO and El NiÃ±o. They found that the stratosphere cannot be neglected in the Earth's angular momentum. Around 20â% of the LOD relative to the atmosphere below 100âhPa belongs to the impact of the stratosphere. Furthermore, they mentioned a small lag (10â20Â days) between the LOD and variations in the angular momentum, but the lag does not appear to be statistically significant. Therefore only comparisons on seasonal and longer timescales are useful to consider. All parameters which are displayed in Fig.Â 6 show a seasonal pattern. First we describe the results for the NH stations. For the NH the zonal wind and the LOD show decreasing values during summer and increasing values during winter. Beside the striking seasonality, short time fluctuations within a year are observable during the winter in the zonal wind for some years. During the winter of 2010 and 2011, and on even shorter timescales such as a few months during the winter 2006, 2014, and 2015, decreases in the LOD together with decreases in the zonal wind are visible. The LOD varies between â1 and 4âms. The LOD oscillation shows seasonal variations of a fluctuation with shorter day lengths during NH summer and longer day lengths during winter, which fits to the density increase and decrease in the MLT as described above. For the midlatitude station the oscillation patterns in the LOD and the wind are qualitatively similar, but shifted in time. The wind peaks occur earlier in the year than the LOD peaks, which goes along with the earlier wind transition at midlatitudes that can be seen in Fig.Â 2. For Davis a time shift of approximately 6Â months occurs between the zonal wind and the LOD, due to the opposite seasonal wind pattern.\n\nIn the summer wind transition altitude, a time shift occurs between both parameters. The altitude of the wind transition in these cases is defined as the height between the above-located eastward and the below-located westward wind during summer. At these heights the wind and the LOD are almost uncorrelated. Above the summer wind transition altitude the oscillation patterns between the LOD and the winds are quite opposite to those for 80âkm altitude, with a 180â shift between both parameters, which can be seen in Fig.Â 7. The phase shift, which is pronounced during the summer, obviously results from the opposite wind regime compared to the 80âkm altitude. Nevertheless, above the transition height, changes in the density, due to the intensity of the solar radiation, are more pronounced than at lower heights. Therefore the existing seasonal wind pattern fits well to the atmospheric density increase and decrease at these layers.\n\nAdditionally, we show in TableÂ 1 correlation coefficients for the four locations for the altitudes between 80 and 98âkm. Positive correlation values correspond to the occurrence of an eastward-directed wind together with an increased LOD. The values of the NH follow a similar pattern, with positive coefficients below the vertical transition height and negative ones above. Davis shows a different pattern, with overall negative correlation coefficients. This is owing to the opposite zonal wind pattern compared to the NH. Theoretically, a time shift of â¼6Â months would lead to a similar correlation pattern to that in the NH.\n\nFigureÂ 8 shows the mean zonal wind at â¼80âkm geometric height, based on MLS data, and the LOD. These mean zonal winds include wind values within the longitude grid between 0 and 20ââE, which is comparable to the NH stations. The figureÂ is divided in 10â latitude steps centered at latitudes from 80 to 10ââS/N. Each latitude grid includes values for Â±6â . For the MLS observations the comparisons between the wind and the LOD are similar to the 80âkm meteor results at the respective latitudes. Furthermore, the occurrence of a time shift of 6Â months between both polar hemispheres can be seen. A 180â phase shift would lead to the windâLOD pattern of the opposite hemisphere. Furthermore, the strongest correlation between both parameters can be seen at northern polar latitudes. Due to an increase in the difference between the geometric and geopotential heights, we do not show comparisons for higher altitudes. We added correlation coefficients (black) between the mean zonal wind and the LOD for each latitude. A correlation increase towards the northern high latitudes is visible. The same would be seen if a 180â phase shift is added to the time series. Additionally, we present global correlations (green) by averaging mean zonal wind data over all longitudes, whereby possible stationary planetary waves are filtered. The global correlation coefficients are nearly similar to the values for previous average winds between 0 and 20ââE. The shape of the curves between the global average winds is also nearly equal; therefore we did not add them in the figure.\n\nIn Figs.Â 9 and 10, long-term changes in annual LOD (black) and annual mean zonal winds (red) are shown for Collm and for Davis. At this point, we have to mention that the tendency over a long time series is not linear in time. Parameters which influence the tendency of the wind and the LOD also vary over time. Such changes are often approximated by a piecewise linear trend model (e.g., Jacobi etÂ al.,Â 2011; Merzlyakov etÂ al.,Â 2009; TomÃ© and Miranda,Â 2004), where different linear fit tendencies are estimated for different time periods. Nevertheless, due to the length of the available data series we decided not to use a piecewise linear trend model. The wind values exclude seasonal and solar cycle variations and the LOD excludes the seasonal variations. As an example for the location of Collm (Fig.Â 9), the altitudes between 80 and 96âkm are displayed. The error bars correspond to the annual variance for each height and the dotted lines show the long-term tendency for each parameter. FigureÂ 9 shows that a long-term increase in the LOD occurs together with a long-term decrease in the zonal wind. Above 94âkm the tendency reverses into a slightly positive wind. This reversal can be explained by the stronger influence due to gravity wave filtering, which has to be considered and cannot be excluded by filtering the data. The tendencies of an increased value for the LOD and a decreased value for the mean zonal wind can be seen for all midlatitude locations and also for Davis (see Fig.Â 10). Andenes shows for all altitudes an increased tendency in the zonal wind (not shown). The results indicate that the connection between the LOD and the wind is more pronounced at lower latitudes and is simply explainable by the rotation velocity, which is higher at the middle latitude stations than at the polar latitudes like at Andenes and Davis. The results of an increase in the LOD and a decrease in zonal wind agree with the relation between fluctuations in the neutral density and the zonal wind, as shown in Stober etÂ al. (2012).\n\nAbarcaÂ del Rio, R., Gambis, D., Salstein, D., Nelson, P., and Dai, A.: Solar activity and earth rotation variability, J.
