        "text": "Upgraded to business class and it was worth every dollar! The connection in Denver was way too tight time wise and going through customs there plus re-visiting security screen again caused me to miss my connecting flight. KAYAK should not allow that tight of connection on international flights.\n\nIt was excellent. I upgraded from premium economy to business and it was totally worth it. We were on a 747 and I sat upstairs and enjoyed the privacy. The crew was incredible especially the woman who had been working with you all for 30 years.she was absolutely spectacular as was her cabin. The food was delicious. I would just serve bread with the meal. Don’t take it away!\n\nI traveled with my sister, however ,we booked a flight separately, and we don't sitting next to each other. The staff on the board where on the top of this unit they find us sitting together. Ty lufthansa team. U are the best\n\nOther than the delay of flight, this crew tried to make the best of bad situation.\n\nDelay before takeoff, ran out of protein options for the meal served, waited on the tarmac upon landing for and hour, waited in corridor for people mover for 45 minutes and still waited at baggage claim for over 30 minutes. This was after Lufthansa cancelled our flight to Frankfurt. Will definitely be my last option when booking overseas flights.\n\nMy seat was upgraded to premium economy, food was good and cabin crew was nice.\n\nTerrible. Super uncomfortable/less room than a domestic flight and flight was 9.5 hours. Food was terrible. Flight attendants slammed the cart into 2 people in our party numerous times as they were both over 6' tall and sitting in the aisle.\n\nNot helpful crew! With no care for passengers. No effort made to find the right food.\n\nTwo things to note here. First, Lufthansa separated me from my small children. Apparently you need to pay extra to ensure that your children are not abandoned. This is different from KLM-Air France, where children sit with their parents automatically, and I usually fly KLM-Air France. I didn't realize Lufthansa was different on this score and is willing to leverage the wellbeing of small children to generate more revenue. Second, my flight arrived 3 hours and 54 minutes late, so I am entitled to financial compensation as per EU passenger rights regulation. From other aspects of Lufthansa's behavior during this trip, I expect that their approach to this is to start a war of attrition with their passengers to avoid giving compensation as much as possible - again, very differently from KLM-Air France. But we'll see, maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe wi-fi wasn’t working on the flight from Munich to Chicago and I’d already paid for two devices before they notified us not to purchase it. I think that should have been mentioned as we checked in or boarded not once we were already on board during the safety brief. The flight attendant stated that we’d get a voucher, but we didn’t receive anything while on the flight, so I don’t know who’s responsible for issuing a voucher or refund."
