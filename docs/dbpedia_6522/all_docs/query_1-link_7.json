Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy at Leipzig-Halle Airport is essentially constant during April, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 25, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 3% of the time, while on October 11, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed at Leipzig-Halle Airport is decreasing during April, decreasing from 10.0 miles per hour to 8.7 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 11.9 miles per hour, while on August 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction at Leipzig-Halle Airport throughout April is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 41% on April 1.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season at Leipzig-Halle Airport typically lasts for 6.5 months (200 days), from around April 12 to around October 29, rarely starting before March 22 or after April 30, and rarely ending before October 9 or after November 23.\n\nDuring April at Leipzig-Halle Airport, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is very rapidly increasing rising from 25% to 90% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in April at Leipzig-Halle Airport\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days at Leipzig-Halle Airport are gradually increasing during April, increasing by 96Â°F, from 32Â°F to 128Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy at Leipzig-Halle Airport is rapidly increasing during April, rising by 1.5 kWh, from 3.9 kWh to 5.4 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Leipzig-Halle Airport are 51.421 deg latitude, 12.222 deg longitude, and 436 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Leipzig-Halle Airport contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 154 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 414 feet. Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (394 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,539 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Leipzig-Halle Airport is covered by artificial surfaces (55%) and cropland (45%), within 10 miles by cropland (66%) and artificial surfaces (25%), and within 50 miles by cropland (66%) and trees (19%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather at Leipzig-Halle Airport, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nLeipzig-Halle Airport has a weather station that reported reliably enough during the analysis period that we have included it in our network. When available, historical temperature and dew point measurements are taken directly from this weather station. These records are obtained from NOAA's Integrated Surface Hourly data set, falling back on ICAO METAR records as required.\n\nIn the case of missing or erroneous measurements from this station, we fall back on records from nearby stations, adjusted according to typical seasonal and diurnal intra-station differences. For a given day of the year and hour of the day, the fallback station is selected to minimize the prediction error over the years for which there are measurements for both stations.\n\nThe stations on which we may fall back include but are not limited to Magdeburg, Sachsen-Anhalt; Holzdorf; HofâPlauen Airport; ErfurtâWeimar Airport; Karlovy Vary Airport; Berlin Tegel Airport; Dresden Airport; and Berlin Tempelhof Airport.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
