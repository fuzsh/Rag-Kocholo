        "text": "While you certainly can’t see everything in Berlin in 3 days, I think this is a good amount of time to see the highlights and get a feel for the city. I’ve lived in Berlin since 2015, so I know the city well. I’ve put together this 3 day Berlin itinerary to help you make the most of your time and see the best of what Berlin has to offer.\n\nWhen people ask me how many days you need to see Berlin, I think 3 days is the minimum, though you can still enjoy the city if you have less time. With 3 days in Berlin, you can experience some of the best things to do in Berlin, eat some delicious food, and enjoy the offbeat vibe of the city.\n\nHere’s my suggested Berlin itinerary for 3 days.\n\nDay by day itinerary for Berlin in 3 days\n\nFor this itinerary, I’m assuming you have a full 3 days in Berlin. This means you should arrive the night before and leave the morning after, spending 4 nights and 3 days in Berlin. Or if you only have 3 nights, schedule a late flight or train on the last day. There’s a lot to see and do in Berlin, so you need to get up early to explore.\n\nI did my best to group attractions and activities based on where they’re located, that way you aren’t running around to different ends of the city in one day. This will save you time on transport and help you see as much as possible.\n\nHowever, some of the top sights in Berlin simply are spread out, so I recommend getting a day pass for public transport each day that you’re here. For 3 days in Berlin, I suggest getting one 24 hour ticket for each day.\n\nThis itinerary includes some of the iconic sights as well as some lesser known attractions in Berlin. If you’re wondering what to do in Berlin in 3 days, this itinerary has more than enough activities and sights to give you a feel for the city.\n\nWhenever possible, I highly recommend booking tickets ahead of time. This will save you time, especially if the ticket comes with a skip-the-line option. Losing an hour of your vacation standing and waiting in line is no fun.\n\nIt’s also important to decide when is the best time to visit Berlin based on your preferences for weather, crowds, and more.\n\nAnd make sure you know how to get from the Berlin airport to the city center before you arrive.\n\nLet’s get started on how to discover Berlin in 3 days.\n\nShort on time? Check out our itinerary for one day in Berlin or our 2 day Berlin itinerary.\n\nPlaces to visit in Berlin in 3 days\n\nBerlin has enough amazing landmarks and activities to keep you busy for weeks. I’m still discovering new-to-me places in Berlin even after years of living here.\n\nBut there are certain places to visit in Berlin that every first time visitor should see. If you think you’d like to see some of the major attractions quickly before diving in, a Berlin hop on hop off bus could be a good option.\n\nBerlin is loaded with interesting history, and it’s also one of the hippest and quirkiest cities in Europe. People visit Berlin to learn about the city’s dark past as well as experience its unique modern vibe and taste a variety of international cuisines.\n\nThere’s a lot to take in if you only have a short amount of time here. Here’s our suggestions for attractions and sights to see in three days in Berlin.\n\nTV Tower\n\nOne of the most famous sights in Berlin, the TV Tower is hard to miss. Standing at 368 meters (1,207 feet) tall, it is one of the tallest structures in Germany and the European Union.\n\nThe Soviets inaugurated the Berlin TV Tower on October 3, 1969, and it was intentionally built to be seen from almost anywhere in Berlin. This holds true today, and you’ll see it pop out unexpectedly when you round a corner.\n\nThe original intent of the Soviets was for the TV Tower to represent the strength of communist East Germany. But today it symbolizes the reunification of Germany and is a symbol of Berlin itself.\n\nThe Berlin TV Tower, or Fernsehturm in German, is a great place for views of Berlin since it’s so tall. The elevator takes you to the viewing platform at about 200 meters high for fantastic 360 degree views of the city.\n\nThere’s also a revolving restaurant on a different level where you can enjoy the views while eating a nice meal.\n\nIf you’re only in Berlin for three days, buy priority tickets online ahead of time to reduce your wait. Waiting to buy your ticket at the door could mean standing around for an hour or more.\n\nBrandenburg Gate\n\nBuilt in the late 1700s, Brandenburg Gate, or Brandenburger Tor in German, is Berlin’s last standing city gate.\n\nWhen Berlin was split into East and West during the Cold War, the border between the two sides ran just to the west of Brandenburg Gate. The gate was in the East and because of how the Wall was built, it was inaccessible to both sides and came to represent the separation of the two sides of Berlin and Germany.\n\nPresident Reagan gave his famous “Tear down this wall!” speech while standing in West Berlin near the gate. This strategic location meant people in East Berlin could hear his powerful speech.\n\nToday Brandenburg Gate represents unity. It is one of the most famous landmarks in Berlin, and even in all of Germany.\n\nMuseum Island\n\nMuseum Island is the name of a complex of five museums loaded with history and culture. It’s one of Berlin’s 3 UNESCO Sites, and it includes the Altes Museum (Old Museum), the Neues Museum (New Museum), the Alta Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery), the Bode Museum, and the Pergamon Museum.\n\nYou could easily spend hours in just one of these museums, so if this is a priority to you, you might have to cut out a few other things in this Berlin itinerary. Otherwise, admiring the architecture of these impressive buildings is still worthwhile.\n\nImportant info\n\nOpening hours: Tuesday through Sunday 10am to 6pm, closed Mondays. Holiday hours may differ.\n\nClosest transport is the Museumsinsel Ubahn station where you can get the U5.\n\nBerlin Cathedral\n\nLocated on Museum Island just steps away from the museums, the Berlin Cathedral, or Berliner Dom in German, is a gorgeous Protestant cathedral that should definitely be on your Berlin bucket list.\n\nThe cathedral dates back to the 15th century, though it has been rebuilt and restored several times throughout its history. It was in the East during the Cold War, and although there was some restoration work, the cathedral was not fully restored until a few years after the Wall fell.\n\nTours are available (not during religious services) and included with the admission fee if you are interested in hearing about the history of the cathedral. You can also climb 270 stairs for lovely panoramic views of Berlin.\n\nWith 3 days in Berlin, you probably have time to take the tour and go to the top. At the very least, you should at least stop by to admire the outside.\n\nReichstag Building\n\nOpened in 1894, the Reichstag Building is a unique building with a glass dome top, and it’s the seat of the German government. One of the most popular free things to do in Berlin is to take the free tour of the Reichstag Building.\n\nThe free tour of the Reichstag includes an audio guide that tells you about the history of the building and the German government, as well as other interesting information about Germany. You’ll get some nice views of the city from the glass dome, too.\n\nImportant info\n\nPlan ahead because advanced booking is required and opening hours vary.\n\nClosest transport: About halfway between the Bundestag Ubahn station (U5) and the Brandenburger Tor Sbahn and Ubahn station (S1, S2, S25, S26, U5).\n\nTiergarten\n\nTiergarten is one of the most popular parks in Berlin, and even though it’s located right in the middle of the city, it’s huge. It dates back to 1527 when it was a royal hunting ground, but today this vast green space is a much loved public park for Berliners.\n\nThroughout the park you’ll see statues, memorials, ponds, tree-lined thoroughfares, and lawns. When the weather’s warm in Berlin, people come here for leisurely walks, picnics, and generally hanging out with friends.\n\nThe park is located just west of Brandenburg Gate, so it’s easy to include a quick stroll in Tiergarten on your three day Berlin itinerary.\n\nImportant info\n\nThe park is open 24 hours a day.\n\nIt’s a large park, so there are multiple transport options depending on what part of the park you want to reach. The section closest to Brandenburg Gate is easiest to access from the Brandenburger Tor S&U station where you can get the S1, S2, S25, S26, or U5.\n\nVictory Column\n\nBerlin’s Victory Column, or Siegessäule in German, is one of the more recognizable monuments in the city, and one you should see while spending 3 days in Berlin.\n\nThe Victory Column was constructed as a monument to Prussia’s victory in the Franco-German war, and it originally sat in front of the Reichstag. In 1938 Hitler had it moved to its current location in the middle of Tiergarten at a roundabout where a few major roads intersect.\n\nToday this is a popular tourist attraction. The Victory Column stands at 67 meters (about 220 feet) tall, and for a small fee, you can climb 285 stairs to the observation deck for excellent views of Berlin.\n\nSince the TV Tower can be a bit pricey, this is a good alternative for people traveling to Berlin on a budget.\n\nImportant info\n\nYou can see this landmark any time of day, but if you want to climb the tower to the viewing platform, the opening hours are:\n\nApril to October: Mon-Fri 9:30 AM – 6:30 PM, Sat & Sun till 7 PM\n\nNovember to March: Mon-Sun 9:30 AM – 5:30 PM\n\nThe entrance fee is 4 euros, cash only. Closest transport is the Hansaplatz station on the U9, or the Großer Stern bus stop.\n\nHolocaust Memorial\n\nThe Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, often referred to as the Holocaust Memorial, honors the large number of Jewish people who were killed by the Nazi regime.\n\nThis somber memorial consists of 2,711 concrete blocks of varying heights, and the ground they sit on is an uneven slope similar to a wave. The information center showcases letters, diaries, photographs, and biographies of the victims to help personalize the experience.\n\nImportant info\n\nEntrance is free for both the outside memorial and the inside information center. The outside memorial is open 24/7.\n\nThe information center is open October – April, Tuesday – Sunday 10am – 6pm, and May – September, Tuesday – Sunday 10am – 8pm.\n\nPhotography is allowed (no flash inside) but please be respectful. Do not sit on or climb on the cement slabs or take selfies. This is a place to reflect and remember those who were murdered.\n\nClosest transport: The memorial is located about halfway between S&U Brandenburger Tor where you can get the S1, S2, S25, S26, or U5 and S&U Potsdamer Platz where you can get the S1, S2, S25, S26, or U2.\n\nTopography of Terror\n\nThe Topography of Terror Museum is located where the headquarters of the Gestapo and the SS was between 1933 and 1945. Persecutions and killings of Nazi opponents were organized here, and the genocide of Jews, Roma, and Sinti was also coordinated here.\n\nNow it serves as a place to remember history and warn us from repeating the terrors of the past. The exhibits here use photographs and documentation to tell visitors about the crimes that were organized here.\n\nYou’ll also see excavation sites where you can view through glass windows. There’s also a long section of the Berlin Wall that still stands here.\n\nTopography of Terror is just a few minutes from Checkpoint Charlie, which is also on many people’s lists of must-see attractions in Berlin. It’s actually a cheesy site today, but it’s right near the Ubahn station, so you can get a quick glance before walking to the Topography of Terror museum.\n\nImportant info\n\nOpening hours: Daily 10 am – 8 pm. Holiday hours may differ. Entrance is free.\n\nClosest transport is Kochstraße where you can get the U6; Anhalter Bahnhof where you can get the S1, S2, S25, or S26; or Potsdamer Platz where you can get the S1, S2, S25, or S26, or the U2.\n\nPalace of Tears\n\nThe Palace of Tears, or Tränenpalast in German, is located at Friedrichstraße train station and was constructed in 1962. It was originally used by the East German dictatorship as a departure terminal for people leaving East Berlin for West Berlin.\n\nAt this location, many people were denied access to the border, and border guards forced people to leave their families and friends in tears. Today, the museum is a reminder of the separation of Germany and all the tears that were shed in connection with it.\n\nWhen you visit the Palace of Tears, you can see the exhibition featuring documents, films, original objects and interviews from affected individuals.\n\nImportant info\n\nOpening hours: Tuesday – Friday: 9 am – 7 pm, Saturday & Sunday: 10 am – 6 pm. Holiday hours may differ. Entrance is free.\n\nClosest transport is the Friedrichstraße Sbahn and Ubahn station where you can get the S1, S2, S3, S5, S7, S9, S25, S26, and U6, as well as trams 12 and M1.\n\nRead more about how to visit the Palace of Tears Museum.\n\nGendarmenmarkt\n\nGendarmenmarkt is one of the prettiest squares in Berlin. This historic square is home to an impressive trio of buildings: the French Cathedral, the German Cathedral, and the Konzerthaus.\n\nGendarmenmarkt is a great place to wander and see some of Berlin’s beauty. If you’re here over the holidays, you can visit one of the most popular Christmas markets in Berlin here.\n\nI also recommend climbing to the top of the French Cathedral for some wonderful views of the square and much of central Berlin.\n\nImportant info\n\nThe square is open 24 hours a day. The buildings located have different opening hours, please check them individually if you want to go inside.\n\nClosest transport is the Hausvogteiplatz station on the U2, but it’s also not far from the Stadtmitte station on the U2 and U6.\n\nEast Side Gallery\n\nThe most famous section of the Berlin Wall is the East Side Gallery. It runs along a stretch of the Spree River in the former East and is covered in art.\n\nAt 1.3km (0.8 mile) this is considered the longest open air gallery in the world.\n\nAfter the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, artists from around the world came here to paint murals on the Wall to celebrate Germany being reunited and to remind the world of terrible things that occurred here. Over the years, the art has changed several times.\n\nImportant info\n\nThis popular attraction is open 24/7 but is best enjoyed during daylight hours.\n\nClosest transport is the Ostbahnhof station (Sbahn) or the Warschauer Str S&U station.\n\nBerlin Wall Memorial at Bernauer Strasse\n\nThe Berlin Wall was, and still is, an important piece of the city’s character and history. Although there are lots of different places to learn about the Wall, the Bernauer Strasse Berlin Wall Memorial is one of the best.\n\nThis 1.4km (0.87 mile) section of road includes one of the last remaining pieces of the Wall. The Wall divided the street, with buildings on one side in the East and buildings on the other side in the West.\n\nPlacards describe what it was like living on the eastern side of Bernauer Strasse before and after the Wall went up, how it affected the neighborhood, how people tried to escape, and more. Markers on the ground show you where apartment buildings once stood and where escape tunnels were built.\n\nAbout halfway down the street, you’ll see building with a tower you can climb to see over the Wall and into the death strip. At the visitors center, you can watch two short films (alternating time slots for German and English) depicting the Wall in the city as well as what it was like out in the countryside where the Wall divided East and West Germany.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best Cold War Era site in Berlin. It can take a decent amount of time to see all the different sections, so with three days in Berlin, you should be able to fit this into your itinerary.\n\nImportant info\n\nVisitors Center opening hours: Tuesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.\n\nDocumentation Center opening hours: Wednesday to Sunday from 10 a.m. – 6 p.m.\n\nOpening hours of the outdoor sections are listed as Monday to Sunday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., although there is no gate barring you from wandering around outside of these hours.\n\nClosest transport to the Visitors Center is the Nordbahnhof Sbahn station where you can get the S1, S2, S25, or S26. The M10 tram also stops at Nordbahnhof, Gedenkstätte Berliner Mauer (where the tower is), and you can get the M10 or U8 at the Bernauer Str station.\n\nCharlottenburg Palace\n\nBuilt in 1695, this Baroque palace was named for Sophie Charlotte and served as her summer palace. It’s a gorgeous palace with ornate interiors and excellent gardens, and it was inspired by the Palace of Versailles.\n\nToday you can visit the museums inside to learn more about the palace’s history and enjoy the gardens. It’s well worth going inside for a visit, but if the insides of palaces and castles aren’t your thing, you can still wander through the grounds and see the gardens for free.\n\nImportant info\n\nPalace museum opening hours:\n\nNovember – March\n\nTuesday – Sunday 10 am to 4:30 pm\n\nApril – October\n\nTuesday – Sunday 10 am to 5:30 pm\n\nClosest transport is the Schloss Charlottenburg bus stop on the M45 bus.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church\n\nThis famous landmark is one of the most important churches in Berlin. The original church was built here in the 1890s, but it was damaged in 1943 in WWII air raids.\n\nInterestingly, the church was not rebuilt and instead has been left much as it was after the war. Its been nicknamed by Berliners as Der Hohle Zahn—literally “The Hollow Tooth”. It’s a stark reminder of the destruction of war.\n\nImportant info\n\nOpening hours:\n\n9am to 7pm\n\nTours are offered several times a day, and though they are free, the church does ask for a donation of at least 5 euros.\n\nClosest transport is S&U Zoologischer Garten or U Kurfürstendamm.\n\nTempelhof\n\nOne of Berlin’s most interesting green spaces is Tempelhofer Feld, a former airport that is now a huge park. In 1948-1949 during the Berlin Blockade, this airport was the hub of the Berlin Airlift, which kept West Berlin supplied with goods while land routes were blocked.\n\nTempelhof Airport continued to operate even after the Berlin Wall came down and East and West Germany reunited. It wasn’t until 2008 that the airport closed.\n\nIn 2010, it reopened as a public park, and the runway and airport building remain. Today you can enjoy walking, running, roller blading, cycling, kite surfing, and more all on a former airport runway.\n\nThere are grassy areas where you can have a picnic, gardening areas, fenced dog areas, bird protection areas, and more. This park is a Berlin favorite.\n\nImportant info\n\nOpening hours: The park hours vary by month, but in general the park is open from dawn to dusk. Entrance is free, though most of the airport building is only accessible on a tour.\n\nClosest transport: This is a huge park with multiple entry points, so there are several different S&U stations near the park.\n\nSouthwest: S+U Tempelhof on the S41, S42, S45, S46, S47, and U6 lines. This station is the closest to a park entrance.\n\nWest: Paradestraße on the U6 line.\n\nEast: Leinestraße or Boddinstraße on the U8 line. You won’t immediately see the park from these stations, but it’s not too long of a walk.\n\nNorthwest: Platz der Luftbrücke on the U6 line. This will get you near the airport building, but it’s probably the least convenient station for the actual park.\n\n>>Do you have a little extra time? Consider spending 4 days in Berlin.\n\nBerlin Itinerary Day One: Berlin Mitte from Alexanderplatz to Brandenburg Gate\n\nStart your day with the most iconic sights in Berlin. These are the attractions Berlin is most famous for and include those postcard photos you’ve been looking forward to.\n\nI’ve got a lot packed into this day, so feel free to move a few things to day 2 or day 3 if you want to go a little slower.\n\nSome attractions are closed different days of the week. Plan ahead with these articles:\n\nWhat to do in Berlin on Sundays\n\nWhat to do in Berlin on Mondays\n\nAlexanderplatz\n\nAlexanderplatz is one of the central transportation hubs in Berlin. Three ubahn lines, multiple sbahn lines, several regional trains, and several trams and buses run through Alexanderplatz.\n\nRight outside the station is a big open square that often hosts events like Christmas markets and other festivals. You’ll also find lots of shopping here.\n\nTV Tower\n\nWalk to the other side of the Alexanderplatz station to the famous Fernsehturm, or TV Tower. This is a fantastic place to get views of Berlin from above.\n\nThis is the highest viewpoint in the city, so lines can be long, even early in the day. Therefore you should book a skip-the-line ticket ahead of time.\n\nThe viewing platform of the TV Tower has photos and info all the way around so you can see what you’re looking at. Different buildings and other landmarks are pointed out for your reference.\n\nUnter den Linden\n\nUnter den Linden is a street in Mitte that’s packed with history and attractions. On a sunny day, it’s nice to walk its length while stopping occasionally to enjoy a monument or museum.\n\nAfter you’ve had your fill of views from the TV Tower, walk through the square to get a quick glance at the Neptune Fountain and the Marx-Engels-Forum. Then make your way to Karl-Liebknecht-Str. As you cross the Spree River, the road changes names and becomes Unter den Linden.\n\nThis pretty, tree-lined boulevard makes for a good stroll through many of the city’s centrally located attractions, and many others are just a short detour from this street.\n\nTo save a few minutes, you could also hop on the U5 in the direction going towards Hauptbahnhof, and exit at Museumsinsel. This is where Unter den Linden starts, and the section you skipped isn’t all that exciting.\n\nLearn more about what to do along Unter den Linden.\n\nMuseums and monuments\n\nAt Museum Island, admire the Berliner Dom (Berlin Cathedral), the Lustgarten park in front of the cathedral, and the gorgeous buildings that make up the Museum Island complex. With a 3 day Berlin itinerary, you should have time to take the Berliner Dom tour and/or go into at least one of the museums here.\n\nBut it’s worth noting that if you do decide to spend a few hours in the museums, you’ll probably have to move a few of the day 1 attractions to day 2 or day 3. You might have to cut a few things out, but you know what your sightseeing priorities are, and it’s ok not to see it all.\n\nAlso nearby is the DDR Museum is on the east side of the river. This museum will give you a feel for how people lived in East Berlin when the city was divided.\n\nAcross the street from the cathedral is the Humboldt Forum, an art and cultural museum located in the reconstructed Berlin Palace. It’s also technically on Museum Island.\n\nAs you walk west on Unter den Linden and cross the river, you’ll see the German History Museum where you can learn about different time periods in Germany’s past.\n\nContinuing down Unter den Linden, stop at Bebelplatz. Here you’ll see a memorial to Nazi book burning.\n\n>>Check out these fun facts about Berlin.\n\nGendarmenmarkt\n\nTake a detour off of Unter den Linden to see Gendarmenmarkt. This lovely 18th century square is home to the Deutscher Dom and the Französischer Dom (German Cathedral and French Cathedral) and Schinkel’s Konzerthaus (concert hall), though the two cathedrals are now museums.\n\nBerlin has many squares, and Gendarmenmarket is undoubtedly one of its prettiest. This square often hosts events, such as a popular Berlin Christmas market in December.\n\nTopography of Terror\n\nFrom Gendarmenmarkt, walk south to the Stadtmitte Ubahn station, hop on the U6 going south for one station, and get out at Kochstr. This is where you’ll see Checkpoint Charlie.\n\nToday Checkpoint Charlie is little more than a cheesy hut in the middle of the street, though it does have historic significance. Grab a quick photo (note: those fake guards you’ve seen in photos are no longer allowed to be there) and then walk west to Topography of Terror.\n\nHere you’ll learn more about the Nazi era and where they planned out their evil. You can also see a long section of the Berlin Wall here.\n\nThe Checkpoint Charlie area has a few other attractions that might interest you, including the Checkpoint Charlie Wall Museum, Die Mauer Panorama Wall Museum, the Gropius Bau art museum, the Disgusting Food Museum, and the Weltballon (helium balloon for views of Berlin).\n\nMemorial to the Murdered Jews\n\nNext make your way to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews. This somber memorial honors the Jewish victims of the Holocaust.\n\nIts design was meant to give visitors the feeling of uncertainty, and some feel the memorial is very moving while others feel the design missed the mark. Entrance is free.\n\nIt’ll take about 15 minutes to walk from Topography of Terror to the Holocaust Memorial. The route goes through Potsdamer Platz, so allow a few extra minutes if you’d like to see the small section of Berlin Wall there.\n\nBrandenburg Gate\n\nFinally come see Brandenburg Gate, one of the most recognizable sights in Berlin and all of Germany. This grand monument is Berlin’s only remaining city gate.\n\nThough inspired by the Acropolis in Athens, it was built in the late 1700s. It sits at what was once the dividing line between East and West Berlin. Today it represents unification of Berlin and Germany.\n\nOn the walk from the Holocaust Memorial to Brandenburg Gate, you’ll see Tiergarten to your left. I have some Tiergarten exploration listed on day 3 of the itinerary, but if you already know you’re going to adjust a few things, it’s easy to see the park for a few minutes at this point.\n\nBerlin Itinerary Day Two: Reichstag Building, Berlin Wall, Tempelhof\n\nToday’s Berlin itinerary involves fewer stops but a little more transportation. It’s best to have a day pass for more flexibility as you explore the Berlin Wall and more.\n\nReichstag Building\n\nThe Reichstag Building is the seat of the German Parliament. It’s sort of the equivalent of the White House in Washington, DC.\n\nThe building is topped by a glass dome that you can visit, and it’s one of the most popular free things to do in Berlin.\n\nAs you walk around the spiral path, the audio guide tells you interesting information about the German Parliament, the building itself, some of the nearby areas, and more. It’s available in English and several other languages and lasts about 20 minutes.\n\nTo visit the Reichstag Building, you must register ahead for a time slot. Even if you can’t get a spot on the free tour, don’t miss seeing this important German landmark.\n\nPalace of Tears\n\nFrom the Reichstag Building, you can walk to the Palace of Tears in 15 minutes or less. It’s a pretty walk along the Spree.\n\nJust outside the Friedrichstr S&U station is the Palace of Tears Museum where you can learn about this important border crossing and what life was like in a divided city.\n\nBernauer Strasse Wall Memorial\n\nNext take the Sbahn (S1, S2, S25, or S26) from Friedrichstr to Nordbahnhof to see the Bernauer Strasse Wall Memorial.\n\nStart at the visitors center, which is near the Nordbahnhof Sbahn station. Upstairs you can see two short films that tell the story of the Wall, one about Berlin itself and one about the Wall farther out that separated East and West Germany.\n\nI highly recommend watching these films (alternating in English and German, so you can plan your timing ahead) for a great look at an important piece of Berlin’s history. The German version is on the hour, and the English version is on the half hour.\n\nThen make your way down the street towards the Bernauer Str Ubahn station, reading the placards along the way. About halfway down the road is a building with a viewing platform a few floors up that looks over a remaining section of the Wall so you can see the death strip and how the Wall looked towards the end.\n\nIn my opinion, the Berlin Wall Memorial on Bernauer Strasse is one of the most fantastic sights in the city to truly understand the effects the Wall had on communities.\n\nPrenzlauer Berg\n\nOnce you’ve reached the end of the memorial, keep walking a few blocks, or hop on the M10 tram for two stops, and check out Mauerpark.\n\nMauer means Wall in German, and the Berlin Wall used to run through this park. It’s a local favorite but certainly attracts a fair amount of tourists due to the location.\n\nThere’s an ever-changing graffiti wall in one section. Big open grassy sections make for a nice picnic or lounging space.\n\nOn Sundays, there’s karaoke in one area, and one of the most well known flea markets in Berlin dominates the park. If you’re in Berlin on a Sunday, I highly recommend coming here.\n\nEast Side Gallery\n\nThis is probably high on your list of things to do in Berlin. The East Side Gallery is considered the longest outdoor art gallery in the world, and it’s a series of street art pieces painted onto a remaining stretch of the Berlin Wall.\n\nSome of the pieces will look quite familiar to you, while others aren’t so famous. Plus some of them change from time to time.\n\nBecause it’s so popular, it can get quite crowded. Try to be patient if a lot of people are trying to take pictures of the same sections.\n\nYou can either start at the south end near Warschauer Str and walk northwest up Mühlenstr, or start near the Ostbahnhof train station and walk southeast until you reach Warschauer Str. For this itinerary, it’s easier to minimize backtracking if you end at Warschauer Str.\n\nTo get here from the Bernauer Str Wall Memorial or from Mauerpark, make your way back to the Bernauer Str Ubahn station. Take the U8 south (towards Hermannstr) and get out at Jannowitbrücke where you will switch to the S3, S5, S7, or S9 for one stop to Ostbahnhof.\n\nTo know which is the right direction for these Sbahn lines, make sure the end/destination listed is one of the following:\n\nS3: Erkner\n\nS5: Strausberg Nord\n\nS7: Ahrensfelde\n\nS9: Flughafen BER\n\nBasically if any in the group on your platform have the word “West” in them, don’t go that way. You want to travel east.\n\nFeels too confusing? You can get out at Jannowitbrücke and walk 15-20 minutes along Holzmarktstr, which becomes Stalauer Pl. Keep the river on your right, and you will eventually see the beginning of the East Side Gallery.\n\n>>Check out our list of the best World War II and Cold War attractions in Berlin.\n\nFriedrichshain\n\nOnce you’ve had your fill of the East Side Gallery, talk a walk down Warschauer Str a few blocks away from the river. Once you get past the train tracks, go for a wander through Friedrichshain.\n\nRAW-Gelände is an alternative area of bars, clubs, restaurants, and more. This area has lots of interesting street art, and on Sundays there’s a big flea market.\n\nA little farther, the Boxhagener Platz area and over to the Ostkreuz station is lively and nice to wander through. Plus this neighborhood has plenty of options for food, and Boxhagener Platz itself has a great fresh market on Saturdays and a flea market on Sundays.\n\nTempelhof Field\n\nAfter World War II, Berlin ended up with three main airports, one of them being Tempelhof. This is where the Berlin Airlift took place.\n\nBut eventually after the Wall came down, the city didn’t need this airport and it was closed. Today what remains has become one of Berlin’s most loved parks.\n\nThe runway, taxiways, and even the airport building still remain. People come here to run, ride bicycles, have BBQs with friends, enjoy gardening, let their dogs play in designated fenced areas, and much more. You can even take a tour of the airport building.\n\nGrab some food to go from a nearby restaurant and a few beers from a Späti, and enjoy a leisurely dinner at the end of your day of sightseeing.\n\nTo reach Tempelhof from Friedrichshain, it depends on where exactly you are. From Ostkreuz, hop on the S41 and get out at the Tempelhof station. The S41 is the Ringbahn going clockwise, so that exact number only goes in that direction.\n\nIf you’re closer to Warschauer Str, get to the Warschauer Str Sbahn station (NOT the Ubahn) and take either the S3, S5, or S7 to Ostkreuz and switch to the S41. Or you can take the S9 to Treptower Park and switch to the S41 from there.\n\nBerlin Itinerary Day Three: Tiergarten, Charlottenburg\n\nDespite 30+ years of reunification, Berlin still feels very different on the east vs on the west. Many, but not all, of the places you saw on days one and two were in East Berlin. Today let’s see some of the West.\n\nTiergarten\n\nThe huge park in the center of Berlin is another local favorite. Tiergarten was once a hunting ground but is now a sprawling, tree-filled park that brings unexpected quiet in the middle of the busy city.\n\nIn the eastern part of the park, you’ll see ponds and fountains, statues and memorials. There’s a Soviet War Memorial, various memorials honoring victims of the Holocaust aside from Jews (homosexuals, Sinti, Roma), a memorial honoring Beethoven, Haydn and Mozart, and more.\n\nTowards the center of the park at the large intersection of the four roads that cut through the park you’ll see the Victory Column, or Siegessäule in German. This well known attraction is another great place to climb for city views, but it’s stairs only, no elevator here.\n\nThe western end of the park has a small lake, a few more statues, and a cafe. Just beyond this section you’ll see the Landwehr Canal and into the Berlin Zoologicher Garten, the city’s zoo in the West. (Tierpark is the zoo in East Berlin.)\n\nIf you enjoy zoos or if you’re visiting Berlin with kids, the Berlin zoo is a must. Or from Victory Column, walk north past the Bellevue Palace and through the English Garden to reach the Bellevue Sbahn station, where you can catch an Sbahn to Zoo Station.\n\nKaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church\n\nA short distance from the Zoo and the Zoo S&U station, you’ll find Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, which stands a church in ruins.\n\nCheck out more Berlin World War II attractions.\n\nShopping and KaDeWe\n\nFor those of you who love shopping, this is the place for it. A little east of the S&U Zoo station is the Bikini Mall, filled with interesting boutique stores and a handful of familiar chains, plus there are lots of windows facing into the Zoo.\n\nJust south of the Zoo is Kurfürstendamm, a big shopping street that has been compared to Champs-Elysees in Paris. Here you’ll find high end shops, such as Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and the Apple Store.\n\nAt the eastern end of the street the name changes but the shopping continues. Just before you reach Wittenbergplatz is the famous Kaufhaus des Westens, or KaDeWe for short.\n\nThis department store shopping complex includes Tiffany, Gucci, Hermes, Chanel, Burberry, and more. The upper level is where you’ll find gourmet food, a fun level to explore even if you aren’t into shopping.\n\nCharlottenburg Palace\n\nTo reach Charlottenburg Palace from the Zoo station, hop on the M45 bus towards Johannesstift/Spandau. If you’re farther along on Kurfürstendamm, take bus 109 towards U Jakob-Kaiser-Platz. From either bus, get out at Luisenplatz/Schloss Charlottenburg.\n\nYou can visit the Old Palace and the New Wing, either on separate tickets or on a combo ticket if you want to see both. The gardens and surrounding park are also worth wandering through, especially if the weather is nice.\n\nIf you prefer the outsides of castles, you’ll be happy to know that the gardens and park are free to enter, even if you don’t buy a ticket to go inside Charlottenburg Palace.\n\nWhere to eat in Berlin\n\nAre you a celiac? Pick up one of these super detailed gluten free restaurant cards that you can show to restaurants in Berlin and Germany to help you eat safely during your trip. They’re written by a celiac and translated by native German speakers.\n\nBerlin is a huge city, and where you eat depends in part on where you are at meal times. And remember, this is a multicultural city, and there’s really delicious food of all kinds, not just German food.\n\nAlternate Berlin itinerary ideas\n\nEveryone has different tastes and different interests. You might also want to change a few things if your 3 days in Berlin happen to be rainy ones.\n\nHere are a few ideas for other things to do in Berlin that could be good to swap out with anything above you’re not interested in doing.\n\nTake a day trip\n\nIf you’re a fast traveler, and you’ve seen everything you want to see in 2 days instead of 3 days in Berlin, consider taking a day tour on your 3rd day. Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp and Potsdam are two of the most popular day trips from Berlin.\n\nVisit more museums\n\nSome people love museums, and Berlin is a great city for museum hopping. Aside from Museum Island, described on day one, here are a few others to try.\n\nMärkisches Museum: This museum focuses on the history and culture of Berlin.\n\nSt. Nicholas Church Museum: Learn the history of the oldest surviving building in the city.\n\nGerman Museum of Technology: Deutsches Technikmuseum in German, this museum is all about transportation technology.\n\nSpy Museum: This is a hands-on museum focusing on espionage.\n\nJewish Museum: Here you’ll learn about the history of Jews in Germany.\n\nPhotography Museum: Here you can see photography exhibits from the 19th century to present.\n\nShop in a different way\n\nMaybe all the fancy shopping listed on day three isn’t your thing. Luckily Berlin is mostly full of places to shop that are NOT fancy. After all, the city’s unofficial slogan is “sexy but poor”.\n\nBut this is where it helps to dig deeper into the non-touristy areas.\n\nFlea markets: It’s best to look for flea markets on Sundays, though they do take place on other days of the week sometimes. Mauerpark is a popular one on Sundays, but also try Boxhagener Platz, Prinzessinenngärten, Maybachufer, Arkonaplatz, Ostbahnhof, and Fehrbelliner Platz, just to name a few.\n\nSecond hand stores: Berlin is a great place for second hand and vintage shops. Wander through the Boxi area or Prenzlauer Berg or Bergmannkiez…the options are endless really. The city is also home to the large second hand department store, Humana. There are several locations, but the one at Frankfurter Tor is the largest in Europe.\n\nBoutique stores: If second hand isn’t your thing, you can still buy some unique items at boutique stores throughout the city. Get off the main roads and away from the international chain stores and big shopping malls, and you’ll find locally owned stores with clothing, jewelry, bags, and more.\n\nTake a tour\n\nSeeing Berlin with a tour is a great way to make the most of your time and learn about the city and its history from the experts.\n\nFood tour\n\nFood tours are an interesting way to learn about a city’s culture and history through its food. The Eating Europe Berlin Food Tour focuses on several aspects of food culture in the Friedrichshain neighborhood.\n\nBoat tour\n\nThe Spree River runs through the center of Berlin and once formed part of the border between East and West Berlin. A variety of boat tours show you the sights near the water, or you can even take a boat tour on one of the city’s canals.\n\nBike tour\n\nIf cycling is your thing, a bike tour is a great way to explore the city. You’ll get from one sight to the next faster than on foot, and you’ll learn about the Berlin’s history and culture while getting a little work out.\n\nStreet art tour\n\nBerlin is famous for is street art, and a guide will be able to show you the best pieces. Some are famous while others are under the radar, and a tour is a great way to understand the importance of street art in Berlin.\n\nI’ve taken this tour, and it was really interesting and fun.\n\nGo at your own pace\n\nItineraries are tough to write because no one person travels the same as another person. If you’re a fast traveling type, you might be able to squeeze in more sights than I’ve listed here.\n\nBut if you prefer to travel more slowly, you might think my 3 day Berlin itinerary is too fast paced. Cut things out, rearrange the order if you want, swap days around even.\n\nBerlin has something for everyone, so if you want to spend your whole 3 days shopping or going to museums or going to every single Cold War attraction or looking for street art, you can do it.\n\n3 days in Berlin itinerary FAQs\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions about spending 3 days in Berlin and planning a Berlin itinerary.\n\nHow can I spend 3 days in Berlin?\n\nHopefully my detailed 3 day Berlin itinerary has been helpful for you to decide how to spend your time here. Most first time visitors to Berlin want to see the big attractions like the TV Tower, Brandenburg Gate, Berlin Cathedral, Museum Island, Holocaust Memorial, and Reichstag Building, East Side Gallery.\n\nBut there are many other important and interesting sights that I’ve included that will make your trip to Berlin more enjoyable and show you more of the city’s history and character.\n\nHow many days are sufficient for Berlin?\n\nI think 3 days in Berlin is a minimum to really see a lot of the attractions and some of the city’s vibe. More is always better, and if you only have 1 day in Berlin or 2 days in Berlin, you can still see a lot.\n\nMy suggestion is to plan as much time as you can for seeing Berlin, and if you find it wasn’t enough, come back for another visit!\n\nDo and don’ts in Berlin?\n\nDon’t dress up in Berlin. Don’t bother with Checkpoint Charlie unless it’s super important to you to see.\n\nDo eat other cuisines besides German. There are big Turkish and Vietnamese communities here, but the sky’s the limit when it comes to food in Berlin.\n\nRead more about things to know before you come to Berlin.\n\nIs 3 days enough in Germany?\n\nNo, 3 days is not enough in Germany. It’s barely enough for just Berlin. If you want to see more than one city in Germany, I recommend at least a week for Berlin and Munich.\n\nYou could also spend a week in Berlin and East Germany seeing Dresden and Leipzig. Or go to Hamburg for a few days. The Rhine Valley or the Black Forest are other gorgeous regions to explore.\n\nGermany is a varied and diverse country, with each region different from the next. Berlin is wonderful, but it’s very different from the rest of the country.\n\nIs 5 days in Berlin too long?\n\nI feel like this is a trick question. No, 5 days in Berlin is not too long if you really want to dig into the city.\n\nThis is long enough to see the major sights as well as some lesser visited ones. It’s long enough to go at a slower pace, which gives you time to relax more.\n\nWith 4 days, 5 days, or even longer in Berlin, you can try lots of different restaurants, visit lots of museums, take several day trips. You could actually sleep in a little – after all, it is vacation, right?\n\nWhat should I do on my third day in Berlin?\n\nOn your third day in Berlin, I recommended seeing Tiergarten, Charlottenburg Palace, and a little more of West Berlin. But you could also use that day to take a day trip to Potsdam or go from Berlin to Concentration Camp Sachsenhausen.\n\nOr if you like to travel a little slower, you could spread out the sightseeing I’ve listed on days 1 and 2 into a 3 day Berlin itinerary. There are lots of options because there really are so many things to do and see in Berlin.\n\nWhat should I do in Berlin?\n\nIf you’re trying to decide what to see in Berlin in 3 days, go see the big sights like the TV Tower, Berliner Dom, and Brandenburger Tor. Learn about WWII history and Cold War history.\n\nBut also explore street art. Go for a wander and see quieter streets that are less touristy. Get into nature in one of the many parks right in the city or a hiking trail on the outskirts.\n\nEat the food and drink the beer. This is a fantastic city, and the sky’s the limit.\n\nWhat are the top 3 things to do in Berlin?\n\nIt’s hard to narrow down the entire city to just 3 things. The 3 most famous sights are the TV Tower, Brandenburg Gate, and the Berlin Cathedral.\n\nBut top 3 things to do in Berlin? I’ll go more broad. Learn about the history, eat some delicious food, and enjoy the laid back vibe.\n\nCheck out more suggestions for what to do in Berlin, and start planning your trip.\n\nBerlin Travel Resources"
