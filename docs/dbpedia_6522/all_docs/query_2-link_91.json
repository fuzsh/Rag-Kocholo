        "text": "Gesine Adler (soprano), Susanne Langner (alto), Stefan Kunath (altus), Tobias Hunger (tenor), Klaus Mertens (bass)\n\nCollegium Vocale Leipzig\n\nMerseburger Hofmusik, direction: Michael Schönheit\n\nUnfortunately, there was a conflict in the festival programming which made a decision which concert to attend particularly tormenting. How to decide between a performance of The Art of Fugue and a programme that explored the influence of French music in Bach. As I have been immersed in the fête galant world of the sensibility of Antoine Watteau and Francois Couperin for many years, I decided against the magnificent intellectual labyrinth of the fugue to embrace the more hedonistic delights of the French influence on Bach.\n\nVoltaire called the seventeenth century in Europe the century of Louis XIV. This Apollonian Bourbon used the fine arts, monumental architecture, landscaped formal gardens and superbly refined music to give France a supremacy and influence in culture and politics that she has never regained but is certainly recalled. The king supported his luminaries and creative people to an unprecedented degree which ‘elevated him not only above the heroes of his race or those of other peoples, but beyond the scope and boundaries of the mortal condition.’ Bach was born towards the end of the century (1685) at a time when the French organ school of Nicolas de Grigny and Jean-Henri d’Anglebert was exerting influence on the North German organ school of Bach’s youth and when engaged as a Court musician. He heard much Italian and French orchestral and harpsichord music (predominantly that of Francois Couperin) which influenced him greatly. But where Louis XIV used music to extend the power and political influence of his royal absolutism to the point of decadence at the end of his life, Bach wrote in a religious church music context (the cantatas) to pay homage to the glory, the power and the omnipotence of the Christian God.\n\nIn the first work on the programme Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland (Now come, saviour of the gentiles) BWV 61 (1714) for the 1st Sunday in Advent, Bach combines French elements and that of North German music. The opening chorus is written in the style of a grand French Overture, a great favourite for Bach opening movements (the arrival of the Sun King was often announced with such noble, stately music). The Collegium Vocale Leipzig and Merseburger Hofmusik, directed by Michael Schönheit gave a fine account of this work.\n\nThis was followed by a Grand Motet by Telemann Deus , judicum tuum, TWV7:7 (1738). This composer was a far more cosmopolitan figure than Bach and had spent almost a year in Paris meeting members of the royal court orchestra, Jean-Philippe Rameau and impressing Parisian audiences with his own compositions. The Grand Motet was a French genre that gave a musical focus to Louis attending the Chapelle Royale for daily mass. Again a fine performance that showed a deep understanding and familiarity with French baroque performance practice.\n\nThe ‘Florentine’ Jean Baptiste Lully controlled every aspect of operatic composition and motets (he wrote twelve) in the France of Louis XIV. He was a strict disciplinarian over his singers and instrumentalists insisting on the highest musical performance standards, obsessively centralizing the final outcome. The Te Deum which we heard this evening was composed in 1677 for the christening of his son Louis, a godchild of Louis XIV. It is an ostentatious and noble work for two choirs with prominent declamatory parts for timpani and trumpets.\n\nIn a later performance on January 8, 1687 to celebrate the recovery of the king from an illness, he accidentally stabbed himself in the foot with his baton. The wound turned septic and gangrene set in. The inscription on his tomb reads ironically in part, considering the cause of his death : ‘God , who endowed him with these talents over all men of his century, gave him as a reward for the inimitable hymns which he has composed to his praise with a truly Christian patience during the acute pains of illness….’ With unconditional support from the Sun King, Lully had little to fear from rival composers or cabals and high level accusations against him, although there were many. The rivalry between the French chorus and ballet and the vocal art of the Italians (Louis XIV was a brilliant dancer and often took part in his own court spectacles). The idea of a reconciliation between the rival French and Italian styles of composition inspired many composers. Francois Couperin wrote a fine work entitled Les goûts réunis (The Styles Reunited).\n\nThis was a splendid opulent performance, full-blooded and trumpet and timpani resplendent in the Nikolaikirche with tremendous forward impetus and grandeur. One was justifiably placed in awe of the genius of Lully and his unquestioned hegemony over the orchestral, operatic and religious French music of the day."
