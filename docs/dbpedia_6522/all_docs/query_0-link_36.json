Another week's return on brokers' loans by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is at hand, and likewise another monthly statement by the New York Stock Exchange itself, and it is difficult for any well-informed commentator who has an appreciation of what figures of such magnitude as those contained therein mean—what a menace they involve to the entire community—to speak with restraint and in calm, temperate language, of the way the movement is proceding, week after week and month after month, without the slightest indication that the end, the inevitable end, is in sight, or even is near. It is impossible to characterize such a situation without resort to expressions and terms which to the ordinary mind will seem extreme and yet the situation merits the severest strictures and really makes it a public duty for anyone in authority, or having influence and weight, to speak in unsparing terms in denunciation of what is going ,on! The pages of history would have to be scanned in vain to find anything quite parallel to it. Staid financiers, with a long record of experience in the financial world, look on in a dazed kind of way, evidently puzzled to know what to do about it, then complacently accept the situation on the theory that this is a big and growing country with vast and unlimited resources and therefore we must not be unduly disturbed by mere size—that borrowing for speculative purposes must be expected to be in proportion to everything else in this marvellous country of ours. But the way in which the movement is now progressing makes further dallying with it too grave a responsibility for any serious minded person to face without a shudder. The foremost fact, of course, about this week's Federal Reserve statement on brokers' loans is the enormous new expansion disclosed. The stock market collapse the early part of December brought a decline of substantial proportions in the grand total NO. 3315. of these loans and many prayed that it might mean a definite turn and that by degrees this borrowing to carry on the unbridled speculation in the stock market, might be reduced to more nearly normal figures —a result clearly possible while yet leaving such borrowing on much higher levels than on previous similar occasions in proportion to the country's general growth and development in the period since then. But this week's returns have made it apparent that that was not to be. After 15 consecutive weeks of increases during which the total of these loans to brokers and dealers (secured by stocks and bonds) by the 43 reporting member banks in the New York Federal Reserve district rose from $4,201,131,000 on Aug. 22 to $5,394,590,000 Dec. 5, an expansion of considerably over a billion dollars, there came in the Federal Reserve statement for Dec. 12 a decrease of $218,839,000, followed by a further decrease on Dec. 19 of $64,929,000 and still another decrease of $19,395,000 on Dec. 26, making a contraction for the 3 weeks combined in the very considerable sum of $303,163,000. But now comes this week's return and shows that nearly all the good work has been undone. The statement issued after the close of business on Thursday for the week ending Wednesday night Jan. 2 brings the revelation of a new expansion during the past week in the prodigious sum of $238,676,000, bringing the total back to $5,330,103,000, or only $64,487,000 less than the peak figure of $5,394,590,000 reached on Dec. 5. We get some idea of the magnitude of the recent expansion when we observe that at $5,330,103,000 for Jan.2 1929 these brokers' loans by the 43 reporting member banks in New York City compare with $3,810,023,000 on Jan. 4, 1928, evidencing an expansion for the 12 months of over 11/ 2 billion dollars, the precise amount of the expansion being $1,520,180,000. It happens, too,that in this latest week's new outburst of Stock Exchange borrowing, the increase in the new supplies furnished has come entirely from loans made by the 43 reporting member banks on their own account. These loans for own account jumped during the week from $1,109,301,000 on Dec. 26 to $1,516,049,000 on Jan. 2. This is rather significant, inasmuch as heretofore the New York City banking institutions have been putting all the blame for the excessive use of bank credit for speculative account on the wicked outside banks for -whom these New York banks are loaning money and on the still more desperately wicked domestic individuals and corporations who insist on placing their deposits at the comand of the banks to be employed in the same way in the stock market, but with the stipulation that the profits growing out of such loaning, at the high rates prevailing on the Stock Exchange, be placed to the credit of the depositors instead of to 2 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE the.banks. But in this latest week, whatever the reason or explanation may be, heavy decreases occurred in the lending under the two categories referred to. During the week the loans for account of out-of-town banks were reduced from $1,659,899,000 to $1,647,988,000, while the loans \"for account of others\" dropped from $2,322,227,000 to $2,166,066,000. The Stock Exchange figures tell the story of the way borrowing on collateral loans is proceeding, with even greater emphasis. As has many times been pointed out in these columns, the Stock Exchange compilation is much more comprehensive than the Federal Reserve statement and hence deals with totals of even greater dimensions than those of the Federal Reserve Bank. For November the Stock Exchange tabulation had shown an expansion of over $511,000,000, bringing the Stock Exchange total away above six billion dollars, or to be exact, to $6,391,644,264, of course the very largest ever recorded. But now that we have the figures for December it appears that instead of any decrease in the total, as the result of the collapse of the stock market, the amount for Dec. 31 has established another new high peak, at $6,439,740,511. What has happened, of course, is that the shrinkage in the early part of the month, when stock prices so violently declined, was more than overbalanced by the renewed borrowing which ensued when the stock market again revived the latter part of the month. At $6,439,740,511 for Dec. 31 1928 these Stock Exchange loans compare with $4,432,907,321 Dec. 31 1927 and with $3,292,860,255 on Dec. 31 1926. In this case, therefore, the increase for the year is over $2,000,000,000 and for the last two years no less than $3,147,000,000. Is it necessary to add anything to the weight and significance of comparisons like these which speak so eloquently for themselves? The renewed expansion in'loaning on Stock Exchange account did not, during the past week, lead the member banks to extend their borrowings at the Federal Reserve institutions any further. Currency is now returning from the interior and the member banks will no doubt use this return flow of money in part at least to reduce their existing large indebtedness at the Reserve institutions, even though another part may be used in carrying stock speculation still further. During the past week, the discount holdings of the 12 Reserve institutions fell only from $1,167,579,000 to $1,151,464,000. The holdings of acceptances purchased in the open market were also only slightly reduced, falling from $489,270,000 to $484,358,000. On the other hand, holdings of U. S. Government securities were increased during the week from $232,328,000 to $243,953,000. Altogether the amount of Reserve credit in use was maintained at near top levels, total bill and security holdings Jan. 2 being $1,889,660,000 as against $1,899,312,000 a week ago. A year ago on Jan. 4 1928 the amount of such holdings was only $1,536,293,000. During the past week the amount of Federal Reserve notes in circulation by the 12 Reserve institutions declined from $1,910,838,000 to $1,829,364,000, while gold reserves increased from $2,584,239,000 to $2,587,627,000. It deserves to be pointed out that while discounting by the member banks at the 12 Reserve institutions combined declined a little over $16,000,000, at [VOL. 128. the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, there was actually a big increase in member bank borrowing, the discount holdings at the New York Reserve Bank having run up from $387,841,000 to $495,458,000. On Jan. 4 1928 the discount holdings of the New York Reserve Bank aggregated no more than $178,771,000. That shows the situation at New York, the speculative center, plainly enough. The stock market this week has distinguished itself by a new upward spurt in values. After the great collapse which occurred the early part of December, prices were pretty steadily bid up by the big groups of speculators who have been controlling the course of prices so steadily during the last two or three years, their policy being to allow big breaks from time to time whenever the market became topheavy by too extensive.a following, thereby correcting what is termed \"technical weakness.\" Last Saturday the bidding up process was conducted with intensified vigor, carrying prices up sharply on top of the extensive recovery of the preceding two weeks. The result was large and general gains. On Monday the upward movement was carried still further, the purpose evidently being to give the year an imposing appearance of strength at its close. On Wednesday, after the New Year's holiday, the upward movement of prices was carried a step further and no serious setback was permitted on Thursday or Friday. Very extensive selling to realize profits occurred on both the last mentioned days, but the stocks disposed of were readily absorbed, the factor now used to stimulate speculation being the easing of money rates along with the probability that the easing could be counted upon for some time to come, owing to the return flow of currency from the interior sections of the country. On Monday the Stock Exchange loaning rate was still 12%, but on Wednesday there was a decline to 10%, on Thursday to 7%, and on Friday to 6%. On the latter day the renewed increase in brokers' loans might have been expected to be a depressing agency, but its influence was offset by the further decline in the call loan rate. The volume of business has been gradually growing and the same is true of the dealings in the New York Curb Market. On Saturday last the sales on the Stock Exchange aggregated 2,686,820 shares; on Monday they were 4,887,700; on Wednesday 5,413,610 shares; on Thursday 5,095,580 shares, and on Friday 5,532,200 shares. On the New York Curb Market the sales last Saturday were 1,004,100 shares; on Monday 1,349,600 shares; on Wednesday 1,451,300 shares; on Thursday 1,597,200 shares and on Friday 1,739,500 shares. Nearly all classes and groups of share properties show substantial net advances for the week, though there are exceptions to the rule.

The British reaction to the report was largely one of astonishment. The rueful conclusion was drawn that Britain, in the matter of reparations payments, has been bearing a disproportionate share of the war burden relatively to her former enemy and her former Allies. The author of the report arrived in New York Thursday, on the Berengaria, but declined to make other than a few non-committal statements. He will confer with Washington officials before returning to Berlin, and it is believed that choice of the American experts to serve on the new commission will be largely with his concurrence. Formal announcement was made in Geneva late last week that the Preparatory Disarmament Commission of the League of Nations has been summoned to convene at the League city on April 15 1929. The setting of a definite date attracted much interest as the meeting of the Commission had been postponed on successive occasions throughout 1928, notwithstanding persistent agitation by Russia and some of the smaller nations of Europe for its early convocation. At the last meeting of the League Assembly, it was decided to hold the Preparatory Commission Conference before the end of February, in any event. The leaders of the League Council again decided, however, early in December, that further postponement would be advisable, dispatches asserting at the time that this was due chiefly to the change in the American Administration on March 4 next. The League announcement now made is as follows: \"The last Assembly decided that a meeting of the Preparatory Commission should be held at the end of 1928, or in any case at the beginning of 1929. Accordingly, the President of the Commission has the honor to convene the Commission for a session beginning at Geneva on Monday, April 15, 1929, at 11 o'clock.\" Two points in connection with the convocation were much discussed at Geneva, according to a dispatch of Dec. 28 to the New York \"Times.\" It was noted that such a meeting has never before been announced more than two months in advance of the date set, and also that in the present instance no agenda has been established. \"It is therefore deduced by observers,\" the dispatch said,\"that reasons exist, probably as a result of inter-governmental conversations held since the denouement of the AngloFrench naval agreement,to suppose that the commission can make serious progress through negotiations in the interim to fix and perhaps considerably enlarge the agenda.\" It was indicated in Washington that the United Statets will again be represented at the coming meeting, American observers having been present at the last previous meeting early in 1928. Secretary Kellogg remarked, Washington reports said, that the personnel of the American delegation would probably be the same as that of last year. The latter was headed by Hugh S. Gibson, Ambassador to Belgium, and included Rear Admiral Hilary P. Jones, retired, and Rear Admiral Andrew T. Long, with a corps of technical assistants. Hugh Wilson, Minister to Switzerland, also served with the delegation. Favorable bulletins on the condition of King George V during the past week have been received in Britain with much satisfaction, and there is now hope that the monarch may shortly be pronounced [Vol.. 128. out of immediate danger and well on the way to recovery. The King became ill on November 20, and the ravages of the disease have been heavy. Progress was nevertheless reported almost every day this week. Although the bulletins were cautiously worded, apparently with the idea of preventing too great optimism, other developments caused a more hopeful view to be taken. Sir William Joynson-Hicks, the Home Secretary, departed for a holiday in France, Thursday, saying before his departure that he considered the worst of the illness over. \"There is every reason to hope that a slow but gradual improvement will take place,\" he said. \"I had a consultation with the doctors before I thought it safe to go.\" Since the Home Secretary would be the State official whose presence would be most necessary in the event of the King's death, Sir William's departure was considered doubly.significant. A new budget for the year 1929 was passed by the French Parliament just before the close of 1928, and concurrently with this action, Raymond Poincare acted on his previous threats and proposed to offer his resignation as Premier to President Doumergue. The Premier stated in the Chamber last week that he would resign when the budget was passed, taking the position that when he remade his Ministry on Nov. 11, it was with the single purpose of pushing through a sound budget before the end of the year. With the year-end approaching and the passage of the budget assured, Aristide Briand, the Foreign Minister, was understood to have used every argument to prevent M. Poincare from carrying out his threat. The Premier, nevertheless, proposed to his Cabinet, at a meeting on Dec. 31 that he offer his resignation. but was dissuaded from proceeding in this course. A Cabinet communique, issued on the subject, said:\"In the exchange of views, members of the Cabinet were unanimous in thinking that, despite the importance of the results which have been achieved, so much remains to be done for consolidation of these results, both in the international and the domestic field, that the presence of M. Poincare at the head of the Government remains indispensable to the success of this task. M. Poincare submitted to the unanimous arguments of his collaborators.\" Final agreement was reached on the budget by the Senate and Chamber on Dec. 30, and it was passed on the same day. Expenditure during 1929 will be 45,366,000,000 francs (about $1,800,000,000), and receipts 45,430,000,000 francs, leaving an estimated favorable balance of about 64,000,000 francs. A cabinet crisis occurred in Yugoslavia last Sunday, Premier Anton Koroshetz handing his resignation to King Alexander because of dissatisfaction over his handling of the Croatian question. Father Koroshetz came into power six months ago, when a deep rift separated the Serbs and Croatians in the Tri-une Kingdom after the shooting of a number of Croatian deputies in the Skuptchina, or National Assembly. The Croatians refused to attend further sessions of the National Assembly thereafter, demanding autonomy within the Kingdom, with a separate Parliament at Zagreb, central city of Croatia. The National Assembly in Belgrade became a onesided affair thereafter, and in July, 1928, Father Koroshetz, as the leader of the Slovenian Clerical Party, was appointed Premier. The present crisis was ocasioned when Premier Koroshetz appointed JAN. 5 1929.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE a military man as Prefect of the Zagreb district, a post that has hitherto been filled by a civilian. M. Davidovitch, leader of the National Democratic Party, began to side with the Croatians, and demanded a change in this procedure or else the resignation of the Premier. M. Koroshetz chose to resign, but remained in office for a few days longer, owing to the illness of King Alexander. The latter received the Premier January 2 and informed him that his resignation was accepted, pending the formation of a new Cabinet. It is expected that a new Government will be formed over the present weekend. .7 to remain in the hands of the Under-Secretaries for the present. The Cabinet otherwise is as follows: Finance, Antonio Barberena; Under-Secretary of the Interior, Dr. Bernardo Sotomayor; Public Instruction in the hands of the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Cordero Reyes; Public Works, Benjamin Abaunza. In his inaugural address, President Moncada expressed deep thanks for the benefits of peace and harmony and earnest prayers for their continuance. They were, he said, \"the great and supreme aspiration of our country which has been made poor by civil discord.\" He called upon his fellow citizens for full co-operation with the Executive. The elections of November were frankly referred to by the new Executive as the most civilized in the history of the country. \"We have complied with our duty,\" he said,\"and the Nicaraguan people responded magnificently to the hopes which we had conceived for their welfare. It is only just that we should render fervent homage to them for the splendid part they took in the November election. In the same manner, we but comply with our duty in giving thanks to the people of the United States, to the electoral mission headed by General Frank R. McCoy as well as to Admiral Sellers, General Logan Feland, the United States Marines and the Guardia Nacional for having conducted the election in the most honora ble manner that could possibly be conceived.\" General Moncada promised to promote at every point the progress of the nation by means of school s, railroads and highways. In foreign relations he advocated a policy of friendliness, \"motivated for the good of the continent and its mutual defens e.\" He referred to the proposed Nicaraguan Canal in such a way as to imply that every aid would be given in construction of this supplementary waterway be. tween the Atlantic and the Pacific. Meetings in Washington of the International Conference of American States on Conciliation and Arbitration were again taken up largely in the past week by attempts to draft an acceptable protocol of conciliation for signature by the two disputing South American. States, Bolivia and Paraguay. The Paraguayan Government informed the Conference on Dec. 29 that the text of the instrument placed before both Governments last week was acceptable with but few slight changes. Bolivia agreed to the protocol \"in principle\" Dec. 31. The document finally received the definite approval of both Governments late Thursday. By signing the protocol, it is understood that both countries pledged themselves to stop all concentration of troops, and that they further expressed their firm intention to come to an agreement as soon as possible to find n solution for the Chaco problem. With the way cleared for amicable consideration of the differences of the two countries, the sub-committee on arbitration treaties of the Conference resumed its discussions and approved Thursday a draft multilateral treaty and an additional protocol of progressive arbitration, which were approved yesterday by the Conference in plenary session. These are aimed at gradual amplification of the system of pacific settlement of internaAttempts by the Cuban Government to contro l tional disputes.

China presented the spectacle of complete political unification for the first time in many years, when, on Dec. 29, the Manchurian regime of General Chang Hsueh-liang announced formal adherence to the Nanking National Government. The announcement of the change of Manchuria from its semiindependent status was made in a communication issued at Nanking and was confirmed by a change in the flags flying at Mukden and other Manchurian cities. Dispatches from Mukden, moreover, stated that General Chang and his associates had decided to acept without reservation the authority of the Nanking Government. Much conjecture was caused by this action regarding the attitude of Japan, as the Tokio Government has for some time been considered .the chief factor in preventing such a move by the Manchurians as has now been consummated. \"No reaction has been reported from Tokio,\" a Shanghai dispatch of Dec. 29 to the New York 'Times\" said, \"and it is expected there will be no outward signs of disapproval.\" The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on the same day that virtually all the old treaties with foreign Governments had been revised since America took the lead in such revision last July. Japan is now the only important nation that has not revised its old treaty with China. Of interest in that regard is a statement, made in Washington Dec. 28, that Secretary Kellogg has started negotiations with representatives of the Chinese Government for an arbitration treaty similar to those concluded last year with a number of other Governments. China, meanwhile, is struggling with two immense internal problems. The first is the famine in the interior northern provinces, where 12,000,000 people are slowly starving and many are doomed. The second is that of demobilization of the Chinese \"military\" forces. The country has 1,500,000 men under arms, most of whom are merely organized bandits. Nanking desires reductions of this force to 500,000 men, and is seeking the cooperation of the various military leaders in this endeavor. Extension of the rule of the Nanking Nationalist government over all of China is illustrated by an official ruling of the Nanking regime's postoffice department changing the name of the old capital from \"Peking\" to \"Peping.\" The old name signified \"Northern Capital\" in Chinese, and the Nationalist government does not wish that meaning to apply to any other city than Nanking.

In its latest statement, issued for the week ending Jan. 2, the Bank of England shows another, but smaller, loss in gold, this time of £737,000; the reserve of gold and notes in the banking department however, shows a gain of £9,211,000 due to the contraction in note circulation of £9,948.000. The ratio of reserve to liabilities, which last week sunk to its lowest point for the year (1928), recovered slightly this week and now stands at 24.24%.

On Monday, the final day of the year, demand loan rates remained firm at 12%, with turnover very heavy, due to demands by brokers for accommodation and withdrawals by the banks of approximately $50,000,000. Although the supply of funds was none too large, the market already showed some relaxation from the closing days of the previous week, when rates in the unofficial market were marked up to 14%. The easier trend was reflected in a drop in rates when the market re-opened Wednesday after the New Year's day holiday. The renewal rate was again fixed at 12%, but funds flowed into the market in volume and the rate was subsequently lowered to 10% on the Stock Exchange, while in the outside market it declined to 9%. Renewals Thursday were at 10%, and the rate dropped quickly thereafter to 7% in the official market, while 6% was quoted at the close in the outside market. Demand funds in yesterday's market, after renewing at 8%, declined to 6%, while in the outside market funds were available at Brokers loans against stock and bond collateral, as reported for the week ended Wednesday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, showed the tremendous increase of $238,676,000, this representing the largest change that has every taken place in a single week. The renewed expansion virtually nullified the shrinkage of the three preceding weeks and again carried the total back almost to the extreme high record of Dec. 5, which preceded the drastic break on the Stock market. The monthly tabulation of the New York Stock Exchange also was issued this week, and it showed an increase of $48,096,247 for December, attaining a new high record. Imports of $2,087,000 gold at the Port of New York were noted by the Federal Reserve Bank for the week ended Wednesday, while exports were $167,000. 9 Dealing in detail with the call loan rates on the Stock Exchange from day to day, all loans on Monday were 12% including renewals. Tuesday was New Year's holiday. On Wednesday the renewal charge was still 12%, but as the day advanced new loans were negotiated at 10%. On Thursday the renewal rate was reduced to 10% and new loans were put through at 7%. On Friday the renewal charge was reduced to 8% and new loans could be obtained at 6%. The rate for time loans of all dates of maturity from 60 days to six months has been 7@74% on each day of the present week, but the 302day quotation experienced considerable change from day to day. On Saturday the figure for 30-day maturities was 84@81 /6; on Monday morning it was 84%; on Monday afternoon the rate fell to 8%;on Wednesday it was 8%; on Thursday it was 732@,74%, and on Friday the figure was 74%. As against quotations last Friday of 84@83/2% for 30-day maturities and maturities and 74% for all other periods from 60 days to six months, the rates at the close of the market on Friday of this week were 74% for 30-day maturities and 73/2@74% for all other dates of maturity. Because of the mid-week holiday and the continuance of a high call money rates, business is the commercial paper market has not improved and has in fact been hardly worth mentioning. Names of choice character maturing in four to six months are still quoted at 51/2%, with a few names of exceptional character selling at 51/ 4%. For names less well known the figure is 53 / 4%. New England mill paper commands 51/ 2@53 / 4%. The American Acceptance Council yesterday advanced its posted rates for banks and bankers acceptances Y. i %, in bills of all maturities excepting only those running for 30 days. This was done after the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had raised its buying rate for 90 day acceptances from 43/2% to 44%. The rates of the Council for prime bankers acceptances eligible for purchase by the Federal Reserve banks are now 44% bid and 432% asked for bills running 30 days, 5% bid and 44% asked for bills running '60 and 90 days, VA% bid and 47A% asked for 120 days, and 534% bid and 5% asked for 150 and 180 days. The posted rate of the Acceptance Council for call loans against acceptances continued at 7% until yesterday When it was announced that the council had abandoned quoting the rate on call loans secured by acceptances. It was explained that somewhat confused conditions existed, with dealers making individual arrangements with their banks for accommodation when necessary, and that different rates, ranging from 04 to 8% were being paid. Open market rates for acceptances were also raised 34 of 1% on Friday in both the \"bid\" and \"asked\" columns for all periods from 60 to 180 days. The quotation for 30-day maturities, spot delivery, was kept unchanged at 44% bid, 4327 0.asked, while the figure foe delivery within thirty days, 90-day maturities, was increased from 4/3% bid to 54% bid for both eligible member and non-member banks.

The recent sudden and wide rate changes are usual year-end phenomena which indicate little with regard to the major movements of exchange. The rate changes of November and those of the present week and of the remainder of January are more nearly reflective of the fundamental 4 factors. The range this week has been from 4.845 to 4.85% for bankers' sight, compared with 4.84% to 4.85 9-16 last week. The range for cable trans2, compared fers has been from 4.85 1-16 to 4.853/ week. The previous the 11-16 4.85 to 2 with 4.853/ demand for the and dull extremely been has market sterling exchange practically dried up. On the other hand, there appears to be a slight increase in demand for dollars abroad, which will develop still further within the next few days as funds which have been withdrawn by European interests are expected to return in considerable volume to the New York market for investment. The sudden firmness which developed in sterling exchange about three weeks ago and which was continued up to about Friday of last week was due to the withdrawal of British and other funds from the New York market to meet year-end settlements of various kinds, for bank window-dressing, and the transmission of gift checks by Americans to relatives and friends abroad. Commenting on the reversal in the trend of sterling, the \"Wall Street Journal\" said: The market now is speculating as to whether foreign exchange rates will continue to follow the precedents of a year ago. Last January the exchanges were under pressure throughout the month, with sterling especially depressed. This January they have more adverse factors to face than they did a year ago. Last year money rates here were below those in most countries abroad, and the peak of the flow of capital from New York to Europe was just ahead. The present spread between money rates here and abroad is in favor of New York, and should continue to attract foreign funds. Now that the year-end operations are over, the gradual drain of money to this market, interrupted in December, will probably be resumed. It is difficult to see how there can be much of an expansion in volume of foreign loans in this market if money rates here continue as high as is expected, and in many quarters a further reduction in volume is looked for. Hence, the only apparent alternative to declining foreign exchange rates is rising European money rates. Most bankers who follow the foreign markets feel that the latter development is probable, but not until after exchange rates have undergone further pressure. • Although the Bank of England's rediscount rate continues unchanged at 43/2%, there is renewed talk and rather widespread expectation that the bank must soon increase its rate in order to protect its [VOL. 128. gold holdings which are threatened from several quarters. London bankers express the belief that the call money rate in New York will decline so far in January that the market will be less attractive to European funds and thus be some factor in protecting sterling from undue pressure. London bankers also believe that American bankers will endeavor to discourage the influx of foreign loans in the New York money market. The fact that bankers' acceptance i of 1% on rates were increased in New York Y Friday of this week is an indication that the general level of money rates, even for business purposes, will be slightly firmer on this side and must soon bring about an increase in rates in London as an offsetting influence. Hence, the expectation is strengthened that the Bank of England may increase its rediscount rate. As noted here in recent weeks the Bank of France has taken considerable gold from the London market and has engaged the supply from South-Africa for a few weeks ahead at 84s. 113/2d., i.e., on the same terms as if the metal were purchased directly from the Bank of England. The declared object of the French purchases is to bring the Bank of France gold ratio to . 40%,the legal ratio is 35%. All purchases of gold in London by foreign central banks or others are subject to constant criticism in the financial columns of the, London papers, contrary to the attitude taken by London on gold movements before the war. This week the Bank of England shows a loss in• gold holdings of £737,741, total bullion holdings standing at £153,329,533, compared with £152,303,247 a year ago.. British gold imports during the week ended Dec. 31 totaled £965,812 and exports £115,770. On Wednesday the Bank of England sold £8,592 in gold bars and received £750,000 sovereigns released from earmark. On Thursday the Bank sold £5,165 in gold bars. On Friday the Bank released £250,000 in sovereigns and exported £15,000 in sovereigns. Canadian exchange continues at a discount. Montreal funds opened at 19-64 of 1% discount on Saturday last, but closed at Yi of 1% discount before the short session was over and continued at that rate on Wednesday and Thursday. January is a month of seasonal pressure against Canadian exchange and the market is looking for increased gold shipments from Montreal to New York. At the Port of New. York the gold movement for the week Dec. 27—Jan. 2 inclusive, as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, consisted of imports of $2,087,000, of which $1,250,000 came from Canada, $750,000 from Argentina, and $87,000 chiefly from Latin America. Exports consisted of $167,000, of which $100,000 was shipped to Venezuela, $54,000 to Germany, and $13,000 to India. The Federal Reserve Bank reported an increase of $24,999,000 in earmarked gold. It is believed that this gold was earmarked for account of the Bank of France. Referring to day-to-day rates sterling on Saturday last dropped off sharply. Bankers' sight was 4.84 15-16@4.85%; cable transfers 4.85 7-16@4.853. On Monday exchange was again under pressure. The range was 4.843@4.85 for bankers' sight and 4.853@4.85% for cable transfers. On Tuesday, New Year's, all markets were closed. On Wednesday sterling continued to decline. The rage was 4.84 11-16@4.84% for bankers' sight and 4.853/ 8@4.85 3-16 for cable transfers.

Commercial sight bills finished at 4.84%; 60-day bills at 4.803 %; 90-day bills at 4.79; documents for payment (60 days) at 4.80%, and seven-day grain bills at 4.84. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4.849/ 8. The Continental exchanges have been dull, with a practical cessation in demand, for very much the same reasons as have already been discussed in the opening remarks on sterling exchange. French francs moved down with the other exchanges, but the exact quotation of the franc is very largely a matter \"of regulation by the Bank of France, which endeavors to shift the peg up or down according to the franc-mark rate in order to protect its gold from withdrawal to Berlin. This week, as noted above, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has earmarked $24,999,000 gold which, it is believed, is for the account of the Bank of France. On the supposition that this is the fact, the total earmarkings for French account in recent weeks amount to approximately $55,000,000. Some remarks on the French withdrawals of gold from London by London financial authorities have been pointed out above in the discussion of sterling exchange. The Bank of France statement as of Dec. 29 shows the elimination of the item \"foreign exchange loaned\" which was a hold-over from the pre-stabilization period. Before stabilization when the Bank of France was building up its huge reserves of foreign exchange, money was extremely easy in France and higher in most foreign countries, but French banks were reluctant to place funds abroad owing to the uncertainty as to the level of legal franc stabilization and the possibility of a loss on exchange transactions in transferring funds. The Bank of France assumed the risk of exchange loss on short-term exports of capital by French banks by agreeing to loan to the banks on franc collateral part of its foreign balances, thus enabling the banks to employ the borrowed exchange abroad. When the franc was stabilized, such loans amounted to about 10,000,000,000 francs of foreign exchange, mostly dollars and sterling, but the practice ended when the value of the franc was finally fixed. Loans made before stabilization have been liquidated gradually, the last having been paid off during the final week of December. German marks have moved off slightly for seasonal reasons. The movements this week, as during the past few weeks, have been closely associated with those which have governed sterling exchange. This week a further small shipment of $54,000 in gold was made from New York to Germany, bringing the total of these small shipments to $1,089,000 in about 20 weeks. There is renewed talk in foreign exchange circles of the probability of a reduction in the Reichsbank rediscount rate, which is now 7%, disproportionately high with other leading central bank rates. German business has been depressed to a considerable extent during the past six months. A five weeks' shutdown in the steel industry came to an end in December. Textiles, except artificial silk, have been slack and a number of other major lines have been running considerably below full produc- 11 tion point. Restricted credit needs of industry and increasing supply of foreign short-term money have caused a continued ease in money. Private discount rates were reduced in mid-December to 614%, the lowest in a year, and the entire situation points to a probable reduction in the Reichsbank rate. The London check rate on Paris closed at 124.09 on Friday of this week, against 124.02 on Friday of last week. In New York sight bills on the French /i a week centre finished at 3.909, against 3.913 / 8, and ago; cable transfers at 3.91, against 3.915 commercial sight bills at 3.903/2, against 3.9038.

Greek exchange closed at 1.293i against 2.513 for checks and at 1.293/ for cable transfers, against 1.29 and 1.2914. The exchanges on the countries neutral during the war, in sympathy with the sterling rate, have all recorded declines and for much the same seasonal reasons as those described in the discussion of sterling exchange. Aside from these general comments, which apply to guilders and the Scandinavian units especially, there are no new features of importance the present week with respect to the Continental currencies. Bankers' sight on Amsterdam finished on Friday at 40.153/2, against 40.193/ on Friday of last week; 2, against 40.213/ 2, and comcable transfers at 40.173/ mercial sight bills at 40.12, against 40.15: Swiss francs closed at 19.253 for bankers' sight bills and at 19.263 for cable transfers, in comparison with 4 a week earlier. Copenhagen 19.293j and 19.301 checks finished at 26.68 and cable transfers at 26.693/2 2. Checks on Sweden against 26.70 and 26.713/ 2 and cable transfers at 26.77, against closed at 26.753/ 26.813/ and 26.83, while checks on Norway finished at 26.66 and cable transfers at 26.673/ 2, against 26.681A and 26.70. Spanish pesetas closed at 16.32 for checks and at 16.33 for cable transfers, which compares with 16.31 and 16.32 a week earlier. The South American exchanges have been dull and, except in the case of the Argentine peso, have been ruling fractionally lower, largely through inactivity. This week $750,000 gold was received in New York from Argentina. It is doubted, however, that the shipment is the forerunner of any large influx of gold from Buenos Aires. In November the promise of a record wheat crop created by the excellent harvesting weather did much to renew business confidence and promote trade revival in Argentina. The present outlook is very promising, especially as to export returns, so that a strengthening of the peso rate is looked for soon. Brazilian exchange is weak owing partly to poor conditions in the coffee market. Export demand has fallen off,considerably since the third quarter of the year and money rates have become -firm-Cr in- Rio and'-other -centres. The FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 12 depression in coffee seems to have affected most lines of trade and the Government is now giving aid to business wherever possible. The coffee growers have, in many cases, found it necessary to accept Government aid. Because of year-end dulness and several large business failures the new year is starting off in a somewhat doubtful mood in Brazil. Argentine paper pesos closed on Friday at 42.19 for checks, as compared with 42.15, and at 42.24 for cable transfers, against 42.20. Brazilian milreis finished at 11.88 for checks and at 11.91 for cable transfers, against 11.90 and 1115-16. Chilean exchange closed at 12 1-16 for checks and at 121A for cable transfers, against 12 1-16 and 121A, and Peru at 4.00 for checks and at 4.01 for cable transfers, against 4.00 and 4.01.

Owing to a marked disinclination on the part of two or three leading institutions among the New York Clearing House banks to keep up compiling the figures for us, we find ourselves obliged to discontinue the publication of the table we have been giving for so many years showing the shipments and receipts of currency to and from the interior. As the Sub-Treasury was taken over by the Federal Reserve Bank on Dec.6 1920,it is also no longer possible to show the effect of Government operations in the Clearing House institutions.

The annual report of S. Parker Gilbert, Agent General for Reparations Payments, summaries of which were made public in this country on Wednesday, is of more than ordinary interest because of its bearing upon the work of the new committee of experts whose appointment was authorized at Geneva last September, and whose duty it will be to suggest \"a complete and definite settlement of the reparations problem.\" The publication of the report appears to have occasioned something of gloom at Berlin, marked satisfaction at Paris, and uncertainty at London as to whether the financial situation in either Germany or France had been correctly understood. It is highly improbable that Mr. Gilbert should have intended, through anything contained in his report, to prejudge the reparations situation or influence the work of the committee of experts in advance. The necessity of a settlement of the reparations question beyond the provisions made by the Dawes Plan has been long foreseen, and has been several times urged at length in the editorial columns of the \"Chronicle,\" but the impetus to such action as was taken at Geneva was undoubtedly due, in large measure, to Mr. Gilbert's frank statement, in his report of Dec. 10, 1927, that \"as times goes on, and practical experience accumulates, it becomes always JAN. 5 1929.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 13 clearer that neither the reparation problem, nor the which the Minister of Finance is no longer required other problems depending upon it, will be finally to show the disposition of cash resources in his annual solved until Germany has been given a definite and monthly statements.\" \"The practical problem\", task to perform on her own responsibility, without in short, \"is to keep governmental expenditurep foreign supervision and without transfer protection.\" within the limits of available revenues, and the time Mr. Gilbert himself worked hard to bring about the is approaching when more vigorous measures in this unanimity among the interested powers that re- direction will have to be taken.\" An opportunity to sulted in the Geneva agreement, and the difficulties \"correct present errors and provide for a basis of that he encountered appear to have been consider- settlement in the interest of the country as a whole\" able. In including in his latest report figures and will be offered, Mr. Gilbert points out, when the statements that seem to bear closely upon a possible budget for the ensuing fiscal year comes up for reparations settlement, he has done nothing more, discussion next April. apparently, than to describe the situation as he sees Special interest, naturally, attaches to what Mr. it, and to furnish, as far as his duties go, an accurate Gilbert has to say about the future ability of Gersummary of conditions as they now are. many to pay reparations. \"The general productivity As far as Germany itself is concerned, Mr. Gilbert's of revenues,\" the report states, \"even after farfourth report makes, on the whole, an optimistic reaching tax reductions, has established beyond showing. The payments called for by the Dawes doubt the essential basis for sound development of Plan have been punctually and fully made, and the the budget of the Reich, and it remains clear that no problem of transfer has presented no difficulties. question can fairly arise in the light of practical Of the total payments of 1,750,000,000 gold marks, experience thus far as to the ability of the budget of or 250,000,000 more than in the previous year, the Reich to provide the full amount of its standard 943,000,000 gold marks, or 54%, represented trans- contribution under the Dawes Plan.\" Commenting fers in money, an increased proportion of these being elsewhere in the report on the results of the fourth in foreign currencies, while 796,000,000 reichsmarks, year of the Plan, Mr. Gilbert declares that \"fundaor 46%, was represented principally by payments in mentally, confidence has been restored and Germany kind, most of which were made internally. The has been re-established as a going concern on a income from industrial debentures,railway bonds, the relatively high level of economic activity.\" It is transport tax and other controlled revenues pledged not to be supposed, he adds, that Germany, by for reparations payments has yielded \"a total return reason of its great progress during the past four which provides a margin considerably more than years, \"has yet made up for the values destroyed 100% over the standard budget contribution of in the war, or for the values which would have beea 1,250,000,000 marks,\" and without impairing the produced had there been no war, but it should always resources or efficiency of the railways and other be remembered that the present dislocations and sources from which these revenues are derived. Gen- difficulties are not confined to Germany.\" Finally, eral business conditions in Germany, Mr. Gilbert he reiterates the assertion of his memorandum of reports, are good. Aggregate production of all October, 1927, that \"the fact that there was no final industries, while probably lower than in 1927, was determination of Germany's reparation liabilities has \"decidedly above that of any other year since stabil- left an element of uncertainty in the Plan itself, and ' ization,\" and an increase in exports narrowed the in the affairs of all countries concerned in reparamargin between exports and imports until, in Septem- tions; it has become increasingly clear that a final ber, 1928, the two were about equalized.

Gilbert has expressed no opinion regarding the terms Mr. Gilbert is still critical, however, of the German or conditions which should govern a final settlement budget. The budget, he says, \"is still under the of the reparations question. He has not said that influence of tendencies toward overspending and Germany is able to pay 2,500,000,000 gold marks, overborrowing to which attention was called in the the maximum payment called for by the Dawes Plan, memorandum of Oct. 20, 1927.\" \"Sweeping increases every year for an indefinite number of years, or, for in official salaries and pensions\" (we quote from the that matter, for any year beyond the fifth year of press summary of the report as given in the New the Plan with which his report particularly deals; York \"Times\") \"started in 1927, and the continuing nor does he indicate the total amount of reparations drain of financial settlement with the States and that should be fixed in order that Germany may communes, which automatically deprives the Reich know what to expect and what to plan for.
