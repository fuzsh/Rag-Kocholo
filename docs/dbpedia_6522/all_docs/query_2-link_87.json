        "text": "What happens when baile funk has a passion child with techno? Satirical love songs? Maybe. But not satirical as in dumb, but satirical as in fun. Amor Satyr makes the club turn up on a Tuesday. Or a Thursday. Or on any day for that matter. This prolific French producer makes music that just works. So well.\n\nSoundcloud / Bandcamp\n\nWhile resisting the urge to say “Jungle is massive” in a paragraph about a deejay who plays Jungle music, one must acknowledge that the music here does indeed evoke massive feelings.\n\nOulu native ATI makes the amen break and the heart rattle.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nBrooklyn heavy-hitter Aurora Halal is a master of that shadowy, hypnodelic groove thing, with an attention to detail which makes tracks feed into each other in a seamless dreamlike state of pure being, lost in an intergalactic… sorry, got a bit carried away there. She’s really good, that’s all.\n\nHalal also sprinkles that same magic through the Mutual Dreaming party series and Sustain-Release, the intimate community festival in upstate New York she co-runs. Did someone say US dance music icon?\n\nSoundcloud / Bandcamp\n\nFrom the heat of Bogotá and Miami, guided by the sounds of Colombian guaracha and Venezuelan raptor house, Bitter Babe does the opposite of what her name might suggest: plays sweet, sweet music.\n\nBItter Babe is part of the swankiest movement going on at the moment, led by the TraTraTrax collective and label which she's a part of. Tribal and dembow drum workouts coupled with lush atmospherics on one end and rowdy energy on the other, touching on trance, reggaeton, and techno. This music just lifts you up (figuratively and literally). If you love drums and the heat of the drums, this one’s for you.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nFrom time immemorial people have shown that you only need a few ingredients to conjure up something great. Cucina Povera continues to prove that point.\n\nWith hauntingly beautiful releases on Vladimir Ivkovic’s Offen Music and Austria’s staple of experimental electronic music Editions Mego, to name a couple, Cucina Povera has positioned herself well among what’s been and what’s yet to come, using little more than her own voice and minimal synth lines. Subtle expressions of grandness.\n\nBandcamp / Soundcloud\n\nHelsinki’s new PoP (Prince of Prog).\n\nAs one of the key figures behind club0, DJ JVS and the gang have taken our local community by storm in the past couple of years, showing everyone where the rooster crows from. JVS’s own deejay sets are usually an amalgamation of trippy, driving and euphoria-inducing passages, perfect for the darkening evenings of the harvest moon.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nBored by the conventions of deejaying, DJ Marcelle presents music in a way that makes sound occupy a space or mental state rather than purely with the intention of making people dance. Unbothered by tempo changes and genre jumps, her DJing resembles the work of a painter.\n\nBut don't get us wrong, she is more than able to make butts wiggle and hips jiggle, albeit maybe in a different manner than most. A sense of tongue in cheek is at play here (d’uh), and the anticipation will have people standing on their toes, wondering where she will go next with the three turntables in front of her. “Another nice mess” is how she describes it. This one's for adventurous souls.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nMadrid raised, DJ and producer Digge Shim. aka Dip Shim, relocated to Malmö some years back and found his calling in the reincarnation of electro through his relentless output of acid- flavored 303 jams. Besides establishing the Malmø Traxx label, he also previously ran Malmö’s foremost record shop for electronic dance music.\n\nAs Digge Shim, his work is focused on medieval-ambient inspired by Gregorian chants, leftfield experiments and downtempo, all of which takes forefront for this live set that will trip your mind out into an unexpected spiritual journey.\n\nBandcamp / Soundcloud\n\n“Me and Toma, we are brothers,\n\nbrothers from a different father\n\nMe and Emma, we are brothers,\n\nbrothers from a different mother.”\n\n“Together we can play, together we can play\n\nLike brothers do, like brothers do”\n\nNow, the copywriter would like to offer their apologies for borrowing a few lines from DAF. But hey, they fit.\n\nEMMA DJ and Toma Kami are wiiiild and they make people go wiiiild.\n\nEmma dj / Toma Kami\n\nIf you’re looking to wine up and wile out, look no further. Viktor Kalima’s side project Ferdelance zones in on what could be called an industrial dancehall sound, and other dembow related beatwork. If you want a pure 45min example, there’s a live club recording available through our bio (and that sick ass EP he put out a few years ago). Should be all you need.\n\nFerdelance live at Solstice 2024 for your ‘get buck’ needs.\n\nSoundcloud / Bandcamp\n\nAvalon Unbounded, Bobby Forester, Deks Dekster, dRUMMAN, Electromantic, Zyntherius. These are just some of the aliases Jori Hulkkonen has used during his career spanning over 30 years. From heart wrenching synth pop to Detroit inspired techno, deep house, and straight up electro, Jori is an unbounded force of nature and a gift to the world.\n\nWe gathered a 30-track Youtube playlist of originals and remixes to honor this hero’s journey (link in bio). For Solstice 2024, Jori the yogi revives his dRUMMAN alias after a 12 (?) year break. Expect raw machine drum workouts and sequenced synth delight.\n\nSoundcloud / Bandcamp\n\nWhen you need your techno to go beneath surface level and tingle some psychic senses, you call Kaspiann. Reviving some of the sonics from golden era Northern Electronics (not to say it ain’t still that), Kaspiann’s music oozes with heady ethereal sensibility while keeping it driving and focused. Here’s a master of his domain. And with don’s like Dozzy rinsing his tracks, it’s hard to argue against.\n\nSoundcloud / Bandcamp\n\nFrom the Australian outback a sound echoes. It calls upon those who peak their ear out. Can you hear it? Can you feel it? It’s Kia.\n\nPsychosomatic sonics that multiple, take you high, and make you… touch the sky? Perhaps. Kia slays, big time. And it’s no wonder: she puts in the time to steadily release music through her label Animalia, deejays basically every single weekend, and keeps curating two almost weekly podcast mix series: Animix and Ani/live. That’s what’s up.\n\nSoundcloud / Animalia\n\nCan there be movement within stillness? Surely, and Kinzua has got the recipe for that. Hamburg x Leipzig music-lifers Lucas Brell and Qnete have been cooking up this stew with patience and care... with occasional tastings here and there. And soon... it’s time for the full course meal.\n\nLaura MRLS is the co-founder of event and podcast series Synae and runs the show Affine Dark Science in IDA Helsinki radio frequencies. As a proponent of darker sounds, Laura finds comfort through layered sonic fabrics that are intimidating at first glance but ultimately cathartic, adding into what is in the best of cases a mystic sensory experience.\n\nFor Solstice 2024 we finally get to hear their own music through her live performance.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nAfter Swedish artist Rivet's debut album On Feather and Wire – released 20 years into his career at the end of 2020 on the revered Editions Mego label – surprised and delighted with its punk spirit, industrial pulse, sensual atmospherics, and body music flavor, we get a better sense of what he’s capable of. Hinted at by his work as the body music enthusiast behind Kess Kill record label and the years honing his production skills first as Grovskopa and then as Rivet, his current sound has a sophisticated slink and a surprisingly accessible twist of pop, while still recognizable in its dance music lineage.\n\nBandcamp / Soundcloud\n\nClass, classics and ecstatics. Bongos, congas and thongas. Scandalous ravey house music that you can’t escape, nor will you want to.\n\nBarelona collective MARICAS affiliated siblings THC and DHC are here to make you baila. And you will never need no other.\n\nSoundcloud\n\nWhen two friends of over two decades intertwine in music, the results can be beautiful, or even go beyond beauty. Touching on dub, IDM and trip hop, Space Afrika’s intimate “ambient” music feels as personal as a parent’s guiding advice to a child.\n\n“Oblique mosaics of dialogue, rhythm, texture and shadow, half-heard through a bus window on a rainy night.”\n\nManchester duo Space Afrika will be performing live in the Kelo tent at Solstice 2024. Dive into their music through these links and you too might be “Kissing on these raindrops”.\n\nSoundcloud / Bandcamp\n\nEetu Sihvonen lives and works in Helsinki. They often work with wood, metal, and objects created with digital tools like 3D modeling and animating.
