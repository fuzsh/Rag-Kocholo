Each place has a total for how many days of wet weather it usually gets this month and for the normal amount of precipitation.\n\nYou can jump to a separate table for each section of the country: Northern, Central and Southern Germany.\n\nThe calculation of days only includes the days when precipitation totalled at least one millimetre (0.04 inches).\n\nThe month's total rainfall numbers are averages of three decades of weather data. Depending on the availability of information, the averages span either 1961 to 1990 or 1971 to 2000."
