The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the color is the average temperature for that hour and day.\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in April in Leipzig\n\nAverage Hourly Temperature in April in LeipzigApr11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMMarMayvery coldcoldcoolcoolcomfortable\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nHope, British Columbia, Canada (4,971 miles away) is the far-away foreign place with temperatures most similar to Leipzig (view comparison).\n\n© OpenStreetMap contributors\n\nCompare Leipzig to another city:\n\nClouds\n\nThe month of April in Leipzig experiences gradually decreasing cloud cover, with the percentage of time that the sky is overcast or mostly cloudy decreasing from 56% to 51%.\n\nThe clearest day of the month is April 27, with clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy conditions 49% of the time.\n\nFor reference, on December 25, the cloudiest day of the year, the chance of overcast or mostly cloudy conditions is 68%, while on August 8, the clearest day of the year, the chance of clear, mostly clear, or partly cloudy skies is 57%.\n\nCloud Cover Categories in April in Leipzig\n\n0% clear 20% mostly clear 40% partly cloudy 60% mostly cloudy 80% overcast 100%\n\nPrecipitation\n\nA wet day is one with at least 0.04 inches of liquid or liquid-equivalent precipitation. In Leipzig, the chance of a wet day over the course of April is essentially constant, remaining around 19% throughout.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 31% on July 14, and its lowest chance is 18% on April 10.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during April in Leipzig is essentially constant, remaining about 1.2 inches throughout, and rarely exceeding 2.4 inches or falling below 0.3 inches.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of April in Leipzig, the length of the day is rapidly increasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day increases by 1 hour, 49 minutes, implying an average daily increase of 3 minutes, 46 seconds, and weekly increase of 26 minutes, 21 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is April 1, with 12 hours, 59 minutes of daylight and the longest day is April 30, with 14 hours, 48 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe latest sunrise of the month in Leipzig is 6:45 AM on April 1 and the earliest sunrise is 1 hour, 1 minute earlier at 5:44 AM on April 30.\n\nThe earliest sunset is 7:44 PM on April 1 and the latest sunset is 48 minutes later at 8:32 PM on April 30.\n\nDaylight saving time is observed in Leipzig during 2024, but it neither starts nor ends during April, so the entire month is in standard time.\n\nFor reference, on June 20, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 4:53 AM and sets 16 hours, 37 minutes later, at 9:30 PM, while on December 21, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 8:13 AM and sets 7 hours, 51 minutes later, at 4:04 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment. The black isolines are contours of constant solar elevation.\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in April in Leipzig\n\nSolar Elevation and Azimuth in April in LeipzigApr11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM2 AM2 AM4 AM4 AM6 AM6 AM8 AM8 AM10 AM10 AM12 PM12 PM2 PM2 PM4 PM4 PM6 PM6 PM8 PM8 PM10 PM10 PM12 AM12 AMMarMay01010202020304050000102020303030405060\n\nnortheastsouthwest\n\nMoon\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of key lunar data for April 2024. The horizontal axis is the day, the vertical axis is the hour of the day, and the colored areas indicate when the moon is above the horizon. The vertical gray bars (new Moons) and blue bars (full Moons) indicate key Moon phases. The label associated with each bar indicates the date and time that the phase is obtained, and the companion time labels indicate the rise and set times of the Moon for the nearest time interval in which the moon is above the horizon.\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in April in Leipzig\n\nMoon Rise, Set & Phases in April in LeipzigApr11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303012 AM12 AM4 AM4 AM8 AM8 AM12 PM12 PM4 PM4 PM8 PM8 PM12 AM12 AMMarMayMar 1010:01 AMMar 1010:01 AMMar 258:01 AMMar 258:01 AMApr 88:22 PMApr 88:22 PMApr 241:50 AMApr 241:50 AMMay 85:23 AMMay 85:23 AMMay 233:54 PMMay 233:54 PM6:52 AM6:52 AM6:24 PM6:24 PM5:44 PM5:44 PM6:11 AM6:11 AM6:23 AM6:23 AM7:49 PM7:49 PM8:05 PM8:05 PM5:52 AM5:52 AM5:15 AM5:15 AM9:50 PM9:50 PM9:40 PM9:40 PM5:01 AM5:01 AM\n\nApr 2024IlluminationMoonriseMoonsetMoonriseMeridian PassingDistance 1 60%3:14 AMSE9:47 AMSW-6:31 AMS238,635 mi 2 50%4:10 AMSE10:53 AMSW-7:32 AMS235,312 mi 3 38%4:50 AMSE12:15 PMSW-8:32 AMS231,920 mi 4 26%5:19 AMSE1:44 PMSW-9:31 AMS228,705 mi 5 16%5:40 AMESE3:16 PMWSW-10:27 AMS225,960 mi 6 8%5:56 AMESE4:47 PMWSW-11:20 AMS223,986 mi 7 3%6:10 AME6:18 PMW-12:11 PMS223,037 mi 8 0%6:23 AME7:49 PMWNW-1:01 PMS223,272 mi 9 1%6:37 AMENE9:21 PMWNW-1:52 PMS224,713 mi 10 5%6:54 AMENE10:53 PMNW-2:45 PMS227,236 mi 11 11%7:15 AMNE--3:41 PMS230,592 mi 12 19%-12:23 AMNW7:44 AMNE4:38 PMS234,448 mi 13 29%-1:43 AMNW8:26 AMNE5:36 PMS238,447 mi 14 39%-2:48 AMNW9:21 AMNE6:32 PMS242,256 mi 15 50%-3:35 AMNW10:29 AMNE7:25 PMS245,611 mi 16 59%-4:08 AMNW11:43 AMNE8:14 PMS248,328 mi 17 69%-4:31 AMNW12:58 PMENE8:59 PMS250,310 mi 18 78%-4:47 AMWNW2:11 PMENE9:41 PMS251,531 mi 19 85%-5:00 AMWNW3:22 PMENE10:21 PMS252,025 mi 20 91%-5:11 AMW4:32 PME10:59 PMS251,865 mi 21 96%-5:20 AMW5:42 PME11:38 PMS251,150 mi 22 98%-5:30 AMW6:52 PMESE-- 23 99%-5:40 AMWSW8:05 PMESE12:17 AMS249,986 mi 24 100%-5:52 AMWSW9:20 PMESE12:59 AMS248,470 mi 25 99%-6:08 AMWSW10:38 PMSE1:44 AMS246,685 mi 26 96%-6:29 AMSW11:55 PMSE2:34 AMS244,690 mi 27 91%-6:59 AMSW-3:27 AMS242,524 mi 28 84%1:07 AMSE7:43 AMSW-4:25 AMS240,211 mi 29 75%2:06 AMSE8:44 AMSW-5:25 AMS237,777 mi 30 64%2:51 AMSE10:00 AMSW-6:25 AMS235,266 mi\n\nHumidity\n\nWe base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Leipzig is essentially constant during April, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 25, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 3% of the time, while on October 11, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Leipzig is decreasing during April, decreasing from 10.0 miles per hour to 8.7 miles per hour over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.0 miles per hour, while on August 6, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.8 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Leipzig throughout April is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 41% on April 1.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Leipzig typically lasts for 6.5 months (200 days), from around April 12 to around October 29, rarely starting before March 25 or after April 30, and rarely ending before October 8 or after November 24.\n\nDuring April in Leipzig, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is very rapidly increasing rising from 22% to 90% over the course of the month.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in April in Leipzig\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Leipzig are gradually increasing during April, increasing by 99Â°F, from 33Â°F to 132Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Leipzig is rapidly increasing during April, rising by 1.5 kWh, from 3.9 kWh to 5.4 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Leipzig are 51.340 deg latitude, 12.371 deg longitude, and 377 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Leipzig contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 187 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 378 feet. Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (381 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,962 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Leipzig is covered by artificial surfaces (98%), within 10 miles by cropland (54%) and artificial surfaces (33%), and within 50 miles by cropland (66%) and trees (19%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Leipzig, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Leipzig.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Leipzig according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Leipzig is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Leipzig and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nLeipzig-Halle Airport (EDDP, 84%, 8 mi, northwest, 85 ft elevation change)\n\nHolzdorf (ETSH, 7%, 45 mi, northeast, -115 ft elevation change)\n\nDresden Airport (EDDC, 4.1%, 62 mi, east, 377 ft elevation change)\n\nHofâPlauen Airport (EDQM, 2.8%, 76 mi, south, 1,581 ft elevation change)\n\nKarlovy Vary Airport (LKKV, 2.5%, 82 mi, south, 1,611 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Leipzig and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
