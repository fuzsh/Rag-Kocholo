Conditions can alter from day to day, year to year and region to region depending on which direction the weather fronts are coming: the sea or Continental Europe.\n\nThe Baltic Coast suffers harsher winters than the North Sea Coast. Baltic summers are warm and sunny but even the brightest summer days can be dramatically interrupted by thunderstorms. The North Sea coast enjoys the mildest winters in the whole of Germany except when the bitter east wind comes out to play. Rains can be heavy here in autumn but rain and storms from the Atlantic are possible at any time of year, so always have waterproofs with you.\n\nInland, the North German Plain, which houses Hanover and Berlin, shows small differences in weather between the west and east. In winter, the east is more exposed to the bitterly cold winds from Russia which are occasionally harsh enough to freeze canals and rivers. Summers are sunnier and less rainy than on the coasts: rain does occur but showers tend to be short, if intense.\n\nIn the central and southern hills, where Leipzig and Munich are situated, summer conditions vary from year to year: a good year brings long spells of sunshine but a bad year plagues inhabitants and visitors with lowering clouds and rain. Winter conditions vary according to altitude: the Bavarian Hills and Hartz Mountains experience long, snowy winters and the valleys surrounding them experience the occasional sharp frost.\n\nNorthern Rhineland is a major wine growing region even though winters can be cold and summers changeable. Overall, summer weather is predominantly warm with a fair amount of sunshine. The Upper Rhine Valley produces tobacco as well as wine, a tribute to its sunny summer climate which makes this region the warmest in Germany. Winters are another matter and can get very chilly but not as chilly as in the Bavarian Alps, Germany's most mountainous area and a centre for winter sports. Winters are crisp and snowy here and summers are fairly warm but very wet.\n\nWhat to pack for Germany weather\n\nCombine warmer clothes with lightweights in the summer and be prepared to wrap up well in the winter months. Take a raincoat if you are planning to visit the North Sea coast.\n\nGermany travel features\n\nDo you want to learn more about Germany?
