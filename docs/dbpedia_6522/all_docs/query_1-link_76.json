        "text": "Expect an average daytime temperature of 22°C in June in Germany during Euro 2024. Between 20°C and 30°C during the day is the maximum possible temperature that you can expect in that particular month. But still, there’s a chance of a difference in forecast because an individual or an institution don’t know what God knows. A high amount of sunshine is expected in the month of June.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit Germany in the near future or if you’re trying to cover a particular event in some particular month, like UEFA Euro 2024, then you should know the weather forecast. The best time to visit the country is in May and June. And for your information, the tournament is in June as well. With moderate wind speeds, the chances of rain are also high. The tourism ratio is also increasing in these months. It means the month of June is something brilliant; that’s why FIFA officials make this tournament happen in June.\n\nOn the other hand, the country’s tourism is at its absolute peak from June to September. Because these months are best for their weather, long days, and snow-free alpine trails. It’s expensive to travel to Germany compared to eastern countries like Romania or Bulgaria, but it’s quite cheaper compared to pricey western countries like France or Spain. With lots of sunshine and warm to hot temperatures, it makes it interesting for people to visit the country. UEFA Euro 2024 in June is the perfect timing to start the tournament in all aspects, like sunny weather, a perfect time for hiking, and increased tourism."
