So that you can enjoy sunny spring days and the wonderful summer carefree, you should not only protect your skin from UV rays, but also your eyes! Because without suitable eye protection in the form of sunglasses with UV protection, sunlight can cause acute and permanent damage.",

        "text": "Without eye protection, looking directly into the sun due to the high level of UV exposure can damage the retina within seconds and cause permanent loss of vision. But indirect sunlight can also damage the eyes.\n\nThe healthy eye has a kind of integrated sun protection in which the cornea and the eye lens absorb UV-A, UV-B and UV-C – but only slightly more than half of the radiation. The rest, together with the blue light, of which only around ten percent is absorbed, reaches the retina, namely to the point where sharp vision is located: the macula lutea, also known as the yellow spot. The harmful radiation affects the retina and lenses and can lead to temporary and permanent damage.\n\nNatural sun protection for the eyes is not enough\n\nThe natural automatic protective mechanisms of the pupil constriction, the sun protection of the eyebrows and wrinkles favoring increased blinking and squinting of the eyelids help for a short time. In older people, the lens of the eye has become cloudy and thus also offers some protection from direct sunlight. In areas where the harmful concentration of UV rays is particularly strong, this protection can hardly exist.\n\nAreas in which the eyes need sun protection from sunrise to sunset are, for example, mountains and particularly sunny areas. Snow reflects around 95 percent of the solar radiation and the intensity increases with every meter of altitude. The reflection of the water or sand is also a danger to the eyes.\n\nTemporary damage due to a lack of UV protection for the eyes\n\nThose who do without adequate protection of the eyes from sunlight run the risk of temporary and chronic damage. The most common acute reactions of the eyes to too much UV radiation include keratitis and conjunctivitis.\n\n(Photo) keratitis, also known colloquially as sunburn or snow blindness, occurs about six to eight hours after the eyes have been exposed to direct sunlight and the outer corneal layer has been damaged. (Photo) conjunctivitis, also known as conjunctivitis, can also result from exposure to sunlight. Severe pain, redness, burning sensation and tears, sensitivity to light and the feeling of having a foreign body in your eye are the consequences of both diseases, but these disappear again with medical treatment and several days of rest.\n\nChronic damage due to a lack of UV protection of the eyes\n\nPermanent damage occurs, for example, when the eyes are exposed to UV rays often and for long periods of time without protection. More than a third of all age-related changes in the cornea and conjunctiva can be traced back to a lack of protection of the eyes from sunlight in the past. These include pinguecula, the cleft eyelid, the yellowish, slightly raised thickening of the conjunctiva on the whites of the eye and pterygium, the wing skin in which the conjunctiva grows over the cornea.\n\nCataract\n\nAlso typical age disease of the eyes at the age from 65 – 70 years such as cataract, is triggered by sunlight, which causes lens opacity through oxidative processes. The clouding of the lens of the eye leads to a progressive deterioration in vision. In the case of cataract, the light falling into the eye can only poorly penetrate the lens. As a result, the light is scattered and the retina no longer has a clear, sharp image of the environment. The outside world is perceived as through a veil, only unclear and blurred, the perception of colors and contrasts clearly decreases. Fortunately, cataract can now be treated with outpatient surgery, with nearly 15 million of such procedures performed worldwide each year.\n\nDo you suffer from cataract?
