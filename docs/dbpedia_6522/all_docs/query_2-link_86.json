        "text": "MBA students at HHL are generally fairly impressed with their classmates. Although they can be “competitive,” they show a high level of “intellectual curiosity” and are “eager to contribute to team work.” Not surprisingly, the school manages to net a “diverse” student body and one that is “open to different people and cultures.” Additionally, students define their peers as “motivated” and “flexible” and people who “seek a challenge.” The program yields a wide age range, and students are generally anywhere from twenty-four to forty years old. However, the average age is twenty-nine, and most have around five years of work experience. Despite the diversity, most agree that a “family environment” permeates the campus.\n\nAcademics at HHL are demanding, and students “spend many hours at school.” If they aren’t in class, students can often be found attending “lectures, networking in the cafe- teria, or slaving over group work.” Of course, even these industrious souls need to kick back every now and again, and many classmates frequently “gather to have some drinks and share thoughts on business, economics, and politics.”\n\nBeautiful Leipzig also provides great distractions from business theory. A mere hour from Berlin by train, Leipzig is a cosmopolitan city in its own right. Considering that Bach, Mendelssohn, Wagner, and Goethe all lived there, it’s no surprise that there is still a thriving arts scene. The city is home to the Gewandhaus Orchestra; the world famous St. Thomas Choir; and a variety of museums, cafes, restaurants, and nightclubs. And with more than 40,000 students, it’s no wonder that this is a great place to study."
