        "text": "Spring 2024\n\nSpring 2024 as a whole as well as all three spring months March, April and May were warmer than normal compared to the long-term averages for the international climatological reference period 1961-1990. New temperature records were recorded for both March and spring. Mild temperatures in February had already significantly advanced the start into the growing season, with the result that all spring phases, pre-spring (flowering of hazel), early spring (flowering of forsythia) and full spring (apple blossom), started 2 to 3 weeks earlier than normal. During the second third of April, however, a spell of frost brought large damage to the wine and fruit growing agriculture. The first summer day was observed on 5 April, the first hot day as early as 6 April. In contrast to March, which was slightly drier than normal, April and May saw a slight and a marked excess of precipitation, respectively. Averaged over Germany, the total precipitation for spring 2024 was about a quarter higher than normal. However, precipitation remained below normal in Saxony and in parts of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. High precipitation caused enormous flooding in the federal states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate and in Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg during the second third of May and towards the end of the month, respectively. March and May, and thus the whole of spring, saw a slight excess of sunshine, while there was slightly less sunshine than normal in April.\n\nThe nationwide average temperature for Germany was 10.9 °C. Compared to the long-term average over the reference period 1991-2020, spring 2024 was 2 K warmer than normal. When compared to the international climatological reference period 1961-1990, the season was 3.2 K warmer. This makes spring 2024 the warmest spring season on record since measurements began in 1881. At 10.6 °C, the previous warmest spring was in 2007.\n\nAveraged over Germany, the precipitation total measured for spring 2024 was 228 mm, which is 56.7 mm (or 33.1 %) more than the average over the period 1991-2020 and 42.2 mm (or 22.7 %) more than the average over the reference period 1961-1990. This puts spring 2024 at number 9 in the series of wet spring seasons in Germany since 1881.\n\nThe average sunshine duration for the whole of Germany was 487.2 hours (h), which is 34.9 h (or 6.7 %) less than in the reference period 1991-2020 and 20.7 h (or 4.4 %) more than the average over the period 1961-1990. Spring 2024 thus ranks at number 34 of the series of least sunniest spring seasons since 1951, which is in the middle range."
