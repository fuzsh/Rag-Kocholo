Direct accelerometry was performed in children aged 3–6 years, and differences in PA patterns over the course of the week were evaluated. Data were analyzed with gender, BMI, lifestyle, and socioeconomic parameters as covariates.   Methods PA was measured in 119 children by the SensewearPro® accelerometer and analyzed in the 92 (40 girls) that wore it for at least 4 days including one day of the weekend. Median measuring time in this group was 7 consecutive days (median/mean daily measuring time: 23.5 h/d and 21.8 h/d, respectively), corresponding to 834,000 analyzed minutes. PA questionnaires were completed by 103 parents and 87 preschool teachers to collect anthropometric, lifestyle, and socioeconomic data.   Results Median daily PA (MET>3) was 4.3 hours (mean: 4.4 hours). Boys spent an estimated 52 min/week more being very active (MET>6) than girls (95% CI [6, 96] min/week, p = 0.02). PA was lower during the weekend (3.7 h/d) compared to weekdays (4.5 h/d), p = 3×10−6), where a 95% CI for the difference is [0.5, 1.0] h/d. PA levels did not differ between overweight/obese children (median 4.7 h/d) and normal-weight peers (median 4.2 h/d). Daily media consumption increased with decreasing social class on weekdays (p = 0.05) and during the weekend (p = 0.01), but was not related to the amount of daily PA. A multivariate regression with BMI-SDS as independent variable and gender, age, amount of PA>6 MET, parental BMI, media time and socioeconomic status as explanatory variables revealed that only SES had a significant contribution.   Conclusion The negative impact of obesity-promoting factors in older children is rather low for preschoolers, but there is evidently a gradient in PA between weekdays and weekends already in this age group. Weight status of preschoolers is already considerably influenced by SES, but not physical activity levels.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nThe present study has analyzed objectively measured PA data from 92 children aged 3–6 years attending German preschools over a median measuring period of 7 consecutive days and with a median measuring time of 23.5 h/d. Results reveal a significant difference between PA levels during the weekend (3.7 h/d) compared to weekdays (4.5 h/d) in children of this age group.\n\nAveraged median daily PA was 4.3 hours/d (MET>3), and boys were consistently more physically active than girls when performing vigorous activities (MET>6). Objectively measured PA levels were neither related to weight status nor to the number of hours of daily media/computer consumption in this age group.\n\nThe suggested minimum amount of 60 minutes per day for this age group spent at moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was achieved by all children participating in our study when averaging their weekly values. All participating children were recruited from preschools from the Leipzig region, were 95% of 3–6 year old children attend preschools [27]. Thus, we may assume that data obtained from our study cohort resemble the “typical” PA behavior of children of this age group from this region. Several groups have assessed accelerometer-acquired estimates of MVPA in preschool-aged children, and values include 39.5±22.5 min/day (Puyau et al.), 46.8±27.6 min/d (Sirard et al.), 102.2±40.6 (Pate et al.) and 269.0±70.8 min/d (Freedson et al.) [28]. Due to variations in accelerometer cut points for activity levels among available studies regarding PA levels in preschool children, comparisons of accelerometer-derived MVPA estimates across studies remains a challenge [12], [28], [29].\n\nSeveral studies have investigated objectively measured PA in children older than 6 years: A decline in PA, starting at school age (6–9 years), has been described by several groups [3], [4], [15], [25], [30], and PA levels measured by direct accelerometry have been reported to be lower in adolescents compared to school-aged children [31]. Interestingly, PA levels are still appropriately high in children at preschool age, matching or exceeding the recommendations of the scientific associations. Our results confirm and extend these previous observations by showing that PA levels in children aged 3–6 years are appropriately high, but that vigorous PA (MET>6) is already significantly higher in boys than in girls in this age group, although total physical activity (MET>3) is not different between genders. We also show that there are considerable differences in PA levels between weekdays and weekend days. In interpreting these results, cultural aspects in the former East Germany have to be considered: The vast majority of children in the investigated group attend a preschool. Generally, this involves play time outdoors and significant amounts of running around. Our results demonstrate that this level of activity is not maintained by parents on the weekends in general. On the weekend, the children are also likely to be spending less time with outdoor activities with other children of the same age.\n\nThe phenomenon of higher PA levels on weekdays compared to weekends has been previously reported for children older than 6 years, but most of them utilized accelerometer data from≤4 days [3], [30], [32]. Only one study has previously reported a similar pattern of weekday and weekend day variability in preschool-aged children, however, mean duration of monitoring was only 12.5 h/d [33]. Thus, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report differences in objectively measured PA levels over the course of the week in preschool-aged children over a period of 7 consecutive days with a median measuring time of 23.5 hours.\n\nStudies that have investigated PA levels in children younger than 6 years, considering weight status and socioeconomic factors, are limited [12], [34]. SES did not seem to be a significant factor in explaining the amount of time spent in PA or sedentary behavior [34]. However, although SES does not seem to be a predictor of daily physical activity of children in that age group, we show that SES seems to influence weight status already in preschoolers. A recent meta-analysis that has evaluated 29 articles representing 6,309 children aged 3–5 years has shown that children of this age engaged on average in 42.8 min moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, 54.4 min for boys and 45.4 min for girls [12]. Although children of our study group had higher daily values for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, our results confirm the previous findings of boys in this age group being more physically active than girls [12], [16].\n\nThere is still no “gold standard” in defining the different activity levels in childhood and there are considerable variations in accelerometer cut points for activity levels among available studies regarding PA in preschool-aged children [12], [28], [29], [35], [36]. Thus, we had to choose one system based on validated data available in the literature to define the activity levels in our study cohort. We are aware of the fact that this choice can affect results significantly, but we choose values that were established and validated for this age group by Pate et al. and that are widely used by other groups [16], [23]. To validate this model in more detail, we have compared the total energy expenditure estimated using the SenseWear Pro® armband with values published by Reilly et al [37]. The results suggest that the assigned values for METs are reasonably good, but that there is likely even more moderate physical activity than we reported, based on the definitions available in the literature. However, total energy expenditure of our study cohort is comparable to that published by Reilly's group [37]. Since we have analyzed a total of 834,000 minutes, one of the main findings of our study, namely the differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekend days, provide a robust analysis of physical activity patterns during the course of the week and does not seem to be influenced by the chosen cut points or model for activity levels in this age group.\n\nA sub-analysis of our study has compared PA levels in normal-weight and overweight/obese children. Prevalence rates for overweight and obesity in our study population are in accordance with data from the national KIGGS survey [25] and a recent national evaluation [5]. Our results confirm previous findings, as the weight of the children was affected by social status already in this age group, with more overweight/obese children living in families of low social status. Maternal weight status seems to have a significant impact on the weight status of their children. However, this association was not statistically significant in our study.\n\nOur results revealed no significant differences in PA levels among normal-weight and overweight/obese children in this age group. Similar data were presented in a Portuguese study with children of equivalent ages [32]. In contrast, one study in children of similar age showed that age, gender, race, and BMI z-score were correlated to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity in this age group, and several studies performed in older children (>6 years) showed a close and significant relationship between weight status and level of physical activity, with overweight and obese children being significantly less physically active than their normal-weight peers [38]–[40]. Extending these findings in older children, a recent study revealed a close relationship between percent body fat and the level of physical activity, measured as steps per day and moderate and vigorous physical activity in both genders of children aged 8, 10 and 12 years old [41]. The fact that we did not find a correlation between weight status and level of PA in children of this age group leads us to the conclusion that in younger children the natural drive to move is not influenced yet by higher body weight, as it seems to be in older children. Therefore, it is essential to start preventive interventions already at this age. The urgent need for early intervention is underlined by the fact that PA levels seem to decrease from childhood to adolescence, as discussed above. As there are no validated obesity prevention strategies in childhood and adolescence, early identification of potential risk factors are crucial. In adults, the physical activity status of an individual may predict the risk for developing chronic diseases in the future. However, our results suggest that risk prediction for obesity and associated diseases may not be assumed by the level of physical activity in preschool-aged children, but physical activity patterns may be of increasing importance during the course of childhood development [42]. Thus, promotion of physical activity that starts as early in life as possibly may prevent chronic diseases later in life.\n\nAdditional variables that seem to have an impact on the child's PA level include parental level of PA, preschool quality, home PA equipment, and child's enjoyment of PA. Whereas there is a significant relationship between the family support, quality of preschool attended, home PA equipment, child's enjoyment of PA and the daily amount of the child's PA, there does not seem to be a direct relationship between parent's and the child's level of physical activity [43]. In addition, the amount of daily media consumption is assumed to influence physical activity in children [44]. However, our data showed no significant correlation between the hours of daily media consumption and number of hours of daily physical exercise, which is in accordance with a previous study, showing that increased TV viewing is not associated with lower total energy expenditure in children [45]. In our study, TV consumption and computer playtime (including gameboy and playstation) of participating children were evaluated, both, during weekdays and on the weekend, based on parental questionnaires. However, additional factors that might influence sedentary behavior in this age group, such as books, drawing and coloring, playing board games and listening to stories on CD, were not addressed in the parental questionnaires. Neither TV consumption nor playtime on the computer was related to the amount of daily physical activity. The potential effects of the above mentioned additional factors of sedentary behavior, which have not been addressed by the applied questionnaires, cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, media consumption provides only one aspect of an individual's sedentary behavior habits, which are potentially correlated to a variety of factors, including the number of siblings living in the home, parental enjoyment of PA, child's enjoyment of PA, child's athletic coordination compared with peers, distance to the nearest park, and others [46]. These factors have not been considered in the present study, which might as well – at least in part – explain the missing relationship between PA and media consumption in our study cohort.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nThe level of PA in children aged 3–6 years was measured by direct accelerometry over a median of 7 consecutive days. Median daily PA (MET>3) was 4.3 hours, and the suggested minimum amount of PA for this age group of 60 min/d spent at moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was achieved by every child when its values for the week were averaged. Boys were more vigorously active than girls. Daily PA was higher during weekdays compared to weekends in this age group. No external factors or environmental conditions that are known to affect PA of older children, such as BMI or media consumption, influenced activity behavior in preschool-aged children. Our data demonstrate that preschool-aged children seem to be active enough, as suggested by the scientific communities, independent of weight status and TV consumption. However, studies of older children do indicate associations between weight status and both physical activity and TV consumption. Presumably habits are formed at this early age. It may not be as important then to increase the amount of physical activity in preschool-aged children participate in as it is to foster the awareness of its importance and turn it into a regular part of daily habit especially on the weekends. Long-term follow-up studies are necessary to further investigate such questions."
