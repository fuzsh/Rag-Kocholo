        "text": "Solar power accounted for an estimated 10.7% electricity in Germany in 2022, up from 1.9% in 2010 and less than 0.1% in 2000.[3][4][5][6]\n\nGermany has been among the world's top PV installer for several years, with total installed capacity amounting to 81.8 gigawatts (GW) at the end of 2023.[7] Germany's 807 watts of solar PV per capita (2022) is the third highest in the world, behind only Australia and the Netherlands.[8] Germany's official government plans are to continuously increase renewables' contribution to the country's overall electricity consumption; long-term targets are 80% renewable electricity by 2030 and full decarbonization before 2040.[9][10]\n\nConcentrated solar power (CSP), a solar power technology that does not use photovoltaics, has virtually no significance for Germany, as this technology demands much higher solar insolation. There is, however, a 1.5 MW experimental CSP-plant used for on-site engineering purposes rather than for commercial electricity generation, the Jülich Solar Tower owned by the German Aerospace Center. Germany's largest solar farms are located in Meuro, Neuhardenberg, and Templin with capacities over 100 MW.\n\nAccording to the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, in 2022, Germany generated 60.8 TWh from solar power, or 11% of Germany's gross electricity consumption.[11]: 6\n\nThe country is increasingly producing more electricity at specific times with high solar irradiation than it needs, driving down spot-market prices[12] and exporting its surplus of electricity to its neighbouring countries, with a record exported surplus of 34 TWh in 2014.[13] A decline in spot-prices may however raise the electricity prices for retail customers, as the spread of the guaranteed feed-in tariff and spot-price increases as well.[4]: 17 As the combined share of fluctuating wind and solar is approaching 17 per cent on the national electricity mix,[citation needed] other issues are becoming more pressing and others more feasible. These include adapting the electrical grid, constructing new grid-storage capacity, dismantling and altering fossil and nuclear power plants—brown coal and nuclear power are the country's cheapest suppliers of electricity, according to today's calculations—and to construct a new generation of combined heat and power plants.[4]: 7\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPrice of solar PV systems\n\nGermany was one of the first countries to deploy grid-scale PV power. In 2004, Germany was the first country, together with Japan, to reach 1 GW of cumulative installed PV capacity. Since 2004 solar power in Germany has been growing considerably due to the country's feed-in tariffs for renewable energy, which were introduced by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act, and declining PV costs.\n\nPrices of PV systems/solar power system decreased more than 50% in the 5 years since 2006.[15] By 2011, solar PV provided 18 TWh of Germany's electricity, or about 3% of the total.[16] That year the federal government set a target of 66 GW of installed solar PV capacity by 2030,[17] to be reached with an annual increase of 2.5–3.5 GW,[18] and a goal of 80% of electricity from renewable sources by 2050.[19]\n\nMore than 7 GW of PV capacity were installed annually during the record years of 2010, 2011 and 2012. For this period, the installed capacity of 22.5 GW represented almost 30% of the worldwide deployed photovoltaics.\n\nSince 2013, the number of new installations declined significantly due to more restrictive governmental policies.\n\nAbout 1.5 million photovoltaic systems were installed around the country in 2014, ranging from small rooftop systems, to medium commercial and large utility-scale solar parks.[4]: 5\n\nIt's estimated that by 2017 over 70% of the country's jobs in the solar industry have been lost in the solar sector in recent years.[1] Proponents from the PV industry blame the lack of governmental commitment, while others point out the financial burden associated with the fast-paced roll-out of photovoltaics, rendering the transition to renewable energies unsustainable in their view.[16]\n\nA boom in small, residential balcony-mounted solar systems has been reported in the early 2020s.[20][21][22]\n\nGovernmental policies\n\n[edit]\n\nAs of 2012 , the feed-in tariff (FiT) costs about €14 billion (US$18 billion) per year for wind and solar installations. The cost is spread across all rate-payers in a surcharge of 3.6 €ct (4.6 ¢) per kWh[24] (approximately 15% of the total domestic cost of electricity).[25] On the other hand, as expensive peak power plants are displaced, the price at the power exchange is reduced due to the so-called merit order effect.[26] Germany set a world record for solar power production with 25.8 GW produced at midday on 20 and 21 April 2015.[27]\n\nAccording to the solar power industry, a feed-in tariff is the most effective means of developing solar power.[28] It is the same as a power purchase agreement, but is at a much higher rate. As the industry matures, it is reduced and becomes the same as a power purchase agreement. A feed-in tariff allows investors a guaranteed return on investment – a requirement for development. A primary difference between a tax credit and a feed-in tariff is that the cost is borne the year of installation with a tax credit, and is spread out over many years with a feed-in tariff. In both cases the incentive cost is distributed over all consumers. This means that the initial cost is very low for a feed-in tariff and very high for a tax credit. In both cases the learning curve reduces the cost of installation, but is not a large contribution to growth, as grid parity is still always reached.[29]\n\nSince the end of the boom period, national PV market has since declined significantly, due to the amendments in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) that reduced feed-in tariffs and set constraints on utility-scaled installations, limiting their size to no more than 10 kW.[30]\n\nThe previous version of the EEG only guaranteed financial assistance as long as the PV capacity had not yet reached 52 GW. This limit has now been removed. It also foresees to regulate annual PV growth within a range of 2.5 GW to 3.5 GW by adjusting the guaranteed fees accordingly. The legislative reforms stipulates a 40 to 45 per cent share from renewable energy sources by 2025 and a 55 to 60 per cent share by 2035.[31]\n\nAs of November 2016 , tenants in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) will soon be able to benefit from the PV panels mounted on the buildings in which they live. The state government has introduced measures covering the self-consumption of power, allowing tenants to acquire the electricity generated onsite more cheaply than their regular utility contracts stipulate.[32][33]\n\nGrid capacity and stability issues\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2017, approximately 9 GW of photovoltaic plants in Germany were being retrofitted to shut down[34] if the frequency increases to 50.2 Hz, indicating an excess of electricity on the grid. The frequency is unlikely to reach 50.2 Hz during normal operation, but can if Germany is exporting power to countries that suddenly experience a power failure. This leads to a surplus of generation in Germany, that is transferred to rotating load and generation, which causes system frequency to rise. This happened in 2003 and 2006.[35][36][37]\n\nHowever, power failures could not have been caused by photovoltaics in 2006, as solar PV played a negligible role in the German energy mix at that time.[38] In December 2012, the president of Germany's \"Bundesnetzagentur\", the Federal Network Agency, stated that there is \"no indication\", that the switch to renewables is causing more power outages.[39] Amory Lovins from the Rocky Mountain Institute wrote about the German Energiewende in 2013, calling the discussion about grid stability a \"disinformation campaign\".[40]\n\nPotential\n\n[edit]\n\nGermany has about the same solar potential as Alaska, which has an average of 3.08 sun hours/day in Fairbanks.[citation needed]\n\nBremen Sun Hours/day (Avg = 2.92 hrs/day)\n\nStuttgart Sun Hours/day (Avg = 3.33 hrs/day)\n\nSource: NREL, based on an average of 30 years of weather data.[41]\n\nStatistics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe history of Germany's installed photovoltaic capacity, its average power output, produced electricity, and its share in the overall consumed electricity, showed a steady, exponential growth for more than two decades up to about 2012. [dubious – discuss] Solar PV capacity doubled on average every 18 months in this period; an annual growth rate of more than 50 per cent. Since about 2012 growth has slowed down significantly.\n\nGeneration\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Capacity\n\n(MW) Net annual\n\ngeneration\n\n(GWh) % of gross\n\nelectricity\n\nconsumption Capacity\n\nFactor (%) 1990 2 1 2e-04 5.7 1991 2 1 2e-04 5.7 1992 6 4 7e-04 7.6 1993 9 3 6e-04 3.8 1994 12 7 0.001 6.7 1995 18 7 0.001 4.4 1996 28 12 0.002 4.9 1997 42 18 0.003 4.9 1998 54 35 0.006 7.4 1999 70 30 0.005 4.9 2000 114 60 0.01 6.0 2001 176 76 0.013 4.9 2002 296 162 0.028 6.2 2003 435 313 0.052 8.2 2004 1105 557 0.091 5.8 2005 2056 1282 0.21 7.1 2006 2899 2220 0.36 8.7 2007 4170 3075 0.49 8.4 2008 6120 4420 0.72 8.2 2009 10566 6583 1.13 7.1 2010 18006 11729 1.9 7.4 2011 25916 19599 3.23 8.6 2012 34077 26220 4.35 8.8 2013 36710 30020 5.13 9.6 2014 37900 34735 6.08 10.9 2015 39224 37330 6.5 11.3 2016 40679 36820 6.4 10.7 2017 42293 38001 6.6 10.6 2018 45158 43451 7.7 11.6 2019 48864 44334 8.2 11.1 2020 54403 48525 8.9 10.1 2021 60108 48373 8.7 9.1 2022 67399 59596 11.1 10.1\n\nSource: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy, for capacity figures[6]: 7 and other figures.[6]: 16–41\n\nNote: This table does not show net consumption but gross electricity consumption, which includes self-consumption of nuclear and coal-fire power plants.

The southern states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg account for about half of the total, nationwide PV deployment and are also the wealthiest and most populous states after North Rhine-Westphalia. However, photovoltaic installations are widespread throughout the sixteen states and are not limited to the southern region of the country as demonstrated by a watts per capita distribution.\n\nPV capacity in MW[45][46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53] State 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2023\n\n(April) W per\n\ncapita\n\n(2023-4) Baden-Württemberg 1,245 1,772 2,907 3,753 5,838.0 6,111.8 4,984.5 5,117.0 8,809 791 Bavaria 2,359 3,955 6,365 7,961 9,700.5 10,424.7 11,099.8 11,309.2 19,563 1,484 Berlin 11 19 68 50 63.2 68.6 80.5 83.9 215 58 Brandenburg 72 219 638 1,313 2,576.1 2,711.2 2,901.0 2,981.5 5,920 2,332 Bremen 4 5 14 30 32.3 35.3 39.9 42.2 70 103 Hamburg 7 9 27 25 32.1 35.8 36.5 36.9 90 48 Hesse 350 549 868 1,174 1,520.9 1,661.8 1,768.5 1,811.2 3,201 508 Lower Saxony 352 709 1,479 2,051 3,045.1 3,257.4 3,490.6 3,580.4 5,957 742 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 48 88 263 455 957.7 1,098.5 1,337.9 1,414.4 3,519 2,184 North Rhine-Westphalia 617 1,046 1,925 2,601 3,582.0 3,878.5 4,234.9 4,363.7 8,113 452 Rhineland-Palatinate 332 504 841 1,124 1,528.2 1,670.8 1,862.2 1,920.5 3,356 817 Saarland 67 100 158 218 318.8 365.4 407.3 415.8 738 751 Saxony 168 288 529 836 1,280.8 1,412.3 1,575.1 1,607.5 2,995 740 Saxony-Anhalt 94 181 450 817 1,377.9 1,556.1 1,828.7 1,962.6 3,891 1,793 Schleswig-Holstein 159 310 695 992 1,351.5 1,407.8 1,468.6 1,498.3 2,587 885 Thuringia 95 159 327 467 871.7 1,013.9 1,119.9 1,187.4 2,226 1,055 Cumulative total installed 5,979 9,913 17,554 23,866 34,076.7 36,710.1 38,236.0 39,332.4 71,259 856 Capacity added — 3,934 7,641 6,312 10,210.7 2,633.4 1,525.9 1,096.4\n\nPhotovoltaic power stations\n\n[edit]\n\nLargest photovoltaic power stations\n\n[edit]\n\nPV Power station Capacity\n\nin MWp Commissioning Location Notes Witznitz 605 2024 Leipzig [54] Solarpark Weesow-Willmersdorf 187 2020 [55] Solarpark Tramm-Göhten 172 2022 [56] Solarpark Meuro 166 2011/2012 [57] Solarpark Gottesgabe 150 2021 [58] Solarpark Alttrebbin 150 2021 [59] Neuhardenberg Solar Park 145 September 2012 [57][60] Templin Solar Park 128.5 September 2012 [57][61] Solarpark Schornhof 120 2020 [62] Brandenburg-Briest Solarpark 91 December 2011 Solarpark Gaarz 90 2021 [63] Solarpark Finow Tower 84.7 2010/2011 Eggebek Solar Park 83.6 2011 Finsterwalde Solar Park 80.7 2009/2010 [64][65] Solarpark Zietlitz 76 2021 [66] Lieberose Photovoltaic Park 71.8 2009 [67][68] Solarpark Alt Daber 67.8 2011 [57] Solarpark Ganzlin 65 2020 [69] Solarpark Lauterbach 54.7 2022 [70] Strasskirchen Solar Park 54 December 2009 [57] Walddrehna Solar Park 52.3 2012 Waldpolenz Solar Park 52 December 2008 [71][72] Tutow Solar Park 52 2009/2010/2011\n\nLocation map\n\nOther notable photovoltaic stations\n\n[edit]\n\nName & Description Capacity\n\nin MWp Location Annual yield\n\nin MWh Capacity factor Coordinates Erlasee Solar Park, 1408 SOLON 12 Arnstein 14,000 0.13 Gottelborn Solar Park 8.4 Göttelborn n.a. n.a.
