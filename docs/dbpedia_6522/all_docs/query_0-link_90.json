Riggs; Treas.. William Dana i•lelbert: Sec.. Herbert D. Seibert. Addresses of all. Office of Co. The Financial Situation. It will always be a distinctive feature of the Presidential campaign of 1928 that trade and business have proceeded without much regard to it. The seasonal recession, ordinarily characteristic of the summer months, has been almost entirely absent the present year. Particularly is this true regarding the iron and steel industry, accounts concerning which keep steadily growing better, these accounts being especially cheering the current week. Contrary to the contentions of certain commentators who insist that Presidential elections never do have an unsettling effect upon industrial activity, it is necessary to go back only four years, to the Presidential election of 1924, to find an occasion when the pending Presidential campaign exercised a deeply and a highly disturbing effect—when, indeed, an actual slump in business of large proportions occurred. And this slump found its strongest manifestation in the iron and steel trades, which to-day are giving such manifold signs of activity. In 1924 production of steel dropped from 4,187,942 tons in the month of March to only 1,869,416 tons in July (a shrinkage of considerably more than 50%), and 2,541,501 tons in August, and the make of iron fell from 3,466,086 tons in March to 1,784,899 tons in July (also a reduction of almost one-half), and 1,887,145 tons in August, all the months mentioned having contained 26 days. In contrast, note the experience the present year. In March of the current year the output of steel ingots was 4,507,520 tons with 27 working days in the month; in July with only 25 working days in the month, the output was 3,811,573 tons and in August with 27 working days the output was 4,178,481 tons. It will be seen that comparing August with March, both having the NO. 3301. same number of days, the falling off was barely 8%, notwithstanding the heat of the summer, whereas in 1924, as we have seen, the shrinkage between March and July was over 50% and between March and August about 40%. In the case of the production of iron the exhibit is much the same; whereas in 1924 the shrinkage between March and August was about 40%, on the other hand. during the current year there has been scarcely any contraction at all, the make of iron in March 1928 having been 3,199,674 tons and in July and August 3,071,824 tons and 3,136,570 tons respectively. The peculiarly gratifying feature is that during the current month of September-the activity of the months immediately preceding has been fully maintained and even further increased. The trade papers, the present week, speak almost in glowing terms of the state of the steel trade. Thus the \"Iron Age,\" in its issue of Thursday, says that \"the inflow of business in the last month of the current quarter has proved more than enough to sustain a high rate of output—it has resulted in a gain. The operations of the U. S. Steel Corporation plants now average 85% of ingot capacity, compared with 75% a month ago. The rate of a leading independent is 86%. Among the producing districts, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Youngstown alike have increased production, in each case reaching an average of close to 85%.\" It should be added that in September last year, when the seasonal recession was quite pronounced ,the steel mills were engaged to only about 64@66% of capacity. The price situation is also growing more assuring. The \"Iron Age\" says on this point: \"Now that specifying is drawing to a close for those mills that are accepting releases until the end of September, price uncertainty appears to be passing. While many buyers are not yet showing an interest in forward commitments, the number of fourth-quarter contracts so far closed is larger than expected.\" The \"Iron Age's\" composite price for finished steel remains unchanged for the eighth week at 2.348c. a pound. The \"Age's\" composite price for pig iron has advanced for the third consecutive week, now standing at $17.71 a gross ton, within 4c. of the highest level to date in 1928, reached last February. It is worth noting, too, that the railroads which for a dozen months or more have had dwindling traffic and revenues to contend with (as compared with the year immediately preceding) are at last showing signs of recovery in their returns. A rather significant indication in that respect is furnished by the statement of the loading of revenue freight on the railroads of the United States for the week ending Sept. 15. This proves to have been the largest of any week of the year thus far, the number of cars loaded running away in excess of a million, reaching 1714 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE in exact figures 1,138,312 cars. At the figures mentioned,the total shows an increase of 10,669 cars over the number in the corresponding week of 1927, something that has not happened very frequently during 1928, though 40,947 cars below the corresponding week two years ago. The monthly returns of earnings of the railroads of the country for the month of August are also now coming to hand and after a long period of unfavorable comparisons (speaking of the roads as a whole) are likewise revealing improved results—at least more generally so than heretofore. Distinction, however, must be made between the different sections of the country. Not all as yet are able to make a better showing. One group of roads outdistances all other groups in the favorable character of the exhibits made. We refer to the roads and systems traversing the spring wheat territory of the Northwest. There an economic revolution has been effected as the result of two successive extremely bounteous harvests of spring wheat,following a long series of poor or indifferent crop yields. The effect has been, not only to give the favored roads a larger grain tonnage, but also a larger movement of merchandise and general freight owing to the greatly augmented purchasing power of the entire population. The roads in that part of the United States have for many months been giving a good account of themselves as a result of the excellent spring wheat harvest of 1927, standing out in sharp contrast in that respect with the roads in most other parts of the country, which have had falling traffic to contend with, and now that a similar abundant spring wheat crop is assured for 1928, their record of gains is being further extended. Thus the Milwaukee & St. Paul reports for August this year gross earnings of $16,174,739 as against only $14,967,419 in the same month last year and net earnings (above operating expenses, but before the deduction of taxes) of $4,398,503 against $2,748,244. Of course, this road is comparing with its receivership period of a year ago and presumably has had an especial advantage on that account, but improvement is also registered by the other large systems in the same territory, even if not to the same extent. The Chicago & North Western reports for the month gross of $15,084,455 against $14,631,848, with net operating income of $3,623,243 against $3,053,128; the Northern Pacific gross of $9,137,259 against $8,367,550 and net of $2,950,287 against $2,358,199 and the Great Northern gross of $11,723,502 against $11,003,396 and net operating income of $3,381,629 against $3,024,478. The improvement also extends to the roads further south in the western half of the country, and even to those in the Southwest, though in this last instance we find some exceptions to the rule. The Union Pacific reports gross of $21,358,474, against $20,210,546, and net of $7,964,426, against $7,266,868, and the Burlington & Quincy gross of $16,356,129 against $15,184,344, with net operating income of $4,707,669 against 4,106,930. The Atchinson shows gross of $23,264,266 against $21,720,985, and net of $8,767,165 against $7,099,571. The Southern Pacific reports gross of $26,943,892, against $26,962,738, and net of $8,030,934 against $8,341,846. The Missouri Pacific (which suffered very severely a year ago from the overflow of the Mississippi River and its tributaries) has gross of $12,048,118 against $11,020,930, and net of $3,370,463 against $2,936,587; and the St. Louis-San Francisco gross of $8,- [VoL. 127. 018,037 against $8,001,541 and net of $2,289,627 against $2,250,296. Even Southern roads, in a section of the country which has had to contend with severe business depression for about two years, are now in a number of cases beginning to show indications of better results, though Florida roads and some of those connecting with Florida are still falling behind. The Southern Railway reports gross of $12,607,305 against $12,515,316, and net of $3,786,572 against $4,181,583. This is for the Southern Railway proper. For the Southern Railway system the showing is gross of $16,646,397 against $16,501,551, and net of $5,067,454 against $5,402,970. The Louisville & Nashville has gross of $11,560,990 against $13,040,000, with net operating income of $2,005,183 against $2,833,741; and the Atlantic Coast Line gross of $4,625,446 against $5,206,790 and net of $234,793 against $271,436 and the Seaboard Air Line gross of $4,153,972 against $4,487,607, with net operating income of $608,114 against $776,185. The roads serving the Pocahontas coal region of course all make unfavorable comparisons with a year ago, since the district is non-union and coal mining was prosecuted on an unusual scale in 1927 when the union mines throughout the country were closed down owing to the strike. The Chesapeake & Ohio reports for the month this year gross of $11,004,517 against $12,355,229 in the month last year and net of $3,958,747 against $4,664,765. Among the great east and west trunk lines, results are somewhat irregular, depending to some extent upon whether the roads were little or much affected by the strike in 1927 at the unionized bituminous coal mines. In the case of the Pennsylvania RR. system, the feature again is the large reduction in expenses. For the lines directly operated, east and west of Pittsburgh, the showing is gross of $57,416,369 against $58,285,019, but net of $16,622,093 against $15,794,685. The New York Central reports gross of $34,018,396, against $34,415,465 and net of $8,463,025 against $9,127,002; the Baltimore & Ohio gross of $21,709,323 against $22,104,324 and net operating income of $5,955,583 against $5,177,151; the Lehigh Valley gross of $6,527,407 against $7,015,477 and net of $2,056,290 against $1,930,361; and the Erie gross of $9,559,938 against $9,865,923, and net of $2,126,714 against $2,022,110. The Wabash gives an exceptionally good account of itself, with gross of $6,460,981 against $5,841,458 and net of $1,739,152 against $1,417,177. The anthracite carriers all make unfavorable comparisons, due to the falling off in the quantity of anthracite mined. The Reading reports gross of $7,351,585 against $7,945,290 and net of $1,582,625 against $1,968,668; the Lackawanna gross of $6,962,826 against $7,553,240 and net of $2,121,474 against $2,487,392. Brokers' loans again show an increase in this week's Federal Reserve statement, being the fifth successive week of such increases. The increase this time is $54,232,000 and it follows $85,285,000 increase the previous week, $95,982,000 increase two weeks ago, $54,061,000 increase three weeks ago, and $34,017,000 increase four weeks ago, making the total expansion for the five weeks $323,577,000. Such figures speak so eloquently of what is going on in the speculative arena that there is no necessity for enlarging upon them. They furnish an interesting commentary also on the remarks made last week by SEPT. 29 1928.) FINANCIAL CHRONICLE 1715 Roy A.

The German delegate, who spoke after him, made what was described in a dispatch to the New York \"Times,\" as \"an exceedngly careful speech in which he opened up real hostilities to the League program, which will probably not be fully developed until the Council meets next December.\" The chief note of the speech, the report added, was that Germany \"was The Ninth Assembly of the League of Nations con- still ready to collaborate and sitll clung to the hope cluded its deliberations Wednesday and adjourned that the disarmament program would go on.\" Taken shortly after noon on that day with very few accom- as a whole, the speech was said to have sounded plishments to its credit.

The committee was headed by Lord Melchett, formerly Sir Alfred Mond. The report was notable chiefly for its practical and definite suggestions for introducin g modern scientific methods into the coal industry. In a London dispatch to the New York \"Times,\" the report was described as suggesting a greater use of powdered coal on ships in order to restore some of the usefulness of coal which oil and electricity took away, and recommendina a greater use of low-grade fuels and organized research into the production of coke by-products, \"a field in which other natio ns have made more rapid progress than England.\" Reactionary Nationalists in Germany began a campaign Monday against the republican form of Government by demanding a popular refer endum on the question of setting aside the Parliamentary system and bringing back the monarchy in one form or another. The semi-militaristic organization of war veterans, banded together, under the name of the Steel Helmets, was used as the vehicle for bringing the campaign to public notice. A petiti on for a referendum on 'altering the form of the Gover nment was circulated by this group at Magdeburg and the 5,000 signatures necessary for its consid eration by the authorities at Berlin were readily secured. Should the Minister of the'Interior permi t the matter to proceed, the petitioners, under the law, must assemble the signatures of 5,000,000 eligible voters, after which the popular referendum will be called. In the national voting 20,000,000 Germans, or half the voters of the country, would have to regist er their approval, and not even the most optimistic of the Nationalists believe that such widespread approval would be granted. \"Germania,\" itself one of the most reactionary of Berlin journals, said editorially Wednesday \"If the German Natio nal Party wants to expose itself to a sure and painful defeat, it, in company with the Steel Helmet organization, will call the German nation to arms against the Weimar Constitution. After such proce edings they will be wiser than before.\" 1719 theless have been slow. \"The peasants will not part with the grain unless they receive manufactured goods in exchange at a price they consider fair,\" the dispatch added. \"Despite the fact that goods production is almost equivalent to that before the war, both urban. and country demand has so greatly increased and production costs are so high, that it is impossible to supply the peasants,\" it was stated. A detailed review of the Soviet economic situation was made Twesday by M. Quibeshef, President of the Supreme Economic Council, and reported in a dispatch from Walter Duranty, Moscow correspondent of the New York \"Times.\" \"Industrial production is steadily increasing,\" the dispatch said, \"but M. Quibeshef admits that the peasant demand for implements, fertilizers and manufactured goods is increasing faster still. The harvest totals 300,000,000 poods more than last year, but the transport difficulties, especially since the best crop was in Siberia, will hamper its distribution during the coming months. The production of the individual laborer has improved, but the decrease in production costs is less than was planned. The metal and coal industries show a steady growth, but there were heavy losses from faultylabor discipline and absences from work, which generally means drunkenness. In the coming year it is planned to invest upward of 2,000,000,000 rubles, 400,000,000 more than in the current year, in industrial development, but the country is still dependent on foreign importation, which causes currency tension. The Industrial Council recently has been discussing the need for the import of pig iron as well as of machines and manufactures.\" A treaty of friendship and conciliation between Greece and Italy was signed at the Foreign Ministry in Rome last Sunday by Premiers Eleutherios Venizelos and Benito Mussolini. The text of the treaty, as given out on the following day, closely resembles those made by Italy with almost all the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. It lays down rules for the conciliatory settlement of any conflict that may arise between the two countries incapable of settlement by ordinary diplomatic methods and provides for neutrality in the case of a conflict by Faced with the problem of supplying Russi an peas- either party with a third power or powers due to ants with manufactured goods at reaso nable prices, unprovoked aggression. \"This treaty ,\" says a Rome the Soviet Government has been issuing a number of dispatch of Sept. 23 to the New York \"Time s,\" more or less urgent intimations that it would wel- \"crowns the gradual rapprochement betwe en Italy come the return of foreign capital to that country and Greece which has been going on the last practically on capitalist terms.

SEPT. 29 1928.] FINANCIAL CHRONICLE The United States and the Check to Disarmament. It had been generally expected that the ninth Assembly of the League of Nations, which closed its sessions on Wednesday, would fix •a date for the meeting of the Preparatory Commission on Disarmament, and thereby pave the way for an early meeting of an international conference at which definite steps in the direction of disarmament would probably be taken. The Assembly adjourned not only without having taken the action which was expected of it, but with the clear impression among many of its members, as well as among those who had observed its proceedings, that the outlook for any practical agreement about disarmament was even more doubtful than it was when the Assembly convened, and that even the formal harmony among the League members which it has been a constant effort to maintain had been more than ordinarily strained. There is to be, it appears, some kind of informal discussion at Paris over the question of a meeting of the Preparatory Commission, under the direction of its President, Dr. Loudon of The Netherlands. If all goes well, the Commission may be called together early in 1929;; otherwise, apparently, the meeting will be indefinitely deferred. For this untoward outcome of the Assembly's deliberations the primary responsibility is to be found in the secret treaty or agreement between Great Britain and France whose existence was first made publicly known last July. Precisely what the provisions of the treaty are is not yet known, for the text of the treaty has not been published, but there is a general impression that it embodies, in form or spirit, at least two proposals or understandings either of which, if it were to become effective, would render further discussion of disarmament futile. The first is an agreement under which Great Britain, in distributing some agreed global amount of naval tonnage among the various classes of armed vessels, will be free to build as many small cruisers, less than 10,000 tons, as it pleases, while France, which has less need for cruisers, will expand at its discretion its fleet of large submarines. The second is an understanding that Great Britain, in return, for the naval predominance which it will thus enjoy, will make no objection to the continued military predominance of France on the Continent, and will acquiesce in the continuance of the system of compulsory military service by classes as opposed to the system of a volunteer army. Discussion at Geneva brought out the fact that this treaty, far from being the practical step in the direction of armament limitation which British and French spokesmen earnestly represented it to be, was an obvious stumbling-block and a source of widespread suspicion and irritation. To begin with, the treaty represented a return to the methods of secret diplomacy, and while secret diplomacy still has its advocates, its use in this case became justifiably a ground for criticism and alarm. The naval part of the agreement, moreover, ran directly athwart the program of naval limitation which the United States had advocated in the three-Power conference at Geneva, and thereby seemed to array the two leading Powers of Europe in sharp opposition to the United States. On the naval side, the treaty looked very much like an attempt on the part of Great Britain and France to steal a march on the United States by 1725. making an agreement in which it must have been known that the United States would not acquiesce. On the other hand, acceptance by Great Britain of French military hegemony in Europe meant inevitably a powerful stimulus to the system of compulsory military service in other countries than France; and compulsory service, with classes of scores or hundreds of thousands called up for training every year, means, of course, after a few years, a very large body of men with military training potentially available for war. It needed no argument to show that the treaty, whatever its provisions, was not only a striking rejoinder to the Kellogg anti-war treaty which a large number of Powers had just signed and to which the whole world had been invited to adhere, but was in fact a practical negation of the spirit of the Kellogg pact. Geneva and Paris dispatches during the past week have reported a disposition, in certain European political circles, to hold the American Government largely responsible for the Geneva impasse, and to picture the United States in the double role of a world dictator and a kind of dog in the manger. It is not at the doors of the State Department or the White House that responsibility should be sought. The identical notes which Secretary Kellogg transmitted to Great Britain and France on Wednesday, the text of which was made public yesterday, make clear the position of the United States. \"The Government of the United States,\" the note declares, \"feels that no useful purpose would be served by accepting as a basis of discussion the Franco-British proposal.\" It has \"no objection to any agreement between France and Great Britain which those countries think will be to their advantage and in the interest of limitation of armaments, but naturally cannot consent that such an agreement should be applied to the United States.\" That the treaty directly affected the United States was evident, as the note pointed out, from the fact that the naval restrictions embodied in the treaty applied only to types of vessels \"peculiarly suited to the needs of the United States,\" while leaving without limitations types of vessels of greatest use to a nation which,like Great Britain, has widely scattered naval bases and a large merchant marine tonnage. The American note does not, apparently, close the door to another disarmament conference, but the questions with which such a conference would have to deal, if the Anglo-French treaty were taken as the basis for discussion, appear to be so far different from those originally proposed by the United States as to make the success of the Conference doubtful. Until this aspect of the situation has been cleared, Mr. Coolidge will undoubtedly continue to press upon Congress his naval construction program as a reasonable measure of national defense. Now that the United States has made known . its opposition, there are grounds for hoping that the Anglo-French treaty may be scrapped. The secrecy of the treaty has not only put it on the defensive, but a widespread revolt against this method of dealing with a great international interest has now to be reckoned with. The British Government has been subjected for weeks to a heavy fire of criticism in the press, not only for binding Great Britain and France together in the ways which the treaty is believed to provide, but quite as much for having so far bungled the business as to antagonize American opinion. Less circumstantial 1726 FINANCIAL CHRONICLE [VoL. 127. reports tell of a growing political opposition to the to define \"whispering.\" There are several kinds. treaty in France, based in part, it would seem, upon First, there are a few wagging tongues that are the conviction that the treaty will have the effect downright malicious.
