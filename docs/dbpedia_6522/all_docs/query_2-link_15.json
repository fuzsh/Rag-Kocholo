There will be regular breaks, including a one hour lunch break. Your course will include a theoretical part in the morning, course planning in the afternoon and a practical teaching part in the evening.\n\nHow many students can take part in each course?\n\nExpand\n\nThe maximum amount of students in Leipzig is 12. The number of students varies from course to course. Most students are American, Australian, British and Canadian. We also accept non-native speakers\n\nWhat is the teaching practice like?\n\nExpand\n\nDuring teaching practice, you will teach local students. The size and level of the classes vary, but the students are always very enthusiastic. All the students that you teach have volunteered to attend, so you can be sure that they are only coming because they really want to learn English!\n\nWhat is the accommodation like? Where is it located?\n\nExpand\n\nThere is a wide range of accommodation options to choose from in Leipzig. As the city center is only about 20 minutes from the school on foot, you could also stay at one of the many youth hostels or hotels there. The accommodation in Leipzig is normally very clean so the differences in price that you see reflect the size and quality of the room.\n\nWhat is the TEFL job market like in Germany? Will I have trouble finding a job?\n\nExpand\n\nEnglish is very important for business in Germany, so there are many job opportunities. Once you have completed your training, it is fairly easy to find a job with a language school.\n\nWhen and where should I look for work?\n\nExpand\n\nThe earlier you start to look for work, the better. We recommend that you start sending out résumés and organizing interviews around the second or third week of the course.\n\nWhat will you do to help me secure employment?\n\nExpand\n\nWe will give you information to help you with your job search in Germany.

The average rate of pay is around 15-18 EUR per teaching hour. Salaries vary depending on location within Germany, the type of school you work for and whether you have a contract or work as a freelancer. As a contracted trainer, you can expect around 2100-2400 EUR per month (Gross - based on a 40 hour week) for a full-time contract and a minimum of 24 days of paid holiday.\n\nDo schools provide health insurance?\n\nExpand\n\nHealth insurance is mandatory for anyone residing in Germany. As a freelancer, you are responsible for finding and paying for your own health insurance. It is unlikely that your employer will pay for health insurance unless you have a contract.

The focus of the lessons varies depending on the students’ needs and ranges from business and technical English to English for travelling. Schools usually provide information about the students, their needs and the materials they will use. However, teachers are often expected to complement the books with additional materials in order to tailor the lessons to the students’ needs. If you work as a freelancer, you will need to teach at more than one school as this is a requirement for freelancers in Germany.\n\nCan I teach in my own country with my certificate?\n\nExpand\n\nThe TEFL certificate meets international standards and can be used to teach English both nationally and internationally. Please check any local requirements and regulations with your employer.\n\nHow expensive is it to live in Germany?\n\nExpand\n\nYour monthly living expenses depend on where you live in Germany and your lifestyle.

If not, you might consider obtaining an international driving license before coming to Germany, as driving is often an important criteria for language schools when hiring teachers.\n\nWhat’s the climate like? What kind of clothing will I need to bring?\n\nExpand\n\nSpring (March – May): Average temperatures of 10-20oC with some rainy days.\n\nSummer (June – August): Average temperatures of 20-25oC.

The weather is often nice enough that you can go swimming or get out in the sunshine in September too.\n\nWinter (December – February): Average temperatures of 3-4oC.

The roads and footpaths are largely kept clear of snow but there are often icy patches.\n\nSummer is the perfect season to be in Cape Town.
