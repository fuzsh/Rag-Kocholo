He is to train with the rest of the team on Tuesday, the club added.\n\nBayern had made no secret of its admiration for Xavi after he starred for the Netherlands at Euro 2024.\n\n“He has everything, including mentality and character. An exceptionally good player,” Bayern sporting director Christoph Freund said last month.\n\nXavi, who has made 20 appearances for the Netherlands, scored 10 goals and set up 15 more in 43 games for Leipzig last season. The club said he wear the No. 10 for the coming campaign.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nThe Associated Press"
