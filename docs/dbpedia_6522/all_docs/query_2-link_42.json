        "text": "Opened in 1878, Leipzig Zoo is a beloved attraction in the centre of the historic city of Leipzig. This internationally renowned zoo is renowned for its native species conservation practices, its natural surroundings and extensive building projects, including the world's second-largest indoor rainforest. Named Gondwanaland, this massive enclosure brings together 500 plant and 170 animal species from the world’s tropical rainforests in a one-of-a-kind setting. There are also five other themed worlds: Africa, South America, Asia, Pongoland and the Founder’s Garden. In addition to providing unique wildlife viewing, each world also features a themed restaurant, allowing visitors to fully immerse themselves in the international experience. The zoo has something for everyone, with guided tours, playgrounds, boat trips and a petting zoo to ensure even the youngest visitors come away with special memories. How big is Leipzig Zoo, you ask, to offer so much variety? Leipzig Zoo park covers 27 hectares.\n\nThere’s so much to see at Leipzig Zoo that you’ll want to dedicate a full day to exploring every nook and cranny. Wander through the six themed worlds to see over 850 animal species from every corner of the globe. From South African fur seals and Komodo dragons to Europe’s largest individual population of sloth bears, each world unveils a new and beautiful marvel of the animal kingdom.\n\nUpon entering the zoo, you’ll first pass through the Founder’s Garden. This historic area retains some of the zoo's original 19th-century buildings and is the location of the Koala house, the Aquarium, the Terrarium and the Ark Discovery House, a multi-media experience conceived to teach children about species conservation.\n\nHaving undergone an elaborate renovation from 2019 to 2021, the Aquarium is the highlight of the Founder’s Garden and features a wide array of saltwater tanks containing curious tropical creatures, including moon jellyfish, fire eels and weedy scorpionfish. However, the star attraction of the Aquarium is the 360-degree, 11-metre-tall panorama tank which contains cownose rays and hammerhead sharks – visit at 11.30am to catch feeding time.\n\nBegin your trek through the world of Asia in the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas – no hiking boots required. Opened in 2017, this rocky, tundra-like landscape provides a dramatic, wild backdrop for the zoo’s collection of snow leopards, red pandas and Michie’s tufted deer.\n\nNext, wander into the rocky, wooded landscape of Siberia in the zoo’s Tiger Taiga area, home to the endangered Amur (Siberian) tigers and leopards. Watch as these majestic felines roam the grassy embankments, splash in the cool brooks, or simply sun themselves on a rock as content as any house cat. Visit the information point to learn about the conservation of these magnificent animals, which are among the world’s most endangered species.\n\nThe world of Asia also offers walk-in aviaries, a steppe landscape for Przewalski Mongolian wild horses and a ravine filled with sloth bears and Rhesus macaque monkeys. There’s also an Indian temple and bathing pools for the resident Asian elephant population, which includes an underground viewing platform with a transparent wall so you can watch the elephants swimming underwater.\n\nLarger than the size of two football fields is Gondwanaland, the zoo’s innovative indoor rainforest featuring over 24,000 plants and 170 exotic animal species from the continents of Africa, Asia and South America. Meander through the jungle paths on hanging rope bridges, watch a pair of pygmy hippopotami frolic beneath the waterfall or take a boat ride along the indoor river Gamanile as animals such as ocelots, green iguanas and crowned lemurs play among the treetops. The architecture of Gondwanaland is remarkable, with sustainable energy sources powering the enclosure’s heating and irrigation systems.\n\nSet in a massive dome, Pongoland is a unique ape enclosure housing gorillas, bonobos, orangutans and chimpanzees in a tropical setting. Observe the apes playing, foraging and climbing indoors and out as tropical birds fly overhead. Pongoland is also home to the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center, where researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology study the communication, behaviour and perception of our closest relatives. There are also multiple discovery stations around Pongoland for children to conduct their ape research and make discoveries of their own.\n\nThere’s no need to travel all the way to Africa to see the “Big 5” when you can observe them all in the Africa world at Leipzig Zoo. Make your way to the 25,000-square-metre Kiwara Savannah to spot Rothschild giraffes, Grévy's zebras and dwarf flamingos, or head to the Lion Savannah to catch a glimpse of the King of the Jungle. There’s also the rocky Kopje African landscape, home to the zoo’s resident cheetahs and black rhinos.\n\nLeipzig Zoo’s South America world is as wild and varied as the continent itself. From north to south, walk through the landscapes of the Pampas, Pantanal, and Patagonia to see llamas, capybaras and giant anteaters. Next, take the wooden walkway through the enchanting flamingo lagoon, where 120 flamingos splash with ducks, spoonbills and ibises.\n\nEach of the six worlds at Leipzig Zoo provides a culinary adventure of its own. Leipzig Zoo restaurant highlights include the buffet at Kiwara Lodge overlooking the African Savannah, Far East flavours in the Restaurant Patakan in Gondwanaland, the waterfront Pond Cafe in Asia world, or savoury South American specialties at Restaurant Hacienda Las Casas in South America world.\n\nHere are some important details to keep in mind for your zoo visit.\n\nLeipzig Zoo opening hours are from 9am daily, 365 days per year, with closing times varying according to the seasons.\n\nPrices vary depending on the time of year you visit. Zoo entry is free for kids under age 6, and there are also special prices for families, students, persons with disabilities and groups.\n\nFamily amenities such as stroller rentals, nursing areas and baby changing stations are available at various locations throughout the zoo.\n\nThere are two covered parking garages across from the zoo entrance.\n\nLooking for a nearby Leipzig Zoo hotel for the family? ibis Leipzig City and ibis budget Leipzig City are in the lively city centre, under 15 minutes away from the zoo by foot.\n\nLeipzig Zoo has been fascinating families since the 19th century, and it’s the vision of Dr. Jörg Junhold, director of the Leipzig Zoo, that the zoo remains a “successful mix of species protection and science and education with extraordinary experiences for visitors” both now and well into the future."
