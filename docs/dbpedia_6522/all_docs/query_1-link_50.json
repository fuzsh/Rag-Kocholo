        "text": "July 2024\n\nCompared to the international climatological reference periods 1961-1990 and 1991-2020, July 2024 in Germany was slightly warmer and wetter than normal and also saw more sunshine than average. July 2024 thus is the 22nd successive month (since October 2022) that is warmer than normal (1961-1990). Unlike the summer months of previous years, July this year started off with quite moderate temperatures. This was soon followed by a couple of hot days (Tmax >= 30 °C) after the first ten days of the month. The highest temperature so far recorded this year was 35.4 °C, observed in Müllheim on 30 July. Up until now this year, Germany has been spared from prolonged heatwaves. The weather throughout the month was characterised by recurring thunderstorms, partly violent and with copious amounts of rain. While parts of Brandenburg received 100 % more precipitation than normal (compared to 1961-1990), some areas in Saxony recorded a shortfall of 40 % or more. The sun shone for over 250 hours in the east.\n\nThe nationwide average temperature for Germany was 18.8 °C, which is 0.5 K more compared to the long-term average for the reference period 1991-2020 and 1.9 K more for 1961-1990. This makes July 2024 the 20th warmest July in the time series since 1881, together with July 1904.\n\nAveraged over Germany, the monthly precipitation total was 89.2 mm, which is 2.1 mm (or 2.4 %) more than the average over the period 1991-2020 and 11.7 mm (or 15.1 %) more than the average over the reference period 1961-1990. This puts July 2024 at number 67 in the series of wet July months in Germany since 1881, together with 1915.\n\nThe average sunshine duration for the whole of Germany was around 236.5 hours (h), which is 10.8 h (or 4.8 %) more than in the reference period 1991-2020 and 25.7 h (or 12.2 %) more than the 1961-1990 average. This places July 2024 at number 26 among the slightly sunnier July months in the series since 1951."
