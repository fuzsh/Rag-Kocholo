        "meta_description": "Abstract In October 1941, Nazi Germany’s High Command realized that the war against the Soviet Union could not be ended before winter. The German professor Franz Baur prepared a long-range weather forecast for the winter of 1941/42. Baur never revealed anything about this forecast. However, according to an article published 10 years after Baur’s death, Baur predicted that the winter of 1941/42 would be normal or milder than normal, primarily based on the main argument that the previous two winters had been very severe and never in climatic history had more than two severe winters occurred in a row. The winter ended up being one of the worst. Today, Baur’s prognoses from wartime are public. In this article, it is shown that the previous description of Baur’s prognosis for the winter of 1941/42 is incorrect. Baur had a problematic relationship with his colleagues, so it is possible that the story of his prognosis is incorrect due to personal and professional contradictions. Baur’s postulated prognosis for the winter of 1941/42 destroyed his reputation. Based on the original prognoses from wartime and Baur’s scientific and personal history, this article shows that this judgment was too harsh and unfair.",

        "text": "Wartime.\n\nOn 22 June 1941, the Germans began a campaign against the Soviet Union with the aim of ending the campaign before winter. The soldiers therefore had no winter equipment, not even in the depots behind the front. The equipment, e.g., guns, rifles, and tanks, was not suitable for heavy frost and snow, in contrast to the Soviets’ equipment. In the first few months, the campaign went as planned for the Germans, but then came autumn with rain and mud, the time of year that the Germans call Schlamm Periode and the ­Russians more poetically refer to as ­rasputiza (Stahel 2013, p. 95). The ­Germans faced poor ­mobility and were stuck for four weeks (see Fig. 3).\n\nThe High Command realized that the campaign could not be completed before winter; thus, it was important to know how cold the winter would be. According to Neumann and Flohn (1987, p. 621), “Baur was requested by the headquarters (HQ) of the German Air Force to distribute his long-range forecasts to about 25 military offices. A forecast for winter 1941/42 was issued by him, probably at the end of October 1941, based on regional climatology and (supposed) sun-spot-climate relationships. The prediction called for a normal or a mild winter. Baur’s main justification for this rested with the assertation that never in climatic history did more than two severe winters occur in a row. Since both of the preceding two winters, 1939/40 and 1940/41, were severe in Europe, he did not expect that the forthcoming winter would also be severe.” As we all know, the winter of 1941/42 was very harsh, and the German troops suffered greatly (Lejenäs 1989).\n\nFranz Baur did not write anything publicly about his activities during the war. Five years before his death, Baur explained the reason for this (Baur 1972, p. 147): “Only during the ­Second World War did the author [Baur] regularly prepare monthly forecasts, but not ­voluntarily, but on the orders of the High Command of the Air Force and only for this [the High Command] under the express condition that no publication takes place, which hasn’t happened either.” Nor has anyone else written about Baur’s professional wartime activities during his life time. In an article in BAMS by Pauls Putnins on the occasion of Baur’s eightieth birthday in 1967, there is no mention of Baur’s work during the war (Putnins 1967, p. 408). However, in the necrology in BAMS, Landsberg (1978, p. 310) wrote slightly more: “No documentation or reliable information exists on the role Baur played in forecasting weather for campaigns, but rumors to that effect persisted. Particularly tragic was a controversy swirling around Baur and his most eminent scientific collaborator, Dr. Horst Philipps.” The incident with Philipps will be commented on later. Here, it is important to note that it was not until 10 years after Baur’s death that significant new information, perhaps the “rumors,” was published in the article by Neumann and Flohn (1987). Their description of Baur’s wartime activities has no references to original archival material and is probably largely based on Flohn’s memoirs from his years in the weather service. Flohn’s memories are not in favor of Baur’s reputation, which thus suffered a major blow 10 years after his death. To date, the description by Neumann and Flohn has been the “authorized” source on Baur’s wartime activities. The article has been referenced in professional contexts (M. Teich 1993, unpublished manuscript, p. 684; ­Rasmussen 2010, p. 322) and by the press on Baur’s 125th birthday (Frey 2012, p. 62). Frey even wrote, “It was his most famous—and probably the most famous wrong prognosis of all time.”\n\nToday, Baur’s original prognosis for the winter of 1941/42 is publicly available at the ­German Meteorological Library at the DWD, in addition to 83 other long-range weather forecasts prepared by Baur from February 1940 to November 1943, totaling 765 pages. The material includes general monthly and seasonal prognoses for large parts of Europe, as well as prognoses for special areas, for instance, in September 1940 for England and the English Channel. For the present analysis, four prognoses are especially interesting: the prognoses for the winters of 1940/41, 1941/42, 1942/43, and 1943/44 (Baur 1940, 1941, 1942a,b, 1943).\n\nThe content of Neumann and Flohn’s article differs somewhat from the content of the archival material found, as will be documented. At the top of the cover of the prognosis for the winter of 1941/42 (Baur 1941), the red-stamped word “Secret” has been crossed out and replaced with “For official use only.” It has not been possible to clarify when this change occurred and on which date Baur’s wartime prognoses were made publicly available (D. Wintergerst, Bundesarchiv, Abteilung Militärarchiv, 2022, personal communication). The other text on the front page reads, “Temperature forecast for the winter of 1941/42 (with three supplements) edited in the Research Institute for Long-Term Weather Forecasting under the direction of Prof. Dr. Franz Baur. 21. Copy.” This is followed by two pages with the forecast itself and three pages with figures. The forecast is signed, “Bad Homburg, 5. November 1941, F. Baur.” The date 5 November is one month later than remembered by Flohn. As Baur made a new forecast at the end of every month, either for the next month or the next season (three months), it is understandable if Flohn remembered the date ­incorrectly. The number of copies, 21, is consistent with Flohn’s indication that the forecasts were circulated to 25 services.\n\nThe main part of Baur’s long-range forecast regarding the Eastern Front reads (the underscores are Baur’s): “On average in terms of time and space the winter will neither in Western and Central Europe nor in Northern and Eastern Europe be severe. In particular, for Northern and Eastern Europe, the probability that the average temperature of winter is above the normal value is greater than the probability of a winter that is too cold.” Figure 3 in the appendixes to the forecast (Baur 1941, p. 5) shows that the probability of a milder winter than normal ranges from approximately 0.5 in Central Europe to above 0.8 around Moscow. This means, on the other hand, that the probability for a winter colder than normal was estimated to be less than 0.2 around Moscow. This prognosis is not inconsistent with “a normal or a mild winter,” as stated by Neumann and Flohn. However, they did not mention Baur’s reservations related to the probability calculations.\n\nThe three main justifications for Baur’s forecast were as follows (Baur 1941, 2–3):\n\n1)“a special procedure based on multi-year rhythms”\n\n2)“that in the last 110 years after Octobers, which—like X in 1941—were more than 10°C too cold in Central Russia, November and December were often too cold, but in 2/3 of all cases the winter (December, January, February) as a whole was warmer than normal both in Russia and in Central Europe”\n\n3)“The overall development of large-scale weather in late summer and autumn was broadly similar in 1941 to that of 1890”\n\nPoint 1 has no counterpart in Flohn’s list of Baur’s justifications. Today, the rhythm theory (some kind of periodicities) is abandoned, while the influence of sunspots is still under debate. It seems likely that, so many years after the war, Flohn mistakenly confused these two controversial methods. Flohn’s use of parentheses “(supposed) sun-spot-climate relationships,” implies that he was not in favor of this theory.\n\nPoint 2 was based on 110 years of statistics on the dependence of winter temperatures on autumn temperatures. This is not the same as analyzing the dependence of winter temperatures on the winter temperatures in preceding years as postulated by Flohn. The sentence “but in 2/3 of all cases” in Baur’s argumentation is far from the phrase “never in climatic ­history” used by Flohn. It is possible that Baur conducted a further investigation of consecutive ­winter temperatures that was not recorded. A year before, he did use such an analysis—among several other analyses—to conclude, “Will the coming winter [i.e., 1940/41] in the middle of Europe again be so severe as the last one? This question can be answered with a completely no” (Baur 1940, p. 2). He again returned to such methods in the prognoses for 1942/43 (Baur 1942a,b). The appendix shows that the winter temperature in Central Europe is independent of temperatures in the preceding winters.\n\nPoint 3 seems to be what Flohn called “regional climatology.” Such a comparison with older observations corresponds to the analog method used intensely by Krick. Here, there seems to be no discrepancy between the two sources.\n\nIt may be concluded that Neumann and Flohn’s description of Baur’s long-range forecast for the winter of 1941/42 is incorrect. He was not so definitive in his forecast as reproduced by Neumann and Flohn, and his argumentation rested only partially on the methods stated by Neumann and Flohn.\n\nIn early December 1941, the weather suddenly turned unusually cold (see Fig. 4), which led to the following strange episode (Neumann and Flohn 1987, p. 622): “On or about 8 December, K. Diesing, chief of the CWG and scientific adviser to the chief of the weather service of the Air Force (General Spang), asked Flohn to listen in on a second earphone to a telephone call to Baur. In the call, Diesing cited to Baur the reports of very low temperatures in the East and asked him if he maintained his seasonal forecast in face of the reports. Baur’s response was ‘the observations must be wrong.’ This reply of Baur’s greatly impaired the esteem held for him by his colleagues.” The CWG was the Central Weather Group [Zentrale Wetterdienstgruppe (ZWG)]. According to Flohn (1992, p. 49), Diesing and Flohn stared at each other in dismay. As already documented about the winter 1940/41 prognosis, there are some discrepancies between the archival material and the description based on Flohn’s memories. Therefore, the record of the telephone conversation has to be handled with some reservation. It is not clear from Flohn’s memoir whether Baur was challenged in his response. However, it would have been natural to discuss the response in more detail. Nor is it apparent from Flohn’s memoirs whether Baur was aware that Flohn was listening. If Baur were, then we would have had a situation where the 54-yr-old professor was called to account in front of Diesing and Flohn, the latter his 25-yr-younger former student. It would hardly have been a pleasant situation for the former imperial captain. It seems very human that Baur became a little stubborn and maintained his prognosis. Or was the answer in fact meant to be sarcastic? If he meant that a few measurements in early December could not overturn his long-range forecast for the whole winter of 1941/42, then that was logical enough from the point of view of the forecasting methods he had developed. About 10 years later, he writes—without any reference to the 1941 forecast—that a winter predicted to be warmer than usual could naturally include a very cold month. “But only one such month can be involved since we know that the average temperature of the whole winter is above normal” (Baur 1951, p. 325). Perhaps he believed so much in his forecast in 1941 that he thought that an unusually cold December would result in even higher temperatures in January and February. That he still argued for such a view on a general level 10 years later is surprising.\n\nAttempts to present other more pessimistic forecasts to Hitler were halted, including by Göring, who stated that “in Russia it will never be colder than minus 15 degrees” (Neumann and Flohn 1987, p. 626). After a conference on 7 December 1941 about the weather situation in the East, Hitler repeatedly said, “If I had known this before” (Neumann and Flohn 1987, p. 627). It was a complete abdication of responsibility because an army should never be sent into Russia without solid winter equipment, regardless of optimistic or pessimistic weather forecasts. Hitler knew, however, that things could go terribly wrong, as happened for Napoleon in 1812 (see Fig. 5). Hitler therefore forbade all mention of Napoleon’s failed campaign and the terrible winter that cost the lives of so many soldiers (Neumann and Flohn 1987, p. 625).\n\nA different potential explanation of Baur’s inaccurate prognosis is that Baur was so much opposed to the Nazi regime that he deliberately presented a prognosis that would lead the German armies into misfortune. That he was against the regime appears in the interview with Flohn (1992, p. 21). Flohn was an active meteorologist during the war, and the interviewer asked if there were regime opponents among the many meteorologists. Apart from a few Jews who had escaped before the war (including Helmut Landsberg), Flohn could only remember two: Horst Philipps and Franz Baur. However, their opposition had vastly different backgrounds: Philipps was strongly left wing, while Baur was grounded in the imperial, right-wing officer environment, in which there were many opponents of the Nazis. Philipps and Baur had worked together but came into conflict in 1941. The conflict led to Philipps’s dismissal. After the war, Baur was held accountable for this incident by a so-called denazification court (Landsberg 1978, p. 310). He was acquitted but fined for his membership in a Nazi organization. Although Baur may have been skeptical of the Nazi regime, it seems unlikely that, as a former officer and an ambitious long-range weather forecaster, he would have deliberately produced an erroneous forecast leading German soldiers into misfortune.\n\nDiesing died in June 1943 and was succeeded by Werner Schwerdtfeger as head of ZWG. After Schwerdtfeger’s death in 1985, his relatives found a description of an episode he had written a year before he died, which Neumann and Flohn (1987, p. 622) summarized and commented on as follows: “during the summer of 1942 the field HQ Hitler requested a forecast of temperatures in Eastern and Central Europe during the winter of 1942/43 and that, in turn, Diesing asked Baur to prepare the forecast. According to Schwerdtfeger, Baur’s long-range forecast was that the coming winter would not be cold, since the preceding three winters, and particularly two of the three were rather cold; a sequence of four cold winters in a row has never been seen in the 150-yr-long series on hand. Schwerdtfeger adds that the winter of 1942/43 turned out much below normal and that the failure of the prediction and the suffering caused to the troops impaired the reputation of meteorologists in the eyes of many a military leader.” But here Flohn defended his old master (Neumann and Flohn 1987, p. 622). Flohn himself was at ZWG in 1942, unlike Schwerdtfeger, who first came in September 1943. Flohn did not remember that Baur was asked again. Flohn believed that Schwerdtfeger simply remembered wrong so many years after the war and “projected” the forecast for the winter of 1941/42 to the following winter.\n\nBaur was not “asked” by Diesing to deliver a prognosis. As already stated, he had to prepare a new prognosis every month on a routine basis. However, Schwerdtfeger was not completely wrong about Baur’s arguments. In the summary of the long-range weather forecast for the winter 1942/43, Baur wrote (Baur 1942b, p. 2), “It can be considered practically certain that the winter of 1942/43 will not be as severe in Central Europe or Eastern Europe as the winters of 1939/40 and 1941/42.” The arguments for this were, among others, related to sunspots, periodic processes, correlation analyses, and to the temperatures of the preceding winters, a method Baur had already used in 1940 (appendix). This time, Baur’s prognosis was correct, as the winter of 1942/43 was not colder than normal, particularly compared with the previous winter."
