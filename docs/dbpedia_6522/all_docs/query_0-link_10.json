Impact of Co-Occurring Cytogenetic Abnormalities on Transplant Outcome of TP53 Mutant Acute Myeloid Leukaemia: Report From The ALWP of The EBMT\n\nJustin Loke1, Myriam Labopin2, Charles Craddock1, Jan J Cornelissen3, Hélène Labussière-Wallet4, Eva Maria Wagner-Drouet5, Gwendolyn Van Gorkom6, Nicolaas Schaap7, Nicolaus Kröger8, Joan Hendrik Veelken9, Montserrat Rovira10, Herve Tilly11, Hans Martin12, Gesine Bug12, Ali Bazarbachi13, Sebastian Giebel14, Eolia Brissot2, Arnon Nagler15, Jordi Esteve10, Mohamad Mohty2\n\n1 Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom, 2 Hospital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France, 3 Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 4 Hopital Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France, 5 University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany, 6 University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, Netherlands, 7 Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands, 8 University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, 9 Leiden University Hospital, Leiden, Netherlands, 10 Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, 11 Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France, 12 Goethe-Universitaet, Frankfurt Main, Germany, 13 American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon, 14 Maria Sklodowsk-Curie Memorial Cancer Centre & Institute of Oncology, Gliwice, Poland, 15 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel\n\nBackground: The presence of a TP53 mutation in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) has been reported to be associated with an adverse outcome after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). However, the determinants of transplant outcome in patients with mutant TP53 AML have not been studied in a large patient cohort.\n\nMethods: We analysed the outcomes of patients with AML, who had intermediate or adverse risk cytogenetic abnormalities, who received an allo-SCT in CR1 between 2015-2019, according to their TP53 mutation status. Patients were only included in this analysis if their TP53 mutation status was reported to the EBMT registry. There was no restriction to inclusion with regards to age, conditioning intensity or donor source.\n\nResults: We identified 179 patients with AML with mutated TP53 and compared them to 601 patients with AML without TP53 mutations. We identified a statistically significant enrichment of chromosomal losses in 17p (31% vs. 3%), 5q (49% vs. 5%), and 7q (34% vs. 8%) as well as complex (65% vs. 12%) and monosomal karyotypes (41% vs. 8%) in the cohort of patients with mutated TP53, in comparison to those without. The overall survival (OS) at 2 years in patients with mutated TP53 was significantly lower than in the cohort without (mutated TP53, 35.1% [95% CI: 26.7-43.7]; without TP53 mutations, 64% [95%CI:59.1-68.4], p = 0.001). This was due to a cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 2 years in patients with mutated TP53 which was significantly higher than in the cohort without (mutated TP53, 55% [95%CI:45.2-63.8]; without TP53 mutations, 25.2% [95%CI:21.2-29.3], p = 0.001). The adverse prognostic impact of TP53 mutations on OS and CIR remained significant in a multivariate analysis that accounted for other adverse prognostic variables. Neither differences in conditioning intensity, nor GVHD prophylaxis impacted on outcomes in patients with mutated TP53 AML. However, in this cohort further prognostic discrimination was provided by the presence of either 17p abnormalities (abn17p) or complex karyotype (CK). In patients with mutated TP53 AML without abn17p or CK the 2-year OS was 65.2% [95%CI:48.4-77.6], in comparison, patients with mutated TP53 AML with either abn17p or CK, the OS was significantly lower, 24.6% [95%CI:16.2-34], p = 0.001) (figure). The adverse effect of abn17p and CK on the OS of patients with mutated TP53 AML was retained in a multivariate analysis. In patients with mutated TP53 AML, without abn17p or CK, the CIR was 27.5% [95%CI:13.4-43.7], compared with a CIR of 65.4% ([95%CI:53.9-74.8], p = 0.001) in patients with mutant TP53 AML with either abn17p or CK.\n\nConclusions: Our data are practice informing and assist in both risk stratification of patients allografted for mutated TP53 AML and in identification of patients likely to benefit from transplant. The adverse prognostic effect of this mutation is only evident in patients with co-occurring abn17p or CK. Even in patients with mutated TP53 AML and a co-occurring abn17p or CK, a significant proportion of patients achieved long-term survival. The frequent co-occurrence of abn17p with TP53 mutations, alongside their additive poor prognostic implication, underlines the biological importance of biallelic loss of TP53 activity in AML.\n\nDisclosure: There are no conflicts of interest to declare.\n\nO011. Impact of Cytogenetic Classification in ALLO-HCT in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia Secondary to Myelodysplastic Syndrome: A Join Study by The ALWP and The CMWP\n\nEolia Brissot1, Myriam Labopin2, Arnold Ganser3, Johan Maertens4, Matthias Stelljes5, Dietrich Beelen6, Nicolaus Kröger7, Jean-Henri Bourhis8, Didier Blaise9, Adrian Bloor10, Jürgen Finke11, Riitta Niittyvuopio12, Gerard.G. wulf13, Hélène Labussière14, Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha15, Arnon Nagler16, Jordi Esteve17, Mohamad Mohty1\n\n1 Hôpital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne University, Paris, France, 2 ALWP, Paris, France, 3 Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany, 4 University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, 5 University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany, 6 University Hospital, Essen, Germany, 7 Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany, 8 Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Paris, France, 9 Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France, 10 CHU Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France, 11 Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany, 12 HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Hensinski, Finland, 13 Clinic for Hematology and Medical Oncology, Georg-August University, Göttingen, Germany, 14 Hôpital Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Bénite, Lyon, France, 15 CHU de Lille, Univ Lille, INSERM U1286, Infinite, Lille, France, 16 Hematology Division and BMT, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, 17 Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain\n\nBackground: Acute myeloid leukemia with prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome (sAML-MDS) represents an identified subgroup of AML within the ELN (European LeukemiaNet) classification. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) represents the only curative treatment for these patients. The cytogenetic pathophysiological continuum between MDS and sAML-MDS prompted us to investigate, in sAML-MDS allo-HCT patients, the prognostic impact of cytogenetics by comparing the MDS Cytogenetic Scoring System (R-IPSS) (Greenberg et al, Blood 2012)) and the ELN classification (Döhner et al, Blood 2017).\n\nMethods: All patients in this retrospective study fulfilled the following criteria: age ≥ 18 years; diagnosed with sAML-MDS and undergoing first allo-HCT in first complete remission (CR1); from a MSD (matched sibling donor) or UD (unrelated donor). Graft source was peripheral blood (PBSC) or bone marrow (BM). All patients underwent transplantation between January 2000 and December 2018. Genetic risk groups were classified, at transplant, according to both R-IPSS and ELN cytogenetic classifications. For the analysis, the R-IPSS was changed to 3 grades by pooling “very good” and “good” groups into a single “good” group, while “poor” and “very poor” groups formed a single “adverse” group. Endpoints of the study were leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), refined GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (RI), non-relapse mortality (NRM), cumulative incidence of acute GVHD (aGVHD) grade II-IV and chronic GVHD (cGVHD).\n\nResults: Overall, 1030 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up period was 36.5 (IQR 15.4-78.6) months. The 2 year-probability of LFS and OS was 48.1% (95%CI: 44.7-51.4) and 55.4% (95% CI: 52.1-58.7), respectively. The 2-year RI was 33.3% (95% CI: 30.2-36.4. In multivariate analysis, cytogenetic risk was a major prognostic factor for LFS, OS and RI. The R-IPSS was more selective than the ELN classification and was able to discriminate significantly between the good, intermediate, and adverse groups. Incremental age (per 10 year) and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen were associated with lower LFS. Transplant with a UD was associated with lower RI and, as expected, RIC was associated with higher RI. NRM at 2 years was 18.6% (95% CI: 16.2- 21.2); incremental age (per 10 year) was the only risk factor associated with higher NRM. At 180 days, CI of aGVHD grade II-IV was 23.9% and grade III-IV was 8.3%. In multivariate analysis, two factors were associated with higher aGVHD grade II-IV: transplant with a UD and female donor to a male recipient. A RIC regimen was associated with lower aGVHD grade II-IV. The 2-year chronic GVHD CI was 38.1% and extensive GVHD CI was 14.2%. In multivariate analysis, the two prognostic factors associated with higher cGVHD were year of transplant and female donor to male recipient. In vivo T cell depletion was associated with lower extensive cGVHD.\n\nConclusions: Cytogenetics is a major prognostic factor for sAML-MDS patients undergoing allo-HCT. Using the R-IPSS cytogenetic classification to evaluate prognosis in this subtype of high-risk patients was more discriminative than the ELN classification.\n\nDisclosure: The authors have no disclosure.\n\nO012. Trends And Predictive Factors for Outcome of Relapsed Philadelphia Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantion: Improvement of Survival in Recent Years\n\nAli Bazarbachi1, Myriam Labopin2, Mahmoud Aljurf3, Riitta Niittyvuopio4, Hélène Labussière-Wallet5, Didier Blaise6, Ibrahim Yakoub-Agha7, Anna Grassi8, Christian Reinhardt9, Stig Lenhoff10, Pavel Jindra11, Jakob Passweg12, Iman Abou dalle1, Michael Stadler13, Bruno Lioure14, Patrice Ceballos15, Eolia Brissot16, Sebastian Giebel17, Arnon Nagler18, Christoph Schmid19, Mohamad Mohty2\n\n1 American University of Beirut Medical Center, Beirut, Lebanon, 2 Hôpital Saint Antoine, APHP, UMR-S938, Paris, France, 3 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre Oncology (Section of Adult Haematolgy/BMT), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 4 HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Helsinki, Finland, 5 Hopital Lyon Sud, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Bénite, France, 6 Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancérologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France, 7 CHU de Lille, Univ Lille, INSERM U 1286, Infinite, Lille, France, 8 Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Bergamo, Italy, 9 University Hospital, Essen, Germany, 10 Skanes University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, 11 Charles University Hospital, Pilsen, Czech Republic, 12 University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, 13 Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany, 14 Nouvel Hopital Civil, Strasbourg, France, 15 CHU Lapeyronie, Montpellier, France, 16 Service d’Hématologie Clinique et de Thérapie Cellulaire, Hôpital Saint Antoine, APHP, UMR-S938, Paris, France, 17 Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute, Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, Wybrzeze Armii Kr, Gliwice, Poland, 18 Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel, 19 Universitätsklinikum Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany\n\nBackground: Despite the increasing use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) remains an important and potentially curative treatment modality for patients with Philadelphia positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first complete remission (CR1). However, patients who progress after allo-HCT were historically reported to have a dismal prognosis and a short survival. Standard treatment modalities for this indication include reduction/withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy, chemotherapy, TKI, donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), a second allo-HCT or even palliative care. More recently, monoclonal antibodies such as blinatumomab and inotuzumab as well as CAR-T cells have been introduced in that setting. However, little information is available about the global impact of the current standard of care for relapsed Ph+ ALL after allo-HCT and about the predictive factors for outcome.\n\nMethods: We compared outcomes at EBMT participating centers of 899 adult patients with Ph+ ALL who relapsed between 2000 and 2019 after allo-HCT performed in CR1. We included patients who received transplants from matched sibling donors (MSD) or matched unrelated donors (MUD). Median follow up for alive patients was 56 months.\n\nResults: Median age at transplant and at relapse was 44 and 45.4 years, respectively. Overall, 116 patients relapsed between 2000-2004, 225 between 2005-2009, 294 between 2010-2014, and 264 between 2015-2019. Patient and transplant characteristics were similar over the 4 time periods except for a progressive increase in the use of MUD (from 34.5% between 2000-2004 to 55.7% between 2015-2019; p = 0.0002), peripheral blood stem cells (from 60.3% to 84.5%; p < 0.0001), reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) (from 16.4% to 34.5%; p = 0.004), and in vivo T cell depletion (TCD) (from 27.9% to 62.4%; p = 0.0001) as well as a progressive decrease in the use of total body irradiation (TBI) (from 73.3% to 53%; p = 0.0002), respectively. The 2-year overall survival (OS) after relapse was 41.5 % (95% CI: 38 - 44.9). Original disease was the cause of death in 68.5% of patients. Importantly, the 2-year OS after relapse increased from 27.8% for patients relapsing between 2000-2004 to 31.7% for 2005-2009, 44.5% for 2010-2014 and 54.8% for 2015-2019 (p = 0.001) (Figure 1). A second allo-HCT within 2 years after relapse was performed in 13.9% of patients resulting in a 2-year OS of 35.9%. The incidence of second allo-HCT was 21.7%, 12.8%, 9.9% and 15.7% for the same time periods (p = 0.027). In multivariate analysis, OS from relapse was positively affected by an increased time from transplant to relapse above the median of 7.1 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71; p = 0.0007) and the year of relapse (reference 2000-2004; HR 0.68, p < 0.013 for patients relapsing from 2005-2009; HR 0.72; p < 0.008 for patients relapsing from 2010-2014, and HR = 0.72; p = 0.016 for patients relapsing from 2015-2019). Other patient, donor and transplant characteristics had no significant effect on outcomes.\n\nConclusions: We observe a major progressive improvement in OS from post-transplant relapse for patients with Ph+ -ALL, likely reflecting the efficacy of post-transplant salvage. These large-scale real-world data can serve as a benchmark for future studies in this setting.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nDisclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nO013.

Median follow-up was 2 years. There was no difference between the two groups, except dCBT recipients were transplanted less recently (p < 0.01) using reduced-intensity-conditioning (RIC) regimen (p < 0.01). Diagnosis was AML in 72% of cases and majority of patients (67%) were transplanted in first complete remission (CR1). Conditioning regimen varied according to type of donor; in dCBT, total-body-irradiation (TBI) with fludarabine-cyclophosphamide was used in 95% of RIC and 87% of myeloablative conditioning (MAC) respectively, while in Haplo-HCT busulfan-thiotepa-fludarabine was used in 38% of RIC and 34% of MAC. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was antithymocyte-globulin(ATG) free, cyclosporine-A (CSA) and mycophenolate-mofetil (MMF) was reported in 88% of dCBT while Haplo-HCT received PT-Cy mainly with CSA+MMF (53%) or with MMF+tacrolimus (29.6%).\n\nCumulative incidence function (CIF) of 60-days neutrophil-recovery was 93% (95%CI 89-96) and 95% (95%CI 93-97) for dCBT and Haplo-HCT. Day-100 CIF of grade II-IV acute-GVHD was 36% for Haplo-HCT and 42% for dCBT, p = 0.051, with no significant difference for grade III-IV aGVHD, p = 0.16. The 2-year CIF of chronic-GVHD was 35% and 29% for Haplo-HCT vs dCBT, p = 0.16. In the multivariate analysis (MVA) no factors were significantly associated with the risk of acute or chronic GVHD, dCBT recipients had a lower risk of extensive chronic GVHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.47, p = 0.03) compared to haplo-HCT. The CIF of 2-year relapse was 20% in both donor groups, while 2-year NRM was 21.9% (95%CI 17-28) and 24% (95%CI 21-27), p = 0.66, for dCBT and Haplo-HCT, respectively. Diagnosis of ALL in CR2 was the only factor independently associated with relapse incidence in MVA (ALL in CR2, HR 2.09 (95%CI 1.77-3.48, p < 0.01) as compared with AML in CR1, CR2 or ALL in CR1. Disease status was also associated with NRM (AML in CR2, HR 1.56 (95% CI1.1-2.2), p = 0.01; ALL in CR2, HR 2.82 (95%CI 1.75-4.54), p < 0.01), as well as older age (HR 1.26 (95%CI 1.13-1.42), p < 0.01).\n\nTwo-year leukemia-free-survival (LFS) was 58% and 56%, p = 0.92, for dCBT and haplo-HCT, respectively. LFS was 51.7% for ALL and 58.3% for AML (p = 0.03), and 59.3% vs 50.3% for CR1 and CR2 (p < 0.01), respectively. In MVA, older age at HCT (HR 1.1 (95%CI 1.01-1.19), p = 0.03), and ALL transplanted in CR2 (HR 2.48 (95%CI 1.77-3.48), p < 0.01) were associated with reduced LFS. Donor type was not associated with OS (HR 0.97 (95%CI 0.71-1.34), p = 0.87) or with LFS (HR 0.97 (95%CI 0.72-1.30), p = 0.83).\n\nConclusions: Our results show comparable outcomes among Haplo-HCT PBSC with PT-Cy and dCBT in patients with acute leukemia in CR1 and CR2. Results were not different for AML and ALL. Age and disease status remain the most important prognostic factors for outcome.\n\nDisclosure: The authors declare no COI.\n\nO014.

Less is known about its value in pts with primary refractory or relapsed (Rel-Ref) AML undergoing HaploSCT.\n\nMethods: Study aim was to investigate the impact of cytogenetic risk (defined by the Medical Research Council as intermediate or adverse risk group) in adult pts (≥18 years) with de novo AML undergoing first HaploSCT with Rel-Ref AML (>5% of residual morphologic blasts) in 2006-2019, using the EBMT/ALWP registry. Multivariate analysis (MVA) adjusting for differences between the groups was performed using Cox’s proportional hazards regression model for main outcomes.\n\nResults: 460 pts were included: 299 (65%) with intermediate risk and 161 (35%) with adverse risk cytogenetics. Median F/U was 24 (20-38) and 37 [34-56] months, respectively (p = 0.64). Median age was 53.5 (18.1-77.8) and 54.3 (19.4-74) y (p = 0.51), respectively. 52.8% and 57.8% were male (p = 0.31). Pre-HaploSCT disease status was Rel 1/2 in 53.8% and 28.6% and Ref in 46.2% and 71.4% of the pts, respectively (p < 0.0001). Conditioning was myeloablative in 40.6% and 34%, respectively (p = 0.22). Graft sources were peripheral blood in 69.9% and 69.6% of transplants, respectively. Karnofsky performance score was > 90 in 52.8% and 57.3% of pts (p = 0.37), respectively. The most frequent GVHD prophylaxis was post-transplant cyclophosphamide in 74.9% and 72.7%, respectively (p = 0.73). Engraftment was achieved by 91% and 92.3% of pts respectively, (p = 0.64). Day 180 incidence of acute (a) GVHD II-IV and III-IV was 30.0% and 32.6% (p = 0.51); 15.4% and 11.3 % (p = 0.3) and 2-year total and extensive chronic (c) GVHD was 22.3% and 15.3 % (p = 0.09), 11.1% and 6.6% (p = 0.04), respectively. Complete response (CR) was achieved by 76.3% and 71.9% of intermediate and adverse risk groups respectively (p = 0.32). Two-year relapse rate was inferior while leukemia free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were superior for pts with intermediate vs poor risk cytogenetics, 46.6% vs 65.9% (p = 0.001), 28.3% vs 12.9% (p = 0.004) and 31.5% vs 17% (p = 0.005), respectively. Non-relapse mortality (NRM) and GVHD-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) did not differ between the groups with 25.1% vs 21.2% (p = 0.38) and 20.2% vs 10.8 % (p = 0.13), respectively. In MVA, Rel was significantly higher and LFS and OS significantly lower for pts with adverse risk compared to intermediate risk cytogenetics, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.5 (95% CI 1.11-2.02, p = 0.008), HR = 1.29 (95% CI 1.01-1.66, p = 0.041) and 1.32 (95% CI 1.02-1.71, p = 0.037), respectively. NRM and GRFS did not differ, HR = 0.92 (0.59-1.44, p = 0.71) and HR = 1.1 (0.87-1.4, p = 0.42). Risk of aGVHD was similar, HR = 1.06 (0.72-1.56, p = 0.75); as was risk of cGVHD, HR 0.88 (0.5-1.55, p = 0.66).\n\nConclusions: Cytogenetic risk is significantly associated with transplantation outcome in Rel-Ref AML pts undergoing non-T cell depleted haploidentical transplantation while also maintaining its important prognostic role in pts with active leukemia. HaploSCT cannot overcome the deleterious effect of adverse-risk cytogenetics attesting to a comparable graft versus leukemia effect to that observed in other types of allogeneic transplantation.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO015.

The prevalence of this complication and the overall survival (OS) after treatment as well as the best treatment strategy remains largely unknown.\n\nMethods: Patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with or without CNS relapse undergoing HSCT between 1996 and 2016 within the EBMT database were identified. A specific questionnaire was sent through the Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP)-EBMT data office to transplant centers that then reported patients with or without CNS relapse, together with relapse type, treatment and outcome.\n\nResults: From the participating centers, a total of 7991 adult patients transplanted for either AML or ALL between 1996 and 2016 were included in this study. Ninety-one patients had a CNS relapse; median age was 41 years (range (r), 18-75.2). No difference could be detected between the groups according to donor type, sex of the patient or donor, conditioning regimen, time from diagnosis to transplant, stem cell source, CMV viral status or prior CNS involvement. The incidence of CNS relapse at 5 years was 0.9% in AML and 1.9% in ALL (p = 0.002). Relapse was more frequent after 2010 (the median year of HSCT), than before (1.6% vs 0.9%, p = 0.013). The median follow-up after CNS relapse was 88.3 months (IQR, 35.2-119.9). The median time from HSCT to CNS relapse was 396 days (r, 18-3644). The CNS relapse was isolated in 36 (39.6%) patients, it was combined (CNS and bone marrow (BM)) in 30 (33%). The CNS relapse occurred after the hematological relapse in 23 (25.3%) and after molecular relapse in 2 (2.2%) patients. Before CNS relapse, 66 (72.5%) patients did not have GvHD, 25 (27.5%) did.\n\nA complete remission (CR) was achieved in 47 (52.8%) patients after CNS relapse, while 42 patients (47.2%) did not achieve CR, data was missing for two patients. There was a trend for more CR in ALL than in AML (64.1% vs 44%, p = 0.06). Nineteen (20.9%) patients had a second CNS relapse after the first.\n\nFor patients with CNS relapse as first relapse post transplant (n = 66), the OS at two years after CNS relapse was 28.8% in AML and 19.4% in ALL patients (ns), 8.2% and 15.5% at 5 years, respectively. The only factor associated with a significantly better OS was isolated CNS relapse as compared to CNS and BM combined (37.5% vs 6.7% at 2 years, p = 0.004).\n\nConclusions: CNS relapse after HSCT is a rare event (1.14%), more frequent in ALL than in AML. More CNS relapses were detected after 2010, possibly due to information bias with better reporting of CNS relapse in recent years. Half of the patients could achieve CR, but with a low OS in patients with CNS as first relapse (8.2% in AML and 15.5% in ALL, at five years).

However, the prognosis is poor for those who relapse after transplant. There are relatively few data reported in this setting. A retrospective evaluation of outcome for patients with ALL who have relapsed after allo-HSCT is presented.\n\nMethods: One hundred and thirty two patients with relapsed ALL have been identified after a first allo-SCT performed between March 1998 and February 2019, in 11 centres belonging to the Spanish Group for Hematopoietic Transplantation and Cell Therapy (GETH).\n\nResults: The median time [range] between allo-SCT and relapse was 6.87 months [0.93-116.50]. Patient characteristics are listed in Table 1. One hundred and six pts received myeloablative conditioning and 114 pts peripheral blood progenitors. Forty six (44%) and 59 (56%) pts showed complete and mixed chimerism on relapse. In 22 pts (17%), palliative treatment was adopted. Among 110 pts (83%) that received a rescue treatment, 73 pts achieved CR and 40 pts relapsed again. Treatment was chemotherapy (n = 82), TKi (n = 26 pts, all Phi+ ALL) or immunotherapy (n = 19) (inotuzumab and/or blinatumumab). Cell therapy consisted of: donor lymphocyte infusion (29 pts), 2nd allo-SCT (37 pts [34%]) and CAR T 19 therapy (14 pts [13%]). The causes of death were ALL progression (n = 80), toxicity related to rescue treatment (n = 8) and TRM (n = 12) after a 2nd allo-SCT. 30 pts are alive in CR and 1 in relapse. The probabilities of survival at 1 and 5 years were 44% (95%CI: 36%; 52%) and 19% (95% CI: 11%; 27%) respectively with 3.16 years [0.57; 19.34] median follow-up (Figure 1). For the 37 pts who received a 2nd allo-SCT, 5y OS probability was 40% [22%; 58%]. For pts with ALL relapsed after allo-SCT: age >30 yrs, Ph negative ALL, early period for 1st SCT (1998-2013), early relapse (<12 months between 1st allo-SCT and relapse), status at 1st allo-SCT (>1st CR) and chronic GVHD showed a significant influence in OS in the univariable analysis. Younger age (HR: 1.996 [1.314 ; 3.032]), recent period for allo-SCT (HR: 2.184 [1.428 ; 3.340]), late relapse (HR: 2.221 [1.366 ; 3.612]), 1st CR at 1st allo-SCT (HR: 1.962 [1.262 ; 3.050]) and presence of chronic GVHD (HR: 1.761 [1.046 ; 2.965]) confirmed their impact in the multivariable analysis.\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of the patients from the series. N = 132 (%)\n\nConclusions: Although pts with ALL who relapsed after a first allo-SCT have an unfavourable prognosis, those with younger age, late relapse and, allo-SCT performed in 1st CR can be satisfactorily rescued.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NA\n\nDisclosure: Founding: Supported in part by grants from CERCA Program, Generalitat de Catalunya, Spain and “La Caixa” Foundation.\n\nO017. Venetoclax Combined with Hypomethylating Agent (HMA) is Safe And Effective May Be A Good Bridge to Transplant in High-risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nVincenzo Federico1, Michelina Dargenio1, Rosella Matera1, Angelodonato Canaris1, Valentina Bozzoli1, Vincenza Caretto1, Daniela Carlino1, Maria Rosaria De Paolis1, Maria Paola Fina1, Giuseppina Loglisci1, Annarita Messa1, Giovanni Reddiconto1, Stefania Scardino1, Davide Seripa1, Annarosa Soda1, Carolina Vergine1, Nicola Di Renzo1\n\n1 ’Vito Fazzi’ Hospital, ASL Lecce, Lecce, Italy\n\nBackground: High-risk acute myeloid leukemia (HR-AML), as well older patients are characterized by high frequency of cytogenetic adverse-risk features or comorbidities, being them less responsive to induction therapy with poor outcome as R/R AML patients. Venetoclax, an oral highly selective BCL-2 inhibitor, demonstrated a synergistic anti-leukemia activity when combined with HMA without additional significant toxicity. Here we report the outcome of patients with de novo-AML or R/R AML treated with venetoclax and HMA aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of this combination and its role as a bridge to transplant.\n\nMethods: From October 2018 to October 2020, a total of 24 patients, median age was 69 years (range 27-80), 14 (60%) with de novo-AML and adverse/complex cytogenetics features according to ELN criteria not eligible for intensive induction therapy, and 10 (40%) with R/R AML, were included in the study. Among patients with R/R AML, 3 patients relapsed after HMA, 5 after induction therapy, and 2 after allogenic transplant. After rum-up, all patients received Venetoclax 400 mg/daily orally in 28-day cycles combined with decitabine 20 mg/m2 days 1-5 of each 28-day cycle, 15 patients (63%) or azacitidine 75 mg/m2 days 1-7 of each 28-day cycle, 9 patients (37%). All patients received a median of 3 cycles (range 1-19) of venetoclax in combination with HMA.\n\nResults: Composite complete remission (CR+iCR) rate was 60%, 75% and 50% for all patients, de novo-AML, and R/R AML, respectively. In both groups, the median time to response was 2 months (range 1-5). No induction death was observed. At 5 months of median follow-up (range 2-22), 14 out of 24 patients (58%) are alive, including 5 patients (21%) still on therapy and in CR, while 10 patients (42%) died, mostly because progressive disease. After a median of 3 cycles (range 3-4) of venetoclax plus HMA, 9 patients, 6 R/R (60%) and 3 de novo-AML (40%) underwent to allogenic HSCT (6 haploidentical, 1 matched-related donor and 2 MUD). The most common grade 3/4 hematological toxicity was anemia (58%), thrombocytopenia (45%), leukopenia (62%) and febrile neutropenia (31%). No grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity was observed. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between patients with de novo AML or R/R AML (11.7 vs 11.9 months), [p = 0.527]). In contrast, median OS was better for transplanted patients compared to did not, 9.7 months, (range 5.5-14.0) vs 3.0 months, (range 0.8-5.2), [p = 0.001]. After a median follow-up of 13 months (range 2.2-22.0) all patients transplanted are alive and in CR.\n\nConclusions: The treatment of HR-AML, R/R-AML, as well as ederly AML, is challenging for hematologist. The combination of venetoclax and HMA has shown to be safe and effective in this setting of patients with high response rate without significant toxicity. In our series about one half of patients underwent to transplant making this combination a good option as bridge to transplant.\n\nDisclosure: no disclosure to declare.\n\nO018.

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, Allogeneic HSCT and Survival in AML Patients 65-75 Years Old\n\nGabriele Magliano1, Luana Fianchi1,2, Patrizia Chiusolo1,2, Federica Sora’1,2, Luca Laurenti1,2, Elisabetta Metafuni2, Sabrina Giammarco2, Idanna Innocenti2, Francesco Autore2, Simona Sica1,2, Marianna Criscuolo2, Livio Pagano1,2, Andrea Bacigalupo1,2\n\n1 Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy, 2 Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Roma, Italy\n\nBackground: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients over the age of 65 carries a poor prognosis, due to unsatisfactory control of the disease with chemotherapy alone. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can provide significant anti-leukemic effect in eligible patients. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility and outcome of allogeneic HSCT in a prospective cohort of AML patients aged 65-75.\n\nMethods: 44 consecutive de novo or secondary AML patients, aged 65-75 years, were diagnosed in our Unit between September 2018 and August 2020. Patients were risk-stratified according to ELN 2017 criteria and classified as FIT, UNFIT and FRAIL according to a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), which included ECOG, CIRS, ADL and IADL scores. Only fit patients with intermediate-high ELN 2017 risk score were eligible for HSCT.\n\nResults: The median age was 70 years (range 65-75). 9 patients presented with favorable, 16 with intermediate and 15 with unfavorable ELN2017 risk. 19 patients were classified as FIT, 12 as UNFIT and 13 as FRAIL. All FRAIL patients were treated with best supportive care, except for one with hypomethylating agents (HMAs). UNFIT patients were treated with HMAs (n = 8), citarabine+Flt-3 inhibitors (n = 1), CPX-351 (n = 1), FLA regimen (n = 1), one refused treatment.\n\nIn the FIT group, induction was performed with standard chemotherapy (n = 9), CPX-351 (n = 5), HMAs (n = 1), low dose citarabine (n = 1), and allo HSCT upfront (n = 3). Median CIRS score was 1 (1-4). 12/19 had ECOG score 0, whereas 18/19 had IADL over 5/8.\n\nA complete remission (CR) was achieved in 15/44 patients overall (39%) and in 15/19 FIT patients (79%). At last follow-up, 14/44 patients were alive (median 135 days, range 1-813), with an actuarial 2 year survival of 21% . Survival was 0% for FRAIL and UNFIT patients and 52% for FIT patients (Figure 1).\n\nAllogeneic HSCT. 13/19 FIT patients were allografted. Reasons for not grafting were early relapse (n = 2), refusal (n = 2) and waiting list (n = 2). The donor type was HLA haploidentical (n = 6), MUD (n = 4), MSD (n = 2), cord blood (n = 1). The stem cell source was unmanipulated peripheral blood cells (n = 7), bone marrow (n = 5), or cord blood (n = 1). The conditioning was non myeloblative (n = 2), reduced intensity (n = 9) or myeloablative (n = 2). GvHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin, mofetil mycophenolate and post transplant cyclophosphamide in 9/13 patients. Acute GvHD grade (II-IV) developed in 5 patients (38%) and chronic GvHD in 3 (23%). The actuarial 2 year survival is 60%, and the median survival from diagnosis is 365 days (60-813) ; the cause of death was transplant related (n = 2, 15%) and relapse (n = 2, 15%).\n\nFigure 1.\n\nConclusions: CGA has a strong influence on treatment strategies in elderly AML. An allogeneic HSCT was performed in 68% of FIT patients with promising results: bed availability was the single most important factor delaying transplantation. New therapies are required for UNFIT and FRAIL patients.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO026. CD19 Car T Therapy In Children with R/R All: Adaptive Split Dosing Improves Safety and Maintains Efficacy of the Approach\n\nOlga Molostova1, Larisa Shelikhova1, Yakov Muzalevsky1, Alexey Kazachenok1, Rimma Khismatullina1, Julia Abugova1, Elena Kurnikova1, Pavel Trakhtman1, Dmitry Balashov1, Dmitriy Pershin1, Viktoria Zubachenko1, Maria Fadeeva1, Alexander Popov1, Olga Illarionova1, Georg Rauser2, Regina Alex2, Boro Dropulic3, Rimas Orentas3, Dina Shneider3, Natalia Miakova1, Dmitry Litvinov1, Galina Novichkova1, Alexey Maschan1, Michael Maschan1\n\n1 Dmitriy Rogachev National Medical Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2 Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, 3 Lentigen, A Miltenyi Biotec Company, Gaithersburg, United States\n\nBackground: CD19 CAR-T cells manufactured at the point-of-care based on the automatic bioreactor platform were tested in a prospective academic trial. Despite prophylactic tocilizumab, severe CRS and ICANS developed in a minority of patients. In the amended part of the trial, protocol of CAR-T application was modified to adapt the starting CAR-T dose to the leukemia burden and implement a split-dose strategy in high-risk patients.\n\nMethods: A cohort of 30 children with BCP-ALL received CAR-T therapy in dose-escalation regimen (cohort 1) and 24 pts in the risk-adapted regimen (cohort 2). Final non-cryopreserved product was administered to all patients after lymphodepletion and prophylactic tocilizumab.\n\nIn cohort 1, four CAR-T dose levels were used: 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 3*106/kg. Bone marrow leukemia burden was high (>20%) in 19 patients. In cohort 2 a flat dose of 1*106/kg was used for 10 pts with low leukemia burden (<20%). Among 14 patients with high leukemia burden 0.1*106/kg was infused on day 0, a second infusion (0.9*106/kg) was scheduled at day 7. Criteria for second CAR-T infusion included the absence of CRS or ICANS > grade 2 and reduction of leukemia burden to <20%. The CliniMACS Prodigy T-cell transduction process with lentiviral second generation CD19.4-1BB zeta vector (Lentigen, Miltenyi Biotec) was used.\n\nResults: Interim analysis in cohort 1 showed that severe (grade 3-5) CRS and neurotoxicity were associated exclusively with large leukemia burden (>20% blasts in the bone marrow) at the enrollment (p = 0,002). In cohort 2 there were no cases of grade IV-V toxicity in patients with high leukemia burden, four patients received the second CAR-T infusion, thereafter 1 pt developed CRS grade III and ICANS grade I. One pt with low leukemia burden developed ICANS grade IV with brain edema. In cohort 1, twenty-seven patients were evaluable for response at day 28, and 24 (89%) of them had MRD-negative remission. Relapse after initial response was registered in 18 (75%) cases, median time to relapse was 184 days. With the risk-adapted strategy in the group with low leukemia burden 8 patients (80%) achieved CR at day 28, and 4 pts (50%) relapsed (median time to relapse was 127 days). In the group with high leukemia burden all patients (100%) achieved complete remission on day 28, 7 relapses (50%) occurred with a median of 93 days.\n\nConclusions: All patients with high leukemia burden, who received only one CAR-T dose at 0.1*106/kg, achieved MRD-negative CR, confirming high potency of the fresh CD19 CAR-T product. Risk-adapted CAR-T dosing strategy allowed to maintain a high rate of remission and to reduce the risk of severe toxicity among patients with high initial disease burden.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: CT: NCT03467256\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclare.\n\nO027. Contribution of Age and The HCT-CI to Predict CRS And Icans Severity In NHL Patients Receiving CD19 Car T-cell Therapy\n\nJordan Gauthier1, Aisling Cearley1, Paula Perkins1, Angela Kirk1, Mazyar Shadman1, David Maloney1, Cameron Turtle1, Mohamed Sorror1\n\n1 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, United States\n\nBackground: CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor-engineered (CD19 CAR) T-cell therapy lead to high response rates in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell malignancies, yet significant toxicities impact its use and broad dissemination. Severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) have been reported in a subset of patients after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy. To date, predictive models of CRS and ICANS severity are lacking, and the impact of age and comorbidities on these toxicities remains poorly characterized. Thus, we assessed the role of age and the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) to predict CRS and ICANS severity in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) patients undergoing CD19 CAR-T cell therapy.\n\nMethods: We analyzed 93 patients treated at our institution with relapsed or refractory B-NHL. CRS and ICANS were graded using the 2019 ASTCT and CTCAE4.03, respectively. Patients received cyclophosphamide and fludarabine lymphodepletion followed by the infusion of axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel; up to 2 x 108 CAR T cells) or defined-composition CAR T cells (JCAR014; 2 x 106/kg) on a phase I/II clinical trial (NCT01865617). We applied multivariable proportional odds logistic regression to model peak CRS and ICANS grade as a function of predictors evaluated at baseline prior to lymphodepletion. The base models were specified after testing interaction effects using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of a model including the following predictors: age, HCT-CI, CAR T-cell product type, prelymphodepletion LDH, platelet count, absolute lymphocyte count, and albumin. The predictive value of age and HCT-CI was assessed using the likelihood ratio (LR) test, discrimination (C-index), and calibration (smooth calibration curves).\n\nResults: Fifty four patients (58%) received axi-cel, while 39 (42%) received JCAR014. The ANOVA table using all predictors identified the CAR T-cell product (p = 0.001) and the prelymphodepletion LDH (p = 0.005) as the most important predictors of CRS severity. Age and HCT-CI did not add predictive information to a base model including CAR T-cell product and prelymphodepletion LDH (LR test, p = 0.72), and did not improve discrimination (C-index = 0.71 and 0.72 without and with age + HCT-CI) or calibration.The ANOVA table showed the CAR T-cell product (p = 0.09), age (p = 0.07), and the prelymphodepletion LDH (p = 0.06) were the most important predictors of ICANS severity.Age improved a model including CAR T-cell product and prelymphodepletion LDH (LR Chi2, 2.89; p = 0.09). Models with or without age had comparable discrimination (C-index=0.65 and 0.66, respectively), but the addition of age improved model calibration. The HCT-CI (LR Chi2, 1.47, p = 0.69) did not add predictive value when added to the base model including age with similar discrimination (C-index = 0.66 with or without HCT-CI). In a model including age, CAR T-cell product and prelymphodepletion LDH, the odds ratio for age was 1.03 per year increase (95%CI, 0.99-1.06).\n\nConclusions: While older age was associated with higher risk of severe ICANS after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, the HCT-CI did not improve CRS or ICANS risk prediction. We plan to validate our findings and refine our models in a larger cohort including other commercial CAR T-cell products.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NCT01865617\n\nDisclosure: D.G.M. has received research funding from Kite Pharma, Juno Therapeutics, a Celgene company, and Celgene; has received honoraria for participation in advisory boards meetings with Kite Pharma, Gilead, Genentech, Novartis and Eureka.

Vall d´Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, 5 Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valencia, Spain, 6 Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain\n\nBackground: Axicabtagen Ciloleucel (axi-cel) is approved in Europe for the treatment of adults with R/R large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL), primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) and transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL). In Spain, nationwide CAR-T administration requests are reviewed centrally within the Ministry of Health. We analyzed the real-world outcomes of patients treated with axi-cel under the commercial label in Spanish centers.\n\nMethods: Six designated centers for commercial CAR-T administration collected data on behalf of GETH-GELTAMO. Data were collected retrospectively from consecutive patients in whom apheresis was performed for axi-cel treatment from Febrruary-2019 to November-2020. CRS and ICANS were graded with the ASTCT consensus criteria. Response was assessed according to the Lugano criteria.\n\nResults: 106 patients with R/R lymphoma underwent apheresis for axi-cel. At data cutoff, 92 (87%) received infusion. The reasons for not undergoing infusion were progression-related death in 12 (86%), tumor lysis syndrome in 1 (7%) and complete response after bridging therapy in 1 (7%). Of note, 14 patients were conditioned and infused during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in Spain (March-April 2020).\n\nMedian time from Ministry approval to infusion was 54 days. Histology consisted of 74% DLBCL with 11% tFL, and 15% PMBCL. Disease status at lymphodepletion was PD in 69%, SD in 22% and PR in 9%. All patients received lymphodepletion. Median time from leukapheresis to start of lymphodepletion was 34 days. Median time from leukapheresis to infusion was 39 days. Median hospitalization period was 21 days. Any grade of CRS occurred in 86% of pts (18% grade 2, 6.5% grades 3-4). Tocilizumab was used in 58% of patients who developed CRS, corticosteroids in 19%. ICANS was diagnosed in 42.5% of pts (10% grade 2, 15% grade 3-4). Treatment for ICANS included corticosteroids in 78%, tocilizumab in 31%, siltuximab in 15%, and anakinra in 21%. ICU admission was needed in 20 patients (22%). 4 patients died in the context of ICANS, 1 due to CRS, and 1 due to infection. Of 80 patients evaluable and restaged at day 30, ORR was 78% with 40% CR, 38% PR, 11% PD and 11% SD or indeterminate. Of 58 patients evaluable at day 100, 66% had ongoing response (CR 48%, PR 18%). Of 23 patients evaluable at day 180, 65% presented CR. Of 39 patients who showed PR/SD at day 30, 9 (23%) converted to CR. After a median follow-up of 6.3 months, EFS and OS were 55.5% and 78%, respectively in the infused population, with an estimated median EFS and OS of 13.1 and 7.3 months. In the intention-to-treat analysis for all patients who underwent apheresis, median estimated OS and EFS were 12.3 (95%CI 8.9-15.7) and 6.6 months (95%CI 4.6-8.5), respectively (Figure 1).\n\nConclusions: This Spanish multicenter retrospective analysis shows encouraging results of axi-cell treatment in patients with R/R aggressive B-cell lymphoma in the real-world setting. Significant toxicity events were less frequent than those reported in the pivotal trial, however events of mortality associated to toxicity occurred. With a limited follow-up time, response outcomes are favorable.\n\nClinical Trial Registry:\n\nDisclosure: Mi Kwon, advisory honoraria Novartis, BMS, Gilead.

Humoral Response to Pneumococcal Antigens Declines After CD19-targeted Car T Cell Therapy\n\nDasom Lee1, Michael Jain2, Julio Chavez2, Marco Davila2, Farhad Khimani2, Aleksandr Lazaryan2, Javier Pinilla2, Bijal Shah2, Frederick Locke2\n\n1 University of South Florida, Tampa, United States, 2 H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute, Tampa, United States\n\nBackground: We evaluated Large B cell Lymphoma (LBCL) patients treated with CD19-targeted Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T) to determine pre and post serum pneumococcal antibody levels and the impact of post CAR-T vaccination on these levels.\n\nMethods: We retrospectively identified LBCL patients that had serum pneumococcal IgG titers within 30 days prior to CAR-T (baseline), day+90 (range: 75-110) or day+180 (range: 170-200) after CAR-T. We next identified patients that received pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) on day+90. Serotypes tested include those specific (1, 4, 5, 7F, 9V, 18C) and non-specific (8, 9N, 12F) to the vaccine. Pneumococcal IgG titers, stratified by serotype and/or vaccination status, were compared with paired nonparametric t-test. An established IgG concentration ≥1.3μg/mL was considered protective. Patients with ≥4/6 tested vaccine specific serotypes meeting this threshold were deemed successfully vaccinated.\n\nResults: We identified 66 patients with pneumococcal IgG titers drawn on at least one of the following timepoints: baseline, day+90 or day+180. Protective immunity against pneumococcus was observed in 17% (5/29), 21% (7/33), and 17% (5/29) of patients at baseline, day+90, and day+180 respectively. 10 patients had paired data at baseline and day+90, and 12 patients had paired data on day+90 and day+180. 1 patient had IgG titers at all three timepoints.\n\nIn the 10 patients with paired data at baseline and day+90, vaccine specific serotype IgG titers significantly decreased from baseline to day+90 (p = 0.002) (Figure 1). Non-vaccine specific serotype titers decreased but did not meet statistical significance (p = 0.08). When pooling all serotypes together, there was a significant decrease in IgG titers from baseline to day+90 (p = 0.002). Only 1 out of these 10 patients met criteria of protective immunity at baseline, which was lost on day+90.\n\n12 patients had paired samples on day+90 and day+180, and 5 of those patients received PCV13 on day+90 after titers were drawn. The unvaccinated patients (n = 7) had a significant decrease in IgG titers of all vaccine specific serotypes (p = 0.04) (Figure 2). Non-vaccine specific serotypes titers decreased but did not meet statistical significance (p = 0.08). There was a significant decrease in IgG titers of all serotypes from day+90 to day+180 (p = 0.006). 1 out of the 7 unvaccinated patients met the criteria of protective immunity on day+90, which persisted on day+180.\n\nIn the 5 patients vaccinated on day+90, both vaccine specific and non-vaccine specific serotypes titers decreased significantly on day+180 (p = 0.016 and p = 0.031, respectively) (Figure 3). None of the vaccine specific titers converted from non-protective to protective immunity. 2 out of the 5 patients met the criteria of protective immunity on day+90, which persisted on day+180. However, no titers increased more than 2-fold on day+180 after vaccination suggesting vaccination was ineffective.\n\nConclusions: Our results demonstrate few LBCL patients have protective immunity against pneumococcus at baseline before CAR-T, and existing titers may decrease after CAR-T. Data in several patients who received PCV13 on day+90 suggests humoral immunity cannot be restored by vaccination at this timepoint. Clinical trials are needed to determine the optimal timing of vaccination, before or after CAR-T, to develop protective immunity against pneumococcus.\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO030. Decreased Neuroprotective Analytes on Day of Infusion of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (Car) T Cells are Associated with Neurotoxicity\n\nMadhavi Lakkaraja1,2, Kinga Hosszu1, Devin McAvoy1, Audrey Mauguen1, Terence J Purdon1, Yasmin Khakoo,2, Bianca D. Santomasso1, Isabelle Riviere1, Michele Sadelain1, Kevin J Curran1, Jae H Park1, Renier J Brentjens1, Jaap Jan Boelens1,2\n\n1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, United States, 2 Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Neurotoxicity is a severe and potentially fatal complication associated with Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR-T cell) therapy - a promising curative treatment option for hematological malignancies. In children and adults with leukemia/lymphoma, elevated cytokines such as IL2, sIL-2R Aα, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL13, IL-15, IFN-γ, MCP-1 and others were identified in plasma on day 3 after infusion of CAR-T cells. While in CSF, elevated protein and cytokines -IL1a, IL6, IL10, GCSF, TNF-α, IFN-γ have been noted. Identifying early predictors/biomarkers, could help identifying patients at risk of developing neurotoxicity. In this pilot study, we aim to detect analytes or signatures that could potentially be biomarkers to predict neurotoxicity in patients receiving CAR-T cells. To achieve this, we used the Olink proteomic platform.\n\nMethods: 15 patients (6 adults and 9 children), who were treated with CD19 directed CAR-T cells (MSKCC and commercial), and had serum samples cryopreserved and banked at various time points (baseline to 2 weeks after infusion) were included in the study. We analyzed plasma by targeted proteomics with proximity extension assays (PEAs; Olink) for 92 markers focused on neurological diseases and biological processes such as axon development, neurogenesis and synapse assembly. To investigate correlation in analytes values, heatmaps of the normalized biomarker values were drawn based on euclidean distance and complete linkage at baseline. Baseline biomarker values were compared between patients with and without neurotoxicity using Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon tests. The analysis was repeated using the slope of biomarker change during the first week or up to the time to neurotoxicity. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\nResults: 15 patients received CAR T cells for B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL) and were included in the study. Median age was 19.9 (Range:2.8 to 46.3) years, 8(53%) patients were female. Conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. 8/15(53%) patients had prior hematopoietic cell transplantation. Median fludarabine exposure was 20.4 (Range:10.5–27.5)mg*h/L. 10 patients(67%) had neurotoxicity (7:grade 1, 1:grade 3, and 2:grade 4). Median time to neurotoxicity was 7.5 (Range:5 to 18) days. At baseline,13/92 analytes were significantly decreased in patients who developed neurotoxicity compared to patients who did not develop neurotoxicity - ECE1, CDH15, KLB, GPNMB, KIR2DL3, IMPA1, CLSTN1, LEPR, FGFR2, NPM1, IL32, IL3RA, and GGT5. All these 13 markers identified at baseline have been suggested to be neuroprotective. In addition, 5 analytes increased from baseline before development neurotoxicity: BST2, NPM1, ASGR1, PHOSPHO1 and AOC1 - Four analytes have been associated with cellular stress and neuroinflammation in neurological diseases and one (NMP1) is neuroprotective.\n\nConclusions: Using Olink proteomics platform we identified 13 analytes for which lower value at baseline was associated with development of neurotoxicity after CAR-T cells. These analytes are known to be neuroprotective. The 4 analytes,which increased from baseline in patients who developed neurotoxicity,have been associated with cellular stress and one is neuroprotective. These findings suggest that patients at risk for neurotoxicity may be identified at infusion of CAR-T cells. If these results are confirmed in larger dataset,these markers can be used to take preventive measures in patients at risk.\n\nDisclosure: Madhavi Lakkaraja, MD, MPH, Kinga Hosszu, PhD, Devin McAvoy, Terence J.

Comparison of Two Kinds of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin on Outcomes of Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation For Refractory/Relapsed and High-Risk B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia After CAR-T Therapy\n\nZhao-Yanli Zhao1,2, Jian-Ping Zhang1,2, De-Yan Liu1,2, Zhi-Jie Wei1,2, Min Xiong1,2, Rui-Juan Sun1,2, Jia-Rui Zhou1,2, Yue Lu1,2, Xing-Yu Cao1,2, Xian Zhang1,2, Jun-Fang Yang1,2, Pei-Hua Lu1,2, Dao-Pei Lu1,2\n\n1 Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, China, 2 Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China\n\nBackground: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plays an important role in preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after unmanipulated haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT). However, the optimal type and dose of ATG remain undetermined, especially in the relatively distinctive population of refractory/relapsed (R/R) and high-risk B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) after CAR-T therapy.\n\nMethods: The clinical outcomes of 87 R/R and high-risk B-ALL patients achieved complete remission (CR) after anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy subsequently bridged to unmanipulated haplo-SCT between July 2015 and March 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Conditioning regimens were administered with total body irradiation (TBI, 2Gyx5~6) plus either anti-T lymphocyte globulin (ATLG, Grafalon®) 20 mg/kg (n = 63) or rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG, Thymoglobuline®) 5~7.5 mg/kg (n = 24). Cyclosporine, short-term methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil were used for GVHD prophylaxis. As of August 2020, the median survival time for this cohort was 39 months (29 - 58 months).\n\nResults: The patients in the ATLG group were relatively older with median age of 15 (2-49 years old) versus 8 (4-41 years old, p = 0.004) in the rATG group. In the ATLG group, total mononuclear cell count (MNC, median 8.7 [5.0-15.5] x108/kg versus 12.0 [6.8-17.5] x108/kg, p = 0.005) and infused CD34 cell count (median 4.46 [1.4-10.2] x106/kg versus 5.95 [2.8-8.8] x106/kg, p = 0.000) were relatively lower than those in the rATG group. In this cohort, the incidence of acute GVHD were comparable among the two ATG groups for Grade II-IV (29.0% [95% CI 19.0-39.0%] in the ATLG group vs. 37.5% [95% CI 18.1-56.9%] in the rATG group, p = 0.598) and Grade III-IV (6.5% [95% CI 0.4-12.6%] in the ATLG group vs. 16.7% [95% CI 1.8-31.6%] in the rATG group, p = 0.164). The occurrence of EBV-DNAemia (15.9% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.162), CMV-DNAemia (47.6% vs. 58.3%, p = 0.372), and hemorrhagic cystitis (27.0% vs. 25.0%, p = 0.851) were similar between the ATLG group and rATG group. Chronic GVHD in both ATG groups were comparable (74.1% [95% CI 61.2-87.0%] and 69.8% [95% CI 49.2-90.4%] for the ATLG and rATG groups respectively (p = 0.526). The rate of extensive chronic GVHD in the ATLG group and rATG group were 12.7% [95% CI 3.9-21.5%] and 15.4% [95% CI -0.9-31.7%] (p = 0.959), respectively. The incidence of 3-year relapse rate were 13.8% [95% CI 4.8-22.8%] in the ATLG group versus 4.5% [95% CI -4.1-13.1%] in the rATG group (p = 0.248). The 3-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 20.5% [95% CI 10.1-30.9%] in the ATLG group versus 16.7% [95% CI 1.8-31.6%] in the rATG group (p = 0.746). In the ATLG group, 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 68.3% [95% CI 56.7-79.9%] versus 79.2% [95% CI 62.9-95.5%]in the rATG group (p = 0.349). The 3-year overall survival (OS) in the ATLG group was 69.8% [95% CI 58.4-81.2%] versus 83.3% [95% CI 68.4-98.2%] in the rATG group (p = 0.234).\n\nConclusions: Both types of ATG (ATLG versus rATG) led to comparable clinical outcomes with respect to GVHD prophylaxis and viral infection in this cohort of relatively homogenous patient population treated with CD19 CAR-T followed by bridging to haplo-SCT with TBI. Larger, randomized clinical studies are currently underway to further confirm these results.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR-oic-16009259, ChiCTR-OON-16009143, ChiCTR-IIh-16008711, ChiCTR-ONC-17012829 (http://www.chictr.org.cn)\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to declare.\n\nO032. Impact of SARS-COV-2 on Delivery of Car T Cell Therapy in Europe: A Survey from The Cellular Therapy and Immunobiology Working Party of The EBMT\n\nSara Ghorashian1, Florent Malard2, Meltem Kurt Yüksel3, Jorinde Hoogenboom4, Katya Mauff5, Alvaro Urbano-Ispizua6, Jürgen Kuball7, Rafael de la Camara8, Stephen Mielke9, Annalisa Ruggeri10, Christian Chabannon11\n\n1 UCL, London, United Kingdom, 2 Saint Antoine Hospital, AP-HP, Sorbonne Université, Paris, France, 3 Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey, 4 EBMT Leiden Study Unit, Leiden, Netherlands, 5 EBMT Statistical Unit, Leiden, Netherlands, 6 Hospital Clinic Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, 7 University Medical Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands, 8 Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain, 9 Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, 10 IRCCS Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy, 11 Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France\n\nBackground: The SARS-COV-2/COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact on cancer therapy. Given the complexity of CAR T cell therapy (products manufactured on a bespoke basis; treatment centres also providing procurement; transportation to and from manufacturing sites; requirement for in-patient and/or ICU beds), we sought to define the impact of the pandemic on delivery of CAR T cell therapies in Europe.\n\nMethods: We carried out a snapshot survey of EBMT centres to define the impact of the pandemic and associated socio-economic restrictions on CAR T cell activity during the interval Q1 to Q4 2020.\n\nResults: 49 out of 118 centres in 12 countries (42%) responded to the survey. 49% of responding centres deliver licensed CAR T cell therapy for B-ALL and B-NHL with a further 25% delivering these licensed therapies and academic CAR T studies. The median number of CAR T cell infusions per centre in 2019 was 8 (range 0-68), with the majority (59%) carrying out 0-10.\n\nAt survey completion, 25/49 (51%) of centres were subject to partial lockdown, 4% a complete lockdown and 45% were without restriction. 25/49 (51%) of centres reported reduced patient capacity, most commonly due to patient factors (14/25 (56%), e.g. too unwilling or unable to travel), reduction in in-patient beds (13/25 (52%)), reduced ICU access (12/25 (48%)), reduced clinical trial activity (12/25 (48%)), proven or unproven COVID-19 infection (12/25 (48%)) and reduced out-patient provision (11/25 (44%) NB more than one reason was allowed. More rare causes included delayed manufacture (6 (24%)) or reduced tocilizumab access (3 (12%)). 14/49 (29%) of centres reported a delay for at least one patient up to survey completion. 8/14 centres (57%) had 1-2 patients delayed; 5/14 centres (36%) had 3-5 and 1 centre (7%) had 7 patients delayed.\n\nOf 31 delayed patients, the median age was 62 years, (range 8-75), 19/31 (61%) had DLBCL, 8/31 (26%) had B-ALL and 4/31 (13%) had another indication. 13/31 (42%) were considered for axicabtagene ciloleucel, 8/31 (26%) were considered for tisagenlecleucel and 10 (32%), another product.\n\nMost commonly cited reasons for delay included reduced ICU access, reduction in rostered haematology medical team, reduction in in-patient beds (22, 7 and 5 reports respectively). 27/31 (87%) of patients were delayed in bridging. Patients were delayed up to 1 month (18/31, 58%) 1-3 months (8/31, 26%) or 2/31 (6%) for 4-12 months. 3/31 (10%) of patients were delayed indefinitely. 25/31 (81%) were subsequently infused, 5/31 (16%) were cancelled. In 15 cases, delay was associated with additional therapy prior to CAR T and in 12 cases, with disease progression.\n\nConclusions: COVID-19 had a significant impact on CAR T therapy across Europe. 51% of centres reported decreased patient capacity. Just under a third reported a delay to delivery of CAR T therapy. The majority of centres with delayed patients reported 1-2 patients affected, mainly in the bridging period, most patients (58%) proceeded to infusion by one month. Delay to CAR T cell therapy necessitated additional therapy and resulted in disease progression in 15 and 12 instances respectively.\n\nDisclosure: Sara Ghorashian: Patents/royalties UCLB, Honoraria Novartis, Amgen.\n\nFlorent Malard: Astellas: Honoraria; JAZZ pharmaceuticals: Honoraria; Sanofi: Honoraria; Janssen: Honoraria; Keocyt: Honoraria; Theralos/Mallinckrodt: Honoraria; Biocodex: Honoraria.\n\nJurgen Kuball: Shareholder and cofounder of Gadeta.

This lead to the establishment of a registry that today collects information from more than 600 transplant programs established in Europe and beyond, and contains data on more than 700.000 transplants. Innovative hematopoietic cellular therapies that are regulated as medicinal products (MP) are now entering the market at an accelerated pace, raising new hopes for patients and families. These include Immune Effector Cells (IEC), the most publicized being Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR)-T cells. These gene therapy MPs induce responses in a significant proportion of patients affected with relapsed/refractory lymphoid malignancies at advanced stages, but also carry significant risks to the patients. They are living drugs with effects that can persist for extended periods of time. They are manufactured through viral engineering of autologous T cells isolated from blood mononuclear cells, and thus qualify as genetically modified organisms. The manufacturing process takes advantage of infrastructures and expertise that are similarly used for HCTs, including cell collection and cell processing facilities. CAR-T cells are among the most expensive MP ever marketed. In view of these features, the EBMT registry appears ideally suited to contribute to the long-term follow-up of patients treated with CAR-T cells, as mandated by health authorities.\n\nMethods: A “Cellular Therapy Form” (CTF) was created, taking into account requirements expressed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) as part of the Registry initiative; EMA released a positive qualification opinion of the EBMT CTF in February 2019. Soon thereafter, the EBMT started to collect information on CAR-T cell treated patients and publish monthly activity reports from July 2019 onwards. Harmonization with the CIBMTR data collection toolbox is continuously being pursued.\n\nResults: As of Dec 1st and 27 months after EMA approved the first two CAR-T cells, 1,235 treated patients have been registered, 84% of them received a commercial MP, while the remainder received investigational CAR-T cells. Activity is growing in all EU countries. Registration and follow-up are collected from treating centers on a voluntary basis, similar to what has been done with the Med-A form for HCTs; this information has allowed to produce the first reports to the two Marketing Authorization Holders (MAH) that currently market CAR-T cells in Europe. The Post-Authorization Safety Studies (PASS) now launched with these MAHs will create conditions for improved reporting and quality checks. At the time of writing, approximately 10% of registered patients have a follow-up beyond one year; this asset will expand quantitatively and qualitatively in the future, as more patients reach this milestone, and additional follow-up is captured.\n\nConclusions: The Go-CAR-T initiative aims to bring together different categories of stakeholders in order to define rules for revision of the CTF, access to data, design studies and ultimately take full advantage of this repository to measure the medical value of this new class of MPs.\n\nDisclosure: CC: Kite/Gilead, Novartis, Celgene / BMS, Janssen, Bellicum, Terumo BCT: honoraria, speakers bureau, advisory board.\n\nJK: Shareholder and cofounder of Gadeta.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients with EBV+ PTLD that is relapsed or refractory (R/R) to rituximab treatment decline rapidly with a median overall survival (OS) of ~1.7 months (Socié EBMT 2020), demonstrating an urgent unmet need for effective, well-tolerated therapies. We have previously shown clinical benefit in pts with EBV+ PTLD after HCT who responded (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to tabelecleucel, including an 86% 2-year survival rate (Prockop ASH 2019 and JCI 2019). Here, we report aggregate OS in patients with EBV+ PTLD after HCT with CR or PR with tabelecleucel treatment.\n\nMethods: Treatment response and OS were assessed in three studies (NCT00002663, NCT01498484 and NCT02822495). All pts received tabelecleucel at ≈2 x 106 cells/kg on Days 1, 8 and 15 in a 35-day treatment cycle. Pts received a median (range) of 2.0 (1–5) cycles.\n\nResults: Fifty HCT recipients with EBV+ PTLD R/R to rituximab were treated with tabelecleucel. The investigator assessed objective response rate (PR+CR) was 62% (31/50) with a best overall response (BOR) of CR (n = 24) or PR (n = 7; Table 1, Figure 1). Two-year survival rates were 81.6 and 85.7% for patients with CR and PR, respectively (Table 1). Treatment was well tolerated with no confirmed evidence for graft vs host disease, cytokine release syndrome, or neurotoxicity attributable to tabelecleucel in these very sick, treatment refractory, and immunocompromised pts.\n\nTable 1. OS by BOR\n\nConclusions: Tabelecleucel is well tolerated, and the data reported here show that across studies, pts with EBV+ PTLD following HCT that is R/R to rituximab who responded to tabelecleucel experienced long-term survival, which contrasts with the short median OS of <2 months historically reported in this high-risk, treatment refractory pt population (Socié EBMT 2020). Importantly, patients who achieved a PR with tabelecleucel derived similar OS benefit to those who achieved a CR.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NCT00002663, NCT01498484 and NCT02822495.

Crispr-Based Replacement of The Endogenous T-Cell Repertoire With Novel, High-Avidity, Natural T Cell Receptors To WT1 For The Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia\n\nEliana Ruggiero1, Erica Carnevale1, Aaron Prodeus2, Zulma Magnani1, Barbara Camisa1, Claudia Politano1, Lorena Stasi1, Alessia Potenza1, Beatrice Claudia Cianciotti1, Francesco Manfredi1, Mattia Di Bono1, Luca Vago1, Michela Tassara1, Sara Mastaglio1, Maurilio Ponzoni1, Francesca Sanvito1, Daniel O’Connell2, Ivy Dutta2, Stephanie A Yazinski2, Mark McKee2, Mohamed S Arredouani2, Birgit Schultes2, Fabio Ciceri1, Chiara Bonini1\n\n1 San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 2 Intellia Therapeutics, Cambridge, United States\n\nBackground: By targeting tumor antigens with high sensitivity, and by promoting T cell survival signals, T cell receptor (TCR)-based therapy has the potential to induce potent and durable clinical responses in cancer patients. However, the need of high-avidity TCRs specific for shared oncogenic antigens and of manufacturing protocols able to completely redirect T-cell specificity while preserving T-cell fitness, remain relevant limiting factors. Here, we aim at the identification of a panel of novel tumor-specific TCRs, to be exploited in adoptive T-cell therapy.\n\nMethods: We focused on Wilms’ Tumor 1 (WT1), a zinc finger transcription factor overexpressed by a wide range of hematological and solid tumors, of proven immunogenicity, with restricted expression on healthy tissues and a strong correlation with oncogenesis, all characteristics that prioritize this antigen for cancer immunotherapy purposes. We designed and implemented an innovative protocol for the rapid isolation of WT1-specific T cells and for the characterization of a library of tumor-specific TCRs restricted to different human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. T cell recognition was assessed by flow cytometry in terms of CD107a expression and IFNγ production. Recognized peptides were mapped by a deconvoluting grid and their HLA restriction assessed by using a panel of cell lines harboring the HLA alleles of interest. Tumor-specific TCRs were identified by TCR αβ sequencing.\n\nResults: By longitudinal monitoring of T cell functionality and dynamics in 14 healthy donors, we isolated 19 WT1-specific TCRs which recognize several peptides restricted by 5 HLA alleles, and display a wide range of functional avidities, including some in the low nM range. TCR αβ sequencing at different time points enabled the longitudinal clonal tracking of the tumor-specific T cells and the correct pairing of TCR α and β chains, without the need of cell cloning nor single cell analysis. We selected two high avidity HLA-A*02:01-restricted TCRs specific for the less explored immunodominant WT137-45 epitope, naturally processed by primary AML blasts. With tailored, high precision CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tools, we combined TCR targeted integration into the TRAC locus with TRBC knock-out, thus avoiding the risk of TCR mispairing and maximizing TCR expression and function. The new cellular product, generated with a clinic-ready protocol in a 4-day span followed by a 6-10-day expansion, was enriched in memory stem T cells. Of note, one TCR showed antigen-specific responses in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and efficiently eliminated primary AML blasts, harvested from leukemic patients, in vitro and in vivo in the absence of off-tumor toxicity.\n\nConclusions: T cells engineered to express this receptor are being advanced into clinical development for AML immunotherapy and potentially other WT1-expressing tumors.\n\nDisclosure: A.

Fumigatus Pulmonary Infection Early After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n\nDalia Sheta1,2, Zeinab Mokhtari1, Marlene Strobel1,2, Yidong Yu1, Jorge Amish3, Nora Trinks4,2, Sina Thusek1, Hermann Einsele1, Katrin Heinze5, Ulrich Terpitz4, Andreas Beilhack1,2\n\n1 Würzburg University Hospital, Würzburg, Germany, 2 Graduate School of Life Sciences, Würzburg, Germany, 3 School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 4 Biocenter, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany, 5 Rudolf-Virchow-Center, University of Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany\n\nBackground: In the time window of bone marrow engraftment and immune reconstitution, patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) particularly are vulnerable to life-threatening opportunistic infections, such as invasive fungal infections of the lung. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) form a first-line defense in the lung and are tissue resident and not bone marrow derived. Here, we addressed how cytokines impact AMs function after allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) to improve protection from lethal lung infections.\n\nMethods: To investigate the effect of various cytokines, including M-CSF and IL-34 on primary AMs, we utilized super resolution and dynamic confocal microscopy to study AM phenotype, migration and phagocytic behavior in vitro. To study the outcome of exogenous cytokine stimulation on the pulmonary immune response in vivo we employed mouse models of allo-HCT (8 Gy TBI, C57Bl/6àBALB/c) and invasive A. fumigatus infection (survival, clinical performance, flow cytometry and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy of the lungs).\n\nResults: Allo-HCT recipients survived an intratracheal A. fumigatus infection when infected 6 days after allo-HCT but succumbed to lethal invasive aspergillosis when infected as early as 4 days after allo-HCT. 6 days after allo-HCT, tissue resident AMs showed the highest frequency, proliferation and phagocytic activity in the lung, when compared to neutrophils and monocytes, suggesting that AMs were responsible for protecting mice from lethal A. fumigatus infection. Therefore, we asked whether cytokines could boost AMs to achieve earlier protection after allo-HCT. Consequently, we screened the effects of various cytokines on AM function in vitro and observed that M-CSF increased AM’ migration speed (0.52 μm2/min) and versatility (diffusion co-efficient of 0.78) when compared to IL-34 (0.3 μm/min and 0.6, respectively) or mock controls. Notably, M-CSF mediated this functional gain specifically on lung-derived AM but not peritoneal macrophages.\n\nNext, we investigated whether M-CSF therapy can enhance pulmonary immune protection in vivo and prevent invasive aspergillosis early after allo-HCT. To test this, allo-HCT-recipients were treated with M-CSF and subsequently infected with A. fumigatus 4 days after allo-HCT. 3D microscopy and flow cytometry revealed that exogenous M-CSF not only boosted myelopoiesis by 2-fold but also expanded the local tissue-resident AM population in the lung by 1.5-fold. M-CSF improved the clinical performance of mice and protected 100% of allo-HCT recipients from an early A. fumigatus infection on day+4 after allo-HCT.\n\nConclusions: M-CSF treatment enhances lung-resident AM proliferation and function and protects from early A. fumigatus lung infection, which may benefit patients undergoing HCT.\n\nDisclosure: No conflicts of interest relevant to this study.\n\nO040. A Phase I Dose-Escalation Single Center Study To Evaluate The Safety Of Allogenic Memory T Cells Containing SARS-COV-2 Specific Lymphocytes As Adoptive Therapy in COVID19\n\nAntonio Pérez-Martínez1, Cristina Ferreras2, Marta Mora-Rillo1, Pilar Guerra1, Barbara Pascual-Miguel2, Carmen Mesrtre-Durán2, Alberto Borobia1, Antonio Carcas1, Irene Garcia1, Elena Zapardiel1, Mercedes Gasior1, Raquel de Paz1, Antonio Marcos1, José Luis Vicario1, Antonio Balas3, Cristina Eguizabal4, Carlos Solano5, Rocio Montejano1, José Ramón Arribas1, Bernat Soria6\n\n1 Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain, 2 Instituto de Investigación La Paz (idiPAZ), Madrid, Spain, 3 Centro de Transfusiones de la Comunidad de Madrid, Madrid, Spain, 4 Centro Vasco de Transfusion y Tejidos Humanos (CVTTH), Bilbao, Spain, 5 Hospital Clínico, Valencia, Spain, 6 Instituto de Investigacion Universidad Miguel Hernández de Alicante, Alicante, Spain\n\nBackground: We are in the second wave created by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) with no effective treatments for moderate/severe hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Memory T cells defined as CD45RA- T cells obtained from COVID-19 convalescent donors, may be useful to treat SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and/or lymphopenia because they retain SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells. In addition, the broad donor memory T cell repertoire may protect these vulnerable patients from other common viral co-infections. Adoptive infusion of memory T lymphocytes has been previously successfully reported improving pathogen-specific immune response after HSCT. We previously reported the existence of a SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell population within the CD45RA- T memory cells of the blood from the convalescent donors. These cells can be stored and be immediately available as an “off-the-shelf” COVID-19 convalescent donor-derived biobank. A wide number of doses can be easily manufactured using the CliniMACS Miltenyi device without the need for a GMP facility. With this approach, we can generate a biobank of \"living drugs\" containing SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells that can cover the country population based on the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genotype. In this study, we conducted a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial, dose-escalation study to evaluate the safety of a single infusion of CD45RA- memory T cells containing SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells from a COVID-19 convalescent donor as adoptive cell therapy against moderate/severe cases of COVID-19.\n\nMethods: Eligible participants were hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 by PCR suffering from pneumonia and lymphopenia related to COVID-19. Patients were enrolled based on the matched with the HLA genotype of the convalescent donor and following the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria. Participants were sequentially enrolled to receive a single infusion in a dose-escalating manner. All patients received the standard of care. Primary outcomes were to determine the safety of a single infusion of memory T cells from a healthy donor and the dose-limiting toxicity. Secondary outcomes were to evaluate time to lymphopenia recovery and immune dysregulation.\n\nResults: Nine patients were enrolled. The first 3 patients received 1x105 cells /kg, the next 3 patients received 5x105 cells/Kg and the last 3 patients received 1x106 cells/kg of CD45RA- memory T cells. Patients’ clinical status measured by NEWS and 7-category point ordinal scales showed an improvement 6 days after infusion. The median duration of hospitalization after the infusion was 8 days in the low dose group, 7 in the intermediate dose group, and 4 days in the high dose group. The inflammatory parameters were stabilized and they all showed lymphocyte recovery two weeks after infusion. Donor microchimerism was observed at least for 2 weeks after infusion.\n\nConclusions: Despite the small sample size, our study supports the idea that treatment of COVID-19 patients with moderate/severe symptoms using CD45RA- memory T cells is feasible, safe, and it is associated with quick clinical improvement and short hospitalization stays. In our study, neither patient had an infusion reaction, inflammatory impairment, or other serious adverse reaction. We are now opening a multicenter phase 2 study to show treatment efficacy.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NCT04578210\n\nDisclosure: Antonio Pérez- Martínez, Cristina Ferreras and Bernat Soria filed a patent on this topic.\n\nO041. Open Label Dose Escalation Trial of AB-205 (E-CEL® Cells) In Adults With Systemic Lymphoma Undergoing High-Dose Therapy And Autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HDT-AHCT)\n\nCarolyn Mulroney1, Michael Scordo2, Mehrdad Abedi3, Lihua E.

Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, United States\n\nBackground: HDT-AHCT is a standard curative therapy for patients with relapsed, high risk lymphomas. Severe regimen-related toxicities (SRRT) occur frequently after AHCT, leading to high symptom burden and potentially limiting wider use. The cause of SRRT is thought to be diffuse injury to the organ vascular endothelial niches caused by off-target cytotoxic effects of HDT. Organs with high cell turnover such as oral-gastrointestinal (GI) tract are most affected. The cytotoxic effect impairs the renewal of mucosa, leading to mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. With loss of mucosal integrity, translocation of gut flora into the systemic circulation may lead to life-threatening infections.\n\nAB-205 is an experimental engineered-cell therapy designed to repair damaged tissues and reduce SRRT. AB-205 contains E-CEL® cells: allogeneic E4+ human umbilical vein endothelial cells.\n\nMethods: AB-205 was administered intravenously 4 hours after AHCT in dose-escalated cohorts: 5, 10 and 20x106 cells/kg, either as single dose or divided (D0, D2). Objectives included safety and assessment of grade (G)≥3 AEs (NCI-CTCAE v5.0), oral/GI SSRT (G≥3: mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea) and time to engraftment. Supportive care was administered per local practice.\n\nA retrospective chart review (n = 45, 2019-2020) at a participating site served as a contemporary control.\n\nResults: As of 18-August 2020, 28 systemic lymphoma subjects were treated with AB-205 with a median (range) follow up of 104 (12, 399) days (Table).\n\nNo MTD has been reached. AEs were generally mild/moderate and as expected with HDT-AHCT. One subject relapsed (D101).\n\nAB-446p205 therapy demonstrated dose-dependent reduction of oral/GI SRRT (Figure) and all-grade oral/GI toxicities. The highest AB-205 dose (20 x 106 cells/kg) eliminated oral/GI SRRT. The G≥3 oral/GI SRRT event rate in the control cohort was 60%. A trend for a dose-dependent decrease in febrile neutropenia (FN) was observed (80%, 67% and 53% with 5, 10 and 20 x 106 cells/kg respectively). 71% of subjects had accelerated platelet engraftment, occuring within 1 day after neutrophil engraftment vs 16% in the control.\n\nRate of Severe (CTCAE Grade ≥ 3) Regimen-Related Oral/GI Toxicities\n\nG≥3 infection AEs within 28 days of AHCT were reported for only 1 subject. As of the above follow-up date, there have been no reports of severe regimen related toxicities affecting the pulmonary, cardiac, renal or hepatic systems.\n\nConclusions: Highest dose AB-205 eliminated oral/GI SRRT compared to 50-60% event rate seen in contemporary control cohort and previously published reports (Olivieri J, BBMT 2018; Perales MA, BBMT 2017). Severe infection rate was low which may reflect the accelerated repair of oral/GI mucosal lining. AB-205 will be assessed in a forthcoming pivotal randomized clinical trial for potential registration.\n\nClinical Trial Registry: NCT03925935\n\nDisclosure: Carolyn Mulroney has nothing to declare.\n\nMichael Scordo declares McKinsey and Company consultancy, Angiocrine Bioscience, Inc consultancy and research funding, Omeros corporation consultancy, Kite, A Gilead Sciences company, ad-hoc advisory board.\n\nMehrdad Abedi declares Abbvie speakers bureau, Settle Genetics speakers bureau, Takeda speakers bureau,BMS speakers bureau and research funding, Gilead Sciences speakers bureau and research funding.\n\nLihua E.

Orsola-Malpighi, Bologna, Italy\n\nBackground: Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) have provided a way to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for decades, but their role in the treatment strategy of acute leukemias (AL) is still poorly defined. We conducted a retrospective multicentre study including all consecutive pediatric and adult patients with AL who received DLIs after HSCT between January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2015, in order to determine the efficacy and the toxicity of the treatment.\n\nMethods: 252 patients, median age 45.1 years (1.6-73.4) were enrolled from 35 Italian Transplant Centres. Median follow-up was 878 days (55-6754) after HSCT. The main characteristics of patients, donors and transplants were provided by the Italian Registry; other DLI-specific information were requested to the centre in a study-specific database. OS was calculated from HSCT and first DLI, and the impact of prognostic factors was evaluated.\n\nResults: The underlying disease was AML in 180 cases (71%), ALL in 68 patients (27%), biphenotipic AL in 4 patients (2%). Donors were HLA identical sibling (39%), unrelated (40%) or "
