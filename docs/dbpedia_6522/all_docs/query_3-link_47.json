LAWREXCE ROTCH, Director of the Blue Hill Meteorological Obwervatory, dated Peptember 4,1902.An International Aeronautical Congress was held at BerlinBay 20 to 24,1902, on the occasion of the third meeting of thenternational Committee for Scientific Aeronautics, appointedby the Paris Meteorological Conference of 1896. Of this com-iittee there were present the president, Prof. Dr. Hergesell,f Strasburg, Prof. Dr. Asmmn and Mr. Berson, of Berlin,:enera1 Rykatchef and Colonel Howanko, of St. Petersburg,rofessor Cailletet and M. Teisserenc de Bort, of Paris, andhe writer, who is the American member. There were also Iresent at the Congress, by special invitation, about one hun-Ired military and civil aeronauts and representatives of mete-rological institutions, the writer representing the Unitedlbtes Weather Bureau by request of its chief.The opening of the Congress in the great hall of the Reichs-J ~Y , moa. MONTHLY WEATHER lavIEw. 367tag building was a brilliant event. Prince Frederiok Henryof Prussia, appeared for the Emperor of Germany. Both thcImperial and the Prussian governments were represented, andthe chief European nations, except France, sent the commanders or officers of their military balloon corps. After thtusual formal greetings, the representative of the PrussiaIMinister of Education spoke as follows:The Royal Government is much impressed with the importance ani necessity of an exchange of idem between the savants of all nations irmatters concerning meteorology and terrestrial magnetism, since inter. national cooperation in these branches of science is the indispensabltforerunner of progress. This was indeed recognized as early as 1780, b? the founding on German soil of the Societas meteoinlogica Palatine,which undertook the task of beginning systematic weather observationrin Europe, with the hope of extending them to other parts of the worldOn account of the existing state of afEaii.8 its efforts were of short du.ration and for a short time savants were allowed to labor independently. but with the foundation of inagnetic investigations by Gauss and Webei the sagacious idea of organization acquired new life and pressed io1realiiation, especially through the development of navigation, which her the greatest interest in the accurate observation of weather phenonienson the ocean. The antarctic discoveries of James Ross, and the sur. cessiul efforts of American navigators to shorten ocean voyages. gave a new impulse, and 80 there arose the proposition of organizing a niet,eoro.logical service at the f i r s t congress of tlie maritime nations held at Brus. sels in 1854, although it was not until 1873, during the Vienna Exposi.tion, that the flrst meteorological congress convened there laid the foun. dation of an international weather service. The international commit.tre,appointed at that time, met at first annually, but later at intervals of twr or three years. With its increasing activity the necessity of dividing the work manifested itself, and thus special coniniissions were formed.of which one meets here to-day and whose third gatheling will probabljbe as fruitful as i t s preceding meetings. In a field where there is ouljinterest in research may the bonds uniting the representatives of cul. t u r d nations ever become closer !In the name of the Prussian Meteorological Institute, itsdirector, Dr. von Bezold, spoke as follows:The ascensions of nianned balloons and kites have proved latterly a~ important means of exploring the atmosphere. Consequently. meteor. ology should rejoice in thin method of observation and nianifest itis in. terest by making use of the results. There is no doubt hut that the em-ployment of such aids became more necessary, when, tliivugh tlie foehiiphenomena, meteorologista flrst recognized the importance of ascending and descending currents and noticed that the formation of clouds has asclose a relation to the rising currents as has the flne weather t o tlie de.scending currents. Of the physical changes that are going on around ne in the atmosphere, a general theoretical picture could be gained, but the deeper understanding of tlie phenomena required that the observer, 01at least his instruments. should follow the rising and sinking air cur- rents and so furnish more exact conclusions about temperature and hu- midity. Precisely for the solution of questions relating to the vertical currents,the new methods of scientific aeronautics have rendered im-portant services and have given an insight into the mechanics of the phenomena that could not be gained in any other way. Howerer, all preceding results are only beginnings and here, as in other branches ofknowledge, it has proved to be the case that every fresh investigation raises new questions: in this case the relation of these vertical currentsto whirls of air, stratiflcation, etc. Earlier investigators had already perceived the importance of aeronaut,ics for meteorological researches. When Charles. the inventor of the hydrogen balloon, made his severalascensions in 1783, he took with him a barometer and a t,hermometer, as did the American aeronaut [Jeffries] who ascended from London during the same year.* It was not until very lately that Germany took part inthis work, or about the year 1880, but then with an instrument mark- edly superior, namely, Assmanns aspiration-psychromgter, aud through the muniticence of the German Emperor she was enabled to carry outthe work on a large scale. For the second time the representatives of scientific aeronautics now meet on German soil and thereby recognizethe import,ance of our efforts. But much indeed has been done for this new research by M. Teisserenc de Bort at Trappcs, near Paris, through the perfection of tho ballon-eon&, the unmanned balloon carrying self- recording instruments. and by Mr. Rotch, of Blue Hill, through his ap-plication of kites. Both methods are so good that by their use a great impetus has been given to meteorological research, whereby it is easily understood that there should be uniform rules for their employment. Looking backward it may be said that the international meetings for the organization of meteorological research, in 1854 at Brussels, in 1873 atVienna, and in 1879 at Rome, are landmarks in the progress of the science, and that when, in September, 1896, the International Committeefor Scientific Aeronautics was appointed. the plan hac1 teen 60 well con- sidered and the technical necessity was so evident tliat there was entire* See R. De C. Ward, in the Am. Met. Journal, Vol. IX, p. 58.-ED.46-3unanimity in the deliberations and reeolutions. The originator of the idea of the unmanned balloon was the late Gaston Tissandier, who en-t h u s i a s t i d y explained the scheme to the speaker in 1886, althoughnearly ten years elapsed before its realization. This work will be fruit- ful, for wind and clouds have no political boundaries and the sun belongsto us all. Consequently, we are all striving, for various reasons, to- ward the s e e goal, and the motto viribue unitie will be, as ever, the de- cisive measure of the result.Professor Cailletet, of Pans, responded for the foreignerspresent, and then Prof. Dr. Hergesell, after thanking the pre-ceding speakers, spoke as follows:As already indicated by Dr. von Bezold, the foundation, on wmmon principles, of an international union for scientiflc aeronautics was, to acertain degree, long since foreshadowed. Everywhere-in Paris, Stras- burg, Munich, St. Petersburg, and Berlin--seronautid experiments forthe scientiflc explomtion of the atmosphere had taken place, and since a general wish was espressed to unite the separate efforts in a wmmon cause, a favorable time to do this seemed to be in the autumn of 1896 at the conference in Paris of the directors of the meteorological institutes.France, the cradle of aeronautics, was the chosen ground, because there, independently of the German and Russian experiments, a molit prom-ising method of investigation had been developed that had already pro- duced good results; for the French experimenters, Colonel Charles Re- nard and Msssrs. Rermite and Besayon. all members of our Commis-sion. had simulhnwudy put into execution the plan of exploring the highest strata of the atmosphere with free balloons carrying only self-recording instruments. Not the least service of our Commission has IJWII to render the inethod of unmanned balloons comparable with the emct measurements in nianned halloons as they are niade in Berlin. The flrst task of the union was not to execute as many simultaneous manned and unmanned ascensions as possible, but rather to establish afoundation for such cooperat.ion by prescribing accurate instruments,built according to identical principles. During our flrst meeting, in April. 1898, at Strasburg, the dimcult problem of obtaining a uniforminstrunient.al equipment was solved in a general way. Since then our manned balloons, here and abroad, carry the aspiration-psychrometer,whidi Dr. Assmitnn, in cooperation with the late Captain von Sigsfeld, had devised. arid the uiinianned balloons are provided with the normalregistration apparatus which the indefatigable Teisserenc de Bort hasr!mstructed r30 skilfully. The registration balloon from that time has been the most powerful tool in dynaniical meteorology and has furnished tLstounding data for tlie cold atmospheric strata up to a height of 20kilometers. which are conflrined to a height exceeding 10 kilometers by the ascensions of the brave Berlin aeronauts, Berson and Suring,who have ascended so far in these regions. Since November, 1900, on the flrst Thursday of every month simultaneous ascensions have occurredin Paris, Strasburg, Munich, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Mos- cow, and on May 5, 19M, t.he 213th registration balloon of the Interna-tional Commission was sent up. What a tremeudous task, but how im- portant the results ! Until very recently it was assumed from Glaishersobservations that at no great height there prevailed, year in and yearout. all around tlie globe, a nearly constant temperature. Thisview has been proved wholly erroneous. The assunied nieteorological inaction at great height.s does not exist, for the changes as regards temperature areES great at 10,OOo nieters as at 4,000. A t the former height there &re differences of temperature between St. Pctersburg and Paris of 3O to 400centigrade. Furt,her, the observations have proved that the tempem ture does not steadily decrease upward, but that strata exist which often possess great differences of temperature. This stratiflcation is one of the most important, obj0ct.s of the present invest,igat.ion. And the future? Systematic meteorological research is at present carried on over only a small portion of the globe. Even in Europe, in the north there is lackingScandinavia, and in the south Italy and Spain; but the presence of repre- sentatives of these countries at our meeting gives the hope of speedy co- operation. A plan for a nieteorological cruise of a steamer to fly kites will also be discussed, for the meteorological exploration of the Tropicsmust be extended, and tlie participation of England in our endeavors$ves UR hope that India niay be claimed as a region for investigation.Per q e r a ad nstm-that may be setting our goal too high, but, per aeperod aha et +pwtns regimea, up to the regions which hide the great secret where the weather conies from-that we certainly should flr as our goal!At the first meet- ing of the Committee the following fifteen persons, nominatedPS members of the Committee, mere elected by the Congress:Director Palazzo of the Central Meteorological Office and MajorBorgatti from Italy; Director Arcimis of the MeteorologicalInstitute and Major Vivez y Vich from Spain; Secretary ShewDf the London Meteorological Office, the Presidents of theBritish Meteorological and Aeronautical Societies, and MajorTrollope, from Great Britain; General Neureuther, President .of the Aeronautical FJociety of Munich; Inspector EusnetzofThe scientific sessions were now begun.368 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW. JULY, 1902of the Russian Meteorological Service ; Captain Weber, ofBavaria, Major Klussman and Captain Gross of Berlin, Direc-tor von Konkoly and Dr. von Tolnay of the Hungarian Me-teorological Office. Among the first questions to be discussedwas the landing of manned balloons in foreign countries.After a long debate, the following resolution was adopted:66 The Commission expresses the wish that through diplomaticchannels negotiations should be undertaken authorizing thenecessary scientific apparatus to be carried in its ascensions.When landing in a foreign country, if difficulties arise overthe photographic plates they are to be delivered for examina-tion or development to a competent official to be named by theCommission. \" As regards the question of obtaining means topublish regularly the observations made during the simulta-neous ascents, it was resolved that a regular oflicial publica-tion is indispensable.At the second meeting Dr. Assmann presented a new vol-ume containing the results of the work, for the two years end-ing last autumn, at the Aeronautical Observatory near Berlin,maintained by the Prussian Meteorological Institute.General Rykatchef, Director of the Central Physical Observa-tory at St. Petersburg, spoke on the preliminary results attainedwith kites, balloons-sondes, and manned balloons during the pastfive years in Russia. Scientific aeronautics in Russia dateonly from 1899, with the exception of some years of pre-paratory work. Still there have been a large number of as-censions; 13 of the 60 kite-flights were above 3.000 meters,while the ballons-sondrs reached 14,200 meters. The inclementclimate of Russia occasions inany unusual difficulties, for in-stance, the kite wire on the reel becomes thickly coated withfrost, rendering the unwinding difficult, or both wire andkites in the air are so thickly incrusted with frost work (fivemillimeters or more) that the kites often fall to the ground.Kites were used chiefly at the stations in Pavlosk ancl St.Petersburg, and thereby special details were obtained inthe lower strata of the diurnal and annual influence on thevertical decrease of temperature up to 3,000 meters. I twas found that in summer and during the daytime the de-crease of temperature with increasing height proceeds morerapidly, and, on the contrary, that in winter and during thenight hours there are large inversions of temperature. Inanticyclones large inversions occur in the lower strata and arapid decrease of temperature in the higher strata. Often, inthe space of a few minutes there were observed great fluctua-tions of temperature caused by different currents, ancl the studyof temperature inversions showed that these take place atgreater and greater heights as the time of day is later. Chn-eral Rykatchef exhibited an anemometer, constiucted by hisassistant, Mr. Kusnetzof. for the registration of wind pressureduring kite flights. The instiument has bridled Robinsoncups which act like a dynamometer, ancl record the gusts ofwind on a revolving drum. In closing, the speaker announcedthat the Czar had given a considerable sum of money for tliecontinuation of this investigation of the different strata of theatmosphere in Russia by means of balloons and kites.M. Teisserenc de Bort, of Pans, presented the results of hisobservations on the decrease of temperature in the high atmos-phere, as obtained from the ascensions of 268 /d I J )I X -K O t l I /P ~,which had reached or esceed 11,000 meters, the total number ofascensions being 540, all of which were made at night to avoiclthe effect of insolation. The concordant and remarkable result is that in the layer between 8,000 and 9,000 meters the decreaseof temperature becomes slower, ceasing entirely at 11,000 me-ters, while above that height a warning may set in, with fluctu-ations of 1' to 3' centigrade, making the temperature here onthe average nearly constant. In the summer this isothermal layer appears to lie somewhat higher, or between 13,000 and14,000 meters. It is lower duiing the prevalence of a clepres-sion, but 4,000 meters higher during a high pressure, ao thatthe zone exceeds the height of the cirrus clouds. The loweattemperatures, occurring in a high pressure, were -67' and-72', but in March the exceptionally low temperature of- 75' centigrade was observed. Whether the absolute mini-mum of temperature has been reached here requires furtherproof and as to the cause of this striking phenomenon thereare only conjectures. Have we at these great heights aerialconditions working on a grand scale, where the cyclonic whirlsof the lower atmosphere do not penetrate and the currents flowuninterruptedly, and must we assume, with Maxwell, that thereare stages in molecular movement where gravity and its attend-ant phenomena no longer act?Prof. Dr. Assmann said that in a memoir on this subjectwhich he had presented to the Berlin Academy of Scienceshe showed that the observations of the Berlin Aeronautical Ob-servatory, although obtained by a somewhat different method,led to the same conclusion as that which had been reachedat Trappea. Above 10,000 meters the temperature oscillatesand does not appear to decrease, although beyond the variablestratum, at 17,000 meters, and recently as high as 19,500 meters,the temperature was again found to decrease, so that the possi-bility of an absolute minimum of temperature is by no means ex- 'chided. The Berlin observations were executed with speciallyconstructed balloons of Para rubber, which entirely avoided inthe daytime the influence of solar radiation on the instrument,which was also inclosed in double polished tubes. During thea i s high ascensions, of which the observations have been re-duced, the results stated by Teisserenc de Bort were confirmedand rises of temperature amounting to go, with the clecreasesof temperature already mentioned at still greater heights, werefound. During the high ascension of Berson and Siiring onJuly 31,1901, the temperature of -40' was read at the identi-cal height where the thermograph of a registration balloon,sent up at the same time, recorded -38.4'. Berson thinks itprobable that the increased warmth of the anticyclone ceasesbetween 6,000 and 8,000 meters and at greater heights the airin the anticyclone becomes colder than that in the cyclone.Professor Palazzo, director of the Central MeteorologicalOffice at Rome, announced that Italy would now participatein the international scientific exploration of the atmosphere.Through the aid of the Minister of Agriculture three stationsfor kites are proposed; one on Mount Cimone (2,165 meters),another on Etna (2,942 meters), and a third outside of Rome,near the Fort of Monte Mario. The Minister of War hasordered that the ascensions by officers of the balloon corpsshall take place on the days of the international ascents.Information was given about the observatory for the studyof the physics of the atmosphere, now in construction onMonte Rosa at a height of 4,660 meters, which is expected tobe completed nest summer. The observer is to be a scientificespert who, in addition to making the usual observations, willundertake scientific researches, remaining all summer at theobuervatory and going up as often as possible in winter. Theobservatory will also be open to other scientific men. In con-nection with this communication there was a discussion con-cerning the interest of scientific aeronautics in physiologicalinvestigations which will form an important part of the workof the high-work observatory mentioned. Professor Zuntz,who had passed eight days on Monte Rosa, stated that not-withstanding the much diminished quantity of oxygen in theair there is a great increase in the amount of oxygen used bythe human organism, an effect that had not been observedwhen the atmospheric pressure was artificially reduced at lowlevels, and the cause of which is of vital interest to the aero-naut. Dr. von Schriitter, of Vienna, pointed out that the utudyof the cheiuical intensity of the light in the spectrum at greatheights was one of the tasks for a high-level observatory whichinterested also the aeronaut. The photographic plate furnishes'JULY, 1902. MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW. 369employ the most sensitivi andthe best means for the study of chemical climate, but a dis-tinction must be made between upper and lower light, the lat-ter being reflected from the clouds and probably acting chem-ically in a different way from the first, permitting, however,conclusions to be drawn as to the absorbing power of cloudstrata. It appeared from the remarks made on this commnuni-cation, that already in Berlin and Munich researches are inprogress with photographic plates to record the action of theultra-violet rays.Prof. Dr. Assmann, Director of the Aeronautical Observatoryof the Prussian Meteorological Institute, described his regis-tration balloon of caoutchouc or Para rubber, which was oneof the novelties of the meeting: The ordinary balhn-somk,made of silk or paper and open at the bottom, has the greatdisadvantage that, when it approaches equilibrium in the upperstrata of the atmosphere, its velocity of ascent decreases andthe eEect of insolation on the thermograph becomes greater,without it being possible to determine afterwards the placewhere the solar disturbance began duiing the ascent or whereit disappeared during the descent; in fact, it is only in certaincases that we can distinguish between the insolation influenceand the curious thermal anomalies that have been descril〉eclby Teisserenc de Bort ancl Hergesell. The use of a closedballoon made of elastic material has this advantage, that inproportion as the inclosed gas expands, the ascensional forceis increased so that the balloon rises faster with augmentingheight until it bursts and then falls to the ground with dimin-ishing velocity, because checked by a parachute. The t;ime ofequilibrium is therefore reduced to an instant, and althoughthe higher the altitude the more intense is the solar radiationand its effect on the thermograph, yet the speed of ascent ancldescent is also increased and, consequently, the ventilation,which counteracts the radiation, is likewise stronger. Theleast possible weight of balloon envelope and of regis teringapparatus is required, for the lighter the whole apparatus, theless gas is needed, and the smaller the quantity of gas themore it can expand before the envelope bursts at a propor-tionally greater height. The meteorograph of Dr. Assmannhas no clock movement, the time being unimportant; but adisk is turned by the metallic thermometer while the barome-ter draws a pen horizontally across the disk, and so the spiralcurve indicates heights and corresponding temperatures. Theapparatus exhibited weighed but 380 grams, and with the pro-tecting basket, 500 grams. 8ince ink would freeze at greatelevations the trace is made by a pen containing a solutionof saltpeter, which writes on the disc coated with lampblack,treated with a solution of r r tonsol. The chemical reactiongives a red trace that can not be obliterated by handling norby immersion in water. The time required for an ascent to15,000 meters is about one hour ancl for the descent two hours,so that the balloons do not travel very far and are usually re-covered within three clays. The diameter of the envelope atthe start is 1 or 2 meters only, and it does not require to becompletely filled with hydrogen to exert the necessary initiallift of 2 or 3 kilograms. A balloon with a diameter of 1 meter,when expanded to 2 meters has its volume increased eighttimes and consequently should rise until the atmospheric pres-sure is one-eighth, or to a height of about 15,000 meters. Aballoon formed by dipping a mold into a solution of Pararubber, was expanded to sisty-four times its original volumebefore it burst, which indicated that it would have risen to about38,000 meters.Dr. Valentin, of Vienna, spoke on the sluggishness of ther-mographs in registration balloons, which he had investigatedby esposing the Richard thermographs alternately to the ac-tion of cold end warm currents of varying velocity and com-paring the time necessaiy to acquire the temperatures shownbv sensitive mercurial thermometers. Prof. Dr. Hergesellservatfons over theaccurate thermometers ratlier than to try to determine thecorrections for sluggishness. He exhibited such an instru-ment, as did Teisserenc de Bort. The French instrument hasthe Bourdon tube insulated by a block of hard rubber, whichprevents the injurious conduction of heat. Comparisons be-tween an instrument insulated in this way and one not insu-lated gave differences which increased with the height of theballoon and at 12,000 to 16,000 meters reached 6O, an amountthat justified the insulation. Prof. Dr. Hergesell spoke on thesame subject in connection with a model of his new baro-thermograph for balloons-sondes. A metal strip is sensitive tochanges of temperature in proportion as its weight is lessand its surface is greater, consequently in his thermographa very thin German silver tube is inclosed in a larger tube.To transmit the changes in length of the inner tube to therecording pen nickel-steel is employed, because this alloy hasa very small coeficient of expansion. He has compared thisapparatus with a thermograph of Teisserenc de Bort, carriedby the same paper balloon and ventilated in the same way,and has found that during the ascent the first always gavelower values than the last, that is to say, it was more sensi-tive, and only at the maximum height, where the apparatusremained for some time at the same level, did the recordsapproach each other. This apparatus seems also applicableat central stations where very sensitive thermometers are em-ployed to record brief changes of temperature. It was recom-mended that comparative tests of the instruments of Assmann,Hergesell, and Teisserenc de Bort should be made when at-tached to the same balloon and that comparative readings ofthe two last instruments should be executed at night, to avoiderrors due to insolation, at the stations of Berlin, Strasburg,and Paris. In connection with this subject, Captain von Parse-val mentioned a thermometer with which his late colleague,Captain von Sigsfeld. had experimented, that was based onentirely different principle, namely, the alteration in the spe-cific weight of air with change of temperature. Major Vivezy Vich exhibited a r r statoscope, invented by Captain Royas,designed to show the aeronaut whether his balloon was risingor falling, and Mr. Patrick Alexander, of Bath, England, de-scribed an apparatus to control the motor of a flying machinefrom the earth by using Hertzian waves.At the third meeting the subject of kites and kite stations,was opened with a paper by the writer on the exploration ofthe atmosphere over the ocean. The use of the kite on landis limited to favorable circumstances, since the wind must havea velocity of at least 5 or 6 meters per second to raise the kitesand can not exceed a certain maximunl strength without endan-gering the wire by an excessive pull. At sea, however, themotion of a steamer at a velocity of 10 or 12 knots, will almostalways produce a suitable kite wind, if it does not alreadyesist. In order to denionstrate this, in August, 1901, the writercrossed the North Atlantic on a steamer and found five outof eight days suitable for flying kites. Only on one day wasthe relative wind too light and on two days too strong, butthe wind would always have been favorable had it been poe-sible to alter the course of the vessel. These successful re-sults led the writer to propose a meteorological liite expedi-tion to the trade wind and equatorial regions of the AtlanticOcean, where almost nothing is known of the upper currents.To defray part of the expense application has been made tothe Carnegie Institution for a grant of $10,000, but it wasconsidered that the recommendation of the present Congressmight aid in secuiing favorable action. Applause showedthe approval of the meeting, which was voiced by Drs. vonBezold and Hergesell. The former, especially, pointed outthe importance and the pressing need of meteorological ob- bilieved that it was better to ocean, where, in consequence Of other360 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW. JULY, 1902methods of warming and cooling the air, very diflerent condi-tions must exist than prevail over the land, and our ignoranceof them ie no longer to be tolerated. Professor Hoppen, oiHamburg, expressed himself in a similar manner and madethe interesting announcement that according to the programmeof the Scandinavian Hydrographic Congress to explore theBaltic and North seas in the interest of the fisheries, fourcruises a year were proposed on which meteorologists wouldbe given an opportunity to study the atmosphere above theseseas. Therefore the Deutsche Seewarte will cooperate andthe speaker expected to fly kites on the first voyage of thepresent summer. Professor Wagner, of the University oiGijttingen, said that the Gottingen Society of Sciences had, aithe request of the Aeronautical Committee, furnished the geo-physical expedition which was sent to Samoa about a year agounder the leadership of Dr. Tetens with kites and instrumentsin order to obtain meteorological observations above thatisland and on the return voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Dr.Hergesell mentioned that on the Lake of Constance meteoro-logical kite flights were to be undertaken, Count von Zeppelinfurnishing the vessel and the meteorological service of Alsace-Lorraine the apparatus. General Rykatchef promised on thepart of the Russian Government that similar observationswould be executed over the northern portion of the Baltic aawell as over the Black Sea. On motion of Dr. Hergesell theplan of Mi. Rotch for a meteorological kite-expedition in theSouth Atlantic was fully approved, and the hope was es-pressed that with the aid of government funds the projectmight be realized in the near future. Mr. Berson remarkedthat it was of the greatest importance that the British as wellas the Dutch governments should encourage meteorologicalobservations in the monsoon region, and Major Trollop, speak-ing for Great Britain, said that he would endeavor to havethis done. Professor Koppen mentioned his work with kitesat Hamburg and presented a publication in the hcliiv derDeutschen Seewarte describing it. He also stated thatthrough Scandinavian and French cooperation, effected by M.Teisserenc de Bort, kite flights would be macle at Viborg,in Jutland, during the next year, simultaneously with thoseat Hamburg and Berlin, so that interesting sections of thebarometric depressions traversing north Germany woulclprobably be obtained. Dr. Hergesell, for lack of time with-drew his paper on mountain kite stations, and only mentionedthat kite flights hac1 been made from the Grosse Belchen(1,433 meters) in the Vosges Mountains. These numerouscommunications show the wide extension of meteorological kiteflying in Europe over land and sea.M. Teisserenc de Bort showed a diagram of the results ob-tained from continuous soundings of the atmosphere, or thosemade as frequently as possible at his observatory at Trappesduring thirty-ais days in January and February, 1901, whenkites and registration balloons (ballms-sondes) were sent almostdaily into the higher atmosphere to an extreme height of 13,000meters. The plotted results throw doubt on the assumptionthat the barometric depressions bring higher temperatures andthe barometric masima lower temperatures and give an in-teresting demonstration of the diversity and complexity of theatmospheric phenomena of which it is the aim of internationalaeronautics to ascertain the laws. The speaker urged thenecessity of these frequent soundings, and Dr. Hergesell re-plied that, although this ideal exploration of the atinospherewas not so easily attainecl, still the simultaneous ascensionsmight serve a similar purpose.*The fourth meeting was principally occupied with the sub-ject of high ascents. Professor Cailletet, of Paris, showed hisapparatus for breathing oxygen at grent altitudes. The chief disadvantage of the methods hitherto employed in ballooningconsists in the fact that the gas is carried in a compressedstate, whereby, since at each breath several liters of gas areused, strong and heavy receptacles axe required. If, on thecontrary, liquified oxygen is taken, which has almost the samedensity as water, proportionately small vessels are needed, andthese can be given any convenient form. M. Cailletet employsthe ordinary pear-shaped glass flask, having double walls sepa-rated by an air space and silvered externally, in order that theliquid osygen in it shall be protected from the conduction ofexternal heat and from solar radiation, and thereby kept in aliquid conilition. By working a rubber bulb the liquid gas isdriven through a narrow tube, connected with the interior ofthe flask, into a system of tubes having a larger amount ofsurface. Here it evaporates and in a gaseous state passesthrough flexible tubes into a caoutchouc reservoir thathangs from the ring of the balloon and is protected by a netagainst bursting. Thence the gas, after it has been mixed withatmospheric air, passes to the breathing mask. The maskis fastened by elastic bands in front of the face, so that theaeronaut is always forced to breathe oxygenized air. At thelower part of this mask there is an outlet tube for the expiredgases, which is ingeniously arranged so that during inspira-tion the lower end is automatically closed, and, in order thatthe expired vapor may not be frozen after condensation andso stop up the tube, its lower end is placed under the clothing.In the discussion Dr. von Schrotter reminded his hearersthat it was Paul Bert who had first called attention to the factthat the want of oxygen was the cause of the pathologicalsymptoms which man showed in rarified air. In regard to theopinion held by some Alpinists as to the inefficiency of oxygen,Professor Zuntz remarked that the erhaustion of the heart,which was not counteracted by breathing oxygen, gives riseto the same symptoms as does the lack of oxygen.Dr. Suring spoke on the ascension which he had made withMr. Berson on July 31, 1901, to the height of 10,800 meters,the greatest height yet reached by man. He insisted uponthe importance of such high ascents to control the observa-tions otherwise obtained and to make those that require directvision. Especially are the strata from 6.000 to 10,000 metersnot yet adequately esplored, and for weather changes they areof great importance, as is indicated by the scarcity of cloudsuear 4,000 meters and above 6,000 meters. However, thegreatest caution is necessary in these dangerous high ascen-sions, and all precautions should be carefully followed. Thespeaker explained the causes of sickness in the upper air, basedon his own esperience. Dr. von Schrotter also spoke on thephysiology of hi@ ascenh. His experiments to a height of7,500 meters in a balloon, and under a pressure of 230 milli-meters of mercury in a pneumatic cabinet, confirmed the classicones of Paid Bert as regards breathing oxygen, but there isatill another k i d of sickness at great heights, consisting inthe formation of larger nitrogenous globules in the blood thancan be taken care of in a normal way when the atmosphericpressure is diminished, and the pressure of these globules dis-turbs the nervous centers and occasions symptoms of paralysis.Great rarifaction of the air, when of short duration, has nomarked influence on the number of red corpuscles. From aphysiological standpoint there is still much to be investigated,uotably as to endurance of cold, dampness, and light at highhltitudes. Dr. von Schrotter exhibited a breathing mask ofh i s own, which was to be tried the 8ame day, together withthe mask of M. Cailletet, during a balloon ascension.After Dr. Siirings paper, a telegram was sent to. JamesGlaisher in London from the scientific aeronauts of Europe,America, and Asia, in congress assembled, expressing theiradmiration and remembrance of this distinguished Nestor ofmeteorologists.* After the days programme had been com-pleted, Count von Zeppelin called the attention of aeronauts to* Mr. Glaisher was born in Scotland in 1809.-E~.Jay, 1902. MONTHLY WEATHER =W. 361a means of showing the existence of vertical currents of air byobserving birds of prey hovering over mountains, for where abird soars there must be a rising current, and hence ascentsof balbns-sondm in such localities might prove of interest.Lieutenant von Lucanus, in the name of the German Ornitho-logical Society, asked aeronauts to observe the various heightsat which birds are found. It is now supposed that the heightabove the ground at which birds fly does not generally exceed400 meters, and only occasionally reaches 2,000 meters, thezone usually remaining below the lower clouds. Htill, muchuncertainty prevails concerning the tracks of birds, and espe-cially the heights of flights, and information is greatly desired.The fifth session was mostly devoted to a discussion ofobservations of atmospheric electricity and terrestrial mag-netism in balloons. Dr. Hergesell esplained that electricalmeasurements are of such vital interest that the academies ofBerlin, Munich, Gottingen, Leipzig, and Vienna were to havebeen represented at this meeting by Professors von Bezolcl,Ebert, Wagner, Wiener, and Exner. The latter, who is theNestor of this branch of physics, was prevented from attend-ing, but Professor Elater, of Wolfenbuttel, was present amongthe experts. Professor Ebert, of Munich, said that constitu-ents containing electrical charges had been found recently inthe air through their physical properties. These carriers ofelectricity are called c r ions, or, more correctly, r c electrons.At the earths surface their presence may be shown by thedissipation apparatus of Elater and Geitel, and the smallestquantity of electricity may be recorded by means of an elec-trometer. The speaker had adapted this apparatus for use inballoons, and by employing an aspirator a fixed quantity ofair could be drawn over the dissipating body and absolutemeasurements made of the amount of free electricity containedin a cubic meter of air. It is of importance in geophysics toknow how the capacity of the air for positive and negativeelectrons varies with altitude and therefore the speaker hadmade such determinations, finding near the earth many morepositive than negative electrons, but whether this is a resultof the negatively charged earth is uncertain. I n the highstrata the inequality tends to disappear, but considerationsthat throw doubt on the balloon observations relate partly tothe electrical discharges produced by the ultra-violet lightrays and partly to the indeterminate moment of aspirationin a rising or falling balloon. Professor Ebert considered thecooperation of aeronauts valuable, and cited as a result ofthe investigation in the Alps that in the foehn wind an excessof positive electrons is found and this clisturbance of the elec-trical equilibrium perhaps may cause the foehn sickness. Pro-fessor Elater desclibed two experiments that proved the ex-istence of the electrons, one being the radiation of Becquerelrays after two hours from an insolated and stretched copperwire charged with 2,000 volts. It was agreed by both expertsthat the cleaner and clearer the air the more electrons it con-tains. Dr. Caspari, of Berlin, said he had ascertained, duringa physiological excursion in the high mountains, that it wasnot so much the absolute number of ions as the preponder-ance of those of the same sign which had a physiologicalinfluence.Dr. von Bezold mentioned an investigation of the relation be-tween the foehn and richness in electrons thnt was nndertaken,at his suggestion, by Professor Czermak, of Innahruck, whichshowed that the air brought d o ~m by the foehn from abovecarries a greater quantity of ions into the lower air. ancl so,very probably, there is a similarity between sickness causedby altitude ancl the well known effect of the foehn on livingorganisms. In conclusion, Professor Ebert said that the quan-tity of electrons in the atmosphere seems to have no effect onbodies, but only the violent changes of equilibrium so acted,and therefore an interesting field in the measurement of thedissipation effect was opened for research in balloons. In re-sponse to a request from the Academy of Science, the commit-tee resolved to undertake measurements of atmospheric elecl-tricity in the international balloon ascents. Professor Palazzoexhibited, for use in balloons, a modification of Exners elec-trometer, that gave a continuous photographic record. Dr.uon Bezold thought it very desirable that the observations inballoons should include measusements of dissipation as well aschanges of potential at different heights. Dr. Linke, of Pots-clam, reported the results of his electrical measurements inballoons up to a height of nearly 6,000 meters. Five of theascents were to determine the fall of potential and a i s were tostudy the electrons. I n brief, his conclusions were that thereis an increase of positive electrons with height in every weathercondition, but a relation of the good or bad conductivity ofthe air to its greater or less transparency. The vertical move-ment of the balloon introduces errors in the electrometerreadings that can hardly be avoided and the speaker cautionedhis hearers against intrusting the difficult measurements ofdissipation to inexperienced observers. Professor Ebert thendescribed an apparatus for determining in a balloon the horizon-tal magnetic intensity, which is an improvement of the Heyd-weiler instrument and permits changes of intensity to bemeasured without knowing either the astronomical or mag-netic meridan. This has not only a high scientific importancebut may be of practical importance as affording a method ofdetermining the position of a balloon when within the clouds,or over the sea, or at night. Dr. Marcuse, of Berlin, exhibiteda simple instrument that was recommended for general use, bywhich the aeronaut may ascertain his position from the alti-tude of either the sun or moon or two fixed stars.Dr. Kassner, of the Prussian Meteorological Institute, sug-gested the application of kites and kite-balloons to a series ofproblems as follows:Pliy,uic.s.-The measurement of the velocity of sound in thefree air is important, in meteorology, for example, for thetheory of thunder. It requires a knowledge of the density ofthe atmosphere and this must be calculated from the pressure,temperature, and humidity. Formerly these elements weredetermined at the ends of a baue line, which ends were usuallyon mountain summits. The intervening air stratum can nowbe accurately investigatecl and, consequently, the measurementof the velocity of sound will be more accurate.G:rw&ay ntid nstrotwttiy.-A knowledge of the conditions pre-vailing in the stratum of air traversed by the ray of light isneeded for the computation of atmospheric refraction, and thiscan easily be obtained by a kite or a captive balloon.hail shooting registering instruinents can be sent up on kites or on captii-eballoons to determine whether the aerial whirls produced bythe hail-cannon really extend up to the clouds, a questionthat is still awaiting solution.This completed the programme of papers, but DirectorArchenhold, of the Treptow Observatory at Berlin, called atten-tion to the probable production, by the volcanic eruptions inthe West Indies, of the sanie phenomenon of luminous dust-clouds in the highest air strata that were seen for years afterthe great outbreak of Krakatoa in 1883. If the developmentproceeds as it did then, we should have first brilliant and long-continued twilight phenomena, while the lower strata are filledwith dust, ancl sometime afterwards the luminous clouds at aheight of 80 kilometers. Since it is probable that aeronautsmay first discover this phenomenon during high night ascentsthe speaker requested that it should be watched for and thiswas promised.undergoing certain modifications, were ailopted by the Commit-tee in executive session, the Congress itself being only a con-ilIeteorvlog!y.-For studying the action ofBefore closing the Congress the resolutions proposed, after .362 MONTHLY WEATHEX3 REVIEW.

Besides the resolutions mentionedalready it was determined that the international ascents of bal-loons and kites during the next year should take place, as hasbeen the case this year, on the first Thursday of every monthand that at least one of the balkis-sowdes liberated at any stationshould be sent up one hour before sunrise in order that itsrecords may not be affected by solar radiation, and also thatthe balloon may be seen when it falls to earth in the earlymorning. The Richard thermograph, with Teisserenc de Bortsinsulating device, should be used and the Hergesell instrumenthaving a tube of German silver, instead of the Bourdon tube,filled with alcohol, was also recommended on account of its sen-sitiveness and durability. Ascensions at other hours and withdifferent apparatus are discretionary. The president, Prof. Dr.Hergesell, in summing up the results of the Congress, which heregarded as eminently satisfactory, laid special importance onthe meteorological kite flights that were proposed over seas,lakes, and mountains, and hoped that the British Government,by similar work in India, would help in the investigation of thegreat Asiatic monsoon region. A grant of money was requestedfrom the German Government to enable the Prussian Meteoro-logical Institute to cooperate with the writer in his proposedinvestigation of the atmosphere over the Atlantic Ocean. Itwas announced that in order to facilitate international re-searches in scientific aeronautics, the formation of an organiza-tion, sustained by the various European nations. would beattempted. The Congress was then closed with the usualvotes of thanks.ON T m UALIFORNIA CHARTS OF RAINFALL.By ALEXANDEB G. MCADIE ProPeewor aud Section Director, United States Weather Bbreno. dnted Augllxt 20, 1902.Referring to the symposium on ( Rainfall and charts of rain-fall, in the MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW for Apiil, 1902, I re-spectfully refer to the map published in the Annual Summaryfor 1900, of the California Section of the Climate and CropService, where it will be noted that in charting rainfall dueallowance has been made for the topography of the State.The intimation by Mr. Henry Gannett, on page 224, that inpreparing our rainfall maps we only consider the rain gagemeasurements, is hardly fair to the California service, for thereason that the isohyets in this State have, during the pastthree or four years, been drawn with special reference to theorography. We do not show the area of the precipitationover the Sierra Nevada to be the same as that measured atFresno, Stockton, or Owens Lake. Mr. Cfannett must havebeen unaware of the methods followed at this oflice in chart-ing rainfall, and I will be glad to have his attention called tothis matter, as I am sure that he will appreciate our methodA relief map of the State is always placed underneath the tis-sue paper chart of the State on which the rainfall data areassembled.On page 225 Mr. F. H. Newell is likewise in error in hisstatement that the rainfall maps of the Weather Bureau,while undoubtedly good for the more thickly settled partsof the United 8tates are very misleading for the western two-fifths of the country because the great mountain ranges areignored. On page 226 Mr. Newell suggests that some onefamiliar with the topography should sketch the rainfall imp.It is believed that this is not nearly so good as the methodwhich we have followed for years.After carefully reading the symposium published in theMONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW on lC Rainfall and charts of rainfall,I fail to see wherein the chart of precipitation published bythe California Section can be improved under the presentlimitations of our knowledge. It would be unwise to makeuse of an indefinite factor Based upon the element of forestrt-tion. *. Gannetts contention that certain timber beltsPage 206 Monthly Weather Review for April, 1902.upon the Bierra Nevada might be utilized in drawing theisohyets fails to find support in the views of Professor Good-ale, Professor Sargent, Professor Merriam, Professor Fernow,and our forester, Mr. Pinchot. To introduce such a factorwould certainly make the map of rainfall in California, in thewords of Dr. Hann, IC a subjective work of the imagination.As an illustration of the uncertainties attending forest growthand its relation to rainfall I would call attention to a redwoodgrove on the windward side of Mount Tamalpais. The rain-fall from May until October is nil, but below the crest of themountain dense fog prevails in great bltmkets. The crownsof the redwood trees, averaging possibly 200 feet from theground, are bathed in moisture for from five to eight hoursnearly every day during the summer months. The characterof +e forest here is, therefore, largely determined by temp-erature, humidity, and shelter from high winds rather thanrainfall.With reference to Mr. Newells contention that our rainfallrecords are not kept with that degree of accuracy which weprofess (see page 826), I would say that in California wehave many earnest rainfall observers who for long years havemaintained records which I believe will compare favorablywith any set of instrumental records maintained by any insti-tution in the world. Our records show cases where observershave carefully measured the dimensions of their collectors andreceivers, and finding a difference in the third or fourth deci-mal place from the figures given by our Instrument Divisionhave reported the same to this oflice.Again on page 285 Mr. Newell contends that our rainfallmaps are inisleading in that few, if any stations, can be usedin accurately measuring the amount of water dowing frommountain streams. Possibly the methods employed in meas-uring the total volume of discharge of these streams for ayear are st fault.The hydrographer assunies that mountains necessarily causea rainfall divide. In a State like California with mountainsystems running at various angles to the prevailing air move-ment, and where wind circulations are frequently reversed withseaHonal changes, the determination of average rainfall is adifficult problem. The greatest rainfall may or may not occurbeyond the crest of a given range. Should it occur on theside of the divide farthest from the origin of the rain bearingwinds any argument based upon elevation and the run-off ina given watershed would be untenable.I have in reoent conversation with Mr. Newell called his at-teiition to the care with which the isohyets have been drawnin California, and I now understand that his criticism did notapply to California. We are indeed only too thankful to haveour work criticized if the criticism shall lead to improvement.In place of the suggestion of Messrs. 〈+annett and Newellthat our rainfall charts be modified so as to obtain the rela-tions between the flow of streams, the altitude, the vegetation,and the rainfall (see page 206), would it not be better to be-gin a systematic study of the forces at work in the formation .of the raindrop ? Then, possibly, we shall be able to discussintelligently the true values to be allowed for the influence offorests, mountains, timber belts, etc. From the office of theWeather Bureau at San Francisco one can see day after dayvast quantities of condensed mater vapor passing inland, un-dergoing many changes and yet without resulting precipita-tion. Even if this fog and vapor could be measured it wouldbe improper to allow for it in drawing the rain chart, and yetit plays an important part in modifying climate.In conclusion, I repeat that the isohyets in California havebeen drawn with care, and as much allowance made for topo-graphy as the present state of our howledge permits. Everyeffort will be made to maintain rainfall data of a high degreeof accuracy. The criticism of our maps was made without a* * * * * * *.,"
