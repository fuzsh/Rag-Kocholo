        "text": "Our reporter asked... you answered\n\nOur football news reporter Nick Mashiter says \"there will be hope Wolves can keep the pace in the race for Europe this time\", so we asked you to have your say on if it was a possibility this season.\n\nHere are some of your comments:\n\nNathan: Always optimistic but Europe will be a stretch too far this season. Lots of new faces and losing Kilman and Neto will take its toll initially. Keep the squad fit, keep going under Gary O'Neil and next season we could be looking up the table again.\n\nTom: A top-half finish and a push for Europe should be the aim. We have a great manager and a talented squad of players. Gary brings a feeling to the club not seen since the days of Nuno. Out of darkness cometh light - let's believe and be positive for a great season to come.\n\nRob: No, I don't think Europe is realistic sadly. I think we need several windows of adding to the squad before we have the depth we need. We still seem light in defence, especially left-back where a lot rests on Ait-Nouri. We over burdened several players last season and we all know how that worked out.\n\nDan: Wolves are flying under the radar at the moment. They have a good squad and good manager. If they keep all key players, like Cunha, fit then European football is an optimistic but realistic target.\n\n'Still time to use transfer funds judiciously'\n\nMike Taylor\n\nBBC Radio WM reporter\n\nThe 18,000 fans who watched Wolves' toothless performance against Rayo Vallecano last weel probably left disappointed, although not as much as their manager.\n\nGary O'Neil rejected all the platitudes about it being a friendly: \"I didn't enjoy today... my least favourite game so far...\"\n\nO'Neil did concede, with a grin, that he can be a little pessimistic: \"My staff are keen for me not to see all the negatives. They're trying to remind me that it has been a good pre-season.\"\n\nBut it may take a good result in a real game to clear away any nerves. It also gave him a reason to point out his squad requires investment before the transfer window ends. This is not news.\n\nThe sales of Pedro Neto and Maximilian Kilman helped Wolves recoup a substantial amount this summer.\n\n\"We made Â£100m this summer - we made Â£100m last summer,\" said O'Neil. \"That does provide its challenges to keep a team staying competitive, and as strong as it was when it was competing for Europe.\"\n\nBut the situation this time is different.\n\nLast year, the aim was to recoup money in order to limbo under the profit and sustainability bar - and every penny counted. This time, O'Neil has stressed that the money needs to be wisely re-invested, and Wolves have already signed some promising, mostly young, players. This pleases him, but he needs more.\n\n\"We've signed a lot of young players - hopefully we can sign a few that can help us here and now,\" he said. I'm really open with the club. We do need some that are ready now.\"\n\nThese thoughts should not raise the same alarms for fans as the complaints aired by O'Neil's predecessor Julen Lopetegui. After all, O'Neil has just signed a new contract, so when he says \"we're all really aligned with what we want to do here\", the proof is in writing.\n\nThe immediate value of the Neto and Kilman deals may not so much be the cash amount actually booked, as the timing. Much better to take the money now than in the window's final, frantic hours. There is time to use it judiciously.\n\nBut it will need to be spent in a way that returns value, not just in balance sheets several years hence, but on the field.\n\nNow.\n\nListen to full commentary of Arsenal v Wolves at 15:00 BST on Saturday on BBC Radio WM, and tune into The West Midlands Football Phone-In from 18:00 on weeknights\n\nPhil McNulty's predictions - Wolves\n\nIt's that time of the year again - the annual act of foolishness in which I try to predict the outcome of the 2024-25 season for all 20 Premier League clubs.\n\nWolves - 15th\n\nGary O'Neil did a first-class job after taking over at Molineux in turbulent circumstances just before the start of last season, following the departure of Julen Lopetegui.\n\nThe same again would be more than good enough after a quiet summer of incomings at Wolves so far.\n\nMax Kilman and Pedro Neto are big losses, although the latter was often missing because of injury, so Wolves will rely heavily on O'Neil, who has just been rewarded for his work with a new four-year contract.\n\nTommy Doyle has made his move from Manchester City permanent after good season on loan, but Wolves will need to reinvest some of the money raked in for Kilman and Neto to keep O'Neil's side away from trouble and make sure this forecast comes to fruition.\n\nThis prediction leans heavily on more new signings and O'Neil's ability, but I think Wolves can avoid danger - and surely they will get a better deal from VAR this season.\n\nRead all of Phil's predictions here\n\nNew captain Lemina wants to 'progress as human being and leader'\n\nNew Wolves captain Mario Lemina has been speaking to BBC Sport's Nick Mashiter about how he hopes to prove himself in the role this season.\n\nThe 30-year-old lost his father in December and is eager for the captaincy to show the person behind the player.\n\n\"He would be really happy and proud of me,\" Lemina said of his father. \"He knows me better than anyone else - he knows I've never been a bad guy. He knows I've been pushing really hard to clean my name.\"\n\n\"Iâm not going to say Iâve done everything the right way because I was young and really emotional, but Iâve never been a bad guy or had a bad attitude.\n\n\"If I was to talk about my career a lot of people would think I had a bad attitude. It's never really been like that.\"\n\nWolves open the new Premier League season against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium and the Gabonese midfielder has put in the hours to make a positive start to the season.\n\n\"I'm working really hard,\" he said. \"I'm really positive, I put myself second and I try to support everyone. That's what the club and the gaffer likes,\"\n\n\"I'm stronger mentally and as a player I feel more comfortable and more confident. The players understand what I'm talking about with my experiences.\"\n\nHe said that after his father's passing he was not the same player as before and that Wolves boss Gary O'Neil wants him to return to his previous levels.\n\n\"I feel I'm ready,\" Lemina added. \"I feel stronger mentally. I want to progress, even if I'm 30, as a human being, a leader and a person.\n\n\"I want people to be happy, to work hard and get the best memories ever. Football goes quickly.\"\n\nBreakout star? It's season predictions\n\nDazzling Dave\n\nFan writer\n\nWhere will you finish in the league and why?\n\nWolves supporters are buzzing, and it's been a while since we last witnessed this level of anticipation! Gary has Wolvesâ purring nicely, we look like a team that could push on. I am predicting a top-10 finish and a push for a European spot.\n\nWho is the best signing or has he not signed yet and who should it be?\n\nOn the whole, the friendlies have unveiled a new side to Wolves, with a higher pressing game and plenty of energy. With new recruits and returning players, the squad now looks much stronger. Yerson Mosquera seems a strong candidate to replace Max Kilman, although we will still need one more in this department.\n\nWho will be the breakout star in your squad?\n\nPortuguese winger Rodrigo Gomes is a savvy acquisition by Matt Hobbs. He shares many traits with Pedro Neto. Rodrigo is quick and skilled, similar to Neto, but perhaps more adaptable and comfortable on either wing. He's already scored a few goals in pre-season. He is definitely one to watch.\n\nWhat do you want from your manager this season?\n\nGary O'Neil seems very happy at Wolves, and his newly extended contract provides the club with essential leadership stability. There has been talk of him for the England job, and rightly so. He has proven himself as a strong leader and smart strategist. Gary has managed the squad with skill, and seems to have rejuvenated many players returning from loan spells, if he continues in this vain then things look bright.\n\nWhat is your one major concern?\n\nSwitching to a back four might make us more defensively exposed, but this doesn't overly concern me. Wolves have standout players highly regarded by other clubs. Keeping players like Joao Gomes and Rayan Ait-Nouri is crucial, as any last-minute departures on deadline day could ruin our season's prospects. Wolves aren't finished with their transfer dealings, and hopefully, some smart additions to the squad will improve our position compared to last season.\n\nDazzling Dave can be found at Always Wolves, external"
