With his bronze medal in laser sailing Rasmus Myrgren brought home the fifth Olympic medal for Sweden.

News agency had reported that the protest levelled at the sailor could have cost him the medal. Stefan Rahm with the Sailing Association told TT that the protest centered on Myrgren's mast.

"The mast on a laser has two parts, which means the mast almost always bends slightly after some time. The sails bend them back with the strength of the sailors, even though the rules say that the mast must be straight," Rahm said.

"But everyone does it. The problem for Rasmus is that he did it when the boats were standing still in the so-called quarantine zone before the race when several people noticed it."

Myrgren suffered through another protest drama in his last sail, when Croat Tonci Stipanovic filed a protest that was rejected.
