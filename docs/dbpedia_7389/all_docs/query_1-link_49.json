        "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO — Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands has won the gold medal in the women's Laser Radial class in the Rio Olympics sailing regatta.\n\nBouwmeester, who won the silver in London four years ago, was seventh in the medal race Tuesday and finished six points ahead of silver medalist Annalise Murphy of Ireland. Murphy finished fourth in London after dominating early in that regatta.\n\nThe bronze medal went to Anne-Marie Rindom of Denmark.\n\nDefending bronze medalist Evi Van Acker of Belgium finished fourth. Van Acker fell ill earlier in the regatta and struggled. Her coach said she contracted a severe intestinal infection while training on polluted Guanabara Bay last month.\n\nClearwater native Paige Railey, who also qualified for the 2012 Olympics in London, finished 10th.\n\nThe race had been scheduled for Monday but was postponed due to high winds."
