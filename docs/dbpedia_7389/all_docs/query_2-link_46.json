        "text": "Barely four days after winning another mandate to oversee the affairs of the Football’s governing body, the new reelected Administrator has decided to let go of his mandate for the love of the game.\n\nBlatter in his statement released a few hours ago said “While I have a mandate from the membership of FIFA, I do not feel that I have a mandate from the entire world of football – the fans, the players, the clubs, the people who live, breathe and love football as much as we all do at FIFA”\n\nhe further went on to state that while he would continue in his role as FIFA President He would continue to champion the course for the restructuring on FIFA.\n\nOne major change Blatter is pushing for is the reduction of the members of the executive council who Blatter claims “includes representatives of confederations over whom we have no control, but for whose actions FIFA is held responsible”\n\nThe FIFA President also wants elections and integrity checks into the FIFA Executive Committee to be organised centrally instead of it being handled by the confederations.\n\nBut perhaps the most talked about aspect of the FIFA leadership for So many years is the way FIFA Presidents have virtually perpetuated themselves in office. And Strangely Blatter who is a beneficiary of this system says he wants “term limits not only for the president but for all members of the Executive Committee”\n\nBlatter went on to say that “I have fought for these changes before and, as everyone knows, my efforts have been blocked. This time, I will succeed”\n\nThe FIFA President has asked Domenico Scala who is the Independent Chairman of FIFA’s Audit and Compliance to oversee the introduction and implementation of these and other reforms. Mr. Scala is also the Chairman of the ad hoc Electoral Committee which means he would also oversee the election of a successor for the Outgoing FIFA President.\n\nA lot of football enthusiast and stakeholders are wondering why Mr Blatter went ahead to contest an election amidst global outrage after several key members of the football governing body were alleged to have been involved in fraudulent practices surrounding the selection of host nations for FIFA’s hottest property the FIFA World Cup.\n\nAlthough Mr Blatter maintains his innocence, only time will tell if he would also survive this “FIFA TSUNAMI” OR #FIFAGate\n\nThe eyes of the sailing world will be back on Weymouth and Portland with Olympic medallists returning to the venue of the London 2012 Olympic Sailing Competition for ISAF Sailing World Cup Weymouth and Portland.\n\nWeymouth and Portland, the fourth of six ISAF Sailing World Cup regattas in 2015, will welcome sailors across ten Olympic and three Paralympic events in Great Britain from 8-14 June 2015.\n\nISAF Sailing World Cup glory, a share of the €78,000 prize fund and Abu Dhabi final spots are on offer with racing commencing on 10 June culminating in the live Medal Races on Sunday 14 June.\n\nThe world’s top 30 sailors from the 27 April 2015 ISAF World Sailing Rankings release were invited to Weymouth and Portland with the remaining receiving their spot at the qualification event, the Delta Lloyd Regatta in Medemblik, the Netherlands.\n\nLaser\n\nPavlos Kontides (CYP) made history at the London 2012 Olympic Sailing Competition by becoming the first athlete from Cyprus to claim an Olympic medal. With gold medallist Tom Slingsby (AUS) concentrating on the America’s Cup and Rasmus Myrgren (SWE) stepping away from the boat, Kontides is the only returning Olympic Laser medallist in Weymouth and Portland.\n\n“The best sporting moments of my life are obviously from Weymouth,” explained a nostalgic Cypriot. “Scoring two bullets on the second day of the Olympics, holding the yellow jersey mid-way through and finally, glory for myself, my family, my team and my country’s first ever Olympic medal.\n\n“[Sailing World Cup Weymouth and Portland] is a perfect opportunity for me to visit the same place where it all happened. It will just always feel special to me and a strong bond will exist due to the memories.\n\n“Of course I do remember a lot of rainy days as well during my preparation there,” he said with a winking face on his email response.\n\nKontides will form part of an exceptional fleet of 40 strong Laser sailors in Weymouth and Portland. The 40-boat invitational fleets were introduced at World Cup Hyères and proved an immediate hit as Kontides explained, “This type of racing is challenging and exciting with no mistakes allowed.\n\n“The start and opening of the race are even more important as recovery opportunities are less frequent due to the high level of the fleet and evenness in speed. Consistency is always key for a good result.\n\n“Competition will definitely be tough and together with the conditions Weymouth is known for, hiking, strong changing current and a big swell will provide the sailors with fascinating racing.”\n\nThe Laser is one of the most hotly contested Olympic fleets at the moment with a number of competitors consistently fighting for top honours. But what does it take to succeed? “Sailing is a sport which depends on many different parameters,” explained Kontides. “Consistency is a must for success as you have to perform well in all kinds of conditions.\n\n“In doing so you have to start good, sail fast and smart with low risk and finish every race as best as possible. You can always win a regatta without even winning an individual race.”\n\nMatt Wearm (AUS) recently won the Delta Lloyd Regatta by taking just a single race win from nine races. Consistency is certainly king in the Laser and Wearn comes into Weymouth and Portland eager to continue his good form, “The win in Medemblik has prepared me well for Weymouth. It gives me a great deal of confidence that I have the ability to be on the top of the podium.\n\n“It was also great to be so consistent in the tricky conditions against some tough opponents.\n\n“The Laser fleet as always is extremely competitive. It feels that you can go to any event around the world and you can expect to be racing the world’s best. The depth in the fleet is incredible to that anyone from the top 20 in the world has the ability to win regattas.\n\n“I feel Weymouth will be no exception to this and that it’s going to be another incredibly tight regatta between the top few guys in the world. It is definitely now becoming the time where everyone wants to assert their dominance going in to the last year before the [Olympic] Games.”\n\nWorld #1 Tom Burton (AUS) heads into Weymouth in good form having won World Cup Hyères whilst Tonci Stipanovic (CRO), Nick Thompson (GBR) and Philipp Buhl (GER) will all make the journey to Weymouth and Portland well prepared.\n\nLaser Radial\n\nThe Laser Radial Medal Race at London 2012 saw a four way shoot out for the medals between Lijia Xu (CHN), Marit Bouwmeester (NED), Evi Van Acker (BEL) and Annalise Murphy (IRL).\n\nXu went on to win gold and has since stepped away from the Laser Radial. Meanwhile silver medallist Bouwmeester, bronze medallist Van Acker and the fourth place Murphy all return to the waters for ISAF Sailing World Cup Weymouth and Portland.\n\n“I have fond memories of Weymouth. [It was] a dream come true to become an Olympian in 2012,” commented Bouwmeester. “It will be my first time back in the UK since 2012. I am very excited and looking forward to the nice waves in the bay.”\n\nVan Acker is also of a similar mind set in advance of competition, “I have great memories of Weymouth. The conditions during the Olympics were fantastic with good winds and sunshine every day. I’m looking very much forward going back to the Olympic venue.\n\n“Winning an Olympic medal was something truly exceptional. My team and I worked so hard for it. My friends and family were cheering for us on the mountain [the Nothe]. It was a dream come true, although I still feel like I could have done better.”\n\nThe level of the competition at the ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta has the potential to be higher than the Olympic Sailing Competition with multiple entrants per nation possible. The qualification system ensures the best of the best are in the 40 boat fleet, something Bouwmeester enjoys, “In my opinion this concept is the way forward.\n\n“It’s nice to have the big fleet qualifying events and then the high level World Cup events. It’s nice to race with all the good girls in one fleet, just like the Olympics.”\n\nVan Acker added, “Racing in a 40 boat fleet in Hyères was definitely exciting. It’s different in many ways, but good fun and good practice for the Olympics. Pressure is on from day one without a qualifying series and with only the top sailors competing.\n\n“I expect fierce competition in Weymouth. The Laser Radial is a very competitive class and there is always a good battle going on between the girls. We are coming closer to the test event in Rio, many national trials are going on so everyone wants to perform at their best.”\n\nIreland’s Murphy missed out on an Olympic medal by just four points over the third placed Van Acker but looks back fondly on the venue, “I have a lot of great memories from Weymouth as I first competed there in the ISAF Youth Worlds in 2006. I like coming to Weymouth as it is so close to home for me and because I have spent so much time there everything is very familiar.”\n\nMurphy, like Bouwmeester and Van Acker, also pointed out the positives of the elite level competition, “It was really exciting racing with the top 40 boats in Hyères and it brings in a whole new dynamic to Olympic racing. If you make a small mistake you’re most likely going to get punished for it as everyone is so close.\n\n“I think you have to work extremely hard to succeed in the Laser Radial right now, everyone is extremely professional and if you’re not giving it 100% it is very easy to get left behind.”\n\nBelgium’s Van Acker will be the one to beat in Weymouth and Portland. Over the last 15 months she has finished on the podium at every ISAF Sailing World Cup regatta she’s competed at, winning gold at the 2014 and 2015 Hyères editions and the 2014 ISAF Sailing World Cup Final.\n\nAiming to halt her run, alongside Murphy and Bouwmeester, will be Hyères bronze medallist Josefin Olsson (SWE), World #1 Alison Young (GBR) and World #3 Anne-Marie Rindom (DEN).\n\nMen’s and Women’s RS:X\n\nHost nation favourites Nick Dempsey (GBR) and Bryony Shaw (GBR) will be leading contenders in the Men’s and Women’s RS:X.\n\nShaw, the current World #1 in the Women’s RS:X, took gold at ISAF Sailing World Cup Miami at the turn of the year following victory at the ISAF Sailing World Cup Final in Abu Dhabi, UAE in 2014. A seventh followed at World Cup Hyères but she’ll be out to make amends on her home waters.\n\nJoining Shaw in the fleet will be former World #1 Flavia Tartaglini (ITA) and British rival Isobel Hamilton (GBR).\n\nIn the Men’s RS:X, Dempsey will be the spearhead and the man to beat. Dempsey took silver on Weymouth and Portland’s waters at London 2012 and knows the surroundings better than most. He will be joined by a strong pack of Men’s RS:X racers that includes Brazil’s Ricardo Santos, China’s Aichen Wang and Hong Kong’s Michael Cheng.\n\nA high level of competition is also on the cards for the Nacra 17, Men’s and Women’s 470, 49er, 49erFX, Finn and Paralympic events. A further preview will follow on Wednesday 3 June.\n\nRacing at ISAF Sailing World Cup Weymouth and Portland commences on Wednesday 10 June. Medal Races on Sunday 14 June will bring the regatta to a close.\n\n“I have had a marvelous 25-year career during which I worked with some of the best umpires and match referees,” says Davis\n\nSteve Davis of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires today announced that he will retire from international umpiring at the end of the upcoming One-Day International (ODI) series between England and New Zealand, which concludes at the Riverside Ground, Chester-le-Street, on Saturday, 20 June.\n\n63-year-old Davis was selected for the Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires in 2002, before he was promoted to the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires in 2008. To date, Davis has umpired in 57 Tests, 135 ODIs and 26 T20Is.\n\nDavis made his first-class umpiring debut in 1990-91 and umpired in his first ODI in 1992 when he officiated an ODI between Pakistan and the West Indies in Adelaide. His first Test appointment was five years later in Hobart when he stood in the match between Australia and New Zealand.\n\nDuring his illustrious career, Davis has umpired in the 2007, 2011 and 2015 ICC Cricket World Cups, 2009 and 2013 ICC Champions Trophy tournaments as well as all five ICC World Twenty20 events.\n\nAnnouncing his decision, Davis said: “It has been a difficult but considered decision. I have had a marvelous 25-year career during which I worked with some of the best umpires and match referees.\n\n“I have made many lasting friendships all around the world, both on and off the field, which I will treasure forever.\n\n“I also take this opportunity to thank Cricket Australia and the ICC for their support and the opportunities they have given me. And as much as anyone, I thank my wife Annie and our families for their encouragement and support over the years.”\n\nICC General Manager – Cricket, Geoff Allardice, paid tribute to Davis when he said: “Steve will finish international cricket on a high, leaving the game with the respect of not only his umpiring colleagues, but of the match referees and players as well.\n\n“He was one of the best match managers on the field, and a great team man for umpires and referees to work alongside. He has also been the leader of the elite umpires over recent years, and his calming influence will be hard to replace.”\n\nVince Van Der Bijl, Senior Umpires and Referees Manager, congratulated Davis on a successful career. He said: “The Elite Panel had been fortunate to have a person of Steve’s calibre and stature involved with the group for the last seven years.\n\n“Through his leadership and commitment, Steve has had an immense influence on the umpiring community, which will be fondly remembered by all those who have worked with him during his long and distinguished umpiring career.\n\n“On behalf of the ICC, I thank Steve for his significant contribution to the game.”\n\nDavis’ replacement on the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Umpires will be announced in due course.\n\nThe sixth ISSF World Cup Stage of the season was held in Munich, Germany, from the 27th of May through the 1st of June.\n\nThe season’s sixth ISSF World Cup stage just closed in Munich, Germany, where a record-breaking number of 901 participating athletes coming from 87 countries competed in the 10 Olympic Rifle and Pistol events from the 27th of May through the 1st of June.\n\nGaining three gold medals, the People’s Republic of China came atop the competition’s medal standings – Zhu Qinan, Zhang Jingjing, and Yi Siling were the athletes who contributed to their country’s success\n\nGermany took the competition’s last gold medal, as Andre Link won today’s Men’s 50m Rifle 3 Positions final against Yang Haoran of China. Link (458.7 points) held on to first place and closed with a 1.7-point lead on Yang, 19, who set a Final Junior World Record (457.0 points).
