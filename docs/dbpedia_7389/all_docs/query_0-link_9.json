        "text": "The Olympics are over. It was a couple of weeks of some very incredible performances from athletes from around the world. But how’d it go in Sweden?\n\nThere were 134 athletes competing in 20 different sports. Sweden managed to win eight medals total. They came home with one gold medal, four silver medals, and three bronze medals. Not a bad haul and better than the Swedish showing in Beijing in 2008, but not the best they’ve ever managed either. In fact, back in 1912, when Stockholm hosted the Olympics, the Swedes won 65 medals (24 of them gold). Not too bad.\n\n(Fun fact about Stockholm hosting the Olympics. In 1956, Melbourne, Australia hosted the summer Olympics. But, because of a quarantine on horses at the time, all of the equestrian events were held in Stockholm earlier in the year.)\n\nThis year, the winners of the Swedish medals come from a wide array of sports.\n\nThe gold medal was awarded to Fredrik Lööf and Max Salminen in Star class sailing.\n\nThe silver medals were awarded to Sara Algotsson Ostholt for individual eventing equestrian, Håkan Dahlby for men’s double trap shooting, Lisa Nordén for women’s triathlon, and of course, the men’s national handball team which lost to France 22-21.\n\nThe bronze medals were awarded to Rasmus Myrgren for laser class sailing, Johan Eurén for men’s Greco-Roman wrestling in the 120 kilo class, and finally, Jimmy Lidberg for men’s Greco-Roman wrestling in the 96 kilo class.\n\nAn impressive showing by all of the athletes, and while there were some disappointments (especially in some of the swimming events); there were also some exciting performances (like the handball team!). Only a couple of years until the winter Olympics. The country tends to do just a bit better with the winter sports."
