        "text": "London: A dip in the English Channel never felt so good.\n\nTom Slingsby of Australia won the Olympic sailing gold medal in the men's Laser class on Monday by match-racing his closest competitor, Pavlos Kontides of Cyprus, to the back of the fleet.\n\nAfter crossing the line in ninth place in the medals race, Slingsby, a tactician with America's Cup champion Oracle Racing, capsized his boat in celebration.\n\nAs he continued to celebrate, Slingsby tipped his boat over again, righted it, climbed back in and then waved the Australian flag at a big group of supporters watching from Nothe Fort, including his parents.\n\nThe Australian came into the medals race leading Kontides by 14 points, leaving them the only two with a chance at the gold.\n\nSlingsby got ahead of the Cypriot at the start and kept him pinned at the back of the fleet, making sure he couldn't break free.\n\nKontides took the silver, securing the first-ever Olympic medal for his small island nation.\n\n\"I feel really wonderful,\" Kontides said. \"I guess when I have the silver medal around my neck and be back home, then all the celebrations will start, and I will really understand what I have done. It's a historic day for Cyprus sport and for myself as well. I guess I wrote my name in Cyprus sport in golden letters.\"\n\nCyprus started taking part in the modern-day Olympics in the 1980 Moscow Games.\n\nSweden's Rasmus Myrgren took the bronze. The equipment inspection committee filed a protest against Myrgren just before the start, but the Swede prevailed and keeps the medal.\n\nSlingsby was unbeaten in four regattas held at Weymouth in the lead-up to the games and led this one from the start, winning four of the first 10 races.\n\nHe's the second America's Cup sailor to win gold in these games.\n\nOn Sunday, British star Ben Ainslie won the Finn class gold medal. Ainslie's four straight gold medals, combined with his silver from 1996, made him the most successful sailor in Olympic history.\n\nNow it's off to their day jobs. The second season of the America's Cup World Series begins with a regatta in San Francisco from Aug. 21-26. Ainslie will skipper Ben Ainslie Racing. He will then join Oracle Racing for the 34th America's Cup on San Francisco Bay next summer.\n\nSlingsby gets a little bit of a break before reporting back to work with Oracle in September."
