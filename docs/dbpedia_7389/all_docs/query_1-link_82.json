Singapore was part of the Malaysian team at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, but did not attend at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, because of its support for the United States boycott.\n\nThe Singapore National Olympic Council sent a total of 23 athletes to the Games, 8 men and 15 women, to compete in 9 sports.[1] For the second time in its Olympic history, Singapore was represented by more female than male athletes. Seven Singaporean athletes had competed in Beijing, including swimmer Tao Li, who finished fifth in the women's butterfly event. Among the sports played by the athletes, Singapore also marked its Olympic debut in sprint canoeing and artistic gymnastics."
