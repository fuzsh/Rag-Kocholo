        "text": "In a race with the Chinese, Team USA is aiming for about 100 medals in London, at least 40 of them gold, with Ohioans looking to contribute somewhere between 10 and 15 medals to the cause. (Thanks ahead of time, LeBron.)\n\nThe United States won 110 medals in 2008, with China next with 100. Not that medals are all that matter.\n\nFrom the Opening Ceremonies on Friday to the Closing Ceremonies on Sunday, Aug. 12, more than 10,000 athletes, including 530 Americans, will live and chase their dreams. And probably have to wear a raincoat while doing it.\n\nHere are 12 of the stories to follow as the Plain Dealer prepares to cover 17 days of Olympic activity across the Atlantic.\n\n-- Doug Lesmerises and Tim Warsinskey\n\nLochte vs. Phelps\n\nDillard watches\n\nGymnastics hopes\n\nWomen on every team\n\nOhio tough\n\nWrestling contenders\n\nBoxing\n\nDream Team\n\nDecathlon\n\nMissy Franklin\n\nTennis tension\n\nLondon itself\n\nLOCHTE VS. PHELPS\n\nTwo things are certain about the best rivalry at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Neither Ryan Lochte nor Michael Phelps is going to match Phelps' record eight gold medals from the 2008 Games — each American swimming star is competing in just four individual events and, potentially, three relays. And both aren't going to win seven golds — because two of their events are against each other.\n\nLochte and Phelps will go head-to-head in the 400 and 200 individual medleys. At the Olympic Trials, Lochte won the 400 IM by .83 seconds over Phelps, while Phelps won the 200 IM by .09 seconds over Lochte. London could be closer. And both certainly will be faster.\n\nPhelps is already the most decorated Olympic athlete of all-time, with 16 medals, 14 of them gold, and his coach, Bob Bowman, said whatever Phelps does in London won't change his status as the greatest Olympian ever.\n\nLochte is already cool. His red, white and blue hightops at the Olympic Trials included wings. He also has six Olympic medals, three of them gold.\n\nPhelps is a bit more awkward and intense. Lochte is a bit more rugged and relaxed. Both are supremely confident. But there are only so many gold medals to go around. — DL\n\nWORTH EVERY INCH — 100 METERS\n\nThat's 109 yards and one inch of crazy fun mixed with track history. Cleveland native Harrison Dillard returns to the city where he won his first gold medal 64 years ago in the 100-meter dash to watch world-record holder Usain Bolt attempt to defend his 2008 championship. “If he's healthy, I believe he will,'' Dillard says.\n\nBolt's main challenger is Jamaican teammate Johan Blake, who beat Bolt at the Jamaican trials and looked sharp at a meet this week in Switzerland (9.85 seconds).\n\nLocally, Elyria's Tianna Madison burst back onto the world stage this year by placing third at indoor worlds in the 60 meters and she was second at the U.S. 100 trials, ahead of Allyson Felix. Madison isn't a popular medal pick in the women's 100, but can't be overlooked. And don't forget, that extra inch in 109 yards and one inch never mattered more than in 2008 when swimmer Phelps won his signature event, the 100 butterfly, by a fingernail. — TW\n\nGYMNASTIC GOLD?\n\nTeam USA has a single team Olympic gold in women's gymnastics, from Atlanta in 1996. The men also have just one, from the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which was made easier by the Soviet-led boycott.\n\nWith the U.S women coming off a gold at the 2011 world championships, and the men coming off a bronze, both teams are thinking about winning it all in London. The women's team also was coming off world championship gold the year before heading into the 2004 and 2008 Olympics and wound up with the silver medal both times.\n\n“I think it could be really great,” said Jordyn Wieber, also a leading contender for the all-around individual gold, as is teammate Gabby Douglas. “Look at what happened at the world championships. That would mean a lot, and it would be a big year if both the men and women did good at the Olympics, so hopefully we can make it happen.” — DL\n\nWOMEN AIM FOR DOMINANCE\n\nFor the first time, every nation has entered at least one woman, including the first Saudi woman, and also for the first time, the U.S. has more women Olympians than men.\n\nThe U.S. women's contingent is especially strong with team gold medals possible in gymnastics, soccer, field hockey, basketball, indoor and outdoor volleyball and water polo. Throw in swimmers Missy Franklin and Natalie Coughlin, Ohio sailor Anna Tunnicliffe, fencer Mariel Zagunis and sprinters Sanya Richards-Ross, and tennis player Serena Williams, among others, and the U.S. women are a powerhouse.\n\nBut none will get a kick out of competing quite like Malaysian shooter Nur Suryani Mohamed Taibil, who will be eight months pregnant when she competes in 10-meter air rifle on July 28. Before she competes, she tells her unborn girl, “Mum is going to shoot just for a while. Can you just be calm?” — TW\n\nTOUGH WOMEN FROM THE BUCKEYE STATE\n\nWeightlifter Holley Mangold grew up in Centerville. Judo's Kayla Harrison grew up 50 miles away in Middletown and trained in Centerville. Now Mangold, in the over 165-pound weight class, and Harrison, in the 165-pound weight class, are looking to flip some weight and flip some opponents in London.\n\n“We're corn-fed,” joked Harrison, who has never met Mangold. “I think that being a kid from the Midwest, you do have to try harder. You have a lot tougher road, I think, to get the exposure, to get the training you need to make it. In the bigger cities, they tend to have better coaches and better equipment. So you have to be pretty tough.”\n\nMangold, new to her sport, has an uphill climb to a bronze medal. But Harrison, in judo since she was a kid, is a leading contender for a gold. — DL\n\nU.S. WRESTLING, ONE AND DONE?\n\nThe U.S. has won just one gold medal in each of the last two\n\nOlympics, and with the most wrestlers entered of any country (17 of 18 weights), it can't afford another embarrassing performance like that, not with big paydays waiting for those who jump to mixed martial arts fighting.\n\nReigning freestyle world champ Jordan Burroughs is a likely breakout star, though he doesn't compete until Aug. 10. The U.S. is counting on four others who aren't favorites, but are contenders, to break out on top: Akron's Justin (Harry) Lester, Columbus' Tervel Dlagnev and the two Jakes — Jake Varner and Jake Herbert.\n\nIt's more than just gold on the line for American wrestlers. A special incentive fund pays them $250,000 for gold medals. — TW\n\nCAN BOXING BOUNCE BACK?\n\nBoxing is in the same boat as wrestling. After winning just a single bronze medal in at the 2008 Olympics, Team USA said it has a better grip on the Olympic scoring system, with its boxers training to be active in the ring, focusing on scoring punches rather than power shots. It may not be enough.\n\nCincinnati native Rau'shee Warren, in his third Olympics, is the best hope for a men's American boxing medal in the 114-pound flyweight division, with Cleveland's Terrell Gausha hoping to spring some middleweight upsets. In the first Olympics with women's boxing, 17-year-old middleweight Claressa Shields also is a medal contender. — DL\n\nDREAM ANOTHER DREAM\n\nOn the 20th anniversary of the Dream Team, U.S. Olympic basketball finds itself tossing and turning over the future of the sport. The Olympics seems to have lost its allure for some NBA stars, owners and executives, and commissioner David Stern recently floated the idea of an under-23 tournament similar to soccer.\n\nKobe Bryant's response? He called it a “stupid idea.'' Certainly, the competitive fires still burn for Bryant as he tries to lead an injury-depleted U.S. squad to its fifth gold since NBA players were first allowed to compete in 1992.\n\nWith injuries to Dwight Howard and Blake Griffin, the U.S. is thin in the frontcourt, but still the favorite with a roster that includes Akron native LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. — TW\n\nBEING SPECIAL, TIMES TEN\n\nDuring the Olympic track trials in Oregon, a bus with Ashton Eaton's large photo on the side carried the headline “Specialize in everything.'' No one does that like the 24-year-old decathlon phenom. In just his second year as a pro, he set a world record at the U.S. trials in mostly poor weather.\n\nIncredibly gifted in the sprints and jumps — his 27-foot long jump in the rain would have qualified him for the Olympics in that event — he is just coming into his own as a thrower, and his large wingspan would indicate there's plenty more to come in those events.\n\nPerhaps because it requires attention to 10 events over two days, the decathlon has lost its cache in recent years, but the humble and charismatic Eaton could be the right person to restore the “World's Greatest Athlete'' to its once lofty perch. — TW\n\nMISSY \"THE MISSILE\" FRANKLIN\n\nIt could turn out that the swimming star of the Olympics isn't Lochte or Phelps but first-time Olympian Missy Franklin, a 17-year-old rising high school senior with size 13 feet who also will swim seven events in London. “It sounds absolutely amazing. I am so thrilled to be able to compete in seven events, definitely my biggest dream. I never thought I would be able to accomplish it,” Franklin said.\n\nThe medal record for women U.S. swimmers was set by Natalie Coughlin, who won six in 2008. Franklin, whose best event is the 200 backstroke, will have a tough road to match that. But remember, she's only 17. And this is just a start. — DL\n\nSTRAWBERRIES, CREAM AND GOLD\n\nA week after the British Open, wouldn't it have been fun to see the best golfers in the world compete for Olympic medals? Ironically, golf doesn't become an Olympic sport until 2016 in Brazil, but there is another perfect match between London and the Olympics — tennis at Wimbledon.\n\nDespite the withdrawal of Rafael Nadal, 18 of the world's top 20-ranked men and women are competing in the historic grass venue, making this year's tennis field is by far the deepest since the sport was reintroduced to the Olympic docket in 1988. This year's Wimbledon champs, Serena Williams and Roger Federer, seem especially motivated by the prospect of winning their first Olympic singles gold medals. Potentially adding some local drama is Great Britain's Andy Murray, who made a stirring run to the Wimbledon final before losing to Federer.\n\nLONDON TOWN\n\nShortfalls in security personnel required thousands of soldiers to be called to Olympic duty; train drivers have threatened a strike; Keith Moon, former drummer for The Who who died in 1978, was invited to perform at the closing ceremonies; and a recent newspaper editorial finally asked for the rain to stop. Is London ready?\n\nThe first three-time host in Olympic history, following the 1908 and 1948 Olympics, the city is set to follow the big bang of Beijing, with reports this week that some acts from the opening ceremonies are being trimmed to avoid going too long.\n\nThere are always hitches in the run-up, and the execution, of an Olympics, and no one likes to have it rain on their vacation. But if every fan and athletes gets home safely after pursuing, or observing the pursuit, of lifelong dreams, no one should complain too loudly, even if they are soggy. And gold medals don't smudge. — DL"
