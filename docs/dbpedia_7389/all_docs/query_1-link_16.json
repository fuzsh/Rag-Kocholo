        "text": "The final opportunity for modern pentathletes to put themselves in contention to be picked by selectors for their nation's Olympic quota positions, took place in Cairo, Egypt last week (8-14 June) at the Pentathlon and Laser Run World Championships. The not so little accolade of being crowned world champion was at stake, too.\n\nPrior to the event, a total of 23 women and 23 men had already secured a quota place for their countries at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, taking place in 2021, with 36 places available in total per gender, with only a maximum of two per country allowed. A World Pentathlon Olympic Ranking system cements quota spots and following this weekend's action, it is down to each nation with multiple options to select their team for those places.\n\nHere are five things we learned from the weekend.\n\nIconic duo return to top step\n\nWith a combined age of more than 70, Hungary's Adam Marosi, 36, and Belarus' Anastasiya Prokopenko, 35, rolled back the years and won the world championships titles in their respective men's and women's events and, along with it, a quota place each for their nations to Tokyo 2020.\n\nBoth are now two-time world champions with Marosi last winning the title in London in 2009. Clearly a fan of the capital, he also won bronze at the London 2012 Olympic Games. Now he will likely have another chance of competing for an Olympic medal when the Tokyo 2020 event starts on 5 August.\n\n\"In a few weeks I will be 37 years old, and I don't know who is the oldest world champion but maybe it happened today, maybe it's me,\" said an emotional Marosi after the race. \"I hope my national team will say yes and I can go to Tokyo. I can taste the feeling now, I can taste the moment. Maybe I will cry on the podium.\"\n\nAlso using brain as well as brawn in the event that combines fencing, swimming and riding, followed by a laser-run, Prokopenko followed up on her 2018 title, claiming gold for a second time. Compatriot Volha Silkina won the last event before the COVID-enforced break, in 2019, which means Belarus have now equalled Hungary's record in claiming three titles in a row in the women's event, which was last achieved in 2004.\n\n\"I've had a very good year, finishing in the top 10 in all World Cups,\" said Prokopenko. \"My laser run was very good today and I want to thank everyone! It's my life, my heart ... my whole life.\"\n\nBattle of Belarus\n\nThe Belarus selectors will have a particularly hard time choosing two to go to Japan from the trio of Prokopenko, Silkina – who won both individual and team gold at the 2019 world championships – and Iryna Prasiantsova who won world team gold with Silkina in 2019. The duo also won gold in the relay at this championships.\n\nThe trio placed third in the team competition at this event, behind gold medallists Germany and second-placed Hungary, however, the individual event is the only discipline taking place in Japan.\n\nEgyptian king\n\n“Coming from 15th to 3rd, it was a very hard race and a very hard track,\" said home favourite Ahmed Elgendy of his battling race alongside compatriot Ahmed Hamed. Cheered on by the home spectators the duo kept Belraus' Ilya Palazkov in site during the final laser-run event, with Elgendy overtaking him on the third circuit with super sharpshooting and good running ability.\n\n\"I did it, and the most important thing is that I qualified for Tokyo and it's an automatic place.\n\n\"My target was to qualify through the rankings, and I didn't have a very good fence but I closed the gap in swimming, a little bit more in riding and then laser run - I did it!\"\n\nFrench power couple set for Games\n\nOne half of modern pentathlon power couple Elodie Clouvel of France battled to a silver medal, which gives her an opportunity to be selected for Tokyo and join already-qualified boyfriend Valentin Belaud. She will also want to repeat, or better, her silver-medal winning performance from Rio 2016, vanquishing her decision to change from swimming to modern pentathlon after not qualifying for the former at Beijing 2008.\n\n“I'm very happy,” said Clouvel after the race. \"This is very important for me and I am smiling, and I am focused now for the Olympic Games. I'm qualified for Tokyo - yes!\n\n\"Laser run was very good for me and I'm just so happy – thank you. I want to thank my coach and my darling, Valentin Belaud, who competes tomorrow, and all my team. The support of my fans and my partner are very important to my performance.\"\n\nBelaud finished in 11th position at this tournament with the double world champion looking ahead to the Games already by virtue of winning gold at the 2019 world championships in Hungary.\n\nTeam GB conundrum\n\nGreat Britain could do little to affect their current standings as a last-minute change in travel restrictions by the UK government put Egypt on the red list of safe places to travel during COVID-19, so the British team withdrew from the world championships. GB have already qualified two athletes in Kate French for the women and Joe Choong for the men, but those battling for the second spot on the team could do nothing to change their rankings.\n\nEven after not competing at the world championships, French is 2nd in the World Pentathlon Olympic Games Rankings table, with Jo Muir fifth, and Francesca Summers 8th. On the men's side, Tom Toolis, who pulled out a wonderful second place last time out in Hungary, is 11th in the rankings, Choong, who didn't compete last time out either, 16th and former world champion James Cooke, 21st."
