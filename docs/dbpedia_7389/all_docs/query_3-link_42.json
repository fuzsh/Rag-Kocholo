        "text": "by Lindsey Bell, RYA 19 Aug 2008 08:26 BST\n\nPaul Goodison has won Laser class gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games in Qingdao today (Tuesday 19 August).\n\nFour-time European champion Goodison, who finished fourth on his Olympic debut at Athens 2004, lead the fleet by 18 points going into today’s double points medal race meaning as long as the Brit did not finish 10th and last in the race and second-placed Swede Rasmus Myrgren win it, the Olympic crown would be Goodison’s.\n\nGoodison made no mistake in sealing the biggest prize of them all in light winds, sailing the Swede to the back of the fleet at the start and pinning him there throughout the race, stopping Myrgren have any chance of reaching the front and threatening gold.\n\nGoodison finished the race in ninth and Myrgren 10th for Goodison to be crowned Olympic champion with 63 points, eight points ahead of silver medallist Vasilij Zbogar (SLO) with Italian Diego Romero taking bronze. Myrgren finished sixth overall.\n\nSpeaking immediately after the race, Goodison said: “It’s just absolutely amazing, it might not have been the best way to do it but with the conditions being so tricky, it was the best way of making sure of gold.\n\n“It’s been a testing week but I hung in there and delivered yesterday, which made it a bit easier today.\n\n“You come to every Olympic Games trying to do your best and fortunately this time I’m on top of the table. It just feels unbelievable and it’s going to take a while to sink in, it’s just amazing. With London 2012 just around the corner, it would be an amazing opportunity to represent Great Britain at an Olympic Games in Britain.”\n\nGoodison’s is Britain’s fourth sailing medal of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games with Ben Ainslie (Finn) and Yngling trio Sarah Ayton, Sarah Webb and Pippa Wilson winning gold on Sunday and Nick Rogers and Joe Glanfield clinching 470 men’s silver yesterday (Monday).\n\nFull report on the days’ racing to follow."
