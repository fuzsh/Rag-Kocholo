        "text": "Australian athletes have been a part of every Olympics since the modern Summer Games first began in 1896.\n\nIn fact, Greece and Australia are the only two nations that have had representatives in every edition of the modern Olympic Games. However, Australian and New Zealand athletes competed together under the Australasia flag at London 1908 and Stockholm 1912.\n\nAt Athens 1896, Australia fielded only one athlete. Edwin Flack, who competed in both athletics and tennis, won gold medals in men’s 800m and 1500m, becoming the first Australian to win a medal at the Olympics.\n\nFlack also partnered Friedrich Traun of Germany to win the bronze in men’s doubles tennis as part of a mixed team.\n\nFanny Durack is the first Australian woman to win a medal at the Olympics. She bagged a gold in the women’s 100m freestyle swimming event at Stockholm 1912.\n\nDurack and fellow swimmer Wilhelmina Wylie, who settled for silver in the 100m freestyle, are the first Australian women’s Olympians.\n\nAustralian athletes have returned with at least one medal in every edition since, accounting for a total of 610 medals - 185 gold, 196 silver and 229 bronze - in 30 Summer Games appearances to date.\n\nThe Aussie’s worst showing at the Olympics was at Berlin 1936, with Jack Metcalfe accounting for the solitary bronze medal in the men’s triple jump.\n\nAustralia’s best performance at the Olympics came at Paris 2024, which saw Aussies win 18 gold medals, their highest haul ever.\n\nPreviously, Australia’s best gold medal count at any single edition of the Olympics was 17 - won at Athens 2004 and Tokyo 2020. In terms of total medals won, however, Sydney 2000 which yielded 58 medals - 16 gold, 25 silver and 17 bronze - still ranks top.\n\nAt the last edition in Tokyo 2020, Australia won 46 medals, which included 17 top podium finishes.\n\nSwimming has been Australia’s most productive sport at the Olympics, accounting for over 200 of the country’s medals. Athletics is a distant second.\n\nEmma McKeon is the most decorated Australian at the Olympics with 14 medals - six gold, three silver and five bronze. Fellow swimming great Ian Thorpe is the most successful Aussie man at the Summer Games with nine medals - five gold, three silver and one bronze."
