In 2008, he came in to the medal race in silver position and the only one who could take Gold from Paul Goodison. In the medal race a helicopter filming Rasmus Myrgren and Paul Goodison altered the wind so both competitiors started 1 minute after the rest of the fleet consequently finishing last and second to last in the medal race.\n\nThis caused Rasmus Myrgren to finish in 6th place overall at the 2008 Olympic Games.\n\nIn The Olympic Games 2008 and 2012 Rasmus came in to the medal races in 2nd and 3rd place, a result no other laser sailor exceeded. Myrgren also finished 3rd in the 2006 Laser World Championships.\n\nHe has pursued a M.Sc degree in Mechanical Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg."
