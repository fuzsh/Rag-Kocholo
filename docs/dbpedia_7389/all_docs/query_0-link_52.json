[Note from SailRaceWin: The wave actually looks like a powerboat wake... a technique we have used ourselves in sailing photography!]\n\nby Di Pearson\n\nFinally, two more races sailed at the 2011 SAP 505 World Championship as the wind god of Hamilton Island played ball, offering up superb 15-20 knot winds, some great surfing waves and brilliant action that has bought a few competitors much closer to the leading Germans.\n\nAn excellent but by no means easy win for Mike Holt and Carl Smit (USA) in Race 3, and a double celebration for Californian Holt, who celebrated his 43rd birthday yesterday, but as he explained: “It’s today in California – so I’m taking that with our win.”\n\nRace 4 winners, Sandy Higgins/Paul Marsh, along with American’s Howie Hamilin/Andy Zinn and Luke Molloy/Jim Turner (GBR) were the last three boats Holt and Smit had to wear down to cross the line in first, surfing big waves and overcoming shifty unstable winds along the way.\n\n“It was a tough race,” admitted Smit who with Holt finished World’s runners-up in 2009. “Crews kept swapping places back and forth in the top eight or so. The pressure kept changing and we just tried to keep grinding the opposition down.\n\n“Mike had to hike so hard going up the last beat where we got ahead of a couple of boats when we picked the right hand shift, then coming down the run we got the last of them and got away a bit,” Smit said.\n\n“It (the pointscore) is so much closer now, because Ted (Conrads) and Brian (Haines) came second in the second race and Sandy Higgins won the second race, so it moves everyone up closer to Wolfgang (Hunger) and Julien (Kleiner), the German series leaders.\n\nCameron McDonald (AUS) cops some spray. Image copyright Christophe Favreau.\n\nIn fact, only three points separates the top three, with Hunger/Kleiner leading Holt/Smit by two points and Higgins Marsh by a further point. The Germans had an ordinary 15th in Race 4, which has been used as their drop, a far cry from the two bullets they scored on Day 1.\n\nSouth Australians Sandy Higgins and Andrew Chisholm looked set to win Race 3, but as Chisholm explained, “we stuffed up the third beat, were trying to get leverage, but we went the wrong way and finished third.”\n\nNot to be deterred, the two, whose World’s best was a third on home turf in Adelaide in 2007, led Race 4 from go to whoa.\n\nNigel Lott and Bob Franks (AUS) launch off a wave. Image copyright Christophe Favreau.\n\n“We handled the conditions nicely in that one. The breeze had dropped a little, but we did well to hang on in a decent swell and reasonably confused seas,” Chisholm said of the residual effects left from the past few days’ bad weather.\n\n“We had a fairly good hold on the rest of the fleet, but it was close racing all the same,” he allowed.\n\nLike Holt, Chisholm was pleased to be able to close the gap on Hunger and Kleiner. “It’ll be a much closer series now,” he said smiling.\n\nHowie Hamlin/Andy Zinn, Molloy/Turner and Nathan Outteridge/Iain Jensen (AUS) did enough today to stay in touch with the leaders.\n\nStart boat crew acknowledge Sandy Higgins and Paul Marsh's win.

There is little doubt that any other sporting event in Spain has ever reached such a level of international competition.” explains Event Director, Jaume Carbonell.\n\nIn seven of the 10 Olympic classes, the top three will be back to defend their medals.\n\nFor Alessandra Sensini (ITA), the Princesa Sofia Mapfre trophy will be a regatta with multiple objectives: Olympic selection, event title and Ultimate winner Trophy at stake in the women RS:X class. She will face the talented Spanish windsurfers Marina Alabau (ESP), strong from her victory in the Rolex Miami OCR and ISAF Sailor of the Year and SWC winner and World Champion Blanca Manchon (ESP).\n\nIn the Men's division, Byron Kokalanis (GRE) will be back trying to add another victory in a competitive fleet including 2011 Sailing World Cup leader Dorian van Rissejlberge (NED) who started the year with a win in Miami, King Yin Chan (HGK) winner of Sail Melbourne or Julien Bontemps (FRA) 2010 SWC champion.\n\nReigning World champions and 2010 SWC circuit winners Belcher and Page from Australia are expected to take the lead in a strong 470 fleet. Continuing on with their good form, the pair won Sail Melbourne and placed second in the Rolex Miami OCR and will be one of the main threats for last year's winners Leboucher/Garos (FRA).\n\nIf they succeed in keeping the Princesa Sofia trophy title, Julia Conti and Giovanna Micol (ITA) will also score valuable points towards their Olympic quest. But it will not come easy for the 2010 vice European champions, who will firstly have to beat a very talented field. French pair Petitjean/Douroux took first place in Miami at the start of the year. Another SWC circuit title is not excluded and they come to Palma as hot favourites. The German team of Kadelbach/Belcher won Sail Melbourne and is aiming for another title.\n\nThe Star event sailed with the Women Match racing from the Real Club Nautico de Palma has attracted a talent packed fleet. Last year medal winners are back with some crew changes in two teams. Fredrik Loof (SWE) will defend the title with Max Salminen, while Johan Tillander has returned to the Finn. Alexander Schlonski (GER) 2010 Bronze medalist in Palma, with Frithjof Kleen, will return this year with Matthias Bohn. After successfully pairing over the last few months with O'Leary (IRL) in Weymouth, Georg Szabo (USA) at the North American and Scheidt (BRA) at the Eastern Hemisphere championship, Frithjof Kleen will race in Palma with Robert Stanjeck (2009 Princesa Sofia Mapfre winner). The Star competition will be interesting to follow with many renowned sailors like Roy Heiner (NED), Robert Scheidt (BRA); Torben Grael(BRA), Marazzi(SUI), Kusznierewicz(POL) and many more.\n\nThe 24 teams engaged in the Women Match racing will represent 18 countries including Peru. All the favorites will be on the starting line and last year winner Groeneveld(NED) back with a different team. After winning the 2010 SWC, Claire Leroy(FRA) and her team will be back as favourite. The french trio has started the year by winning convincingly the Rolex Miami OCR against Anna Tunnicliffe (USA) in the finale.\n\n2010 Princesa Sofia regatta winners Manu Dyen and Stéphane Christidis (FRA) will face a strong 70 fleet including some strong opponents like the Austrians Nico delle Karth and Nikolau Resch(AUT), Sail Melbourne winners or the british pair of John Pink and Richard Peacock(GBR) victorious in Miami..\n\nThe main absentees in Palma will be the Croatian sailors in the dinghy classes. For Tina Mihelic, Ivan Gaspic and Tonci Stipanovic, the Sailing World Cup circuit will start for them at the next SWC event in Hyères.\n\nTina Mihelic who won the Laser Radial last year, will leave the floor to Marit Bouwemeester (NED) who leads the Sailing World Cup series after two events or Paige Railey (USA) confident after her victory at home in Miami.\n\nIn the Laser men, Tonci Stipanovic, second last year will miss the 2011 event. Javier Hernandez (ESP), SWC winner and second in the 2011 standings, will be among the favourites to retain the title won last year, along with Rasmus Myrgren (SWE) winner in Miami, or Nick Thompson (GBR) leading the series.\n\nMeanwhile the Finns will not miss competition with an all time record fleet of 85 boats. After a brilliant start of the year, the British team will try to continue claiming the top spots. Ben Ainslie (GBR) winner in Sail Melbourne, Giles Scott (GBR) in Miami or Ed Wright (GBR), Palma defending champion, World champion, and SWC winner will set the pace. Olympic Silver medalists Rafa Trujillo (ESP) and Zach Railey (USA), or french Lobert and Lebreton will provide a tough challenge. With the free pumping rule lowered to 10 knots, the athletic level required will reward the fittest.\n\nThe Women Match racing competition will start on Sunday, one day ahead of the other classes, scheduled to commence on Monday.\n\nPrincesa Sofia Trofeo 2011\n\nHEBTRO: \"Sailing: A Sport for Life\" with 3 Generations of the Dickson Family, 3rd April, 20th Anniversary\n\nROY and CHRIS DICKSON and Family , OLYMPIC YACHTSMEN AND WORLD CHAMPION and AMERICAS CUP HEROs, HELP RAISE FUNDS FOR JUNIOR SAILING and CELEBRATE “Sailing: A Sport for Life”\n\nInvited guest in 2008, Kevin Shoebridge, on board an Elliott 6m. Supplied image.\n\nby Mandy Burt\n\nThe Worser Bay Boating Club is hosting its annual Hebtro Trophy celebrity yacht race on Sunday 3rd April. Commodore Andrew Paterson said that “the aim of the day is to raise funds for junior sailing, and in doing so, to have great fun day for all involved”.\n\nThis year’s celebrity is the whole Dickson Family. ”It very appropriate for Worser Bay to have the Dickson Family as this year’s celebrities. Sailing is a Sport for life” and 78 year old Grandfather Roy is still sailing. Father Chris is still enjoying his sailing and his two girls Grace 11 and Rose 9 are Optimist sailors. The Dickson family illustrates what we all know, sailing is a “Sport of Life. Hebtro Trophy fund raising is one of the ways we get our children to start that wonderful life long adventure.” said Andrew Paterson.\n\nThe Hebtro Trophy celebrity yacht race will take place in the waters off Worser Bay, with around 20 Port Nic keelboats, each carrying a sponsor and junior sailors. The Hebtro Trophy fundraising day is in its 20th year and continues to raise the funds needed to enable many Wellington children to get out on the water. Each year these funds give around 250 school children an opportunity to have a go at sailing, and a further 60 take part in subsided Lean to Sail Courses. The Club also uses the funds for coaching for junior sailors over summer weekends. “Our aim is for children and young people to experience and enjoy sailing, whether in future years they aspire to go to the Olympics or join Team New Zealand or to simply go for a cruise around the harbour” said Andrew. Several graduates of our programs supported by Hebtro funds are now making names for themselves on the national and international level, and at least one recent graduate from the Worser Bay program has set his sights on the 2012 Olympic games. These you people will be back helping with Hebtro again this season.\n\nTerry Steven shows young Worser Bay sailors how to hike keeler style.

Having grown by 65% on the previous year´s campaign is the result of our drive to be in the vanguard of technology, especially when talking about the audio-visual field, where we have aimed to bring new communication tools to the wider public”.\n\nThe countries which offered more TV coverage of the Audi MedCup Circuit in 2010 were, in order of importance, Spain, France, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom and Portugal. Also, the study shows supplementary returns in countries that are not considered as much target markets for the Circuit.\n\n“Last year, we had a great impact in Argentina and New Zealand, in no small way due to teams such Matador and Emirates Team New Zealand being successful on the Circuit”, notes Ignaci Triay, Audi MedCup Circuit Director, “ and the fact that we had well-known stars of the sailing world such as Dean Barker or Ray Davies, great skippers and sailors, who come from these countries”.\n\nMedia presence\n\nMedia content regarding the Audi MedCup Circuit has also increased across the different platforms. The 2009 campaign registered a total of 1.201 published articles, and 2010 reached a higher number: 1.437, with an equivalent value of 7,3 million euros.\n\nSome of the most important international written press publications -both general and specialized- such as Le Figaro and L´Equipe (Francia), The Sunday Telegraph and The Times (United Kingdom), ABC, MARCA, La Vanguardia and El Mundo Deportivo (Spain), published articles about the circuit on their pages.\n\nImage © Virtual Eye/ Audi MedCup.\n\nA total of 546 international journalists from 11 different countries were accredited to work over the regattas, a clear reflection of the circuit´s international reach over recent years.\n\nLive TV\n\nLive transmission of the circuit´s regattas through the new Audi MedCup TV platform, built in www.medcup.org, started out in 2010 among some of the innovations that developed such a significant media impact. With this initiative, the circuit has become a prime example of the use of the latest technologies for the transmission of this type of racing, an initiative that was also supported by an improved Virtual Eye technology that allows viewers to follow the regatta in 3D with a level of realism that has never seen before.\n\nImage © Virtual Eye/ Audi MedCup.\n\nAnother innovation which brought great success from the media, teams, guests and sponsors was the addition of the Crew+ initiative, a project that allowed one person to be on board in each and one of the boats during the regatta, experiencing the race in person, something that few other sports can claim to offer.\n\nAlso, the Audi MedCup Circuit consolidated its complete on-shore programme of activities which make the public´s involvement with the events so successful. In 2010 this included the Public Village, a free entrance zone with a wide range of activities designed to make the event even more exciting and engaging for the local visitor, registering a total attendance of over half a million people. Interactive games and infotainment -information - entertainment-, sailing-related games, a huge TV screen or live music shows were some of the attractiont that its visitors enjoyed in 2010.\n\nAudi MedCup\n\nLes Voiles de St Barth 2011: Exceptional Crews\n\nWhite Wings © Christophe Jouany.\n\nby Sabina Mollart-Rogerson\n\nThere will be more than fifty of them: yachts of every size and class from all over the Caribbean, competing at Les Voiles de St. Barth. For the second year, the St. Barth Yacht Club and their partners have come up with a spectacular program for this international yachting event that runs from April 4 – 9. Some of the most notable yachts with their experienced crew will be on hand for a week of racing on the fantastic sailing waters of the Caribbean. Maxi yachts, multihulls, and classic yachts have answered the call to compete at Les Voiles de St. Barth, where competitors can look forward to challenging sailing among the surrounding islands and where, back ashore, they can be certain of a friendly welcome.\n\nWhile the island of St. Barth is a tranquil place for a quiet holiday, the waters around it guarantee that even the most reserved yachtsman will be thrilled. In any case, the yachts registered for the second edition of the Les Voiles are not going to have a quiet time of it. This is proven by the crew lists, which note the presence of some of the top skippers and crew from the international yachting world.\n\nThe 97-foot canting keel maxi Genuine Risk, a Dubois-designed boat that recently won the Pineapple Cup Montego Bay Race will have the Swede Hugo Stenbeck at her helm. A successful ice hockey player, Stenbeck led the Swedish America’s Cup team, Victory Challenge, in Valencia in 2007. He will head an international all-star crew with a wealth of experience, including the American Ralf Steitz, who crewed for Dennis Conner during his America’s Cup campaigns. The Frenchman, Laurent Delage, who was the sail designer for Victory Challenge, has two Olympic medals in the 470 class and will be offering a French touch to the Swedish team, though it also includes Danish tactician Rasmus Kostner, who previously sailed with Mascalzone Latino in the 2007 America’s Cup.\n\nFormer America’s Cup helmsman, New Zealander Gavin Brady will be onboard the TP52 Vesper/Team Moneypenny (ex-Quantum Racing). Brady will be co-helming with owner Jim Swartz (Park City, Utah), and will be relying on the skills of Ben Beer, Jamie Gale, Brett Jones, Ken Keefe and Matt Wakowicz.\n\nAnother American competitor that everyone will be watching is the 2010 Les Voile de St. Barth Maxi class winner George David, who will be onboard the Juan Kouyoumdjian-designed Rambler 100 (ex-Speedboat), which recently won the RORC Caribbean 600. Short daily races will provide a change for the crew which is made up almost entirely of members of the Puma Ocean Racing team led by American Ken Read (Newport, RI). At Les Voiles, they will have to deal with close quarters buoy racing, where strategy is often more important than sheer speed. For their second go at Les Voiles, Read and his crew, from six different nations, are taking this event very seriously and see it as part of their preparation for the upcoming Volvo Ocean Race. “After all,” Read explained, \"Rambler 100 is just a more powerful version of a Volvo 70.\"\n\nImage © Christophe Jouany.\n\nAs for French sailors, Lionel Péan has been enlisted by the British owner, Peter Harrison, to race onboard the 115-foot Sojana. The Farr-designed ketch is a perfect example of first-class yachting and was designed for cruising and speed. The well-known French fashion photographer – and last year’s godfather of Les Voiles – Patrick Demarchelier will be racing again aboard his impeccable Swan 45, Puffy, in the Racing class. There he will come up against some other Frenchmen including Régis Guillemot and his Pogo 40, in what is likely to be a closely fought contest in the Racing class, 50 feet and over.\n\nAll of these world-class sailors will come together on Monday, April 4 at Les Voiles de St. Barth’s official registration and the opening ceremony, to mark the start of a week of exciting racing. The event will offer spectators an amazing sight with a great fleet of boats enjoying the tail end of the sailing season on the blue-green waters off Saint Barth.\n\nKey information:\n\nLes Voiles de St. Barth will be hosted from April 4 – 9 2011 by the St. Barth Yacht Club, which is affiliated with the French Sailing Federation and the Caribbean Sailing Association.\n\n\"More than 50 yachts have registered for Les Voiles de St. Barth 2011 (complete entry list is online at: www.lesvoilesdesaintbarth.com) and they will be split into five classes:\n\nSUPER / MAXI YACHT: a prototype or boat produced in limited numbers measuring at least 21 metres (69’) in length.\n\nCLASSIC: referred to as classic or traditional yachts, these boats must be at least 35 years old.\n\nRACING: racing monohulls, designed specifically for coastal or offshore racing.\n\nRACING/CRUISING: mostly series boats, which are designed for cruising and for racing.\n\nRACING-MULTIHULLS: Racing multihulls, including trimarans and catamarans, between 30 - 60 feet in length, which are very light and fast.\n\nLes Voiles de St. Barth will officially begin on Monday April 4, 2011 with the registration and the official opening of the Race Village on Quai du Général De Gaulle in Gustavia.\n\nThe Race Committee, led once again by principal race officer, Luc Poupon, will signal the start of the first race at 1300 (local time) on Tuesday, April 5. Racing for the rest of the week (Wednesday – Saturday) will begin at 1100. Thursday, April 7 will be a lay day, which will give the crews a chance to relax and enjoy themselves with a full and varied program of events planned at St Jean Beach. The closing ceremony and fireworks will follow the awards ceremony on Saturday, April 9.\n\nFor more information, visit www.lesvoilesdesaintbarth.com\n\nVeteran Takes on the Pros at SAP 505 Worlds\n\nEarle Alexander giving the young blokes a run for their money. Image copyright Christophe Favreau.\n\nby Di Pearson\n\nSailing is one of those sports where even at the elite level, age can a benefit rather than a barrier, and that is the case with 67 year-old Brisbane skipper Earle Alexander, who is competing at the 2011 SAP 505 World Championship at Hamilton Island this week.\n\nAlexander, who will turn 68 in June, and is a survivor of prostate cancer, reckons big boat yacht racing “is for old blokes – and I’m not old enough.” That line has insulted some big name yacht racers, but Alexander doesn’t care. He wants to keep sailing the highly technical and fast 505 double-handed trapeze dinghy.\n\nNot only is the dinghy a hard one to sail, Alexander has pitted himself against some of the world’s finest sailors, including Olympic medallists, Volvo Ocean Race crews, America’s Cup sailors and quite a few world champions from various classes, including the 505. He is currently 37th in the 85-boat fleet.\n\nAge has not wearied this competitive sailor who “mucked around in Moth’s at Balmoral in Sydney where I was born.” However, university study, then his career as a mining engineer took precedence over everything else when the sailor moved to the bush.\n\nEventually, he married, had children and moved his family to Mt Isa in Queensland. While living there, he bought a Corsair and sailed it with his sons on the dam. A few years later, his sons grew and pursued sailing with friends.\n\nBoth Kim and his younger brother Nick won 420 double-handed sailing national titles – both with recognised Olympic campaigners of the future, Adrian Finglas and Teague Czislowski. It tells plenty about their ‘old man’s’ sailing talent.\n\nAlexander moved to Brisbane and in 1985, purchased his first 505 as a member of the Humpybong Yacht Club. Dave Porter and Dean Blatchford were just two of the famous names who came to help set the class up.\n\nThere were half a dozen or so 505 dinghies at the Club, which prompted the veteran sailor to buy one. He hasn’t looked back and still relishes every opportunity to sail. “Everything in moderation though. You have to make time for your family, work and other things too,” Alexander says.\n\nHe and crew and friend of 25 years, Australian 505 president Ian Gregg, have sailed together for six years now. “I was very ordinary for a long time. I didn’t really get it (how to sail the boat) until Ian came along,” Alexander says.\n\nNow sailing at Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron, Alexander admits: “We took a quantum leap from there, because we started calibrating the rig and settings. We got a lot of help from people like Howie Hamlin (USA), Ian Pinnell (GBR) and Holger Jess (the German 505 builder and competitor).\n\n“Those guys are the best and they’re happy to share their knowledge. Why reinvent the wheel when you can get what you need from these guys,” he asks.\n\nAn exponent of the class, Alexander says: “I love the 505’s. They’re good in all conditions. I once sailed at Hayling Island (UK) and we got a 42 knot gust and we were still sailing along OK.\n\nHe still remembers his and Gregg’s best result, a sixth at the 2008 Nationals, also sailed at Hamilton Island. “We won on the windiest day, and backed up for second the next day, which was also windy. I love the big weather best.”\n\nThere are some, but not so many guys still sailing dinghies and skiffs into their sixties. Alexander puts some of his fitness down to, “eating properly and sailing as much as I can.\n\nWhen questioned, rival competitors confirm Alexander is competitive, and not just there to make up the numbers and they find him inspirational – and why wouldn’t they? These are not easy boats to sail.\n\n“I got prostate cancer five years ago and luckily I recovered. From that, I’ve learned to be more relaxed and to stay fit; and that’s a good thing, because I travel the world as a consultant now, and I sail at different venues around the world, so relaxing and staying fit are necessary,” Alexander confides.\n\nWhen does the Queenslander see himself giving 505 sailing away? “I don’t. I’ll do it till I fall off my perch. I’ll just take each year as it comes,” he says.\n\nFamily and fans can follow racing live via the tracker with SAP analysis, video and more on the official site at: www.505sapworldchampionship2011.com"
