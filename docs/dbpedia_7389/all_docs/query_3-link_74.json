Jay Cohen The Associated Press LONDON �?\" Kevin Durant helped the U.S. team put sway Argentina with one impressive shooting burst. Durant scored 17 of his 28 points during the Americans�?T 42-point third quarter, turning a one-point game into a blowout that sent the U.S. soaring into the quarterfinals with a 126-97 victory over Argentina. Carmelo Anthony made a 3-pointer in the final second of the big third while taking what he and the U.S. bench ri^t behind him felt was a cheap shot from Argentina�?Ts Facundo Campazzo, setting off an exchange of words and technical fouls. The Americans (5-0) wdll play Australia (3-2) in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Also Monday, American judo fighter Nick Delpopolo apologized after he was expelled from the Olympics for doping, blaming the disqualification on his unintentional consumption of something baked with marijuana Delpopolo is the first of the 10,500 London Games athletes to fail an in-competition doping test. Jenn Suhr has been America�?Ts best female pole vaulter for a while. Now she�?Ts the best in the world. Suhr rounded out her resume with Olympic gold, vaulting 15 feet, 7 inches to defeat Cuba�?Ts Yarisiey SUva, who cleared the same hei^t but lost on a tiebreaker because she had one more miss in the competition. Suhr also beat two-time defending Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva of Russia, who failed to become the first woman to win the same individual track and field event at three consecutive Olympics. Isinbayeva settled for bronze with a vault of 15-5. Grenada�?Ts Kirani lames won the men�?Ts 400 meters and 35-year-old Felix Sanchez of the Dominican Republic took the men�?Ts 400-meter hurdles on a rainy night at Olympic Stadium. Other track and field vwnners included Belarus�?T Nadzeya Ostapchuk (women�?Ts shot put) and Russia�?Ts Yuliya Zaripova (women�?Ts 3,(X)0-meter steeplechase). Michael Tmsley' was second in the 400 hurdles, but it was a disappointing session for the U.S. overaU. The U.S. was vdthout a representative in the 400 final, and it was the fii^t time since the 1980 Moscow Games that someone other than an American won the race. \"It�?Ts probably crazy' at home right now,�?� James said. �?oThere�?Ts probably a road party right now in the streets. I don�?Tt think there are any words to describe the celebration right now.�?� In gymnastics, Gabby Douglas was nowhere near the podium this time. The all-around champion, who also helped the United States to team gold, finished last on uneven bars. Russia�?Ts Aliya Mustafina rallied to the victory. �?oToward the end of the Olympics, you get mentally' and physically tired and you�?Tre just like drained,�?� Douglas said. �?o1 tried to fight throu^ it as much as I could.�?� Mustafina, who injured her left knee in April 2011, gave Russia its first gold in women�?Ts gymnastics in London. This completed her medal set following a silver in team competition and bronze in all-around.

The Americans have dropped two straight and will face undefeated Croatia in the quarterfinals on Wednesday. Hungary plays Italy. Spain takes on Montenegro and Australia faces Serbia in the other quarters. Cycling Jason Kenny won the sprint for Britain�?Ts fifth gold medal out of a possible seven in track cycling. Kenny earned his first win against three-time worid champion Gregory Bauge of France. The 24-year-old from Bolton, outside Manchester, made good on the British team�?Ts decision to enter him in the event instead of defending champkxi Chris Hoy. Bauge failed in his bid to tiecome the first Frenchman to win the Olympic sprint title in 40 years. Shane Perkins of Australia claimed the t>ronze medal. Sailing Tom Slingsby of Australia won the men�?Ts Laser class by match-racing closest competitor Pavtos Kontides to the back of the fleet. Kontides took the silver, the first-ever Olympic medal for Cyprus, the small island natk>n that started taking part in the games in Moscow in 1980. Diving Ilya Zakharov of Russia led the men�?Ts 3-meter springtxjard preliminaries, with He Chong of China close tjehind in second during a competition mart<ed by pratfalls. Zakharov totaled 507.65 points during the six rounds. He, v^rho was ninth after his first dive, totaled 500.90 while opening defense of his Olympk: title. Troy Dumais of the U.S. was third at 486.60 after rallying from sixth in the fourth round. Two divers scored all zeros, while two others got low scores for badly botching their dives. Synclironized swimming Natalia Ishchenko and Svetlana Romashina head into the duet final as top qualifiers after the preliminary free routine.

Field hockey Three-time Olympic champion Australia was knocked out of the women�?Ts tournament when it played a scoreless draw against worid champion Argentina.

Handi>all Daniel Narcisse scored six goals and defending champion France t>eat Sweden 29-26 to reach the men�?Ts quarterfinals.

Untted States 8SOCCER Fronn B1 Next comes the game the U.S. players have been eyeing for more than a year, a rematch with Japan on Thursday at Wembley Stadium with gold on the line. The top-ranked Americans lost to Japan on penalty kicks in the World Cup final last summer, a stunning blow that became a source of motivation as the players prepared for the London Olympics. \"This is redemption for us,�?� midfielder Carli Lloyd said. \"We know how hard it was for us after that game. It hurt us for a really long time.\" The Americans overcame three one-goal deficits, all due to Christine Sinclair goals in the 22nd, 67th and 73rd minutes. Megan Rapinoe scored in the 54th and 70th minutes, and Wambach in the 80th for the U.S., leaving Sinclair and Wambach tied at No. 2 with 143 international goals apiece, both chasing Mia Hamm�?Ts worid record of 158. It was the sequence that led to Wambach�?Ts tying goal that left the Canadians fuming. It started when goalkeeper Erin McLeod was whistled for holding the ball more than sbc seconds, a call even U.S. coach Pia Sund-hage said she had never seen before. That gave the Americans an indirect free kick inside the area. Rapinoe took the kick and rammed it into the Canadian wall, the ball glancing off the arm of Marie-Eve Nault. Referee Christiana Pedersen of Norway then awarded the U.S. a penalty kick, which Wambach converted off the left post, McLeod said she did not receive the usual warning from the referee about holding the ball too long, although she said the linesman had told her at the start of the second half not to slow down play. \"I think the referee was very onesided,�?� McLeod said. �?oIt was an interesting sequence of events. I think we outplayed the Americans the entire game. I think it�?Ts unfortunate the calls went the way that they did. Of course, the Americans are a great soccer team, and today we were better, and the luck went their way.�?� Canada coach John Herdman said he felt the referee also missed a hand ball in front of the U.S. goal. �?oThe ref, she will have to sleep in bed tonight after watching the replays,�?� Herdman said. �?oShe�?Ts gonna have to live with that. We will move on from this. I wonder if she will be able to.�?� Canada, seeking the country�?Ts first Summer Games medal in a traditional team sport since 1936, wiU play France for the bronze on Thursday at Coventry. The U.S. team has played in the tide match in every Summer Games since women�?Ts soccer was introduced in Atlanta in 1996, winning the gold in 1996, 2004 and 2008, and the silver in 2000. But in many ways this win was reminiscent of the landmark comeback victory against Brazil in last year�?Ts World Cup, when Wambach willed the team to a shootout win in the quarterfinals. With that kind of history, she knew her teammates could rally against the Canadians. \"Even when they scored their third goal, there was something in me that knew that we had more, that we could give more,�?� Wambach said. The result maintains the Americans�?T dominance of their neighbor to the north, extending their unbeaten streak against Canada to 27 games (23-0-4). The U.S. leads the series 44-3-5, the last loss coming at the Algarve Cup in 2001. Herdman said before the game that the run of futility against the Americans was on the minds of his players, and he addressed it with them in the run-up to the match. He also injected some pregame intrigue by accusing the Americans of using �?ohighly illegal,�?� overly physical tactics on free kicks and comer kicks. \"Their coach prepared them very well,�?� Wambach said. �?oHe had a very good tactic yesterday, by making it a media (event) to say that we do Ulegal stuff. I give him credit for that because it�?Ts something that he was trying to do to rally his team around him.�?� Joseph Whits can be reached at http://twitter.com/JGmiteAP.\n\nSearch the The Chronicle Telegram Today with a Free Trial\n\nWe want people to find what they are looking for at NewspaperArchive.
