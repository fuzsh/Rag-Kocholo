The 25-year-old added a front flip to her 360 backflip and closed with another backflip for a 97.5.\n\nSwitzerland’s Nikita Ducarroz took bronze with an 89.2 in her second run.\n\nMEN’S PARK\n\nAustralia’s Logan Martin capped quite a show in BMX freestyle’s Olympic debut, putting together a sterling first run to win gold at the Tokyo Games.\n\nThe 27-year-old two-time world champion posted a 93.3 in his first ride and watched as the other eight riders failed to catch him. Martin went for a victory lap after the final rider made his second run, but cut it short after a hard landing on a jump.\n\nVenezuela’s Daniel Dhers secured silver with a 92.05 on his second run and Britain’s Declan Brooks had a second-run 90.8 to take bronze.\n\n___\n\nDIVING\n\nWOMEN’S 3-METER SPRINGBOARD\n\nChina’s Shi Tingmao captured her second straight gold medal in women’s 3-meter springboard diving.\n\nShi romped to an easy win over teammate Wang Han with 383.50 points.

Romain Cannone won the men’s epee individual. It’s the first win in men’s team foil for the country since the 2000 Sydney Games.\n\nThe ROC still finished the fencing slate with eight medals and four golds.\n\nThe United States team of Alexander Massialas, Race Imboden and Gerek Meinhardt won the bronze with a 45-31 victory over Japan.\n\n___\n\nGOLF\n\nMEN’S INDIVIDUAL STROKE\n\nXander Schauffele won the Olympic gold medal in golf in a tense finish.\n\nSchauffele was tied for the lead with Rory Sabbatini of Slovakia with two holes to play.\n\nSabbatini set an Olympic record with a 61 and won the silver. Hideki Matsuyama missed a 12-foot birdie putt on the last hole that would have secured him the bronze. He was in a seven-man playoff for the final medal.\n\n___\n\nGYMNASTICS\n\nMEN’S FLOOR EXERCISE\n\nArtem Dolgopyat won Israel’s first-ever Olympic medal in artistic gymnastics. Dolgopyat captured gold in the men’s floor exercise by edging Rayderley Zapata of Spain on a tiebreak.\n\nDolgopyat and Zapata were both awarded a score of 14.933 during the event finals. They both had matching execution scores during their routines. Dolgopyat earned the gold because his set was slightly more difficult than Zapata’s.\n\nXiao Ruoteng of China earned the bronze for his third medal in Tokyo. He took silver in the men’s all-around and won a bronze during the team event last week.\n\nMEN’S POMMEL HORSE\n\nMax Whitlock of Britain defended his Olympic title in pommel horse.\n\nWhitlock led off the eight-man final and posted a score of 15,583 points.

The medals she won in Tokyo are the first and second ever for Brazil in gymnastics at the Games.\n\nAmerican MyKayla Skinner, who entered the competition after defending Olympic champion Simone Biles pulled out to focus on her mental health, captured the silver.\n\nYeo Seojeong of Korea took the bronze.\n\n___\n\nSAILING\n\nMEN’S ONE-PERSON DINGHY LASER\n\nAustralian Matt Wearn has won gold in the men’s one-person laser event at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nHe finished second in the medal race, scoring four points, which was enough for the win.\n\nJean Baptiste Bernaz of France won the medal race at Enoshima Yacht Harbor, but his total score of 92 meant that he finished sixth overall.\n\nWearn scored a total of 53 points overall, while Croatia’s Tonci Stipanovic took silver with 82.\n\nHermann Tomasgaard scored 85 to clinch the bronze, giving Norway its first medal in sailing since 2004.\n\nWOMMEN’S ONE-PERSON DINGHY LASER\n\nAnne-Marie Rindom of Denmark has won gold in the women’s one-person dinghy laser sailing event at Enoshima Yacht Harbor.\n\nRindom finished seventh in the medal race, but clinched gold with 78 points total.\n\nIt’s the first gold medal for Rindom, who won bronze in the same event in 2016.\n\nSweden’s Josefin Olsson crossed the finish line first but took silver with 81 points. Marit Bouwmeester of the Netherlands had to return to the start at the beginning of the race, but managed to win bronze. She won silver in London in 2012 and gold in Rio in 2016.\n\n___\n\nSWIMMING\n\nMEN’S 50M FREESTYLE\n\nAmerican Caeleb Dressel cruised to a relatively easy victory in 50-meter freestyle, touching in an Olympic record of 21.07 seconds.\n\nFrance’s Florent Manaudou repeated as the Olympic silver medalist in 21.55, while Brazil’s Bruno Fratus claimed the bronze in 21.57 -- edging out American Michael Andrew for the final spot on the podium.\n\nWOMEN’S 50M FREESTYLE\n\nAustralia’s Emma McKeon claimed the gold medal in the women’s 50-meter freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMcKeon completed a sweep of the 50- and 100-meter freestyle with an Olympic-record time of 23.81 seconds. The silver went to Sweden’s Sarah Sjöström in 24.07, while defending Olympic champion Pernille Blume of Denmark settled for bronze in 24.21.\n\nMEN’S 1500M FREESTYLE\n\nAmerican Bobby Finke won gold in the grueling men’s 1,500-meter freestyle race.\n\nJust as he did in winning the 800-meter freestyle, Finke stayed closed throughout the 30-lap race and turned on the speed at the end. He touched in 14 minutes, 39.65 seconds.\n\nUkraine’s Mykhailo Romanchuk took the silver in 14:40.66, while the bronze went to Germany’s Florian Wellbrock in 14:40.91.\n\nWOMEN’S 4x100M MEDLEY\n\nAustralia won gold in the women’s 4x100 medley relay.\n\nCapping a brilliant performance by the entire Aussie women’s team, Emma McKeon followed her victory in the 50-freestyle earlier in the session to take the butterfly leg on the relay. Cate Campbell closed strong on the freestyle, touching in an Olympic record of 3 minutes, 51.60 seconds to edge the two-time defending champion Americans.\n\nKaylee McKeown and Chelsea Hodges started things off for the winning Australian team.\n\nAbbey Weitzeil touched in 3:51.73 to give the United States a silver. She anchored a team that also included teenagers Regan Smith, Lydia Jacoby and Torri Huske.\n\nThe bronze went to Canada.\n\nMEN’S 4x100M MEDLEY\n\nAmerican Caeleb Dressel swam the butterfly leg as the Americans set a world record in the 4x100-meter medley relay with a time of 3 minutes, 26.78 seconds. That eclipses the mark of 3:27.28 they set at the 2009 Rome world championships in rubberized suits.\n\nRyan Murphy, Michael Andrew and Zach Apple joined Dressel on the winning team.\n\nBritain won silver in 3:27.51 and Italy won bronze 3:29.17.\n\n___\n\nTENNIS\n\nWOMEN’S DOUBLES\n\nThe top-seeded Czech team of Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova won gold in women’s doubles at the tennis tournament.\n\nThe Czechs beat the Swiss team of Belinda Bencic and Viktorija Golubic.

Pablo Carreno Busta of Spain won bronze Saturday.\n\nMIXED DOUBLES\n\nAnastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Andrey Rublev beat Russian teammates Elena Vesnina and Aslan Karatsev 6-3, 6-7 (5), 13-11 for gold in mixed doubles.\n\nAsh Barty and John Peers of Australia won bronze.\n\n___\n\nTRACK AND FIELD\n\nMEN’S 100-METER\n\nMarcell Jacobs won the men’s Olympic 100-meter race, crossing the line in 9.8 seconds to bring the marquee sprint gold to Italy for the first time.\n\nEven in a race with no clear favorites, Jacobs was a surprise. He topped America’s Fred Kerley and Canada’s Andre DeGrasse to take the spot held for the past 13 years by the now-retired Usain Bolt.\n\nBorn in El Paso, Texas, Jacobs moved to Italy as a young boy when the U.S. military transferred his dad to South Korea. He was a long-jump specialist for years, and his biggest major success was an indoor 60-meter win at European champions.\n\nMEN’S HIGH JUMP\n\nMutaz Barshim of Qatar and Gianmarco Tamberi of Italy tied for the gold medal in the men’s high jump at the Tokyo Games.\n\nBoth men were clean at every attempt to 2.37 meters and both missed all three attempts at the Olympic record of 2.39.\n\nThe 30-year-old Barshim was the silver medalist at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games and was also on the podium at the 2012 London Games. He won the world championship gold medal at home in Qatar in 2019.\n\nGianmarco Tamberi is a former world indoor champion.\n\nMaksim Nedasekau of Belarus won the bronze medal. He also cleared 2.37 for a national record.\n\nSHOT PUT\n\nGong Lijiao of China won her first Olympic gold medal in the shot put with a personal best of 20.58 meters.\n\nThe reigning two-time world champion produced two efforts over 20 meters on her last two attempts at the Olympic Stadium to cement her victory ahead of Raven Saunders of the United States, who took the silver medal with 19.79.\n\nVeteran Valerie Adams of New Zealand won a bronze medal with 19.62 in her fifth and likely last Olympics.\n\nWOMEN’S TRIPLE JUMP\n\nYulimar Rojas of Venezuela set a world record with her final attempt to win the women’s triple jump gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nRojas finished the competition with a mark of 15.67 meters to break a record set in 1995. Inessa Kravets of Ukraine held the record at 15.50.\n\nRojas broke the Olympic record of 15.39 with her first attempt in the final. The two-time world champion won a silver medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\nPatricia Mamona of Portugal took silver and Ana Peleteiro of Spain won bronze.\n\n___\n\nWEIGHTLIFTING\n\nWOMEN’S 76KG\n\nNeisi Dajomes of Ecuador has won the women’s 76-kilogram weightlifting event as Kate Nye took silver for the United States’ best result in the sport since 2000.\n\nDajomes lifted 118 kilograms in the snatch and 145kg in the clean and jerk for a total 263, beating Nye by 14kg.\n\nIt’s Ecuador’s second gold of the Tokyo Olympics after Richard Carapaz won the men’s cycling road race, and only the South American nation’s fourth medal of any sort in history.\n\nAremi Fuentes took bronze for Mexico on a total 245kg.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2020-tokyo-olympics and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"
