        "text": "Zaman was a paper that had close ties to the Gülen movement and an Islamic-conservative profile. It was Turkey's best-selling newspaper and had a large percentage of subscribers. In 1995 it became the first paper in Turkey to launch an online edition. In 2013 it changed its stance from pro-government to strongly critical of the government. On 27 July 2016, following the failed coup, it was banned and closed down by decree. Many of its employees have been accused by the government of involvement in the coup and are now in prison or living in exile."
