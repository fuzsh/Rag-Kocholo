        "text": "Turkey's biggest newspaper, Zaman, has published an edition carrying pro-government articles, two days after being taken over by authorities.\n\nOn Friday, a court ruled that Zaman, previously linked to an opponent of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, should now be run by administrators.\n\nIts last edition under old ownership on Saturday said Turkey's press had seen one of its \"darkest days\".\n\nMeanwhile, a newspaper set up by former Zaman staff was launched on Sunday.\n\nPolice raided Zaman's Istanbul offices late on Friday hours after a court ruling placed it under state control, but managers were still able to get Saturday's edition to print.\n\nNo reason was given by the court for the decision.\n\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said the takeover was \"legal, not political\".\n\n\"It is out of the question for either me or any of my colleagues to interfere in this process,\" he said in a television interview.\n\nWater cannon and tear gas were used against some 500 Zaman supporters gathered in front of its headquarters on Saturday.\n\nZaman journalists who arrived to work on Saturday said their access to internal servers had been denied. Its editor-in-chief Abdulhamit Bilici and a leading columnist were also fired.\n\nThe European Union's response has been to issue weak statements of concern, the BBC's Mark Lowen says.\n\nIt is accused of acting softly on Turkey as it needs the country's support in managing the refugee crisis.\n\nThe government in Ankara has come under increasing international criticism over its treatment of journalists.\n\nThe EU's diplomatic service said that Turkey \"needs to respect and promote high democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media\", while the US described the move as \"troubling\"."
