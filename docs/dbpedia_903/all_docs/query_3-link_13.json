        "text": "Turkish police have raided the offices of Zaman, the country's biggest newspaper, hours after a court ruling placed it under state control.\n\nPolice entered the building in Istanbul late on Friday, firing tear gas at protesters who had gathered outside.\n\nZaman is closely linked to the Hizmet movement of influential US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen.\n\nTurkey says Hizmet is a \"terrorist\" group aiming to overthrow President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government.\n\nMr Gulen was once an ally of Mr Erdogan but the two fell out.\n\nMany Hizmet supporters have been arrested.\n\nThe government in Ankara has come under increasing international criticism over its treatment of journalists.\n\nThe court ruled on Friday that Zaman, that has a circulation of some 650,000, external, should now be run by administrators. No explanation was given.\n\nLater, hundreds of Zaman supporters gathered outside the newspaper's offices to protest at the state takeover. One held a placard saying, \"We will fight for a free press.\"\n\nPolice used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters.\n\nThe US state department described the takeover as \"the latest in a series of troubling judicial and law enforcement actions taken by the Turkish government\".\n\nThe move against Zaman comes days after Turkey's Constitutional Court ordered the release from detention of two Turkish journalists charged with revealing state secrets.\n\nCan Dundar and Erdem Gul, from the newspaper Cumhuriyet, were detained in November over a report alleging that the Turkish government had tried to ship arms to Islamists in Syria.\n\nThe pair still face possible life sentences at their trial on 25 March.\n\nLast year, two newspapers and two television channels were put under state administration over their alleged links with the Hizmet movement."
