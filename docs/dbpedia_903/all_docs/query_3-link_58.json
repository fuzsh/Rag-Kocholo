        "text": "Mercer, the investment consulting arm of US services company Marsh & McLennan, expects its wealth division to at least double its assets under management (AUM) in the Middle East as wealth in the region continues to grow despite economic headwinds, a company official said.\n\nMercer Wealth, which globally has $160 billion in AUM, plans to boost its AUM in the region to $2-$3bn in the next 2-3 years from the present $1bn, said Yasir AbuShaban, a Dubai-based principal with Mercer Wealth.\n\n“Within the next two to three years, we are looking at reaching $2 to $3 billion as a conservative estimate and we do see an opportunity to do so,” said Mr AbuShaban.\n\nMercer does not directly make investments, but allocates clients’ money they have discretion to, to professional asset managers. They also provide advice to clients.\n\n“We have buying power. We can negotiate on their (client’s) behalf with asset managers to provide them lower fees than they otherwise would have to get on their own,” he added.\n\nMercer Wealth’s clients include sovereign wealth funds, family offices, and insurance companies among others.\n\nFrom its office in Dubai, Mercer also looks after Africa, India and Turkey, where they also see opportunity for growth.\n\nWealth creation in Middle East and Africa (MEA) grew 8.5 per cent to $8.1 trillion last year from $7.5tn in 2015, higher than last year’s global average of 6 per cent and the second-highest growth in a region after Asia-Pacific which grew 9.9 per cent, according to consultancy Boston Consulting Group (BCG). In the region, where wealth grew just 1.9 per cent in 2015 compared with 2014, a pickup in oil prices has helped in wealth generation.\n\nBCG is forecasting MEA wealth will rise to $12tn by 2021, growing at an annual average of 8 per cent.\n\nDrivers of wealth generation in the region will be split evenly between new wealth creation and growth of performance of existing assets, according to BCG.\n\nAnother general trend in the region is clients’ looking for a comprehensive approach to investing, according to Mr AbuShaban.\n\n“Institutional investors or some of the families are seeing a slowdown in the available capital they have to invest and in that sense they are looking at optimizing the way they manage their portfolios and making sure they are not investing haphazardly and different parts of their investment are working together,” said Mr AbuShaban.\n\nSome clients also have a higher appetite for risk, given the low interest-rate environment that does not provide enough yield for some institutional investors. These clients are keen to invest in illiquid assets, such as private equity and infrastructure.\n\n“What we have seen is a desire for higher returns in what has been a low-return environment specifically in various fixed income or bonds,” he said.\n\n“In this environment, we have seen a de facto increase in the risk that clients are taking in things like illiquid investments, private equity investments, infrastructure and private debt, those kind of investments were higher illiquidity results in incrementally higher returns.”\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds, said in its 2016 report that has gradually increased its exposure in direct private equity and private credit transactions, mainly in Asian markets and especially in China and India. The authority’s private equity department focused on structured equities owing to “their defensive characteristics.”\n\nGirls full-contact rugby may be in its infancy in the Middle East, but there are already a number of role models for players to look up to.\n\nSophie Shams (Dubai Exiles mini, England sevens international)\n\nAn Emirati student who is blazing a trail in rugby. She first learnt the game at Dubai Exiles and captained her JESS Primary school team. After going to study geophysics at university in the UK, she scored a sensational try in a cup final at Twickenham. She has played for England sevens, and is now contracted to top Premiership club Saracens.\n\n----\n\nSeren Gough-Walters (Sharjah Wanderers mini, Wales rugby league international)\n\nFew players anywhere will have taken a more circuitous route to playing rugby on Sky Sports. Gough-Walters was born in Al Wasl Hospital in Dubai, raised in Sharjah, did not take up rugby seriously till she was 15, has a master’s in global governance and ethics, and once worked as an immigration officer at the British Embassy in Abu Dhabi. In the summer of 2021 she played for Wales against England in rugby league, in a match that was broadcast live on TV.\n\n----\n\nErin King (Dubai Hurricanes mini, Ireland sevens international)\n\nAged five, Australia-born King went to Dubai Hurricanes training at The Sevens with her brothers. She immediately struck up a deep affection for rugby. She returned to the city at the end of last year to play at the Dubai Rugby Sevens in the colours of Ireland in the Women’s World Series tournament on Pitch 1."
