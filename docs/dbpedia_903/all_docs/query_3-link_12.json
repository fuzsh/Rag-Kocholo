Turkey, as a candidate country, needs to respect freedom of the media.”\n\nTurkey was declared eligible to join the EU in 1997 and started accession negotiations in 2005, but the ongoing dispute over Cyprus and other human rights issues have repeatedly delayed talks.\n\nBut the emergence of the refugee crisis and the rise of Isis amid the explosion of conflicts in Syria and Iraq has made Turkey a crucial partner to the EU as a frontline against terrorists and millions of displaced people.\n\nRefugee crisis - in pictures\n\nShow all 27\n\nAs an emergency summit on migration looms in Brussels on Monday, critics have accused European leaders of turning a blind eye to Turkey’s abuses as they attempt to stem the flow of asylum seekers and plough millions of pounds of funding into the country.\n\nDaniel Calingaert, executive vice president of the US-based watchdog, Freedom House, said: ”The European Union and the United States, as Turkey's partners and allies, should not trade Turkey's support on migration and Syria for silence over the dismantling of democratic institutions.”\n\nMartin Schulz, the European Parliament President, tweeted that Zaman’s takeover was “yet another blow to press freedom” and pledged to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu at the summit.\n\n\"If one disagrees about claims or reports of a newspaper, he should counter them with facts, not by gagging journalism,\" he added.\n\nNils Muižnieks, the European Commissioner for Human Rights, added to the condemnation with an official statement saying he “deplored” the seizure and pointing to a similar move against the Koza Ipek media group in October.\n\n“I see this as an extremely serious interference with media freedom which should have no place in a democratic society,” he wrote.\n\n“It is the latest in a string of unacceptable and undue restrictions of media freedom in Turkey, and it reinforces an extremely worrying pattern of judicial harassment against dissenting media and journalists in the country.”\n\nMr Muižnieks urged Turkish authorities to reverse its intervention and prevent any similar steps in the future, vowing to raise the issue during his visit to the country next month.\n\nThe US State Department also raised concern, with its spokesperson John Kirby, calling Zaman’s takeover “the latest in a series of troubling judicial and law enforcement actions taken by the Turkish government targeting media outlets and others critical of it”.\n\nHe added: “Court-ordered supervision of a media company’s finances and operations should not prompt changes to the newsroom or editorial policy.\n\n“As Turkey’s friend and NATO ally – and we do count ourself as a friend of Turkey (but) we urge Turkish authorities to ensure their actions uphold the universal democratic values enshrined in their own constitution, including freedom of speech and especially freedom of the press.”\n\nThe Turkish government accuses Zaman of supporting US-based cleric Fethullah Gülen, who was once an ally of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but is now held as a “terrorist” inciting a coup through his religious Gülen movement.\n\nThe newspaper, which has a daily readership of around 650,000, was taken over days after Turkey's Constitutional Court ordered the release of two Turkish journalists charged with revealing state secrets.\n\nCan Dundar and Erdem Gul, from the Cumhuriyet newspaper, were arrested in November over a report alleging that the Turkish government had tried to ship arms to Islamists in Syria.\n\nThe pair still face possible life sentences at their trial on 25 March.\n\nTwo newspapers and two television channels were also put under state administration over their alleged links with the Gülen, or Hizmet, movement last year.\n\nTurkey ranks 149th among the 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
