        "text": "Turkey's biggest newspaper, Zaman, has condemned its takeover by the authorities in a defiant last edition published just before police raided it.\n\nSaturday's edition said Turkey's press had experienced \"one of the darkest days in its history\".\n\nTurkish police raided Zaman's offices hours after a court ruling placed it under state control, but managers were still able to get the edition to print.\n\nZaman readers are protesting against the takeover outside the offices.\n\nhttp://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35735793\n\nWhere is that Turkish spy Bosmanoglu ?! :D Turkey is a democracy, we have an independent judiciary, bla bla.\n\nWhere are the Maryooley who were booytclapping heavy for AKP aka Islamic brotherhood ?\n\nErdogan is destroying Turkey.\n\nuyyXabad, the government did not took over the newspaper. A trust fund appointed by the court order took over. The trust fund will be appointing new editors and managers. Those of us who follow Turkey understand the reasons behind this.\n\nThere is a movement called Fathula Gullen Movement who were allied with AKP, but decided to set up a parallel government and infiltrated all government apparatus to overthrow without running elections. They had prosecutors, judges, army generals and others. Two years ago many of them have been arrested after their coup failed.\n\nHere is the news:\n\nEarlier on Friday, an Istanbul court had decided to appoint trustees for Zaman newspaper which is being accused of supporting a criminal organization led by U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gülen. The company is accused of supporting what is called the Gülenist Terror Organization (FETÖ), headed by Fetullah Gülen, who is said to have infiltrated Turkey's state apparatus with thousands of followers in an effort to overthrow the government.\n\nFETÖ is also known as the parallel state, which designates a clandestine group of Turkish bureaucrats and senior officials, allegedly embedded in the country's institutions, including the judiciary and the police.\n\nThey own this newspaper and others. No American newspaper or other respected western news organization will furnish the pictures of American clandestine intelligence movements. Some western journalist are even embedded with combat soldiers, but they are briefed not to divulge state secrets. The Gullen infiltrators inside the government feed these papers with illegal state secrets. There are many critical papers of Erdogan, but these Zaman group is different , they are treat to the Turkish state. It has nothing to do with freedom of the press. If a mafia group with criminal intensions tries to infiltrate government for it's own interest it will be stopped.\n\nFinally , it is not a take over by the state, but a continues effort of the Turkish state to stop a terrorist movement undermining the state. If you try to the over government without going through legal channels , you will be considers illegal.\n\nV\n\nTh\n\nTh\n\ngovernment did not took over the newspaper. A trust fund appointed by the court order took over. The trust fund will be appointing new editors and managers.\n\nDhuuso by any other name smells just as bad sxb, they are locking up this paper for good. Trust kulaha.\n\nParallel government ?! You really believe that, Galbeedi ? Your just following the government version uncritically\n\nThey are shutting down all critical media not just this one mind you. The Western governments are coming down heavy on them, Turkey is rapidly becoming rogue under erdogan. What a quick fall from grace, they were being praised for being model islamists and the economy was growing like china now everything is going south, pkk civil war is raging and the end might be breakup of Turkey.\n\nThey are not model Islamists. All they are asking is having the same freedom accorded to people of faith in Europe. They just want freedom of religion. I also notice that you did not know the over 123 generals arrested and convicted by a court for trying to overthrow the government. I do not think you are aware of these things.\n\nThe Turkish nation is facing very difficult issues. I know you may only noticed the Paris killing by ISIs, but over 300 people are killed by bombs in the heart of Istanbul and Ankara. They are hosting 3 million Syrians and they can not allow a parallel movement to undermine the state. Imagine the FBI or the CIA employee undamming Obama or the institutions they serve.\n\nHere in Canada if you incite hatred against an ethnic or religious group , your paper will be sued. Also , here in Canada, journalist can not report certain court proceedings ig the judge orders a gag order. Which means , they can listen and report the generalities of the case , but can not report specific issues.\n\nIf the issue is national security, they can not name the witnesses or ever divulge classified information. Zaman tramped all these rules and published Turkish military secrets. Believe me the western nations have strict rules in terms of national security.\n\nAgain what is good for the Turks is good for us. Erdogan can come and go but, we care about that nation.\n\nCanada, Somalia and Turkey . These are my issues."
