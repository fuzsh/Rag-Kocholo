        "text": "Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled her palace on Monday, as masses of protesters roamed the streets of Dhaka. In an address to the nation, Bangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said Hasina had resigned and he was forming an interim government. Later on Monday, Hasina landed at an air base in Ghaziabad, India.\n\nLocal television showed images of crowds running into the prime minister's residence in the capital and some looting. Waker-Uz-Zaman appealed to protesters to stop the violence and go home. He said said the army would not open fire.\n\nHasina's son had urged the country's security forces to block any takeover from her rule.\n\n\"She wanted to record a speech, but she could not get an opportunity to do that,\" a source close to Hasina told the AFP news agency.\n\nWhat caused the protests in Bangladesh?\n\nRallies that began last month against civil service job quotas escalated into some of the worst unrest of Hasina's 15-year rule and shifted into wider calls for the 76-year-old prime minister to leave. Around 300 people have been killed over the past month as police cracked down on the protests, with nearly 100 people killed Sunday.\n\nHasina has ruled Bangladesh since 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.\n\nHer government is accused by rights groups of misusing state institutions to entrench its hold on power and stamp out dissent, including through the extrajudicial killing of opposition activists.\n\nDemonstrations began over the reintroduction of a quota scheme that reserved more than half of all government jobs for certain groups.\n\nThe protests have escalated despite the scheme having been scaled back by Bangladesh's top court.\n\n\"Your duty is to keep our people safe and our country safe and to uphold the constitution,\" her son, US-based Sajeeb Wazed Joy, said in a post on Facebook.\n\n\"It means don't allow any unelected government to come in power for one minute, it is your duty.\"\n\nBut protesters on Monday defied security forces enforcing a curfew, marching on the capital's streets after the deadliest day of unrest since demonstrations erupted last month.\n\nInternet access was tightly restricted on Monday, offices were closed and more than 3,500 factories servicing Bangladesh's economically vital garment industry were shut.\n\nSoldiers and police with armored vehicles in Dhaka had barricaded routes to Hasina's office with barbed wire, AFP reporters said, but vast crowds flooded the streets, tearing down barriers.\n\nThe local Business Standard newspaper estimated as many as 400,000 protesters were on the streets.\n\n\"The time has come for the final protest,\" said Asif Mahmud, one of the key leaders in the nationwide civil disobedience campaign.\n\n\"An unprecedented popular uprising by all measures\"\n\nAt least 94 people were killed on Sunday, including 14 police officers.\n\nProtesters and government supporters countrywide battled each other with sticks and knives, and security forces opened fire.\n\nThe day's violence took the total number of people killed since protests began in early July to at least 300, according to an AFP tally based on police, government officials and doctors at hospitals.\n\n\"The shocking violence in Bangladesh must stop,\" United Nations rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented popular uprising by all measures,\" said Ali Riaz, an Illinois State University politics professor and expert on Bangladesh. \"Also, the ferocity of the state actors and regime loyalists is unmatched in history.\"\n\nVideos on social media verified by AFP showed protesters in Dhaka climbing a statue of Hasina's father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's independence leader, and smashing it with hammers Sunday.\n\nIn several cases, soldiers and police did not intervene to stem Sunday's protests, unlike during the past month of rallies that repeatedly ended in deadly crackdowns.\n\n\"Let's be clear: The walls are closing in on Hasina: She's rapidly losing support and legitimacy,\" Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Washington-based Wilson Center, told AFP.\n\n\"The protests have taken on immense momentum, fueled by raw anger but also by the confidence that comes with knowing that so much of the nation is behind them,\" he said.\n\nIn a hugely symbolic rebuke of Hasina, a respected former army chief demanded the government \"immediately\" withdraw troops and allow protests.\n\n\"Those who are responsible for pushing people of this country to a state of such an extreme misery will have to be brought to justice,\" ex-army chief General Ikbal Karim Bhuiyan told reporters Sunday.\n\nThe anti-government movement has attracted people from across society in the South Asian nation of about 170 million people, including film stars, musicians and singers.\n\nand contributed to this report."
