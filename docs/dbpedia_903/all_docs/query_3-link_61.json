        "text": "ISTANBUL – Backed by a court order, the Turkish authorities moved Friday to seize Zaman, the country’s most widely circulated newspaper, in the latest crackdown by the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on freedom of the press.\n\nThe seizure of the newspaper also highlighted the government’s building campaign against those it perceives to be its two greatest enemies: opposition journalists and the followers of Fethullah Gulen, a Muslim cleric affiliated with the newspaper who lives in exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen was once an ally of Erdogan’s but is now a bitter enemy.\n\nAs news of the takeover became public Friday afternoon, supporters began gathering in front of the newspaper’s offices in Istanbul, and employees locked a door to the building. In a live-stream broadcast on the newspaper’s website, supporters were seen chanting, “Free press cannot be silenced.” Some carried Turkish flags and banners emblazoned with, “Do not touch my newspaper.” Columnists from the paper were also seen addressing the crowd.\n\n“We are going through the darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press, which is a major benchmark for democracy and the rule of law,” read a statement issued by the editors of the English-language Today’s Zaman, a sister publication to Zaman. “Intellectuals, businesspeople, celebrities, civil society organizations, media organizations and journalists are being silenced via threats and blackmail.”\n\nThe move to seize Zaman and put it under the administration of a court-appointed panel of trustees underscored what critics say is a rapid deterioration of free-speech rights under the Islamist government of Erdogan, who was prime minister for more than a decade before being elected president in 2014. The crackdown on expression comes amid a growing sense that Turkey, once seen as a bastion of stability in a hostile region, is being enveloped by instability.\n\nA war with Kurdish separatists has turned cities in the southeast into rubble. The country is straining under the weight of more than 2 million refugees from Syria. And Islamic State militants, who have used Turkey to transit fighters and weapons to Syria and Iraq, have carried out deadly attacks on Turkish soil.\n\nAs Turkey faces its domestic demons, critics say the government has been emboldened to target its enemies within the country because the international community — especially the European Union and NATO allies — has looked the other way as it seeks Turkey’s support to contain the refugee crisis and pacify the raging civil war in Syria.\n\n“This pattern is appalling, and Turkey is galloping towards an authoritarian regime full speed ahead,” said Asli Aydintasbas, a prominent journalist who lost her column last year at the daily Milliyet under government pressure. “Unfortunately, the world, in particular the EU, remains silent. The government here can sense the vulnerability in the West, especially since the beginning of the refugee crisis, and is pushing the boundaries to consolidate its power.”\n\nAydintasbas added, “Erdogan knows the West is vulnerable because of ISIS and the refugees and he is going to use this as much as he can.”\n\nAlways thin-skinned, Erdogan has taken increasingly harsh steps in recent years to muzzle his critics. Dozens of journalists perceived as critical of the government have lost their jobs as officials have put pressure on their bosses. Academics have been targeted for speaking out against the government’s military campaign against Kurdish insurgents in the southeast.\n\nAt the same time, the justice system has charged Turks of all stripes — authors, journalists, cartoonists, politicians and ordinary citizens — with “insulting the president.” All told, more than 1,800 insult cases have been brought, the country’s justice minister revealed this week.\n\nIn some cases, such as with Zaman, and a broader crackdown on Gulen’s followers in business and in government — particularly the judiciary and the police, said to be stocked with allies of Gulen — the government has applied the country’s antiterrorism laws.\n\nWhen Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials AKP, rose to power in 2002, one of its important allies was Gulen, a moderate cleric whose followers in Turkey, over the years, penetrated institutions such as the police and judiciary and became prominent businessmen. The partnership coalesced over a series of trials against military officers on coup charges — later determined to be based on fabricated evidence — that ultimately removed the military’s influence over politics.\n\nBut in late 2013 the groups had a falling out over a number of issues, including the government’s handling of protests in summer 2013 and Turkey’s aggressive policy of supporting rebels in the Syrian civil war. Another point of friction was the growing hostility between Turkey and Israel, a country that the Gulenists were more sympathetic to than was Erdogan.\n\nMatters burst into public view at the end of 2013 over a corruption inquiry that targeted Erdogan and his inner circle, a challenge Erdogan survived by removing police officers and judges. Since then, the two sides have waged an all-out war in which Erdogan has had the upper hand.\n\nThe Gulen movement has been on the defensive, accused of being a terrorist organization that is plotting a coup. Its member have been subject to arrests, intimidation and court cases, while Erdogan has seemingly become more powerful. He has risen to the presidency, while his party, in national elections in November, secured another four years in power.\n\nRecently, there was one glimmer of hope for Turkey’s beleaguered journalists. Turkey’s highest court issued a ruling that freed from jail two newspaper editors who were being held on espionage charges. The editors, Can Dundar and Erdem Gul, of the daily Cumhuriyet, are being prosecuted for reporting on alleged weapons transfers by Turkish intelligence agents to rebels in Syria. The case is proceeding, but the editors were released from jail after the court determined that their constitutional rights had been violated.\n\nDundar, in a text message, said Friday of the Zaman case: “It is the sign that fear has entirely grown in the halls of state. They do not have tolerance for even the tiniest criticism. But it is impossible to silence an entire society by disregarding the law. Turkey would not keep quiet.”\n\nErdogan responded to that court ruling by saying he did not respect it, and throughout the crackdown on Gulen-affiliated media — which did not begin with Friday’s seizure of Zaman, but has been continuing — government officials have framed it not as an assault on freedom of the press but as a determined effort to destroy a group it sees as an enemy of the Turkish state.\n\nSpeaking on local television Friday, Mehmet Metiner, a lawmaker with Erdogan’s party, said, “We will go on fighting against the Fethullah terror organization, and their extensions in the media and business world within the range of the law.”"
