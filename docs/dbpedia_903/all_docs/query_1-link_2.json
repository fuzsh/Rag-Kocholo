        "text": "A Turkish court has put Zaman newspaper - a vocal critic of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - under state control.\n\nAdministrators have been appointed to run the newspaper. There is no explanation for the court's decision.\n\nZaman is closely linked to the Hizmet movement of influential US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, a former Erdogan ally.\n\nTurkey describes Hizmet as a \"terrorist organisation\" aiming to overthrow the government. Many of its supporters have been arrested.\n\nMr Erdogan's government has come under increasing international criticism over its treatment of journalists.\n\nIn a statement, Zaman said, external the country was going through its \"darkest and gloomiest days in terms of freedom of the press\".\n\nIt expressed \"deep concern\" at the latest court order - the culmination of pressure for more than two years on Turkey's \"highest circulating newspaper, Zaman, and its sister publication Today's Zaman\". It said the pressure had been through \"accreditation bans, tax inspections, meddling with its advertisers and threats to its readers\".\n\nEditor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme told Reuters news agency this was \"the practical end of media freedom in Turkey\".\n\n\"The media has always been under pressure, but it has never been so blatant,\" she said.\n\nThe pair still face possible life sentences at their trial on 25 March.\n\nTwo newspapers and two television channels were put under state administration last year over their alleged links with the Hizmet movement.\n\nThe Turkish government has accused Mr Gulen, Hizmet's spiritual leader, of trying to run a parallel state.\n\nOn Friday, state-run Anadolu news agency said police had detained four senior officials of a company linked to Mr Gulen in the central city of Kayseri.\n\nTurkey has asked the US to extradite Mr Gulen. The exiled cleric has allies in the Turkish police and judiciary, media and financial interests as well as a network of schools."
