        "text": "Today’s Zaman editor-in-chief Sevgi Akarcesme has been speaking, tweeting and writing tirelessly since her newspaper was seized by Turkish authorities (along with its sister paper Zaman and the Cihan news agency) over the weekend. POLITICO spoke to her briefly Tuesday evening to get an update on the mood in the paper’s Istanbul newsroom:\n\nEuropean Union leaders didn’t seem to push press freedom very aggressively with Turkey at the migration summit Monday. What did you make of the talks in Brussels?\n\nThey are scared of pissing off [President Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan because of their fear of an influx of refugees. Their priority is now not democracy and freedom of expression in Turkey, but their own well-being. In a rational world, we cannot blame them, but in a world of ideas and values, I think [the] European Union does not live up to its philosophy. They are unfortunately violating their own values. Any time they talk about values from now on, they are going to have a serious credibility problem. From my perspective it’s a huge disappointment that [the EU] turns a blind eye to the severe suspension of the constitution at home.\n\nShould Europe be accelerating membership talks with Turkey?\n\nI don’t buy the argument that Turkeys’ ascension to the EU is any closer. Everybody knows Turkey has never been this far away from membership, with a poor record of human rights at home. In Turkey, the government has to save face, by saying we are getting closer to the European Union. Both parties pretend otherwise, but deep inside everybody knows that neither the visa requirements will be removed for Turks, nor Turkey will enter the European Union any time soon. All Europe cares about is one way or another stopping the refugees to Europe.\n\nYou’ve been critical of other Turkish media for not covering the Zaman seizure.\n\nThere is such a huge amount of fear. There is not even much media, except for minor newspapers, to cover this incident because over a decade Erdoğan has been swallowing all the critical media outlets by creating his own media empire, directly or indirectly. I call Erdoğan the biggest media owner in Turkey.\n\nWhat happens next for you and the other journalists at Zaman and Today’s Zaman?\n\nIt’s a very, very tough question. There is a great deal of uncertainty. In the newsroom my colleagues are working under police surveillance. In the garden, in the corridors, around the newspapers, there is a heavy police presence. Even today, the police told one of the reporters that they cannot use the cafeteria during working hours just because she did not want to listen to propaganda. Even the police has been intervening in the behavior of the journalists.\n\nI don’t know why they didn’t fire me. I had previously applied for leave because of a business trip abroad for March 5. So I am officially on leave for about a week. The day before I left, the seizure took place, the police raid took place. I went to the newspaper for the next two days, but when I saw the new trustees, the new administration has been interfering with the editorial policies, I just thought that I couldn’t stand it. I told my managing editors to deal with the extremely ignorant and rude group of trustees who have been censoring the newspaper.\n\nWill you go back?\n\nI don’t want to give them the pleasure of resigning. I’m delaying my resignation. I expect them to fire me in the next couple of days. If they don’t, I’ve already said on Twitter that I don’t respect and recognize the trustees. I don’t think they are legitimate.\n\nAt this point, do you see any hope in Turkey for independent, opposition voices?\n\nThere is little hope in the short or middle run. There is no independent media left. There’s a huge amount of fear in society, among intellectuals, among businesspeople, among civil society. Democracy is suspended effectively in Turkey at the moment.\n\n(This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity and length.)"
