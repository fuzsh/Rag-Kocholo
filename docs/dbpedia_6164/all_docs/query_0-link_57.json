        "text": "While there are no formal requirements for admission to the PRM program, students must earn a 2.5 GPA in order to graduate with the PRM degree. As a major in the PRM program, students will work with a PRM faculty advisor to outline courses, certifications, and professional development options to help them achieve their academic and career goals.\n\nPRM & COAPRT Student Learning Objectives\n\n7.01 Students graduating from the program shall demonstrate the following entry-level knowledge: a) the nature and scope of the relevant park, recreation, tourism or related professions and their associated industries; b) techniques and processes used by professionals and workers in these industries; and c) the foundation of the profession in history, science and philosophy.\n\n7.02 Students graduating from the program shall be able to demonstrate the ability to design, implement, and evaluate services that facilitate targeted human experiences and that embrace personal and cultural dimensions of diversity.\n\n7.03 Students graduating from the program shall be able to demonstrate entry-level knowledge about operations and strategic management/administration in parks, recreation, tourism and/or related professions.\n\n7.04 Students graduating from the program shall demonstrate, through a comprehensive internship of not less than 400 clock hours and no fewer than 10 weeks, the potential to succeed as professionals at supervisory or higher levels in park, recreation, tourism, or related organizations.\n\nThe B.S. in Parks and Recreation Management (PRM) gives students the broad knowledge that parks and recreation professionals need wherever they choose to work in the profession. This includes employment in outdoor leadership, city and county recreation, military recreation, resorts, tourist attractions, camps, leisure services, or the land agencies (Parks, Forest Service, Army Corps, etc.) among many others. Students will also focus their course work on an area that fits the field of specialization of most interest to them, Community Recreation, Outdoor Leadership and Instruction, Commercial and Resort Recreation, or Recreation Resource Management (for the Parks, Forest Service, Army Corps etc.).\n\nPRM Curriculum Overview:\n\nDownload the Eight Semester Plan for B.S. in Parks and Recreation Management\n\nAs a PRM major, you will earn certifications, complete meaningful projects, present research, obtain experiences, and participate in conferences. It is important to save and document each of these items to be used as you begin your career search. In PRM 370: Professional Planning in PRM, students will begin the process of developing their professional portfolio utilizing the online platform, Linked In. The final opportunity to update the portfolio and Linked In profile will be in PRM 483/484 Capstone Internship.\n\nThe portfolio may contain the following items depending upon your focus area in PRM:\n\nResume (professional)\n\nOutdoor Resume (skills, expeditions, experiences)\n\nProgram proposal\n\nTrip planning documents\n\nResearch prospectus\n\nBusiness plan\n\nRisk management plan and/or analysis\n\nLeadership self-analysis\n\nActivity Log/Journal\n\nLesson plan or activity proposal\n\nTent Peg article\n\nNewspaper articles, blog posts, press releases\n\nService learning or volunteer work\n\nPhotographs of interpretive work or programs\n\nCertifications related to your career path\n\nAwards\n\nThe minor in Parks and Recreation Management requires 18 hours consisting of two core courses and any 12 hours of electives approved by your PRM advisor. The two core courses are PRM 250 and PRM 270. Please contanct Dr. Callie Schultz at csschultz@wcu.edu for more information.\n\nThe field of parks and recreation offers graduates a wide range of career options in community recreation, outdoor leadership and instruction, commercial and resort recreation, and recreation resource management.\n\nLearn More About Career Options\n\nWe encourage you to gain experience in your chosen area through coursework, internships, and summer employment. Youâ€™ll gain leadership and participatory experience through volunteer work at Base Camp Cullowhee, where a range of activities are planned for the on- and off-campus community.\n\nExcellent internship opportunities, including the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Navitat, Nantahala Outdoor Center, Project SOAR, and several camps, surround the WCU campus. The strongest industry in the region is tourism, so our students enjoy internships at attractions and resorts in Western North Carolina and in the coastal areas of both North and South Carolina at places like Wilmington, Hilton Head Island, Myrtle Beach, and Charleston. Community parks and recreation agencies also abound in the region.\n\nPRM Program Diversity Statement\n\nDiversity involves the affirmation, understanding, and professional application of the richness of human differences, ideas, practices, and beliefs that result from, but are not limited to, age, race, color, disability/health, ethnicity, gender identity, language, national origin, religion/spirituality, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, rural or urban status, as well as the intersectionality of these multiple identities. Professional practice that is responsive to diversity includes culturally appropriate communication skills; understanding power differentials and dynamics; and attending to the social and cultural values which influence the multiple areas of practice represented in PRM.\n\nPRM Program Commitment to Social Justice\n\nA commitment to social justice serves as a guiding principle of the PRM Program and reflects our belief in the values and goals of a socially just society. Socially just societies are dependent upon the optimal functioning, health, and well-being of all persons in that society. Optimal functioning, health, and well-being of persons are contingent upon access to healthy environments that support healthy development and functioning. Our program is centered on a social justice approach by helping students to examine power structures resulting in social injustices and to adopt an advocacy role in working with marginalized and underserved populations. Our goal is to foster the development of professional advocates who work to change societal structures, practices, values, and policies which have long served to perpetuate unhealthy environments for these populations. By working to effect change at the individual, institutional and systemic level, our students assist in promoting greater access to economic, social, political, and cultural resources.\n\nPRM Partnership with the Social Justice Minor\n\nPRM 275: Diversity & Inclusion is a core course in the PRM program and the Social Justice Minor. For more information about the minor, visit sj.wcu.edu.\n\nYou may be able to study abroad for around the same cost as studying at Western. We have a special agreement with the Atlantic Technological University in Ireland and have had international exchanges for a few years now. Studying in Ireland would require a year commitment and is best done early. Study abroad is a great experience! Ask for further details.\n\nThe PRM Club is part of SGA at WCU and receives funding to help with club expenses. Being a member of the club enables you to get to know other PRM students who, besides helping you to make friends on campus, broaden your network of professional contacts for when you have graduated.\n\nRead more about the PRM Club."
