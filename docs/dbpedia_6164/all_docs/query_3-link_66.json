Experiences range from sports to special events to travel experiences to park visits to afterschool programs to family experiences and beyond!\n\nThey also work in a variety of settings including public recreation departments, parks, sport facilities, community centers, retirement villages, camps, event venues, and tourism attractions.\n\nStudents in this major put theory into practice by completing two internships. There are also opportunities to attend conferences, participate in clubs, and travel through study abroad. These experiences help students develop a professional network that they can call on beyond graduation.\n\nFaculty in Recreation Management have won awards for teaching, research, and service.
