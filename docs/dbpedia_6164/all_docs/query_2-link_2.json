        "text": "What is Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management?\n\nIn today’s fast-paced society, recreation and leisure are more important than ever to our physical and mental well-being. Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management (PRTM) students learn to create and facilitate sustainable and affordable experiences in local and global communities by utilizing best business practices in programming, marketing and budgeting. Our students graduate prepared to make a difference in people’s lives by creating quality recreation and nature-based programs, education and events that provide leisure, enhance community and address societal concerns—such as physical health, juvenile delinquency and economic sustainability.\n\nOur students gain real-world experience through hands-on classes and internships. Students benefit from partnerships with local and state agencies, nonprofits and a network of parks in the greater Raleigh area. Our college is home to the NC State Tourism Extension Office, which is committed to boosting economic and community development efforts in rural North Carolina. Our students have the opportunity to gain professional and leadership experience by assisting this office with projects in the areas of agri-tourism and micro-entrepreneurship.\n\nOur Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management program is accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Parks, Recreation, Tourism and Related Professions (COAPRT).\n\nConcentrations\n\nRecreation and Park Management focuses on environmental education, outdoor recreation, parks planning and management and conservation of parks and other natural resource areas.\n\nTourism and Event Management focuses on recreation facility management techniques, fiscal management, facility and site planning, and recreation programming and administration.\n\nParks, Recreation and Tourism Management Curriculum\n\nSemester by Semester Plan for Recreation and Park Management\n\nSemester by Semester Plan for Tourism and Event Management\n\nPopular minors include Business Administration, Environmental Education, Journalism, Nonprofit Studies and Psychology.\n\nWhy are Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management graduates important?\n\nOur Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management graduates help plan, organize and lead sports tournaments and special events, such as arts, music and holiday festivals, which generate not only direct revenue from fees and charges, but also significant indirect revenues to local and regional economies through hospitality, retail and transportation.\n\nTourism is one of the world’s fastest growing industries and is a major source of income for many countries and local communities. Our alumni play a critical role in supporting a thriving economy and the more than 1.1 billion people who travel globally each year.\n\nOur graduates help create, improve and promote places for youth and adults to be physically active, which results in an increase in residents who exercise at least three times per week and provides positive lifestyle choices to youth.\n\nWhat can you do with a Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management degree?\n\nThe Parks, Recreation and Tourism industries are growing. Employment of people working in recreation professions is projected to grow 10 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all occupations, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Outdoor recreation alone contributes 6.1 million jobs and $645 billion to the U.S. economy annually. That means our students graduate with options.\n\nSample Parks, Recreation and Tourism Management Careers"
