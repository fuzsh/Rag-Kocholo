Faculty and students can often be found conducting field work at parks, protected areas and other cultural and natural sites across the state while wearing their distinct orange attire.\n\nThe university’s Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management (PRTM) students learn how to manage recreational activities and sites, take an active role in protecting the environment through education and policy, and perform research studies to understand the effects of tourism and outdoor recreation to the local, regional and national economy.\n\nThe PRTM Department maintains an engaging presence with South Carolina’s outdoor industry. The program offers classroom and online coursework for undergraduate, graduate (thesis and non-thesis) and doctoral degrees. PRTM concentrations include: community recreation, sport management, and camp management; non-profit leadership; park and conservation area management; recreational therapy; travel and tourism; and youth development."
