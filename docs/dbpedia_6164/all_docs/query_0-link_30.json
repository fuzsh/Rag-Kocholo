        "text": "LogicTools, a leading provider of supply chain planning solutions, and PRTM, a leading management consultancy, are collaborating on next generation supply chains through Strategic Network Optimization.\n\nPRTM is known for its benchmarking and management consulting leadership in supply chain strategic practices, including its development of the Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model (SCOR) which has been adopted by the Supply-Chain Council. SCOR practices provide a reliable starting point for most companies to evaluate the performance of their supply chain and accelerate process innovation and adoption.\n\nLogicTools' integrated suite of planning solutions includes LogicNet Plus® for network design, Inventory Analyst™ for inventory optimization and LogicChain® for production sourcing. LogicTools' integrated planning suite provides solutions that optimize the supply chain by considering the entire network, taking into account production, warehousing, transportation and inventory costs, and service level requirements.\n\nStrategic Network Optimization, as defined by PRTM, focuses on a holistic network reconfiguration technique that enables companies to achieve supply chain excellence. This includes end-to-end supply chain, distribution, and product flow optimization. Supply chain optimization will lower production, outbound and inbound distribution costs, while distribution optimization enables higher customer responsiveness. Optimized product flow in the network will lower inventory and increase turns; optimized asset utilization will lower fixed cost.\n\nPRTM has leveraged LogicTools' suite for Strategic Network Optimization through inventory optimization and network design. Mike Romeri, Lead Director, Process Technology Group at PRTM said, \"We recently deployed LogicTools' inventory and network optimization solutions at a large U.S. manufacturing company as an important part of a next generation supply chain. The level of support and expertise provided by LogicTools consultants was extraordinary and the project has shown huge benefits for our clients. We see the integration of network optimization with our methodology as critical for companies to achieve best in class performance and expect to collaborate with LogicTools extensively to leverage this opportunity.\"\n\nAbout LogicTools\n\nLogicTools (www.logic-tools.com) a leading provider of supply chain planning solutions was founded in 1995 by David Simchi-Levi, Professor of engineering systems at MIT.
