        "text": "Belonging to the subtilase family, the cell surface proteinase (CSP) PrtB of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus differs from other CSPs synthesized by lactic acid bacteria. Expression of the prtB gene under its own promoter was shown to complement the proteinase-deficient strain MG1363 (PrtP− PrtM−) of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. Surprisingly, the maturation process of PrtB, unlike that of lactococcal CSP PrtPs, does not require a specific PrtM-like chaperone. The carboxy end of PrtB was previously shown to be different from the consensus anchoring region of other CSPs and exhibits an imperfect duplication of 59 amino acids with a high lysine content. By using a deletion strategy, the removal of the last 99 amino acids, including the degenerated anchoring signal (LPKKT), was found to be sufficient to release a part of the truncated PrtB into the culture medium and led to an increase in PrtB activity. This truncated PrtB is still active and enables L. lactis MG1363 t...\n\nThe transcription initiation signals of the prtP and prtM genes specifying the proteolytic activity of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Wg2 were mapped by primer extension. The strength of these promoters was analyzed with promoter-screening vector pGKV410, and they appeared to be weaker than previously isolated promoters of strain Wg2. In addition, a putative transcription terminator downstream of the prtP gene was characterized by using the terminator-screening vector pGKV259. The putative terminator decreased the transcription activity of lactococcal promoter P59 by approximately 70% in both Bacillus subtilis and L. lactis. Deletion of a part of the stem-loop structure of the terminator decreased the negative effect on transcription, indicating that the structure could indeed function as a terminator of transcription. The proteolytic activity of the lactococcal host was enhanced by placing the originally oppositely oriented prt genes in tandem and replacing the relatively weak ..."
