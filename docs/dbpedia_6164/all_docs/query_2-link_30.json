        "text": "Profile:\n\nMatthew is an environmental social scientist with a PhD from North Carolina State University. He is joining the Michigan Chapter of The Nature Conservancy and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research as the Bailey Conservation Fellow after working on the Resilient Central America project with TNC in Mexico City. He will be working with Drs. Brad Cardinale of CIGLR and Patrick Doran and Chris May of TNC to evaluate stakeholder perceptions of nature-based solutions for coastal management on the Great Lakes, primarily in Michigan along the coast of Lake Erie.\n\nPrior to TNC, he completed a Fulbright-Garcia Robles U.S. Scholar grant at the Institute of Social Investigation at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico where his research focused on collective action within community forestry enterprises. At NC State, his dissertation focused on building resilience in rural coastal communities to sea level rise, flooding, and saltwater intrusion impacts and identifying the unique barriers to adaptation in minority populations. Broadly, his research uses a climate justice lens to build adaptive capacity to climate change impacts in the US and Mexico through community engagement and participatory methods that include resource managers, stakeholders, and agricultural producers. Outside of the office, Matthew likes practicing judo, traditional rock climbing, and salsa dancing.\n\nEducation:\n\nPh.D., Parks, Recreation, and Tourism Management, North Carolina State University, 2018\n\nM.S., Conservation Leadership, Colorado State University and El Colegio de La Frontera Sur, 2014\n\nB.A., Ecology and Biodiversity, University of Denver, 2007\n\nResearch Interest/Area of Expertise:\n\nEnvironmental Social Science and Community Resilience\n\nHuman Dimensions of Natural Resources\n\nClimate Justice\n\nClimate Change Impacts\n\nRecent Publications:\n\nJurjonas, M., E.
