The firm's business centers on the areas of operational strategy, supply chain innovation, product innovation, and customer experience innovation.[1]\n\nPRTM works in these industry sectors: automotive, aerospace and defense, chemicals and process industries, telecommunications, consumer goods and retail, electronics, energy, financial services, healthcare, private equity, public sector, semiconductor, and software.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe firm was founded in 1976 in Palo Alto, California.[1] When the firm added eastern United States operations in 1977, it was incorporated as Pittiglio, Rabin, Todd & McGrath after its founding partners Theodore Pittiglio, Robert Rabin, Robert Todd, and Michael McGrath. Today, the firm is known as PRTM. On June 24, 2011, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) acquired PRTM and the deal closed on August 22, 2011.[2]\n\nThe firm began benchmarking business performance for its clients in 1982. PRTM's international expansion started in 1985. In 1988, PRTM created the \"Product and Cycle-time Excellence\" (PACE) framework to provide companies with a multidisciplinary approach to innovation. PRTM co-developed the \"Supply-Chain Operations Reference-model\" (SCOR) with the Supply-Chain Council in 1996. In 1997, the firm launched a subsidiary, The Performance Measurement Group, LLC (PMG).[3]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nMaking Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit From It (by Tony Davila, Marc J.
