        "text": "<p>In the current US News b-school ranking, at the MBA level, it is ranked 20. But when people talk about MBA schools in California, it’s almost always just Anderson and Haas. Marshall isn’t even in the picture. It is ranked in the top 20 and ahead of Goizueta, but it seems like it doesn’t get much respect. I also took a look at the recruiting companies compared to similarly ranked schools, and it seems like some of the companies leave out Marshall in its recruiting efforts. Why is that?</p>\n\n<p>In California it goes</p>\n\n<p>1) Stanford GSB (top 2 program)\n\n2) Berkeley Haas (top 10 program)\n\n3) UCLA Anderson (top 15 program)\n\n4) USC-Marshall (top 20 program)</p>\n\n<p>…and then it’s a big drop-off to number five.</p>\n\n<p>Marshall holds its own, with an average comp of 113.5k, acceptance rate of 23%, and median GMAT of 700. [USC</a> Marshall Class Profiles](<a href=“http://www.marshall.usc.edu/mbaadmissions/class-profiles-overview.htm]USC”>http://www.marshall.usc.edu/mbaadmissions/class-profiles-overview.htm) But those numbers are still slightly lower than Stanford, Haas, or Anderson. The top hiring list looks pretty solid, so not sure which companies you are referring to:</p>\n\n<p>\n\n</p>\n\n<p>I’m just guessing here, but I suppose it’s possible that while there were a few hires from the firms you mentioned, there were not enough to make the list of “top hiring firms,” (assuming the list is based on # of students hired, and there is some cutoff like 4 offers or something)</p>\n\n<p>But UCLA Anderson is generally better than USC Marshall, save for a few concentrations like real-estate development, accounting, probably a few more. So I’m not too surprised. Like I mentioned earlier, Anderson is top-15, Marshall is top-20. Sometimes that makes a difference for elite firms.</p>\n\n<p>For what it’s worth, as a Marshall undergrad I’ve has exposure to most of the firms you mentioned. Speakers from McKinsey and Blackrock. A close friend is working for JP Morgan in Japan as an analyst. I looked through my e-mail inbox and found a job posting for Blackrock. See pg 7 of <a href=“http://www.marshall.usc.edu/assets/054/10791.pdf[/url]”>http://www.marshall.usc.edu/assets/054/10791.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n<p>So basically while they might not hire enough students to make the “top hiring companies” list, they do have a presence.</p>\n\n<p>there’s also gradations of value within a company - not all positions at a firm are created equal. the list of employers by itself doesn’t say much.</p>\n\n<p>For example, on that list you have Deloitte Consulting - Human Capital. Deloitte Consulting happens to have 4 (really 5) branches of consulting, and HC isn’t nearly as challenging, prestigious or profitable as Strategy & Operations. </p>\n\n<p>The positions at listed financial firms - how many are front office, M&A or Capital Markets at ibanks, investor positions at money management firms, vs middle office or operational?</p>\n\n<p>Those kind of considerations will show a lot of difference between the various schools.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously Harvard/Stanford/Wharton have national reach, but graduates of other MBA programs most often stay put after they graduate, and in this sense USC would be at no disadvantage because of its strong ties in California. One can argue that it is not more “regional” than any of the following programs:</p>\n\n<p>Berkeley Haas:\n\nWithin North America, graduates who accepted full-time jobs in the following regions:\n\nNortheast: 4 %\n\nMid-Atlantic: 3 %\n\nSouth: 3 %\n\nSouthwest: 1 %\n\nMidwest: 3 %\n\nWest: 87 %\n\nSource: [University</a> of California-Berkeley: Full-Time MBA Profile ?
