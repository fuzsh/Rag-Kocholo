        "text": "Students, alumni, faculty, friends and community partners gathered at Aloft Raleigh to celebrate outstanding achievements on a lovely spring evening in Raleigh, NC. Located on Hillsborough Street across from The Memorial Belltower, the venue was a marked departure for end-of-year events.\n\n“Times change and traditions do not,” said department head, Rasul Mowatt. “It is incumbent on us to conceive of gatherings that honor the work of others, low-cost gatherings that shift monies that would have gone to event expenses to scholarships, and gatherings that are realistic to the needs (and time) of working students, some of whom are first generation and low-income.”\n\n“For our faculty and staff, such a gathering allows for a brief reprieve from areas and types of work that are constant, especially at the end of the Spring semester. And for our guests, such a gathering grants us all the ability to have true and meaningful conversations between us. So, since times change, why not create new traditions? This will be the purpose of the PRTM Spring Social.”\n\nLocated directly across from campus, the Aloft Raleigh provided the perfect balcony for taking selfies and family photos.\n\nOutstanding Undergraduate Student Awards\n\nEach year students are nominated and chosen by faculty and staff based on their class contributions, leadership abilities, extra curricular activities, and general involvement in the department. This year’s outstanding undergraduate award winners are:\n\nDe’Shawn Thomas – Hines Outstanding Senior Sport Management\n\nEdy Kaleta – Candace Vick Outstanding Senior PRTM Student\n\nAaron Paulus – Outstanding PRTM Student\n\nChloe Negrete – Outstanding Sport Management Student\n\nTommy Rogalski – Outstanding PGM Student\n\nScholarship Winners for 2023-2024\n\nThe following department wide scholarships were awarded:\n\nSite Solutions Scholarship: Brandon Mise\n\nLegends in Giving Scholarship: Riley Pittman, Weston Wright, Will Glover\n\nPhillip S.

During the pandemic of 2020, Scott Payne won the award for Outstanding Alumni and Sally Webb Berry for Lifetime Achievement. This year, both recipients were able to attend in person. Davin “Dave” Olsen, who passed away in 2022, was awarded posthumously.\n\nPayne earned his BS and MS degrees from NC State’s department of parks, recreation and tourism management. Payne most recently served as assistant director for the City of Raleigh parks, recreation and cultural resources department. He began his career of service to the profession here at NC State holding positions of recreation consultant, extension associate and director of Recreation Resource Services (RRS). Today, Payne is the Director of the Parks and Recreation Maintenance Management School, a partnership with PRTM, NRPA and the National Training Center at Oglebay, having been a part of the professional development program since 1995. He is both an alum and employee of the department serving as an extension assistant for RRS serving the Northeast Region of North Carolina.\n\nSally Webb Berry is the CEO of The Special Event Company based in Apex, NC. She founded the company in 1987 using her background in sports PR and marketing as one of the first dedicated event management companies in the UK. She and her company have produced events in over 25 countries throughout Europe, USA, Africa, South America and Asia. She is also a founding board member of Teen Cancer America with Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend and serves on the advisory board of The SEARCH Foundation.\n\n“Despite leading one of the best event management companies in the world and recognized globally as one of the world’s leading event producers, Sally is extremely generous with her time,” said Jason Bocarro, Owens-Shelton Distinguished Professor of Leadership with a Global Perspective. “Be it mentoring young professionals, designing innovative educational programs for the next generation of event planners, or dedicating her efforts to raise money for Teen Cancer America.”\n\n“Dave Olsen had a profound impact on our program,” said Kyle Bunds, Associate Professor in Sport and Sustainable Community Development. “He mentored our faculty and students with enthusiasm and always over-delivered. Dave would meet you for coffee, lunch or dinner and even participate during event chats about whatever our students needed to learn about sport management and facility management.”"
