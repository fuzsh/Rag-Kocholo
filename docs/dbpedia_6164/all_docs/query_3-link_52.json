        "text": "we arent getting rid of it anytime soon. Clemson PRTM is top 5 every year and has been innovative the last two years. I was in the Immersion Semester, now called EDGE Program. It was studied by UGA, Tex AM, and Ill, fellow top 5 PRTM programs. Clemson is still changing the program around bc it is so new and there is no blue print, seeing as how we are the first school to ever try this type of program. Your friend may have been referring to name changes or program changes, but Clemson wont get rid of the PRTM program.\n\nPRTM Graduate.\n\nI don't work for a driving range\n\nI make decent money\n\nI love coming to work every day\n\nI try to make a difference for my community\n\nClemson's PRTM program is one of the best...if not THE BEST...in the Country\n\nAnd it is true that you can party right through may....Its also true that come May you will be packing your bags and headed home because your ### flunked out (like my roommate and fellow PRTM student found out)\n\nI transferred into PRTM bc I love sports and its a great major. I can tell you that when i show up for work at internships and summer jobs in the rec field, it doesnt even feel like working. I also came into Clemson with a 1390 on my SATs. Safe to say we arent all dumb. I dont a lot of people in the \"smart\" majors that cant think for themselves. They have no creativity or improvisation skills when it comes to their jobs. They can only repeat what they memorize from a page.\n\nto be a sarcastic a-hole...I have to stick with what I'm good at\n\nWhen I was at Clemson, we constantly had a fight with PRTM to see which major could get the most athletes in it. My wife was an architecture major and she'd get so mad after spending 10 hours in her lab that I was already drunk by 2pm.\n\nsorry sorry sorry. i quite testy after all of this. a lot of people hate on prtm without knowing what it truely entails. this major has evolved so much over the last couple of yrs and has become much more difficult. thats why clemson is on the cutting edge with this program now. believe it or not, sociology, psychology, and business have more athletes than prtm does. we still have our share though, and its not like theyre making all As either haha, trust me, i have to pick up their slack in group work.\n\nin this economy though, a lot of us will take what we can get in any field. PRTM is a little different. we go into our specific field bc we love what we do. Its not like we show up just to get a degree in anything. Its hard to explain. You have to sit in on a class in PRTM to understand the culture. I can tell you from experience that there is a huge difference in being in an Engr class and a PRTM class. Engr is tougher than PRTM no doubt, but there are some in Engr that couldnt do PRTM, and vice verse for sure. The numbers i gave you are from studies done recently at Clemson. Obviously theyre not 100% accurate. BUt those are the best I can give you. I agree that theyve got to be off some bc not all of us go into the field\n\nAnn Amiri is chief operating officer of the Red Cross in Charleston, SC. Previously, she was chief financial officer and managing director of\n\nThe Foenix Group LLC., a management consulting firm, She also was CFO and vice president of finance and administration for Port Security International LLC.\n\nDunham is a health and safety specialist. Previously, she was a volunteer Red Cross instructor for the past three years. She has a bachelor's degree in parks, recreation and tourism management from Clemson University.\n\nRyan M Kerrigan\n\nExecutive Director\n\nryan@peak7.org\n\n•B.S.

With scheduling you have to take into account the distance teams are traveling, how to make them stay as long as possible so theyll spend more money in the local economy, ins and outs of public and private non profit orgs, for profit orgs, etc. Theres always more than meets the eye with any major when you dont study it\n\nIts not as easy as it sounds. Im good at it but Im pretty smart so catch onto most anything pretty quick. I thought Civil Engr was easy but I can certainly understand why some find it difficult. I know several people in PRTM that had higher SAT scores than some friends of mine in ENGR and they tend to struggle. It takes a different kind of person to be good at PRTM. You have to be a people person. We had an event Sat, Strut Your Mutt, that the weather screwed with big time. Several vendors canceled so we had to think quickly on feet to figure out things to do. We'd been planning this for 2 months and then we had to change so much in 2 hrs. I can assure you that not everyone couldve dealt with the customers and managed the people and everything else you have to do sometimes. I wont say that PRTM is tougher than ENGR cause its not, but its a major that requires several skills you cant teach. But its a major that is absolutely necessary and it bugs me to think that people believe we dont matter.\n\nI don't doubt that job you describe takes skill and can be difficult. My point is that I have a hard time believing that you need a 4 year degree to be taught those skills...if they can even be taught.\n\nYou mention that you need to be a people person and be quick to react and change. Is that something you learned as a PRTM major?\n\nHeck you seem to even be saying something similar yourself:\n\nI wont say that PRTM is tougher than ENGR cause its not, but its a major that requires several skills you cant teach."
