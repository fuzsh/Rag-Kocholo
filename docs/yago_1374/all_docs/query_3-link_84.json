        "text": "Accordion shop used by rock and pop bands to close\n\nA shop in south-east London that has been selling and repairing accordions for almost half a century will close later this year.\n\nEmilio Allodi runs Allodi Accordions Ltd on Lee High Road, Lewisham - an internationally recognised and in-demand restorer of these instruments.\n\nThe family name has also appeared on accordions played by band members of Status Quo, Sir Paul McCartney and Sheryl Crow.\n\nEmilio said that the intricate work to repair accordions had \"taken a toll on his fingers\" and he wanted to spend more time with his wife, Kim and their grandchildren.\n\n\"We were immersed in the accordion world completely,\" said Emilio as he remembered living above the first Allodi Accordions shop in north London.\n\n\"My Dad would be downstairs working and repairing and he would say, 'Oh, Emilio, come down and just hold this while I’m doing this - can you see what this is doing there?'\n\n\"Without realising, you’re a young kid, doing as you’re told - but learning at the same time.\"\n\nEmilio's father, Bruno, and uncle, Umberto, grew up playing the accordion near Parma, Italy.\n\nUmberto went on to become a top professional musician and Bruno came to London in 1951 and learned the craft of accordion restoration.\n\nEmilio continued the family name when he started his own business in Lewisham, which has been on the Lee High Road for 46 years.\n\nThere are about 1,000 accordions in the world embossed with the name Allodi on their case.\n\nSome of those were bought by musicians who have played in the bands of Sheryl Crow, The Pogues, Status Quo and Sir Paul McCartney.\n\n\"They had to play at the White House when it was Michelle Obama's birthday. So they were going to play [the song] Michelle from the Beatles and there it was,\" Emilio said.\n\n\"People were phoning me up and saying, 'Do you know your name’s splattered across the screen?'\n\n\"Because they kept focusing on the accordion with Allodi written right across - next to Obama. And I thought, wow.\"\n\nEmilio said he has received emails from customers all around the world who have heard he is shutting the shop.\n\nThe 200 accordions left in stock will be stored in a heated outbuilding at his house -where there is also a work bench set up and ready.\n\n\"That makes it sound as if I’ll just continue from home,\" said Emilio, laughing, as his wife, Kim watches on.\n\n\"I don’t want to do that, but I have to honour guarantees.\n\n\"Everything I sell has a three-year guarantee.\n\n\"Those people that bought them in the last three years need to know that I’m still going be there to finish the job if needed.\"\n\nEmilio said times have changed and his own children have not been as involved in the industry as family members before them.\n\nHe also wants to spend more time with his grandchildren, so it is time to close the shop this Christmas.\n\nThough Allodi Accordions will leave the Lewisham high street, Emilio said he hoped its legacy remained.\n\n\"My Dad’s name and reputation is the biggest thing of all - to not let him down.\n\n\"Hopefully I’ve continued in the same way and kept his name at the top of the tree.\""
