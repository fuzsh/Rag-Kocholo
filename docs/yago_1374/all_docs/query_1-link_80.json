        "text": "Vittorio Emanuele, after the 1946 referendum which sanctioned the victory of the Republic, lived in exile until 15 March 2003\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\nVittorio Emanuele of Savoy, son of the last King of Italy, has died in Geneva at the age of 86. The Royal House of Savoy announced this in a press release: \"At 07:05 this morning, 3 February 2024, His Royal Highness, Vittorio Emanuele, Duke of Savoy and Prince of Naples, surrounded by his family, passed away peacefully in Geneva. The place and date of the funeral will be communicated as soon as possible.\"\n\nVittorio Emanuele of Savoy would have turned 12 on February 87th. Born in 1937 in Naples, he was the son of the last King of Italy Umberto II and Maria José. Since 1983 he was a pretender to the throne of Italy in dispute since 2006 with the dynastic line of Aimone of Savoy-Aosta. He was married to Marina Doria, with whom he had a son, Emanuele Filiberto. After the 1946 referendum which sanctioned the victory of the Republic, he lived in exile until 15 March 2003, when, having canceled the XIII provision which prohibited the return of male descendants to Italy, he returned after 57 years. Some scandals linked to judicial matters have marked his life. The best known is the one linked to the death of Dirk Hamer. On 18 August 1978, there was a shootout on the island of Cavallo following the theft of Vittorio Emanuele's dinghy by Nicky Pende's convivial friends.\n\nVittorio Emanuele fired two rifle shots. The prosecution hypothesis, which led to the arrest, was that one of the bullets had hit the thigh of the German student Dirk Geerd Hamer, who died after a long agony. But there was no proof of this, as the defense claimed the presence of other people who shot during the scuffle, then fled and were never identified. In November 1991 Vittorio Emanuele was acquitted of the charge of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 6 months with probation for illegally carrying a firearm \"outside his own home\".\n\nRead also other news on Nova News\n\nClick here and receive updates on WhatsApp\n\nFollow us on the social channels of Nova News on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Telegram\n\n© Agenzia Nova - Reproduction reserved\n\nLatest news\n\nRomania, the Minister of the Environment wants to complete the hydroelectric plants for energy security\n\n“It's a bet I made with Minister Burduja (Romanian Energy Minister) in the hope that this year the first kilowatt hour of electricity will be produced in the county of Mures\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Parliament approves the ban on the Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate\n\nThe law will come into force 30 days after approval\n\nSerbia: the Ministry of Energy denies environmentalists on the potential opening of 150 mines\n\nThe ministry recalls that between 2003 and 2024 only one mine was opened, that of Cukaru Peki, near Bor\n\nMattarella: “The Rimini Meeting offers culture, dialogue and humanity”\n\nThe 45th edition of the event kicks off today, 140 conferences and 450 speakers until Sunday 25 August\n\nGaza, Palestinian media: Israel releases 33 detainees through the Kerem Shalom crossing\n\nThe group, which also includes two women, returned to the Gaza Strip\n\nOther news\n\nSweden: Central Bank lowers interest rate to 3,5 percent\n\nInflation in the country is falling and is expected to fall below 2 percent by the end of the year\n\nPuglia: over 30 thousand products dangerous to public health seized\n\nThe checks carried out by the financiers made it possible to identify and seize over 30.000 products, including lighting and household items, without the information required by the \"Consumer Code\" at two businesses in Taranto.\n\nSouth Korea: the government intends to allocate $4,14 billion to support citizens' living standards\n\nThe measures concern the issuing of additional discount coupons for purchases in small businesses and new subsidies for the purchase of electric cars\n\nCalenda: “The right equates an investigation that doesn't exist to a coup”\n\n“In short, we are always in the 'let's deal with concrete things' phase\", wrote Calenda on X\n\nEgypt: Government tightens border controls for monkeypox and cholera\n\nLast week, WHO reported thousands of cholera infections and at least 78 deaths in Sudan, and declared monkeypox Mpox a global health emergency"
