        "text": "Prince Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia, son of Umberto II, the last King of Italy, was laid to rest on Saturday, marking the end of a long and controversial life. In the Turin rain, European royals assembled to bid farewell to the Prince of Naples.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele’s son, Emanuele Filiberto arrived in a long black coat, looking sleek and sombre, as he sheltered from the rain under the umbrella; he held his mother, Princess Marina Doria, widow of the late Prince, by the arm, as the pair posed for photographers on the steps of the Duomo. Among the other close family members to arrive for the beginning of proceedings were Vittorio Emanuele's children, Vittoria of Savoy, Princess of Carignano and Luisa of Savoy, Princess of Chieri – elegantly turned out as ever as they processed the loss of their grandfather. They were joined by their mother – and wife of Emanuele Filiberto – Princess Clotilde Courau.\n\nFurther troupes of royals arrived promptly. They included Princess Olga of Savoy-Aosta and Prince Aimone; and later on, Albert, Prince of Monaco – who travelled without his wife, Charlene, and Queen Sofia of Spain.\n\nThe Italian royal family lost its power during the collapse of Italian fascism (and partly on account of association with Mussolini's fascists) just after the Second World War. A referendum in June 1943 saw the country vote to become a republic. Thereafter, the royal House of Savoy was exiled – with the now deceased Prince Vittorio Emanuele going into exile in Switzerland along with his mother. Males of the Savoy line were constitutionally banned from returning to Italy until 2002, when Vittorio Emanuele and his son, Emanuele Filiberto made homecoming – which included a reception with the Pope and a very frosty welcome from the Italian people.\n\nAfter the collapse of Savoyard power in Italy, Vittorio Emanuele was forced to find another way to build a life for himself. He became close to the late Shah of Iran – and made a fortune dealing arms. He later came under fire, facing charges of racketeering, taking bribes and procuring prostitutes for a casino. Perhaps the worst incidence of controversy for Vittorio came in 1978, when he was holidaying on his yacht near Corsica; believing that his inflatable boat had been stolen by tourists he emerged on the deck of his yacht with a rifle – and, firing at the presumed suspect, shot an accidentally killed a German teenager, Dirk Hamer.\n\nAs a young man, Vittorio Emanuele married Marina Ricolfi Doria, a Swiss waterskiing professional (much to his father's chagrin). They had a son, Emanuele Filiberto, whose own children include the Tatler cover star, model and society gem, Princess Vittoria of Savoy.\n\nAt the commencement of the funeral on Saturday, the steps of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist were decorated with ornate flower arrangements; the flowers arranged in vast shapes, and coloured according to the red and white crest of the house of Savoy.\n\nOn arrival, Prince Emanuele Filiberto kissed the coffin of his father. Others made thoughtful gestures, crossed themselves and rested their hands momentarily on the coffin. The wife of Emanuele Filiberto, Princess Clotilde Courau of Savoy wore a mournful black coat with wide lapels and a black silk necktie; these were paired with large pearl earrings.\n\nPrincess Marina Doria arrived in an extraordinary black fur coat, helped from her car by a young gentleman. Her pearl choker necklace, with flower pendant and thick black sunglasses made for a glamorous suite, even on such a sombre occasion. She too, rested both hands on her late husbands coffin, with her son standing just behind her to the right, as the rain continued to come down. Other royals arriving on the cathedral steps included Prince Charles Louis, Duke of Chartres, in a grey twill suit, black cloth tie and navy blue jacket. Prince Jean of Luxembourg wore a double breasted navy blue coat and a navy blue tie as he braved the rain.\n\nAt 2.30pm the doors to the venerable old Duomo closed and the royal family entered the cathedral along with the coffin. Following behind Emanuele Filiberto, was Johannes Niederhauser (General Secretary of Ordine Supremo della Santissima Annunziata), who brought with him upon a pillow the Collar of the Order of Savoy. The full name of the collar is The Collar Badge of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation; it is one of the oldest and grandest medieval chivalric orders still in use today. First instituted in the fourteenth century by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy, the order was dedicated the the Blessed Virgin Mary. Membership is represented by a beautiful gold medallion portraying the Annunciatioon, surrounded by intertwined Savoyan knots in gold and a cluster of rays.\n\nTo the sound of the anthem of the House of Savoy, Inno Sardo (the Sardinian Anthem), the Royal family entered the cathedral and the coffin was placed on a carpet before the altar. On the left side of the nave sat members of the Royal Family, flanked by the Sacra Sindone chapel. On the opposite side sat the various Heads of State, European royals and other dignitaries. The mass was held in Italian; and a Torinese choir sang exquisite hymns.\n\nAt the service’s 5pm conclusion, time was allotted for Prince Emanuele Filiberto to greet and thank the guests. He then departed along with the family and the coffin, toward the Basilica Superga, where the body was interred alongside other members of the historic House of Savoy."
