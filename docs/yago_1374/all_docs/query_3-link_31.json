        "text": "Umberto II (born Sept. 15, 1904, Racconigi, Italy—died March 18, 1983, Geneva, Switz.) was a prince of Savoy and briefly king of Italy in 1946 until he was forced to abdicate after a republican form of government was approved in a general referendum.\n\nThe son of King Victor Emmanuel III, Umberto graduated from the Royal Military Academy in Turin. He became a general in 1931 and commanded an armoured division in World War II. On Mussolini’s recommendation he was made marshal in October 1942. After the Allies took Rome, his father appointed him lieutenant general of the realm (June 2, 1944) and abdicated in his favour on May 9, 1946. Although Umberto campaigned to rally the monarchist forces, the Italian people voted for a republic. On June 14 Umberto and his male heirs were permanently banished from Italy. He took residence at Cascais, Port., under the title Count of Sarre."
