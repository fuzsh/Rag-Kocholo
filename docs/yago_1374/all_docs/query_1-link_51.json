        "text": "Umberto II, Italy's May King of 1946 whose throne was voted out from under him when he succeeded his banished father, died yesterday in a Geneva hospital after a long illness without having seen his native land again. He was 78 years old and had been living in exile in Portugal since the Republic of Italy was founded 37 years ago.\n\nThe last of the monarchs from the House of Savoy, Umberto - Humbert - was also the final link in a dynastic chain stretching back to the Middle Ages. He was the son of Victor Emmanuel III whose long rein, dating to 1900, became tethered to the Fascist dictatorship and the Rome-Berlin Axis in World War II, and foundered with them.\n\nWhen his father sought refuge in Egypt, the guest of King Farouk, Umberto took the crown on May 8, 1946, as Italy was bracing for a referendum on whether to stay a kingdom or become a republic. The tally, announced on June 7, was 45.7 percent to 54.3. Umberto abruptly left for Portugal's ''Gold Coast,'' saying he wanted to avert a civil war. Barred From Returning to Italy\n\nHe settled among the colony of unthroned royalty, fading pretenders, bluebloods and the merely fashionable who kept each other company in the fabled sea air of Estoril and Cascais."
