        "text": "Founder of the Savoy Dynasty was Humbert I the Whitehanded, or Umberto Biancamano, if you speak Italian. Umberto I might or might not have been a Burgundian.\n\nUmberto was count of Savoy from 1032 - 1048, while Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II ruled from 1024 to 1039.\n\nSee also Governments of Germany.\n\nSavoy put a foot in the Italian door when in 1046, Count Odo (also spelled Oddo, Otto, Otho, or Oddone) of Savoy married Countess Adelaide of Turin, which was not only a clever move but also the beginning of Savoyan influence over Piedmont, the region of which Turin was the capital.\n\nOtto ruled from 1051 - 1057.\n\nAdelaide is also called Adelaide of Susa, Susa being a town 50 car-minutes west of Turin.\n\nThe children of Odo and Adelaide were Peter I, Amadeus II, Bertha, and Adelaide Jr.\n\nPeter and Amadeus ruled together from 1060 until 1078, when Peter died. Amadeus followed suit and expired in 1080.\n\nAdelaide Jr. married Rudolph of Swabia.\n\nBertha married Germany's Henry IV, who ran into ecclesiastic troubles with Pope Gregory VII who excommunicated him in 1077.\n\nSee also Matilda of Canossa.\n\nAnd if you can stomach it, see also List of all Popes.\n\nBack to the history of the House of Savoy.\n\nCharles III the Good-Natured, brother of Philibert II, ruled from 1504 - 1553. Charles III made quite a mess of it. Among other incidents, he cut Nice loose, but the citizens of Nice were loyal to Savoy and fought their way out of it. Charles III died without funeral services while his quarters were ransacked by his servants.\n\nEmanuel Philibert the Iron-Headed, son of Charles III, ruled from 1553 - 1580.\n\nIn 1554, Emanuel Philibert visited London to attend the wedding of his cousin Philip II of Spain with Queen Mary. It was here that he received a marriage proposal to wed Princess Elizabeth, then 21 years old. Officially, he declined because the deal included handing over Nice and Villafranca to Spain. Unofficially, Lizzy drew his attention to her extended middle finger while the entire posse was concentrating on the turkey.\n\nThe Duchy of Savoy had grown. The family had acquired large numbers of Italian territories. Thus, in 1563, the House of Savoy moved its capital from Chambéry to Turin in Piedmont, thereby adjusting to the shifted geographical center of power.\n\nSavoy 1601\n\nVictor Amadeus I, son of Charles Emmanuel I, ruled from 1630 - 1637. He became first choice after his brother, Philip Emanuel, had left the equation due to fatal poisoning administered at the Spanish Court and prescribed directly by the King of Spain himself. Victor Amadeus I made a smart move by marrying Christine, aka Christine Marie of France, aka Madama Reale, daughter of French King Henry IV, in 1619.\n\nArch enemy of the decade was Richelieu, who wanted the House of Savoy extinct, which would mean an open door for France into annexing Italy.\n\nIt is rumored that Victor Amadeus I and his entourage was poisoned by Marshal Francois de Créqui (Crequi) at a banquet.\n\nVictor Emmanuel II, son of Charles Albert, ruled from 1849 - 1878. King of Sardinia-Piedmont and first king of United Italy.\n\nIn 1860, and in order to buy French Napoleon III's support against the Austrians, Savoy and Nice changed hands and became part of France.\n\nAll kings of Italy from 1861 to 1946 were members of the Savoy Dynasty.\n\nSee also Governments of Italy."
