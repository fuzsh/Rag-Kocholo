        "text": "Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia died today, February 3, in Geneva. He was a member of the House of Savoy, son of the last king of Italy Umberto II and Maria José. Since 1983 he has been a claimant to the Italian throne, disputed since 2006 with the dynastic line of Aimone di Savoia-Aosta. He was married to Marina Doria, with whom he had a son, Emanuele Filiberto.\n\nBirth Title\n\nVittorio Emanuele Alberto Carlo Teodoro Umberto Bonifacio Amedeo Damiano Bernardino Gennaro Maria was born in Naples on February 12, 1937. Acclaimed Prince of the Empire, he received from his grandfather the title of Prince of Naples, a tradition of the House of Savoy for the crown princes and their firstborn (along with that of Prince of Piedmont attributed to his father Umberto, then heir to the throne).\n\nThe Marriage\n\n\"With Corrado Agusta, and his secretary Franco Chiesa, in one shop we bought two wedding rings, in another a pre-packaged bouquet, then we went in front of a justice of the peace, who married us. It was January 11, 1970, in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. A civil marriage of which I informed no one, not even my parents\". This is how he recounted the marriage to Marina Doria, after a long and complicated engagement that lasted 13 years. The civil marriage on January 11, 1970 in Las Vegas and then religiously on October 7, 1971 in Tehran.\n\nThe Inheritance\n\nAlready during his university studies, due to his conduct, he had long since stopped receiving the allowance established by Umberto II for his children. After the wedding, it was established by the division of the paternal inheritance among all the children, contrary to what was decided by Umberto II to assign a larger share to his son, as his dynastic heir.\n\nMisunderstandings with his father\n\nSeveral misunderstandings with his father. In 1961 Umberto II invited former Captain of the Royal Army and Bronze Medal for Military Valor Franco Mattavelli to stay close to his son. His father had often reminded him of the validity of the centuries-old dynastic laws and the provisions of the Civil Code relating to royal consent, which was not granted for his marriage to Marina Doria. Based on this act contrary to dynastic rules, Amedeo di Savoia justified his claims as head of the House. Emanuele Filiberto was born in 1972 from his marriage to Marina Doria.\n\nThe Dispute\n\nSince the dynastic laws of the House of Savoy concern the marriages of princes, but not the marriages of kings, on December 15, 1969, being aware of the current laws and the father's refusal to consent to his marriage to Marina Doria, on the advice of the Grand Master of Freemasonry Giordano Gamberini, he circumvented the obstacle and issued a \"royal decree\" in which he elevated himself to king, proclaiming himself Vittorio Emanuele IV King of Italy, as he considered himself to have succeeded ipso jure to his father in 1946 as a result of his departure for exile, which he considered an abdication. \"By virtue of the succession, we also have the rights of the legitimate head of the Savoy dynasty and we will exercise these rights from now on, tempered only by the discretion that the physical and moral state of HM the former King Umberto II dictates to our conscience as a son\". The next day, in order to remedy the bourgeois condition of his girlfriend, as \"King of Italy\" he issued a second (and last) \"royal decree\", with which he conferred on Marina Doria the title of Duchess of Sant'Anna di Valdieri. A few days later, on January 11, 1970, he married her civilly in Las Vegas, later also contracting religious marriage in Tehran."
