        "text": "The downside of proportional representation, it turned out, was a famously volatile parliamentary system riven by corruption, nepotism, division, short-term alliances, trading of favours and fragile backroom deals. Hence, Italy’s 68 governments since WWII, nearly one a year, compared to one every 2.6 years in Britain and 2.82 years in Spain, according to the Pew Research Centre. “There is certainly a degree of fluidity and the ever-present element of surprise in modern Italian politics, which tends to complicate the overall picture and confound outsiders,” says Simone Battiston, senior lecturer in history and politics at Swinburne University of Technology.\n\nWorld events today only fuel this fragmentation, says Gabriele Abbondanza, an expert on Italian politics and foreign policy working in Australia, Italy and Spain. “Since 2000, Italy has received roughly 1.4 million irregular migrants by sea,” he says. “We have instability in North Africa and the Middle East, where thousands of Italian troops are stationed to support regional stability.” Other factors, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and China “destabilising the status quo”, also contribute to fragmenting, he says, “because every citizen has their own opinion as to what should be done.”\n\n(Meloni’s government last year imposed restrictions on non-government ships that rescue migrants in the Mediterranean; and, in a move to “offshoring”, two Italian-run camps in neighbouring Albania are set to house thousands of men rescued at sea while their asylum claims are processed. As for China, Italy will pull out of the Belt Road Initiative – Meloni has said Italy signing up, in 2019, was a “mistake” – but in Beijing in July, she signalled a “new phase” in relations, signing a co-operation deal in areas from shipbuilding to artificial intelligence, invoking Venetian merchant Marco Polo’s 13th-century travels on the Silk Road.)\n\nHolding together a government in this context necessarily requires the skills of a wheeler-dealer – such as those of Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire media tycoon (and former owner of AC Milan football club) who founded the centre-right party Forza Italia (Come on, Italy) in 1993. Berlusconi went on to form governments enough times to be prime minister for a record post-war total of almost 10 years, surviving allegations of corruption, unproven sex offences and infamous “bunga bunga” parties. In 2008, in the usual round of horse-trading, Berlusconi tapped Meloni, then just 31, who had been elected to parliament on a far-right ticket two years earlier, to become minister for youth, the second-youngest government minister in Italian history.\n\n‘The success of the party is certainly due to the political charisma and skills of Meloni … but also to the openings afforded by the Italian political system.’\n\nThey would later fall out, with Meloni later banding with far-right sympathisers to form Brothers of Italy, named after the opening line of the national anthem Fratelli d’Italia. “Ideologically,” says Simone Battiston, “Brothers of Italy is a national-conservative party. A key tenet of the party is the revival of national identity, which is intended to be the answer to the decline of Western civilisation. The success of the party is certainly due to the political charisma and skills of its leader, Meloni, and its well-disciplined party machine, but also to the openings afforded by the Italian political system.”\n\nItaly is one of only a few countries to reserve seats in its parliament for Italian citizens living abroad. Francesco Giacobbe, one of more than 150,000 Italians living in Australia, is one of four overseas senators elected for the Asia-Africa-Oceanic region, and a member of the Democratic Party. “Giorgia Meloni was very good in opposition,” he says. “And she’s a very good speaker as well. And a very good politician, a very good strategist and tactician.” She is well-connected, too: her sister, Arianna, is the partner of Francesco Lollobrigida, the Italian minister of agriculture (who is, incidentally, a grandnephew of the late Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida).\n\nIn the 2022 election, Brothers of Italy snared around a third of the popular vote (winning 119 of 400 seats in the lower house) but – as is always the way in Italy – still required support from other parties, including Berlusconi’s Forza Italia to form a government. After Meloni reportedly denied some of Berlusconi’s requests for ministerial positions, a note emerged in Berlusconi’s handwriting saying Meloni was “overbearing, domineering, arrogant, offensive”. Nevertheless, they patched it up: Meloni became Italy’s first female prime minister on October 22, 2022.\n\n“I don’t think that she seeks power for power itself, but she succeeds to do things that she’s always thought were necessary,” says Abbondanza. “She has a very peculiar personal history, family history, which might have impacted on her world view.”\n\nCould Italy really become a fascist dictatorship once more?\n\nLike France’s Marine Le Pen, who has worked to “detoxify” her National Rally party from its fascist roots, so too has Meloni disavowed the more extreme elements of her party’s support base. When a video from a hidden camera emerged in June showing members of the youth section of her party overtly celebrating fascism, she emailed party members: “I am angry and saddened … there is no room in our ranks for those who play a caricature role that only serves the narrative our opponents want to create about us … we don’t have time to lose with those who want to make us go backward.”\n\nSome observers believe Meloni has become a popular figure not because she embodies far-right nostalgia but because she has managed to shift her party away from the unelectable fringe and towards the centre right, where Berlusconi’s death last year left something of a power vacuum. “If Giorgia Meloni plays her cards well, she can fill in that political gap for years to come,” says Abbondanza.\n\nGeorge Newth, lecturer in politics at the University of Bath, believes “there has been a mainstreaming and normalisation of the far right over the past three decades in Italy and, indeed, throughout Europe. Berlusconi played a key role in this: he took a revisionist view of Mussolini’s role in Italian history, believing him to be an essentially ‘benign dictator’. This provided a counter-narrative that contradicted the reality of the Italian republic’s anti-fascist foundations.”\n\nAs for the anxiety among left-leaning media when Meloni became prime minister, in practice, she and other hard-right leaders, such as Le Pen, have had to cushion their messages or abandon positions entirely to become electable. “The whole tenor and tone of the [2022] campaign was much more calm and moderate,” Alexander Stille, a professor at the Columbia Journalism School and the author of several books about Italian history and politics, reflected in 2022. “Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t people in her party who may, in the privacy of their home, defend Mussolini. But that’s clearly not what the electorate was demanding, nor was it what Meloni was offering.”\n\nIn elections for the European Parliament in June, Italian voters gave Meloni’s party the most votes among domestic contenders (28 per cent). She has more recently raised eyebrows after her party declined to vote for the re-election of the European Commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is from the centre-right but whose support also included the Greens – a move some analysts saw as Meloni keeping faith with grassroots support at home even as she tries to avoid tags of “hardline right” in Europe.\n\n“Consider, first, all the things that have not happened,” notes The Economist of Italy. “Social policy has remained unaltered, despite the Brothers’ hostility to abortion and gay civil unions. It is true that there has been no progress towards gay marriage or same-sex adoption, but neither has there been any backsliding. Italy’s first female prime minister does not profess to be a feminist, but she is a tough single mother who unceremoniously dumped her partner for propositioning his female colleagues.” In 2023, Meloni abruptly broke up with her long-term partner, television presenter Andrea Giambruno, after he was recorded making lewd comments to female colleagues.\n\n‘Italy is the only major Western European country to be led by a far-right leader. And the question is, is she less reactionary than we all thought?’\n\nHervé Lemahieu, Lowy Institute\n\nWhile Meloni might have been expected to support “strongman” Russian leader Vladimir Putin, instead, she sides with Ukraine. Says Hervé Lemahieu: “It is, exactly, the realities of governing. That’s what makes her such an interesting case. Italy is the only major Western European country to be led by a far-right leader. And the question is, is she less reactionary than we all thought? Are the realities of governing conditioning her in a more centrist and predictable direction? Or are the extremes becoming more mainstream? So far, at least, she’s proven to be remarkably unremarkable in power.”\n\nGeorge Newth isn’t so convinced. “The idea was to bring far-right ideology into the mainstream by portraying extreme, racist policies as ‘normal’ ideas based on views shared by ordinary Italians.” The key issue, he says, is “not that Meloni has abandoned her extreme platform but rather that she has successfully framed her views as ‘not far-right but common sense’, ‘centre-right or conservative’ and even ‘non-ideological’. Many mainstream actors and outlets in both politics and the media have been willing to accept this narrative and aid in Meloni’s reconstruction.”\n\nAs with many far-right parties, Newth adds, rather than talking about race, Meloni’s party has referred to culture, identity and traditions, “all of which, however, are still racist dog-whistles which create an ‘us’ and ‘them’. This has involved, in many cases, conveying a dual message – one steeped in calculated ambivalence,” he says, “whereby they attempt to outwardly distance themselves from fascism while at the same time re-contextualising fascist ideas.”\n\nSo, is Italy still at risk of insidiously returning to its totalitarian, nationalist past? The short answer is, it’s unlikely – although some believe that Meloni’s current push to change the Constitution might be a step in that direction. Her proposal, before parliament, is to change how seats are allocated to guarantee the party with the most votes 55 per cent. She also wants prime ministers to be given guaranteed five-year terms.\n\nIt won’t be easy. Any change to the constitution must be approved by both houses of parliament twice, with a two-thirds majority necessary for the final round of votes. If that fails, a referendum has to be held. “The Constitution makes it very difficult to do very much in Italy. That’s what it was built for, to stop people from doing stuff, and it does the job,” says historian John Foot in The New Yorker.\n\nA push in 2023 from some within her party to make it an offence to use English in official communications was treated less seriously. One news service pointed out that the commonly used term for hand sanitiser, the English word “dispenser”, would need to be replaced by the Italian expression: “dispensatore di liquido igienizzante per le mani”.\n\nFor now, says Hervé Lemahieu, “She’s got her eyes on the next election in 2027, and she’ll be keen not to be a one-hit wonder. She wants her Brothers of Italy party to move from the fringes of society to being firmly embedded in mainstream politics.”\n\n“I’m not worried about fascists,” says Francesco Giacobbe. “I’m not worried about the possibility that there will be an authoritarian or dictatorship. The time is gone. So I think that the people, the community, the democracy is so mature that it’s almost impossible.”"
