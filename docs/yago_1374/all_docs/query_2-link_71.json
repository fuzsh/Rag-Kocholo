        "text": "Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, The Prince of Naples (February 12, 1937 – February 3, 2024) was the only son of Umberto II, the last King of Italy, and his wife Princess Marie-José of Belgium, the youngest child of King Albert I of the Belgians and his consort, Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria. Through her mother she was a grandniece of Empress Elisabeth of Austria and of Princess Maria Sophie of Bavaria, last queen consort of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele also used the title Duke of Savoy and claimed the headship of the House of Savoy. Had the monarchy not been abolished he would have reigned as monarch under the name of King Vittorio Emanuele IV of Italy and reigned from 1983 to 2024.\n\nHe lived for most of his life in exile, following the constitutional referendum of 1946 which affirmed the abolition of the monarchy and the creation of the Italian Republic. On several occasions, he was the centre of controversy in Italy and abroad due to a series of incidents, including remarks that were seen by some as antisemitic.\n\nHe was revealed to be a member of Propaganda Due (P2), the state within a state responsible for high-level corruption and political manipulation. In France he was tried on a murder charge, of which he was cleared of unlawful killing but convicted of a firearms offence.\n\nOn June 16, 2006, following an investigation started by John Woodcock of the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Potenza, Italy, Prince Vittorio Emanuele was arrested on charges of criminal association, racketeering, conspiracy, corruption, and exploitation of prostitution. A trial on these charges began in Potenza, Italy, on December 21, 2009. Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia was acquitted of all charges in 2007 and 2010.\n\nEarly life and family\n\nWhen King Umberto II left Italy after the monarchy was abolished by the 1946 Italian institutional referendum, the remaining members of the House of Savoy lived in exile, mostly in Switzerland and on the Portuguese Riviera, though the former King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy, grandfather to Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, lived in Egypt until his death in 1947.\n\nFollowing the separation of the exiled ex-King and ex-Queen, Prince Vittorio Emanuele lived with his mother on an estate in Merlinge, Switzerland. Prince Vittorio Emanuele and his family resided in Geneva.\n\nAfter an eleven-year relationship, Prince Vittorio Emanuele married Swiss biscuit heiress and world-ranked water skier Marina Doria in Tehran, Iran, on October 7, 1971, at the occasion of the 2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire. Coincidentally, Prince Vittorio Emanuele and his wife Marina shared a birthday (12 February) but Prince Vittorio Emanuele is two years younger than Marina (she was born in 1935).\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele worked as a banker and an aircraft salesman, and then an arms dealer.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele had one son, Prince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, Prince of Venice, born on June 22, 1972, who has two daughters.\n\nDuke of Savoy\n\nOn July 7, 2006 Prince Vittorio Emanuele’s kinsman and dynastic rival, Prince Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, declared himself to be the head of the House of Savoy and Duke of Savoy, claiming that Prince Vittorio Emanuele had lost his dynastic rights when he married without the permission of Umberto II in 1971. Prince Amedeo received the support of the President of the Council of the Senators of the Kingdom Aldo Alessandro Mola and Vittorio Emanuele’s sister, Princess Maria Gabriella.\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele and his son applied for a judicial injunction to forbid Prince Amedeo from using the title “Duke of Savoy”. In February 2010, the court of Arezzo ruled that the Duke of Aosta and his son must pay damages totalling €50,000 to their cousins and cease using the surname Savoy instead of Savoy-Aosta.\n\nHowever, the verdict was overturned on appeal, with the court of second resort allowing Prince Amedeo the use of the short surname, in the form of di Savoia, and additionally revoking the financial penalty originally imposed on him. The dynastic dispute has not been resolved.\n\nDeath\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele died in Geneva, Switzerland on February 3, 2024, at the age of 86. A statement from the Royal House of Savoy gave the time of his death as 07:05 (CET).\n\nSuccession\n\nIn June of 2023, his son Prince Emanuele Filiberto, Prince of Venice announced his intention to abdicate his claim to the throne in favour of his daughter, Princess Vittoria of Savoy, when he feels she is ready to succeed. Until he formally does so he remains as his father’s heir.\n\nOn February 3, 2024, with the death of his father, Prince Emanuele Filberto became one of two claimants to the headship of the House of Savoy.\n\nThe monarchs of the House of Savoy ruled from their mainland capital of Turin, but styled themselves primarily with the royal title of Sardinia as superior to their original lesser dignity as Dukes of Savoy. However, their numeral order continued the Savoyard list.\n\nWith that in mind there was a previous Duke of Savoy, named, Prince Emanuele Filiberto (July 8, 1528 – August 30, 1580) was Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from August 17, 1553 until his death on August 30, 1580."
