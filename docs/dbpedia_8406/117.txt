Spain has two time zones. One for mainland Spain and another for the Canary Islands. Barcelona is in the time zone CET Central European Time (GMT+01:00) so the same time as Paris, Berlin and Rome.

For summer Daylight Saving Time Barcelona is Central European Summer Time (GMT+02:00). All of Mainland Spain is in the CET time zone except the Canary Islands.

The Canary Islands are in Western European Time (GMT±00:00) and in summer in the Western European Summer Time (GMT+01:00). Daylight saving time starts in Spain on last Sunday in March (01:00 GMT) and ends on the last Sunday in October (01:00 GMT)

Mainland Spain was previously on Greenwich Mean Time (UTC±00:00) before World War II (except for the Canary Islands which used GMT−01:00 before WWII).

However, the time zone was changed to Central European Time under the dictatorship of Fransisco Franco, during the second world war to make business with Germany more efficient.

Spain has beenthere ever since although it is technically in the wrong time zone under the international coordinated time zone system.

Spain should be at the same time as Portugal and the UK. Some people believe that this 1 hour time zone shift plays a role in the country's relatively laid back daily schedule of late meals and late sleep times due to darker mornings and lighter evenings.
