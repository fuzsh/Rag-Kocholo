Before January 1, 1901, the official time of Spain was the Meridian of Madrid (3º 41'West), although each province had the local time corresponding to its Meridian, (the local time, was equal to the local length) .

On January 1, 1901, at 0h. the Greenwich Mean Time is adopted 0º UTC 0h. or (GMT 0h), consequently Local Time corresponded to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).

On April 15, 1918, DST (Daylight Saving Time) was introduced for the first time, advancing the clock by 1 hour, so that in the summer time, the Coordinated Universal Time UTC + 1h was used with respect to the meridian of Greenwich 0º.

On March 16, 1940 at 11 p.m. the time of the 15º East Meridian UTC + 1h or (GMT + 1h) is adopted, so 1h is established of permanent advance with respect to (UTC) Coordinated Universal Time or the 0º Meridian (GMT), and 2h in summer time UTC + 2h.
