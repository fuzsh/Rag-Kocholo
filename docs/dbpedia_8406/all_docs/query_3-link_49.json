        "text": "The INSIDER Summary:\n\nIn 1940, Spanish General Francisco Franco moved Spain's clocks ahead one hour in order to be on the same time as Nazi Germany.\n\nTherefore, the country is on Central European Time, when it should really be on Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nThe time change meant that the sun rose and set later, and that the Spaniards ended up eating their meals an hour later.\n\nThese late nights are a large part of the reason the country has siesta time, a two-hour lunch break.\n\nBecause of the siesta, coupled with another mid-morning break that carries workers to their late lunch, most Spaniards don't end their day until 8 p.m., even though they start around 9 a.m.\n\nSpain has a longstanding reputation of running on their own time.\n\nIt's completely normal to find locals all over the country enjoying a 10 p.m. dinner, something that many people consider to be a product of Spain's \"laid-back lifestyle.\"\n\nIn reality, though, there's a very logical reason behind Spaniards' late-night eating habits: the country is actually in the wrong time zone, a phenomenon that dates back to World War II.\n\nGiven Spain's longitude, the country should be on Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), along with Portugal, the UK, and Morocco. Instead, it's on Central European Time (CET).\n\nAccording to BBC, this is because Spanish General Francisco Franco moved Spain's clocks one hour ahead in 1940, so that the country would be in sync with Nazi Germany. The Spaniards, however, didn't adjust their daily schedules to the new time zone.\n\nTheir meal times stayed the same, which meant 8 p.m. dinners were pushed back to 9 p.m., and 1 p.m. lunches were pushed to 2 p.m. Plus, the change meant that the sun rose an hour later and set an hour later, providing the country with daylight that stretched long into the evening hours.\n\nThese late nights are a large part of the reason the country has siesta time, a two-hour lunch break that typically occurs between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. and that — in theory — gives Spaniards a chance to take a midday nap. Because of the siesta, coupled with another mid-morning break that carries workers through to their late lunch, most Spaniards don't end their day until 8 p.m., even though they start around 9 a.m.\n\nHowever, a recent study found that about 60% of the country's inhabitants don't actually nap during siesta. Instead, businesses in cities and resort destinations stay open during siesta time, in order not to miss out on tourist spending. Other businesses simply take a very long lunch break, but no nap.\n\nEither way, the mid-morning break and siesta translate into a longer work day, a later dinner, a later bedtime, and therefore fewer hours of sleep for most Spaniards. This is what motivated an organization known as the National Commission for the Rationalization of Spanish Schedules, which is trying to get the country to move back to to the time zone it should actually be in — GMT.\n\nMembers of the organization say the move would put Spaniards back on a more \"normal\" schedule, moving everything up an hour, which would negate the need for a siesta and allow for an extra hour of sleep."
