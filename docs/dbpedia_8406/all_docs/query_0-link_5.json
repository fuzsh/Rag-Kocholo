CET is UTC +0100 and CEST is UTC +0200. Spain's latitude and longitude is 40° 00N and 4° 00W! Therefore Spain is in the wrong time zone. The Prime Meridian runs through the country, geographically it is clear Spain should be observing GMT. Considering its high latitude the use of daylight savings time in Spain is less surprising."
