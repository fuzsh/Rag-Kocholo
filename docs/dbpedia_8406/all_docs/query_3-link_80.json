        "text": "The relationship between science and society is under review; whereas the interaction was often considered to be a one way street where researchers disseminate knowledge and implement change. It is now more encouraged to have a continuous two way conversation between researchers and societal stakeholders. The underlying principle is that continuous engagement can help increase accountability, transparency and trust while also helping researchers improve responses to social needs on a local, national, or global level.\n\nRecent efforts by funding organisations, higher education institutions, and research academies to integrate public engagement throughout the research process aim to make research more relevant, impactful and trusted. The idea is that societal stakeholders should be involved in the design, conduct, and dissemination of research. In several countries such as the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Germany and Luxembourg, national funders are promoting collaboration with non-academic partners and communities to encourage researchers to develop ideas with their strategic partners early on and ensure that research and innovation is responsive to the knowledge priorities and value of society. Their mission is also to improve research quality, generate fresh insights into the research challenges, and improve trust between research institutions and society. Public engagement as a route to societal impact raises challenges for funders, research enablers, and senior managers at higher education institutes or research academies. Examples of such questions are:\n\nHow to best incentivise and support researchers?;\n\nWhat is the best way to measure impact and public engagement?;\n\nHow to ensure public engagement is integrated throughout the whole research process?"
