Most programming languages have libraries to help you converting time zones, calculating by hand might not be a good idea because of the variety of time zones en daylight saving times. But here's a list of time zones and offset in seconds.\n\nConvert epoch to other time zone\n\nConvert to time zone\n\nTime zones\n\nThe 'Converted timestamp' column shows the time for Unix timestamp 1724021100 (Aug 18 2024 22:45:00 UTC/GMT).\n\nFilter by city:\n\nDaylight Saving Times (DST)"
