Watch this video animation to find out some interesting facts:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/MO5EolWTGeo\n\nBusiness Culture in Spain is characterised by: business communication, business etiquette, business meeting etiquette, internship and student placements, cost of living, work-life-balance and social media guide.\n\nGeneral Education\n\nIn Spain, education serves as an important instrument in national integration by promoting equal opportunities as well as democratic, social and cultural-values. However, Spain has traditionally spent less on education than other western European countries. Primary education is free and mandatory and there exists an extensive network of private schools. Some of which are subsidised by the government and offer primary education free or at a reduced fee. There are also a considerable number of religious schools, which often offer a high quality of education. The quality of private sector schools varies greatly and as many of them are severely underfunded. Private education is not necessarily associated with elite education, as is often the case in other western European countries.\n\nIn the 1980’s, the educational system was challenged and a new law on the right to education was introduced. Schools were sorted into three categories: free public schools respecting diverse religious beliefs, private schools offering paid education and religious schools. Here students enjoyed the right not to receive instruction that violated their religious beliefs.\n\nHigher Studies\n\nOver recent decades, the Spanish education system has enjoyed a huge success in getting the population into higher education. Since the 1960’s, university enrolments have nearly quadrupled. Spain now has some of the highest proportions of young people going on to higher education in Europe. However, the situation is not so bright when it comes to the student-teacher ratio in the school-age population. A teacher’s job is not as highly regarded as in other western European countries.\n\nDo you want to learn more about business culture in Spain?"
