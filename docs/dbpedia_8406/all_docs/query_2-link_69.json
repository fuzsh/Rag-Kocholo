        "text": "Check what time the next Formula 1 race and every Grand Prix in 2022 starts in multiple time zones in the UK, Europe, North America and Asia.\n\nThe upcoming 2022 Formula 1 season is not only bringing a mega-exciting change in regulation, but also a return to normality. After a few years of COVID-affected F1 calendars and cancellations, the season will see racing return to some corners of the world that have missed out since 2020.\n\nThese races include Australia and Japan – races that take place in a radically different time zone to the European-centric race times we’ve been used to. Traditionally, this means early starts and strong coffees for viewers in Europe, or even late-night Saturday viewing in North America.\n\nBut spare a thought for those in Asia and Australia, who have to wake up at the crack of dawn to catch races live.\n\nWith the race start times released by Formula 1, we’ve adjusted the lights out time for every major time zone. So grab a pen to mark your calendar, and arrange your 2022 social arrangements accordingly.\n\nFormula 1 race start times across the world\n\nRace start times in the UK and Europe\n\nMost Formula 1 races are timed to align with European fans – the sport’s biggest market. Traditionally, races in Europe will begin around 1 or 2 o’clock on a Sunday afternoon. In fact, every race starts in the afternoon or evening for European fans except Australia and Japan, which begin at 6am CET/BST.\n\nNote: Daylight savings in the UK and Europe occurs between the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix (27 March) and Mexico City Grand Prix (30 October).\n\nRace start times in the United States and Canada\n\nFormula 1 is usually early morning viewing for North American fans. The European chunk of races in the summer start as early as 6 am PDT. However, with two races in the US plus events in Canada and Brazil, there’ll be plenty of prime time Sunday afternoon action. Speaking of prime time, two races will sneak into the late-night Saturday slots in 2022: Australia and Japan will begin at 10pm PDT. Other early races include Azerbaijan, Russia and Singapore which begin prior to 6am PDT.\n\n*Race starts on Saturday evening\n\n**Daylight savings begins in the US on 13 March and ends on 6 November – subtract one hour from Sao Paolo and Abu Dhabi times to find PST, EST or CST times.\n\nRace start times in Australia\n\nAustralia finally returns to the F1 calendar after a long wait since 2020. Most races for Aussie fans will take place at reasonable Sunday evening timeslots. However, races in the Americas and some night races in the Middle East will be early morning occasions. We’ve reflected any date changes to the Grands Prix for Australian fans in the table below.\n\n*Daylight savings time in place in some parts of Australia\n\n**Race takes place on Monday morning.\n\n(Dates have been amended to Monday where the race begins on Monday morning.)\n\nRace start times in India, China and Japan\n\nFormula 1 will also be back in Asia in 2022, with races in Japan and Singapore back on the cards. The Chinese Grand Prix has been postponed, but there’ll be an increased interest with young Guanyu Zhou becoming the first Chinese driver on the grid. It’s mostly late-night viewing for fans in Asia, with European races taking place on Sunday evening."
