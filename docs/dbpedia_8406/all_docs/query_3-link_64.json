        "text": "What was it that Bob Dylan wrote? Ahh yes, “The times they are a changin’“. So why do I bring that song up? It’s really a mundane thing, but the time in Spain will be changing. It’s time to turn the clocks back. Who out there (in the Northern Hemisphere) has been waiting all year for that extra hour of sleep? This guy, that’s who!\n\nGeneral Info about Time in Spain\n\nSince we’re part of the EU, we use metric time here. Instead of 60 seconds in a minute, there are 100 metric seconds (called centons) in a metric minute. There’s still 60 minutes in an hour though. Go figure! If you were reading those last few sentences and were wondering, “What the hell?!“, you fell for it. I just love my sense of humor. You caught me in a strange mood, what can I say.\n\nOK…for reals. There are 2 Spain time zones. Continental Spain time is GMT + 1. The Canary Islands are GMT. We do observe Daylight Savings Time, so we change the clocks on the last Sunday of March (clocks forward – Boooo!) and the last Sunday of October (clocks backward – Yippee!).\n\nThe actual time zone designations are CET (Central European Time) and CEST (Central European Summer Time)).\n\nTime for a rant about Spain Time!\n\nAs I mentioned above, Spain time is an hour ahead of GMT. The G in GMT is Greenwich, which is in London. Now without really thinking about it, you would naturally think that Spain would be east of London right? Check this out:\n\nNotice anything strange? Yeah…Most of Spain is actually west of London. There is a reason for this craziness, and it was due to Francisco Franco changing the time zone during World War II to match the time in Berlin. And they’ve never gotten around to changing it back.\n\nDaylight Savings Change Spain Time\n\nThere are some interesting changes planned for the use of DST. Not just in Spain, but all throughout Europe, and specifically the E.U. There is a bunch of talk about completely doing away with DST. This means not changing the clocks every March and October. It’s not 100% a done deal, but potentially, the time change that will happen in a few days might be the last one. I think the plan is to ratify the change this year, so we won’t have to worry about this anymore. Woo hoo!\n\nI’m not sure what the impact will be to the daily life of the average Spaniard, but it’s one less thing to worry about.\n\nTo Sum Up The Time In Spain\n\nLet me net it out for you:\n\nTime In Spain changes in the March 28, and the clocks go forward an hour.\n\nThis may be the last time we do the Daylight Savings change for Spain time. Thumbs up!\n\nSpain is still in the wrong time zone. Not good, but I’ve been reaching out to various Ministers of This-or-That and Representatives, to see about getting this changed. Stay tuned!\n\nWhat time is it in Spain right now?\n\nThere are several sites that will show you the current Spain time. Of course they each offer the time, but also a few other bits of data.\n\nTime is – such a fun way to see the current time for any location. It also shows the current time for several other cities.\n\nThis will provide you the current local time.\n\n24 time zones is another place to check the current time.\n\nAs of 2021 one final change of the clocks\n\nSunday October 25, 2020 at 2am, Spain’s clocks will go back one hour. The same would apply to all of Europe & the UK. Then in the spring on March 28, 2021 at 2am, the go forward 1 hour.\n\nBy March 2021, each EU country will need to decide which time they want to permanently remain on, standard or day light saving. In the year 2021, they will make that permanent change in March or October.\n\nFor some of the EU countries, this change will be a permanent change and they will not go back and forth each fall and spring.\n\nThe other EU countries who choose not to make it a permanent change, will go back one hour on October 31, 2021 and then they will make that their permanent change.\n\nRead more about the announcement here.\n\nThings to do in Spain by region\n\nInfo on getting your Non Lucrative Visa Spain Here\n\nThis ebook is your step by step guide to obtaining a Spanish non lucrative Visa or retirement visa to Live In Spain.
