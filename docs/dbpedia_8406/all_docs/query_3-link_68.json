It means that the sun won’t be rising until after 8:30am here in “sunny” Seville. In March! This isn’t the dead of winter. It’s the start of spring! So why will I (and the rest of the Spanish workforce) be waking up and starting our days in the pitch black? Well, it’s the Nazis’ fault. No, seriously.\n\nBefore we get to the Nazis, let’s establish some facts: Spain is in the wrong timezone. It’s as simple as that. Just look at a map. Geographically speaking, Spain should follow Western European Time a.k.a Greenwich Mean Time (UTC ± 0:00) along with the likes of Portugal, the United Kingdom, and Ireland; all countries that share a similar longitude on the western edge of Europe. But instead, Spain follows Central European Time (UTC +1:00).
