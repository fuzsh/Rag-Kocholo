        "text": "The time zone in Italy\n\nCET (Central European Time) applies throughout Italy. From early autumn to late winter, standard time applies, corresponding to the time zone UTC+1, one hour ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.\n\nAt the beginning of spring, Italy enters daylight saving time: the clocks move forward by one hour (UTC+2 time zone), to enjoy more sunlight in the late afternoon-evening.\n\nThe change from standard time to daylight saving time and vice versa always takes place on the night between Saturday and Sunday. The dates vary from year to year.\n\nItalian meal times and usual daily routines\n\nItalians normally have breakfast from 7.00 a.m., but some bars and pastry shops open as early as 6.00 a.m. Hotels usually have a set time (approximately 10.00 a.m.) at which breakfast ends. Room service is generally available for requests outside these hours.\n\nLunch in restaurants, farmhouses, diners or bars is usually served from 12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. On special occasions or events, the start and duration of lunch may vary.\n\nThe “aperitif” is not to be missed: it takes place roughly from 6 p.m. until dinnertime.\n\nDinner is normally served from 7.30 p.m. until 11 p.m.\n\nYou can also find venues offering a late dinner, for after a theatre performance or for those who prefer to eat late at night.\n\nPublic holidays in Italy: national holidays and patron saints’ days\n\nIn addition to Sundays, Italy also closes for national holidays and feast days held in honour of patron saints.\n\nThere are. On these days, most of the country’s business activities stop, and public and private offices close. Some museums and cultural sites close on certain holidays: we recommend checking up on this before planning your visit. Bars, pastry shops, ice cream parlours and restaurants, however, often remain open. Below are holiday dates:\n\n1st January - New Year’s Day\n\n6th January - Epiphany\n\nEaster (the date varies from year to year)\n\nEaster Monday (the day after Easter)\n\n25th April - Liberation Day\n\n1st May - May Day\n\n2nd June - Republic Day\n\n15th August - Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Ferragosto)\n\n1st November - All Saints’ Day\n\n8th December - Feast of the Immaculate Conception\n\n25th December - Christmas Day\n\n26th December - St Steven’s Day\n\nAs far as are concerned, in many cities the day of the local patron saint is a day of celebration. Offices and businesses may be closed, but it is still possible to make the most of these occasions to attend often fascinating and engaging celebrations. The dates are listed below:\n\n29th January - San Costanzo, Perugia (Umbria)\n\n23rd April - San Giorgio, Campobasso (Molise)\n\n25th April - San Marco, Venice (Veneto)\n\n4th May - San Ciriaco di Gerusalemme, Ancona (Marche)\n\n9th May and 6th December - San Nicola, Bari (Apulia)\n\n30th May - San Gerardo, Potenza (Basilicata)\n\n10th June - San Massimo d’Aveia, L’Aquila (Abruzzo)\n\n24th June - San Giovanni, Genoa (Liguria)\n\n24th June - San Giovanni, Florence (Tuscany)\n\n24th June - San Giovanni, Turin (Piedmont)\n\n26th June - San Vigilio, Trento (Trentino)\n\n29th June - San Pietro and Paolo, Rome (Lazio)\n\n15th July - Santa Rosalia, Palermo (Sicily)\n\n16th July - San Vitaliano, Catanzaro (Calabria)\n\n7th September - San Grato, Aosta (Aosta Valley)\n\n19th September - San Gennaro, Naples (Campania)\n\n4th October - San Petronio, Bologna (Emilia-Romagna)\n\n30th October - San Saturnino, Cagliari (Sardinia)\n\n3rd November - San Giusto, Trieste (Friuli-Venezia Giulia)\n\n7th December - Sant’Ambrogio, Milan (Lombardy)\n\nSome recommendations\n\nCraft shops and artisan workshops\n\nYou can’t visit Italy and not stop by a craft shop or artisan workshop. Here is some key information regarding shop opening and closing times:\n\nAs a general rule, shops are open from Monday to Saturday.\n\nSome are open around the clock from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., others close at lunchtime, approximately from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.\n\nIn historical and tourist centres, many shops are also open on Sundays, as well as in airports and large railway stations. Obviously, these are indicative opening hours that vary from north to south, or, in popular tourist locations, according to the season, with extended opening hours in the high season and reduced opening hours in the middle and low season.\n\nTo facilitate your clothes shopping, we recommend checking these conversion tables: They will help you compare the sizes of your home country with those of Italy.\n\nAperitif\n\nA typical aspect of the Italian lifestyle is the social “aperitivo” (aperitif). Here are some tips on this famous all-Italian culinary ritual.\n\nThe aperitif is enjoyed roughly from 6 p.m. until dinnertime. A moment of relaxation at the end of a day’s work, especially in the northern business hubs, it has quickly become an opportunity to enjoy mini gastronomic delicacies, accompanied by a Spritz or a glass of Italian Prosecco, now standard throughout the country.\n\nThe term “apericena”, on the other hand, indicates the XL version of the aperitif, with a quantity and variety of food equivalent to a real dinner.\n\nRestaurants\n\nItalian restaurants offer a wide variety of food and wine experiences throughout the country. The renowned Mediterranean diet can be served in countless different ways, from the genuine taste of tradition to the gastronomic revolutions of the many Michelin-star chefs. Alongside family-run restaurants, where you can experience the true flavour of Italian cuisine and its regional nuances, you can also find avant-garde food offerings. Not forgetting vegetarian, fusion and zero-food-mile proposals. Everyone can eat Italian. The quality of the cuisine matches the beauty of the locations: you can eat in a high-altitude Michel-star restaurant, in the snow, or in a typical trattoria in a big city.\n\nTo enjoy Italian food and wine to the fullest, we recommend booking a table in the establishment of your choice.\n\nMuseums and archaeological sites\n\nItaly boasts an artistic and cultural heritage that many consider second to none in the world. Throughout Italy, there are numerous museums and archaeological sites that attract thousands of tourists every year.\n\nYou can plan visits to museums and archaeological sites simply by booking online or by telephone, exclusively using the official ticketing systems of the places you want to visit.\n\nThere is a reduced rate for groups, children and seniors over 70.\n\nAdmission is free to all state museums on the first Sunday of the month.\n\nIt is also a good idea to always use official channels when booking tour guides: be wary of those who offer this type of service on the street or near to Italian cultural centres and museum sites, unless they are officially authorised by them. Licensed guides are recognisable by the licence they wear prominently around their neck.\n\nMeasurement systems"
