        "text": "With these practical Netherlands travel tips about Holland, I‚Äôm trying to make your trip to Holland frictionless, more enjoyable, and, above all, more relaxed.\n\nYou can click from the index below to go directly to the topic of your choice. Or, of course, you can read them all, and you‚Äôll be current on everything Holland üòâ\n\nFind practical information about the best time to travel, the weather, money, electricity, accessibility, and everything in between.\n\nTable of Contents For Netherlands Travel Tips\n\nAccessibility\n\nIf you travel with a disability, you should find ‚Äì in general ‚Äì that Holland as a country is well adapted for travelers with a disability. Most public buildings are accessible, as are most museums, theme parks, and restaurants.\n\nTaking public transport is generally possible, but it can require some extra planning if you take the train. Read more about this in my full article about travel in the Netherlands with a disability.\n\nThe one major exception for good accessibility is the Anne Frank House Museum. Read more about that here.\n\nPublic spaces in modern parts of villages, towns, and cities are well adapted to wheelchair users. Still, older historic city centers can prove challenging at times.\n\nAirports\n\nAmsterdam Airport Schiphol is the largest airport in Holland and is used by most visitors.\n\nThere are also four smaller airports in Holland. They can be convenient if you want to combine your visit to Holland with other European destinations. Usually, you can travel at better prices from these airports and be in and out of the airport much quicker.\n\nThese airports are:\n\nRotterdam/The Hague Airport\n\nEindhoven Airport\n\nMaastricht/Aachen Airport\n\nGroningen Airport\n\nRead more about the airports in Holland in our dedicated post here.\n\nBest Time To Travel to Holland\n\nHolland can be visited year-round, and each season has pros and cons.\n\nSpring is one of the most popular seasons to visit Holland. Expect large crowds and high prices, especially in flower season. That is between the last week of March and the first week of May.\n\nThe best weeks to see most flowers bloom are the 3rd and 4th week of April. April and May are also the months with the most sunshine (on average) in Holland.\n\nAs a bonus, April and May are also great for joining typical Dutch celebrations. On April 27th, it‚Äôs Kings Day, May 4th is Remembrance Day, and May 5th is Liberation Day.\n\nKingsday is a national holiday and the most significant national celebration ever. Make sure to wear something orange if you‚Äôre here!\n\nSummers can be hot in Amsterdam or full of rain. You never know. Neither is particularly pleasant.\n\nThe Germans will invade our beaches :-). And in August, when France, Spain, and Italy have their holiday together, Holland, our tiny country, is swamped by tourists. Especially Amsterdam then bursts to its seams with tourists.\n\nPlus, the Dutch have their long summer holidays. They‚Äôre going on many day trips adding to an overhaul feeling of the busyness of cities and attractions all around the country.\n\nI think The Netherlands is best to be avoided for a visit during summer. Unless you have the urge to practice your French, Italian, or German, then summertime is perfect!\n\nThe one event worth visiting during the summer, despite high prices and crowded streets, is Gay Pride on the canals of Amsterdam. It‚Äôs famous for its inclusive atmosphere and the colorful boats that will pass you by.\n\nAutumn is a great time to visit Holland and see the beautiful fall colors on the trees. Prices are low this season, most tourists are gone, and nature is at its most beautiful again (after the flower season).\n\nHolland might be known for flat green grasslands with cows and windmills. But the country also has gorgeous forests all around, which become spectacular during the fall season. Put on your hiking boots, bring a warm coat, order a hot chocolate with whipped cream like the Dutch do, and explore Holland as not many visitors do.\n\nWinter is the slowest season of them all. But also, as the Dutch say, ‚Äúgezellig‚Äù (cozy). It might be dark outside, but lights, candles, and holiday decorations are everywhere.\n\nIn December you can visit Christmas fairs and markets at castles, old medieval cities and even in caves. Plus, the famous Christmas markets in Germany are just around the corner. Easily accessible on a day trip.\n\nPrices will be the lowest, and many tourists won‚Äôt visit. If the dark and cold don‚Äôt bother you, this might be the best time to visit. One side note: the two weeks around Christmas are crazy busy in Amsterdam. If you can avoid Christmas/New Year in Amsterdam, do! There are no significant celebrations anyway, then other cities like London are much better.\n\nDrinking water\n\nAmsterdam and the rest of Holland have the best tap water in the world. Quality is so good that you won‚Äôt taste any difference between bottled and tap water. There is no chemical taste like in so many other countries.\n\nIt makes no sense to buy bottled water in the Netherlands. It‚Äôs taxing to the environment and your wallet. Dutch drinking water is safe to drink.\n\nSome restaurants serve tap water for free, but most don‚Äôt. Be prepared to see a charge for water on your bill.\n\nAlso, note the serving size of drinks in general in restaurants in Amsterdam and the rest of Holland are super tiny. On average, 200ml/7 fl. oz. And they are expensive (non-alcoholic beverages like mineral water and soda cost around ‚Ç¨3 per drink), with no free refills either.\n\nDrugs\n\nAmsterdam and Holland have a liberal image when it comes to drugs. But are things as relaxed as they seem? The short answer is no.\n\nUsage and selling of soft drugs, including marihuana, are tolerated and regulated via ‚Äúcoffee shops.‚Äù That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs socially accepted, however.\n\nIt‚Äôs also illegal to smoke in public spaces. In tourist areas, this is not enforced, but elsewhere in the country, it is. There is a significant social stigma about drug usage, including marihuana. It‚Äôs not regarded as something cool by the Dutch. Drug usage, any drug, is usually associated with social problems and low income.\n\nSo why do we tolerate/legalize it? The Dutch have always been pragmatic. By regulating it, you take some of the criminal activity away. Now you can also tax it and provide healthcare. Plus, some of the curiosity disappears. Nowadays, many users are foreign visitors. Everything forbidden tends to be more attractive. Read more about the Dutch here.\n\nDutch Food\n\nOk, our cuisine might not be famous. We get it. Expats often describe it as dull‚Äîmeat, veggies, potatoes, and often, no salt.\n\nMost Dutch will take a wholewheat sandwich with one slice of cheese or ham, nothing else, to work. The Dutch consider their main meals usually as practical. That doesn‚Äôt sound exciting.\n\nThe good news is you can find excellent restaurants with kitchens from all over the world everywhere in Amsterdam and the rest of Holland, from a quick, wholesome tasty meal to Michelin-starred restaurants. You won‚Äôt be deprived of good food here.\n\nDue to its past colonial ties, Indonesian and Surinam cuisines are widely available around Holland. Both kitchens are amazingly flavorful and a must-try when you visit. We also have Dutch food specialties that are worth trying, believe it or not.\n\nI‚Äôve written a post about them. We excel in snacks, candy, pastries, seasonal products, and everything fried. A ‚ÄúBitterbal‚Äù anyone? Read about Dutch Food in my post: ‚ÄúTraditional Dutch Food.‚Äù\n\nElectricity\n\nIn Holland, we use 220-230 volts. If you‚Äôre traveling from a country that uses 110-120 volts like the US or Canada, be aware that not all your devices will work here.\n\nUsually, chargers for personal electronics and shavers can handle both voltages but check the adapter to see if this applies to your appliances.\n\nLook at the image above to know what to look for. Our plugs are round two-prong plugs, with or without grounding. Make sure to buy a travel adapter before you leave home if your plugs look different.\n\nHealthcare\n\nDutch medical care is considered one of the best in the world. You can find well-equipped modern hospitals in all major towns and cities nationwide. Doctors, nurses, dentists, and other healthcare professionals will speak English.\n\nMost medicines are available in Holland. Make sure your (travel) insurance covers the total costs of medical care in Holland, or be prepared to pay upfront if you need treatment.\n\nThe medical system here works differently than in most countries. You can not go directly to the emergency room without a life-threatening emergency. Otherwise, a family doctor must refer you to a specialist if necessary.\n\nOnce you arrive, it‚Äôs important to get information from your accommodation, which family doctor to contact when you need one. Usually, this is included in the information booklet in your accommodation. If not, ask your host or at the reception.\n\nImmigration (Passport, Visa, and ETIAS)\n\nMost visitors from Western countries don‚Äôt need a visa for Holland when visiting as a tourist or for business. A valid passport (valid for at least three months after your intended departure) is enough.\n\nIf you live in the EU, an identity card is even sufficient.\n\nThere is some confusion out there about ETIAS. It stands for European Travel Information and Authorisation System. If you live outside the EU but can travel visa-free, you‚Äôll need to apply for a pre-clearance to go to the EU when ETIAS comes into effect.\n\nThe fee will be ‚Ç¨7, and you can apply online. Once approved, your travel authorization is valid for two years for multiple trips. ETIAS is not yet in effect. It‚Äôs expected to be launched in 2025. It‚Äôs not necessary or possible to apply for it now.\n\nOf course, I‚Äôll update this post when ETIAS comes into effect.\n\nInternet In The Netherlands\n\nInternet access is excellent in Holland. Most restaurants, hotels, and public places offer fast WIFI. If you‚Äôre staying with Dutch friends, they most likely have fast broadband Internet at home.\n\nStill, I advise getting a local sim card with a large data allowance. It‚Äôs much easier than connecting to WIFI networks every time. And you‚Äôll have the Internet everywhere (if not only for Google Maps!).\n\nIt‚Äôs also safer to use your data than public WIFI. Mobile Internet is so fast here that you won‚Äôt notice a difference with the internet speed at home. These high speeds mean you consume a lot more data because even watching Netflix on a mobile network is no problem.\n\nMake sure your data bundle is adequate. I advise about 1 GB for every day you‚Äôre here in Europe. I‚Äôve written a post on the best travel sim card for European travel.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe Dutch speak Dutch (Nederlands). To many foreigners, it sounds German. Please never, ever make the mistake of calling the Dutch language German. Or try to do your best to speak the few German words you know to a Dutch person.\n\nThe German occupation during WWII isn‚Äôt forgotten. Yes, we are friendly with our German neighbors now and welcome them to our beaches every summer, but it‚Äôs a thin layer. Calling a Dutch person German is offensive, no matter how good your intentions are.\n\nIn general, most people in Amsterdam and the rest of the country speak English. Finding your way and asking for advice or help should never be a problem. Most of my US friends say how amazed they are at the level of English here.\n\nDo note that older people don‚Äôt always speak English very well since it wasn‚Äôt taught in school back then. Also note that although the Dutch speak English well, there are still cultural barriers like the Dutch directness. Read our article about the Dutch people to prepare yourself for this :-).\n\nMoney\n\nMoney is always an important topic when you travel. What currency do you need? Can I use an ATM in Holland? How to exchange money, how to tip, et cetera.\n\nRead the answers to these questions in my post about Exchanging Currency in Amsterdam and the rest of The Netherlands.\n\nATM‚Äôs\n\nATMs are widely available. It‚Äôs legislation that ATMs must be available within a certain distance from everyone‚Äôs home to make access to cash available to everybody, even people living remotely and the elderly.\n\nGoogle Maps has an excellent feature for locating the nearest ATM in Holland. Shopping centers and railway stations are always a safe bet to find one. More about ATMs can be read in my post about exchanging currency.\n\nSales Tax\n\nSales Tax or Value Added Tax. In Dutch, we call it BTW. On non-food items, the VAT is 21%, and on food items, 9%.\n\nThe rate is steep, but VAT/BTW is included in all prices. The price you see is the price you pay. This is different than the US, for example, where sales tax is added at the register. That won‚Äôt happen here.\n\nIf you live outside the EU, you might qualify for a tax refund if you take the goods out of the country. Participating stores have a VAT refund sticker on the shop windows and near the register.\n\nWhen you qualify, ask for a form at the cash register, get a customs stamp at the airport and claim your refund there. After fees, you get around 15% of the purchase amount back. In general, only large department stores and tourist shops/areas offer this service. Regular stores rarely do.\n\nTipping\n\nTipping in Holland is different than, for example, in the US. It‚Äôs not mandatory or expected. Salaries here are higher than elsewhere. Still, the Dutch do tip. It‚Äôs considered rude if you receive excellent service but do not give a tip.\n\nHowever, there isn‚Äôt a fixed percentage that is expected. It‚Äôs customary to tip a few euros to round up the bill. Usually, between 5 and 10% of the total amount, where 10% is considered an excellent tip.\n\nIf service is extraordinary, you can, of course, tip accordingly. But don‚Äôt tip as you would at home. That is often not expected or necessary. Tipping is expected in restaurants, private tours, and taxis. Not at many other places.\n\nPaying To Use The Toilet\n\nWhen you‚Äôre used to free public toilet access at home, you‚Äôre in for a surprise. In Holland, using one can cost between ‚Ç¨0,50 and ‚Ç¨1. This applies to malls, train stations, and fast-food restaurants like the Golden M.\n\nHave some coins ready for these minor emergencies. Tip: your best bet for a free-of-charge toilet is at table service restaurants and museums.\n\nMuseum Reservations\n\nThe most well-known museums now often require a reservation with a time slot. This included the Anne Frank House, the Rijksmuseum, and the Van Gogh Museum. All three likely sell-out, sometimes weeks (or months), in advance‚Äîespecially the Anne Frank House. But also, the Van Gogh can sell out weeks in advance.\n\nAvoid disappointment and make your reservations on time.\n\nOpening hours\n\nOpening hours vary from business to business. As a general rule of thumb, most shops open during office hours on Monday ‚Äì Saturday. One night a week (Thursday or Friday), shops are open until 9 p.m.\n\nThis varies per city and even per suburb. In smaller towns, shops are usually closed on Monday (mornings.)\n\nSupermarkets are usually open from 8 a.m. ‚Äì 9 p.m. or 10 p.m. Most supermarkets are open on Sunday, but every city has its own rules about this, and opening hours vary. Your safest bet is to go during the afternoon on a Sunday.\n\nSome cities have Sunday opening hours for all stores, not just supermarkets, every Sunday. This is most often the case in larger cities.\n\nOther cities allow stores to open just once a month, while others forbid their shops to open on Sundays.\n\nReasons for limited opening can be different. Sometimes it‚Äôs to protect worker from having to be constantly available, but most often, the reason is religious. If a city or town has a more conservative local government, stores will be closed.\n\nMuseums and restaurants are usually closed on Mondays. The exception is Amsterdam, where many museums are open seven days a week.\n\nAnd remember that kitchens in restaurants often close at 10 p.m. In smaller towns, as early as 9 p.m. The Dutch eat early. The most popular times for a reservation are between 6 and 7 p.m.\n\nPeople\n\nI would say we Dutch are a friendly bunch. However, our reputation in the world doesn‚Äôt always match that. We‚Äôre known to be direct (sometimes offensive), our language sounds harsh to foreign ears, and some might say we‚Äôre cold. And yes, aren‚Äôt we those people legalizing prostitution and soft drugs? Ai, that almost hurt.\n\nThankfully most of it comes down to cultural misunderstandings. Our language sounds harder because it‚Äôs a Germanic language, and we have that hard G sound. I can guarantee you, most of the time, a conversation is friendly and polite except maybe during rush hour in traffic or when a tourist walks into the bike lane.\n\nBut believe me, that sounds very different. We are direct, yes. Get used to it. See, I‚Äôm direct too. But seriously, if you prepare yourself for it, it‚Äôs less hostile and liberating to know what the other person thinks, with no hidden agendas.\n\nIt works the other way around too. If a Dutch person tells you they like you, they genuinely do.\n\nAnd about those moral laws like drugs and red lights? Rest assured. The Dutch don‚Äôt appreciate or think either activity is socially accepted.\n\nWhy is it legalized? The Dutch are pragmatic. If you can‚Äôt stop it, control it. The Dutch don‚Äôt like to preach morally (outside the bible belt, that is).\n\nRead more about the Dutch people in this article here.\n\nPhone\n\nHolland has one of the best mobile phone networks in the world. The coverage is extensive, also in the countryside, in small villages, on the islands, and on beaches.\n\nLocal prepaid sim cards are available, but not easy for visitors to register. The better, cheaper, and easier option is to get a sim card for Europe with affordable bundles. Read our post for the best tourist SIM Cards in the Netherlands and Europe here.\n\nNote because mobile coverage is this good, traditional ways to make a phone call are almost non-existent. Public phone booths are a thing of the past. Even emergency booths along the motorway are gone.\n\nPostal Services in Holland\n\nPost offices do not exist anymore in Holland. Today they‚Äôre called PostNL service points and are often located in shops, primarily inside books and magazine stores like Bruna or Primera. It‚Äôs just a desk. You can buy stamps at PostNL points and send letters and parcels from there. Use this link to search your nearest location.\n\nYou can also buy stamps at supermarkets like Albert Heijn. Use outdoor Orange mailboxes to post your postcards. They have two slots. Unless you have a local zipcode you‚Äôre sending to, use the ‚ÄúOverige Bestemmingen‚Äù slot for everything further away and international mail.\n\nLike every country, Holland has its own specific public holidays, significant dates, and school holidays. Holland doesn‚Äôt tend to have as many public holidays as many other countries do. But we have specific days like Kings Day (April 27th).\n\nAnd we add 2nd days to holidays like Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas. In Holland, we use three ‚Äúzones‚Äù for school holidays to spread the number of people going on holiday at once. This system extends the periods the Dutch have their school holidays. Thus prices are higher for longer. For all these dates, please check out my post on Dutch Holidays.\n\nPublic Transportation\n\nIn Holland, you‚Äôll find excellent transit systems all around the country. The main backbone of public transport is the train system, connecting every corner of the country with high-frequency scheduled departures in every direction.\n\nFrom the train station, towns and villages are connected by local buses. Or the Dutch rent a bike for the last few miles if needed. In large cities, you‚Äôll find an extensive system of buses, trams, metro, and sometimes even ferries. Amsterdam and Rotterdam have them all.\n\nDownload the NS App on your phone. It‚Äôs available in English. You can use it for planning your journey and buying your tickets. The app accepts credit cards (that most machines do not), and you avoid the ‚Ç¨1 surcharge for paper tickets.\n\nResponsible travel\n\nIn today‚Äôs day and age, thinking about your environmental impact is essential when you travel. You can do many small things to make your travel less taxing on the environment.\n\nChoose an airline using modern airplanes that emit much less than older aircraft. Even better is choosing an airline where you can offset your Co2 emission. KLM is an airline that gives you that option when you book your flight.\n\nWithin Europe, travel by train when it‚Äôs convenient. Between Amsterdam and Brussels, Frankfurt, Paris, and London, it‚Äôs easy to take a high-speed train, often just as fast or faster as a plane ride. You can check fares and travel times here. Locally, use a bike or public transport to avoid the gas emission of a taxi or Uber.\n\nLeave No Trace behind\n\nLeave no trace behind is global advice. When people travel, they tend to be more careless about waste than at home. Please don‚Äôt be one of them and use trashcans when you‚Äôre here. They‚Äôre everywhere.\n\nIn nature, take your empty bottles, wrappers, and other waste with you until you see a trashcan and throw it away. It‚Äôs a small effort with a significant impact.\n\nOver-Tourism\n\nYou may have heard some places and cities worldwide suffer from over-tourism. Amsterdam is one of these cities. If you‚Äôre mindful of this topic, you can make better choices: Use local companies like us for your tours.\n\nGo off the beaten track a bit more. Explore neighborhoods outside the city center, and go to other cities and towns so that not all visitors are concentrated in a tiny area.\n\nAlso, avoid booking general group tours through travel agents and cruise liners. The money will not stay locally, and the quality is usually subpar.\n\nPlastic\n\nThe most important thing to know is that plastic bags are not free of charge in Europe. Legislation requires businesses to charge for plastic bags. This is to encourage people to bring their own bags. And it works. Since this legislation is in place, the one-time use of plastic bags is marginalized.\n\nRecycling\n\nThe Dutch are very much into recycling. We separate glass, paper, plastic, metal, and organic waste in our homes from our regular trash.\n\nWhen you see opportunities to separate your waste and recycle, please do. It‚Äôs a small effort, but again, significant consequences.\n\nPaper and plastic are now often collected separately in public spaces, including trains, railway stations, and fast-food restaurants. Note that if you buy drinks in a bottle or can, you pay a deposit (in Dutch, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúStatiegeld‚Äù).\n\nReturn these items to any supermarket when empty for a refund of that deposit (look for the return machines inside stores).\n\nSupport local\n\nDid you know when you book tours with large global companies, their subcontractors get only pennies on the dollars you spend? Plus, the quality of these tours is substandard at best.\n\nExpect to be taken to tourist shops and inferior restaurants and spend little time at the main attraction. Instead, look for local tours and companies recommended by independent sources that are often not by your cruise ship information desk.\n\nMost tourist attractions can be easily accessed without needing a tour operator. Blogs like these are great for inspiration and direction. A tour can be worthwhile if you want more background information or to go to difficult-to-reach places.\n\nJust make sure to book local and ask about what is part of the trip. Do they take you to a tourist shop, for example? (then keep looking for another tour) Is the tour recommended by a local? On my blog, you‚Äôll only find links to tours I 100% endorse, and I only work with companies taking reasonable commissions.\n\nYou can opt for a private tour. You can book me as one. I love to take visitors inside the country. But also to show the best side of Amsterdam, including, for example, a food tour or a Rijksmuseum highlight tour. The great thing about private tours is that they can be customized to your preferences.\n\nSafety\n\nDisclaimer: I am not an expert on security, crime, or terrorism. Please always follow the advice from (local) authorities first.\n\nWhat I say below is my honest but personal opinion from a local perspective.\n\nCrime in general in the Netherlands is lower than in most developed countries. Due to strict weapon laws, murders are still rare. If they happen, it‚Äôs usually outside the public eye and within criminal organizations.\n\nAlso, due to a high standard of living and the Dutch value system, there is less division between income groups. Because of that, crime rates are lower. Your biggest concern should be pickpockets and bike theft. You should have a worry-free holiday if you‚Äôre mindful of your belongings, especially in busy and touristy areas. Make sure to lock your bike!\n\nScams\n\nCriminal scams can happen anywhere, including in tourist places like Amsterdam. Always be vigilant.\n\nOne annoying scam for a while (not as present today as before) where fake police officers. They are dressed as legit-looking cops, but they‚Äôre not.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nAsk them to speak Dutch. A fake cop is usually a criminal from Eastern Europe and can‚Äôt speak Dutch (familiarize yourself with the accent when you get here)\n\nAsk for their ID. Police officers should always identify themselves when asked.\n\nLook for an official vehicle like a police car, bicycle, motorcycle, or horse nearby, marked blue, red, and white. The correct uniform is black/yellow.\n\nIt‚Äôs a red flag if they ask for your wallet to investigate fake money. Regular police would never do that.\n\nDraw attention to yourself, and yell for help if the person asks for your wallet.\n\nEmergency Numbers in Holland\n\nIf you have an emergency (police, fire services, and ambulance), call 112. This is the European version of 911 in North America.\n\nUse 112 only in a life-threatening emergency, not if your wallet is lost.\n\nFor that, you can call the police at 0900-8844. That number is for non-life-threatening emergencies.\n\nEvents\n\nThe safety standards for events are incredibly high. At events, there are always first-aid assistants available. There will be security and, with significant events, police presence too. Often bags are inspected, and exits are always clearly marked.\n\nThe use and possession of drugs are forbidden within the closed events areas (including soft drugs). These will be confiscated. At more significant events, there is a zero-tolerance policy (also for bringing your own alcohol.). If a person is aggressive, he or she will be arrested and often brought in front of a judge within 24 hours.\n\nFines\n\nIf you are an EU citizen, fines are often sent directly to your home address. They‚Äôre collected by your local authority if there is an agreement between your country and Holland. Not paying has the same consequences as at home.\n\nIf you are from outside the EU or your country does not have an agreement with Holland, you must pay fines before you leave the country, often immediately, but if not, you will be stopped at the border. Fines are high in Holland. You will get them for the usual offenses. But also for things you might not expect, like :\n\nTouching your phone while operating a bicycle\n\nUsing your phone in a car while driving\n\nParking a vehicle where forbidden\n\nPeeing on the street. Yes, gents, hold your urge even after a few beers, do not pee in the canal\n\nHaving no official ID on you (always take your passport, a copy won‚Äôt suffice, and neither will your driver‚Äôs license if it‚Äôs from outside the EU)\n\nEven for things listed above, the costs go quickly in the three-digit range. The canal can suddenly become a costly toilet.\n\nLGBTQ travelers\n\nThe Netherlands is known for its liberal attitude towards the LGBTQ community. But things never are as they seem to be at first glance. Primarily, due to large influxes of migrants from traditional countries (from the Middle East, North Africa, and Eastern Europe), hostilities do increase.\n\nMore and more, you hear about threats or abuse (both physically and mentally) towards openly LGBTQ persons on the street, even in Amsterdam.\n\nIt‚Äôs one of the most upsetting things to me. I am all for immigration when people are fleeing danger and looking for safety. But then why be disrespectful of your new host country and its customs? And bring others in danger? It was voluntary to come specifically here. It‚Äôs mind-boggling to me. But unfortunately, it‚Äôs reality.\n\nMy advice is this: you‚Äôre safe inside any establishment, whether geared specifically towards LGBTQ people or for the general public. On the street, be more mindful of your surroundings. Keep public affection to a minimum, especially if youth groups are around.\n\nDon‚Äôt think you can walk hand in hand just because at home you can‚Äôt, and here you‚Äôre free. It‚Äôs not always like that, and it hurts me to say that.\n\nOne of the great things is that the police are always your friend! Remember this.\n\nEven if you go on a wrong date, the police will not judge you and will always help you. LGBTQ issues are part of their training. So never feel shame or fear reporting an LGBTQ-related issue to the police.\n\nTerrorism\n\nTerrorism is a tricky subject. I wish I could say Holland is safe from terrorism. Unfortunately, we live in a world where there is no such thing as a safe place. Holland has not had any significant incidents, but we came close.\n\nStill, the chance of personally becoming a victim of an act of terrorism is minimal, even if you visit a hotspot like London, Paris, or New York. So why limit yourself to seeing the world?\n\nEverybody has to make their own safety assessment. But I believe it shouldn‚Äôt stop you from living and exploring.\n\nBeing as fearful as many of us became doesn‚Äôt match the statistics. Traffic or DIY projects at home are far more dangerous. Still, we do these activities without a second thought.\n\nWhat can you do to minimize the chance of being involved in an incident?\n\nKnow your exit when a need to evacuate arises, and be prepared.\n\nBe mindful of your surroundings. When you see odd behavior, report it. Call 112 if you feel unsafe.\n\nWhen you see an unattended bag, move away from it and call 112 immediately.\n\nTrust your instincts when you don‚Äôt feel safe, move away\n\nRead your country‚Äôs official travel advice.\n\nRegarding the last piece of advice, be aware these sometimes can be overly cautious and sometimes even politically motivated, so they‚Äôre not always as helpful as they could be.\n\nSolo Female Travelers\n\nAs two men, we‚Äôre not the expert on solo female travel. Thankfully, others are experts on the topic. Karen, a fantastic blogger from WanderlustingK, is a traveler-turned-local. She wrote a comprehensive post about solo female travel in Amsterdam and the rest of Holland.\n\nBut here is some general advice: Amsterdam and the rest of Holland are safe places to travel to for women. Of course, things do happen like anywhere else. Still, Holland is one of the safer destinations for solo female travelers.\n\nDutch women themselves are very independent. There is also a lot of security, cameras, and police presence, especially in big cities.\n\nThe Dutch tend to be a bit shy compared to other cultures. It‚Äôs not typical for a Dutch guy to approach a girl directly.\n\nA few things to watch out for: use extra care in the red light district (everybody should, men and women). When you go out for a drink, always watch your drink. If you are harassed (most commonly by minority youths), just ignore them, and you‚Äôre fine. When you feel in real danger, always call 112 immediately.\n\nTimezone\n\nHolland is in the GMT+1 timezone (CET), and we observe daylight saving time. That means, in general, when it‚Äôs noon in New York City, it‚Äôs 6 p.m. in Holland. When it‚Äôs noon in London, it‚Äôs 1 p.m. in Holland. And when it‚Äôs noon in Australia, it‚Äôs 2 a.m. in Holland.\n\nI said in general because the dates of switching to daylight saving times differ worldwide. North America, for example, is usually one week behind. In that timeframe, the time difference can be larger or smaller.\n\nIn Holland (and the rest of Europe), we switch the clocks on the last Sunday in March and the last Sunday in October. Our best tip: when in doubt, ask Google what time it is in Holland and your home country.\n\nWeights and Measurements\n\nIn Holland, we use the metric system. Meters, liters, and kilos and not feet, ounces, and pounds like countries that use the Imperial System.\n\nSome of the most frequent conversions are:\n\nOne mile = 1.609 kilometers\n\nOne gallon = 4.546 liters\n\nOne pound = 0.453 kilos or 453 grams\n\nThe easiest thing to do is to use Google for conversions on the fly. If you need mobile data during your visit, check out my post about this topic.\n\nWeather and Climate\n\nThe weather in Holland. Ahh, our favorite conversational topic of them all. Our climate is considered mild. Due to its proximity to the sea, it‚Äôs not too cold or hot. We have four distinct seasons.\n\nBut climate change is changing that a bit. It hardly freezes long enough anymore to ice skate in wintertime, and summers are now often tropical. What still holds true is that the weather here is unpredictable.\n\nYou should always expect a range of temperatures. And rain is always around the corner. It didn‚Äôt get this green here from the sun. Pack accordingly. If you‚Äôre annoyed by the weather, know you‚Äôre in good company, and you‚Äôll have the perfect conversation starter to connect with a local."
