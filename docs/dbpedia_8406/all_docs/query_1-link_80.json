It is also called the past perfect progressive tense since it refers to an action that had been progressing until a certain point in the past. Now, have a look at the different definitions of the past perfect continuous tense provided by various dictionaries.\n\nDefinition of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense\n\nThe past perfect continuous tense, according to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, is defined as a tense form used to indicate “an action or a situation that continued for a period of time before another action or situation in the past.” According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the past perfect continuous tense is defined as a tense that refers to “actions or events which started before a particular time in the past and were still in progress up to that time in the past.”\n\nFormula and Structure of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense\n\nUnderstanding the formula of the past perfect continuous tense can help you and make everything easy. Given below is the formula that you can employ when you write a sentence using the past perfect continuous tense.\n\nSubject + had + been + present participle (verb+ing) + the rest of the sentence\n\nNow, take a look at how sentences are structured in a positive, negative, interrogative and a negative interrogative sentence using the past perfect continuous tense.\n\nStructure of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense Positive Negative Interrogative Negative Interrogative Subject + had + been + present participle + the rest of the sentence Subject + had + not + been + present participle + the rest of the sentence Had + subject + been + present participle + the rest of the sentence Had + subject + not + been + present participle + the rest of the sentence\n\n(or)\n\nHadn’t + subject + been + present participle + the rest of the sentence\n\nExamples:\n\nI had been cooking my mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou had been cooking your mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nHe had been cooking his mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nShe had been cooking her mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nThey had been cooking their mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nExamples:\n\nI had not been cooking my mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nYou had not been cooking your mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nHe had not been cooking his mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nShe had not been cooking her mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nThey had not been cooking their mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen.\n\nExamples:\n\nHad I been cooking my mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad you been cooking your mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad he been cooking his mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad she been cooking her mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad they been cooking their mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nExamples:\n\nHadn’t I been cooking my mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHadn’t you been cooking your mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHadn’t he been cooking his mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHadn’t she been cooking her mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHadn’t they been cooking their mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad you not been cooking your mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad she not been cooking her mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad he not been cooking his mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nHad they not been cooking their mom’s favourite dish when she walked into the kitchen?\n\nRules to be Followed when Using the Past Perfect Continuous Tense\n\nSimilar to the present perfect continuous tense, the past perfect continuous tense also consists of two helping verbs and a main verb. Among the three verbs that represent the tense, the first helping verb should always be ‘had’ followed by ‘been’, which is in turn followed by the present participle of the main verb. This rule holds true when the sentence is a positive sentence. In case you are employing the tense form in an interrogative sentence, the helping verb ‘had’ comes first followed by the subject which is in turn followed by the the helping verb ‘been’ and the present participle of the main verb.\n\nFor a negative sentence, ‘not’ is placed after the first auxiliary verb ‘had’ and for a negative interrogative sentence, you can either use the contraction ‘hadn’t’ or place ‘not’ after the subject.\n\nUses of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense\n\nThe past perfect continuous tense is used to perform two main functions. They are:\n\nTo denote an action that has been the cause of another action or event in the past.\n\nTo represent an action that started at some point in the past and continued or progressed till a particular time in the recent past.\n\nExamples of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense\n\nNow, let us look at a few examples to see how the past perfect continuous tense is used to perform the different functions.\n\nDenoting an action that is the cause of another action in the past\n\nAsha was completely exhausted as she had been travelling continuously for three days.\n\nGeorge was angry because he had been waiting for them the whole day.\n\nRepresenting an action that progressed in the past until another action in the past\n\nDo you know for how long Anitha had been working at the college before she moved to Pollachi?\n\nI had been waiting to hear from the admissions officer for more than a month before I applied to other colleges.\n\nTest Your Understanding of the Past Perfect Continuous Tense\n\nFill in the blanks with the right form of the tense in the following sentences:\n\n1. Derrick __________ (work) at the hospital for over two years before he left for Spain.\n\n2. I don’t think the place ____________ (function) well for a very long time before it shut down.\n\n3.
