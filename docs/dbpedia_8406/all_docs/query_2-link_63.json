        "text": "There are two changes due to come into effect which will affect travel in and out of the European Union for non-EU citizens such as Brits, Americans, Australians and Canadians. Here's how EES and ETIAS will affect you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause Brussels loves jargon both of these are known by acronyms - EES and ETIAS - they are two separate systems but they are both scheduled to come into effect over the next two years.\n\nHere's what they will change;\n\n1: EES - Entry/Exit System\n\nThis doesn't change anything in terms of the visas or documents required for travel, or the rights of travellers, but it does change how the EU's and Schengen area's external borders are policed.\n\nIt's essentially a security upgrade, replacing the current system that relies on border guards with stamps with an electronic swipe in/swipe out system that will register more details such as immigration status.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen - the start date has been pushed back several times, with the latest timetable for the introduction \"between quarter three and quarter four of 2024\" - in other words, once the Paris Olympics and Paralympics have finished.\n\nReporting in the UK media suggests Sunday, October 6th 2024 as the launch date, although this has not been confirmed by the European Commission. France's interior ministry says that the start date is \"envisaged between the end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025\".\n\nWhere - this is for the EU and Schengen area's external borders, so doesn't apply if you are travelling between France and Germany for example, but would apply if you enter any EU or Schengen zone country from a non-EU country eg crossing from the UK to France via Channel Tunnel or flying into Germany from the US.\n\nWhat - Travellers will need to scan their passports or other travel document at an automated kiosk each time they cross an EU external border. It will not apply to foreign residents of EU countries or those with long stay visas.\n\nWhen non-EU travellers first enter the Schengen/EU area the system will register their name, biometric data, and the date and place of entry and exit. Facial scans and fingerprint data will be taken and retained for three years after initial registration.\n\nMany airports of course already have biometric passport scanners but they're only checking that your passport is valid and the photo matches your face.\n\nThe EES system also calculates how long you can stay within the EU, based on your rights of residency or your 90-day allowance, and also checks whether your passport has ever been flagged for immigration offences such as overstaying a visa.\n\nWho - this is for non-EU nationals who are entering the EU as a visitor (rather than residents). The system scans your passport and will tell you how long you can stay for (based on the 90-allowance or the visa linked to the passport).\n\nWhat about residents? Non EU nationals who live in an EU country and have a national residency card such as a carte de séjour in France or a TIE in Spain are not affected by this, since they have the right to unlimited stays within their country of residence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe asked the European Commission how the system works for residents and were told: \"The Entry/Exit System will not apply to non-EU citizens holding a residence document or a residence permit. Their personal data will not be registered in the Entry/Exit System.\n\n\"It is enough if holders of such documents present them to the border guards to prove their status.\"\n\nThe Commission later clarified that non-EU citizens who are resident in an EU country should not use eGates or automatic scanners, but should instead head to the queue with an in-person guard (if available) where they can show both their passport and residency document.\n\nHowever there's no suggestion those with permanent residency will lose their right of residency if they do go through the automatic gates when entering the EU because their residency status is guaranteed - as long as they can prove it with their permit. Although they could face the inconvenience of a few extra questions next time they travel.\n\nWhat does this actually change?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApart from a more high-tech process at the border (and potentially big queues in Dover) there are likely to be two main effects of this.\n\nFor non-EU nationals who have residency in an EU country it could mean the end of the rather inconsistent process of passport stamping, which has been a particular issue for Brits since Brexit, with wildly inconsistent official practices by border guards that have frustrated many British residents of the EU and left them with incorrect stamps in their passports.\n\nFor visitors to the EU this tightens up application of the 90-day rule. It doesn't change the rule itself, but means that anyone attempting to over-stay or 'play' the system will instantly be spotted.\n\nThe European Commission's other stated aim is security, making it easier to spot security risks at the border.\n\nWill there be delays for non-EU travellers?\n\nSeveral EU countries have raised fears about this, with the UK-France border a likely pressure point due to large numbers of travellers and limited processing space at ports like Dover, while budget airline Ryanair has also raised concerns about the implementation.\n\nPart of the reason for the delayed start date is to iron out potential problems. You can read the full report about fears over potential delays here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2: ETIAS - European Travel Information and Authorisation System\n\nWho - If you live permanently in an EU country this does not affect you, neither does it affect people entering the EU with a visa (including a Schengen visa). It affects non-EU citizens who previously travelled visa free under the 90 days.\n\nIt therefore covers tourists, second-home owners, those on family visits or doing short-term work from countries including the UK, USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nWhen - As with EES, this has also been postponed several times, it's entry is now scheduled for \"quarter one to quarter two of 2025\".\n\nWhat changes - Citizens of many non-EU countries including the UK, the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand can spend up to 90 days in every 180 in the EU or Schengen zone without needing a visa - the so-called '90 day rule'.\n\nThis is set to change - people are still entitled to spend up to 90 days in every 180, but the process will no-longer be completely admin free.\n\nInstead, travellers will have to fill out an online application before they travel.\n\nOnce issued, the authorisation lasts for three years, so frequent travellers do not need to complete a new application every time but it must be renewed every three years.\n\nFor anyone who has travelled to the USA recently, the system is essentially similar to the ESTA visa required for short stays.\n\nHow much - Each application costs €7, but is free for under 18s and over 70s.\n\nHow - The application process is entirely online. The European Commission says that applications should be processed within minutes, but advises travellers to apply 72 hours in advance in case of delays.\n\nWhat about residents?\n\nThis does not apply to residents, so they will not need to complete the online process before travel. Instead, they will show their passport and residency document at the border, just as they do now.\n\nWhat does this change?\n\nThis is technically a visa-waiver rather than a visa, but it basically spells the end of paperwork-free travel into the EU for many groups.\n\nFor tourists and visitors to the EU it's a big change, meaning that pre-holiday tasks will now include the online visa for all members of the group, in addition to booking a hotel/flights etc.\n\nThe process itself sounds fairly simple - and each visa lasts for three years so regular travellers won't need to do this every time - but it seems likely that the message of what is now required won't filter through to many holidaymakers, leading to confusing scenes at the border."
