In this article, you will learn all about the active and passive voice, what it means, its definition and usage. Along with the difference between the two voices and examples given in the article, you will be able to understand and use the active voice and passive voice accurately and effectively.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n‘Voice’ – What Is It?\n\nThe Two Voices in the English Language\n\nWhat is the Active Voice? – Meaning and Definition\n\nWhat is the Passive Voice? – Meaning and Definition\n\nUsing the Active Voice and the Passive Voice – Points to Remember\n\nDifference between the Active Voice and the Passive Voice\n\nRules to be Followed When Converting the Active Voice to the Passive Voice\n\nExamples of the Active and Passive Voice\n\nCheck Your Understanding of the Active Voice and the Passive Voice\n\nFrequently Asked Questions on the Active Voice and the Passive Voice\n\n‘Voice’ – What Is It?\n\nThe term ‘voice’ is a term that is used to denote the form of the verb which shows if the subject in a given sentence is the doer or receiver of the action. The voice of a verb describes the relationship between the action and the participants (subject or object) in a sentence.\n\nThe Two Voices in the English Language\n\nThere are two voices in the English language and they are as follows:\n\nActive Voice\n\nPassive Voice\n\nLet us look into the two voices a little in detail with the help of the meaning and definition given below.\n\nWhat is the Active Voice? – Meaning and Definition\n\nThe active voice, in a sentence, denotes that the noun or pronoun that acts as the subject in the sentence is the doer of the action. In other words, the subject performs the action or acts upon the verb.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, the active voice is defined as “the form of a verb in which the subject is the person or thing that performs the action”, and according to the Collins Dictionary, the active voice is defined as “a voice of verbs used to indicate that the subject of a sentence is performing the action or causing the event or process described by the verb.”\n\nWhat is the Passive Voice? – Meaning and Definition\n\nThe passive voice, on the other hand, represents that the subject is one acted upon by the action or verb in the sentence. It can also be said that the passive voice indicates that the subject in the sentence is no longer active but passive.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Learner’s Dictionary, the passive voice is defined as “the form of a verb used when the subject is affected by the action of the verb”, and according to the Collins Dictionary, the passive voice is “formed using ‘be’ and the past participle of a verb. The subject of a passive clause does not perform the action expressed by the verb but is affected by it.”\n\nUsing the Active Voice and the Passive Voice – Points to Remember\n\nThere are a few points that you have to bear in mind when using the active voice and the passive voice. In the English language, the active voice is used generally as they give the information in a direct and clear manner. Make sure you do not use the passive voice just because you think it sounds better. Use it only if it is necessary. Remember that the active voice has the subject doing the action and the passive voice has the subject receiving the action. If you want to communicate your thoughts and ideas clearly and effectively, especially in a professional setup, it would be best to use the active voice.\n\nA pro tip for you to master the active voice and the passive voice is to know the structure and formula by which they work.\n\nActive Voice – Subject + Verb + Object\n\nPassive Voice – Object + Verb + Subject\n\nDifference between the Active Voice and the Passive Voice\n\nAnalysing the difference between the active voice and the passive voice is what will help you in a much better way to learn how to use the two voices effectively. Take a look at the following table to know how they differ.\n\nActive Voice\n\nPassive Voice\n\nDenotes that the subject is performing the action.\n\nDenotes that the subject is acted upon by the verb or action in the sentence.\n\nThe active voice does not require a linking verb to make sense.\n\nThe passive voice uses a linking verb followed by the past participle of the main verb.\n\nThe active voice focuses on the doer of the action.\n\nThe passive voice comes in handy when the doer of the action is undetermined.\n\nHas a direct, clear and strong tone.\n\nHas an indirect, weak and subtle tone.\n\nExamples:\n\nI decorated the hall.\n\nDevi gave Shanthi a gift.\n\nExamples:\n\nThe hall was decorated by me.\n\nShanthi was given a gift by Devi.\n\nRules to be Followed When Converting the Active Voice to the Passive Voice\n\nWhen converting the active voice into the passive voice or vice versa, there are changes in the tenses and pronouns used in the sentences.\n\nThe table given below shows you how the tenses change when converting the active voice to the passive voice and vice versa.\n\nChange of Pronouns\n\nActive Voice\n\nPassive Voice\n\nI\n\nMe\n\nWe\n\nUs\n\nHe\n\nHim\n\nShe\n\nHer\n\nThey\n\nThem\n\nIt\n\nIt\n\nThere are a few other points that you have to know so that you can use the two voices effectively. They are as follows:\n\nWhen converting a sentence in the active voice to the passive voice, the first thing that you have to do is interchange the subject and the object.\n\nThe next part of speech you have to focus on is the verb. When converting the active voice into the passive voice, you just have to convert the main verb into its past participle or its third form. The third form of the main verb is the past participle form of the verb.\n\nWhen you are changing the tense of the main verb, make sure you use an auxiliary verb which maintains the tense the sentence represents.\n\nAlways use the preposition, ‘by’ before the subject in a passive sentence.\n\nIf there are any adverbs used in the sentence with the active voice, be sure to include it in the passive voice as well. Do not just drop it when you convert a sentence in the active voice to the passive voice or vice-versa.\n\nExamples of the Active and Passive Voice\n\nGiven below are a few examples of how to convert the active voice into the passive voice.\n\nActive Voice – Twinkle likes adventure stories.\n\nPassive Voice – Adventure stories are liked by Twinkle.\n\nActive Voice – Latha is learning French this year.\n\nPassive Voice – French is being learnt by Latha this year.\n\nActive Voice – Kurt has brought macaroons.\n\nPassive Voice – Macaroons have been brought by Kurt.\n\nActive Voice – Sidharth played cricket.\n\nPassive Voice – Cricket was played by Sidharth.\n\nActive Voice – They were making invitation cards.\n\nPassive Voice – Invitation cards were being made by them.\n\nActive Voice – Becky had packed the bags.\n\nPassive Voice – The bags had been packed by Becky.\n\nActive Voice – Mira will buy the refreshments for the party.\n\nPassive Voice – The refreshments for the party will be bought by Mira.\n\nActive Voice – Sanjay will have given the forms to all the participants.\n\nPassive Voice – The forms will have been given to all the participants by Sanjay.\n\nCheck Your Understanding of the Active Voice and the Passive Voice\n\nNow that you have seen a number of examples and learnt how the conversion is done, try converting the following sentences as directed.\n\n1.
