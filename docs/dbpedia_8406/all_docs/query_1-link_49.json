        "text": "It is our pleasure to inform you that the EUROSTUDENT 8 Final Conference is scheduled to be held from the 10th to 11th of July in Vienna, Austria. The event will take place at Vienna University of Economics and Business. The conference is planned for two days full of presentations of the latest EUROSTUDENT data, other research results, and discussions. Please save the dates and mind the Call for Papers! More detailed information about the conference will follow soon. We are already looking forward to welcome you in Vienna.\n\nCall for Papers\n\nConference website\n\nAt the EUROSTUDENT Talks on the 13th of June, we turned our eyes to discrimination in the context of higher education. How prevalent are discrimination experiences among students and how do they vary across countries? Who are students discriminated by? Based on which criteria do students feel discriminated? Cordelia Menz from the Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS), Vienna, shed light on these and some other questions from an international comparative perspective. In addition, we took a look at Sweden to discuss the same issues at country level. Erica Finnerman, Jari Rusanen, and Sofia Scholler from the Swedish Council for Higher Education told us about discrimination and national minorities in the Swedish context and introduced the topics of mid-life students and mental health.\n\nShow details\n\nIt is time to start revealing EUROSTUDENT 8 international results! We got the ball rolling with the Topical module reports and the first ones were introduced already at the EUROSTUDENT Talks on the 8th of May. How are countries doing when it comes to digitalisation of teaching, learning, and student life? How did COVID-19 pandemic impact students in European higher education? Hendrik Schirmer from the German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW) and Elisabeth Kendrali and Sandra Haugas from the Think Tank Praxis introduced these two rather intertwined topics to us.\n\nShow details\n\nIn view of the relatively low participation of refugees in tertiary education, debates about targeted support services have increased significantly in recent years. Based on the survey and qualitative interview data, Jana Berg and Michael Grüttner from The German Centre for Higher Education Research and Science Studies (DZHW) discussed factors of successful study preparation and the situation of refugees studying at German universities. They looked at individual, institutional, and structural factors that shape the experiences of refugees in preparing for and studying at university.\n\nShow details\n\nPaid work alongside studies gives students important experience on the labour market and provides an additional income source. In Norway, it is quite common for students to work alongside their studies, but analyses based on EUROSTUDENT VI data indicate that there is a trade-off between time spent on paid work and time spent on study-related activities. At the EUROSTUDENT Talks, Anna-Lena Keute from Statistics Norway gave an overview of the situation of working students in Norway in 2022. How much time do different groups of students in Norway spent on study-related activities and paid work? And how many hours can Norwegian students work without spending less time on their studies compared to non-working students? What is the optimal balance between paid work and time spent on studies?\n\nShow details\n\nLucie Hündlová and Michaela Šmídová, both from the Centre for Higher Education Studies (CHES) in Prague, introduced us to the main findings of the 8th round of the EUROSTUDENT survey in the Czech Republic. Firstly, the focus was on the trends that have remained more or less stable over time (i.e., entry to study, low level of public support, high proportion of working students). Secondly, Lucie and Michaela presented to us trends which, on the contrary, have undergone shifts and changes compared to the last round (i.e., higher proportion of students with financial and health problems). The results of the survey were discussed in the context of the current situation in higher education policy. Among other things, the presentation touched on several methodological and other challenges that were encountered during the preparation, implementation, and communication of the results.\n\nShow details\n\nAt this webinar, you got an insight into the data on students’ employment experiences and their financial conditions in Georgia. Based on fresh results from the EUROSTUDENT 8 survey, Ana Papiashvili from the Institute of Social Studies and Analysis delved into students' employment experiences during the current semester, emphasizing the significance they attribute to having paid employment and the needs it helps fulfil. Considering the challenge of aligning employment with their chosen profession, the presentation explored how closely students' work aligns with the content of their study program. Additionally, the presentation provided insights into students' financial situation, highlighting the contributions of various social groups to their incomes and expenses. It touched upon broader financial concerns, including savings and other financial issues. In essence, the presentation comprehensively addressed students' employment experiences and their present financial circumstances, encompassing both personal resources and external financial support.\n\nShow details\n\nIt has become almost a tradition that the last EUROSTUDENT Talks of the year gives us the chance to get a valuable insight into student life. And of course, we did it this year, too! In the discussion, three members of student unions from different countries shared their thoughts and opinions about the major challenges that students are currently facing, but also about their expectations for the year 2024. EUROSTUDENT was happy to welcome a very diverse and international group of speakers: Lisa Schivalocchi from Italy (UdU), Kelda McManus from Ireland (USI), and Amanda Teršar from Slovenia (ŠOS).\n\nShow details\n\nAs European societies become more diverse, so does the student population at European higher education institutions. At the same time, the student population in some countries has not been studied as extensively as in others. One of these countries is Luxembourg, which only established its first national university in 2003. In order to deepen the understanding of the Luxembourg student context, Emilia Kmiotek-Meier from the University of Cologne presented her work on Luxembourgish students & data visualisation at the EUROSTUDENT Talks. First, she focussed on study conditions and explored whether academic-related aspects are perceived in the same way by students from different migrant backgrounds, how they manoeuvre through the higher education context, how they cope and how they are supported. The second theme was data visualisation. How to visualize research results and patterns discovered in the data?\n\nShow details\n\nEvery year, the 10th of October is observed as World Mental Health Day. The aim of the day is to raise awareness of mental health issues and to mobilize efforts in support of mental health. Thus, this time, on the 19th of October, the EUROSTUDENT Talks was dedicated to the topic of mental health, too. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted students' mental health, but what is the situation today? Are students thriving and enjoying the best years of their lives? Emily MacPherson from the European Students' Union discussed the latest findings about students’ mental health across Europe.\n\nShow details\n\nInternational mobility of Finnish HE students has been steadily declining already before the COVID-19 pandemic since 2010. Finland is among the countries that produces an up-to-date comparable register based statistical data on student mobility by field of study, IHE and key student characteristics and this data can be accessed via an online statistical database (Vipunen). The average student mobility is found highest among students in business and social sciences, while being lowest in the fields of education and medicine. At the EUROSTUDENT Talks on 21 September, Juhani Saari from Statistics Finland suggested using the EUROSTUDENT data in determining the underlying motivational determinants that differentiate students within different fields of study. Are the field specific differences better explained through perceived benefits of mobility or differences in students’ social conditions? The findings may help determine new policy measures to boost student mobility of currently underrepresented groups.\n\nShow details\n\nSince the outbreak of COVID-19, students’ well-being and learning have become a concern. The lockdown during the pandemic caused a rapid shift from class-based to online teaching. The new online standards might be beneficial for some student groups, while others might have suffered from learning loss and mental health issues. At EUROSTUDENT Talks on 15 June, Amanda Weber from The Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science introduced some findings of the research conducted with David Vestergaard Eriksen. They investigated how COVID-19 restrictions affect students’ well-being and approaches to learning differently. The data consists of 57,744 answers from The Danish Student Survey, collected in autumn 2020.\n\nShow details\n\nAlexis Alamel from Sciences Po Rennes, Odile Ferry from French Observatory of Student Life and Elise Tenret from Paris Dauphine University introduced their research which explored the effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown on French students' housing situation, the relationship between housing and psychological distress and the relationship between housing and students’ academic performance and orientation. Their analysis is based on the 5,994 responses of students to two quantitative national surveys and 33 semi-structured interviews conducted amongst students living in university halls of residence in the North of France in spring 2020.\n\nShow details\n\nA Researchers' Forum will be held in Malta from 18-20 April 2023. It opens a platform for the participating countries to exchange best practices in national implementation of the EUROSTUDENT survey, to present and discuss EUROSTUDENT results and analysis strategies as well as to initiate and foster collaboration opportunities. Researchers and academics from the wider community of higher education and European students' representatives are invited to actively contribute to the event and submit abstracts. Thematically, the event focuses on students’ mental health & well-being, digitalisation of teaching, learning and student life, effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and discrimination experiences. However, contributions on all other EUROSTUDENT topics are also welcome for an open track.\n\nShow details\n\nSylvia Mandl from the Institute for Advanced Studies (IHS), Austria, and Joris Cuppen from ResearchNed, The Netherlands, introduced the brand new EUROSTUDENT VII Scientific Use File 3.0, its contents, and explained where and how to apply for it. Furthermore, they presented inspiring examples from their own research (international student mobility, social integration of students) on the use of the microdata. Finally, they gave an outlook on the future SUF from the current eighth project round.\n\nShow details\n\nIn this session, Triin Lauri, Assistant Professor at Tallinn University, and Kaire Põder, Professor at Estonian Business School, presented their research that focussed on the determinants of student drop-out in different European countries. By using four most extreme cases of student funding - Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands - they explained how the degree to which public financial student support buffers social disadvantages in mitigating student dropout varies across countries depending on how the systems of higher education, tuition fees and subsidies are organized.\n\nShow details\n\nAt this webinar, the audience got an exclusive first look into the data on students' experiences and their situation in Estonia in 2022. Sandra Haugas and Elisabeth Kendrali from the think tank Praxis talked about fresh results from the EUROSTUDENT 8 survey, focusing on the four new themes: mental health and well-being, digitalisation, the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, and discrimination experiences. The webinar was exceptionally not recorded as it was an exclusive sneak peek at some EUROSTUDENT 8 results from Estonia that were only preliminary.\n\nShow details\n\nAt the EUROSTUDENT Talks on 26 January 2023, Lucie Hündlová and Michaela Šmídová, both from Centre for Higher Education Studies (CHES) in Prague compared the results from EUROSTUDENT 8 (data collection in spring 2022) with the previous period. What does the “working-while-studying” phenomenon looks like now in the Czech Republic? Have pandemics and economic problems in society (e.g., inflation, rising energy prices) affected students' work patterns, activities and strategies? Have the reasons that lead students to work during their full-time studies changed significantly?\n\nShow details\n\nThis year's last EUROSTUDENT Talks gives us the chance to get a valuable insight into student life. In the discussion four members of student unions from different countries share their thoughts and opinions about the major challenges that students are currently facing, but also what are their expectations for the year 2023. EUROSTUDENT is happy to welcome a very diverse and international group of speakers: Bjørn Olav Østeby from Norway (NSO), Bruna Bandula from Croatia (CSC), Carlotta Eklöh from Germany (FZS), and Katariina Järve from Estonia (EÜL).\n\nShow details\n\nHow did the COVID-19 pandemic affect students’ financial situation and mental health in Switzerland in 2020? At EUROSTUDENT Talks on the 24th of November, we had a look at national-level results on students´ financial difficulties and mental health problems during the pandemic. Drawing on a specific questionnaire module integrated in the Swiss Survey of higher education graduates, the results show for the first time general trends and striking differences across student groups. Discover how the situation looks like in Switzerland at the webinar with Yassin Boughaba from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO).\n\nShow details\n\nWithin the framework of social policy, there are three basic principles that can be used to design a social security system: 1) the welfare principle, 2) the supply principle and 3) the insurance principle. These principles can also be used to design a public student support system. But what results do countries actually achieve when they follow one of these principles in public student funding? Are there any differences, perhaps even important ones? Which system is better for students or society, when measured by certain characteristics?\n\nShow details\n\nOn the 22nd of September, EUROSTUDENT Talks offered a chance to take a look at the results for the EUROSTUDENT 8 Topical Modules from the Netherlands. Ardita Muja and Joris Cuppen from ResearchNed covered in their presentation all the very intriguing and topical issues: a) impact of COVID-19; b) digitalization of teaching, learning and student life; c) students’ discrimination experiences, and d) students’ mental health and well-being. The webinar was exceptionally not recorded as it was an exclusive sneak peek at some EUROSTUDENT 8 results from the Netherlands that were only preliminary.\n\nShow details\n\nStudent funding policies – that is arrangements regarding scholarships, student loans, tax benefits, family allowances, and tuition fees – vary greatly across Europe. Yet, very little is known about their actual impact on students’ economic well-being and structure of their income. Do students in countries with more generous support have higher total incomes? Do they receive less money from parents or earn less on the labour market? On the aggregate level, there is certainly a concern about the effectiveness of funding policies in reducing student economic hardship. At next EUROSTUDENT Talks, Krzysztof Czarnecki - assistant professor at the Poznań University of Economics and Business - will examine how different student funding policies in Europe are related to: 1) student welfare mix, that is the share of income coming from parents, state, and labour, and 2) students' objective and subjective economic well-being. The analysis is based on the Student Support and Fees Dataset (2005-2015) and the EUROSTUDENT survey data.\n\nShow details\n\nA EUROSTUDENT workshop ‘EUROSTUDENT in context’ is scheduled to be held for policy coordinators on 15/16 June in Tallinn, Estonia. The workshop is planned for 1.5 days starting from 4 pm on 15 June and continuing with a day full of discussions and presentations on 16 June from 9 am to 4:30 pm. More detailed information about the workshop will follow in April. Please save the dates!\n\nWe know from the EUROSTUDENT VII data that most students (a cross-country average of 64%) who have been temporarily enrolled abroad organised the mobility period via the Erasmus(+) programme. In EUROSTUDENT Talks we are happy to welcome Juan Rayón González, the president of Erasmus Student Network, to discuss how has the pandemic affected international student mobility and what are the changes and challenges ahead.\n\nShow details\n\nStudents who enter higher education later and use alternative qualifications are often older, have children and are also more likely to be first-generation students. Whereas in most EHEA countries, alternative access students make up less than 10% of the student population, the share is considerably higher in some countries. At our next EUROSTUDENT Talks webinar, we will examine the role of higher education institutions in facilitating the entry of non-traditional student groups through alternative access routes. Join us to learn about good practices of higher education institutions in Malta and Estonia.\n\nShow details\n\nAre there any differences between degree and credit mobility? What determines mobility patterns in a global perspective compared to the European perspective? Do differences also exist between genders when looking at student' mobility patterns from a global perspective? Is there a connection between countries’ degree of academic freedom and their attractiveness as study destination? If you are interested in discussing these questions, come and join the next EUROSTUDENT Talks where we are welcoming Eva Maria Vögtle, a researcher from DZHW, Germany. Eva Maria will talk about some of her publications in the field of international student mobility in comparative manner, also contrasting them to EUROSTUDENT findings.\n\nShow details\n\nAs in January a new European strategy for universities was published, next EUROSTUDENT Talks will focus on this freshly launched material and discuss how we could, using data smartly, move towards diversity, inclusiveness and equity in our HE systems. We are happy to welcome Lucie Trojanová from the European Commission, who will introduce the ideas of this strategy from the EU perspective. Kaisu Piiroinen and Berto Bosscha from two EUROSTUDENT countries, Finland and the Netherlands, will join the discussion to reflect on the strategy and how they think EUROSTUDENT data help countries to achieve the goal of inclusive HE.\n\nShow details\n\nAccording to the EUROSTUDENT data, on average, a quarter of students with impairments (SWI) often feel out of place in higher education – this figure is 10 percentage points higher than among students without an impairment. How satisfied are SWI with their experiences in the academic environment? Are they supported enough? What could be done in higher education institutions (both by the staff and fellow students) and by policy-makers to better facilitate both academic and social integration of SWI? Come and join EUROSTUDENT Talks webinar on the 27th of January at 11CET to find out more about this topic! We are happy to welcome Jakob Rosin, a radio journalist, leader of Estonian Blind Union and an alumnus of Tallinn University, who will share his own experience in higher education and reflect the subject in broader, policy sense as well.\n\nShow details\n\nThis year's last EUROSTUDENT Talks webinar gives us the chance to get a valuable insight into student life. In the discussion four members of student unions from different countries will share their thoughts and opinions about the major challenges that students are currently facing, but also what are their expectations for the year 2022. EUROSTUDENT is happy to welcome a very diverse and international group of speakers: Ángel Canal from Spain (CREUP), Damir Solak from Czech Republic (SK RVŠ), Horia Onita from Romania (ANOSR), and Jacob Blasius from Denmark (DSF). Come and join us at a pre-Christmas webinar in Zoom! (no pre-registration required)\n\nShow details\n\nEUROSTUDENT data has important use for higher education policy makers at national and European level, and also informs and enables research into students' lives in Europe. But how are researchers using EUROSTUDENT data? Join this webinar where Mairéad Finn (Trinity College Dublin) and Georgiana Mihut (University of Warwick) talk about their academic article which sought to understand what explains higher levels of academic satisfaction among international students, including concepts of cultural distance and marketization. While their analyses was situated in the Republic of Ireland, it has implications for other European countries.\n\nShow details\n\nFor the first time in EUROSTUDENT, more detailed information has been collected regarding internships during studying in higher education. How common is following an internship in EUROSTUDENT countries? How well do internships prepare students for the labour market? Come and dive deeper into this topic at EUROSTUDENT Talks webinar taking place on the 28th of October with Froukje Wartenbergh-Cras!\n\nShow details\n\nThe report “Social and Economic Conditions of Student Life in Europe. EUROSTUDENT VII 2018-2021. Synopsis of Indicators “ and the new EUROSTUDENT database will be presented at a webinar next Thursday, 11 a.m. CEST – access the Zoom link by clicking on the picture below. You are invited to join this presentation, and are also very welcome to forward it – the link is open. The presentations will focus on the main results of the EUROSTUDENT report and introduce the features of the new database.

The conference will mark the publication of the EUROSTUDENT VII final report and the EUROSTUDENT VII database and aims to:\n\n- showcase the EUROSTUDENT VII 'Synopsis of Indicators' and the EUROSTUDENT VII database, informing about the main results\n\n- encourage reflection on EUROSTUDENT VII comparative results from a national perspective, and vice versa\n\n- inspire discussions about practices in using EUROSTUDENT data and result\n\nConference website\n\nIn November 2020, the ministers responsible for higher education will meet to discuss the future of the EHEA at the Ministerial Conference. The social dimension has gained importance during the last round, and is set to gain traction as countries develop their social dimension strategies for higher education. EUROSTUDENT data provide a comprehensive overview of the situation of students during their studies. Who are the students in Europe? How do they study, and what are the personal and financial circumstances in which they study? The full EUROSTUDENT report will be available in 2021. In order to provide first insights into the data, a short publication highlights key indicators on students in Europe based on data collected in 2019.\n\nJoin our virtual launch event to get a sneak preview of EUROSTUDENT results - the newest comparative data on the social and economic condition of students in Europe!\n\nThis event will serve as a platform for the policy makers from all EUROSTUDENT countries to exchange best practices in policy development using EUROSTUDENT survey, discuss preliminary EUROSTUDENT VII results and initiate and foster collaboration opportunities.\n\nThe aim of the conference is to demonstrate to policy makers the importance of the EUROSTUDENT data and to get their feedback to ensure that EUROSTUDENT is relevant for policy development beyond 2020. The conference will achieve this objective by providing a sneak preview of the data collected through EUROSTUDENT VII and showcasing how this data has been used to guide policy making to improve socio-economic situation of various students groups in different countries.\n\nThis event is cancelled due to the Covid 19 pandemic\n\nThe Executive Agency for Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding (UEFISCDI) will organise the fourth edition of the” Future of Higher Education – Bologna Process Researchers’ Conference” (FOHE-BPRC4), in Bucharest, Romania on 29 – 31 January 2020. The conference is part of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) official calendar of events and conferences, promoting and sustaining the development of EHEA. It aims at providing a unique forum for dialogue between researchers, experts and policy makers in the field of higher education.\n\nConference website\n\nItaly, host of the 2020 Ministerial Conference and presently seat of the Secretariat of the Bologna Follow-Up Group (BFUG), wants this Celebration to have a proactive, future-oriented role, providing the platform for a large-scale mid-term academic consultation on the future of the Bologna Process and the EHEA. They hope to involve hundreds of international scholars, students and staff, to focus on the fundamental values of the EHEA, and to help elaborate a “Vision” for European higher education beyond 2020.\n\nConference website\n\nThe policy workshop will provide a chance for the EUROSTUDENT policy coordinators and other relevant stakeholders to exchange about their experiences in drawing on EUROSTUDENT data for policy development. Information on the current project developments, as well as future aspects (micro data, future rounds of EUROSTUDENT) will also be provided and put to discussion.\n\nDraft agenda\n\nThe Working Group 1 on Monitoring (fundamental values) was adopted by the BFUG meeting in Vienna in September 2018 with the purpose to prepare for 2020 a report assessing the main developments in the EHEA since the Bologna Process began, including to what extent we have fulfilled the mobility target agreed in Leuven/Louvain-la-Neuve in 2009, to continue to provide reliable, comparable data and to take stock of progress towards realising the European Higher Education Area, to make further progress in improving structured and standardised monitoring of the EHEA and to ensure that accurate comparisons can be made between countries and that implementation and other changes are transparent within as well as between countries.\n\nMore info on Working Group 1\n\nWe are happy to invite you to the first EUROSTUDENT webinar on April 19th at 10 am (CEST). In this webinar we are looking into the situation of higher education students who engage in paid work alongside their studies. Colleagues from MOSTA (EUROSTUDENT consortium) will present some of the main results of EUROSTUDENT VI on and provide answers to these and other important questions. The webinar will be 1 hour approximately.\n\nThe aim of the EUROSTUDENT Researchers’ Forum is to provide inspiration on how to analyse and use the results of the EUROSTUDENT surveys, especially for in-depth analyses. The target group of the conference are mainly the researchers conducting the EUROSTUDENT survey at the national level. The event provides a chance to discuss and get inspirational insights about how EUROSTUDENT results could be used in various research projects and forms. Sharing experiences will provide ideas of how EUROSTUDENT results could be used to represent and analyse the socio-economic situation of various student groups in the European Higher Education Area.\n\nThe conference will offer:\n\n• Up-to-date knowledge about the social dimension in other countries\n\n• Inspiration for in-depth analyses based on EUROSTUDENT data\n\n• a basis for cooperation of different research teams\n\n• ideas for comparative research\n\n• ideas for dissemination\n\n• problem-solving/advice by the EUROSTUDENT Consortium\n\nResearchers' Forum - Programme\n\nThe workshop on data preparation, cleaning and delivery will include a step-by-step walk-through all of the preliminary data preparation steps of the handbook and syntaxes individually with each team.
