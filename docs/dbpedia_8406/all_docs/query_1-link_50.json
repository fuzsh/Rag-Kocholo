        "text": "A risk assessment and business impact analysis (BIA) have been completed for a major proposed purchase and new process for an organization. There is disagreement between the information security manager and the business department manager who will be responsible for evaluating the results and identified risk. Which of the following would be the BEST approach of the information security manager?\n\nAcceptance of the business manager’s decision on the risk to the corporation\n\nThe business manager is likely to be focused on getting the business done as opposed to the risk posed to the organization.\n\nAcceptance of the information security manager’s decision on the risk to the corporation\n\nThe typical information security manager is focused on risk, and on average, he/she will overestimate risk by about 100 percent—usually considering worst case scenarios rather than the most probable events.\n\nReview of the risk assessment with executive management for final input\n\nExecutive management will be in the best position to consider the big picture and the trade-offs between security and functionality in the entire organization.\n\nCreate a new risk assessment and BIA to resolve the disagreement\n\nThere is no indication that the assessments are inadequate or defective in some way; therefore, repeating the exercise is not warranted\n\nWho is accountable for ensuring that information is categorized and that specific protective measures are taken?\n\nThe security officer\n\nThe security officer supports and implements information security to achieve senior management objectives.\n\nSenior management\n\nRoutine administration of all aspects of security is delegated, but top management must retain overall accountability.\n\nThe end user\n\nThe end user does not perform categorization.\n\nThe custodian\n\nThe custodian supports and implements information security measures as directed.\n\nAbnormal server communication from inside the organization to external parties may be monitored to:\n\nrecord the trace of advanced persistent threats\n\nThe most important feature of target attacks as seen in advanced persistent threats is that malware secretly sends information back to a command and control server. Therefore, monitoring of outbound server communications that do not follow predefined routes will be the best control to detect such security events.\n\nevaluate the process resiliency of server operations\n\nServer communications are usually not monitored to evaluate the resiliency of server operations.\n\nverify the effectiveness of an intrusion detection system\n\nThe effectiveness of an intrusion detection system may not be verified by monitoring outbound server communications.\n\nsupport a nonrepudiation framework in e-commerce\n\nNonrepudiation may be supported by technology, such as a digital signature. Server communication itself does not support the effectiveness of an e-commerce framework.\n\nWhich of the following authentication methods prevents authentication replay?\n\nPassword hash implementation\n\nCapturing the authentication handshake and replaying it through the network will not work. Using hashes by itself will not prevent a replay.\n\nChallenge/response mechanism\n\nA challenge/response mechanism prevents replay attacks by sending a different random challenge in each authentication event. The response is linked to that challenge.\n\nWired equivalent privacy encryption usage\n\nA wired equivalent privacy key will not prevent sniffing, but it will take the attacker longer to break the WEP key if he/she does not already have it). Therefore, it will not be able to prevent recording and replaying an authentication handshake.\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol basic authentication\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol basic authentication is cleartext and has no mechanisms to prevent replay.\n\nIT-related risk management activities are MOST effective when they are:\n\ntreated as a distinct process\n\nIT risk is part of the broader risk landscape and must be integrated into overall risk management activities.\n\nconducted by the IT department\n\nTo ensure an objective, holistic approach, IT risk management must be addressed on an enterprisewide basis, making it separate from the IT department.\n\nintegrated within business processes\n\nIT is an enabler of business activities, and to be effective, it must be integrated into business processes.\n\ncommunicated to all employees\n\nCommunication alone does not necessarily correlate with successful execution of the process.\n\nWhich of the following is the BEST way to detect an intruder who successfully penetrates a network before significant damage is inflicted?\n\nPerform periodic penetration testing\n\nPenetration testing will not detect an intruder.\n\nEstablish minimum security baselines\n\nSecurity baselines set minimum security levels but are not related to detecting intruders.\n\nImplement vendor default settings\n\nImplementing vendor default settings do not detect intruders and is not the best idea.\n\nInstall a honeypot on the network\n\nHoneypots attract hackers away from sensitive systems and files. Because honeypots are closely monitored, the intrusion is more likely to be detected before significant damage is inflicted.\n\nWhich of the following presents the GREATEST threat to the security of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system?\n\nUser ad hoc reporting is not logged\n\nAlthough the lack of logging for user ad hoc reporting is not necessarily good, it does not represent as serious a security weakness as the failure to install security patches.\n\nNetwork traffic is through a single switch\n\nRouting network traffic through a single switch is not unusual.\n\nOperating system security patches have not been applied\n\nThe fact that operating system security patches have not been applied is a serious weakness.\n\nDatabase security defaults to ERP settings\n\nDatabase security defaulting to the enterprise resource planning system’s settings is not as significant.\n\nIn a social engineering scenario, which of the following will MOST likely reduce the likelihood of an unauthorized individual gaining access to computing resources?\n\nImplementing on-screen masking of passwords\n\nImplementing on-screen masking of passwords is desirable but will not be effective in reducing the likelihood of a successful social engineering attack.\n\nConducting periodic security awareness programs\n\nSocial engineering can best be mitigated through periodic security awareness training for users who may be the target of such an attempt.\n\nIncreasing the frequency of password changes\n\nIncreasing the frequency of password changes is desirable but will not be effective in reducing the likelihood of a successful social engineering attack.\n\nRequiring that passwords be kept strictly confidential\n\nRequiring that passwords be kept secret in security policies is a good control but is not as effective as periodic security awareness programs that will alert users of the dangers posed by social engineering.\n\nThe postincident review of a security incident revealed that there was a process that was not monitored. As a result monitoring functionality has been implemented. Which of the following may BEST be expected from this remediation?\n\nReduction in total incident duration\n\nMonitoring may cause incident durations to become longer as each event is investigated and possibly escalated for further remediation.\n\nIncrease in risk tolerance\n\nRisk tolerance is a determination made by senior management based on the results of a risk analysis and the amount of risk senior management believes the organization can manage effectively. Risk tolerance will not change from implementation of a monitoring process\n\nImprovement in identific\n\nWhen a key process is not monitored, that lack of monitoring may lead to a security vulnerability or threat going undiscovered resulting in a security incident. Once consistent monitoring is implemented, identification of vulnerabilities and threats will improve.\n\nFacilitation of escalation\n\nMonitoring itself is simply an identification and reporting tool; it has little bearing on how information is escalated to other staff members for investigation and resolution.\n\nCongratulations, you passed with 0 correct!\n\nGreat job!
