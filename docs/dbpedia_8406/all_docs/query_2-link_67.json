        "text": "Day 1: Travel to San Basilio de Palenque. Meet with community members to discuss local history and culture.\n\nDay 2: Learn about the local justice system from La Guardia Cimarrona. Meet with a doctor of ancestral medicine, and explore traditional (natural) medicines. Then participate in a music workshop that examines the diverse rhythms of the Caribbean coast.\n\nDay 3: Hike to the local farming spot and assist a Palenquero farmer for the day. Then in the evening, eat dinner with Palenquera women and hear them talk about their individual projects in the community, their fight against oppression, and their resilience.\n\nDay 4: Travel to Cartagena. Explore the city and then relax on the beach.\n\nDay 5: Head to La Boquilla, a village outside the city with a large Afro-Colombian population. Hear about the negative effects of rapid-growth tourism for livelihoods dependent upon fishing from locals. Learn about Colombiaâ€™s biodiversity and the techniques of traditional fishing. Afterward, help cook a delicious meal with the local community.\n\nDay 6: Meet with local social leaders as you visit neighborhoods populated by those displaced by armed conflict and gentrification. Then engage in an intercultural exchange activity with a local school in the neighborhood that helps empower students to stay off the streets through performance arts.\n\nDay 7: Travel back to Cali."
