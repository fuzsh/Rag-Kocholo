        "text": "The time difference between Phuket, Thailand and Spain varies depending on the standard time in Spain and whether or not Thailand is observing daylight saving time.\n\nSpain has two main time zones: peninsular english time (CET, Central European Time) and island english time (WET, Western European Time) for the Canary Islands. On the other hand, Thailand is in the Indochina Time Zone (ICT, Indochina Time).\n\nHere are the typical time differences between Phuket and Spain:\n\nMainland Spain (CET) and Thailand (ICT): Phuket is approximately 6 hours ahead of mainland Spain.\n\nCanary Islands (WET) and Thailand (ICT): Phuket is approximately 7 hours ahead of the Canary Islands.\n\nIt is important to note that Spain observes daylight saving time, while Thailand does not. Therefore, during the months when Spain moves forward one hour for daylight saving time, the time difference is reduced by one hour. For example, when Spain is on Daylight Saving Time (CEST, Central European Summer Time), the time difference between Phuket and mainland Spain is approximately 5 hours, and between Phuket and the Canary Islands, it is approximately 6 hours.\n\nIt is essential to check the current time in both locations before making international plans or communicating with people on the other side of the world, as daylight saving time rules can change and affect the time difference."
