Pacifica Entertainment has plopped down mid- to high-six figures for scribe David Aaron Cohen’s script “Prince of Galilee,” an epic set in the 12th century.

Moritz Borman, co-prexy of Pacifica, will produce along with Wally Nicita of La Luna Films (which has a first-look deal with Pacifica) and Barnett Bain (“What Dreams May Come”) of Metafilmics.

Pic is described as a “Lawrence of Arabia”- style epic that follows one knight’s crusade from Europe to the Middle East, where his meteoric rise to power pits him against the great Moslem General Saladin.

Cohen, who with David Jarre was the credited writer of the Harrison Ford and Brad Pitt starrer “The Devil’s Own,” also penned “The Quantum Project,” a special-effects script that will premiere online on a Web site yet to be announced. Barnett is also producing that project.

Cohen has also optioned the rights to make a film based on 1960s comic Alan Sherman’s autobiography.

Pacifica is a Hollywood-based, multifaceted entertainment company backed by German investment fund, IMF. The company has financed such pictures as “Clay Pigeons,” “Where the Money Is” and the Jennifer Lopez starrer, “The Wedding Planner,” which Destination Films intends to put in production early next year.

Cohen is repped by Paradigm and his attorney Linda Lichter of Lichter, Grossman, Nichols & Adler.
