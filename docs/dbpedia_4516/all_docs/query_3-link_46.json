        "text": "Set in America, Israel, and Palestine, Wrestling Jerusalem follows one man’s journey to understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Davidman’s solo performance is a personal story that grapples with the complexities of identity, history, and social justice. Giving voice to a dozen characters, the play sheds light on one of the most entrenched conflicts of our time. Written and performed by Aaron Davidman and directed by Michael John Garcés, Wrestling Jerusalem was commissioned by Ari Roth, former artistic director of Theatre J in Washington D.C. as part of their annual Voices from a Changing Middle East Festival. After workshop performances at Theatre J, the play was developed in part by Traveling Jewish Theatre, Sundance Institute Theatre Program, and Playwrights Foundation, where Davidman used public performance readings to continue to hone the piece.\n\nAfter receiving her BA from Harvard University and two graduate degrees in music from the Peabody Conservatory of Music at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where she served as a cantor for the High Holidays at Temple Oheb Shalom, soprano Allison Charney went on to great acclaim in opera houses across the United States where she was hailed for her \"vocal agility, lush sound and dramatic portrayals.\" Her concert highlights have included performances at Alice Tully Hall, Avery Fisher Hall, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Pops under the baton of NY Philharmonic music director, Alan Gilbert. A champion of music of our times, Ms. Charney has premiered many new works and is featured on the first recording of the Pulitzer Prize nominated oratorio CHOOSE LIFE. Ms. Charney can also be heard in a recording of American songs on the DSC Label and is a founding member of the ARK trio, whose first recording is scheduled to be released in the fall of 2017. An active recitalist and master teacher, Ms. Charney is the founder and curator of the innovative NYC classical concert series, PREFORMANCES WITH ALLISON CHARNEY (now in its 8th season), where she has gained a reputation for breaking down the traditional barriers that exist between the audience and performers – who happen to be many of the most elite members of classical music. For more information visit PREformances.org\n\nAfter dancing with Israeli's renowned Bat Sheva Dance Company, Miller started her own company in NYC in 2006. Miller's quirky, energetic and aggressive choreographic style immediately impressed audiences, and her company was invited to perform at Jacob's Pillow, the Joyce, and many other venues, including performances at the JCC in 2009 and 2010. We are thrilled to have provided her company a home base in 2011 to further its artistic development. This residency concluded with performances of Mama Call, a collection of dances that address Miller's Sephardic story and examine how the displaced can reclaim an idea of \"home\" and Miller's new work Seven Circles, an experiment about intimacy that explores the exposure of limitations and vulnerabilities as an act of trust and love.\n\nAfter making his professional operatic debut in the world premiere of Philip Glass's Appomattox with the San Francisco Opera Company, Anthony Russell is now a vocalist, composer and arranger specializing in Yiddish song. Anthony's work in traditional Ashkenazi musical forms led to a musical exploration of his own roots through the research, arrangement and performance of a hundred years of African American traditional music. The result of this is the album Convergence (2018), a collaboration with San Francisco Bay Area klezmer consort Veretski Pass exploring the sounds of one hundred years of African American and Ashkenazi Jewish music. In 2017, Anthony teamed up with accordionist and pianist Dmitri Gaskin to win the Concorso Internacional de Canciones en Idish (Der Idisher Idol) in Mexico City, eventually forming a duo, Tsvey Brider (“Two Brothers”), for the composition and performance of new songs in the Yiddish language. Over the past year, Tsvey Brider has been featured in Berlin’s Radical Jewish Culture Festival, toured Poland and performed for culture and music festivals all over the United States, most recently for the Yiddish New York Festival in Manhattan. Anthony's solo work in Jewish music has brought him to stages in Toronto, Montreal, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, London and Tel Aviv, Symphony Space in New York City, the Kennedy Center in Washington DC and Limmud Fests across the United States and Europe.\n\nAviv Geffen is an Israeli rock musician, singer, songwriter, producer, keyboardist and guitarist. He is the son of writer and poet Yehonatan Geffen and Nurit Makover, brother of Shira Geffen, and a graduate of Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. Geffen was and is extremely popular among Israeli youth, who were later known as the \"Moonlight Children\", in the 1990s. Politically, he associates with the Israeli left. His music contains subjects such as love and peace, but also death, suicide, the army, and refusal to serve. He is also controversial because of his decision not to serve in the IDF, though officially, he was dismissed for medical reasons.\n\nMost known for her group, Pharaoh's Daughter, a 7 piece world music ensemble that travels effortlessly through continents, key signatures, and languages with a genre-bending sound. Basya Schechter’s earthy, soulful beautiful voice rings out over instruments that form a vibrant collage of East/West, Ashkenaz a vision of a new Middle East. She is also the musical director of Romemu a fast growing progressive spiritually adventurous community in the Upper West Side. In the summer she is a cantor for the Fire Island synagogue, a smaller flip flop wearing community, co-led with banjo playing Rabbi, writer and academic, Shaul Magid.\n\nBased on a true story and adapted from I Didn't Execute the Mission by Arieh Segev, High Noon takes the audience back to the Yom Kippur war, during which Corporal Asher Solomon was taken prisoner by the Egyptians. After forty-five days in captivity he is repatriated and taken to an R & R facility for three weeks, to rest under medical supervision, but mainly for an intensive interrogation by military field security on the circumstances of his capture. The offensive and degrading encounter between Asher and the interrogator leads to a head-on confrontation, taking Asher back to the terrible days of his captivity.\n\nHaving carved a reputation for himself as an innovative composer, performer, violinist, and band leader, Haitian-American artist Daniel Bernard Roumain (known as DBR) melds his classical music roots with his own cultural references and vibrant musical imagination. DBR has impressed audiences around the country, including his performance on the JCC's annual Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day event in 2010. DBR has worked with a wide range of artists and venues, ranging from Bill T. Jones to BAM to Seattle schoolkids. During his residency at the JCC in 2011-2012, DBR interacted with many different areas of the JCC community and created a musical version of the haggadah, The Order of an Empty Place, a resetting of Rabbis Joy Levitt and Michael Strassfeld's haggadah, scored for a 33-piece wind orchestra, solo violin, and rabbi.\n\nHer powerful singing voice, distinctive performance style, and mostly her expressive lyrics have marked Dana Berger as one of the most promising artists in the Israeli rock scene. With 12 years of national acclaim and six albums to her name, Dana Berger has become one of the most well-known and influential female performers in Israel. For the last few years, Dana toured the world with guitarist Yaniv Dadon. Dana puts on a show that brings her music to the audience in a soft and charming way and is adored by audiences around the globe.\n\nDetroit-born, Berlin-based singer/songwriter, polyglot poet, translator, and activist Daniel Kahn concocts furious, tender, electrifying, and revolutionary Alienation Klezmer. With the Painted Bird, he presents a variety of passionate songs inspired in part by the struggles of Jewish revolutionaries at the turn of the century, and in part by his own intense desire for a better world. The Painted Bird has brought “Yiddish Punk Cabaret” to rock clubs, festivals, and shtetls, from Berlin to Boston, Leningrad to Louisiana. The band has been referred to as “The Yiddish Pogues,” and Kahn was once described as “someone between Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, and Tom Waits – but Yiddish.”\n\nFounded in 1995 as a collective of artists who keep theater at the heart of social life, Great Small Works draws on folk, avant-garde, and popular theater traditions to address contemporary issues. The company performs in theaters, clubs, schools, galleries, streets, and community centers. Based in New York City, they produce performance works on a wide variety of scales, from outdoor pageants with giant puppets and hundreds of performers from diverse communities to miniature \"toy theater\" spectacles. The productions consistently reinvent ancient, popular theater techniques: toy theater, mask and object theater, circus, sideshow, and picture-show (cantastoria) to name a few. On any scale, the productions seek to renew, cultivate, and strengthen the spirits of their audiences, promoting theater as a model for reanimating the public sphere and participating in democratic life.\n\nAs both a pianist and guitarist, Hazzan Piatigorsky uses instruments to enrich services, and bring joy in song and prayer to the entire community as the cantor of West End Synagogue, where she devotes herself to the education and vibrancy of the congregation. She is passionate about empowering the congregation to read Torah, and draws all ages to this great mitzvah. As a recently trained Storahtelling \"Maven\", Hazzan Piatigorsky regularly brings Torah to life through midrash-infused living translation and bibliodrama. She is a mentor for the Leadership Institute, working with Jewish education directors, and mentors future cantors through the Jewish Theological Seminary. Hazzan Piatigorsky is a member of the Cantor's Assembly and The American Conference of Cantors.\n\nDedicated to creating provocative, highly technical, and physically adventurous works, Heidi Latsky, former member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, created IF, a dynamic new piece, which mixes members of her company with disabled artists while in residence at the JCC in the fall of 2010. Through open rehearsals, movement instillations in the lobby, and the premiere of IF, the JCC community had the chance to see how Latsky's work \"beautifully resets the preconceptions about bodies and movement\" (The New York Times).\n\nHLD continues to collaborate with various social service and humanitarian organizations and performs for and speaks at disability organizations’ galas and festivals and educational institutions like Barnard, Harvard, and the Chicago Humanities Festival. Current partners include Hurleyville Arts Centre, the United Nations, the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities, New York Academy of Medicine, and ReelAbilities Film Festival. In March 2017, HLD performed ON DISPLAY, a structured improvisation movement piece designed to be performed by diverse people. Presented in the open and free space of the Marlene Meyerson JCC Manhattan lobby, the installation allows performers and the public alike to fully witness each other. Here the viewer is as much on display as the viewed. This is a platform to experience and broadcast difference; to elevate and celebrate it within a clear context.\n\nThe Jewish Plays Project puts bold, progressive Jewish conversations on world stages. The JPP’s innovative and competitive development vehicle invests emerging artists in their Jewish identity; engages Jewish communities in the vetting, selecting, and championing of new voices; and secures mainstream production opportunities for the best new plays. In its six years, the JPP has vetted 1,132 plays from 884 writers in 32 states and nine countries, and actively developed 34 plays, 18 of which have gone on to production in New York (BAM, the Flea, 4th Street Theater, Dixon Place), Tel Aviv, London, Detroit, and around the U.S. The JPP's signature method is Jewish dramaturgy—matching the best minds in the Jewish community with the best 21st century Jewish plays.\n\nAcclaimed for the heartfelt intensity and technical mastery of his playing, pianist Joseph Kalichstein enthralls audiences throughout the United States and Europe, winning equal praise as orchestral soloist, recitalist, and chamber musician. He is also the first chamber music advisor to the Kennedy Center. A favorite of New York concertgoers, Kalichstein has appeared in several recitals as part of Carnegie Hall's \"Keyboard Virtuosi\" series. He has also appeared there as soloist with the Cleveland Orchestra, the Leipzig Chamber Orchestra, and the Kalichstein-Laredo-Robinson Trio. He frequently collaborates with the world's great string quartets, among them the Emerson, Guarneri and Juilliard.\n\nCited as \"a giant of the piano,\" Ran Dank was born in Israel in 1982. Mr. Dank has won virtually every major prize available for a young musician in his country, including the America-Israel Cultural Foundation scholarships since 1992, and the Voice of Music Competition.\n\nJoshua Nelson born and raised Jewish, studiedf Judaism, including two years on a college and kibbutz program in Israel, clarified his understanding that throughout history, Jews had always integrated Jewish law and religious practices with the cultural context in which they lived. Upon his return from Israel, Nelson began to apply this understanding to music, beginning what has been called “a revolution in Jewish music” by combining Jewish liturgical lyrics with one of America’s best-known indigenous musical forms; thus kosher gospel music was born. For Nelson, kosher gospel is a way to claim both parts of his identity as a Black Jew. When Joshua was eight, he discovered an album by Mahalia Jackson, the Queen of Gospel, in his grandparents’ record collection, and fell in love with her singing. During his teens and early 20s, he became widely celebrated as a gospel singer, continuing the Jackson’s legacy. For his audiences, whatever their faith or heritage, kosher gospel has been a revelation. Now in his early 30s, Nelson has performed around the world, for presidents, congregations, major music festivals—and for Oprah, who named him a “Next Big Thing.” He has produced a stellar album, Mi Chamocha, sung with stars from Aretha Franklin to the Klezmatics, and served as the subject of the acclaimed documentary film Keep on Walking. Nelson also passes on this musical gift as an artist in residence at Jewish congregations across the country, including at his home synagogue of Temple Sharey Tefilo-Israel, a Reform congregation in South Orange, New Jersey, where he taught Hebrew school for 15 years. Whatever the venue, Joshua Nelson, the Prince of Kosher Gospel, brings people—and cultures—together in joyous song.\n\nKa’et Dance Ensemble develops contemporary dance that stems from the vibrant world of an ancient religion, advancing this vision on the professional stage, in Israel, and around the world. Without concessions to themselves or to their audiences, they focus a direct gaze on the conflict between body and soul, between tradition and modernity, and from this tectonic rift, they unveil a new language full of pain, honesty, and hope. The ensemble is a group of graduates of the \"Kol Atzmotay Tamerana\" school in Jerusalem, who premiered their first show, Road No. 1, in November 2010. Since then, members of the Ensemble have been producing new work every year. The Ensemble performs throughout Israel, and has also performed in Madrid, London, and Singapore. Ka’et Ensemble continues to receive recognition and support from a variety of bodies, including the Ministry of Culture and the Jerusalem Municipality.\n\nRachel Calof—A Memoir with Music dramatizes the story of Rachel Calof, a Jewish picture bride.

Kate is one of the creators of Rachel Calof: A Memoir with Music.\n\nLeeSaar: The Company artists Saar Harari and Lee Sher arrived in NYC from Tel Aviv with little more than a dream of forming a company that would make a splash i the NYC dance world. Five years later, their company had garnered outstanding reviews in The New York Times, received a Guggenheim Fellowship, and performed all over the world. The physicality and explosive tempos synonymous with LeeSaar's award-winning choreography matured and ripened in Prima, created while in residence at the JCC in the fall of 2009.\n\nClarinetist Michael Winograd is one of the most respected and versatile working musicians in klezmer music today. Based in Brooklyn, Michael spends much of his time in transit, performing and teaching throughout the world. He is one third of the transatlantic klezmer/cabaret collective Yiddish Art Trio, clarinetist of Tarras Band, a classic 1950s Jewish American tribute group, and the co-founder and director of the groundbreaking, borderless world fusion band Sandaraa. Michael also collaborates with Cantor Yaakov “Yanky” Lemmer and Klezmatics trumpeter Frank London in Ahava Raba, a group that explores the spiritual sides of Ashkenazi Jewish music. He has played alongside Itzhak Perlman, The Klezmer Conservatory Band, Socalled, Budowitz, Alicia Svigals, and more.\n\nLight Is Heard in Zig Zag is this theater company's first play and the first of its kind in the world. The show was created in a long and enduring process, as a full collaboration between Adina Tal and the deaf-blind actors. During drama workshops, each one of the actors expressed his/her heart-wish. The group worked on rhythm and improvisations, using hand shake, body movement, and touch-sign language with the help of special interpreters. Gradually, the actors' dreams and aspirations were woven into a play to be performed on stage.\n\nIn keeping with the Opera on Tap credo of showcasing the entertainment aspect of opera, OOT Jr. was created to first be fun, and second be educational. The format speaks to the contemporary child, employing modern everyday speech, and even makes references to technology. The format was designed for ages 4-7 and is designed to keep the kids interested in the show by directly involving them and having the performers directly interact with them. Every show takes place in Operaland, to which thee audience members are travelers and given a passport as they enter the performance space. An airline attendant guides the passengers through their travels. Volunteers from the audience are invited to come on stage and use the remote control to freeze and unfreeze characters. The device has been extremely useful in teaching the kids about different musical concepts employed in opera. With every show, one opera is presented and one musical concept is paired with it.\n\nThe Punishing Blowreceived its world premiere as part of the 6th annual Woodstock Fringe Festival. \"Arrested, tried, and convicted,\" press notes state, \"a college professor can stay out of jail if he enters rehab for his drinking, undergoes treatment for anger management, and gives a public lecture [this play] about one person of his choosing from a list of The 100 Most Influential Jews of All Time.\" Playwright Randy Cohen is the winner of four Emmy awards for his work as a writer for \"Late Night with David Letterman,\" \"TV Nation\" and \"The Rosie O'Donnell Show\" and wrote \"The Ethicist,\" a weekly column in the Sunday New York Times Magazine.\n\nThe JCC is thrilled to have provided a home to Rachel Dickstein to adapt Gertrude Stein's little-known children's book, The World is Round, and to have offered our entire community the opportunity to spend a year with Ripe Time.\n\nRachel is a writer, director, teacher, and founding artistic director of Ripe Time, a company devoted to new ensemble-based performance works infused with rich language, visual power, and physical rigor.\n\nFor Ripe Time, Rachel has devised, choreographed, and directed the world premieres of Fire Throws (based on Sophocles' Antigone), Betrothed (based on texts by Jhumpa Lahiri, Chekhov, and Ansky), and Innocents (based on Wharton's The House of Mirth and adapted with Emily Morse). Her breathtaking production of Septimus and Clarissa (an adaptation of Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway) was chosen as one of the \"best of 2011\" by New York magazine. Rachel has also created and directed other new works for New York Theatre Workshop, New Georges, New York Shakespeare Festival/Joe's Pub, and Seattle's Annex Theatre.\n\n\"There are as many ways to move as there are people. I include both the incredible virtuosity of highly trained dancers and the unique and deeply human contributions of nontrained movers in my work. By combining them, I aim to create a rich, complex picture of the human experience that is resonant with all kinds of audiences. Our creative process begins with questions like, What feels like \"home\" to you? What is the meaning of maleness and masculinity in our society, and what could it mean? We bring our questions to people of different ages, backgrounds, and abilities in community settings, and they answer us in words and movements that open up universes of possibility. In the studio, the company turns those answers into dances—stretching them, turning them into daring partnering, whirling them through space, and arranging them in patterns across many bodies\" — Risa Jaroslow.\n\nMichaeli is an Israeli actress, comedian, television hostess, and entertainer who was singing on Israeli radio by the age ofy 14. Michaeli performed her military duties at the Army Radio. In the 1960s, her first show on stage was with Yossi Banai .

The Los Angeles choreographer braids this allegory of regeneration with reflections on the history of her own Polish-Jewish ancestors, horse traders from Szczecin, and the fate of Polish Jewry. Tov takes its title from \"Gamzu l'tovah\" (\"This too is for the good\"), a favorite saying of one of Gamson's forebears, Talmudic scholar Nachum ish Gamzu, who found God's hand even in tragedy. The full-evening work features a cast of 14 American and three Polish performers, with text spoken and sung in Hebrew, Polish, English, Yiddish, Bulgarian, and German.\n\nSalomee Speelt is a \"fixed-fluid\" collective set up by Noémi Schlosser, a young theater creator. The idea for this company arose from the need to bring various branches of art, equipment, and people from a variety of artistic milieus together. Furthermore, there was a desire for the freedom to make independent in-house productions, as well as the ability to work on a freelance basis.\n\nMoscow–NY: A Video Opera is an ethereal and thought-provoking new production that brings to life the story of a brother and sister who flee Warsaw in the 30s—she to Moscow to follow her dreams of a utopian socialist paradise, and he to NYC to embrace the life of a famous writer.

Birth of the Phoenix is a dynamic site-specific creation, adapting to the qualities of each performance site, in response to the heartbeat and rhythm of the environment, the specific ecosystem, and the season.\n\nThe writer and artist Bruno Schulz, a Polish Jew who transmogrified everyday village life into something rich and strange, may not be well known outside of Europe, but his devotees in the U.S. include author John Updike, composer John Zorn and REDCAT. The Last Escape, Wroclawski Teatr Lalek's (Wroclaw Puppet Theater) stage adaptation of one of Schulz's short stories, is clearly influenced by Franz Kafka—the multilingual Schulz (1892–942) apparently translated The Trial into Polish; he also shared something of the spirit of Lewis Carroll. \"Poetry happens when short circuits of sense occur,\" Schulz once argued, and like a Mad Hatter of Mitteleuropa, he invented such illogical delights as rooms lined with snores, fathers who turned into wallpaper, and time so revisited that it could be sold as secondhand. The Last Escape centers on Jozef, a pensioner trying to escape his isolation. Jozef discovers a corner of his room where time and space are suspended and he is able to travel back into his mythical childhood memories and dreams.\n\nIraqi-Israeli musician Yair Dalal is a prolific composer, violinist, and oud player dedicated to building bridges of music between the different cultures his heritage bound him to. Dalal was born in 1955 to Iraqi-born parents who had recently immigrated to Israel. He was raised in Israel on a kibbutz, and grew up studying violin in the Western mode. In 1982, a performance with Bedouin musicians in the Sinai led Dalal to look to his own heritage for musical inspiration. Dalal developed a synthesis of Arabic and Jewish sounds, and used his music to campaign for peace between the two cultures. The '90s saw numerous releases from Dalal, both as a soloist and with the Al Ol Ensemble. He continued to expand his musical language, drawing on the music of the desert and mixing its strings and melodies with instrumentation and influences from Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Dalal was also tireless peace advocate. In 1994, he performed in Oslo at a celebration to honor the first anniversary of the peace accords with a chorus of Palestinian, Israeli, and Norwegian children. The performance illustrated Dalal's commitment not only to the universal power of music, but to its ability to unite cultures and communities in strife. In 2002, he was nominated by the BBC World Service for a BBC Radio 3 World Music Award. While he did not take the award home, the nomination validated Dalal's work as both a musician and an advocate for peace.\n\nYehonatan Geffen is an Israeli poet, playwright, novelist, songwriter, narrator, journalist, art critic, satirist, commentator, and atranslator.
