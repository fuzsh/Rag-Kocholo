        "text": "An IRA killer, Frankie McGuire (Brad Pitt), is sent to New York where, under a false name, he is to buy weapons for use in Northern Ireland. A pro-IRA judge arranges for him to stay in the home of a local police officer (Harrison Ford), who knows nothing of McGuire’s true identity. Here, the two develop a bond, but trouble is not far away when Ford’s character begins to suspect his house-guest. 107 min, colour.\n\nBrad Pitt wanted to drop out of the production, but was threatened with a huge lawsuit (rumoured to be more than $60million). In the February 2, 1997, issue of Newsweek, Pitt called the film ‘a disaster’ and said that ‘it was the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking - if you can even call it that - that I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t believe it’. Rumors of discord on the set plagued the production. The original script was discarded and there were at least seven subsequent rewrites."
