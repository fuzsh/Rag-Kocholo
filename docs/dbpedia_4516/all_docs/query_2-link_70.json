        "text": "The Writers Guild of America announced the 2024 nominees for outstanding screenwriting this morning. The feature films eligible for WGA awards had some notable absences from the international side due to the guild’s strict rules for membership. Still, Oscar favorites American Fiction, Barbie, Oppenheimer, and Past Lives all earned nods.\n\nThis year’s nominations will be completely removed from the Oscar conversation, as nominations came out after the voting closed and will be awarded after the Oscar ceremony.
