He grew up in Georgetown, Texas and graduated from Baylor University with a BA in Film & Digital Media. Whether imagining elaborate tales with action figures as a kid, writing and directing parodies of The Lord of the Rings in high school (where he and his best friend played every character) or expanding his creative voice beyond screenwriting through improv courses at the Upright Citizens Brigade, James has only wanted to do one thing: tell stories. Having been raised on The Twilight Zone, he’s most drawn to stories that can entertain us on a large scale while also revealing something to us about what it means to be human.

Less than a month after graduating from the University of Miami almost 10 years ago, he took the plunge across the country to Los Angeles to pursue screenwriting. Not knowing where to start, he landed an internship at several production companies while tutoring kids on the weekends. Eventually, the stars aligned for an assistant position at a talent management company where he cut his teeth covering scripts for clients. He went on to other production companies and continued to plow through the weekend read, covering as many scripts as possible. He credits doing coverage as the single most helpful tool in learning how to write screenplays. He stayed inspired and motivated thanks to his supportive…\n\nRead More\n\nWinner Visitation by Helen Gaughran Helen Gaughran grew up in Dalkey, Co. Dublin, Ireland--the tiny hometown of James Joyce and George Bernard Shaw (who have also enjoyed modest writing success). There, she attended a castle-convent where she was taught Latin, discipline and a love of literature by nuns who could easily have played Bridge professionally. She graduated from an Irish university you’ve never heard of and moved to San Francisco, where she worked as a waitress until she won a green card in the lottery. (God bless America!) She proceeded to squander her good fortune by working in a raft of ad agencies, where she picked up a One Show pencil and a Clio (along with the urge to write something more personal and meaningful). Helen has written three other feature screenplays: Pop Psychology, The Patriot Test and The Domina Effect. She also won an all-Ireland medal for math at…\n\nRead More\n\nWinner Junior by Peter Malone Elliot Peter Malone Elliott is an award-winning screenwriter and playwright hailing from the great state of Virginia. Growing up in a house with a New York Times best-selling author, Peter always knew he wanted to write.
