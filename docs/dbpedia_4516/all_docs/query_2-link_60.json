        "text": "American Fiction completed the trifecta of an Oscar, BAFTA and now WGA win as Cord Jefferson took home the Writers Guild of America award for Best Adapted Screenplay at tonight’s WGA Awards, which were held in concurrent ceremonies in Los Angeles and New York. Jefferson was also recognized with the WGA’s Paul Sevlin Award.\n\nWithout competition from the Oscar original screenplay winner Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers took home the WGA award in that category for David Hemingson.\n\nOn television, Succession made its final awards bow with two wins from the Writers Guild of America (WGA), taking the awards for drama series and episodic drama for “Living+,” written by Georgia Pritchett and Will Arbery. Show creator Jesse Armstrong was on hand in New York to accept the award, while the show’s writers were also in Los Angeles to accept the honor.\n\nFollowing in line with the majority of television’s awards bodies, The Bear and Beef won comedy and limited series awards, respectively, but in episodic comedy The Bear‘s two nominated episodes – “Fishes” and “Forks” both lost out to Poker Face for the episode “Escape From Shit Mountain,” written by Nora Zuckerman & Lilla Zuckerman. The Last of Us won for new series.\n\nIn November, the WGA announced that they would postpone their awards until a month after the Oscars, in light of the writers strike last spring and summer. Niecy Nash-Betts hosted the LA ceremony at the Hollywood Palladium while New York’s Edison Ballroom was the home for the East Coast ceremony and hosted by Josh Gondelman.\n\nAmong the honorary awards given in Los Angeles, David A. Goodman and Chris Keyser received the Morgan Cox Guild Service Award, while Walter Hill received the Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement. Linda Bloodworth Thomason was honored with the Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement.\n\nIn New York, Ron Nyswaner received the Walter Bernstein Award and the Richard B. Jablow Award was given to the members and leadership of IATSE, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, SAG-AFTRA and American Federation of Musicians “for demonstrating unwavering support and sacrifice during the WGA’s 148-day strike.”\n\nHere is the complete list of winners of the 2024 Writers Guild of America (WGA) awards.\n\nORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nAir, Written by Alex Convery; Amazon MGM Studios\n\nBarbie, Written by Greta Gerwig & Noah Baumbach; Warner Bros.
