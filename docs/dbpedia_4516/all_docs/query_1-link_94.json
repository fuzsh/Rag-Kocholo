Rory tries to buy some weapons from dealer Billy Burke, while Tom has moral problems covering up his partner cop Edwin Diaz. The problems arise when Tom begins to suspect something about Rory’s identity\n\nTrivia & Facts:\n\n• Brad Pitt wanted to leave the production, but was threatened by a lawsuit. In the February 2, 1997, issue of Newsweek, Pitt called the film a “disaster”, and said that “it was the most irresponsible bit of filmmaking – if you can even call it that – that I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t believe it”. Rumors of fighting on the set (especially over which star would be the focus of the film) plagued the production. The original script was discarded and there were at least seven subsequent rewrites. Pitt said the final version was “a mess”. “The script that I had loved was gone,” he said. “I guess people just had different visions and you can’t argue with that. But then I wanted out and the studio head said, ‘All right, we’ll let you out, but it’ll be $63 million for starters.”‘\n\n• Alan J. Pakula’s final directed film.\n\n• Screenwriter Robert Mark Kamen was one of the original writers but was never credited.\n\n• Average Shot Length = ~4.8 seconds. Median Shot Length = ~4.6 seconds.\n\nFrom the gallery\n\nQuotes\n\n[Referring to the men who shot Rory’s father]\n\nTom O’Meara: Did they catch the fuckers?\n\nRory: They were the fuckers.\n\nRory: You’re a stupid man, Mr. Burke. You only see me standing between you and your money.\n\nYou’re forgetting about the thousand men standing behind me. That’s a mistake.\n\nTom O’Meara: What’s the money for? I was thinkin’ guns. I was thinkin’ IRA.\n\nRory: I need that money Tom!\n\nTom O’Meara: Why? So other eight-year-olds can watch their fathers gunned down in front of ’em?\n\nIf this money leaves here, more people will die. Can you tell me that won’t happen?\n\n[Looking at a dilapidated boat]\n\nRory: Here it is: the Irish Republican Navy.\n\nRory: All the same, Mr. Fitzsimmoms, if you’re not confused, you don’t know what’s goin’ on.\n\nRory: They say the word peace, but at the end of the day, all they want is surrender.\n\nRory: Don’t look for a happy ending. It’s not an American story. It’s an Irish one.\n\nAnnie O’Meara: Rory, are you married?\n\nRory: No.\n\nAnnie O’Meara: You marry me?\n\nRory: [laughs] I’ll have to ask your dad first.\n\nExternal Links\n\n…Official website\n\n…IMDB\n\nSB Store (US)\n\n…The Devil’s Own (DVD)\n\n…The Devil’s Own (Blu-ray)\n\n…The Devil’s Own: A Novel (Book)"
