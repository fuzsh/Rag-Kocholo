        "text": "The Writers Guild of America, which is bringing up the rear this awards season with an April 14 ceremony, has announced a lineup of nominees that includes “Barbie,” “Oppenheimer,” “American Fiction” and “The Holdovers.”\n\n“Air,” “Barbie,” “The Holdovers,” “May December” and “Past Lives” were nominated in the Best Original Screenplay category, while “American Fiction,” “Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret.,” “Killers of the Flower Moon,” “Nyad” and “Oppenheimer” were nominated in the Best Adapted Screenplay category.\n\nWhile four of the five original-screenplay nominees are also Oscar screenwriting nominees, the adapted-screenplay category looks dramatically different from the Academy’s, with only “American Fiction” and “Oppenheimer” making both lists.\n\nThat’s because two of the Oscar-nominated adapted screenplays, “Poor Things” and “The Zone of Interest,” were not on the ballot under WGA rules that restrict eligibility to films written under the guild’s Minimum Basic Agreement or a similar agreement from an affiliated international guild. A third Oscar nominee, “Barbie,” was deemed an original screenplay by the guild and nominated in that category, but classified as adapted by the Academy.\n\nOther screenplays ineligible for WGA Awards were the Oscar-nominated “Anatomy of a Fall,” the international films “All of Us Strangers,” “Society of the Snow” and “The Taste of Things” as well as the animated features “The Boy and the Heron” and “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.”\n\nThe nominations mean that “Barbie,” “The Holdovers,” “Killers of the Flower Moon” and “Oppenheimer” are the only films to be nominated by all four of the major Hollywood guilds, the Directors Guild, Producers Guild, Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild. “Poor Things” would no doubt have joined that list if it were eligible.\n\nIn the television categories, “Succession” and “The Bear” each received three nominations to lead all programs. “Succession” was nominated in the Drama Series category alongside “The Crown,” “The Curse,” “The Diplomat” and “The Last of Us,” and also took two nominations in the Episodic Drama category, which honors individual episodes.\n\n“The Bear” was nominated in the Comedy Series category with “Abbott Elementary,” “Barry,” “Jury Duty” and “Only Murders in the Building,” and also had two nominations for individual episodes.\n\nOther programs with multiple nominations included “The Diplomat,” “The Last of Us” and “Jury Duty,” which were recognized in the series categories and in the New Series category.\n\nThe Writers Guild is often the last of the four major guilds to hold its awards show, which generally takes place before the Oscars but after the DGA, PGA and SAG awards ceremonies. This year, though, the guild opted in the wake of the lengthy WGA strike to move the awards out of Oscar season, placing the show more than a month after the March 10 Academy Awards.\n\nHere is the full list of nominees.\n\nFILM NOMINEES\n\nORIGINAL SCREENPLAY\n\nAir, Written by Alex Convery; Amazon MGM Studios\n\nBarbie, Written by Greta Gerwig & Noah Baumbach; Warner Bros.
