        "text": "You may not know Aaron Cohen, but if you are a fan of sports documentaries you know of him. Ever watch ‘24/7” or “The Road To The Winter Classic” or some of the great “30 For 30” pieces on ESPN and marvel at the storytelling and how it comes together? That’s his work. A master writer whose work in sport is akin to what Aaron Sorkin has done for fictional series, there are few who can tell a story as well as Aaron Cohen. In a time of business where the art of storytelling is key to success, Cohen has literally and figuratively written the textbook on how to do it and do it well.\n\nWe caught up with Aaron to tell the story of how he tells stories (his bio follows)\n\nWhen writing a series, is there ever a time when you are NOT thinking about the script?\n\nThere definitely have to be times when I’m not thinking about the script – lots of times. This genre – let’s call it “narrated docu-reality sports television” – is very much a meld of picture and sound; one can’t exist without the other, one wouldn’t be as good without the other. In so many other genres – feature film, scripted television, plays – the script absolutely always comes first. Here, often, I am writing script based on picture that’s already been shot and (at least roughly) edited. So I think at its best, the script will respond to and interact with the rest of the material – the visuals, the sound and dialogue from the characters, etc. It’s not just my job to just write a great script; it’s my job to write a script that complements the rest of the show.\n\nWhat is your favorite project thus far?\n\nI’m not sure if this is simply difficult or actually impossible to answer. All projects present their own challenges, which lead to different kinds of satisfaction. Traditional documentaries are like a puzzle – you get handed an (hopefully) amazing story, and you have to determine the best way to present it. You work for months to do this, in a process that includes all kinds of overhauling, revising, and refining, and then you finish it. But because you know the story so well, and you’ve thought about it so much, if you’re a self-critical filmmaker and honest with yourself, the best that you can do is just hope that you did it right. Even if the reaction is positive (which, don’t get me wrong, is great), part of you is never sure – and resigned to that uncertainty. Contrast that with the quick-turnaround “docu-reality” I referenced above – when the challenge is much more of a fire drill, more high-pressured, more demanding over a shorter period of time. There’s barely any time to think about more than one way to tell a story – the process forces you to go with your instinct, and rely upon the quickest ideas to emerge. Even if these shows exhaust me while they’re in production, afterwards, I like the feeling of accomplishment they give me – of knowing how hard it was just to get anything on the air. And the hardest series I’ve done of this ilk are the hockey shows – the four-part series of hour-long episodes I’ve worked on at HBO and now Epix. The process is, well, somewhere between difficult and impossible. Which makes the result extremely satisfying. So in that sense, okay fine, they’re my favorite.\n\nHow did you come to writing for such series? Is it something you had thought about in school?\n\nI never knew exactly what I wanted to do when I grew up. I still feel like I don’t. But I liked journalism (media studies was the only “A” I got in four years of college, and I spent all my time working at the school paper anyway). Originally, I thought maybe I would want to write for Sports Illustrated, but the luck of the draw in the internship carousel kind of carried me to sports TV, where I discovered I liked the energy and constant collaborative atmosphere. I was fortunate to be mentored by one of the great writers in this business (Brian Brown), who kept me focused on valuing and trying to improve my writing. Then, I’d say it was a right place, right time thing in 2007 when HBO started the “24/7” series and Jason Hehir, one of the creators and first producers of the series, brought me in to work on the narration. I remember being really, really (and I’m being conservative with the “reallys”) when we found out Liev Schreiber agreed to narrate the series, and when it came to time to start writing the shows, I felt like it was kind of a “go big or go home” thing when it came to creating a voice and a style. Fortunately, no one’s asked me to go home yet.\n\nWho do you like to read?\n\nI read a ton of non-fiction magazine writing. The New Yorker, New York Magazine, Sports Illustrated, and then a ton of other things that I get wind of from “long read” lists and recommendations on Twitter and the like. I find that with my life (living in the city, working long hours, and having two young children at home), I need to have a system to get all that reading done. I use the “Pocket” app on my web browser, which basically allows you to save a link on all your devices – computer, phone, etc. And then I do most of my reading on the subway, on my phone. At this point, I’ve pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I won’t be able to read a lot of books, even though I wish I could.\n\nAny writers who you try to pattern yourself after?\n\nNot consciously. When I’m writing about a specific game or team, I actually try to limit my feature reading of the subject – I get a little paranoid about unwittingly cribbing ideas that I might see. So I try and start fresh. But I find that reading a lot of the material I mentioned above – the print (and, of course, web) magazine stuff – is a great way to constantly be inspired by brilliant writing, and the power that it can have over you.\n\nHave you sought out others who have done sports anthologies for advice?\n\nI’m not sure I would know who to go to. At least from my vantage point, it’s a pretty niche field, and there aren’t that many series of the types I work on – at least the kind that seem to put a real emphasis on narration writing. That said, having worked in other parts of the business – namely big live events like the Olympics – I’ve made great friends with some other writers, and it’s a terrific experience to work alongside them, as opposed to the series, where (so far) I’ve always been a lone writer.\n\nWhat is the toughest part of writing these series, virtually in real time?\n\nWriting the opens and closes, which are typically in essay form and based on themes that need to sustain themselves and be original and compelling. In a four-part series, that could be as many as eight pieces – eight ideas to brainstorm, develop, and script. Actually, I would say that my biggest ally is a deadline – I’ve learned that being up against it forces me to focus and do some of my best work.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing more, longer lead documentaries or the week to week series?\n\nI think my answer in your earlier question might indicate that I like the week-to-week series better – but really, I enjoy them both. If I only did the week-to-week series, I think I’d burn out. The longer lead documentaries can be laboratories where the constant rewriting makes you better. And that puzzle I talked about – trying to figure out how to tell a big story – is a ton of fun to tackle, particularly with a great director (and I’ve been fortunate to have worked with so many). So in a perfect year, I like to be working on both.\n\nIf you hit a dry spell, anything you do to break it up?\n\nI try to have faith in my own process. I mentioned the difficulty of writing opens and closes in a series. Ultimately, the product I produce for a given piece might be 250 words max. That’s not very long at all, which means that a lot of the writing process is going to be spent brainstorming and developing. And it can be hard for me to just sit there at the screen and keep, well, thinking. So I try and stay relaxed and don’t beat myself up if I find myself procrastinating on the Internet or getting a cup of tea or whatever. Sometimes I’ll switch it up and work with a pen and notebook instead of my computer. Other times I’ll just force myself to type out every single thought that comes into my head. A 200-word close would typically take up less than a page – but often, my working word document gets to be 10 or 12 pages of notes and abandoned ideas.\n\nWhat is the best advice you have been given as a writer, and, in a world where we are driven to sound bites, what advice can you give to young people looking to write professionally?\n\nI would say that the best advice was very simple. Armen Keteyian, the great reporter, once told me to “Always write big.” And what I took that to mean was to take chances, and to try and be great. As far as advice I’d give to young people, I would repeat that, but I would also go back a step and just tell them to simply write as much as they can. If they’re students, write for their school newspaper or magazine. If they’re out of school and looking to get into writing, start blogging, or even just keep a journal. The more you write, the more comfortable you get as a writer, and the better you get as a writer. And of course reading is important, too – read great things that will inspire you to write.\n\nAbout Aaron Cohen\n\nAaron Cohen is a television writer and producer who has won eighteen Emmys and a Peabody Award for his work, receiving the Dick Schaap Award for Outstanding Writing three times.
