The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:00 a.m., in Room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, the Honorable James Oberstar [Chairman of the Committee] presiding. Mr. Oberstar. The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will come to order. The purpose of today's hearing is a very serious and deeply felt need to establish a record on the need for continuation of the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. The DBE program was established by regulation in 1980, following the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It has been expanded and adjusted and adapted through a series of four highway and aviation reauthorization legislative initiatives, the purpose of which have been to correct past discrimination, current discrimination against minority, against women-owned businesses to ensure they have equal opportunity to compete for Federal funds in our highway, transit, and airport programs. Major infrastructure investments as the ones we make in aviation and surface transportation program are important sources of revenue to local construction and engineering firms. But for very long, a very, very long time, disadvantaged and minority-owned businesses were not to win portions of those big contracts because of barriers to entry in the sector. They were unable to compete with larger firms who were bidding on these projects. And that is why there was need for the Minority Business Enterprise program. In 1980, I said it was a regulatory initiative to establish such a program under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1983, there was legislation enacted to establish a national 10 percent aspirational participation goal for firms certified as DBEs for surface transportation programs, for Federal aid to airports for procurement, for construction, for professional services contracts, and for airport concessionaires. The regulations of DOT require beneficiaries of Federal aid--State and local transportation agencies and airport operators--to establish annual aspirational DBE participation goals that reflect their participation and reflect what participation would be in the absence of discrimination. And that is for prime contracts of more than $250,000. Now, it is important to understand that technical term. The recipient's goal is aspirational only. Quotas and set-asides are not permitted. Recipients are required to use race-neutral means to meet as much of their overall goal as possible: providing help for bonding, financing, unbundling large contracts to make them more accessible to small businesses, establishing informational programs on contracting procedures, programs to inform small business enterprises on specific contract opportunities. But, if a recipient is unable to meet, if a large contractor or the agency contracting is unable to meet its overall DBE participation goal through race-neutral means, then that beneficiary, that agency must establish contract goals, which are deemed race conscious, for DBE participation. So that, in technical real-world terms, means that the recipient has determined that without the use of race-conscious measures, minority-and women-owned businesses would not have an adequate opportunity to participate in these contracts. The DBE program has faced a number of legal and legislative challenges, but I am very satisfied and very pleased that, with the work that we have done in this Committee over a number of years, the program has withstood those challenges. In 1995, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in the Adarand v. Pena case, which everyone knows is the Adarand case, that a race-conscious programs were subject to a strict scrutiny standard of legal review. That gave us a lot of headaches in the TEA-21 legislation. And we have as our lead witness one of those who had the biggest headache, among others, Eleanor Holmes Norton of this Committee, Maxine Waters, who was of great counsel, Eddie Bernice Johnson, now Chair of our Water Resources Subcommittee. All of us counseled together and Mr. Clyburn, then a Member of the Committee, with his resonant voice, was able to bring everybody together. He doesn't need a gavel; he just needs to speak. So that ruling required that all affirmative action programs be ``narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.'' That sent everybody scurrying. How do we narrowly tailor? What do we establish as a compelling government interest? The DOT tried to address that with new regulations to ensure non-discrimination, and every court since then that has reviewed DOT regulations has found them to be constitutional. Now, our Committee has compiled volumes of evidence, actual and word-of-mouth, case-by-case, that discrimination continues to adversely affect minority-and women-owned businesses across the Country. And these data demonstrate that there is a significant difficulty remaining for small and disadvantaged businesses to compete. If we can expand access to Federal contracts, and have much greater, much more expansive Federal program that will go in the range of $450 billion to $500 billion over the next six years, then we are going to be doing something really significant for the minority community in this Country. Make them full partners in reducing congestion, improving mobility, and keeping America competitive. To keep America competitive, all have to be able to compete, and that is where this legislation comes in. We on this Committee have supported the continuation of DBE in both Democratic majorities and Republican majorities, although it was a pretty tough negotiation and an intense conference between the House and Senate in 1998 that I want to say Mr. Clyburn played a very, very pivotal role. I am grateful for your contribution, Mr. Clyburn. Mr. Oberstar. Mr. Petri? Mr. Petri. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for calling today's hearing to review the Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, or DBE, program. It is important that we review the status of and the need for these programs on a regular basis. It has been over 25 years since Congress created these programs, which were intended to increase participation in federally-assisted State and local contracts by small businesses owned and controlled by disadvantaged individuals. It is an admirable goal and I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses as to the progress that we have made toward its realization. Three Department of Transportation administrations, including the FAA, oversee DBE programs. Allowing fair competition for airport construction projects and airport concession contracts is clearly important. It is a goal I support as long as it is determined that there is a compelling need for the program and as long as the program is conducted in a fair, transparent, and legal way. I look forward to hearing from the Department of Transportation and the aviation and airport representatives on the status of the DBE programs in the aviation sector. Given the current state of the economy and its particular impact on the airline and airport industry, I am interested in learning how the program is assisting small businesses to compete for newly funded airport improvement projects. Likewise, I look forward to learning more about how the airport concession program is working post-9/11 and during these very, very trying times. Again, I would like to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this hearing and our witnesses for taking the time to join us today, and particularly someone I admire a great deal, my friend, the Majority Whip from the State of South Carolina, Jim Clyburn, who is kicking things off for this hearing. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar. Thank you very much, Mr. Petri. I might add Mr. Mica is at a meeting, a roundtable discussion with handicapped persons in our Subcommittee hearing room. I just left that meeting a few moments ago, and he will join the hearing later on. I would like to ask unanimous consent that Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, in due course, be allowed to sit on the dais, but not to ask questions or to make comments as the hearing proceeds. Without objection, so ordered. Mr. Clyburn, please proceed. I will ask other Members to withhold comments because we are going to have votes fairly soon, unless the Whip changes that schedule. [Laughter.] STATEMENT OF HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA Mr. Clyburn. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Petri, other Members of the Committee. Thank you all so much for allowing me to be a part of this process here today. I am very honored and pleased to appear before you today. As a former Member of this Committee, I know firsthand the significance of the many programs and various matters that fall within your jurisdiction. I am also aware and stand in awe of the tremendously positive impact this Committee's work has on our Country. I want to discuss with you today one of those various matters that is of great importance and concern not only to me personally, but I believe to our Nation as a whole, and that is the issue of effectively confronting historical inequities occurring in our Nation's transportation industries. The hearing today focuses on the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise, DBE, programs authorized by Congress and administered by the Department of Transportation. As the Committee is aware, the Department of Transportation DBE programs apply to airports and surface transportation. They have been enacted by Congress to address historic discrimination against minority-owned firms in transportation and to ensure that minority-and women-owned businesses have a fair opportunity to participate in contracting opportunities made possible by Federal financial assistance. Mr. Chairman, the word discrimination is a tough term. It conjures up images of past times and past acts that many people would like to forget. Any discussion of it makes many people uncomfortable. In this regard, I am reminded of the debate that ensued when Attorney General Holder observed essentially the same point last month. Mr. Chairman and Members of this Committee, although an uncomfortable discussion at times, it is absolutely essential that we, as Members of Congress and as citizens, be willing to talk about the continuing challenges that racial and gender discrimination and, for that matter, other forms of discrimination raises for public policy. This Committee has demonstrated on a bipartisan basis its commitment to fairness and to tackling this issue, and for this reason I commend you for holding this hearing today. Mr. Chairman, sometimes I hear pundits argue that there is no current need for the DOT DBE programs. They reason that times have changed and that America is much more enlightened than when the first statutory DBE program was enacted back in 1983 during the Reagan Administration. Critics and opponents often argue that the DBE programs are legally or constitutionally suspect. However, despite such assertions, it is my strong belief that discrimination is still a problem, that DOT DBE programs remain necessary, and that the programs are constitutionally sound. Mr. Chairman, it is true times for minority and women entrepreneurs have improved from what they were when the first DBE programs were enacted. Although I readily acknowledge and celebrate these improvements, I also know that it does not mean that discriminatory conduct has ended. Indeed, there are numerous academic and statistical studies demonstrating the lingering effects of past discrimination and that there are ongoing incidences of racial discrimination. Equally compelling are the anecdotal stories that I hear from minority and women businesses in my congressional district and from around the Country. For the most part, these entrepreneurs have to find ways in which to persevere and to overcome. Some are successful and some are not. I also urge the Committee to keep in mind that discrimination can be both direct and indirect. Either method is just as harmful and just as wrong. For example, beyond the denial of a contract, discriminatory practices can be evident in how a contract is structured. It is in the eligibility criteria for the work, in quotes for materials from suppliers, in the practices of prime contractors towards subcontractors, or in credit or bonding determinations. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I speak to this issue from personal experiences. For more than 17 years, immediately before coming to this body, I supervised the investigations of thousands of these cases in my native State of South Carolina. I did so under four governors, to Democrats and two Republicans. Many of those cases had no merit. But, unfortunately, many of them did. The academic and statistical studies and stories of individual entrepreneurs are poignant and painful reminders to us as legislators that progress is not a reasonable justification, or legal or moral, to stop combating inequities and discrimination. Although we should acknowledge and celebrate the fact that the policies that were first developed in this Committee have helped minority-and women-owned firms participate in the transportation industry, we should also understand that there is ongoing work required if the playing field is going to become truly level. Earlier, I mentioned that the term discrimination makes a lot of people feel uneasy. Perhaps this is particularly understandable for airport owners, State DOT officials, transit agencies and the like whose leaders are committed to inclusion, who truly engage in good faith efforts for DBE participants, and who fully comply with Federal DBE participation goal requirements. To these leaders I tell you that your commitment is understood and appreciated, and your accomplishments are noted. Further, I urge you to understand that congressional efforts redress continuing barriers to participation in no way diminishes your good work. To my way of thinking, it is quite the opposite. Your efforts represent a model of best practices that should be emulated. Mr. Chairman, while addressing discrimination and working to ensure fairness is the right policy, this Committee should not overlook the clear economic case for inclusion and diversity. Our Nation suffers when those who are talented, who have new ideas, and who want to work hard are denied the opportunity to compete because of their ethnic background, race, or gender. Mr. Chairman, before closing, I want to say a word about the constitutional soundness of the DOT DBE programs. I mentioned previously the DBE programs are intended to remedy discrimination in order to make it possible for all firms to have a fair chance to participate in the business opportunities arising from Federal transportation spending. The DOT DBE statutes and regulations have been carefully crafted and narrowly tailored to meet the rigorous, strict scrutiny constitutional standards established by the United States Supreme Court in the Adarand decision in 1995. In fact, all of the full United States Circuit Courts of Appeal that have considered the constitutionality of the DOT DBE programs since Adarand and new regulations put in place after that decision have found that the program is constitutional. This conclusion has been affirmed by the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th Circuits. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I want to share with you a very personal experience. A few days after being appointed to run the work training programs for Charleston County, South Carolina, I received a phone call from a Mrs. Rowena Tobias, someone I knew only by reputation and the society pages in the local newspapers. She invited me to her home on Charleston's South Battery, where the two of us spent the better part of an hour reflecting on Charleston's history. She shared with me the fact that Charleston was once the leading economic engine on the Country's East Coast. Whenever there were problems, she said, people would sit down to talk and work their way through them, except for one. She said to me on that day that Charleston lost its standing because whenever the issue of race came up, people would stop talking. She told me that we are not going to be able to work our way through the issues of race if we continue to stop talking whenever the subject came up. She asked me to promise her that I would never stop talking until we solve this very important problem. Mr. Chairman, I commend you and this Committee for reviewing and discussing the DOT's DBE programs and the issues of discrimination and fairness, and I thank you for allowing me another opportunity to continue keeping the promise I made to Mrs. Rowena Tobias over 40 years ago. Thank you so much for allowing me to be here, and I will answer any questions you may have. Mr. Oberstar. Mr. Whip, thank you very much for that very compelling, powerful, and moving statement. Mr. Clyburn. I want. Mr. Oberstar. Is Ms. Tobias still---- Mr. Clyburn. No, she is no longer with us, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Oberstar. We will keep your promise to her. We will never stop talking---- Mr. Clyburn. I appreciate it. Mr. Oberstar.--about race---- Mr. Clyburn. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar.--about its effect. It may be a different color, but I remember as a kid going out looking for jobs when I was in high school, and you would go to the mining companies and they would say bohunks need not apply. It has the same effect. They can tell by your name, if not by your skin color. Mr. Clyburn. Absolutely. Mr. Oberstar. Mr. Petri, do you have any comments? Mr. Petri. No. Mr. Oberstar. I think we will thank you for your testimony and for your participation, and I will always remember in the markup the conference in 1998 on the TEA-21 legislation, when just having Jim Clyburn at the table, having him say his name and shake his head was enough to confirm the House position on minority business enterprise issues in that legislation. Mr. Clyburn. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your kindness, and I thank Mr. Petri for his long friendship. He is one of the people that I really admire a whole lot, and I want him to know that the counsel he gave to me during those trying times will never be forgotten. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar. There are a series of votes on the floor, the nine minutes remaining; 420 have not yet voted, so there is plenty of time. We will continue with the next panel and at least let them get started, and that will be beginning with Joel Szabat, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy, accompanied by Mr. Robert Ashby, Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and Enforcement; Dr. Jon Wainwright, Vice President for NERA Economic Consulting; Chuck Covington, Chief Executive Officer, People's Transit; Ms. Katherine Cloonen, President and Owner of JK Steel Erectors; K. Dennis Kim, President of EVS; Mr. Gilbert Aranza, Chief Executive Officer, Star Concessions; Mr. Anthony Thompson, President and CEO, Kwame Building Group, Incorporated. We will begin Deputy Assistant Secretary Szabat. It is probably Hungarian, Szabat. Mr. Szabat. Almost, sir. It is Polish. Mr. Oberstar. Polish. Close, but not related. Hungarians are a different ethnic origin than Poles. Mr. Szabat. And nothing but respect for them, sir. [Laughter.] Mr. Oberstar. Well, they are neighbors to my ancestral land of Slovenia. I read your testimony and read it twice last night, and I thank you for the thoroughness of the presentation, the excellent examples that you provided, and for the very substantive contribution it makes to the purpose of this hearing. Please proceed, summarize your statement. After Mr. Szabat's presentation, we will recess for votes and reconvene immediately thereafter. TESTIMONY OF THE HONORABLE JOEL SZABAT, ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR TRANSPORTATION POLICY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, ACCOMPANIED BY ROBERT C. ASHBY, DEPUTY ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL FOR REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION; DR. JON S. WAINRIGHT, VICE PRESIDENT, NERA ECONOMIC CONSULTING; CHUCK COVINGTON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PEOPLE'S TRANSIT; KATHERINE M. CLOONEN, PRESIDENT AND OWNER, JK STEEL ERECTORS, INC.; K. DENNIS KIM, PRESIDENT, EVS, INC.; GILBERT ARANZA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STAR CONCESSIONS, LTD.; AND ANTHONY THOMPSON, PRESIDENT AND CEO, KWAME BUILDING GROUP, INC. Mr. Szabat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members, and thank you for inviting the U.S. Department of Transportation here today to review the status of our---- Mr. Oberstar. Turn that microphone closer to you. Mr. Szabat.--to review the status of our Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program. I am Joel Szabat, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Transportation Policy. Joining me today is Bob Ashby, our Deputy Assistant General Counsel for Regulation and the man, as much as anyone, sir, who is responsible for the detailed information that was provided in our written testimony. The Department of Transportation has a proud record of reaching out to work with small and minority businesses. We send twice as much of our business to small businesses as a typical Federal agency. Over 40 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's direct contracting dollars go to small businesses, and the rest of the Department finds small businesses suitable for over half of our contract work. The DBE program is even more important to minority-owned firms in the transportation field, providing them with an equal opportunity to participate in over $30 billion worth of DOT- assisted highway, transit, and airport contracts each year. In fiscal year 2008, DBEs were awarded $3.3 billion, or 11 percent of DOT's total assisted contracting. Additionally, this year the Recovery Act entrusted $48.1 billion to the Department of Transportation. Over $35 billion of these monies will be provided through assisted contracts covered by the DBE program, creating another $3 billion to $4 billion in job-creating business opportunities for DBEs. Transportation's DBE program works. As Chairman Oberstar and Congressman Clyburn have already noted, every Federal court that has examined our rule has agreed it is constitutional. The program is narrowly tailored to redress the continuing effects of discrimination. There are no quotas or set-asides. Goals are set based on evidence and no one is sanctioned or loses a business opportunity just for failing to hit a number. There is powerful evidence of the continuing compelling need for the DBE program. Recipients can set race conscious goals for DBEs only when they conclude, based on the evidence, that racial neutral measures alone cannot create a nondiscriminatory market for DBEs. From 2004 to 2008, recipients found it necessary to use race conscious goals 81 percent of the time. Without this tool, they could not have properly addressed the effects of discrimination. A 2005 Federal court decision drove this point home by demonstrating the debilitating effect of denying the use of race conscious goals. This decision barred jurisdictions on the West Coast from using race conscious measures until they had conducted disparity studies. Despite the use of race neutral measures by assisted contract recipients, DBE participation declined in 7 of the 9 affected States, 18 of 28 airport districts, and 7 of 9 transit authorities over the three year period. Disparity studies are providing important statistical evidence of the presence and effects of discrimination in the marketplace. These studies paint an indelible picture of a nationwide problem not limited to any particular minority group or any region of the Country. Disparity studies also collect firsthand stories of how discrimination affects individuals trying to compete on an uneven playing field. With your permission, the Department will submit summaries of statistical and anecdotal evidence in our additional material for the record. Mr. Oberstar. Without objection, that information will be received and included in the record at this point, following your testimony. Mr. Szabat. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The anecdotal and survey information provided by disparity studies illustrates a continuing barrier to participation encountered by DBEs; that a lack of access to the informal network of communication and relationships that are crucial to success in the contracting business. Most of us depend on a network of trusted friends and colleagues for advice and recommendations. Unfortunately, in the world of contracting, as in elsewhere, those networks frequently are limited to people of the same race or gender. Possibly the most important function our program performs is to help correct this lack of access. When there is a race conscious goal in a contract, primes must make good faith efforts to contact qualified DBE firms whose owners may not be part of their normal networks. This process creates business relationships that lead to opportunities for DBEs, and our data shows that this process has been successful where other good faith efforts have failed. The information we have submitted to the Committee for the record demonstrates a clear, compelling, continuing, nationwide need for the DBE program. Within DOT, we are continually working to improve the program to meet this need. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members. Mr. Ashby and I will be happy to respond to any questions you may have. Mr. Oberstar. And we will come back to the rest of the panel. There are two minutes remaining on this vote. We will all have to leave for the House floor and reconvene as quickly as possible after the last vote. The Committee will resume its sitting and the Chair can confidently announce there will be no more interruptions from the House floor. The last votes have occurred. Now we will proceed with the hearing and thank Secretary Szabat for his presentation. Mr. Ashby, you are next. You are not speaking separately, Mr. Ashby? Mr. Ashby. No, sir. I am in the capacity of assisting with answering questions that you may have. Mr. Oberstar. You are support services for---- Mr. Ashby. Exactly, sir. Mr. Oberstar. All right. Okay. Very good. Dr. Wainwright. Mr. Wainwright. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Guthrie, other members of the Committee. Thank you for your invitation to appear here today. My name is Jon Wainwright. I am a Vice President with NERA Economic Consulting. I hold a doctorate in economics from the University of Texas at Austin. With the Committee's permission, I would like to include my written testimony in the record as if read in full. Since 1989, I have devoted my professional life to studying race and sex discrimination and its impact on business enterprise. I have served as the project director or principal investigator for over 40 studies of business discrimination. I have authored a book on the subject and have provided expert testimony in Federal and State courts on these and related matters. The primary bulwark against business discrimination has been the use of public sector purchasing power to promote fair and full access to government contracting opportunities for minority-and women-owned businesses, and to mitigate the impact of such discrimination in the private sector. The USDOT DBE program is a key example of such policies at the Federal level. Because the DBE program is subject to the strictest standard of constitutional scrutiny, it is important that any DBE studies used to assess discrimination and to assess the presence of DBEs in the transportation sector are of high quality, independent and objective, academically rigorous, and incorporate as much relevant evidence as possible. It is also important that DBE studies be carried out by economic and statistical experts who can be qualified in Federal court to testify regarding their data, methods, and findings if called upon to do so. In 1999, Congress reviewed and revised the DBE program's authorizing statute and implementing regulations. As already mentioned, every court that has considered the issue has found the DBE regulations to be constitutional on their face. Whether USDOT grant recipients can withstand an as-applied challenge, however, turns at least in part on whether they went to court prepared with a high quality DBE study and an expert to testify about it. For example, when the DBE programs in Minnesota and Illinois were challenged, such studies played important roles in successfully defending the constitutionality of the programs applied by each agency. In contrast, when the program at Washington State was challenged, no study or expert was proffered at all. As a result, the 9th Circuit lacked the benefit of any guidance on the correct economic analysis of discrimination and made several serious errors as a result. Although unrelated to the USDOT DBE program, a similar situation recently occurred in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in the Rothe case, concerning the DoD program for small disadvantaged businesses. Here again, the defendants proffered no study of their own, nor an expert to testify about such a study, and once again the court made several serious errors in its economic reasoning, concluding, for example, that factors such as firm size should be factored into study estimates of DBE availability. Since 2000, I have directed 16 studies at NERA where one or more of the participating entities was a State Department of Transportation, transit authority, or airport. With the Committee's permission, I would like to provide copies of these studies for the record. The studies span the Country. Of the 75 Members in this Committee, 50 hail from States represented in the studies submitted. Despite their geographic diversity, the study findings show much more similarity than difference. DBEs throughout the Nation continue to face large disparities in almost every aspect of business activity that can be quantified. It is fair to ask whether these disparities result primarily from discrimination or from other factors. Our DBE studies have put such questions to the test using the most recent available data. Our studies find that even when other nondiscriminatory attributes are held constant, the disparities between DBEs and non-DBEs tend to remain large, adverse, and statistically significant. In addition to statistical evidence, we have conducted thousands of surveys and hundreds of in-person interviews with DBEs and non-DBEs alike, and the results are strikingly similar across the Country and across different industries. There is general agreement that without the use of affirmative remedies such as the DBE program, these firms would receive few opportunities on government contracts, as is the case on public contracts without goals, and especially in the private sector. Our studies' findings strongly suggest a continuing need for the USDOT DBE program to help remedy the ill effects of business discrimination in the transportation sector. The economic consequences of that program are significant. It has improved economic opportunities for minorities and women in business, and thereby improved the overall competitiveness and efficiency of the American economy. Thank you. I would be glad to answer any questions. Mr. Oberstar. Thank you very much, Dr. Wainwright. Those are very compelling statistics and reports that you cited in your testimony. We will come back to that later. And the information you requested will be received for the hearing and perhaps, depending on the volume of the documentation, included in the hearing record at this point. If it is too voluminous, it will be included in the Committee files. Mr. Covington. Mr. Covington. Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Oberstar. Please put your microphone on, please. Mr. Covington. Good morning, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Chuck Covington, and I am the President and CEO of People's Transit in Detroit, Michigan. My company provides vehicles and crews for ground transportation, including Detroit Metropolitan Airport. Thank you for the chance to talk about the airport DBE program. Small and minority businesses are the backbone of this Country. Without the DBE program, big business would steam roll right over us. I believe that tendency is partially responsible for the economic trouble we face today. One thing is clear: small minority businesses are not the ones that have brought our Nation's financial system to the brink. I have dealt with discrimination my entire life, and I still deal with it. Last year, one of my employees receive a quote on new tires. The supplier quoted us more than $613 for each tire. I called a white business associate and learned that he had only paid $400 per tire for the same tires, from the same supplier. My employee who obtained the original quote has what might be described as an ethnic sounding voice. So I used a white voice, called the tire supplier, and got the $400 price. When asked why we had initially been given the higher price, nothing the supplier said justified the actions. A 50 percent markup on one of the most basic supplies in my business puts me at a huge disadvantage. Today's business climate is tough, and it has been tough in Michigan for years. No business person can succeed if they are paying a race-based markup on supplies. Some other examples are important. Even those of us who have accumulated wealth, for instance, equity in our homes, face more difficulty getting loans than similarly situated white entrepreneurs. Housing discrimination is real. Early in my career I responded to an ad for an apartment, but when I showed up, I was told that the apartment had been rented. I knew what was going on, but I had my white secretary call and inquire. She was told the unit was still available. Housing discrimination matters, because, for many minority businesses, our homes represent our best source of collateral. Given Congress's investigations, you know that minorities pay higher mortgage rates. We also pay higher business loan rates, if we can get them. As long as housing and lending discrimination persists, minority business owners will be at a disadvantage. Sadly, I have to deal with bigoted business people. Not long ago, I was sued by a white subcontractor. We resolved the case to my advantage, and later I heard that outside the courtroom the CEO that sued me had said that he never believed that N word and his Jew lawyer would take the case so far. That slur says nothing against me, but it says a lot about the person that used it. One thing that it tells me is that I still have to work harder than the majority of business owners to succeed. Unfortunately, the good ol' boy network still exists. Breaking into that network is critical. I have seen situations in which unqualified majority firms were hired over me. In a recent job involving shuttle services at a local mall, my bid was rejected and a non-minority firm was hired. I was brought in as a subcontractor and my drivers frequently had to manage the job and fill in when the prime's drivers did not show up. I was paid the same price that I had originally quoted the mall. I was more qualified; my price was fair; so why didn't I get the prime contract? I believe it has to do with the networks. I serve in many public service and civic roles in my hometown, Van Buren Township, Belleville, Michigan. In these roles, I sometimes attend events at a local private club called the Eagles Club, one of the main places that business people in my area network. But the Eagles Club has an unwritten rule: African-Americans cannot be members. It sickens me that this club in my community would exclude me and my daughters because of our race. And this also impacts my business. If business people do business with those with whom they are comfortable, how am I supposed to succeed if I can't even join the club where they socialize? The current DBE program helps enormously. Still, the program can be improved. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the provisions already included in H.R. 915 to improve certification training and adjust the personal net worth cap for inflation. I believe that the DBE program should also be extended beyond AIP funds to include TSA and PFC funding. The discrimination that DBEs face is not limited by funding source, and other efforts to end discrimination should not be limited either. Thank you again for the opportunity to speak here today. I would be happy to take any questions you might have. Thank you very much for that very powerful testimony. I appreciate your being here. We will return to that theme later. Ms. Cloonen. Ms. Cloonen. Good morning. Thank you for inviting me to testify. My name is Katherine Cloonen. I am President and Owner of JK Steel Erectors, a small construction company. I started the company in 1991. We specialize in rebar and wire mesh installation in concrete and structural steel erection for transportation and other projects. The geographical area we cover is the rural area south and west of Chicago, Illinois. JK Steel Erectors is certified as a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise with the Illinois Department of Transportation. I was certified by IDOT in November of 2000. This testimony will be on three issues: one, the difference the DBE program has made; two, the discrimination I have faced; three, why the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program needs to remain. The difference the DBE program has made is dramatic. Since being certified, my sales have more than quadrupled. Before being certified, there was a lack of opportunity. Very few prime contractors used me. I was limited to a very small geographic radius and could not expand. I could not get my foot in the door. In many cases, smaller companies are not given a chance by the larger companies unless they are certified as a DBE. Certification helps JK Steel and companies like mine increase in size. Once we are in the program, we are able to bid on larger jobs, get better bonding, get better loans, and purchase more equipment. The certification has given JK Steel Erectors exposure. Being certified doesn't guarantee a job, but it does open doors. I still have to be the low bidder. Discrimination has been, and still is, a factor for women and minorities in the construction business. I will illustrate a few examples. One company called and, instead of giving me an invitation to bid, the man asked if I wanted to make more money and he gave me an invitation to a meeting to sell health and beauty products for a pyramid company. I told him that if I had to sell his company's products in order to be a subcontractor for him, I would not do it. I have not done any business with that company since then. Another instance of discrimination is that there are companies that will not do construction business with a female. I sent one of my male employees to negotiate a job and to be a project manager with such a company. When the owner understood that I had the day-to-day control, he never asked me again for another quote. Often, I will get a call asking for the person in charge of estimating, and I say that I am that person, and then the caller hangs up. Once in a while the person says, well, I want the boss or the man in charge, and I say I am the boss, I am the man in charge; and I still hear a click on the other end of the phone. I was not taken seriously by contractors or union business agents. Women are not afforded the networking opportunities that men are allowed, and without the DBE program many prime contractors just would not hire me. The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program needs to remain in the Department of Transportation. Even though I am now certified, I still have to prove myself on a day-to-day basis, and we are rated in several categories. It is not enough for the State of Illinois to say that I am qualified to do the work; I have to be low bidder for the steel and rebar on the project. We have to perform in a timely manner according to the IDOT specifications and turn in all the required documentation. I am responsible for several people's wages, benefits, and tax burdens. Small businesses, including women-and minority-owned businesses, are the driving force in the United States economy. It is vital that, as the big companies merge, the smaller companies such as the DBE companies remain to help fuel the local communities. This is particularly true of areas away from the urban regions, where there is still a lack of true diversity. If women and minorities were not a part of the DBE program, our companies would not get jobs just because some contractors feel that we are incapable of running a construction company on a day-to-day basis. Our businesses would take a backwards step to the struggles of where we were before we were certified. We are simply asking for the opportunity to bid and receive projects without bias. I am grateful for the DBE program. Being certified with IDOT has given my company credibility. I am a director on the board of Associated General Contractors of Illinois. I serve on the Ironworkers Mid-America Pension Plan, and I am a trustee on the Ironworkers Local 444 Joint Apprenticeship Training Committee. These appointments would not have happened without the DBE program. For these reasons, the DBE program should remain a part of the Department of Transportation. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. Mr. Oberstar. Well, thank you for the courage to speak forthrightly about your experiences. We will come back to that testimony. Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. My name is Dennis Kim. I am the President of EVS, Incorporated. EVS is an engineering company in the Twin Cities, Minnesota. As you know, Minnesota is Mr. Chairman's home State. I came to Minnesota in 1969 from South Korea. I attended the University of Minnesota when I arrived. Oftentimes, people ask me why do you still live in Minnesota when it is so cold. As you know, it can go down to 20 or 30 below zero. Usually, I answer that it is cold, we got frozen in Minnesota. So I joined EVS when there were four people at the company, hoping some day I can become a successful business man. In 1982 I took over EVS. One of the ways to grow the business was to get involved in government contracting, so in 1984 I obtained a DBE certification. It was time-consuming, also a difficult process. Currently, we have 22 employees, with an annual revenue of $2.5 million to $3 million. We are civil engineers land surveyors working on infrastructure projects. I am proud of what I do as a small business person. In 1990, we designed four lake dams in Minnesota, which was a finalist for American Society Civil Engineers award for excellent engineering work. We also designed the decision driving course at Dakoma Technical College in the Twin Cities. The driving course is still being used to train police officers, firefighters, and commercial truck drivers. This project also received an outstanding award from another engineering group. On a personal level, because I am from Korea, I eat Korean food. Some of you may know kimchi as supposed to be very good, healthy food, but it is also stinky. So people think it is really stinky because there is a lot of garlic in it. As you know, a lot of medical studies show garlic is good for our health. But, anyway, you know, people complain about the smell, so I have to mask the smell, so I have to brush and use mouthwash and drink milk, because I read somewhere drinking milk will mask stinky smell. Nobody has proved it yet, but I still try. I want to talk about one instance which made me humiliated as a small business owner. In 1998, I first learned of a subcontracting opportunity with a white owned company. It was a highway design project with Rochester District of Minnesota Department of Transportation. The company was successful in winning the contract. The contract was to design several miles of highway. EVS was chosen as a subcontractor because we had contacted that company about this project. Also, there was a requirement of DBE requirement. However, the project was delayed over a year because the scope of the project had been expanded after the contract was awarded, then there had been a number of issues with the project, including expanding the scope of work, delay of the work, and other engineering problems. In 2003, I was summoned to a meeting in Rochester. When I walked in, there were three people in the room from the company and DOT. They were all while male Caucasians. I was told that I was at fault for the many problems with the project. Then they kicked me off the project, even with my protest. Later on, they hired another subcontractor owned by a Caucasian male. I felt that their reason for unfairly targeting me in this way is that I am Asian-American. They would not have done this to me if I were Caucasian. That is what I thought. I did not complain to anyone about this because I was afraid of retaliation, and I did not want to be labeled as another minority contractor whining because I have enough comments about some people saying many DBEs complain without any good reason. Later on I learned we were blacklisted anyway because, when I tried to get the project, we were not successful. I welcome the opportunity to do more work with the Minnesota DOT. In particular, I am excited about the stimulus package for infrastructure and reasonable energy projects. Since stimulus dollars have been available, I contacted the Minnesota DOT about the new opportunities. I noticed that they became a lot more friendlier, and I hope this will continue. I really help that my story will motivate you to not only reauthorize the DBE program, but to improve it. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar. Thank you very much for your testimony. Your comments about your English and the accent, had I been with you, I would have said to any of those folks, come and walk the streets of Iron Range communities in Minnesota when I was growing up. There you could hear accents of Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Italian, Finn, Norwegian, Swede. They all sounded different from British English. Mr. Kim. Thank you, sir. Mr. Oberstar. Mr. Aranza. Please use your microphone. Mr. Aranza. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman---- Mr. Oberstar. We want to hear every word you have to say. Mr. Aranza. Okay.--and Members of the Committee. My name is Gilbert Aranza, and I am the CEO of Star Concessions. Thank you for holding this hearings and inviting me to testify. Star Concessions is a 100 percent minority-owned DBE operating food and beverage and retail concessions in airports, including DFW and Love Field. My company has excellent credentials, delivers top national brands and is highly qualified. Even so, we face race discrimination that makes it much harder to succeed. I have no doubt that, without programs like the FAA's ACDBE program, I would not have had any opportunities to succeed in the airport environment. I don't believe the leaders of major companies are inherently bad people, but experience has taught me that many of these leaders do not see diversity as being good for the bottom line. Although these leaders advocate diversity, without the ACDBE program, I do not believe they would provide opportunities for minority-owned companies. Our Nation has made progress against racial and ethnic discrimination. However, much remains to be done. Discrimination still negatively impacts minority businesses in many areas. Four of them are capital and financing, business networks, treatment by suppliers, and enduring stereotypes. Discrimination in capital markets makes it incredibly difficult for minority entrepreneurs to obtain regular bank loans. For instance, I might be able to obtain 15 or 16 percent money, while a majority player has a greater chance of obtaining 7 or 8 percent money. I have been lucky with some banks, but 90 percent of my financing comes from lenders chartered by the Federal Government like the SBIC program to work with small and minority-owned businesses. In terms of business networks, the good ol' boy network still prevails. Conventional wisdom says if we go to the right schools and join the right clubs, we will build good business networks. These business networks are essential to success, but minorities are often shut out. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin, one of the State's flagships schools, and from Harvard Law School. However, these degrees have not benefitted me in the same way that they have benefitted non-minority graduates. Nor have they insulated me from discrimination. As a minority, joining a professional club in Dallas came at a price. Being a Member meant I had to tolerate discrimination in the form of racist jokes and having fellow Members mistake me for a waiter at various functions. While airports and other public entities have laws enforcing equal opportunity, private businesses do not. Consequently, another problem faced by minority entrepreneurs is discrimination by vendors. I have worked with distributors who have been responsive to my needs. I have also had to deal with the opposite: distributors who ignored me completely. Price is also a problem. I had one supplier who said he was giving me mom and pop prices, prices that were ridiculously high. I believe that my race is one of the reasons for this treatment. I suspect that most of my suppliers still think, oh, he is just a minority. But now they have to think twice about acting on that attitude. Because of the DBE program, I had a chance to succeed and I have. Now, most suppliers who want access to the large customer market available in the airports where I work understand that I represent their best access to that market. Still, I am certain that if the DBE program disappeared, many of these large majority-owned firms would stop doing business with minorities altogether. Enduring stereotypes may be one of the reasons for that. Recently, a distributor came into one of my stores and demanded to speak to the owner. Based on his rude and dismissive tone, I knew it hadn't even entered his mind that the Hispanic guy in front of him might be the owner. I try to practice what I preach. I extend the benefits of the DBE program to others. For me, hiring and partnering with African-Americans is a priority. I don't have to do it; I am already 100 percent minority-owned. I do I because I believe it is the right thing to do. Fostering diversity and making money are not conflicting goals; it is good for business and good for society. I am very supportive of the DBE program, the SBIC program, and other programs that assist minority business owners. If it weren't for those programs, I would not be where I am today. That said, there are ways that these programs could be improved. In the current economic climate, minority businesses need more and better access to credit and venture capital, and newer, smaller DBEs need proactive information and assistance from airport staff. Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I am happy to take any questions you might have. Mr. Oberstar. Thank you very much for your testimony as well. We greatly appreciate your contribution. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson. Thank you. My name is Anthony Thompson. I am the President and CEO of the Kwame Building Group. We are a local construction management company in St. Louis, Missouri, but we do have offices in Pittsburgh, Dallas, and now recently Seattle. My undergrad is an architectural engineering from the University of Kansas. I also have a degree in architecture for environmental design from the University of Kansas. I have an MBA in Finance and a Masters in Engineering from Washington University. After working with the Corps of Engineers, Monsanto Chemical Company, and Anheuser-Busch, one of the largest brewers at one time in the world, I decided to start my own business, and I was surprised at the challenges that I was faced with coming from the private sector with so much experience in construction management and the education to be successful in the business. I decided to start my own business and go through the exhaustive process of becoming certified and so forth. It was surprising to me that unless I was certified or unless I had gone through the rigorous process of being certified, none of the white or prime contractors really wanted to do business with us unless they had to, unless it was a requirement. So there was no opportunity for me to show my experience or what I was capable of without having that certification. So after getting the certification, we began to win work. We were subcontractors to various firms throughout the Country, and the opportunity became very exciting for me because now I was able to employ other African-Americans, and women. I am proud to say that we currently have about 75 employees, of which 70 percent are minorities and women in senior and leadership positions. The average salary within our organization is $70,000 a year, and we give back to the community because also, like Mr. Aranza, we employ other minority vendors, we employ other minority and African-American suppliers and subcontractors. We could easily say we don't need to do that because I am a 100 percent minority owned business, but I have an obligation to give back to the community. My mother has told me that none of us have made it until all of us have made it. I live by that, I run my business that way, and the opportunities are great. And the return on the investment that the DBE process has given us allows us to give back philanthropically in our community as well. We donate to various causes, mentoring programs, as well as scholarships. We have $600,000 worth of endowed scholarships for minority youth that we have established. We are trying to make that $1 million within the next four years. The growth of our organization has been great, but doing business with minority firms and the DBE program should be a business imperative, not just a feel good sort of program. It does not cost more money to do business with minorities. It is more economical to do business with minorities and DBEs. For example, the east terminal for Southwest Airlines that was constructed in St. Louis was $15 million over budget when it was initially presented to start construction. They could not start the project because they did not have the funds. We were brought on to augment the existing staff to do value engineering and support estimates to get the cost down within the budget. We were able to find those $15 million worth of savings and, as a result of that, they hired us on to be the construction manager to oversee the entire construction of that project. Our fee for the four years that we managed that project was $4 million, so that was a pretty good return on investment for a $15 million savings on a project of that magnitude. That led to us being a joint venture partner with two of the largest construction companies in the world on the $1.5 billion expansion at Lambert International Airport, of which we gained experience and were able to lead the team at that point. That led to us now recently being prime contractor selected for some taxiway expansions and renovations at Lambert, as well as Seattle Airport. So, as you can see, the growth and development I tried to create opportunities, I think you may have this book in front of you that lists several of our transportation-related projects throughout the Country that have been led by our organization, and there are a lot of minorities within our organization that would not have a chance to lead major projects had they not come to work for a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise. So thank you very much, and I would be glad to answer any questions as we move forward. Mr. Oberstar. Well, yours is certainly a wonderful success story. Great to have that contribution. Let me ask Ms. Brown if she has some comments. Ms. Brown. I am ready, Mr. Chairman. First of all, let me just thank Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing and thank the participants for coming and giving their stories. We just passed the largest stimulus bill, the recovery bill, billions of dollars, and it seems as though there is some push-back from some of the different agencies as far as minority participation, and particularly in the area of transportation, whether I am talking about the airport or transit. I want to know is there anything in the bill from the Department that would cause the push-back? Because, as you just heard, I feel that minority participation is crucial. When we passed that stimulus bill, I look at it like my grandmamma's sweet potato pie: I want my slice hot out of the oven. And I am sure that is what you want too. And we all contribute to that pie, and I want to hear from the Department on this issue. Mr. Szabat. Madam Congresswoman, I don't know that we will get our Recovery Act money hot out of the oven, but we do intend to move it very quickly. But of the $48 billion that was entrusted to the Department in Recovery Act monies, over $35 billion will be distributed as formula grants through Federal Highways, through the Federal Transit Administration, and through our Airport Grant and Aid program. All of those monies are--I say again, are--covered by the DBE program. We estimate that that will lead to, conservatively, at least $3 billion, probably closer to $4 billion in business opportunities for DBEs. Ms. Brown. To follow up, there was a bonding program because some minorities have problems. Can you tell me what is the status of the bonding program? Mr. Szabat. Yes, Madam Congresswoman. There is a $20 million program for bonding assistance for DBEs that was included in the Federal Highway portion of Transportation's Recovery Act. We are working with the Small Business Administration in order to craft an assistance program. If we use the money straight for bonding, we would be able to help fewer than 200 small businesses. So what we are looking at is to a program where we would actually cover the costs of small businesses that participate in the Small Business Administration's bonding program, in which case we could actually assist far more businesses with that $20 million. As you might expect, working between two agencies with two different programs, there are some technical matters for us to work through, but we are confident that we will have something set up within the next few months. Ms. Brown. And I guess I just want to follow up again because it seems like there have been some push-backs from some of the airports that received dollars prior to the stimulus. What would cause them to think that the program is not---- Mr. Ashby. Madam Congresswoman, we had received some expressions of concern from recipients in various modes along the lines that because the stimulus funding was going to increase the amount of funding available for projects as much as it is, that somehow they might not be able to find sufficient DBE capacity in order to do the job. We weren't convinced by that. We put out guidance very early on after the passage of the legislation that said, I think very plainly, that not only do the DBE programs apply to this stimulus funding, but that we expected our recipients to do further outreach to use some of their underutilized DBE capacity, of which there is some, and to make sure that the promise of these stimulus funds extended to all businesses wanting to work with us, including DBEs. Ms. Brown. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar. Ms. Johnson, our Chair of the Water Resources; Ms. Brown, Chair of our Rail Subcommittee, thank you. Ms. Johnson? Ms. Johnson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me commend you for having this hearing, and I would like to ask unanimous consent to place my opening remarks in the record. Mr. Oberstar. Without objection, so ordered. Ms. Johnson. From the Department of Transportation, I have read your testimony, and you cite some commonly known barriers to success for DBEs, such as the lack of bonding, in addition to a host of other issues. As you may know, largely due to the leadership of this Committee, the recently enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provides $20 million for that bonding, and I have written to the Secretary inquiring as to how these funds would be allocated. You just finished giving some on that, but I would like to hear a little bit more in depth. And we will be having some local meetings in order to get this word out so that, in case it might be able to assist some of the DBEs. You know, it has not been easy over the years. Back when I was in the State Senate, I had to write the Department and ask them to withhold money from Texas until they worked out something, and it took so long I forgot I had written that when Texas called and asked if I would release it. But very often these contracts are made very, very large purposefully, but they don't have to be. So do you do anything actively to get the information out to prime contractors? Mr. Szabat. Yes, Madam Congresswoman. To handle your questions in order, first, regarding the $20 million in assistance, the Department will commit to working with you and your staff as we develop criteria in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, to share that with you, with any other Member of the Committee who is interested, before we actually go out and make a public announcement of what we intend to do so that you are aware of what we are trying to accomplish and how we intend to accomplish that. In terms of getting the information out to prime contractors, remember, our program is essentially three distinct programs. The Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, and Federal Transit Administration each run their own. They have a series of seminars, nowadays webinars that they use to get the words out. And I think many of the contractors here would indicate that Federal Register notices and the other ways that you normally use announcements to get information out to contractors is one of our more effective ways. But, again, we would be happy to share with you information from each of our three modes and how they communicate their programs to the community. Mr. Ashby. And if I might add, with respect to the issue about unbundling larger contracts, that is something that we have always endorsed and supported in our regulations. It is specifically mentioned there. We also recognize, though, that unbundling is often something that has been easier to praise than implement, and for that reason, in some regulatory proposals that we anticipate publishing in hopefully the very near future, we are going to be seeking comment and suggestions on additional ways that we, as the Department of Transportation, can do more to encourage or push grant agencies to unbundle their contracts and divide them into smaller chunks that are more readily able to be performed by small businesses. Ms. Johnson. Thank you. Now, I hear what you are saying and I can appreciate it very much. You know that these projects have to be started within a certain period of time, but you are going to move expeditiously to make sure that you are on target with them having opportunity to participate? Mr. Ashby. That is certainly our objective. Mr. Oberstar. If the gentlewoman would yield just a moment. Ms. Johnson. Yes. Mr. Oberstar. That is a very important point that you have raised, about the size of contracts. The reverse side of that coin is that when State DOTs want to achieve some other objective, they segment contracts into smaller pieces and award this piece and that piece at a time in order to avoid, as they have done in certain circumstances, avoid Davis-Bacon requirements. And we certainly don't want to see that kind of avoidance either. But breaking contracts down into more manageable pieces as part of an overall project so that there are elements that can be bid by minority enterprises is an important factor. Are there regulations that deal with this or is there guidance, is there policy guidance for State DOTs as they undertake these projects? Mr. Ashby. Our existing regulations specifically talk about unbundling as one of the key race neutral efforts to help small businesses, including DBEs, realizing that I think everyone perceives there is more needing to be done in that area. As I said, we are in the process of proposing regulations and asking for comment on additional ways of encouraging unbundling by our grant recipients. Mr. Szabat. I will add to that, Mr. Chairman. There is, as the Congresswoman alluded to, there is an inherent tension with what we are trying to accomplish with the Recovery Act, to get the money out quickly to create jobs. We are aware of that. Depending on whether it is an airport, a transit or a highway project, we have between 120 and 180 days, the recipients do, to get half of their money obligated. In those cases, to be obvious and honest, our hope is to work with them to find projects that are ready to go, and if they have contracts that are ready to go, we will be less enthusiastic about pressing them to unbundle them if it means a delay in getting people to work. That is an honest answer. Having said that, those contract opportunities are still covered by the goaling of DBE. So if there is in fact a tradeoff, the tradeoff is between the opportunity of having more prime contracts and increasing the subcontracting opportunities. We hope it doesn't come to that, but we do recognize that there is a tension there, and we are watching that very closely. Ms. Johnson. I know my time has expired, but give me---- Mr. Oberstar. No, time has not expired. I took some of the time. Ms. Johnson. Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Give me a frame of time that you have in mind to achieve this. Mr. Szabat. If I could ask you to expand the question, to achieve which goal, Madam Congresswoman? Ms. Johnson. Going to Small Business Administration. You know, sometimes government works slowly, and I was just trying to determine how long you anticipated working that out so you can---- Mr. Szabat. For the DBE granting, I would be surprised if it took us more than three months to have that out the door. Ms. Johnson. By that time, those contracts will be out there, because if they don't get them started by then, they have to send the money back. So you are going to have to move faster than that to give us some opportunities. Mr. Szabat. Then we will do it faster than that. Ms. Johnson. Okay. Could you keep in touch with me? Mr. Szabat. We will make it a point to. Ms. Johnson. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar. Following up on Ms. Johnson's questions, I first want to observe that, thus far in the recovery program, OMB has allocated to DOT $40 billion for highway and transit funding, and an additional amount to wastewater treatment. Thirty-three States have been approved for 800 projects, totaling $2.9 billion, which is 10 percent of the recovery funds. And I also note for the record that the Congressional Budget Office was wrong, Office of Management and Budget was wrong, Larry Summers was wrong. They said that they would send out only 2 percent. They were wrong, and I said so. And now you have proven them wrong and the States have proven them wrong. Eleven contracts in my own State of Minnesota have already been awarded for a net of 1,000 new jobs created, just as one example. Federal Transit Administration has awarded grants for 500 transit vehicles--trolleys, buses, vans, ferries, and bus shelters. Amtrak has sent $938 million in capital improvement grants out, contracts out, and for rehabilitation of 68 passenger cars for Amtrak at a value of $82 million on that contract; replacing a bill on the Niantic River for Amtrak. This is evidence that the Department is really moving out, the States are moving out smartly and they are doing the things they need to do. The question is on the size of these contracts, those that I have seen are in the range from $500,000 to $10 million or $12 million. There are a couple that are in the range of $100 million. Do you have information on sort of the average size of contract that Mr. Thompson, as a prime contractor, would bid on or that Mr. Aranza, Mr. Kim would bid as a subcontractor or Ms. Cloonen? Mr. Szabat. Mr. Chairman, we don't have that information in yet, and that is because it has only been in the last two weeks that we have started collecting information that we have actually had outlays going out the doors for these contracts. That information is coming in. It is coming in very rapidly and we are in the process of setting up our systems to capture that. So we can easily pull together, within the next week or so, snapshots and crosscuts of that information, but it will probably be a month or more, probably two months, closer to two months before we actually have the systems up and running so that we are actually able, on a real time basis, to reflect that level of granularity in tracking contract data. Ms. Brown. Mr. Chairman? Mr. Oberstar. Yes. The gentlewoman from Florida. Ms. Brown. On that point, could I raise another point? I think what we have had is eight years of not monitoring the departments, so I am very interested in the follow-up, making sure we are monitoring it and let the agencies that we are watching them. They have programs in place, they have minorities in place that they work with, and we want to make sure that they get part of those contracts. So I think it is the feedback. What you said, generally, for them to report back to us, to report back to us on the progress of the money going out, but also what kind of minority and female participation. See, those agencies then will keep that in mind as they award these programs. This is not anything new. We just want them to do their jobs. But we need to monitor what they are doing. Mrs. Napolitano. Would the gentleman yield? Mr. Oberstar. The gentlewoman from Texas has the time. Ms. Johnson. Yes, I will yield. Mrs. Napolitano. I will be very short. Thank you, madam, for yielding to me. On the same point, Ms. Brown is correct, we have been dealing with this for many years, since I was in the State House. How do we know that this is being enforced? Is there anything that tells us that you audit some of these for unbundling? Is there something that can tell this Committee how effective that has been or not been, following up on Ms. Brown's question? Is there a follow-up to be able to indicate whether or not, even if you unbundle, many of those who are testing to be minorities are fraudulent minorities; and are you going after the fraud perpetrators and blacklisting them for a few years, at least, to allow the legitimate minorities to be able to be successful? Mr. Szabat. Yes, Congresswoman. Whenever you have a program like this, there are at least two enticements for fraudulent behavior. One is, as you say, the people who will falsely represent themselves to be minorities, and the second one is that you will have prime contractors who will either establish fronts or will bring in a DBE firm and then discard it after they have won the contract. We look for both of those. Now, given how many DBEs at any one time--there are 27,000 or so out there and other firms that are interested in applying--and how many contractors active at any one time, our single best source of information is other people, especially other contractors, filing complaints to indicate that they believe that there is fraudulent behavior. Every one of those complaints is investigated by our staff and civil rights offices within each of the modes or within the Office of the Secretary, and, separately, the Inspector General's Office has also conducted investigations. Mr. Ashby. If I may add, Congresswoman, our Inspector General's Office has made DBE fraud a primary emphasis area. They have had a great deal of success over the last five years or so. They have taken action. This resulted in something like 49 indictments, 43 convictions, millions of dollars in fines or forfeitures, and a lot of jail time. I personally had the privilege, a year and a half ago or so, of testifying in a DBE fraud case brought by our IG and U.S. Attorney folks in Miami which resulted in someone who had done a classic pay a DBE not to do the work scheme, five years in jail. Mrs. Napolitano. You say you do by complaint. Do you actually do any audits to be able to ferret out any of those? Mr. Ashby. There are audits by our operating administrations of DBE program performance in general. Our certification office in the civil rights office looks at phony certifications. Ms. Johnson. Reclaiming my time. Mrs. Napolitano. I am sorry. Go ahead. Mr. Ashby. So there is a good deal of work that our people do both by themselves and to insist that our recipients look at what is happening in their own programs. Ms. Johnson. But you indicated here in the testimony that there were some contractors that would make commitments long enough to get the contract, and then that commitment would disappear. Is that fraud? Mr. Ashby. It may not necessarily be fraud in the legal sense. It is certainly a sharp practice which is contrary to the provisions and intent of our program. In the forthcoming rulemaking actions, one of the things that we are seeking to do is to put into place provisions that would require written consent of the airport or the transit authority or the highway department before a prime contractor was able to drop a subcontractor, a DBE subcontractor that they had relied upon to get the contract. That was an issue that was brought up in our stakeholder meetings that we have been having over the last several months and one of considerable concern in the community that we are responding to. Ms. Johnson. When you find something of this sort, do you refer to the Inspector General or how do you handle it? Mr. Szabat. It depends on the nature of the complaint. All fraud complaints goes to the Office of the Inspector General. If there are complaints about a rule being misinterpreted, about sloppy bookkeeping, about a State not following our standards, those things are handled with our auditors and through our normal chain of command, working directly with the States, with the transit districts, or with the airport authorities. Ms. Johnson. Could I make a request? Could you send me, about every couple months, a report of different findings that you have in this area? I am not asking you to tell me all of what you have done--I will find that out when I get the report--but just tell me about the various incidences that you have noticed. Mr. Szabat. We will make it a point to do so. Ms. Johnson. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Oberstar. Now the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Cao. Mr. Cao. Thank you very much, Mr. Cao. I just wanted to follow up on the questions that have been presented. I want to know whether or not the DOT programs and operations could be strengthened by administrative sanctions. Mr. Ashby. As of now, the main sanction available with respect to our grantees, to the airports and highway departments and so forth, themselves, is simply that compliance is a condition of receiving financial assistance, and that is a pretty powerful incentive. In some of our other civil rights programs, for example, in our aviation disability program, there is the option of civil penalties, which must be granted legislatively. In addition, we have an existing tool of suspension and debarment that can be used not only for criminal activity on the part of contractors and other participants, but also for essentially unethical business practices, and that is a tool which I think can be used profitably to deal with folks whose conduct might not rise to the level of criminal conduct, but who are engaging in activities that undermine the program. Of course, with respect to firms that are certified improperly, we have the existing sanction of removing their certification so they can no longer participate. Mr. Cao. Now, how does the DBE program assist minorities in attaining needed financing, and is there appropriate oversight of this process? Mr. Ashby. Again, the DBE program itself, in terms of our regulations, does not directly assist people in getting financing. We do talk about things like bonding, capital assistance programs as among the race neutral measures that our recipients are directed to take in order to get as much DBE participation as they can through race neutral means. Through the bonding initiative that we have discussed in the recovery package, through our Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, which has a short-term lending program, and, of course, through cooperation with the programs of the Small Business Administration, there is that kind of assistance that is available to at least some DBEs. Our Federal Highway Administration also has a program which has been repeatedly authorized by this Committee and Congress to provide supportive services to DBEs. Mr. Cao. Based on my experience with minority contractors from the 2nd Congressional District for New Orleans, a lot of the minority groups who want to be involved in the rebuilding process have the problem of meeting all the criteria required in order to qualify for certain projects, so I see there might be a need to assist them in that area. Do you see that same problem in other areas of the United States besides the New Orleans area? Mr. Ashby. I think that the information we have suggests that there are a number of barriers that typically exist that help prevent DBEs from getting a fair opportunity of the jobs. The studies that Dr. Wainwright mentions identify in substantial detail the capital and bonding and prequalification and other barriers that may be more difficult for some minority companies to surmount than larger, well established non- minority companies. So I think one does see evidence of that kind of barrier across the board, and the studies that Dr. Wainwright and others have submitted for the record I think give ample evidence of that. Mr. Cao. I don't have any further questions, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Mr. Oberstar. Thank you, Mr. Cao. Mrs. Napolitano, gentlewoman from California. Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I thank my two ladies for allowing me some time. Mr. Szabat, I want to continue the dialog and the questioning in regard to the bundling issue and to the enforcement issue, the audit issue. Would you be able to provide this Committee the number of those fraudulent cases where you found convictions necessary as a percentage of the total number of complaints? In other words, are we going after them? Are you finding enough of those that discourage others from trying to attempt fraud in seeking contractors, or is it just too lucrative for them to worry about any penalties? Mr. Szabat. We will find that information and we will provide it to the Committee. Mrs. Napolitano. I guess, maybe, Mr. Chair, I am very concerned because I just spoke to Ms. Velazquez, Chair of the Small Business Committee, and she was indicating that, in Small Business, the hub zones have been found to be very fraudulent, to the fact that she is suspending the hub zones designation because, after the second round of audits and investigations, there were 17 left. Of those 17, 10 had ben found to be questionable. So that goes down to 7, and that is nationwide; and that is a sad story for our administration not be having a handle on. So that brings concern about what other agencies are not actually enforcing or going after those fraudulent cases and doing enough to where it means something to the public who is being left out. Mr. Szabat. Your point is well received. Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you. One of the other areas is how do the DBE regulations ensure that the race neutral methods are used as much as possible? Mr. Ashby. If I may answer, Congresswoman, we have a process by which when a recipient proposes its overall goal for everything it is doing during the given year, that level playing field for nondiscriminatory participation, they are required to show us--we always tell them show your work--they are required to show us what is the evidence they have for being able to make a particular amount of their goal through race neutral means and what are the race neutral means they are using, as well as what evidence they have for needing to use race conscious means for the other portion of their goal; and our FTA, FHWA, FAA staff initially in the field and, where necessary, later in headquarters, review those submissions and can and have gone back to the States and said, wait a minute, your evidence may not support your conclusions, why are you making this assumption. So there is a fair amount of direct Federal oversight of those decisions. Mrs. Napolitano. Does this also include the other general race--what is the other term that they use? Mr. Ashby. Race conscious. Mrs. Napolitano. Race conscious, right. Mr. Ashby. Yes, that is true for both those aspects of the goal program. Mrs. Napolitano. I guess maybe I have a concern that because many minorities cannot apply for prime contracts because of their size and their ability to find the funding, so they become subcontractors. And if there is a way of being able to ace them out, if you will, of being able to be participants based on those reasonings, what can we do to be able to assure that the minorities are served well? And I am talking about all minorities. Mr. Ashby. Again, I think that our program has fairly clear criteria for the size of the businesses. We don't age people out in the same sense that the SBA program does, but we do have size criteria; and the success stories that we provided for the record talk about a number of cases in which DBE companies who started out as subcontractors have become more successful, the term that is used is graduated from the program, and become successful prime contractors in their jurisdiction. So that kind of thing can and does happen, and obviously one of the objectives of our program is to provide all the possible assistance so that---- Mr. Szabat. And if I may follow up with Mr. Ashby's answer, Congresswoman, for us in the Department, sometimes it is important for us to remember that this program is one tool in the toolkit, it doesn't cover all of the needs. Both you, Congresswoman Johnson and Congressman Cao have talked about the importance of bonding and financing. This program makes no pretensions to do that. We have never had a significant bonding program of our own; we had a small one in the Department a few years ago. Until we have the $20 million with the Recovery Act, and that, in and of itself, is very small. Those sorts of assistance--the financing, the bonding guarantees--will primarily come through SBA or other agencies, Federal or otherwise. Having said that, we think that this program is very meritorious for all of its other reasons. But we don't pretend that it meets all of the needs for all of the witnesses and all of the other companies that participate in the DBE program. Mrs. Napolitano. Okay, is there an issue because of the number of subprimes that you have a problem in being able to go through all of them and assert that they are legitimate or that they are worthy or that they will be able to be prospective contractors? Mr. Ashby. We have in the program a very significant certification element which goes through the bona fides of each firm applying to participate in significant detail, and that program is the first line of defense to make sure that the firms that participate are genuinely eligible for this program. We also have oversight of those certification efforts by our operating administrations, and when there is a disagreement about whether someone should be certified, that often comes to our Office of Civil Rights for decision, and they do a very thorough job of looking at the record and seeing if the right decision---- Mrs. Napolitano. Which goes back to my question of being able to audit and figure out whether they are legitimate or not. Mr. Szabat. And there is more that we can do in that area, Congresswoman, and more that we are doing. One of the challenges we have had is for many years, and up to this day in some areas, our program has been paper based. So we had 50 States, numerous airport authorities, transit districts, all of them certifying on their own, all of them turning this in to us in to three different modes--aviation, highways and transit. So when I tell you that there are 27,000 DBEs out there, I can't give you an exact number because we are not accounting for duplications, whether one of these companies is certified in more than one State or if they are certified both on the airport side as well as on the transit side, for example. The Federal Aviation Administration has already moved to automated system, a system that is called DOORS, and we are in the planning phases to do that also with transit and with highways. When this information is automated, it will be much easier for us to automate because we will be able to make more real-time comparisons of the data as it comes up from the States, from the transit districts, and from the airport authorities. Mrs. Napolitano. Thank you. Mr. Chair, I would like to ask you to receive into the record a letter from Caltrans in regard to some of the issues that have just been covered, and thank you very much for the time. Mr. Oberstar. Without objection, the Caltrans letter from Director Will Kempton will be included in the record at this point. And we will work with the gentlewoman and USDOT on the specific issues raised in that letter. Mr. Cohen, gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. Cohen. Thank you, sir. I am pleased that I have guests that will be here testifying before the second panel. We are still on the first panel, are we not? Mr. Oberstar. Yes, we are. Mr. Cohen. So I am premature or you are premature, but I am ready and fired up and ready to go. [Laughter.] Mr. Oberstar. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate most of the questions have been directed at our DOT witnesses, but I do want to come to a very important matter raised by Mr. Szabat's testimony and Ms. Cloonen, Mr. Aranza and other witnesses, and that is these informal networks. You described it very well as old boy networks. That really does exist, doesn't it? There is an exclusion. If you don't happen to be in the same golfing group or the hunting group. In Minnesota it would be ice fishing. You have all seen Grumpy Old Men. That really exists, people really do get pretty testy about their fish houses on the ice; and if you are not part of that group, it is sort of maybe we can't call it an invisible exclusion or discrimination, but it certainly is a discrimination. How can we address those matters outside of the--or perhaps within regulation or within the legal structure? Do you have some ideas, Ms. Cloonen? Ms. Cloonen. Thank you. One of the ways that I am able to meet with more male-owned contractors is that I join associations that allow the women in. But I still don't go on the Canadian fishing outings. So I don't know, legally, other than offering or encouraging the associations to be open to female and minorities being a part of that, I am not really sure another way to do that legally. Mr. Oberstar. But the DBE provisions give you access, is that right, Mr. Kim, Mr. Aranza, Mr. Thompson? Why don't you pick it up from there? Mr. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As Ms. Cloonen mentioned, sometimes it is tough to get access to these major consultants or contractors, but with the DBE program they are kind of forced to talk with you, so that is the first step. So when we have opportunity, we have to perform, we have to deliver what we promise; otherwise, we are going to be in trouble. But it takes more than that. As you indicated, there are some groups out there, something you don't see always, but how do you get over with it? That is not easy, but one way I found out is partially successful, I try to participate in civic organizations and I serve as a board member for a number art music organizations, I serve in Rotary Committee. So by these community organizations I get to meet other people, expand my contacts. As you all know, it is all relationship driven. We need to build relationships with decision-makers. That is one way to get in, but it is always not that easy, so we have to work really hard. Mr. Oberstar. Thank you. I was intrigued by your comment about food. It reminded me of the days when I worked in the summers in the iron ore mines and in the concrete block factory in my hometown of Chisholm, and we had Swedes, Norwegians, Finns, Serbs, Croatians, and the aromas were wonderful when they opened their lunch pails at lunchtime. Nobody complained. They all wanted to share their respected foods. Mr. Aranza. Mr. Aranza. Yes, sir. Unfortunately, those networks exist, and I have found the only way to change it is to use political power, to go to my city council friends that are minority or to go to my Congress friends like Congresswoman Johnson and basically tell them what I believe is happening and try to change the makeup of the boards that govern airports, to put people like Don O'Bannon, who is here, to oversee that the good ol' boy network doesn't continue to permeate and control every piece of business that goes on, in my case, in the city of Dallas. So, without political power, I don't know how minorities or you could effectively change what happen despite our collective abilities to perform. Mr. Oberstar. Mr. Thompson. Mr. Thompson. Yes. That is really a key issue. I said a lot of great things about my organization, but I failed to mention all of the discriminatory experiences, because there are so many. We would be here all day if I talked about all the discrimination that I had to deal with on a day-to-day basis. It is real. One of the things we have to be concerned about also is, once you graduate from the program, you are no longer protected, so to speak, by the DBE program. Then the real troubles begin, because now, if there is no incentive for the prime contractors to do business with you, they won't, and you go back to being destitute and looking for work, unless you can quickly move to the private sector, establish yourself as a competent professional firm that people will want to do business with, because it is the right thing to do but, more importantly, because it is economically feasible to do so. But if it weren't for organizations, from a networking standpoint, like COMTO, the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials, that is where the relationships and the networking helps organizations like mine. Those conferences and a lot of the programs that they provide puts us with prime contractors and also puts us in line to be considered for priming. The gentleman, Mr. Aranza, mentioned Don O'Bannon of Dallas. There is an excellent program that he headed up down there, the GMax program, that we were able to be a part of. We partnered with a minority disadvantaged business and, through our professional management expertise and t"
