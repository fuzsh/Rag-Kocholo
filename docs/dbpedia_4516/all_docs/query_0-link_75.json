        "text": "I wasn’t supposed to get a literary agent in 2020. Seriously, I mean...\n\nI don’t live in Los Angeles\n\nI'm homeschooling two small boys\n\nI have a full-time day-job\n\nIn my abundant free-time I advocating as a refugee volunteer\n\nOh, and there's a global pandemic happening that's shuttered much of Hollywood\n\nBecoming a working screenwriter just wasn’t in the cards for me this year. Everyone told me to forget about it. 2020 wasn’t going to be my year. Turns out, everyone was wrong. Because not only did I recently land a manager; I just signed with not one, but a whole team of literary agents at Verve (four to be exact). For a little context, here are some of Verve's current clients:\n\nMilo Ventimiglia\n\nAnna Chlumsky\n\nWilla Holland\n\nLeah Remini\n\nJames D'Arcy\n\nJJ Feild\n\nNia Long\n\nNicholas D'Agosto\n\nMorris Chestnut\n\nAaron Guzikowski\n\nColin Trevorrow\n\nOlatunde Osunsanmi\n\nSydelle Noel\n\nGreg Russo\n\nThis is the story of how my entire screenwriting career took off this year, and how you can hopefully make the same thing happen for you.\n\nMy first screenplay\n\nLike a lot of you, I had a lot of ideas for films and television. They were just waiting for that bit of motivation to get from brain to paper (computer screen). One day, inspiration struck and I finally decided to make good on that promise to myself. I researched, wrote, edited, made charts, and then rewrote again. Finally, I handed it out to friends and people at the office. That was the scariest part.\n\nI got enough positive feedback to move forward. I’d go all in and write my screenplay. But what does “all-in” look like, exactly, and where do I go from here?\n\nMy screenwriting schedule\n\nOfficially, my writing routine is to write from 9:00 pm - 4 am Sunday-Friday. You read that right. 9 pm to 4 am. I sleep until 7 am then run one of my kids to school, then go back to sleep until 8:15 am, and then haul-ass to work.\n\nI do a little screenwriting and research in the Lyft to work, start work at 9 am (maybe 9:15 am), write on my lunch hour (if no friends can meetup), haul-ass to pick up my kids around 4:30 pm, and I squeeze in a few social calls to friends on my way home. By 5 pm, I try to be ready to cook a homemade meal and be totally devoted to my kids (when screenwriting was really bad -- we’d order out). After that, they go to bed around 8:45 pm.\n\nI clean my house like the Tasmanian Devil from 8:45 pm-9:00 pm then start screenwriting again. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I fit in an hour of volunteering from 4 pm-5 pm. And on Sunday evenings I prep for another night of screenwriting while also preparing my kids folders for the week ahead.\n\nSaturdays I’m with my kiddos, but at night I try to see friends and then write some more when I get home — even if that means starting at 1 am or 2 am. Bring on the black tea and Doritos.\n\nHow to avoid screenwriter burnout\n\nKeeping this schedule for the last few years really did a number on how I process my emotions. I’d get anxiety and then double-down on my vacuum (using all the attachments). You have to hustle to make it as a screenwriter, but it's also important to take care of yourself.\n\nI only had one friend in the industry, and she didn’t even work in screenwriting. My odds of becoming a professional screenwriter were slim to none. Luckily, my sunny disposition prevented me from processing the reality of my situation.\n\nHow to handle criticism as a screenwriter\n\nMany people blew me off. But just as many said they’d love to read my work. It was actually amazing how kind some people were. Still, the reality is, that everyone is going to have input on your script. And some of it is going to be harsh:\n\nOne reader said they thought it was “stupid to have a female killer that wasn’t likable, women have to be likable.” That day hit me on so many levels, as the reviewer was a fellow female screenwriter\n\nAnother told me “girls shouldn’t write gritty dramas.”\n\nAn industry friend finally got around to reading my stuff and said, “Sorry. Do you have anything more focused on like cooking or traveling pants? I like that type of stuff.” I had waited five months to hear that?!\n\nOne memorable experience was when an exec invited me to meet with them in New York. I bought a plane ticket and paid the deposit on a hotel room only to have them cancel on me two days before the meeting. I had to look at my tiny kids and think, “Well, I just spent our fun money on my whimsical dream to be a screenwriter — for nothing.”\n\nBut the worst was when a producer — who loved my work asked to meet with me in LA. I flew out to LA and he suggested a few tweaks he wanted to see. Then he suggested that as an “Asian female writer” I shouldn’t be in the room.“The room doesn’t look like you, no offense.” I went back to my hotel room and screamed into a Dorito bag. I decided to choke down his words and choose to believe he was wrong.\n\nScreenwriting is a tough business\n\nI’d used all my paid-time-off, my mom was watching my kids, and I’d flown to Los Angeles, despite my fear of flying, only to be told “you can’t” and “you won’t”. People were asking if I could change my projects to be more about cooking or traveling pants?! It would’ve been easy to quit.\n\nCriticism and callous rejections are just part of the screenwriting business. Seriously, you have to accept that. Plan for it. Prepared to be dismissed and written off. Be okay with it, because as hard as each rejection is, it really is just part of the process of becoming a working screenwriter. Accept it as the cost of doing business, and get back to work!\n\nDelusion is your friend\n\nWhen my parents adopted me as a little girl, they told me I could be anything I wanted. But, that was then. This was LA. If you want to “make it” you have to stop looking for praise and move forward with your dreams, no matter what.\n\nSometimes I’d get good news like I placed or won a festival or competition, and I’d feel like all my hard work was all worth it. But there are still ups and downs. And that’s ok. In fact, it’s how almost everyone does it.\n\nEvery screenwriter’s journey is different\n\nI heard story after story of contradicting experiences from my screenwriting friends and colleagues:\n\nA friend had been on multiple popular dramas and had a manager, but getting work was a struggle after those gigs and they couldn’t get an agent\n\nAnother friend had won incredibly prestigious awards, but couldn’t get a manager or an agent to read their work\n\nThen you hear about someone who hasn’t really worked or won a recognized award getting a manager(?!) while another friend had won major awards, interned at two large production houses, and couldn’t get read\n\nYou will hear stories of writers getting an agent and manager after winning a major competition. And you’ll hear frustrations from another writer who won the same competition last year but still can’t get a manager or agent. There is no one path to screenwriting success. You just have to keep trying things like submitting to competitions, networking, pitching, and sending out query letters. That’s the boring secret to success. Never give up.\n\nHow I got a manager from 2000 miles away\n\nI sat through all these stories as I networked on the phone, on social media, and in-person. And then, one day, I got a notification from Coverfly that I’d been picked for Pitch Week. I couldn’t believe it.\n\nThrough Coverfly, I met my manager online in a Zoom call. He was very easy to speak with and gave interesting insights into how he read things and what he saw in writing. We signed together a week later!\n\nMy television pilot continued to do very well competitively, and networking was getting easier. Then about six months later, a connection that had become a friend asked if I could help with a project. I was reluctant but thought it’d be great to do this for someone who had given me so much advice and education on the industry.\n\nThat encounter led to my meeting an agent. We chatted indirectly through the group we were in. Afterward, I wondered… “How horrible would it be to try and get his input on a project?”\n\nHow I got an agent during a pandemic\n\nI told my talent manager I was hoping to expand our team and that I planned to inquire with an agent.\n\nI sent the agent an email asking for some input. He responded promptly, saying that he’d be cool to jump on a call. We chatted for maybe 20-30 minutes ultimately with him saying he wanted to read my stuff!\n\nIf you’re a struggling scribe you know how exciting that is to hear!\n\nBefore we hung-up, he admitted it could be a while (I’d been prepared for months) and that he appreciated our chat and looked forward to reading my work. I must’ve caught him at the right time because two days later he let me know he loved it. He wanted to know right away when we could chat!\n\nI was so used to the process-of-the-process. But then, one evening my phone rang. I’ll never forget it. I was in the kitchen wearing one shoe — my kid had taken the other to use as a “boat” — and I was in the middle of burning our “Hello Fresh”! I saw an unknown California number pop-up on my phone, and answered reluctantly.\n\nThe voice on the other side directed me to the agent!\n\nHe let me know that they loved my work and that they'd wanted to assign me a team of agents, four to be exact. He couldn’t hear it, but I was crying. They'd already called my manager to set up a Zoom call to make it official.\n\nHe doesn’t know this, but after we hung up I went into my children’s room and hugged them so tightly. Then I bawled my eyes out.\n\nHow to become a working screenwriter\n\nDinner was burned and I only had one shoe on, but I was elated! A working, homeschooling mother, in Chicago, during a pandemic got signed to a team of agents in LA. If you’re in the middle of your own struggle to become a screenwriter, breathe and believe. You are not alone.\n\nFocus on content, embrace both positive and negative engagements, and avoid transactional moves choosing instead to be a good listener and a kind member of the writing community. Accept obstacles as the cost of doing business and move on. Seek mentorship and advice from those that can empathize with the fickle process. And most importantly, don’t view managers or agents as the end of the story.\n\nYou have to keep being your best advocate and keep hustling, listening, learning, and putting in the time because the truth is “Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity.\"\n\nSo many thanks: To my agents at Verve, and Eric Borja at Alldayeveryday. And, to the entire Coverfly team, with extra thanks to Tom Dever and Emily Dell. And, special thanks to my “go-to” David Rabinowitz.

I'd missed out on the previous cycle in the spring, so I applied sort of last-minute on a whim after seeing a reminder email from Coverfly about the final deadline. When I was notified that I’d been officially selected to pitch to at least one company, I was definitely excited. But when I learned that I’d been chosen by industry executives to take part in six separate pitch meetings, I was equal parts nervous and ecstatic!\n\nI immediately started preparing. Here's how I landed six pitch meetings in one week, and what I did to prepare.\n\nHow to prepare for a pitch meeting\n\nI was fortunate enough to have some prior experience with pitching going into Pitch Week, in the form of a few general meetings and some great programs I’ve attended. Shout out to the CineStory Feature Retreat for the tutelage sessions on pitching!\n\nI've also been able to observe a lot of pitches during my days in the trenches working as an assistant in development. But I approached this challenge of pitching virtually the same as I would any other pitch-related scenario — research. Lots and lots of research.\n\nWhat it's like to pitch your script virtually\n\nAs soon as I knew who I was going to be pitching to, I started by trying to learn as much about those individuals as I could:\n\nWhat is their current job title?\n\nWhich kind of projects have they or their company produced or been attached to recently?\n\nDo we have any common connections (people, studios, jobs)?\n\nWhich is all just a nice way of saying that I did some heavy internet stalking! But, respectfully, you want to be able to tailor your pitch to each room as much as possible, especially in situations like this where you only have twelve minutes a session. Every second counts!\n\nHow to get the most out of your pitch\n\nFor example, if you have multiple projects and you know you’re pitching to a television exec at Netflix, they’re most likely going to be interested in hearing about your original pilot first, and not your feature. Plan accordingly.\n\nThe best advice that I can offer on how to pitch successfully (even virtually or on your first try) is simply this:\n\nKnow. Your. Stories!\n\nAnd get right to the point.\n\n6 simple tips for your next virtual pitch\n\nThink of your logline. Now make it more conversational.\n\nDon’t try to memorize or rehearse what you’re going to say. Just have a few key bullet points in your head (or create a cheat sheet if you think you might get nervous and freeze. But put it somewhere that doesn’t require you to look away a lot, and never read directly from something! It'll show.)\n\nShare the heart of your story and what makes it unique. Why should they be excited about your story? What about the characters? Include a personal connection if you can, like why did you write this story, and what makes you the best person to tell it?\n\nDon’t explain the entire script. The goal of a pitch is to get them interested!\n\nLearn how to use the program (in most cases, Zoom) to help prevent any technical difficulties. And test it right before every meeting. Make sure that your video and sound are working properly, that you have sufficient lighting (never backlit!), and that there’s nothing *ahem* inappropriate or distracting visible in your background.\n\nFinally, it goes without saying that you should be polite, don’t be late, know when to listen, and keep an eye on the clock so that you can thank them and wrap up your pitch professionally.\n\nHow to answer questions in a pitch meeting\n\nIt's tempting to \"use up\" all 12 minutes on your pitch, but that's the wrong approach. Leave time and space for them to ask questions. And you should ask questions in return, to try and get to know them a little. It’s hard in twelve minutes, but honestly, most people will acknowledge the fact that pitching is a bit of a weird situation. Just be yourself and try to maximize the time as much as you can.\n\nBe ready to answer questions that might go beyond you and your writing by staying (as current as you can) with the industry. You should know who’s making what and where, and also expect that ever-important question, “What else do you have?”\n\nA pitch meeting might initially be set up to talk about a specific project, but you should always be prepared to share other ideas with them and to sell yourself in general as a writer. Pitching is really all about building relationships. You never know what could come from any given meeting or connection.\n\nHow to pitch your script post COVID\n\nWe’re living in strange times! But everyone is genuinely trying to find new ways forward, and we’re all figuring it out together. In my experience, the fundamentals of pitching have not – and probably won’t ever – change, and there are pros and cons to doing it virtually.\n\nThe pros are that it allows work to continue safely. And from a scheduling standpoint, you can get more pitching done faster when you don’t need to spend hours fighting traffic all over Los Angeles in-between meetings. I'm one of the people who feel that they are “better in the room.” There's a certain element that gets lost by not being physically present with someone. But even with the luxury of a longer in-person meeting, you still have to hook people right away, so being able to do that even under the added pressure of a strict time limit is an essential skill that I think all writers should strive to master regardless.\n\nHow to get six pitches in one week\n\n“Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”\n\nThe best way to succeed at something like Pitch Week is to think of the application process like pre-pitching. Because you’re essentially pitching to pitch!\n\nTake the time to get your Coverfly profile up to date, and make it short, punchy, and compelling.\n\nKeep generating interest and accolades for your projects, that will help in building a viable track record that you can then utilize as a form of professional vetting when promoting yourself and your work – especially if you don’t have other avenues of direct access to the industry or the means to move to Los Angeles.\n\nPersonally, I don't think that the need or benefits of in-person pitch meetings will ever go away completely. But events like Pitch Week are great tools to help writers get discovered. More so in the case of Coverfly, because they don’t charge any fees to apply. For me, that element made me feel more confident in the fact that they really do put writers first, and that I had nothing to lose.\n\nWhat I learned from Coverfly Pitch Week\n\nPitch Week for me was a total whirlwind! It was both nerve-wracking and very rewarding, and I grew even more comfortable pitching than I had been beforehand – specifically with pitching virtually.\n\nVirtual pitches are a reality of screenwriting today. And while most writers tend not to be social creatures by nature (I liked to joke during the beginning of quarantine that I had been training for it my whole life) the more you do it, the better you’ll get. And the more you get your work out there and the more exposure you receive is only going to benefit you. With the current state of the world, there’s really no better time to take advantage of virtual pitching opportunities. So keep writing, and keep fighting!\n\nAlexandra Amadio was shaped by a unique upbringing in Maui, Hawai'i. She moved to Los Angeles and started working in production when she was just 17 years old, going on to work in development for such producers as Mike Medavoy, Denise Di Novi, and as an executive assistant for director Rob Cohen. Her feature script, “All-Star”, recently attached Wendey Stanzler (Sex and the City; Carnival Row) to direct.\n\nAlexandra's goal is to get \"All-Star\" into production and find writing representation. She'd also like to write on Amazon's Lord of the Rings series.\n\nPitch meetings are scary, especially if you've never pitched to a room full of reps or studio executives. Luckily, there's something you can do to fight the pitch meeting jitters and pitch your script like a seasoned pro. How do we know? Because we asked dozens of studio executives, agents, reps, and Hollywood decision-makers who took part in our most recent Coverfly Fall Pitch Week what they're looking for in a pitch meeting. And they had a lot to say.\n\nAfter hearing over 250 pitches from 123 writers during Coverfly Pitch Week, here are the six most common pieces of advice Hollywood insiders have for screenwriters pitching their scripts. Follow these tips and own the room during your next pitch meeting.\n\nHow to pitch your script like a pro: Coverfly Pitch Week\n\n250 Pitches\n\n123 Writers\n\nVirtual pitches from Australia, The UK, Canada, Italy, and over 20 states\n\nMost pitches for a single writer: 8\n\nMost pitches for a rep: 31\n\n78 project requests and counting!\n\nHere's everything you need to know to make your next script pitch meeting a success.\n\nDon’t be a jerk\n\nBe nice, be polite, be on time, smile, and be engaged. This might seem like the easiest bit of advice, but it bears repeating. Kindness and professionalism go a long way. The best part is that it’s easy to do! No matter what else happens, be a good person and your pitch will start off on the right foot.\n\nFocus on what makes you unique\n\nThere are thousands, if not tens of thousands of talented screenwriters in the same format and genre. The only way for you to stand out from the crowd is to focus on what makes you — and only you— unique. Your life experience, your voice, your projects, and your story are special. Truly. Our Pitch Week reps reiterated that the most impactful pitches are from unique places. They want to hear original pitches from original voices.\n\nWhat makes you and your story different from the other pitches they hear day in and day out? If you can uncover and highlight that distinction, your pitch stands a better chance of making a lasting first impression on Hollywood decision-makers.\n\nShoot your shot\n\nDon’t hold back. During Pitch Week (and most Hollywood script pitch meetings) you only get 12 minutes to make a strong impression. 720 seconds. That's not a lot of time to make a studio exec or rep want to read your script (and hopefully sign you). Don’t spew your life story at 500 wpm, but don't waste time with too much chit chat either. This is your shot. Take it.\n\nThe floor is yours to say what you need to communicate to get the most impressive and exciting stuff you have to offer out there. There's no wrong way to present your pitch, as long as you have a plan. Hone your pitch and practice what you want to say in 12 minutes (or less) and you'll be ready to rock your next pitch meeting.\n\nDon’t just say what happens in the story, focus on how the audience will experience it\n\nA pitch meeting is not a plot synopsis. Do not waste your (and their) time recapping every scene in linear order. A successful pitch meeting focuses not just on what makes your project special, but how audiences will react to it. That's what ultimately sells. That means it's not just about the story, but how the story will be told.\n\nWhat's the narrative structure?\n\nHow will the script make the audience feel?\n\nWhy is this story important to audiences right now?\n\nWiden the scope of your pitch to the impact of your story, not just the details, and you'll entice decision-makers to imagine that script on the big screen.\n\nBe confident\n\nThere's nothing more contagious than enthusiasm. You've worked hard on your script. Be proud of it! All of the reps and executives we spoke with during Pitch Week said they love it when screenwriters are excited to talk about their work. A script pitch meeting isn't supposed to be boring. They want to be swept up in your enthusiasm. If you can share your energy and passion in a way that gets others excited about your project and your vision, you're on your way to a successful pitch and maybe even a project request.\n\nAlso, never undercut your work or fixate on what's wrong with it. It's ok to be humble(ish), but your pitch meeting is not the time to be self-deprecating. Take pride in all your hard work because if you don't champion your script, no one else will. Confidence goes a long way in a pitch meeting.\n\nFind what we have in common\n\nPitch meetings aren't just about scripts. They're about building relationships. You have to convince executives not only that you're a talented writer with a white-hot script. You also have to show them that you're someone they will want to work with on this project and future projects to come. Forge that relationship.\n\nPitch meetings aren't even always about successfully pitching your script. Sometimes your project won't make sense for a studio or rep. But that doesn't mean they won't want to work with you. If you can show that you're talented, hard-working, and aligned with their production process, you can build a working relationship that lasts long after your 12-minute pitch is over. Remember that connections and networking are still key to success in Hollywood. Use your time wisely and build relationships during your next pitch meeting.\n\nHow to pitch your script to Hollywood insiders and studio execs\n\nPitch meetings don't have to be scary. Remember that you're in that room (or Zoom!) for a reason. Be confident, be courteous, show that you're capable, and highlight your originality. Every pitch meeting is a chance to not only showcase your script but an opportunity to build working relationships with Hollywood insiders that can last for years. Try to relax and connect with the people in the room and you'll be off to a great start in Hollywood.\n\nShore Scripts' main goal is to discover new exciting screenwriting talent and boost careers. They put each year’s best scripts into the hands of their industry roster – all of whom have the experience and means to get your script made. We recently had the opportunity to ask Justine Owens, the Director of Contests at Shore Scripts, a few questions. See her answers below.\n\nCoverfly: What's the mission of Shore Scripts Contests?\n\nJustine Owens: Simple really. Shore Scripts was founded to kick-start screenwriting careers. We are extremely proud that our screenplay contests have helped 60+ writers gain representation, option, sell, and have their screenplays produced.\n\nCF: What's one unique piece of advice you'd give to writers who enter your contest?\n\nJO: Writers should not be afraid to get feedback on their script, and this especially applies before submitting to a contest. A second-pair-of-eyes is invaluable in helping a writer hone his/her craft.\n\nCF: What's the best thing writers can do if they place in, but don't win the contest?\n\nJO: Some might say go back to the script and try a rewrite. But personally, I think they should take a moment to celebrate their success. Shout aloud and proud to everyone that will listen. The old saying goes, success breeds success. Advertising your achievements and referencing them in your approaches to new writing opportunities can make all the difference in whether you make the right first impression. It’s also worth noting that we send many QF & SF scripts out to our industry roster, so just because a writer didn’t win, it doesn’t mean their work won’t be sent out.\n\nCF: When a writer wins, what can they expect from you and your contest? And what can writers do to be best prepared for capitalizing on a win?\n\nJO: At Shore Scripts things start happening for writers before they win. Our award-winning Judges read for the final round, which is an amazing opportunity for writers to share their work. Then, once the finalists are announced, we ask their permission to send their script to our amazing roster of 150+ industry professionals: producers, agents, managers, and directors all looking for new voices and new talent to work with. We advise our writers to ensure they know their story back to front, and to be ready to pitch other scripts they’ve completed in case they are asked ‘what else do you have!’ Be accessible and ready to respond when opportunity knocks. We stay in contact too. As our writers' projects develop, we're always happy to share their success and help advise if they have any questions. We're with our writers for the long-haul.\n\nCF: Are there any special elements of the script your readers are looking for that you can share?\n\nJO: Does the writer have an original voice? That’s a huge thing and so hard to master. We are looking for scripts that we can’t put down! Stories with an emotional hook that comes from the writer’s heart. It’s also essential that a writer knows how to format a screenplay correctly. The more ‘white space’ on the page the better!\n\nCF: What does your reading process look like and who are your readers?\n\nJO: We read for every stage of our competitions – that can be up to four individual assessments. We take our reading process very seriously and welcome resubmissions as we know that writers like to improve their drafts over time. Our readers are extremely experienced. They’ve read for the likes of Universal, Lionsgate, Working Title, Zoetrope, and the BBC, to name but a few. Our Judges read and decide on our overall winners.\n\nCF: Why is your contest valuable to writers?\n\nJO: Our contest is valuable to writers because we are offering a gateway into the film industry. Placing in our contests offers an outstanding opportunity to get your script into the hands of industry insiders who can make a difference. A look at our Alumni is a testament to that. We also finance short films, which is another avenue to help our writers.\n\nCF: Do you think entering contests is a good path for all aspiring writers?\n\nJO: It’s hard to say if it’s right for every writer. Only they know the answer to that. But by entering a contest like ours, a writer is giving themselves an opportunity to be discovered. If their script connects with us, we have the means of getting it into the hands of over 150 Industry Professionals.\n\nCF: When does your next competition open?\n\nJO: The Shore Scripts Short Film Fund reopens January 15th, 2019, and our FEATURE and TV PILOT contests open 1st March. You can follow Shore Scripts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nFor all the latest from Coverfly, be sure to follow us on Twitter and Facebook."
