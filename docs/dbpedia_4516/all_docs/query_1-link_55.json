        "text": "October 30, 2020\n\nA meaty 100-page novella exploring the seemingly supernatural (and spooky) elements of artistic inspiration. I think most writers—particularly those who are successful—feel perplexed by their own abilities. Maybe it's imposter syndrome, maybe it's demonic possession, but ask \"where do you get your ideas\" and you'll likely see a dark shadow fall across their face before receiving a vague response.\n\nWhere do ideas come from? Is a writer really the mastermind behind fiction, or are they merely servants transcribing a cosmic signal?\n\nIn a way, that's the premise of this story—and many other classic novels going at least as far back as Faust. Stephen King also explored this topic in Lisey's Story, which might explain his praise for this book. Joe Hill, his son, called The Devil's Own Work a \"perfect\" novel along with The Turn of the Screw.\n\nI disagree that it's perfect, but the writing does remind me of Henry James. There's close male friendship with a verbose narrator who chronicles the story in a journalistic, outside observer kind of way. I'm not a fan of The Turn of the Screw, but I do like this Victorian style of storytelling. Though first published in 1991, it could just as easily have been written in 1891. Unfortunately, as I often feel when reading Victorian ghost stories, the second half (after the supernatural is introduced) does not live up to the first.\n\nDuring the set-up, we are introduced to the premise of a fledgling writer who discovers unexpected fame after penning a devastating review of a popular writer's latest novel. The novelist invites him over for a private interview and dies during the meeting, under most unusual circumstances. As we ease into the supernatural the intrigue reaches fever pitch. This is usually when Victorian ghost stories struggle to decide how to steer the story, and Judd falls into a similar trap.\n\nThe second half meanders, gets weird—why does it turn sexual?—and fails to capitalize on the inertia of the setup. Not an unpleasant reading experience, but occasionally slapdash and definitely not perfect. Judd's smartest decision, I think, was to keep this novella-length. The pacing is just right for fleshing out characters and building a fictional reality, but not so lackadaisical that we're forced to read filler. There’s a good feeling where the story will end up, and when the conclusion happens we're glad to not have spent more time than necessary to get there.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable way to spend three hours. Despite the short length there is a lot of substance and the themes make for an interesting discussion—particularly for an audience of writers. I think the King's oversell it, but there's no doubt that's The Devil’s Own Work is of higher quality than your average reading.\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\n4.5/5\n\nThe Devil's Own Work is a beautifully written, subtly told Faustian tale, which the narrator performs perfectly.\n\nA man relates the story of his friend, Edward, and how he became a famous and successful writer. A writer who, although he writes many words, ultimately has nothing of substance to say. Further along, we discover that Edward inherited a manuscript from a recently deceased author named Tyrell. With that manuscript he also seems to have inherited a beautiful, ageless woman named Eudoxy.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we learn more about the manuscript, (which only can be read one letter at a time, because to try to see an actual word results in the reader seeing gibberish.) It's when this manuscript falls into Edward's hands that he suddenly becomes successful. Is that because of the manuscript itself, or because of the mysterious Eudoxy? You'll have to read this to find out!\n\nThis novella length story is tight and slow to build. There isn't necessarily a denouement, but instead a growing realization of horror and what is truly involved. If you are a reader expecting a lot of action, this isn't the tale for you. However, if you have a love of language and precise storytelling, AND this premise sounds intriguing to you, I highly recommend you give The Devil's Own Work a try. It probably won't provoke any screams or shouts of terror from you, but I bet it will give you a bad case of the heebies-jeebies.\n\nHighly recommended!\n\n*This audiobook was provided free of charge by the narrator, in exchange for my honest feedback. This is it.*\n\nSeptember 3, 2017\n\nIn the old-school horror vein of an M.R. James, no outright gore just subtlety, atmosphere and suggestion. An invitation from a world famous author to the man who just penned a scathing critique of his latest work, is the basis of the story. As we move through the tale it becomes apparent that all is not as it seems and the authors' success is directly related to an ancient manuscript. Add in a mysterious woman who is associated with the author and the enigmatic story deepens.\n\nI listened to the audiobook after an online discussion with the narrator, Matt Godfrey and he suggested I give this a try. I have to say I was impressed with his narration, it was exactly what the story needed, nuanced and subtle while at the same time engaging. Well worth the few dollars I spent for the audiobook.\n\n7/10\n\nNovember 30, 2022\n\nBeautifully written, The Devil’s Own Work is the tale of a haunted writer. This character, known only as Edward, achieves success and fame at a high cost – but we see the whole thing unfold through the eyes of his admiring (and somewhat wimpy) friend, whose name we never learn. The book’s brevity presents a conundrum: it’s good partly because the style is so elegantly concise, but I’d like to have read much more about every character, every scene. More of a short story than a novella, really, but a good one, with something of M.R. James about it.\n\nTinyLetter | Linktree\n\nApril 7, 2024\n\nSolo review: 3.9/5\n\nWith annotations: 5/5\n\nThe book itself was quite interesting (more like a novella), and the plot itself was certainly unique compared to what I've read before. I think it's really interesting how Judd spruces in (what I assume are) his own perspectives on being an author (I don't remember the exact quote but there's something about how honesty is the most crucial factor for writing, for example), and while the story's a bit depressing, it definitely offers some insight into what might be considered as important for writing as a career. Maybe I'll have to think about some of this in my own writing, although I don't know if I agree with all of it.\n\nPlot was really cool, but I did feel that the characters themselves lacked a bit of dimension. Like, I wanted to get to understand the narrator a bit more and really empathize with him, but I felt like I couldn't just because of Judd's style of writing. There were some details that I felt should've been replaced by or added to with emotion, as I think that definitely could've helped. The ending was also depressing, although it kinda fit the rest of the book.\n\nAs for the annotations though, this is I think the first annotated book I've ever read! Thanks Violet! So much fun and I loved how it wasn't only my own thoughts on the page as I was reading. Really helped to get another perspective on the book as a whole, which was a very cool experience. This also means if I ever annotate another book, I think I gotta improve my own annotating skills...\n\nMay 15, 2019\n\nValancourt Books is turning out some truly great older forgotten or neglected works of fiction. Major kudos to them for brining back some of these rarer works that I may have otherwise missed.\n\nI listened to this one on audio and as usual, Matt Godfrey nailed it. I don’t think I have ever listened to anything narrated by Matt that wasn’t done supremely well. Of course, it helps when the story is great as well but sometimes narration can elevate the experience. Well done, sir.\n\nAs far as the story itself, I loved it. It was subtle and sinister and brooding and much darker than the words on the page. Plus, I’m a sucker for stories about nefarious old book and manuscripts.\n\nSeptember 11, 2017\n\nThe Devil's Own Work is exquisite in its precise delivery and command - I felt I was in the hands of a master. Matt Godfrey's narration is a compliment to Alan Judd's prose, capturing perfectly the tone of the story and adding nuance in all the right places. I loved every moment. I also found this story to be timely as hell with the assertion that evil is the destruction of truth (and the opposite of art). The Devil's Own Work, indeed. The commentary on literary criticism and the literary world in general was humorous and masterful in its subversion. There is a lot packed into this short novel and the production is top notch. Highly recommended.\n\nMarch 3, 2024\n\nvintage edition!!! 1995 baby\n\nI was really scared this book was going to be bad but it actually wasn't! I feel like I learned a lot about the writing process that authors go through, so that was really cool. the narrator was an interesting fellow i must say.\n\nI liked the fictive realism (??) part to the novel, especially since Edward wrote fictive realism himself. it made me feel more connected to the characters for some reason. also Eudoxie?? what the heck. who even is she bro\n\nSeptember 20, 2020\n\nI don't really want to give this book a 1 star rating because I liked the writing style and it flowed in a great way, but the story was so forgettable to me that I just finished reading it and am not sure what happened. Two authors had some conversations. One of them might have had a magical pen???\n\nOctober 1, 2016\n\nThis novella is an interesting story of obsession told in the form of possession. The narrator is an observer to his friend, Edward's, demise. Edward is a rising author who wrote a not so favorable critique of O.M. Tyrrel's most recent novel. Edward is invited to meet with Tyrrel, who mysteriously dies that same night. Edward's career then skyrockets, but at what cost? Edward appears haunted, even tormented, despite his fame and success. The tale involves an old manuscript that appears written in code, which Tyrrel passes along to Edward. There is also Eudoxie, the beautiful young woman who comes with the book. Is Edward finding inspiration from the old manuscript and simply slips into madness, or is he actually enslaved to continue on the legacy of all books that need to be written, regardless of who the author is?\n\nI found this story to be quite odd, but completely captivating. It was an easy read and left me thinking about it days after I'd finished it. I may just read it again!\n\nMarch 30, 2014\n\nAn odd little tale about the dark side of being a writer, this novella does what good novellas do best. It tells a memorable story quickly in the sharpest of prose, providing useful insights in a plot rich with metaphor. Highly recommended for writers who like to think about the dual nature of literary fame.\n\nJuly 22, 2011\n\nCreated subtly shadowed supernatural literary world and an intriguing tale in 100 pages on the nature of writing, books and losing autonomy for commercial success.\n\nFebruary 1, 2011\n\nI didn't even really realize how much I had enjoyed this book until the very end which is strange considering how rocky my start with it was. For one thing this book is really, shall we say, un-intense? I started reading it in bed and I couldn't keep my eyes open, I actually fell asleep while reading it and after waking from my short nap I tried to tackle it again. The writing isn't perfect and sometime's the characters fall into the classic horror genera stupidity needed in order to progress the plot forward. And yet, in between all this is a very scary, highly believable story about a man making contact with a demon. The part about the two of them embracing to complete his contract has haunted me for days even though it was only described in the vaguest of terms. And that to me is this books greatest power, it's ability to imply everything and say nothing. What lays outside the realms of normal human understanding? What if someone close to us suddenly confessed they had made contact with true evil and were now in a battle of wits for their soul? Is the struggle for something intangible any less riveting because of a lack of faith on behalf of the listener? I don't think so, and I have a sneaking suspicion Mr Judd doesn't either.\n\nSo while this isn't necessarily the best book I've read all year (as the blurb from Mr King on the front attests), it was a far cry from the worst either, and at just under 100 pages few are left with an excuse to not at least give this a once over.\n\nRead\n\nApril 2, 2017\n\nTight, visceral, brilliant little novel with tunnel vision, in the best way. It knows what it is and what it wants to do, and it does those things and nothing more. If this sounds vague that's because it has to be. Don't even read the synopsis, just give yourself an hour or two and read it.\n\nMay 2, 2016\n\nA delightful gem of a book that engages as much by what it leaves out as what it includes. Recommended by Stephen King in \"On Writing.\"\n\nMarch 1, 2017\n\nShort and entertaining story written with care.\n\nApril 7, 2022\n\nThe Devil's Own Work was first published in 1991, with Stephen King calling it the best book he read that year. Alan Judd's novel is a variation on the Faust myth, this one centering on an aspiring writer. The prose is gorgeous. It's a title that begs to be read aloud on a rainy night. The Faust-y part of the plot is perfect in its mix of simplicity and detail.\n\nSo why only 3 stars? I loved reading this book, but once I was done, I realized that well-written as it was, it also was one of those books focused on male characters who had aspirations and female characters who didn't. Basically the women were there to sleep with the men or to present the kind of menace you'd expect from a Faustian tale, but with no motivation or depth to their portrayal. I sort of felt the way I would after eating a one-pound box of chocolates on my own. Yum! But also kind of same old-same old.\n\nBy all means, read this book. It will probably entertain you, but unless you're Stephen King, it probably won't be the best book you read all year—and certainly won't be the most original\n\nAugust 25, 2017\n\nThis was an interesting, and very literary, take on Faust, with a bit of metaphorical vampirism thrown in. There is nothing explicit here, neither violence nor sex, but there is quite a bit of implied sex.\n\nThe narrator's friend, Edward, becomes a major literary figure after the death of a major author. That is the premise of this subtle chiller, which the author uses to skewer the literati and question the trade-offs of fame. His conclusion seems to be that artists need to be true to themselves, but for everyone else, that way spells doom.\n\nStill, despite that rather sobering opinion, this is a fantastic read, quick and easy yet containing quite a bit to mull over. Anyone who digs more literate and intelligent horror would do well to pick this up.\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\na competent horror novella but i found the writing to be on the pompous side of elegant and i wasn’t particularly compelled by any of the characters bar eudoxie, who receives little focus and is very much Written By A Man when she does get it\n\nMarch 19, 2019\n\nThis is a Faust retelling that is partially about a review of a Faust retelling, I wanted it to be both deliciously meta and creepy. To that end, there are some early sharp foreboding moments like:\n\n‘It was probably for only a few seconds that neither of us spoke, but quite suddenly the silence became oppressive. It changed with the rapidity of focus in a film and the effect on me was like one of those terrifying dreams from which you cannot free yourself; you lie, conscious and impotent, beneath a great weight of fear, your soul- if that’s what it is- fluttering like a stricken bird. I tried to speak and it seemed that for a long time I couldn’t, though it may have been for no time at all. Finally, I said how quiet it was, and felt my heart thumping in my chest as if I had escaped something’.\n\nI just wish there were more memorable moments like this. Unfortunately considering this novella is so short it feels like this book takes a little while to get going. There are several moments when the narrative pauses so the protagonist can warn the reader of the horror that’s to come. This undoubtedly a genre staple designed to add dread but the frequency of it, especially in such a short (less than a 100 page) novella led to this feeling a little repetitive and distancing.\n\nE.g: ‘I shall not relate all of what follows in the sequence in which it revealed itself to me. If I did, you would read in the very fog in which I myself lived for so many years.’\n\n‘Throughout this account, I am trying to record what happened, or what appeared to happen, because it may be happening still. But after all these years I cannot always be clear of what did happen, especially as it was not clear at the time’.\n\nJust because the book is not as creepy as I would’ve liked is not in of itself a dealbreaker in that is supposed to also be somewhat satirical. In the way that this book is both a Faust based ghost story and a satire of the literary scene, remind me a little of Velvet Buzzsaw. Unfortunately, my reactions to both this book and that film were similar in that I didn’t really feel like either of them let themselves be either fully developed satire or horror pieces. Perhaps it was unfair to think a book this short would be able to parody the literary world effectively. But in actuality, the critiques of literature seem to be less a satire and more of an argument about style the author is trying to persuade you on, which is just less interesting to me personally.\n\nA related problem is that the main character is a little unlikable which would be fine except I’m not sure the book knows he’s unlikeable. The biggest example of this I can think of is when the narrator assumes his marriage is failing because of early menopause and refuses to listen when his wife tells him it’s not. (Perhaps this is the work showing its age but misogyny isn’t going to get me on the protagonist’s side.)Most of the protagonists of these sort of horror tales that are narrating someone else’s story are a blank everyman type (Susan Hill’s Printer’s Devil Court comes to mind) but he isn’t relatable enough for that. As I say an unlikable protagonist isn’t necessarily a bad thing but when the author uses him to share a thesis about style in novels and postmodernism it is. Generally, when someone is trying to be persuasive I find its better if you at least want to hear his side.\n\nWith most Faust retellings I’ve read/watched a big part of them is watching the character be seduced by the life they are buying into however because this is being related by a different character with the power of hindsight we miss out on all of that. I can’t help but feel like a book about Edward being seduced into the style over substance literary world would’ve made a more compelling read and a much more interesting satire. Although it had its moments, unfortunately, I can’t say I recommend this book.\n\nFebruary 5, 2012\n\nA neat little novella that's well-structured. It has predictable plot, but however still an enjoyable read. What I find lacking is in its list of characters, it's narrow and a little bit too few. Everything revolves around the protagonist and his friend, the others are practically ghosts. I'm not sure the author had considered to explore options that can go with the plot. There are loopholes that are unanswered, leaving me dissatisfied, somehow. It falls in the grey area. Not sure whether I should pass this as eerie, creepy, or just simply old-fashioned.\n\nOctober 3, 2018\n\nThe Devil's Own Work (Valancourt 20th Century Classics) by Alan Judd (first published 1991) is about the torch-passing of such an ungodly and destructive pact between and old writer and an ambitious young writer. With this inheritance comes enormous sales, critical adulation, and decades of existential dread.\n\nhttp://jayrothermel.blogspot.com/2018...\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nThe last two novels I’ve plowed through are \"Lolita\" and \"Women and Men\", the former, a fireworks show of unrivaled wordplay and layered irony; the latter, a 1200-page verbal carpet-bombing that makes \"Ulysses\" look like \"One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish\". So, imagine my relief upon reading the first page of Alan Judd’s novella and its meticulous, spare style that jibes perfectly with the story’s unnerving creepiness.\n\nThe title comes from a sentence at the midpoint of the book when the narrator writes, “I do now believe that anything that confuses reality and unreality, or that attempts to equate the two, is the devil’s own work.” The observation grows out of the narrator’s general view of post-modern fiction’s embrace of “fictive realism”, but applies more relevantly to the evolution of the writings, first, of the venerated “Old Man” Oliver M. Tyrrel and, later, his protégé, Edward. It also applies to the narrator’s own account.\n\nAuthor Alan Judd numbers among his six published works a biography of Ford Madox Ford, whose novel “The Good Soldier” contains what many consider to be the best example in English literature of the unreliable narrator. As Judd’s own unreliable narrator notes, “Contrary to what is often said, the everyday language we use for describing what happens to us is quite well suited to its purpose; it is—or can be made to be—precise. It is much more difficult to describe the half-world in which things half-happen, in which something may become visible only when it is looked for, audible only when listened for, present only when expected.”\n\nThe narrator’s language describing meals and meetings is nothing if not precise. On the other hand, his account of Edward’s triumphant career (in the eyes of the general public) and subsequent decline (in his own eyes and eventually the general public’s) is one of utter unreality, based on the discovery that Edward’s output is a product of a mysterious manuscript bequeathed by Tyrrel just before his death and the control exerted by the ageless consort Eudoxie. After all, this wild unreality must be real because, as the narrator says in the opening line of the book, “I had it, you see, from Edward himself….” The result of the narrator’s mash-up of the real and the unreal to describe “the half-world in which things half-happen” is, of course, \"The Devil’s Own Work\".\n\nHow this book is so ignored as to not be available on Kindle is a mystery. Any creative writing class worth its salt should employ it as a primer on narrative technique and theme development, the latter of which is on a par with such acknowledged classics as J.M. Cotzee's \"Disgrace\" and Thomas Mann's \"Death in Venice\". Forget \"Stoner\" and \"Power of the Dog\". This is a true neglected classic.\n\nFebruary 28, 2018\n\nThis novelette is a little gem! How to classify it? Perhaps a Faustian parable, comparable in some ways to Tolstoy's allegory How Much Land Does a Man Need\n\nI seldom quote passages, but some of these are too good to omit: \"He was the doyen of English letters. For decades he had squatted like a toad upon the summit of literary fashion, not suppressing new movements so much as rising with them, always on top.\" p15 An observation that immediately called to mind the status enjoyed at one time by Maugham in England, Hemingway in America and nowadays by Atwood here in Canada!\n\nAnd then: \"Living with someone who appears to bear a permanent grudge is hard, especially when your ignorance of the cause is held against you, and failure to understand the other party is a charge against which there is no possibility of defence.\" p76 Surely the most incisive portrayal of a failing marriage that I've encountered.\n\nAnd \"The reality of evil is that it is the opposite of real.\" p92\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nAugust 3, 2020\n\nAudiobook, so no quotes ...\n\nMeh. I took a short road trip today and needed something short and not too taxing. This audiobook fit the bill and was fine for a couple hours of country roads, but didn't really do much for me. Felt like I'd heard the story many times before (it's a take on Faust) and often better.\n\nThe writing is fine, the audiobook performance is fine, but ... well, they're fine.\n\nThe most interesting part of the book comes in the short afterword, where the author talks about his inspirations for the story. Knowing he spun the plot and one of the main characters out of a real-life meeting with Graham Greene would have been interesting information to have up front, and probably would have given the narrative a bit more juice. Coming at the end, it felt like too little too late.\n\nOctober 14, 2018\n\nSometimes an author writes a book, but other times the book is its own author. Lots going on in this excellent short “strange story” (in the Aickman sense) —an exploration of the creative impulse, the erratic and erotic power of inspiration, a satiric commentary on postmodern novels, and a fine, creepy tale. Perfect October reading.\n\nFebruary 10, 2018\n\nA quick read of a novella about a writer who makes a Faustian deal. I really liked it, but the praise of how this is a \"classic\" and a \"perfect novel\" is praise only reserved for writers themselves, whom this story really hits close to home.\n\nJune 10, 2018\n\nI picked this book up because Stephen King reviewed it. While not scary, I'd call this book haunting. It reads like one long journal entry of a man watching another's plagued life. Alan Judd is a great writer if this work demonstrates his typical style."
