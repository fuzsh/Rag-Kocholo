        "text": "Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) are an integral part of development and survival of people living in and around forests. The potential economic value of NTFPs either in terms of utilization or their market value is often underestimated or unknown. The present study was conducted to document NTFPs collected by local people and their usage in Heggarani, Hutgar and Hukli villages of Siddapur taluk by participatory discussion method through the questioner survey. In the present study, a total of 19 NTFP species belonging to 17 families are documented. Among different NTFP species, Garcinia gummigutta (100%), Garcinia indica (100%), Artocarpus lacucha (100%) are the major species harvested in high quantity. The edible fruits (41%) are the major NTFP products harvested by the farmers followed by bark (14%), seed (14%), leaves (9%), aril (9%) and roots (9%). Maximum revenue is obtained from Garcinia gummigutta (Rs. 82,666/annum) followed by Garcinia indica (Rs. 18,540/annum.\n\nNon-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) are the forest products except timber used for various purposes from which economic status of the country can be increased through green growth based economy. The study was conducted in Baghmara Buffer Zone Community Forest for the inventory, to document various uses and find out the preferred NTFPs potential for economic development of Community Forest User Groups. Stratified random sampling was applied in which 50 quadrats of size 25m×20m for trees, 100 subplots of 10m×10m for shrubs and 200 small subplots of 1m×1msize for herbs and climbers were taken. Parameters like density, frequency, abundance, importance value index, diversity index, evenness index and dominance index were calculated to find out the ecological status of NTFPs. Questionnaire survey of 100 households was done for studying different uses and interview with 10 key informants were carried out to identify 10 most preferred NTFPs. Altogether, 109 NTFPs were enumerated. Trewia nudi...\n\nNon-timber Forest Products (NTFPs) play an important role as traditional source for food, fiber, fodder, and medicine and offer income opportunities for poverty alleviation especially in rural households in Nepal who engage in a widespread trade of NTFPs. Adequate planning for sustainable use of NTFPs is imperative so we explored the inventory of multipurpose trees and herbs that are being used as NTFPs in Chitwan, Nepal. 70 households from Sukranagar and Mangalpur VDCs of Chitwan district were randomly selected and personal interviews were taken with them as well as focus group discussions were done. The community had been utilizing 49 plant species from the nearby community forest. Implementation of the policy of community forestry was found to have a positive impact on the sustainable production of NTFPs. More than 80% of the respondents believed that indigenous knowledge promoted sustainable NTFP production. Kurilo (Asparagus officinalis) was found to be the best NTFP for the st...\n\nTinsukia district of Assam (India) is rich in natural wealth. The district has total forest area about 1,55,97,900 hector which includes one Biosphere reserve, one National Park, two Wildlife Sanctuaries and thirty five Reserve Forests. A good number of villages are situated in and around these forests. Major part of the population of the district is dependent directly or indirectly on the forest resources. Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFPs) are remarkably contributing to livelihoods of the people living near the forest areas. They are collecting wild edible plants & plant?s parts, fire wood, medicine, condiments, house building & thatching materials, broom, fiber, resin, fodder plants, etc. for their domestic use as well as for trade. NTFPs, like wild edible plants are of great demand, especially in the urban areas. This ever increasing demand of NTFPs is creating a potential threat of over exploitation to the forest resources. But, judicious use of NTFPs may provide a regular source of income & employment to a large section of the society across age group in the district.\n\nThe Apatani, non-nomadic tribe, have evolved an ecologically sustainable system of rural forestry in Ziro Valley, a proposed heritage site of UNESCO. They have been using non-timber forest products (NTFPs) grown in homestead and nearby forests for a very long period. The present study was aimed at identification of priority NTFPs and uses, their availability status and availability trend, conservation need, and sustainability interventions. Qualitative methods of research like, exploratory survey, questionnaire survey, focus group discussion, semi-structured interview of key informants, etc. were employed for data collection. The Apatani used 112 priority NTFPs for food supplement, herbal medicine, house building material and other purposes. However, on the basis of ecological importance such NTFPs were categorized as very low, low, moderate, high, and very high vulnerable species. Twenty vulnerable species like Antiitari ayi (Actinidia callosa), Biiling (Choerospondias axillaris), Henchi (Rubus niveus), Jojuru ayi (Coccinia grandis), Ngiilyang Khiiko (Centella asiatica) etc. should be conserved and seventeen not vulnerable species at this stage like, Padii hamang (Cardamine hirsute), Sankhe (Quercus griffithii), Bije (Phyllostachys manii), Hiigu hamang (Oenanthe javanica), Kiira (Quercus dealbata), etc. could be commercialized. However, a balance needed to be struck between commercialization and conservation by adopting a comprehensive policy based on scientific and traditional Apatani knowledge for harvesting and regeneration of NTFPs. Homegardening or community farming is recommended for sustainable supply of commercially important species to be domesticated.\n\nNon-timber forest products are important component of subsistence and livelihood of tribal communities living in and near forests. This is of particular significance in the state of Arunachal Pradesh having more than 80% of geographical area under forest cover and predominantly inhabited by tribal people. Purpose of this study was to document the status and utilization pattern and to assess the economic value of NTFPs of the state. Present study was carried out in eight districts of Arunachal Pradesh viz., Changlang, East Kameng, Lower Subansiri, Tawang, Tirap, Upper Siang, West Kameng and West Siang covering 34 villages and 350 households. Altogether, 135 plant based and 36 animal based non-timber forest products were recorded. Among plant based NTFPs, 54 species were collected for leaves, 30 for stem and 22 for fruits. Most of the animal based NTFPs (93%) were collected/hunted for food. Average 20∼40 kg of NTFPs was collected annually per household. Maximum plant based NTFP collection was recorded from West Siang followed by West Kameng and Tawang. Similarly, highest collection of animal based NTFPs was recorded from West Siang followed by Tirap and Lower Subansiri. NTFP contributed more than 50% of annual income of the people of East Kameng, Tirap, Lower Subansiri and Upper Siang districts. An illiterate and unemployed person with minimum agricultural land was more dependent on forests for his livelihood than a literate jobholder. The study concludes that a large section of people of Arunachal Pradesh are dependent on NTFPs for their livelihood however due to its unscientific harvesting, the availability of NTFPs is receding with time. There is an urgent need to promote cultivation and scientific harvesting of NTFPs in order to conserve the plant and animal diversity of this global biodiversity hotspot and for ensuring livelihood security of the people living in this area."
