        "text": "Unified platform is guaranteed to collective efforts for mutual cooperation and prosperity. The mutual cooperation and collaboration bring stability and development among member countries. Internally, Muslim world is suffering under bad governance, corruption, malpractices, poverty, backwardness, ignorance, social injustices, unemployment, inequality, immoral values. The other are extremisms, terrorism, regional and territorial conflicts are with its full swing in most of the countries of the Islamic world. While, externally the western aggression, Islamophobia and anti-Islamist propaganda, Kashmir, Palestine and misbehave with Muslim minorities by the host countries are another challenges. Some other factors which increase distrust among them are internal sectarian and territorial rivalry, for example, both Iran and Saudi-Arabia have aggressive policy against each other as well as some materialistic and self-governing minded leadership have soft corner towards India, western countries as well as United States (US). Role of Organization of Islamic cooperation OIC in enhancing cooperation among Muslim countries is the dire need of current world by resolving their internal disputes, maintaining global peace and collective security. In this research qualitative techniques will be applied.\n\nThe Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) is an international organisation consisting of 57 member States of Muslim confession, also Palestina. This organisation is \"the collective voice of the Muslim world\" and works to \"safeguard and protect the interests of the Muslim world in the spirit of promoting international peace and harmony\". In 28 June 2011 during the 38th Council of Foreign Ministers meeting (CFM) in Astana (Kazakhstan) the organisation changed its name from Organisation of the Islamic Conference to its current name.The OIC also changed its logo at this time.The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has a permanent delegation of the United Nations and it's the second largest international organisation outside the United Nations. In recent years it has been increasing its importance in the international society and it has played an important role in regional conflicts RESUMEN: La Organización para la Cooperación Islámica(OCI) es una organización que agrupa a 57 Estados de confesión musulmana, incluyendo Palestina. Esta organización es la voz del mundo musulmán y trabaja para salvaguardar y proteger los intereses del mundo musulmán en el espíritu de promover la paz y la armonía internacional. El 28 de junio de 2011, durante la 38 reunión del Consejo de Asuntos exteriores en Astana (Kazajistán) la organización cambió su nombre de Organización de la Conferencia islámica al nombre actual. La OCI también cambió su logo en ese momento. La OCI tiene una delegación permanente en Naciones Unidas y es la segunda organización internacional más grande después de ésta. En los últimos años ha aumentado su importancia en la sociedad internacional y ha jugado un importante papel en los conflictos regionales.\n\nIslamic countries in the world, was founded in 1969 with the aim of building solidarity for Muslim countries around the world. There are various forms of solidarity, such as voicing human rights and humanitarian issues, especially those experienced by Muslim countries . The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is a clear example of how Muslims are treated arbitrarily without clear sanctions for the perpetrators. The conflict, which has been raging for a long time, has not been resolved to this day, causing misery to millions of Muslims ( civil society) in the Palestinian territories. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) plays an important role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Even though the OIC is not directly involved in the conflict, the OIC has provided political and moral support to Palestine. As an organization of Islamic countries, the OIC has an interest in fighting for Palestinian rights and resolving the conflict peacefully. The method used in writing this journal is a descriptive analytical method with a primarily normative juridical approach. Analytical descriptive means describing and describing something that is the object of research critically through qualitative analysis. Apart from using a normative approach, this research also uses a case approach to see the extent to which the OIC organization is responding to various kinds of international problems. The results of the discussion are in its work, the role oriented towards cooperation and peace carried out by the OIC, namely, the OIC has held internal OIC high-level meetings or conferences in response to a problem or conflict involving OIC member countries. These OIC activities created a program called the OIC 10-year Program of Actions which marked a change in the focus of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation from initially only focusing on political issues, to having various focuses such as human rights, social and economic. Keywords : OIC, Conflict, International.\n\nThis article aims at analysing the international legal personality of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and its significance for nowadays war against terrorism. As an international organization, the OIC lacks of a body enforcing recommendation and resolution adopted by the organization. As a consequence, the OIC is deemed to be a marginal player in international politics which are not able to influence international affairs. Likewise, some even doubt its capability to bear an idealistic objective, namely to defend the interest of all Muslims around the world (the ummah). Considering the complex nature of nowadays terrorisms, i.e., difficulties in defining terrorism and determining terrorist, however, the OIC may play an important role in combating terrorism. This is done, this article argues, through optimizing cooperation on education and information about the true concept of jihad and image of Islam among state parties as well as international community."
