I am a goalie for Team BC for the Vancouver Super Series, and think that it is really great that so many people are supporting the sport. I was watching the Canada vs USA game yesterday and found it rather entertaining and really great hockey. They brought up the subject about wether we should be allowed to body check. I know I'm a goalie, and wouldn't get hit, but I still think that body checking is part of hockey as long as it doesn't get out of hand. Womens hockey is a great sport, but if they are going to want lots of publicity, they might want to consider making body checking legal. Best of luck to all aspiring young players, tiana Feel free to reply if you would like. Tiana16@hotmail.com Information about guest, Tiana Velestuk (Tiana16@hotmail.com)...

HI! Great to find women in hockey on-line. I'm hoping for some help. Myself and four other women had been at home to long as hockey wives and mother. We finally took a pause from cleaning and waiting for the kids to get off the bus. The help I'm looking for is that we need to get more women involved. We are shooting for moms and stay at home wives, because of our ice-time. Everyone is really helpful here and they let us have two hours for $18.00. That's is for all of us. And in Maryland that is as cheap as it gets. But back to the point is how do we get women envolved? We have tried the flyers at the ice-rinks (5 local ones) We've tried word of mouth and so many practicle way. So if possible,if there are any ideas we would really be thankful. Regardless of what happens we will continue to skate and get women on the ice. We have great support from the Washington Capitals as we practice in there training center. But most of all the Bowie,MD. Hockey arena for the cheap ice-time. If nothing else wish us the best of luck! And good luck to all women in hockey!

Dear Andria, I am a huge fan of womens hockey and I was just wondering if, you could have me out with something. I recently found out that France St. Louis, was a cousin of mine, and I was wondering if you would happen to know a way in which I could contact her. It doesn't even have to be directly but I just wanted to say Hi. Anyway I thought that it was kind of cool because she has always been my \"Hockey Hero\" and by chance we both wear #3. If you could help me out or if you wanted to give her a shout saying that I'm out here, it would be totally awesome. I would also like to tell you that I think you are doing and amazing job on promoting womens hockey, and on maintaining this page.

I have been playing Hockey for about 8 yrs. now and I love the sport more than life itself.I even get excited when I have a practice! I love the way people react when you tell them you play hockey and you're a girl. They really think you're something. But some males still think the sport is their's and react quite negatively. Why can't they just grow up and realize women can play Hockey just as good as them. Information about guest, Sonya Lynk (sonya@ns.sympatico.ca)...

I play for Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs NY. We are a club team that is trying for Varsity status. However, our school is very hesitant about allowing us varsity status for some unknown reason. I captained the team for two years and while in captaincy the budget went from $2000 to $10000. You think that with more women involved int he sport the school would be excited about making it a varsity level team. We play other varsity level teams and are quite competitive with them.

Hi, I am a 13 year old female and play Roller Hockey in Atlanta, Georgia. I play in a boys league, with about 3 other girls, and personally i think I am the most interested out of all 4 of us girls. I know a couple of older woman that play, but not enough to make a team, I have been trying to find enough girls to atleast make a girls team even if we have to play against all guys. I also do not enjoy ice skating so would never be able to play ice hockey, which i know is alot more popular than roller. I would like to be able to play in atleast one girls tournament, which I have no clue how to go about doing that, even if i have to be on a team with people i do not know!! I was wondering if you would know of any Roller Hockey tournaments for women of my age or close to it that are near Goergia??? Thanks for your time!!

We are looking for women of all ages, from 16 yrs to whatever, to build enough teams to have a functioning Women's League. We have an Intermediate and a Novice level team so far. Many of our members are brand new players. We have coaching for all levels. Many of our players are Moms with little ones too, so that's no excuse not to play. We also have women from as far away as Thousand Oaks and Temecula. If you know of any interested women in the greater San Diego County area looking for good time and lots of good excersize, have them call Escondido Iceoplex, 760-489-5550 ext. 270 or e-mail me at glaztiger@aol.com. NO EXPERIENCE NECESSARY! If you know any Sponsors looking for a good cause, we are a non-profit organization looking to grow. We just returned from the Las Vegas Women's Hockey Classics.

Don't know if you remember meeting me while I was up for the World Championship last March/April. Thought I would drop you a line. How about those Olympics!!! Great for the game of Women's Hockey. USA finally had the chance to feel the excitement of winning gold. Team Canada looked so sad though it was hard to watch some of the camera shots. They shouldn't feel bad at all both teams were terrific. I think overall with the USA winning that it is going to do far more for the game here in the states. There will probably be more of a chance for young girls to start in the sport knowing that at least for now the Olympics can be the highest goal to reach. I started playing roller hockey with my brother and was really enjoying it till we lost access to the gym we were using. Now we are trying to talk my dad into letting us pour a concrete slab on his property so we can play year round. Well, I know you are probably very busy so I won't keep you much longer.

You're probably going to start getting a lot of hits on your web site after that wonderful Olympic gold medal game! Of course, that opinion shows my bias as someone who was rooting for Team USA! I've always loved hockey, and never really even thought about women's hockey until a friend started playing last year. I was even more psyched about seeing the Olympic games on TV -- at least here, they gave it really great coverage! Suprising amount, too, since I'd basically expected to see the same token lip service they gave to the women's softball in the '96 summer games. I'm hoping that this really sparks some serious interest in women's hockey, and that semi-pro and pro teams are not far off in our future, once we can develop a wider interest in the sport.

Hi Both my sister and I play for the Polar Bears Women's Ice Hockey Team in Melbourne, Australia. I am 15 and Diana is 13. We were born in Toronto and our coach is from Quebec. Canadians make the best hockey players. We have a lot of problems recruiting girls to play hockey. We have to play C grade Men's teams for practice and they think girls should not play hockey. We lose a lot because the teams are not based on age restrictions and it can be depressing. Hoping to visit Toronto at the end of the year to take some hockey clinics. If you can write back can you suggest any sites that can give information on hockey clinics. We can stay from middle December and all of January. Liked your page a lot.

I think that it is great that women play hockey.\\ I started skating last season in a boy's league as a Midget. The checking was fun, but the guys can cry all they want, whereas a girl has to be tougher and can't show her pain. This season I played on the boy's team again, and started skating on a girl's team, which are hard to find here in sunny Florida.

So if you could be so kind as to provide more details either through your website, forwarding this to Stacey Wilson or by sending the info to us(e-mail), we would be very appreciative. Keep up the great work, and thanks for the site. Vicki Thomas, Fredericton, N. B. Information about guest, VICKI tHOMAS (crthomas@nbnet.nb.ca)... I am from Fredericton, N.B.

I think that it is great to see the growth of womens hockey be so successful. It makes me feel good when I see girls as young as five or six playing the sport that was once so male dominated. It is also wonderful that now at my age, and girls younger than I have women like you to look up to. Thank You! Information about guest, April Pramataris (apviper31@aol.com)... I am from Lynn, Ma.

Message from guest... Your link to Dolphins Hockey Team in Melbourne has a fault as there is no information about the Dolphins. Presently in Melbourne we have Angels, Melbourne Thunder (Inline girls who play ice hockey in winter), Louisville and Polar Bears (of which I have two daughters playing). The Polar Bears was established last year and ages range from 13 to 30. We have played Adelaide women's teams Flames and Black Widows last year and hope to play them again this year as well as a Canberra Team. If you would like to add more information about Melbourne Teams I would be happy to prepare some text for you. Information about guest, Anne Marie Vujovich (a.vujovich@science.unimelb.edu.au)...

I am a hockey player in Atoms. I am in a speech contest that must have a researched subject. I want to talk about girls who play hockey, but because we were only allowed to have own last year, i am having a really hard time finding and information on the origins of women's hockey. Your website is the best and has the most information I could find. My mom said there was a profile on the news about a women's hockey team about 50 years ago in Ontario, but i can't find anything out about them. I would much rather be playing hockey than writing speeches :) Information about guest, Kati Parkinson (jedwords@telusplanet.net)...

This year was the first year I broadcast girls high school hockey. I was most impressed not just by our local team, but with the style of play. It was much more fun to broadcast the girls games than the boys. I hope the game continues to grow and the finesse style of play continues. Keep up the good work on your site.
