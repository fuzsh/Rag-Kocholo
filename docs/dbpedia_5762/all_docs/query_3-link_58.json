        "text": "“The advice of their elders to young men is very apt to be as unreal as a list of the hundred best books.”\n\n—Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. (18411935)\n\n“Weigh what loss your honor may sustain\n\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\n\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\n\nTo his unmastered importunity.”\n\n—William Shakespeare (15641616)\n\n“If they be two, they are two so\n\nAs stiff twin compasses are two;\n\nThy soul, the fixed foot, makes no show\n\nTo move, but doth if th other do.”\n\n—John Donne (15721631)\n\n“Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.”\n\n—Julius J. Epstein (19091952)\n\n“of the satanic thistle that raises its horned symmetry\n\nflowering above sister grass-daisies pink tiny\n\nbloomlets angelic as lightbulbs”\n\n—Allen Ginsberg (b. 1926)\n\n“Whilst we want cities as the centres where the best things are found, cities degrade us by magnifying trifles.”\n\n—Ralph Waldo Emerson (18031882)"
