        "text": "(Zurich, Lucerne, Interlaken, Bern, in Switzerland ‚Äì 3 June 2014) About a week before our visit to Switzerland, I stumbled on one of those articles about the happiest people on Earth. Switzerland topped the list of nations. [Link to article] The article went on to explain the reasons why this might be the case, but my imagination was way out in front‚Ä¶ creating the magical, utopian world that Switzerland would surely be. My acute anticipation for Switzerland was higher than it had been for any previous place we visited. The interplay between expectation and experience is tricky. I had to be wary of over-hyping it in my head.\n\nWe arrived into Zurich by train from Salzburg, Austria. It‚Äôs standard practice, as soon as we get to a new place, we head straight for whatever accommodation we reserved for the night. Just steps out of the train station was our tram stop. On the platform, we stood and marveled at the bustle of activity speeding around us. Like a ride at Disney, gleaming futuristic electric trams were coming and going with superior efficiency. It reminded me so much of the Jetsons. Cars weren‚Äôt flying, but they might as well have been.\n\nWe hopped the next tram heading to our destination and away we flew.\n\nA Good Life\n\nZurich‚Äôs dominant ‚Äúwater feature‚Äù is Lake Zurich. As the large but slender lake rounds off on its northern end, Zurich is there to cap it like an star atop a Christmas tree; practically the entire city gets a beautiful lake view. The Limmet River winds through the city and feeds the lake on its north side giving even more residents postcard views from their windows. Old-world bridges link the historical buildings that line both banks of the Limmet. Zurich is a gorgeous symphony of old and new.\n\nOn a brilliantly sunny Saturday, Jessica and I strolled the promenade that runs along the eastern shore of Lake Zurich. Everybody was out and about. The park benches had no more spaces to give, street musicians fulfilled their calling, and ice cream cones sales were breaking records. Maybe this was the first perfect spring day of the year; for Zurich was celebrating. The high ‚Äúlife-satisfaction‚Äù rating I had read about in that article was on full display.\n\nIn our travels, we‚Äôve visited countries where you are advised not to drink the water from the tap. Or, where water is so scarce they ask you to turn off the flow of water in the shower when not actively using it to wash or rinse. Here in Zurich the drinking fountains had no on/off button. The pure, fresh delicious water simply flowed non-stop.\n\nBehind our quirky faces, you will see Zurich‚Äôs park is full of activity.\n\nHere is a less obstructed view of life in the park. The group in the foreground appears to be playing a Swiss version of Bocce Ball.\n\nWe found a lively Zurich street carnival. The Ferris wheel runs on pure manpower. I join the band for a few notes. And we ate some pork on a stick slathered in a delicious buttery-mustard paste.\n\nZurich, a beautiful city all around.\n\nClean Zurich\n\nI decided to go for a long run along Lake Zurich‚Äôs west bank one afternoon while Jessica stayed and relaxed in the park. Between reading and people-watching she noticed a sanitation worker casually but diligently combing the park for trash. He was careful and methodical in his approach to each piece of trash, regardless of how large or small.\n\nWith his bag of collected trash and extension tool, the man worked his way slowly towards the shaded bench where Jessica had secured a spot. Before long he was right in front of her, still stoically doing his job- robotically picking up scraps of who-knows-what? He also picked up every cigarette butts he spotted. Just in Jessica‚Äôs immediate vicinity he cleared them one-by-one until he had bagged nearly a hundred of them. There was no hint of complaint or angst, he was just doing his job, but doing it so very well. Jessica was tempted to pop-up from her seat and shake his hand, or pat him on the back, or tip him a 10-spot, or something‚Ä¶ something to acknowledge just how impressive she had found his work ethic.\n\nJessica and I talked about the sanitation worker and the Swiss society more generally. How does one country create such a lovely environment for people to thrive and prosper while others languish in squalor and hopelessness? We‚Äôve got lots of questions, but few answers. üôÅ\n\nGreat views of all Zurich were ours when we went to Uetliberg Park.\n\nI was intent on visiting this park because it boasts a scale model (1,000,000:1) of our solar system. My right hand is pointing to the Earth, represented in the model by a silver marble (not sure why they couldn‚Äôt find a blue marble, but whatever). Just above the fingertip of my left hand is the sun. It looks tiny only because it is nearly a football field away. Up close, it has a diameter of about 4 feet.\n\nZurich‚Äôs Little Sister, Lucerne\n\nFrom Zurich we took the train south to Lucerne. Smaller than Zurich, but no less perfect, Lucerne only reinforced our image of Switzerland as one of the greatest places to live on the entire planet.\n\nWe‚Äôve stayed in many unusual or quirky places during our trip, but none were more unique than the Jailhouse Hotel. Yes, some enterprising businessman converted an old jail house into a hotel. While they could have chosen to renovate-away this fact, they decided to go for it straight on. This meant all of the rooms had the authentic look and feel of a real jail cell‚Ä¶.because that‚Äôs what they were.\n\nThe cell doors were refitted so you could NOT truly be locked in (by accident or on purpose), and each room had its own small shower, but otherwise‚Ä¶we spent four nights in a real jail cell. It was a once in a lifetime experience‚Ä¶.we hope.\n\nLucerne had some awesome sights, like the curiously beautiful wooden bridge (named Chapel Bridge) that crosses the Reuss River at a most interesting angle.\n\nSame bridge from the opposite bank.\n\nChiseled directly into the side of a sheer rock face, it is indeed the saddest lion statue ever! With no name other than Lion Monument, it commemorates the mercenary Swiss Army soldiers that were hired by King Louis XVI of France to protect the royal family. Those soldiers all died during the French Revolution‚Ä¶.as did the king.\n\nDefensive city walls were all the rage back in the day. Now they seem kind of dumb. Still fun to explore while imaging what life must have been like hundreds of years ago.\n\nPhoto of Lucerne from a lookout next to the fortress wall.\n\nSick Cellmate\n\nA strange and nagging illness started on May 1st (our last day in Italy some 4 weeks ago) with Jessica coming down with a sore throat. She carried the low-level but persistent bug through Slovenia and into Vienna‚Ä¶where it seemed to be getting worse not better. At some point it was obvious that she needed to see a doctor. She went to a clinic in Vienna and was diagnosed as having tonsillitis. A five-day regimen of antibiotics was prescribed. Some improvement followed, but now another two weeks had passed since the antibiotics were done and whatever virus was bugging her would not relent. If there was good news to report, it was that the antibiotics beat back an expanding sinus infection. Without them, I fear her condition could have become truly severe. As it was, she improved slightly but was still left with most all of the same symptoms.\n\nBy the time we were in Lucerne the frustration of being sick for so long was too much. She continued to be racked by a harsh cough, had tender and aching ears, glands under the jaw line that were visibly swollen, and congestion in her head and chest. And, of course, there was the tiredness. Enough already!\n\nNever had she been so sick for so long. It was concerning. Jessica gave in to seeing a doctor now for the second time. She recounted her story in full, received an exam, and this time got them to run a couple of blood tests. In the end, it appears what Jessica had was simply one helluva persistent virus. She was prescribed three different medicines and reassured there was nothing more serious going on; she just needed to wait it out‚Ä¶as if she hadn‚Äôt already waited long enough.\n\nThe reassurance was welcomed and the medicines helped her cope with the symptoms. It would still be another few of weeks before Jessica returned to feeling normal again.\n\nEven when under the weather, she still looked good in Lucerne.\n\nInterlaken- Now THIS Is Switzerland\n\nOur doorway to the grand Swiss Alps awaited in the town of Interlaken. From Lucerne, we traveled there by train in just a couple of hours. Interlake isn‚Äôt just the town‚Äôs name, it is also its description: Inter laken literally means between lakes. As you can see from the map, it certainly is.\n\nHere is a view from our train as we rode the rails into Interlaken.\n\nIn addition to having lakes east and west, Interlaken has mountains to its north and south. From one of the mountains closest to town, we repeatedly saw dozens of paragliders soaring overhead on their way for a landing site located smack-dab in the middle of town. It was a spectacle. Most of the flyers were tandems. But there were also several paragliding schools in town so some of the flyers could have been students.\n\nJessica and I walked through town wide-eyed in amazement. The sidewalks were humming with tourists from China to Australia. We wanted to believe Interlaken was tucked away in secret Swiss location (between two lakes and two mountains) and that only we had found it. This was not the case by a long shot. Interlaken was happening.\n\nHaving found ourselves caught up in the Swiss atmosphere, we stepped into a chocolate shop and purchased a small bag of dark chocolate with nuts for way too much money. Like a soothing day at the spa for the taste buds. So very, very luxurious.\n\nA Walk In The Alps\n\nInterlaken was at the entrance to the Alps. To climb deeper and higher into the mountains, we boarded an old-style train and rocked up the winding rails to a tiny outpost called Lauterbrunnen. From there we filled up a gondola car and rode the cable skyward to Gr√ºtschalp. At that point, we‚Äôd arrived into Swiss heaven. The joy before us now was to walk amid the beauty and feel like the luckiest people in the world.\n\nAs walks go, this one was a 10 out of 10. The trail meandered easily through a little bit of forest and bit more of pasture. The views were of mountains near and far, and of the expansive spaces of air and light between them. Will we remember this day once we return to the real world? We must. We must absorb everything about this moment as thoroughly as possible, so that we can return here, if only in our minds, for the rest of our lives.\n\nWe paused along the trail at a shaded bench for some trail mix and juicy bites of the best peaches we‚Äôd ever had. More walking brought us to the ski-resort town of M√ºrren. Ski season was over for the year, but it was easy to picture this place in full winter swing. A scenic overlook in the middle of town gave us a front row view of paragliders floating silently through the valley.\n\nReady again to snack, we bought a couple of bags of popcorn from M√ºrren‚Äôs local grocer. So tasty. Everything was good this day.\n\nFrom M√ºrren we continued on, following the signs to Gimmelwald where another gondola would swing us back down to the valley floor. In the meantime, there was no rush. We strolled by a stately Swiss cow and a handsome Swiss cat.\n\nJessica enjoying herself immensely.\n\nThis paraglider displays his Swiss pride.\n\nLook at this amazing photo Jessica took. I love it!\n\nOur view unto the valley as our gondola descended into the town of Schilthorn. The drop was steep and rapid.\n\nSo Good, Let‚Äôs Do Another\n\nThe following day, we decided to explore a different hiking route, still within the same general area as before. Again, we boarded a train from Interlaken, but this time followed the rail up and to the left towards the town of Grindlewald. The previous day we were hung from the cable in a gondola. Today‚Äôs ride would be pure cable cars up, up and away (‚Ä¶just like our old days at Astroworld).\n\nLeaving Grindlewald on a wire.\n\nWhat do the cows think of us?\n\nThe best way to get high!\n\nSomeone‚Äôs excited.\n\nIt was not one single long cable that we rode to the tippy-top. There were several intermediary stations all stitched together via some creative Swiss engineering. As we reached the end of one looping cable, our car would disconnect simultaneously causing the doors to pop open with a loud bang. We could then choose to exit or remain on board and swing across the sub-station until attaching to the next cable skyward.\n\nOur goal was the ear-popping top!\n\nOur walk down from snow-on-the-ground heights this second day of hiking was not nearly as awesome as the first. We walked mostly on the roads for the trails were more rugged and difficult to lay foot on comfortably. The steepness of the grade was hard on our muscles and tendons after a couple of steady hours descending. Well, I guess we did take a super break along the way. Here I am mid-chew on some french fries at a Swiss caf√©.\n\nWalking across snow is always exciting for a boy from Texas.\n\nAs we neared Grindlewald, small cabins such as this one became commonplace. What‚Äôs the story? Do people actually live here?\n\nWe had another extraordinary day in the Alps, but perhaps the bar had already been set so high from the previous day‚Äôs hike; that nothing else would truly compare.\n\nInterlaken will certainly make our top 10 best places to visit list. We loved it and would definitely like to return someday.\n\nHey Einstein, We‚Äôre In Your HOUSE!\n\nAfter Interlaken, we shifted back towards the north and paused for a few hours in Switzerland‚Äôs capital city of Bern. Certainly Bern deserved more than a few hours of our time, but it was all that we had. Another one of those great old cities of Europe, Bern is filled with history and intrigue.\n\nI am not deeply familiar with the life of Albert Einstein, but I did know that he spent a portion of his life in Bern. His small apartment is now a small museum.\n\nWe waltzed through his living room. Talk about a brush with greatness.\n\nIt was in Bern that the young Einstein worked as a clerk at the local patent office. His daily commute from work to home by electric streetcar rolled him down Kramgasse Street in direct line of sight with Bern‚Äôs famous Zytglogge Clock Tower. Day after day, Einstein passed that clock tower and pondered how it might look (i.e. how time might look) if he were traveling away from it at the speed of light. In part, at least, it was from this rumination that his Special Theory of Relatively began to take shape.\n\nThe view down Kramgasse street from Einstein‚Äôs apartment window. The clock tower is in the distance.\n\nWhat a thrill it was to walk down the very street that Einstein strolled and look up at that very same clock tower Einstein turned to time and time again.\n\nLike I said, we were not in Bern for more than a few hours, but it sure looked like a great city to us even in that short amount of time.\n\nI‚Äôve split our time in Switzerland into two posts. This first one brought you with us to Zurich, Lucerne, Interlaken and Berne, but there is more Switzerland ahead, three different locations, in fact, but all with one thing in common- friends. Traveling by ourselves has a different tenor and tone than when we have the comforting experience of meeting up with people we know. Read about that in the next post.\n\n(Langenthal, Heerbrugg, Geneva ‚Äì 14 June 2014) The high cost of Switzerland was kicking our butts. I didn‚Äôt really talk about it in the previous Switzerland post, but the cost of everything in Switzerland is next to insane. A small and simple sandwich will take the equivalent of 10 dollars from your pocket. Want a soda with your sandwich? Don‚Äôt do it, friend. That‚Äôll be another $5.\n\nFinding affordable places to stay in Switzerland was a challenge. We could generally expect to find the best nightly rates at hostels, but even those were well over $100/night. We applied all of our research skills and tricks to never pay quite that much for a night‚Äôs stay, but it was still wreaking havoc on our budget. We were in definite need of some relief.\n\nFortunately, we know people, really good people, that provided us with a generous stretch of free lodging. First, it was Beat (pronounced bay-ott), that we caught up with in an out of the way town called, Langenthal. Next, we reunited with the man, the myth, the legend, that has become, Boris, meeting him in his highly improbably new place of residence, Heerbrugg, Switzerland. Finally, we ventured to a more well-known Swiss locale- Geneva -and crashed with Hannah and Elliott, a couple of friends known to us from the Ultimate community back in Austin.\n\nFellow Traveler\n\nWe knew Beat only slightly before imposing ourselves on him quite heavily, though we had every sense that he was a truly kind and generous soul. He‚Äôs tall and thin, speaks English imperfectly with a soft Swiss-German accent, and delivers almost every line with a dollop of sly humor.\n\nOur first encounter with Beat was at one of the lodges in Torres del Paine, back in November of last year. He was just a random fellow traveler we struck up a conversation with at the last refugio we stayed in before leaving that beautiful National Park. One day later, we saw him a second time at a restaurant in Puerto Natales. That is the town closest to Torres del Paine and where nearly everyone pauses on their way to or from it. The town has many restaurants, but by queer chance the three of us ended up eating at the same one. It seemed extra coincidental, too, because we were the only three people in the whole restaurant.\n\nStill not done running into Beat, (not by a long shot, as it would turn out), we saw him a third time at the tiny regional airport that services the area. Through our three encounters, we learned that Beat was from Switzerland and just at the tail end of a vacation in South America. We told him our story of traveling the world and that we would be in Switzerland the coming spring. Unprompted, he volunteered his contact information to me and suggested we email him once we arrive to Switzerland.\n\nI clearly warned him that he should not give us his info casually‚Ä¶.because we will be contacting him. We are not shy for such things.\n\nFast Forward Eight Months\n\nA full eight months time had passed since Beat (foolishly?) gave us his email address. Imagine him opening his email and seeing, ‚ÄúHey Beat! Remember us? We are in Switzerland,‚Äù and photo of us was attached. Being the good guy that he is, he seemed genuinely excited to hear from us. There was, however, a slight complication. As we already knew, Beat loves to travel‚Ä¶.he was in Morocco on another vacation when we contacted him.\n\nFortunately for us his return to Switzerland was near and we would still have a chance to meet up.\n\nBeat lives in a small community called Langenthal, part of a cluster of townships far away from where any right-minded tourist would ever venture. Not to say there is nothing to see in Langenthal; to the contrary. All of Switzerland is beautiful and, almost by default, so is Langenthal. Don‚Äôt look for the tourist office here, however. There are no tourist highlights, per se. Langenthal is where ordinary people live and work and raise their kids. It‚Äôs Normal Rockwell‚Äôs America, done in Swiss colors.\n\nBeat picked us up from the Langenthal train station late on a Tuesday afternoon. It was great to see him and on his home turf, too. We dropped our things off at his flat, met his interesting cat, Layla, and then ventured out for drinks and dinner.\n\nLayla had just been to the salon. What a lion-heart!\n\nCheck out those totally 80‚Äôs furr-covered boots.\n\nOur visit with Beat was far too short. But, my guess is that we will see him again one day. He loves to travel and we think he can be convinced to visit Texas one day.\n\nThe lesson from our story of Beat is that the world is full of good-hearted people. While one cannot possibly meet them all, they are often within reach of meeting if one simply makes a small outward gesture to do so.\n\nBoris in Switzerland\n\nMembers of the Boris fan club have to stay on their toes. He‚Äôs in Antarctica. No, he‚Äôs in Italy. Wait, he‚Äôs in Perth, Australia. ‚ÄúThere he is. I see him! He‚Äôs in New Zealand!‚Äù Hang on, that‚Äôs all old news. Here‚Äôs the latest: Boris recently took on a new job IN SWITZERLAND! I know, right?! How did he pull that off? (He applied.)\n\nTo his friends, Boris is a smiley, fun-loving, happy-go-lucky man of adventure. His career path makes it clear he has a more serious side. He is smart, focused, and incredibly driven to learn and grow professionally. Within his field of orbital logistics, he is part of an exclusive club of highly trained engineers and scientists. On one of the job message boards used within his field, Boris spotted an open position with a Swiss company that manufactures GPS-enabled surveying equipment. After months of interviews and waiting, and second and third interviews and more waiting, Boris was hired.\n\nFor Jessica and me, the timing of Boris‚Äô relocation from Perth, Australia to (the miniature town of) Heerbrugg, Switzerland, could not have been much better. We had to wiggle our schedule around by a day or two, but just three days after Boris arrived to his new (temporary) flat in Heerbrugg, we were knocking on his door.\n\nSame ol‚Äô Boris. Such a ham!\n\nWe hung out with Boris at a fun little Mexican restaurant in Heerbrugg. Mexican food? Who knew?!\n\nOf course, Boris just had to show off his tiny-kitchen skills.\n\nAfter harassing Boris for a few days, we continued westward on our journey‚Ä¶to Geneva.\n\nGeneva and More Friends\n\nAs I mentioned right at the top of this post, Switzerland is crazy-expensive. To figure out ways to cut costs, I queried Uncle Google with phrases like, ‚ÄúSwitzerland on a budget‚Äù or ‚ÄúSwitzerland on a shoestring‚Äù. The first piece of advice is always, find a friend to stay with. In Geneva, Jessica and I were at it again.\n\nThis time it was two Ultimate-friends from Austin that had relocated to Switzerland in 2013. Hannah and Elliott were not particularly close friends of ours, however, within the Ultimate community there is a feeling of family that often surpasses what is found in many actual families; they welcomed us into their flat with generosity and enthusiasm.\n\nCrouching with Hannah and Elliott for the self-timer pic.\n\nEqually welcoming was Hannah and Elliott‚Äôs sweet dog, Roy. A rescue dog, Roy has a deeply expressive face that can melt a heart with just one glance. Just look at that face!!! Roy, we love you.\n\nGeneva vs. Ultimate\n\nFor anyone eager to hear about our intensive exploration of Geneva, I‚Äôve got some disappointing news. As it worked out, there was a three-day Ultimate tournament going on in Geneva while we were there. For an Ultimate player like myself, I was powerless to resist the call of the disc. I joined a team from Paris, France named Ah Ouh Puc (I never figured out what that meant) and played my heart out.\n\nJessica came with me to the fields on the first day of the tournament, but spent the other days re-charging herself in Hannah and Elliott‚Äôs apartment or taking their dog Roy out for walks in the neighborhood.\n\nWe did make it out for a pleasant stroll alongside Lake Geneva, but otherwise saw relatively little of Geneva‚Äôs top touristy sights. (And therefore have very few photos of it.) We didn‚Äôt take a city-tour or go on a bike ride, and we only visited one old church. Frankly, I was fine with it since I was playing Ultimate. Besides, Geneva didn‚Äôt strike me as vastly different from Zurich, Lucerne or Bern, three of the Swiss cities we‚Äôd already visited and enjoyed very much. There is, however, one very significant difference between Geneva and those others fine cities‚Ä¶.French!\n\nGeneva is located on the western edge of Switzerland (next to France). Consequently, French is the city‚Äôs primary language and dominates the city from a cultural perspective. It was in Geneva that we began to see baguettes rising from brown paper sacks and carried in the arms of every citizen strolling the sidewalks.\n\nDid you know there are actually 3 major languages spoken in Switzerland? Most of the Swiss population speaks the language known as Swiss-German. Italian is the primary language in the far south, and as I mentioned, it‚Äôs nothing but French in Geneva. I remember our one brief attempt to watch TV in Switzerland. So ridiculous! Having three dominate languages in the country means the 3X number of channels‚Ä¶.and none in English. Oh well.\n\nBlack Cats On Patrol\n\nBefore wrapping up this post I want to share with you one of the most curious observations of our entire trip. The first time the scene I will describe caught my attention, it was not actually clear what I was seeing. I was on the train going from Bern to Heerbrugg. As we approached one of several stops along the route, I witnessed my first black cat alone in the middle of a small field. Hmmm. What an odd place for a cat to plant himself. It looked like perhaps the cat was patrolling the field for critters.\n\nAn isolated incident? Nope. By the time our tour through Switzerland was over, I‚Äôd counted at least 10 different black cats in fields. Jessica saw them, too. She even tried to one-up me by spotting one cat that was half-white, half-black.\n\nOne of my cats-on-patrol sightings in particular made it crystal clear that what it looked like I was seeing was in fact, the reality. On a different day and a different train ride (still in Switzerland), I observed a somewhat larger field and three black cats in it, each guarding its own parcel of land.\n\nObviously, cats have been policing fields for eons (and in many more places than just Switzerland), I had just never witnessed the phenomenon live and in person. It was way cool and totally unexpected.\n\nSwitzerland is most definitely a country we would like to return to again. What would really be awesome is if I had more experience paragliding so I could fly through those huge canyons between the snowy and majestic mountains of the Swiss Alps. Maybe Boris will get his pilots certification, too, and we can soar the Alps together.\n\nDreams of flying aside, Switzerland is simply a remarkable country. Yes, it is super expensive, but at least one has the sense that you get what you pay for. If this isn‚Äôt a utopian society‚Ä¶..well, it sure is darn close."
