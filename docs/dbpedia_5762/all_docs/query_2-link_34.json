SCHIRMER New York htft\" +D he. \"bUken 0 4 ^OCHS OX £ fed i Copyright 1900, 1905, 1919, 1940, 1958 by G. SCHIRMER, INC. 38421 X124 (PRINTED IN U.S.A.) K\\,,r, PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION The present edition is virtually a new book, with most of the entries re- written, radically edited, and greatly expanded. Some 2,300 biographies have been added, including not only contemporary figures but also many neglected musicians of the past. A maximum emphasis has been laid on the abundance of factual data. In entries on composers, the titles of major compositions — operas, ballets, symphonic works — are given as completely as is practical, with exact dates of first perform- ances. In entries on musicologists, most of their published books in various languages, and some of their significant articles in the musical press, are listed. As to performers, their most signal accomplishments are brought out, with dates of their European and American debuts. A similar service is done for outstand- ing music teachers, with a list of their educational positions. The design of the present edition is a self-contained biographical dictionary of musicians. Bibliography is given in ample measure, but the reader is not directed to other reference works for essential information. I have received invaluable assistance from scholars and librarians in America and in Europe during the preparation of this edition, but the actual writing has been done by myself, and I must therefore accept full responsibility for the re- sulting product. A biographical dictionary ought to be a democratic assembly of factual in- formation. Great men of music are naturally given preponderance, but the \"little masters\" are also treated with consideration. Bibl, Kittl, Lickl, and Titl, and their ilk, are tendered lexicographical hospitality, if not lavish accommodations. Authorities have been consulted, but not trusted. In fact, many persistent errors find their origin in authoritative works of reference, compiled by illustrious lexicographers whose great reputations have for years discouraged independent scrutiny. Unfortunately, prime sources of musical biography, the memoirs of the subjects themselves, are rarely reliable. Berlioz embellished his life by romantic exaggeration, and often abused credulity. Wagner gave a fairly accurate account of his life, but he deliberately omitted episodes that are of legitimate interest, for instance the fact that he was incarcerated for debt in the Clichy jail in Paris from October 28 to November 17, 1840. These dates I have secured from the Palais de Justice, Paris. Reminiscences by members of the family and intimate friends of famous musicians must also be treated with circumspection. In some cases, the censoring of certain aspects of a musician's life is unavoidable. The standard biography PREFACE of Tchaikovsky by his brother Modest understandably leaves out the true reasons for the failure of his unfortunate marriage. Some biographical materials that have been widely circulated are plain forgeries. Such are the notorious Chopin-Potocka correspondence (in which Chopin appears as a gay Lothario) and the unspeakable edition of Memoir es d'une chanteuse allemande, ascribed — most foully — to the famous singer Wil- helmine Schroder-Devrient; it still figures in most bibliographies as a source book instead of the pornographic fabrication that it is. Many cherished legends of musical biography have been removed by recent investigations, and I have tried to keep up with the corrective discoveries. Sweelinck never went to Venice. Corelli never went to Paris as Lully's rival. Stravinsky's Pulcinella contains virtually no themes by Pergolesi (though they are attributed to Pergolesi in Stravinsky's sources). Friedrich Witt wrote the \"Jena\" symphony, not Beethoven. PurcelPs trumpet voluntary was composed by Jeremiah Clarke. Wagner did not invent the term \"Leitmotif;\" neither did Hans von Wolzogen; it was originated by Friedrich Wilhelm Jahns, in the preface to his book on Weber, published in 1871. And, of course, Bizet never composed the famous Habanera from Carmen; he transplanted it from a collection of Spanish songs by Sebastian Yradier. The commonly accepted story of Haydn's Farewell Symphony tells us that Haydn staged his musical act in order to induce Prince Esterhazy to grant his orchestra a vacation. But a much more plausible explanation is contained in a little-known book by an Italian friend of Haydn, Giacomo Gotifredo Ferrari, published at London in 1830. According to Ferrari's version, Esterhazy in- tended to disband the orchestra and Haydn's Farewell Symphony was a strata- gem to move the patron's heart, and to save the orchestra. Obviously, it succeeded. It is usually stated that 20,000 persons attended Beethoven's funeral, and the figure is supported by contemporary accounts. But the population of Vienna at the time of Beethoven's death was about 320,000, and it is hardly likely that one person out of every sixteen, including children, gathered to pay tribute to the dead master. I have therefore replaced 20,000 by the non-committal \"hundreds.\" On the other hand, the famous account of Beethoven's dying during a violent storm has been triumphantly confirmed. I have obtained from the Vienna Bureau of Meteorology an official extract from the weather report for March 26, 1827, stating that a thunderstorm, accompanied by strong winds, raged over the city at 4:00 in the afternoon. A certain element of informed guesswork is inevitable in any biography, and is justified as long as it is clearly presented as conjecture. Jean Marie Leclair, the 18th-century French violinist, was murdered in his own house PREFACE (by stabbing) ; his estranged wife was a professional engraver who owned sharp tools; there was no sign of a struggle at the scene of the assassination; ergo . . . The pursuit of accurate information has been long and arduous. To begin at the beginning, i.e., at birth: musicians, through the centuries, have altered their birth dates, invariably in the direction of rejuvenation. The chronicle of falsification begins with Johann Jakob Froberger, who gave his date of birth to his physician, Nicolaus Binninger, as May 18, 1620. When his baptism certifi- cate was discovered, it revealed that he was baptized on May 19, 1616. A plausible surmise is that he gave the correct day and month, falsifying only the year; it is therefore fairly certain that the day of his birth was May 18, and that he was baptized on the following day. In his handwritten autobiographical notice for Mattheson's Grundlage einer Ehrenpforte, Telemann stated that he was born in 1682, whereas he was actually born a year earlier; again, the day and the month of his birth, March 14, were given correctly. I have obtained hundreds of birth certificates from all over the world to establish correct dates. The differences between the professed and actual ages have ranged from one to nineteen years. A few exceptions should be noted. Mozart's librettist, Emanuel Schikaneder, gave his birth year as 1748, but he was actually born in 1751. It is said that he married a woman some years his senior and wished to bring their ages closer together. Ethel Leginska, pianist and conductor, wrote me to correct her date of birth from 1883 to 1886. Her birth certificate confirmed the latter date. The famous Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos apparently did not know when he was born, for when I told him during a meeting in Paris that he was born in 1887, and not in 1881, 1890, or some other year, as variously given in reference works, he seemed genuinely surprised. I obtained the 1887 date from the registries of the school he attended as a child in Rio de Janeiro. Since then, his birth certificate has been discovered, confirming this date. In some cases it is possible to arrive at a complete birth date synthetically. It is known, for instance, that Jacob Obrecht was born on Saint Cecilia's day, November 22, and that he entered the University of Lou vain on August 17, 1470. The normal age of entrants being between 17 and 18, the year of Obrecht's birth can be deduced as 1452, thus providing the full date of birth, November 22, 1452. But a similar attempt to establish the birth date of the famous Belgian theorist Johannes Tinctoris from the presence of a person of that name among the entrants at the University of Louvain in 1471, fails be- cause of false identification: Tinctoris was definitely known to be a native of PREFACE Brabant, whereas his Louvain namesake was from Flanders; also, the real Tinctoris was already a figure in scholarly circles at the time his namesake entered the University. Vivaldi's year of birth seems to be hidden forever from the inquiring eye; only an approximate date between 1675 and 1678 is offered in his biographies. But in an article published in 'Nueva Antologia' of August 1, 1942, Fausto Torrefranca makes this tantalizingly cryptic statement: \"Se e vera la data che ho ripescato in un vecchio repertorio del quale nessuno si e servito, Vivaldi sarebbe nato nel 1669, I'll giugno.\" Nessuno? I have decided to accept this date, even without palpable certification, in the hope that further findings will confirm it, for exact dates are rarely fabricated whole, and the year 1669 is quite compatible with the precisely known dates of Vivaldi's tonsure and ordi- nation to the priesthood. Cases of mistaken identity complicate the search for birth certificates. The bicentennial of Giovanni Battista Viotti was widely celebrated in 1953, but as it turned out, the celebration honored Viotti' s infant brother. A Giovanni Battista Viotti was indeed born in Fontanetto, Italy, on May 23, 1753, but he died on July 10, 1754. On May 12, 1755, another child was born to the Viottis, and in memory of their first-born, he was given the same Christian names (a common practice in Catholic families) plus two additional names, Guglielmo Domenico. This was Giovanni Battista Viotti, the composer. Biographical notices for Giacomo Insanguine list his year of birth variously between 1712 and 1742. I applied for a copy of his birth certificate at the registries in his native town of Monopoli, and received a document stating that Giacomo Insanguine was born there in 1712. However, this date did not fit into the known chronology of his education and career. I pressed further; the registries were searched again, and a death certificate was found showing that a Giacomo Insanguine died in 1726 at the age of 14. On March 22, 1728, a boy was born to the bereaved parents, and was named Giacomo Antonio Francesco Paolo Michele. This was the composer Insanguine. The Italian composer and conductor Angelo Mariani, who was born on October 11, 1821, insisted in his communications to Francesco Regli, editor of a biographical dictionary, that he was born on October 11, 1824, and that he had an elder brother of the same name born exactly three years earlier, which led to mistaken identification. Mariani's birth certificate proves, however, that he was born in 1821. A famous case of claimed mistaken identity is that of Beethoven, who was eager to prove that he was born in 1772 rather than 1770, and that it was another Ludwig van Beethoven who was born at an earlier date. True, a Ludwig PREFACE Maria van Beethoven was born on April 1, 1769, but he died a few days later. Beethoven was born in the following year. The true date of birth of Caruso will never be known with certainty; upon inquiry, I have received from the Demographic Office in Naples 13 birth cer- tificates for 13 Enrico Carusos, all born about the time that Caruso was born, but none matching the known names of his parents. The chances are that the birth of Caruso, who was one of 18 children, was never registered. Discrepancies of a few days in dates of birth are very common, owing to the substitution of the date of baptism for that of birth. Oddly enough, such errors occur even when the actual date of birth is included specifically in the baptism certificate. For over three centuries the date of birth of Lully was readily ascertainable, since his registry of baptism, indicating his birth on the day before, was preserved in the state archives in Florence. Yet it is the date of Lully' s baptism, and not that of his birth, that is given in most reference works. Unless a prior claim is made, I was the first to obtain the text of the baptism certificate of Lully, and to establish his correct birth date, November 28, 1632. It has been repeatedly stated in various writings on Mahler that he was not sure of his exact date of birth, and that his birth certificate was lost. Yet a simple request addressed to the archivist of the municipality of Kalischt, where Mahler was born, brought me a copy of his birth certificate confirming the generally accepted date, July 7, 1860. His centennial will thus be celebrated with the perfect assurance that the date is right. Several reference works state that the birth of Sigismond Thalberg was never registered, and that a search in the archives of Geneva, where he was born, proved unavailing. Yet I have obtained the supposedly lost birth certificate without any difficulty, establishing his birth date as January 8, 1812. Inquiring still further, I learned to my disappointment that I was not the first to discover the supposedly lost document; its text was published in a musical magazine early in the 20th century, with the purpose of refuting the claim of loss. But there was more to the Thalberg case than the mere matter of his birth date. He openly asserted that he was the natural son of Count Moritz Dietrichstein and Baroness von Wetzlar. Yet the birth certificate states unambiguously that his parents were Joseph Thalberg and Fortunee Stein, both of Frankfurt. The certificate also indicates that both parents were married, but it does not state clearly whether they were married to each other. At this point, my investiga- tion had to stop. There is a fair percentage of illegitimate births among musicians. One famous Italian singer, Lucrezia Agujari, was known as La Bastardella; unless the name under which she was registered at birth is ascertained, there is no hope of obtaining her birth certificate. Delicacy compels me not to mark the PREFACE established illegitimacy of musicians of more recent date. When birth certificates cannot be secured, the next best sources of informa- tion are registries of birth in family Bibles, marriage certificates, school reports, and the like. The date of birth of Kaspar Othmayr, March 12, 1515, is verified by his astrological chart, and one may be sure that he gave the right date to his astrologer. Death dates are often listed a day late, owing to the delay in announcement, or to a difference in time zones. Arnold Schoenberg's death is given as July 14, 1951 in most European sources, whereas he died on July 13, in Los Angeles. The date is particularly significant since Schoenberg (who was born on the 13th of the month) held a superstitious belief that 13 was his unlucky number. He was genuinely perturbed when he was told by a friend that the sum of the digits of his age (76) during the last year of his life was 13. According to an intimate account, he died 13 minutes before midnight, Los Angeles time, which of course was early morning July 14, in the Eastern states and in Europe. Conversely, European deaths are occasionally reported in America as having occurred on the preceding date according to local American time. For some reason, the date of Prokofiev's death was generally reported in the West as having taken place on March 4, 1953, although he died on March 5, 1953, at 6:00 in the afternoon, Moscow time, which was also March 5 in Western Europe and America. Melba died in Sydney in the early morning, on February 23, 1931, Australian time, but her death was announced in New York papers that were on the streets on February 22. This was, of course, due to the day's advance of Australian time over American time. A number of musicians, including celebrities, have disappeared without leaving a trace. It was only in the 20th century that Vivaldi's place of death was finally traced to Vienna. Bononcini, the rival of Handel, also went to Vienna to die, but this was not discovered until very recently. I believe that the present edition is the first musical dictionary to contain this information and the exact date of Bononcini's death. In order to ascertain the fate of musicians who were lost during the cataclysm of World War II and the European revolutions preceding and following it, I resorted to advertising in the German press and in the Russian emigre newspapers. I received a number of replies from relatives and friends of the subjects, and was able to establish the death dates of several former luminaries on the musical scene, among them Count Sheremetiev, a musical Maecenas in old St. Petersburg, who died in a poorhouse near Paris, and the PREFACE once famous German tenor Paul Kalisch, husband of Lilli Lehmann, who died at the age of 90 in an Austrian castle. Then there were the deaths in German concentration camps, and in air raids. Several well-known musicians could not be accounted for, and probably never will be. One of the most fantastic episodes in my hunt for missing persons was the search for Heinrich Hammer, conductor and composer, born in Germany in 1862, and active in Washington, D. C., about the turn of the century. He was last reported in Pasadena in the 1920's, but inquiries there failed to provide any information. I appealed for help to my favorite librarian at the Music Division of the Library of Congress, and he, always a man of instantaneous action, placed transcontinental telephone calls (at his own expense!) to various contacts in Pasadena, until he reached Hammer's son. This gentleman, an em- ployee of the telephone company, happened to be working atop a telephone pole at the time, but a connection was established on the road line. The climax of the story was spectacular: a clipping from the Los Angeles 'Times' of October 25, 1953, was produced, carrying on its society page a picture of Heinrich Hammer, 91, and his young bride Arlene, 22, whom he had married the year before. Their address was given in the story, but when I wrote to him for further information on his musical activities, the letter came back marked: \"Deceased: address unknown.\" It was relatively easy to find out that he had moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where he died on October 28, 1954. Some technical aspects of the present edition are enumerated hereunder : Inclusion and Exclusion. Although this is technically a dictionary of musicians, many other individuals connected with music are included, so that the proper title of the book ought to be Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Librettists, Publishers, Impresarios, and Sundry Other Men, Women, and Children Who Have to Do with Music. Diaghilev was not a professional musician, but his influence on the course of 20th-century composition was so powerful that his name cannot be left out. The same consideration applies to patrons of music, some of whom could not read notes, but who have promoted music by generous donations. Whenever there was a question about inclusion or exclusion, the benefit of the doubt was given to the candidate. Proportionate Representation. Theoretically, in a book of reference, the amount of space should be proportionate to the importance of the subject. But this is not practical. Biographical information is very scant on important musi- cians of the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and it would be pointless to try to fill the space by unwarranted speculation in lieu of factual material. A prolific composer of ephemeral works may command more space than his less prolific PREFACE reorchestrated it, and had it performed under the title La bonne chanson. As a result, the work twinned in several dictionaries. First and Last Names. Variants of spellings of celebrated musical names (Des Prez, Despres, etc.) are indicated in parentheses, and the selection of the main entry is made according to the weight of scholarly opinion, frequency of usage, etc. In this edition Piccinni is preferred to Piccini, Janequin to Jannequin. Alternative spellings are indicated by cross reference. One of the most vexing problems has been the decision to modernize the German name Carl to Karl. The tendency towards modernization has been strong in the last decades, and has found its reflection in the successive editions of the present dictionary. A special problem is presented by the changes of spelling effected by emigrant musicians themselves. Arnold Schonberg changed his name legally to Schoenberg when he became an American citizen. Carlos Salzedo dropped the acute accent that originally marked the antepenultimate letter of his last name. Carlos Sur- inach dropped the tilde over the n. Other composers changed the form of their names in order to insure correct pronunciation in the adoptive country. Pre- ferred listing must be decided according to the number and relative importance of works published under the old name or the new. Thus, the original name of Aladar Szendrei has been retained, even though he changed it in America to Alfred Sendrey. Edgar Varese began using the form Edgard about 1942, but all his works are published without the terminal d in the first name. The French music scholar Lionel de La Laurencie used the capital letter in La in the bibliographical sections of his books, but small 1 in the footnotes in the same books. The listing under La Laurencie is preferred here to conform to library catalogues. Another scholarly Frenchman, Gedalge, did not use the acute accent in most of his signed prefaces, but the accent is present in many title pages of his publications. The accentless form appears to be more authentic. Nobiliary Particles. When a nobiliary particle (de, van, von) is intimately associated with the customary form of a name, then the corresponding entry is given under such a particle. Alternatives are given for reference. Victoria De Los Angeles is listed under De Los Angeles, with references under Angeles and Los. Although Beethoven took pride in the supposed nobility represented by the particle van, it would be preposterous to have such a listing under the letter V, even for reference purposes. The numerous other vans are distributed either under V or under the main body of the name. Usage, rather than consistency, is accepted as a guide. The English composer Gustav Hoist was of remote Swedish ancestry, and his original name was Von Hoist. At the outbreak of World War I, he followed the suggestion of Percy A. Scholes and dropped the Germanic-sounding particle. There seems to be no point in giving a cross reference under Von Hoist. PREFACE Pseudonyms. Real names of composers or writers on music better known by their pseudonyms are given in parentheses. In some cases the choice has been difficult. In the last edition of this dictionary, the main entry on Edmund Rubbra was under Duncan-Rubbra, the name under which he published some of his early works. Duncan was the name of his first wife, which he adopted, but his subsequent works were all performed and published under his real name and there seems to be no reason for perpetuating the Duncan-Rubbra form. The primary entry for the Russian composer and musicologist Boris Asafiev is placed under that name, with a cross reference under his pseudonym Igor Glebov. Philip Heseltine published most of his music under the name Peter Warlock, but Heseltine is preferred for the main entry. Transliteration from the Russian. Adequate transliteration of Russian names into the Latin alphabet is as impossible as squaring a circle. Russians who have made their careers abroad have adopted their own transliterations, which have become familiar, and which resist the logic of phonetics. There is no reason for the compulsion to do violence to such well-established forms as Rachmaninoff or Koussevitzky. On the other hand, there is no reason to follow the German spellings Strawinsky and Tschaikowsky. Since Stravinsky has be- come an American citizen, the spelling of his name in the Latin alphabet has become established. As to Tchaikovsky, his name can be rendered with phonetic fidelity in English as Chikovsky (chi as in China), but so drastic a departure from the familiar appearance of a famous name can only lead to confusion. The Encyclopedia Britannica compromises on the half-German, half-English form Tschaikovsky. The s in Russian names is often doubled to avoid being vocalized into z. There is only one s in the Russian spelling of Mussorgsky, but the deletion of the supernumerary s would run counter to established usage. On the other hand, Russian names that have not established themselves in a unique form have been transliterated letter by letter, as Asafiev and Stasov. The first name and patronymic are given in the entries on most Russian musicians who have made their careers in Russia, but not for emigrants. Russian forms of the first name are used in conjunction with the patronymic — Sergey Sergeyevitch Prokofiev, Nikolai Yakovlevitch Miaskovsky. For Russian-born musicians active abroad, first names usually are assimilated with the correspond- ing names in the language of the country of residence. But there are inevitable exceptions. My own name Nicolas is an anomaly in this respect, being the French form of the Russian Nikolai; there should be every reason for me to anglicize it into Nicholas, but since I began publishing my compositions and my books under an aitchless first name, I might as well keep it so. Geographical Names. Changes of place names are annoying to lexicogra- PREFACE phers and mapmakers alike. If the metamorphosis of St. Petersburg to Petrograd and then to Leningrad leaves no doubt in the minds of informed readers that all three represent the same city on the banks of the Neva, elsewhere on the European map the befuddlement is considerable. One can travel from Pressburg to Bratis- lava to Pozsony without budging an inch. A person born in Klausenburg finds himself nominally transported to Kolozsvar and then to Cluj, while living in the same house all his life. Sometimes a town resumes its former name. Perm was renamed Molotov after the Soviet Revolution, but when Molotov fell into disgrace in 1957, the name Perm was restored. In Poland, Katowice was renamed Stalinogorod in 1953, but resumed its old name in 1956. Then there is the case of Liege. For over a century, it bore an unnatural acute accent on the middle letter. In 1946 the Municipal Council resolved that the accent be changed. Should we cling pedantically to the chronology of Liege's orthography, we would find a Belgian musician born in a place with an acute accent, and dying there with a grave. Abbreviations. All abbreviations have been removed from this edition, except those in common usage, e.g., vol., ed., prof., Jan., Feb., Aug., etc.; and also the obvious ones, such as symph., orch., publ., etc. No more the impene- trable consonant jungle of Ztschr., Vschr., vcs., Kchm., mvt., or Kgl. Apparent Errors. Among tens of thousands of names, titles, and dates errors seem inevitable. Yet some apparent errors are not errors at all. The words of Die Forelle of Schubert are by Schubart; Roselius edited works by Raselius; H. Reimann is not a misprint for H. Riemann. Two Czech-born conductors, both named Adler but unrelated, are stated in the present edition to have been respectively in charge of the Kiev State Opera and of the Kiev State Orchestra during the same period in the 1930's. This looks like flagrant confusion of identities, but it is not. How many real errors, typographical or otherwise, have escaped notice? I can only hope that the percentage is low. My heart overflows with gratitude to many wonderful people who have helped me in putting together this edition, and have saved me from blunders that I might otherwise have committed, to my everlasting horror and shame. There are first of all the anonymous (for their names are illegible on various documents received by me) registrars, clerks, and keepers of archives, thanks to whom I have been able to establish correct dates of birth and death, first performances of important works, and other details. Among music scholars who have been of assistance, I should mention Karl H. Worner in Germany, Victor De Rubertis in Argentina, Vasco Mariz in Brazil, Klaus Pringsheim in Japan, PREFACE Josip Andreis in Yugoslavia, the Society of Polish Composers in Warsaw, Pierre Debievre in Paris, and Ulisse Prota-Giurleo in Naples. I owe especial gratitude to Mme. W.-L. Landowski of Paris, who provided accurate and important in- formation on French music, not accessible by ordinary means. Theodore d'Er- langer, of Paris, secured for me some valuable documentation. Nathan Broder, Associate Editor of The Musical Quarterly, has assumed the overwhelming task of going over the entire manuscript, questioning every suspicious item, scrutinizing factual discrepancies, providing missing information, and also rewriting some entries. He has kept his vigil faithfully, from Aaron to Zwyssig. I have reserved for the end my testimonial for William Lichtenwanger, Assistant Reference Librarian in the Music Division of the Library of Congress, a man of fierce determination, who gets his historical, biographical, or biblio- graphical quarry in the face of the most disheartening failures by others. Because he treats no subject as trivial, and no musician as unworthy of the most tender bibliographical attention, he has been able to furnish unique and precious data (working on his own time, too!). His familiarity with a dozen or so languages (including Turkish and Japanese) has increased enormously the scope of his inquiry. As for myself, I should like to quote from a letter that Alfred Einstein wrote me shortly before his death, wondering \". . . ob wir — und natiirlich vor allem Sie — im Himmel einmal dafiir belohnt werden, dass wir einige Unge- nauigkeiten aus der Welt geschafft haben . . .\" To which I would add my favorite Latin phrase, so conveniently self-exonerating: Feci quod potui — faciant meliora potentes. Nicolas Slonimsky GUIDE FOR PRONUNCIATION Pronunciation of names is indicated in phonetic values of sounds in the English language. Names of European musicians of nations using the Latin alphabet are left without alteration, including diacritical marks over and under vowels and consonants in Czech, Polish, and Croatian. Russian names (originally written in the Cyrillic alphabet) are transliterated according to sound, accepted usage, or both. When a Russian-born musician has spelled his name consistently in a French form (as Oulibisheff, Koussevitzky, Cui), or a German (Rach- maninoff), such forms are given preference. The stress is indicated by an apos- trophe placed after the accented syllable: rah-mah'-ne-nohf. Pronunciation is not given for names familiar to every cultured person: Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann. However, when mispronunciation frequently occurs (e.g., Paderoosky for Paderefsky in the Polish name of Paderewski), correct sounds are indicated.

Abt wrote over 600 works, comprising more than 3,000 num- bers; the largest are the 7 secular cantatas. His popularity as a song writer is due chiefly to the flowing, easy and elegant style of his vocal melodies, some of which (Wenn die Schwalben heimwarts zieh'n, Gute Nacht, du mein herziges Kind, So viele Tausend Blumen, etc.) have become so well known as to be mistaken for genuine folksongs.

Adam (ah-dahn), Adolphe-Charles, cele- brated French opera composer; b. Paris, July 24, 1803; d. there, May 3, 1856. He entered the Paris Cons, in 1817 and studied with Boieldieu, whose influence was a de- termining factor in his career. His first opera was Pierre et Catherine (Opera-Comique, Feb. 9, 1829). The one-act comic opera, Le Chalet (Opera-Comique, Sept. 25, 1834), marked his first success (1400 performances of this opera were given before 1899). With the production of Le Postilion de Long- jumeau (Opera-Comique, Oct. 13, 1836) Adam achieved international fame. Of his other operas (he wrote 53 in all), the fol- lowing, all produced at the Opera-Comique, are the most important: Le Fidele Berger (Jan. 6, 1838); Le Brasseur de Preston (Oct. 31, 1838) ; Regine, ou Les Deux Nuits (Jan. 17, 1839) ; La Reine d'un jour (Sept. 19, 1839); Le Roi d'Yvetot (Oct. 13, 1842); Cagliostro (Feb. 10, 1844); Le Toreador, ou U Accord parfait (May 18, 1849); Giralda, ou La Nouvelle Psyche (July 20, 1850); Le Farfadet (March 19, 1852) ; Le Sourd, ou L'Auberge pleine (Feb. 2, 1853).

Adam was also a very successful ballet composer; his Giselle, produced at the Paris Opera (June 28, 1841) became one of the most celebrated and enduring choreographic scores.

His friend and patron, Rhaw of Wittenberg, published most of Agricola's works, the mag- num opus being Musica instrumentalis deudsch (i.e., 'set in German'; 1st ed., Wit- tenberg, 1529; 4th ed., considerably revised, 1545; modern reprint, Leipzig, 1896). This work, although derived from Virdung's Musi- ca getutscht, contains much new material and is set in couplet verse in the German vernac- ular. Further works are: Ein kurtz deudsche Musica (1529; 3d ed. as Musica choralis deudsch, 1533); Musica figuralis, with a supplement Von den proportionibus (1532); Scholia in musicam planam Venceslai Philo- matis (1538); Rudimenta musices (1539); Quaestiones vulgatiores in musicam (1543); Duo libri musices (posthumous; Wittenberg, 1561; includes reprints of Musica choralis and Musica figuralis; and 54 Instrumentische Gesdnge as a supplement). Compositions: Ein Sangbuchlein aller Sonntags-Evangelien (1541); Neue deutsche geistliche Gesdnge (1544) ; Hymni aliquot sacri (1552) ; Melo- diae scholasticae (1557). — Cf.

A be- liever in musical progress, he contributed several original ideas to the theory of modern music, notably in his article L'armonia modernissima ('Rivista Musicale,' 1911), and originated the term 'dodecafonia.'

His opera La voix humaine had the curious distinction of being staged at the Paris Opera (Dec. 30, 1861) with the sole purpose of making use of the scenery left over after the fiasco of Tannhauser (the ac- 14 ALBANESE — ALBENIZ tion of Alary's opera takes place in Wart- burg, as in Tannhauser).
