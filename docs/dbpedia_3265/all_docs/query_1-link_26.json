        "text": "It’s wonderful to see the strong pull Chicago holds over directors, it’s particularity great to watch directors that lived in Chicago return to film. Christopher Nolan has used Chicago as backdrops for several of his films. This past weekend, while Jeff Garlin chose Chicago to be the city to open his new film Dealin with Idiots, in the loop The Wachowskis were filming Jupiter Ascending.\n\nThe.Wachowskis grew up in Chicago before Andy went off to Emerson College in Boston, and Lana went to Bard College in New York.\n\nJupiter ascending is about a poor Russian immigrant who pays her bills by cleaning toilets. I have obviously not yet seen the film, but Wikipedia outlines the plot as\n\n“She encounters Caine, an interplanetary warrior whom the Queen of the Universe sent to kill Jupiter. Caine tells Jupiter that the stars were pointing to an extraordinary event on the night she was born, and that her DNA could mark her as the universe’s next leader”\n\nThe film stars Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean\n\nThat’s a whole lot of light."
