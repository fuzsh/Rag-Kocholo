        "text": "It’s no secret that when the Wachowskis’ operatic space epic Jupiter Ascending was released to theatres in the summer of 2015 it was lambasted by critics for it’s bloated plot, clunky dialogue, and questionable performances. In his review for NPR, critic Andrew Lapin writes that the film “is a universe away from The Matrix, still the last time a Wachowski effort fired on all cylinders. Jupiter has ascended somewhere else: to the canon of unintentional sci-fi silliness.” This thought is also echoed in Rolling Stone’s review of the film written by Peter Travers, who states that in “an effort to win back audiences by lowering their standards and their daring, the Wachowskis wind up where you never expected to find them creatively: on the ropes.”\n\nIt was these types of reviews that shaped my view of the film in the lead up to me finally watching it five years after its initial release. I expected a colossal failure on the level of David Lynch’s Dune or Colin Trevorrow’s The Book of Henry. What I was instead treated to was a beautiful (if slightly flawed) work of high camp, with stunning visuals and truly anti-capitalist theming.\n\nIn brief for those who have yet to see it, the plot of the film follows Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), an undocumented Russian immigrant who now works as a maid in Chicago. Her life is turned on it’s head at the arrival of Caine (Channing Tatum), a half-dog and half-human hybrid. Jupiter learns that human beings have existed for billions of years across the galaxy, Earth being merely one of their many habitats. Humans on certain colonies are created and exist oblivious to the rest of the universe, and are eventually “harvested” in order to create an elixir which brings eternal life to the elite. Jupiter also comes to find out that she is an exact genetic match for the slain matriarch of the Abraxas family, a dynasty of rulers who produce this life giving elixir, thus giving her control over everything the family owns. The queen’s three children, Titus (Douglas Booth), Kalique (Tuppence Middleton), and Balem (Eddie Redmayne), are all squabbling over control of Earth, one of the prized colonies for harvesting (although noted to be pretty insignificant to their unimaginable wealth). As such, the plot involves Jupiter meeting each of these children as they try to wrestle her away from each other for their own personal gain, with no regard for the billions of lives that hang in the balance.\n\nMany critics took umbrage with Jupiter’s characterization, stating that she was purely an audience surrogate who gets saved by Caine in almost every scene. Joe Neumaier of The Daily News writes “Kunis, whose perma-scowl is out of synch with her character’s sense of awe, is never given much to do” and Soren Andersen of the Seattle Times calling her “one of the most passive heroines the movies have ever seen, Jupiter requires saving again and again and again, screaming all the while.” And while that is true for a lot of the scenes in this film, ultimately Jupiter’s story is one of finding agency and identity under the crushing weight of a system that cares very little for those it exploits.\n\nThroughout the film, Jupiter constantly expresses the desire to go home and be done with the entire charade, while her both captors and “protectors” constantly ferry her around to different exotic locales without ever once paying heed to Jupiter’s own wants. It is not until she finally gets home that she realizes that she is merely a participant in something much larger than herself. Her family has been kidnapped by Balem and are being held hostage in exchange for Jupiter abdicating the throne. While Caine and the rest of the organization protecting her advise Jupiter not to follow Balem, she instead agrees to go, going against her advisors in the first sign of her finally gaining her independence.\n\nThis is fully cemented in the next scene where, after a long conversation with Balem, Jupiter realizes that her inheritance of Earth takes Balem’s ownership of the planet away. As such, he is no longer able to harvest the population of Earth for production of the live extending elixir. Jupiter refuses to abdicate the throne, in essence sacrificing her own life for the protection of the greater population. The personal becomes political for her, in seeing what could happen to the entire population of earth through the lens of her own family, she makes the hard decision to sacrifice everything for the greater good. In doing so, Jupiter gains the agency to fight against this family, and by extension the capitalist structures they represent, that has been deprived from her the entire film. In ignoring the arc that the character goes through, and very specifically ignoring Jupiter’s final scenes in the film, critics end up writing the character off as nothing more than a pawn in her own story, much in the same way that the antagonists of the film think of her.\n\nAnother point of contention for many critics was Eddie Redmayne’s performance as Balem, with most stating that he chews the scenery almost every time he’s on screen. Christopher Orr of The Atlantic writes “Redmayne must hope that no one casting an Oscar ballot catches his performance here, which consists of one long, wheezing whisper punctuated by occasional, Pacino-esque barks.” I disagree with many of these critics, instead feeling that his performance fits both the tone of the film and his character incredibly well. This film is a space opera, a film very indebted to vintage pulp science fiction novels with dazzling covers, grand adventures, and underlying (if not very subtle) themes meant to use the fantastical environments to make comments on the world we live in.\n\nI tend to not enjoy Redmayne in other films, but his unhinged performance here works as a truly evil man willing to do anything just to accumulate more. More power, more time, more capital, and more things he can chew up and spit out for his own amusement. His costume restricts his neck movement, making him look down at every character in the film, further cementing his intense superiority complex not just in actions and dialogue, but visuals as well. Criticism of these choices is rooted in a very narrow view of acting, and the belief that all performances must be exactly cohesive with one another. Redmayne’s performance effectively alienates him from much of the cast, and in so doing it makes him cartoonish. This works as a critique of capitalist business owners, being so evil in their actions and yet so silly in their extravagance and excess. By playing the character as campy and large as he does, he becomes the perfect antagonist for a story that literally involves the rich stealing life from the poor.\n\nPoorly written dialogue was a major sticking point for many critics, with one particular exchange being cited as a shining example. Halfway through the film, Caine and Jupiter discuss what it means for Jupiter to become the queen, as well as discussing their feelings toward each other. Caine states, “You are royalty now. I’m a splice, you don’t understand what that means but… I have more in common with a dog than I have with you.” To which Jupiter replies, “I love dogs, I’ve always loved dogs.” These lines were specifically pointed out in multiple reviews to criticize “the most risible dialogue in recent memory” as Peter Howell of the Toronto Star puts it. However, these lines can be seen as a microcosm of the themes the film is trying to present, as well as the characters’ views of each other.\n\nWhen Caine states that he has more in common with a dog than he does with Jupiter, it is not only in reference to his genome splicing but also the master and servant dynamic of a dog and their owner. Caine is merely a hired goon, always serving those who will pay him to do their dirty work, never making his own decisions. Jupiter is royalty, the one who makes the decisions, the one who owns the dog. As such, Caine and Jupiter are from two completely different classes and would never be compatible. Jupiter, on the other hand, believes the two to be equals, stating that she loves dogs to defuse the situation. She shows Caine that rather than being master and servant, they can work together. In essence, she respects and loves him in spite of the class divide. These lines can be read to represent the core thesis of the film: in order to make meaningful change, you must start with rejecting the capitalist and exploitative notions and hierarchies of the past. Doing so is the only way to create a just society, rather than simply making an unethical system a little more bearable. By reading these lines in a fully literal sense, critics do a disservice to the way the lines can actually be interpreted, and rob them of all of their metaphorical meaning.\n\nJupiter Ascending is not necessarily a perfect film. It has some pacing issues, the dumps of exposition can be quite clunky, and the central love story feels a little too underdeveloped to be all that compelling. That being said, the many critics deriding the film have a certain responsibility to see what the film is actually trying to say rather than immediately writing it off. Many of these critics will point to certain “objective” measures of quality (Redmayne’s performance, the multiple minor plot holes in the film) and just trash it there, unwilling to dig deeper into how these things play into the wider picture that the film is trying to convey. In trying to check off objective boxes, it blinds critics to how these aspects of the film play into the thematic ideas, and shows the critics as more consumer advisors than actual art critics. “Plot holes” don’t necessarily matter if they are in service of getting the larger point across, different acting styles can be used to provide further insight into characters, and a character’s former feebleness can make it all the more cathartic when they are able to finally find themselves. Are we as critics only looking for films that are shot passably, have some clever dialogue, and are ultimately saying nothing? Or should we as critics be giving credence to the films that swing big, are trying to send us a message, and are truly original? Do we want cinema to be seen as art, or as commerce?"
