        "text": "The creators of \"Jupiter Ascending\" spent $175 million on special effects and 25 cents on a story. Audiences do not get their money's worth. Here's what they do get:\n\n1. Channing Tatum as a half-dog, half-Silver Surfer with Spock's pointy ears and Lassie's line delivery.\n\n2. Mila Kunis as the world's hottest toilet cleaner. She's also a \"recurrence\" who happens to have the exact DNA as the deceased queen of the universe. (What are the odds?) No modern-day warrior queen, she's more like Cinderella in space, always falling off a tall building and getting rescued by Tatum.\n\n3. Eddie Redmayne as a villian dressed like an extra from David Bowie's \"Blue Jean\" video. He talks in a silky whisper, like a Persian cat on a radiator, except when he's angry, then his voice goes UP A NOTCH. He preens and pouts and sweats through his closeups. Stephen Hawking, he's not.\n\n4. A busy, confusing future world that has elements of \"Dune,\" \"The Fifth Element,\" \"Star Wars,\" \"Brazil\" and \"The Matrix\" but nothing to tie all the spaceships and scaffolds and sub-basements together.\n\n5. A silly, confusing, sorry excuse for a narrative. Characters zip in and out with no explanation or motivation or backstory and the whole enterprise lurches from chase scene to explosion to drawn-out conclusion. The visual influences are everywhere but the continuity is missing: \"Jupiter Ascending\" is Steampunk without the wit and watch chains, Kubrick without the chilly grandeur, \"Star Trek\" without the five-year mission to boldly go where no man has gone before.\n\nOn the plus side, \"Jupiter Ascending\" does have is an ambitious scope and some cool effects, particularly in 3D. They're front-loaded -- a long chase above the Chicago skyline is pretty amazing -- and derivative. (Are those the aliens, and the alien-killing guns, from the \"Men in Black\" movies?)\n\nBut what's left is a disaster, a spectacular collapse that can be laid at the feet of the Wachowskis, the brother-and-sister team that took a big-budget challenge from Warner Bros. to deliver an original space opera and spent all the money on set design. In a real opera, the characters have to sing. In a space opera, they have to talk, at least once in awhile. The dialogue in \"Star Wars,\" didn't win any prizes, but whenever anyone talks in \"Jupiter Ascending,\" it's painful. At one point, Jupiter Jones -- played by Kunis, and perhaps a distant cousin of Dr. Christmas Jones, the nuclear physicist played by Denise Richards in the Bond movie \"The World Is Not Enough\" -- notices that bees are swarming around her in a friendly way.\n\nStinger, a friend of Tatum's character, Caine Wise, and a fellow \"splice,\" is part man-part bee. He explains:\n\n\"Bees don't lie.\"\n\nYeah, and dead men tell no tales.\n\nStinger's quite the sage. He also tells Jupiter \"It's not what you do. It's who you are.\"\n\nIn another scene, Redmayne's character, Balem Abrasax, waxes philosophical:\n\n\"Time is the single most precious commodity in the universe.\"\n\nAnd time's-a-wastin'.\n\nJupiter, perhaps tired of being the audience surrogate and forever asking \"Who's he? What's that?\" gets exasperated and exclaims: \"Could this get any weirder?\"\n\nIf it did, it would be \"Spaceballs.\" \"Jupiter Ascending\" has a tribute to \"Brazil,\" complete with a cameo from Terry Gilliam, and some references to \"The Matrix,\" the Wachowskis' breakthrough that feels like it was made in a galaxy far, far away, almost 16 years ago.\n\nA final word about originality. \"Jupiter Ascending\" is being defended because it is original, not based on a novel or a comic-book character or a fantasy series. Lana Wachowski addressed the decision to move it from last summer's schedule in an ABC interview: \"The summer is built around familiarity. Many cultural critics who shape awareness for films are obsessed with sequels and derivative material. They wildly crave it. That kind of environment is hostile to originality. It only makes space for derivative material and rejects originality. I think Warner Bros. was uncomfortable with that environment.\"\n\nSure, but what matters most is quality. \"The Avengers\" and \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" are derived from comics but are fresh and exciting. \"The Amazing Spider-man\" and \"Man of Steel\" are not. \"Star Wars\" and \"The Matrix\" are groundbreaking movies made from original scripts. \"Interstellar\" and \"Jupiter Ascending\" are not.\n\n\"Jupiter Ascending\"\n\nGrade: D\n\nRating: PG-13\n\nRunning time: 127 minutes\n\nPlaying at: Opens Feb. 5 for evening previews, everywhere on Feb. 6.\n\nCast and crew: Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Eddie Redmayne, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, Tuppence Middleton; written and directed by Andy and Lana Wachowski.\n\nThe lowdown: Space, the final frontier, where nothing makes sense, at least not in this movie.\n\n-- Jeff Baker\n\n503-221-8165"
