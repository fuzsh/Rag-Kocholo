        "text": "10-Aug-13 – Filming of an aerial sequence involving a stunt performer suspended from a helicopter – and helicopters landing in the Loop – starts today.\n\nRozar Pictures, LLC, an affiliate of Warner Bros. Pictures, is filming in downtown Chicago for Jupiter Ascending, a science fiction movie set in the distant future that is being written, directed, and produced by Chicago natives Andrew and Lana Wachowski.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Film Office, filming will continue through August 26 with most of the flights occurring between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m. in the Loop and near Willis Tower specifically. Two helicopters will fly low every morning at least through Wednesday, when they move to an area near the Chicago Harbor Lock (above).\n\nFilmmakers had to get a city ordinance passed to allow them to land and launch helicopters in downtown Chicago. 42nd Ward Alderman Brendan Reilly introduced the ordinance on May 8.\n\nFilming in Chicago for Jupiter Ascending started on July 20, three days after filming wrapped for Divergent. A third science fiction movie, Transformers 4, is also filming in Chicago and should be here for the next two months.\n\nWith these films and six network television series shooting in Chicago, the city estimates local spending by filmmakers could exceed last year’s record of $184 million.\n\nJupiter Ascending stars Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones, a young woman destined to rule the universe but who must first dodge an assassin, played by Channing Tatum, sent by the current queen. It will be released on July 25, 2014.\n\nRelated story: Helicopter will take off and land downtown for Wachowski film\n\nPhoto: Chicago Harbor Lock from Chicago River (2012).
