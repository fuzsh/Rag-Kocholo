        "text": "Maybe you have seen the movie trailer with Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis: star chasing, galaxy hoping, action-packed adventure in Jupiter Ascending–well, apparently, parts of the film were shot in Bilbao, Spain!\n\nJupiter Ascending\n\nFrom our Resident Director, Ibon:\n\n[dt_call_to_action style=”1″ background=”plain” content_size=”normal” text_align=”left” animation=”none” line=”true”]\n\nNews about Bilbao. Have you heard about the new Wachowski movie, Jupiter Ascending? Part of it has been shot in Bilbao, and in the attached picture you can see how the city has been artificially distorted to project a futurist image. For those who have visited Bilbao you can recognize the view of the Guggenheim and the estuary of Bilbao with the Puente de la Salve in the background.\n\nProducers have decided to celebrate the premiere in Bilbao, two days before the film is shown to the rest of world. The gala will take place the 4th of February at the Alhóndiga Civic Center, two blocks away from our office where our students normally go to study, work out and swim everyday.\n\nHave a great week.\n\nIbon\n\n[/dt_call_to_action]\n\nIn case you haven’t seen the trailer:\n\nBilbao, Spain, aside from being a beautiful filming location, has plenty more to offer its students. “Okay, you’ve convinced me (Channing Tatum/Mila Kunis), let’s see what it’s like to study abroad in Bilbao.”\n\n–USAC\n\nP.S. Don’t forget to share the popcorn!"
