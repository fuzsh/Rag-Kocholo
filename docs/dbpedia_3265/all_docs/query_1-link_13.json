        "text": "Let’s face it, there’s no way to list every single one of the best movies set in Chicago. Our collection inevitably leaves out somebody’s favorite Chicago movie. The fans of Ferris Buller’s Day Off, for example, will be very disappointed in a Best of Chicago Movies list that focuses on gritty, edgy films like Christopher Nolan’s Batman series, which uses Chicago locations as a stand-in for Gotham, or the Clive Barker horror-fest Candyman.\n\nOur list is more about the city than the genre or content of the film; there are plenty of movies where Chicago is just as much a star as any of the big Hollywood names who show up in the films. See below the Best of list if you want to see the full list of movies filmed in Chicago.\n\nBest Movies Set In Chicago\n\nThe Blues Brothers\n\nIt’s a hoary old classic from the 1980s, but one that shows more of Chicago and the surrounding area than probably any other film ever made.\n\nAnd it has an all-star cast including Carrie Fisher, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and too many other musical luminaries to name. John Belushi and Dan Ackroyd take their SNL characters to the big screen not realizing that they’ve accidentally started an entire film movement bringing small-screen comedy to Hollywood. And on that note…\n\nWayne’s World\n\nSNL’s Mike Myers and Dana Carvey bring their lovable lunkheaded antics off the SNL set and onto the silver screen and somehow manage to pull off a feature-length movie out of the concept.\n\nThe fictional TV show Wayne’s World is set in Aurora, Illinois, which technically makes it a film for this list since Aurora is known to many locals as being part of “Chicagoland” which reaches far beyond the Magnificent Mile and into suburban Chicago areas such as Oak Park, Joliet, and Aurora, Illinois.\n\nBatman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, The Batman\n\nIn the interest of space, it makes sense to lump all these Batman films together by virtue of how much they showcase Chicago and surrounding areas. Some of the most familiar sights of the city show up in these films, and in some cases the director chose not to CGI-out landmarks, signs, and other visuals that specifically tie the movies to Chicago, notably the Franklin Street Bridge and parts of Lower Wacker Drive. The film is not technically set in the city, but the real Chicago is definitely on display.\n\nChiraq\n\nDirector Spike Lee shot his film on gun violence for some five weeks in the Chicago South Side and Englewood, but also at well-known locations such as the now late-great Double Door, the General Jones Armory, and the Chicago Cultural Center.\n\nIf you have never seen Chiraq, consider the writeup the Chicago Tribune gave the movie, calling it a satire “based on the Aristophanes play ‘Lysistrata’ from 411 B.C.” In that play, the Tribune notes, “Grecian women withhold sex until their men put an end to the Peloponnesian War”.\n\nTransformers 3: Dark Of The Moon, TransFormers 4: Age of Extinction\n\nGiant metal robots beating each other up in Chicago? Local residents loved it and hated it at the same time during the filming of these movies, which closed down big portions of Wacker Drive, Indiana Avenue, and North Wabash Avenue for filming. The annoyance of the road closures was replaced (for some) with fascination watching a major film production take over major city blocks for two Transformers films in a row.\n\nHigh Fidelity\n\nNo monsters, villains, or giant robots; just John Cusak and Jack Black and their daily misadventures running a fictional major record store in Chicago. The record store in the film was only a few blocks from a real legendary Chicago record store, Reckless Records. Other great Chicago locations featured in this film include the Green Mill, a speakeasy-type watering hole and The Music Box Theater, which is a beautifully preserved old-fashioned mid-century modern movie house.\n\nThe Untouchables\n\nBrian de Palma tells the story of Elliot Ness trying to put an end to the Al Capone crime empire. Union Station, the Chicago Cultural Center, and Roosevelt University are all locations used to tell the story. Fun real-life Chicago trivia about the people represented in this movie; one source claims that in 1923, the real-life Al Capone bought a home in the South Side of Chicago just five miles down the road from where a college student named Elliot Ness lived with his parents.\n\nBreakfast Club and Ferris Buller’s Day Off\n\nJohn Hughes was known as a “Chicago filmmaker” since most of his comedies are set in suburban Chicago as well as Chicago proper. Ferris Buller’s Day Off shows off Michigan Avenue, parts of Des Plaines and Northbrook, where Breakfast Club shows…the inside of a high school. But in spite of this, there’s something strangely Chicago about The Breakfast Club–it’s set in the burbs and shows nothing of the city, it’s true. But the John Hughes vibe is there.\n\nCandyman, Candyman 2, and the 2021 Candyman\n\nClive Barker’s Candyman series, including the 2021 Candyman directed by Nia DaCosta, are all set in and shot in Chicago. The film’s events take place in Chicago’s Caprini Green district, which was once notorious for violence before it was heavily gentrified; the Candyman series is supernatural horror with a strong social commentary.\n\nThe 2021 film was shot in Chicago’s Near North district but also has the distinction of being possibly the first film shot on location at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. The original Candyman films were also shot in Near North but also at locations on the campus of the University of Illinois at Chicago.\n\nThief\n\nThis gritty film features James Caan and a host of Chicago locations including the Shedd Aquarium, Western and Irving Park, and Chinatown. Michael Mann’s feature-length debut is said to be his “most Chicago” film, and this one features a pulsating score by Tangerine Dream. It’s the classic “retired bank robber does one last job” plot, and stars Chicago actor Jim Belushi alongside Caan, Tuesday Weld, and Willie Nelson.\n\nEight Men Out\n\nThe story of corruption in major league baseball isn’t the draw for some; it’s the fact that it was a true-life story about a Chicago baseball team is the real attraction for fans of Chicago movies. The 1919 Chicago White Sox team will go down in sports history as being one of the most notorious; this film tells the story of eight players permanently banned from big-league baseball after throwing a World Series game.\n\nWe include Eight Men Out here because it is directly related to a real-life event central to Chicago’s identity as a city, but it’s also the joker in the pack because most of the locations used to tell this story were shot outside of Chicago; Cincinnati and Louisville being among the most notable. The fact that the movie was made without using the White Sox stadium in any way might have had more to do with aesthetics than anything else, but it’s interesting to note that this film shows up on most Best of Chicago movies lists in spite of it being shot elsewhere.\n\nAll Movies Filmed in Chicago"
