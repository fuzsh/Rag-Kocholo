        "text": "Don't be surprised to see burning buildings and explosions in the downtown area over the next few weeks.\n\nIt may all be part of the \"Transformers 4\" production, which begins filming in Chicago Friday.\n\nThe Michael Bay-directed film will begin shooting Friday at McCormick Place, according to movie blog OnLocationVacations.com. Some roads near the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place will be shut down at times to accomodate the filming, which will include \"controlled explosions, car flips, eruptions, and other pyrotechnics.\"\n\nMore filming is expected Saturday and Sunday in the Near East Side neighborhood, according to fliers posted to residents and businesses in the area.\n\nThe following streets may be closed due to filming:\n\nRandolph from Michigan to Field\n\nStetson from Lake to Randolph\n\nColumbus Dr from Jackson to Randolph\n\nE South Water from Michigan to Stetson\n\nStetson from E South Water to Lake\n\nWacker from 323 E Wacker Dr to end"
