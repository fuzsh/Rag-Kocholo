        "text": "Jupiter Ascending will always be remembered as a noble science fiction failure from the Wachowski siblings, the creators of the eternally popular The Matrix, and nothing else worth mentioning. Jupiter Ascending had a few novel ideas, a pretty awesome visual sheen, and of course, epic music. The production design, costuming, and CGI all deserve praise. Unfortunately, when your screenplay is more like a screen-stop (a terrible pun that I take full unashamed credit for), your plot is tissue-thin with more holes than a pair of my socks, and your characters are more one-dimensional than cartoons, just looking and sounding good isn’t enough. Jupiter Ascending concerns Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), a simple house cleaner in modern day Chicago, who is captured by the human-wolf hybrid disgraced soldier Caine (Channing Tatum) on behalf of the immensely powerful Titus Abrasax (Douglas Booth). Titus seeks to use Jupiter, the (unknowing) rightful queen of Earth, as a pawn in the rivalry with his equally powerful Abrasax siblings (Eddie Redmayne and Tuppence Middleton) by marrying her to claim Earth as his property, and subsequently harvest humanity to create a regeneration serum to prolong his life.\n\nIt’s a pity that such an overall flop has touches and ideas I loved: the throwaway ‘origins’ for the traditional grey aliens and how crop circles are made, the amusingly simple explanation for how dinosaurs became extinct, the background characters that build on the concept of gene-splicing humanoids with animals, the fact that government bureaucracy is just as bad in space as it is on Earth. Even the central issue of who the Abrasax family is, and what they are doing, is fascinating (more so than Jupiter herself) – I was actually more interested in exploring the depth of their sibling rivalry than I was in watching Mila Kunis fall off something for the fourteenth time. What a shame that these glimmers of intelligent sci-fi are lost amid the interminably confusing action sequences, Sean Bean’s unintentionally hilarious revelations about bees, and Eddie Redmayne’s whispery petulance, which makes him seem less like a sinister space villain and more like a kid with a bad case of Saturn strep throat. Someone get him some lozenges, please.\n\nHowever, the fact that the Wachowski’s went back to Michael Giacchino, who had scored their 2008 film Speed, for the film’s soundtrack was met with universal praise. Giacchino understood what the film was trying to be – a space opera from the 70s and 80s, much like Star Wars – and gave it a score worthy of such an odyssey. Grand brassy action sequences, noble string passages, choral magnificence and thunderous percussion are the hallmarks of this score; a few motifs for important characters are thrown in, but for the most part the score indulges in a series of compositions that take their time to explore the emotional heights and lows of the material they are supposed to underscore. Like John Williams with E.T, Giacchino was actually given a chance to write music before production was finished, with pretty good results concerning the quality of the music as the listener hears it on the soundtrack album. Unfortunately, a number of Giacchino’s careful compositions were ripped apart to fit filmed sequences by clumsy editors, with only a few preserved in the film as one hears them on the album.\n\nThe first four tracks are arranged into a sort of 20 minute overture, establishing the style of the music for the film and the expectations for the rest of the score. The ‘1st Movement’ opens with a gargantuan fanfare of brass, strings, choir and percussion, playing a three note motif for Jupiter Jones, which then gets some more restrained and mysterious renditions immediately afterwards, and then gets a developed melodic statement by solo boy soprano at 1:45. The melody itself nicely captures the sentiment of the film and Jupiter Jones’ comparative smallness to the intergalactic story in which she is caught up. The cue ends as grandly as it opened, with some excellent choral work. The ‘2nd Movement’ opens with a secondary melody, which builds upon the context of the first. Once again it feels intimate despite the grandiose setting, emphasised by the solo instruments carrying the melody against a fuller orchestral backdrop. Despite this, moments of the music carry a real sense of dramatic, operatic narrative.\n\nThe ‘3rd Movement’ gives us a full throttle action sequence, with a third theme as its cornerstone, and contains much excellent writing for strings, brass, and choir, with a relentless percussion undercurrent. Surprisingly, this theme, with its action-based first performance, becomes the love theme for Jupiter and Caine, heard again on harp in ‘Digging Up the Flirt’ and ‘Abdicate This!’. The ‘4th Movement’ brings the tempo and dynamics back down after all the intensity, and takes time to explore a gorgeous fourth melody akin to the second melody. The third melody is revisited at 1:34, this time for languorous strings, and its harmonic capability and operatic nature is spine-tingling. The cue ends with a darker, more malevolent melody for boy soprano supported by strings, with the three note ‘Jupiter’ motif sung in counterpart by low male voices. These first four cues, the film’s “overture”, are in fact my favourite from the album, and I can imagine they would make for an epic concert piece. Someone – Keith Lockhart, John Wilson – someone please get on that!\n\nWhen it comes to the score proper, unfortunately due to the fact that the album is soooo long, I actually end up losing my interest by the time I get halfway through! Thus, I find it difficult to talk about individual cues in depth – in a way this is praise, and Giacchino clearly put a lot of effort and concentration into developing motifs and themes, littering them throughout the score as it progresses, and it shows a level of stamina that I can’t keep up with! Having said that, a couple of cues do stand out as being particularly memorable.\n\n‘The Abrasax Family Tree’ is the first of these, and as a sort of “Abrasax suite” it provides the greatest statements of the nefarious and malevolent motif for the Abrasax siblings. A 7 note melody for brass, it explodes into life in the first few seconds of the cue, taking the listener quite by surprise. This is followed by some tense, uneasy string work, before the motif is re-introduced at 0:58 for viola with chime accents. We then hear an ominous throaty choral and cello rendition reminiscent of the Emperor’s theme from Return of the Jedi at 2:42, which is then counterpointed by a sub-melody at first for other voices, and then for boy soprano solo – very clever musical writing. At 4:19 this all dies away for an uneasy choral segment, before the theme comes back with a palpable sense of tension at 5:06, and then with ginormous power at 5:38. An insistent marching rhythm for brass, strings, and percussion takes over, and then at 6:40 the theme reappears with titanic presence. The ragged horn phrases here are most impressive. The cue ends with a subtle quiet segment, returning to the opening minutes, as the theme is performed one last time on celeste with tolling bells on the accents over a string tremolo, once again reinforcing the mystery and unsavoury intent of the Abrasax family. This cue is a fine example of how to create a dramatic arc, and a masterful display of how to construct musical passages of quite different dynamics with the same, malleable motif. The motif for the Abrasax family is further heard in ‘The Shadow Chase’, ‘One Reincarnation Under God’, and ‘Family Jeopardy’.\n\n‘I Hate My Life’ is another standout cue, this one a bouncy scherzo for strings, woodwind and light percussion, later with heavier strings and brass. A light flute based hook appears at the beginning of the track, which becomes the cornerstone of the track, leading us through. Some more excellent choral chanting appears at 1:04 to further guide us through, and then a secondary Jupiter theme from the ‘4th movement’ appears on strings, and then by boy soprano solo. The cue ends with grand displays of each thematic device developed in the cue, with some grandiose brass and choir, and a final flourish. ‘The Titus Clipper’ also stands out for being a long, legato piece for strings and horns, a little John Barry-esque, which gradually develops over the course of its 6 and a half minute runtime. The repeated ostinato percussion rhythms (somewhat tribal in nature), string rhythms, and 3 variations on a main melody are all superb, combining to make the track an oasis of calm and genteel nobility, a break from the action sequences before and after.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I’m afraid the rest of the score’s repetitive nature makes it all rather a blur. Jupiter’s motif, which tends to play in subtle second fiddle to other elements, is almost entirely miss-able as the first thing you hear on piano and choir in ‘Scrambled Eggs’, receives an understated performance on chimes at the end of ‘A Wedding Darker’, and is heard again on celeste underneath string ostinatos at 3:10 of ‘It’s a Hellava Chase’. ‘Abidcate This!’ features a very clever choral counterpoint of the ‘Jupiter’ motif to the ‘Abrasax’ motif, underscoring the final confrontation between the heroine and Balem Abrasax (Redmayne), the film’s primary antagonist.\n\nThere are many action sequences, gargantuan, and full of unrestrained thrusts, explosions of volume, bursts of thematic resonance, and a vast array of orchestral and choral highlights. The action music is usually built around recurring rhythmic ideas jumping between orchestral instruments, with constant changes in tempo for a sense of forward motion. There is raspy brass for many sections featuring the Abrasax siblings, and whirling string cascades for anything involving flight, and plenty of references to John Williams in the orchestration of cues such as ‘It’s a Helluva Chase’, ‘Family Jeopardy’ and ‘Flying Dinosaur Fight’. Nevertheless, the music remains clearly within the style of Giacchino’s other action-based scores such as the Planet of the Apes reboot franchise and the three new Star Trek films, which is something to be admired – a unique voice can sadly be lost in the soundscape of Hollywood if not careful. At the other end of the scale, pieces like the aforementioned ‘The Titus Clipper’ and ‘Digging Up the Flirt’ are serene, while the final cue, ‘Commitment’, features a lovely cello-led performance of the love theme that ends the score on a high note.\n\nThere is much to praise Giacchino for in the writing of this score. First, the woodwind writing is interesting and varied, encompassing the entire section: menacing bassoons, playful oboes, and John Williams-esque fluttery, flighty flutes have all got a place somewhere in the score. Equally, the choral writing is diverse and creative, featuring staccato chanting, regal crescendos, angelic cooing, and imposing outbursts. Finally, the percussion writing is very dynamic, jumping from tapped snares and lighter wooden implements, to heavier and more imposing timpani hits and pounding bass drums, as each cue demands. I would have to conclude that Jupiter Ascending is one of Giacchino’s most creative, dramatic, and operatic scores. The initial thematic material is excellently developed across the score, and the first few tracks come together as a brilliant score highlight. The richness and variety of the orchestrations and the power and magnitude of the action writing are things definitely worth celebrating, even if they tend to blur together. Critically and commercially, Jupiter Ascending was a failure, and as such, this remarkable score was relatively forgotten. However, this should not dissuade you from experiencing the music.\n\nGod bless,\n\nP.S. – the images for this review are not for the original soundtrack album, they are either a special edition cover or fan art.
