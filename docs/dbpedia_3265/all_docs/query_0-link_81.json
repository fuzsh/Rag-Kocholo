        "text": "Directed by Nick Moore (Wild Child, Horrid Henry: The Movie) and written by Paul Rose (‘Dani’s House’), the film will also star a host of British quality acting talent, including Jessica Hynes (Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix; Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger), John Sessions (Filth; The Iron Lady),Luke Neal (Jupiter Ascending; ‘Starlings’), Izzy Meikle-Smith (Snow White and the Huntsman) and Luke Tittensor (‘Emmerdale’, ‘Holby City’).\n\nA heartwarming, quintessentially British adventure for all the family, PUDSEY: THE MOVIE follows cheeky London stray dog, PUDSEY, who is quite happy being a lone ranger and looking out for number one until he meets siblings Molly (Izzy Meikle-Smith), George (Spike White) and Tommy (Malachy Knights). Following her divorce, their mother Gail (Jessica Hynes) is moving the family to the sleepy village of Chuffington-on-Sea and Pudsey tags along, to the dismay of their landlord, Mr Thorne (John Sessions) and his cat Faustus. As Pudsey starts to settle in with the family and realize what he was missing when he was alone, he stumbles across Thorne and Fautus’ evil plan and he determines to save them and the whole village.\n\nProduced by Vertigo’s Rupert Preston and Marshall Levitan and executive produced by Allan Niblo, James Richardson, Jonathan Shalit, Mark Brittain, Ben Todd, Nigel Williamsand Jamie Carmichael with co producer Michael Ford. Content is selling international rights.David Walliams said of the project, “I am thrilled to be providing the voice of Pudsey. I have been coming up with different voices for him ever since that first audition.”\n\nRupert Preston of Vertigo states: \"We're delighted to be working with Syco on such a family friendly British film and with such British icons as David Walliams and Pudsey, and we can’t wait to share this with audiences.”\n\nMark Brittain of Syco Entertainment added: “We are delighted to be working with Vertigo on this project and particularly thrilled that, little more than a year after Pudsey wowed the nation by winning Britain’s Got Talent, he is now becoming a bona fide film star.”\n\nJamie Carmichael from Content said: “Content is really excited to be working with Vertigo and Syco on what is clearly going to be a hilarious and classic British family film – and we can’t wait to help make Pudsey into the most famous dog in the world!”\n\nA Vertigo Films and Syco Entertainment production in association with Infinite Wisdom and Backwell Productions. The company is adopting a portfolio approach to development – investing up to £10,000 into each of 50 new projects over the next 3 years, with follow-on investment available for projects that make a connection with an audience.\n\nWildseed has recently completed its first round of funding and has already invested in two projects. The first is a wickedly funny animated show for young adults based on the work of underground UK comic artist Ralph Kidson and features ‘God and Jesus’ where God explains his plans to Jesus for his latest miracle, ‘Animal Job Centre’ where an unemployed squirrel tries to navigate the vagaries of the job market and ‘Serengeti’ where punchy and loutish animals launch into foul-mouthed tirades against each other at the slightest provocation.\n\nThe second project is a live-action sci-fi/horror web series from 19 year old creator Drew Casson – a 90 minute, special effects heavy horror sci-fi coming of age story, shot vlog style, about a small English Town being taken over by aliens with Drew’s usual layer of horror, stunning special effects and action.\n\nMore projects are expected to be announced soon.\n\nWildseed describes itself as being platform neutral – putting great characters at the heart of everything it does and then looking to distribute projects to the platforms that best suit the idea. ‘A YouTube Channel will be a big part of what we do’ says co-founder and MD Miles Bullough, ‘but we are also working with creators who, for example, want to produce a mobile game first and that is really exciting for us where there is a great character at the heart of the game’.\n\nTargeting young adult audiences (13 to 35), Wildseed Studios is looking for ideas in four genres: Genre Fiction (Sci-Fi/horror/fantasy), Animated Sitcom, Character Comedy and then also comedy for Kids 6-11 in both live action and animation. ‘We have also set aside 10 of our 50 potential investments for ‘Wildseed’s Wildseeds’ – ideas that don’t necessarily fit any of the above genres but that we love and want to get involved with anyway’ says co-founder and Creative Director, Jesse Cleverly.\n\nBefore setting up Wildseed Studios, Bullough spent 9 years at Aardman as Head of Broadcast working on international and multi-platform brands such as Shaun The Sheep, Wallace and Gromit and Creature Comforts as well as setting up Aardman’s Rights and Digital divisions. Prior to that he was MD at comedy indie Absolutely which produced shows such as Trigger Happy TV, C4’s Armstrong & Miller, Stressed Eric and The Jack Docherty Show.\n\nCleverly has been running his own IP development company Connective Media for the past five years working with a range of blue chip clients. Prior to this he spent 10 years at the BBC in a range of editorial positions. He was trained as a script editor at BBC Films where he put the film Eastern Promises into development. He was then asked to join the team setting up BBC Fictionlab as Head of Development exploring the new formats, new platforms and new technologies which would enable storytelling in the digital age. He finished his time at the BBC working as Head of Co-productions and Acquisitions at CBBC. Prior to the BBC he was Head of Marketing at the Royal Court Theatre for Stephen Daldry where he commissioned the world’s first theatre website and launched 90 new plays.\n\n‘Miles and I have spent the last 9 months working on our business plan and fund-raising’ says Cleverly, ‘and we have found that there are lots of incredible creators out there who are making original engaging content with huge potential, but who lack the resources and experience to take what they do to the next level. We aim to be the company that enables them to develop into the next generation of entertainment trail blazers’.\n\n‘We’ve also had a great reaction to our plans from established creators’, says Bullough. ‘Our proposition of not needing creative control, offering a meaningful share of back-end and moving fast and fearlessly has struck a chord with people who have great CV’s already but are interested in working a new way.’\n\nWildseed is focussing on low-cost production with its early pilots. ‘Neither we nor our creators make money from our early stage investments – it all goes into the projects’ says Bullough.\n\nWildseed is looking for its early stage investments to deliver finished content that can be put in front of audiences to gauge their reaction. Where that reaction is positive there will be with greater levels of follow on investment to create projects that break out and establish themselves on multiple platforms including TV, theatrical features and stage shows.\n\n‘For our investment-funnel model to work’, says Bullough, ‘we need just one of our 50 investments to turn into a breakout hit. That feels achievable given our experience, our test and roll out methodology and the amount of talent out there looking for investment and support. The key will be to create characters that the audience wants to be or be with and when we do, to be ready to exploit them across all media and all over the world.’\n\n‘Working on our business idea, writing business plans, presenting, fund-raising and launching a start-up over the last nine months has been a thrilling experience’ says Bullough. ‘What has really been exciting though is the projects that we have been unearthing. Some of the people we are working with are at a turning point in their burgeoning careers we have been able to make a crucial contribution to what they do. This has already been as rewarding for us as anything we have ever been involved in professionally.’\n\nAmar Akbar & Tony, an independent production by writer / director Atul Malhotra, is a comedy drama with a highly original plotline and cleverly developed script which embodies and depicts the unique and vibrant landscape of London.\n\nThe title alludes to the 1970s Bollywood classic Amar Akbar Anthony and revolves around the strong bond of friendship bordering on brotherhood between the three main characters. But that is where the similarities with the Bollywood film ends. Amar, Akbar & Tony is a real coming of age drama that celebrates the inclusiveness of British culture.\n\nMartin Delaney (Katherine Bigelow’s Oscar-winning Zero Dark Thirty, Clint Eastwood’s Flags of Our Fathers) plays Tony; Rez Kempton (Merchant Ivory’s Mystic Masseur, Spooks) plays Amar; and Sam Vincenti (Waking The Dead, Alfie) plays Akbar. Their characters will give the audience a genuine reason to laugh, cry and fall in love. As we follow their lives, the question remains – will their friendship survive the emotional roller coaster that we call life?\n\nAlso starring Laura Aikman as Samantha – an attractive jobbing actress who has visions of hitting the big time but settles for small theatre roles in the meantime. Unlike her character, Laura is a familiar face on the big and small screen, and has been appearing in TV and films since childhood, she became a well-known face on the BBC hospital drama Casualty. Laura also starred as Rosie, Keith Lemon’s Geordie girlfriend, in Keith Lemon: The Movie.\n\nThe film also features the multi-talented actress and singer-songwriter Karen David - famous for her starring roles in the hit BBC drama Waterloo Road and the Hollywood blockbuster, The Scorpion King 2-Rise of a Warrior. Karen plays Meera, an attractive young woman who arrives from India as a new bride. On the surface things seem fine but her marriage is far from happy and despite the odds, Meera struggles on, resulting in a surprising turn of events.\n\nKaren, who will be getting married in between filming says: \"I found the script so endearing and really appreciated the fresh depiction of South Asians. Meera's character is so different from anything I've played, and it will be a wonderful challenge to play her. There are a lot of complex layers in her character. She is mysterious at first, and a lot is going on behind those eyes that you don't find out until later on in the story. The characters, and the story lines, are definitely going to get people talking!\"\n\nGoldy Notay who is best known for her work in Gurinder Chadha’s It’s A Wonderful Afterlife and Sex And The City 2, plays Sonia – Amar’s flirtatious and wayward sister. Her reputation precedes her, but deep down Sonia is the family-orientated girl next door with a heart of gold.\n\nAn electrifying supporting cast, featuring special cameo appearances by favourites - Meera Syal (Nigel Cole’s All In Good Time, Goodness Gracious Me), Ace Bhatti (The charismatic Dr. Khan from EastEnders) and Nina Wadia (EastEnders, Doctor Who), will certainly add colour to the film. The eclectic line-up also includes; Amrita Acharia who has most recently been seen in the epic fantasy drama Game Of Thrones and Shide Boss - the British Asian singer/songwriter who turned professional after winning Channel 4’s Hollyoaks Unsigned Music Show.\n\nDirector Malhotra’s vision is to represent London culture and explore all its complexities. He comments: “My vision is to portray on film, the self-assuredness and determination of the multicultural youth of today. There have been so many portrayals of Asian people wanting to escape from their cultural heritage, but I wanted to explore the contrasting angle. The film will embrace the vibrancy and distinctiveness of this influential culture and will wear its Asian heart proudly on its sleeve. My film is a celebration of the bonds that tie us together through friendship, love, loss and ultimately redemption.”\n\nVictoria Wood (Svengali, Queens Of The Cage) produces for Sash Media Productions, UK. Wood says, “I was hooked from the time I first read the script. The film has a massive heart and there is something in it for everyone. And, in Atul, I am proud to introduce a fresh new voice to the world of cinema.”\n\nFilmed on location in and around London and in particular on the famous streets of Southall, home to a thriving and successful Asian community, the film aims to appeal to a wide-ranging audience attracting the forward-thinking, modern generation of film fans across cultural boundaries throughout the UK and worldwide.\n\nThe independent filmmaking community is embracing a new British filmmaker, Vanessa Bailey, a 44 year-old actress who decided to produce her first film, ‘Three Days’, after growing frustrated by the limited roles available for older women. Taking matters into her own hands, Vanessa brought together an award winning crew to produce a film that explores an unconventional romance for a woman over forty, filled with endearingly awkward British humour and subtle emotional depth.\n\nVanessa’s agent introduced her to an upcoming, young actor, Richard Perryman, and over a cup of coffee, the two discussed developing the script together for ‘Three Days’, an age gap romance about two people from completely different worlds trying not to fall in love with each other. Vanessa’s character, Sophie, wouldn’t normally chase younger men and is a very intelligent woman embarrassed by her feelings for James, played by Richard, who is significantly younger than her. Similarly, James is surprised by his feelings for an older woman and events unfold across three days, which determine whether they will or won’t follow their hearts.\n\nWith this close collaboration and their strong screen chemistry, “Three Days’ will present an authentic account of how a younger man and an older woman might find themselves wrestling with their feelings for each other.\n\nSpeaking about the scriptwriting process, Vanessa said, “We’ve had the luxury of being able to grow our characters together whilst writing. What’s so great about writing as actors is that you know what you don’t have to write. You know what can just be felt by the actors, and in turn, the audience.”The film has attracted award-winning crew, including double BAFTA Cymru winning Cinematographer, Huw T Walters, and Darren S Cook, a Cannes 'Coup de Coeur' Award winning Director. Vanessa has also drawn together collaborations with UK indie bands, Wonderlush and Ilya, a London Fashion Week hair designer, Jason Hall, celebrity and film photographer, Gareth Gatrell, as well as attracting BBC composer, William Goodchild to score the film.\n\nThe film has been in development for over a year and is due to be filmed this summer in Bromley, Cardiff and central London, pending crowdfunding via Indiegogo, a crowdfunding website that helps independent creative projects raise finance.\n\nChris Jones, co-author of the world-renowned filmmaking bible, The Guerilla Film Makers Handbook, recently invited Vanessa to contribute a guest article for his blog, highlighting 'Three Days' as an example of actors taking innovative action to produce their own films. Chris comments, “It’s the urge to create that is so powerful, and if actors can channel that in new directions, it will be incredible”.\n\nWebsite featuring the teaser trailer: http://www.threedaysfilm.com\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/pages/Three-Days-short-film/454095254617796\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/threedaysfilm1 Lucy is six years old and spends all her time chasing after a bluebird. She believes that if she catches the bluebird, it will make all her wishes come true and bring her grandma back from death, in the short animated film which is set to capture the hearts of audiences all over the country.\n\nVanessa Whyte is one of the directors on the project; she is known for her involvement in Hollywood blockbusters ‘Prometheus’ and ‘X-Men: First Class’, as well as working with Danny Boyle on the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games. She also directed acclaimed short ‘A Trick of the Light’. Gary Carse, who has animated music videos for The Prodigy as well some well-known TV title sequences has teamed with Vanessa to direct the short, which will be submitted for a number of exciting competitions over the coming months.\n\n‘Bluebird’ was written by playwright Luke Barnes, who has recently found fame on the US TV hit, ‘Game of Thrones’. Luke was recently at Latitude Festival with his new play ‘Lobsters’, a blistering new one-act play about sex, stagnation and escaping the un-escapable, commissioned as part of PEEP2013.\n\n‘Bluebird’ will be produced by Carse & Waterman Productions, who have created animation sequences for numerous music videos and well-known TV series’. Daniel Waterman says, “We are thrilled to be creating this wonderful short with such a highly creative team. Not only is everyone involved in the project incredibly creative and dynamic, they also have links to Stoke and the area of Staffordshire, making this a completely home-grown project. We are keen to show London production companies that they do not have the monopoly on short film talent, and we hope ‘Bluebird’ will be the first of many innovative films to come out of Stoke that we create.”\n\nAs well as the stellar production team, directors and source material, the acting talent comes from the Staffordshire area too. Tamworth-based actress Margaret Jackman, best known for her role in Anton Corbjin’s Ian Curtis biopic, ‘Control’, will be playing Gramma, and local drama student Ruby Plant, aged six, will be making her acting debut. The sound engineering has been carried out by the Universal Thrift Club Music Studio in Longton, and all sets and filming space were kindly provided by Staffordshire University.\n\nUpon its completion, ‘Bluebird’ will be submitted into the Virgin Shorts Short Film Competition, where the top prize is £30,000 towards the next film from that production company. The next films created by Carse & Waterman Productions will be aiming to raise the profile of the acting talent in Stoke, and put it back on the map when it comes to some of the most creative arts.\n\nFor more information about Bluebird and Carse and Waterman’s future projects, visit http://www.carseandwaterman.com/ Oddie has teamed up with the campaign group Global Witness to expose how the UK’s biggest bank has made almost £100 million by providing loans and services to some of the most destructive logging companies in the world, in violation of the bank’s own policies. The short film pokes fun at the bank’s hypocrisy, but its message is deadly serious. A public petition launched alongside the film calls on HSBC CEO Stuart Gulliver to end the bank’s relationship with the companies destroying Borneo’s last virgin rainforests.\n\n“HSBC has made an absolute killing helping some of the world’s worst logging companies get off the ground,” said Oddie. “According to HSBC’s own rules and all the evidence, it shouldn’t be touching them with a bargepole. As a result the last of Borneo’s rainforests are under immediate threat. Everyone needs to sign the petition to stop HBSC profiting from deforestation in Malaysia and beyond, before it’s too late.”.\n\nMimicking the style of a nature documentary, the film – titled Bill Oddie’s BankWatch – studies a new species known as the “HSBC banker” in its natural habitat in London’s Canary Wharf. Oddie is filmed in HSBC’s headquarters lambasting the bank’s activities in Malaysia, before being forcibly ejected from the premises.\n\nGlobal Witness investigations have shown how HSBC provided loans and services to logging companies with close ties to Sarawak’s Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud. Taib has ruled the state for over three decades and controls all land allocation and forestry licencing, and is widely understood to abuse this power to enrich his family and associates. The companies have been at the forefront of a timber and palm oil bonanza that has left less than five per cent of Sarawak’s rainforests unaffected by logging or plantations.Taib is currently under investigation by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission. By providing services to a sector notorious for corruption and high-level political links, HSBC is at serious risk of violating international anti-money laundering regulations which require it to carry out extra checks on clients linked to senior politicians.\n\nThe Global Witness petition, launched in conjunction with 38 Degrees, calls on HSBC to hold its hands up to its wrongdoing, drop the clients in question and fix its forest policies and compliance procedures so that its investments do not finance this kind of abuse in future.\n\n“It’s high time our banks stop saying one thing while doing the exact opposite. You would think after all the scandals HSBC has been caught up in of late they’d learn to start telling us the truth,” said Oddie. “I made a stand in its HQ because customers and shareholders need to know what is going on. Watch the film – it’s funny, but the message is no laughing matter; HSBC must stop bankrolling the world’s worst logging companies.”\n\nThe film and more information on Global Witness’ forest campaigns will be available here: www.globalwitness.org/hsbc-sarawak\n\nThe petition to HSBC is available here: https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/hsbc-rainforest\n\nGlobal Witness report on this issue is available here: www.globalwitness.org/hsbc\n\nApollo Digital, by arrangement with the Royal Albert Hall, will present in October a three-date tour of Danny Elfman’s Music from the Films of Tim Burton, which will celebrate the extraordinary collaboration between the acclaimed composer and visionary filmmaker.

The overwhelming reception for his forthcoming biopic about Nikola Tesla has led American director Michael Anton to deliver a new name to sum up the iconic nature of the man and his unique legacy. The new title for the most talked-about film in Serbia reflects the iconic nature of the great man and his legacy.\n\n“Nikola Tesla does not need a controversial label,’ said director Michael Anton. “The fact that his name is not as familiar as it should be is one of the issues we intend to address with this film, which has progressed from a strong script with a modest budget into a potential voice that will finally break the great silence that is the history of Nikola Tesla.\n\n“From now on, this film will be simply titled TESLA. Nothing more, nothing less.”\n\nThe announcement was made at the R:brand Serbia Conference in a statement shared by Aleksandra Drecun, director of the Republic of Serbia Centre for the Promotion of Science. The conference in Novi Sad, attended by Serbia’s Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić, is part of the world famous EXIT festival, which attracts an international audience of many tens of thousands.\n\n“Tesla was a man of his generation. Many consider him to have invented the twentieth century,’ Michael said in a statement. “His story must not be kept from the rest of the world. Tesla deserves to have a voice not only among the American people, but with everyone. Tesla sets an example for all of us. He showed that we are capable of unimaginable things as long as we believe in the impossible.”\n\nSERBIAN ACTRESS MIRJANA KARANOVIĆ JOINS CAST OF NIKOLA TESLA BIOPIC\n\nCelebrated Serbian actress Mirjana Karanović (Grbavica/Esma’s Sectret) has joined the cast of TESLA, the Nikola Tesla biopic that is scheduled to shoot in Serbia and the United States, in the autumn. She will play Djuka, the hardworking Serbian mother who had a big influence on the inventive instincts of the young Nikola.\n\n“It is quite a small role in the film, but Djuka played a very significant role in the life of Nikola Tesla,’ said Mirjana. “She helped to define who he was. It really is an honour for me to play this hardworking woman who brought up such a strong and interesting family.”\n\nFrom the moment Mirjana read American director Michael Anton’s script for the film, she knew this was the role of Georgina-Djuka Mandić (Tesla) was one that she must play. “When I was approached about this role, I was very moved by the wonderful script, by the way each character is portrayed with such integrity,’ she said.\n\n“Michael has produced a film that is a tribute to Nikola Tesla. We are telling his story as it happened, without the silly stories that Tesla can attract. Michael has maintained the authenticity. This film should finally make the world aware of the great man and all that he did for us in our lives today.”\n\nHRISTINA POPOVIĆ JOINS AN AWARD-WINNING CAST FOR NIKOLA TESLA BIOPIC\n\nAcclaimed star of Circles & The Parade will play Nikola Tesla’s sister. Director adds star of Sundance Film Festival hit Circles to a cast of award winners.\n\nHristina Popović, the acclaimed star of celebrated films Circles and The Parade (Parada), has signed up to the glowing cast of Nikola Tesla biopic, TESLA. Hristina, who has become a familiar name at international film festivals for lauded roles in some of the Balkans biggest movies, will play Tesla’s sister Angelina.Most recently, Hristina, aged 31, has impressed audiences and critics for her role in Circles / Krugovi, from director Srdjan Golubović. As well as being awarded at the Berlin Film Festival, this film based on the tragic story of a young Bosnian Serb Srdjan Aleksić, won the Audience Award at the Sofia International Film Festival, and the Special Jury Prize at America’s Sundance Film Festival.\n\nWhile Tesla is one of the world’s greatest scientists, responsible for some of the most significant discoveries, his name remains unfamiliar to many outside of his Balkan homelands. Director Michael Anton aims to put that right with a script that sheds light on the Serb scientist’s time in the US and explores his relationship with Thomas Edison.\n\nTesla Marija Karan ZOOM\n\nSERBIAN ACTRESS MARIJA KARAN SIGNS UP TO TESLA, THE MOST TALKED-ABOUT FILM IN THE BALKANS\n\nSerbian star of The Rite and Assassination Games joins acclaimed Serb actors Branko Tomović, Mirjana Karanović and Hristina Popović\n\nSerbian actress Marija Karan will embody the feelings of the many women who fell for the charms of celebrated Serb scientist Nikola Tesla, when she joins the cast of the biopic, TESLA.\n\nMarija is well known in her native Serbia as an actress who has been made a star through a string of domestic and international film and TV roles.\n\n“I am eager to start shooting on this film about our most prominent scientist,’ said Marija, who will shoot her scenes in Serbia, with dialogue in Serbian. “Michael Anton has written a script that is authentic and honest. I like that he felt a need to understand the importance of Tesla’s origin as an immigrant in the US who, despite all problems, remained true to himself and persistent. This is not a typical American film.”\n\nIn the film, produced by Silvermask Films, Marija will play Braka, an amalgam character based on various real women. “In my research of Tesla I found a great conflict when it came to the idea of marriage, or even relationships for that matter,’ said director Michael Anton.\n\n“He viewed them as a grand distraction providing an inventor with barriers that would inhibit him from reaching his highest potential. With that said, his good looks and fame made him susceptible to the interest of many potential female suitors, although it appeared he never changed his resolve on the matter.”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TeslaTheMovie"
