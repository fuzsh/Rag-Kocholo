ABSTRACT A synthesis is presented of data concerning Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs) reported during the past 20 years through govern- mental, press and private channels. The serious evidence is clarified and analyzed. The data are reported by categories of specially trained observers and studied by patterns of appearance, performance and periodic recurrence. During the process of selecting the most reliable and significant reports, emphasis was placed on the qualifications of the observer and on cases involving two or more observers. This resulted in 746 reports being selected, after consideration of over 5000 signed reports and many hundreds of reports from newspapers and other publications. An overall look is taken at the UFO problem: The historical development of the mystery, Congressional attitudes and activity, con- sideration of the problems and dangers involved, and discussion of what is needed in the way of organized scientific research. Evidence is presented in support of the hypothesis that UFOs are under intelligent control, making plausible the notion that some of them might be of extraterrestrial origin.

Allen Hynek (Chief scientific consultant to the Air Force on UFOs) said: . .there are more reports per year now than there were in the early years of the `flying saucer era'. . . [UFO reports] have been coming to the Air Force at the rate of better than one a day over the past fifteen years. . . the daily press no longer carries such reports, except perhaps as fillers, because monotonously repeated items do not constitute news. But it is justthis repetitionthat is of potential scientific interest.\" Dr. Hynek added that the intelligence of the UFO witnesses has been \"at least average,\" often \"decidedly above average,\" and sometimes \"embarrassingly above average.\" There are basically two explanations for the consistent, world- wide reporting of UFOs every year: (1) Widespread and presently unaccountable delusion on a scale so vast that it should be, in itself, a matter of urgent scientific study; (2) people are seeing maneuvering, apparently controlled objects in the atmosphere. Of the two hypotheses, the second appears to be more reasonable and it is solidly grounded in empirical observations. It is also borne out, in enough cases to warrant far more scientific inves- tigation, by instruments. [Section VIII]. However, the basic problem is to determine as conclusively as possible which hypothesis is correct. For obvious reasons, verification of the second hypothesis could be one of the most important discoveries of all time. This report is an attempt to clarify the reliable evidence of UFOs, and to remove the fog of mysticism and crackpotism which has helped to obscure the real issues. These issues are (1) the factual evidence for UFOs and its interpretation; (2) official secrecy and its effect on efforts to arrive at truth. Under no conditions is this report, or any part of it, to be considered an endorsement, acceptance or other recognition of any claims and beliefs of a philosophical, religious or spiritual nature. Diverse beliefs in these areas are being expounded by many cults, including individuals who use the UFO subject for the purpose of self-enrichment at the expense of an ill-informed public. This report presents documented facts on the physical aspects of UFOs, which we believe should be investigated scientifically. If our hypotheses are correct they stand independently of, and do not prove, unsubstantiated tales of rides in \"flying saucers.\" Our investigations have found no evidence to support these claims, but considerable evidence of fraud. This does not mean that we believe a meeting with space men is impossible. It merely means that the public is being misled by some unscrupulous in- dividuals making these claims, whose false stories are be clouding serious evidence. NICAP and its Policies NICAP is a non-profit organization incorporated in the District of Columbia (1956). Our main goals and purposes are scientific investigation and research of reported unidentified flying objects, and encouragement of full reporting to the public by responsible authorities of all information which the government has accumu- lated on this subject. The U.S. Air Force is charged with the official investigation of UFOs, but has practiced an intolerable degree of secrecy keeping the public in the dark about the amount and possible significance of UFO evidence. [Section IX]. There- fore, we have urged Congressional hearings to help clarify the evidence and encourage a full scientific review, with the public being kept fully informed. NICAP policy is set by a Board of Governors [see inside front cover] and carried out by the executive staff. Investigations are carried out by Subcommittees (field units) of specially trained and equipped personnel. Affiliates in four states also assist with investigations, and public relations work. Panels of Special Advisers assist with evaluations of data. The executive staff are the only salaried employees. NICAP is supported by membership fees and donations. (Asso- ciate Membership is $5.00, covering six issues of the member- ship bulletin, The UFO Investigator, published approximately bi- monthly). Members assist the investigation, on their own in- itiative, by submitting newspaper clippings, first-hand reports, and other leads to information. The current membership is approximately 5000, covering all 50 states and about 25 foreign countries. A Panel of Foreign Advisers (including lawyers, en- gineers, and other professionals) aids in data gathering on a world-wide basis. NICAP has a secondary interest in all aerial phenomena, and has contributed to scientific studies of meteors and ice-falls. Data has been furnished to the American Meteor Society, various college and university departments, individual scientists, and to many hundreds of students at all levels. A recently formed NICAP Youth Council is encouraging young people to pursue a scientific interest in UFOs, aerial phenomena, and space travel. Various beliefs and attitudes have been attributed to NICAP erroneously by some of our opponents in the past several years: That we are engaged in a vendetta against the Air Force for pur- poses of sensationalism; that we accuse the Air Force of being involved in a vast conspiracy (sometimes, it is said, on an international scale) to suppress from the public proof of the reality of extraterrestrial visitations, etc. These are irrespon- sible distortions of our views. We are presenting serious, documented facts as evidence of an important phenomenon, the reality of which is denied by the Air Force. We are dissenting from the official (Air Force) position. A phrase coined by the NICAP Director--\"The Silence Group\" - - has been misused by people on both sides of the issue. The term was used to apply to one faction within the Air Force which favors suppression of UFO information from the public. This view was supported in a book by Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, chief of the Air Force UFO project, who similarly described a continuing struggle between two factions within the Air Force--one of which favored complete secrecy. The question of whether the Air Force is suppressing information about UFOs does not rest on a conspir- atorial view of history. [Section IX] We have no quarrel with the Air Force and its important mis- sion of national defense. Our criticisms are directed entirely at its allegedly scientific investigation of UFOs and public infor- mation policies on the same subject. If the United States Marine Corps were responsible for the UFO investigation, and handled it in the same manner, we would criticize its policies on the sub- ject for the very same reasons. It is claimed that the reality of UFOs has been disproved, but we are asked to accept this conclusion on authority alone without access to the data which would allow independent evalua- tion by the scientific community. We are asked to accept this conclusion in the face of evidence, such as contained in this report, which has often been \"explained\" in strange ways. [Section IX]. Merely on the basis of examining the explanations advanced by the Air Force for specific cases, one can find substantial reason to question the scientific adequacy of the official inves- tigation. This has. nothing to do with the motivation of the investigators, who no doubt are perfectly honest and sincere. Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 0 ADDroved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 At the heart of h matter is the effect of an authoritarian military system on scientific investigation. Science requires free and open discourse among scientists, individual initiative, and an atmosphere of inquiry not restricted by arbitrary regulations. Virtually all of the Air Force analyses have been conducted in secrecy, affording the scientific community as a whole no opportunity to cross-check and review the methods and reasoning used. Only end results have been released to the public, and often (without explanation) these have been counter-to-fact. Statement by NICAP Board of Governors \"Although a large percentage of reported UFOs canbe explained in terms of conventional objects and events, the residual un- explained cases constitute a separate and important problem. (The word \"UFO\" hereafter refers to the residual cases). These UFOs have proved to be a consistent phenomenon, with significant new reports made each year. A large number of the reports come from reputable and competent observers, honest and intelligent citizens. \"Given the evidence in this report, it is a reasonable hypo- thesis that the unexplained UFOs are: * real physical objects, rather than the result of imagination, hallucination, illusion or delusion; * artificial, rather than purely natural, such as meteorological and astronomical phenomena; * under the control (piloted or remote) of living beings. \"To date serious scientific attention to UFOs has been limited by several factors including: * the Air Force practice of artificially reducing the significance of the data through the use of counter-to-fact explanations of sightings and issuance of misleading statistics; * the Air Force practice of implying, through its public relations program, that all available information has been disseminated and there is no need for further investigation; * the lack of governmental recognition, through the Congress or the Executive Branch, that a scientific problem exists which ought to be thoroughly probed. 'We believe the following steps should be taken to rectify an unsatisfactory situation: (1) The evidence in Air Force files (after deletion of legitimate security information such as data concerning the capabilities of radar) should be made freely available to any interested cit- izens. (2) There should be a Congressional inquiry into the Air Force's Project Blue Book to establish, a. the amount and kind of UFO information in the files, and whether all significant non-security data has been made public; b. the scientific adequacy of the in- vestigation (whether there has been a consistently objective, scien- tific study of the evidence, or whether it has been erratic and influenced negatively by high-level policy decisions, lack of funds, or other factors). \"The foremost question which remains is: What are the UFOs? The importance of these objects, if the above hypothesis is correct, is readily apparent. In order to settle this question, we strongly recommend that a much larger scale and more thorough scientific investigation be undertaken.\" Rev. Albert H.

Olivier (President of the American Meteor Society), Narberth, Pa., reiterated his reasons for serving on the Board of Governors. Dr. Olivier does not take a position about the nature of UFOs, and his prime reason for supporting NICAP is to help dispel secrecy and en- courage scientific investigation of the phenomenon: \"In serving as a NICAP Board Member, my only purpose is to help in forcing further scientific investigation. UFOs have not been fully studied scientifically due to suppression of pertinent data and subjecting reports of trained and reputable people to ridicule. It is possible UFOs might eventually have serious effects upon our planet and its inhabitants, either for good or ill. I have no personal theory to advance or refute. In view of the importance of the subject, no matter what the outcome, I would be glad to see a very full inquiry, and the old secrecy fully removed. What I want is the whole truth brought out. I do not know what it is.\" In preparing this report, it has been our aim to establish the facts to the best of our ability, and to present them for study. In so doing, we hope to encourage a more careful, detached examina- tion of detailed specific cases. Itwillbe found that some explana- tions which have been advanced for specific cases have been super- ficial, often glossing over details which contradictthe explanation. Detailed interpretation of specific cases is difficult, and often depends on one or two facts. For anyone wishing to examine Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : ibIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 divergent interpretations of some of the cases in this report, we suggest two books which present the skeptical position: Flying Saucers and the U.S. Air Force, Lt. Col. Lawrence J. Tacker, (Van Nostrand, 1960). The World of Flying Saucers, Dr. Donald H. Menzel, (Doubleday, 1963). Both books argue that UFOs have been adequately investigated, and that there is no evidence indicating they are anything other than misidentified conventional objects or phenomena. This report contains a total of 746 UFO sightings. The main chronology [Section XI] lists 575 cases, with cross-references. (Statistics based on the main chronology are reported in Section XII) The witnesses in 50% of these cases were trained or ex- perienced observers. An additional 171 cases are included in separate chronologies [Section XII] which show the major con- centrations of UFO sightings. The reports come from 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Central America, 6 South Amer- ican countries, 10 European countries, 4 African countries, 5 Asian countries, Australia and New Zealand, major oceans and numerous islands. States with the highest frequency of sightings, as indicated by the selective process used, were: (1) California; (2) Ohio; (3) New Mexico; (4) Florida; (5) Illinois. Other countries: (1) England; (2) France; (3) Canada; (4) Japan; (5) Brazil. Of the 575 cases, two UFOs were observed in 41 cases, three UFOs in 30 cases, more than three UFOs in 81 cases. The re- mainder were observations of single objects. Richard Hall Washington, D. C. May 1964 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 :''CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R005r60R000100010001-0 SECTION I. A Cross-section of significant cases and guide to additional examples in other sections. Most people are unaware that UFO sightings, many by exception- ally good witnesses, have been reported regularly in recent years. Contrary to popular belief, the reports have continued into the 1960's. The last fully publicized series of sightings was in November 1957 [Section XII; November 1957 Chronology]. At that time the cases involving electromagnetic effects on automobile motors and lights made headlines all over the country for two weeks. Before that, UFO sightings were reported and discussed widely through 1952; in that year, the Air Force (officially charged with investigation of UFO reports) investigated a record number of cases-1,501. UFOs violated the restricted air spaces over Washington, D.C., on two consecutive weekends is July, were tracked on radar, and pursued by jet interceptors [Section XII; July 1952 Chronology]. Since 1957, the newswire services and national radio and tele- vision have rarely mentioned UFO sightings. As a result, few people outside the immediate area of occurrence ever learn about a report. Local newspapers and stations continue to report UFO activity, but it has been considered \"local\" rather than \"national\" news, in general. The misconception that UFOs are no longer being sighted, and other erroneous beliefs, are challenged in this Section. Sample reports are given, representing a cross-section of the entire report, and providing a digest of the type of evidence which constitutes the UFO problem. The cases also were chosen to furnish examples of features of UFO sightings, such as maneuver patterns [Section XIII and UFOs tracked by instruments [Section VIII]. ARE UFOs STILL BEING SEEN? This is probably the most common question asked by casually interested persons. The answer is \"yes.\" But the sighting reports do not receive the publicity they once did. [See Section XI for chronology of recent sightings]. A grayish disc-shaped object which hovered, wobbling on its axis, then evaded pursuit, was sighted October 2, 1961 at Salt Lake City, Utah, airport. Private pilot Waldo J. Harris, a real estate broker, investigated the object in his light aircraft as 8-10 ground personnel at the airport watched. Mr. Harris signed a NICAP report form on October 10, and later answered additional questions by a NICAP Subcommittee member. His report: \"I was preparing to take off in a Mooney Mark 20A from the North- South runway at Utah Central Airport when I noticed a bright spot in the sky over the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley. I began my take-off run without paying much attention to the bright spot as I assumed that it was some aircraft reflecting the sun as it turned. After I was airbourne and trimmed for my climb-out, I noticed that the bright spot was still about in the same position as before. I still thought it must be the sun reflecting from an airplane, so I made my turn onto my cross-wind leg of the traffic pattern, and was about to turn downwind when I noticed that the spot was in the same spot still. \"I turned out of the pattern and proceeded toward the spot to get a better look. ' As I drew nearer I could see that the object had no wings nor tail nor any other exterior control surfaces protruding from what appeared to be the fuselage. It seemed to be hovering with a little rocking motion. As it rocked up away from me, I could see that it was a disc shaped object. I would guess the diameter at about 50 to 55 feet, the thickness in the middle at about 8 to 10 feet. It had the appearance of sand- blasted aluminum. I could see no windows or doors or any other openings, nor could I see any landing gear doors, etc., protruding, nor showing. \"I believe at the closest point I was about 2 miles from the object, at the same altitude or a little above the object. It rose abruptly about 1000 feet above me as I closed in, giving me an excellent view of the underneath side, which was exactly like the upper side as far as I could tell. Then it went off on a course of about 170 degrees for about 10 miles where it again hovered with that little rocking motion. \"I again approached the object, but not so closely this time, when it departed on a course of about 245 degrees climbing at about 18 to 20 degrees above the horizon. It went completely out of sight in 2 or 3 seconds. As you know I can keep our fastest jets in sight for several minutes, so you can see that this object was moving rather rapidly. (1800) S (1) UFO hovered with rocking motion at about 6000 ft. south of the airport. (2) UFO rose abruptly estimated 1000 ft. as Harris closed in. (3) UFO quickly moved away an estimated 10 miles, stopped and hovered, rocking motion.(SSE). (4) As Harris closed in second time, UFO took off at high speed on 245? course (WSW) climbing at an angle of about 20?, completely out of sight in 2-3 seconds.(Copy of observer's sketch).

I was answering questions from the ground both from Utah Central, and Provo. The voice at Provo said that they could not see the object, but at least 8 or 10 people did see it from the ground at Utah Central Airport. \"As to seeing it again, I was returning to the field after it had departed when I was asked over radio if I still could see the ob- ject, and I reported that I could not. They said they had it in sight again. I turned back and saw it at much greater distance only for about a second or two when it completely vanished. The guys on the ground said it went straight up as it finally left, but I didn't see that departure.\" On the NICAP report form, Mr. Harris pointed out that the UFO at one time \"passed below the horizon in front of mountains to the south.\" This fact rules out any astronomical explanation. Later that month, an engineer in Pennsylvania saw a formation of four disc-shaped objects, with apparent lights or ports on the rims. HAVE SCIENTISTS REPORTED UFOs?

Da. el !il lire 501 Ibis .p.N: November 16, 1961 Skeptics have often claimed in public forums that \"no as- tronomer has ever seen a UFO,\" sometimes implying that this proved UFOs do not exist. Astronomers, other scientists, and experienced observers of many types have often made reports [Section V, VI]. One detailed report by trained observers, describing a man- euvering elliptical UFO, has been reported briefly in the literature. The full, copyrighted story is here reproduced, with permission of the publisher. [J. Gordon Vaeth, 11200 Miles Up - The Conquest of the Upper Air,\" Second Edition, Revised Printing. Copyright (c) 1956, The Ronald Press Company, N. Y., ppg. 113-116.] The General Mills, Inc., balloon personnel, who launched and tracked most of the large plastic research balloons during the 1940's and 1950's took little stock in UFO reports until April 24, 1949. \"On that date, a balloon crew was at the White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico, together with personnel from the U.S. Navy Special Devices Center for a special Skyhook flight to be undertaken for that Office of Naval Research activity. The author was present as Navy representative in charge of the ground handling and balloon phases of the operation. \"As part of this particular project, a balloon launching site had been established three miles north of Arrey, New Mexico. Charles B. Moore, Jr., an aerologist, graduate engineer and balloonist, and four enlisted personnel from the Navy Unit, White Sands Proving Ground, had set up facilities there to ob- serve and record local weather data preparatory to the Special Devices Center Skyhook operation. Instrumentation on hand con- sisted of a stop watch and a ML-47 (David White) theodolite, a tracking instrument consisting of a 25-power telescope so mounted as to provide readings of vertical (elevation) and horizontal (azimuth) bearings. \"At 10:20 A.M. on April 24th, this group of five released a small 350-gram weather balloon for observation of upper wind velocities and directions. The balloon was followed by Moore with the theodolite until immediately after the 10:30 reading, when he relinquished the tracking instrument to look up to find the balloon with the naked eye. \"Searching the sky for the balloon, he thought he had found it when he s i i d' t' ' 1e i rec ion Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R0O5 6DRDOO1U0UWO1gO Approved For Release 2001/04/02 the theodolite was pointed (45 degrees elevation and 210 degrees azimuth). The object was moving east at a rate of 5 degrees of azimuth change per second. \"When the difference in angle between the theodolite and the supposed balloon became apparent, Moore took over the theodolite and found the true balloon still there, whereupon he immediately abandoned it and picked up the unidentified object as it came out of the sun. At the time, the sun was at a computed bearing of 60 degrees elevation and 127 degrees azimuth. The object was moving too fast to be kept in the scope through cranking the theodolite around; one of the men, therefore, had to point the theodolite while Moore observed the object through the telescope. \"The object was an ellipsoid about 2-1/2 times as long as it was wide. It had a length of about .02 degrees subtended angle and was gleaming white in color. It did not have metallic or reflected shine. Toward the underside near the tail, the gleaming white became a light yellow. \"The object, readily visible to the naked eye and seen by all the members of the group, filled the field of the theodolite's 25-power scope. Its rapid movement, unfortunately, prevented Moore from obtaining a hard or clear focus, and no good detail was observable. \"The azimuth angle decreased as the object continued on a north heading (it originally came out of the southwest). Becoming smaller in size it moved to an azimuth reading of 20 degrees to 25 degrees, at which point the azimuth held constant. Coinci- dentally with this constant azimuth, the elevation angle suddenly increased from 25 degrees minimum to 29 degrees, at which point the object was lost to sight. It disappeared in a sharp climb after having been visible to Moore and his group for about 60 seconds. \"Fifteen minutes after the object had disappeared, Moore sent up another pibal weather balloon to check wind values. .This balloon burst after an 88-minute flight to 93,000 feet and traveled only 13 miles in a southerly direction during that time. This was positive proof that the object could not have been a balloon moving at such angular speed below 90,000 feet. \"The object was seen under conditions of a cloudless sky and no haze. It left no vapor trail or exhaust. It was observed from an isolated mud flat in the New Mexico desert where there was extreme quiet; no noise of any kind was heard in connection with the sighting, and there were no cars, airplanes, or other noises nearby which might have blotted out sound coming from the object. \"As the day progressed and airplanes flew over and near the balloon launching site, Moore's group was able to identify them by appearance and engine noise. They saw nothing again that day which bore any resemblance to the white elliptical, unidentified object. \"Moore's sighting was an extremely fortunate one in that tracking instrumentation was set up and a weather balloon air- bourne at the time. It represents one of the best substantiated and authentic unidentified object sightings on record. \"The foregoing discussion of 'flying saucers' does not represent any desire by the author to become involved in this controversial subject. The saucers have been mentioned because there has been in a number of cases a close relationship between reported sightings and the flight trajectories of Skyhook balloons. The description of Moore's instrumented sighting of an unidentified object has been included because it is authentic, details have not been previously published, and it occurred during a Skyhook operation. \"The author, and indeed Moore himself, make no claim that the unidentified object was a 'flying saucer.' The details have been set forth. Let the reader take the sighting for what it is worth and evaluate it for himself!\" [1.] Dr. Seymour L. Hess, who sighted a UFO in 1950, is a meteor- ologist and astronomer. He is currently head of the Department of Meteorology, Florida State University, and is considered an ex- pert on planetary atmospheres. [2.] See letter next col. Another sighting by General Mills, Inc., personnel in the vicinity of White Sands, New Mexico, was reported by Capt. Edward J. Ruppelt, former Chief of the Air Force Project Blue Book UFO investigation. [3.] Two General Mills employees and four others at Artesia, New Mexico, were watching a Skyhook balloon, January 16, 1951. Suddenly they noticed two tiny specks on the horizosipprovedl`i'or` elease ~hbdbqedts shot 4/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 I saw the object between 12:15 and 12:20 P.M. May 20,1950 from the grounds of the Lowell Observatory. It was moving from the South-east to the Northwest. It was extremely prominent and showed some size to the naked eye,that is, it was not merely a pinpoint. During the last half of its visibility I observed it with 4-power binoculars. At first it looked like a parachute tipped at an angle to the vertical, but this same effect could have been produced by a sphere partly illuminated by the sun and partly shadowed, or by a disc- shaped object as well. Probably there are still other configurations which would :ive the same impression under proper inclination and illuminatisn. I could see it well enough to be sure it was not an airplane (no propeller or wings were apparent) nor a bird. I saw no evidence of exhaust gases nor any markings on the objects Most fortunately the object passed between me and a small bright cumulus cloud in the Northwest. Thus it must have been at or below the cloud level. A few seconds later it disappeared, apparently into the cloud. Against the sky it was very bright but against the cloud it was dark. This could be produced by agrey body which would be bright against the relatively dark sky, but dark against the bright cloud. Alternatively, if the object were half in sunlight a:d half shadowed the sunlit part might have had no detectable contrast with the cloud while the shadowed part ap- peared dark. I immediately telephoned the U.S. Weather Bureau (2-3 miles S.W. of the Observatory). They were estimating the cloud to be 6000 feet above the ground. Now estimates of cloud heights are rather risky, no I obtained their observations of temperature and dew point, and from the known lapse rates of these quantities in a convective atmosphere, calculated the cloud base to be at 12,000 ft. I believe this latter figure to be the more accurate one be- cause later in the afternoon the cumulus clouds thickened but at all times remained well above the tops of our nearby mountains. These are about 6000 feet above us. Thus, having some idea of the object's elevation and its angular diameter through the binoculars (about equivalent to a dime seen at 50 ft. with the naked eye), I calculated its size to be 3 to 6 ft. for a height of 6-12 thousand feet, and a zenith -;Is of about 450. This size estimate could easily be in error bya factor or two, but I am sure it was a small object. The clouds were driftin_ from the SW to the NE at right angles to the motion of the object. Therefore it must have been powered in s ome way. I did not time it but for that elevation I would estimate its speed to be about 100 miles per hour, perheps as hih as 200 m.p.h. This too means a powered craft. However, I could hear no engine noise. straight toward the balloon, tipped on edge revealing their disc shape, circled the balloon once and flew off over the horizon. In comparison with the known size of the balloon, the discs were estimated to be 60 feet in diameter. A particularly detailed account of a lens-shaped disc was ob- tained from an experienced engineer by the NICAP Assistant Di- rector in personal correspondence during 1955. [4.] Date: October 1954, about mid-month Location: Cherry Valley, New York Time: About 4:00 p.m. Witness: Major A. B. Cox, graduate of Yale University, mem- ber of the American Society of Mechanical Engin- eers, and Society of American Engineers. Excerpts from letter dated December 28, 1955 from Major A. B. Cox to Richard Hall: \"The sky was more or less covered with streaks or layers of clouds, with blue sky between, so that the rays of the sun came through almost horizontally, the time being not far from sunset in the Valley. I was walking in a NE direction, having been an air- plane spotter for a long time, I have formed the habit of looking at the sky, quite naturally. \"I happened to be looking at the West in the direction of my farm buildings, perhaps a half mile distant, and saw something which at first glance was about over my farm buildings. It was quite low, and did not seem to be more than a few hundred feet above the earth. I thought at first it was a large airplane not moving very swiftly. . . . It was moving horizontally in a direction parallel to my own direction. Then I noticed that it seemed to make no noise, and then I could not see any wings or tail or fuselage generally. \"It seemed to be a large disc or lens-shaped object, and in comparison with the objects below I estimated it to be perhaps 30 or 35 feet in diameter. . . . It was moving like a wheel sliding sidewise and not rotating, and in perspective presented an elliptical appearance such as any circular object would when viewed from an angle; the degree of ellipticity varying as it came up and then passed me. I must have seen it for 20 seconds or a little more. Then it got ahead of me and it presented the appear- ^~~ kcb2 chi R0~i c,6e, 6661 UUU1 oU01 -6 The color Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 was grey, and I think perhaps a little darker on the rim or edge; not much but enough to make the edge sharply defined. \"Suddenly it stopped and seemed to be going in a direction more or less at right angles to its first motion, but still in an upright direction. . . This sudden stop interested me as an en- gineer, because any sudden retardation or acceleration requires in so large an object the application of a very considerable force, and seemed a much shorter turn and a more rapid turn than any airplane I had ever seen could be capable of. \"It then began to ascend in a direction of perhaps at right angles to its first direction and at an upward angle of perhaps 30 or 35 degrees from the horizontal. . . . There were some fleecy clouds above it, and it entered them and was lost to sight for perhaps a second or so, to emerge into vision again above this first layer of clouds. Its direction had not changed, and shortly after it entered some more layers of cloud, which were thicker, and was lost to view.\" ARE UFOs INTELLIGENTLY CONTROLLED? The definitive answer to this question must await a full-fledged investigation by scientists using appropriate instrumentation, as NICAP advocates [Section XIV]. However, the accumulation of reports by good observers and some of the special evidence such as radar trackings [Section VIII] strongly suggest this hypothesis. How else can one explain the maneuvers of the disc which pilot Waldo Harris attempted to investigate? The \"curiosity\" evidenced by the two discs which circled the Skyhook balloon? The powered flight indicated by the reports of Dr. Hess, Engineer Cox, and others? Section II discusses this question in detail. How else can one explain reports such as the following of objects approaching at meteorlike speed, then hovering or man- euvering? When these reports come from pilots, scientists, engineers, and police officers they deserve far more serious, scientific attention than they have yet received. Date: May 13, 1952 Location: National City, California Time: Approximately 8:55 p.m. PDT Witnesses: Donald R. Carr, aeronautical engineer, and at least six others in separate locations, including a teacher who is a former Navy pilot. Excerpts from Mr. Carr's report. [5.] \"I saw what I thought was the trail of a large meteor appear, approximately 5 degrees of arc East of a line between the two pointers and almost exactly in the center of the bowl of the Big Dipper. [See diagram.] The trail was of a red color and appeared to be coming down at about an angle of 20 degrees to my line of sight and in a southwesterly direction. Only the red trail was visible for about two seconds and then a small white dot became visible, from which the trail was eman- ating. The speed appeared to be meteoric and so I still thought the object was what is commonly called a 'shooting star.' [After 2 or 3 seconds] the white object had an apparent diameter of 1/64 to 1/32 inch. The trail faded and the object still continued coming down. The speed appeared to be decreasing and I noted a certain erratic quality to the flight of the object, which now ap- peared to have a self-luminous or fluorescent quality. . . [for about 10 more seconds] the object was following a gradual curved path in process of levelling off. . . [then] the object was flying level on a course almost due West. . . . I estimated the altitude of the object at this point of its trajectory to be from 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Its speed at this time appeared to be within the range of known aircraft speeds. To the naked eye the object appeared as a sphere of about 1/16 inch diameter. . . . Through the [6 power] telescope the object presented a larger disc but the brightness did not appreciably increase. . . . In level flight the object seemed to dart from side to side in an oscillating motion without diminishing of forward speed. . . . After travel- About 9:25 p.m., Mr. Carr observed what appeared to be the same object returning from the North, and circling West. It passed over downtown San Diego, where bright ground lights seemed to reflect off a metal hull. \"It is my conviction,\" Mr. Carr stated, \"that since this ob- ject followed an apparently controlled course it was not moving under the influence of gravity, and must have been guided by an intelligence unknown to us. Its dive from an extreme altitude at possibly meteoric speed, its deceleration, levelling off, and circle of the city twice indicate that it arrived from interplanetary space and was under intelligent control.\" The former Navy Pilot, Harold Strawn, with a group of students in La Mesa also witnessed the meteoric appearance, the levelling off and circling. SIDE-TO-SIDE OSCILLATION DESCENDED IN GRADUAL CURVE, SLOWING UP A INCREASING IN APPARENT NORTH PATH OF OBJECT IN SKY FROM WITNESS CARR'S DESCRIPTION -WNW A multiple visual and multiple radar sighting, similarly sug- gesting controlled flight, occurred August 12, 1953; near Rapid City, South Dakota. The UFO was first spotted hovering in the eastern sky by the Ground Observer Corps. It moved in over the city, then back to its original position. Then ground radar began tracking the UFO, and an F-84 was scrambled and vectored in on the object, chasing it for 120 miles. Both the UFO and the jet showed plainly on the GCI radar screen. Each time the jet began to close in, the UFO would move ahead with a burst of speed. When the pilot gave up and turned back to base, the UFO turned and followed. A second F-84 scrambled and chased the UFO 160 miles, ob- taining a radar lock-on. The UFO again stayed just out of reach. When the pilot switched on his radar-ranging gunsight, and the red light blinked on showing something real and solid was ahead of him, the pilot was scared. (\"When I talked to him, he readily admitted that he'd been scared. . .he asked the controller if he could break off the intercept.\" [6., p. 305].) This time the UFO continued on course to the north. The Ground Observer Corps on the path ahead was notified, and reported seeing a light speed- ing north. At the climax of the sighting, when the pilot became frightened, ground radar showed the jet and the UFO; the pilot's gunsight radar showed the UFO, and the pilot could see with his own eyes a speeding unidentified light in front of him. A NICAP member later queried the Air Force about the case, and received a written reply on September 17, 1958 stating: \"Photos of the radar scope and gun camera photos were made but were not sufficiently clear for evaluation. The Ellsworth Air Force Base case is still listed as unknown or unsolved.\" [7.] NICAP Note: The fact that the gun camera photos showed an image at all is further proof that something real and solid was outspeeding jet interceptors. In conjunction with the multiple radar and multiple visual observations, an image on the film is close to complete proof of the reality of UFOs. ling a course almost due West for approximately one mile, the Capt. W. J. Hull, veteran Capital Airlines pilot, was a UFO object turned toward the Northwest and appeared to circle over skeptic. He had written an article entitled \"The Obituary of the San Diego Bay and Point Loma and disappeared travelling North Flying Saucers\" for The Airline Pilot magazine. At 10:10 p.m., at a constant altitude and speed. During the entire time the November 14, 1956, Captain Hull was a pilot of Capital Flight object was visible there was absolutely no apparent sound created No. 77, approaching Mobile, Alabama, enroute from New York by it. Despite its terrific speed in its dive there was no shock City [8.] Suddenly, he and his co-pilot, Peter MacIntosh, noticed a bri wave or noise from its 2001/04/02 CIA l DP 1 R00v60R00010 0~f00bl'-oshield. The 4 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 plane was on a southwesterly course, and the object, looking like a meteor, was falling across their path from left to right. But instead of burning out, the \"meteor\" halted abruptly directly in front of the plane. \"What the hell is it, a jet?\" MacIntosh shouted. As the UFO remained a constant distance in front of the plane, Captain Hull grabbed his microphone and called Mobile Tower: \"Bates Tower, this is Capital 77. Look out toward the north and east and see if you can see a strange white light hovering in the sky.\" Mobile quickly answered that a thick cloud layer was obscuring vision, and asked Captain Hull if he thought the object was in the vicinity of Mobile. \"Affirmative,\" Hull replied. \"It is directly ahead of us and at about our altitude or slightly higher. We are right over Jackson and have descended to 10,000 feet. . . \" Immediately after the radio exchange, the UFO began to move. It darted back and forth, rising and falling, making extremely sharp turns, sometimes changing course 90 degrees inan instant. The color and size remained constant. \"MacIntosh and I sat there completely flabbergasted at this unnerving exhibition,\" Captain Hull reported. After 30 seconds or more, the UFO ceased its violent maneuvers and again appeared to hover ahead of the plane. About this time Mobile Tower called back: \"Capital 77, we are trying to raise the Brookley AFB Tower.\" At this moment, the UFO began another series of \"crazy gyrations, lazy 8's, square chandelles. . . \" and then shot out over the Gulf of Mexico rising at a steep angle. It diminished rapidly to a pinpoint and disappeared in the night. (Elapsed time: At least two minutes.) \"The one thing which I can't get over,\" Captain Hull stated, \"is the fact that when it came, it came steeply downward; when it departed after its amazing show, it went steeply upward!\" December 19/20 of 1958 was a cloudless night in Dunellen, New Jersey. At 12:55 a.m., Patrolmen LeRoy A. Arboreen and B. Talada were on night patrol, cruising west on Center Street. From an area elevated about 15 to 20 feet they had an unobstructed view to north, south, and west. In a signed report to NICAP, [9] Patrolman Arboreen (ex- Navy man and graduate of the New Jersey State Police Academy) described the experience: \"This object came at us from the west. At first it looked like a red hot piece of coal about the size of a quarter held at arm's length. In a matter of seconds it was as large as a ruler held at arm's length. That is when it came to a complete stop. . . \"The shape of the object was distinct. (See illustration.) The body of the object was solid bright red and it gave off a pulsating red glow completely around the object. The object hovered a few seconds, then made a left turn and again hovered for a few seconds, then went straight up like a shot. We watched it until it completely faded beyond the stars.\" In this matter-of-fact manner, the two officers described an occurrence which is totally inexplicable. Meteors do not hover or shoot upward. No known aircraft is elliptical, and glows bright red in flight, not to mention the observed performance. CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 Nor does any known phenomenon descend through the atmosphere like a meteor, then circle around, as Engineer Carr observed. Nor does the gyrating light observed by Captain Hull, descending, pacing the airliner, then ascending, have any natural explanation. HAVE UFOs BEEN SEEN IN OTHER COUNTRIES? This surprising misconception, that UFOs are exclusively a native phenomenon of the United States, is completely refuted in the Foreign Reports Section [X]. Part of the reason for this erroneous belief is the lack of information on foreign sightings reported by newswire representatives abroad. In 1962, for in- stance, a major concentration of sightings occurred in Argentina [Section XII, Argentine Chronology], beginning in May and lasting almost all year. A few of the May sightings were reported briefly in the New York Times (June 3, 1962) from a Reuters dispatch, but in a manner implying that the sightings lasted only one day. In general, U.S. news coverage of these sightings was practically nonexistent. Reuters apparently was the only news agency to report them at all outside of Argentina. Most major countries of the world for years have had either official or unofficial investigations of UFO sightings [Section X]. American servicemen overseas have contributed many reports. At 11:20 a.m. March 29, 1952, an Air Force pilot was flying a T-6 north of Misawa, Japan. It was a bright cloudless day. Lt. D. C. Brigham was in the T-6 target plane in a practice intercept mission, with a flight of two F-84's pursuing him. As the first F-84 overtook him at 6000 feet, Brigham noticed a flash of sunlight behind it and saw a small shiny disc-shaped object gaining on the interceptor. The UFO curved toward the F-84, decelerating rapidly to the Thunderjet's air speed (150 to 160 mph) and flipping up on edge in a 90 degree bank. Then it fluttered along close to the interceptor's fuselage (between the two aircraft) for 2 to 3 seconds, and pulled away around the starboard wing, flipping once, apparently as it hit the slipstream. Finally, the object passed the F-84, crossed in front, pulled up abruptly, accelerated, and shot out of sight in a near vertical climb. Lieutenant Brigham estimated that the UFO at its closest point was 30 to 50 feet away from his plane. It was round, shiny as polished chromium, and seemed to be about 8 inches in diameter. Throughout the observation, the disc rocked back and forth in 40 degree banks at about one-second intervals. [See Section XII, Flight Characteristics.] Lieutenant Brigham saw no exhaust or protrusions, but reported a ripple in the apparently metal skin around the edge of the disc. [10] Foreign pilots, scientists, and engineers also have observed UFOs many times. Around sunset June 30, 1954, south of Goose Bay, Labrador, a British Overseas Airways (BOAC) airliner was paced by a large \"parent\" object and about six satellite objects [See Section X, Foreign Reports]. Later that night (about 2:15 p.m. local time near Oslo, Norway), two UFOs operating in tandem were observed and filmed under especially favorable conditions. [11.] A solar eclipse was in progress, and three planes carrying scientists and technicians on a scientific ex- pedition were flying through the moon's shadow. About 50 people in the three aircraft saw two \"enormous\" silvery discs swoop down from some clouds 15 to 20 miles away (estimate based on fact UFOs were in sunlight). The objects sped along the horizon keeping an exact distance from each other, one slightly behind and above the other, both with forward edge tilted down. The observers detected apparent rotation, as the UFOs levelled off and disappeared into the distance after about 30 seconds. The chief cameraman of the expedition, John Bjornulf, managed to expose about 10 seconds of movie film which showed the UFOs. The films, released by Gaumont, a British firm, were shown on American television September 26, 1954. Still photographs of the UFOs have also been printed. Ernest Graham, one of the witnesses, stated that 50 persons afterwards wrote reports on what they had seen. [12] Another unexplainable disc was observed, tracked on radar, and chased by two U. S. Air Force jet pilots somewhere in the Far East. [13.] Approved For Release 2001/04/02 s CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 \"On December 1956 two USAF jet pilots were practicing ground radar positioned intercepts on each other in the vicinity of During one run, the report states, the intercepting pilot picked up a large unexplained radar blip; he estimated the UFO to be as large as a B-29 bomber. Radar showed it to be 20 miles away and 30 degrees to the left. . \"Pilot called the GCI [Ground Control Intercept] site to ask if they had a target which would correspond to the unidentified blip. After receiving an answer in the negative, he asked for and received permission to determine the nature of the source of the radar return.\" The pilot closed in at over 700 mph; at 8 miles range a round object became visible exactly where the radar showed it. The apparent size was very large. The pilot described it as \"the size of a lead pencil eraser if placed against the windscreen.\" [Using figures supplied by North American Aviation, the dia- meter of the UFO was computed to be about 350 feet.] [14.] The pilot got a radar \"lock-on\" (automatically guiding his plane toward the UFO). As he continued to close in, his radar was suddenly jammed by a strong interference. Using anti- jam procedure, the pilot switched frequency. For 10 seconds, this eliminated the mysterious interference pulses, thentheybegan again. But the pulsations were not strong enough to break the radar lock-on, and the jet held its course. \"The jet closed to within 5 nautical miles of the object and could not close further. When the pilot was closest to the uni- dentified object, it appeared to make a shallow left turn. It had the appearance of being circular on the bottom.\" The color of the UFO was described as a golden tan, with no reflection from the sun. After the UFO began turning, the pilot's radar indicated that the object was \"moving up and away at from 1,500 to 1,800 knots [1,700 to over 2,000 mph].\" The Air Force report states that this is an estimate, since the UFOs' rate of departure was faster than the jet's radar could track. The blip \"disappeared by moving rapidly off the top of the scope.\" The Intelligence Report shows that the jet and all of its equip- ment was immediately checked, and all systems were satisfactory. Under \"Comments of the interrogation officers,\" the Report states: \"The observing pilot, Lt. , had many flying hours as of the time of the incident. Over half had been logged in this type of jet. He appeared to be conscientious and reported the incident in a straightforward, slightly embarrassed manner, saying that he would doubt the possibility of such an occurrence if it hadn't actually happened to him. \"The fact that no unidentified tracks were observed by ground radar should not be given much weight in evaluating this report. Both the jet aircraft involved required IFF in order that the con- trolling GCI site could plot them.\" [??IFF\" is an identification code transmitter system developed in World War II called \"Identification, Friend or Foe.\" The fact that IFF signals were required for ground radar to plot the jets indicates that the Air Force planes otherwise would not have shown up on the ground radar.] The above sample cases contain examples of most of the recurring features of reported UFOs: V Reports from competent observers such as scientists and pilots. J Flight characteristics such as a disc wobbling on its axis. V Maneuver patterns such as hovering andterrific acceleration. '/Physical evidence such as radar trackings and electro- magnetic effects. Typically, the majority of reports describe disc-shaped or el- liptical objects. [See Section XII, Patterns, for additional de- tails.] COULDN'T THEY BE U.S. OR SOVIET SECRET DEVICES? When a person who has been a skeptic first becomes con- vinced that UFOs are, or might be, real, his usual first reaction is that they must be secret devices. While space activity in the past six years undoubtedly has caused some false UFO reports, the activity of secret test devices on the other hand would nec- essarily be confined to restricted test areas. The arguments against the secret device theory, then, are: a. Test devices of one nation would not be observed worldwide [see Section X, Worldwide UFO Reports]. b. If secret devices were operational in the scope necessary to account for UFO reports, the technology implied would cause all current jets and rockets to be completely outmoded. Yet, the direction of our research and experimentation does not reflect such a breakthrough. c. Perhaps most damaging to the secret device theory is the fact that UFOs apparently have been observed for a very long time [see Section XI, Chronology]. Soviet aerial technology through and after World War H was not impressive. German technology at the end of World War II was impressive, and this has caused advocates of this theory to attribute UFOs to captured German scientists and engineers working secretly for the U.S. or Russia. American technology was making rapid strides at the close of the war, but our hottest operational aerial devices were propeller-driven aircraft, and our few guided missiles were hardly out of the laboratory. However, NICAP examined this possibility thoroughly, con- sulting scientists and engineers (including Prof. Dr. Hermann Oberth, famous German rocket expert) and found not the slightest evidence to confirm the rumors of secret devices developed by former Nazi scientists. The antiquity of UFO sightings, especially, rules out the pos- sibility of any sort of test devices, secret or otherwise, account- ing for more than a handful of UFO reports. Explorer Nicholas Roerich, on an expedition in the Himalayan Mountains, August 5, 1926, and others in his caravan, saw a shiny oval-shaped object [15.] While watching a soaring eagle, they noticed the object far above moving south at high speed and observed it through binoculars. The UFO then made a turn to the southwest and moved out of sight in the distance. An early postwar observation by an unusually well-trained observer was reported to NICAP Board Member, the Rev. Albert Baller: [See photostat]. Rev. Albert Roller I+:uns on Street Greenfield, Mass. Dear Mr. Haller: Be: \"Flying Saucer\"eighting. The circumstances of the sighting of an unknown flying object by me were as follows:- It was I. May 1946, at my wife's family home, at La Grange, 4 miles north of Titusville, Florida, where I was spending my terminal leave as Lieutenant j.g. 5.5.N.R., having just returned from the Pacific and Far East. I had spent over a year aboard a destroyer escort as senior watch officer, gunnery officer and radar officer, and was very familiar, both in training and practice to ship and aircraft recognition, night and day under combat circumstances. I was picking oranges in the forenoon about 100 feet from the house, when a distinct wavering whistling noise of a fast moving body through air made me look up. flying from west to east at about 1000 feet elevation, Possibly less, at the speed of a light plane - say 125 m.p.h. It appeared dark against the bright cloud layer which had a ceiling of perhaps 1500 feet - there was no blue sky showing. The sight astonished me, as the only sound was its passage through the air. There was no sound of any engine, it had no wings or other appendages, no props, and no trail of smoke in back. It appeared about 15 or 20 feet long, perhaps less, and as I watched it owed smoothly in an are to the southeast and vanished forever in a lower cloud bank. My wife and the rest of the family heard this queer noise and all rushed out to see what it was, and my wife glimpsed it as it vanished in the clouds, confirming my story. I had never heard of flying saucers and had no Idea what e had s , but assumed that it was some secret device of the Air Force, A never reported It. It w not a MAD (magnetic airborn detector) used for anti- submarine work, as it w attached to no cable to a plane above, and there n e the noise of no other plane or blimp at the time that could have been hidden, say, in the clouds above. So that is the story of my \"Flying Football\", still as much a mystery today as it was to as 9 years ago.

In reference to human behavior, we usually use the word to mean the application of logic and reason to understand nature or solve human problems. However, we observe \"intelligence\" by observing the behavior of people as they go about their affairs. We infer that they are intelligent or un- intelligent by noticing their apparent awareness of their environ- ment, and how they cope with problems in their environment. We note their behavior as individuals, and in groups. The ability of people to act in concert to accomplish mutual goals generally is considered to be intelligent activity. In regard to the question of whether aerial devices are intel- ligently controlled, how is intelligence indicated by the perfor- mance of aircraft? If we did not know that the airliners and military jets we see coursing through the sky were guided by pi- lots, how would their actions lead us to suspect this? First, we might observe some jets rendezvousing, joining formation, then proceeding to act in concert. Then we might see a jet depart from its course and circle a balloon, apparently curious about it, before continuing on its way. Finally, we might notice indications (smoke trails, mechanical parts, high performance, etc.) which suggest to us that these are powered mechanical objects. This would imply intelligent construction and guidance. UFOs have shown all of these features: V Inquisitiveness, and reaction to environment. \\/ Powered flight. \\ /Formations in coordinated flight. Reasoning by analogy to human devices and intelligence, the hypothesis that UFOs are intelligently operated is explored below. Caution is required in using this method of reasoning, because it is conceivable that actions which we normally associate with intelligence may not seem so to alien beings, and vice versa. However, there is a good chance that there would be an overlap of \"intelligent behavior\" between human and alien beings. In particular, we should expect any intelligent beings to be fun- damentally curious about things in their environment. Curiosity underlies the acquisition of useful knowledge, which is necessary to intelligence. In addition to the evidence advanced in this section, other sections contain data showing (a) that UFOs show repeating pat- terns suggesting a unique and unexplained phenomenon [Section XII], (b) that the observed objects and patterns have no counter- parts among atmospheric phenomena which could account for them in terms of known events [Section XII: Maneuvers and Flight Characteristics], and (c) that the hypothesis of intelligently op- erated devices is reasonable, and adequate to explain the data. Inquisitiveness and Reaction to Environment In case after case, UFOs singly or in formation have paced or followed automobiles, trains, airplanes, and rockets. Often the UFOs have circled the device and taken \"evasive action\" when pursued. A Monon Railroad freight train was proceeding through Clinton County, Central Indiana, October 3, 1958. About 3:10 a.m. a formation of four odd white lights crossed ahead of the train. The UFOs turned and traversed the full length of the train, front to back (about a half mile) observed by the entire crew. After passing the rear of the train, the objects swung east, 1 d the conductor shone a bright light on them. Immediately, the UFOs sped away, but returned quickly and continued to pace the train. Total time of observation: about 1 hour 10 minutes. Finally the UFOs moved away to the northeast and disappeared. The coordinated maneuvers in formation, reaction to a bright beam of light, and pacing of the train, all suggest some form of intelligence. [1] Similar cases of vehicles being paced by UFOs also have been reported by experienced observers such as pilots and missile trackers. At White Sands, New Mexico, June 10, 1949, a missile had just been launched when two circular UFOs appeared. As the missile accelerated to about 1,430 mph, the UFOs climbed after it, passed through its exhaust, passed the missile and climbed out of sight. Five separate observation and tracking posts, scattered around the nearby mountains and not in communi- cation with one another, reported observing this performance. One of the posts tracked a similar UFO several minutes later, as it sped west against the wind. [2] Inquisitiveness and Reaction Fifty sample cases in which UFOs displayed apparent awareness of their environment, charted here, are divided into two basic types: (a) UFOs which paced vehicles or otherwise appeared to be inquisitive about human devices; (b) UFOs which evaded or otherwise reacted to human devices. (All reports on file at NICAP.) turned back and followed the train. The bright glow concea e the exact shape of the UFOs, but they appeared flattened and some- times flew on edge. Operating part of the time in-line abreast with coordinated motions, the objects followed the train until Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : (!IA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 Approved For Release 2001/04/02 : CIA-RDP81 R00560R0001 00010001 -0 INQUISITIVENESS AND REACTION CASES Date & Location Reported Shape or Appearance Witnesses (b) 7-23-48 near Montgomery, Ala.

The observations sometimes have included visual signs of mechanical-functional construction, in addition to other indicators of the UFOs' being, literally, machines. Most of the cases cited previously in this section contain descriptions of observed \"maneuvers.\" However, the following group of reports by unusually well-qualified observers is worth special mention. UFO Formation Tracked Above Security Area at over 4,500 mph. During the Fall of 1949 at a key atomic post, five apparently metallic objects in formation were tracked by radar. The UFOs crossed the 200-mile scope in less than 4 minutes. The officer in charge, who held a top military post, reported to Intelligence that this was a legitimate radar contact with unidentified objects. [4] (Official secrecy conceals other details of this case, in particular information on tracking and other detection of the UFOs by separate military posts. Nevertheless, it tends to sub- stantiate the many other reports by reputable people of UFOs, and UFO formations, moving at spectacular speeds). Technicians at Secret Test Base Observe Mechanical UFO At Muroc AFB (now Edwards AFB) and adjacent Rogers Dry Lake, scientists and engineers test and develop the latest aircraft, including secret projects. Although thoroughly familiar with anything that flies, the base technical personnel had no explanation for the UFOs which maneuvered over the area July 8, 1947. Twice that morning, disc-shaped objects were observed cavorting overhead. Then about 11:50 a.m., a crew of technicians at Rogers saw a round white, apparently metallic object descending, moving west northwest against the wind. They observedthick projections on top which crossed each other at intervals, suggesting either rotation or slow oscillation. In their official report they stated: \"It was man-made, as evidenced by the outline and functional appearance.\" [5] (Next day, near Boise, Idaho, a disc-shaped object maneuvering in front of a cloud bank was observed from a plane by Dave Johnson, aviation editor of the Idaho Statesman. See Section VII.) Top Astronomer Reports \"Novel Airborne Device\" On July 10, 1947, one of the country's top astronomers re- ported an elliptical UFO. At 4:47 p.m. in southern New Mexico, the astronomer observed a smooth ellipse with firm regular outline, motionless near some clouds, but wobbling. [See Section XII; Flight Characteristics.] The UFO then moved into the clouds, reappeared and rose quickly at an estimated speed of 600 to 900 mph. In his report to the Air Force, the astronomer stated: \"The remarkably sudden ascent convinced me it was an absolutely novel airborne device.\" [4] Scientist Observes Powered UFO A very similar observation was made nearly three years later by an eminent meteorologist and astronomer. On the grounds of Lowell Observatory, Arizona, May 20, 1950, Dr. Seymour L. Hess, now head of the Department of Meteorology, Florida State University, noticed a disc (or partly illuminated sphere) moving across the front of some cumulus clouds at about 12:15 p.m. Studying the UFO with four-power binoculars, Doctor Hess could see no evidence of exhaust or markings on the object. \"The clouds were drifting from the southwest to the northeast at right angles to the motion of the object. Therefore it must have been powered in some way. . . I would estimate its speed at 100 mph., perhaps as high as 200 mph. This too means a power- ed craft. However, I could hear no engine noise.\" [Full state- ment, Section I.] High-Speed Disc Arcs Above Airliner Airline pilots, although not necessarily technically trained in the sense of being scientists or engineers, are experienced ob- servers of the sky, familiar with most atmospheric and astrono- mical displays. At 9:29 p.m., March 31, 1950, a Chicago & Southern Airlines plane was flying at2,000feeton a southwesterly course near Little Rock, Arkansas. Captain Jack Adams and Co-pilot G. W. Anderson, Jr., suddenly noticed a distinct circular object, apparently disc-shaped approaching from the left. The UFO passed in an arc above their plane, proceeding north at an estimated 700 to 1,000 mph. Eight to 10 lighted windows or ports were visible on the underside, and \"the strongest blue-white light we've ever seen\" flashed intermittently from the top. The pilots told official investigators they believed they had witnessed some secret experimental craft. To this date, the sighting remains unexplained. [6] Aeronautical Engineer Amazed by UFO Performance Another particularly well-qualified observer was \"amazed\" by a UFO performance he witnessed on the night of July 16, 1952. Paul R. Hill, an aeronautical research engineer of Hampton, Virginia, at 9:00 p.m. saw two amber-colored lights speed in from the south over the Hampton Roads channel. The UFOs slowed and circled rapidly around each other. Two similar ob- jects then approached and joined the first two, one from the south and one from the north, and the formation moved off toward the south. \"Their ability to make tight circling turns was amazing,\" Mr. Hill said. [Full report in Section VI.] Formations and Coordinated Flight A prime indicator of intelligence behind the maneuvers of UFOs is the observation that they often fly in formation, which requires coordination and mechanical control. (Aircraft and birds also fly in formations, but these can often be ruled out as cause of the sightings.) In UFO reports, the formations are of three general types: (a) Geometrical (V's, lines, etc.); (b) clusters, and (c) object with smaller objects maneuvering around it. (a) Geometrical 1904: Circular UFOs Maneuvered Near Ship One of the earliest formation cases was reported February 28, 1904, by a ship in the North Pacific off San Francisco. Three members of the crew of the USS Supply, at 6:10 a.m. local time, sighted an echelon formation of three \"remarkable meteors\" which appeared near the horizon below clouds, moving directly toward the ship. As they approached, the UFOs began soaring, rose above the cloud layer, and were observed climbing into space, still in echelon. The lead object was egg-shaped and about the size of six suns (about 3 degrees of arc). The other two were smaller and appeared to be perfectly round. They remained visible for over two minutes. [7] (Meteors, of course, do not travel in echelon formation, change course and climb, nor re- main visible for two minutes). Precise Formation, Sharp Turn Near Airliner Perhaps the most detailed and instructive formation case on record is the sighting by Capt. William B. Nash, Pan American Airways pilot, and his co-pilot, William Fortenberry, July 14, 1952, near Newport News, Virginia. [See Section V.] In addi- tion to being an example of precise formation flight, the report contains several other elements suggesting intelligent control. When an in-line formation of discs made an abrupt stop, two of the rear objects overrode the front one. This could be interpreted as a sign of pilot error or lag in reaction time. After the six discs flipped over and reversed course, two more sped up and joined the formation.
