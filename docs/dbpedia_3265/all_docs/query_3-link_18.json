        "text": "With “The Matrix” (1999), the Wachowskis made their mark in Hollywood by building a complex and intricate science-fiction universe that operated on its own terms. Their latest film, “Jupiter Ascending,” due Feb. 6, is a return to that kind of world-building, an adventure film with political undertones and a distinct visual style.\n\nThe film follows Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis), a housecleaner who might also be the protector and savior of the planet. The film’s locations alternate among Earth, Jupiter and other areas of the cosmos. In generating the various elements of the look, Lana and Andy Wachowski drafted many sketches and gathered significant amounts of reference material.\n\nThe image from the film shown here takes place on Jupiter, with Balem (Eddie Redmayne), the villainous head of Abrasax Industries who has nefarious plans for the inhabitants of Earth, arriving at a refinery that serves as his home base. Following is an explanation of some of the scene’s visual ideas, with commentary from the Wachowskis.\n\nEffortless Commuting\n\nBalem arrives at the refinery in a floating chariot. “We liked the idea of Balem not liking to walk, and so he floats everywhere,” Ms. Wachowski said. “His life is so effortless that he doesn’t have to dirty himself with the business of putting his feet on the ground very often.” The filmmakers tried to imagine the kind of hierarchy that would flow from this society, and they came up with something that combined bureaucrats with aristocrats. Also, genetic splicing is a fact of life for some of the characters who inhabit the film’s world. Here, Balem is greeted by his part-rat lawyer Chicanery Night (Edward Hogg). Other characters are part owl, part winged dinosaur or, like the character Caine played by Channing Tatum, part wolf."
