        "text": "What’s the name of the show? Sense8\n\nWhen does it premiere? All 12 episodes begin streaming on Netflix on 5 June.\n\nWhat’s the show’s pedigree? Andy and Lana Wachowski, the siblings behind the Matrix movies as well as Speed Racer, Cloud Atlas, and the recent bomb Jupiter Ascending, created the show along with Babylon 5 creator J Michael Straczynski. The trio wrote the episodes and the Wachowskis directed much of the action. However, it was filmed in eight cities in seven different countries, so they had some assistants in far away places.\n\nOh God, not the Wachowskis. They’re like the second coming of M Night Shaymalan. Don’t diss the Wachowskis. They changed the way action movies are made with The Matrix and their last two movies, Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending, showed that they are going to be perfect for television.\n\nSeriously? Yes. Cloud Atlas is an intricate and interlocking story that spans both time and place, yet still maintains emotional and thematic cohesion. Granted they were working with someone else’s source material, but the film was engaging throughout, even if some viewers found it confusing. Jupiter Ascending was pretty bad, but it was entertaining, creating an entirely fictional universe with sumptuous visuals, detailed mythology, and whatever it was Channing Tatum was mumbling about. Any failure of either of these movies (other than Eddie Redmayne chewing scenery like it was an all-you-can-eat buffet) can be blamed on the scale being too big for the movies. Now they have the expanse of television to play with.\n\nWhat is this show? After a traumatic event, eight people in cities across the globe find out that they are emotionally and telepathically connected. They can see each other’s thoughts, use each other’s skills, and feel each other’s pain.\n\nSo, who are these eight people? There is Will (Brian J Smith), a Chicago cop who used to be a hoodlum; Riley (Tuppence Middleton), an Icelandic DJ who lives in London; Sun (Bae Doona from Cloud Atlas), a rich Korean businesswoman and kickboxing champion; Lito (Miguel Angel Silvestre), a closeted Spanish actor who is the Tom Cruise of Mexico; Capheus (Aml Ameen), who drives a Jean-Claude Van Damme-themed bus in Kenya; Kala (Tina Desai), a Mumbai scientist who is about to marry her rich boss; Wolfgang (Max Reirnelt), a German safe-cracker; and Nomi (Jamie Clayton), a trans blogger and hacktivist living in San Francisco.\n\nWhat happens in the premiere? On a seedy mattress in a bombed-out church in Chicago, a mysterious woman named Angel (a better-than-ever Daryl Hannah) gives birth to the sensates before killing herself, aided by her equally mysterious lover (Lost’s Naveen Andrews). As we meet the eight linked people she produced, they all start to experience visions of the woman, as well as hearing and seeing things their connected brethren are experiencing. Little by little, we learn each of their stories.\n\nDoes that get a little crowded? Yes, it does. Couldn’t this be Sense5 or something? That would be a whole lot more manageable. But just like Game of Thrones, some characters disappear for almost an entire episode or only make small appearances while we focus on other characters.\n\nIs this show any good? The show is approaching good. It immediately throws the audience into this strange world, where Angel is telepathically speaking to two men with some urgency. We know that something important is going on, but we don’t have enough information or even enough time to get our bearings yet. It’s a real red pill or blue pill kind of moment, and it’s awesome. Sadly, the rest of the first episode is a slog. The scale of this show is grand in every way, and when it is boring, it is epically boring.\n\nThe problem is that the Wachowskis are great at creating new worlds, eye-popping visuals and full-throttle action sequence. Nuanced characters and small personal moments are not their strong suit, but they’re the substance of the entire first episode, as we meet each of the eight characters.\n\nAlas, the stories are dreadfully sincere and painfully literal. We learn that Wolfgang didn’t like his father when he literally pisses on his grave. We know that Nomi and her girlfriend are really into Gay Pride because they’re having sex with a rainbow-colored dildo. Yes, it’s that kind of show.\n\nSense8 reminds me of Lost in that it concerns itself with a central mystery and magical powers, and also its collection of characters from all walks of life. On Lost we got to learn about each character one episode at a time. Here, the Wachowskis try to jam nearly everyone into each episode – and Sense8’s characters aren’t nearly as interesting as those on Lost. What we really want to see is them skipping across the globe and figuring out their powers, but it’s a little slow getting there.\n\nHowever, by the end of the third episode, which concludes with one of the best and most original fight scenes I’ve ever seen, the show is in rare form. The characters are begrudgingly starting to grow on you and how they’re going to come together is starting to make more sense. Hopefully, with the characters’ origin stories out of the way, we can focus more on the action and less on the impossibly stiff dialogue.\n\nUltimately the show may be too big for its britches. With the globe-trotting storytelling, Sense8 could easily be about the new world we live in and how each human is connected, but it’s too clumsy to do that in any nuanced or original way. Sure, there are some story motifs uniting the characters – drugs, distant fathers, displacement, scepticism of authority – but they seem more like quirks than actual character traits.\n\nWhich characters will you love? So far my favorite is Sun, mostly because she kicks ass and is a little crazy. With trans culture having a huge moment right now, Nomi is a standout and the character is facing very topical adversity, but Clayton’s performance is a shade too wooden to really bring her alive.\n\nWhich characters will you hate? After three episodes, we barely know anything about Kala or Wolfgang. Their struggles — facing a loveless marriage and having some daddy issues – are boring.\n\nWhat’s the best thing about it? The Matrix revolutionised the way filmmakers use digital effects in movies but there aren’t many of those on display here. The camera never stops moving, but the tricky effects of displacing the characters is done by showing the wrong people in certain contexts. We think we’re going to see Will chase down a suspect and instead it’s Riley chugging through the streets of Chicago. It’s a great trick and one that is as displacing and startling as Neo bending over backwards as bullets fly past him at low speeds.\n\nWhat’s the worst thing about it? It doesn’t make sense that everyone is speaking English. If Lito is filming a Mexican movie, why is their dialogue not in Spanish? Yes, it’s easier not to have subtitles, but it takes the viewer out of the world with a thud. It would have been worth it to have all the actors speaking their native languages."
