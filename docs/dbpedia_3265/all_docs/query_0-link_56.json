        "text": "Some of the other items obtained from between 2007 and 2022 whilst I tracked the production through Chicagos filming locations.\n\nLiving in the town where the Dark Knight and man of steel were both filmed has meant many opportunities to find various items including both production made, used and Screenused.\n\nYou can find articles on Man of Steel here and here amongst others.\n\nHere are just a few of those pieces some of which have moved onto new homes. Below various paperwork pieces including costume continuity photos of the Jokers costume and Harvey Dent, callsheets and maps of the Chicagoland area and a Screenused police uniform jumper with plastic police badge. You can find the article on the production cowl here. The yellow and black bat suit emblem was sent from the UK to a crew member in Chicago from a cast member he met on the first film “Batman Begins” who then went on to work in the costume department from “Dark Knight”. He had worked on “Batman Returns” many years prior where at one point the colors were switched before changing back to black for the emblem.\n\nOther items included prototype bank heist masks, newspapers, money, signage from buildings, license plates both cardboard and vacuforned.\n\nUnused fabric costume swatches from the wardrobe department were also found which Propabilia is now selling on eBay in a beautiful custom frame shown below.\n\nOne of the very best items was this beautiful production gauntlet and glove originally sold on eBay. Truly all superb pieces.\n\nThat doesn’t even include items from the film shot in Chicago in 2004, “Batman begins”. Watch for an upcoming article on that.\n\nAs for “The Dark Knight rises” that moved to Pittsburgh where Propabillia got some truly incredible footage…see that below.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/je79A8InIZ8?si=qx06_zuvQT2ubRu3\n\nA slightly longer version of my letter posted across the web…my thanks to you all.\n\nThe Propstop was created originally to allow me to retain the history of my collecting. As much as I enjoyed posting on various forums in the late 90/early 2000s I would often find information would be deleted or threads derailed. Something similar has happened to Facebook groups as gatekeepers have sought to retain their “customers” or limit talk on some subjects. By creating a WordPress site and then sharing some of that content to Facebook I was able to Create my little corner of the internet.\n\nNo collection is forever. We all sell things eventually and yet I always found that was the least favorite part of my journey. During my years in the hobby, since 1988 in fact, I have created hundreds of sales to many satisfied customers. I’ve enjoyed those transactions with every single customer, but my first love has always been locating these incredible pieces. The pieces I have let go have enabled me to go on and find more. I am thrilled when I see my old items in museums, private collections or for sale in auction. It is part of the circle of life. We are all curators. Protectors of these treasures. Keepers of history.\n\nSince 2011 I have resisted, turning thepropstop.wordpress.com into a sales site but now as prices continue to rise in our hobby and after many conversations with you, my fellow collectors, I’ve come to realize that folks all over the world miss buying pieces like the old days as more of these items are going to specialist auctions. The need to click and buy now at the price offered is something I think deserves to remain on prop websites.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I have a future as I’ve had in the past with these auction events and I will continue to support them with my items since some pieces are too good not to sell in that fashion. I have had great experiences with many companies out there who have made selling thru them fun and exciting. But people miss the thrill of logging in and seeing new items to grab then and there and not think “this wasn’t good enough for the online auction”. I miss that experience too.\n\nThe Propstop WordPress site will continue but remain a place for news, my thoughts and the history of our hobby whilst also allowing me occasionally to talk more in depth about specific pieces that are for sale without limiting myself to a format. Excitingly it means down the road video descriptions, long form research or even just talking about a prop for sale live on the site giving backstory and commentary.\n\nThe Propstopstore however is evocative of the old times of buying props & wardrobe with the click of a button with what I jokingly once said “includes a hint of Gamestop”, perhaps due to the color scheme.\n\nI want to thank the Wizard of Oz, Craig Champion from the HSPPA who has fashioned not only a beautiful site, but also held my hand in the whole creation of his “monster” His drive pushed this rock up hill. I am grateful for all your hard work Sir.\n\nThere are so many other wonderful contributors who have helped on my journey. Just a few include Kevin Hermann from “Collectors call”, James Azrael from the HSPPA, Ian Newson from the UK who was my first real friend growing up, Steve B. from the UK, Martin Y., Garrett Zima, Sean Clark, The Kaminky family at vipfanauctions, The Propgallery crew, David Oliver, Jason DeBord, Stephen Lane, Tim Lawes from Propstore…the list goes on and on. If I keep going this paragraph would take hours. Just know all you guys who I talk to out there are just amazing collectors, friends and collaborators. Daniel my brother….I’m so glad I inspired you to follow me into this world. You are fantastic. So is your family. My loves Allison and Stubbs you are everything. Always supportive and maybe not understanding why or how this all works…but my rock. My mother and father. All my love for my passion you supported always.\n\nTo all my family, friends, customers both past and future, our viewers on Collectors Call and all those I’ve worked with in the industry to save the magic of entertainment history, thank you for allowing me to fill my life with my passion. To our thousands of readers and followers on social media thank you for your kind words. You enjoy the work. I am proud to hear that. More than you could ever know.\n\nIt is my honor to present to you propstopstore.com\n\nNow who will be the owner of COA number #1?"
