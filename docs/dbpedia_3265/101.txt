It was a busy Saturday night in Chicago. Setup for this scene of Jupiter Ascending began around 7:30am and did not wrap until about 9:30pm. The scene shows a few cars and a garbage truck meeting in the middle of the Lake Street bridge. The pyro effects actually shot up through the L tracks above the street. From what we could see there were several cameras pointed at the scene as it unfolded, but it seemed that the main camera shot was from the blue lift on the barge in the middle of the river. We watched them rehearse the scene several times before the pyro was installed. Once the pyro was installed it was one and done. Rumor has it that Mila Kunis and Channing Tatum were on the barge, but we never saw them with our cameras. We're looking forward to trying to capture more behind the scenes photos and video. NOTE: This video was the product a few hours of anticipation. Hence the excitement!
