        "text": "While in Spain to film the Chicago Mafia story Die Wahrheit über Frank Mannata (1969), he was injured in an on-set explosion, suffering facial lacerations from broken glass and powder burns. Later an old friend, a former British commando, accidentally hit him on the chin with a karate chop when Hunter, who knew judo, failed to defend himself in time, banging the back of his head against a door. Then, while on the plane with his wife returning to the United States, Hunter's right arm suddenly became semi-paralyzed and he lost the power of speech, two signs of a stroke. He was taken directly off the plane upon landing, to a hospital in Los Angeles. He recovered and was released after a couple of weeks. Shortly after signing to co-star with Vince Edwards in The Desperados (1969), Hunter suffered another cerebral hemorrhage while on a short flight of steps in his living room, and collapsed, injuring his head in the fall. It was not known how long he had been unconscious when he was finally found. He died without regaining consciousness, the following day after surgery to repair the skull fracture, at age 42.\n\nIn a radio interview in Palm Springs, California on November 7, 2005, Laurel Goodwin, his co-star in the original Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) pilot, revealed that his wife at the time, Joan Bartlett, demanded that he get more money to continue performing in the lead role when the pilot was picked up as a regular series. After long negotiations the producers, feeling great pressure, decided to simply recast Hunter for a new actor and character, Captain James T. Kirk, played by William Shatner. The crew was also recast to bring different ethnic backgrounds to the cast to show how they co-existed peacefully in the future.\n\nCast as Christopher Pike, captain of the USS Enterprise, in the original Raumschiff Enterprise (1966) pilot in 1964. However, when an undecided NBC requested a second pilot in early 1965, Hunter declined, having decided to concentrate on his movie career, instead. After hearing the news, producer Gene Roddenberry wrote to Hunter, \"I am told you have decided not to go ahead with 'Star Trek'. This has to be your own decision, of course, and I must respect it\", and then asked Hunter if he would come back for \"one day or two of shooting an additional action opening which can result in a fast, tightly cut, exciting film release\". Hunter, who had a six-month exclusive contract for the series lead, also declined that request. Footage from the first pilot was later incorporated into a two-part episode titled \"The Menagerie\" in Star Trek's first season (Roddenberry later tried to give the impression that it was he who decided not to rehire Hunter for the second pilot. However, as executive producer Herbert F. Solow pointed out, major casting decisions for the series were made by Desilu and NBC executives, not the producer). It wasn't until 1988 that it was screened intact as a filler episode entitled \"The Cage\" on Raumschiff Enterprise: Das nächste Jahrhundert (1987) due to a writer's strike."
