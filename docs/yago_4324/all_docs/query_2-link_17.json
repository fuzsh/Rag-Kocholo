The scouts already have offered substantial insight into the field of impact investing through their blogs, and we expect even more as they wrap up and reflect on their experiences. Their blogs can be found at: 2012 Scouts in the Field.\n\nFor more information on the Frontier Market Scouts Program, a joint venture of the Monterey Institute of International Studies, Sanghata Global, and Village Capital, please visit the FMS Site.\n\nThe Frontier Market Scouts Program is sending its largest group ever of scouts into the field to locations such as Colombia, Brazil, India, Kenya, South Africa, and more! The scouts just completed their training program last week, with 29 taking part in training and 21 of them going onto field assignments.\n\nThis group’s scouts come from very diverse backgrounds: recent college graduates from places such as Kenyon College and Davidson College, graduate students, MBAs, PhDs, and JDs from institutions such as University of Michigan, Bard College, and Syracuse University, Yale, and Columbia University, and mid-career professionals seeking to become involved in the continually growing field of impact investing.\n\nFor this round of the program, we are sending scouts to 15 different in-country partners, such as Invested Development, Growth Africa, the Hub Istanbul and, the Hub Bogota, to name a few. Our scouts will be located in Central and South America, Africa, Europe, and Asia, working to apply the wealth of new knowledge they have gained through the FMS training.\n\nThe goal of the scouts is to enable the enterprising poor to scale poverty alleviation in capital-weak areas of emerging markets, while gaining career defining and life changing experiences. Keep up-to-date with the work the scouts are doing through the FMS blog, which will be updated with their blog posts throughout their assignments. More information on the FMS program can be found at: http://www.miis.edu/academics/short/frontier-market-scouts. Of course, this program would not be possible without our partners, Village Capital and Sanghata Global.\n\nStay up to date with the scouts while they are in the field!
