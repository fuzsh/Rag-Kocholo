This program is designed to help patients regain and maintain quality of life throughout the progression of Parkinson’s. Our clinicians are certified in a variety of evidence based Parkinson’s specific therapy programs.\n\nPhysical Therapy\n\nOur Physical Therapy (PT) teams utilize LSVT BIG® to increase movement from head to toe to improve walking, balance and other activities of daily living. This program drives high-intensity with high-effort practice to help teach patients how to recognize that movements with increased amplitude are actually within normal range of motion.\n\nOccupational Therapy\n\nOur Occupational Therapy (OT) teams provide the PWR!Moves® and LSVT BIG® programs. Occupational therapy is used to help patients continue with their daily tasks as their disease progresses. Daily tasks include engaging in activities the patient wants to, needs to, or is expected to do. Our therapists may assess the patients mobility, fall prevention, sit-to-stand transfers, bed mobility, posture and seating, eating and drinking, self-care routines, fatigue management, domestic skills (meal preparation, housework, shopping, etc.), as well as handwriting. OTs also offer support to changes in relationship dynamics to promote normal, daily routines for Parkinson's patients.\n\nSpeech-Language Pathology\n\nOur Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) are certified in SPEAK OUT!®. This program places emphasis on speaking with intent and converting speech from an automatic function to an intentional act. By working through a series of speech, voice, and cognitive exercises with the goal of increasing vocal volume and strengthening the muscles used for speaking and swallowing, our SLP’s help Parkinson's patients regain and maintain effective communication.\n\nForever Maintenance Program\n\nUpon completion of this two-part, 8-week program, our patients are invited to participate in weekly group sessions led by our certified clinicians. The exercises are performed and group members provide support, encouragement, and accountability to one another.\n\nAlong with daily home practice and a recommended evaluation every 6 months, our program has been shown to help patients maintain their independence, mobility, swallowing, and communication skills throughout the progression of their Parkinson’s Disease.\n\nFor more information about our Parkinson’s therapy program, please call 727.3601."
