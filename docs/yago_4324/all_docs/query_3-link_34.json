        "text": "Awarded to a graduating senior demonstrating leadership and a commitment to inclusivity in the student performing arts tech community.\n\nThe Möller Fresnel Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Performing Arts Technical Community was created in 2022 as a yearly award to highlight and elevate the contributions of a technician in the senior class, within the Performing Arts at Penn. The award is given to an individual who selflessly supports, builds, and elevates the tech community. This individual is not someone who seeks the spotlight, but instead, seeks to support those in the spotlight.\n\nThe award is handcrafted by the PAC Shop, and utilizes a Fresnel lens that was saved by former Technical Advisor, Peter Whinnery, during a renovation of Irvine Auditorium. In 2023, it was renamed the Möller Fresnel Award to honor the 17 years of dedication to the shop by former shop supervisor, Michelle Möller.\n\nDuring Penn’s first hybrid semester in the spring of 2021, the Senior Spotlight Awards originated to celebrate a graduating class who weathered difficult transitions in their academic and extracurricular life, yet continued to find joy and connection through virtual, socially distanced, and outdoor re-imaginings of their performing arts communities. While the challenges in student life continue to shift year by year, Senior Spotlights remain a powerful way for students to shine light on their graduating peers who have been mentors and inspirations throughout their creative journey."
