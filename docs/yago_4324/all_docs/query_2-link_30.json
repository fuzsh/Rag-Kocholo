McLaughlin at Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nHe came to Winnipeg in 1902 and established the grain brokerage firm of McLaughlin & Ellis in partnership with his brother and Allan Boyd Ellis, and later the McLaughlin Elevator Company. The latter owned and operated 25 grain elevators in Manitoba and another 20 elevators in the United States as the American Grain Company, in which he was Assistant Secretary. A member of the Winnipeg Grain Exchange from 1903 to 1928, he sold his interest in McLaughlin Elevators in 1928 to Federal Grain. The following year he established the Winnipeg-based firm Western Gypsum Products Limited, serving as its President until his death.\n\nOn 6 June 1906, he married Eunice Emily Andrews (1884-1978), daughter of George Albert Andrews. They had five children: Alfred F. McLaughlin (1908-?), Daniel John “Jack” McLaughlin (1909-?), Thomas Avery C. “Tom” McLaughlin (1912-?), Ann McLaughlin Paquet (c1915-1937), and Jean McLaughlin (1924-2009, wife of John Woodrowe Paul). The family lived at 105 Academy Road, Winnipeg. He was a member of the Elks, Manitoba Club, Winnipeg Winter Club, Lake of the Woods Yacht Club, St. Charles Country Club, and St. George’s Anglican Church.\n\nHe died while visiting Toronto, Ontario on 19 April 1949.\n\nSee also:\n\nManitoba Business: McLaughlin & Ellis\n\nManitoba Business: McLaughlin Elevator Company\n\nSources:\n\nBirth and marriage registrations, Manitoba Vital Statistics.\n\nA History of Manitoba: Its Resources and People by Prof. George Bryce, Toronto: The Canadian History Company, 1906.\n\n1911 Canada census, Automated Genealogy.\n\n“Mrs. Ann Paquet dies at Victoria,” Winnipeg Free Press , 28 January 1937, page 8.\n\n“H.
