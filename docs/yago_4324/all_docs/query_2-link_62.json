        "text": "NEW YORKERS have a talent for breathing new life into objects left on curbs or stoops. One person’s castoff is another person’s coffee table. A pile of books that somebody leaves for the garbage truck can become somebody else’s library.\n\nElizabeth Cronise was thinking something along these lines when, in August 2008, she spotted a leather bracelet in her bicycle basket. How it got there remains a mystery, but pondering its meaning seemed more intriguing than finding its owner.\n\nOn the bracelet was a metal plate with three Latin words: Nemo Nisi Mors. (More on that in a bit.)\n\n“I believe in fate,” Ms. Cronise said. “I felt it was a sign from the universe that I needed to pay attention.” (She did not know then that it was actually a sign from the designer Marc Jacobs, who has a line of these bracelets and a store on nearby Bleecker Street.) The bike had recently come into her life thanks to Joe McLaughlin, a bartender and actor. The basket she had just installed before leaving the bike outside her building in Greenwich Village.\n\nMs. Cronise, now 38, an associate at the Manhattan law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, met Mr. McLaughlin, now 36, in January 2008 when she went to Cafe Cluny on West 12th Street with a friend who knew the chef. Mr. McLaughlin was behind the bar. She decided she liked him right away, and didn’t waste time saying so. “I think you should take my phone number,” she announced.\n\n“He has this sweet disposition that you don’t normally find in restaurant workers,” she said later. “Or in actors.”\n\nMr. McLaughlin couldn’t deny the charms of this pretty new customer. “She was a breath of fresh air,” he said. “She had a positive outlook on things. And as a bartender, you tend to hear a lot of people complaining.”\n\nHe lived on West 11th Street. She did, too. This would have been kismet  had he not already been seeing someone.\n\nMs. Cronise, who grew up in New Hope, Pa., did not give up. Maybe they could not date, but she could hang out with him at the cafe.\n\n“It felt like home,” she said. “It became really easy to sit down at his bar after a hard day’s work and have a lovely conversation. I knew there was some reason that we needed to be in each other’s lives.”\n\nBy spring his relationship was over, and Ms. Cronise became more than a customer.\n\nIn early summer, he joined her at her yoga class. It seemed promising when they escalated to a brunch date. But just days later he told her he was going off to play Cornwall in a production of “King Lear” at a theater in his native Seattle. He also said he was probably going to stay there to help his mother see her chauffeured car service through rough times.\n\nMs. Cronise was left with the bike.\n\n“There he was, single, and then he was gone,” she said. Her friends accused her of being hung up on him. When his name popped up on her caller ID a month later, she did not pick up. She said she thought, “O.K., I have to get past this thing and get on with my life now.”\n\nYet his name kept appearing on her cellphone. He said he had wanted some distance from relationships after his most recent breakup, “but Elizabeth was always on my mind.”\n\nWhen Ms. Cronise finally picked up the phone, she started the conversation with: “You had your chance with me, buster.”\n\nYet things quickly returned to the way they had been on those nights in the bar. “He is so funny and charming, and I ended up staying on the phone for hours,” she said. In October, she agreed to fly to Seattle to visit. They spoke about past relationships and their plans while hiking in Discovery Park. Several candle-lit evenings later, she flew back to New York. Not long afterward, they decided to spend New Year’s in Bali.\n\nBy March, he had moved back to New York  this time they shared an apartment and not just a street.\n\nOne September day when she was home sick, he sang a proposal with his ukulele: “I want to annoy you for the rest of my life, please, won’t you be my wife?”\n\n\"I don’t necessarily think there’s the whole ‘When you know, you know,’ thing,” he said. “But I believe that you learn what’s right for you and what is not right. Your ability to navigate that gets better.”\n\nBy then, she had no doubt. “I had believed for a long time that I would never get married,” she said. “I had dated for so long and just had this sense that I didn’t want to settle for less than I knew was right, even if that meant gambling on not finding it. The advantage to that is that when the right thing came along, I knew.”\n\nRemember the bracelet? Ms. Cronise had translated the message on it soon after she found it: “No one but death (will separate us).”\n\n“It wasn’t until long afterward that I realized another way of saying that is, ‘Till death do us part,’ ” she said.\n\n“Until he moved in, the bracelet had been on an empty hook by the door,” she said, pausing. “It was there waiting for him.”"
