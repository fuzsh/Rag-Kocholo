Bob was born in Medford, MA, the son of the late Henry and Catherine McLaughlin. He grew up in Medford and was a graduate of Medford High School. As a youth, he was always out with friends on the ball fields, swimming in lakes, and skating in the rinks and ponds. Growing up he spent Summers on the shores of Lake Winnipesaukee in Alton Bay, NH. He served in the Army during the Korean War. He held the rank of Corporal and was the recipient of the Korean Service Medal, Good Conduct Medal, and National Defense Service Medal. In 1958, he married his sweetheart, Maureen McNamara, and they settled in Burlington in 1962 to raise their family. Bob furthered his education going to school nights at Wentworth Institute. Bob retired from Frequency Resources in Chelmsford where he worked as an Electrical Engineer. He had also worked at RCA, Microwave, and Anzac. Bob’s life revolved around his family and his home. He loved sharing his passion for sports with his children. He was their coach in Pop Warner Football, Baseball, and Hockey. He loved working around his home and yard. His home was the Summer gathering spot for family and friends, enjoying BBQs and Irish music on the backyard deck and around the pool. He loved to swim, play and watch sports, and was a big fan of Boston College and professional sports teams. Bob will be remembered as a hardworking man whose greatest happiness was his family and his dogs. Bob was the loving husband of 57 years of Maureen A. (McNamara). He was the loving father of Sharon Murray of Burlington, Maura Lowe & her husband James of Burlington, Roberta of Santa Monica, CA and Daniel of Indianapolis, IN. Brother of Henry of Woburn, Kathleen Bertochi of Woburn and the late Lawrence. Proud grandfather of Emily & Sierrah McLaughlin and Caitlan & Bryan Murray. Great grandfather of Jaxton Freeman.
