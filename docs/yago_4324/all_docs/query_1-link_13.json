        "text": "I was watching “sailor of the king” and wondered if the director had a crush on Hunter the way he filmed him homoerotically throughout the picture. Then I found out the director was none other than the former husband of Hayley mills, Roy boulting.\n\nI must say though that I think Hunter was filmed beautifully in this film in both his uniform and half naked for the second half. He looked like a fantasy with his body glistening with sweat and a slight smattering of chest hair.\n\nI’ve revisited some of his movies lately because they were mentioned in other threads and it’s curious that he wasn’t selected for some of those sexy male roles like brick in “cat on hot run roof”. He really would have been good in some of those Tennessee Williams pictures.\n\nI find him more handsome than tab, I think it’s the eyes which are shown to their best in John ford’s sergeant Rutledge.\n\nJohn Ford gave him two of his best roles “the searchers” and “sergeant Rutledge” and each time filmed him at his most handsome. I can definitely get behind Maureen o’hara’s suggestion that Ford was perhaps bisexual.\n\nI guess what may have held him back from really taking off was that he was not really a scene stealer. For fox he was in a number of ensembles and sort of faded into the background in both “in love and war” and “no down payment”, if I compare this with Paul Newman who really made the most famous of the role in “the long hot summer”. What Hunter really needed was a good old steamy part which is why I suggested Tennessee Williams or equally William inge - a role like Berry-Berry in “all fall down”\n\nI thought I’d remembered hearing this:\n\nThe following is an excerpt from The Way We All Became The Brady Bunch: How the Canceled Sitcom Became the Beloved Pop Culture Icon We Are Still Talking About Today by Kimberly Potts, the definitive history of the show that changed the family sitcom and made an indelible impact on pop culture, pegged to its 50th anniversary. In this selection, the author digs into the casting of Mike Brady, ultimately played by Robert Reed. Read on below. The book publishes Tuesday.\n\n“The legend about Gene Hackman almost becoming Mr. Brady is not true, or at least (actually, at most) is very exaggerated. Hackman was on Sherwood Schwartz’s wish list for maybe Mikes, and he’d hoped to set up an interview with the actor to discuss the part. But once again, the suits had something to say about his idea, and the something they were saying was, No one knows who this guy is. It was 1968, and Hackman had made guest appearances on I Spy, The F.B.I., and Robert Reed’s legal drama The Defenders. He’d also earned his first Oscar nomination, a supporting-actor nod for Bonnie and Clyde. But his popularity among TV audiences, network execs said, was zilch, and they ultimately wouldn’t sign off on Schwartz even scheduling an interview with Hackman. Things turned out okay for him, despite his lockout from the Brady universe. The year after The Bunch debuted, Hackman won his first Academy Award, for Best Actor in The French Connection.\n\nAs with the search to find the actress who would portray Carol, efforts to cast Mike were met with polite “no thanks” by some well-known actors who wanted neither the commitment a TV series required nor the risk that once they became known as a TV actor, movie work would elude them. But original Star Trek series star Jeffrey Hunter (he played Captain Christopher Pike in the first Trek pilot) was the pursuer for the job of playing Papa Brady. Hunter, who’d had some success on TV, and on the big screen with his performance as Jesus in 1961’s King of Kings, interviewed multiple times with Schwartz, who told him he was simply too handsome (imagine Comeback Special–era Elvis Presley crossed with Golden Globe winner Matt Bomer) to be architect Mike. If Mike had been a shirt model, Hunter would be the man, Schwartz reasoned. But even after Hunter argued that he was aging, that the lines around his ice-blue eyes had given him character and a more mature look, the Brady Bunch creator couldn’t picture the actor in the role. Hunter turned his attention back to movie roles, but in May 1969 he died after fracturing his skull in a fall at his home.”"
