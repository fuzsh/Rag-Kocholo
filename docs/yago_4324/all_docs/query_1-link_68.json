        "text": "Home Health agencies, how are you managing your internal resource pool and contingent labor workforce?? _ _ _ _ I have heard from many connections who have or want to utilize a VMS that their major concern is they are built for acute care and hospital setting. What if there was a solution that was configured for home health and post acute? What if it came with a mobile app so your resources can apply for open positions that match their skillset and pick up different shifts on the fly? AMN Healthcare can help with our ShiftWise Flex and AMN Passport!! I am looking for some leaders in home health who want to better manage their workforce, to have some conversations with and get some valuable feedback on a solution that can be tailored to their needs. #internalresourcepool #contingentlabor #homehealth #postacute #vms\n\n3\n\nManaging length of stay continues to be a financial benefit driver for facilities but we at LBMC also know it is much more dynamic then that. Patients need to be taken care of in the right amount of time, with the right resources, and then successfully transitioned to their next level of care. Our team at LBMC focuses on ensuring your teams success and have a track record of success. As a saying goes, Help Us Help You #lbmc #patientthroughput #caremanagement\n\n5\n\nWhat their behavior shows you . . . At Healthcare IS, candidates have been telling us that they‚Äôre not hearing back. And by that they mean that the organizations they‚Äôre interviewing with are not providing them with any updates or feedback. I realize this is nothing new and that it‚Äôs part of a much larger trend. But as we explain to candidates, this dark cloud has a silver lining. By not following up with updates or feedback, organizations that enjoy telling candidates all about their amazing culture, teamwork, and communication are actually SHOWING them how NOT amazing they are in practice. This is a good thing, we tell our candidates, because they‚Äôre getting an opportunity to pull back the curtain and see what they might be getting into. If you‚Äôre interviewing with two companies, and one‚Äôs keeping you up to date while the other is not, don‚Äôt be upset with the one that‚Äôs not. Instead, perceive the silence as critical additional information that will help you to make the right decision for yourself.\n\n5\n\n1 Comment\n\nüîç Did you know? An analysis of over 50 US hospitals revealed that while signing bonuses for RNs are popular, they create only $2,800 in retention value but cost over $10,000 per employee. These bonuses lead to minor improvements in turnover for the first 18 to 24 months and often result in increased turnover at the 12-month mark when the bonuses are paid out. üí° Wondering if there's a better way to support your talent acquisition efforts for nursing or other clinical roles? Looking to retain your staff without the immediate financial hit of sign-on bonuses? ü§î Wondering how you can access talent outside of your current school partners? ‚ú® Look no further!

That doesn't take into account time off, holidays, lack of availability on provider schedules, etc... Now is the time to look at your membership rosters and ensure that all of your patients have been scheduled and/or already seen for 2024. Some things to consider: ‚úÖ How many patients have not had their AWV yet for 2024? How much revenue are you missing out on by not doing AWV's? Having a solid AWV template built into your EHR is a game changer and will simplify so many workflows. ‚úÖ Have you re-captured the previous years conditions appropriately? Do you need to recall any of those patients? ‚úÖ Have quality items been addressed for your patients? ‚úÖ When looking at your membership roster, do you see patients with high utilization that may be a good fit for a case management program? Good luck as you shift into the 2nd part of the year! Reach out if there is anything you want to discuss to help you along your journey.

Whether it‚Äôs a well-deserved promotion, a significant work anniversary, or even a transition when roles have evolved beyond current capabilities, every milestone is a testament to the dedication, hard work, and growth of our employees ( past and present). Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential to celebrate these moments with data: 1. Promotions: Celebrating promotions not only acknowledges the individual‚Äôs hard work and achievements but also motivates others to strive for excellence. Data shows that recognizing employee achievements can increase productivity by up to 12% and improve overall job satisfaction. 2. Anniversaries: Work anniversaries mark the loyalty and commitment of our team members. Recognizing these milestones reinforces a sense of belonging and appreciation. According to a Gallup study, employees who feel appreciated are 4 times more likely to be engaged at work, leading to a more cohesive and productive team. 3. Role Transitions: Sometimes, roles evolve, and individuals may transition out due to the scale or demands of their positions. Celebrating these transitions highlights the contributions made and ensures a respectful and supportive environment. Research indicates that acknowledging such transitions positively can maintain high morale and respect within the team, reducing turnover rates by 31%. 4. Talent Attraction: Many companies attempt to recruit our talent because of our renowned culture and commitment to excellence. By using data-driven approaches to celebrate and acknowledge our employees, we not only retain top talent but also attract new talent. According to LinkedIn, companies that frequently celebrate employee milestones have a 33% higher rate of attracting top talent. In conclusion, celebrating these milestones with tangible data underscores the importance of each individual‚Äôs journey within Alignment Health. It fosters a culture of recognition, appreciation, and continuous growth, ensuring that everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute their best. Let‚Äôs continue to celebrate each other‚Äôs achievements, big and small üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª #CelebrateSuccess #EmployeeAppreciation #AlignmentHealthCulture\n\n91\n\n6 Comments"
