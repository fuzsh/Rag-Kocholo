        "text": "A Note from Co-Director Christin Davis -\n\nThe passage of time is so precious.\n\nIn making Our Town, Quetta and I wanted to create a world where we could come together as a collaborative community and make something that matters to us. After so much time distanced from each other, we wanted to give our students, and ourselves, space and time to experience what it is to deeply listen and connect.\n\nI am still very much making sense of the past 2.5 years and what it has meant for myself as a mom, wife, daughter, sister, friend, teacher and artist. It has been a balm to wrestle with the existential questions at the heart of Our Town. It has also been a profound gift to be viscerally reminded of the magic that happens when we human beings allow ourselves to really be with each other, to really look at each other, knowing that tomorrow it will be different, and the next day, and the next, until we're not quite sure what happened, but we're still in our lives and hopefully we are there with some people we love.\n\nWe hope you have a memorable visit to Our Town and that you enjoy it as much as we've enjoyed making it.\n\nA Note from Co-Director Quetta Carpenter -\n\nChristin and I have known we wanted to make Our Town together for years. Now felt like the right time. I first did this play as an actor at Utah Shakespeare Festival in 1993 when I was 20 years old. I played the Woman in the Balcony, a member of the choir and First Dead Woman. Emily’s question in Act 3 “Do human beings ever realize life while they live it?” has rung in my consciousness since that production and I still cannot read the play without being profoundly moved.\n\nAs an actor, I always love best the last run in the rehearsal space before moving into the theatre. The rehearsal space is where we get inspired, where ideas are born and sometimes discarded and where the show is forged every day until it finally works. There is a magic to that last run in the rehearsal room, as all of the company is assembled around, watching from the sides and back as we all put together the thing we have been making without any of the bells and whistles of a fully produced show. We wanted to capture that feeling and share it with you. So in this production, you won’t see full costumes, lighting or sets, just some rehearsal clothes and stand-in furniture. And Our Town.\n\nWelcome. We made it for you."
