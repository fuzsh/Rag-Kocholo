        "text": "In the 'Star Trek: Discovery' thread, talk of the delicious Anson Mount as Captain Christopher Pike naturally called to mind the original sexy Captain Pike, Jeffrey Hunter. I only know him from Star Trek. Tell us more about this blue eyed beauty.\n\nIn Tab's book he claims that once he and Jeff were both in Europe to make films and, as a joke, switched roles, figuring no one would know the difference. And no one did.\n\nHe died quite young, as result of a head injury. He'd also had a bad concussion previously from an on-set accident.\n\nPlayed a few blue eyed native Americans and he was Jesus!\n\nhis first wife was actress Barbara Rush. They lived on the beach in santa monica next door to Peter and Pat Lawford. His second wife was Joan Bartlett and if I remember reading correctly was something of a bitch and gave her husband career advsie which he took, which somewhat tanked his career. I think as he neared middle age, Jeff sank into alcoholism.....functional alcoholism, however/and it hadnt impacted his looks to the point he couldnt get acting gigs.\n\nWhen he played the Lord, one critic referred to the film as \"I was a Teenage Jesus\". He was not a great actor. Just pretty.\n\nBarbara Rush (still alive but ancient) was a pretty good actress but basically a second stringer who failed to get a series (she did a pilot for a Donna Reed knockoff) and a couple other unsold pilots. Her daughter works for Fox!\n\nBarbara Rush played an anti-Miss Ellie character on Flamingo Road, I think even with a slant to alcoholism.\n\nHunter was extremely handsome but got married a lot in his short life. Was he a pussy hound? Maybe I am just over dramatizing this aspect. Hollywood actors got divorced left and right even when it wasn't common yet, like in the fifties.\n\nBack in those days living together was such a taboo, that's why all those classic Hollywood actors and actresses kept getting married and divorced every five minutes. Can you think of a modern actor or actress who's been married four or five times?"
