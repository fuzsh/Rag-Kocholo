        "text": "Hunter was born Henry Herman McKinnies, Jr., in New Orleans, Louisiana, but raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from 1930 onward, where he graduated from Whitefish Bay High School. He began acting in local theater and radio in his early teens. He served stateside in the United States Navy, in World War II, then studied theatre at Northwestern University, 1946â€“1949.\n\nA loan-out to co-star with John Wayne in the title roles of the now-classic western The Searchers began the first of three pictures he made with director John Ford; the other two films he made with Ford were The Last Hurrah and Sergeant Rutledge.\n\nJeff Hunter 'The Searchers'- Video LINK\n\nVideo LINK:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aex1xDnG44A\n\nFord also recommended Hunter to director Nicholas Ray for the role of Jesus in the Biblical film King of Kings, a difficult part met by critical reaction that ranged from praise to ridicule. Among an all-star cast in the World War II battle epic The Longest Day, he provided a climactic heroic act of leading an ultimately successful attempt to breach the defense wall atop Normandy's Omaha Beach but dying in the process. Although Temple Houston did not survive its first season, NBC offered him the lead role of Captain Christopher Pike in \"The Cage\", the pilot episode of a new science fiction series, Star Trek. Hunter decided to concentrate on motion pictures such as Brainstorm, and declined to film a second Star Trek pilot requested by NBC in 1965; the lead in the series was then made into a different character, James T. Kirk, a role given to William Shatner. Later that year, Hunter filmed the pilot for yet another NBC series, the espionage thriller Journey Into Fear, which the network did not pick up.\n\nLINK: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001374/bio"
