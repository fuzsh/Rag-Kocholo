        "text": "Jeffrey Hunter may not have been the most famous actor, but he sure was one of the most handsome.\n\nHis most famous roles are as John Wayne’s character’s sidekick in The Searchers, as Jesus Christ in the biblical film King of Kings, and as Capt. Christopher Pike in the original pilot episode of Star Trek. He also made a few films with Robert Wagner so I’ve included several photos of them together. I think they would have made a very handsome couple!\n\nAfter serving in the US Navy during WWII, Hunter studied theater at Northwestern University (Charlton Heston was a classmate) then went on to graduate school at UCLA where he was discovered by talent scouts at 20th Century Fox.\n\nHe went on the appear in such films as The Longest Day, The Last Hurrah, and Sergeant Rutledge.\n\nHunter turned to television in 1963 to star in the NBC series Temple Houston which lasted one season then he filmed the original pilot episode for Star Trek. When NBC requested a second Star Trek pilot, Hunter decided not to participate.\n\nHunter was just 42 when he was injured in an on-set explosion in 1969 on the set of the film Viva America! in Spain. He suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on the flight back to the US. Although he recovered, he suffered a second cerebral hemorrhage a short time later and died during surgery.\n\nAt the time of his death, Hunter was married to actress Emily McLaughlin known to General Hospital as Jesse Brewer. He had previously married to actress Barbara Rush with whom he had a son."
