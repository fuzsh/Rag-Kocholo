A visitation will be held on Friday, August 9, from 6 to 8 PM at Heartland Funeral Home in Early. Funeral services for Patricia will be held on Saturday, August 10, at 10:00AM at St. Johnâs Church in Brownwood. Burial will follow at Eastlawn Memorial Park.\n\nPatrica was born on May 15, 1942 to Gilbert and Iris Howard in Banbury, England. She grew up in Banbury and graduated from Grimsbury High School in 1957. She married Wendell Bernard Doud on November 4, 1962 in Banbury. The couple met while Wendell was stationed in England while in the Military. Wendell saw Pat jumping a fence and he yelled to her, âHey Shorty! Iâm gonna take you to the movies.â She yelled back at him that she would have to ask her dad first. The next day, Pat came home from work and Wendell was sitting at the kitchen table in her house talking to her mother.\n\nAfter moving to the United States with Wendell, she was a housewife, did in-home daycare, and also worked for Dr. Stevens and Dr. Chandler as a receptionist. Pat attended Saint Johnâs Church in Brownwood for many years; she also was a member of the church choir. She enjoyed playing Bunko, watching Brit-Box English TV shows, volunteering for her church, traveling to the coast, and collecting British memorabilia. Most of all, Pat enjoyed spending time with her family.\n\nPatricia is survived by her husband, Wendell Doud; children, Tracy Franklin and husband Lynn, Tim Doud and wife Elizabeth, Matthew Doud and wife Jessica; grandchildren, Randal Doud and wife Ashlee, Hunter Doud and fiancÃ© Deanna, Mitchel Doud, Joshua Doud, Brianna Franklin, Emily Doud, Mia Doud, Elias Huerta-Doud, Adryanna Huerta, Addaley Huerta, and Blythe and Vance Ripley; 5 great grandchildren, and one great great grandchild.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; and grandson, Ian Doud."
