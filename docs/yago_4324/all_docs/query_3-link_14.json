        "text": "\"General Hospital\" is celebrating its 60th anniversary.\n\nThe popular soap opera first premiered in 1963, and has seen many characters and actors join and leave the show throughout its six decades on the air. Fans watch each week to see what the residents of Port Charles, New York, are up to, and what the latest gossip around General Hospital is.\n\nSome of its big stars have stayed with the show, while others have gone on to make a name for themselves in other projects.\n\nHere's a look back at a few of \"General Hospital's\" biggest stars and where they are now.\n\n'GENERAL HOSPITAL' KILLS LUKE SPENCER CHARACTER OFF-SCREEN YEARS AFTER ACTOR ANTHONY GEARY LEFT THE SHOW\n\nAnthony Geary\n\nAnthony Geary had only appeared as a guest on a few television shows before landing the role of Luke Spencer on the long-running soap opera \"General Hospital\" in 1978. His tenure on the hit show earned him a record eight Daytime Emmy Award wins.\n\nWhile starring on \"General Hospital,\" Geary also appeared in a number of TV movies, including \"The Shaft of Love,\" \"Intimate Agony,\" \"Sins of the Past,\" \"Kicks\" and \"The Imposter.\" He also starred in the films \"P.I. Private Investigations,\" \"Disorderlies,\" \"Penitentiary III,\" \"Pass the Ammo,\" \"Dangerous Love\" and \"Crack House.\"\n\nGeary left \"General Hospital\" in 1984, and took on different types of roles in order to distance himself from Luke Spencer. He returned to the show in 1991 as Luke's look-alike cousin, but following backlash from fans that character was killed off, and he went back to playing Luke in 1993.\n\nThroughout the '90s, Geary starred in a few films and appeared on a number of TV shows, including \"Knight of the Warrior,\" \"Scorchers,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"General Hospital: Twist of Fate\" and \"Port Charles.\"\n\nHe appeared in a few movies throughout the 2000s, such as \"Carpool Guy,\" \"Fish Tank\" and \"Alice and the Monster,\" before announcing his retirement from \"General Hospital\" in 2015 after 1,116 episodes. His last episode aired in July 2015.\n\nGeary was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for the first time in 1980, and won for the first time in 1982, receiving one more nomination in 1983 before leaving the show. He was nominated again in 1997, 1998, 1999 and almost every year for the next decade, receiving his final nomination in 2016. When Geary left the show, he had been nominated a total of 16 times, with eight wins.\n\nGenie Francis\n\nGenie Francis only had one small role on a television show prior to taking over the role of Laura Wright from Stacy Baldwin on \"General Hospital\" in 1977. As part of one of the show's central couples, Francis skyrocketed to fame, with 30 million people tuning in to watch Luke and Laura's wedding episode.\n\nThe actress decided to leave the show in 1982, and shortly after was cast in her own primetime soap opera, \"Bare Essence,\" which ran for 11 episodes.\n\n'GENERAL HOSPITAL' STAR GENIE FRANCIS SAYS SHE WILL NO LONGER DEFEND 1979 DATE RAPE SCENE: 'A BURDEN'\n\nFrancis also starred on the soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\" from 1987 to 1989, and \"All My Children\" from 1990 to 1992. The following year, in 1993, she returned to \"General Hospital,\" where she stayed until 2002.\n\nIn addition to \"General Hospital,\" she has appeared in other shows including, \"Cybill,\" \"The Incredible Hulk,\" \"3rd Rock From the Sun,\" \"Oh Baby,\" \"Roswell, \"Teacher's Pet\" and \"Thunderbirds,\" and in the Hallmark movies \"The Note\" and \"Taking a Chance on Love.\"\n\nA few years after Francis' departure from the show, she returned briefly in 2006. While she was only on the show for a month, her return earned her a third Daytime Emmy Award nomination for the role of Laura, and her first win.\n\nFollowing her Emmy win, Francis starred in her third Hallmark movie, \"Notes from the Heart Healer,\" and began starring as Genevieve Atkinson on \"The Young and the Restless.\" Her portrayal of Genevieve earned the actress her fourth Daytime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nAfter a few brief returns to \"General Hospital\" in 2008 and 2013, she returned to the show full-time in 2015 and received another Daytime Emmy nomination in 2021.\n\nFrancis first met her husband Jonathan Frakes in 1982 while filming \"Bare Essence.\" However, they didn't start dating until they met for a second time in 1984 when they were filming \"North & South.\" They began dating in 1985 and officially tied the knot three years later in 1988.\n\nThe couple have two children together: a son, Jameson Ivor Frakes, and a daughter, Elizabeth Frances Frakes.\n\nKin Shriner\n\nKin Shriner is best known for his role as Scott Baldwin on \"General Hospital,\" a character he began playing in 1977, not long after he first began acting.\n\nAfter only three years playing Scott Baldwin, Shriner left the show for the first time, and was almost immediately cast in \"Texas,\" on which he starred as Jeb Hampton. However, after only one year, he chose to leave the show and return to \"General Hospital,\" where he stayed for two years until 1983.\n\nDuring his time away from \"General Hospital,\" Shriner appeared on \"The Love Boat\" and starred on the short-lived soap opera \"Rituals,\" as well as in the films \"Vendetta,\" \"Manhunter\" and \"Kidnapped\" before returning to \"General Hospital\" in 1987. Following his return to the show, he remained active in other projects, including a number of TV movies.\n\nShriner chose to leave the show once again in 1993, after which he had a short stint on \"The Bold and the Beautiful.\" During that time, he also starred in \"The Skateboard Kid 2,\" \"Subliminal Seduction,\" \"Droid Gunner,\" \"Echo\" and \"The Crying Child.\"\n\nShriner returned to the role of Scott Baldwin in 1997, but this time on the \"General Hospital\" spin-off series \"Port Charles.\" The show was set in the same fictional New York town, and many of the characters from the original show were featured on it as well. He returned to \"General Hospital\" in 2000, then left the show again in 2004.\n\nShriner went on to join \"As the World Turns\" from 2004 to 2006 and was on \"The Young and the Restless\" from 2004 to 2011.\n\nAfter leaving and coming back to the show a few more times, Shriner returned to \"General Hospital\" for good in 2013. Throughout his time on the show, Shriner has been nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, as well as nine Soap Opera Digest Awards, of which he won two.\n\nShriner has a son named Eric Lee.\n\nJacklyn Zeman\n\nPrior to taking on the role of Barbara \"Bobbie\" Spencer on \"General Hospital,\" Jacklyn Zeman starred on \"One Life to Live\" for 23 episodes, playing the role of Lana McClain.\n\nWhile starring on \"General Hospital,\" Zeman also appeared in the films \"Young Doctors in Love\" and \"Class Reunion,\" as well as the shows \"The New Mike Hammer,\" \"Sledge Hammer!,\" \"Chicago Hope,\" and \"Jury Duty; The Comedy,\" alongside Heather Locklear. She then starred in the TV movie based on the show, \"General Hospital: Twist of Fate.\"\n\n'GENERAL HOSPITAL' SOAP STAR JACK WAGNER'S SON HARRISON, 27, FOUND DEAD IN LOS ANGELES PARKING LOT\n\nAfter 1996, Zeman took a break from acting in projects outside \"General Hospital,\" appearing in nothing else until 2010, when she began starring as Sofia Madison on \"The Bay,\" for which she received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination. From 2017-2019, she had a seven-episode arc on \"Misguided.\"\n\nStarting in 2013, her role on \"General Hospital\" has been a recurring one. For her work on the show, Zeman has received four Daytime Emmy Awards, both in the supporting and lead actress categories. She continues to portray Bobbie Spencer on the show today.\n\nAside from her on-screen career, Zeman acted in the off-Broadway plays \"Come Blow Your Horn,\" \"Barefoot in the Park\" and \"The Boyfriend.\"\n\nZeman married her first husband, popular DJ Murray Kaufman, also known as Murray the K, in 1979. The two divorced in 1981. She then married her second husband, Steve Gribbin, in 1985, with the two eventually getting a divorce a year later in 1986. She married her third husband, Glenn Gorden, in 1988.\n\nGorden and Zeman had two children, Cassidy Zee Gorden and Lacey Rose Gorden, before divorcing in 2007.\n\nEmily McLaughlin\n\nEmily McLaughlin made her on-screen debut in 1958 on the soap opera \"Young Dr. Malone\" before taking on the role of Nurse Jessie Brewer on \"General Hospital\" in 1963.\n\nMcLaughlin was the first voice audiences heard when they tuned in to watch the first episode of \"General Hospital.\" She said the opening line \"Seventh floor, nurses station\" over the loudspeaker, a line which still plays on the show.\n\nPrior to starring on \"General Hospital,\" McLaughlin also appeared in episodes of the popular shows \"The Twilight Zone,\" \"Checkmate,\" \"Sam Benedict\" and \"The Eleventh Hour.\"\n\nHer final two acting roles outside the world of \"General Hospital\" was on the show \"The Man Who Never Was\" and in the movie \"Young Doctors In Love.\"\n\nIn 1974, McLaughlin received a Golden Globe nomination for her role on \"General Hospital,\" making her the only daytime soap opera actress to be honored with a Golden Globe nomination in the show's history.\n\nAs McLaughlin's health began to slowly decline throughout the '80s, she appeared on the show less and eventually became a day-player, meaning she was hired on an episode-by-episode basis. Her last appearance on the show was in March 1991, only a month prior to her passing.\n\nMcLaughlin was married to her first husband, Robert Lansing, from 1956 to 1968, and together they had one son, Robert Frederick Orin Lansing. Following their divorce, she married actor Jeffery Hunter in 1969. However, three months after their wedding, Hunter passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage.\n\nThe actress died from cancer on April 26, 1991, at the age of 62.\n\nJohn Beradino\n\nJohn Beradino had a successful career as a baseball player before transitioning into acting in the 1940s. His first role was in the 1948 movie \"The Winner's Circle.\"\n\nAs a baseball player, Beradino played with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the St. Louis Browns and the Cleveland Indians, with whom he won a World Series in 1948. After suffering a career-ending injury to his leg in 1952, he retired from baseball and began focusing on acting as his primary career.\n\nPrior to getting his starring role on \"General Hospital\" as Dr. Steve Hardy, Beradino mostly found work as a guest actor on popular sitcoms throughout the ‘50s and ’60s.

During his time on the show, he was nominated for three Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nWhile starring on the soap opera, Beradino also appeared in a few films, including \"Moon of the Wolf,\" \"A Guide for the Married Woman,\" \"Don't Look Back: The Story of Leroy 'Satchel' Paige\" and \"Young Doctors in Love.\" He also appeared on \"The Love Boat\" and \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\"\n\nIn 1993, Beradino was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He also was inducted into the University of Southern California Athletic Hall of Fame, as he played baseball for the school as a student there.\n\nThe actor married Jeanette Nadine Barritt in 1941, and together they had two children, Toni and Cindy. They were married for 14 years before divorcing in 1955. He then married Charissa Hughes in January 1961. The couple had two children together, Katherine Ann and John Anthony, before Hughes passed away in June 1963.\n\nIn 1971, Beradino married Marjorie Binder, and the two were together until his death. Beradino was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1996, and passed away from the disease later that year in May.\n\nLaura Wright\n\nLaura Wright already had experience starring on a soap opera when she signed on to play Carly Corinthos on \"General Hospital,\" taking over the role from Sarah Joy Brown.\n\nIn 1991, she made her on-screen debut as Ally Bowman on \"All My Children.\" She went on to play Ally on the soap operas \"Loving\" and \"The City.\"\n\n'COLONEL SANDERS' APPEARING ON 'GENERAL HOSPITAL' IN HONOR OF NATIONAL FRIED CHICKEN DAY\n\nFrom 1997 to 2005, Wright portrayed Cassie Layne on \"Guiding Light\" before leaving for \"General Hospital.\"\n\n\"As sad as I am to leave a wonderful place that I called home for a long time, it is time for me to go,\" Wright said on her website when the announcement was made. \"This was not an easy decision. But my husband and I talked about it, and we said, 'What the Hell! Let's live on the West Coast for a few years!'\n\nAfter starring on soap operas for 20 years, she won her first Daytime Emmy Award in 2011 for her role as Carly. She followed that up with six more nominations in the lead actress category.\n\nWhile starring on \"General Hospital,\" Wright also appeared on an episode of the show \"Hit the Floor,\" as well as in the movies \"Joy,\" starring Jennifer Lawrence, and \"Deadly Patient,\" which aired on Lifetime.\n\nWright married her husband John Wright in 1995, and the couple had two children together, Lauren and Michael Wright, before announcing their decision to separate in 2016. In 2017, it was announced she was dating her \"General Hospital\" co-star Wes Ramsey.\n\nJack Wagner\n\nJack Wagner had only appeared in a few shows prior to landing the role of Frisco Jones on \"General Hospital\" in 1983, the role he is most famous for.\n\nHe stayed on the show for four years, leaving \"General Hospital\" for the first time in 1987. During his break from the show, Wagner starred in the movies \"Moving Target,\" \"Swimsuit\" and \"Play Murder for Me,\" before returning to the soap opera in 1989 until 1991.\n\nFollowing his second departure from the show, Wagner took on the role of Warren Lockridge on the hit soap opera \"Santa Barbara,\" on which he starred for two years from 1991 until the show ended in 1993.
