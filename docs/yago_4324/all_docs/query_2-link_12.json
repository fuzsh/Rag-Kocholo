        "text": "Sydney McLaughlin is favored to win gold in the women's 400m hurdles at the Paris Olympics. At the U.S. Olympic trials in June, she broke her own world record—crossing the finish line in 50.65 seconds. The Paris Games will be her third Olympics, but her first competing under her married name: Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone.\n\nIn 2022, Sydney married former NFL player Andre Levrone Jr., and she calls him her \"biggest hype man.\" Sydney said, \"I'm so grateful for Andre because he understands the athlete life, the day-to-day, what it takes, and all the little things. We're very similar just in how we're wired because of that, which helps us understand each other.\"\n\nAndre and Sydney in Paris, 2022.\n\nHere, everything you need to know about Sydney McLaughlin's husband Andre Levrone Jr.:\n\n1. He was born and raised in Maryland.\n\nAndre is the son of Andre and Angie Levrone. He has an older brother, Jonathan, who served a tour in Iraq as a tanker in the U.S. Army, and an older sister, Raquel. Both his parents were athletes; his mom was a track & field athlete, gymnast, and cheerleader, and his father Andre, Sr. played linebacker while serving in the Marine Corps.\n\nIn high school at Our Lady of Good Counsel High School, Andre played wide receiver and safety.\n\nLevrone in 2019.\n\nIn college, Andre played for University of Virginia, and after he graduated in 2017, he went undrafted in the NFL; however, he signed a contract with the Baltimore Ravens and played for Baltimore, Carolina Panthers, and Jacksonville Jaguars. He retired from the NFL in 2020 after just three seasons.\n\n\"Deciding to no longer pursue a professional football career was a difficult decision, but a necessary one nonetheless,\" he posted on Instagram. \"The early mornings, the late nights, the relationships formed, & the relationships lost. Many smiles, laughs, & tears. A fractured vertebrae & countless other ailments... it was ALL worth it. I’m so grateful for the opportunity to have abided in my passion for so many years, & to have done so on every level.\"\n\n3. He DM'd Sydney on Instagram after she posted a selfie.\n\nIn her memoir, , Sydney revealed how she met her future husband. \"One day, I posted a selfie with the caption 'Attention,' a reference to a song I’d been listening to,\" she wrote, saying she wasn't trying to get anyone's attention, just \"being a little creative.\" She soon got a DM from Andre: \"You have my attention. How can I get yours?\"\n\nIn a separate interview with the , Sydney revealed \"we had a mutual friend who I went to high school with and he went to college with, but we didn’t interact until he slid into my DMs. We started off as friends. He asked me to do Bible study with him and introduced me to so many great people.\" She added, \"It was the first time I was in a relationship with a man who I felt could lead me in my faith to a place where I wanted to be. We both knew early on that we liked each other and what our intentions were. If I could say the one thing about our relationship, it's that it was always very intentional. Honestly, I knew the fourth day we ever talked. So that's something.\"\n\nThe rest is history: They began dating, got engaged in August 2021, and tied the knot in May 2022.\n\n4. He's in seminary school.\n\nSydney McLaughlin kisses her husband Andre Levrone Jr. at the 2022 USATF Outdoor Championships.\n\nBoth Sydney and Andre are very outspoken about their Christian faith, and are members of Grace Community Church in Los Angeles, California.
