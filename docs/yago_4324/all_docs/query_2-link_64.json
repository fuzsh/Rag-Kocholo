        "text": "EDISTO ISLAND, S.C. (WCSC/Gray News) – A South Carolina community is reeling after two tornadoes touched down and caused irreplaceable damage to those who call the areas home.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed the tornadoes touched down in Moncks Corner and Edisto Island from Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nOfficials said the first tornado occurred on Edisto Island and was on the ground for around 10 minutes. It was rated an EF-1 with estimated peak wind speeds of 97 mph.\n\nThe tornado moved onshore from the ocean near the intersection of Highway 174 and Palmetto Boulevard and traveled about 2.89 miles.\n\nEdisto Beach resident Tatum McDonald said he was scared by the howling winds from the tornado.\n\n“The winds were crazy; I didn’t know what was going to happen,” he said.\n\nThe high winds damaged many homes on the beach as well as the buildings of local businesses. One home in particular saw the worst of the tornado.\n\nWayne Williams and his family have lived in their home on Edisto Island off Fishing Creek Drive for about six years.\n\nWilliams said the damage left by the storms has left them unsure of where to start at rebuilding.\n\n“Welcome to Edisto,” Williams said. “The house is totally devastated. We don’t have anything left.”\n\nThe damage is more personal for the Williams inside where inches of water now cover their home, ruining valuables, clothing and personal items.\n\n“Both my granddaughters learned to crawl in that house,” Williams said. “The boys and my oldest granddaughter loved it down here as well.”\n\nThe Williams are taking a positive approach to the tragedy saying they will rebuild and create new memories inside their home they named “The Marshmallow.”\n\nThe tornadoes that passed through Edisto Island and Moncks Corner were two out of seven tornadoes related to Debby that touched down over the week, according to the NWS.\n\nOfficials said the Williams’ house was one of three houses on Edisto Island that lost their roof to the storm.\n\nThe other tornadoes touched down near the Isle of Palms, Kiawah Island, West Ashley, and Lady’s Island. Officials did not report any severe damage or injuries caused by the other tornadoes."
