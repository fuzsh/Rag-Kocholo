I had recently returned from a magazine assignment at Offutt Field, Headquarters of the Strategic Air Command, several SAC operational bases, and the Missile Test Center on Cape Canaveral. More to the point, I had been discussing just such a possibility with several astute British staff officers. The British have lived under the shadow of nuclear-armed rockets longer than we. Also, they have a vivid memory of cities devastated from the skies, as have the Germans and Japanese.\n\nA man who has been shaken by a two-ton blockbuster has a frame of reference. He can equate the impact of an H-bomb with his own experience, even though the H-bomb blast is a million times more powerful than the shock he endured. To someone who has never felt a bomb, bomb is only a word. An H-bomb's fireball is something you see on television. It is not something that incinerates you to a cinder in the thousandth part of a second. So the H-bomb is beyond the imagination of all but a few Americans, while the British, Germans, and Japanese can comprehend it, if vaguely. And only the Japanese have personal understanding of atomic heat and radiation.\n\nIt was a big question. I gave him a horseback opinion, which proved conservative compared with some of the official forecasts published later. I said, \"Oh, I think they'd kill fifty or sixty million Americans--but I think we'd win the war.\"\n\nHe thought this over and said, \"Wow! Fifty or sixty million dead! What a depression that would make!\"\n\nI doubt if he realized the exact nature and extent of the depression--which is why I am writing this book.\n\nPAT FRANK\n\nChapter One\n\nIn Fort Repose, a river town in Central Florida, it was said that sending a message by Western Union was the same as broadcasting it over the combined networks. This was not entirely true. It was true that Florence Wechek, the manager, gossiped. Yet she judiciously classified the personal intelligence that flowed under her plump fingers, and maintained a prudent censorship over her tongue. The scandalous and the embarrassing she excised from her conversation. Sprightly, trivial, and harmless items she passed on to friends, thus enhancing her status and relieving the tedium of spinsterhood. If your sister was in trouble, and wired for money, the secret was safe with Florence Wechek. But if your sister bore a legitimate baby, its sex and weight would soon be known all over town.\n\nFlorence awoke at six-thirty, as always, on a Friday in early December. Heavy, stiff and graceless, she pushed herself out of bed and padded through the living room into the kitchen. She stumbled onto the back porch, opened the screen door a crack, and fumbled for the milk carton on the stoop. Not until she straightened did her china-blue eyes begin to discern movement in the hushed gray world around her. A jerky-tailed squirrel darted out on the longest limb of her grapefruit tree. Sir Percy, her enormous yellow cat, rose from his burlap couch behind the hot water heater, arched his back, stretched, and rubbed his shoulders on her flannel robe. The African lovebirds rhythmically swayed, heads pressed together, on the swing in their cage. She addressed the lovebirds: \"Good morning, Anthony. Good morning, Cleo.\"\n\nTheir eyes, spectacularly ringed in white, as if embedded in mint Life Savers, blinked at her. Anthony shook his green and yellow plumage and rasped a greeting. Cleo said nothing. Anthony was adventurous, Cleo timid. On occasion Anthony grew raucous and irascible and Florence released him into limitless freedom outside. But always, at dusk, Anthony waited in the Turk's-cap, or atop the frangipani, eager to fly home. So long as Cleo preferred comfortable and sheltered imprisonment, Anthony would remain a domesticated parrot. That's what they'd told her when she bought the birds in Miami a month before, and apparently it was true.\n\nFlorence carried their cage into the kitchen and shook fresh sunflower seed into their feeder. She filled Sir Percy's bowl with milk, and crumpled a bit of wafer for the goldfish in the bowl on the counter. She returned to the living room and fed the angelfish, mollies, guppies, and vivid neons in the aquarium. She noted that the two miniature catfish, useful scavengers, were active. She was checking the tank's temperature, and its electric filter and heater, when the percolator chuckled its call to breakfast. At seven, exactly, Florence switched on the television, turned the knob to Channel 8, Tampa, and sat down to her orange juice and eggs. Her morning routine was unvaried and efficient. The only bad parts of it were cooking for one and eating alone. Yet breakfast was not her loneliest meal, not with Anthony ogling and gabbling, the six fat goldfish dancing a dreamy oriental ballet on diaphanous fins, Sir Percy rubbing against her legs under the table, and her cheery friends on the morning show, hired, at great expense, to inform and entertain her.\n\nAs soon as she saw Dave's face, Florence could sense whether the news was going to be good or bad. On this morning Dave looked troubled, and sure enough, when he began to give the news, it was bad. The Russians had sent up another Sputnik, No. 23, and something sinister was going on in the Middle East. Sputnik No. 23 was the largest yet, according to the Smithsonian Institution, and was radioing continuous and elaborate coded signals. \"There is reason to believe,\" Frank said, \"that Sputniks of this size are equipped to observe the terrain of the earth below.\"\n\nFlorence gathered her pink flannel robe closer to her neck. She glanced up, apprehensively, through the kitchen window. All she saw were hibiscus leaves dripping in the pre-dawn ground fog, and blank gray sky beyond. They had no right to put those Sputniks up there to spy on people. As if it were on his mind also, Frank continued:\n\n\"Senator Holler, of the Armed Services Committee, yesterday joined others of a Midwest bloc in demanding that the Air Force shoot down Sputniks capable of military espionage if they violate U.S. air space. The Kremlin has already had something to say about this. Any such action, the Kremlin says, will be regarded the same as an attack on a Soviet vessel or aircraft. The Kremlin pointed out that the United States has traditionally championed the doctrine of Freedom of the Seas. The same freedom, says the Soviet statement, applies to outer space.\"\n\nThe newsman paused, looked up, and half-smiled in wry amusement at this complexity. He turned a page on his clipboard.\n\n\"There is a new crisis in the Middle East. A report from Beirut, via Cairo, says that Syrian tanks of the most modern Russian design have crossed the Jordanian frontier. This is undoubtedly a threat to Israel. At the same time Damascus charges that Turkish troops are mobilizing....\"\n\nFlorence flipped to Channel 6, Orlando, and country music. She did not understand, and could not become interested in, the politics of the Middle East. Sputniks seemed a closer and more personal menace. Her best friend Alice Cooksey, the librarian, claimed to have seen a Sputnik one evening at twilight. If you could see it, then it could see you. She stared up through the window again. No Sputnik. She rinsed the dishes and returned to her bedroom.\n\nAs she wrestled with her girdle, Florence's thought gravitated to the equally prying behavior of Randy Bragg. She adjusted the venetian blinds until she could peer out. He was at it again. There he was, brazenly immodest in checked red and black pajamas, sitting on his front steps, knees akimbo and binoculars pressed to his eyes. Although he was perhaps seventy-five yards distant, she was certain he stared directly at her, and could see through the tilted louvers. She ducked back against the bedroom wall, hands protecting her breasts.\n\nAlmost every evening for the past three weeks, and on a number of mornings, she had caught him at it. Sometimes he was on the piazza, as now, sometimes at a second-floor window, and sometimes high up on the captain's walk. Sometimes he swept the whole of River Road with his glasses, pretending an interest elsewhere, but more often he focused on her bungalow. Randolph Rowzee Bragg a Peeping Tom! It was shocking!\n\nLong before Florence's mother moved south and built the brown-shingle bungalow, the Braggs had lived in the big house, ungainly and monolithic, with tall Victorian windows and bellying bays and broad brick chimneys. Once it had been the show place of River Road. Now, it appeared shabby and outmoded compared with the long, low, antiseptic citadels of glass, metal, and tinted block constructed by rich Northerners who for the past fifteen years had been \"discovering\" the Timucuan River. Still, the Bragg house was planked and paneled with native cypress, and encased in pine clapboard, hard as iron, that might last another hundred years. Its grove, at this season like a full green cloak flecked with gold, trailed all the way from back yard to river bank, a quarter mile. And she would say this for Randy, his grounds were well kept, bright with poinsettias and bougainvillea, hibiscus, camellias, gardenias, and flame vine. Florence had known Randolph's mother, Gertrude Bragg, well, and old Judge Bragg to speak to. She had watched Randolph graduate from bicycle to jalopy, vanish for a number of years in college and law school, reappear in a convertible, vanish again during the Korean War, and finally come home for good when Judge Bragg and Mrs. Bragg were taken in the same year. Now here was Randy, one of the best known and most eligible young men in Tumucuan County, even if he did run around with Pistolville girls and drink too much, a--what was it the French called it?--a voyeur. It was disgusting. The things that went on in small towns, people wouldn't believe. Florence faced the bureau mirror, wondering how much he had seen.\n\nMany years ago a man had told her she looked something like Clara Bow. Thereafter, Florence wore her hair in bangs, and didn't worry too much about her chubby figure. The man, an imaginative idealist, had gone to England in 1940, joined the Commandos, and got himself killed. She retained only a vague and inexact memory of his caresses, but she could never forget how he had compared her to Clara Bow, a movie star. She could still see a resemblance, provided she sucked in her stomach and lifted her chin high to erase the fleshy creases in her neck--except her hair was no longer like Clara's. Her hair had thinned, and faded to mottled pink. She hurriedly sketched a Clara Bow pout on her lips, and finished dressing.\n\nWhen she stepped out of the front door, Florence didn't know whether she should cut Randy dead or give him a piece of her mind. He was still there on the steps, the binoculars in his lap. He waved, grinned, and called across lawn and road, \"Morning, Miss Florence.\" His black hair was tousled, his teeth white, and he looked boyish, handsome, and inoffensive.\n\n\"Good morning, Randy,\" Florence said. Because of the distance, she had to shout, so her voice was not formal and frigid, as she had intended.\n\n\"You look real pretty and chipper today,\" he yelled.\n\nShe walked to the carport, head averted as if avoiding a bad odor, her stiff carriage a reprimand, and did not answer. He really was nervy, sitting there in those vile pajamas, trying to sweet-talk her. All the way to town, she kept thinking of Randy. Who would ever guess that he was a deviate with a compulsion to watch women dress and undress? He ought to be arrested. But if she told the sheriff, or anybody, they would only laugh at her. Everybody knew that Randy dated lots of girls, and not all of them virgins. She herself had seen him take Rita Hernandez, that little Minorcan tart from Pistolville, into his house and, no doubt, up to his bedroom since the lights had gone on upstairs and off downstairs. And there had been others, recently a tall blonde who drove her own car, a new Imperial with Ohio plates, into the circular driveway and right up to the front steps as if she owned the place, and Randy. Nobody would believe that he found it necessary to absorb his sex at long range through optic nerves and binoculars. Yet it was strange that he had not married. It was strange that he lived alone in that wooden mausoleum. He even had his office in there, instead of in the Professional Building like the other lawyers. He was a hermit, and a snob, and a nigger-lover, and no better than a pervert. God knows what he did with those girls upstairs. Maybe all he did was make them take off their clothes and put them on again while he watched. She had heard of such things. And yet--\n\nShe couldn't make herself believe there was anything basically wrong with Randy. She had voted for him in the primaries and stood up for him at the meetings of the Frangipani Circle when those garden club biddies were pecking him to bits. After all, he was a Bragg, and a neighbor, and besides--\n\nHe obviously needed help and guidance. Randy's age, she knew, was thirty-two. Florence was forty-seven. Between people in their thirties and forties there wasn't too wide a gap. Perhaps all he needed, she decided, was a little understanding and tenderness from a mature woman.\n\n****\n\nRandy watched Florence's ten-year-old Chevy diminish and disappear down the tunnel of live oaks that arched River Road. He liked Florence. She might be a gossipy old maid but she was probably one of the few people on River Road who had voted for him. Now she was acting as if he were a stranger trying to cash a money order without credentials. He wondered why. Maybe she disapproved of Lib McGovern, who had been in and out of the house a good deal in the last few weeks. What Florence needed, he guessed, was the one thing she was unlikely to get, a man. He rose, stretched, and glanced up at the bronze weathercock on the garage steeple. Its beak pointed resolutely northeast. He checked the large, reliable marine barometer and its twin thermometer alongside the front door. Pressure 30.17, up twenty points in twelve hours. Temperature sixty-two. It would be clear and warm and the bass might start hitting off the end of the dock. He whistled, and shouted, \"Graf! Hey, Graf!\" Leaves rustled under the azalea bed and a long nose came out, followed by an interminable length of dachshund. Graf, his red coat glistening and tail whipping, bounded up the steps, supple as a seal. \"Come on, my short-legged friend,\" Randy said, and went inside, binoculars swinging from his neck, for his second cup of coffee, the cup with the bourbon in it.\n\nExcept for the library, lined with his father's law books, and the gameroom, Randy rarely used the first floor. He had converted one wing of the second-floor into an apartment suitable in size to a bachelor, and to his own taste. His taste meant living with as little exertion and strain as possible. His wing contained an office, a living room, a combination bar and kitchen alcove, and bedroom and bath. The décor was haphazard, designed for his ease, not a guest's eye. Thus he slept in an outsize mahogany sleigh bed imported from New England by some remote ancestor, but it was equipped with foam rubber mattress and contour nylon sheets. When, in boredom, he wasted an evening preparing a full meal for himself, he ate from Staffordshire bearing the Bragg crest, and with silver from Paul Storr, and by candlelight; but he laid his place on the formica bar separating living room from efficient kitchen. Now he sat on a stool at this bar, half-filled a fat mug with steaming coffee, dropped two lumps of sugar into it, and laced it with an inch of bourbon. He sipped his mixture greedily. It warmed him, all the way down.\n\nRandy didn't remember, exactly, when he had started taking a drink or two before breakfast. Dan Gunn, his best friend and probably the best medic north of Miami, said it was an unhealthy practice and the hallmark of an alcoholic. Not that Dan had reprimanded him. Dan had just advised him to be careful, and not let it become a habit. Randy knew he wasn't an alcoholic because an alcoholic craved liquor. He never craved it. He just drank for pleasure and the most pleasurable of all drinks was the first one on a crisp winter morning. Besides, when you took it with coffee that made it part of breakfast, and therefore not so depraved. He guessed he had started it during the campaign, when he had been forced to load his stomach with fried mullet, hush puppies, barbecued ribs dripping fat, chitlins, roasted oysters gritty with sand, and to wash all down with warm beer and raw rotgut. After such nights, only mellow bourbon could clear his head and launch him on another day. Bourbon had buoyed him during the campaign, and now bourbon mercifully clouded its memory. He could have beaten Porky Logan, certainly, except for one small tactical error. Randy had been making his first speech, at Pasco Creek, a cow town in the north end of the county, when somebody shouted, \"Hey, Randy, where do y' stand on the Supreme Court?\"\n\nHe had known this question must come, but he had not framed the right kind of answer: the moderate Southern quasi-liberal, semi-segregationist double-talk that would have satisfied everybody except the palmetto scrub woolhats, the loud-mouthed Kluxers and courthouse whittlers who would vote for Porky anyway, and the Georgia and Alabama riffraff crowding the Minorcans for living space in the shanties and three-room bungalows of Pistolville. The truth was that Randolph Bragg himself was torn by the problem, recognizing its dangers and complexities. He had certain convictions. He had served in Korea and Japan and he knew that the battle for Asia was being lost in counties like Timucuan. He also knew that Pasco Creek had no interest in Asia. He believed integration should start in Florida, but it must begin in the nursery schools and kindergartens and would take a generation. This was all difficult to explain, but he did voice his final conviction, inescapable because of his legal heritage and training, and the oaths he had taken as voter and soldier. He said: \"I believe in the Constitution of the United States--all of it.\"\n\nThere had been snickers and snorts from the rim of the crowd, and his listeners, except for the reporters from Tampa, Orlando, and the county weekly, had drifted away. In later speeches, elsewhere, he attempted to explain his position, but it was hopeless. Behind his back he was called a fool and a traitor to his state and his race. Randolph Rowzee Bragg, whose great-grandfather had been a United States Senator, whose grandfather had been chosen by President Wilson to represent his country as Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary in time of war, whose father had been elected, without opposition, to half a dozen offices, Randolph was beaten five-to-one in the Democratic primaries for nomination to the state legislature. It was worse than defeat. It was humiliation, and Randy knew he could never run for public office again. He refilled his mug, this time with more bourbon than coffee, and Missouri, his maid, shuffled in the hallway and knocked. He called, \"Come in, Mizzoo.\"\n\nMissouri opened the door, pushing a vacuum cleaner and carrying a pail filled with cans, bottles and rags. Missouri was the wife of Two-Tone Henry, neighbor as well as maid. She was six inches shorter than Two-Tone, who was just Randy's height, five-eleven, but Two-Tone claimed she outweighed him by a hundred pounds. If this was true, Missouri weighed around two-forty. But on this morning, it seemed to Randy that she had dwindled a bit. \"You dieting, Mizzoo?\" he said.\n\n\"No, sir, I'm not dietin'. I got nerves.\"\n\n\"Nerves!\" Missouri had always seemed nerveless, solid, and placid as a broad, deeply rooted tree. \"Two-Tone been giving you a bad time again?\"\n\n\"No. Two-Tone been behavin'. He down on the dock fishin' right now. To tell you the truth, Mister Randy, it's Mrs. McGovern. She follow me around with white gloves.\"\n\nMissouri worked two hours each morning for Randy, and the rest of the day for the McGoverns, who lived half a mile closer to town. The McGoverns were the W. Foxworth McGoverns, the Central Tool and Plate McGoverns, formerly of Cleveland, and the parents of Lib McGovern, whose proper name was Elizabeth. \"What do you mean, Mizzoo?\" Randy asked, fascinated.\n\n\"After I dust, she follow me around with white gloves to see has I dusted. I know I cleans clean, Mister Randy.\"\n\n\"You sure do, Mizzoo.\"\n\nMissouri plugged in the vacuum cleaner, started it, and then shut it off. She had more on her mind. \"That ain't all. You been in that house, Mister Randy. You ever seen so many ashtrays?\"\n\n\"What's wrong with ashtrays?\"\n\n\"She don't allow no ashes in 'em. That poor Mister McGovern, he has to smoke his cigars outside. Then there was that roach. Big roach in the silver drawer. Mrs. McGovern opened that drawer yesterday and saw that roach and screeched like she'd been hit by a scorpion. She made me go through every drawer in the kitchen and dining room and put down fresh paper. Was that roach sent me to Doctor Gunn yesterday. Mrs. McGovern she can't 'bide bugs or little green lizards and she won't go out of the house after dark for fear of snakes. I don't think the McGoverns going to be with us long, Mister Randy, because what's Florida except bugs and lizards and snakes? I think they leave around May, when bug season starts good. But Miss McGovern, she won't want to leave. She stuck on you.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so?\"\n\nMissouri smiled. \"Questions she asks. Like what you eats for breakfast.\" Missouri glanced at the decanter on the bar. \"And who cooks for you. And does you have other girls.\"\n\nRandy changed the subject \"You say you went to see Doctor Gunn. What'd he say?\"\n\n\"Doctor says I'm a complicated case. He says I got high blood, on account of I'm heavy. He says it's good I'm losin' weight, because that lowers the high blood, but frettin' about Mrs. McGovern white-glovin' me is the wrong way to do it. He says quit eatin' grits, eat greens. Quit pork, eat fish. And he gives me tranquil pills to take, one each day before I go to work for Mrs. McGovern.\"\n\n\"You do that, Mizzoo,\" Randy said, and, carrying his mug, walked out on to the screen upstairs porch overlooking grove and river. He then climbed the narrow ship's ladder that led to the captain's walk, a rectangle sixteen by eight feet, stoutly planked and railed, on the slate roof. Reputedly, this was the highest spot in Timucuan County. From it he could see all the riverfront estates, docks, and boats, and all of the town of Fort Repose, three miles downstream, held in a crook of sun-flecked silver where the Timucuan joined the broader St. Johns.\n\nThis was his town, or had been. In 1838, during the Seminole Wars, a Lieutenant Randolph Rowzee Peyton, USN, a Virginian, had been dispatched to this river junction with a force of eighteen Marines and two small brass cannon. Lieutenant Peyton journeyed south from Cow's Ford, its name patriotically changed to Jacksonville, by longboat. His orders from General Clinch were to throttle Indian communications on the rivers, thus protecting the flank of the troops moving down the east coast from St. Augustine. Lieutenant Peyton built a blockhouse of palm logs on the point, his guns covering the channel. In two years, except during one relief expedition overland to New Smyrna, he fought no battles or skirmishes. But he shot game and caught fish for the garrison pot, and studied botany and the culture of citrus. The balmy weather and idyllic life, described in a log now in a teak chest in Randy Bragg's office, inspired the Lieutenant to name his outpost Fort Repose.\n\nWhen the wars subsided, the fort was decommissioned and Lieutenant Peyton was assigned to sea duty. Four years later he returned to Fort Repose with a wife, a daughter, and a grant from the government for one hundred acres. He had picked this precise spot for his homestead because it was the highest ground in the area, with a steep gradient to the river, ideal for planting the oranges just imported from Spain and the Far East. Peyton's original house had burned. The present house had been built by his son-in-law, the first Marcus Bragg, a native of Philadelphia and a lawyer eventually sent to the Senate. The captain's walk had been added for the aging Lieutenant Peyton, so that with his brass spyglass he could observe what happened at the junction of rivers.\n\nNow the Bragg holdings had dwindled to thirty-six acres, but thirty were planted in prime citrus--navels, mandarins, Valencias, and Temples--all tended and sold in season by the county co-operative. Each year Randy received checks totaling eight to ten thousand dollars from the co-operative. Half went to his older brother, Mark, an Air Force colonel stationed at Offutt Field, Headquarters of the Strategic Air Command, near Omaha. With his share, plus dividends from a trust established by his father, and his occasional fees as an attorney, Randy lived comfortably. Since he drove a new car and paid his bills promptly, the tradespeople of Fort Repose thought him well-to-do. The rich newcomers classed him with the genteel poor.\n\nRandy heard music below, and knew that Missouri had started his record player and therefore was waxing the floor. Missouri's method was to spread the wax, kick off her shoes, wrap her feet in rags, and then polish by dancing. This was probably as efficient, and certainly more fun, than using the electric waxer.\n\nHe dropped into a deck chair and focused his binoculars on Preacher Henry's place, looking for that damn bird in the hammock of pines, palmettos, and scrub oak. The Henrys had lived here as long as the Braggs, for the original Henry had come as slave and manservant to Lieutenant Peyton. Now the Henrys owned a four-acre enclave at the east boundary of the Bragg groves. Preacher Henry's father had bought it from Randolph's grandfather for fifty dollars an acre long before the first boom, when land was valued only for what it grew. Preacher was hitching his mule, Balaam--the last mule in Timucuan County so far as anyone knew--to the disk. In this month Preacher harrowed for his yam and corn planting, while his wife, Hannah, picked and sold tomatoes and put up kumquat preserves. He ought to go down and talk to Preacher about that damn bird, Randy thought. If anyone was likely to observe and recognize a Carolina parakeet floating around, it was Preacher, because Preacher knew all the birds and their calls and habits. He shifted his glasses to focus on the end of the Henrys' rickety dock. Two-Tone had five bamboo poles out. Two-Tone himself reclined on his side, head resting on his hand, so he could watch the corks without effort. Preacher's younger son, Malachai, who was Randy's yardman, and reliable as Two-Tone was no-account, was not about.\n\nRandy heard the phone ringing in his office. The music stopped and he knew Missouri was answering. Presently she called from the piazza, \"Mister Randy, it's for you. It's Western Union.\"\n\n\"Tell her I'll be right down,\" Randy said, lifted himself out of the deck chair, and backed down the ladder, wondering who would be sending him a telegram. It wasn't his birthday. If something important happened, people phoned. Unless--he remembered that the Air Force sent telegrams when a man was hurt, or killed. But it wouldn't be Mark, because for two years Mark had been flying a desk. Still, Mark would get in his flying time each month, if possible, for the extra pay.\n\nHe took the phone from Missouri's hand and braced himself. \"Yes?\" he said.\n\n\"I have a telegram, Randy--it's really a cable--from San Juan, Puerto Rico. It's signed by Mark. It's really very peculiar.\"\n\nRandy let out his breath, relieved. If Mark had sent the message, then Mark was all right. A man can't pick his relatives, only his friends, but Mark had always been Randy's friend as well as brother. \"What's the message say?\"\n\n\"Well, I'll read it to you,\" Florence said, \"and then if you want me to read it again I'll be glad to. It says, 'Urgent you meet me at Base Ops McCoy noon today. Helen and children flying to Orlando tonight. Alas, Babylon.'\" Florence paused. \"That's what it says, 'Alas, Babylon.' Do you want me to repeat the whole thing for you, Randy?\"\n\n\"No thanks.\"\n\n\"I wonder what 'Alas, Babylon' means? Isn't it out of the Bible?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I guess so.\" He knew very well what it meant. He felt sick inside.\n\n\"There's something else, Randy.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's nothing. I'll tell you about it next time I see you--and I hope not in those loud pajamas. Goodbye, Randy. You're sure you have the message?\"\n\n\"I'm sure,\" he said, hung up and dropped into the swivel chair. Alas, Babylon was a private, a family signal. When they were boys, he and Mark used to sneak up to the back of the First Afro-Repose Baptist Church on Sunday nights to hear Preacher Henry calling down hell-fire and damnation on the sinners in the big cities. Preacher Henry always took his text out of the Revelation of St. John. It seemed that he ended every lurid verse with, \"Alas, Babylon!\" in a voice so resonant you could feel it, if you rested your fingertips gently on the warped pine boards of the church. Randy and Mark would crouch under the rear window, behind the pulpit, fascinated and wide-eyed, while Preacher Henry described the Babylonian revels, including fornication. Sometimes Preacher Henry made Babylon sound like Miami, and sometimes like Tampa, for he condemned not only fornication--he read the word right out of the Bible--but also horse racing and the dog tracks. Randy could hear him yet: \"And I'm telling you right now, all wife-swappers, whisky-drinkers, and crap-shooters are going to get it! And all them who come out of those sin palaces on the beach, whether they be called hotels or motels, wearing minks and jewels and not much else, they is goin' to get it! And them fast-steppers in Cadillacs and yaller roadsters, they is going to get it! Just like it says here in the Good Book, that Great City that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, that Great City was burned off the face of the earth in an hour. Just one hour. Alas, Babylon!\"\n\nEither Preacher Henry was too old, or the Afro-Repose congregation had tired of his scolding and awful prophecies, for he no longer preached except on those Sundays when Afro-Repose's new minister, a light-skinned college graduate, was out of town. Randy and Mark never forgot Preacher Henry's thundering, and from it they borrowed their private synonym for disaster, real or comic, past or future. If one fell off the dock, or lost all his cash at poker, or failed to make time with a promising Pistolville piece, or announced that hurricane or freeze was on the way, the other commiserated with, \"Alas, Babylon!\"\n\nBut in this telegram it had very special and exact meaning. Mark had secured leave at Christmas season last year, and flown down with Helen and the two children, Ben Franklin and Peyton, for a week. On their last evening at Fort Repose, after the others were in bed, Mark and Randy had sat here, in this office, peering into the bourbon decanter and the deep anxieties of their hearts, trying to divine the future. Christmas had been a time of troubles, a time of confusions at home and tensions abroad, but in his whole life, Randy could recall no other sort of time. There had always been depression, or war, or threat of war.\n\nMark, who was in SAC Intelligence, had rolled the old-fashioned globe, three feet through, from its place in the window bay, so that the desk lamp shone on it. It was a globe purchased by their grandfather, the diplomat, before the First World War, so that the countries, some with unfamiliar names, seemed oddly scrambled. The continents and seas were the same, which was all that mattered. As Mark talked, his face became grave, almost gaunt, and his index finger traced great circle routes across the cracking surface--missile and bomber trajectories. He then drew a rough chart, with two lines that intersected. The line that continued upward after the intersection belonged to the Soviet Union, and the time of the intersection was right then.\n\n\"How did it happen?\" Randy had asked. \"Where did we slip?\"\n\n\"It wasn't lack of money,\" Mark had replied. \"It was state of mind. Chevrolet mentalities shying away from a space-ship world. Nations are like people. When they grow old and rich and fat they get conservative. They exhaust their energy trying to keep things the way they are--and that's against nature. Oh, the services were to blame too. Maybe even SAC. We designed the most beautiful bombers in the world, and built them by the thousands. We improved and modified them each year, like new model cars. We couldn't bear the thought that jet bombers themselves might be out of style. Right now we're in the position of the Federal Navy, with its wooden steam frigates, up against the Confederate iron-clad. It is a state of mind that money alone won't cure.\"\n\n\"What will?\" Randy asked.\n\n\"Men. Men like John Ericsson to invent a Monitor to face the Merrimac. Bold men, audacious men, tenacious men. Impatient, odd-ball men like Rickover pounding desks for his atomic sub. Ruthless men who will fire the deadheads and ass-kissers. Rude men who will tell the unimaginative, business-as-usual, seven-carbon sons of bitches to go take a jump at a galloping goose. Young men because we've got to be a young country again. If we get that kind of men we may hack it--if the other side gives us time.\"\n\n\"Will they?\"\n\nMark had spun the globe and shrugged. \"I don't know. If I think the balloon is about to go up I'm going to send Helen and the kids down here. When a man dies, and his children die with him, then he is dead entirely, leaving nothing to show.\"\n\n\"Do you think they'd be safer here than in Omaha? After all, we've got the Jax Naval Air complex to the north of us, and Homestead and Miami to the south, and Eglin to the northwest, and MacDill and Tampa to the southwest, and the Missile Test Center on Canaveral to the east, and McCoy and Orlando right at the front door, only forty miles off. What about fallout?\"\n\n\"There isn't any place that'll be absolutely safe. With fallout and radiation, it'll be luck--the size of configuration of the weapons, altitude of the fireball, direction of the wind. But I do know Helen and the children won't have much chance in Omaha. SAC Headquarters has got to be the enemy's number one target. I'll bet they've programmed three five-megaton IC's for Offutt, and since our house is eight miles from the base any kind of near-miss does it--\" Mark snapped his fingers--\"like that. Not that I think it'll do the enemy any good--command automatically shifts to other combat control centers and anyway all our crews know their targets. But they'll hit SAC Headquarters, hoping for temporary paralysis. A little delay is all they'd need. I'll have to be there, at Offutt, in the Hole, but the least a man can do is give his children a chance to grow up, and I think they'd have a better chance in Fort Repose than Omaha. So if I see it's coming, and there is time, I'll send Helen and the kids down here. And I'll try to give you a warning, so you can get set for it.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\nMark smiled. \"I won't call you up and say, 'Hey, Randy, the Russians are about to attack us.' Phones aren't secure, and I don't think my C-in-C, or the Air Staff, would approve. But if you hear 'Alas, Babylon,' you'll know that's it.\"\n\nRandy had forgotten none of this talk. A week or so later, thinking about Mark's words, Randy had decided to go into politics. He would start in the state legislature, and in a few years be ready to run for Congress. He'd be the kind of leader Mark wanted.\n\nIt hadn't worked out that way. He couldn't even beat Porky Logan, a gross man whose vote could be bought for fifty bucks, who bragged that he had not got beyond the seventh grade but that he could get more new roads and state money for Timucuan County than any half-baked radical, undoubtedly backed by the burrheads and the N.A.A.C.P., who didn't even know that the Supreme Court was controlled by Moscow. So Randy's fiasco had been inspired by that night, and now the night bore something worse.\n\nHe wondered what Mark was doing in Puerto Rico, and why his warning had come from there. It should have come from Washington or London or Omaha or Colorado Springs rather than San Juan. It was true that SAC had a big base, Ramey, in Puerto Rico, but--It was no use guessing. He'd know at noon. Of one thing he was certain, if Mark expected it to come, it would probably come. His brother was no alarmist. Randy sometimes allowed emotions to distort logic, Mark never did. Mark was capable of calculating odds, in war or poker, to the final decimal, which was why he was a Deputy Chief of Intelligence at SAC, and soon would have his star.\n\nRandy knew there were a thousand things he should be doing, but he couldn't think of any of them. He became aware of a rhumba rhythm in the living room, and presently Missouri skated into view, feet bundled with waxing cloths, shoulders moving and hips bouncing with elephantine elegance, intent on her polishing. He yelled, \"Missouri!\"\n\n\"Yessir?\" Her forward motion stopped, but her hips continued to wobble and feet shuffle.\n\n\"Quit that struttin' and make up the three bedrooms on the front. Colonel Bragg's family will be here tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Oh, ain't that nice! Just like last year.\"\n\n\"No, not like last year. The Colonel's not coming with them. Just Mrs. Bragg and Ben Franklin and Peyton.\"\n\nMissouri peered through the door at him. \"Mister Randy, you don't look good. Them telegrams are yellow death. You get bad news or something? Ain't nuthin' happen to Colonel Mark?\"\n\n\"No. I'm driving over to McCoy to meet him at noon.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's good. How come the children up north get out of school so quick?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"I'll dust good, and make up the beds, and put towels and soaps in the bathrooms just like last year.\"\n\n\"Thanks, Mizzoo. That's fine.\"\n\n\"Caleb's going to be happy to see Ben Franklin,\" Missouri said. Caleb was Missouri's son, and just Ben's age, thirteen. Last year, Randy had let them take the boat out on the river, fishing, just as Randy, as a boy, had fished with Caleb's uncle, Malachai, except that twenty years ago the boat was a skiff, powered by muscle and oars, instead of a sleek Fiberglas job with a thirty-horse kicker.\n\nMissouri gathered up her cleaning materials and left Randy alone with his nightmare. He shook his head, but he didn't wake up. The nightmare was real. Slowly, he forced his mind to function. Slowly, he forced himself to imagine the unimaginable....\n\nHe must make a list of the things Helen and the children would need. He recalled that there was nothing stocked in the big kitchen downstairs, and little in the utility room except some steaks in the freezer and a few canned staples. My God, if there was going to be a war they'd need stocks of everything! He looked at his watch. He had yet to shave and dress, and he must allow an hour and a half for the drive to McCoy, ten miles south of Orlando, when you considered the main highways clogged with tourists, and Orlando's infuriating and hopeless traffic tangle on a sunny payday less than three weeks before Christmas. And there might be some delay at the McCoy gate. He decided to give himself two hours on the road.\n\nStill, he could start the list, and there was one thing he should do right away. Ben Franklin drank a quart of milk a day and Peyton, his eleven-year-old sister, even more. He telephoned Golden Dew Dairy and revised his delivery order drastically upward. This was Randy's first act to meet the emergency, and it was to prove the least useful.\n\nChapter Two\n\nRandy left the house in time to see Missouri wedge herself under the wheel of the Henrys' Model-A Ford, an antique--so certified with a \"Q\" tag issued by the state--but kept in perfect running order by Malachai's mechanical ingenuity. \"I haven't finished but I got to go now,\" she said. \"Mrs. McGovern, she holds the clock on me. I'll be back tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Model-A, listing to port with Missouri's weight, bounced down the pebbled driveway. Randy got into his new Bonneville. It was a sweet car, a compromise between a sports job and a hardtop, long, low, very fast, and a lot of fun, even though its high-compression engine drank premium fuel in quantity.\n\nAt eleven, approaching Orlando on Route 50, he turned on the radio for the news. Turkey had appealed to the UN for an investigation of border penetrations by Syria. Syria charged Israel with planning a preventive war. Israel accused Egypt of sending snooper planes over its defenses. Egypt claimed its ships, bound from the Black Sea to Alexandria, were being delayed in the Straits, and charged Turkey with a breach of the Montreux Convention.\n\nRussia accused Turkey and the United States of plotting to crush Syria, and warned France, Italy, Greece, and Spain that any nations harboring American bases would be involved in a general war, and erased from the earth.\n\nThe Secretary of State was somewhere over the Atlantic, bound for conferences in London.\n\nThe Soviet Ambassador to Washington had been recalled for consultation.\n\nThere were riots in France.\n\nIt all sounded bad, but familiar as an old, scratchy record. He had heard it all before, in almost the same words, back in '57 and '58. So why push the panic button? Mark could be wrong. He couldn't know, for certain, that the balloon was going up. Unless he knew something fresh, something that had not appeared in the newspapers, or been broadcast.\n\n****\n\nShortly before noon Florence Wechek hung her \"Back At One\" sign on the office door and walked down Yulee Street to meet Alice Cooksey at the Pink Flamingo. Fridays, they always lunched together. Alice, tiny, drab in black and gray, an active, angry sparrow of a woman, arrived late. She hurried to Florence's table and said, \"I'm sorry. I've just had a squabble with Kitty Offenhaus.\"\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" Florence said. \"Again?\" Kitty was secretary of the PTA, past-president of the Frangipani Circle, treasurer of the Women's Club, and a member of the library board. Also, she was the wife of Luther \"Bubba\" Offenhaus, Chief Tail-Twister of the Lions Club, Vice President of the Chamber of Commerce, and Deputy Director of Civil Defense for the whole county. He owned the most properous business in town, the Offenhaus Mortuary, and a twin real estate development, Repose-in-Peace Park.\n\nAlice lifted the menu. It fluttered. She set it down quickly and said, \"Yes, again. I guess I'll have the tunafish salad.\"\n\n\"You should eat more, Alice,\" Florence said, noticing how white and pinched her friend's face looked. \"What happened?\"\n\n\"Kitty came in and said she'd heard rumors that we had books by Carl Rowan and Walter White. I told her the rumors were true, and did she want to borrow one?\"\n\n\"What'd she say?\" Florence put down her fork, no longer interested in her chicken patty.\n\n\"Said they were subversive and anti-South--she's a Daughter of the Confederacy--and ordered me to take them off the shelves. I told her that as long as I was librarian they would stay there. She said she was going to bring it before the board and if necessary take it up with Porky Logan. He's on the investigating committee in Tallahassee.\"\n\n\"Alice, you're going to lose your job!\" Kitty Offenhaus was the most influential person in Fort Repose, with the exception of Edgar Quisenberry, who owned and ran the bank.\n\n\"I don't think so. I told her that if anything like that happened I'd call the St. Petersburg Times and Tampa Tribune and Miami Herald and they'd send reporters and photographers. I said, 'Kitty, can't you see your picture on the front page, and the headline--Undertaker's Wife Cremates Books?'\"\n\nThis was the most fascinating news Florence had heard in weeks. \"What happened then?\"\n\n\"Nothing at all. If I may borrow an expression from one of my younger readers, she left in an eight-cylinder huff.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't really call the papers, would you?\"\n\nAlice spoke carefully, understanding fully that everything would soon be repeated. \"I certainly would! But I don't think I'll have to. You see, publicity would hurt Bubba's business. One third of Bubba's customers are Negroes, and another third Yankees who come down here to live on their pensions and stay to die.\" She lifted her bright, fiercely blue eyes and added, as if repeating one of the Commandments: \"Censorship and thought control can exist only in secrecy and darkness.\"\n\n\"And that was all?\"\n\n\"That was all.\" Alice tried her salad. \"What've you been doing, Florence?\"\n\nFlorence could think of no adventure, or even any news culled from the wire, that could compete with telling off Kitty Offenhaus--except her experience with Randy Bragg. She had pledged herself not to say anything about Randy to anyone, but she could trust Alice, who was worldly-wise in spite of her appearance, and who might even, when younger, have encountered a Peeping Tom herself. So Florence told about Randy and his binoculars and how he had stared at her that morning. \"It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?\" she concluded.\n\n\"It is unbelievable,\" Alice said flatly.\n\n\"But I saw him at it!\"\n\n\"I don't care. I know the Bragg boys. Even before you came here, Florence, I knew them. I knew Judge Bragg well, very well.\"\n\nFlorence remembered vague reports, many years back, of Alice Cooksey having gone with Judge Bragg before the judge married Gertrude. But that made no difference to what went on in the Bragg house now. \"You'll have to admit that those Bragg boys are a little peculiar,\" Florence said. \"You should have seen the cable Randy got from Mark this morning. Urgent they meet at McCoy today. Helen and the children flying to Orlando tonight--you know those children can't be out of school yet--and the last two words didn't make any sense at all. 'Alas, Babylon.' Isn't that crazy?\"\n\n\"Those boys aren't crazy,\" Alice said. \"They've always been bright boys. Full of hell, yes, but at least they could read, which is more then I can say for the children nowadays. Do you know that Randy read every history in the library before he was sixteen?\"\n\n\"I don't think that has anything to do with his sex habits,\" Florence said. She leaned across the table and touched Alice's arm. \"Alice, come out to my house tonight for the weekend. I want you to see for yourself.\"\n\n\"I can't. I keep the library open Saturdays. That's my only chance to get the young ones. Evenings and Sundays, they're paralyzed by TV.\"\n\n\"I'm open Saturday mornings, too, so we can drive in together. I'll pick you up when you're through tomorrow evening. It'll be a change for you, out in the country, away from that stuffy room.\"\n\nAlice hesitated. It would be nice to visit with Florence, but she hated to accept favors she couldn't repay. She said, \"Well, we'll see.\"\n\n****\n\nWhen Alice returned to the library, three old-timers, too old for shuffleboard or the Lawn Bowlers Club, were bent over the periodical table. Like mummies, she thought, partially unwrapped. One of the mummies leaned slowly over until his nose fell into the fold of Cosmopolitan. Alice walked over to the table and made certain he still breathed. She let him nap on, smiled at the other two, and darted into the reference room, with its towering, topheavy stacks. From the first stack, religious and spiritual works in steady demand, she brought down the King James Bible. She believed she would find the words in Revelation, and she did. She read two verses, lips moving, words murmuring in her throat:\n\nAnd the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,\n\nStanding afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.\n\nAlice put the Bible back on its shelf and walked, head down, to her cracked oak desk, like a schoolmarm's desk on a dais, in the main hallway. She sat there, staring at the green blotter, at the antiquated pen and the glass inkwell, at the wooden file filled with readers' cards, at the stack of publishers' spring lists. Alone of all the people in Fort Repose, Alice Cooksey knew Mark Bragg well enough, and had absorbed sufficient knowledge of the world's illness through the printed word, to understand that the books she had ordered from those spring lists might never be delivered. She had small fear of death, and of man none at all, but the formlessness of what was to come overwhelmed her. She always associated Babylon with New York, and she wished, now, that she lived on Manhattan, where one could die in a bright millisecond, without suffering, without risking the indignity of panic.\n\nShe picked up the telephone and called Florence. She would come out for the weekend, or even longer, if Florence was agreeable. When she set down the phone Alice felt steadier. If it came soon, she would have a friendly hand to hold. She would not be alone.\n\nThe Air Police sergeant at McCoy's main gate questioned Randy, and then allowed him to call Lieutenant Colonel Paul Hart, a squadron commander, and friend of Mark's. Hart had been to Fort Repose to fish for bass, first as Mark's guest, and later, on several occasions, as a guest of Randy, so he was something more than an acquaintance. Randy said he had had a wire from Mark to meet him at noon, and Hart said, \"He whistled through here yesterday. Didn't expect him back so soon. Anyway, drive to Base Ops. We'll go out on the line and meet him together. Let me talk to the Air Police. I'll clear you through.\"\n\nDriving through the base, Randy sensed a change since his last visit, the year before. Physically, McCoy looked the same. It felt different. The Air Police questioning had been sharper, and more serious. That wasn't the difference. He realized something was missing; and then he had it. Where were all the people? McCoy seemed almost deserted, with less activity, and fewer men and fewer cars than a year ago. He saw no other civilians. He saw no women, not even around the clubs and the BX. The most congested area on the base was the steps and lawn in front of the alert barracks opposite wing headquarters, where standby crewmen, rigid and stiff in pressure suits, talked and smoked. Trucks, tail gates down, were backed to the curb. Drivers slouched over their wheels as if they had been there a long time.\n\nHe drove onto Base Operations and parked close to the flight-line fence. Last year he had seen B-47's, tankers, and fat transports stretching their wings, tip to tip, the length of the line--miles. Now, their numbers had dwindled. He counted fewer than twenty B-47's, and guessed that the wing was in Africa or Spain or England on ninety-day foreign duty. But this could not be so, because Paul Hart, winner of bombing and navigation trophies, a Select Crew Aircraft Commander, would have led the flight.\n\nHart, a stocky, bandy-legged man with punched-in nose, a fighter's chin, and an easy grin, met him at the door of Operations. \"Hi, Randy,\" he said. \"Just checked the board. Mark will touch down in eight minutes. How's the fishing?\"\n\n\"It's been lousy.\" He looked up at the wind sock. \"But it'll get better if this high sticks around and the wind holds from the east. What's he flying?\"\n\n\"He's not flying anything. He's riding soft and plush in a C-One-thirty-five--that's the transport version of our new jet tanker--with a lot of Offutt brass. Other brass, that is. I hear he gets his star soon. Only promotion I'll ever get is to a B-Five-eight.\"\n\n\"Penalty for being a hot pilot,\" Randy said. \"What's going on around here? Looks like a ghost town. You boys shutting up shop?\"\n\n\"You haven't heard about SAC's interim dispersal?\"\n\n\"Vaguely, yes, on some of the commentaries.\"\n\n\"Well, we're not shouting about it. We try to keep half the wing off this base, because where we're standing right now is a primary target. We farm out our planes to fighter fields and Navy fields and even commercial airports. And we try to keep ten percent of the wing airborne at all times, and if you look down there in front of the jumbo hangar you'll see four standby Forty-sevens, bombed up and ready to go. Damn expensive way to run an air force.\"\n\nRandy looked. They were there, wings drooping with full tanks, bound to earth by slender umbilical cords, the starter cables. \"I didn't mean the planes so much as the people,\" Randy said. \"Where's everybody?\"\n\n\"Oh, that.\" Hart frowned, as if deciding how much could be said and what words to use. \"The papers know about it but they aren't printing it,\" he said finally, \"and the people around Orlando must know about it by now so it can't be any great secret. We've been on sort of a modified alert for four or five weeks. Maybe I should call it a creeping evacuation. We've cleared the area of all civilian and nonessential personnel, and we're encouraging everybody to move their families out of the blast zone. You see, Randy, we can't expect three to six hours' warning any more. If we're lucky, we might get fifteen minutes.\"\n\nRandy nodded. He noticed long red missiles slung under the wings of the standby B-47's. He recognized them, from the newspaper photographs, as the Rascal, an air-to-ground H-bomb carrier. \"Is that red baby much help?\" he asked.\n\n\"That red baby,\" Hart said, \"is what we call the crew-saver. The Russkies are no dopes. They'll try to stop us with missiles air-to-air and ground-to-air, beam-riders, heat-seekers, sound-finders, and, for all I know, smellers. It'll be no milk run but with the Rascal--and some other gadgets--we don't have to write ourselves off as a kamikaze corps. We won't have to penetrate their inner defense zones. We can lay off target and let that red baby fly. It knows where to go. Do you know what?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nPaul Hart's smile had vanished, and he looked older, and when he spoke it was gravely. \"When the whistle blows, I'll have a better chance if I'm in my aircraft, headed for target, than if I'm sitting at home with my feet propped up, drinking a Scotch, and Martha rubbing the kinks out of my neck--and our little place on the lake is five miles from here. So I'm a man of peace. I wish Martha and the kids lived in Fort Repose.\"\n\nRandy heard the low whine of jet engines at fractional power and saw a cigar-shaped C-135 line up with the runway in its swoop downward. Presently it wheeled into a taxi strip and braked in front of Operations. A flag, three white stars on a blue field, popped out of the cockpit, indicating that a lieutenant general was aboard, and alerting McCoy to provide the courtesies due such rank.\n\nThe three-star general was first down the ramp, his pink-cheeked aide scurrying about his heels like an anxious puppy. Mark was last off. Randy waved and caught his eye and Mark waved back but did not smile. Coming down the ramp and across the concrete, knees bare in tropical uniform, Mark looked like a slightly larger edition of Randy, an inch taller, a shade broader. At thirty feet they looked like twins, with the same jet hair, white teeth behind mobile lips, quizzical eyes set deep, the same rakish walk and swing of shoulders, cleft in chin and emphatic nose with a bony bump on the bridge. At three feet, fine, deep lines showed around Mark's eyes and mouth, gray appeared in his black thicket, his jaw thrust out an extra half-inch, his face was leaner. At three feet, they were entirely different, and it was apparent Mark was the older, harder, and probably wiser man.\n\nMark put one hand on Hart's shoulder and the other on Randy's, and walked them toward the building. \"Paul,\" he told Hart, \"you better get with General Heycock. He's hungry and when he gets hungry he gets fierce. How about helping his aide dig up some transport and get him over to the O Club? We're only here to gas up. Takeoff is in fifty minutes.\"\n\nHart looked up and saw three blue Air Force sedans swing up the driveway. \"There's the General's transport right there,\" he said, and then, realizing that Mark had tactfully implied he wanted to be alone with his brother, added, \"But I'll go along to the O Club, and get the mess officer on the ball.\" He shook hands and said, \"See you, Mark, next time around.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" Mark said. He turned to Randy. \"Where's your car? I've got a lot to say and not much time to say it. We can talk in the car. But first let's get some candy, or something, inside Ops. We didn't load any flight lunches at Ramey.\"\n\nThe front seat of the Bonneville was like a sunny, comfortable private office. Randy asked the essential question first: \"What time do Helen and the children get in?\"\n\nMark brought a notebook out of his hip pocket. \"Three-thirty tomorrow morning, local time, at Orlando Municipal. Carmody--he's Wing Commander at Ramey--has a friend in the Eastern office in San Juan. He ramrodded it through for me. The plane leaves Omaha at seven-ten tonight. One change, in Chicago.\"\n\n\"Isn't that a little rough on Helen and the kids?\"\n\n\"They can sleep all the way from Chicago to Orlando. It'll be just as tough on you, meeting them. The important thing is I got the reservation. This time of year, it took some doing.\"\n\n\"What's the great rush?\" Randy demanded. \"What the hell's going on?\"\n\n\"Contain yourself, son,\" Mark said. \"I'm going to give you a complete briefing.\"\n\n\"Have you told Helen yet?\"\n\n\"I sent her a cable from San Juan. Just told her I'd made reservations for tonight. She'll understand.\" He squinted at the gaudy dials and gleaming knobs on the dash. \"Some buggy you've got here, Randy. Won't be worth a damn to you. About Helen, she and I thrashed all this out long ago, but she won't like it. Not at all will she like it, now that the time has come. But I'll have her on that plane if I have to truss her up and send her air freight.\"\n\nRandy said nothing. He simply tapped the car clock, a reminder.\n\n\"Okay,\" Mark said, \"I'll brief you. First strategic, then tactical.\" He pushed a peanut-butter cracker into his mouth, found his pen, and began to sketch in his notebook. He drew a rough map, the Mediterranean.\n\nMark doesn't cerebrate until he has a pen in his hand, Randy thought, and can see a map. Probably makes him feel comfortable, like he's holding a pointer in the SAC War Room.\n\n\"The key is the Med,\" Mark said. \"For three hundred years the Russians have tried to pry open the Straits and debouch into the Mediterranean. Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Czar Alexander, they all tried it. Now, more than ever, control of the Med means control of the world.\"\n\nRandy nodded. Conquerors knew or sensed this. Caesar had done it, Xerxes, Napoleon, and Hitler failed. \"If Xerxes had won at Salamis,\" he said, \"we'd all be speaking Persian--but that was a long time pre-Sputnik, and pre-ICBM. I thought the fight, now, was for control of space. Who controls space controls the world.\"\n\nMark smiled. \"It can also happen just the other way around. We--by we I mean the NATO coalition--aren't going to be allowed time to catch up with them in operational IC's, much less control space. Now don't argue with me. We have their War Plan.\"\n\nRandy took a deep breath and sat up straight.\n\n\"For the first time Russia has bridgeheads in the Mediterranean--here, here, and here--\" Mark drew ovals on the map. \"They have a fleet in the Med as powerful as ours when you match their submarine strength against our carriers. They have Turkey ringed on three sides, and if they could upset the Turkish government, and force capitulation of the Bosporus and Dardanelles, they would have won the war without fighting. The Med would be theirs, Africa cut off from Europe, NATO outflanked on the south, and one by one all our allies--except England--would fall into their laps or declare themselves neutral. SAC's bases in Africa and Spain would be untenable and melt away. NATO would fold up, and the IR sites we're planning never be finished.\"\n\n\"That was their gambit in 'fifty-seven, wasn't it?\" Randy asked.\n\n\"You have a good memory, Randy, and that's a good simile. The Russians are great chess players. They rarely make the same mistake twice. Now, today, they're making moves. It's the same gambit--but with a tremendous difference. In 'fifty-seven, when it looked like they were going to make another Korea out of Turkey, we warned the Kremlin that there'd be no sanctuary inside Russia. They took a look at the board and resigned the game. Then in 'fifty-eight, after the Iraq king was assassinated, we grabbed the initiative and landed Marines in Lebanon. We got there fastest. They saw that we were ready, and could not be surprised. They were caught off balance, and didn't dare move. This time it's different. They're ready to go through with it, because the odds have changed.\"\n\n\"How can you know this?\"\n\n\"Remember reading about the Russian General who came over, in Berlin? An air general, a shrewd character, a human being. He brought us their War Plan, in his head. This time, they're not resigning the game. They'd still like to win the war without a war, but if we make any military countermove, we're going to receive it.\"\n\nFor a moment, they were both silent. On the other side of the flight-line fence, three ground-crewmen were throwing a baseball. Two were pitching, an older sergeant, built like Yogi Berra, catching. The plate was a yellow parachute pack. The ball whirred and plopped sharply into mitt. \"That tall boy has a lot of stuff,\" Randy said. Again, he felt he moved in the miasma of a dream. Something was wrong. Either Mark shouldn't be talking like this, or those airmen shouldn't be throwing a baseball out there in the warm sunlight. When he lit a cigarette, his fingers were trembling again.\n\n\"Have a bad night, Randy?\"\n\n\"Not particularly. I'm having a bad day.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid it's going to get worse. Here's the tactical part. They know that the only way they can do it is knock off our nuclear capability with one blow--or at least cripple us so badly that they can accept what retaliatory power we have left. They don't mind losing ten or twenty million people, so long as they sweep the board, because people, per se, are only pawns, and expendable. So their plan--it was no surprise to us--calls for a T.O.T. on a worldwide scale. You get it?\"\n\n\"Sure. Time-on-target. You don't fire everything at the same instant. You shoot it so it all arrives on target at the same instant.\"\n\nMark glanced at his watch, and then looked up at the big jet transport, still loading fuel through four hoses from the underground tanks. \"That's right. It won't be Zero Hour, it'll be Zero Minute. They'll use no planes in the first wave, only missiles. They plan to kill every base and missile site in Europe and Africa and the U.K. with their T-2 and T-3 IR's. They plan to kill every base on this continent, and in the Pacific, with their IC's, plus missiles launched from subs. Then they use SUSAC--that's what we call their Strategic Air Force--to mop up.\"\n\n\"Can they get away with it?\"\n\n\"Three years ago they couldn't. Three years hence, when we have our own ICBM batteries emplaced, a big fleet of missile-toting subs, and Nike-Zeus and some other stuff perfected, they couldn't. But right now we're in what we call 'the gap.' Theoretically, they figure they can do it. I'm pretty sure they can't--we may have some surprises for them--but that's not the point. Point is, if they think they can get away with it, then we have lost.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\n\"LeMay says the only way a general can win a modern war is not fight one. Our whole raison d'être was deterrent force. When you don't deter them any longer, you lose. I think we lost some time ago, because the last five Sputniks have been reconnaisance satellites. They've been mapping us, with infrared and transitor television, measuring us for the Sunday punch.\"\n\nRandy felt angry. He felt cheated. \"Why hasn't anybody--everybody been told about this?\"\n\nMark shrugged. \"You know how it is--everything that comes in is stamped secret or top secret or cosmic or something and the only people who dare declassify anything are the big wheels right at the top, and the people at the top hold conferences and somebody says, 'Now, let's not be hasty. Let's not alarm the public.' So everything stays secret or cosmic. Personally, I think everybody ought to be digging or evacuating right this minute. Maybe if the other side knew we were digging, if they knew that we knew, they wouldn't try to get away with it.\"\n\n\"You really think it's that close?\" Randy said. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Two reasons. First, when I left Puerto Rico this morning Navy was trying to track three skunks--unidentified submarines--in the Caribbean, and one in the Gulf.\"\n\n\"Four subs doesn't sound like enough force to cause a big flap,\" Randy said.\n\n\"Four subs is a lot of subs when there shouldn't be any,\" Mark said. \"It's like shaking a haystack and having four needles pop out at your feet. Chances are that haystack is stiff with needles.\" He rubbed his hand across his eyes, as if the glare hurt, and when he spoke again his voice was strained. \"They've got so blasted many! CIA thinks six hundred, Navy guesses maybe seven-fifty. And they don't need launchers any more. Just dump the bird, or pop it out while still submerged. The ocean itself is a perfectly good launching pad.\"\n\nRandy said, \"And the other reason?\"\n\n\"Because I'm on my way back to Offutt. We flew down yesterday on a pretty important job--figure out a way to disperse the wing on Ramey. There aren't enough fields in Puerto Rico and anyway the island is rugged and not big enough. We'd just started our staff study when we got a zippo--that's an operational priority message--to come home. And two thirds of the Ramey wing was scrambled with flyaway kits for--another place. I made my decision right then. I just had time to arrange Helen's reservation and send the cables.\"\n\nMark spoke more of the Russian General, with whom he had talked at length, and whom apparently he liked. \"He isn't a traitor, either to his country or to civilization. He came over in desperation, hoping that somehow we could stop those power-crazed bastards at the top. He doesn't think their War Plan will work any more than I do. Too much chance for human or mechanical error.\" Mark used phrases like \"maximum capability,\" and \"calculated risk,\" and \"acceptance of any casualties except important people,\" and \"decentralization of industry and control, announced as an economic measure, but actually military.\"\n\nRandy listened, fascinated, until he saw three blue sedans turn a corner near wing headquarters. \"Here comes your party,\" he said. \"Anything else I ought to know?\"\n\nMark brushed cracker crumbs and slivers of chocolate from his shirt front. \"Yes. Also, there's something I have to give you.\" He found a green slip of paper in his wallet and handed it to Randy. \"Made out to you,\" he said.\n\nRandy unfolded the check. It was for five thousand. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" he asked.\n\n\"Cash it--today if you can. Don't deposit it, cash it! It's a reserve for Helen and Ben Franklin and Peyton. Buy stuff with it. I don't know what to tell you to buy. You'll think of what you'll need as you go along.\"\n\n\"I did start a list, this morning.\"\n\nMark seemed pleased. \"That's fine. Shows you're looking ahead. I don't know whether money will help Helen or not, but cash in hand, in Fort Repose, will be better than an account in an Omaha bank.\"\n\nRandy kept on looking at the check, feeling uncomfortable. \"But suppose nothing happens? Suppose--\"\n\n\"Spend some of it on a case of good liquor,\" Mark said. \"Then if nothing happens we'll have a wonderful, expensive toot together, and you can laugh at me. I won't care.\"\n\nRandy slipped the check into his pocket. \"Can I tip off anybody else? There are a few people--\"\n\n\"You've got a girl?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether she's my girl or not. I've been trying to find out. You don't know her. New people from Cleveland. Her family built on River Road.\"\n\nMark hesitated. \"I don't see any objection. It is something Civil Defense should have done weeks--months ago. Use your own judgment. Be discreet.\"\n\nRandy noticed that the jet transport's wings were clear of hoses. He saw the three blue sedans pull up at Operations. He saw Lieutenant General Heycock get out of the first car. He felt Mark's hand on his shoulder, and braced himself for the words he knew must come.\n\nMark spoke very quietly. \"You'll take care of Helen?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"I won't say be a good father to the children. They love you and they think you're swell and you couldn't be anything but a good father to them. But I will say this, be kind to Helen. She's--\" Mark was having trouble with his voice.\n\nRandy tried to help him out. \"She's a wonderful, beautiful gal, and you don't have to worry. Anyway, don't sound so final. You're not dead yet.\"\n\n\"She's--more,\" Mark said. \"She's my right arm. We've been married fourteen years and about half that time I've been up in the air or out of the country and I've never once worried about Helen. And she never had to worry about me. In fourteen years I never slept with another woman. I never even kissed another woman, not really, not even when I had duty in Tokyo or Manila or Hongkong, and she was half a world away. She was all the woman I ever needed. She was like this: Back when I was a captain and we were moving from rented apartment to rented apartment every year or so, I got a terrific offer from Boeing. She knew what I wanted. I didn't have to tell her. She said, 'I want you to stay in SAC. I think you should. I think you ought to be a general and you're going to be a general.' There's an old saying that anyone can make colonel on his own, but it takes a wife to make a general. I guess there wasn't quite enough time, but had there been time, she would've had her star.\"\n\nRandy saw Lieutenant General Heycock walk from the Operations building toward the plane. \"It's time, Mark,\" he said.\n\nThey got out of the car and walked quickly toward the gate, and Mark swung an arm around Randy's shoulders. \"What I mean is, she has tremendous energy and courage. If you let her, she'll give you the same kind of loyalty she gave me. Let her, Randy. She's all woman and that's what she's made for.\"\n\n\"Stop worrying,\" Randy said. He didn't quite understand and he didn't know what else to say.\n\nHeycock's aide fidgeted at the end of the ramp. \"Everybody's in, Colonel,\" he said. \"The General was looking for you at lunch. The General wondered what happened to you. He was most anxious--\"\n\n\"I'll see the General as soon as we're airborne,\" Mark said sharply.\n\nThe aide retreated two steps up the ramp, then waited stubbornly.\n\nThey shook hands. Mark said, \"Better try to catch a nap this evening.\"\n\n\"I will. When I get home shall I call Helen and tell her you're on the way?\"\n\n\"No. Not much use. This aircraft cruises at five-fifty. By the time you get back to Fort Repose, we'll be west of the Mississippi.\" He glanced down at his bare knees. \"Looks like I'll have to change into a real uniform on the aircraft. I'd look awfully funny in Omaha.\"\n\n\"So long, Mark.\"\n\nWithout raising his head, Mark said, \"Goodbye, Randy,\" turned away, and climbed the ramp.\n\nRandy walked away from the transport, got into his car, and drove slowly through the base. At the main gate he surrendered his visitor's pass. He turned into a lonely lane outside the base, near the village of Pinecastle, and stopped the car in a spot shielded by cabbage palms. When he was sure no one watched, and no car approached from either direction, he leaned his head on the wheel. He swallowed a sob and closed his eyes to forbid the tears.\n\nHe heard wind rustle the palms, and the chirp of cardinals in the brush. He became aware that the clock on the dash, blurred, was staring at him. The clock said he had just time to make the bank before closing, if he pushed hard and had luck getting through Orlando traffic. He started the engine, backed out of the lane into the highway, and let the car run. He knew he should not have spared time for tears, and would not, ever again.\n\nChapter Three\n\nEdgar Quisenberry, president of the bank, never lost sight of his position and responsibilities as sole representative of the national financial community in Fort Repose. A monolithic structure of Indiana limestone built by his father in 1920, the bank stood like a gray fortress at the corner of Yulee and St. Johns. First National had weathered the collapse of the 1926 land boom, had been unshaken by the market crash of 'twenty-nine and the depression that followed. \"The only person who ever succeeded in closing First National,\" Edgar often boasted, \"was Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 'thirty-three, and he had to shut down every other bank in the country to do it. It'll never happen again, because we'll never have another s.o.b. like him.\"\n\nEdgar, at forty-five, had grown to look something like his bank, squat, solid, and forbidding. He was the only man in Fort Repose who always wore a vest, and he never wore sports clothes, even on the golf links. Each year, when he attended the branch Federal Reserve convention in Atlanta, two new suits were tailored, one double-breasted blue, one pin-stripe gray, both designed to minimize, or at least dignify, what he called \"my corporation.\"\n\nFirst National employed two vice presidents, a cashier, an assistant cashier, and four tellers, but it was a one-man bank. You could put it in at any window, but before you took it out on loan, or cashed an out-of-town check, you had to see Edgar. All Edgar's loans were based on Character, and Character was based on cash balance, worth of unencumbered real estate, ownership of bonds and blue-chip stocks. Since Edgar was the only person in town who could, and did, maintain a mental index of all these variables, he considered himself the sole accurate judge of Character. It was said you could gauge a grove owner's crop by the way Edgar greeted him on Yulee Street. If Edgar shook his hand and chatted, then the man had just received a big price for his fruit. If Edgar spoke, cracked his face, and waved, the man was reasonably prosperous. If Edgar nodded but did not speak, nemotodes were in the citrus roots. If Edgar didn't see him, his grove had been destroyed in a freeze.\n\nWhen Randolph Bragg burst into the bank at Four minutes to three, Edgar pretended not to see him. His antipathy for Randy was more deeply rooted than if he had been a bankrupt. Bending over a desk as if examining a trust document, Edgar watched Randy scribble his name on the back of a check, smile at Mrs. Estes, the senior teller, and skid the check through the window. Randy's manner, dress, and attitude all seemed an affront. Randy had no respect for institutions, persons, or even money. He would come bouncing in like this, at the last minute, and demand service as casually as if The Bank were a soda fountain. He was a lazy, insolent odd-ball, with dangerous political ideas, who never made any effort to invest or save. Twice in the past few years he had overdrawn his account. People called the Braggs \"old family.\" Well, so were the Minorcans old family--older, the descendants of Mediterranean islanders who had settled on the coast centuries ago. The Minorcans were shiftless no-goods and the Braggs no better. Edgar disliked Randy for all these, and another, secret reason.\n\nEdgar saw Mrs. Estes open her cash drawer, hesitate, and speak to Randy. He saw Randy shrug. Mrs. Estes stepped out of the cage and Edgar knew she was going to ask him to okay the check. When she reached his side he purposely ignored her for a moment, to let Randy know that The Bank considered him of little importance. Mrs. Estes said, \"Will you initial this, please, Mr. Quisenberry?\"\n\nEdgar held the check in both hands and at a distance, examining it through the bottom lens of his bifocals, as if it smelled of forgery. Five thousand, signed by Mark Bragg. If Randy irritated Edgar, Mark infuriated him. Mark Bragg invariably and openly called him by his school nickname, Fisheye. He was glad that Mark was in the Air Force and rarely in town. \"Ask that young man to come here,\" he told Mrs. Estes. Perhaps now he would have the opportunity to repay Judge Bragg for the humiliation of the poker game.\n\nFive years before, Edgar had been invited to sit in the regular Saturday night pot-limit game at the St. Johns Country Club in San Marco, county seat and largest town of Timucuan. He had sat opposite Judge Bragg, a spare, straight, older man. Except for a small checking account, the Judge banked and did his business in Orlando and Tallahassee, so Edgar knew him hardly at all.\n\nEdgar prided himself on his cagey poker. The idea was to win, wasn't it? Judge Bragg played an open, swashbuckling game, as if he enjoyed it. On occasion he bluffed, Edgar deduced, but he seemed to be lucky so it was difficult to tell whether he was bluffing or not. In the third hour a big pot came along--more than a thousand dollars. Edgar had opened with three aces and not bettered with his two-card draw, and the Judge had also drawn two cards. After the draw, Edgar bet a hundred and the men who had taken only one card dropped out and that left it up to the judge. The judge promptly raised the size of the pot. Edgar hesitated, looked into the Judge's amused dark eyes, and folded. As the Judge embraced and drew in the hill of chips, Edgar reached across the table and exposed his hand--three sevens and nothing else. Judge Bragg had said, very quietly, \"Don't ever touch my cards again, you son of a bitch. If you do, I'll break a chair over your head.\"\n\nThe five others in the game had waited for Edgar to do or say something, but Edgar only tried to laugh it off. At midnight, the Judge cashed in his chips and said, \"See you all next Saturday night--if this tub of rancid lard isn't here. He's a bore and a boor and he forgets to ante.\" That was the first and last time Edgar played at the St. Johns Club. He had never forgotten it.\n\nRandy walked into the bank's office enclosure, wondering why Edgar wanted to see him. Edgar knew perfectly well that Mark's check was okay. \"What's the trouble, Edgar?\" he asked.\n\n\"Isn't it a little late to bring in a big check like this, and ask us for cash?\"\n\nThe clock said 3:04. \"It wasn't late when I came in,\" Randy said. He noticed other customers still in the bank--Eli Blaustein, who owned Tropical Clothing; Pete Hernandez, Rita's older brother and manager of Ajax Super-Market; Jerry Kling, from the Standard station; Florence Wechek, with her Western Union checks and receipts. It was their custom to hurry to the bank just at three.\n\n\"It's all right for business people to make deposits after closing hour, but I think we ought to have more time to handle an item like this,\" Edgar said.\n\nRandy noticed that Florence, finished at the teller's window, had wandered within hearing. Florence didn't miss much. \"How much time do you need to cash a check for five thousand?\" he asked. He was sure his face was reddening. He told himself he must not lose his temper.\n\n\"That isn't the point,\" Edgar said. \"The point is that your brother doesn't have an account here.\"\n\n\"You don't doubt that my brother's check is good, do you?\" Randy was relieved to find that his voice, instead of rising, sounded lower and steadier.\n\n\"Now, I didn't say that. But it wouldn't be good banking procedure for me to hand you five thousand dollars and wait four or five days for it to clear all the way from Omaha.\"\n\n\"I endorsed it, didn't I?\" Randy loosened his shoulders and flexed his toes and fingers and looked intently at Edgar's face. It would squash, like a potato.\n\n\"I doubt that your account would cover it.\"\n\nRandy's account stood below four hundred. This had been little to worry about, with his citrus checks due on the first of the year. Now, considering Mark's urgency, it was dangerously low. He decided to probe Edgar's weakness. He said, \"Penny-wise, pound-foolish, that's you, Edgar. You could have been in on a very good thing. Give me back the check. I'll cash it in San Marco or Orlando in the morning.\"\n\nEdgar realized he might have made an error. It was most unusual for anyone to want five thousand in cash. It indicated some sort of a quick, profitable deal. He should have found out why the cash was needed. \"Now, let's not be in a rush,\" he said.\n\nRandy held out his hand. \"Give me the check.\"\n\n\"Well, if I knew exactly why you had to have all this cash in such a hurry I might be able to make an exception to banking rules.\"\n\n\"Come on. I don't have time to waste.\"\n\nEdgar's pale, protruding eyes shifted to Florence, frankly listening, and Eli Blaustein hovering nearby, interested. \"Come into my office, Randolph,\" he said.\n\nAfter Randy had the cash, in hundreds, twenties and tens, he said, \"Now I'll tell you why I wanted it, Edgar. Mark asked me to make a bet for him.\"\n\n\"Oh, the races!\" Edgar said. \"I very rarely play the races, but I know Mark wouldn't be risking that much money unless he had a sure thing. Running in Miami, tomorrow, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No. Not the races. Mark is simply betting that checks won't be worth anything, very shortly, but cash will. Good afternoon, Fisheye.\" He left the office and sauntered across the lobby. As Mrs. Estes unlocked the bank door she squeezed his arm and whispered, \"Good for you!\"\n\nEdgar rocked in his chair, furious. It wasn't a reason. It was a riddle. He repeated Randy's words. They made no sense at all, unless Mark expected some big cataclysm, like all the banks closing, and of course that was ridiculous. Whatever happened, the country's financial structure was sound. Edgar reached a conclusion. He had been tricked and bluffed again. The Braggs were scoundrels, all of them.\n\n****\n\nRandy's first stop was Ajax Super-Market. It really wasn't a super-market, as it claimed. Fort Repose's population was 3,422, according to the State Census, and this included Pistolville and the Negro district. The Chamber of Commerce claimed five thousand, but the Chamber admitted counting the winter residents of Riverside Inn, and people who technically were outside the town limits, like those who lived on River Road. So Fort Repose had not attracted the big chain stores. Still, Ajax imitated the super-markets, inasmuch as you wheeled an aluminum cart around and served yourself, and Ajax sold the same brands at about the same prices.\n\nRandy hated grocery shopping. None of the elaborate surveys, and studies in depth of the buying habits of Americans had a classification for Randolph Bragg. Usually he grabbed a cart and sprinted for the meat counter, where he dropped a written order. Then he raced up and down the aisles, snatching cans and bottles and boxes and cartons from shelves and freezers apparently at random, running down small children and bumping old ladies and apologizing, until his final lap brought him past the meat counter again. The butchers had learned to give his order priority, for if his meat wasn't cut he didn't stop, simply made a violent U-turn and barreled off for the door. When the checker rang up his bill Randy looked at his watch. His record for a full basket was three minutes and forty-six seconds, portal to portal.\n\nBut on this day it was entirely different, because of the length of his list to which he had been adding, the quantities, and the Friday afternoon shopping rush. After he'd filled three carts, and the meat order had already been carried to the car, he was still only halfway down the list, but physically and emotionally exhausted. His toes were mashed, and he had been shoved, buffeted, butted in the ribs, and rammed in the groin. His legs trembled, his hands shook, and a tic had developed in his left eye. Waiting in the check-out line, maneuvering two topheavy carts before and one behind, he cursed man's scientific devilishness in inventing H-bombs and super-markets, cursed Mark, and swore he would rather starve than endure this again.\n\nAt last he reached the counter. Pete Hernandez, acting as checker, gaped. \"Good God, Randy!\" he said. \"What're you going to do, feed a regiment?\" Until the year before, Pete had always called him \"Mr. Bragg,\" but after Randy's first date with Pete's sister their relationship naturally had changed.\n\n\"Mark's wife and children are coming to stay with me a while,\" he explained.\n\n\"What's she got--a football team?\"\n\n\"Kids eat a lot,\" Randy said. Pete was skinny, chicken-breasted, his chin undershot and his nails dirty, completely unlike Rita except for black eyes and olive skin.\n\nPete began to play the cash register with two fingers while the car boy, awed, filled the big sacks. Randy was aware that seven or eight women, lined up behind him, counted his purchases, fascinated. He heard one whisper, \"Fifteen cans of coffee--fifteen!\" The line grew, and he was conscious of a steady, complaining murmur. Unaccountably, he felt guilty. He felt that he ought to face these women and shout, \"All of you! All of you buy everything you can!\" It wouldn't do any good. They would be certain he was mad.\n\nPete pulled down the total and announced it loudly: \"Three hundred and fourteen dollars and eighty cents, Randy! Gees, that's our record!\"\n\nFrom habit, Randy looked at his watch. One hour and six minutes. That, too, was a record. He paid in cash, grabbed an armful of bags, nodded for Pete's car boy to follow, and fled.\n\nHe stopped at Bill Cullen's bar, short-order grill, package store, and fish camp, just outside the town limits. There was space for two cases in the front seat, so he'd lay in his whisky supply. Bill and his wife, a straw-haired woman usually groggy and thick-tongued with spiked wine, operated all this business in a two-room shack joined to a covered wharf, its pilings leaning and roof askew, in a cove on the Timucuan. The odors of fried eggs, dead minnows, gasoline and kerosene fumes, decaying gar and catfish heads, stale beer and spilt wine oozed across land and water.\n\nOrdinarily, Randy bought his bourbon two or three bottles at a time. On this day, he bought a case and a half, cleaning out Bill's supply of his brand. He recalled that Helen, when she drank at all, preferred Scotch. He bought six fifths of Scotch.\n\nBill, inquisitive, said, \"Planning a big barbecue or party or something, Randy? You figure you'll try politics again?\"\n\nRandy found it almost impossible to lie. His father had beaten him only once in his life, when he was ten, but it had been a truly terrible beating. He had lied, and the Judge had gone upstairs and returned with his heaviest razor strop. He had grabbed Randy by the neck and bent him across the billiard table, and implanted the virtue of truth through the seat of his pants, and on bare hide, until he screamed in terror and pain. Then Randy was ordered to his room, supperless and in disgrace. Hours later, the Judge knocked and came in and gently turned him over in the bed. The Judge spoke quietly. Lying was the worst crime, the indispensable accomplice of all others, and would always bring the worst punishment. \"I can forgive anything except a lie.\" Randy believed him, and while he could no longer remember the lie he had told, he never forgot the punishment. Unconsciously, his right hand rubbed his buttocks as he thought up an answer for Bill Cullen.\n\n\"I'm having visitors,\" Randy said, \"and Christmas is coming.\" This was the truth, if not the whole truth. He couldn't risk saying more to Bill. Bill's nickname was Bigmouth and his lying not limited to the size of yesterday's catch. Bigmouth Bill could spark a panic.\n\nWhen he turned into the driveway, Randy saw Malachai Henry using a scuffle hoe in the camellia beds screening the garage. \"Malachai!\" he called. \"How about helping me get this stuff into the house?\"\n\nMalachai hurried over. His eyes, widening, took in the cartons, bags, and cases filling the trunk and piled on the seats. \"All this going up to your apartment, sir?\"\n\n\"No. It goes into the kitchen and utility room. Mrs. Bragg and the children are flying in from Omaha tomorrow.\"\n\nAs they unloaded, Randy considered the Henrys. They were a special problem. They were black and they were poor but in many ways closer to him than any family in Fort Repose. They owned their own land and ran their own lives, but in a sense they were his wards. They could not be abandoned or the truth withheld from them. He couldn't explain Mark's warning to Missouri. She wouldn't understand. If he told Preacher, all Preacher would do was lift up his face, raise his arms, and intone, \"Hallelujah! The Lord's will be done!\" If he told Two-Tone, Two-Tone would consider it an excuse to get drunk and stay that way. But he could, with confidence, tell Malachai.\n\nWith the meat packed in the freezer and everything else stacked in cupboards and closets Randy said, \"Come on up to my office, Malachai, and I'll give you your money.\" He paid Malachai twenty-five dollars a week for twenty hours. Malachai picked his own days to mow, rake, fertilize, and trim, days when he had no fruit picking, repairing, or better paying yard jobs elsewhere. Randy knew he was never short-timed, and Malachai knew he could always count on that twenty-five a week.\n\nMalachai's face was expressionless, but Randy sensed his apprehension. Malachai never before had been asked upstairs to receive his pay. In the office, Randy dropped into the high-backed, leather-covered swivel chair that had come from his father's chambers. Malachai stood, uncertain. \"Sit down,\" Randy said. Malachai picked the least comfortable straight chair and sat down, not presuming to lean back.\n\nRandy brought out his wallet and looked up at the portrait of his bald-headed grandfather, Woodrow Wilson's diplomat, with the saying for which he was known stamped in faded gold on the discolored frame: \"Small nations, when treated as equals, become the firmest of allies.\"\n\nIt was difficult. From the days when they fished and hunted together, he had always felt close to Malachai. They could still work in the grove, side by side, and discuss as equals the weather and the citrus and the fishing but never any longer share any personal, any important matters. They could not talk politics or women or finances. It was strange, since Malachai was much like Sam Perkins. He had as much native intelligence as Sam, the same intuitive courtesy, and they were the same size, weighing perhaps 180, and the same color, cordovan-brown. Randy and Sam Perkins had been lieutenants in a company of the 7th (Custer) Regiment of the First Cav. Together, Randy and Sam had dug in on the banks of the Han and Chongchon, and faced the same bugle-heralded human wave charge at Unsan, and covered each other's platoons in advance and retreat. They had slept side by side in the same bunker, eaten from the same mess tins, drunk from the same bottle, flown to Tokyo on R. and R. together and together bellied up to the bar of the Imperial Hotel. They had (if it were learned in Fort Repose he would be ostracized) even gone to a junior-officer-grade geisha house together and been greeted with equal hospitality and favors. So it was a strange thing that he could not speak to Malachai, whom he had known since he could speak at all, as he had to Sam Perkins in Korea. It was strange that a Negro could be an officer and a gentleman and an equal below Parallel Thirty-eight, but not below the Mason-Dixon Line. It was strange, but this was not the time for social introspection. His job was to tell Malachai to brace and prepare himself and his family.\n\nRandy took two tens and a five from his wallet and shoved them across the desk. \"That's for the week.\"\n\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Malachai said, folding the bills and tucking them into the breast pocket of his checked shirt.\n\nPerhaps the difference was that Malachai had not been an officer, like Sam Perkins, Randy thought. Malachai had been in service for four years, but in the Air Defense Command, a tech sergeant babying jet engines. Perhaps it was their use of the language. Sam spoke crisp upstate-New York-Cornell English, but when Malachai talked you didn't have to see him to know he was black. \"Malachai,\" Randy said, \"I want to ask you a serious question.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"What would you say if I told you I have very good information--about as good as you can get--that before long a war is coming?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't surprise me one bit.\"\n\nThe answer surprised Randy. His swivel chair banged upright. \"What makes you say that?\"\n\nMalachai smiled, pleased with Randy's reaction. \"Well, sir, I keep up with things. I read all I can. I read all the news magazines and all the out-of-state papers I can get hold of and some service journals and lots of other stuff.\"\n\n\"You do? You don't subscribe to them all, do you?\"\n\nMalachai tried to control his grin. \"Some I get from you, Mister Randy. You finish a magazine and throw it away and Missouri finds it and brings it home in her tote bag. And every day she collects the Cleveland papers and the business magazines from Mrs. McGovern's. Mondays I work for Admiral Hazzard. He saves The New York Times and the Washington papers for me and the Naval Institute Proceedings and technical magazines. And I listen to all the commentators.\"\n\n\"How do you find the time?\" Randy had never realized that Malachai read anything except the San Marco Sun (\"It Shines for Timucuan County\").\n\n\"Well, sir, there's not much for a single, non-drinkin' man to do around Fort Repose, week nights. So I read and I listen. I know things ain't good, and the way I figure is that if people keep piling up bombs and rockets, higher and higher and higher, someday somebody's going to set one off. Then blooey!\"\n\n\"More than one,\" Randy said, \"and soon--maybe very soon. That's what my brother believes and that's why he's sending Mrs. Bragg and the children down here. You'd better get set for it, Malachai. That's what I'm doing.\"\n\nMalachai's smile was gone entirely. \"Mister Randy, I've thought about it a lot, but there's not a doggone thing we can do about it. We just have to sit here and wait for it. There's not much we can lay up--\" he patted his breast pocket. \"This twenty-five dollars, with what Missouri brings home this evening, is it. Fast as we make it, it goes. Of course, we don't need much and we've got one thing hardly anybody else has got.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Water. Running water. Artesian water that can't be contaminated. You all only use it in the sprinkling system because it smells funny, some say like rotten eggs. But that sulphur water ain't bad. You gets to like it.\"\n\nUntil that moment, Randy hadn't thought of water at all. His grandfather, in a year of freakish drought, at great cost had drilled nearly a thousand feet to find the artesian layer and irrigate the grove. And his grandfather had allowed the Henrys to tap the main pipe, so the Henrys had a perpetual flow of free water, although it was hard with dissolved minerals and Randy hated to taste it out of the sprinkler heads in grove and garden, even on a hot summer day.\n\n\"I'm afraid I'd never get used to it,\" he said. He counted out two hundred dollars in twenties and thrust the money across the desk. \"This is for an emergency. Buy what you need.\"\n\nThe new notes felt slippery in Malachai's fingers. \"I don't know when I can pay this back.\"\n\n\"Don't worry about it. I'm not asking you to pay it back.\"\n\nMalachai folded the bills. \"Thank you, sir.\"\n\n\"See you next week, Malachai.\"\n\nMalachai left and Randy mixed a drink. You turned a tap and lo, water came forth, sweet, soft water without odor, pumped from some sub-surface pool by a silent, faithful servant, a small electric motor. Every family on River Road, except the Henrys, obtained its water in the same way, each with its own pump and well. More important than anything he had listed was water, free of dangerous bacilli, unpolluted by poisons human, chemical, or radioactive. Pure water was essential to his civilization, accepted like pure air. In the big cities, where even a near-miss would rupture reservoirs, demolish aqueducts, and smash mains, it would be hell without water. Big cities would become traps deadly as deserts or jungles. Randy began to consider how little he really knew of the fundamentals of survival. Helen, he guessed, would know a good deal more. It was a required subject in the education of Air Force wives. He decided to talk to Bubba Offenhaus, who ran Civil Defense in Fort Repose. Bubba must have pamphlets, or something, that he could study.\n\nDownstairs Graf began to bark, an insistent, belligerent alarm announcing a strange car in the driveway. Randy went to the head of the stairs, shouted, \"Shut up, Graf!\" and waited to see who would knock.\n\nNobody knocked but the door opened and Randy saw Elizabeth McGovern in the front hall, bending over Graf, her face curtained by shoulder-length blond hair. She stroked Graf's hackles until his tail wigwagged a friendly signal. Then she looked up and called, \"You decent, Randy?\"\n\nOne day she would barge in like this and he would be indecent. She bewildered him. She was brash, unpredictable, and sometimes uncomfortably outspoken. \"Come on up, Lib,\" he said. Like the Henrys, she was a special problem.\n\nAll through the summer and early fall Randy had watched the McGoverns' house and dock go up, while landscapers spotted palms in orderly rows, laid down turf, and planted flower pots and shrubbery. On a sultry October afternoon, trolling for bass in the channel, he had seen a pair of faultlessly curved and tapered legs incongruously stretched toward the sky from the McGovern dock. Since she was lying on the canvas-covered planking, heels propped up on a post, the legs were all that could be seen from water level. He turned the prow toward shore to discover whose body was attached to these remarkable and unfamiliar legs. When his boat was almost under the dock he'd spoken, \"Hello, legs.\"\n\n\"You may call me Lib,\" she'd said. \"You're Randy Bragg, aren't you? I've sort of been expecting you'd call.\"\n\nWhen they'd become something more than friends, although less than lovers, he'd accused her of luring him with her lovely legs. Lib had laughed and said, \"I didn't know, then, that you were a leg man but I'm glad you are. Most American males have a fixation about the mammary gland. A symptom of momism, I think. Legs are for men's pleasure, breasts for babies'. Oh, that's really sour grapes. I only said it because I know my legs are my only real asset. I'm flat and I'm not pretty.\" Technically, she was accurate. She was no classic beauty when you considered each feature individually. She was only beautiful in complete design, in the way she moved and was put together.\n\nShe came up the stairs and curled a bare arm around his neck and kissed him, a brief kiss, a greeting. \"I've been trying to get you on the phone all day,\" she said. \"I've been thinking and I've reached an important conclusion. Where've you been?\"\n\n\"My brother stopped at McCoy, flying back to Omaha. I had to meet him.\" He led her into the living room. \"Drink?\"\n\n\"Ginger ale, if you have it.\" She sat on a stool at the bar,"
