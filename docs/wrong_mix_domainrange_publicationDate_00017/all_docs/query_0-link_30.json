        "text": "BOOKS IN REVIEW\n\nThe Sea Is the Future.\n\nBill Ashcroft. Utopianism in Postcolonial Literatures. New York: Routledge, 2017. xii+226 pp. $37.95 pbk.\n\nIn 2011, opponents of the Occupy Wall Street movement frequently tried to antagonize protesters by asking how they would change the economic system. The protesters uniformly answered that making specific changes was the job of economists and bankers; their job was to register discontent, loudly and in public. For Bill Ashcroft’s new work, Utopianism in Postcolonial Literatures, that response is far more useful than detailed answers to particular problems, because it affectively demonstrates an imaginative and unbounded vision of a better future that makes the present at least marginally livable. Exactly how that future comes into being is less important, in the present, than the insistence on defining the need for it.\n\nDerek Walcott, the late Nobelist from St. Lucia, famously told us that in the Caribbean, the sea is both time and space, defining everything that was brought to the islands and everything that can happen there:\n\nWhere are your monuments, your battles, martyrs?\n\nWhere is your tribal memory? Sirs,\n\nin that grey vault. The sea. The sea\n\nhas locked them up. The sea is History. (“The Sea Is History” 1978)\n\nThe sea must be the future as well, for here as everywhere the past produces the present and shapes the future at all points, in the forms of successive concrete events and in the methods available for understanding them—that is, for producing history. It is important, then, to see Ashcroft’s Utopianism as an examination of time and space as conceived in a variety of postcolonial territories, a series of conversations in which each chapter engages a few creative writers and theorists in a particular region whose figurations augment and challenge the ubiquitous Western schemas of linear progression. Readers should not expect a comprehensive survey of utopian and speculative fiction per region, or a study of utopian geographies from More onward—both of which are interesting areas of work. Rather, they will find here a discussion of utopianism focused through two terms developed by Ernst Bloch: heimat, the not-yet-achieved space of comfort and fulfilment, and vorschein, the creative gesture or working-toward heimat. For Ashcroft, as for the Occupy demonstrators, vorschein describes concrete activity of critical expression, while heimat is sometimes better described as open, a matter of persistent desires and not of defined conditions. Moreover, emphasizing vorschein as process acknowledges the ethical dimensions of an indeterminate utopianism. In 2002, reviewing Ralph Pordzik’s The Quest for Postcolonial Utopia (2001) for SFS, Tom Moylan warned that “stressing a radical but abstracted openness and not engaging with actual processes of gaining and holding power … threatens to overlook one of the key places in which a concrete utopianism operates—that is, within the very processes of transformation themselves” (qtd. Ashcroft 270). Ashcroft addresses this threat in two ways. First, because so much postcolonial expression has found its voice amid very specific pressures of imperial oppression, utopian writers in formerly colonized or currently occupied territories can draw from longstanding practices of confrontation, and particularly of transformation, finding and celebrating the means to declare that the lives of individuals and groups indeed matter. Second, and just as importantly, Utopianism is very cautious in its use of authoritative assertion: well aware that small or local institutions, universities and publishers among them, often replicate the imperial orders of assignment and value within which they originated, Ashcroft instead consciously draws back and listens to the other speakers in these conversations, and just as generously opens directions of inquiry for further exploration, perhaps by a later generation of scholars.\n\nWhen the conversations work, as especially in the sections focused on Africa (Chapter Four), India (Chapter Six), and the Caribbean (Chapter Eight), the results offer remarkably useful descriptions of other—alternative, simultaneous, or layered—schemes of time and place that respond to and ameliorate the pressures of historic linearity and its offspring, the nation-state and the capitalist economy. Discussing Africa, for example, in terms that address Moylan’s concerns, Ashcroft notes that the borders of many post-independent states simply, but problematically, re-assert old imperial boundaries that deliberately broke up ethnic territories for ease of colonial administration: thus, any projection of heimat based upon recovered heritage (the past as future) or on larger regional or pan-African affiliations (the speculative future) must necessarily find its footing in a present that involves specific references and concrete details. Ashcroft locates such discussions in novels by Ayi Kwai Armah (Ghana, born 1939) and Ben Okri (Nigeria, born 1959), established writers of different generations whose works are widely available; both address the limitations and impositions of linear history by highlighting other forms of recollection and sequence, and importantly by developing ways to express those alternatives in English.\n\nThe chapter centered on India covers wide territories of envisioned community, from unbounded inclusiveness (Gandhi, Tagore) to mythic nationalism (the film Mother India [1957]), from statist nationalism (Nehru) to dystopian survival-through-hybridity (Rushdie). For Ashcroft, the shifting variety of available positions sustains a diverse, contentious vorschein which in turn represents a measure of social and creative health in the various anticipated futures. Unresolved arguments about Indian identity, how it is characterized and what mitigates it, whether it is determined by the state or resides in other factors, were already in play when Gandhi wrote the broadly suggestive Hind Swaraj in 1908; one implied direction leads to the militant nationalism that culminates in the suspension of individual rights in the State of Emergency (1975-1977), while another leads to Rushdie’s rejection of imposed order and pattern in Midnight’s Children (1981). “What Rushdie dismantles is not so much the idea of nation as the wider ranging tyranny of borders within which such concepts come into being” (123); the burden of critique weighs down the character of Saleem with a sadness that for Ashcroft marks “the tragedy of the postcolonial nation, but also the tragedy of the idea of the bordered nation itself” (123). Such observation, based again on a widely available text, moves the discussion beyond the nominal location in India and offers its terms to any construction of a speculative future.\n\nThe chapter on Caribbean writing, matching Walcott’s poetic history with Kamau Brathwaite’s creative theory, is a masterwork; when Utopianism is excerpted in a critical anthology, this will be the selection. “From Plato to Thomas More to Margaret Mead to Gilles Deleuze,” says Ashcroft, “writers have been fascinated with islands. Islands force us to face the disturbing contingency of human habitation” (146-47). As reputed utopias, as heterotopias and laboratories, islands are likewise considered here in their most basic form—as land surrounded by water. The issue is hardly speculative, but physically real. From the fort on St. Lucia that Walcott describes with such muscle in Omeros (1990), you can see Martinique. Separate nations, different languages, but shared space: you are looking at history in its most immediate, unavoidable form, laden with tragedy but likewise full of potential connection. Ashcroft follows Jonathan Pugh’s 2013 question, “how can thinking with the archipelago change how we think about the world?” (qtd. Ashcroft 148). The desired change resides in the constant, ongoing recognition of the need to change, to reimagine space in the hospitable terms of heimat and thus to produce an imaginable survival.\n\nThe beauty of such envisioning casts a shadow on the few weaker sections of the book. A chapter on Palestinian space needs stronger sourcing, and a brief one on Chicano myth is overly narrow in representing complex modernities. An introductory chapter on the inheritors of More focuses on the shipwreck survival tale The Isle of Pines (1668) by Henry Neville, following David Fausett’s Writing the New World (1993) into the political allegory of its first part and curiously omitting the author’s name. A second part, later joined with the first to form a combined version (also 1668), is actually more suited to the discussion here; the full version is considered in a dedicated issue of Utopian Studies (2006), as well as my critical edition and book-length study subtitled Henry Neville’s Uncertain Utopia (Ashgate 2011). Routledge, I think, should have seen to these lapses, along with stronger copy-editing and full, usable indexing. Critical readers of speculative fiction will find these flaws outweighed by Ashcroft’s fine presentation of detailed, concrete conversations on space and time in the global present.—John Scheckter, Long Island University\n\nThe Persistence of Elision.\n\nArtur Blaim. Utopian Visions and Revisions: Or the Uses of Ideal Worlds. Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang, 2017. 285 pp. $69.95 hc.\n\nThis new book by Artur Blaim is a loosely structured study on the subject of utopia that includes among its twenty chapters sections dedicated to the works of Jonathan Swift, George Orwell, Tadeusz Konwicki, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, William Golding, Werner Herzog, and Margaret Atwood. The chapters tend to be short, averaging between 12 and 13 pages, leaving little room for close analysis of any single text. The study does not have the shape of historical survey either; there is little conceptual tissue to connect the texts under consideration. The strengths of the book have mostly to do with Blaim’s insights regarding a given work or his discussion of authors and concepts that are still unfamiliar to scholars in the Anglophone academic world.\n\nHe presents some relatively unknown utopian fictions worthy of scholarly attention, such as The Memoirs of Signor Gaudentio di Lucca, a work that enjoyed popular success upon its publication in 1732, but fell into obscurity when it was confirmed that its author was not George Berkeley but a Roman Catholic priest named Simon Berington. This work has one of the more unusual framing devices in the genre: the protagonist, who has traveled through the theocratic commonwealth of Mezzorania, is questioned about his experiences by the Inquisition. The Mezzoranians themselves are distinguished by a culture in which all signs are transparent and “cannot be subjected to human manipulation and fraudulent use” (77). The utopian element here resides in a system of signification that relies on an animistic science of physiognomy and a rigid patriarchal hierarchy to ensure that communication is free of deception and ambiguity. It implies that this ideal state of affairs would dissolve upon contact with Christianity, as the worship of the sun by the Mezzoranians supports their idealized world of signs.\n\nThe chapters on Francis Bacon’s New Atlantis (1626) and Michael Harrington’s Oceana (1656) are also engaging. Blaim points out that in these early modern utopias scientific research was not regarded as a key attribute of the ideal society since experimental procedures gave science a dynamic character that the authors regarded as incompatible with the fixed and final character of utopian order. Blaim focuses on the treatment of Jews in Harrington’s work, where his skepticism toward religions leads him in anti-Jewish as well as anti-Catholic directions with his proposal to found a New Israel in Ireland. Attention is given also to the image of the Jewish utopia in An Ideal City (Nova Solymae, 1648), which was written in Latin by Samuel Gott, a Christian. This utopia is populated by Jews who have converted to Christianity, with their religious identity effacing the difference posed by their ethnicity. It becomes the new center of European civilization by entering into an alliance with England.\n\nLess satisfying, however, are his treatments of Orwell’s 1984 (1949), Golding’s The Lord of the Flies (1954), and Atwood’s Oryx and Crake (2003), which are rather shallow and make little effort to engage in debates with the secondary scholarship. His observations remain for the most part descriptive, and his interpretations do not offer any surprises. Granted, some of the intertextual connections he makes between works can be illuminating, such as his comparison of the character of Snowman, the sole survivor of the human species in Oryx and Crake, and the yahoos in Gulliver’s Travels (1726) that climb up trees to defecate on those who provoke them. His conceptual framework drives his commentaries in a reductive direction while failing to provide cohesion between the study’s different parts. The comparison of 1984 and A Minor Apocalypse by Tadeusz Konwicki (1979), a novel set in communist Poland, is promising, but Blaim does not unravel the relationship between totalitarianism and stagnation that is suggested by the pairing of the two works. The chapter on Shakespeare draws attention to the metaphor of the body politic in Coriolanus (c. 1605), as well as to passages relating to the ideal society in Henry VI (1592) and The Tempest (1611). But, again, Blaim does not move much beyond the generalization that Shakespeare weighs states and statesmen on the scale not of what is best, but of what is “better.”\n\nThe strengths and weaknesses of his book are on full display in the chapter on utopian elements in popular music. What could have been the most intriguing section of the book is marred by a lack of analytical momentum. It is not surprising to find that the wish for a better world is a common theme in rock as well as in rap, but there is no overarching point about the significance of utopian motifs in music. Some of the songs he cites are interesting for the ironic gaze they cast on the wish, while more recent tunes express a brutal view of what constitutes personal happiness. Blaim takes a classificatory approach that, while making scattered references to historical events, fails to achieve a grounding in historical consciousness. Thus, the chapter, which might have yielded an intriguing reflection on contemporary youth culture, ends on an anodyne reference to John Lennon’s “Imagine” (1971). A doc-trinaire attachment to the theme of better worlds in its most literal guise results in the neglect of the world-transforming impact of rock music, which has spurred the emergence of youth culture around the globe while also making the transgression of the most ancient moral codes into something quotidian and innocuous.\n\nThe final four chapters of the book are devoted to topics relating to literary theory in communist Poland and the Soviet Union. The section dealing with the function accorded to literary criticism in the Soviet Union presents little that is new, but the chapter on semiotics, which focuses on the work of Yuri Lotman, yields a concept that might have given Blaim’s book the unifying principle it so sorely lacks. Lotman regards both dialogue and conflict as fundamental to the health of both the individual and society. Does this make Lotman’s philosophy utopian or anti-utopian? It is a pity that Blaim, while conscious of this question, did not rearrange the texts in his study to pursue the questions that preoccupy Lotman, such as the value of self-correction and the possibility of cultural development, in the composition and the interpretation of utopian texts.—Peter Paik, Yonsei University\n\nVoices Prophesying Progress (or Crying Beware! Beware!).\n\nPeter J. Bowler. A History of the Future: Prophets of Progress from H.G. Wells to Isaac Asimov. New York: Cambridge UP, 2017. x+287 pp. $74.99 hc, $24.99 pbk.\n\nDespite the apparent implications of its subtitle, A History of the Future is not primarily a study of futuristic sf or even of future fiction generally. There are numerous references to Wells, Asimov, and Arthur C. Clarke, and significant (but fewer) references to other sf writers (e.g., Robert A. Heinlein and Olaf Stapledon), as well as well-known “mainstream” futuristic writers (Aldous Huxley and George Orwell), but no extended readings of their works. Instead, the subject of this book is futurology in all its forms, with brief mentions of literary futures introduced as needed. Even more than literary texts, Peter Bowler relies on popular science writing, both in books and in magazines. The books include two that are likely to be familiar to anyone interested in early British sf, J.B.S. Haldane’s Daedalus: Or Science and the Future (1924) and J.D. Bernal’s The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1929), as well as a range of others less well known. Examples of the latter class are The World in 2030 (1930) by the Earl of Birkenhead (less grandly named F.E. Smith), The Birth of the Future (1934) by Peter Ritchie Calder, and several books by “Professor” A.M. Low, especially The Future (1925) and Our Wonderful World of Tomorrow (1934). The magazines most frequently cited include the long-defunct British periodicals Armchair Science, Conquest, Harmsworth Popular Science, Meccano Magazine, and Practical Mechanics, as well as the still viable American publication Popular Mechanics. Bowler’s other sources include newspaper articles, advertisements, government projects, corporate statements, world fairs—anything that would reflect trends in the attitudes toward progress, by which Bowler means technological innovation.\n\nThose attitudes may be divided into two broad tendencies: to embrace new technologies, often without giving much thought to possible drawbacks, or to resist them reflexively out of a fear of change. Drawing both on Wells’s lecture “The Discovery of the Future” (1902) and C.P. Snow’s “The Two Cultures” (1959), Bowler argues that studies of the future that focus on literary works tend to portray technology in negative terms that reflect the biases of the literary culture, whereas scientists and popular science writers, by and large, are more interested in the potential of new technology to improve human life. He returns at the end to this distinction between technophiles and technophobes, whom Nigel Calder (son of Peter Ritchie Calder) has called zealots and mugs, observing that “both sides are always present, and it is a mistake to focus on one or the other exclusively if we wish to gain a balanced picture of what was going on.” Bowler adds that as “a technophile for much of [his] life” who is “now increasingly resistant to the expanding world of the internet and social media,” he has changed from a zealot to “a confirmed mug,” which has helped him to see both sides of the arguments (209).\n\nOne more point to which Bowler returns at several stages is that we should judge arguments for or against technological innovations not by emphasizing what later came to be known but by concentrating on what might reasonably have seemed possible at the time. He gives examples of the problem that arises when later developments lead us to forget that debates over emerging technologies were carried out without knowledge of what now, in hindsight, might seem obvious. As an example he notes that in 1929 Bernard Ackworth, a former Royal Navy Commander, contended that airplanes were unreliable because there was no way for pilots to allow for cross-winds. This argument, Bowler observes, “sounds ludicrous today, but it seemed more plausible at a time when airspeeds were less than 100 mph, and it certainly had some validity for flights in poor visibility when it was impossible to check movement over the ground” (124-25). Again and again there were similar arguments about the merits of emerging technologies: in the field of aviation, for example, the greater possibilities of airplanes when compared to airships seem obvious today, but they are in large part the result of technologies that were developed during the Second World War for use in designing bombers and other military aircraft. A related point is that those who envision major changes in one area might well overlook others that now seem more important: as he notes several times, “no one predicted the huge impact of the personal computer in the real world” (14). When he turns to the way futuristic technologies are represented in early sf stories, Bowler cites Gary Westfahl’s observation that we often find “an incongruous mix of advanced technologies … functioning alongside older systems that we know were soon to be swept away.” Thus, in E.E. “Doc” Smith’s Skylark series, “the hero develops space travel on an interstellar scale while still measuring equipment with calipers and doing calculations with a slide rule” (82).\n\nAlthough Bowler turns to sf and other futuristic fiction only sporadically, his survey of other sources provides contexts that should interest any reader of this journal. A History of the Future is also well documented and largely free from errors, although two dubious statements virtually leaped off the page at me. First, the claim that Heinlein “worked with Asimov in the Navy” (28) is probably based on a misunderstanding of their positions during World War II, when they were civilian employees at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Second, I seriously doubt that “in the 1960s … Paul Niehans of Geneva offered rejuvenation based on thyroid extracts to the rich and famous, including Pope Pius XII” (192). Since Pius died in October 1958, it would have taken more than thyroid extracts to rejuvenate him in the 1960s. A little fact-checking by Cambridge University Press might have caught these errors, perhaps along with a few others, such as the misspelling of Leslie Fiedler’s surname as “Fielder” (213 n.18; also in the bibliography). The index, while ambitious in its coverage, has some odd omissions: Benito Mussolini is quoted on the importance of reserving flying for the aristocracy (112), William Butler Yeats is mentioned for having “claimed to have benefitted from the Steinach operation” (191), and “the leading British eugenist C.P. Blacker” is credited with having made a point that was later made in Brave New World (201), but not one of them is listed in the index. There are also some literary texts that I wish Bowler had mentioned, one example being George S. Schuyler’s satiric portrayal of attitudes toward race in the United States, Black No More: Being an Account of the Strange and Wonderful Workings of Science in the Land of the Free, A.D. 1933-1940 (1931). But these problems are small and in no way diminish the importance of this wide-ranging study.—Patrick A. McCarthy, University of Miami\n\nA Pioneering Study of Arabic SF.\n\nIan Campbell. Arabic Science Fiction. Cham, Switzerland: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018. 322 pp. $97.23 hc.\n\nArabic Science Fiction is a pioneering book that delves into Arabic literature and discusses a subgenre that has been barely examined in English to date. In this book, Ian Campbell draws connections between Arabic science fiction (ASF) and postcolonial literature. He argues that ASF is “archetypally” (6) and “manifestly” (21) postcolonial even though it does not concede to all concepts of postcolonial theory. At its core, Campbell believes that ASF is unique because it produces what he calls “double estrangement”: cognitive estrangement that estranges technological advancement and modernity and sociopolitical estrangement that estranges the grim social and political conditions of the postcolonial Arab world. Throughout the book, Campbell teases out the nuances of this double estrangement and explains it to non-Arabic readers by discussing the function and characteristics of the subgenre and by analyzing classic ASF works. Arabic Science Fiction addresses English-speaking western readers in general and it mostly benefits those specialized in science fiction (sf) and possibly Arabic literature and postcolonialism.\n\nCampbell’s book is divided into seven chapters in addition to an introduction and a conclusion. The introduction lays out the argument and methodology. The next three chapters provide long and selective summaries, definitions, history, and a literature review of postcolonial theory, sf, and ASF. This background information leads to the fifth chapter (the centerpiece of the book) in which Campbell argues that Nihād Sharīf’s ASF classic, The Conqueror of Time (1972), provides the clearest example of double estrangement. On one level, the novel estranges the Egyptian “megalomaniac” dictator (i.e., Jamal Abdul Nasser) through a mad scientist (Halīm) whose utopian delusions distort the dictator’s rhetoric and catastrophic policies (132). On a second level, the novel also estranges Egyptian scientific stagnation and indifference to modernity by locating the events of the novel in a futuristic Egypt that is more advanced than the contemporary one (146). The remaining chapters continue discussing double estrangement in eight classic ASF novels: Muafā Mamūd’s The Spider (1965) and The Man Below Zero (1966), abrī Mūsā’s The Gentleman from the Spinach Field (1987), ’Ahmed ‘Abd al-salām Al-Baqqāli’s The Blue Flood (1976), Tālib ’Umrān’s Beyond the Veil of Time (1985), and ība Ibrāhīm’s cryogenics trilogy, including The Pale Person (1986), The Multiple Person (1990),and The Extension of Man (1992). The book ends with general conclusions about the subgenre, acknowledges shortcomings, and looks forward to further research.\n\nMost noticeable in Campbell’s book is consistency. Each chapter discussing a novel begins with a literature review; it then showcases double estrangement and literary tropes, and ends by briefly relating the novel to postcolonial theory. This consistency makes the reading smooth and enjoyable. It does not indicate flawless analyses or conclusions, however. As an Arab reader interested in the topic, I found myself disagreeing with several issues, including the selective approach to postcolonialism, minor factual errors, over-analyses of Arabic terms, and, most importantly, generalizations and stereotypes about the subgenre and about Arabs. While these issues are minor, they nevertheless damage some arguments in the book. I will briefly give examples of such minor errors and over-analyses before discussing the more pressing issues of generalizations and stereotypes.\n\nThe discussion of Islamic inheritance law in Ibrāhīm’s The Pale Man provides an example of a minor factual error (289). Campbell explains that children born out of wedlock do not inherit from parents and that this fact is crucial to understanding estrangement in the novel. In support of this claim, he refers readers to Jane Dammen McAuliffe’s online Encyclopedia of the Qur’ān (2001) that touches upon the issue but subjects it to a specific condition. As a matter of fact, an illegitimate child does inherit from his mother—but not his father—in both Kuwait, where the novel takes place, and in Islamic law in general. While this error is minor, it does upset the flow of Campbell’s analysis of the protagonist’s motivations throughout the novel. Another example of a minor factual error is in the information about Ibrāhīm. Campbell states that she is still alive (277) and that she is the first major ASF female writer (14). Ibrāhīm passed away in 2011 and the earliest female writer whom I was able to locate is Sāfia Ktto from Algeria who has been writing sf short stories since 1964. These stories were published in a collection, The Purple Planet (1983), by Dār Nū’mān in Canada prior to Ibrāhīm’s first book. Again, while this error is minor, it does undermine the author’s rationale for choosing Ibrāhīm’s novels since they did not appear in the same time frame as most of the other novels mentioned by Campbell.\n\nAn example of over-analysis of Arabic terminology can be seen in the discussion about the title of Sharīf’s The Conqueror of Time. Campbell draws connections between the words of the original title, Qāhir 'Alzaman, Jamal Abdul Nasser, and Cairo: Qāhir [conqueror] refers to Hālim the scientist; Qāhir is also the masculine version of Al-Qāhira (Egypt’s capital) and it is a synonym of part of Abdul Nasser’s last name (Nasser). Campbell argues that “lurking behind the title’s literal meaning is the shadow of the former president: Hālim is ‘The Nasser of his Age’” (133). Similarly, the author draws connections between the words sha’r [hair] and sha’r [feeling] and argues that the shared linguistic space between the two words is indicative of Hālim’s character. Hālim is hairless; thus “there is a phantom image of him not having a single feeling” (137). As an Arab reader, I find these connections very strained. In fact, Qāhir and Abdul Nasser, in the first example, have opposite connotations. On the one hand, Nasser [Giver of Victory] is an attribute of God; Abdul Nasser (mistakenly shortened to Nasser by the author), on the other hand, means a submissive worshipper of the Nasser. The connotation of “Abdul Nasser,” therefore, indicates incompetence without the support of God. This connotation is contrary to Hālim’s dismissal of the Divine and his absolute trust in science (141). Similarly, while sha’r and sha’r sound similar, their roots are different and their linguistic space is also shared by many other words with different meanings.\n\nWhile these minor errors and occasional over-analyses can be intrusive, I believe that generalizations and stereotypes are more damaging to the book’s main argument. Even though the author acknowledges that generalizations and stereotypes are risky, particularly for western critics (95), he nevertheless delves into sweeping statements about ASF—and about a readership of more than 380 million Arabs in twenty-two nations in a land mass larger than Europe. These statements are found in every chapter. Examples include: “anyone well-versed enough in standard Arabic to read novels would know of the tenth-century writer al-Hamadhāni” (133; emphasis added), “[this is a] well-known curiosity for [Arabic] students” (137; emphasis added), “[this is] an argument that would probably have gone over the heads of most readers of the novel” (139; emphasis added). In addition to these generalizations, the author establishes a conclusive framework and offers some predictions about the subgenre that can be challenged by many examples that do not fit. More worrisome, the author emphatically utilizes stereotypes about Arabs to prove the presence of double estrangement in ASF. These stereotypes include the notion that Arabs are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their imperial power, that they are miserable under their rulers and yearn for freedom, that they oppress women, that they struggle to overcome religious extremism, and so on. Utilizing stereotypes to demonstrate double estrangement is problematic because it bases many claims on unsubstantiated presumptions which, in turn, undermine the evidence. Among the many examples that illustrate this problem is the author’s discussion of how ASF handles gender roles. The author assumes that Arabs are fanatically intolerant of women stepping out of their traditional roles; therefore, ASF writers grapple with the issue either by succumbing to this misogyny, as in Sharīf’s The Conqueror of Time, or estranging it, as in Al-Baqqāli’s The Blue Flood.\n\nIn his response to the absence of female scientists in The Conqueror of Time, for example, Campbell argues that “Egypt of Sharīf’s day had so few opportunities for women outside of traditional roles that even in an alternate Egypt where science and logic rule, a woman scientist is still too implausible to render the estrangement cognitive” (148). Campbell makes this statement in response to possible criticism of Sharīf’s inability to perform double estrangement on female characters. In this defense, he essentially argues that Sharīf’s dismissal of female scientists is strategic, aimed at enhancing cognitive estrangement in the novel as a whole. The problem with this defense, however, is that its presumption about gender roles in Egypt is inaccurate. While women are restricted in some Arab societies, Egypt at the time was rife with female scientists, doctors, pilots, publishers, and even members of the parliament (for example, Samīra Mūsā was a female nuclear scientist in the 1940s, Latīfa ’Al-Nādī was a female pilot in 1933, Sūhir Qalmāwi became the Dean of the College of Arts in 1956 and a member of the parliament in 1967, Amīna S’aīd was the editor in chief for Hwā in 1954 and later the head of the Board of Trustees of Dār ’Alhilāl in 1976, where Sharīf published the first edition of The Conqueror of Time four years earlier). As a result of his presumption, the author’s counter argument ironically reinforces the negative observation about the novel’s dismissal of women.\n\nLikewise, the author argues that The Blue Flood essentially estranges the patriarchy of Arab intellectual elites by partially exposing the protagonist’s misogyny toward his female student and love interest. After this student has been sexually assaulted, the protagonist attempts to murder her. Campbell explains to his western readers that the protagonist’s attempt is normal. After all, rape in “these cultures” is a stain that can only be “washed out” by the victim’s bloodshed (240). Campbell enforces this stereotype by referring his readers to a study published in Homicide Studies in December 2014, Recep Doğan’s “The Dynamics of Honor Killings and the Perpetrators’ Experiences.” The problem is that this study does not support the presumption about the commonality of Arabs murdering rape victims. In it, Doğan discusses cases of honor crimes in Turkish prisons. None of the cases involves the murder of rape victims. He concludes that perceptions of murderers in his sample are similar to those in the Arab world and other western countries such as Spain, Greece, and Italy. This conclusion is different from Campbell’s assertion that the crime itself is common among Arabs. While the chastity of women is highly regarded and laws that protect rape victims are poor, honor killings are not common in all Arab societies, especially against rape victims and in Morocco where the novel takes places. Utilizing this inaccurate stereotype therefore undermines Campbell’s analysis of the protagonist’s behavior; this in turn undermines evidence that the novel estranges patriarchy within the Arab intellectual elite.\n\nWhile these issues weaken various claims in the book, I do not think that they nullify the presence of double estrangement in many ASF works. Nevertheless, the book’s overall argument could have been more compelling had the author avoided these pitfalls, acknowledged limitations, and avoided stereotypes about Arabs and Arab cultures. After all, Arabs are diverse and ASF is a subgenre that encompasses many trends, themes, and plots. Nonetheless, Arabic Science Fiction remains a significant pioneering work. It contains many interesting analyses and genuinely insightful arguments. Along with earlier research, it definitely sets the stage for further engagement in the field. And for this reason, I think it should be on the bookshelf of anyone interested in the topic.—Musab Bajaber, King Saud University\n\nSpeculative Markets.\n\nWilliam Davies, ed. Economic Science Fictions. London: Goldsmiths, 2018. xv+383 pp. £24.95 hc, £15.99 pbk.\n\nIn Economic Science Fictions, editor William Davies brings together economists, sf scholars, architects, designers, artists, and poets to examine the intersections between economics and science fiction. The result is an engaging, eclectic, and wide-ranging volume which addresses itself to a wide popular audience, “anyone who believes the economy is too important to be left to the economists” (cover blurb). As a result, sf scholars coming into the volume will encounter the minor annoyances common to both cross-disciplinary and popular writing about our field (over-reliance on a small number of big theorists to represent the field as a whole, reinventions of various theoretical wheels, calls for exploration in areas where great work exists already, etc). Yet Economic Science Fictions also combines the virtues of interdisciplinary and popular projects: the pieces Davies assembles here are clearly and engagingly written, approach old problems from interesting new angles, and clarify the cultural and political stakes of their theoretical interventions. Economic Science Fictions offers valuable insights not just for those of us who are interested in the interaction of economic systems and the speculative imagination, but for any sf scholar seeking to address their scholarship to a popular left-political audience.\n\nThe scholarly essays in the volume are excellent, well worth the price of admission. Davies’s introductory chapter opens the volume with a sophisticated analysis of the “socialist calculation debate” within twentieth-century economic theory, lucidly unpacking the ways in which foundational neoliberal thinkers Ludwig Von Mises and Friedrich von Hayek draw on distinctly science-fictional modes of futurity, utopianism, and technocratic progress to articulate the transformative powers they attribute to markets and market forces. Davies argues that this sf foundation to neoliberalism helps account for some of its most confounding and paradoxical aspects: the way it functions as a utopia even as it claims to abolish utopia, the way it appropriates narratives of progress as it both annexes and forecloses future possibilities.\n\nThe rest of the volume’s critical essays are (mostly) grouped into two of its four sections. The first, “The Science and Fictions of the Economy,” focuses on the science-fictionality of core concepts and assumptions in orthodox economic theory. Two pieces stand out here. Laura Horn’s “Future Incorporated?” examines the ways that corporate power is represented in recent science fiction, arguing that while dystopian representations of futures “dominated by mega-corporations, determining every facet of production, consumption, and social interaction” may “seem to question corporate power, [they] actually reinforce a discourse that prevents imagining alternatives” (41-42). While this is not a new claim in sf criticism, Horn lays it out with exceptional clarity. Even better, Horn provides an equally clear argument for the kinds of productive alternative visions corporate dystopias are obscuring. She combines an extended reading of cooperative and collective forms of economic organization in Kim Stanley Robinson’s work to an incisive overview of the theory and practice of worker-owned collective enterprises in the economy today. As “real utopias,” Horn argues, such cooperatives function as economic science fictions that, like Robinson’s work, “engender a further engagement with options that might otherwise be unthinkable” (57) and remind us that “it is only through collective thinking and critical engagement with these alternatives that [better] futures might come about” (58).\n\nThe other standout of the first section is Sherryl Vint’s “Currencies of Social Organization: The Future of Money,” which provides an engaging, concise, accessible (and thus highly teachable) synthesis of recent scholarship on the history and sociology of currency systems. Drawing on the work of Felix Martin and David Graeber, Vint uses close readings of Andrew Nichol’s In Time (2009) to map currency’s distinct but overlapping social functions as medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value, and Charles Stross’s Neptune’s Brood (2013) to tease out the way the technology of money affects human social relations by affording different approaches to credit and indebtedness. Thinking of money as an economic sf, Vint argues, “can make visible the kind of social engineering the technology of money is doing to our society today,” but “the tool of money can be oriented towards other kinds of ideas and practices, other kinds of social orders [and] subjectivities” (71-72).\n\nThe second block of critical essays, “Design for a Different Future,” examines the utopian and dystopian possibilities in the built environment. As the essays in this section remind us, the physical structures and objects produced by modern industry are politically invented and planned, and thus architecture and design can also be mediums for envisioning economic science fictions whose participants could be “actively channeled towards different forms of economic life” (208). The stand-out essay in this section is Owen Hatherley’s “Prefabricating Communism: Mass Production and the Soviet City.” Examining the history of the mikrorayan or “microdistrict”—the standardized, mass-produced housing tracts that spread across the USSR from the 1950s to the 1980s—Hatherley argues for a reappraisal of these anonymous developments, so often invoked by critics of state communism as the apotheosis of dystopian de-individuation and conformity. In the mikrorayan’s “return to a ‘utopian’ technocratic vision of full communism [that] fell into abeyance in the Stalinist era,” Hatherley identifies “a reengagement with the revolutionizing of everyday life, and an embrace of futurology and specific prediction,” science-fictional impulses that came together in a new architectural discourse of automation and mass-production (209-210). While the Soviet state implemented this design philosophy with “notoriously mixed results,” Hatherley argues that this flawed attempt at creating housing systems that are stable, affordable, and accessible to all remains a compelling challenge to urban “development” that frames housing as a speculative asset rather than a common good.\n\nWhile the critical essays in Economic Science Fictions range from excellent to merely very good, the creative pieces are more of a mixed bag. Nora O Murchú’s “The New Black” and Khairani Barokka’s “AT392-Red” stand on their own as well-crafted sf short fiction. In Barakka’s story, health and disability services are regulated and traded in a system of Accessibility Credits, a market austerity scheme that both rations care and perpetuates medical inequalities. The story imagines a resistance movement of “crip and disabled and D/deaf ilk” against the organization that administers these Credits. Murchú offers a subtle and engaging meditation on the way the precarity and ubiquitous surveillance of online labor works its way into workers’ subjectivity, tracing the inner life of such a worker as she goes about her day totally subsumed by her role as a mid-level creator and manager of “content.” Many of the other creative pieces are less successful. The fascinating world-building in the experimental group AUDINT’s “Pain Camp Economics” is presented though a flat, characterless outline. Miriam A. Cherry’s “Future History of Luddism” and “Fatbergs and Sinkholes: A Report on the Findings of An Adventure into the United Regions of England” by PostRational (Dan Gavshon Brady and James Pockson) offer economically focused world-building in more engaging formats, but fall into the tendency to infodump that characterizes amateur sf.\n\nThe fact that some of this sf is not up to professional standards does not need to be an issue here. Many of the authors here are not professional sf writers: they are designers, musicians, marketers, and academics. They are, presumably, creating these economic science fictions with specific pedagogical and theoretical intentions in mind. But only a few pieces make these critical framings clear. Bastien Kaspern’s “Economic Design Fictions: Finding the Human Scale” and Jo Lindsay Walton’s piece “Public Money and Democracy” are both successful because they include an explicit discussion of their critical intent. Kaspern makes his theoretical case first, arguing that design, which traditionally focuses on “problem-solving,” can also be used for “problem-finding” by envisaging “fictitious artefacts” to foster “debates on inventing new economics” and ways of being within the second nature of our designed and build environment (257-58). Kaspern gives examples of such “design fictions” as the “Infobesity Case,” a cellphone case that “promises to reduce your production and use of digital content [because] the more [data] you use … the fatter the case gets” (274). While this whimsical and absurd image is an interesting bit of sf on its own, its value to the reader—and thus its relevance to the collection—is found in its placement within the critical and political practices Kaspern lays out. Walton takes the opposite course, giving us her fiction first and then providing a metacommentary on the issues of intellectual labor, machine learning, and monetary theory that her story works through. If the rest of the creative pieces had included such critical framing, they would have been more impactful, accessible, and cohesive.\n\nThis need for clearer explication of why these creative pieces were selected and how they fit into the theoretical and political project of Economic Science Fictions points to a larger issue in the volume: it has both too much and too little introductory material. Introductions to collections have several functions: (a) to lay out the theoretical terrain, define key terms and ideas, and identify the political and intellectual stakes; (b) to give some sense of who the target audience for the project is and how the collection might be useful to that audience; and (c) to introduce the pieces selected for inclusion and explain how they support the collection’s overall project. In Economic Science Ficitons, we are given three introductory pieces, and while each handily accomplishes the first of these tasks, none gives a clear sense of the other two.\n\nThe volume opens with a forward by Mark Fisher. As always, Fisher is concise, sprawling, incisive, biting, cautiously but doggedly optimistic. Fisher offers a capacious usage of “economic science fiction” as something akin to Althusserian ideology: Capitalist Realism is supported by a “tissue of fictions” that “structure experience,” and so we need “new economic science fictions” that make different structures of experience possible (xii-xiii). This is followed by Davies’s “Introduction,” which provides an excellent theoretical snapshot of how this “tissue of fictions” operates within orthodox economic theory and the cultural logic of neoliberalism. Yet Davies does not explicitly connect the pieces in the collection to these theoretical concerns. Nor does he directly address the question of whom the collection is addressed to, or what use they might have for it. The book’s cover blurb claims it is for “anyone”; surely such a wide audience needs more, not less, explanation of the project’s structure and potential uses. Davies is himself followed by Ha-Joon Chang’s “Economics, Science Fiction, History, and Comparative Studies,” another great introduction to the main ideas of the collection, which examines the challenges and opportunities of engaging with the economic imagination through cross-disciplinary academic discussion and collaboration. One of the most teachable entries in the volume, it perfectly frames the scholarly essays to come, but it does not speak clearly to the creative works, nor to the wider non-scholarly audience to which the collection seems to address itself. Finally, each of the collection’s four sections opens with an editorial bumper that introduces the individual pieces, but these do not explain why the works were selected, nor why critical and creative materials are placed together in some sections but not others, nor their purpose in the project as a whole. Doing more work up front to lay out explicitly how creating sf can be incorporated into the diverse critical and political projects of musicians, activists, lawyers, and scholars would have made Economic Science Fictions a stronger, more powerful, more cohesive, and more accessible volume for the wide audience to which Davies aspires.\n\nDespite these minor challenges, Economic Science Fictions is an exceptional volume, opening a welcome discussion at the intersections of sf, economics, and culture. Davies has assembled a fascinating collection of pieces, and I came away from them with new insights and connections as well as an appreciation of the broad scope of inquiry and collaboration that is available to tackle these thorny issues. Anyone interested in economic justice and sf’s engagement with political economy, architecture, and design should look out for it.—Joshua Pearson, Independent Scholar\n\nFrom Shakespeare to Pynchon.\n\nKimberly Drake, ed. Critical Insights: Paranoia, Fear and Alienation. Ipswich, MA: Salem, 2017. 300 pp. $105 hc.\n\nThis volume in the Salem Press Critical Insights series brings together a collection of scholarly essays on the literature of fear, paranoia, and alienation. The chapters focus primarily on canonical works by US and British authors and directors, and explore common motifs found in paranoid texts in both literature and film. The essays cover a wide range of genres, including gothic, tragedy, suspense, crime, mystery, war, political thriller, and sf, and the various contributors examine how alienation, fear, and paranoia inspire complex and deeply appealing stories that allow audiences to engage with visceral emotions from a safe and comfortable distance.\n\nThe book opens with an introduction by Drake that examines the three key terms informing the collection. Drake draws on dictionary, technical, medical, psychoanalytic, and philosophical uses of these terms to explore their distinctiveness and to consider their overlaps. As Drake contends, each one has to do with the mind’s apprehension of danger and the ways in which this can affect both body and mind. While these terms have some universal applications, Drake points out that they are also very much contingent and embedded in specific communities, cultures, and histories. This focus on cultural and historical contextualization threads through the various chapters, with each offering its own case study of the book’s overarching motifs by focusing on specific authors and their works.\n\nGlenn Simshaw’s opening chapter, for instance, begins by addressing how the popular reading of Shakespeare’s Macbeth as a tragic story of ambition overlooks the centrality of fear in the narrative as the consequence of murderous political ambition; and he also looks at how it connects to a deeper historical context and draws on archetypal and Elizabethan-Jacobean anxieties about succession that would have registered with contemporary audiences.\n\nIn the next chapter, Julie Prebel offers a reading of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” (1892) through the lenses of alienation and paranoia. Here, Prebel finds that the narrator’s delusions are not paranoid or inappropriate at all; rather, they serve as a form of protection against perceived threats to the “self” and allow the narrator to evade masculine force and surveillance (20). Prebel advances the argument that these delusions function as a critique of the predominant psychiatric views on paranoia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; they work to return agency to the women who had been disempowered by contemporary medical therapies.\n\nThis is followed by volume editor Drake’s essay on “Fear and ‘Paranoia’ in/about Richard Wright’s Novels.” He offers a compelling biography of Wright, traces the trajectory of his novels, and pays careful attention to the reception of his works by both mainstream and radical reviewers, who routinely read his fiction through a highly racialized lens. As Drake points out, when Wright departed from comforting and sentimental portrayals of his African American characters, he and his characters were accused of paranoia, which subsequently became projected onto all of his writings.\n\nRosann Simeroth’s chapter is one of the two essays in the volume focusing on film. In it she explores how the “found footage” horror film The Blair Witch Project (1999) allows the camera to become both an antagonist and a valuable documentation tool, with the film Paranormal Activity (2007) going a step further by also incorporating surveillance-footage narration. In making this point, Simeroth emphasizes the connection between the fear and paranoia caused by the haunting itself and the fear and paranoia engendered by surveillance technologies, and she looks at how these films play on the idea of the camera as both a source of power and horror.\n\nIn the next chapter, Gerardo Del Geurcio looks at Edgar Allan Poe’s short story, “The Masque of the Red Death” (1842) in the context of Poe’s early tragedies and his resentment of wealth. He argues that Poe’s protagonist Prospero is “a product of Poe’s rejection of high society and also a doppelgänger for the young, reckless Poe himself” (73). Del Geurcio uses these biographical details from Poe’s childhood to argue that the symbolic imagery in Poe’s story exemplifies antebellum society’s apocalyptic fears of diseases, as well as the futile efforts of the affluent to deceive death. In his chapter on Herman Melville’s Moby Dick (1851), Robert C. Evans notes that all of the titular motifs of the volume are present in Melville’s story, especially in the character of Captain Ahab. Evans argues that Ishmael’s temporary bout with paranoia early in the novel reveals that people can overcome their fears, which Melville uses to emphasize the tragedy of Ahab’s inability to overcome his own paranoia at the end.\n\nThis is followed by Peter Cullen Bryan’s chapter, which looks at how the symbol of the “small town” manifests in three very different yet similar works by Nathaniel Hawthorne (“Young Goodman Brown” [1835]), Shirley Jackson (“The Lottery” [1948]), and Ursula K. Le Guin (“The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas”). As Bryan explains, the small town is an enduring symbol of American social life and has also enjoyed a long tradition within American horror, and each of these works uses the symbol of the small town to produce a fearful and uncanny effect. The small town does not have one single meaning, however, but adapts to the writer and moment, drawing on such things as the puritanical fear of strangers (Hawthorne), the dangers posed by an unquestioning adherence to tradition (Jackson), and the dark secrets lurking beneath the greatness of civilization (Le Guin).\n\nNext is Rossitsa Terzieva-Artemis’s discussion of Patricia Highsmith’s first crime novel, Strangers on a Train (1950), a novel that draws on profound feelings of guilt, fear, and paranoia. By looking at murder as an ideological problem, Terzieva-Artemis finds that Highsmith’s novel presents a complex study of narcissism, paranoia, and megalomania, both captivating and challenging her readers. Colin Gardner follows with an examination of Joseph Losey’s 1951 remake of Fritz Lang’s 1931 classic film, M. He considers how Losey depicts his protagonist Harrow as an afflicted and impulsive murderer caught between the rational and uncontrollable. He also looks at Losey’s portrayal of a cruel and vengeful society in which group action functions as a pathological machine, placing Losey’s narrative amid Cold War hysteria and paranoia and drawing attention to the “complacent silent majority” (137).\n\nIn the next chapter, Fernando Gabriel Pagnoni Berns considers the postwar environment of the 1950s, which saw the traditional and univocal idea of masculinity replaced by a fragmented sense of masculinity ripe with internal contradictions. Here, he looks closely at Playboy, which he argues came to define masculinity as the embodiment of style and leisure, an idea that sometimes overlapped with images of the homosexual, and which clashed with more conservative constructions of manhood. Berns then turns to the horror stories of two authors writing for Playboy, Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson, and examines how they came to capture in their stories the paranoia caused by the diminishment of traditional masculinity and the fear of female empowerment. The penultimate chapter is the second contribution of Robert C. Evans. In it, Evans focuses on Flannery O’Connor’s fiction and notes that in her works there is no shortage of characters afflicted with deep traumas, yet very little has been written about this. Evans therefore discusses the appearance and nature of traumatic events and characters in O’Connor’s stories.\n\nYi Feng’s closing chapter presents an analysis of one of the quintessential novels of postmodern paranoia, Pynchon’s The Crying of Lot 49. Feng begins by situating the text within the historical context of the 1960s, explaining how it fits in with the political and cultural paranoia of American society, before looking closely at the story’s plot. Here she describes how the novel’s protagonist, Oedipa Maas, becomes entangled in a convoluted mystery and begins to find clues of a hidden “Other America” called Trystero, populated by the dispossessed. Feng advances the argument that Pynchon’s depiction of this liminal, dispossessed America reflects contemporaneous concerns about cultural hybridity, conspiracy, “the lie of history,” and the power of the maternal figure in postmodern America (xiii).\n\nTaken together, these chapters offer new ways of thinking about classical works of literature and film by reexamining these works in terms of paranoia, fear, and alienation. This volume could serve as a valuable text in an introductory literature college course. The diverse collection of chapters introduces complex themes and critical discussions and can demonstrate to students how canonical works can be reinterpreted and analyzed from many different angles. The volume will also be appreciated by anyone hoping to gain fresh perspectives on the works discussed within.\n\nThe book is weakest in its overly ambitious and unwieldy scope. While the chapters are all individually creative and unique, it can be challenging to see their relationship beyond the very general use of the key terms, “paranoia,” “fear,” and “alienation,” and some chapters do a better job of addressing those terms than others. While Drake clearly outlines these key terms in her introduction, in several chapters it becomes difficult to discern whether the author is addressing paranoia, fear, alienation, or some combination of the three, and the distinctiveness of each term becomes muddled, sometimes giving the impression that these terms have been inserted into the chapters as an afterthought. Moreover, while the chapters on film were particularly original and thought-provoking, they felt a bit out of place within the larger scope of the project, which predominantly focuses on literary works. Overall, the book could benefit from a conclusion showing how each of the chapters works in conversation with the others, and better attention could be given to explaining why these different chapters were selected to produce a coherent volume.\n\nThe book is strongest in its emphasis on the psychological, political, and/or social work being done by the various authors and directors discussed in the various chapters. That is, each chapter offers a strong grasp of how paranoia, fear, and alienation work within specific historical and cultural contexts to produce an emotive and visceral affect. By carefully examining how fear is (re)created in readers and viewers, and by looking closely at how authors and directors immerse their audiences into these visceral experiences and emotions, each chapter advances a strong argument for how and why we are drawn to stories that invite us to feel paranoid, alienated, and afraid.—Laura Thursby, University of Ontario Institute of Technology\n\nScaling Back Astroculture.\n\nAlexander C.T. Geppert, ed. Limiting Outer Space: Astroculture After Apollo. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2018. xxiv+367 pp. $84.99 hc.\n\nLimiting Outer Space is the second of a three-volume sequence edited by Alexander Geppert, the historian of science and technology who has championed “astroculture” as a distinct field of inquiry. It follows Imagining Outer Space: European Astroculture in the Twentieth Century (2014), the collection that first brought together scholars recovering how the peoples of Europe participated in making space-age culture. A third volume, Militarizing Outer Space: Astroculture, Dystopia and the Cold War, is planned. This ambitious publication program opens up new vistas in the cultural history of the space age, moving outward from accounts that prioritize the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. In the book’s conclusion, David A. Kirby offers a strong definition of astroculture: that cornucopia of “persuasive fictions” which model human occupation of outer space.\n\nLimiting Outer Space seeks to move outer-space historiography beyond its emphasis on the rocketry and space programs of the 1950s and 1960s. It focuses on how various figures extended outer-space culture in the post-Apollo 1970s. In that decade, the grand rhetoric around the Apollo program was undermined by both what it achieved and how it ended. As a result, as Geppert notes in his introduction, the 1970s has been seen as a “dispiriting” decade, a mere caesura between the heroic 1960s and low-earth-orbit limits of the decades that follow (2). This book does not overturn that reading but its chapters do offer more nuance and focus on tracking how Europe’s writers, philosophers, toymakers, lawyers, and aerospace advocates operated as the superpowers scaled back human spaceflight.\n\nThe book is organized into three parts, bracketed by Geppert’s introductory chapter, “The Post-Apollo Paradox: Envisioning Limits During the Planetized 1970s” and “Final Frontiers?: Envisioning Utopia in the Era of Limits,” an epilogue by David A. Kirby. The first part, “Navigating the 1970s,” presents ways of recovering outer-space culture between the heroic man-in-space programs of the 1960s and the Shuttle era that began in 1981. The following section, “Reconfiguring Imaginaries,” contains articles that describe how the actual experience of outer space changed the way it was presented in film, literature, law, and children’s play culture. The book’s final block, “Grounding Utopias,” explores the fitful ways in which astronauts and futurists, architects and engineers, and even politicians sought to limit the militarization of outer space through rhetorics of peaceful cooperation.\n\nWhat is at stake in this collection? Why should we pay attention to the 1970s as an important period in the history of outer-space culture? The conquest of space was the technological imaginary and instrumental reality that signaled first-world status in the global order that emerged following the Second World War. This collection shows that understanding in flux as political and expressive elites wavered between the hopeful scenarios of earlier decades and the inward-looking paradigms encouraged by images of the planet Earth. A cultural tension is thus created between hopes that seek to transcend the chauvinisms that preserve war and inequality on Earth and the desire to reclaim cosmic centrality for particular kinds of human beings. The book’s scholars come at both sides of this still relevant opposition in a variety of ways. Their concentration on the cultural and technological initiatives of European actors in this debate unsettles our notions about what the images and stories produced in response to actual spaceflight mean then and now.\n\nThe scholars of “Navigating the 1970s” debate whether and how the outer-space imaginary shifts away from the classic agenda in that decade. Martin Collins argues that spaceflight was important to the rise of the new, self-fashioned individual that came to define neoliberal globalism in the 1970s. The implication is that, despite the hopes encoded in the old Apollo phrase, “We Came in Peace for All Mankind,” the 1960s space program did not create the unified global community promised by an older liberal rhetoric. Roger Launius complicates this picture by arguing that there were five different responses to the Apollo moon landing and that each of them supported that era’s understanding of American exceptionalism. Doug Millard agues that the successes posted by the American and Soviet space programs limited the British imagination long before the 1970s. The utopian futures imagined in Dan Dare (1950-1967) and Doctor Who (1963-) were reconfigurations of an imperial past that had no purchase on UK space policy and elite self-perception in the 1970s.\n\nThe four articles of the second section, “Reconfiguring Imaginaries,” gauge how outer-space ventures appeared within terrestrial expressive culture. Their authors trace how the activities of leaving Earth and seeing it from a distance changed the kinds of stories that could be crafted in film, literature, and photography, as well as in the making of international treaties and the design of children’s toys. Robert Poole’s persuasive reading of Clarke and Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) highlights how their opposed sensibilities produced a film that places a hard limit on triumphalist human ambitions, presaging the debate about limits to growth of the 1970s. Florian Kläger focuses on how extraterrestrial images of the Earth and the common reading of them as the catalyst for a cosmically inspired self-reflection prompted critical rejoinders from British novelists. In a brilliant piece on the design and marketing of the LEGO Group’s LEGOLAND Space, Thore Bjørnvig charts its social-democratic vision of space as a peaceful domain of “cosmic play” for European and American children. In an enlightening review of the international meetings that begat the space laws of the 1960s and 1970s, Luca Follis moves beyond superpower policy to cover how non-space-faring nations argued for language that did not extend global inequality into outer space. These chapters make the case that the limits of the original American astrofuturist vision, as revealed in the wind-down of the Apollo program, inspired fresh perspectives from other nations.\n\nLimiting Outer Space’s final section, “Grounding Utopias,” is a sober reminder of the difficulties of creating associations and infrastructures that champion the peaceful exploration and/or exploitation of outer space “for all mankind.” Here Geppert’s authors remind us that the liberal/progressive idea of peaceful, international space exploration is always in tension with the possessive interests of space-capable nations. Andrew Jenks’s account of the Association of Space Explorers shows how that group of mostly American, French, and Soviet “astronauts” was grounded by Cold War politics and Reagan Administration conservatism. Regina Peldszus’s incisive chapter on the design of long-duration space habitats stresses the tension between the engineering of space-going machines and the human-centered approach of the design professions. Of particular interest in this piece is how designers used the architectures of science-fiction films as a reference for their experiments. Tilmann Siebeneichner does signal work by recovering the European Space Agency’s Spacelab from historical obscurity. He argues that, while the lab failed in its mission to ignite either the public imagination or the interest of the scientific community, the module represented a post-Apollo peak in European space interest and allowed its West German sponsors to produce a peaceful counterpoint to the quietly militaristic American Space Shuttle. Peter J. Westwick’s instructive chapter on the role that liberal space advocates and conservative sf writers played in creating the Strategic Defense Initiative underscores the general theme of the section. In the face of our fondest hopes and the narratives we create to support them, the prospect of an outer space that rules out economic competition and military conflict (or even boredom) remains, in this account, an improbable dream.\n\nThe book achieves what it sets out to do: to establish that outer space culture did not end with the Apollo program in 1973. Rather it continued in new guises and in the hands of actors with professional and national affiliations outside those sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union. This approach is in line with other recent work that seeks to broaden our understanding of the first human ventures into outer space, such as anthropologist Sean T. Mitchell’s Constellations of Inequality: Space, Race, and Utopia in Brazil (Chicago, 2017) and Bowdoin College Museum of Arts’s Past Futures: Science Fiction, Space Travel, and Postwar Art of the Americas (MIT, 2015). In light of this work investigations into the cultural history of twentieth-century spaceflight are moving from strength to strength.\n\nThis is a book worth reading and rereading, depending upon your interests. It convinces that our understanding of the ways in which the brief, forceful projection of human beings into outer space matters has often been too limited. Limiting Outer Space, and the broader scholarly inquiry of which it is a part, is a powerful re-survey of territory that might seem over-explored. It opens us up to new stories about how a human prospect in outer space was imagined and why who is doing the imagining is relevant to our inquiries. Geppert’s collections help illustrate what difference this makes in terms of current research agendas in space history and sf studies.\n\nLimiting Outer Space has its own limit, however. The focus on devising new ways into the outsized cultural footprint of crewed space ventures leaves ground-based and robotic exploration on the table. We are all aware that the launching of instrumented probes to the moon, Mars, and the outer planets occurred alongside the spectacular “man-in-space” programs. The near- and deep-space achievements of the Voyagers, the Pioneers, Cassini-Huygens, and the Chang’es have consistently outstripped crewed ventures in distance, duration, and certain kinds of knowledge acquisition. The exoplanets discovered by ground- and space-based missions during the past three decades have expanded our speculations about other habitable worlds. It may be that the cosmic perspective imagined but thwarted by human-centered exploration in the 1970s has been more fully realized in the cultural practices that have responded to these activities. While we have not completely ignored these ventures, they rarely figure in studies of space culture. Within the research agenda laid out in Geppert’s series, this seems like low-hanging fruit ripe for plucking. We have barely begun in our quest to understand how we act and speak in the universe.—De Witt Douglas Kilgore, Indiana University\n\nMonstrously Readable.\n\nBarry Keith Grant. Monster Cinema. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers UP, Quick Takes: Movies and Popular Culture, 2018. 148 pp. $22.46 pbk.\n\nBarry Keith Grant offers readers a broad overview of movie monsters and their cultural meanings in Monster Cinema (2018), an entry in Rutgers UP’s Quick Takes: Movies and Popular Culture series. As its name implies, the series is designed to showcase scholars’ perspectives on a number of subjects in film and media studies in a succinct and easily readable manner. So far, the series has featured overviews of new African cinema, comic-book movies, film remakes, and modern British horror films, to name a few examples. Grant’s Monster Cinema serves as a comfortable and breezy introduction to the study of genre films about monsters and monstrosity. As is to be expected, Grant does not offer detailed critiques of prior studies of monsters in cinema. At most, he uses those prior studies as a springboard for his illustration of what movie monsters can signify culturally. Grant also comments on and lightly interprets newer monster films, such as The Mist (2007) and Cloverfield (2008), as a way to demonstrate the continuing importance of this particular field of study. The work of cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer is felt throughout the text, and with good reason: Grant takes what he describes as Kracauer’s basic assumption, that movies “reflect the values and ideology of the culture that produced them” (Grant 28), and uses that assumption to inform his overall discussion of movie monsters. Grant’s discussion is informative and compelling overall, though it is not without its minor issues, as any study about something as polysemic as “monster” is going to be.\n\nMonster Cinema is organized into four chapters, each chapter spanning roughly thirty pages. Initially, the first chapter, “Meeting Movie Monsters,” raises the question of what Grant means by monsters and monster cinema. His overview of movie monsters themselves, which are “always marked as different and, consequently, as a threat to the natural or ideological order” (1), covers many different figures: in addition to the expected giant insects, killer robots, and slimy creatures, Damian, the Devil’s child from The Omen (1976), also makes an appearance as a monster. In fact, the last chapter, “Supernatural Monsters,” counts the vengeful spirit from Unfriended (2014) and the Blair Witch from The Blair Witch Project (1999) as movie monsters. Norman Bates from Psycho (1960) is used as an example of the kind of monsters who lurk “within seemingly normal society” (5); they are “monstrous in their very physical ordinariness,” in contrast to monsters that are “marked as physically different in some way—aberrant, freakish, repulsive” (2), such as those from The Blob (1958) or The Thing (1982). The first chapter of Monster Cinema feels scattershot at first due to the wide range of monsters that are given as examples, though this seems like a deliberate way to show how differently monsters can be defined and interpreted in this field of study.\n\nGrant uses Bruce Kawin’s three subgenres of horror films from Kawin’s Horror and the Horror Film (2012)—horror films about monsters, horror films about supernatural monsters, and horror films about monstrous humans—to categorize the kinds of monsters discussed in Monster Cinema. The second chapter focuses on human monsters, the third on natural monsters, and the last on supernatural monsters. Each chapter offers further subcategories of monsters; the category of natural monsters can include planetary and interplanetary robots, for example. The primary deviation from Kawin’s work occurs at the “subgeneric” level:\n\nin the simpler, broader approach offered here, I include the regressing doctor [Jekyll] in the category of monstrous humans and The Thing, no matter how “unnatural” that “super carrot” may seem, in my broader category of natural monsters because it is posited as alien in origin, thus making it “natural” in the world of that film. (30)\n\nFor the most part, Grant is careful to respect the boundaries of his categories. Certain movie monsters appear where one would expect: the aliens of The War of the Worlds (1953) are categorized as natural monsters, since they originate on Mars; Norman Bates, as mentioned earlier, fits comfortably into the human monsters category, along with other slasher film villains such as Freddy Krueger and the Ghost Face killers from Scream (1996); and the category of supernatural monsters includes zombies, vampires, ghosts, inter-dimensional creatures, and Old Scratch.\n\nEach chapter covering a different subgenre of monster film is structured to highlight descriptions of the various monsters as they appear in certain films, followed by brief readings of what those monsters mean culturally. For example, in the fourth chapter, Grant has a common reading of supernatural monsters as representing a tension between science and faith, or as signifiers of the breakdown of the culturally and ideologically understood natural order. Supernatural monsters such as those in Drag Me to Hell (2009) and Dark Skies (2013) can reflect real-world anxieties such as the “decline of the United States’ industrial and manufacturing sectors,” the 2008 recession, and the economy itself, which Grant describes as an “intangible and incomprehensible force over which we have no control, like the supernatural” (111). Grant does not offer any closer analysis or description of these cultural phenomena beyond what is quoted above, though he is careful to choose examples that are appropriate to his claims. Drag Me to Hell (2009), which is set during the 2008 recession, can be said, convincingly, to be addressing broad economic anxieties in the US, since the protagonist’s plight in that film results directly from stresses brought about by those economic conditions. This structure of description followed by brief analysis allows Monster Cinema to be read and absorbed easily throughout. Though the arguments presented tend to be similar to each other, the variety of monsters covered in the text keeps readers interested. Grant moves effortlessly from a mention of It Came from Outer Space (1953) to Arrival (2016) in a broad leap because his subcategories of monsters and monster films in each chapter tend to be organized thematically. In the “Martian Monsters” subsection of the third chapter, for example, Grant begins by focusing on aliens who are presented more sympathetically, such as those in It Came from Outer Space (1953), District 9 (2009), and Arrival (2016), in order to demonstrate that such portrayals are quite rare in monster films. This approach is effective overall, because even though Grant makes broad, decades-long leaps among his examples, the result is the barely implicit suggestion that certain cultural or ideological concerns or fears, such as the threat of invasion from the Other, will always be present in human societies, no matter the decade, century, or millennium.\n\nGrant is also able to demonstrate Vivian Sobchack’s assertion that movie monsters tend to trouble distinctions between horror and sf, as well as other genres, by using unexpected examples of monsters and monster films. In the third chapter, Grant offers a fascinating subsection called “Microscopic and Miniature Monsters.” Films such as Contagion (2011), a drama concerning the outbreak of a deadly flu virus, are included here as examples of movie monsters crossing the boundaries of genre with little effort, while nonetheless implying how “thin the veneer of civilization is and how quickly it crumbles” (80). This subsection also contains a wonderful and creative discussion of The Hellstrom Chronicle (1971), a sensationalistic mockumentary structured like atomic monster movies such as Them! (1954) that uses microscopic photography and hilariously over-the-top narration to inspire fear of common insects. The inclusion of The Hellstrom Chronicle (1971) in Monster Cinema, and the immediate comparison of that film to the insect-like behaviour of the zombies in World War Z (2013), stresses that the monster movie may not actually be a genre, but rather a type of film that can cross various genres. Grant does not state this point outright, though the suggestion lurks within the pages and to some extent elevates Monster Cinema beyond an easily digestible overview of a field of study.\n\nThere are times in Monster Cinema where Grant’s categorizations become somewhat muddled. Prior to the fourth chapter, whether a monster is defined as human, natural, or supernatural seems to depend primarily on whether the source of monstrosity is within the human animal, as with Dr. Jekyll or Freddy Krueger, or how closely or believably the diegetic world of the film conforms to the current real world. Despite A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) containing supernatural elements in its plot, the source of monstrosity is a human who has become a monster. Therefore, Freddy Krueger is categorized as a human monster. The carrot monster from The Thing (1951), if one recalls, is natural rather than supernatural because it is an alien, and therefore part of the natural world. The possibility of extraterrestrial life is feasible in the real world, and so the carrot counts as a natural monster. Grant deals with aliens again when discussing the Greys of Dark Skies (2013), though he places them in the supernatural monster category. The reason Grant provides for this is that the Greys initially act more like poltergeists than traditional screen aliens in invasion plots such as The War of the Worlds (1953). Furthermore, Dark Skies is structured narratively in a similar way to Paranormal Activity (2007), in which the monster is a demon, and so Grant categorizes the Greys as supernatural monsters. This particular categorization stands in stark contrast to how monsters are defined previously in the text, where genre conventions seem secondary to the diegetic worlds, whether the source of monstrosity is human or not.\n\nInconsistencies such as these are only occasional in Monster Cinema. Their presence still suggests that it may have benefited the text if Grant had examined more monsters that resist simpler categorization, following a path similar to Sobchack’s in Screening Space: The American Science Fiction Film (1997). Still, Monster Cinema acts as a great introduction to monsters and monster movies for the curious reader. Grant’s book is a fairly comprehensive, light, and easy read, and is accessible for those who are not intimately familiar with this particular field of study. The number of films and types of monsters featured in the book are plentiful, and there are more than a few compelling readings to inspire readers to explore this subject further. The book is highly recommended, because, as Grant himself notes, our survival depends on understanding monsters—in other words, on understanding ourselves. —David Hollands, Trent University\n\nConsensus Future History.\n\nJames Gunn. Alternate Worlds: The Illustrated History of Science Fiction. 3rd ed. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2018. vii+304 pp. $49.95 pbk.\n\nThe history of science fiction is the history of its megatext. Labelled a “shared subcultural thesaurus” (275) by Istvan Csicsery-Ronay, Jr. in The Seven Beauties of Science Fiction (2008), the megatext is that conceptual reservoir of character types, locales, technologies, neologisms, themes, and iconographies that readers and writers consult when they engage with the genre. In sf and elsewhere, a megatext develops as new narratives add to its depth and complexity over time, modifying and building on top of established reading protocols.\n\nFirst published in 1975, Gunn’s illustrated history of the genre, revised and released as a third edition, makes a strong case for a megatextual reading of the history of sf literature. He charts the emergence of the genre’s narrative and thematic archetypes, first in a chapter titled “In the Beginning,” where he discusses sf progenitors such as the “first great scientist-engineer,” Daedalus, who built the Minotaur’s labyrinth (24), and Plato’s Atlantis, the moment when the “great lost civilization entered the science fiction repertoire” (25). He moves from there to discuss Lucian of Samosata, Jonathan Swift, and Mary Shelley’s pinnacle of gothic romance and industrial anxiety, Frankenstein (1818), which brought to sf “the theme of man’s creation of artificial life” (31)—these are the usual suspects in a history of sf, but Gunn details them with rigor and traces their origins and contexts with aplomb.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the book advances chronologically from there. Gunn provides chapters such as “Toward Verne: 1800-1885,” covering proto-sf authors Hawthorne, Balzac, Poe, and others, as well as two author-centric chapters, “A Victorian Engineer: 1828-1905” (Verne) and “Prophet of Progress: 1866-1946” (Wells), and several chapters on the pulp and slick magazines. These latter sections are the most exhaustive and stand out as favorite subjects for Gunn, himself an author who got his start in the pulps—what he lovingly calls a “golden ghetto” (127). Interspersed throughout the book—also unsurprisingly, since this is an “illustrated history”—are images of authors, book and magazine covers, meetings of various kinds, film stills, and more, all providing a rich, visual anchor for Gunn’s history of the genre. I particularly appreciated the lavish sixteen-page spread of magazine covers from the 1940s and 1950s, since this is a period of sf visual history that garners less attention than the genre’s early pulp existence in the 1920s and 1930s, with covers often illustrated by the pervasive Frank R. Paul.\n\nIn each chapter of Alternate Worlds, Gunn emphasizes the ideas of sf (as opposed to style or technique), especially how they coalesce to create a kind of shared, megatextual backdrop for other authors. In a section retained from the 1975 edition, “The Shape of Things to Come,” he anticipates the megatext concept, which would not be conceptualized in relation to sf until the early 90s, by suggesting that authors are building a “consensus future history.” As he sees it, “The construction—or foreseeing—of himanity’s [sic] future history continues; fragments still are being written; stories and novels are being fitted into the framework, filling it in, expanding its concepts, sometimes illuminating its assumptions or extending its conclusions” (214). And this is indeed how sf is presented in Gunn’s history: as a series of thematic and conceptual explorations of the future that build on one another in a largely linear and logical fashion, so that “fans grow into new writers, authors stand on each other’s shoulders” (214). This was especially the case in the magazines, he argues, with their vigorous communities and visionary editors, though he worries, from the perspective of 1975, that “The unity of science fiction … will begin to disintegrate without the magazines as a focus; the new wave is a portent” (230).\n\nThe linear progress of the genre’s worlds and ideas is the book’s guiding framework, then, along with a nostalgic celebration of magazine sf, which reached new heights under Astounding Science Fiction editor John W. Campbell’s establishment of a “consensus definition of science fiction: imagination leavened with pragmatism” (195). At the same time, however, Gunn is committed to describing the genre’s history as one constructed not only by narrative developments but also social, economic, and technological ones. Rather than rubbing uncomfortably against the text’s valorization of idea-driven sf, this more contextual orientation heightens Gunn’s descriptions of ideas, providing a look into how they were historically embedded, carrying the imprint of their publishing formats, for instance. Borrowing from Charles Fort, the author declares at several points that “it was steam engine time” (66): in other words, a time when a confluence of factors created material and ideological conditions that were ripe for something radically new.\n\nThe stage is set for this broader historical view by a revised opening chapter, “The Shape of the Present,” which Gunn uses to compare the third edition’s present moment in 2018 to that of the first edition’s in 1975. “In any case,” he writes, “we live, indisputably, in a science fiction world” (9). And then, referring to his older writing, he concludes “That is what I wrote a quarter-century and a half ago. It still is true, but no longer remarkable,” and goes on to list achievements: “we have mapped Mars and explored its surface with robots,” and “looked into the smallest atomic structures with giant accelerators” (9). Sections such as this, involving the author in conversation with himself, reflecting on his past writing and the intervening years, stand out as exemplary, and are a good reason to release a new edition after so many years. It is regretable that these reflections are limited to the first and last chapters of the book.\n\nThis is a historical look at a genre that is at least over a century old and so the gaps and omissions in Alternate Worlds are inevitable. It is unfortunate, at least in unrevised sections, that these absences conform to those of early sf canonization, particularly as they relate to women writers. Several are mentioned—Judith Merril, Ursula K. Le Guin, Octavia Butler, and others—but only Mary Shelley is given adequate space; the others receive nowhere near the attention of their male counterparts, nor is their writing detailed in the exhaustive manner that Gunn describes, for instance, A.E. van Vogt’s. As a result, one is left with the impression that Gunn’s consensus future history is built along the lines of a traditional male canon, with the already-inaugurated figures further valorized—the “Big Three” of Asimov, Clarke, and Heinlein, for instance—and the equally remarkable but (alas) non-male writers relegated to supporting roles or missing altogether.\n\nContemplating the future of sf in 1975, Gunn writes that “Beyond this the shape of things to come grows blurred, and the long journey, the odyssey of science fiction, from Homer to Hamilton, Heinlein, Herbert, and Harlan, has reached if not an end at least a pause, a place to sit for a moment and contemplate a future” (230). But even if one feels compelled to adhere to an alliteration of names, it is possible to rethink this trajectory: both Clare Winger Harris and L. Taylor Hansen, who concealed her gender when publishing, contributed to Amazing Stories and other outlets within Gunn’s golden ghetto, and Zenna Henderson’s novelette “Captivity” (1958) was nominated for a Hugo Award (Henderson is mentioned briefly in the text; Harris and Hansen are missing). The point here is not to argue that the impact of these specific authors matched or exceeded Gunn’s favorite H’s, but rather that they and others had been—and in many cases continue to be—both casually and systematically elided from the history of the genre. If Gunn’s future history is a consensual one, it is fair to ask who consented and who did not.\n\nA new conclusion for the third edition titled “The Shape of Things That Came: 1975-2016” does some work to address this problem. “In the past 40 years,” Gunn writes, “in a period of growing diversity in society as a whole as well as in a genre characterized by predominantly male writers and readers, women have had an escalating impact on science fiction not only as writers but as editors, agents, readers, and fans” (243). He goes on to provide a list of female authors who have left their mark. He delivers a similar list after noting that “The 1960s was a period when women writers turned their attention to feminist issues” (244), but these inventories are inadequate remedies for the text’s previous sidelining of women writers. For example, his treatment of James Tiptree, Jr. reads like an impersonal epitaph: “James Tiptree, Jr., whose first story was published in 1968, was revealed as Alice Sheldon in the 1970s, when her most feminist stories were published as well, and died in 1987” (244). Joanna Russ, Vonda N. McIntyre, Suzy Mckee Charnas, Joan Vinge, Pamela Sargent, and Joan Slonczewski receive similarly meagre treatments in the same paragraph.\n\nGunn uses the chapter to address other gaps and omissions as well, including non-US writers Stanislaw Lem and the Strugatsky brothers, but the enterprise amounts to a kind of checkbox-style overhaul, with each new development and past exclusion marked off an itemized list. The new chapter is designed to provide an update on the period between 1975 and 2016, of course, but it is also an attempt to amend oversights from the first edition, to produce, perhaps, a more comprehensive account of the genre’s megatext. At only nineteen pages it was likely doomed to fall short in both efforts.\n\nAt the same time, and largely because of this chapter, the flaws of Alternate Worlds are somewhat leavened in the third edition, even though its deficiencies persist: gaps are addressed superficially but they are still addressed. But the book’s strengths lie primarily outside of these efforts, in its expansive look at the origins of sf, and in its account of the genre’s emergence and evolution as a uniquely American subliterature in the magazine format. Gunn’s vibrant and contextual exploration of both subjects surely contributed to the first edition’s Hugo Award in 1976—under “Special Awards,” since a category for non-fiction works did not exist at the time. The book’s detailed index and appendices, including an ambitious chronology of the history of Western sf and technoscience, are impressive resources as well, but the lack of citations and of a works cited section limit its use as a tool for research. For readers seeking an account of the pulps and the Golden Age of sf from an author who lived and wrote through those eras, Gunn’s text is interesting and valuable reading. For those looking for an inclusive history that adjusts or repairs the entrenched canon of sf, this edition of Alternate Worlds will be a disappointment.—Chad Andrews, Toronto, Canada\n\nHerschel’s Moon Voyages.\n\nPaul C. Gutjahr, ed. Voyage to the Moon and Other Imaginary Flights of Fancy in Antebellum America. New York: Anthem, Anthem Nineteenth-Century Series, 2018. xxvii+244 pp. $200 hc.\n\nThe moon has been in the news lately, with China landing on the far side, a super blood moon lunar eclipse, and Kim Stanley Robinson’s seeming anticipation of both those events in his recent Red Moon (2018). It was in the news in the first half of the nineteenth century too, with John Herschel’s astronomical observations and, as Paul C. Gutjahr notes, the American publication of his [Herschel’s] A Treatise on Astronomy (1833) in 1834.\n\nGutjahr assembles four pre-civil-war American tales of moon voyages, along with an historical introduction, several appendices, and a list of “Suggested Further Reading.” The tales are: George Tucker’s Voyage to the Moon (as Joseph Atterley, 1827), Edgar Allan Poe’s “Hans Phall—A Tale” (1835), Richard Adams Locke’s “Great Astronomical Discoveries Lately Made by Sir John Herschel” (1835), and J.L. Riddell’s “Orrin Lindsay’s Plan of Aerial Navigation” (1847). All are available at no cost on line, and the last one was reprinted in SFS (36.2, 2009) in a special issue “On Proto/Early Science Fiction.” The value here lies in the charming introduction that points out connections among the works, the dialog formed by their presence together, and the notes and appendices. Whether this adds up to $200 may be questionable, of course, but Anthem Press has taken the gamble.\n\nTales of moon voyages have been around for a long time and have been written in many different countries, so my first question in looking at this anthology was why it centered specifically on “antebellum America.” Technically, this descriptor applies to the four tales, of course, but are they somehow characteristically American, characteristically representative of pre-civil-war life, especially south of the Mason-Dixon line, as is suggested by “antebellum”? I was disappointed that the introduction did not address these matters. It begins instead with a connection to that uniquely American religion, Mormonism, since Brigham Young apparently “preached about the Moon and its people” (xv). The introduction moves on quickly to “the plurality of worlds theory—that God presided over a host of inhabited planets in the universe” (xv), to the balloon as a device useful for imagining ambitious air travel, and to the influence of the American publication of John Herschel’s A Treatise on Astronomy upon three of the four works in the volume. Gutjahr also discusses “The explosive growth of antebellum American print culture” (xvii) and distrust of fiction in American culture. He then turns specifically to the stories themselves, identifying Atterley/Tucker’s use of “the travelogue-as-social-commentary tradition” (xviii). He sees Poe’s story, which uses some of Tucker’s ideas, as an example of “hard science fiction” (xx) in its incorporation of the science of the day (Tucker was a new professor at the University of Virginia during the brief period when Poe was a student there). We learn that Richard Adams Locke’s story appeared only a few weeks later, serialized in a penny newspaper, The Sun, and caused a great sensation, convincing many readers that it was a true report on the inhabitants of the Moon, much to the admiration, seemingly, of P.T. Barnum. Finally, Gutjahr discusses Leonard Riddell’s story—not technically a voyage at all—written as an educational lecture about what he believed were the conditions on the moon.\n\nThe book’s appendices, representing less available materials, are welcome. The first appendix is an excerpt from Washington Irving’s A History of New York (1809), incorporating the same material that H. Bruce Franklin includes in the foundational Future Perfect: American Science Fiction of the Nineteenth Century (1966). The second is an anonymous 1828 review of Tucker’s book. The remaining four appendices concern Locke’s hoax in one way or another: two responses by Poe, a collection of contemporary responses compiled in a pamphlet by William Gowans in 1859, and P.T. Barnum’s admiring tribute to Locke’s story, written in 1866.\n\nNow to the stories themselves. George Tucker’s Voyage to the Moon, the only book-length work, takes up almost half the volume. Written without the benefit of Herschel’s treatise that appeared seven years later, it describes the purported author Atterley’s adventures in Burma where he is kidnapped, his friendship with an Indian mystic, and their plans to go to the moon using the repellant and attractive properties of a mysterious metal. What follows, then, is an account of the voyage, used as an opportunity to satirize Western culture along with discussions of racial difference, summarized by the narrator in this way: “The great diversities of national character may, perhaps, be attributed principally to moral and accidental causes, but partly also to climate, and to the original diversities in the different races of man” (26). While the author makes clear that he believes some races are better than others (and we can guess who is at the top in his mind), it is relatively mild in its expression. His later judgements of Native Americans and Asians, for example, are more objectionable. On the whole, though, this selection is written in the manner of an orientalist romance.\n\nPoe, who had met Tucker according to the introduction to“Hans Phall,” uses John Herschel’s Treatise to lend verisimilitude to his story. The story implies a hoax (the trip begins on April 1, after all) at the same time as it uses a journal format and infodumps of scientific facts from Herschel to convince the reader of its veracity. It is the cleverest and wittiest of the stories in the volume, as one might expect. Once in a while, it approaches the profound, as when the narrator says, “I believed ... that truth is frequently, of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found” (123). This is especially telling in a story that uses up-to-the-minute data to lend it verisimilitude.\n\nRichard Adams Locke’s story had a bit of the same response as Orson Welles’s radio play of War of the Worlds would in 1938, in that it “led vast numbers of New Yorkers to believe that there was indeed life on the moon” (152). It succeeded in its hoax. Here, no one traveled to the moon—instead the discovery of life is made through one of John Herschel’s telescopes. Scientific babble explains it all. Some of the imagined creatures are quite fetching, including a bipedal beaver and a man-bat. The latter is included in the collection’s cover art, which shows Poe and Herschel flying to the moon in a balloon. "
