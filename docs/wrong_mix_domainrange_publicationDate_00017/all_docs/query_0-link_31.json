        "text": "I recently penned the last entry to a project, begun in 2014, to review all the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard in their publication order. This would seem an apt time to add an afterthought on the perennial question, the selfsame by which Alcuin admonished the monks of Lindisfarne, “What has Ingeld to do with Christ?”\n\nIn the war between the pagan Germans and the civilized Romans of Christendom, Robert E. Howard, author of the far-famed Conan of Cimmeria, was clearly on the side of the German barbarians, our enemies.\n\nSo why do we read him and love him?\n\nThe question is how can a Christian admire Robert E Howard’s Conan stories, which are tales of lurid violence and buccaneering most unchristian in tone and content?\n\nMy answer is that the Catholic Church is truly catholic.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nThe Black Stranger was unpublished in Robert E. Howard’s lifetime. It first appears in Fantasy Magazine, in March 1953, seven months after the posthumous publication of God in the Bowl. It is the second and last of his posthumous publications, not counting fragments and pastiches.\n\nApart from the names of places and protagonists and other cosmetic details, this story is identical with the pirate yarn Swords of the Red Brotherhood, which was eventually published in the Howard anthology Black Vulmea’s Vengeance, Donald M. Grant, 1976. This tale was a prequel to the Spanish Main yarn Black Vulmea’s Vengeance which first appeared in the magazine Golden Fleece in 1938, which stars the Irish freebooter and buccaneer Terrance Vulmea, who is much like Conan in description and action.\n\nThe order in which he wrote them is disputed: some say the Conan story was rewritten as the Vulmea story, others that the Vulmea story was rewritten as a Conan story.\n\nThe Red Indians in the Vulmea story are changed to Picts, the Frenchmen to Zingarans, Englishmen to Barachans, the pirate ship War-Hawk changed to the Red-Hand, and the dainty lady Francoise d’Chastillon is the dainty lady Belesa, while her uncle Count Henri is Count Valenso, matchlocks are changed into crossbows, and off we go.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan, Reviews\n\nHour of the Dragon was first serialized in Weird Tales magazine, appearing between December of 1935 to April of 1936. It was later published by Gnome Press in 1950 in hardback as Conan the Conqueror. The first Weird Tales episode came one month after Man-Eaters of Zamboula. It is the seventeenth published story in the Conan canon, and the last to see print in Robert E Howard’s lifetime. It is also the author’s only novel-length Conan tale.\n\nSpoilers abound below.\n\nIf you have not read it, please avail yourself of that pleasure before reading this review. Like many classics pulps tales of yore, it is available to read without fee, and you may enjoy it.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nA Witch Shall Be Born was first published in Weird Tales magazine in December of 1934, coming one month after the final installment of People of the Black Circle. It is the thirteenth published story in the Conan canon.\n\nIt is also, alas, one of the weaker and more forgettable Conan stories to spring from the masterful pen of Robert E. Howard, but, ironically, it contains one of the strongest and most memorable Conan scenes.\n\nI have no doubt that every fan of Conan already knows which scene I mean. Since it is, perhaps, the best Conan scene ever, it was lifted wholly from the story and placed into the John Milius’ 1982 film CONAN THE BARBARIAN.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan\n\nThe People of the Black Circle was published first published in Weird Tales magazine in three parts over the September, October and November 1934 issues. It is the twelfth published story in the Conan canon.\n\nThe first installment appeared one month after Devil in Iron, the previous story. Readers during the fall of 1934 enjoyed a continual diet of Conan yarns.\n\nThis is also the first novel-length outing for Conan, and one of Howard’s better efforts (albeit even his worst are better than many a man’s best).\n\nThere are sorcerers aplenty among the unearthly menaces in various Conan tales up until now: Thoth-amon in Phoenix on the Sword, Tsotha in The Scarlet Citadel, Yara in Tower of the Elephant, Thugra Khotan in The Black Colossus: but here Conan invades the Black Seers of Yimsha, who are the Roke or the Hogwarts of the Hyborian Age.\n\nHe therefore runs afoul not of one warlock or necromancer, but of a whole organization of students and masters of the Dark Arts, and he storms their eerie haunted fortress behind its moat of venomous mists at the climax.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan\n\n“For every beast and for every man there is a trap he will not escape”\n\nThe Devil in Iron was published in the August 1934 issue of Weird Tales, several months after the previous story, Queen of the Black Coast. It is the eleventh published story in the Conan canon.\n\nWe have reached the halfway mark of the published Conan stories completed by Robert E. Howard.\n\nHoward here recycles elements of his own previous stories – there is a magic blade as in Phoenix on the Sword, the sole bane of an otherwise invulnerable eldritch monster, who is a resurrected necromancer as in The Black Colossus. He resurrects his ancient capital: a haunted city of greenish stone existing without fields or pastures, inhabited by dream-addled sleepwalkers as seen in Xuthal of the Dusk; he is a metal statue raised in grim mockery of life as in Iron Shadows in the Moon.\n\nConan sees the eldritch backstory of the foe in a convenient vision, as he likewise did in Queen of the Black Coast; and Conan’s sole motive here is neither loot, revenge, or love of adventure, but the raw lascivious lust as was on display in Frost Giant’s Daughter.\n\nOne assumes barbarians prefer blondes.\n\nIn previous Conan tales, I have complimented Howard’s lyricism, his well knit plots, his adroit use of narrative structure. Here, the evidence of his talent is muted. This reads more like one of the pastiches or homages of Conan by later writers.\n\nWhile enjoyable, it is, frankly, not one of Robert E Howard’s better efforts.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan\n\nIn May of 1934, Robert E Howard’s Queen of the Black Coast was published in Weird Tales. This column is the second to review the story. The first part is here.\n\nMany a fan, this one included, calls Queen of the Black Coast the finest of the Conan stories, in part because of its legendary scope, in part because of its lurid romance, it passages of lyrical poetry, its vivid and bloody battle-scenes, the sense of mystery and adventure, the chilling eldritch visions of ancient eons and shades of the dead, the Viking funeral at the end.\n\nThe writing excels on three levels: first, striking characterization gives life to an intimate and tragic romance; second, lyrical world-building conjures a vision of a lost age, cruel but not without its savage beauties; third, a deep and even grim theme dignifies what would otherwise be a mere boy’s adventure tale with adumbration of deep time and an almost Norse melancholy touching the brevity of life, the indifference of the gods.\n\nLet us look at each in turn.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan\n\nBelieve green buds awaken in the spring,\n\nThat autumn paints the leaves with somber fire;\n\nBelieve I held my heart inviolate\n\nTo lavish on one man my hot desire.\n\nThe Song of Belît\n\nQueen of the Black Coast was published in the May, 1934, issue of Weird Tales, one month after the previous story, Iron Shadows in the Moon. It is the tenth published story in the Conan canon.\n\nThe tale cannot be discussed without spoilers, so be warned.\n\nThis should be the introductory tale to any curious but uninitiated reader: it is the best to date.\n\nThe passions are deeper and richer than a mere adventure story, the prose both in dry humor and dark pathos is some of Howard’s best, the supernatural horror strikes grimly close to Conan’s heart, and the whole as a legendary feel to it, from the madcap flight on horseback in the opening scene, to the viking funeral at the close.\n\nHere, for the first time, Conan meets a woman as fierce, wild, bold and free as himself. She is his equal and more.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan\n\nFrost Giant’s Daughter is not the name of the eighth story published in the Conan canon of Robert E Howard’s Hyborian Age tales, but it belongs in eighth place in a complete list, if it belongs anywhere. A word of explanation is in order.\n\nThis was originally a Conan story, and, based on the internal chronology, his first adventure, when he was still a barbarian wanderer and warrior among the northern tribes. Farnsworth Wright, the editor of Weird Tales, rejected it. Thrifty as all writers must be, Howard renamed the main character “Amra of Akbitana” retitled it Gods of the North, and under that name published it in the March 1934 issue of The Fantasy Fan. In its original form as a Conan yarn it was not published in Howard’s brief lifetime.\n\nI regret to say that Farnsworth Wright’s decision is a defensible one: this story is below Robert E Howard’s expected level. Were one to read it with the name of the author hidden, it would not be recognized as his work.\n\nHoward’s Conan stories are known and famed for driving, nonstop plots, memorable characters, for vivid descriptions of dramatic action sequences, for the portrayal of raw savagery (and its concomitant superiority to the corruption and softness of civilization), for exotic locales, eldritch horrors, memorable prose. Here, each element was muted, or missing.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Conan\n\nBelow is a list of reviews of the canonical and complete Robert E Howard Conan stories, including Red Nails, the last one published in his lifetime. As time permits, the list grows and the links will become active.\n\nThe list is chronological and includes essays on Conan, and links to online sites where the originals are in the public domain.\n\nRead the remainder of this entry »\n\nFiled in Announcement, Conan"
