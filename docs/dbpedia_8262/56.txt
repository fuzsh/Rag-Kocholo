To celebrate the 60th anniversary of Doctor Who, a special colourised 75-minute omnibus edition of The Daleks featuring a brand new soundtrack by Mark Ayres will be released on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer on 23rd November.

The classic serial launched Dalekmania and is often attributed to cementing the success of the long-running BBC sci-fi series and making Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks, a fortune.

Phil Collinson, Executive Producer says: “It’s been my absolute pleasure to spend this past 12 months working with such a talented team to breathe new life into this classic adventure - a story that is literally the foundation stone of all that Doctor Who has become. The original is a masterpiece of 1960’s television drama and this new version stands on the shoulders of the pioneering spirit of 1960’s Doctor Who.”

With the launch of The Whoniverse on iPlayer, it's The Five Faces of Doctor Who but bigger on the inside. Growing up, I never imagined instantly accessing all eras of Doctor Who! Target novelisations, Marvel UK’s Doctor Who Weekly, books, off-air recordings, Denys Fisher toys and expensive omnibus VHS releases (beginning with Revenge of the Cybermen) were the order of the day.

The Star Beast, the first of three 60th anniversary specials starring David Tennant (Doctor Who) and Catherine Tate (Donna Noble), will be broadcast on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and Disney+ outside the UK and Ireland on 25th November.
