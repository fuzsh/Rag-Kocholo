        "text": "Dr Who And The Daleks is a 1965 sci-fi movie from the time of “Dalekmania”—available on Amazon Prime Video and Blu-ray formats. This UK production bases itself on the ‘Doctor Who’ TV serial where a TARDIS-aware genius and his companions first cross paths with a big-name foe. There is solid source material for the film to work with, providing audiences with decent enough escapism, but perhaps might not be to everyone’s taste.\n\n★★★✰✰\n\nWhen did you last enjoy a bit of Doctor Who? It’s not exclusively a TV phenomenon of course, having spawned a tonne of BBC-approved books, audiobooks, and even a trio of movies. The first connected movie was 1965’s Dr Who And The Daleks, bringing the Doctor (sort of) and his most beloved adversary together for cinema-going audiences for the first time. Audiences get to witness a significant meeting of minds on the planet Skaro, but the film’s undoubtable strengths nevertheless sit with a few features that may possibly lessen its appeal for some.\n\nWhen transferring a TV show to the medium of cinema, it’s only natural that the final product would owe a fair bit to its televised relative. Dr Who And The Daleks is no exception, with a lot of the story being traceable to a televised serial from 1963 which comprised seven black-and-white episodes. With a noticeably colourful and (relatively) well-funded aesthetic, the film arrived shortly after the show’s increasingly popular third year when the “Dalekmania” craze was in full-swing. It was a big commercial success at the time of launch, and may well win itself some new fans nearly sixty years on.\n\nThe movie’s story follows the eccentric inventor “Dr Who” (a human in this case) who sets off on an unexpected journey with three companions (including his granddaughter Susan) in his TARDIS time machine due to a physical blunder. This kickstarts their journey and quite literally sends them somewhere otherworldly. Before you know it, the team is treading on uncharted territory, bumping into the various inhabitants of an unfamiliar planet—some of whom are more foe than friend. It proves to be an extraordinary and indeed educational experience.\n\nThankfully, Dr Who And The Daleks retains a sense of adventure and charm also visible with the TV show that inspired it. Its easy-to-follow and accessible nature means that even those with no previous Who understanding can watch the film. The productions’ narrative is sound; it’s entertaining enough to devote a viewing to even today, with sequences that are well-paced that keep the viewer engaged. Dominant in film-tone as the story unravels is one of drama and continual progression. Whilst there are a few darker moments, dark tones are absent for the vast majority of the movie. This might displease some, or incentivise others to watch. The sense of surprise is mostly weak however, despite the seriousness of some scenes. The lack of depth that characterises other sci-fi tales may leave some viewers wanting here.\n\nCharacters are well-acted and—for the main—fairly interesting, with one of the best being the disadvantaged race known as the Thals. Peter Cushing’s interpretation of the Doctor is good enough to pass for this cinematic trip in time and space, but perhaps not as compelling a watch as William Hartnell’s more memorable version in the same story. And what of the movie’s other title star? Or should that be stars? Yes, the brilliant and beloved Daleks look excellent and provide a considerable amount of on-screen amusement. Nevertheless, there was something underwhelming about the mutants in mini-tanks, perhaps not appearing as threatening and formidable as fans know they can be. That could partly be down to the aforementioned audience that the film originally targeted. The presence of the Daleks nevertheless offers a fine incentive to seek out the film. With regards to the orchestral soundtrack, the music feels impressive but could maybe have captured the eeriness of some scenes better.\n\nAppearance matters, and has always had a discernible impact on our opinions of series and movies throughout the ages. Classic Doctor Who (pre-2005) is often deemed to be some of the best UK-produced TV of its era, but has also been said to have aged poorly in the visuals department. Created on a budget of £180,000 (over £4.2 million today), Dr Who And The Daleks certainly looks of its time, but visually has aged reasonably well overall. The on-screen environments can convey an impressive sense of size, plus the use of colour also lifts this production, adding extra life and vibrancy to proceedings. Some designs are basic but there’s certainly creativity on display—a characteristic of the corresponding show. Worth a mention also is the widescreen format used, which gives you a number of truly brilliant shots. The filmmakers evidently worked really hard to ensure this production looked a bit special—something aesthetically-pleasing enough to attract paying audiences at the time away from the television sets and into the theatres.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nOn balance, Dr Who And The Daleks is a flawed but very watchable attempt at adapting an important TV story from early ‘Doctor Who’ instalments for the silver screen. In a few ways, it actually betters the black-and-white serials that it borrows so much from, although the older versions will probably hold a stronger, more weighty appeal to fans. The story of derring-do and the film’s visual qualities are plus points, but the less menacing nature of the Daleks here has the potential to be a minus for some. I would recommend the digitally restored Dr Who And The Daleks to people with an interest in Doctor Who, enthusiasts of old school British cinema, and of course, fans of the infamous Daleks.\n\nWords by James Gillespie\n\nSupport The Indiependent"
