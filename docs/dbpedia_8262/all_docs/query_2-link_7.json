(Descriptions taken from the BBC DVD liner notes unless referenced otherwise.)\n\nSeries overviews[]\n\nWhose Doctor Who - Introduced by Melvyn Bragg. Actors, writers, designers, directors and producers have come and gone but Dr Who remains one of the most popular family shows ever devised for British television. Despite all the changes, the programme maintains a consistent core of themes, in the Doctor's philosophy, his relations with his companions, his foibles and failings as well as his multifarious talents, and in the nature of the evil foes he pits himself against. Using scenes from episodes involving all four Doctors (William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker), tonight's programme will explore the ideas and attitudes which have characterised the series from the beginning. Appearing in the programme (as themselves) are Tom Baker, viewers young and old, along with a galaxy of monsters from Autons to Zarbis.[1] (3 April 1977 - BBC Two)\n\nResistance is Useless - In this compilation of the Doctor's trials and tribulations over the past 26 years, prepare to enter the world of the Daleks, Cybermen, Yetis, Monoids, and the Master.[2] (3 January 1992 - BBC Two)\n\n30 Years in the TARDIS - Following the first episode of the first-ever adventure (An Unearthly Child) on 23 November 1963, Doctor Who became to many viewers the most consistently imaginative, inspiring and good-humoured series on British television. The seven Doctors and their various assistants are fondly remembered, and their relative merits hotly debated by generations of fans. This special documentary, made by a lifelong fan of the series, brings together Doctors Jon Pertwee, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy with assistants Nicola Bryant (Peri), Frazer Hines (Jamie), Elisabeth Sladen (Sarah Jane) and Debbie Watling (Victoria) to recall three decades of time travel, endearingly cheap special effects and monsters such as Cybermen, Sea Devils, Zygons, Yetis, Autons and the most evil aliens of all: Daleks. Classic clips, interviews, behind-the-scenes anecdotes and even Doctor Who \"bloopers\" feature in this special birthday tribute.[3] (29 November 1993 - BBC One)\n\nMore than 30 Years in the TARDIS - An extended version of a documentary first show in November 1993 as part of the 30th anniversary celebration of everybody's favourite science-fiction series, Doctor Who. Including contributions from Doctors Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, plus a whole gang of their companions, More than 30 Years in the TARDIS was a fitting tribute to a series that had ended in 1989. With many stunning recreations of classic scenes, this special documentary contains rare footage, deleted scenes and classic monsters as you've never seen them before... (7 November 1994 - BBC Video)\n\nThe Doctors - More than 30 years have now passed since a certain time travelling police box first materialised on our television screens, and the exploits of its various crews have enthralled audiences ever since. Here is the story of Britain's Number 1 Science Fiction programme told in order of the various actors who have played the Doctor. This includes specially shot interviews with Sylvester McCoy, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Jon Pertwee, all of whom share their memories of bringing the scripts to life before the cameras. There is, for the first time, previously unseen behind the scenes home movie footage taken from such adventures as The Smugglers, The Abominable Snowmen, The Dæmons and the unfinished Tom Baker story Shada. There is a unique collection of unpublished photographs spanning all of the 7 Doctors. The programme also includes a look at the newly designed Ice Warrior and Cyberman models which are to be used in a forthcoming production. Apart from the various actors who have played the Doctor, the programme also includes past production personnel such as director David Maloney, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and former BBC Head of Serials and Drama, Shaun Sutton. There are also a host of actors who have played the Doctor's various assistants down the years, each giving us an insight into what made the scripts so special. The Doctors, Thirty Years of Time Travel and Beyond is based on the best selling book by Adrian Rigelsford and offers a comprehensive and candid look at a series that continues to grow in popularity, even though the series came to an end in 1989, and proves that the Doctor will certainly never be forgotten.[4] (September 1995 - Master Vision)\n\nAdventures in Space and Time - Documentary charting the history of the time-travelling maverick, including contributions from writers and actors who have worked on the series, plus clips featuring all the Doctor's incarnations.[5] (13 November 1999 - BBC Two)\n\nThe Story of Doctor Who - Was it the spooky music, scary rubber monsters or cries of \"exterminate!\" that sent you scuttling behind the sofa? Forty years after the TARDIS first flickered into view, key names associated with the series - including former Time Lords Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, and Sylvester McCoy - recall their time on the cult show.[6] (30 December 2003 - BBC One)\n\nDoctor Who: Tales from the TARDIS - An all-new special, Tales from the TARDIS, features the series' actors and producers sharing their experiences and memories of the world's longest-running sci-fi show. The special features exclusive interviews with principal cast members from the shows 50-year history, including actors who have played the Doctor: Matt Smith, David Tennant, Tom Baker, and Peter Davison, actors who have played companions: Jenna Coleman, Karen Gillan, Freema Agyeman, and William Russell, as well as the current lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat.

Plus, a look at The Doctor's many travelling companions and adversaries over the years and how they all contribute to creating the longest running sci-fi show of all time. The programme features David Tennant, Paul McGann, Sylvester McCoy, Noel Clarke, Rick Edwards, Konnie Huq, McFly, Joel Dommett and many more.[8] (18 November 2013 - BBC Three)\n\nMe, You and Doctor Who - Why has a kids TV show about an eccentric man with a box that can travel anywhere in time and space become the BBC's longest running TV drama - and one of Britain's biggest brands? On its 50th anniversary, lifelong fan Matthew Sweet argues you ignore Doctor Who at your peril. It may be a piece of children's television, but he believes it's one of the most important cultural artefacts of modern Britain. Put simply, Doctor Who matters. In this hour-long Culture Show special, BBC Two's flagship arts programme explores with wit, authority and affection, why Doctor Who has become entrenched in British life. Matthew Sweet traces the 50 years of extraordinary social change and uncertainty that sent generations of children scuttling behind the sofa. How did a pepper pot, the Nazis and a sink plunger result in the scariest adversaries of our time - the Daleks? Sweet argues how in turn the show became a cultural horse in its own right, influencing music, design and storytelling - whether pioneering electronica (Delia Derbyshire), or giving the unknown Douglas Adams a crucial break. Matthew meets both famous faces as well as cast, crew and Doctors past and present (from current Doctor Matt Smith to Richard Martin, the maverick director who first brought the Daleks to screens in 1964) to find out how Doctor Who has changed our culture.[9] (22 November 2013 - BBC Two)\n\nEra overviews[]\n\n1960s[]\n\nDoctor Who: Origins - A fascinating 55-minute documentary, detailing the creation of Doctor Who.
