        "text": "Originally transmitted from December 1963 to February 1964, The Daleks introduced one of the Doctorâ€™s most formidable and enduring foes. The story follows the very first crew of the TARDIS as they land in a petrified forest on an alien planet. Determined to explore, the Doctor (William Hartnell) leads his companions into the metal city, where they discover danger at every corner and what will become his deadliest enemy, the mutant Daleks.\n\nThe seven original 25-minute episodes have now been colourised and weaved together into a 75-minute blockbuster. With brand new sound and a new score - created by Mark Ayres - The Daleks has been gloriously updated, whilst ensuring the original classic story remains as thrilling as it was when it was first seen back in 1963.\n\nThis release also includes the original seven episodes on DVD in black & white, as they were first broadcast plus a 15-minute exclusive featurette and all special features from the previous release.\n\nCredits:\n\nStarring William Hartnell, Carole Ann Ford, Jacqueline Hill and William Russell.\n\nWritten by Terry Nation.\n\nDirected by Christopher Barry and Richard Martin."
