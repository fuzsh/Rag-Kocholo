        "text": "The Daleks in Colour\n\nIt's time to encounter the Daleks once again, but this time in a way you've never seen them before. Originally transmitted in December 1963 to February 1964, the seven original episodes of the first Dalek story have received a cosmic makeover, dazzlingly colourised and weaved together into a 75-minute blockbuster. With brand new sound and a brand new score created by Mark Ayres, The Daleks has been gloriously updated, whilst ensuring the original story remains as thrilling as it was in 1963."
