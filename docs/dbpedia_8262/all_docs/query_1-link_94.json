        "text": "Doctor Who, the longest-running action-adventure television series in the world, turned 60 in November. And, true to form after all of those years traveling in space and time, it’s only just beginning. The quintessentially British show, owned by the BBC and produced by BBC Studios alongside Bad Wolf Studios, has begun a partnership with Disney that is already taking the show’s brand and commercial potential into a whole new dimension.\n\nIn its archive of content, now known as “The Whoniverse,” the series has more than 800 episodes."
