        "text": "Dalek\n\nDaleks are hostile entities that seek to eradicate all other living beings.\n\nAttributes\n\nDaleks currently have three variants, each with their own attributes\n\nRegular\n\nHealth: 80 (40 hearts)\n\nMovement Speed: 0.55\n\nAttack Damage: 5 (2.5 hearts)\n\nAttacks per Second: 1\n\nCan Fly: True\n\nRusty\n\nHealth: 60 (30 hearts)\n\nMovement Speed: 0.4\n\nAttack Damage: 2 (1 heart)\n\nAttacks per Second: 0.5\n\nCan Fly: False\n\nSpecial Weapons\n\nHealth: 120 (60 hearts)\n\nMovement Speed: 0.5\n\nAttack Damage: 10 (5 hearts) + Explosion Damage (if enabled via server config)\n\nAttacks per Second: 0.6\n\nCan Fly: True\n\nAI Behavior\n\nDaleks will target all living entities by default. This can be configured via the Tardis server config file, such as ignoring villagers, ageable animal entities.\n\nSome exceptions are:\n\nRaider entities such as Pillagers, Vindicators\n\nArmor Stands (which are living entities)\n\nSome Dalek variants can also fly or hover over air blocks and will do so to reach their targets\n\nVariants\n\nThe Special Weapons variant shoots explosive lasers by default. The laser explosion can be configured to only occur for impacts on blocks, and respects mob griefing game-rules.\n\nThe Rusty variant is a weakened variant. It has reduced fighting and movement capabilities.\n\nSpawn Behavior\n\nGenerated Structures\n\nDaleks spawn inside and around their Dalek Ship structures and do not spawn elsewhere naturally.\n\nDaleks currently do not despawn naturally.\n\nVillage Raids\n\nDaleks are also classified as Raider entities, so they will join in Village Raids alongside other raiders such as Pillagers. The Dalek's ability to join raids, and the number of Daleks per raid wave can be configured in the Tardis Common file.\n\nSpawn Drops"
