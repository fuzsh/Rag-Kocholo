We however are eternally grateful for his contribution to three of the four (official) titles in the film series that helped launch the career of one Steven Spielberg: Jaws.\n\nRoy Scheider, Peter Benchley and Carl Gottlieb on the set of Jaws\n\nCarl Gottlieb, that is the name of our birthday-boy today, is the man responsible for the translation of Peter Benchley's novel to a screenplay. During the entire filming process of Jaws, Cottlieb was so heavily involved in everything (with re-writes of the script , whenever Bruce wasn't co-operating and also because he had a bit part in the film), that he decided to start a diary on making the film. When it was published, after the film had come out, as “The Jaws Log”, the book became an international bestseller and to this day is still one of the most successful books about the making of a film, ever published and has seen many reprints and anniversary editions.\n\nIrony has it that the Jaws film series has brought out the best and worst of Cottlieb as a writer, for he received nominations for best and for worst screenplay for his work on various of the films, for Jaws he received an Academy Award Nomination for Best Screenplay of 1975 and for Jaws 3-D he was awarded with a Raspberry Award Nomination for Worst Screenplay of 1983, he won neither of them.\n\nFrom left to right: Roy Scheider, Robert Nevin, Murray Hamilton\n\nand Carl Gottlieb in a scene from Jaws\n\nNowadays he is a highly respected guest at various cons and fan gatherings all over the world.\n\nHappy 77th Birthday, Mr. Gottlieb\n\nRonny.\n\nThe Bearded Trio - The Site For Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and John Williams\n\nTHE BEARDED TRIO ON FACEBOOK\n\nTHE BEARDED TRIO ON TWITTER\n\nTHE BEARDED TRIO ON GOOGLE+\n\nTHE BEARDED TRIO ON PINTEREST\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FACTS ON STEVEN SPIELBERG\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FACTS ON GEORGE LUCAS\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FACTS ON JOHN WILLIAMS\n\nLabels\n\nThe Famous Indiana Jones Fly In Belloq's Mouth Scene. Did It Really Happen? I've always wondered if Paul Freeman unintentionally consumed a fly in this scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark ? It's the scene where Indiana Jones shouts down to Bellosh...I mean Belloq and threatens to blow up the ark. Did a fly go in his mouth? I remember watching this scene back in the early eighties and my ten year old mind thought he definitely had a snack while filming. I recall talking about 'flygate' in my school playground at the time and the general consensus with my friends was that Freeman definitely had a sneaky snack. Paul Freeman talks about the famous 'fly' scene in an interview with TheIndyExperience.com and settled 'flygate:' This is a bit of a dicey question so don’t get too upset. (Laughs) A movie’s always got bloopers in it, some have a lot, and some only have three or four. And the most remarkable blooper was right before the opening of th\n\nStar Wars VII Movie Poster Just saw this Star Wars VII movie poster on Kyle Newman's Facebook fee d. The poster is by Lyndon Berresford and Paul Bateman. I am loving this. Who do you think the two characters are? Lando and Leia? Han and Leia's children?

If you're a fan of the 1982 Horror classic, Poltergeist then you will be very familiar with that \"weird\" cut in the movie. It's 32 minutes and 47 seconds in to the movie and the scene is where Diane is explaining the strange phenomenon that is happening in the kitchen. First, she shows to Steve a chair scraping across the floor all on its own then she does the same with Carol Anne. Steve leans up against the kitchen wall and is completely shocked at what just happened. It's at this point Diane starts to explain the sensation of being pulled and then...A very abrupt cut. One moment we are listening to Diane and suddenly it cuts to Diane and Steve at their next door neighbours door. Why the sudden cut? It's on the VHS, DVD, Blu-Ray and even the streaming versions. Why does this awful and weird cut exist in the movie, Poltergeist? Watch the clip below to see the cut: Well, the ans"
