        "text": "Promises and Perils of Emerging Health Innovations\n\nThursday, April 11 and Friday, April 12, 2019\n\nNortheastern University\n\nHealth care is rapidly changing. Over the last decade, striking innovations, including artificial intelligence, robotics, mobile technology, gene therapies, pharmaceuticals, big data analytics, tele- and virtual health care delivery, have been developed as new entities and modes of delivery, from accountable care organizations (ACOs) to retail minute-clinics, have entered the market. More dramatic innovations and market disruptions are likely in the years to come. These new technologies and market disruptions offer immense promise to advance health care quality and efficiency, as well as improve provider and patient engagement. Success will depend, however, on careful consideration of potential perils and well-planned interventions to ensure new methods ultimately further, rather than diminish, the health of patients, especially those who are the most vulnerable.\n\nThroughout the two-day conference, interdisciplinary experts, policymakers, academics, and providers attempted to answer myriad questions, including:\n\nWhat are the legal, policy, and ethical considerations regarding new health technologies? New forms of organization?\n\nWhat safety and privacy issues will arise from new health technologies? How will this change over time?\n\nWhat protections can we put into place to protect privacy as the market changes and technologies evolve?\n\nWho is ultimately accountable for the development, use, and oversight of emerging health technologies and innovations?\n\nWhat legal mechanisms exist for promoting access to and serving underserved populations?\n\nShould new innovations focus on clinical health care, population health, public health, or some combination?\n\nWhom do these new technologies and entities ultimately serve (providers, patients, private companies) and how does that lens impact how we incorporate them into the health care system?\n\nKeynote Speaker\n\nJohn D. Halamka, M.D.\n\nChief Information Officer, Beth Israel Deaconess System\n\nJohn D. Halamka, M.D., is the chief information officer (CIO) at Beth Israel Deaconess System, chairman of the New England Healthcare Exchange Network (NEHEN), and a practicing emergency physician. He is also the International Healthcare Innovation professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\nDr. Halamka completed his undergraduate studies at Stanford University, where he received a degree in medical microbiology and a degree in public policy with a focus on technology issues. He entered medical school at the University of California, San Francisco and simultaneously pursued graduate work in bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley focusing on technology issues in medicine. He completed his residency at Harbor–UCLA Medical Center in the Department of Emergency Medicine.\n\nIn his role at BIDMC, Dr. Halamka is responsible for all clinical, financial, administrative, and academic information technology, serving 3,000 doctors, 12,000 employees, and 1,000,000 patients. As chairman of NEHEN, Dr. Halamka oversees clinical and administrative data exchange among the payers, providers, and patients in Massachusetts. As a Harvard professor, he has served the George W. Bush administration, the Obama administration, and national governments throughout the world planning their healthcare IT strategy.\n\nDr. Halamka has authored five books on technology-related issues, hundreds of articles and thousands of posts on the popular Geekdoctor blog.\n\nHe runs Unity Farm in Sherborn, MA and serves as caretaker for 150 animals, 30 acres of agricultural production and a cidery/winery.\n\nAfternoon Featured Speaker\n\nRick Berke\n\nExecutive Editor, STAT\n\nRick Berke, executive editor, oversees STAT's editorial team. He was previously a longtime reporter and editor at the New York Times, where he served as White House correspondent, chief political correspondent, Washington editor, national editor, video content editor, and assistant managing editor. More recently, Rick was executive editor at Politico. Before he turned to chasing politicians, Rick's first major investigative series, for the Baltimore Evening Sun and Regardie's magazine, was a deep look at the science, history, one-time glamor, discoveries, and tax dodges behind the Howard Hughes Medical Institute ⎯ and its eccentric founder.\n\nDiseases of Despair: The Role of Policy and Law\n\nThursday, April 12 and Friday, April 13, 2018\n\nNortheastern University\n\nAnne Case and Angus Deaton shocked the world with their 2015 report that noted an increase in all-cause mortality among middle-aged white non-Hispanic men and women in the United States. This pattern is not occurring in other groups within the United States and Europe. Their report, and others since then, have linked this trend to so-called deaths of despair (death from suicide, chronic substance use and overdoses) and their linkage to other determinants of health (education, labor markets, marital patterns). A 2017 update to the report makes it clear that this trend is no longer limited to any particular geographic region within the United States.\n\nThis year’s conference and associated scholarship brought together experts, policymakers and academics to discuss the causes behind such trends, and to explore potential political, policy and legal responses for addressing broader determinants that affect the physical and mental health of Americans dying from these diseases of despair. Deeper examination into similar patterns among diverse populations, as well as analysis of continuing racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities, were central to the discourse.\n\nThis Week in Health Law (TWIHL) Broadcasts Live From #DiseasesofDespair\n\nTWIHL, our 2018 conference podcast partner, recorded special episodes live from Diseases of Despair. Along with TWIHL host Nicolas Terry, NUSL Professor Leo Beletsky acted as co-host and spoke with several of our conference speakers. Check out the related Bill of Health blog post for some background information on the discussions and to see a list of recommended reading.\n\nEpisodes 136 & 137: Listen here and here!\n\nProgram\n\nThursday, April 12, 2018\n\nRaytheon Amphitheater, Egan Research Center, Northeastern University\n\n1:30 - 2:30 PM\n\nOpening Remarks:\n\nRepresentative Patrick KennedyThe Honorable Patrick J. Kennedy is a former member of the US House of Representatives and the nation’s leading political voice on mental illness, addiction and other brain diseases. During his 16-year career representing Rhode Island in Congress, he fought a national battle to end medical and societal discrimination against these illnesses, highlighted by his lead sponsorship of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 — and his brave openness about his own health challenges.\n\nThe son of Senator Edward “Ted” Kennedy, he decided to leave Congress not long after his father’s death to devote his career to advocacy for brain diseases and to create a new, healthier life and start a family. He has since founded the Kennedy Forum, which unites the community of mental health, and co-founded One Mind, a global leader in open science collaboration in brain research. Kennedy is also the co-author of A Common Struggle, which outlines both his personal story and a bold plan for the future of mental health in America. Representative Kennedy was appointed in May 2017 to sit on the Trump administration’s Presidential Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crises.\n\nKennedy is living in long-term recovery from opiate addiction in New Jersey with his wife, Amy, and their four children.\n\n2:30 - 4:30 PM\n\nAcademic Paper Workshop in Collaboration with the Northeastern University Law Review\n\nSelected papers will be published in the Winter 2019 Issue of the Northeastern University Law Review.

This one-day conference brought together leading policymakers, practitioners and academics to explore the dangers of such diseases and to discuss the development of effective, evidence-based, legally sound and ethically appropriate policy responses.\n\nKeynote Speaker:\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci\n\nDirector, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n\nChief, NIAID Laboratory of Immunoregulation\n\nNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland\n\nAnthony Fauci is director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the U.S. National Institutes of Health, where he oversees an extensive research portfolio devoted to preventing, diagnosing and treating infectious and immune-mediated diseases.
