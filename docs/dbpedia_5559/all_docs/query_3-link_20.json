He was educated in the public schools of his native town and early in life learned the carpentering and building trade. At the age of twenty-two he immigrated to America, settling at Suspension Bridge and at once found employment at his trade, which he followed until 1892. when he built his present planing mill and established himself in the general lumber and building business.
