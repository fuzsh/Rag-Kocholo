        "text": "Letter of Solidarity From Alumni of the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Flint, and Dearborn\n\nDear President Santa J. Ono, the University of Michigan Administration and the Board of Regents,\n\nWe, the undersigned alumni from the University of Michigan — Ann Arbor, Dearborn, and Flint — demand that the University end its pattern of harassing, threatening, and disciplining students for mobilizing againstillegal occupation,apartheid, andgenocide. Through its actions and inaction, the University has institutionalized anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim animus, and perpetuated and funded the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.\n\nAs alumni, we pledge to withhold our donations to the University and sever ties with the University (including volunteer, networking and recruitment efforts) until the following demands are met:\n\nDROP all penalties —legal, academic, or otherwise—against students arrested for protesting for Palestinian human rights. End militarized and violent policing against students on campus.\n\nREAFFIRM the First Amendment rights of students, faculty, and staff. The University of Michigan must abide by its principles of academic-freedom and free expression on campus. The University must cease its repression of political dissent in support of the human rights of Palestinians. We echo the Michigan Jewish community’scall to resist the harmful conflation of critique of Israel with antisemitism.\n\nPROTECT Palestinian students and their allies from anti-Palestinian, anti-Muslim, and anti-Jewish hostility. We echo thedemands of the multicultural coalition of 55+ student organizations calling on the University to conduct a formal inquiry into the racism and harassment they have experienced.\n\nDIVEST from companies that profit from Israel’s occupation and human rights abuses. We note that both former and current University presidents and Regents unilaterally and anti-democratically ignored the student body referendum to divest in 2017.\n\nDISCONTINUE exchange programs and strategic partnerships with Israeli universities, as Israel’s apartheid policies restrict access to such programs for Palestinian students, staff, and faculty of the University, making such partnerships stand in violation of theUniversity’s own anti-discrimination policy.\n\nIsrael’s horrific indiscriminate bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza has already murdered over **15,000 Palestinians, nearly half of them children, while escalating settler and military violence in the West Bank has killed more than 200Palestinians in the course of just seven weeks. In a suffocating escalation of Israel’s 16-yearblockade on Gaza, theethnic cleansing campaign subjects two million people to death by starvation, dehydration and disease bydepriving Palestinians in Gaza of food, fuel, electricity, clean water, and humanitarian aid. Israeli airstrikes have cruellytargetedrefugee camps,homes, universities,mosques,churches,UN Schools, evacuationcorridors, andhospitals, including the use ofwhite phosphorus munitions. Israeli officials at the highest level of government have made their genocidal intentions clear, as noted byhuman rights officials,legal experts,and genocidescholars. The unfolding genocide in Gaza represents the most brutal escalation in Israel’s hundred-year war on Palestinian life, land, and dignity—perpetrated through a system of colonization, military occupation, and apartheid supported by our tax dollars and tuition.\n\nIt is in this context that the University, on November 17, marshaled inpolice from over 10 Michigan jurisdictions to kettle, assault, and arrest students who were engaged in civil disobedience in Ruthven Hall. In a disgraceful display ofexcessive use of force, police officers body slammed and handcuffed students, and even ripped off a student’s hijab. The University of Michigan police officers also deprived students of basic necessities including water and bathroom access. The University’s pattern of harassing, threatening, and disciplining students for protesting human rights violations is unconscionable.\n\nAs a public institution dedicated to education, the University has failed in its moral mandate to be a guiding voice for justice and compassion. Outside of its failures to condemn atrocities on the world stage, it has also failed in its duty to hear, protect and represent its student body, choosing to ignore calls for dialogue and action and instead, respond to peaceful protest with violence.\n\nThis is not the first time. Since 2017, Ann Arbor’s Central Student Government, an elected body representing the student population, haspassed resolutions demanding the Administration investigate divestment from companies manufacturing the Israeli occupation.The University has failed to heed these demands, not only for the last six years, but since students began advocating for divestment in 2002. Mass student protests have been a cornerstone across the history of all three campuses, from2008 to2015,2018,2021, and2023. CSG has twice put outadditionalstatements, only to be met by institutional silence.Students unfairly blacklisted for using their voice have received no support. Faculty who have supported such sentiments, as in 2018,have been punished for exercising their academic freedom. Even faculty and staff have recognized the administration’s hypocrisy whenover 1000 criticized President Ono’s apathy towards Palestinian students. To that end, the facultySenate Assembly passed a resolution demanding that the University be more transparent about its investments in Israel.\n\nWe, as alumni, know all too well the University’slong history of silencing students standing for justice. In 1966, the University banned sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement. It arrested over 500 students protesting the Vietnam War, meeting students with riot squads, attack dogs, rooftop snipers, and tear gas. Students marched for more than10 years until the universitydivested from South African apartheid in 1988. Your alumniprotested the Iraq war in 2002,police brutality in 2016, andclimate injustice in 2019. Decades later, images of these protests grace the halls of the new Trotter Center and your own promotional materials, but past generations of students remember. We protested then as your students do now.\n\nWe condemn the University of Michigan’s violent repression of student protests, part of thenationwide suppression of Palestinian solidarity. We stand with the coalition of 55+ student organizations, including Students Allied for Freedom and Equality and Jewish Voice for Peace, and we call upon the Universityto heed their demands. This includes meeting with the coalition of student groups in good faith, divesting from companies profiting from illegal occupation, conducting an inquiry into hate speech, denouncing the police violence inflicted on the student body on November 17, and reaffirming your commitment to justice and peace for all students, including Palestinians and their allies, in words and in action.\n\nThe University of Michigan must respond with moral clarity in the face of genocide. Naming injustice is essential to claiming justice. We pledge to withhold donations and sever our ties to the University of Michigan until these demands are met.\n\nSigned,\n\nAlumni of Umich For Palestine\n\n**number subject to change as the death toll increases"
