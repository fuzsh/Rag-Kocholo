E-mail from W. Lawrence Gulick, 2/24/2005, confirms lifting of restriction: The materials which I delivered to Ralph Stenstrom (the Librarian) and Frank Lorenz (then Archivist) in 1989 consist of documents and correspondence relevant to the merger of Kirkland and Hamilton. I judged it best if the materials remained private until a twenty-five year period had elapsed, beginning with the formal merger in 1979. Accordingly, the restriction may now be lifted, a date I made plain in my transmittal letter to Mr. Stenstrom. Four years ago Mr. Lorenz and I agreed that it would be useful for me to make an effort to organize the materials, and so I spent three days on the Hill, adding dated explanatory notes when it seemed useful so to do. You should know that some former Kirkland faculty who continue to serve Hamilton are quite likely to be disturbed by some of the contents. Indeed, the restriction was intended to make minimum the bitterness that accompanied the merger. Use judgment. Best wishes, W. Lawrence Gulick\n\nJohn T.

While an undergraduate, Wright served in the United States Naval Reserve and was assigned to the U.S.S. Argonaut, a submarine. After earning his M.A., Wright was drafted into the United States Army to serve during the Korean War. He served as an operations sergeant in an infantry battalion for two years and was released from duty in 1954. After working for four years as an Instructor of Speech for Purdue University, Wright entered the doctoral program at the University of Illinois and earned his Ph.D. in 1960. Wright joined the Hamilton College faculty in 1960 as an Instructor of Speech, becoming the first member of the Speech Department with a Ph.D. He was subsequently promoted to Assistant Professor (1963), Associate Professor (1966), Professor (1975), and held the Upson Professorship Emeritus of Rhetoric and Oratory from 1977 until his retirement from teaching in 1992. Wright also served as department chair from 1972-1982. After the speech requirement was eliminated from the Hamilton College curriculum in 1969, Wright was influential in helping the Speech Department transition into the Department of Rhetoric and Communication.

Peters earned his Ph.D. from the University of Berlin in 1936. After working with Baron von Walterhausen on a geodetic survey of Mount Etna from 1838 until 1843, Peters fought as an artillery officer under Garibaldi in the revolt against the King of Naples. After the failure of the revolt, Peters fled to Malta. He returned to Sicily the following year, but the fall of Palermo caused him to travel to France, then Constantinople. Peters immigrated to the United States in 1852 and began working for the Dudley Observatory in Albany, NY, a position he held until 1858. In 1858, the Hamilton College Board of Trustees offered Peters the directorship of the Litchfield Observatory. With the support of Edwin C. Litchfield '32, Peters became the first member of the Hamilton College faculty with a Ph.D., was named the Litchfield Professor of Astronomy in 1867, and continued to serve the school until his death. During Peters' time at Hamilton, he discovered 47 asteroids from the Litchfield Observatory and, with help from the University of the State of New York, determined the longitude of the western boundary of New York State, as well as the longitude for several cities, including Buffalo, Syracuse, and Elmira. With Peters' death, the Litchfield Observatory fell into disrepair. Although it was mentioned in college catalogues until 1917, it was never effectively manned and was torn down in 1918.\n\nContents\n\nplates of astronomical data Textual records (letters, mss, etc.)\n\nExtent\n\n3 Shelves\n\nDescription\n\nCorrespondence and mss, astronomical research notes and plates 0000.123.4 (or 123.2.3): correspondence, Computations relative to Io, 4 packets of personal correspondence Summary: notes, printed journals, charts, diagrams, photographs and letters pertaining to CHF Peters' astronomy research at Litchfield Observatory.
