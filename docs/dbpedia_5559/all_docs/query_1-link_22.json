        "text": "Career\n\nHe is probably best known for co-writing the screenplay for Jaws, as well as directing the 1981 low-budget cult film Caveman. After studying drama at Syracuse University, he became a member, in the 1960s, of the San Francisco improvisational comedy troupe \"The Committee\". They made one feature film: A Session with the Committee.\n\nMinor acting roles have included Robert Altman\"s M*A*South*H and the film Clueless.\n\nGottlieb also cowrote David Crosby\"s two autobiographies, 1989\"s Long Time Gone and 2006\"s Since Then. Jaws\n\nGottlieb was hired as an actor to appear as Harry Meadows, the editor of the local newspaper, in Jaws.\n\nIronically, his redrafts reduced the role of Meadows (who still appears in the Town Hall corridor and the Tiger Shark scene). He wrote a book, The Jaws Log, about the notoriously difficult production of the film.\n\nBryan Singer has referred to it as being \"like a little movie director bible\".\n\nHe was enlisted under similar circumstances to work on the Jaws 2 screenplay. He co-wrote the screenplays for The Jerk and Jaws 3-Doctorate. Gottlieb contributes to Jaws related activities, such as interviews (including the documentary The Shark Is Still Working) and attended JawsFest on Martha\"s Vineyard in June 2005. He joined the Writers Guild of America in 1968 after becoming interested in Guild politics and with a desire to serve fellow writers following writers\" strikes in the 1970s and 1981.\n\nHe ran for the Board of Directors in 1983, and was re-elected for numerous terms thereafter, including two stints as vice-president (1991â€“1994).\n\nHe was again appointed VP of the Writers Guild of America, west in 2004 and served until the following year. In September 2011, he was elected as WGA-West Secretary-Treasurer."
