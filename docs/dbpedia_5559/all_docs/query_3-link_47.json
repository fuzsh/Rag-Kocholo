        "text": "NASPA has been approved by the Higher Education Consortium for Student Affairs Certification to provide CE credit for Certified Student Affairs Educators (CSAEd). Programs that qualify for CE credit in this program are clearly identified. NASPA is solely responsible for all aspects of this program.\n\nA maximum of 15 Core credits are available for this program for attending live sessions or viewing the recordings, with recordings remaining available for 60 days following the event. Per the Certificant Handbook, credit cannot be awarded for attending both a live session and its recording.\n\nTo receive credit, please complete the Certified Student Affairs Educators Educators Continuing Education Request Form, available at https://bit.ly/NASPACSAEd, by April 30, 2024 for live sessions or by June 30, 2024 for recorded sessions. Please note that credit for live attendance and watching recordings must be made via two separate requests (by submitting the form twice) and for the entirety of the hours being requested. For example, if you attend two live sessions and watch three recorded sessions after the live event, you must submit one request for two credit hours and another request for three credit hours. When completing the form, please note that there are separate options for this event - one for the live program, and one for the recordings.\n\nIn addition, you must complete an online evaluation of all sessions attended, which will be shared in the program app toward the end of the event. If you are requesting CEs for both live and recorded sessions, please submit one evaluation for the live sessions attended and a separate evaluation for any recorded sessions you engage in. A certificate of completion will be sent via email after the form has been processed and approved"
