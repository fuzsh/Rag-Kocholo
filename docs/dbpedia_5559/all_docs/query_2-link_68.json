        "text": "Columns compiled by your class correspondents\n\n1940s\n\n1948\n\nEven though many folks weren’t able to attend the Class of ’48 Reunion in June 2023, Martha Clark Mapes, MS ’49, reports that “a great time” was had by all who did. We were thrilled to catch up with her after the event. She shared that class members mainly gathered at the Statler, where the class has spent a great deal of time over the years. One major highlight of the weekend was being greeted by Cornell President Martha Pollack: “The moment when you are in a big group and are welcomed by the president of Cornell has always been special. We’ve had a wonderful relationship through the years with the president. So, in a way, we’re spoiled.”\n\nThe Class of ’48 is now supporting Cornell’s AguaClara project, an engineering initiative focused on designing equipment and technology that can improve drinking water quality in the Southern Hemisphere. “It’s a new way for a class like ours to help undergraduates. That’s a new relationship for us that I’m enthusiastic about, and I think other people are too. We’re still interested in hearing about what’s the leading edge now as far as research.” Martha says her late husband, Barth ’49, was active in the Cornell animal science community, and she knows the industry is undergoing “a huge metamorphosis” due to changes in the livestock industry. Martha and other class members are very interested in climate change: “I think we’re all crossing our fingers about the future,” she admits, “and we worry. Because here it is, 2023, and they keep talking about how by 2050 we’re supposed to have it all worked out. And it looks to me like we have a lot to do.”\n\nThe moment when you are in a big group and are welcomed by the president of Cornell has always been special.\n\nMartha Clark Mapes ’48, MS ’49\n\nMartha was thrilled to report that her former classmate, Sylvia Kilbourne Hosie, MNS ’49, was in attendance at Reunion with her daughter. “The fact that we’re both 97 and still hanging in there and still coming to campus—that’s unusual,” says Martha, who was also accompanied by her daughter at Reunion. A resident of the Kendal retirement community in Ithaca, Martha says two of our classmates also live there. “We’re all very active,” she notes. “We keep wanting to reach out and be part of Cornell life.”\n\nMartha reflected on past Class of ’48 Reunions and the role World War II played in her classmates’ enthusiasm to reconnect after college: “We were a war class. We came to Cornell in 1944; at that time, we had a different point of view,” she recalls. “Our campus was full of Navy personnel. Life was utterly different. That’s why we got so excited when the war was over. Everybody came back and pitched in, and we had huge Reunions. We always had huge participation. We had a lot of people, so we had a great time. If I went through the list, many people would still remember our officers. People in Ithaca would remember people who were active.”\n\nReunion was a breath of fresh air for those who attended, especially our Class of ’48 members who bring a broad range of interests and perspectives: “We were a class that seemed to be into everything. It’s fun to be into everything, and I think our class kind of portrayed how to do that.” ❖ Ray Tuttle (email Ray) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1949\n\nGreetings, Class of ’49. Please take a moment to let us know how you’re planning to spend the holidays—or even better, email me a copy of your holiday letter! ❖ Class of 1949 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1950s\n\n1950\n\nIn our September/October column I reported a bit about classmate Ken Dehm, age 104, and asked readers to report any known living classmate older than Ken. I did not hear from any contenders for the title, but I was delighted to hear from almost-96-year-old Allan Mitchell from Seneca Falls, NY.\n\nOn the Hill, he was a member of Sigma Phi Epsilon, played JV basketball and varsity soccer, and was a wearer of the C. After graduation he joined his father, Class of 1912, on the family fruit farm. After a year he was recalled from WWII service to serve in the Korean conflict. Allan has five children, Robert, Barbara, Patricia, and Cornell grads George ’73 and James ’76.\n\nRetired after 55 years of farming, Allan and his wife have visited Australia and Alaska with several cruises in between. He continues his 72 years in the Masons, 47 years in the Lions Club, and 80 years of service in his church. Allan reported that he is in good health, without aches and pains, and is shooting to be a centenarian.\n\nAnd now for a story about a unique geographic and historic event: For grades 1–4, with 12 other pupils, I attended a rural one-room school. We had only a few books, mostly on history and geography, all of which I avidly read cover to cover. At age 12, I had a liberating experience, which involved a Christmas gift of a red and white Schwinn bicycle. I could then pedal two miles to the village library, where I read every new issue of National Geographic and took home books on history and geography.\n\nAfter graduation Allan Mitchell ’50 joined his father, Class of 1912, on the family fruit farm.\n\nThese engendered in me a strong drive to travel the world, which subsequently and fortuitously I was able to do. In these travels in 33 countries on five continents I crossed the Equator eight times, the Prime Meridian 10 times, and the International Date Line eight times. Which brings up the following—a fascinating story that should interest those of you that have had world travel experiences. The story involves the geographic intersection of the Equator and the International Date Line located out in the center of the huge Pacific Ocean.\n\nJust before midnight on December 31, 1899, the small passenger steamer, the SS Warrimoo, was quietly skimming through the waters of the mid-Pacific on its way from Vancouver, BC, Canada, to Sydney, Australia. From star sightings the navigator had just worked out the ship’s position, which was a mere half degree east of the International Date Line and a half degree north of the Equator.\n\nIntrigued by the ship’s unusual position he reported it to the first mate, and they decided to tell the captain, who had not yet retired for the night. Captain Phillips was prankish enough to take advantage of an opportunity to achieve the navigational freak of a lifetime. The three went to the bridge to adjust the ship’s direction and speed so as to stop the ship as it met the intersection of the equator and International Date Line. That extremely unusual event resulted in these most unusual and historic consequences: the bow of the ship was in the Southern Hemisphere and in the middle of summer; the stern of the ship was in the Northern Hemisphere and in the middle of winter; the date for the aft part of the ship was December 31, 1899; and the date for the fore part of the ship was January 1, 1900. All at the same time the ship was in two different days, two different seasons, two different months, two different years, and two different centuries! One wonders if that unique event was ever repeated for a ship on December 31, 2000. ❖ Paul Joslin (email Paul) | 13731 Hickman Rd., #4207, Urbandale, IA 50323 | tel., (515) 278-0960 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1951\n\n“I am still involved in the California Condor Archives at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History,” writes Jan Armstrong Hamber. “I admit the COVID closedown of the museum, local stores, and restaurants did affect my work, as I’ve had to work from home these past three years.”\n\n“My main jobs have involved editing several books that have come in online about the condor. One of the books is titled Jan and the Condors; this was a surprise from a woman who lives in a small town in the middle of British Columbia, Canada. I’ve been working with her for the past year on her book, which is meant to encourage young girls to enter natural history fieldwork.\n\n“She just finished the book, which consists of a large ink drawing of me at work in the field with several sentences of explanation along the top of each of the 27 pages. Now she is looking for a publisher. If she finds one and the book is printed, I’ll be sure to send it to the Cornell Library. Happy trails to everyone.” ❖ Class of 1951 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1952\n\nSuzanne Joyce Seeley writes of her enjoyment in painting. Janet Nein Knight’s daughter, Catherine, writes, “My mother died on October 14, 2020, in our home in Helena, MT. She was 91 years old. Mom loved her work with mothers and babies.” Condolences for your loss.\n\nCarol Singer Greenhaus, writing from Rye, NY, finds great satisfaction “knowing that my family hasn’t a lemon in the bunch, as my father, Alexander Singer 1922, said of his!” She also enjoys being alive and able to enjoy Zumba and yoga and a “zillion little things—and I always end up reading. My three daughters gave me six grandchildren and the six grands gave me (so far) nine great-grands.” A favorite memory of Cornell is the McGraw Tower concerts—“unique, relaxing, beautiful.”\n\nBarron Biederman writes from Palm Beach, FL, “I am reading history as it continues to evolve. After all these years, I still remember with great fondness the classes, seminars, and tutorials I enjoyed with splendid historians—Professors Carl Stephenson, Frederick Marcham, PhD 1926, and Fritz Stern. I copped the undergraduate history prize and considered making history a career. I didn’t—instead, I went on to a successful career in advertising—but the disciplines they taught were applicable and useful and have enriched my life immeasurably.”\n\nAfter all these years, I still remember with great fondness the classes, seminars, and tutorials I enjoyed with splendid historians.\n\nBarron Biederman ’52\n\nIna Perlstein Loewenberg, writing from Hamden, CT, says: “After 53 years in Iowa City, IA, I moved to a senior residence in Connecticut, nearer to family, and am enjoying the stimulation of activities and companionship. And I am closer to where I ‘originated’ in New York!” Patricia Dexter Clark reports, “I use a walker and a vehicle to get around in this senior living establishment in Concord, MA, Newbury Court. I am lucky to have a daughter and son nearby. I had a great time at Cornell for four years in every way.”\n\nEvelyn Hoffmann Huffman writes from Kansas City, MO: “Aside from my greatest satisfaction, leaving the dentist’s office, I like a good mystery novel, or even a comic novel.” Her favorite Cornell memories were the “wonderful parties—sometimes elegant, sometimes wild, sometimes themed. My favorite: the ‘suppressed desires’ party. And they had parties for all 24 hours on occasion.” Judith Winter Burger, living in New York City, enjoys the cultural activities, museums, symphony, and ballet, and new and old friends.\n\nSusan Olswang Strumer writes from Ridgefield, CT. She had built two Green Man Gardens in the summer last year and is now focusing on creating a hat-designing charitable trust to raise funds for charity. Her husband, Josef, was a Cornell engineering graduate and she states that he was Martin Ginsburg ’53’s roommate at Pi Lambda Phi, where as steward he planned many fun events. ❖ Thomas Cashel, LLB ’56 (email Tom) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1953\n\nMort Bunis, JD ’55, and his wife, Anita (Brown), GR ’53–54, recently moved from North Caldwell, NJ, to the independent living facility of a continuing care retirement community known as MorseLife, located in West Palm Beach. “The move puts us closer to our daughter Vicki Bunis Rosenthal ’81, who resides in nearby Palm Beach Gardens,” he says. “It’s a new adventure for us!”\n\nMort reports that the 70th Reunion was fun—but bittersweet. “Only 10 classmates returned and, contrary to most demographics, none of them were women. The only female at our dinner table was Anita. I also enjoyed a special delight. Although all three of my children were Cornellians, none of their class Reunion cycles (’79, ’81, and ’84) ever coincided with the ’53 Reunion years. This year, my son, Lawrence ’79 volunteered to do all the driving to Ithaca, and it was wonderful to have him with us. I spent two nights with him at the extravaganza of the Arts Quad tents, meeting Cornellians of all different stripes and persuasions. Some preferred the heavy metal rock tent, others the jazz milieu—and many preferred the excitement of conversation and song at the most popular tent of all: the one where the beer was being dispensed! They seemed impressed to see the number on my Reunion button and to see that I could still drink beer and carry on a conversation, almost simultaneously. Cornelliana Night at Bailey Hall was still the event that plucked at the heartstrings, with the singing of the ‘Evening Song,’ its music and its lyrics bringing back other wonderful memories of friendships and events that have sometimes faded from our thoughts. Perhaps the most telling part of all of the class arrangements was that, finally, after so many Reunions and Homecomings, I was able to get a room at the Statler with a campus view.”\n\nRuth Burns Cowan, senior research fellow for the Ralph Bunche Institute for International Studies in NYC, reports that the COVID pandemic caused the cancellation of most showings of her documentary film, Tribal Justice. However, it is easily available from Amazon. “Our concept of justice is punishment, but the native American concept of justice is rehabilitation,” she explains. “Because those in our justice system acknowledge that the system is seriously flawed—and even broken—chief justices across the country have shown the film with their colleagues to consider how they might modify our system using what they learn from the film.”\n\nFinally, after so many Reunions and Homecomings, I was able to get a room at the Statler with a campus view.\n\nMort Bunis ’53, JD ’55\n\nIrene Selmer Griffith, BA ’52, shares one of her favorite memories: “Enjoying the beautiful music and the scenery at the concerts on Libe Slope.” These days, she shares the songs with grands and great-grands since Owen ’50, PhD ’58, her husband of 70 years, passed away three years ago. “I try to keep up with the news and science and understand new hopes for local peace in a clean, well-fed world.”\n\nRegina “Genie” Mandelbaum Deutsch has moved to a long-term care facility in the Milwaukee area. She and her husband, Stanley, an industrial engineer who died five years ago, lived in five states: Iowa, Illinois, New York, Wisconsin, and Connecticut. Genie received a BS degree from Cornell and a master’s degree in public administration from Syracuse and worked for several area agencies on aging plus the Illinois legislature’s Republican Appropriations Committee as a registered Democrat. Her growing family includes five children, 18 grandchildren, and many great-grandchildren.\n\nFor Douglas McIlroy, a graduate of the five-year engineering physics program, the 70th Reunion was the third he has attended, and he noticed some changes. “It was nice to stay in the Statler and dine privately with classmates, most of whom had interesting life stories. People made sure that I, as the oldest of old-timers at the engineering physics breakfast and the Computing and Information Science (CIS) reception, met the department heads, deans, and president. At CIS I also got to see faculty whom I’ve known since the 1970s. The Quad is somewhat more naturalistic than in our day, with lots of shade at the north end and taller, less pampered varieties of grass. The science cluster (physics, chemistry, materials) squeezes more than twice as much building into the same area that it occupied back when. Atriums (I visited three) have become a cliche of college architecture. I found the renovated Franklin Hall (now Tjaden Hall), where my father had an office, to be claustrophobic, perhaps because I’ve become used to modern-scale elbow room, which atriums have taken to a new max.”\n\nRoberta “Bobbie” Pesner Becker sends a warm “hi!” to Dottie Clark Free. She recalls some long-ago fun: “Dottie taught me how to play bridge, college-style. She’s a lovely person!” ❖ Caroline Mulford Owens (email Caroline) | Jack Brophy (email Jack) | Bob Neff, JD ’56 (email Bob) | John Nixon (email John) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1954\n\nOur 70th Reunion is approaching quickly. We hope very much that many of us will be on hand. At Reunion 2023, the Class of 1953, celebrating their 70th, had 10 classmates with a total (including guests and caregivers) of 20; the Class of 1948 managed to have four classmates with a total of nine guests attending. Sadly, many of us are unable to get to Ithaca, even with the superb care and support Cornell offers us in the Statler and around the campus. This year I realized I could watch the livestream of Cornelliana Night at Bailey. Not quite as good as being there, but wonderful nonetheless. I recommend it to all who will be at home.\n\nPerhaps you wonder how to find Cornell contacts from long ago. We no longer display email addresses in Class Notes because of complaints of spam. However, there is a good way to locate them. Just click here on the Alumni Directory to connect with classmates and friends. To access the directory, you will need a Cornell NetID. If you don’t know your NetID, visit the IT Service Desk web page for help or call (607) 255-5500.\n\nThanks to all of you who responded to class president Chick Trayford, MBA ’60’s letter to classmates in the spring. Bill Pinchbeck wrote from Vermont. He enjoys cycling and playing clarinet, sax, and oboe with groups. He continues his college love of swimming, now at his summer cottage in Connecticut, and fondly recalls “swimming at Ithaca’s many swimming holes” and also hiking up Libe Slope to classes. His advice to undergrads: “Enjoy your time and study.”\n\nThese next three folks are some of our faithful correspondents. David Bernanke walks two miles daily along the Potomac River and visits with other walkers. He likes to read “about our times, i.e., the history of the 20th century, and then discuss it at meetings with others of like interests.” Favorite Cornell memories are the beauty of the Quad and his great teachers. His advice to students: “Be open to all new ideas, including those you don’t agree with or understand.” And his positive outlook: “The longer I live, the better I like it and the more I find there is to learn.”\n\nTo my surprise, while cruising on the Great Lakes recently, a fellow passenger turned out to be from the Class of 1952 and a sorority sister.\n\nRuth Carpenter Bailey ’54\n\nBill Webber, MD ’60, lives in Tucson so he can enjoy the outdoors more of the year than many of us. He also rides his bike three days a week, maintains their solar house, enjoys desert gardening, and indulges in “eclectic reading.” He sent a sketch of himself relearning the trumpet via an online course. He’s also relearning French. That warm climate must be conducive to lots of energy. In retirement Bill has traveled to Hawaii, the Canadian Rockies, the Grand Canyon, Seattle, and New York. He sings bass in the Desert Voices community chorus and helps with Mobile Meals of Southern Arizona. Maybe his second marriage to his high school sweetheart contributes to this happy and busy lifestyle! His favorite memory of Cornell: being art editor of the Cornell Widow (humor magazine) in 1953. Bill’s advice to students: “Stay focused and work your butt off. It’ll be worth it.” Ever the medical doctor, Bill closes with this: “I’m mastering the language of medications—Metamucil, glucosamine, benazepril, fluticasone, dorzolamide, famotidine, esomeprazole, sotrovimab, doxazosin, ibuprofen, and don’t forget Tylenol.”\n\nSondra Dreier Kozinn’s count of great-grandchildren has reached 33. We can imagine her full-time job is knowing names and birthdays.\n\nMy mother often said Cornell is a lifelong experience. I was reminded of that recently while cruising on the Great Lakes. To my surprise, a fellow passenger turned out to be from the Class of 1952 and a sorority sister. Judy Calhoun Schurman ’52 and I knew some of the same people and enjoyed reminiscing about life on the Hill. She told wonderful stories about her grandfather-in-law, Jacob Gould Schurman, who was president of Cornell from 1892 to 1920. He certainly had great vision and helped Cornell develop in significant ways. I encourage you to look up his many contributions to the institution Cornell became. Like many of us, after “retirement,” he continued “to do the greatest good!” We never know where we’ll find fellow Cornellians! ❖ Ruth Carpenter Bailey (email Ruth) |Bill Waters, MBA ’55 (email Bill) | Class website | Alumni Directory.\n\n1955\n\nPeter Romeo retired as a senior partner from a prominent local architecture and engineering firm at age 62 and again as a sole practitioner at ages 70 and 80. Now, his favorite hobbies are reading and coin collecting. Peter has fond memories of the camaraderie at Sigma Pi and the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. “Hopefully, as I do every year in a summer month, I will take a trip to Ithaca to visit the Pi house and White Hall and recall a bit of history.” Over the summer, his children planned a birthday bash for him (as he turned “the magic age of 90,” he calls it) at a local town park lodge. Attendees included six sons, one daughter, three spouses, and 14 grandchildren. We hope you’ll write again soon and let us know how it went!\n\nRima Kleiman Sharron enjoys “waking up, coffee, duplicate bridge, caring for plants (mostly succulents), cooking, crossword puzzles, caring for two wonderful cats (and trying to figure out cat behavior), and enjoying visits from children, grandchildren, and my great-grandson.” When asked about her favorite memory of Cornell, Rima responded, “It’s hard to choose only one! I remember when Ralph Vaughan Williams spent time at Cornell in 1954. Some members of the a cappella chorus sat at his feet, a small group of women, and we sang some of his compositions, including ‘John Dory.’ It was awesome—a very special Cornell gift.”\n\nWe heard from a relative of Lee Gackenbach, who reports that Lee has had dementia for the past three years but is otherwise healthy and well. Dick Shriver writes, “I started a print and online magazine all about the Connecticut River watershed when I was 85. Today it’s beginning to look like it wasn’t a profoundly stupid idea.” You can view his publication here.\n\nI started a print and online magazine all about the Connecticut River watershed when I was 85.\n\nDick Shriver ’55\n\nHans “Wolfi” Duerr is happily “healthy and alive,” doing daily exercise class, playing bridge, reading, and spending time with great-grandkids. He fondly recalls classes with Clint Rossiter ’39 and house parties with his fraternity brothers. Bill Lockwood, BME ’57, writes, “It is sad when you reach our age that so many of your boyhood and college friends have passed away. I miss them.” These days, Bill enjoys traveling, boating, golf, and being with his family of five kids, 15 grandkids, and four great-grandkids. On the Hill, Bill loved fraternity life and being on the ski team. “Not to say it was all play and no work,” he notes. “I did get satisfaction studying to be an engineer.”\n\nTom Rooney has been reading and playing tennis and bridge. He fondly recalls playing football on the Hill and the camaraderie from that—plus meeting his wife, Myrna (Lacy) ’57. Golf continues to be a favored pastime for Winthrop Cody, who remembers winning a major crew race at Cornell.\n\nCharlotte Bialo Picot gets great satisfaction these days from swimming, playing bridge, and getting together with family and friends. “I serve on the board of directors of my seven-building co-op as VP and chair of admissions. I am also a member of a women’s club and a tennis club.” Charlotte has four grandchildren, all college graduates, all gainfully employed and living in their own apartments. She fondly recalls singing in Cornell’s a cappella chorus and singing in a production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s “Patience.” ❖ Class of 1955 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1956\n\nAs you have likely heard, our class lost a giant in October. Chuck Feeney, founding chairman of The Atlantic Philanthropies and Cornell’s most generous donor, died in San Francisco at 92. Chuck, who quietly devoted his fortune to worldwide causes for decades, invested nearly $1 billion in Cornell through the foundation since 1982. The late President Frank H.T. Rhodes referred to him as the University’s “third founder”—behind only Ezra Cornell and Cornell’s first president, Andrew Dickson White, in the magnitude of his influence and impact.\n\nJim Quest sent this eulogy: “My classmate, Chuck Feeney, Irish as you could ever be, was a defined mensch. According to Leo Rosten, a mensch is ‘someone to admire and emulate, someone of noble character.’ The key to being ‘a real mensch’ is nothing less than character, rectitude, dignity, and a sense of what is right, responsible, and decorous.’ The term is used as a high compliment, implying the rarity and value of that individual’s qualities.\n\n“I was one of the frat boys to get sandwiches from ‘the sandwich man,’ as he was known, in the wee hours of the morning from his delivery car. I was a fellow Hotelie and ’56 classmate. His bio can be found in many places and is well cataloged. This is not my purpose. My purpose is to mourn him. Because there never have been enough Chuck Feeneys in the world, nor will there ever be.\n\n“One landmark I do want to make note of: Chuck was the driving force, in 1981, for our 25th Reunion, where the Class of ’56 was first to fully integrate Reunion with fundraising. It was a strategy we picked up from noting the success of Harvard and Princeton and their history of tapping into the 25th Reunion emotion to produce greater alumni giving—heretofore not ‘compatible’ with the University. We raised the average 25th Reunion giving from $250,000 to over $2 million. Chuck pushed us and made it happen (in those days he was still an ‘anonymous’ donor). And we set a standard that all other classes have striven to better since then, many successfully.\n\n“If the Class of ’56 needs to help pay for Chuck’s burial, we will all know why. He proclaimed often and loudly that, after giving away his billions of dollars, and taking care of his family, his last check should bounce. We won’t let it.”\n\nJohn Long shares that it was refreshing to read the entry from Ann Phillips Drechsel ’57 in the January/February Class Notes. “Although she was a year behind me, we both attended Albion High School at the same time until her parents relocated to the Bath, NY, area. After I married an Ithaca native, an employee in the agricultural economics department at Cornell who I met while a student in graduate school in that department, we began life together in our home on the farm here in Albion, NY, where we have remained for the past 61 years. Life couldn’t have been better for us, as I farmed while we raised our two sons in that setting—with my wife tending to the household needs and taking care of many of the business details of operating the farm. Now we enjoy going to lunch together and attending senior citizen events. During my spare time, I prepare tidbits of agricultural history in our area for a local author who has managed to get a copy of one of her books onto a shelf in Mann Library.”\n\nI prepare tidbits of agricultural history in our area for a local author who has managed to get a copy of one of her books onto a shelf in Mann Library.\n\nJohn Long ’56\n\nGrace Goldsmith Wahba shares that her fifth great-grandchild arrived in April 2023. She writes, “I received an honorary doctor of science degree from the Ohio State University in May 2022.” Herschel Loomis shares the sad news that his wife, our classmate Shirley (Dean), died on January 2 of this year. We wish you well, Herschel.\n\nRussell Wagner is still being “somewhat active” in his community and staying busy maintaining a house in Mississippi and a cottage in Canada. Russell has one daughter in the Rochester, NY, area and another in Virginia. He fondly recalls meeting and hanging out with Pat (Adams) ’57 on the Hill and having 62 years with her.\n\nNancy Kohler Dean has been battling non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma for the past three-plus years. She shares that her greatest satisfaction comes from her family, including three children and their spouses, eight grandchildren, and three great-grandsons. Her favorite memory of Cornell? “The responsibilities I had as vice president of the women’s student government association and getting to know people.”\n\nNancy Marx Thorpe shares that it’s of great importance to her to have satisfying relationships with family and friends. During the summer, she plays golf two times per week with friends; during the winter she cross-country skis. Nancy has been traveling lately, both to see old Cornell friends and with family to Mexico.\n\nGinny Seelig Lenz has been volunteering as a tour docent at Poplar Forest, Thomas Jefferson’s second home. She’s also coordinating the book club at her local library. Ginny enjoys watching the active lives of her two daughters, five grandkids, and five great-grandkids.\n\n“I am able to continue to practice medicine and care for my patients,” writes Allen Unger. He remembers taking a literature course with Vladimir Nabokov. “Those lessons lasted a lifetime—and were much more interesting than organic chemistry.”\n\nMuriel Taylor Pense has been living in a retirement community at Kirkland Village and has enjoyed spending some time there with two other Cornellians, Cidney Brandon Spillman and Betty Card Lynham ’63. Muriel writes, “My favorite memory of Cornell is Alan’s proposal of marriage during the spring semester of our senior year, because it led to 64 years of a beautiful, happy marriage.” ❖ Class of 1956 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1957\n\nDownsizing, downsizing, downsizing! Many of us have made significant moves or are contemplating that. Word from Martha Ballard Lacy details not one, but two moves. After her husband, our classmate Dick, died on December 30, 2020, she tried to manage their home in Jamesville, NY. A little over a year and a half later, she woke up one morning with the decision to move and to sell. She put her name into several senior communities. In September 2022, she moved to the Manor in Skaneateles. But, when a call came in April 2023 from a place in Manlius, she packed up and quickly moved again.\n\nNow Martha reports she feels like she has “come home.” She quickly settled in the Limestone Gardens Apartments, meeting new friends there and at local churches. She is involved in Bible study, book study, and worship. She is also enjoying keeping fit at the Manlius Senior Center and walking two miles every day, plus looking forward to cross-country skiing when winter brings those famous inches of snow to Central New York. Her special memories of Cornell include walking on campus, Cornell United Religious Work, and Willard Straight committee meetings. She treasures the lifelong friendships she maintains with her Delta Gamma sorority sisters.\n\nMark Levy left the Albany Capital Region 16 years ago, when he retired from his ophthalmology practice. He and wife Nancy moved first to Rye Brook for six years, then to Florida for 10 years. A couple of years ago, they decided to return to Westchester County to be nearer to family. They now live at the Club at Briarcliff Manor and have found two other Cornellians living there. Mark finds this a delightful place to live and enjoys many of the activities offered.\n\nOne of Mark’s activities at Cornell was being a member of Octagon, a theater club. The acting bug never left him. When he was still living in the Albany area, he performed in the Schenectady Light Opera Company. Once he moved closer to New York City, he took acting classes and voice lessons. He became a baritone in the University Glee Club of NYC, which performs around the world. Even now, he performs Gilbert & Sullivan solos for the on-site Glee Club. His sense of humor is intact—he says he is satisfied that he still has “all my marbles.” He easily demonstrates this by not only being the trivia champion but successfully defending his title.\n\nMartha Ballard Lacy ’57 is looking forward to cross-country skiing when winter brings those famous inches of snow to Central New York.\n\nPaul Tregurtha may now live in Florida, but his heart seems pulled, over and over again, to Cornell. He and wife Lee (Anderson) ’59 proudly share 65 years of marriage. Carrying on the Cornell tradition, their four children and 11 of their 14 grandchildren are Cornell grads. Paul is enjoying watching his grandchildren enter the real world and learning from them in their many good discussions. Paul added a Harvard MBA to his Cornell BME, later using both to benefit companies involved with marine transportation. He has been the co-owner of several companies including Moran Transportation Company, which operates 95 tugboats all around the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nIf you Google Paul’s name, you come up with M/V Paul R. Tregurtha, the flagship of the Interlake Steamship Company. It is the longest vessel operating on the Great Lakes. When Paul became the co-owner and vice chairman of the company in 1991, the ship was rechristened in his honor. It had been launched in 1981 and is considered the “Queen of the Lakes.” In fact, the ship was the subject of a television program on the Discovery Channel Canada’s series “Mighty Ships.”\n\nIn his retirement, Paul remains as chairman of one of his companies with no day-to-day responsibilities, as his and his co-owner’s next generation have taken over. He adds that he is now “giving advice and not caring if anyone listens.” Sounds appropriate for the stage of life where he and Lee are. As a historical note, Paul served on Cornell’s Board of Trustees in the ’80s and ’90s and rose to become vice chairman of the board.\n\nWe remember Rachel Leah Lawrence using her middle name, Leah, on campus. Right after our graduation, she and Eleanor Blau headed for San Francisco to search for jobs in journalism. Leah had always been interested in politics, even as she majored in Asian studies. She found a job in the library of the San Francisco Chronicle. A marriage, three children, and a divorce later, Leah began working for the Associated Press. She found this career enjoyable, as much of what she wrote was used in radio broadcasts. One transfer sent her to Iowa, where she experienced the caucuses firsthand. Another transfer brought her back to the East Coast to Trenton, NJ.\n\nNow living in Teaneck, NJ, Leah too faces the downsizing dilemma; by the time this column is online, she will be trying out an assisted living facility. Her main focus is on handling her collection of many treasured books. Her daughters have encouraged the move, as Leah no longer drives. Healthwise, she is a rare pancreatic cancer survivor. With fatigue as her only symptom, her physician discovered the cancer. With surgery and chemo, she has been cancer free for the last two years. She continues her optimistic outlook. ❖ Connie Santagato Hosterman (email Connie) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1958\n\nAs you know from our last column, Barbara Avery, MA ’59, is our new class co-correspondent, replacing Janet Arps Jarvie after Jan’s many years on the job, with our thanks. Barbara is also the class secretary, elected at our Reunion class meeting and as reported in Barbara’s minutes, now on file for any to view in the September/October Class Notes.\n\nWe are sorry to report the loss of another prominent classmate: Jerry Mandell, MD ’62, good friend of Dick Kay and the husband of Judy (Rensin) ’61. Jerry, Phi Beta Kappa, was well known for his work on infectious diseases and received worldwide honors during his long career for his research, its results, and the teaching of many physicians following his path. He was a founding editor, along with Gordon Douglas and John Bennett, of the world’s leading infectious disease book, Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett’s Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases (now in its ninth edition). Jerry will be greatly missed by his many professional colleagues in that vital arena of research and also by his many Cornell friends. We send the class’s sympathies to Judy and all three Cornell children and family.\n\nLouesa Merrill Gillespie is building a new home as part of her downsizing in Maine while also keeping busy in her nonprofit local works. She made it to Reunion, riding over with Ray ’57 and Audrey Wildner Sears, who still reside in their Grantham, NH, home near Dartmouth. Louesa says she gets most satisfaction these days from “my small gathering of friends, the support of my family, and the kindness of my community.” Richard Stormont writes that he is recovering from emphysema and lung cancer, still living in the Atlanta, GA, area and investing in his Stormont Hospitality Group and Cornell’s Johnson School of Finance. His favorite memory of his time on the Hill, actually more on the Inlet, is with the Cornell crew team.\n\nMyron Stacks and his wife, Barbara, reside in Essex, CT, where Myron “remains a very active downhill skier, a long-distance bicycle rider, and totally engaged in the Essex Land Trust, cutting and maintaining trails in our woodland preserves.” Ken Pollard reports similar outdoor activities on his farm woodlot, improving that area with the help of New York City’s Department of Environmental Conservation in his hometown of Cayuga. Ken lost his wife of 67 years last March. Leslie Taylor visited northern Chile to see the big telescopes there and also the Chilean aerospace museum as part of his ongoing travels from home base in Bethesda, MD. He spent time in Australia, visiting friends, and at home he continues as docent for the National Air and Space Museum.\n\nJack Kelly ’58 has written about his wife, Ingrid, in a recently published book entitled A Great American Love Story.\n\nJack Kelly got to Reunion and said there that he was having a great time. He recalls his days as an undergrad, saying: “I loved it all and think fondly of the many friends and good times—a great education in so many ways.” Jack greatly misses his wife, Ingrid, whom he lost in 2020; he has written about her in a recently published book entitled A Great American Love Story. He keeps active in managing accounts with his two sons in his Kelly Group with JP Morgan in NYC.\n\nDon Frisch, MS ’63, also attended Reunion from his and Janet’s home in Newtown Square, PA, at White Horse Village, where classmate Dick Eales and spouse Nancy (Hoeft) ’60 also reside; happily, they too made it to Reunion and reported having had a great time. Avid birders, the Ealeses must have visited Sapsucker Woods during that time, along with joining the class on our visit through the ever-growing Botanic Gardens. Don continues investment advising for a couple of clients and, while thinking of his four years at Cornell, says he most remembers all four years of lacrosse, along with classmate Bob Hoffman, with whom he reminisced during Reunion.\n\nFrank “Roger” Wiley remembers his years competing on the fencing team (saber) and his good times at Phi Sigma Kappa. Roger writes from Westminster, CA: “I serve on my church facilities committee, help feed the hungry, and enjoy my neighbors, along with golf, walking, experimenting with cooking, and keeping in touch with my friends.”\n\nBarbara Avery covered the class forum extensively in her column last time, along with the numbers who attended Reunion—60 classmates and 110 total—and listed our leaders and officers for the next five years. We can now report that your class treasury footed a bill close to $48K to cover all Reunion charges, leaving $32K for future spending in good ways for Cornell and the class. From all comments that have come in, everyone had a great time, and we look forward to our 70th. Class president Meyer Gross writes that he is considering the feasibility of occasional Zoom meetings among the officers to discuss matters of interest and importance to the class, so some of us will keep in touch as time moves on. For now, cheers to all, with wishes for happy holidays and a great New Year.\n\nWe’ve just gotten the word that the hard copy of Cornell news, called Cornellians Digest, will not be issued after this first trial year. Some of us are sorry to learn that the written copy is too expensive to produce for the limited number of subscribers. So, henceforth, tune in to Class Notes online only. ❖ Dick Haggard (email Dick) | Barbara Avery, MA ’59 (email Barbara) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1959\n\n“When we were undergraduates, there were approximately 6,000 men and 2,000 women at Cornell. Now there are 8,000 men and 8,000 women,” notes our class Reunion chair, Jerry Schultz. Concurrent with these increases have been increases in the number of people attending Reunions. But no class has come close to ’59ers when Reunions come ’round. Our class held the 25th Reunion attendance record for 32 years before it was surpassed by the Class of ’91. We’re the only class to ever hold the 25th and 50th Reunion records concurrently. And we continue to hold the 50th and 60th Reunion records. “I’m looking forward to our adding the 65th Reunion record next June,” says Jerry. “We’re lining up some great class events, and of course the University will do its usual bang-up job in presenting talks, concerts, open houses, sports competitions, etc. You will all be receiving a refrigerator magnet with the dates of our Reunion—June 6–9—as a helpful reminder for you to be there.”\n\nLooking to make some end-of-year contributions? Don’t overlook the Class of 1959 Scholarship Fund, which can be found here.\n\nPeter Yarrow and Noel Paul Stookey continue to enchant audiences with “Puff, the Magic Dragon” and other hits as they carry on the traditions of the folk music group they formed with Mary Travers in 1961. Performances this past summer included evenings in Waterville, ME, and Old Saybrook, CT, the latter expanded to three shows due to ticket demands. Prior to an appearance in Arizona earlier in the year, Peter spoke with Phoenix New Times reporter Timothy Rawles about his career and the power of songs. Noted Rawles, “It was at Cornell that he discovered the healing powers of an organic chorus, where large amounts of people sing at the same time, and it was then that he knew folk music was a transformational force that belonged in the mainstream to bring about peace and happiness.” Peter’s recent solo performances have included appearances at the University of Michigan and the 45th annual Spirit of the Woods Folk Festival in Brethren, MI. Also going strong is Peter’s nonprofit organization, Operation Respect, founded in 1999 and dedicated to transforming schools, camps, and other youth-serving organizations into safer, more respectful, bully-free environments for children and youth. (For more on Peter, including his music and art, check out his website.)\n\nPeter Yarrow ’59 and Noel Paul Stookey continue to enchant audiences with ‘Puff, the Magic Dragon’ and other hits.\n\n“The COVID years”: that period when people hunkered in their homes, wore masks when going outdoors became unavoidable, compensated for the fear of public activities with couch-potato TV binges. “Looking back after three years, what have I lost and what have I gained?” asks Paula Millenthal Cantor. “My husband, daughter, son, son-in-law, and I have all had COVID twice, but we’re here to tell of it, and even more grateful for one another, if that’s possible. Two of our grandchildren have had beautiful weddings and have since become parents, making my husband, Bill, and me, to our joy and amazement, great-grandparents.\n\n“Being homebound during the pandemic afforded me more time to take pleasure in home and garden. There were connections with old friends and extended family, some for the first time in years. Ties with close friends seemed to become even stronger. My project of sorting out playbills and exhibit notes from the past made me realize how privileged I have been to see the greats of theater, dance, and music, and the works of world-famous artists. I can be content with that. Same goes for all the great trips we’ve taken and adventures we’ve gone on.\n\n“Though my leadership days are behind me, I continue to be actively involved in Jewish community. I paint, garden, cook, read, exercise, and have more projects waiting to be done than I will ever get around to. I guess what I’m saying is that, while I feel that the pandemic has aged me more quickly than I might have done otherwise, depriving me of social interaction and stimulation for too long, it made me come to terms with the changes that were on their way, regardless. I don’t expect my life to go back to ‘the way it was.’ I’m just grateful for the way it is, and I look forward to the way it will be.”\n\nWith best wishes to all for the coming year. Hope you are looking forward to attending our 65th! ❖ Jenny Tesar (email Jenny) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1960s\n\n1960\n\nThomas Manley (Norwich, NY) writes about what he enjoys most these days: “sharing life with my super wife, Donna, in our retirement farmhouse that was built in 1982 on hills facing south.” For work, he says, “I drive my X320 John Deere, do simple chores at age 87, and have been running a bluebird trail on our south slope.” The Manleys have three sons: Joseph, an engineer at Borg Warner; Patrick, an executive at DHS in D.C.; and Brian, who works in Syracuse.\n\nMuch sadder news came from Judith Eyles Male (Lunenburg, MA), who reported that her husband, John ’58, died in September 2022. “I now find most satisfaction from the love and support of my family through these months of adjustment after John’s death and our wonderful 62 years of marriage. I have also been celebrating with my seven grandchildren as they continue to graduate from college in recent years. Happily, my favorite memory from Cornell is meeting John during my sophomore year.” We also received sad news from Gail Krantz Glickman (Sarasota, FL), who wrote that “unfortunately, one month before our 60th wedding anniversary, my husband, Cy, passed away from congenital heart failure, which he had been struggling with for a long time. I now try to keep up my spirits with numerous activities, which include playing tennis three or four times a week and attending dance classes. Although I’m now retired, I also write articles to submit to local publications.” Looking back at her past, Gail says, “I was blessed to have the opportunity to study at Cornell. When I walked across the beautiful campus, I reflected on my good fortune to be there.”\n\nStill a resident in Jamaica Plain, MA, Johanna “Toddy” Dwyer has also been on the move. She reports: “I took a great trip to Panama and went on to Buenos Aires, where I boarded a ship, which I took all the way around South America to Fort Lauderdale. Prior to that came a wonderful three weeks with friends from Washington, DC, to Sicily. I topped it off with a trip to Singapore. I’m still working some at the NIH, but it gives me an excuse to go to D.C., where I have season tickets for Shakespeare and the National Symphony.” Also quite satisfied with life, Sue Wood Brewer and her husband, Donald ’59 (Chapel Hill, NC), enjoy seeing their two sons become involved and very caring parents, rather different from their younger selves. Sue reports that they have seven grandchildren, ranging in age from 26 to 2 years old. “None live nearby,” she says, “but we try to keep up with all of them at their varied stages of life. We have lived in a continuing care residential community for over 10 years and are glad we moved here; we live independently, but it’s good to know there are welcoming places here on the campus, should we need them.”\n\nI’m still working some at the NIH, but it gives me an excuse to go to D.C., where I have season tickets for Shakespeare and the National Symphony.\n\nJohanna “Toddy” Dwyer ’60\n\nJames Verna reports from New York City, “I have just retired from the practice of dentistry and am enjoying my free time. I play tennis and ski; I also spent two months in Italy with family there. What brings me the most satisfaction these days is time spent with my daughter, Christine ’86, and my grandchildren, all of whom are now in college. My favorite memory from Cornell? All the friendships that I made there.” Another classmate now enjoying retirement is Robert Clark, who spent many years as a tax attorney in Las Vegas, NV. Robert says he is grateful for “family joys—four children, 13 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.” His favorite memories from Cornell are “the wonderful lectures and being on the freshman crew team—a long way from my home state of Utah!”\n\nIn a note from Carol Treman des Cognets (Tucson, AZ), she says she is satisfied thus far by “being upright and more or less mobile. I love reading news of classmates, although we have lost so many, but a recent visit to Tucson from Leonard and Patty Johnson was great fun. The intervening years just melted away while they were here. I still return to Melbourne for four to five months every year; Bill Clendenin ’61, BChemE ’63, and I went there in 1975 and it made me realize that much of my life was there.” In Portsmouth, NH, Kay Oppenheimer notes that, despite aging, she gets great satisfaction from time with her family and her pet animals, including dogs and horses. “I’m also enjoying being a snowbird in Aiken, SC, and valuing friends old and new.” Her favorite Cornell memory involves Professor Andrew Hacker and his enduring sensibility about American politics. She also loved his seminars.\n\nCarl Volckmann reports from Park City, UT, that he and his wife, Linda, are generally in good health and happy to be with their seven grandchildren and attending their sporting events. They are also enjoying friends and family members in Park City and Stuart, FL, but have suffered sufficient vision loss that they can no longer drive—“depressing and inconvenient!” says Carl. His favorite memories from Cornell are: “making lifelong friends in Sigma Chi, in my lightweight crew, and in my engineering class. After growing up in New York City, I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I got to Cornell.” Ray Skaddan wrote from Warminster, PA, that he and his spouse, Lynda, spent the month of October 2022 almost entirely in Paris. Next they were in Mexico for five weeks in January and February, then made a trip to Florida, and then went to California in March. Whew! Ray even found time along the way to visit Boston and Brookline, MA. “We have very much enjoyed travel as long as we are able, and are loving all family gatherings, especially with our newest family member, a great-granddaughter.” ❖ Judy Bryant Wittenberg (email Judy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1961\n\nThree weeks after submitting this column, my wife, Susan, and I, Doug Fuss, will move to Atlanta and into an independent living community near our daughter. After 26 years in Savannah, this has proven to be a massive undertaking, more than anticipated.\n\nBut so much for personal musings. Most of you have followed some of the dynamics in our ’61 alumni class organization. We welcome Sue Rand Lewis and Doug Uhler as our new co-presidents. They have graciously agreed to serve through the current term expiring in 2026. I’m sure they can count on our support as we proceed with our activities. Sadly, their new responsibilities reflect the unfortunate attrition of some of our class officers. Carol Gittlin Franklin and David Kessler, both long-term class officers, and our previous co-presidents Dick Tatlow and Jim Moore, LLB ’64, all passed away somewhat unexpectedly in the last year.\n\nMarilyn Slutzky Zucker wrote a lengthy note updating the comings and goings of several classmates. “I was lucky enough to spend a great afternoon in January in Palm Desert, CA, with a few pals from our class. Anne Lasher Mihalisin, Marian Pearlman Nease, Marjorie Seybold, Ellie Harder Johnson, and me. It was like old home week, immediately recognizing one another, even the few of us we hadn’t seen in, what, 60 years. Eek! Went to the zoo, had a meal, took photos, and hung out, completely enjoying the experience and marveling at the affection we shared.”\n\nI was lucky enough to spend a great afternoon in January in Palm Desert, CA, with a few pals from our class.\n\nMarilyn Slutzky Zucker ’61\n\nMarilyn continued, “Me? I’m still reading, writing, and traveling. I’ve been staying in Venice, Italy, for a few weeks each spring and have been back also to Lisbon, where I taught several years ago. I first went to Portugal in 1998 on a teaching Fulbright to Aveiro, a city in the west of the country. Since then, I’ve been back many times, staying with friends in Lisbon, connecting with colleagues in the Virginia Woolf Society, and teaching a course at the University of Lisbon in personal narrative. At the time, writing about oneself was rather new to the Portuguese students, while in the U.S., even a cereal box asks, ‘Tell us your story!’ Turned out they had much to say about their own lives and that of their families and their culture. It was a most unusual and fulfilling project. Finally, my dear friend Micki Bertenthal Kuhs has moved to East Hampton, a mere hour and a half away—that is, without summer traffic. It’s a joy to have her sorta nearby.”\n\nCharles Hecht, LLB ’63, writes from Manhattan, “I’ve eliminated trial work and am focusing on corporate work and helping new enterprises. With my significant other, Leslie Toepfer, we’re doing things including travel, opera, philharmonic, seeing our children and grandchildren, bicycling, and reading.”\n\nMay Lee Ling writes from Laguna Woods, CA, that she is retired and enjoying time spent with family, friends, and classmates. A grandson was married last year and a granddaughter this spring. A new update from Jim Baden, MD ’65, still residing on Hilton Head Island, SC: Although retired from his practice, Jim works with Volunteers in Medicine as a physician. His special interest is singing in the Barbershop Harmony Society. And a favorite Cornell memory is the fantastic 1960 men’s Glee Club trip to Russia.\n\nPlease keep your news flowing to us. ❖ Doug Fuss (email Doug) | Susan Williams Stevens (email Susan) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1962\n\nMore news from John Curtis, BCE ’64, MS ’65: “After enjoying a short trip to Quebec City for our 60th anniversary, Janie and I traveled to India in December as representatives of our Rotary district in the Dallas Metro area to observe several gifts made to hospitals from our local clubs. First though, we experienced the Taj Mahal and the several forts and well-known structures in Delhi, Agra, and Jaipur. Our group then flew south to Cochin, where we visited three hospitals that had received dialysis machines, ambulances, blankets, and publishing equipment, all to better serve their communities. Our trip was completed with a ride into the mountainous area of Kerala State to visit the tea plantations and the herb gardens that have made the region world famous. More journeys are in the planning stage.”\n\n“As part of my volunteer activities in retirement,” writes Mike Miller, “I am chairing a charitable foundation endowment fund and continuing my 50-year tenure on the Allentown (PA) Economic Development Authority. Recently, I also found myself presenting talks (telling jokes) to three different groups on the history and nature of Jewish humor. Here’s a sample: The Yeshiva rowing team was competing against all the Ivy League teams with eight-men shells and a coxswain, but they were coming in last in every race. They decided to send out two spies, Joshua and Caleb, to spy on Harvard to see what they might be doing wrong. So the spies went to the Charles River, hid behind a bush, and watched the Harvard rowing team. The spies came back to Yeshiva and gave their report. The Harvard team had eight men rowing with the coxswain yelling out the cadence: ‘Stroke, stroke, stroke.’ We have the coxswain rowing and the eight men yelling out the cadence.”\n\nFrom Bob and Barbara Garson Stern comes the following: “Well, having never submitted any news before, there’s a lot to enter. We have three daughters and seven grandkids. We lived in Nassau County, NY, for about three months after graduating our joint fifth years (I in electrical engineering and Barbara in history/government). Moved to Suffolk County, Long Island, in 1963 and lived in Smithtown/Hauppauge for 11 years, with me changing jobs several times, gaining experience in electronic warfare (EW) and Barbara in teaching, then relocated to Potomac, MD, from 1974 until today. I jumped around even more times from EW to airline communications, and finally to satellite communications for the past 30 years or so, having worked for 18 companies over the years. Barbara taught private school, then went into headhunting for several years. She then got her accounting degree and became a financial wizard, ending up as CFO/VP of a small company doing work for the National Institutes of Health and drug companies for her last 20 years. Our daughters are married and gainfully employed, and all our grandkids are now out of high school and college. We both retired at the end of 2012 and have been happily enjoying life in suburban Maryland and at our Bethany Beach, DE, beach house since then. Latest plans are to relocate nearby to an Erickson Senior Living facility in North Bethesda, MD, in two years.”\n\nLongtime rower Victor Ericson ’62 has built a 16-foot lapstrake canoe and a teardrop camper, using kits from Chesapeake Light Craft!\n\nVictor Ericson has sent along lots of news.

She writes of her enjoyment of making things in the woodshop: “I made a small bookcase and smaller projects.” She has also joined “a group studying ‘green burials’ and related issues—the next inevitable adventure for us all!”\n\nPoet Jack Foley (who is “not retired from anything”) continues to do “what I’ve done throughout my life: write.” He presents his poetry on his Berkeley, CA, radio show on Tuesdays at 2 p.m., KPFA-FM. His recent books include The Light of Evening: A Brief Life of Jack Foley (Academica Press), A Backward Glance O’er Travel’d Roads (Academica Press), Bridget und andere Gedichte/Bridget and Other Poems (a selection of his work edited and translated by German poet Andreas Weiland), and Creative Death: an octogenarian’s wordshop (Igneus Press).\n\nThank you to all who sent personal news.

A wonderful 60th Reunion was had on campus this past June. Our class was assigned a new residence hall in the North Campus area, which was our headquarters and the center of class activities and many meals. About 100 classmates and guests attended the festivities including a BBQ gathering, breakfast buffets, wine and beer receptions, and plenty of snacks. This left time for the many University-sponsored and college-specific events that can fill our schedule. The pièce de résistance of the four-day weekend was our Saturday night dinner at the Statler along with introductions of key people, thank yous, gifts, entertainment, and the election of new officers. We would love to have you share your experience with classmates. Please send your comments to our class correspondent listed at the end of this column and keep the news coming all year.”\n\nI received more news from classmate Bob Carson after writing about him in the May/June Class Notes: “After 40 years of teaching at Whitman College, I retired in 2015, so am now Phillips Professor of Geology and Environmental Studies, Emeritus. I continue to teach part time at Walla Walla Community College. A few years ago, I finished climbing all major Cascade volcanoes. I still love the mountains of the eastern U.S., and in 2021 finished climbing the New England 4,000 Footers. In 2018 I finished my third book on the natural history of this area; its title is The Blues. Last year I completed my 550-page memoir, called simply Adventure. Of course, my wonderful years at Cornell are included.

She writes, “I am managing my two sabbatical houses and walking outside a mile each day with walking partners. I retired from my psychotherapy practice four years ago after 32 years in private practice. I enjoy hanging out with my four grandchildren. Son Jake was named one of Boston’s 20 top architects. Pacifica Radio celebrated the 20th anniversary of daughter Sasha’s public affairs program ‘Against the Grain.’ My 11-year-old granddaughter Sophie won second prize in the State of Massachusetts gymnastics meet in the 9- to 15-year-old category.

Robert writes, “I started competitive swimming again at age 78, 56 years after swimming in Teagle Hall! I cannot find any of my teammates still competing. If you are, please let me know.”\n\nBrock Willett lives in Highlands Ranch, CO. He fully retired in 2020 as a psychiatrist. He plays golf but stopped skiing this year. He has two grown children and three grandchildren.\n\nSusan Silverstein Sandler lives in New York City. “My son, Ted (PhD, University of Pennsylvania School of Engineering and Computer Science), completed 11 years with Amazon and is now with a startup. My grandson competes in Russian math. I volunteer as a registered dietitian nutritionist for a supermarket in a low-income area. Previously I was writing a ‘recipe of the week’ for an online publication that was e-blasted to customers and a distribution network of community organizations with a 10% discount on all vegetables in the recipe upon presentation of it to a cashier.”\n\nWarren Icke ’62 and I took a wonderful trip to Europe in May to celebrate our 60th anniversary, which happened in August. We spent three days in Looe, Cornwall, in England with friends. Then we spent three days in Prague, Czech Republic, before boarding our Viking cruise on the Danube. We visited Regensburg and Passau, Germany, as well as Vienna and Budapest. We then flew back to Boston to stay with family and then attended the Class of 1963 60th Reunion.\n\nKeep sending news via the website or email me. ❖ Nancy Bierds Icke (email Nancy) | 12350 E. Roger Rd., Tucson, AZ 85749 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1964\n\nHappy autumn! Fall is in the air, so while tending to fallen leaves and other hints of a changing season, be sure to make your plans for our 60th Reunion next June. Meantime, here’s more classmate news.\n\nWe begin with Douglas Berg, who writes, “My wife, Dange Kersulyte, and I retired at the end of 2012 after what was for me nearly 36 years as a faculty member in the Department of Molecular Microbiology, Washington University in St. Louis. We then moved to Encinitas, a wonderful California beach town north of San Diego. We now divide our time between Encinitas; the fantastic Anza-Borrego Desert, some two to three hours’ drive to the east (during cooler months); and, for one to two months in the summer, in and near Dange’s historic hometown of Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and site last July of an important NATO summit. Our daughter Alisa is two years into a three-year residency in veterinary internal medicine at the University of Florida. We are all in pretty good health and so life seems very good. We feel fortunate. I hope to return to Cornell next year to meet with many old and new friends at our 60th Reunion.”\n\nAnother recent retiree is Bill Lacy, who lives in Davis, CA, with wife Laura (Robinson) ’65. He writes, “I officially retired from UC Davis two years ago after 22 years (also five years at Cornell in the late 1990s) but will be attending four professional meetings this year and supporting a number of graduate students to attend. If you suffer from insomnia, I have a possible cure: I just published perhaps my last article, ‘Local food systems, citizen and public science, empowered communities, and democracy: hopes deserving to live.’”\n\nJoan Kather Henry, last here a year and a half ago, writes, “My husband, Bill ’60, BCE ’63, died last fall and I have decided to stay in our house in Castle Pines, CO, where we moved almost two years ago to be near our son. Our daughter has recently joined us in this area. I’m finding it a delight having kids living nearby and seeing grandchildren when they come to visit their parents. Also not far away is classmate Mary Deitrich Capra, and we have enjoyed getting together several times a year. After not traveling overseas for three years during COVID, I was finally able to spend three weeks in Spain in May visiting Spanish friends (who I met while teaching there years ago) and seeing some of my favorite places in Northern Spain. The trip has whetted my appetite for more traveling!”\n\nBill Ramsey, last here in March 2021, is now a fully retired orthopedic surgeon since March 2022. He remains active near his home with wife Barbara in Truckee, CA, with the Truckee Donner Railroad Society, designing and building large local railroad models. Bill otherwise enjoys golf and hiking mountain trails. Last year, he also recently enjoyed Hawaii, saw a Masters golf tourney, fished in Montana, and visited Scandinavia. Of this far-flung routine, he notes, “Time for a break!” He and Barbara also enjoy grandchildren, the San Francisco Bay Area, and Denver.\n\nI am learning to play the harpsichord, in the footsteps of beloved advisor Thomas Eisner, who bought one imported from Germany while we were at Cornell.\n\nSonia Kosow Guterman ’64, MS ’67\n\nJoan Nathanson Tosici, last here in January ’22, still lives in Ocean Township, NJ, and has been retired after 37 years teaching in NYC public schools. Joan is very active in Cornell-associated activities, noting, “I join in every year for Cornell Cares Day and try to attend every activity involving the Monmouth-Ocean Cornell Club.” She otherwise notes, “The Rolling Meadows community I live in offers lots of activities I participate in, including needlework, book club, bocce, a garden club, aquacise, canasta, and a monthly dining out group.”\n\nHelen Schwartz writes, “My World War II thriller, Thieves of Paris, was published two years ago. My latest event was as a Scholar in Residence at Temple Beth Shalom of the West Valley in Phoenix, AZ.” Quite some way from her home in Chevy Chase, MD, Helen “also completed a ‘bucket list’ trip to the Grand Canyon.”\n\nSonia Kosow Guterman, MS ’67 (Belmont, MA), last here 18 months ago, writes, “I am now a member of a science advisory board of a small Boston company, SPF, that makes chromatography equipment for high-value proteins, and I teach a regular weekly class—we call it a book club. In my spare time, I am learning to play the harpsichord, in the footsteps of beloved advisor Thomas Eisner, who bought one imported from Germany while we were at Cornell. He was a pioneer not only in insect-plant interaction, but in harpsichord culture. So I finally got myself a nice Flemish model built from a Zuckermann kit.”\n\nEd Gurowitz writes, “I am semi-retired, meaning I’m working mostly from home and fewer hours, but I’m still a management consultant specializing in talent development and mentoring younger consultants. It’s been a rough year: my wife, Emy, broke her femur a year ago and just as she was almost back to normal, she needed a knee replacement; at the same time I needed back surgery, so we’re both recovering. Our daughter Amy, PhD ’99, and our younger daughter, Katie, have been a huge help. I think of Cornell and hope to go to our 60th Reunion next year, but living in the West makes that trip kind of a big deal, so I guess we’ll see.”\n\nLastly, some brief news from Reverend Kathy Peterson and Carol Britton MacCorkle. Kathy and husband David live in Lemont, IL, where she is an ordained United Methodist minister and has been a “local pastor for almost 50 years.” She still enjoys music and sports and spends time gardening and with children and grandchildren. She and David recently traveled to Scottsdale, AZ. For her part, Carol is retired from real estate and still lives in Santa Barbara, CA. Carol’s recent trips were to extreme global opposites: New Zealand and Iceland. Her granddaughter is a Cornellian.\n\nThat’s it for now. On behalf of our class officers, we hope to see you at our 60th Reunion on Cornell’s campus in early June 2024. I especially wish to thank all of you who heeded my plea for news by responding with a wealth of news forms. Please keep ’em coming! Update me by email, regular mail, our class website, or our class Facebook page. ❖ Bev Johns Lamont (email Bev) | 720 Chestnut St., Deerfield, IL 60015 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1965\n\nRaphael Nevins (Albuquerque, NM) recently returned from a whirlwind trip to Europe. He revisited Nice, where he had spent time in 1963 with other Cornellians. Raphael and his wife, Lorna, just completed a second-story addition to their Albuquerque home, and he adds: “If any classmates might wish to attend the famous Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta in October, please contact me.”\n\nPeter Trozze (Cascais, Portugal) relates: “I retired on May 31, 2022, and on June 1, 2022, Lucinda and I moved to Cascais, Portugal, permanently. We recently celebrated our first year here and have been spending our time exploring Portugal and the rest of Europe, as well as making frequent trips to London to visit our daughter.”\n\nPlease keep in mind that our 60th Reunion class gift involves support for the development of a well-being program under the auspices of the Skorton Center. This is a significant development for the promotion of mental health throughout the Cornell community. Our class gift Reunion committee, under the leadership of Jeff Kass, has been busy in collaboration with Julie Edwards, director of the Skorton Center; a pilot project is already underway and some of our classmates have contributed financially. The program is training and engaging coaches who are experienced, sensitive members of the Cornell community, and not themselves professional psychologists. We believe that in their “layperson” role, the coaches will prove to be a great support for Cornell students and staff. You will hear more about this class gift project in the coming months from class officials, and we look forward to broad support from our classmates.\n\nPlease keep the news coming to us. Remember that people love to hear about your doings, via our column. ❖ Stephen Appell (email Stephen) | Joan Hens Johnson (email Joan) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1966\n\nHope that the high heat and heavy rain are elements (get it?) of the past, as the weather gets cooler.\n\nDouglas Evans wrote from Joppatowne, MD. He was a helicopter pilot in Vietnam and an airline pilot for Northwest Airlines (which was bought by Delta) before he retired in September 2001. His work highlight was three years in Oahu, HI. He married Helen (Fetherolf) ’65 in 1968. Now that he’s retired, Douglas enjoys biking, hiking, RVing, and sky diving. He and Helen had two children and now have four grandchildren. He wrote that in his extended family of 10, they all get along well and all live within a 10-minute walk from his home.\n\nLaurie Krasny Brown sent in a short note, sharing that she continues her concentration in fine art, with paper as the primary material. She is a board member of a regional art museum and is still authoring picture books, most recently one entitled Democracy for Dinosaurs: A Guide for Young Citizens (2020). Laurie’s new interest is studying French. In October 2022, she lived and worked in Arles, France, as the artist in residence. She and her husband also traveled in March to Mexico City.\n\nStephanie Lane Rakofsky wrote from Coral Gables, FL, that she has retired from paid work but is still doing pro bono social work. She also volunteered for Charlie Crist in the last governor’s race. Her family activities include the fact that she has two older grandchildren who have graduated from high school, a third granddaughter who has celebrated her sweet 16, and a new granddaughter who is about 7 months old.\n\nChristie Grigsby Murata lives in Denver, CO, where she says she does lots of “at-home” art projects—and she adds that she’s “using the term ‘art’ loosely!” She is spending more time with her family and shares that she went to Los Angeles to visit her son and his wonderful family. She also writes that she is part of the cheering section for her granddaughters’ various sports.\n\nPatti Talbot Ota wrote from Tucson, AZ, that she is still enjoying all kinds of sports and her eight animals! She was a professor at the University of Arizona in the management information systems department.\n\nTed Sprinkle, DVM ’69, lives in Naples, FL, and wrote that he is “currently serving as CEO of Encore Vet Group, a consolidator of veterinary practices in the U.S. east of the Rockies.” He has ventured away from retirement and has not slowed down but would like to. He is still involved in Thoroughbred racing. Ted and wife Cindy and their children have traveled to Spain and Italy. He relocated to Florida from Connecticut three years ago and loves the new environment and the blue skies.\n\nTom Allen, who lives in Arlington, MA, wrote that he is “well and truly retired. I lead bicycle rides for my town’s community education program. My wife, Carole (Newman) ’67, is a retired pediatrician and active in politics and medical and health policy. “I am married to the same wonderful woman I met on campus!” He also mentioned that his bike rides go for distances of 25 to 35 miles, and they go to Martha’s Vineyard every summer.\n\nIn October 2022, Laurie Krasny Brown ’66 lived and worked in Arles, France, as the artist in residence.\n\nOur class co-president, John Monroe, PhD ’70, lives in Cupertino, CA. I met John because we were both in the Big Red Marching Band. John was and is a serious trombone player. He wrote, “A bucket list item for me has been to experience a British-style brass band competition. With that in mind, I joined the San Francisco Brass Band when it was founded in 2020. In April 2023, we won the second section championship at the North American Brass Band Association competition in Huntsville, AL. In addition, a sextet from the band won second place in the solo and ensemble competition. I played trombone in both groups. Bucket list item checked off! The music was challenging and fun to play. After the brass band adventure, I went off to Italy with four friends and played a couple of concerts in Staffolo (Le Marche), Italy, and nearby Petriolo. Got to back up an Italian tenor singing ‘O Sole Mio.’ A complete hoot.”\n\nJeff Collins has been retired for five years and says he’s loving it. “I’m actively involved in a number of organizations focused on voter rights, environmental protection, women’s reproductive rights, gun control, etc.” He and his wife of 43 years, Rose Mills, traveled a lot last year and this year, after their trips in 2020 and 2021 had to be canceled due to COVID. They have been to Portugal and Italy and plan to attend the annual wildflower festival in Crested Butte, CO, after which they will travel to California to visit friends and then have a one-month trip to England. Jeff added, “Just celebrated my 43rd anniversary with Rose and regularly see my brother Ken Collins ’62.”\n\nMaurice Cerulli (Rockville Centre, NY) is still working and enjoying it. He is now working halftime as a preceptor for fellows in gastroenterology at Northwell Long Island Jewish and North Shore University hospitals. Maurice wrote that he and his wife still like to travel, and they enjoy their cellar of Bordeaux, California, and Italian wines. In 2022, they went to Piedmont, Milan, and Tuscany, and this year they are going to Milan, Tuscany, and Rome.\n\nWe got a very short item from Robert Schubert, who lives in Orinda, CA. He wrote that he is a “senior partner at a class action law firm, working part time.” He also says he enjoys no-limit poker in casinos and has three fairly new grandchildren.\n\nAndrew Berger, JD ’69, wrote, “My wife, Emily (Boykoff) ’68, and I are still living in our creaky old brownstone in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn with our two not-so-well-behaved dogs. Emily retired from the U.S. Attorney’s Office a few years ago and is active in a few political campaigns. Our son Evan and his wife live close by. I will never retire. Still practicing law in Manhattan and about to start my eighth year as an adjunct professor at Cornell Law teaching a seminar in the fall on copyright litigation. Hard to imagine I began my relationship with Cornell more than 60 years ago. Still stay in touch with and often see my senior-year roommates Ron Berenbeim and Dick Cutler. Best to all.”\n\nNow, a note from Alice Katz Berglas and Mary Jansen Everett: “Between gatherings for turkey with stuffing and the champagne toasts of ‘Auld Lang Syne’ come the many versions of traditions that fill November and December. A season of family and friendships and classmates near and far. Our wish to all: good health, new joys, happy adventures—and time to relish each.” ❖ Pete Salinger, MBA ’68 (email Pete) | Susan Rockford Bittker (email Susan) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1967\n\nCarole Newman Allen recalls a favorite memory at Cornell: “Being waylaid by Tom ’66, ME ’67 (my future husband of 56+ years) while exiting Dante class junior year; couldn’t have predicted at the time where it would lead!” A past president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, Carole looks for opportunities to influence health policy. She enjoys gardening—“specifically shrubs and perennials at our two houses, one in Arlington, MA, and the other on Martha’s Vineyard, MA; seeing our 15-year-old grandson thriving; and the return this summer of our younger son and family from Nepal after three years in the Foreign Service.”\n\nJoan Solomon Weiss (Jericho, NY) continues to enjoy “taking photographs and displaying them in juried exhibits across the country.” She’s also “establishing and strengthening new friendships and increasing fitness.” From her time at Cornell, she recalls “excellence in academics and singing Cornell songs in a group setting.”\n\nMax and Laurie Frank Krotman (Port Washington, NY) spend much of their time in Seattle visiting son Adam ’05, daughter-in-law Seema, and grandchildren Saiya, 5, and Kavan, 3. “We can still get down on the floor to play with them and get back up. Max is still merging accounting firms and playing tennis and bridge; Laurie just had her first bat mitzvah, takes lots of courses, and currently moderates a course on the history of Ukraine. As Leonard Cohen says in his documentary, we are standing on the ‘foothills of old age’—but we are still standing!”\n\nRichard Marks, MBA ’68 (Boynton Beach, FL) writes: “Carol and I spent February touring Patagonia and the Antarctic. Lots of penguins, icebergs, and the fabulous Iguazu Falls. I’ve played a couple of rounds of golf with former roommate David Gertler, ME ’68. I’m still the president of the local Cornell Club. In April I was joined by classmates Marsha Beirach Eisen, Richard Tunick, and Richard Bailyn, MD ’71, at a presentation for Colleen Barry, the inaugural dean of the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy.”\n\nJudith Edelstein Kelman (New York, NY) reports that she’s enjoyed “directing the Visible Ink writing program, which I founded for patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. More than 3,000 cancer patients have enrolled, and the program celebrated its 15th anniversary in 2020. A stellar cast of Broadway actors, dancers, and singers volunteered to perform select pieces written by MSK patients.”\n\nJudy adds: “Grandkids are growing up—ours range from 10 to 23. Cornellians include son Matthew ’93, JD ’97, and granddaughter Caroline ’25. We’ve taken all nine of our grandchildren on special trips. The youngest chose to visit NYC. In December we took him to four Broadway shows and The Nutcracker in five days.” Favorite Cornell memory: “The glory of the glorious campus—despite frigid winter temps and crazy sprints between classes—the stunning views, unforgettable professors, and terrific friends all kept me energized and inspired.”\n\nFrank Sprtel (Whitefish Bay, WI) enjoys “doing some consulting and bird watching with wife Mary and four grandchildren. I also like to play golf on good days. We have some medical issues but are working our way through them.” Favorite memories: “Studying economics and zoology and playing football.”\n\nCarole Newman Allen ’67 recalls a favorite memory at Cornell: ‘Being waylaid by Tom ’66, ME ’67 (my future husband of 56+ years) while exiting Dante class junior year.’\n\nJohn Eisenhart (Oregon, OH) volunteers at a science center, a senior center, and metro parks. He’s also on the Y board and is a Kiwanis Club officer. He makes trips to Alaska to tour and for fishing. His Cornell memory: “Great weather—ha. Walking up the Hill to class, and hockey—NCAA champs.”\n\nWilliam Andy Kirmse (Austin, TX) enjoys and engages with his “family and friends, golf, the fitness center, hunting, and overseas travel.” His favorite memories of Cornell are fraternity life and scholastic excellence.\n\nSteven Lazare (Lafayette, CA) likes “spending time with friends and watching the Warriors win. I’m concluding work as a personal financial consultant this year.” He notes that his wife, Linda, died in 2022. Favorite Cornell memory: “Playing sports with my fraternity brothers.”\n\nEric Augusta (Manhattan Beach, CA) summarizes “50+ years of news since graduation! Best times at Cornell: beautiful fall days; Cascadilla Gorge; DTD fraternity friends and parties; singing in the Cornell Glee Club during our 1966 three-month Asia/world tour. Worst time at Cornell: I received the dreaded letter—‘Uncle Sam Wants You …’—so delayed grad school, got into Navy OCS, and became an officer for three years.\n\n“I served aboard the destroyer USS Bigelow (DD-942), and when discharged as lieutenant in 1971, I began Wharton’s MBA program. I was a financial analyst with Ford in Dearborn, then at Xerox’s Computer Services Division in Los Angeles. A good decision: that’s where I met my wife, Janine. We married in 1988; son Ken and daughter Christine are at the E&Y and PwC accounting firms in L.A.\n\n“After five years as CFO at Century Computer Marketing in Marina Del Rey, three mergers, and a bankruptcy, I became an independent Excel consultant. I’m certified to program in Visual Basic for Applications, and I wrote a book, Navigating the Road to Excellence, and taught at UCLA and at corporations.\n\n“I’m now semi-retired. Janine retired as CFO for hi-tech startups. I do occasional consulting, manage real estate, and ride my BMW R1200RT motorcycle. My Cornell experience set the stage for the success I enjoyed in my life. I’m sure most others in our class would agree that a Cornell education is a huge advantage for success in the ‘game of life!’” ❖ Richard Hoffman (email Richard) | 2925 28th St. NW, Washington, DC 20008 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1968\n\nAs we move from fall to winter, we have lots of news from our classmates.

This column was submitted August 15, and you will read it as early holiday cards arrive! I started writing en route home from Ithaca and Reunion 2023. Larry and I were definitely enjoying a Reunion high! Ezra’s (paraphrased) quotes “to do the greatest good” and “to provide instruction to any person in any study” have become an even greater presence at Cornell than in our time. The student body, academic programs, off-campus opportunities, and living units reflect the founder’s objectives. If you were unable to enjoy our 50th, pencil in June 6–9, 2024. Help make our 55th a record-breaking event! Campus has continued to evolve.\n\nNow for news from classmates. Dennis Groves writes from White Plains, NY, that his son had been working for the U.S. embassy in Moscow for 10 years and “managed to escape.” As a retired MD, Dennis recalls “great profs” Ulric Neisser and Andrew Hacker.

The 313 classmates at our 50th, who returned to “10 square miles surrounded by reality” in 2019, may recall that ours was the last Reunion before COVID disrupted the world. For Reunion 2024, please come—either alone or together with a group of “reunion friends” who choose to experience the campus where some realities are suspended and others are very present. Plan now to enjoy magnificent Ithaca, the thought-provoking programs, and the inevitable nostalgia—and find your Reunion friends! Please reflect, reach out to any you remember, and encourage them to join YOU in Ithaca for our 55th! Perhaps your special skills as a project manager, artist, or data specialist would add to our team. Fair warning: Larry and I volunteered in ’79 and continue to enjoy being part of the team. Please take the time to respond to planning communications and come to Reunion 2024! ❖ Nancy Jenkins Krablin (email Nancy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1970s\n\n1970\n\nI find it amazing that this is my 18th column since becoming class correspondent for our class. Column #1 was finished in late September 2020. How things have changed since!\n\nIn a previous column, I spoke of finding “treasures” of my undergrad days in boxes from family moving. There are many things about Cornell, but one sheet caught my eye and generated a short project. The sheet was labeled “Basic Engineering 103, Fall Term 1966, Lecture Seating Assignment.” Yes, we all had specific seats, so the professor would know who we were, and whether we were there! The project was to see if this list of 80 classmates would in some way confirm the old story of engineering graduating only one-third of those who matriculated in it.\n\nHaving some limited access to class records, I could see if classmates graduated, and from what school. Interestingly, in this group, 46 individuals (52.5%) graduated in engineering, many with additional Cornell degrees. An additional nine individuals graduated from Arts & Sciences, CALS, or ILR, meaning that nearly 69% graduated from Cornell—leaving 25 individuals (31%) who did not. So, in this very limited sample, over half of us stuck with becoming engineers and succeeded. So much for the one-third story!\n\nPrograms today are different, with better support and broader, more effective teaching methods and majors, along with better-prepared incoming students, such that much larger percentages remain and succeed in engineering. As the song goes “ … but, oh, to be 20 and back at Cornell …” And, since this is an alumni column, it would be interesting to know how many classmates remained in engineering as a career, and how many moved on to other areas, as I eventually did.\n\nThe other significant recent experience was Reunion 2023. Look in the September/October Class Notes for a column on the Continuous Reunion Club, co-written by me and my friend Connie Santagato Hosterman ’57. And be aware that our next class Reunion, our 55th, is now less than two years away! As there was no actual 50th, this could be the big one!\n\nRichard Roberts (West Winfield, NY) writes briefly, as many of you have, about finding satisfaction in traveling now that he is retired and enjoying time with grandchildren. His favorite memories of his time at Cornell are around friendships built.\n\nPatrick Kelly (Ottawa, ON) continues to find satisfaction in volunteering through the Canadian Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and a group called Wreaths Across Canada, which places Christmas wreaths on the graves of the Canadian fallen.
