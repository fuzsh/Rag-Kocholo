        "text": "1. Letitia James\n\nState Attorney General\n\nState Attorney General Letitia James’ civil investigation into former President Donald Trump’s family business heated up at the start of the year, as her office has sought to question him and his children as his legal team filed its own lawsuit to stop the probe. The Trump case is just one of many for James – she also commissioned the report substantiating multiple accusations of sexual harassment leveled against former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and taken opioid manufacturers to task over the opioid epidemic.\n\n2. Janet DiFiore\n\nChief Judge, State Court of Appeals\n\nJanet DiFiore helms New York’s highest court and manages the state’s vast court system. That position has come with many challenges throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including overseeing the transition from in-person to virtual proceedings. DiFiore has also led new efforts to reimagine the court system, tapping numerous legal experts to find solutions to reduce racial disparities in New York courts, improve technology and address other operational issues.\n\n3. Alvin Bragg\n\nManhattan District Attorney\n\nAlvin Bragg won one of the most heated races in New York City last year, beating out seven other candidates vying to become Manhattan district attorney in the Democratic primary. He is now the first Black person to serve as the borough’s district attorney, taking over high-profile cases like a major investigation into former President Donald Trump’s family business. Soon after taking office, Bragg committed to reducing racial disparities in the criminal justice system by directing staff to stop prosecuting some low-level crimes like subway fare evasion.\n\n4. Eric Gonzalez\n\nBrooklyn District Attorney\n\nHaving spent six years as Brooklyn district attorney, it was reported that Eric Gonzalez had an eye on higher office last year. Rumors swirled that he would run for Letitia James’ position as state attorney general when she was preparing to jump into the gubernatorial race. But her decision to seek reelection instead slowed any momentum for potential challengers. Last April, Gonzalez asked the courts to dismiss 90 convictions based on the testimony of a former New York City Police Department narcotics detective who was indicted for perjury.\n\n5. Damian Williams\n\nU.S. Attorney, Southern District of New York\n\nServing as U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York means handling some of the country’s most headline-worthy federal cases. And Damian Williams, who took over the powerful position in October, has wasted no time in doing so. His office succeeded in prosecuting Ghislaine Maxwell on charges related to sex trafficking at the start of the year. The first Black person to head the 232-year-old office, Williams also created a new civil rights unit within its criminal division.\n\n6. Elizabeth Fine\n\nCounsel to the Governor\n\nElizabeth Fine was among the first top officials to join Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration after she took office in August. Previously executive vice president and general counsel of the Empire State Development Corp., Fine, a longtime public servant, now plays a vital role in advising the governor. She has also worked in the U.S. Justice Department and served as counsel to then-U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.\n\n7. Sylvia Hinds-Radix & Brendan McGuire\n\nCorporation Counsel of New York City; Chief Counsel to the Mayor of New York City\n\nWhen New York City Mayor Eric Adams took office last month, he tapped Sylvia Hinds-Radix and Brendan McGuire to hold key legal positions within the city government. Formerly an appellate judge in Brooklyn, Hinds-Radix has been tasked with overseeing the city Law Department as corporation counsel for the city. McGuire is serving as Adams’ chief counsel after working as a partner at WilmerHale and as a federal prosecutor.\n\n8. Melinda Katz\n\nQueens District Attorney\n\nMelinda Katz became the district attorney for Queens in 2020 after narrowly winning a closely watched primary race. Once in office, Katz created a conviction integrity unit and has since moved to expunge 60 convictions that relied on testimony from three former New York City police officers who later committed crimes. Along with Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez and Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark, she visited Rikers Island last year amid rising concerns about the jail’s poor conditions.\n\n9. Breon S. Peace, Carla B. Freedman & Trini E. Ross\n\nU.S. Attorneys, Eastern District of New York; Northern District of New York; Western District of New York\n\nBreon S. Peace earned a reputation as a white-collar civil litigator with a strong interest in pro bono work focused on criminal justice, civil rights and other issues. This was exemplified by him leading a legal team in 2016 that successfully pushed for the exoneration of a man wrongly convicted of rape and murder. That experience fueled his nomination as U.S. attorney for New York’s Eastern District, where he heads the team handling federal cases in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and Long Island.\n\nLast year, Carla B. Freedman became the first female prosecutor confirmed by the U.S. Senate to serve as U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York, which encompasses large swaths of Northern and Central New York. President Joe Biden nominated the Syracuse-based prosecutor to the position last August. She most recently worked in the Syracuse office of the Northern District of New York, serving as head of its narcotics division.\n\nTrini E. Ross spent more than 23 years as a prosecutor in Buffalo before making history as the first Black woman to serve as U.S. attorney for the Western District of New York last year. She took on the position last October and now oversees the prosecution of federal criminal cases across Western New York. Last month, she told Spectrum News that reducing violent crimes, particularly those involving firearms, would be a priority for her.\n\n10. Darcel Clark\n\nBronx District Attorney\n\nBronx District Attorney Darcel Clark has made prosecuting gun violence a top priority over the past year. Last fall, she called on state lawmakers to change the Raise the Age law so 16- and 17-year-olds possessing guns could be sent to criminal court rather than family court. Clark has served as the borough’s top prosecutor since 2016, after a stint as a judge in the state Supreme Court Appellate Division.\n\n11. Janet Sabel\n\nAttorney-in-Chief and CEO, The Legal Aid Society\n\nJanet Sabel leads one of New York’s most prominent legal nonprofits serving and advocating for low-income New Yorkers. Throughout the past year, The Legal Aid Society has pushed state leaders to provide continued rent relief to tenants and called on government officials to reduce jail and prison populations, especially amid rising COVID-19 cases. Before leading the organization, Sabel served as chief deputy attorney general in the state attorney general’s office.\n\n12. Jerry Goldfeder, Alan Klinger & Dina Kolker\n\nSpecial Counsel; Co-Managing Partner; Partner, Stroock\n\nJerry Goldfeder has long been one of New York’s top election lawyers, as evidenced by a career representing prominent political candidates and elected officials at the local, state and federal levels. Alan Klinger, Stroock’s co-managing partner, manages the firm’s representation of public sector unions and employee benefits funds and has also been at the forefront of shaping workplace health and safety protocols. The United Federation of Teachers and the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association number among the unions to whom he provides outside counsel. Dina Kolker also represents many public sector unions in New York City, including the New York City Council legislative staffers’ union.\n\n13. Joon Kim & Anne Clark\n\nPartners, Cleary Gottlieb; Vladeck, Raskin & Clark PC\n\nOne of the biggest stories in New York politics last year was then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision to resign after the release of a scathing report that substantiated sexual harassment accusations a number of women made against him. That report, overseen by state Attorney General Letitia James, featured extensive research and analysis co-led by Joon Kim and Anne Clark. Kim’s experience as a former acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, and Clark’s history as an expert litigator handling employment and discrimination cases, led James to choose them for the task.\n\n14. Jonathan Lippman\n\nOf Counsel, Latham & Watkins\n\nAfter stepping down as New York state’s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman headed to Latham & Watkins LLP, where he advises clients on New York state law. He has also emerged as a prominent leader for criminal justice reform in New York City, successfully spearheading efforts to close the jail complex on Rikers Island. Last November, Lippman also called on New York officials to do more to reduce the jail’s population amid reports of poor conditions there.\n\n15. Donna Lieberman\n\nExecutive Director, New York Civil Liberties Union\n\nDonna Lieberman has spent two decades leading the New York Civil Liberties Union in its efforts to protect New Yorkers’ civil rights and civil liberties. Under her leadership, the NYCLU has taken several police departments to court for withholding officer misconduct records from the public and has continued to advocate for changes in New York’s policing practices. She and the NYCLU have also come out in support of ending solitary confinement and the state’s Less is More Act.\n\n16. Mimi Rocah\n\nDistrict Attorney, Westchester County\n\nThe Trump Organization already faces legal scrutiny from the Manhattan district attorney and the state attorney general’s office. Last year, Westchester County District Attorney Mimi Rocah joined the list of New York prosecutors eying the former president’s family business practices. Rocah also made national headlines in January when she reported that law enforcement officials “missed opportunities” when investigating multimillionaire Robert Durst regarding the disappearance of his first wife in 1982.\n\n17. Vincent Pitta, Robert Bishop & Vito Pitta\n\nChair and Managing Partner; Partner; Co-Managing Partner, Pitta LLP\n\nPitta LLP boasts an extensive client list, representing major unions in New York such as the Detectives’ Endowment Association and the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council. New York City Mayor Eric Adams also numbers among the law firm’s clients: He hired Pitta LLP as a political and legal consultant for his campaign. Such success can be credited to the firm’s leaders, Vincent Pitta, Robert Bishop and Vito Pitta. The powerhouse trio also holds top positions at the affiliated lobbying firm Pitta Bishop & Del Giorno LLC.\n\n18. Howard Fensterman\n\nManaging Partner, Abrams Fensterman\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams has a formidably close-knit inner circle – and the law firm Abrams Fensterman is certainly part of that fabric. Adams tapped the firm for support during his mayoral campaign and selected its longtime partner, Frank Carone, to join his administration in a key role as his chief of staff. That relationship is certainly a boon for managing partner Howard Fensterman, who has been working to expand Abrams Fensterman’s clout across the state.\n\n19. Mylan Denerstein & Randy Mastro\n\nPartners, Gibson Dunn\n\nThese two powerhouse attorneys bring different sets of expertise to Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. Having served as counsel to the governor and executive deputy attorney general, Mylan Denerstein has a keen understanding of public policy and investigations. That experience landed her in the position of serving as an independent monitor overseeing racial disparities and reform efforts at the New York City Police Department. Randy Mastro, a government veteran who worked in the Giuliani administration, is a top litigator at the firm. Recently, he has represented a group of landlords opposing New York’s eviction moratorium.\n\n20. Edward Wallace, Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick & India Sneed\n\nCo-Chair and Shareholder; Of Counsel; Associate, Greenberg Traurig\n\nAs one of the country’s biggest law firms, Greenberg Traurig wields plenty of political clout in New York. And that’s certainly true for Edward Wallace, who advises companies with business before local and state governments. The high-powered attorney has guided Columbia University, Extell’s Riverside Center and other institutions through development projects in New York City. The law firm also employs Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick, a veteran judge who has served in New York’s highest court. That experience led Chief Judge Janet DiFiore to appoint her as co-chair of the New York State Justice Task Force, which examines wrongful convictions. An associate at Greenberg Traurig, India Sneed focuses on government relations. Sneed took various ballot challenges during primary elections in the state and has guided campaigns in New York City’s local elections.\n\n21. Benjamin Brafman\n\nOwner, Brafman & Associates PC\n\nIn 2017, The New Yorker described Benjamin Brafman as “the last of the big-time defense attorneys.” He continues to earn that sobriquet, given that he regularly takes on high-profile cases representing celebrities such as Jay-Z and Sean Combs. Brafman also doesn’t shy away from controversy, having taken on “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli and Miramax’s Harvey Weinstein as clients – and that’s just a small sample of the influential clients Brafman has represented throughout his career.\n\n22. Barry H. Berke, Jeffrey L. Braun & Gary P. Naftalis\n\nPartner; Counsel; Partner, Kramer Levin\n\nNot many attorneys can say they led an impeachment trial against a U.S. president. Barry Berke, an influential trial attorney at Kramer Levin, can. And it’s only one of several high-profile cases he’s handled, having represented former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio through criminal investigations and CBS Corp. in a dispute with its former CEO Leslie Moonves. Gary P. Naftalis, the firm’s co-chair, is a heavy-hitting trial attorney who’s defended plenty of top corporations and business executives such as Kenneth Langone. Jeffrey L. Braun brings plenty of real estate expertise to Kramer Levin, having guided a wide range of clients through land use and environmental-use disputes in New York.\n\n23. Debra S. Katz\n\nFounding Partner, Katz, Marshall & Banks\n\nDebra S. Katz has a well-earned reputation for handling major cases related to sexual harassment and employment law. Throughout the past year, she used that expertise to fight on behalf of Charlotte Bennett, a former state aide who accused then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo of sexual harassment. And as Cuomo’s legal team continues to fight back against allegations after his resignation, Katz continues to fervently defend her client and has indicated she has a client accusing the ex-governor’s brother, former CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, of sexual misconduct.\n\n24. Jeffrey A. Lichtman & Jeffrey Bloom\n\nCo-Chairs, LawPAC\n\nThe New York State Trial Lawyers Association, which represents 3,500 trial attorneys across the state, also manages an influential political action committee, LawPAC. Its operations are overseen by co-chairs Jeffrey A. Lichtman, a senior partner and trial attorney at Trolman Glaser Corley & Lichtman, and Jeffrey Bloom, a partner at Gair, Gair, Conason, Rubinowitz, Bloom, Hershenhorn, Steigman & Mackauf. In the past year, LawPAC has contributed $68,700 to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s campaign.\n\n25. Sandra Doorley\n\nMonroe County District Attorney\n\nThis past year was an eventful one in Rochester politics. The city’s mayor, Lovely Warren, agreed to resign as part of a plea deal with Monroe County District Attorney Sandra Doorley, resolving cases against Warren related to campaign finance violations and gun and child endangerment charges. In addition to her role as Monroe County’s top prosecutor, Doorley also served as president of the District Attorneys Association of New York until last June.\n\n26. Michael McMahon\n\nStaten Island District Attorney\n\nWhile some New York City prosecutors have embraced being called progressive reformers, Staten Island District Attorney Michael McMahon has eschewed that descriptor. Having spent six years as district attorney, McMahon has made combating the opioid crisis on Staten Island a priority. His office has partnered with local health care providers to operate diversion and outreach programs as alternatives to incarceration for people dealing with substance misuse.\n\n27. Anne Donnelly & Raymond A. Tierney\n\nDistrict Attorneys, Nassau County; Suffolk County\n\nThe “red wave” that swept Long Island during last fall’s local elections helped propel Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly and Suffolk County District Attorney Raymond A. Tierney into office. A longtime prosecutor, Donnelly has pledged to lobby state lawmakers to change the state’s bail law and reforms to discovery. Tierney has also had an eye on getting the bail reform law repealed and bringing back a unit to the district attorney’s office focused on prosecuting gangs.\n\n28. Jeh Johnson & Brad Karp\n\nPartner; Chair, Paul, Weiss\n\nWhen state Chief Judge Janet DiFiore began efforts to address racism and bias in the court system, she tapped Jeh Johnson to conduct a thorough review of its policies and practices. Johnson led the creation of that 2020 report, which outlined racial disparities and other areas for improvement in New York’s court system. Johnson was the U.S. secretary of homeland security from 2013 to 2017 before returning to Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he had served as a partner since 1993. Paul, Weiss is led by its longtime chair, Brad Karp, who’s known for his representation of corporate and financial institutions.\n\n29. J. Anthony Jordan\n\nPresident, District Attorneys Association of the State of New York\n\nThe District Attorneys Association of the State of New York advocates on behalf of district attorneys in each of New York’s 62 counties at a time when Albany is laser-focused on criminal justice reform. Its work is led by Washington County District Attorney J. Anthony Jordan, who became the association’s president in June. This year, Jordan will push both for state lawmakers to revise the bail reform law to allow judges to consider the danger defendants may pose and for them to create a new statewide pretrial services agency.\n\n30. Deborah Archer\n\nPresident, American Civil Liberties Union\n\nDeborah Archer had an extensive career supporting civil rights and civil liberties before becoming the American Civil Liberties Union’s first Black president last year. She serves as New York University School of Law’s director of its Civil Rights Clinic and co-faculty director of its Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law. Under her leadership, the union has outlined a plan to fight systemic racism by pushing for expanded voting rights, fair housing and other priorities. She previously chaired the New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board.\n\n31. Bart Schwartz\n\nChair, Guidepost Solutions\n\nBart Schwartz handles the difficult task of making sure the New York City Housing Authority maintains safe and quality conditions for its hundreds of thousands of tenants. Schwartz has served as the federal monitor for the agency since 2019, bringing with him experience as a former chief of the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\n32. Elizabeth Holtzman & Belinda Schwartz\n\nCounsel; Partner, Herrick, Feinstein\n\nElizabeth Holtzman has more than two decades of experience in government, having served as a member of Congress, Brooklyn’s district attorney and New York City comptroller. That makes her a valuable asset to Herrick, Feinstein, where she serves as co-chair of its government relations group. The firm turns to Belinda Schwartz for commercial real estate matters, including guiding developers, owners and other clients through tough negotiations and transactions. Schwartz has advised on major projects in New York City, including the Empire Stores complex in Brooklyn Bridge Park.\n\n33. Barbara S. Jones & Paul Shechtman\n\nPartners, Bracewell\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s dealings in Ukraine remain a top story in U.S. politics. Barbara S. Jones, a retired federal judge and partner at Bracewell, will play a key role in identifying relevant materials for an ongoing criminal investigation into Giuliani – who, ironically, used to be a shareholder at Bracewell. Paul Shechtman, a former federal prosecutor and state official under former Gov. George Pataki, is also a major power player in New York. He represented Melissa DeRosa, who served as a top aide to then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, during investigations into the Cuomo administration this past year.\n\n34. Jim Walden\n\nPartner, Walden Macht & Haran\n\nSince co-founding Walden Macht & Haran in 2015, Jim Walden has taken on cases of significance at the local, national and international levels. He has led a class-action lawsuit against the New York City Department of Education for failing to protect students from bullying and represented public housing tenants in a lawsuit against the New York City Housing Authority for poor housing conditions. Walden also represents Grigory Rodchenkov, a Russian whistleblower who helped inspire legislation in the United States criminalizing doping schemes in international sporting events.\n\n35. T. Andrew Brown & Sherry Levin Wallach\n\nPresident; President-Elect, New York State Bar Association\n\nThe New York State Bar Association advocates on behalf of legal professionals across the state, advancing the policy priorities to Albany and Washington, D.C. Its advocacy and education efforts are spearheaded by T. Andrew Brown, founder and managing partner of Brown Hutchinson and former corporation counsel for Rochester. He has served as the association’s president since last June. Sherry Levin Wallach, deputy executive director of The Legal Aid Society of Westchester County, will take over as president later this year.\n\n36. Kenneth Fisher & Stuart Shorenstein\n\nMembers, Cozen O'Connor\n\nKenneth Fisher is a go-to expert in real estate and land use in New York City. His experience serving in the New York City Council makes him a strong ally for clients with business before local government. Fisher has advised an affiliate of SUNY Downstate Medical Center amid the closure of Long Island College Hospital and has represented Lincoln Equities Group on a 2,400-unit development in Queens. Stuart Shorenstein heads up much of the firm’s government relations efforts, helping companies, nonprofits, colleges and other clients advance their priorities on local, state and federal levels.\n\n37. Jon Mechanic, Melanie Meyers & David Karnovsky\n\nPartners, Fried Frank\n\nThese three attorneys bring extensive real estate expertise to Fried Frank. Jonathan Mechanic heads the real estate department at the law firm, advising major developers, investors and owners in commercial real estate transactions. Recently, Mechanic has been handling projects such as Vornado Realty Trust’s Penn District development. Melanie Meyers and David Karnovsky have the benefit of both having served as general counsel to the New York City Department of City Planning – government experience that no doubt helps these high-powered attorneys get clients’ projects off the ground.\n\n38. Cyrus Vance Jr.\n\nPartner, Baker McKenzie\n\nFormer Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. is back in the private sector after more than 10 years in elected office. Now a partner at Baker McKenzie, Vance serves as global chair of the firm’s cyber and data security practice, where he works to protect clients from those risks and other international threats. The veteran prosecutor worked on numerous high-profile cases during his time as district attorney, including the sexual assault case against former Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein and an ongoing probe of former President Donald Trump’s business practices.\n\n39. Michael Waldman\n\nPresident, Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law\n\nMichael Waldman leads an institute focused on protecting democracy, researching and advocating for voting rights, election security, campaign finance reform and other issues. Since taking the reins at the Brennan Center for Justice in 2005, Waldman has called on Congress to pass the Freedom to Vote Act and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to expand and protect voting rights. He also spearheaded the center’s lawsuit against Texas for laws limiting voting access last year.\n\n40. Sheila S. Boston\n\nPresident, New York City Bar Association\n\nThe New York City Bar Association, led by Sheila S. Boston, represents more than 25,000 lawyers and law students, advocating for policies supported by legal professionals. Some of its advocacy priorities at the state level for 2022 include pushing for an overhaul to the state Joint Commission on Public Ethics and expanding tenants’ access to legal representation during eviction proceedings. When not working on the association’s behalf, Boston is a partner at Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer.\n\n41. Jocelyn Strauber\n\nCommissioner, New York City Department of Investigation\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams nominated Jocelyn Strauber to lead the city Department of Investigation last year, and at the end of February, the former federal prosecutor assumed the post, in which she oversees a wide range of investigations related to municipal corruption. She previously was at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom and headed the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York’s unit dedicated to investigating terrorism and the narcotics trade.\n\n42. Michael A. Cardozo & Paul Salvatore\n\nPartners, Proskauer\n\nHaving previously served as corporation counsel for New York City, Michael A. Cardozo is well equipped to navigate New York’s courts. New York City agencies and national sports leagues are among the institutions that have relied on Cardozo’s legal expertise. He also helped draft an amicus brief on behalf of the Coalition for the Homeless last year regarding a case before the New York Court of Appeals. Paul Salvatore has a focus on labor and employment law, having advised on collective bargaining agreements in New York’s real estate and construction industries. He has represented clients such as the Real Estate Board of New York and Related Companies.\n\n43. Faiza Saeed\n\nPresiding Partner, Cravath\n\nIn the past year, Faiza Saeed has spearheaded an overhaul of the pay system at Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP that now calculates partners’ compensation based on performance in addition to seniority. It’s a significant shift for the storied law firm and one made with the goal of attracting and retaining top talent. Having served as the firm’s presiding partner since 2017, Saeed is a powerhouse attorney who has advised on many major deals, including Disney’s 2018 $85 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox.\n\n44.
