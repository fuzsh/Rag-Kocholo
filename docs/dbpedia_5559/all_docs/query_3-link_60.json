        "text": "Ayanna Johnson '09, president\n\nI am a public health professional focusing on strategic partnerships and workforce development for the Maternal and Child Health Bureau at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Resources and Services Administration. Previously, I supported the creation of our nation’s public health agenda, Healthy People 2030 at HHS and led healthy aging initiatives. I was also a health policy fellow for the 19th US Surgeon General. I received my MSPH in reproductive, perinatal and women’s health from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. As part of my role as Alumni Council president, I am a member of the College’s Board of Managers. Outside of work, you can find me in the nation’s capital spending time with friends and family, exploring the city, enjoying a comedy show or traveling. I’m a proud member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.\n\nMy Swarthmore experience was invaluable and I want to foster alumni engagement with the College and help current students create organic connections with alumni, to explore the diversity in our alumni experience.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nJames E. Sailer '90, vice president\n\nFor the past 17 years, I have worked at the Population Council, an international nonprofit research organization dedicated to improving reproductive health, education, and development opportunities for women, men, and especially adolescent girls. I now lead the Council's Center for Biomedical Research, which develops, tests, and secures regulatory approval for novel contraceptives like Norplant, Mirena, and Annovera. My work has taken me to Europe, Chile, Mexico, Egypt, Kenya, South Africa, and India. I live in Brooklyn near Prospect Park with my wife, oversized dog, and sometimes our college student son. Many of my best friends come from my days at Swarthmore. Notable personal achievement: I won Carl Kasell's voice on my answering machine as a successful contestant on \"Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me.\" I joined the Alumni Council because I love meeting and working with other Swarthmore alumni, and with Swat students.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nSinan A. Kazaklar '14, chief of staff\n\nSince graduating from Swarthmore in 2014, I have lived in London and San Francisco and am finally moving back to the East Coast in spring. Being an international scholarship student from Turkey, I have received a great deal of support from Swarthmore before, during, and after my time on campus and have been doing my best to give back to the community. I am excited to take it one step further with the Alumni Council and hope to help the College continue its tradition of diversity and excellence.\n\nI joined the Alumni Council, because I wanted to connect with current students as well as alumni to help where I can in areas such as being an international student, career prospects, and life after Swarthmore.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nTwan Claiborne '07, alumni engagement liaison\n\nI currently live in Harlem, New York, my home of eleven years. Entering my twelfth year in education, I am a Grade Level Dean at a private Quaker special education school in Brooklyn Heights. Outside of work, I am involved in various sports leagues and community organizations, including the New York Gay Football League (NYGFL), Big Apple Recreational Sports (BARS) and New York Collective of Radical Education (NYCORE). I also play dodgeball competitive in the Elite circuit of USA Dodgeball, participating in various tournaments across the country. Additionally I am involved in New York LGBTQIA+ nightlife as the drag artist Kenya Keepup.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\n​\n\nMaria Paula Mello '08, student engagement liaison\n\nI am an assistant professor of special education at St. John’s University in New York City. I am also a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA). In this role, I train future special education teachers and conduct research to improve the quality of life for young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). My research focuses on the availability and development of post-secondary opportunities for young adults with IDD, specifically in the areas of college immersion, independent living, housing, and self-advocacy.\n\nI joined the Alumni Council so I could give back to the Swat community and stay connected to other Swatties and to the college.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\n​​​​​\n\nJason Gray Zengerle '96, SwatTalks director\n\nI’m a writer for The New York Times Magazine. Over the years, I’ve also worked at GQ, New York Magazine, and The New Republic. One of my favorite things during my time at Swarthmore was writing seminar papers. When it dawned on me during my senior year that my days of writing those papers were about to come to an end, I decided to become a journalist so that I could keep on writing.\n\nI primarily cover politics—in 2019, I won the Toner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting from Syracuse University—but occasionally my editors indulge me and let me write about basketball. I live in Chapel Hill, NC, with Claire Farel ’97 and our two children. If any alumni ever want to talk about journalism, politics, or the suddenly mighty Swarthmore men’s hoops team, they should get in touch.\n\nI joined the Alumni Council to broaden and intensify my efforts to mentor Swarthmore students interested in journalism.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nDaniela Kucz '14, special projects officer\n\nI'm based in DC, where I work for a tech company in the federal health space. I previously worked in the non-profit world, where I focused on advancing reproductive health. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, baking, finding new music, and running.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nSaba Thackurdeen '12, special projects officer\n\nI am a biocultural conservationist working as a grant maker to uplift nature, people, and their wellbeing. I spent 7 years working as an ally and environmental anthropologist with indigenous communities in the South Pacific. I currently serve as Program Associate for the Environment at the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nCharles T. Sussman '05, special liaison on athletics and wellness\n\nI graduated from Swarthmore in 2005, double majoring in engineering and economics. While at Swarthmore, I served on the Student Council. I was a four-year letter winner and a two-time captain of the Men’s Lacrosse team, earning Academic All-Conference as well as Honorable Mention All-Conference honors. Since graduating, I have worked in the financial services industry, starting at Lehman Brothers in New York, moving to Royal Bank of Canada in Calgary, and then landing at Bank of America back in New York, where I am currently a managing director as the head of oil derivatives trading. I am also chair of the Garnet Club Advancement Council. I reside in New York City with my wife, Brooke, and two daughters, Wyatt and Gray. I am also on the board of Redefine Her Street, a nonprofit started at Swarthmore by fellow Alumni Council member Christine Kim ’17. In my free time, I enjoy running and skiing.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nBoHee Yoon '01, nominating chair and immediate past president\n\nI have been counsel at Fortress Investment Group since 2014, and was previously secretary of Drive Shack Inc. (NYSE:DS) and an associate at Debevoise & Plimpton LLP, where I served on the diversity committee. I have been a member of Alumni Council since 2016 and currently serve as its president, and have served as an ex officio member of Swarthmore's Board of Managers since 2020. Since 2019, I have also served as a member of the inaugural Advisory Board of the Studley Graduate Program in International Affairs (GPIA) at The New School. In 2016, Fordham Law School's Asian Pacific American Law Students Association presented me with The Honorable Denny Chin '78 Alumni Award for Excellence in the Legal Profession. I graduated from Swarthmore with a B.A. in political science. I earned an M.A. in international affairs from the Studley GPIA at The New School in 2006 and a J.D. from Fordham Law School in 2009. I reside in Manhattan with my husband, Jose Claros, Jr. and our rescue dog, Oliver.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nEmily Mindel Gottlieb '95, secretary\n\nI serve as Deputy Director for Law and Policy at the Center for Justice & Democracy, a nonprofit consumer organization dedicated to protecting the U.S. civil justice system. Swarthmore inspired and prepared me for this career path of public policy engagement. A native New Yorker, I returned to the city after college and currently divide my time between NYC and Vermont with my husband and two children. For many years I was actively involved with my high school as an Alumni Council member, class officer, task force co-chair and member of the Board of Trustees — volunteer opportunities I truly valued since they allowed me to stay connected and give back to my school community. I also enjoy travel (six continents down, one to go!), yoga, baking, movies and the NYT crossword puzzle.\n\nI joined the Alumni Council because it's a way to become more involved with the school, engage with a cross-section of alumni, contribute to alumni initiatives and support current students. I welcome questions about working as an attorney in the public interest sector.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nTom Blakelock '21\n\nAt Swarthmore, I earned my B.A. in Economics and Mathematics. As Senior Class President in 2021, I had the honor of working with the class officers and commencement planning committee to develop and execute our senior week, virtual commencement ceremony, and in-person grad celebration. Additional positions I held at the college include: RA, Econometrics TA, Science Associate, and LaunchDeck Data Science Mentor. I am now working at Swiss Re as a Solutions Origination & Market Analyst within L&H Solutions Americas. In my free time, I love getting morning coffee with friends and catching up on all my fav Netflix series in the evening. I look forward to working with Alumni Council.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nElizabeth Bramson-Boudreau '94\n\nI graduated from Swarthmore in 1994; well-trained but lost. What on earth happens now, I wondered. I followed what felt like a meandering path at the time, but turned out just right. I worked on Wall Street and in consulting and lived in Europe for a decade. Today I am the publisher and CEO of MIT Technology Review; the parent to two interesting and often challenging teenagers; wife of an academic; daughter; sister. I am on the boards of the Harvard Public Health Magazine and the MIT Museum. I enjoy kayaking and CrossFit and I have a weakness for anything marketed to me on Instagram.>\n\nSwarthmore formed me. I see the world through lenses it has installed. I can contribute by supporting students or alumni seeking work in media or tech and by sharing my experiences finding a rewarding career.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nAmanda Brown '14\n\nI live in Brooklyn, New York and work as a lawyer at the boutique law firm Rundlet Advisory PLLC advising entrepreneurs and investors, with a special interest in supporting founders of color. After graduating from Swarthmore in 2014, I worked as a paralegal at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for a few years (a position I landed with the help of a Swarthmore alumna!) before attending Harvard Law School. I'm also the secretary of the NYC Bar Association's Non-Profit Organizations Committee and a junior board member of the Lower Eastside Girls Club. In my free time I like running in the city and traveling the world!\n\nSwarthmore alumni helped me tremendously while I was there, and I’m excited to give back to the community by sharing my experiences with current students, and especially supporting first-generation college students.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nMichael A. Costonis '92\n\nI am the Executive Vice President, Chief Operations Officer for CNA Financial, a leading global commercial insurance company. At Swarthmore, I was a co-captain of the Golf Team, and a member of several student organizations most notably the College Judiciary Committee. After graduation, I had a 26-year career at Accenture, where I was a Senior Managing Director. I have remained part of the Swarthmore community by helping to establish the Pat Trinder Memorial Scholarship. I am married to Marissa Costonis, and have two children, Mac Costonis (Villanova School of Business, '23) and Mia Costonis (Springside Chestnut Hill, '21). My family and I live in Lower Gwynedd, PA and enjoy surfing, cooking, and playing with our dog, Mochi.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nLaura Damerville\n\nI am an attorney who has dedicated my career to serving nonprofit organizations. I currently work as an Associate General Counsel at Howard Hughes Medical Institute, a science philanthropy that advances biomedical research and science education. Prior to joining HHMI, I was an Assistant General Counsel at the Smithsonian Institution and represented a diverse group of nonprofit clients at Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered and Ropes & Gray LLP. I also spent a year in Germany as a Fellow of the Robert Bosch Foundation. At Swarthmore I studied Studio Art and Economics and dedicated much of my time to Multi, a student affinity organization that I co-founded in 2000. I live in Silver Spring, Maryland with my husband, Samuel Sadow ‘03, our two children, and a very bossy cat.\n\nI hope to join the Alumni Council to help develop mentoring and networking opportunities for students and recent alumni.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nJames Ellis '91\n\nAs a first-generation college student, Swarthmore made a tremendous difference in my life’s trajectory. After graduating in 1991 I earned a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard University and then served as a Central Intelligence Agency officer for 22 years where l led units in the US, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia covering nearly every region or issue. Since retiring in 2020, I’ve worked as the Vice President for Open-Source Intelligence Programs at Orbis Operations. I also am a guest lecturer for intelligence courses at Tufts, Georgetown, NDU, and Catholic University.\n\nSwarthmore fostered my lifelong passion to learn about the world and to leverage that knowledge to make the world a kinder and more prosperous place. I live in McLean, VA with my wife Maddy (who I met through a Swarthmore classmate) and 3 boys—including one at Swarthmore—2 cats, and more books than I can count.\n\nI’d like to help Swarthmore remain the inspiring college I treasure and further Swarthmore’s positive impact on the US and world by promoting public service as an attractive option for our graduates.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nJohn Hearn '93\n\nI graduated from Swarthmore in 1993 with a degree in Political Science.

Today I’m Managing Partner of Stimulus, a brand innovation consultancy that helps launch new, game-changing organizations and transform existing ones.

Jawaad Hussain '05\n\nAfter graduation in '05, I moved to Brooklyn for medical school. I then returned to the greater Philadelphia area, studied pediatrics, and am now a professor of pediatrics and director of complex disease management. My sleep deprivation is no longer caused by studying for biology exams but rather by trying to keep up with my three children.\n\nI joined the Alumni Council because it is a good way of giving back to a community that matters so much to me.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nKatee Kemether (she/her) '23\n\nKatee graduated from Swarthmore in 2023 with a double major in Political Science and Biology.

I earned my MA in political science from Stony Brook University and PhD in political science and political cognition from Indiana University, which led me to Wellesley College as a visiting assistant professor for three years.

I am currently writing my first book on Black celebrity in late 20th and early 21st century U.S. television and digital media culture.\n\nI joined the Alumni Council because Swarthmore taught me how to think - the school allowed me to develop a curiosity for the world and to search for my place in it. I am passionate about community-building and I want to help alums network with each other, specifically through arts and culture as well as social justice. I am also interested in fostering programs for 1st generation alumni who are trying to figure out their post-grad personal and professional life paths as Swatties.\n\nConnect with me on SwatLink\n\nMargaret Nordstrom '70\n\nI graduated from Swarthmore with a BA in political science/international relations in 1970.

I also serve on the Executive Council of the Pennsylvania Bar Association YLD and on the Board of Governors of the Florida Bar YLD.

Outside of bar activities, I serve on the Seton Hall Law Alumni Council and the Generation Now Committee of Volunteer Lawyers for Justice.
