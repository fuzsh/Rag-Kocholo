        "text": "Adam Richard Sandler was born September 9, 1966 in Brooklyn, New York, to Judith (Levine), a teacher at a nursery school, and Stanley Alan Sandler, an electrical engineer. He is of Russian Jewish descent. At 17, he took his first step towards becoming a stand-up comedian when he spontaneously took the stage at a Boston comedy club. He found he was a natural comic. He nurtured his talent while at New York University (graduating with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1991) by performing regularly in clubs and at universities. During his freshman year, he snagged a recurring role as the Huxtable family's friend Smitty on Die Bill Cosby Show (1984). While working at a comedy club in L.A., he was \"discovered\" by Dennis Miller, who recommended him to Saturday Night Live (1975) producer Lorne Michaels and told him that Sandler had a big talent. This led to his being cast in the show in 1990, which he also wrote for in addition to performing. After Saturday Night Live (1975), Sandler went on to the movies, starring in such hit comedies as Airheads (1994), Happy Gilmore - Ein Champ zum Verlieben (1996), Billy Madison - Ein Chaot zum Verlieben (1995) and Big Daddy (1999). He has also starred in Mr. Deeds (2002) alongside Winona Ryder; Adam Sandlers acht verrückte Nächte (2002), an animated movie about the Jewish festival of Chanukah; and Punch-Drunk Love (2002). He also writes and produces many of his own films and has composed songs for several of them, including Eine Hochzeit zum Verlieben (1998). Sandler has had several of his songs placed on the \"Billboard\" charts, including the classic \"The Chanukah Song\".\n\nBridgette Wilson was born in Gold Beach, Oregon, on September 25, 1973. The brown-eyed actress grew up there with her parents, Kathy and Dale Wilson, and sister, Tracy Wilson. Her first taste of fame came in 1990 when she won Miss Teen USA. The next year she was in Los Angeles taking acting classes. Her break-through came in 1991 when she landed the role of Lisa Fenimore Castillo on the daytime soap California Clan (1984). In 1992 she made her film debut as Arnold Schwarzenegger's daughter in Last Action Hero (1993). Soon after she was seen alongside Kristy Swanson in Die Rebellen (1995). Her first lead role was in Billy Madison - Ein Chaot zum Verlieben (1995) playing Veronica Vaughan, the love interest of Adam Sandler's Billy. Several serious films followed, including roles in Nixon - Der Untergang eines Präsidenten (1995), Sweet Evil (1996) and Ein Licht in meinem Herzen (1996). Bridgette was later seen alongside many teen starlets in the horror film Ich weiß, was du letzten Sommer getan hast (1997). Bridgette played the arrogant Elsa Shivers, who does not survive to the final credits. She is also an accomplished songwriter and singer, so far she has made two CDs; \"Gimme a Kiss\" and \"I Only Want to Be with You.\" Besides the song and movie career, she is also an avid supporter of MADD, American Oceans Campaign, and several AIDS organizations. Her film Haunted Hill (1999) reached #1 at the box-office, over Halloween weekend, and she also starred in the comedy Just Visiting - Die schärfste Zeitreise aller Zeiten! (2001).\n\nMark Beltzman has been acting, writing, and directing for since 1981. He was a founding member of Improv Olympic in Chicago and of the legendary group, Barons Barracudas. Mark has worked and directed at the famed Second City in Chicago.

He was also instructor/director at The Second City Training Center, Improv Olympic West and the Upfront Comedy Showcase as well as All over the U.S., U.K., and France. His generosity of spirit and love for the art has influenced many young performers who continue to value him as a source of creativity and inspiration through personal contact and theater workshops. He continues to be a requested advisor, director and acting coach to some of the hottest young talent in the business.\n\nMark's passion as a highly creative person and seasoned ensemble performer is to continue to create a body of work that reflects his level of integrity and commitment to quality. It is critical to him that the concepts of \"working together as a group\" and \"making each other look good\" are an integral part of any ensemble work. He encourages cast and crew to remove obstacles and to elevate the text to be the most important aspect of the creative process.\n\nMark has also acquired a great deal of knowledge about the creative process of producing, writing and directing while performing in such notable productions as: Mo Money, Billy Madison, The Wedding Singer, Speed 2, Star Maps, Lovely and Amazing, and Employee of the Month, Factory, Seinfeld, Rosanne, Norm, Curb Your Enthusiasm, According to Jim, Cold Case, House, True Jackson VP, The Young and the Restless, and Pretty Little Liars.\n\nMark's ability to create \"something from nothing\" is exemplified in the outreach program he created in 2006, called \"New Choice.\" Mark and a crew of established industry professionals go into the inner city and teach improvisational and filmmaking skills to the youth. New Choice is now a 501 (c) 3 not for profit, and continues to expand.\n\nMacdonald was born Norman Gene Macdonald in Quebec City, Quebec. He began his career in stand-up comedy. Macdonald's first job was writing for The Dennis Miller Show (1992) and then Roseanne (1988).

During that time, he also starred in the movie Dumm gelaufen - Kidnapping für Anfänger (2000), opposite Dave Chappelle.\n\nEugene Levy is an award-winning actor, writer, and producer. He has appeared in more than 60 motion pictures to date, eight of which having topped the $100M mark. The box office success of films such as Haus über Kopf (2003), Im Dutzend billiger 2: Zwei Väter drehen durch (2005) , and Ein Geschenk des Himmels - Vater der Braut 2 (1995) have established him as one of Hollywood's most popular comedic actors. But it was the role of Noah Levenstein in the American Pie franchise that cemented his reputation as America's favorite Dad. Levy's most recent big-screen role was that of Dory's Dad in the Disney/Pixar smash Finding Dory, in which he stars alongside Ellen DeGeneres and Diane Keaton. The film has surpassed the $1B mark worldwide, and is on track to become one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time.\n\nPartnering with Christopher Guest, Levy earned critical acclaim for co-writing and co-starring in Best In Show, Waiting For Guffman, For Your Consideration, and A Mighty Wind.

Together, the trio is known as JKL Productions. Lucas decided to make videos by himself a while after he came up with the character you all love, Fred, who is an annoying 6-year-old with an uncaring mother and is most noted for his sped-up voice. Lucas said that he created the first Fred video to poke fun at video bloggers who talk about every single thing that they're doing in the video. The first video received tons of positive feedback, and Lucas continued to post videos in the Fred series, which he edits, directs, and acts in by himself. When not making videos, Lucas auditions for movie and TV roles, and also pitches ideas to television channels. He is also a dancer and takes jazz, tap, and hip-hop classes. Lucas resides in Columbus, Nebraska, with his two brothers and five sisters. He is the middle child.\n\nBradley Whitford's credits in film, television and theater include work with some of the most noted writers, directors and playwrights in the arts, and constitute a career worthy of a Juilliard-trained actor -- which he is. But stardom is something else altogether, and it remained elusive, at least until 1999 and his appearance on NBC's acclaimed political drama, The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999).\n\nBradley Whitford was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Genevieve Smith Whitford, a poet and writer, and George Van Norman Whitford. He studied theater and English literature at Wesleyan University and earned a master's degree in theater from the prestigious Juilliard Theater Center. Whitford's first professional performance was in the off-Broadway production of \"Curse of the Starving Class,\" with Kathy Bates. He also starred in the Broadway production of \"The West Wing\" creator Aaron Sorkin's \"A Few Good Men.\" His additional theater credits include \"Three Days of Rain\" at the Manhattan Theatre Club, \"Measure for Measure\" at the Lincoln Center, and the title role in \"Coriolanus\" at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C.\n\nSome of Whitford's most memorable performances include roles in such films as Die Muse (1999) with Albert Brooks and Der 200 Jahre Mann (1999) with Robin Williams. He has also appeared in Der Duft der Frauen (1992), Perfect World (1993), Philadelphia (1993), Der Klient (1994), Mein Leben für dich (1993), Red Corner - Labyrinth ohne Ausweg (1997), Aus Mangel an Beweisen (1990), and Ein Präsident für alle Fälle (1996). He also had a prominent supporting part in the horror thriller Get Out (2017), as a suspicious suburban father.\n\nOften considered hip-hop's first lady, the woman behind the moniker Queen Latifah was born Dana Elaine Owens on March 18, 1970, in East Orange, New Jersey. She is the daughter of Rita (Bray), a teacher, and Lancelot Owens Sr. She came from a police family-both her father and her older brother were cops-which would later influence her rhyming style and life philosophy. Her brother died in a motorcycle accident in 1992. Owens witnessed both sides of black urban life in the USA while growing up. After a brief stint as a Burger King employee, she soon found herself making waves in the hip-hop music scene.\n\nAfter working as the human beatbox alongside Ladies Fresh, she was just 18 years old when she broke through in the late 1980s with a style that picked selectively from jazz, reggae, and soul traditions, from beats produced by D.J. Mark the 45 King. Her debut single, \"Wrath of My Madness,\" was released in 1988. A year later, her debut long-player, \"All Hail the Queen,\" enjoyed favored reviews: an old, wise head was evident on the top of her young shoulders. The former Burger King employee maintained her early commitment to answering the misogynist armory of some of her male counterparts and, at the same time, imparted musical good times to all genders. Her name means \"delicate and sensitive\" in Arabic, but she has often been anything but in her rhymes and the messages she sends out through them. One of the most prominent female hip-hop artists on the scene for over a decade, Queen Latifah has also made tremendous inroads in movies, television, and artist management, with her management company, Flavor Unit, alongside her business partner Shakim Compere. A role model who takes the responsibility to heart, Latifah has carefully constructed a fine career for herself-one that is constantly moving upward.\n\nGeorge Lopez was born on April 23, 1961, in Mission Hills, Los Angeles, California, the son of Frieda and Anatasio Lopez, a migrant worker.

Lopez attended San Fernando High School, graduating in 1979. He is known for starring in his self-produced ABC sitcom George Lopez. His stand-up comedy examines race and ethnic relations, including Mexican American culture. Lopez has received several honors for his work and contributions to the Latino community, including the 2003 Imagen Vision Award, the 2003 Latino Spirit Award for Excellence in Television and the National Hispanic Media Coalition Impact Award. He was also named one of \"The Top 25 Hispanics in America\" by Time magazine in 2005. In 1993, Lopez married Ann Serrano. The couple has a daughter, Mayan, born in 1996. On September 27, 2010, Lopez announced that he and his wife had decided to end their marriage. Serrano filed for divorce on November 23, 2010, citing \"irreconcilable differences. The divorce was finalized on July 1, 2011.\n\nAli Cobrin is an American actress.

Although she continued in the visual arts, she also had a growing passion for the movies and theatre and secretly wanted to become an actor.\n\nNot knowing how to pursue the profession, she was fortunate to be introduced to contemporary theatre in college and learned that acting classes were being offered. But she was hesitant to sign on - not sure if this was the right course to take in life.\n\nWhile she was still in college, her father passed away, leaving her with the message that she must do everything she wants to do in this life. Taking his advice, Rhea signed up for the acting classes and has never looked back.\n\nHer film credits include roles in the independent features Riders (2001) and Floating (1997), and the independent shorts The Pitch (1999), The Gentleman (2000) and A Case Against Karen (1998).
