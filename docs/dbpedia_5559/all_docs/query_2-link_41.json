BBI employs a team of second and third year law students during the general academic year. These Law Research Assistants (Law RAs) work closely with BBI’s legal research team in examining the latest developments in disability law and policy, and extensively writing on these developments for a variety of BBI projects and target audiences. The RAs also work with diverse BBI social scientists to gather relevant research that informs grant proposals and deliverables. Law RAs receive regular guidance for improving their legal research and writing skills, and have gone on to work in private practice, public interest law, and law and policy research. During the summer, BBI typically employs two or three Law RAs for more time intense work weeks. In fifteen years, BBI has provided over 340 internships and assistantships.
