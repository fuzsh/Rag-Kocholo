        "text": "Larry Hankin graduated as an industrial designer from Syracuse University, moved to Greenwich Village with his College Buddy, Carl Gottlieb (who would later write the movie \"Jaws\", among others). Once there, Larry started doing stand-up in coffeehouses, and was soon opening for Woody Allen and Miles Davis. He then joined Second City in Chicago, bolted from there to San Francisco with 6 other Second City Runaways. They started \"The Committee\", a rival improv group.\n\nFrom there, Larry drifted down to Los Angeles, slept on couches for a few months and, when Penny Marshal needed a tall guy to do a comic dance with on \"Laverne and Shirley\", remembered seeing Larry in \"The Committee\", invited him on, which got him an agent, and, \"I officially became a working actor in Hollywood.\"\n\nAfter co-starring in \"Escape from Alcatraz\", Larry took the money and, on a dare from Anna Mathias to write a film short for himself to direct, play the lead, and produce with a cinematographer she knew who needed \"a reel\": Harry Mathias, coincidently, her husband. Larry & Harry's short, \"Solly's Diner\", was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nThough Larry has appeared in over 50 films and guest-starred on over 100 TV Shows from \"Friends\" and \"Seinfeld\" (\"Mr. Heckles\" and \"The Guy Who Stole The Raisins\"), to \"CSI\", \"Breaking Bad\", Bill Hader's HBO series, \"Barry\", & a soon-to-be released feature film, Larry continues to explore the craft of writing: through sardonic fables, political satire, in his stage show; in a series of film shorts (\"The Outlaw Emmett Deemus\" tryptic on www.indieflix.com), and in his new \"The Rants of Barnum Justice\": 2 to 5 minute filmed rants & opinions by Barnum (Hankin), either championing \"The Upside of Dumpsters, or Survival Tricks for Urban Survivalists\"; openly lamenting his love life; what one should wear when one is homeless and panhandling, or it's just all going to hell in a handbag. In his new book of short & a little longer stories, fables, doggerel \"pomes\", a dossier, an oral history, several rants, lovelorn laments, & a Haiku, Hankin's nonsense starts to make sense."
