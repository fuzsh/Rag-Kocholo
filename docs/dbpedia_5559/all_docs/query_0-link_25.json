He was 83. While I never worked with Dow at Newhouse, he had a sterling reputation in broadcast circles as a newsroom leader, dedicated educator and as the author of a definitive textbook on producing TV news. I used and assigned his outstanding textbook, Power Producer, at both the University of Maryland and Arizona State University. His career as a producer, news director and TV station general manager included tenures in multiple markets around the country under multiple ownerships before joining the Newhouse School in 1995.\n\nAssociate professor and former associate dean Dona Hayes describes Dow as a “fountain of broadcast journalism knowledge” who knew everyone in the business. In particular, Dow loved teaching news producing and spread his enthusiasm for behind-the-camera work to the scores of students he trained at Newhouse. A U.S. Navy veteran, Dow also served as director of the Military and Visual Journalism program.\n\nRecalls Dona: “Dow was also a special colleague because he cared about people. He and I shared artistic sons whom we often kibitzed about. He adored all of his children, grandchildren, his wife, Bonnie, the Sears catalogue house they settled in near Albany and fast British cars.”\n\nDow retired from the Newhouse School in 2008 but left a lasting impression with the many students he mentored who went on to successful careers as broadcast journalists and news leaders. Here is part of a touching tribute from Kyle Grimes ’99, vice president for New England of Hearst Television and president and general manager of WCVB-TV in Boston:\n\n“Dow was inimitable. Larger than life in stature and spirit. He developed the newscast producer program at Newhouse and added to the rich legacy of the school by creating yet one more attribute that differentiated Newhouse from its peers.”\n\nA private memorial service is planned for this summer. In lieu of flowers, the family has asked in his obituary for donations to be made to the Committee to Protect Journalists. On behalf of the Newhouse community, I want to extend our sincerest condolences to Dow’s family and friends.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMark\n\nNewhouse Faculty Honored by University for Teaching Excellence\n\nSyracuse University recognized five Newhouse faculty members this spring with the following honors. We are immensely proud of their achievements, work and dedication to helping Newhouse students succeed.\n\nAward for Outstanding Contributions to the Student Experience and University Initiatives\n\nCharisse L’Pree Corsbie-Massay\n\nAssociate Professor, Communications\n\nThis Chancellor’s Citation for Excellence award is given to University faculty and staff who, through their work, have enhanced the undergraduate experience for students or made invaluable contributions to supporting and advancing the University’s mission and goals.\n\nThe Laura J. and L. Douglas Meredith Teaching Recognition Award for Early Performance\n\nKelly Leahy\n\nAssistant Professor, Television Radio and Film\n\nMilton Santiago\n\nAssistant Professor, Visual Communications\n\nThe Teaching Recognition Award program recognize excellence in teaching among untenured faculty.

The program recognizes those faculty and students:\n\nWho have (i) “made an outstanding contribution to the beauty of the world, who have added to human values, and to ending human abuse,”\n\nWho have (ii) passion for excellence, creativity, and originality in academic or artistic fields, and\n\nWho demonstrate the (iii) “ability to motivate and bring out the best in others.”\n\nExcellence in Graduate Education Faculty Recognition Award\n\nSoo Yeon Hong\n\nAssociate Teaching Professor, Public Relations\n\nGraduate Program Director, Public Relations\n\nThis award from the Graduate School honors faculty who have a significant, positive influence on graduate education through their commitment to superior graduate teaching, dedication to departmental and community presence and research initiatives.\n\n2024 Newhouse Community Awards\n\nThe Newhouse School recognized the work, scholarship, service and achievements of faculty and staff at the Newhouse Community Awards. The event took place April 5 in the Joyce Hergenhan Auditorium, concluding a week of faculty and staff appreciation celebrations.\n\nNewhouse Community Awards\n\nDEIA Award\n\nSeth Gitner\n\nTeresa Sullivan\n\nDistinguished Service Award\n\nRobin Howard\n\nTula Goenka\n\nKeystone Award\n\nThe Keystone Award honors one Newhouse staff member who has demonstrated outstanding performance supporting a department, program or individual(s).\n\nKristen Northrop\n\nPositive Impact Award\n\nShawna Lawrence\n\nHidden Gem Award\n\nThe Hidden Gem Award honors a Newhouse staff member who is known for their commitment, reliability and consistent hard work “behind the scenes,” which enables their colleagues, the school and/or the university to shine.\n\nKaren Baum\n\nStaff Member of the Year Award\n\nJennifer Weekes-Osada\n\nRising Star Award\n\nThe Rising Star Award recognizes the initiative, self-starter attitude, enthusiasm, energy and creativity of a staff member.\n\nMeg Craig\n\nTeaching Excellence Awards (three categories)\n\nAdjunct Teaching\n\nRandy Wenner\n\nOngoing Performance\n\nHarriet Brown\n\nEarly Performance\n\nNausheen Husain\n\nCreative Achievement Award\n\nShaina Holmes\n\nNewhouse Impact Award\n\nNicholas Bowman\n\nLiterary Achievement Award\n\nRC Concepcion\n\nKeith Giglio\n\nSeth Gitner\n\nShaina Holmes\n\nRegina Luttrell\n\nNewhouse Professor Harriet Brown Selected as 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Scholar\n\nHarriet Brown, a professor of magazine, news and digital journalism (MND) at the Newhouse School, has been chosen as a 2024-2025 Fulbright U.S. Scholar. She will take her Fulbright semester in Israel during spring 2025.\n\nBrown’s Fulbright award is a combination teaching and research grant. During her time in Israel, she will teach a class at the University of Haifa and report on an ongoing project with photographer Lynn Johnson that looks at families who use cannabis to help their medically fragile children. Syracuse University Press has tentatively agreed to publish a book based on the reporting, Brown said.\n\nBrown cited one of the reasons she applied for the competitive fellowship was, that even before the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, “it was becoming less and less politically acceptable to be a Jewish American academic with connections to Israel. This is even more true now. I hope to build some bridges between Israeli and American academics and journalists.”\n\nThe prestigious Fulbright Scholar Awards allow recipients to teach and lead research abroad, while also helping to play an essential role in U.S. public diplomacy by forming long-term relationships between people and countries.\n\nIn announcing the award, the Fulbright program said they hope Syracuse University can use Brown’s engagement in Israel to establish research and relationships, interact with University alumni and more.\n\nBrown, also the MND graduate program director at Newhouse, has more than 30 years of experience as both a writer and editor for many national magazines, including The New York Times Magazine, O Magazine, Vogue, Psychology Today, Prevention and Parenting.\n\nIn 2011, she was awarded the John F. Murray Award for Strategic Communication for the Public Good by the University of Iowa Journalism School.\n\nBrown has written several books, including “Shadow Daughter: A Memoir of Estrangement,” “Brave Girl Eating: A Family’s Struggle with Anorexia” and “Body of Truth: How Science, History, and Culture Drive Our Obsession with Weight—and What We Can Do About It.”\n\nAward-Winning Journalist Holliday Moore Named News Director of WAER\n\nWAER has named award-winning reporter, anchor and journalism instructor Holliday Moore as the public radio station’s next news and public affairs director. She is scheduled to start in mid-April.\n\nMoore arrives in Syracuse after working in the Phoenix, Arizona, market, where her extensive experience includes tenures as a Morning Edition reporter for KJZZ-FM, the local NPR affiliate; producing, anchoring and reporting for KTAR News Radio; and serving as a political and senior reporter for KNXV-TV.\n\nHer distinguished résumé includes two Emmy Awards, three Edward R. Murrow Awards and a Walter Cronkite Political Excellence Award. She also worked for nine years as a journalism instructor at Arizona State University’s Cronkite School of Journalism.\n\nAt WAER, Moore will lead the station’s professional staff and oversee the mission of developing Newhouse School students aspiring to be broadcasters and journalists.\n\nMoore’s classroom experience gives her insight into ways to help students learn and grow, while producing content that can meet the professional standards of NPR and WAER, said station general manager Chris Bolt.\n\nPrevious stops for Moore include newsrooms in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Washington, D.C. A graduate of Arizona State with a bachelor’s degree in broadcast journalism and marketing and management, Moore also owns and operates a news media consulting business for regional news stations, businesses and nonprofits.\n\nAbout WAER"
