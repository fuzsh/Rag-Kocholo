My new compositions include ‘Slogan,’ an exploration of the meanings behind political catchphrases for narrators and an ensemble of instruments, of which you can hear a version at https://soundcloud.com/davidhahn/slogan , and ‘Dorchester Sunset,’ a new piece written for Concert Imaginaire, which will premiere in our 2017–18 season. I have also published sheet music versions of my recent ‘Chippewa Songs’ for soprano & guitar and ‘Start Spreadin’ the News,’ a solo guitar arrangement of the song ‘New York, New York.’ As a solo guitarist, I have been volunteering in the healing music department of the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. This involves performing soothing music in various patient waiting areas to help cut stress and create a more relaxed atmosphere.”\n\nFrom the May/June 2017 Issue\n\nOn Feb. 21, James Franco’s film of David Shields’s book I Think You’re Totally Wrong: A Quarrel was released, and Shields’s 20th book, Other People: Takes & Mistakes, was recently published by Knopf.\n\nFrom the March/April 2017 Issue\n\nPaul Ayoub and his daughter, Lizzie, launched their book, Inspire Me!

She was already travelling east to see her daughter Maya Sandler ’13, who is attending Yale in the history of medicine program at the school of medicine (David Mantell has a daughter at the Yale drama school, and Dave introduced them) and her son Jesse, who has just begun at Wesleyan. In recent months Abby has been in touch with Michael Gevelber, who recently traveled to Smith to see his daughter Eliana. This communication occurred because he wanted to learn some tips about making his late mother’s “sacher pusserl” cookies which she baked and sent to him at Brown (and for which Abby had immediately snagged the recipe, realizing how amazing they were). Abby has also been in touch with former senior suitemate Gleen “Missy” Towne, who is living in New Hampshire; Andres V. Maricq, who lives in Salt Lake City; and Alan Mills and Karen Zaccor, who live in Chicago.

Lichtenstein is a former ABC News investigative producer and president of the independent media production company Lichtenstein Creative Media. His work focusing on mental health followed his own diagnosis and recovery from bipolar disorder in 1986. Most recently, Lichtenstein’s reporting exposed the widespread use and harm caused by physical restraints and seclusion rooms in schools across the country with children as young as three years old. Lichtenstein first learned about the practice when he discovered that his own five-year-old daughter had been locked in an isolation room almost daily for up to an hour at a time over a three-month period in a Lexington, Mass., public kindergarten. His article in the New York Times in 2012 exposed and sparked a national debate about these practices.
