        "text": "Brooke Bundy [Interview]\n\nMay 14, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nHello there dear readers! We are back with another exciting interview, this time somewhat going back to the well of amazing folks involved with one of our most prized genres….the world of horror. Yes, die hard horror fans will automatically connect the great Brooke Bundy to some of the most fascinating chapters of the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. She was of course Elaine Parker from the Dream Masters inclusion of the series. The ones I enjoyed the most, if not only for the much needed inclusion of the band Dokken and Tuesday Knight.\n\nBut, Brooke Bundy has been a staple of the silver screen, television, and the theatre for over 50 years, and has been on just about every TV show you can shake a digital stick at. Including other projects that we have regularly featured here at Trainwreck’d Society like the gem of a Soap Opera, General Hospital, right around to Star Trek: Next Generation. Throw in some appearances on classic shows like The Brady Bunch, The Mod Squad, Charlie’s Angels, Lassie, and on and on, she is a freaking American treasure! And we are so excited to have gotten a few nice words from her to share with you all today. So ladies and gentlemen, please enjoy some words from the legendary actress, Brooke Bundy!\n\nWhen did you decide that you wanted to join the world of acting? What initially drew you to this world?\n\nI never wanted to be an actress. I was modeling in NYC and went to a school for young professionals, my class mate was Christopher Walken who suggested I audition for a Broadway Play he was in and I did and I got it.\n\nWhat was it like the first time you saw your name appear in the credits of a project you worked on? Do you remember what you were doing at that time, and how it made you feel?\n\nGreat question I have the same feeling every time, it’s very out of body and I look at it and think this was serious this was real.\n\nYour involvement in the legendary A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise with Dream Warriors and The Dream Master, was an absolute highlight of the series for sure. How was your experience working on such a legendary film series. What was the set life like on such frightening tales?\n\nI had always turned down horror scripts, I didn’t want someone sitting in a dark theater to think “hey that looks like a good idea” and do something awful. But my wonderful agent talked me into it and it’s the gift that keeps giving. The set was great I think that starts from the top and Robert Englund is the consummate pro, a gentleman and a cool dude.\n\nBeyond just the Nightmare series, you have done an extensive amount of work in the world of television, appearing on just about every major TV show there was, regardless of genre, for a very long period of time. What was it about the world of television that made you enjoy working in it?\n\n$\n\nAccording to IMDb, you added the title of “associate producer” to your resume with the 2006 film Amber Benson project, Lovers, Liars and Lunatics, which I have not seen but am very interested in. How did you find yourself involved with this project? What drew you to it?\n\nTuesday Knight discovered Amber and I was a young actors’ agent and Tuesday sent her to me, I fell in love with her such an amazing actress booked her on a lot of projects and she generously gave me screen credit.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to tell our readers about?\n\nOpportunities to meet fans and I do private coaching.\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nI like to think of smiling as a cause not an effect. Smile all the time.\n\nToddy Walters [Interview]\n\nApril 18, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nHello Dear TWS Readers! Today we have an absolutely amazing interview to share with you fine folks. Today we have some amazing words from an absolutely brilliant vocalist, actress, and so much more, the amazing Toddy Walters. Right off the bat, if you are a fan of any of the work from the now legendary pop culture icons that are Trey Parker and Matt Stone…..you are going to want to check this out!\n\nOn August 17th, 1997, I was a 12 year old boy. I was a massive fan of the barely watched cable channel known as Comedy Central. I was one of those kids who had a “divorced Dad doing better than the Mom he lived with”, and when I was staying with Dad, I watched the shit out of Comedy Central. I watched The Daily Show with Craig Kilborne on a regular basis. I loved Bob & Margaret, Make Me Laugh, and the endless re-showings of Blazing Saddles. And I remember seeing the constant advertisements for a weirdly animated show called South Park that was coming soon. And on August 17th, I managed to find myself at my “cool aunt’s” apartment in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and falling in love with the program that we all know and love and now consider to be a bit revolutionary, a little show called South Park.\n\nWhat does this have to do with our guest today? Well, she was there. Toddy was around in the very beginning, and she was invested in in the amazing beginning years of South Park. She speaks of this a bit in the amazing responses she passed along, so I will take a social cue here and just shut the fuck up right about now. So, enjoy some amazingly insightful and amazing words from the great Toddy Walters!\n\nWhen did you first discover your passion for the world of music and performance? Was it a lifelong passion of yours, or did you sort of just fall into the business?\n\nI was born an artist, and the music and television of the 1970’s really shaped me. It gave me the drive to want to definitely be a Charlie’s Angel but the musical Annie sold me on wanting to sing in front of people. Singing has always come very naturally to me, I have a melody of some kind in my head pretty literally all the time, which is a boon and a bane;) I’ve spent all of my life singing and performing in one capacity or another.\n\nYou began working with the now legendary duo of Trey Parker and Matt Stone from their initial inception, with their Troma release Cannibal: The Musical, right up through to the inception of South Park. What were those early days like? Was it strange to be involved with so much success, so quickly alongside a couple of dudes you knew from college?\n\nThose days were crazy, life-changing and interesting. I found out about what was then called ‘Alferd Packer – The Musical’ when I went to a CU Boulder film school screening of student films, one of which was Alferd Packer. The short film was a trailer for a film (with no actual finished product) which was such a creative idea to begin with but more than that was the buzz created by this funny little trailer. The buzz was everyone wondering if it was actually a film and I decided at that point that if they were going to make a film, I was going to get myself in that film, not even knowing the story of if there were any parts for women. I had already been in a couple student films there so I wrangled an audition and the rest is cinematic history, lol.\n\nNot long after, I was pretty helplessly in love with Trey and we were together for a few years when he moved to LA. I witnessed the meteoric rise of South Park first hand in a lot of ways just being around the two of them. I moved to LA a couple years later still in a long-distance relationship with Trey but the quick and huge success complicated things unsurprisingly and it was no longer healthy. It was hard for us to let go, but it was harder to sustain a relationship amidst all the chaos.\n\nWhat I am grateful for is the work I was able to do with them which allowed me to get some exposure as an actor. However, within two years of moving to LA, I decided that I wanted to concentrate on music and that’s what I did.\n\nAmongst the plethora of vocal and musical work you did on the South Park series and film, what would you say is your personal favorite character that you brought to life?\n\nI had a blast playing Kelly – Kenny’s girlfriend in the episode ‘Rainforest Shmainforest’ starring Jennifer Aniston. Kelly was the perfect nose-picking drama queen that Kenny needed, and even if it was short lived, it was true love.\n\nMy other fave was playing Winona Ryder in the movie, it was such a blast. It was fun to hear my voice when I saw the film, felt really good. I have to say I’m pretty proud that in the credits of that film, my name comes sandwiched between Nick Rhodes and Stewart Copeland which is just cool.\n\nBesides being a brilliant vocalists and actor, I understand you have worked extensively in the world of production, including some post work on one of my favorite films of all time, The Thin Red Line. What was it like to work on a project like this? And what sort of other production work have you done in the business?\n\nI started as a production office coordinator on the South Park movie which led to other production office gigs on animated film and the odd production assistant or wardrobe assistant gig on live action features. I spent a few weeks on the a computer game based on The Matrix 2 & 3 as a wardrobe assistant. This was when motion capture was new and I assembled hundreds of these little rubber balls covered in reflective tape that were then put on all the joints on these black leotards that the Korean martial arts team wore. I was a stunt double for tests a few times and had to put a leotard on and jump around, that was fun. They were also shooting 2nd unit for both films in the studio so I got to watch Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishbourne work out.\n\nMy last production job was on The Thin Red Line where I was a production assistant, a wardrobe assistant and a stand in for the lead actress. There were so many amazing people associated with that film obviously and it was so fun to be a part of. Word got around that I was an actress and Terrence Malick hired me to be a featured extra in a scene that was eventually cut (but I heard I’m in the perhaps fictitious ‘director’s cut’). I thought, you couldn’t just keep my 10 second close up in your 3.5 hour movie, lol? I did get to be in front of cinematographer John Toll who reminded me not to chicken neck when trying to convey emotion, lesson learned.\n\nWhat can you tell us about your band, Winehouse? I understand it is definitely NOT a “cover band”, but what it is sounds fascinating to me! So with that, could you explain a bit about it to us? And what made you decide to channel the spirit of Amy?\n\nYes, very adamant about it being a tribute band, always correcting people! I would rather she still be alive and I wouldn’t have had to create the project but it felt like the right time and her songs are so fun to sing, not to mention she was an hysterically funny creature. I took it in a theatrical direction by playing her in earnest, I took on her accent, dressed like her, the whole nine. It married my two favorite things, singing and acting. When we first started, we would recreate her live shows at the height of her fame (2007-2008) as close as possible, setlists, line up, her banter. But it morphed into more of a stage show where I scripted it, the concept was that Amy was now in heaven and so she was able to talk about what it’s like up there, the famous celebs she hangs out with also in the 27 club, so it focuses on the humor mostly with just a little bit of heartbreak when she asks god why she had to suffer. I’ve put the wig down for the foreseeable future as it was a five year labor of love and because I feel like I realized the vision I had for the project and am ready to move on.\n\nI’ve always thought that Denver would be a pretty good town for music, but I honestly have no idea as my experience in Colorado altogether is that of one overnight stay at an airport hotel, and walk through that crazy expensive mall. So, what is the music and arts community like around there? What do you believe sets this area apart from say, an Austin or Portland?\n\nDenver has been booming for a few years now and so has the music scene. The most recent success story is of course, Nathaniel Rateliff. When I began making music here in Denver in the early 90s, the music scene was cool but jam band heavy so I was excited to move to LA where there would be more diversity. Now the art / music scene is infused with so many talented native and non-Colorado natives and it’s hopping with a lot of different styles and scenes. I’d say it’s different to Austin in that it’s not as much of an ‘industry’ town since it’s not known for its record labels and has very few management companies. It’s harder to break out here, but I imagine most musicians here are happy to make it a valid part of their lives even if they don’t make a living with it. As a forever unsigned artist, I don’t necessarily believe being signed equates with making superior music.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to plug to our readers?\n\nI’m happy to say I have a film to plug, although at this point, there is no secure distribution. It was filmed in the summer of 2016 and is called Stadium Anthems, directed by a first-time CO based writer-director, Scott Douglas Brown. It’s a sort of surrealistic, absurdist, dramedy, mockumentary set in Denver and is about the music industry and how it’s changed so much in the last however many years. My character is Heroine Jones, the female singer-songwriter-teacher-bartender-fetish performer (what doesn’t she do?) who is the heart of the film and represents doing art for art’s sake while all around her the chaotic and laughable record label types vie to stay relevant in the post-internet age.\n\nIt was an amazing step back into the film world and I was able to not only act, but sing, write songs and be the music supervisor. All in all, twenty-something pieces of music were recorded for the film, some of which were mine and some of which were Scott’s. The film has been finalized and is just now beginning the search for distribution.\n\nOtherwise, I’d love to make a new record someday!\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nWhen my boyfriend bought me the live vinyl of Kate Bush’s ‘Before the Dawn’ for Christmas two years ago which is her first live set of performances in thirty five years. I cried virtually through the entire four-record set I was so happy. That’s not to say I haven’t smiled since, of course:)\n\nNiousha Noor [Interview]\n\nApril 16, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nLately, I have been hearing a lot of buzz about a program on the beloved Home Box Office (HBO, if we are to go shorthand) entitled Here and Now. And the word on the digital streets is that actress Niousha Noor is one of the biggest highlights of the series to lookout for. So it goes without saying, we are extremely happy to be able to share a few words from this amazing actress that is currently excelling brilliantly in Alan Ball’s latest project that has been getting some excellent reviews as of later.\n\nAnd as it usually tends to be when we finally attempt to do something new here at TWS, we are IN LOVE! Niousha Noor has turned out to be an extremely brilliant, funny, and far too kind human being. She was nice enough to share a few words with us about Here and Now, her viral video that is #PERSIANIZE, and so much more in this incredible interview that I am to so happy to share with you fine underserving readers! Niousha has turned out to be a perfect fit for TWS. She has checked off so many boxes that make her a brilliant fit for our digital pages. She is a strong independent woman, she’s killing it on a series with a strong message, and she has worked in our beloved world of horror/comedy. Hell, should Niousha find her way into the Fallout video game world, we might have to make her Mayor!\n\nSo with that, let me stop babbling and share some pretty amazing words form the brilliant Niousha Noor! Enjoy!\n\nWhen did you first discover you had a passion for the arts? Did you grow up dreaming about performance, or did you just sort of find your way into this world?\n\nAs a kid in Iran I was always involved in the world of cinema as my dad is a cinematographer. I found myself often on movie sets. Movies and arts were a big part of my childhood, but I didn’t really think about myself as an actor until later on in life.\n\nI have heard great things about Alan Ball’s HBO series Here and Now, in which you play Donya, a crucial character in the mystery of the show. What drew you to this project? What did you then, and now, find most intriguing about the concept?\n\nWhat drew me to the project was the sides I had to audition for! The role specifically wanted an Iranian women speaking Farsi. It seemed to be about a mother in search of something… in the 1970s….. There is not many roles for “Iranians” to begin with but have it be in this form shrouded in such mystery was very intriguing.\n\nWhat do you believe to be the most important thing that viewers should take away from Here and Now, on a social commentary level? And specifically, your character’s involvement in that commentary?\n\nI think just looking at the cast you’ll immediately notice that it’s a show about diversity and identity. About how we deal with that diversity not only as a tight-knit family but on a larger scale as a society and what we identify with as individuals. In a sense asking the question of who are we in the here and now? And diversity not only in terms of race and ethnicity, but also sexuality, politics, class and age. My character as part of Farid’s backstory helps him come to terms with his past and helps him find who he is.\n\nNow, we here at Trainwreck’d Society are very big fans of the world of horror, especially horror of the more campy variety. Scrolling through your IMDb credits, I noticed a film that I have yet to see, but feel that by title alone, I would at least be a bit intrigued. it is called Oh Snap! I’m Trapped in the House with a Crazy Lunatic Serial Killer. I mean, the title pretty much spells it out, but, would you care to elaborate on this project a bit? What was it like to work in the world of horror on a project like this?\n\nOh wow! Ha! I have to say, I had so much fun shooting that film! There were so many of us all staying at the same house we were shooting in! Well I, (spoiler alert), did shoot my very first death scene in that movie, and I was killed by an axe! So….that was indeed horrific and fun to shoot!\n\nI am very intrigued by a project you did, and currently working on a follow up for, entitled #PERSIANIZE. Can you tell us a bit about this? What inspired you to create this project?\n\nYes!! Ok so…\n\nI love to dance, especially to persian music of the 80’s. These songs are so nostalgic for me as I grew up dancing to them in Iran. I thought of this concept of an Iranian woman crashing a dance class in Hollywood, pretending to be their substitute teacher and basically teaching them Persian dance instead. I was able to get such a cool group of real dancers for the shoot and the result was not only so much fun, but beautiful. These songs pull the strings of most Iranian hearts as we all have so many memories with them, so to see Americans dancing Iranian and so beautifully too, I don’t know, it was touching. The video went viral mainly in the Iranian community so I believe they agreed! I’m just ready to have a different conversation about Iran! Persianize to me is about bringing forth the fun, beautiful aspects of my culture to those who don’t know it! I’m in the process of making the second video due to the high demand, so look out for it on my page!\n\nIf you were given the chance to portray any legendary figure (historical, or not) in Iranian history, who would it be?\n\nWhat a great question. I would have to say Gordafarid. She is one of the heroines in the Shahnameh–Book of Kings-which is this epic literary masterpiece written by Ferdowsi centuries before Game of Thrones! Gordafarid is a female heroine, a champion. A woman who volunteers to fight against the commander of the other rival group, and she wins. She is a symbol of courage and bravery for Iranian women -or just women in general. It would be an incredible journey to play her– even if not— I would be delighted to be a part of a project that just tells the stories of Shahnameh because they are magnificent.\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to plug to our readers?\n\nWell there will be more of a reveal to my character Donya in the final episodes of Here And Now. Also definitely look out for the second NuNu #Persianize video! I am also in the middle of finishing my first feature–I am really enjoying the process of creating and telling stories!\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nThis question did 🙂\n\nBut before this, I recently booked a trip to Europe. Once I saw the ‘Congratulations, your trip is booked!’ confirmation, I had a really big grin on my face. I love to travel.\n\nLin Tucci [Interview]\n\nApril 9, 2018 by rontrembathiii\n\nWhen did you decide you wanted to join the world of acting? Was it something you sort of fell into, or has it been a passion brewing within you for quite some time?\n\nMy passion for acting came first at an early age. I grew up in a very colorful Italian community where my uncles owned a produce market. The cast of characters were a revolving door of entrances & exits akin to a “commedia dell ‘arte”.\n\nI loved listening and watching their every move, and having a captive audience. That’s when I began impersonating them. Having a captive audience, the customers laughed seeing me imitate the priest whose sing song sermons had a message and moral to each story then the punch line, the girl scout leader who had a huge beehive, reciting the girl scout rules with a cigarette in her mouth and a lisp that came from her lips between each puff, the “bookie”, “who was all of 5’4” arriving with “the numbers” in his hand. His swagger ruled the roost.\n\nIt was then that I was bitten and I never turned back! Learning the craft became my focus. First in junior college, then continuing to Boston Conservatory of Music, graduating with a B.F.A . Drama Major/ Musical Theater Minor.\n\nThen the world of acting opened wide.\n\nYou were without a doubt the highlight character for me in the 1995 film Showgirls, appearing as Henrietta “Mama” Bazoom, which also featured past TWS guests like Robert Davi and Rena Riffel. You were absolutely hilarious! So what was it like to work on a project like this? Was it an enjoyable shoot?\n\nShowgirls was my first feature film. MGM, Paul Verhoeven and Joe Esterhas were enough for me to sign on. From the first day on set to the premiere, the journey was an adventure of a lifetime. The Henrietta “Mama” Bazoom character on paper was a pisser! She was “large and in charge”, at least at the Cheetah Club. Henrietta’s “bazoom’s” were originally scripted to be revealed as a computer generated move, like Jessica Rabbit. When the contract was ready to be signed the deal was “au naturel” or nothing. I thought, “Well, as Elvis said, ‘it’s now or never’.”\n\nSomewhere in one of the Planet Hollywoods is a dress of Henrietta’s displayed in infamy!\n\nTWS guest Robert Davi and Rena Riffel were all part of the Cheetah Club clan. Robert gave the grit. Rena was the temptress of titillation. Rena & I had a blast when we were asked to put our handprints at the Vista Theater in LA as an homage to Showgirls!\n\nElizabeth Berkley was “lightning in a bottle”. I love that woman. She was brave beyond imagination. Nomi was the only one who could get Henrietta’s Ta-Ta”s to HA HA !\n\nShowgirls has proven to be timeless.. over 20 yrs later it is regarded as a cult classic and I LOVE THAT !!!\n\nMore recently, you appeared on the hit of a show known as Orange Is The New Black. What was it like to be a part of a program like this from the beginning only to watch it blossom into the massive hit that it is ?\n\nThe Orange Is The New Black tagline is “every sentence has a story”. I never would have imagined the epic story I could tell after being in 44 episodes and I am so honored to have received two SAG Awards. Jenji Kohan, the show runner, is our “fearless leader” and she is without a doubt a genius. Jenji cast the pilot with the majority of actors who sat together at Kaufman Studios Day 1 on set, not knowing the “arc” of their character or how many episodes they would be in. The playing field was level. Series regulars like Kate Mulgrew had star power. Even then I remember sitting next to her in the hair department. Wig’s coming in and out. “Red” had not been imagined…yet. Everything was raw and awesome in every aspect. I had never worked on a TV series, so the learning curve for me was an everyday event. In Piper Kerman’s book, Anita DeMarco was based on a real person Piper knew in prison. When I read for the role, I felt I immediately knew Anita . I became her the moment I put on my khakis and was set behind bars. I knew where Anita lived in her mind. The writing on the show is FLAWLESS! Piper Kerman gave me the greatest compliment when I first met her, she said, “Lin”, you are Anita!\n\nWhen the show’s critical acclaim increased after Season 1, I knew we’d be “riding a rainbow”. The show was a hit. Now indeed it is a massive hit and I’m still in shock that I’ve been a part of it. OITNB will go down in history as a Netflix phenomenon whose voice will resonate forever.\n\nI have to admit that I am very naïve and sadly unaware about something called, Nunsense? I notice that in your credits that you have appeared in a couple of these productions? I am definitely very curious, and would love it if you wouldn’t mind telling us a bit about this production?\n\nMy first national tour in the USA was Nunsense. My character was Sister Robert Anne, a streetwise nun from Canarsie, Brooklyn. Nunsense is a 5-character musical. Robert Anne’s character was exactly like a nun I had in school, Sister Dora. My resume reflects many productions of the show because I absolutely LOVED LOVED LOVED singing & dancing as Robert. Little known fact: when I was cast in both Showgirls and OITNB, I had been doing Nunsense.\n\nI went from being a “saint to a sinner” then a saint to a “prisoner”! Robert is a wise cracking “bob & weave” kind of gal. Talks to her students in the language they can connect to. Each character in the show reveals in their back story what their dreams were if they did not have ‘the calling”. Robert sings a song “I Just Want To Be A STAR”…’nuff said! I was lucky to be in productions with the late great Phyllis Diller and Dody Goodman and Laugh-In’s wild & wonderful Jo Anne Worley.\n\nNunsense legacy lives on… AMEN!!\n\nI am always intrigued and impressed by anyone in the acting world who has moved freely between film, television, and the stage, as you have done. And I always like to ask: If you were forced to only work in one of the mediums, whatwould it be? Why?\n\nTELEVISION !! I love everything about it ! The pace and craft is a master class of thinking on your feet. I love creating the character at home, delving into the intention the writer has written in each scene for the character, learning the lines, arriving on set ready to meet the director for the day’s shoot.. In TV, a plethora of “mega-mind’s” constantly surround you. Each bringing their own style and vision.\n\nEvery episode has the footprint of the writer and director. I had the privilege of being directed by Jodie Foster on OITNB, yup ,TV….Acted & directed with Laura Prepon in the same episode on OITNB yup, TV ..Danced with RuPaul in the B’52 “Love Shack” video yup, TV ! Working with actors who move freely in all genres raises the bar when on a TV set. We share the pulse of timing in televison bringing the skills of a theater foundation. When I hear the word “ACTION” I get an adrenaline rush which is exhilarating. BRING IT !!!\n\nWhat does the future hold for you? Anything you would like to plug to our readers?\n\nI have signed on for an indie film called Megaball$, a comedy feature . It’s about geeks, the Lotto & mob. The tagline is: You never know when you’re number is up ! My character is spicey! That’s all I can say!\n\nThe Chiller Theatre Expo asked me to do an autograph meet & greet April 27 – 29. It is in Parsippany New Jersey. Come on down if your in the hood, would love to meet you. If the spirit moves you, join me on Twitter, @lintucci, and check out my FB page, Lin Tucci, for some fun behind the scenes OITNB photos and magical red carpet moments.\n\nWhat was the last thing that made you smile?\n\nRon, I am smiling now ! Your questions reminded me of so many memories. Thank you for reaching out. Phyllis Diller once said ” a smile is a frown turned upside down”."
