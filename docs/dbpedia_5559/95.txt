As a writer, director, and comic actor, Carl Gottlieb has enjoyed success in a wide range of roles, most notably for his writing on such classic films as "Jaws" and "The Jerk." He studied drama at Syracuse University before heading to San Francisco and entering the comedy fray with improv troupe the Committee. After a couple of minor TV appearances, he began writing for "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour" in 1968, earning an Emmy for his contribution. He played a supporting part in the renowned Robert Altman war comedy "M*A*S*H," before joining the cast of the game-changing blockbuster "Jaws," initially called upon just to play the newspaper editor but subsequently tapped by Spielberg to rewrite the script in order to bring more depth and humor to the characters. After the troubled production process of that film, Gottlieb wrote a book detailing the experience, "The Jaws Log." Amidst other acting and writing projects, he joined forces with Steve Martin, sharing writing duties on "The Jerk," in which Gottlieb also played the part of the unforgettably named Iron Balls McGinty. Gottlieb's subsequent work, such as writing for the first two "Jaws" sequels, would be less noteworthy, though "Amazon Women on the Moon"--a sketch-driven send-up of '50s science fiction films for which Gottlieb directed several segments--achieved a cult following.
