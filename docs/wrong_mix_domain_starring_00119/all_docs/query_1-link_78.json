        "text": "As if planning your wedding weren't hard enough, there's nothing to set you back like discovering you're already married - to someone you've never met!\n\nFor most women, finding and settling down with your one true love can be a soul-searching, life-long activity that you only hope ends in success. But for Uma Thurman in her latest movie role, finding a husband is a bit like catching a bus: you spend forever waiting for the right one to show up, and then two arrive at once.\n\nThe Accidental Husband, Uma's latest foray into the world of rom-com, sees the six-foot beauty playing Dr Emma Lloyd, a pragmatic but uptight radio relationship expert and talk-show host, who's engaged to the affable and ever-so-English Michael (played by romantic pin up and ex-Mr Darcy, Colin Firth), when she discovers that - on paper - she's already betrothed to some fella named Patrick.\n\nWhile the so-called 'love doctor' might spend her days dispensing advice to the lonely and bewildered women of New York, when it comes to knowing what real love is, she doesn't have a clue. After carelessly advising one caller to ditch her hubby-to-be, Emma finds herself the victim of a spurned and hot-headed fireman (played by Grey's Anatomy star Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who decides the only way to cure his broken heart is to hack into city records and make Emma already married - to him.\n\n\"Emma is at the height of her career and she's about to be married to a great guy,\" explains Uma, looking gorgeous in a black suit and plunging gold top for the London premiere of the film (which she rode to in a London fire engine).\n\n\"She thinks she has it all and then this 'accidental husband' comes in and wrecks everything. I just love the vulnerability of someone who thinks she knows everything and then gets taught the lesson of her life. And I could completely relate to her: super successful, sure of herself in practically every way, and clueless at the same time!\"\n\nUma spent the last 10 years developing this film, which she also produced, after finding that all the roles she was being offered were a bit ditzy (think The Truth About Cats and Dogs), a bit serious (remember Dangerous Liaisons?), or a bit too active (try Kill Bill).\n\n\"I kind of always wanted to do what I wasn't being asked to do,\" laughs Uma. \"Ten years ago I was in period dramas and dressed up in corsets, which was great, but I couldn't get to play in any contemporary comedy in America - I couldn't even get a meeting, which frustrated me no end.\n\n\"And I loved everything about this script, from the title, to the set up of the plot, to the dialogue. I saw it as the perfect way to express my sense of humour and I thought, I can do this - I'll just cast myself.\"\n\nBeing a producer meant that not only could Uma write herself into the lead, she could also have her say in a stellar cast, which includes cinema veterans Sam Shepard, Isabella Rossellini and Colin Firth.\n\n\"Colin is charming and wonderful,\" says the 37-year-old, smiling. \"I had the best time with him and I would love to work with him again. He's completely smooth and he has a dry humour, which is fabulous.\"\n\nUma's choice in the film is a hard one: do you go for the man of your reality, who you know is responsible and trust-worthy, or do you choose the impulsive and fun man of your dreams?\n\n\"I'm very impulsive, but I've pretended to be pragmatic for most of my life,\" admits Uma, who was married to Gary Oldman age 20, and whose mother was reportedly briefly married to LSD guru Timothy Leary, after the two were introduced by Salvador Dali.\n\nWhether led by impulse or not, Uma's love life has been in and out of the newspapers after her six-year marriage to her Gattaca co-star Ethan Hawke, with whom she has two children - Maya Ray, 9, and Levon Roan, 6, ended in 2004.\n\nSince then she's been linked to New York hotelier Andre Balazs and is now rumoured to be engaged to Elle Macpherson's former partner, French financier Arpad Busson.\n\nWhile she may have felt some affinity with the romantic-but-confused 'love doctor', Uma downplays the importance of advice and finds it more important to make decisions for yourself.\n\n\"I don't think anyone takes advice,\" she says, sporting a mysterious blue-stoned ring on her wedding finger, \"Everyone just needs to talk about their issues. They don't actually ever want to take advice, but it's a great launching point for gossip.\n\n\"When I was 12, I told my mum that I wanted to be an actress, and she said, 'What? Are you kidding? Everyone wants to be that. Don't be ridiculous.'\"\n\nUma left school at 15 to model and was quickly cast in a succession of films, including a role as Venus in The Adventures Of Baron Munchausen and as the naive (and occasionally topless) Cecile de Volanges in Dangerous Liaisons with John Malkovich.\n\nBut after 1994's Pulp Fiction, she became one of the industry's highest-paid actresses, and was nominated for an Academy Award for her role as the black-bob wearing Mia Wallace, as well as two Golden Globes for her samurai sword-wielding portrayal of Black Mamba in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill series.\n\nDespite the success of Kill Bill 1 and 2, however, Uma - named for the Buddhist philosophy of the \"Great Middle Way\" (her father, a scholar of Indo-Tibetan studies, was the first westerner to be ordained a Tibetan Buddhist monk) - squashed any rumours of another Tarantino-Thurman action film.\n\n\"I should make another action, 'female-hero' type of film,\" she says, \"but I haven't yet found the script for it, one that demands that I go through all that exercise!\"\n\nUma's having fun not \"putting myself into boxes\", it seems, which explains her recent role as Swedish stage actress Ulla in The Producers, portraying the victim of an attack in thriller The Life Before Her Eyes (for release this year), and modelling for Louis Vuitton.\n\nAs for The Accidental Husband - and perhaps her impending (or already existing) engagement to Arpad Busson - she seems quite clear.\n\n\"It's not just about love but about true happiness. Who hasn't spent hours talking about love and relationships, wondering how to get it right and what it all means? I think we all want to know how to be happy.\"\n\nName: Uma Karuna Thurman\n\nAge: 37\n\nSignificant Other: French financier Arpad Busson, 44\n\nCareer High: The success of Kill Bill, as well as being knighted in 2006 with the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres of France for outstanding achievement in art and literature\n\nCareer Low: A few too many to mention, including the role of a desperate 30-something seducing a younger man in Prime and the lead in flop My Super Ex-Girlfriend\n\nFamous For: That yellow cat-suit and can-do, kick-ass attitude of Kill Bill - not to mention her incredible, almost haunting beauty\n\nWords of Wisdom: \"I can't discuss my personal life too much or it would become rather impersonal.\""
