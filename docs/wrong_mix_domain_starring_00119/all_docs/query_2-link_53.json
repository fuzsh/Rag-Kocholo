        "text": "One of my favorite Shepard plays, FOOL FOR LOVE, will be coming to Broadway next year. The production staged at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in MA this summer was such a success that it will move to the Manhattan Theatre Club's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. Directed by Daniel Aukin, the leads will again be played by Sam Rockwell and Nina Arianda. Performances will begin September 15, 2015 with opening night set for October 8. The story goes like this - \"Holed up in a seedy motel on the edge of the Mojave Desert, two former lovers unpack the deep secrets and dark desires of their tangled relationship, passionately tearing each other apart. Beaten down by ill-fated love and a ruthless struggle for identity, can they ultimately live with, or without, each other?\"\n\nSam says that his own experience of love inspired this play, which was written shortly after breaking up with his wife O-Lan.\n\nAfter two weeks of previews, the first reviews are trickling in. Here are some excerpts:\n\nLinda Winer, Newsweek:\n\nMythic, mysterious and obscure... The 90-minute drama, another transfer from actor Stephen Rea's Field Day company in Northern Ireland, is one of the more sober and obscure collages among Shepard's 50-odd, deeply scary, weirdly primal, often amusing works. In many ways, this feels like a return to the playwright's experimental off Off-Broadway beginnings... Ancient myth mingles with Irish accents and desert-rat Americana in a play that is both compelling and pretty ponderous. Still, nobody but Shepard could have written it.\n\nMatthew Murray, Talking Broadway:\n\nIf not for Shepards other tension-packing device, of intricately disrupting the timeline so that, at certain moments, youre not sure whos involved in the event youre watching or when exactly its happening, there would be no notable deviations from the source at all. This doesnt exactly kill the evening, but it also doesnt help it  youre going to take away very little, if anything, from A Particle of Dread that you wouldnt from a solid version of Oedipus Rex...\n\nFor her part, director Nancy Meckler has kept the pacing sharp and the actors focused, though shes not able to conjure surprise when Shepard doesnt give her enough cues to do so. Nor has she made convincing use of Frank Conways portentous but head-scratching abattoir set or the live musicians who oversell the spooky factor through Martins banshee-noir compositions. Too often, the production seems to be trying to say too much, in too many different ways. The script suffers from the opposite problem - Shepards message would come through more distinctly and more powerfully if we could see how its evolved across the last few thousand years. Resetting the action in the America of today only takes him so far, and the play feels as though it wants to go further than he allows it.\n\nFrank Scheck, The Hollywood Reporter:\n\nThis oblique intellectual exercise is likely to prove off-putting to all but the most adventurous audiences, although Shepard completists will no doubt want to catch the latest offering from the playwright's ever-restless imagination... Audience members will find themselves baffled at times by the juxtaposition of characters and situations, which seem to have been tossed into a blender and randomly reassembled.... Filled with comic digressions, the piece is frustratingly oblique rather than illuminating... Shepard's willful self-indulgence smacks more of an overeager university drama student than a seasoned playwright.\n\nIn a telephone interview last month with Signature Theatre, Sam was quoted as saying, \"I'm very disappointed in the current state of theatre, especially in New York, about this whole business of not being able to move a play. You know, you have to have a movie star in your play in order to be able to sell tickets. People don't come to see plays, they come to see movie stars. And as a writer, it kind of turns your stomach.\" Wait a minute here. Actor Stephen Rea, who will appear in the upcoming A PARTICLE OF DREAD, is counted among the top 10 Irish actors according to Hollywood.com and having appeared in more than 75 films, he certainly qualifies as a movie star! I just saw him once more in Graham Greene's End of the Affair, and he never fails to impress me. I think our movie star did right to hook up with Mr. Rea. Here's how they met according to Sam.\n\n\"I left New York in the early '70s... I went to London because the fringe theatre was happening at that time. It was very eclectic and every exciting in the way that the original off-off Broadway was, and that's exactly what I was looking for. Stephen and I met at the Hampstead Theatre, which is also where Nancy [Meckler] originated, and she happens to be directing, so the whole thing was incredible, almost accidental. I'm very grateful.\"\n\nIn a recent interview Sam spoke about the deaths of Philip Seymour Hoffman and Robin Williams. He had seen Hoffman just a week before he died when they attended the Sundance Film Festival in January. Sam's opinion was, \"He was overweight, but he was overweight a lot. And he was pretty tired. He said he was going to go back and take a nap... See, I don't think he meant to kill himself. I think he had some bad heroin though I didn't realize he was that much of a junkie.\" He pauses. \"I knew Robin pretty well and Robin knew he wanted out - he had Parkinson's. The two guys were very similar in that they were both overwhelmed by their own thing. I know a lot of people who've died... who've taken their own lives. But you know Patti [Smith], who's an old, old friend of mine, she wrote a review of the new Murakami book that appeared in the NY Times, and at the end of it, she said, 'I don't want to kill myself. I want to see what happens.' And what a statement. I believe her.\"\n\nIn the same interview, Sam shared more thoughts. About America, he says, \"We're on our way out, as a culture.\" As others have pointed out, whether you agree or disagree with Sam depends on your definition of American culture. Perhaps his America may be on its way out but the America of others may be on its way in and he's going to be left in the dust suffering from Grumpy Old Man Syndrome. The fact is Sam Shepard is averse to change. BUT still so damn lovable...\n\nHe tells us he's writing his first novel. \"After six book collections, basically I thought, 'God, wouldn't it be so great to be able to sustain something?'\" But he is hesitant to expand on plot or themes. \"I don't know how to explain it. I really don't. Hopefully it's a novel, but I have the hardest time sustaining prose. I feel like I'm a natural-born playwright but the prose thing has always mystified me. How to keep it going? How do people do it, for years and years? I've been working on this for 10 years!\"\n\nHe does his serious writing at the Santa Fe Institute because in Kentucky back at his horse farm, he would be easily distracted. Evidently the academic atmosphere is helpful. \"It's a great discipline,\" he says. \"So I'm very content for that reason. I mean I produce pages. Pages! Whether they're any good or not \"\n\nWhen it comes to the commercial aspect of movie-making, he says, \"It's difficult. I know as an actor you have to negotiate but I can't handle the whole idea that art and commerce are synonymous. It drives me nuts. And then you get the reputation of being difficult to work with.\" There are, he adds, producers who \"seem to really care\" but he's skeptical of \"the big studio guys\" and Netflix, and those people who \"don't think what the actor's going through, what the writer's going through, what the artistic essence is\".\n\nFilming began July 21 in Virginia for Sam's latest film, ITHACA. The film, executive produced by Tom Hanks, is Meg Ryan's directorial debut. Based on the book, \"The Human Comedy\", written by William Saroyan, \"Ithaca\" is a coming-of-age story set in the San Joaquin Valley in California during World War II.\n\nFourteen-year-old Homer Macauley is left to take care of his mother and family when his older brother goes to war. Homer's dream is to be the greatest and fastest bicycle telegraph messenger the world has ever known. The messages he carries all around his hometown are filled with love and pain that reflect how World War II has impacted the homefront. On top of his responsibilities as a messenger, Homer also has important duties at home. His father is dead, and his older brother has gone off to war, so he must help his mother in providing for his older sister and caring for his four-year-old brother, Ulysses.\n\nMs. Ryan will also play Mrs. Macauley with Alex Neustaedter as her son Homer. Meg's real-life son Jack Quaid will take on the role of older son Marcus. Sam plays a man named Willie Grogan.\n\nThe producers transformed parts of Petersburg into a small World War II-era town through the use of storefront facades, a makeshift grocery store and a fleet of cars from antique collectors. Also used were The Brickhouse Run and the historic Tree Hill Farm. Most of the film was shot in Petersburg with some scenes shot at the former Robert Fulton School in the Fulton Hill area of Richmond and at a farm surrounding the city. Location manager Tom Trio said that part of the city's appeal was that not a lot of cosmetic changes had to be made to adapt the city to Ryans vision or that of writer Erik Jendresen's.\n\nHere is a bit more info on the upcoming NYC premiere of A PARTICLE OF DREAD, staged by the Signature Theatre Company.\n\nIt will be produced with Field Day Theater Company, directed by Nancy Meckler, and will once again feature Stephen Rea as Oedipus. Rehearsals will begin October 14, 2014 with the play running from November 11 thru December 21 at The Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theatre.\n\nThe description of the characters is as follows:\n\nOedipus/Otto: plays multiple roles including Oedipus, King of Thebes. When told as a young man that he was destined to kill his father and marry his mother, he left his home and came to Thebes. There he solved the riddle of the sphinx and married Queen Jocasta without realizing she was his real mother. Now Thebes has been attacked by plague. Oedipus is a strong, proud leader, determined to rescue his city from the plague by finding out who killed its former king. Short of temper. Also plays Otto, in a wheelchair, possibly a retired teacher. Mild mannered and curious, he is plagued by dreams in which he seems to have murdered someone. He becomes fascinated by newspaper reports of a crime on the highway, as if somehow this crime is related to him or his dreams. He has a close loving relationship with his daughter Annalee.\n\nAntigone/Annalee: plays multiple roles including Antigone, daughter of Oedipus. Strong, determined, passionate about how she lives her life. Uncompromising, loving. Also plays Annalee, daughter of Otto. Married to a violent man who has killed their babysitter. Terrified it will affect her baby son's future because of what he has seen. Blunt, outspoken, determined, loves her father.\n\nJocasta/Jocelyn: Jocasta is the Queen of Thebes. Attractive, sensual, high status, proud, a strong match for her husband Oedipus. He is in fact her son. Perhaps she has always known or suspected this and does not want the truth to come out. Mild Northern Irish accent. Jocelyn is the wife of Otto. A Southwestern housewife. Otto is an anxious man, but she is the calm one, unruffled, wants a peaceful life, avoids conflict. A gently warm personality.\n\nUncle Del/Traveler/Tiresias/Maniac Of The Outskirts: with a strong comic sense, irony, sense of detachment from society's madness. Plays multiple roles, including Uncle Del, based on the Oracle at Delphi. Reads signs, throws the bones, and sacrifices animals to read their intestines; Traveler. blind, lives in the hills and can see the future; Tiresias, a blind seer called to Oedipus to reveal what he knows about why the city is ridden with plague; and Maniac of the Outskirts, an anonymous madman who lives on the outskirts of society and gets blamed for everything. Bitter, pissed off, sarcastic, comic. Think Ratso Ritzo in \"Midnight Cowboy.\"\n\nLaius/Larry/Langos: powerful presence, good-looking, sexy, threatening, simmering, high status. Plays multiple roles including Laius, a king who ruled Thebes years before the Oedipus story. When his wife Queen Jocasta gave birth to their son, Oedipus, the child was destined to kill his father and marry his mother. Laius took the child to the hills to be left to die. Years later he was killed at a crossroads in an altercation with Oedipus; Larry, a young, modern version of Laius, consulting a healer because his wife cannot conceive; and Langos, a gangster casino boss who denies at first that he ever had a son but then admits that he did abandon the child in the hills.\n\nRandolph: an American detective who is very keen on the forensic aspect of the work. He is so obsessive about what one can glean about a crime from the evidence that he gets carried away and begins to picture the crime and the people and fantasize about them. Must have a strong comic sense.\n\nHarrington: from the American Southwest. A highway policeman, he is laid back and feels very cynical about forensic experts. He sees the crime in a very straightforward way and simply assumes it is Mexican gang warfare. Bemused by Randolph's fanciful ideas gleaned from the evidence. Must have a strong comic sense."
