        "text": "Like any movie star, Sam Shepard fits right in among the glittering crowds at Sundance. But he’s probably the only actor in Park City, Utah, who looks like he could have easily dropped by from a nearby mountaintop ranch, rather than arriving by plane from Los Angeles. Shepard has brought his unique rugged gravitas to the screen and stage for 40 years, from Days of Heaven to last December’s August: Osage County; at this year’s Sundance Film Festival he was representing Cold in July, a low-budget noir co-starring Michael C. Hall, Vinessa Shaw, and Don Johnson.\n\nHow low-budget? “It’s very much a handmade movie,” he told V.F.’s Krista Smith when he sat down for an interview at the festival. Going into a big shoot-out scene, Shepard was handed the cartridges for the prop gun and told: “Make sure you make each one of these count. It’s going to be a big gunfight, but you only have three cartridges.” Another scene with characters shooting bottles off barrels involved “a girl standing at the top of a ladder, with a fishing pole and with fishing line, and she’s popping each one of the bottles off as you shoot.”\n\nShepard popped up at last year’s Sundance as well in Jeff Nichols’s Mud, opposite Matthew McConaughey in one of his many recent standout roles; McConaughey is now nominated for his first Oscar, for his lead role in Dallas Buyers Club. Says Shepard about his former co-star, “It’s really great to see an actor find himself, in his sojourn.”\n\nAnd where will Shepard’s sojourn take him next? Far away from the madding crowds of Sundance, to start with. “I try not to be in situations where I’m being grabbed at. For the most part you can avoid them. Not here.”\n\nCheck back to Vanity Fair’s Hollywood for more Sundance Film Festival coverage, and visit our Sundance hub for the full lineup of video interviews.\n\nSundance Stars in Exclusive Photos\n\n1 / 30\n\nPolitics\n\nRFK Jr.’s Family Doesn’t Want Him to Run.
