        "text": "Tarantino freely appropriates and riffs off of cult cinema classics in his work. The first half of his 2003 film in two parts, Kill Bill Vol. 1, is a story of revenge that refers to (and borrows from) the Japanese revenge classic Lady Snowblood.\n\nSome examples of this follow:\n\nAs is common in many martial arts films, both movies feature a sequence showing the protagonist ringed by aggressors, fighting each in rapid succession. The fight scene in Lady Snowblood is more similar to the upstairs fighting scene in Kill Bill, but the overhead shot above ties nicely into my next point:\n\nThe climax of each film is in a remarkably similar locale. Each crescendo plays out in a dance hall ringed with an upper balcony and with a similar grid design on the floor.\n\nAnd of course, both films feature a multitude of severed limbs. (aside: Fitz previously wrote about Tarantino's effective use of not showing the most violent act in Reservoir Dogs, instead relying on the imagination of the viewer to deepen the emotional intensity of the scene. Not showing acts of violence is one of the oldest and most formidable techniches in formative film making. By showing the myriad maimings in Kill Bill, Tarantino allows the viewer to interact on the visual rather than mental level, thereby lessening the impact of the violence.)\n\nI admit that the shots above don't amply demonstrate the deep similarities between the two films. It's difficult to do the comparison justice with stills, and the argument is more compelling when done via video. Any fans of Tarantino or Kill Bill should definitely check out Lady Snowblood. It offers an interesting view into the production of Kill Bill, and is also an interesting film in its own right.\n\nLabels\n\nOver the last ten years, the cinema has given us a great deal to be thankful for: a rebirth of the Batman franchise, a series of examinations of what it means to live in this particular decade, and a mass of character studies whether they be animated or popcorn thrillers. As much as I have enjoyed the offerings, a list must be culled together for the end of the year. Except this year is different, this year ten films must be selected from hundreds. Below are some of the best of the aughts. Enjoy! 10) There Will Be Blood Paul Thomas Anderson's magnum opus, a scathing look at extremism in America and the evils of greed and profiteering from religion. It also features the best performance of the decade with Daniel Day-Lewis as oil-man Daniel Plainview. 9) Up A beautiful tale that entrances all ages, Up managed to captivate children and tell a tale that adults cherish as well. 8) The Dark Knight Maybe just a comic book film, but it is the best comic book film\n\nMonths before Inception hit the theaters forums were alive with rumors that Christopher Nolan either accidentally or intentionally stole some details from another film, the Japanese anime Paprika. The biggest point of comparison for some bloggers and forum runners was the fact that both of the films featured a device that allowed a person, or people, to travel into another’s dreams and delve into their subconscious. Minor points of comparison include scenes in Paprika where the character Paprika breaks through a mirrored wall by holding her hand to it, as well as a scene where a police detective falls his way down a hallway. Claims have been made that Inception abounds with imagery similar to or exactly like the anime movie, but with the recent release of the film on DVD and Blu-Ray, and with Paprika available for several years now, an examination of the two plots can be made more fully. Let us begin with the primary claim— Inception stole the idea of a dream\n\nArmond White is film criticism’s most famous contrarian. At one moment he writes a review declaring Toy Story 3 to be the most obscene excuse for toy commercials he has ever watched, and then two weeks later types out a glowing review of Resident Evil: Afterlife . He is of split-mind for sure. But what does his Flickchart look like? Read the rest at Flickchart !"
