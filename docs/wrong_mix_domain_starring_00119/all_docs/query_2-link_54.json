        "text": "If the 1970s were the birth of the Austin film scene, the 1980s are when the local film industry started to take its footing. With more features being made, a crew-base of trained professionals started to take root in the area. The word got out to Hollywood that there were diverse locations in the Austin area: Hill Country, ranches, small towns and a cool city with lots to do during down time. More importantly, there were skilled technicians and creatives in town, which allowed productions to film on location and—more importantly—to do so on time and on budget.\n\nIt was an exciting time in Austin. Joel and Ethan Coen made their debut with \"Blood Simple\" and the film world never be the same. Tobe Hooper came home to produce the deranged, magnificent tongue-in-cheek sequel to the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" Robert Benton, another Texan who found success in Hollywood, came to Austin to make the romantic comedy \"Nadine,\" in which Austin plays a supporting star. The decade came to a close with the majestic \"Lonesome Dove,\" a tour de force western about the cowboy way. The mini-series was an international hit and a true statement of how far the local film industry had come.\n\nThere have been about 300 films and television series produced in Austin over the past 50 years. In this series, we will look back decade-by-decade and explore those classic #MadeInAustin productions that are available to stream from the comfort of home. In this second part, we will look at the 1980s.\n\nHoneysuckle Rose (1980)\n\nDirected by: Jerry Schatzberg\n\nStarring: Willie Nelson, Dyan Cannon, Amy Irving, Slim Pickins\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nRated PG / 119 minutes / Drama, Music, Romance\n\nAlready distinguished in their trades, Willie Nelson and Bill Wittliff now had blossoming film careers. A generation before it was commonplace, they used their clout to bring films home to Austin. Wittliff, a distinguished writer and publisher pushed to bring Texas literature to the screen. Willie used his musical talents to segway to acting. Honeysuckle Rose gave Willie Nelson his first top-billing in a movie and was followed by a slew of successful starring features, some of which were made in Austin like \"Songwriter,\" \"Red Headed Stranger\" and the made-for-tv movies \"A Pair Of Aces\" and \"Another Pair of Aces.\" \"Red Headed Stranger\" allowed Nelson to build Luck, Texas - a permanent western town set located right outside Austin that is still used by film and television productions to this day.\n\nIn \"Honeysuckle Rose,\" Willie Nelson plays country singer Buck Bonham, who is struggling to find national fame while spending his life on the road. He juggles his music career with his responsibilities to his long-suffering wife Viv (Dyan Cannon) and their son. Buck has everything going his way until Lily Ramsey (Amy Irving), the daughter of his former guitarist, joins his tour. The road leads to temptation, which leads to his potential downfall. It’s soundtrack is fantastic, and includes Nelson’s biggest hit, \"On the Road Again,\" for which Nelson was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Keep your eye out as rock-photographer-turned-director Jerry Schatzberg and cinematographer Robbie Muller (\"Paris Texas,\" \"Down By Law\") shine a light on a variety of Nelson's performances at long gone local music institutions like the Soap Creek Saloon and the Skyline Club. Honeysuckle Rose is also the first of many Austin-set scripts by the late, great Bill Wittliff.\n\nStreaming on: @YouTube, @PrimeVideo, @GooglePlay, @iTunes, @VuduFans, @RedBox, @MicrosoftStore\n\nThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas (1982)\n\nDirected by: Colin Higgins\n\nStarring: Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton, Dom DeLuise, Charles Durning, Jim Nabors\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nRated R / 114 minutes / Comedy, Musical\n\nThey don’t call Austin the Live Music Capital of the World for nothing and Alan Rudolph knew a good thing when he heard it, tapping into the local music scene for his two of his locally-shot features \"Roadie\" and \"Songwriter.\" Nobody had to tell Dolly Parton either, she knew Austin was the place to make a musical and she did just that with \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\" The film went on to be the fourth highest-grossing live-action musical film of the 1980s and is a defining Texas classic.\n\nIn this comedy musical, Dolly Parton plays Miss Mona, manager of the Chicken Ranch, a brothel with a long history in Gilbert, Texas. The locals have a good relationship with the institution and Mona is respected in the community. Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd (Burt Reynolds) looks out for the Chicken Ranch due to his past with Miss Mona. But when pious reporter Melvin Thorpe (Dom DeLuise) targets it as the Devil's playhouse, it leads outside interests to try and shut it down, putting the governor (hilariously played by Charles Durning) in a tough spot. Filmed in Austin and Pflugerville, this was the first movie production ever allowed to film inside the historic Texas Capitol building. The Kuempel Haus in Pflugerville was used for the notorious Chicken House location. It’s now an event space, though it has had a number of famous on-camera roles including in the films \"Hard Promises,\" \"Flesh & Bone\" and \"Transformers: Age of Extinction.\" The world premiere of the movie was held at Austin's Paramount Theater and was preceded by a parade. Parton would return to Austin in the early '90s to make the made-for-TV film \"Wild Texas Wind.\"\n\nStreaming on: @YouTube, @PrimeVideo, @GooglePlay, @iTunes, @MicrosoftStore, @VuduFans, @RedBox\n\nThe Blood Simple (1984)\n\nDirected by: Joel and Ethan Coen\n\nStarring: Frances McDormand, Dan Hedaya, John Getz, M. Emmet Walsh\n\nCircle Films\n\nRated R / 99 minutes / Crime, Drama, Thriller\n\nThe neo-noir \"Blood Simple\" signaled the arrival of the Coen Brothers upon its release in 1984. Many critics considered Joel and Ethan Coen's first film to be the greatest American independent film of all time. \"Blood Simple\" concerns bar owner Marty (Dan Hedaya), his wife Abby (Frances McDormand in her debut starring role) and Ray (John Getz), the bartender Abby plans to leave Marty for. Marty finds out and hires a sleazy private detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill the runaway couple. However, as the classic tagline states, nothing is simple when blood is involved. Paths cross and tangle to the point where the plot becomes a series of ingenious circumstances and thrilling mistakes. Filmed in Austin, Hutto, Pflugerville and Round Rock; from the opening atop Mount Bonnell to the atmospheric showdown in a Sixth Street loft, \"Blood Simple\" has a way of using the local locations. Joel Coen picked Austin after the city made an impression on him during a brief tenure at the University of Texas for graduate school. The film’s cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld (who later became a noted director himself with the hit \"Men in Black\") made the most of his time in Austin, even helping to shoot the music video for The Clash’s \"Rock the Casbah\" when the band stopped in town for a tour date. The Coen Brothers would return to Austin 25 years later to film their remake of \"True Grit.\"\n\nStreaming on: @YouTube, @PrimeVideo, @GooglePlay, @iTunes, @VuduFans\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre II (1986)\n\nDirected by: Tobe Hooper\n\nStarring: Dennis Hopper, Caroline Williams, Jim Siedow, Bill Johnson, Bill Moseley\n\nCannon Films\n\nRated R / 101 minutes / Comedy, Horror, Thriller\n\nMaybe the most important movie ever made! Okay, a little biased, but this is the movie that gave way to the founding of the Austin Film Commission... Someone had to be an authority with a chainsaw-wielding Leatherface, Chop Top and Lefty running around the city! After success with the Stephen Spielberg-produced \"Poltergeist,\" Cannon Films gave Tobe Hooper a three-picture deal that included a sequel to his 1974 hit \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre II\" may throw some viewers off as it’s more of a black comedy than a true horror like the original. Not to say there aren’t great effects gags by \"Dawn of the Dead\" gore guru Tom Savini. Leatherface is back and up to his cannibalistic ways, along with the rest of his twisted family. This time, family has set their sights on disc jockey Vanita \"Stretch\" Brock (Caroline Williams), who teams up with Texas lawman “Lefty” Enright (an amazing Dennis Hopper), whose relatives were victims in the first installment, to battle Leatherface and his cohorts deep within their carnival lair. Next time you are having a drink at the Mean Eyed Cat, take a close look around; you may recognize that you are at the location of the infamous Cut-Rite Chain Saws scene!\n\nStreaming on: @iTunes"
