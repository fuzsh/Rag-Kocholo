        "text": "Sally Field\n\nField no longer has the brown football-helmet hair her character, M’Lynn Eatenton, was known for, but she’s still just as stellar an actor as she was during her days as Shelby’s mom. She hasn’t slowed down, that’s for sure. Some of her most memorable roles over the years include those in the films Forrest Gump, Mrs. Doubtfire and Lincoln, as well as the TV series Brothers & Sisters. This year, she starred in the Netflix original film Little Evil.\n\nOutside acting, Field is a passionate philanthropist and social justice advocate. She raises awareness about osteoporosis, having been diagnosed herself in 2005, and she is an outspoken champion for women’s and LGBTQ rights.\n\nTom Skerritt\n\nIn Steel Magnolias, Tom Skerritt played patriarch Drum Eatenton — a man who would do anything for his daughter, including shoot fireworks at the pigeons infringing upon her wedding day. In real life, he is a prolific actor, having nearly 200 acting credits under his belt. He is perhaps best known for playing Sheriff Jimmy Brock on the ’90s series Picket Fences, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award. Fun fact: He played Sally Field’s husband once more from 2006 to 2009 as her late husband on ABC’s Brothers & Sisters.\n\nNow 85, Skerritt still appears to be rockin’ and rollin’ along. In recent years, he has enjoyed cameos on popular TV series such as The Good Wife and Madam Secretary. And in 2017 alone, Skerritt starred in two feature films.\n\nJulia Roberts\n\nAlthough Julia Roberts was a relative unknown when she starred as Shelby Eatenton Latcherie, Steel Magnolias helped put her on the map. The following year would bring Roberts’ true breakout role as Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. In the years since, seminal roles in films like Notting Hill; Runaway Bride; Erin Brockovich; Charlie Wilson’s War; Eat, Pray, Love; and August: Osage County have solidified her status as one of Hollywood’s top talents. Her many awards include an Academy Award, a Critics Choice Award, three Golden Globes and a SAG Award.\n\nIn 2002, Roberts wed cameraman Danny Moder, whom she met on the set of 2000’s The Mexican. Together, the couple has three children.\n\nDylan McDermott\n\nSteel Magnolias saw Dylan McDermott star as handsome Louisiana lawyer Jackson Latcherie, married to Julia Roberts’ Shelby. Although he wasn’t featured prominently on-screen in the film, McDermott has made up for it in the time since with starring roles in hit TV series such as The Practice, The Grid, Dark Blue, American Horror Story and Hostages. McDermott is also slated to star in a new series called LA>Vegas, which will debut during the 2017–2018 TV season.\n\nIn 2014, he starred in the short-lived series Stalker, and while it only lasted one season, it led to McDermott meeting his current fiancée, Maggie Q. He has two daughters with ex-wife Shiva Rose.\n\nShirley MacLaine\n\nPrior to starring as the curmudgeonly Ouiser Boudreaux in Steel Magnolias, Shirley MacLaine already had an impressive body of work for which she was known — including her Best Actress Award-winning turn in 1983’s Terms of Endearment. One of Hollywood’s most celebrated stars, MacLaine has won and been nominated for a slew of awards. In 2013, she received the Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts. She also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Today, at 83 years old, MacLaine remains a busy working actor with five films currently in production.\n\nMacLaine isn’t without controversy, though. Her comments on everything from the existence of UFOs to the cause of the Holocaust have drawn criticism.\n\nOlympia Dukakis\n\nThe late ’80s and the early ’90s proved to be instrumental in Olympia Dukakis’ career. The revered actor landed the role as Clairee Belcher in Steel Magnolias after winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe for her work in 1987’s Moonstruck. She then followed the success of those roles up with memorable turns in the Look Who’s Talking films, Mighty Aphrodite, Mr. Holland’s Opus, Sinatra and more… a lot more. Dukakis currently has over 100 acting credits. At present, she has six films in varying stages of production.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nDolly Parton sure has come a long way since sharing a one-room shack in rural Appalachia with 11 siblings. Steel Magnolias’ hairstylist Truvy Jones is one of Parton’s most memorable acting roles, but certainly not her only credit. The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and 9 to 5 came before it, and parts in The Beverly Hillbillies, Hannah Montana, Joyful Noise and more came after it. Parton’s most recent acting roles to create buzz were her cameos in the 2015 TV movie Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors and 2016’s Dolly Parton’s Christmas of Many Colors: Circle of Love — both of which she executive produced.\n\nOutside acting and producing, Parton continues to perform as one of country music’s most treasured artists. She is also a charitable giver of both time and resources, with one example of her philanthropy being her children’s book program, the Imagination Library.\n\nSam Shepard\n\nAs Truvy’s husband Spud Jones in Steel Magnolias, Sam Shepard didn’t really have a redeeming moment until the end of the film. That’s OK, though, because Shepard was one of Hollywood’s most beloved actors during the course of his life and career. Some of his most memorable work includes roles in 1993’s The Pelican Brief, 1999’s Snow Falling on Cedars, 2000’s All the Pretty Horses, 2004’s The Notebook, 2012’s Mud and most recently, the hit Netflix series Bloodline. He was also a prolific playwright and director, having been awarded more Obie Awards (10) than any other writer or director.\n\nShepard died on July 27, 2017, in his Kentucky home from complications of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. He was 73 at the time of his death.\n\nDaryl Hannah\n\nAfter starring as the bumbling born-again Christian hair-school grad Annelle Dupuy Desoto in Steel Magnolias, Darryl Hannah kept trucking with roles in movies like 1993’s Grumpy Old Men (and 1995’s Grumpier Old Men), 1994’s The Little Rascals, 1999’s My Favorite Martian and 2000’s Dancing at the Blue Iguana. Hannah is perhaps best known on-screen for her role as Elle Driver in Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2.\n\nHowever, Hannah is equally (if not more) known for her activism. In addition to her own environmental activism video blog called DHLoveLife, Hannah lives in a green-powered home and drives a bio diesel-fueled car. She is also active in the fight to help abolish sexual slavery around the world. She has been jailed or arrested numerous times for protesting as part of her activism, the most recent of which was in 2013 at the White House.\n\nKevin J. O’Connor\n\nKevin J. O’Connor had a bit part in Steel Magnolias as a bartender at Shelby’s wedding who later goes on to marry Annelle. And although O’Connor may not be as high-profile a Hollywood presence as some of his co-stars, it doesn’t mean he hasn’t been busy. In fact, O’Connor has been cast in a multitude of roles since, such as Canadian Bacon, Amistad, Gods and Monsters, There Will Be Blood and scores more. He is reportedly one of director Stephen Sommers favorite actors — he therefore casts O’Connor in many of his films. This includes Deep Rising, The Mummy and Van Helsing. Recent standout roles of O’Connor’s are a recurring part in the hit series Chicago P.D. and a cameo on The Blacklist in 2017. He has three movies slated for release in 2018."
