        "text": "Wall Street Journal:\n\nThe best of the townspeople is the priest Father Judge (Sam Shepard). Like other characters and events in the series, he was partly drawn from Charlotte Gray's 2010 book, \"Gold Diggers: Striking It Rich in the Klondike.\" Father Judge is a small but bright light of goodness in a town where most people go wrong at least in some way just to survive. An older Mr. Shepard has let his face become more expressive than the younger one did, giving him increasing power as an actor. A scene of Father Judge climbing up his rickety church in a rainstorm to raise a cross atop it is a dramatic high point of the series, too.\n\nKansas City Star:\n\nSam Shepard plays Judge as a grizzled, stark scepter who could frighten Christopher Walken. As usual, Shepard is restrained and razor-sharp.\n\nDavid Wiegand, Houston Chronicle:\n\n\"Klondike\" is melodramatic, but feels more substantial because of minutely detailed scripts and fully realized performances. The miniseries was shot on location, and the cinematography is spectacular, so much so that it's almost like watching a top-grade travel documentary at times.\n\nTim Goodman, The Hollywood Reporter:\n\nSuperbly directed by Simon Cellan Jones, who packs in sweeping, awe-inspiring images of nature with the up-close ugliness of dank, mud-packed streets, Klondike stands out instantly with its large canvas. Jones and his crew filmed real avalanches, icy river scenes, snow storms, gunfights in dense forests - all of which contrasted grandly alongside the day-to-day drudgery of the camps. Jones manages to make these six hours feel cold and wet as you follow Haskell and the denizens of the Yukon through their often bleak pursuit of the all-consuming gold nugget.\n\nTerri Schwartz, Zap2it.com:\n\nThe great acting chops of the cast of \"Klondike\" and the strong writing and cinematography made Discovery's first scripted miniseries a solid investment of six hours.\n\nHank Stuever, Washington Post:\n\nA strong cast delivering an honest effort... A solid spirit and a moral underpinning... Klondike is not going to win awards for its lackluster screenplay and penchant for melodrama, but it does have some of the plucky energy youd enjoy at one of those faux-saloon dinner theaters, where the gradations between good and bad hardly exist. It comes across almost like a musical without any songs, and before long, youre swept up in its crisp visuals and steady pace.\n\nShaunna Murphy, Hollywood Life:\n\nSam Shepard and Tim Roth shine as two of the (many) colorful characters Bill meets on his journey. Sam plays the fascinating real-life historical figure Father Judge, a strong-willed but ultimately just priest who tends to the emotional and physical needs of the brave souls navigating the treacherous conditions of Klondike. Tim Roth, meanwhile, is delightfully wicked as the Count  a campy, would-be land baron who is willing to resort to desperate measures to make it rich.\n\nHugh David, Cult TV Times:\n\nLead Richard Madden as Bill Haskell, an educated man taking a risk with his gambling brother, does a fine job from the get-go, particularly around veterans like Brit Ian Hart, American Tim Blake Nelson, and the great American playwright and actor Sam Shepard as the Catholic priest planning on bringing at least Gods law to this place."
