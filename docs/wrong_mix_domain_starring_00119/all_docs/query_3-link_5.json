        "text": "1983 La Mama Production:\n\nFrank Rich, NY Times:\n\n'''Pecos Bill,' which runs roughly 20 minutes, was actually written by Mr. Shepard directly for the stage. According to the program, it was commissioned and then rejected, for unspecified reasons, by the San Francisco Bicentennial Committee of 1976. Perhaps that committee found 'Pecos Bill' too downbeat, but it's also possible that the work was deemed too insubstantial. Though billed as a 'comic operetta,' 'Pecos Bill' is merely an extended frontier ballad that, stripped of repetition, could fit on a single side of a 45-r.p.m. record.\"\n\n\"The song's engaging music, composed by Mr. Shepard and Catherine Stone, sounds like a cut from Bob Dylan's 'Nashville Skyline' as rewritten by Kurt Weill. The incantatory lyrics state some of Mr. Shepard's recurring themes without dramatizing them. Pecos Bill tamed the West 'all by hand'; he was 'a legend' and 'a giant.' Yet the legacy of his myth is not one of heroism, but of death, and it's a modern legacy that neither he nor a nation can escape...\"\n\n\"If 'Pecos Bill' were sung by Willie Nelson and if the wife he kills, Sluefoot Sue, were Bette Midler, this number might be a lively turn in a jamboree of revisionist Americana. As performed by Mark Petrakis, a decidedly urban cowboy, and O-lan Shepard, who is Mr. Shepard's wife, it just drones on; only the onstage band seems alive. The staging, much of it involving a giant replica of a steer's head, is clumsy; one is rather shocked to discover that the director is Julie Hebert, who installed Mr. Shepard's energetic choreography of 'Fool for Love' at the Circle Repertory Company.\"\n\nBenedict Nightingale, NY Times:\n\n'''Pecos Bill' is a gaudy cantata in which the outlaw of the title, arriving onstage on a wicker scorpion, boasts of strangling tornadoes, tearing down mountains and digging the Rio Grande by hand, only to end in querulous bewilderment: 'Why is we forsaken, lost in shame, forgotten?' Still, the piece should provide the burgeoning Shepard industry with some useful footnotes. Not only does it contrast the magnificence of the myth with the bleakness of contemporary reality; it also reminds us of what was tawdry and squalid in that supposed magnificence. This is surely the answer to those who accuse Mr. Shepard of mindless nostalgia for the Old Frontier. He dreams, as many of us do, of release, liberty, being at one with the wilderness, but he knows what this often meant and means in practice.\"\n\nDavid Sterritt, Christian Science Monitor:\n\n\"'Pecos Bill'' makes a rip-roaring contrast to 'Superstitions\", belting out the tragicomic romance of our hero and Sluefoot Sue with makeshift melodies and broad choreography. There's a touch of sadness to even the most rollicking moments, as Bill wonders why he and his spouse, once celebrated in myth and legend, are now turning to dust in the otherwise-occupied American consciousness. But at the rare moments when things threaten to become just a tad philosophical, the energy and wit of the performers quickly remind us that it's all in fun... In all, a modest but engaging evening.\"\n\nMartin Kihn, Columbia Daily Spectator:\n\n\"'Pecos Bill' is a short cowboy rock-opera, about seven years old now. That piece involves a rock band, and Shepard wrote the music himself along with the gorgeous Catherine Stone, who actually joins the band at La Mama. It is the story of Pecos Bill, the very first cowboy, and his dead wife Slue-foot Sue. Luckily, Sue comes back from the grave to sing. It is a sad work, actually, mocking the cowboy mystique, marking the end and failure of the Frontier anchronism.\"\n\n\"In 'Pecos Bill', Mark Petrakis' mustache and smile are assets, for Bill is not a rugged man here, just a clown. With his red shirt, cowboy hat and toy pistols, he is the brilliant last stand of something funny. And O-lan Shepard, all in white, sitting on top of a sleigh-high giant plastic catfish, has enough farce to match her pretty soprano. Perhaps musical farce is an easier medium, but Bill and Sue sing 'Why is we both dyin/On this land/Why is we forsaken,' and the untuned fiddle plays in the background, and the cowboy in me longed to ride the range. The piece was very moving, and surprisingly precise.\"\n\n\"The music is very good and the actors always engaging. And there is always Sam Shepard, a man who never had schooling, who is the supreme example of uncalculated talent. He may never turn himself into a Bertot Brecht, but America has him. America will always have him.\"\n\n1997 Signature Theatre Company Production:\n\nBen Brantley, NY Times:\n\n\"Romain Fruge and Julie Christensen are delicious as Pecos Bill, portrayed by Mr. Fruge with a winning what-happened expression, and Slue-Foot Sue, the bride who bounded to the moon on Bill's wild steed with fatal consequences. The music, an off-center fusion of honky-tonk feistiness and wistful Western ballad, is by Looren Toolajian, and it charmingly matches the double tone of Mr. Shepard's words: part extravagantly silly hyperbole; part bewildered elegy.\""
