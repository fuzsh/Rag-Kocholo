        "text": "BLACKTHORN is a stunning surprise, an intelligent and emotional Western that comes from Magnolia Pictures, which means it will be available in theaters and on TV On Demand services at the same time.\n\nThe movie stars veteran actor and playwrights Sam Shepard in the role of a lifetime as former famed robber Butch Cassidy, posing under the alias James Blackthorn in 1920s Bolivia. Blackthorn learns that the woman he shared with the Sundance Kid has died, leaving the son to whom he’s been writing for years. This inspires him to leave his hideout to return to the United States and connect with the son. The movie shows his heartfelt letters to the son, which are filled with philosophies on living about the importance of friendship and not wasting time in life, and trying to make amends for past wrongs.\n\nWhile traveling alone, he encounters Eduardo, a younger Latino outlaw who has just robbed a train after studying Butch Cassidy’s famed techniques. The two first meet after Eduardo shoots at Blackthorn, and Blackthorn shoots in return. During the shootout, Blackthorn kills Eduardo’s horse, forcing him to stay close to Blackthorn. Blackthorn learns Eduardo has stolen $50,000 from what he describes as his rich employers.\n\nBlackthorn decides to keep riding with his new sidekick, Eduardo, because he thinks he’s found one last chance to score as a robber. The further they ride together, however, the more little details don’t add up. This leads to a stunning series of consequences and betrayals between the men.\n\nAs the story rolls forward, Blackthorn is seen having several flashbacks to the criminal glory days of his youth. These scenes work as a strong parallel with the modern day as he builds a new friendship for the first time in 20 years with the younger criminal. As the Mexican Army and a Pinkerton agent get closer, Blackthorn and Eduardo reveal their true characters in a series of intense doublecrosses.\n\nBLACKTHORN features an award-worthy performance by Sam Shepard and a terrifically charismatic turn by Eduardo Noriega as the new sidekick with a dark secret. BLACKTHORN works wonders, not just because of the quality acting but also in mixing moments of solid action with mesmerizing, thoughtful moments of natural beauty in the outdoor settings and the thoughtful conversations between its leads.\n\nThis is a beautifully shot movie that frequently frames its vibrant imagery as if they were paintings. The music score also shows lots of artistic craft. Overall, BLACKTHORN is one of the year’s best-made movies and can be seen in select cities theatrically but is available through most cable TV systems via On Demand.\n\nThe title character, Butch Cassidy, eventually takes a moral stance. He shows regret for some of his past actions. There are also references to facing God’s judgment. However, BLACKTHORN contains plenty of strong foul language and intense scenes of violence, so extreme caution is advised."
