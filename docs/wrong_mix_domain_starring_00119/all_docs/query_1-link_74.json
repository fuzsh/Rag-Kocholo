        "text": "“When you hit a wall – of your own imagined limitations – just kick it in.”\n\n― Sam Shepard\n\nSam Shepard\n\nSamuel Shepard Rogers IV is an American playwright, actor, and television and film director. He is the author of several books of short stories, essays, and memoirs, and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1979 for his play Buried Child. Shepard was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of pilot Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff (1983). Shepard received the PEN/Laura Pels International Foundation for Theater Award as a master American dramatist in 2009.\n\nAwards:\n\nWon Obie Award for Best Distinguished Play(s): 1966 Chicago, Icarus’s Mother, Red Cross; 1967 La Turista; 1968 Forensic and the Navigator, Melodrama Play; 1973 The Tooth of Crime\n\n1975 Won Obie Award for Best Playwriting: Action\n\n1977 Won Obie Award for Best New American Play: Curse of the Starving Class\n\n1979 Won Obie Award for Best Playwriting: Buried Child\n\n1979 Pulitzer Prize for Drama: Buried Child\n\n1980 Won Obie Award for Sustained Achievement\n\n1984 Won Obie Award for Best New American Play: Fool for Love\n\n1984 Won Obie Award for Best Direction: Fool for Love\n\n1984 Nominated Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor: The Right Stuff\n\n1985 Nominated BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay: Paris, Texas\n\n1986 Won Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play: A Lie of the Mind\n\n1986 Won New York Drama Critics’ Circle for Best Play: A Lie of the Mind\n\n1986 Won Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Off-Broadway Play: A Lie of the Mind\n\n1992 Won American Academy of Arts and Letters – Gold Medal for Drama\n\n1994 Inducted American Theatre Hall of Fame\n\n1996 NominatedTony Award for Best Play: Buried Child\n\n1997 Nominated Lone Star Film & Television Award for Best TV Supporting Actor: Hallmark Hall of Fame: “Lily Dale”\n\n1999 Nominated Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie: Dash and Lilly\n\n1999 Nominated Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Miniseries or TV Film: Dash and Lilly\n\n2000 Nominated Tony Award for Best Play: True West\n\n2001 Nominated Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Acting Ensemble: Black Hawk Down\n\n2008 Nominated SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor – TV Movie or Miniseries: Ruffian\n\nBorn Samuel Shepard Rogers IV in Fort Sheridan, Illinois, he worked on a ranch as a teenager. His father, Samuel Shepard Rogers, Jr., was a teacher and farmer who served in the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber pilot during World War II; Shepard has characterized him as “a drinking man, a dedicated alcoholic”. His mother, Jane Elaine (née Schook), was a teacher and a native of Chicago, Illinois. Shepard was forced to support his mother and brother when his father’s farm lapsed into insolvency. After graduating from Duarte High School in 1961, he briefly studied agriculture at Mt. San Antonio College, where he became enamored with the oeuvre of Samuel Beckett, jazz, and abstract expressionism. Shepard soon dropped out to join a touring repertory group, the Bishop’s Company.\n\nAfter securing a position as a busboy at The Village Gate … after winning six Obie Awards between 1966-1968, Shepard emerged as a viable screenwriter … drummed sporadically from 1967 through 1971 with psychedelic folk band The Holy Modal Rounders … (1968).\n\nShepard’s early science fiction play The Unseen Hand (1969) would influence Richard O’Brien’s stage musical The Rocky Horror Show. Cowboy Mouth—a collaboration with then-mistress Patti Smith—was staged for one night at The American Place Theater in April 1971, providing early exposure for the future punk rock singer; seeking to distance himself from Smith and his substance abuse, Shepard relocated with his wife and son to London in the early 1970’s. Returning to America in 1975, he moved to the 20-acre Flying Y Ranch in Mill Valley, California and served for a semester as Regents’ Professor of Drama at the University of California, Davis.\n\nShepard accompanied Bob Dylan on the Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975 as the ostensible screenwriter of the surrealist Renaldo and Clara (1978) … His diary of the tour (Rolling Thunder Logbook) was published by Penguin Books in 1978. A decade later, Dylan and Shepard co-wrote the 11-minute “Brownsville Girl“, included on Dylan’s Knocked Out Loaded (1986) album and later compilations.\n\nIn 1975, he was named playwright-in-residence at the Magic Theatre, where many of his notable works (including his Family Trilogy: Buried Child [1978], Curse of the Starving Class [1978], and True West [1980]) received their premier productions. Some critics expand this grouping to a quintet which includes Fool for Love (1983) and A Lie of the Mind (1985).\n\nShepard began his acting career in earnest when he was cast as the handsome land baron in Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven (1978), opposite Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. This led to other important films and roles, most notably his portrayal of Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff (1983), earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. By 1986, one of his plays, Fool for Love, was being made into a film directed by Robert Altman; his play A Lie of the Mind was Off-Broadway with an all-star cast including Harvey Keitel and Geraldine Page; he was living with Jessica Lange; and he was working steadily as a film actor—all of which put him on the cover of Newsweek magazine.\n\nThroughout the years, Shepard has done a considerable amount of teaching on writing plays and other aspects of theatre. His classes and seminars have occurred at various theatre workshops, festivals, and universities.\n\nShepard was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986.\n\nIn 2000, Shepard decided to repay a debt of gratitude to the Magic Theatre by staging his play The Late Henry Moss as a benefit in San Francisco. The cast included Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, and Cheech Marin. The limited, three-month run was sold out.\n\nIn 2001, Shepard had a notable role of General William F. Garrison in the box office hit and cult classic movie Black Hawk Down. Although he was cast in a supporting role, it reinvigorated interest in Shepard among the public and critics alike.\n\nHe performed Spalding Gray‘s final monologue Life Interrupted for its audio release through Macmillan Audio in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, Shepard contributed banjo to Patti Smith’s cover of Nirvana’s song “Smells Like Teen Spirit” on her album Twelve.\n\nAlthough many artists have had an influence on Shepard’s work, one of the most significant has been actor-director Joseph Chaikin, a veteran of the Living Theatre and founder of a group called the Open Theatre. The two have often worked together on various projects, and Shepard acknowledges that Chaikin has been a valuable mentor.\n\n… publication of the collection Day out of Days: Stories. The book includes “short stories, poems and narrative sketches … that developed from dozens of leather-bound notebooks [Shepard] has carried with him over the years.”\n\nSee you Sam\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nBegins January 20.\n\nMy Favorite Westerns: If you’re going to shoot a Western period piece – in the mountains – in the winter, why not choose the most brutal winter we’ve had in years?? Because that’s exactly what they’ve done with Klondike.\n\nMaybe the weather is different up there in the mountains? but down here in Calgary we’ve had at least 3 blizzards – so far.\n\nSo I gotta believe a lot of the hardships that will be depicted in Klondike won’t require a great deal of acting.\n\nAnticipating a good show – with a lot of snow.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\nReposted from CBC News site:\n\nKlondike series could bring gold rush for Discovery Channel\n\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/klondike-series-could-bring-gold-rush-for-discovery-channel-1.2493724\n\nRichard Madden, Abbie Cornish, Tim Roth among big-name stars\n\nCBC News Posted: Jan 12, 2014 11:46 AM MT Last Updated: Jan 12, 2014 1:01 PM MT\n\nDiscovery Channel is set to launch its first-ever scripted venture, Klondike, in a bid they hope will help them strike it rich with viewers.\n\nThe six-hour, three-night miniseries begins Jan. 20 on Discovery Canada before continuing the following Tuesday and Wednesday. Scottish actor Richard Madden, best-known for his role as the brutally-murdered Robb Stark in HBO’s Game of Thrones, is among multiple high-profile stars who have been in Alberta filming for the series.\n\nAbbie Cornish, Tim Roth, Sam Shepard and Augustus Prew also star, while powerhouse producers Ridley Scott, Paul Scheuring and David Zucker have been working away behind the scenes to bring the series to life.\n\nIt’s all based on Charlotte Gray’s 2010 book, Gold Diggers: Striking It Rich in the Klondike.\n\nOn Thursday, the cast and producers took questions from reporters as part of the semi-annual Television Critics Association press tour.\n\nAccording to Scheuring, who wrote the script, said he wasn’t intimidated to be writing for Shepard, a Pulitzer Prize-winning American playwright, “because the part was written, thank goodness, before he was cast.”\n\nDays of Heaven actor returns\n\nShepard was a last-minute replacement for Chris Cooper, who had to withdraw with an illness right before production was scheduled to begin.\n\nThe 70-year-old actor had worked in Alberta before, memorably on Days of Heaven in 1978.\n\nHe was apparently hard to reach after Cooper pulled out because he was offline and out fishing, something he indulged in while on location in Alberta.\n\n“Some of the biggest cutthroats I’ve ever seen in my life,” Shepard said about fly fishing “way up there on the Athabasca River.”\n\nNo chance of shooting in Dawson City\n\nThe producers say there was never any thought of shooting the series right in Dawson City, despite the fact that the picturesque Yukon town retains much of the look it had back in the gold rush days of the 1890s.\n\nThe usual lure of tax grants and funding — from the Government of Alberta and the Alberta Film Development Program — lured production to Alberta.\n\nAnd it was damn cold, says Brittish-born Prew,\n\nThe actor plays Byron Epstein, who teams up with Madden’s character, Bill Haskell, as the two childhood friends set out to make their fortune along with thousands of others during the peak year of the Klondike gold rush.\n\n“We were in period costumes, no thermals,” Prew said of his experience on location in Alberta last April through July. “I went on holiday right after to Turkey. It was lovely and warm there.”\n\n‘Brutal’ shooting conditions in Rockies\n\nThe cast, producers and crew faced a 40-minute snowmobile ride followed by another 40-minute trek — sometimes by helicopter — for scenes shot in a tiny town high up in the Rocky Mountains, northwest of Calgary.\n\nThere are Canadians in the cast, including Brian Markinson (Da Vinci’s Inquest), who is currently shooting Fargo in Calgary, and Saskatchewan native Michael Greyeyes.\n\nWhile Prew said the relatively isolated mountain-top locales could be “rather meditative,” he won’t miss the 18-hour days.\n\n“I only saw my hotel six hours a night,” he said.\n\nAccording to Zucker, one of the series’ producers, much of the shoot “was brutal. There was so little time to shoot such a big thing and it took four months of 18-hour days.”\n\nDespite that, the real-life struggle and challenges look good on screen.\n\n“We wanted to emphasize that it was miserable,” Zucker said. “A lot of that was in the script and I pushed it even further. It is about the battle with nature and we didn’t want that to look easy.”\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCasting Director, Lynn Kressel won Casting Awards for Streets of Laredo.

Yet I believe All the Pretty Horses is massively under-rated and may fare better in time. The Assassination of Jesse James … ??? the jury is still out. Thunderheart is well known – an entertaining enough movie … but a good Western? Blackthorn could have been Classic, but poor support acting let it down.\n\nVerdict? Streets of Laredo is probably the best Western Sam has ever done. And he’s damn good in it.\n\nShepards’s Westerns\n\n1978 Days of Heaven – with Richard Gere\n\n1992 Thunderheart – with Val Kilmer and Grahame Greene\n\n1995 Streets of Laredo with James Garner\n\n1999 Purgatory with Eric Roberts and Randy Quaid\n\n2000 All the Pretty Horses with Matt Damon\n\n2005 Bandidas with Penélope Cruz and Salma Hayek\n\n2007 The Assassination of Jesse James with Brad Pitt and Casey Affleck\n\n2011 Blackthorn\n\n1994 Silent Tongue / Writer / Director\n\n2014 Klondike with Richard Madden\n\nRandy Quaid\n\nRandy Quaid has been in at least 2 notable Western: The Missouri Breaks and The Long Riders – both pretty highly regarded by most Western Movie fans – some holding them as Minor Classic in quality. In Streets of Laredo he plays the famous gunslinger John Wesley Harding.\n\nQuaid Westerns\n\n1976 The Missouri Breaks with Jack Nicholson and Marlon Brando\n\n1979 The Last Ride of the Dalton Gang\n\n1980 The Long Riders with Dennis Quaid, David Carradine, Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach …\n\n1999 Purgatory wtih Sam Shepard 2004 Home on the Range with Judi Dench, Cuba Gooding Jr., Rosanne Barr …\n\nSissy Spacek\n\nWe probably think Sissy Spacek has been in a few Westerns because she did Coal Minors Daughter (1980) and has done some Country Music singing and writing. But not so. Despite a ton of great work in her acting career, Sissy has done no real Westerns.\n\nShe’s in a great one this time though.\n\nDecent Western roles are tough to find for female actors- mainly because most Westerns are written by – and for – men. But McMurtry is different and Streets of Laredo includes 3 great roles for the ladies – one of which is also an excellent role for a child female actor. Good job Mr. McMurtry.\n\nWes Studi\n\nWes Studi is another actor that has well established himself as a Western Film Icon. His first 2 Westerns are undeniable Westerns Classics: Dances with Wolves and The Last of the Mohicans.\n\nMost everything else he’s done is quality work as well.\n\nWes Studi Westerns\n\n1990 Dances with Wolves with Kevin Costner\n\n1992 The Last of the Mohicans with Daniel Day Lewis\n\n1993 Geronimo: An American Legend with Gene Hackman\n\n1995 Streets of Laredo\n\n1997 Crazy Horse with Ned Beatty\n\n2005 Into the West with Russel Means\n\n2005 Miracle at Sage Creek with David Carradine\n\n2005 The New World with Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale\n\n2007 Seraphim Falls with Pierce Brosnan, Liam Neeson, Anjelica Huston\n\n2007 Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\n\n2008 Comanche Moon with Val Kilmer\n\n2009 Trail of Tears\n\n2011 Hell on Wheels with Colm Meaney\n\n2014 A Million Ways to Die in the West (post-production)\n\n2014 Palominas (pre-production)\n\nCharles Martin Smith\n\nWe wouldn’t normally think of Charles Martin Smith as being a Western Actor but, incredibly, Smith has appeared in at least one bona fide Western Classic: Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and two other worthy Westerns:Culpepper Cattle Co. and The Spikes Gang. That’s 3 out 3 Chuck – Not bad for a green horn.\n\nIn Streets of Laredo, Smith plays the ‘everyday man’ – that’s you and me – the guy we’re supposed to relate with. His character can’t handle the rugged and vicious Western world he suddenly finds himself in – and makes us wonder if we could cut it either. Possibly not.\n\nCharles Martin Smith Westerns\n\n1972 The Culpepper Cattle Co.\n\n1973 Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid\n\n1974 The Spikes Gang\n\nSonia Braga\n\nBrazilian actress and International Film Star, Sonia Braga has 75 film credits to her name.\n\nAnd when you see here performance in Streets of Laredo, it’s hard to believe she too has no Westerns among them.\n\nShe was Nominated forNCLR Bravo Award 1996 for her performance in Streets of Laredo.\n\nNed Beaty\n\nIn Streets of Laredo, Ned Beaty is well recognized – even with his Santa Claus beard. Beaty is another actor we are surprised to find has made very few Westerns – in his long career where he has appeared in over 100 films – and has been nominated for an Academy Award, two Emmy Awards, an MTV Movie Award and a Golden Globe Award; he won a Drama Desk Award also.\n\nBut he’s done a couple.\n\n2011 Rango\n\n1996 Crazy Horse\n\n1994 Outlaws: The Legend of O.B. Taggart\n\n1975 Gunsmoke (TV)\n\n1972 The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean with Paul Newman\n\nGeorge Carlin\n\nYou might have to shake your head for a second when you see George Carlin in Streets of Laredo. The second surprise is that he does a hell of job. Completely believable and in command of his part. Makes you wish he’d done more.\n\nVanessa Martinez\n\nVanessa Martinez is that 3rd female role I was talking about – playing Sonia Braga’s blind daughter. She is superb – and we wonder why we haven’t seen more of her either ??\n\nAlexis Cruz\n\nAn unlikely badguy we may think – almost baby faced. But Cruz is ominous and lethal as the psychopathic killer tracked by Garner. Yet another actor we’ve seen little of since Laredo.\n\nThough still active in TV and Film, Cruz seems to have fallen from view.\n\nAlexis Cruz Westerns:\n\n1997 The Brave (A Western?)

And I like it.\n\nLarry McMurtry’s Streets of Laredo • Official Trailer • Miniseries\n\nI have no problem understanding what people like about McMurtry’s writings: Lonesome Dove (1986 Pulitzer Prize winner) etc. of which Streets of Laredo is part of his enduring saga of Woodrow Call – and others – It’s the people in his stories. They are fully realized and believable. Real. And we like them and admire them. His people are honest, hard working, caring, loyal, honest … good people. Not perfect in any way – but good. They have standards and they have a code – and they stick by – and stick together. We come to care about them and relate quite a bit with them – I hope. McMurty’s stories are good too – filled with these interesting characters and his great knack for excellent dialogue. No problem finding quotes in his writing.\n\nStreets of Laredo is excellent. Streets of Laredo starts out with a coyote howling in the sunset and plaintive death march of the song Streets of Laredo … giving a sense of loss – that something is ending rather than beginning. And in the opening scene we see the no longer young Woodrow Call (Garner) preparing for a journey … his last quest ??\n\nPosters\n\nThey don’t usually make many posters and such for TV events (tell that to Game of Thrones) so we often have to rely on DVD covers and the like for any promotional images. As such:\n\nNotice anything about one of these DVD images?\n\nIt’s reversed. Yes. This is something that you encounter\n\nvery often on the internet – reversed images. Why? I don’t know.\n\nIt’s annoying. For one thing it’s dishonest. Secondly, sometimes\n\nyou can’t tell which is the honest/correct/original image.\n\nWhy do people do this? It can’t be done accidentally.\n\nIt’s a head scratcher … ??\n\nReviews\n\nSTREETS OF LAREDO – DVD review\n\nI was completely caught up in this gritty Western.\n\nhttp://moviemet.com/review/streets-laredo-dvd-review#.UrWy6tJDtwA\n\nJames Plath\n\nWednesday, May 5, 2010 – 12:00 am\n\n” … a considerably better-than-average Western . . . even if it isn’t quite the same caliber as “Lonesome Dove.” It hooked me right from the beginning, and that’s worth something. Like the best mini-series, “Streets of Laredo” depends upon strong characters to make the difference, and they do.”\n\n“Alexis Cruz does a fantastic job as the child killer, but so does Randy Quaid as John Wesley Hardin and Ned Beatty as the self-appointed law west of the Pecos, Judge Roy Bean. Even comedian George Carlin turns in a decent performance as grizzled carryover from “Lonesome Dove.”\n\nBottom Line: As a stand-alone mini-series, “Streets of Laredo” merits a high 7 to a low 8 out of 10. As a sequel? It’s probably not going to satisfy anyone looking for consistency from film to film. But I think the first point trumps the second. Always.”\n\n______________________________\n\nIf interested in finding Streets of Laredo you’ll have no problem – it’s freely available on YouTube – all 3 parts in blazing Hi Res that you can watch right on your computer – though I downloaded it and Rose and I enjoyed watching it on her big screen TV.\n\nThat’s enough for today …\n\nComing Up …\n\nStreets of Laredo: The Cast\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nSam Shepard\n\nActor, Director, Playwrite, Author, Pulitzer Prize Winner …\n\nSoon appearing in Discovery Channel’s miniseries KLONDIKE\n\n“I don’t have a computer.

His father, Samuel Shepard Rogers, Jr., was a teacher and farmer who served in the United States Army Air Forces as a bomber pilot during World War II; Shepard has characterized him as “a drinking man, a dedicated alcoholic”. His mother, Jane Elaine (née Schook), was a teacher and a native of Chicago, Illinois. Shepard was forced to support his mother and brother when his father’s farm lapsed into insolvency. After graduating from Duarte High School in 1961, he briefly studied agriculture at Mt. San Antonio College, where he became enamored with the oeuvre of Samuel Beckett, jazz, and abstract expressionism. Shepard soon dropped out to join a touring repertory group, the Bishop’s Company.\n\nAfter securing a position as a busboy at The Village Gate … after winning six Obie Awards between 1966-1968, Shepard emerged as a viable screenwriter … drummed sporadically from 1967 through 1971 with psychedelic folk band The Holy Modal Rounders … (1968).\n\nShepard’s early science fiction play The Unseen Hand (1969) would influence Richard O’Brien’s stage musical The Rocky Horror Show. Cowboy Mouth—a collaboration with then-mistress Patti Smith—was staged for one night at The American Place Theater in April 1971, providing early exposure for the future punk rock singer; seeking to distance himself from Smith and his substance abuse, Shepard relocated with his wife and son to London in the early 1970s. Returning to America in 1975, he moved to the 20-acre Flying Y Ranch in Mill Valley, California and served for a semester as Regents’ Professor of Drama at the University of California, Davis.\n\nShepard accompanied Bob Dylan on the Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975 as the ostensible screenwriter of the surrealist Renaldo and Clara (1978) … His diary of the tour (Rolling Thunder Logbook) was published by Penguin Books in 1978. A decade later, Dylan and Shepard co-wrote the 11-minute “Brownsville Girl“, included on Dylan’s Knocked Out Loaded (1986) album and later compilations.\n\nIn 1975, he was named playwright-in-residence at the Magic Theatre, where many of his notable works (including his Family Trilogy: Buried Child [1978], Curse of the Starving Class [1978], and True West [1980]) received their premier productions. Some critics expand this grouping to a quintet which includes Fool for Love (1983) and A Lie of the Mind (1985).\n\nShepard began his acting career in earnest when he was cast as the handsome land baron in Terrence Malick’s Days of Heaven (1978), opposite Richard Gere and Brooke Adams. This led to other important films and roles, most notably his portrayal of Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff(1983), earning him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. By 1986, one of his plays, Fool for Love, was being made into a film directed by Robert Altman; his play A Lie of the Mind was Off-Broadway with an all-star cast including Harvey Keitel and Geraldine Page; he was living with Jessica Lange; and he was working steadily as a film actor—all of which put him on the cover of Newsweek magazine.\n\nThroughout the years, Shepard has done a considerable amount of teaching on writing plays and other aspects of theatre. His classes and seminars have occurred at various theatre workshops, festivals, and universities.\n\nShepard was elected to The American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1986. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1986.\n\nIn 2000, Shepard decided to repay a debt of gratitude to the Magic Theatre by staging his play The Late Henry Moss as a benefit in San Francisco. The cast included Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, and Cheech Marin. The limited, three-month run was sold out.\n\nIn 2001, Shepard had a notable role of General William F. Garrison in the box office hit and cult classic movie Black Hawk Down. Although he was cast in a supporting role, it reinvigorated interest in Shepard among the public and critics alike.\n\nHe performed Spalding Gray‘s final monologue Life Interrupted for its audio release through Macmillan Audio in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, Shepard contributed banjo to Patti Smith’s cover of Nirvana’s song “Smells Like Teen Spirit” on her album Twelve.\n\nAlthough many artists have had an influence on Shepard’s work, one of the most significant has been actor-director Joseph Chaikin, a veteran of the Living Theatre and founder of a group called the Open Theatre. The two have often worked together on various projects, and Shepard acknowledges that Chaikin has been a valuable mentor.\n\n… publication of the collection Day out of Days: Stories. The book includes “short stories, poems and narrative sketches … that developed from dozens of leather-bound notebooks [Shepard] has carried with him over the years.”\n\nShepard starred in the 2011 Western film Blackthorn.\n\nWestern Films:\n\n1995 / Streets of Laredo\n\n1999 / Purgatory\n\n2000 / All the Pretty Horses\n\n2005 / Bandidas\n\n2007 / The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\n\n2011 / Blackthorn\n\n2013 / Klondike – miniseries in post production\n\n51.037434-114.052028\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
