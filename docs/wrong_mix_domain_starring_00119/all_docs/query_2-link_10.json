        "text": "Blackthorn and Don't Come Knocking\n\n* * * * *\n\nFrom actor Val Kilmer (who starred in 3 films with Sam):\n\n\"I keep thinking about dear old Sam... I'd always needed to be able to at least half way decently rope a horse, as you need to do on occasion when you own 6,000 acres and 50 some horses at one point. And he LOVED roping. It was as if roping was magic and he could do it and everyone loved it when he did it.\"\n\n\"When we did our first film together (Thunderheart), I immediately bought a plastic yearling skull model with two metal spikes out the neck of the skull one stabs into a bail of hay to practice roping. And I tore my little actor fingers off roping that black plastic calf head until I was over 50% at least. I can't tell you how happy he was to see the improvement over the weeks and months out there in the Badlands of South Dakota. He would grin. Which he didn't do that often. Not back then. When we became actual friends, he'd smile and grin often.\"\n\nTotier Creek Farm near Midway, KY\n\nShepard bought his farm in 2000, keeping cutting horses and cattle on it while boarding his mares at nearby Nuckols Farm. He loved breeding thoroughbreds. In a 2007 interview, he said, \"I plan all the matings and never talk to bloodstock agents. I spend endless hours poring over pedigrees, but some of the best horses I've bred came from instinct.\"\n\n\"Blackthorn\" (2011)\n\n* * * * *\n\n\"I loved Sam. He has been a huge part of my life, who I am, and he will remain so. I will let others talk about the importance and beauty of his work in theater and film.\" ...Actor Ed Harris\n\n\"From the day Sam Shepard hit New York to the day he died, his image was always in line; the music of his plays - the fantasy rhymes - sussed the spiritual impasse of his generation.\" ...John Lahr, The New Yorker\n\n\"I think the last time I saw him was last year on opening night for a Buried Child revival at Signature. I hadnt realized he was ill, but he was having difficulty handling objects. I grieve his loss, celebrate his life and work, and give thanks for my part in it.\" ...Actress Lois Smith\n\n\"Sam Shepard was one of the last myths of the American West, John Ford's melancholy-rebellious son. He has bridged bridges between rural and urban America, they were hardly viable for a whole society, but they were to be crossed for individuals. But at least. Now the gulf between Prairie Home and Big City is as big as never before. And no Sam Shepard anymore.\" ...Georg Seeßlen, Zeit Online\n\n\"Sam Shepard's snaggle-toothed smile, craggy good looks and outlaw style as actor and writer made him an American icon in the mold of Gary Cooper and Marlon Brando.\" ...Jeremy Gerard, Deadline\n\n\"He was a poet of the first order. I've acted in many of his plays and directed 'A Lie of the Mind'. He played my father twice on film. Some days he could be irascible. At other times he could be profoundly wise and kind. He was the writer any serious American actor of my generation cut their teeth on. It is a gross understatement to say, he will be missed.\" ...Actor/director Ethan Hawke\n\nBuried Child' will certainly go down as one of the great works of 20th-century drama, a scathing endgame for American values and emblematic of Shepards lifelong fascination with the harrowing fragility of family bonds.\" ...Peter Marks, The Washington Post\n\n\"For more than half a century, playwright Sam Shepard stood as a towering presence in American theater and cinema, penning dozens of plays and earning an Oscar nomination as an actor in his own right. Delving deeply into the complicated, often bleak nature of family life, the Pulitzer Prize winner earned the title  in drama critic Jack Kroll's words  of 'poet laureate of America's emotional badlands.'\" ...Charles Sykes, NPR\n\n\"At about the time his playwriting was beginning to peak, he did something one would have never imagined O'Neill or Williams doing: He became a romantic movie lead. The shift was so unexpected that many of his fans in the theater thought it had to be somebody else when his name appeared with Richard Gere's and Brooke Adams' among the leads in 'Days of Heaven'... but his on-screen magnetism was powerful enough to match, if not overpower, Gere's own.\" ...Film critic Gene Seymour\n\n\"Shepard was that perfect bundle of contradictions that only an artist could ever justify: Someone who craved privacy and outwardly resented the opposite and yet acted in movies and revealed his rawest truths on the pages of his plays. Or perhaps he wasn't so oblique after all  just too complicated for the Hollywood celebrity machine.\" ...Lindsey Bahr, QCOnline.com\n\nEveryone remembers the moment that Shepard opened a door for them that theyve been walking through for the rest of their career. If you still havent walked through that door, start with 'Buried Child', move onto 'Fool for Love' or 'True West', and then drift along, like a cowboy poet, through the vast expanse of his America, fractured, at risk of forgetting itself, grasping towards the ineffable with heartbreak and grace.\" ...Isaac Butler, Slate magazine\n\n\"It is probably no accident that his written work and onscreen presence fascinated European directors like Michelangelo Antonioni and Wim Wenders: In his understated masculinity he was a throwback, an endangered species. He seemed vaguely tortured, and he wasnt about to tell you why.\" ...Jim Windorf, NY Times\n\n\"Throughout all his various works and appearances, Shepard established a (perhaps unwanted) iconic status. Attractive and rustically 'all American' in a way that seemed stolen from a Dorothea Lange photo, yet a cultural renegade, Shepard offered a certain weathered appeal to members of his generation and beyond.\" ...Gabriel Bell, Salon magazine\n\n* * * * *\n\nHere is a rare photo of Sam with O-Lan Jones on their wedding day in 1969 in New York City. They were married for 14 years."
