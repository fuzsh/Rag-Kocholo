Prop me up....

Ready to torque the prop, but not sure how much.

The bolt diameter is 7/16.

Found the following but not sure my answer is in there:

Thank you,

Trent,

I had a Sterba on my RV4 and owned Kenny’s Sonerai previously. The bolt size denotes the torque value and the 7/16” bolts on the 0-320 should be 19-23 ft lbs. Here is a wood prop torque value chart.

I didn’t like how my 3/8” bolts became “loose”in less than 25 hours so I drilled my prop to 1/2”, installed the larger bolts and crush plate from Saber MFG and bumped the torque to 25 ft lbs. They would hold torque until a 50hr oil change afterward. Additionally every year during the CI I would refinish it with spray Spar Varnish from Lowe’s. Ed makes a great prop for a very reasonable price, keep an eye out for cracks along the grain, delamination and keep it properly torqued and varnished. It will serve you well.

Eventually I sold the Sterba on my RV4 in lieu of installing a composite test prop from a little known (at that time) prop maker named Craig Catto.

The rest as they say is history....
