        "text": "Thanks for the good data. After reading the failure report it seems clear to me that the failure was the front prop. Then the vibration adversely affected the rear engine/prop. Also if I interpret it correctly it was the engine mount that started the chain reaction, not necessarily the prop.\n\nDidn't he say that they redesigned the engine mounts? The plane then flew around the world with a pusher and a tractor. Though it cruised with only the rear engine if I remember correctly.\n\nAnd, he said that he doesn't recommend an CS prop on any experimental airplane, I assume front or rear. There are a lot of other canards with all kinds of variable pitch props tacked on the rear.\n\nAlso, the CAA/FAA approved method of testing a new prop design is known as a \"Whirl Test\". I don't have the details in front of me at this time but I think it calls for some number of hours of flight test. Other test says that the propeller/blade retention, etc., shall be tested to twice the calculated stress and it shall not fail. I don't think it says how much above twice the stress it is allowed to break. But the retention system on my props works out to be way above that.\n\nI did calculations on how much force was created with a typical blade weighing 6,5#, turning at 2800 rpm. The numbers are something like this. Centrifugal for 20,000#. There are 15 screws holding the blade in the hub. Extensive pull tests, destruct test, shows that with the old original screws made of SAE 3035 carbon steel, the screw would break at about 6000# of pull stress. My new steel screws break at about 8000# of pull stress. That works out to about 120,000#. A very good safety of margin over the FAR requirements.\n\nBut even that doesn't mean that you can't destroy a prop. I have one customer that called in a guy to dynamically balance his prop. He brought the prop to me along with a disc about 10\" diameter with over 4 oz of weight added to one side, said it vibrates like hell. I put the prop on my balance stand, sans the added weight his prop balance guy put on it and found it to be in balance. I opened the prop up and found 5 broken screws. The four plus oz of weights the guy put on the prop almost destroyed it.\n\nStatic balance is a valid balance. You can't unbalance a prop to balance an engine. You can usually get by doing that with a fixed pitch prop but not with a variable pitch prop simply because the variable pitch hub can't be made as strong as solid metal or wood for that matter. But even then I often hear of a guy slinging the metal tip off his prop.\n\nIf someone starts stacking weights on one of my props, he has voided any warrantee, written or implied.\n\nProp clocking on the crankshaft is important. I think I sent an article I picked up from the journal \"Coupe Capers\", to one of your canard folks a publication of the Ercoupe folks. It has a very good article on vibration problems as a result of clocking of the prop in relation to crank throw. especially for four cylinder engines. You will notice that Hartzell, McCauly and others, in conjunction with the engine folks, makes it such that their prop can be installed in only a certain way. The Aeromatic can be installed at any one of several clockings.\n\nMy new screw design is made of a newer steel, SAE 8720. They break at 8,000# +/- 10%. I have to check that my memory about the steel is correct. The old steel Rockwelled out at about 6000PSI, the new steel Rockwells out at about 8000PSI.\n\nI think it is FAR part 35 that details this information. I think the old CAR part was part 17, I'll check it at work, I can't get into my IA library here at home for some reason.\n\nHere is the certification requirements for prop cert from the original Civil Aeronautic Admin. The Aeromatic was certified under these rules.\n\n(1) A 100-hour endurance test shall be conducted on an engine of the same power and rotational speed characteristics as the engine or engines with which the propeller is intended to be used. The endurance test shall be conducted at the maximum continuous rotational speed and power rating of the propeller, except that, in the event a rotational speed(s) and power condition(s) is found to be critical on the basis of the vibration test prescribed in § 14.152, such portion of the 100 hours as the Administrator\n\nfinds necessary, but not in excess of 50 hours, shall be conducted at the critical rotational speed(s) and power condition(s). If a take-off rating greater than the maximum continuous rating is to be established, a 10-hour block test in addition to the 100 hours shall be conducted at the maximum power and rotational speed for the take-off\n\nrating.\n\n(2) The propeller shall be operated throouugth the engine endurance tests prescribed in Part 13 of this subchapter.\n\n§ 14.154 Functional test. Variable-pitch propellers shall be subjected to the following functional tests as applicable. The same propeller as used in the endurance test shall be used in the functional tests and shall be driven by an engine mounted on a test stand or on an aircraft. (a) Manually controllable propellers. 500 complete cycles of control shall be applied throughout the pitch and rotational speed ranges.\n\n(b) Automatically controllable propellers. 1,500 complete cycles of control by means of automatic control mechanism shall be applied throughout the pitch and rotational speed ranges.\n\n© Feathering propellers. 50 cycles of feathering operation shall be applied.\n\n(d) Reversible-pitch propellers. 200 complete cycles of control shall be applied from the lowest normal pitch to the maximum reverse pitch. At the end of each cycle the propeller shall be operated in reverse pitch for a period of one minute at the reverse pitch maximum rotational speed and power.\n\n§ 14.155 Special tests. Such tests shall be conducted as the Administrator finds necessary to substantiate the use of any unconventional features of design, material, or construction.\n\n§ 14.156 Teardown inspection. After completion of the tests, the propeller shall be completely disassembled and a detailed inspection shall be made of the propeller parts to check for fatigue, wear, and distortion.\n\n§ 14.157 Propeller adjustments and parts replacements. During the tests servicing and minor repairs of the propeller shall be permissible. If major repairs or replacement of parts are found necessary during the tests or in the teardown inspection, the parts in question shall be subjected to such additional tests as are found by the Administrator to be necessary.\n\n[F.R. Doc. 56-10369: Filed, Dec. 19, 1956; 8:50 a.m\n\nEdited January 29, 2016 by Kent\n\nThey don't object to the prop, they object to me. I got into an argument with Seattle MIDO about my supposed oversight and auditing of my paint supplier. The rules say that I shall have oversight and audit any supplier that makes anything or does anything to my drawing, specifications or procedures. I was buying paint from NAPA. NAPA doesn't make anything to my spec. I buy the paint made to their spec. Then the SEA MIDO idiot told me, \"OK from now own you have to get a signed statement from the store owner or the store manages that says, 'The paint you have in you hand is the paint that is on the sales slip\".\n\nI told him how I was handling the situation when I was under Van Nuys MIDO. He said words to this effect, \"Well, we don't run the Van Nuys MIDO, this is what you will have to do from now on\".\n\nThis is about 2% of the sh*t the FAA has put on me. These people are drunk on Power of The FAAA.\n\nAnd BTW, the MIDO dingbat was an Ex employee of Cirrus Aircraft Co. He wrecked a new airplane of theirs, landed it about 20 feet above the runway, retracted the landing gear through the winds and broke the tail cone off. Now he works for the FAA. And that ding bat actually displayed joy about screwing up. Maybe he was joyous about getting a fat paying job with the FAAA.\n\nSeems like the FAAA seeks out the people that can't make it in the filed.\n\nThe other 98% would take the size of a thick book. But here is another 2%. First Article Conformity Inspection.\n\nHere is how that went down.\n\nFAAA; \"You can't do your own inspection, you have to hire an independent testing laboratory to do the FACI\".\n\nMe; \"OK, give me a list of FAA certified independent testing laboratories\".\n\nFAA, \"There aren't any, we don't certify them\".\n\nMe: \"OK, since you are a member of the FAA Manufacturing Inspection District Office, come down here and witness the inspection\".\n\nFAA; \"We don't have the budget to go down there and witness an inspection, you have to hire a DER/DAR to do that\".\n\nMe; \"According to your certified mail to me, you found budget to send auditors down here and spend two days auditing me in my 1500 sq/ft facility\".\n\nFAA; \"You have to hire a DAR to witness the FACI.\n\nSo, I flew down to Lancaster, CA., picked up my DAR. (He was a retired FAA MIDO inspector} I flew him up to Carson City, NV. I had cut a deal with Rick Clemens, owner of Specline.com, We used his QA laboratory. My DAR and I spent about 30 minutes inspecting the part. I flew him back to Lancaster. He charges $50 per hour from door to door. He gave me a discount and only charges me $300 for the half hour inspection and his time away from home. The fuel bill for my Geronimo was over $1000. So, with all the delays and jerking around that half hour inspection cost me just shy of $3000.\n\nI am not going to take up the space and time to write a book on this crap. I do think I shall get to hell out of the certified propeller business. It just isn't worth it to me."
