I know Pro Pilots went through the hassle of getting the STC for the super cub. Did you also do it? If so, what STC ## is it?\n\nIs there a fixed pitch MT STC in the works for the super cub???\n\nTim\n\nDW said:\n\nJohn I would sure like to see you guys do a fixed pitch for the super cub and the 0320, (it's all about weight)\n\nDW\n\nI'll second that request\n\nor\n\nAnyone know about the potential for a ground adj. 3 blade composite like the LS guys are using for a 150hp SC?\n\nKirby\n\nThe max diameter MT will build a certified fixed pitch prop is 74\". They do not want life limits imposed on any of their props, and at 74\" there is no vibration issues that would limit life on the TCDS. Weight of that prop is 16 pounds. It has a wood core, Kevlar cover and stainless steel leading edge. It is priced at $2500 including delivery to your door. If anyone out there who want's to pursue an STC, we will be happy to provide the vib data. You will also need to then do a full set of flight tests, noise tests, write a AFMS, Installation Manual, Instruction for Continued Airworthiness and expect FAA to take about a year+ to review and sign off on the STC. If you get it, you can charge what ever you want for each STC and you will be able to buy the props at a bit of a discount from MT direct.\n\nSounds like fun doesn't it?? .\n\nJohn\n\nJohnNielsen said:\n\nThe max diameter MT will build a certified fixed pitch prop is 74\".

Is there anything already designed, but without an stc?\n\nTim\n\nTim,\n\nThis question came up last year. The answer is yes and no.\n\nThere is an MT FP prop designed for this application. It is not STC'd, but it is a FAA certified 'wooden propeller'.\n\nSome aircraft TCDS's written under CAR 3 provide a very open wording about props, usually only defining max static rpm and diameter. If that is the case on your plane, you can bolt on any certified wooden prop that fits that limitation with nothing more than a log book entry and 337 and W&B entry. My 1948 C170 with C-145 is an example of that.\n\nJohn\n\nJohnNielsen said:\n\nTim,\n\nThis question came up last year.

I also will have to look at our 0-300 powered 172 and see if it has a \"any wooden prop\" listed.\n\nTim\n\nJohnNielsen said:\n\nTim,\n\nThis question came up last year.

My 1948 C170 with C-145 is an example of that.\n\nJohn\n\nJohn,\n\nI've been curious about the MT fixed pitch props for some time. The TC'd version for the small Continentals will work for any number of older Cubs, Champs, Luscombes, Taylorcrafts, etc. yet I have not seen any of these props in use. A friend has a FP MT on his Stearman and the performance increase over the wood Sensenich it replaced is marked.\n\nHave you guys sold any of the FP props to small Continental aircraft owners? Do you have any info on performance using the MT FP props on any of the A-65 thru O-200 powered airplanes mentioned above?\n\nDan\n\nMy guess is the cost of $2500 (delivered) vs <$1000 for a used metal prop. Dad often said: \"many pilots will 'tear a pair of $100 pants to pick up a dime'.\n\nSecond guess is there is no performance numbers and absolutely no guarantees. Like any experimental application, you get what you get and must buy it with that in mind. These same owners do not think like the typical experimental buyer.\n\nWe are ready to take your orders, but there is no assurance of performance gains. I replaced the FP wood prop on my O-320 RV6 with a MT. Picked up 22mph in low alt cruise and increased ROC. Measured static thrust was 22% higher with the MT than the Sterba wood prop.\n\nJohn\n\nI'd like to see a side by side comparison of the 74\" FP MT versus the 82\" McCauley. If the MT is a much more efficient design, then if the same performance could be had from a smaller diameter prop at around the same price point. The big benefit that I see would be less erosion and FOD damage from off airport and seaplane ops.\n\nI've looked at the Prince and Catto experimental props and while they boast impressive performance claims, I don't think I could bring myself to land off-airport or on water with one as they don't have a metal leading edge. Plus they just don't look very sexy.\n\nMT Prop\n\nI have a PA-12 with a factory new O-320 B2B, Flaps, Floats and wheel/skis, and Standard length gear.\n\nI really want to go to a three blade composite with an electric governor. It would replace my Borer 82/43. Because I come out of a small lake here in the states, I need initial thrust performance within 10% of the Borer.\n\nTalking to Propilots and MT themselves, my setup will be at least as heavy as the Borer, probably heavier, and 6 - 7 times more expense. I don't like the two blade products.\n\nI fly in the flatlands of the upper midwest with typical flights to fishing on big Canadian lakes 500 miles or more from home, so I hope to keep the airspeed up and deep into the yellow arc.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nNice, I like the input. I have been maintaining an American Champ Ultimate Adventure and it had some major problems. First, the prop delaminated and we got MT to fix it, and then after it started to come loose like after a few hours. We had to re torque it every 10 hours for several months, Mostly cause of the wood core and we are in a very dry environment but still. It became loose in flight several times just going around the patch. But with that all said its working out fine know, but were just keeping a close eye on it. I like there performance and its a great idea, but in my opinion there very needy props compared to a good metal prop. A aluminum prop can be installed and almost forgotten about, very convenient for off airport operations.\n\nWow. I have not had anything like that kind of experience with the two MT props I have had on my plane. They have been as \"set it and forget it\" as any metal prop I have had, and the repair of nicks, etc, is easier than metal since there is no filing involved.\n\nsj\n\nRe: MT Prop\n\nSTMAWR14 said:\n\nI really want to go to a three blade composite with an electric governor.\n\nI don't like the two blade products.\n\nWhy are you determined to go to a three-bladed prop? I thought more blades = more thrust, but I've since learned that isn't the case: it's prop diameter that counts for our planes.\n\nI have the Hartzel constant speed prop on my -12, and love it. Unfortunately I don't operate off floats, so I can't give you a before and after comparison, but Brian did measure the static thrust and I'm sure he can give you the figures.\n\nMaybe we can get together this spring and you can fly mine to see how it feels.\n\nEric"
