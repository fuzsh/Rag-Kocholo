        "text": "Today, we tested 2 Sonerai 2. One has been flying the other is ready to. The one flying has a 2276 & pulled 245lbs on the pull scale at 2800 RPM, 52x48 (with a lot of blade area). The one getting ready to fly has a 1850 & pulled 170 lbs, 52x42.\n\nWhat does all mean for these pilots? I am a Continental guy & I could not answer their questions. They want to know if these numbers are safe.\n\nThe 53x42 was flying on a Sonerai2 for many years. The 52x48 with a lot of blade area is on a plane that has been flying for a while. It is the Sonerai painted with blue NAVY paint with yellow trim. He bought it used last year.\n\nIvan\n\nHi Guys\n\nin my opinion 2800 rpm for a 2276 spinning a 52 x 48 prop is not enough.\n\nsomething must be wrong...\n\nhave a serious look at timing and valve clearance, and so on...remember that if you want the full potential of this 2276 it must turn the rpm at which this HP is rated 3400 in this case\n\nMy 2276 spinning a 54 x 52 prop reached 3350rpm static and can reach 3500 rpm when spinning my old 54 x 40 prop...\n\nthese are numbers dating from early summer 2008.\n\nnow(2010) my 2276 spins my modified 54x52 that was reduced to 53\" x about 45\"...\n\nas of yesterday,I reached about 1300 to 1400 ft/min at around 100 mph solo in rough air...\n\nis is pretty near what I expected from this prop...\n\ntoday I flew with a passenger and performance was very satisfying,but I didn't note any figures...\n\nstatic numbers were not recorded yet but this will be done as soon as I can,maybe tomorrow or early next week.\n\nmy feeling is the the static RPM is somewhere near 3250rpm...\n\nHope this helps\n\nGaston\n\nHi Ivan\n\ndon't read this comment as a blame on your friends\n\nI only mean it to be constructive...\n\nyou asked if we thought these numbers were safe\n\nI just gave you the numbers I get with mine,as a reference.\n\nI sure agree with you that the blade area must be considered as well as the pitch in itself...\n\nthe question is is the prop adequate for the engine ???\n\nwe don't know what kind of prop it is\n\nbut the fact is that the engine, if in good condition, is probably over pitched.\n\nyou talked about safety, my opinion is that 2800 static rpm is not safe for me unless I am aware of the condition that causes this low output,considered and calculated risk ,is in itself safer than neglected or ignored risk, but is is another very very long story...but I'm not sure I would take it to the air...\n\n2800 static rpm would be great for a Continental or Lycoming,but is on the low side for a VW.\n\nmost of the time Static RPM is higher than full power rpm at take off so what will be left for the takeoff run and climb out...\n\nHow much HP will be available compared to the theoretical 80 HP available at 3600 rpm\n\nI guess the max obtainable rpm and speed in level flight are not very high and that MP is very high in relation to rpm...\n\nwhat are the climb rpm/speed/ & RoC\n\nI'm still only guessing but this sonerai probably never flew with two peoples on board...right ??\n\nI flew an overpitched 1835 for a few years before I realised the real pitch of this prop was much greater that what was stamped on the prop...\n\nperformance numbers were not that bad ,but what a terrific difference it made when I decided to reduce the pitch...a new life began\n\nHope this may help\n\nGaston"
