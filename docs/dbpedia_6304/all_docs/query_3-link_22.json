Now I have a question about props. Just say I have a pile of wood props to look at. How do you tell a pusher configuration prop from a tractor configuration prop? A few of the props I can't tell how they were bolted up because it looks like they had used a metal plate on both sides. I don't know if the impression is from the prop flange or the crush plate. So, can a tractor prop be used in a pusher type application and vise versa? And what side is the specification numbers usually stamped, the flange side or plate side? Thanks!\n\nDoug Riley\n\nPlatinum Member\n\nJoined\n\nJan 11, 2004\n\nMessages\n\n7,061\n\nJul 22, 2008\n\n#2\n\nMark, in my experience it depends on the manufacturer. Most do not distinguish between pusher and tractor props; as long as you get the blades facing the right way you can mount it on whichever end of the engine you like.\n\nSome, such the old Troyer wood props, were built with extra wood on the flange side. This may have been for no better reason than to clear the exhaust pipes or other nearby pieces of the engine. In any event, those props aren't very reversible.\n\nBob Gregory\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nDec 16, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n135\n\nLocation\n\nSpringfield, MO\n\nJul 23, 2008\n\n#3\n\nPropellers are left handed and right handed as viewed from the tail.\n\nA right hand propeller goes down on the right.\n\nThey have length and pitch.\n\nPitch is the angle at 75% of the radius.\n\nUsually set at 9 to 13 degrees to achieve a certain rpm for horsepower.\n\nIt is more important to know the direction the engine turns.\n\nA Rotax two cycle, McCulloch turns to the right on a tractor.\n\nA belt drive demands a right hand propeller.\n\nA gear drive demands a left hand propeller.\n\nA Rotax two cycle, McCulloch turns to the left on a pusher.\n\nA belt drive demands a left hand propeller.\n\nA gear drive demands a right hand propeller.\n\nA Volkswagen turns to the left on a tractor.\n\nA belt drive demands a left hand propeller.\n\nA gear drive demands a right hand propeller.\n\nA Volkswagen turns to the right on a pusher.\n\nA belt drive demands a right hand propeller.\n\nA gear drive demands a left hand propeller.\n\nLast edited: Jul 23, 2008\n\nM.

I have just always heard folks say that their prop that they are selling is either pusher or tractor application. I figured just maybe there was a difference in airfoil or width of the blade or something. I know a tractor prop gets clean air and a pusher prop usually has turbulint air to contend with. I figured maybe one was made different than the other because of this, like maybe a wider cord for the pusher prop like I have seen on some older airboats or older gyro's. The engine I have is a subaru EA81 and it does have a home built belt reduction. Thank you for your explanation and answers to my question!\n\nM.

Looking at all the older pusher props, they look massive compaired to todays standards. They must have been way over engineered for what they put em on. Makes me wonder what those old timer builders were afraid of. Thank you!\n\nBob Gregory\n\nMember\n\nJoined\n\nDec 16, 2005\n\nMessages\n\n135\n\nLocation\n\nSpringfield, MO\n\nJul 25, 2008\n\n#6\n\nIn the eighties I heard that all pusher propellers had to be square tipped.\n\nThen they said they had to have a rounded leading edge tip with square trailing edge to achieve less drag. A Gerbers baby lid pattern was to be used for the round part.\n\nNow I am seeing propellers, wings, and stabilizers of the latest designs with tips cut off at the leading edge and the trailing edge longer by about a thirty four degree angle. The idea is to create the smallest vortices for drag resistance. I think too, it would tend to stabilize the tip for less flutter.\n\nI trimmed the leading edge of a thick Warp once to get more rpm. Shaped like a P-51 Mustang wing. Found out Sterba Propellers had been doing it for years. Never, ever, shorten a propeller for more rpm.\n\nThanks for the reply."
