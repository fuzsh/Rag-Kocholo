        "text": "Hi all\n\nlast winter ,I rebuilt the leading edge of my old propeller using epoxy.\n\nthe goal was to restore the profile of the prop so it could be usable as a guide to modify the 54X52 prop I've been working on for a while.\n\nwhile the mod is in progress ,I install this prop(epoxy),and proceed with comparison with the more recent mod done to the 54X52 prop...\n\ntoday ,as a friend of mine was to fly with me in preparation to flying his S1 in a very near future,I had this prop installed as I know this prop is still better in climb than my newer prop, for now...\n\nwe had a great flight ,with terrific performance on take off,climb,cruise and doing a few touch & go.\n\nthen as we were hungry we landed for a lunch before another flight...\n\nright after engine shut off,as I had a look at the prop,I had the sad surprise of finding the epoxy had deformed ,was sticky and was hot to the touch.when we came back from lunch it was hard as supposed ,and the sticky touch was gone as well as the high temp sensation.\n\nI repaired again using epoxy and after a while proceeded for a full power run up,and found the epoxy repair to be deformed again and sticky.\n\nthe soft & sticky feeling lasted only for a few minutes,and then went back to normal ...\n\nI know epoxy may not be suitable for this application but.....\n\nIs there some one on this site having an idea of what's going on with this ????????\n\nGaston\n\nAttachments\n\npropeller & epoxy 001.jpg\n\npropeller & epoxy 003.jpg\n\npropeller & epoxy 006.jpg\n\nThis is an interesting problem. I know that once cured, heat will re-activate (for an unproper term) epoxy to a point. It will get soft, even liquified if warm enough and of course back to sticky.\n\nThere is a heat issue ... but the interesting thing to me is on the blades of the prop ??\n\nWere is it getting sufficient heat from?? The friction between the turning blade and the air??\n\nI am very curious to see if someone comes up with a solid answer to this\n\nJason"
