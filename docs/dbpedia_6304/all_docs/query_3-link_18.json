        "text": "Kiev prop is fairly quiet. Quieter than Warp or Powerfin anyway. Sensenich 2-blade composite prop for Rotax 9 series engines creates a lower frequency and thus sounds quieter to the human ear but actually is just as loud. Sensenich 3-blade composite prop is indeed quieter but its $2200.00 Aero prop with curved tips is fairly quiet also. The semi scimitar shaped blades do delay the shockwave and reduce sound, also increases efficiency. I use Aero prop in pushers of slow speed (below 120 mph cruise). It seems to work well for the right price. I have done comparisons against Powerfin and warp drive and Sensenich 2-blade composite. Sensenich was a tad bit better but not enough to justify its higher cost. I am testing a new prop called Sterna prop right now. Will have results in about a month.\n\nI use Aero prop in pushers of slow speed (below 120 mph cruise). It seems to work well for the right price.\n\nHi Abid\n\nWhy is the Aero prop better? I haven't purchased the prop yet and would like to get the best one and didn't know much about the Aero and wasn't looking at it until you recommended it. What advantages did you observe to select it for yourself.\n\nIt is as quiet as the Kiev with same diameter and number of blades. Kiev achieves that by sweeping back the leading edge just as Sterna and Sensenich do. Aero prop achives it using curled tips (winglets). The same quietness mechanism increases efficiency of these props as well in certain ranges. Aero prop is a better value compared to others with similar performance and very similar decibel meter numbers I noted flying at 500 feet over the runway in calm conditions at cruise RPM.\n\nI would not use their supplied metric hardware however. I change all prop hardware with AN5 bolts of proper size.\n\nBTW, Sterna prop not Sterba. Its a new propeller that I have been tasked with testing to ASTM Propeller Standard and submit the results and report for ASTM compliance. Part of that is to fly-off between 50 to 100 hours at different settings on the prop with a representative engine installation.\n\nThe advantages of Aero prop so far I noticed are (applies to pusher applications only):\n\n1) Better price\n\n2) Similar performance as Kiev prop as well as Sensinich prop (2-blade version) at a better price\n\n3) Smoother slightly\n\n4) Easy pitch gauge\n\n5) As quiet as Kiev etc. Quieter than Warp\n\n6) Stainless Steel leading edge protection standard unlike Warp\n\n7) Lighter moment of inertia that helps with Rotax engines and gearboxes\n\nIt is as quiet as the Kiev with same diameter and number of blades.

My company is a dealer and in the US you can order and get support through us as well. The prop I recommend and have tested for trikes and gyroplanes is K-1750 or for 582 with 3:1 or greater RR G-1750. These are 1750 mm diameter props (69 inches).\n\nhttps://store.silverlightaviation.com/category-s/1817.htm\n\nThe gyro currently has a 60\" Powerfin. It appears the Aeroprop is not available in a 60\" diameter."
