        "text": "look at the direction of the vanes in vac pump, when you turn it backwards the vanes are pushed into the rotator of the pump and away from the pumps cylinder walls. it can't be damaged by reverse rotation.\n\nJohn Frank argued the same in his Cessna 182 Systems course. He had a cut-away pump that showed it even more clearly than your photo because you could turn it and look at what happens.\n\nHe did say if you let the vanes wear to almost gone and didn’t replace them on time in service properly, the vanes get too short to move properly and can snap off in reverse because they didn’t retract. But you shouldn’t be flying behind that pump in IMC anyway if there’s that little of the vane left, and you weren’t paying jack-all attention to how many hours were on the thing. It probably did you a favor by breaking on the ground.\n\nYMMV. That’s what he taught. Looked reasonable to me looking at a working cut-away example.\n\nIf some boss or other person says “don’t do it” I would respect the order but probably not their reasoning skill. But not too many people have seen the inside of those pumps so the OWT persists.\n\nIf they all break when turned backwards they’d break every time a prop stops and moves backward because it landed at the top of the compression stroke and wanted to rotate backward. Or on a hard winter start when the same thing happens if the engine doesn’t fire and you stop cranking. Props move backward on their own on a semi-regular basis at shutdown. That’s my take on it.\n\nJohn Frank argued the same in his Cessna 182 Systems course.

Or on a hard winter start when the same thing happens if the engine doesn’t fire and you stop cranking. Props move backward on their own on a semi-regular basis at shutdown. That’s my take on it.\n\nThe most important point is to always have a backup attitude source if flying IFR, since your vacuum pump will fail. I have experienced 4 failures. I think most mechanics will tell you that they can fail after a few hours or many.\n\nWhile the advice to change your vacuum pump after a set number of hours in use is desirable, many of us fly them to failure as \"we have a backup.\"\n\nI have not examined the inside of a pump, and maybe it is obvious if I did so, but\n\nfrom a non-mechanic perspective, and looking at the pump photo, it appears (and this may be incorrect) the vanes are expanded by centrifugal force. And your observation that often on engine shut down, the blade kicks back a bit in counter-rotation is a common one. Could it be that this is a factor in why these pumps are notoriously unreliable at almost any age . I don't know whether this can cause vane flex at these times, but without trying to propagate a wives tale, it makes some sense to me to eliminate flex, where you can, if in fact that is what your doing by rotating your prop in the normal rotation direction. The observation from \"John Frank\" when the vanes get worn makes sense to me, but can the vanes hang up without retracting at other times setting up the stress with counter-rotation? Always YMMV.\n\nI think if you don't need to move it from its position after stopping then there is no need. My plane sits in a hanger with little clearance front or rear. The entrance to the hanger is at one end. Because of this I put my prop vertical. It makes it less likely some poor sap is going to end up with a blade in his eye in the dark when he squeezes past my prop. If not for that I'd leave it where it stops. Yes I have to move it to put it vertical and I have to move it again to hook up the tow bar. Vertical does make it easier to reach in the intakes and check for bird nests. I watched a plane burn down due to a bird nest fire way back in the dark ages....always check now."
