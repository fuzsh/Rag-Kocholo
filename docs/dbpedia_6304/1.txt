Does anyone have a suggestion for a prop for my CX4. I have a 2180 VW conversion from Scott Casler.

I believe mine had a 54X44 Tennessee Prop.

Thanks. The problem with adjusting the prop to accommodate the increase in power is an interesting one.

It's too bad Tennessee props is closed. Is there another good supplier that everyone is using?

We have a Sterba 54 x 46 on our CX4.

I would suggest a 54/46 for CX4s although prop makers vary in how they measure pitch.

I'll second the Sterba 54/46. Miss Mitty is off in an easy 700' and cruise 115mph 2800rpm on my 2180. (~2000ASL)

Sterba 54/46 on my 2180 and he rocks! Bought it in 2012 for $350 and part of the hardened leading edge came off during ground run...he fixed for free. In 2019 I saw something in the grain that I thought might be a crack so I sent it back and he sent me a new prop...no charge. You just keep the original shipping container and if you want the pitch changed (less climb, more cruise) he will do it. Don’t know how he makes money but I’m sold!

Since my favorite prop maker, Props Inc, is no longer making props, I bought a Sterba prop. It looks great but I have not flown it yet.

You should be able to get the pitch you need from other 2180 engine owners.

Thanks for the input everyone.

I'll be tracking down a prop later today.

My engine is a great planed 1915 and it has a Tennessee prop 54 x 44

My propeller is stamped 54/42 but I only get 3050 Wide Open Throttle, level flight. Would think that pitch would produce more RPM.

Please remember that different prop makers measure pitch differently. I have two props that perform identically- one is 40 pitch( Props Inc.)and one is 46 pitch (Tenn Props) ---- different manufacturer.

When I pitched mine down that is all I got out of mine.

I have a CX4 with a Great Plains 2915 engine I was only getting 3000 RPM. I just installed a ED Sterba 54/42 prop and today I did a go around and turned 3550 RPM.

Billy, what prop were you running before?
