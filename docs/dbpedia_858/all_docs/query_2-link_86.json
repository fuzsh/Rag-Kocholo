        "text": "Little Nuala has been fitted with a new prosthetic eye after beating an extremely rare form of cancer 🤩 Back in 2023, 10-month-old Nuala was diagnosed with a very rare cancer called Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma, which affects just six people in England a year. Her tumour grew behind her left eye which is even more rare, leading to multiple surgeries here at Alder Hey 🏥 and eventually the removal of her left eye. Now 19 months old, Nuala rang the end-of-treatment bell in January and is adjusting well with her new prosthetic eye 😊 Nuala’s surgeon, Consultant in Paediatric Ophthalmology Mr Ankur Raj, said: “I had never seen this type of cancer affect the eye before. Nuala’s resilience has been truly amazing. We are working hard with Aintree University Hospital to make Nuala’s new prosthetic eye a perfect match.” 🤝 Mum Megan said: \"Nuala amazes us every day. Despite the challenges, she's thriving and has settled into nursery so well.\" 💙 To say thank you for the care Nuala has received, the family is fundraising for our Charity through various events, including the Conniston Challenge in July! #NualasJourney #sarcomaawarenessmonth #rarechildhoodcancer\n\nCongratulations to our very own Mr Sunil Sharma, who has been appointed Training Programme Director for ENT for the entire North West region. As an Alder Hey consultant, Sunil will be leading our role in medical education at a regional level in ENT. Sunil said: “I'm hoping to develop innovative programmes in the ENT educational programme using simulation and new technology such as virtual reality. I'm also hoping to improve awareness and support for our diverse group of trainees, as well as promoting less than full time training amongst both trainees and trainers - in ENT we have some of the largest numbers of less than full time trainees amongst surgical specialties.\" Congratulations and best of luck to Sunil in his new role!\n\nStanding Together – One Alder Hey We are One Alder Hey, made up of thousands of remarkable people from hundreds of different backgrounds, cultures and faiths. Our diversity of skills, knowledge and beliefs is what connects and defines us. It is what allows us to do what we do, every day – in our Hospitals and in our Communities. We’re all driven by the same vision and passion – to deliver outstanding care and emotional support to the children, young people and families we serve. We know we can only do that by supporting each other to be the very best we can be. Given recent and ongoing events, ensuring every child and family and every colleague feels safe in our care, and our workplaces, has never been more important than it is now. That’s why our message is clear; hate has no place in Alder Hey. One Alder Hey stands for compassion, understanding, kindness and respect. We have a zero tolerance approach to any and all discrimination, unacceptable or inappropriate behaviour and we will take action if we see something that doesn’t uphold these values. Please help us ensure that no child, young person, family or colleague ever experiences or witnesses hate or discrimination. By working together, we can show our children and young people strength and solidarity in the face of adversity. We are One Alder Hey.\n\nWe are delighted to announce that construction work has started on a brand new, state-of-the-art cinema that will be based right here at Alder Hey! 🤩 The cinema, funded by our amazing Alder Hey Children's Charity and MediCinema, will open later this year and feature beds, wheelchairs, and medical equipment and show the latest movies for free to transform the hospital experience 💙 Your ongoing support will help to fund specialist staff and day to day running costs to ensure we can continue to bring the magic of cinema to our children and young people 📽️🍿 Find out more about our charity appeal at: https://lnkd.in/e5rdspjg\n\nWe recently had the pleasure of welcoming Dr Emmanuel Anigilaje, a consultant paediatric nephrologist from Nigeria 🇳🇬 , who visited Alder Hey to meet our nephrology team and highlight the critical need for life-saving transplants in his home country. Children don’t currently have fair access to kidney transplantation in Nigeria and most families cannot afford to pay for treatment for chronic kidney disease. Dr. Emmanuel Anigilaje, is hoping to change this. He recently graduated with a Masters in Organ Transplantation with distinction from University of Liverpool and has dedicated his work to creating a pathway for fair access to kidney transplantation for children in Nigeria. Mentored by Dr Louise Oni, Consultant Paediatric Nephrologist here at Alder Hey 🏥, Dr Anigilaje has established an international kidney community and hopes to take the knowledge he has gained to raise awareness and emphasise the importance of life saving transplantation in Nigeria. Dr Anigilaje said; 🗣️ “I hope one day that every child with kidney failure can access kidney transplantation no matter where they live.”\n\nTake a look at our video about the work we've been doing in Springfield Park! 🌳 Back when we built our new hospital, we agreed to a land swap agreement with Liverpool City Council to allow us to build on Springfield Park 🏬 Also on Wednesday, July 31st, from 11am to 2pm, Springfield Park will host a FREE Family Fun Day. There will be lots of free activities, such as face painting, football workshops, musical performances, and more. You can also chat with our development team to learn more about the park development project. Come along! 😄"
