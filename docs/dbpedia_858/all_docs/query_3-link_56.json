        "text": "Space for loved ones\n\nCharacterised by the typical homogenous suburban healthcare architecture from the 70s, the greater Östra Hospital campus is a mixture of high-rise and low-rise buildings. Queen Silvia Children’s Hospital is a first step in the transformation into a more urban-like hospital campus with improved work flows that respond to the collaborative needs of modern healthcare.\n\nThe 35,000 sqm state-of-the-art extension of the existing children’s hospital houses a new operation unit, an intensive care expansion and single-patient rooms to reduce the spread of infections. Each room also has space for a parent or loved one to stay the night.\n\nHome away from home\n\nAlthough the average time of treatment at the hospital is shorter than a few days, some children will spend up to half a year or longer. The challenge was how to meet the high demands on equipment, hygiene and efficiency in a way which does not “look and feel” like a hospital. The architects spent a lot of time with the children and their families to unfold their ideas through dialogue, drawings and play. The results revealed a care environment resembling home – calming materials, soft lighting, access to outdoor play and for teenagers, places to hang with friends as well as space for privacy.\n\nRecovery through play\n\nHealing through play is an important part of the rehabilitation process. Strategically placing a huge play therapy room and climbing sculptures next to the entry signals a safe place for play. Colourful signage, sculpture and playful artwork function as wayfinding and lessens the feeling of intimidation upon entering the hospital building and remains the final impression when leaving.\n\nDesigning to maximise daylight is important in Scandinavia. At Queen Silvia Hospital, daylight is captured through the expansive exterior views and patient rooms with low window sill heights. For children who are not well enough to venture outdoors, a temperature-controlled winter garden provides direct access to daylight and lends a feeling of being in the fresh outdoors. Adding warmth and tranquility to the winter-garden are wood panels, which are a common design feature throughout the interior.\n\nA feeling of normality and a daily life is what guides the design of one of the world’s most prominent child and youth hospitals, mixing familiarly environments such as a school, a playground and a home."
