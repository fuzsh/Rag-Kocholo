        "meta_description": "2 reviews and 2 photos of NOAH'S ARK CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL CHARITY \"The Noah's Ark Appeal aims to build, equip and further support the Children's Hospital for Wales. The Appeal is currently looking to raise at least £7m. The main things that they are aiming to provide include some major pieces of equipment such as an open MRI scanner, the art programme as well as replacing all the equipment in the new critical care unit.\n\nThe appeal was launched in 2000 following a decade of lobbying and campaigning by the charity's founder trustees. They were incensed that Wales was the only country in Europe without a purpose-built hospital for sick children. The Children's Hospital for Wales was opened to patients with medical conditions and/or cancer in time for St David's Day in 2005 and officially opened a year later. \n\nThe Noah's Ark Appeal continued to support the Children's Hospital for Wales while at the same time pressing for the hospital to be completed by the Welsh Assembly Government. By 2008 over £12 million had been raised making this hospital 'one of the best in the world.'\"",
