        "text": "This is a three-year, full-time programme. Each academic year is divided into two semesters; Autumn and Spring.\n\nThe programme is structured using a spiral curriculum model, key subject specific topics and clinical practice will be introduced in year one and then spiral through each year, increasing the depth and range of knowledge and promoting proficiency. Students must successfully complete 360 credits and pass practice proficiencies outlined in the practice portfolio for each year in order to achieve the award of a Bachelor of Nursing (Hons) (Child) and be eligible to apply for professional registration with the NMC to practice as a children’s nurse.\n\nThe modules shown are an example of the typical curriculum and will be reviewed prior to the 2025/2026 academic year. The final modules will be published by September 2025.\n\nYear one\n\nThere are four compulsory modules in year one and two clinical practice placements. The modules will either be delivered over one semester or two semesters each year.\n\nYear two\n\nThere are five compulsory modules in year two and three clinical practice placements. The modules will either be delivered over one semester or two semesters each year.\n\nYear three\n\nThere are four compulsory modules in year three and two clinical practice placements. The modules will either be delivered over one semester or two semesters each year. The last practice learning opportunity in the programme is 14 weeks, and this is where a sign off mentor will make a judgment about the students’ achievements of the required competencies for safe and effective entry to the NMC register.\n\nThe University is committed to providing a wide range of module options where possible, but please be aware that whilst every effort is made to offer choice this may be limited in certain circumstances. This is due to the fact that some modules have limited numbers of places available, which are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis, while others have minimum student numbers required before they will run, to ensure that an appropriate quality of education can be delivered; some modules require students to have already taken particular subjects, and others are core or required on the programme you are taking. Modules may also be limited due to timetable clashes, and although the University works to minimise disruption to choice, we advise you to seek advice from the relevant School on the module choices available.\n\nTraditional face-to-face learning strategies such as lectures, workshops and seminars will be complemented by interactive online opportunities and resources designed to enhance your overall learning experience and enable you to acquire the knowledge, skills and capabilities that are a requirement of children’s nursing practice. You are also afforded valuable opportunities to learn from the authentic voices of service users and carers who contribute to the programme as experts by experience.\n\nWithin the clinical environment you will be supported by Practice Supervisors and Practice Assessors as you progress towards achieving Nursing and Midwifery Council proficiencies. In the academic setting you will also be allocated Academic Assessor who will review your Professional Assessment Document (PAD) throughout the year to the point of progression to the following year of study. To support learning in practice you will also undertake simulated activities and scenarios in a purpose-built simulation suite. This will allow you to develop, practice and consolidate skills in a safe environment.\n\nHow will I be supported?\n\nYou will be allocated a Personal Tutor who is a member of the academic staff group and a qualified children’s nurse. You will be encouraged to arrange meetings with your personal tutor throughout your time on the programme, during which you can access pastoral support and reflect on your overall progress. Personal Tutors will also assist in signposting you to other sources of support such as the School and Programme Student Disability Contact and University-wide services including Student Support and Wellbeing and the Academic Skills and Mentoring Team. Welsh-speaking personal tutors may be available to students whose preference is to access support through the medium of Welsh.\n\nThe School also works in partnership with Y Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol to provide opportunities for Welsh speaking students to study aspects of the programme through the medium of Welsh and the possibility of a yearly scholarship. You could also learn Welsh through our Welsh for All programme where courses are designed to fit around your academic commitments and are free of charge.\n\nThe Programme Manager, Module Leads and Academic Assessor can support you in relation to your overall experience as a student of the programme, including any feedback or concerns you might have.\n\nDuring practice placements, you will be supported by Practice Supervisors and a Practice Assessor who will facilitate your learning and prepare you for in-point clinical assessments. A dedicated Placement Support Team will also be available to you, alongside formal mechanisms and procedures, to support your learning and progress and address any issues or problems that may arise. The placement team will attempt to source Welsh-speaking supervisors or bilingual placement learning opportunities and, if available, Welsh-speaking named contacts from the academic setting upon request.\n\nHow will I be assessed?\n\nThe curriculum incorporates a diverse range of assessment strategies and methods which are reflective of an inclusive, learner-centred approach and aligned to the intended learning outcomes of the programme.\n\nEach module within the programme incorporates formative assessment and feedback which is designed to support your learning and to assist you in identifying your own strengths and areas for development and prepare you for summative assessment which is formally marked and therefore contributes to progression or degree classification decisions. The goal of summative assessment is to indicate how well you have succeeded in meeting the intended learning outcomes of a module and the feedback provided will enable you to identify areas for further development.\n\nIn practice you will be assessed according to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC 2018) standards for student supervision and assessment. Each year your achievements in practice will be recorded in a Practice Assessment Document.\n\nWhat skills will I practise and develop?\n\nThe Learning Outcomes for this Programme describe what you will be able to do as a result of your study at Cardiff University.
