        "text": "Veezu has become the Easter bunny this year, donating Easter eggs, activity packs and toys to The Noah's Ark Children's Hospital Charity.\n\nVeezu has partnered with Noah's Ark to provide Easter treats to young patients in the hospital and children's centre. The Noah's Ark Children's Hospital Charity supports the only children's hospital for Wales, helping to ensure world class care and the best outcome and experience possible for the young patients who receive treatment there.\n\nOperating entirely thanks to public donations, the charity raises money to fund capital projects and has previously funded a new neonatal intensive care unit.\n\nLucy Jones, Fundraising Manager at The Noah's Ark Children's Hospital Charity, said: \"We're so grateful to Veezu for their ongoing support, and these Easter treats will really bring a smile to the children's faces this Bank Holiday weekend.\"\n\nJack Price, Regional Director at Veezu, said: \"We are pleased to be able to support the children at Noah's Ark Children's Hospital with this donation. We hope that these Easter treats and activities will bring some joy to the children and their families.\"\n\nThe donation was made through the Funded by Veezu community support initiative."
