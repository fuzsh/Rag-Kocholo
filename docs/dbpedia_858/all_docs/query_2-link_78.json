        "text": "About Us\n\nStarlight Ward is the specialist oncology and haematology ward here at the hospital, it is situated on Level 7. It is also the South West regional tertiary centre for bone marrow and stem cell transplantation. Children are admitted from across the South West, Wales, Gloucestershire, Oxford, Cambridge, and Ireland. There are 16 beds, of which 10 are en suite. We predominantly treat children aged 0 to 12.\n\nOur welcome video\n\nTake a look at our ward welcome video to find out all about the Starlight Ward, featuring our patient presenter - Madi!\n\nSorry, your browser does not support IFRAMES\n\nPhilosophy of the Ward\n\nWe believe that patient care should be centred around a child's individual needs, as well as those of the family. This means treating patients and their families with dignity and respect. We are proud of our large, forward thinking and skilled multidisciplinary team. This allows to treat in a safe and child-focused environment. We encourage parents, carers, and children to be involved in the planning and delivery of care. We think it's especially important that parents and carers are educated and become competent and confident in caring for their child.\n\nParent and Patient Facilities\n\nStarlight Ward has a spacious parent's kitchen with panoramic views across the city. It allows families to provide themselves with light meals as it has microwaves, fridges, a freezer and a comfortable sitting area. Tea and coffee are provided by Friends for Parents.\n\nPlay Facilities\n\nWe have a large play room that also has great views of the city. We are very fortunate to have our own play specialist who can get patients involved with activities and help with procedure preparation throughout the day.\n\nWe have a wide selection of toys and games for all ages as well as laptops, tablets and games consoles that can be loaned out on a daily basis. The school team and our music therapists can also visit you on the ward.\n\nParent Coffee Morning\n\nThere is a parent coffee morning once a month run by CLIC to enable the parents to chat to each other, share experiences, relax and drink tea/coffee with other parents. This is facilitated by our CLIC Sargent Care Support Worker.\n\nContact Us\n\nPhone: 0117 342 8334, 0117 342 8640"
