        "text": "All the Blues squad were out in force this week visiting young patients at the Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff and the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant\n\nThe visits have become an annual event in the Blues calendar and something that all the players look forward to. One young supporter was delighted to meet Blues captain Andries Pretorius and fly half Rhys Patchell.\n\nNiall Murphy, who is from Bridgend and attends Brynteg School is a big Blues supporter and is in hospital recovering from an operation on his leg. Speaking on the ward, NialI, said,\n\n“I have been a Cardiff Blues supporter for ages.”\n\n“I play rugby for my school and Bridgend Sports. I play Flanker and really look up to Sam Warburton as he is an all round player and leader.\n\n“This is my second day in Hospital, I came in yesterday ahead of my operation today. I’m in a bit of pain but everything should be fine.”\n\n“The boys have been discussing their pre- season training with me, when they had to run up the dunes and their sea training. It sounds really hard.”\n\n“I have done some dune training myself before and it is not the nicest! It’s not far from where I live so I have run down there and run back - it was tough.”\n\nLisa Jenkins, who works as a Senior Staff Nurse at Children’s Hospital for Wales said,\n\n“The boys have been coming to the hospitals for years now and the children react to them fantastically.\n\n“It is absolutely fantastic that the boys take time out to come visit the Hospitals. It is really inspirational to the kids.\n\n“Not only does it break up their day but for them to see well known personalities come on to the ward, giving the kids presents and interacting with them it inspirers the children to think of their own futures.\n\n“A perfect example is they spent some time talking to one of the children in the games room about his interest in rugby and his future in that, it has really inspired him to think about what he wants to do when he is older. It is just fantastic for the kids!\n\n“I think the nursing staff really enjoy the visit as well.”"
