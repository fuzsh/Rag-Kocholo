        "text": "As most fans know, Dame Shirley Bassey has donated and raised a lot of funds for the Noah’s Ark Appeal.\n\nSince 2000, they have developed a state-of-the-art hospital for children in Cardiff. Up till then, Wales was the only country in Europe without a dedicated national children’s hospital.\n\nDame Shirley was central among celebrities to promote the project. She donated half the proceeds from the Christie’s gowns auction, and participated in other events.\n\nOn a vist to the wards, she got down on the floor to play with the kids.\n\nDame Shirley Bassey is to be a patron of a children’s hospital’s fundraising charity. The Cardiff-born singer joins Catherine Zeta Jones and Charlotte Church as patrons of the Noah’s Ark Appeal.\n\nShe has been a supporter of the campaign to build the Children’s Hospital of Wales in Cardiff for several years and a cancer ward there is named after her.\n\nA further £4 million is needed to complete the hospital, which admitted its first patients three years ago.\n\nDame Shirley said: “Having supported the appeal for years, I am thrilled to have become a patron of what I consider an extremely worthy and high-profile charity.\n\n“Phase One was a magnificent, pioneering achievement, and I cannot wait to see what will be achieved through the coming campaign.\n\n“The people of Wales have spoken – they want world-class healthcare for their children, and I have no doubt that the appeal will deliver.”\n\nIn 2003, Dame Shirley donated £125,000 to the appeal from the sale of her dresses at an auction at Christie’s in London marking her half-century in show business.\n\nShe visited sick children being treated at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, while the children’s hospital was under construction on the same site.\n\nThere was also a gown auction for the Children’s Hospital by the Noah’s Ark Appeal and it was the dress Dame Shirley wore that night at the ball.\n\nSuperfan Susan won a dress at the Christies gown auction in 2003 and she is being interviewed here too.\n\nTo find out more about the Children’s hospital CLICK HERE\n\nTo find out more about the Noah’s Ark Appeal CLICK HERE & CLICK HERE\n\nBelow a video of Dame Shirley at the children’s hospital\n\nBelow a video of Dame Shirley at the Cardiff Gown auction on the 24th. of September 2004\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript."
