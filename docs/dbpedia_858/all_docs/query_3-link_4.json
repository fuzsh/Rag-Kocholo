        "text": "Ronald McDonald Charity House\n\nIf you are resident on the ward with your child the ward manager may make a request for you to stay in the new residence. There is a criteria for this accommodation as places are limited so parents who live at a distance and are resident in the hospital for some time will be prioritised.\n\nEverything will be done to accommodate you but there is often a waiting list Ronald McDonald team will make you fully aware of the rules of the house when you arrive.\n\nRestaurant Facilities\n\nAROMA Café\n\nIn the Children’s Starfish Outpatient Department we have a small café that is open during office hours for snacks and drinks.\n\nY Gegin Hospital Restaurant is situated in the adjacent University Hospital Wales A block on the upper ground floor. The restaurant service times are as follows:\n\nBreakfast 07:30 - 10:30, Lunch 12:00 – 2:00 Dinner 5:00 – 7:00, Night Service 9:30 – 1:15\n\nPasta Bar, Salad Bar, Baguettes and Jacket Potatoes available Monday to Friday 12:00 - 2:00 from the Grab & Go Counter\n\nMulti-faith Chaplain\n\nMeeting the varied spiritual and religious needs of patients and staff whether they have a faith or not, Spiritual care is fundamental to the holistic care we provide. The Chaplains (individuals who provide spiritual healthcare in its broadest sense and includes those individual faith leaders from the various world faiths) regularly visit the wards on a daily basis and are here for all patients and their families/carers. For example, some may feel the need for prayer, or wish to have their child baptized. Others may just need some quiet support or reassurance.\n\nWhatever the need, chaplains provide an on-call service at any time of the day or night, and can be contacted through a member of the nursing staff. The Chaplains can also help those of other faiths who have differing worship needs, and can act as a link to representatives of other denominations when required.\n\nThe Sanctuary is a Multi – Faith Space and is situated on B5 (near lifts) in the main hospital and is open 24 hours a day. There is also a multi-faith prayer room situated on Land floor of the Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales."
