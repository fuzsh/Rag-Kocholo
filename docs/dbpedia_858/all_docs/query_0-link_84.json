        "text": "Following the advice of medical staff, we will meet with you to discuss your child's educational needs and set up tuition. We will work directly with your child's school to ensure continuity and consistency with your child's education.\n\nWe will arrange for a teacher to see your child for up to one hour per day, each day they are in hospital. If your child is a regular re-admission, tuition will continue on the day following their next admission.\n\nâ€‹\n\nTeaching can take place in your child's room. We are keen to continue any work provided by the school - homework included! We offer a dynamic and engaging curriculum that can suit your child's medical and educational needs.\n\nWe can discuss the appropriate level of work for your child. Tuition will be delivered at the child's pace. We will provide a learning environment that is fun - bringing a sense of normality to your child's day."
