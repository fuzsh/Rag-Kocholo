        "text": "Twelve years after building work began and 10 years after the first patients were admitted, the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales is set to officially open the second phase of development this Friday (May 15).\n\nBuilt with £63.8m of funding from the Welsh Government, the second phase includes new operating theatres, a surgical ward, therapy services and an enclosed garden.\n\nThe idea for a dedicated children's hospital was given celebrity backing from a number of Welsh stars from the worlds of music, sport and cinema.\n\nBack in 2000 the then 14-year-old Charlotte Church helped launch the first appeal as patron of Noah's Ark Children's Hospital Charity.\n\nFast forward to 2008, and the singer and hospital patron launched a £4m appeal for the second phase of the hospital and returned in 2009 to help launch a £1.2m appeal to help equip the new intensive care unit.\n\nCharlotte wasn't the only high-profile Welshwoman to put her weight behind the appeals, and was later joined by patrons actress Catherine Zeta-Jones and singer Dame Shirley Bassey.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones officially opened the hospital with her husband, Michael Douglas, in 2006, returning to tour the grounds and facilities in 2010.\n\nThe Hollywood actress revisited in 2012 when the hospital, then called the Children's Hospital in Cardiff, was renamed the Noah’s Ark Children’s Hospital for Wales.\n\nAs well as having the backing of celebrity patrons, the hospital is no stranger to celebrity visitors with Baywatch star David Hasselhoff taking time to drop in with his Welsh girlfriend Hayley Roberts back in November.\n\nOver the years the hospital has grown in both reputation and size and on St David's Day this year it celebrated its 10th anniversary .\n\nAs the hospital looks forward to a new era with state-of-the-art facilities, take a look through the pictures that show the people and landmark events along the way that helped bring the idea of a dedicated hospital for children to life."
