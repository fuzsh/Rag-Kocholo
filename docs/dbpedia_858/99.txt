Cardiff is Wales's capital and home to one of the busiest hospitals in the UK, the University Hospital of Wales. UHW treats over one million patients annually and trains nurses and doctors in collaboration with regional universities.

About the University Hospital of Wales

UHW in Cardiff is the third-largest hospital in the UK and the biggest in Wales. Originally called the Heath Hospital, when construction started in 1963, it was designed to be a fully integrated hospital and medical school with long parallel buildings designed by architect Stanley Wayman Milburn. After officially opening in 1971, UHW has around 1,080 beds and is a teaching hospital for Cardiff University's medical school.

UHW has seen a lot of development over the past decade. In 2009, a Â£16 million birthing and maternity medicine centre opened, with pools and a dedicated midwife unit. The following year, a new delivery suite was added. The busy A&E department, which treats 750 people each weekend, had a scheduled refit in 2013.

As the major trauma centre for South Wales, UHW delivers critical services to the community. One of the most recent additions is the 2020 Lakeside Wing, a modular 400-bed patient facility that treats adults and older children.

UHW's specialisms include:

Anaesthetics.

Audio-vestibular medicine.

Cardiology.

Dermatology.

Ear, nose, and throat surgery.

Endocrinology and diabetes mellitus.

Gastroenterology.

General (internal) medicine.

Neurosurgery.

Nuclear medicine.

Obstetrics and gynaecology.

Ophthalmology.

Oral and maxillofacial surgery.

Trauma & orthopaedic surgery.

The HIW's latest report for UHW, released in April 2023, found staff were committed to providing high-quality care, and patients rated the service as good. The overall summary is of a high-quality hospital delivering patient satisfaction.
