Tilelli Jr., a 1963 graduate of Pennsylvania Military College and member of the Widener Board of Trustees. Tilelli served five years as board chair before stepping down from that leadership role last year. The event drew alumni from the Pennsylvania Military College, members of the Board of Trustees, university leadership, faculty, staff, and cadets in the Dauntless Battalion, Widener’s ROTC cohort comprised of more than 100 cadets who are enrolled at Widener and seven other regional colleges and universities.\n\nIn his remarks, Tilelli noted, “as I accept this honor, I do it not for myself, but for the thousands of American sons and daughters who carried me forward on their shoulders to be where I am today.” “The soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are the less than 1 percent of Americans who are willing to pay the ultimate sacrifice…to keep America free. And in my mind’s eye they’re America’s best,” Tilelli said. A retired four-star general, Tilelli served two tours of duty in Vietnam and commanded the First Calvary Division during the 1991 Gulf War. A generous supporter of the university, Tilelli established the Tilelli Annual Endowed Leadership Scholarship at Widener, which benefits a veteran or member of the ROTC Dauntless Battalion, as well as the Tilelli Leadership Fellowship Endowment."
