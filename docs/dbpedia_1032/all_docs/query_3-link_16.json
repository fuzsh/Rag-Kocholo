        "text": "The Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance\n\nA new focal point to the Korean War Veterans Memorial on the National Mall was open to the public on July 27, 2022 — a remembrance wall featuring the names of more than 36,000 Americans who died supporting the War and over 7,100 Koreans who died while augmenting the Army.\n\nThe wall consists of 100 panels. The names are organized by rank and respective branch of service, demonstrating how the War’s burden fell unevenly across the military — with privates and privates first class taking up the first 44 of the 84 Army panels.\n\nThe Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation (KWVMF) cares deeply about each Veteran who fought in the Korean War and their Families. To honor the 36,634 fallen Korean War Service Members and 7,174 Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army (or KATUSA) Soldiers, the Foundation raised funds, worked with the Department of Defense (DOD) for the official names of the deceased, and worked with the National Park Service (NPS) for the addition of the Wall of Remembrance at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Foundation used official information about these Veterans (to include name, rank, and service) from the Department of Defense (DOD). The Foundation worked with the National Park Service (NPS) for the design and placement of the Wall of Remembrance, because the NPS is responsible for all national monuments and memorials.\n\nWe will continue to work with DOD and NPS to accurately reflect the names of fallen Korean War Veterans in the Wall of Remembrance. If DOD determines that changes need to be made and the Foundation is informed, we will work with NPS to make appropriate changes.\n\nThe newly renovated Memorial and the new Wall of Remembrance honor all Korean War Veterans, those Veterans killed in action, and their Families. We deeply appreciate the support of Korean War Veterans and their Families as we hope that the Memorial will become a living center where Americans and Koreans can gather to honor the fallen, learn their stories and about their contributions, and inspire current and future generations.\n\nBREAKDOWN OF NAMES\n\nUnited States Army\n\nUnited States Marine Corps\n\nUnited States Navy\n\nUnited States Air Force\n\n29,857\n\n4,522\n\n668\n\n1,587\n\nTOTAL US CASUALTIES\n\nTOTAL ROK CASUALTIES\n\n36,634\n\n7,174\n\nCOMBINED CASUALTY COUNT\n\n43,808\n\nThe Renovation\n\nDuring the construction of the Wall of Remembrance, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation also rehabilitated the 25-year-old Memorial. Together the Foundation and The Whiting-Turner Contracting Company:\n\nRepaired pavement\n\nReplaced the engraved names of participating countries and casualty figures with stainless steel letters\n\nRefinished the stainless-steel statues\n\nReplaced the linden trees around the Pool of Remembrance\n\nReplaced the juniper trees in the Field of Service\n\nUpdated the existing lighting with high-efficiency LED lamps\n\nPlanning Phases\n\n Wall of Remembrance Act\n\n Design Approval\n\n Fundraising\n\n Groundbreaking\n\n Construction of the Wall\n\n Dedication Ceremony\n\nKorean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act\n\nOn October 7, 2016, Congress enacted the “Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act’’ (Public Law 114–230). This legislation authorized the KWVMF to construct a Wall of Remembrance at the Korean War Veterans Memorial. The Act required that the wall include a list of names of members of the Armed Forces of the United States who died in the Korean War, as determined by the Secretary of Defense. The Wall of Remembrance will also include other information about the Korean War, including the number of members of the Armed Forces of the United States, the Korean Augmentation to the United States Army, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, and the other nations of the United Nations Command who, in regards to the Korean War— (A) were killed in action; (B) were wounded in action; (C) are listed as missing in action; or (D) were prisoners of War.\n\nWall of Remembrance Act’’ (Public Law 114–230)\n\nDesign Approval\n\nIn order to reduce impacts to the Memorial and the National Mall, the preferred design concept has a minimal approach. The design consisted of adding a low angled wall integrated into the landscape surrounding the original Memorial; expanding the circular plaza outside the two rows of linden trees by nine feet to provide circulation around the new curvilinear wall; raising the existing berm from the surrounding landscape from four to ten percent to conceal most of the wall and maintain reciprocal views of the Memorial and the National Mall; providing two new pedestrian paths to connect the Pool of Remembrance to Ash Road and Independence Avenue, and rehabilitating the existing Memorial.\n\nKWVMF Design Report\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nFundraising\n\nThrough the generous donations of the American and Korean people, the necessary funding of $22 million for the construction costs of the Wall of Remembrance has been raised.\n\nChairman Ministry of Patriot and Veterans Affairs, Republic of Korea Chairman SK Holdings President Korean Veterans Association of the Republic of Korea President Kumho Petrochemical President Korea-US Alliance Foundation President Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta President Maryland, State of President KWVA Foothills Chapter 301 President National Unification Advisory Council President Sae Eden Presbyterian Church President Korean American Society of Virginia President Poongsan President Mudang Gumpa\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nGroundbreaking Ceremony\n\nOn Friday, May 21, 2021, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Foundation (KWVMF) hosted the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Groundbreaking Ceremony & Broadcast.
