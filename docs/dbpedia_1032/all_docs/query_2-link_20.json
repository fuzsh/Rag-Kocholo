        "text": "Post by lordroel on\n\nDAY 2 of operation Desert Storm, Thursday, January 17th 1991\n\nFront page of New York Times on January 17th 1991\n\nEvents of the day\n\nOil prices plunge to $21.44 dollars per barrel.\n\nPolls show 3/4 of Americans support decision to start military action.\n\nTurkey authorizes use of bases for attacks on Iraq, also authorizes Turkish troops to enter Iraq, if necessary.\n\nJapan pledges more financial support.\n\nPLO and Jordan strongly denounce United States action, other nations are strongly supportive.\n\nIran says it may join war if provoked by Iraq.\n\nSpate of anti-American incidents occurs worldwide\n\nIraqi President Saddam Hussein declares: \"The great showdown has begun! The mother of all battles is under way.''\n\nPolitical events\n\nAfter almost a day of partisan arguing, the Senate voted without dissent to commend President Bush and support United States troops in the Gulf- The resolution stated that \"Congress commends and supports the efforts and leadership of the president as commander-in-chief in the Persian Gulf hostilities\" and that \"Congress unequivocally supports the men and women of our armed forces who are carrying out their mission with professional excellence, dedicated patriotism and exemplary bravery.\"\n\nCombat operations (Air, Land and Sea)\n\nAt 2:38 am, Baghdad time, Task Force Normandy consisting of 8 US Army AH-64 Apache helicopters led by 2 US Air Force MH-53 Pave Low helicopters blast Iraqi radar sites that would warn the Iraqis of an impending air strike. By identifying and knocking the radar sites along the Saudi Arabian border, the coalition had a narrow corridor to fly in. As the choppers finished their destruction of the radar sites, the pilots reported seeing an almost traffic jam of coalition jets pouring thru the gap.\n\nYouTube (Task Force Normandy Actual Footage)\n\nSeven B-52s from the 2d Bomb Wing, 8th Air Force, launched 35 modified air launched cruise missiles (ALCMs) at 8 high-priority Iraqi targets, including power generation and transmission facilities, and military communication sites. The ALCMS' success rate, determined through bomb damage assessment, was approximately 85 percent. The bombers departed Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, at 0635 on January 16th, making them the first aircraft launched in the operation. They flew a total of 14,000 miles and remained in the air for over thirty-five hours with four aerial refueling.\n\n100 TOMAHAWK cruise missiles are launched at pre-programmed targets by 9 U.S. Navy ships in the Arabian Gulf and Red Sea. USS SAN JACINTO (CG 56) fired the first TOMAHAWK missile from the Red Sea between 0100-0200 Gulf Time; moments later, USS BUNKER HILL (CG-52) fired the first TOMAHAWK missile from the Arabian Gulf.[/span]\n\nPhoto: A BGM-109 Tomahawk land-attack missile (TLAM) is fired toward an Iraqi target from the battleship USS MISSOURI (BB-63) at the start of Operation Desert Storm.\n\nA total of 1,000 aircraft sorties (E2- Cs/AWACs-controlled) were flown by A-6s, A-7s, AV-8s, A-10s, B-52s, EA-6Bs, EF111s, F-4s, F-14s, F-15s, F-16s, F/A-18s, F-111s, F-117As, AH- 64s, Saudi/British Tornados, French Jaguars, Kuwaiti A-4s. The United States Navy will launch a total of 228 combat sorties on the first day from six aircraft carriers in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf.\n\nCJCS General Colin Powell reports TOMAHAWK cruise missiles \"were extremely effective\" (against precision targets where Iraqi air defenses threatened manned aircraft); of all sorties, 80% were effective, 20% ineffective due to mechanical/weather problems; Iraqi SCUD missile fixed-sites destroyed, targeting SCUD launchers; Iraqi planes destroyed, but \"Iraqi Air Force is still intact\"; United States engaged in air-to-air battles with Iraqi aircraft; Iraq fired multiple SAMs and anti-aircraft artillery, little or no effect; Iraqi elite Republican Guard units attacked in Iraq and Kuwait; did not target President Hussein, focused on disrupting/destroying command/control network.\n\nAn F/A-18 is shot down, the first United States Navy aircraft loss in combat. The F/A-18 crewman, LCDR Michael Speicher of USS SARATOGA's Strike Fighter Squadron 81, is listed as missing.\n\nIraqi aircraft did not mount effective defensive counter air operations, nor did they attempt to fly offensive counter air or interdiction operations against coalition targets. It was believed that the purpose of their limited activity (noted were MiC-25/Foxbat, MiG-29/Fulcrum, and Mirage F1 flights) was to allow maximum use of free fire zones for antiaircraft artillery. Also, analysts believed that Iraq did not want to engage coalition aircraft in aerial combat. A maximum of fifty-four Iraqi combat air patrols were flown while 31 intercepts against coalition aircraft were attempted by Iraqi fighters. Iraqi aircraft were staying clear of the own surface-to-air missile (SAM) envelops. The SAM radars were active, but the Iraqis demonstrated little discipline in SAM fire control.\n\nIraq fires 12 SCUDS at the Israeli cities of Haifa and Tel Aviv, killing 12 people. The United States tells Israel to not retaliate, out of fear that it will escalate the war and trigger the collapse of the Arab Coalition. Also SCUDS are fired at Saudi Arabia, but is downed by United States Patriot missile - first anti- missile missile fired in combat.\n\nPhoto: A RF-4C Phantom II from the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing sits on an airfield during Operation Desert Storm\n\nPost by lordroel on\n\nDAY 3 of operation Desert Storm, Friday January 18th 1991\n\nNew York Times, January 18th 1991\n\nEvents of the day\n\nAmid retaliation speculation, President Bush says Israel has promised not to respond to Iraq's attack.\n\nBush and other leaders caution against euphoria of early success, warning that war is liable to be long.\n\nUnited States undertakes \"the darndest search and destroy mission ever undertaken\" against SCUDS and promises Patriot missiles to Israel in an effort to avert Israeli retaliation.\n\nOil falls to $19.25 per barrel.\n\nWorld leaders condemn missile attack on Israel.\n\nSyria appears to indicate it would tolerate retaliatory strike by Israel. Egypt say it would tolerate retaliation.\n\nJordanian Parliament labels United States a \"great Satan.\"\n\nAntiwar protests continue worldwide, with large anti-American marches in Pakistan and Algeria.\n\nABC poll says 71% of Americans disapprove of domestic protesters and 83% support the war.\n\nPolitical events\n\nDefense Secretary Cheney declared an \"airlift emergency\" and activated Stage II of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet plan. This authorized the government to contact with civil air carriers to use up to 181 aircraft to help ferry United States war supplies to the Middle East. Domestic airlines had hauled 65% of the troops and 22% of the cargo destined for the United States buildup in Saudi Arabia.\n\nCombat operations (Air, Land and Sea)\n\n196 TOMAHAWK cruise missiles have been launched. Additionally, 2,107 attack sorties have been flown by USN, USMC, USAF, USA and coalition forces; assessed as 80% effective.\n\nIn air-to-air engagements, 8 Iraqi MIG-29s and Mirage F-1s are destroyed; 2 by 2 USN F/A-18s of USS SARATOGA-based Strike Fighter Squadron-81 (directed by E-2Cs from Carrier Air Wing-17).\n\nFirst Navy combat \"kills\". F/A-18s then transitioned, and bombed targets. United States Navy has lost 2 additional aircraft, both A-6s. The crewmen, LT Jeffrey Zaun and LT Robert Wetzel of the USS SARATOGA's Attack Squadron 35, and LT Charles Turner and LT William Costen of USS RANGER's Attack Squadron 155 are missing.\n\nTwo F-16Cs from 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Torrejon AB) shot down by surface-to-air missiles; pilots taken prisoner.\n\nPhoto: F/A-18 Hornet and A-6E Intruder aircraft from Carrier Air Wing 1 (CVW-1) conduct an in-flight refueling with a pair of U.S. Air Force KC-135R Stratotanker aircraft while en route to their target during Operation Desert Storm. A Fighter Squadron 33 (VF-33) F-14A Tomcat aircraft, also from CVW-1, is in the foreground. CVW-1 is based aboard the aircraft carrier USS AMERICA (CV 66).\n\nA USMC OV-10 is downed, the first Marine combat aircraft loss. The two aircrewmen, LtCol Clifford Acree and CWO Guy Hunter are missing.\n\nUSS NICHOLAS (FFG-47), operating with embarked Helicopter Anti- Submarine Squadron (Light) 44, Det. 8/USA helos and a Kuwaiti patrol boat, engaged and neutralized Iraqi forces firing on coalition aircraft with antiaircraft artillery and shoulder-fired SAMs from eleven Kuwaiti oil platforms in northern Arabian Gulf In the first combined helicopter missile and surface ship gun engagement, 5 Iraqis are killed, 3 wounded and 23 Iraqis, the first enemy prisoners of war, are taken board USS NICHOLAS for transfer to USMC holding facility and Saudi Arabian EPW camp.\n\nUSS MOOSBRUGGER (DD-980) SEALs board Sudanese vessel EL OBEID, the first boarding by a Navy ship since commencement of hostilities.\n\nBaghdad is without electricity. Iraq's strategic air defense system is severely disrupted. Several intelligence and sector operations centers are damaged or destroyed. Poor antiaircraft and surface to-air missile fire discipline was exhibited by Iraqi forces, no communications are detected in the southern early warning radar networks. Iraqi defense are described as \"stunned.\" Except for limited artillery action along the coast and in the tri-border area, no other Iraqi ground activity is noted. Analysts believed that Iraqi ground forces were staying in defensive positions for protection from United States and coalition air attacks. Unconfirmed reports from Kuwaiti resistance elements stated that Iraq is to begin destroying Kuwaiti oil rigs.\n\nPhoto: Baghdad skies erupt with anti-aircraft fire as U.S. warplanes strike targets in the Iraqi capital in the early morning\n\nPost by lordroel on\n\nDAY 4 of operation Desert Storm, Saturday, January 19th 1991\n\nEvents of the day\n\nSaddam said to remain \"defiant, dangerous and unpredictable.\"\n\nIran's parliament reaffirms neutral stance in conflict.\n\n25,000 anti-war protesters march in DC.\n\nIraq says 70 have been killed in air raids so far, offers a cash reward for downed allied pilots. Claims civilians and religious shrines have been targeted.\n\nSoviets, Indians and Algerians offer peace proposals to Iraq.\n\nPolitical events\n\nUnited States State Department announces transfer of diplomatic notes with Iraq reaffirming United States intention to abide by its legal obligations under the 1940 Geneva Convention relative to the protection of POWs, and expects Iraq (a signatory) to reciprocate; second note affirms legal protection from attack on United States military hospital ships in regional waters.\n\nPresident Bush signs Executive Order 12743 extending the call-up of up to one million National Guard/Reserves for up to two years; Department of Defense will implement incrementally raising ceiling on 161,887 National Guard/Reserves currently called up to 360,000.

Iraqi targets receiving emphasis are SCUD fixed and mobile launch systems, the Republican Guard, military headquarters, and nuclear-biologic chemical facilities. 4 strike packages and all F117 missions are aborted due to area weather.\n\nA B-52 that flew a mission from Diego Garcia sustained battle damage and was recovered at Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The tail of the aircraft was severely damaged aft of the parachute door by a surface-to-air missile. There was no major damage to the vertical or horizontal stabilizers, and flight characteristics were not noticeably impaired. The aircraft flew to Andersen AFB. Guam, where a G model with a cracked wing spar was on station and could be cannibalized.\n\nAn MC-130 leaflet drop is conducted, disseminating over a million leaflets into the KTO with \"surrender, defect, and abandon equipment\" messages.\n\nAt least three SCUDS explode in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Israel had previously received two Patriot systems, but the batteries were not operational because Israel did not want American technicians to operate them. Due to the Scud missile attacks. Israel accepted the additional Patriot systems and allowed Americans technicians to operate them.\n\nPhoto: A Tornado GR.1 returning to Muharraq after attacking a target\n\nThe Package Q Strike ore also known as “Package Q,” happened, the strike group consisted of 56 F-16Cs from the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing and 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, along with some F-4Gs from the 561st Fighter Squadron and Boeing F-15Cs from the 53d Fighter Squadron.\n\nLockheed-Martin F-16Cs from the 401 TFW (Provisional) at Torrejon Air Base in Spain, were tasked with destroying three targets in Baghdad: the Iraqi Air Force Headquarters, the Republican Guard Headquarters, and a large oil refinery. Vipers from the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at Hill Air Force Base in Utah would be spearheading the strike, assigned to a nuclear research facility on the outskirts of the capital.\n\nAs Package Q approached the initial point, anti-aircraft artillery (Triple-A, or AAA) opened up on them, hurling a staggering amount of lead into the sky. Most of the flack was between ten and twelve thousand feet, but some of the large-caliber rounds were detonating as high as 27,000ft (8,230m). The low altitude Triple-A became so thick it appeared to form its own cloud layer. There were thousands of anti-aircraft guns alerted to their presence, as well as hundreds of SAM emplacements along their route and around Baghdad itself.\n\nThe Wild Weasels left the fray early, either because they were “Arizona” and fired all of their HARMs, or because they experienced critical fuel states and needed to leave in order to get back safely. Warnings about the departure of the Weasels went unheard. The Boeing F-15C Eagles providing the Offensive Counter Air pre-strike sweep also departed as the first wave of the strikes peeled off their target. Again, a warning about their departure went unheard. Unbeknownst to the Viper drivers from the 401 TFW, they were all pretty much flying straight into hell’s mouth with no air cover, no electronic warfare support, and no SEAD assets available to assist them.\n\nA low overcast deck mostly obscured the Iraqi Air Force Headquarters and the Republican Guard Headquarters, so the package commander called a weather abort for those two targets. The southern portion of the city was clear, and the oil refinery was clearly visible. As they approached the action point to roll in on the refinery, a SAM launch warning was received.\n\nMajor Emmett “ET” Tullia, flying under the mission callsign of “Stroke 3,” received additional SA-2 and SA-3 acquisition warnings that went unheeded as he rolled in on the towers. The high angle diving delivery prevented the electronic countermeasures pod from detecting the SAM acquisition until he pulled off the target and turned south. As the missiles closed, a nightmare falsetto of the radar warning receiver announced the missile launches. The SAMs overshot and harmlessly detonated above his aircraft, and he turned back to the egress heading.\n\nTullia became separated from the rest of the package because of his missile defense. As he evaded the initial SAMs coming off the target, more missiles launched, this time from both rear quadrants of his aircraft. Training for SAM launches up to this point had been more or less book learning, recommending violent turns approximately shortly prior to missile impact, forcing the missile to overshoot and create enough distance to negate the effects of the detonating warhead. The hard part is to see the missile early enough to make all the mental calculations and not get smashed into bits.\n\nTullia continued to unload and accelerate, watching the missiles as they closed on his aircraft. As he reefed his Viper into yet another series of gut-wrenching turns, one missile passed so close that Tullia heard the roar of the rocket motor as it went by. Finally, as he reached the outskirts of the city, an optically guided missile of unknown type is fired at the F-16. There is no radar warning of the launch, Tullia forced the missile to overshoot and it exploded harmlessly out of range.\n\nMajor Tullia came back to the 401st’s Forward Operating Base in Doha, Qatar squawking “Code 1,” meaning the jet was in perfect working order and required no significant attention from maintenance. After walking around the jet post-flight, he changed it to Code 2 because he discovered all of his missile countermeasures–the chaff and flare modules–were still full. His crew chief was absolutely astonished at the discovery. The countermeasures never fired off, so Tullia successfully defeated seven SAMs of one flavor or other…on flying skill alone.\n\nYouTube (F-16 dodging 6 Iraqi SAM launches on January 19th 1991)\n\nHowever while Major Tullia was lucky to get home safely, two other F-16s were shot down, with two pilots becoming POWs.\n\nPhoto: Remains of F-16C #87-0257 from the 614th Tactical Fighter Squadron 'Lucky Devils', shot down over Iraq during Operation Desert Storm.

I suspect the former but wondering. Since its in the Red Sea, which should be pretty safe from Iraqi attack possibly it could have surfaced for the launch or was that totally unnecessary.\n\nb) Do you know what Arizona means here? Guessing since they were on anti-radar missions they detected targets and fired all their missiles, hence there was no significant point in them staying around.\n\nc) Tullia was both very skilled and very lucky given the failure of his countermeasure systems. Wonder if that was a one off or happened with other a/c but hopefully they investigated and found out why as otherwise could cause other losses and not good for moral.\n\nThanks again for the details your putting into all this.\n\nSteve\n\nPost by lordroel on\n\nDAY 5 of operation Desert Storm, Sunday, January 20th 1991\n\nEvents of the day\n\nIraqi TV broadcasts pictures of three US, two British, one Italian, one Kuwaiti airmen captured after their airplanes are hit by Iraqi ground fire.\n\nSaddam says only a fraction of his arsenal has been used, and calls for holy war, for all Arabs to target allied interests \"wherever they may be.\"\n\nIraqis parade POWs blindfolded through Baghdad streets, claim to have shot down 154 allied planes.\n\nAssad says Syria will stay out of war, even if Israel retaliates.\n\nUnited States increases pressure on Japan and Germany to contribute more money to Desert Storm.

Voice contact was lost prior to arrival of the CSAR forces, and although the mission penetrated 10 nautical miles inside Iraq, no contact was made.\n\nPsychological operation (PSYOPS) leaflets are dispersed along the Kuwaiti and Iraqi borders. PSYOPS in support of combat operations began with the broadcast of news and surrender and abandon equipment appeals to Iraqi forces in the KTO. An F-16 leaflet bomb drop was conducted over Baghdad with \"world is united against Saddam\" and \"abandon weapons\" messages.\n\nIraq's defenses were assessed to be \"largely disrupted\" and airfields damaged \"but usable\"; the Iraqi Air Force was described as \"still dangerous.\" Major damage was done to many nuclear-chemical-biological facilities. The country's infrastructure was \"battered,\" and government facilities were \"damaged\" by the air war. The main objectives of the air campaign were to find and destroy Scuds, attack Iraq's integrated air defense system and command-control communication centers, destroy chemical and biological weapon storage and production facilities, attack airfields, destroy military supply and production facilities and attack Republican Guard forces.\n\nThere was no change in Iraqi air operations for the preceding forty-eight hours. Limited defensive counter air operations were conducted but there was no indication that Iraq prepared to attempt any type of offensive counter air campaign. Analysts believed that the degradation of air command and control nodes contributed to the lack of air activity. Iraq was using a system of human spotters along the Saudi-Iraqi border to provide early waning.\n\nLimited bomb damage imagery made assessment of results difficult. There were limited operations at several Iraqi airfields, but all appeared usable. Some aircraft shelters and runways were hit. Iraqi antiaircraft and surface to-air missile units were using barrage fire without radar control. Some backup early warning radars were restored by Iraqi technicians. Moderate damage was done to the Baghdad Nuclear Research Center; the Isis reactor was breached and spewing steam, but no radiation. Several government buildings in Baghdad were severely damaged; three or four appeared destroyed. Heavy damage was done to the telephone system.\n\n2 of Iraq's estimated 30 fixed Scud launchers were confirmed destroyed. 10 of estimated 36 mobile Scud launchers were listed as unconfirmed losses.\n\nPhoto: A U.S. Navy Grumman F-14B Tomcat from Fighter Squadron 74 (VF-74) Be-Devilers rolls down the No. 2 catapult aboard the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-60) as it is launched during \"Operation Desert Storm\".\n\nPost by lordroel on\n\nDAY 6 of operation Desert Storm, Monday, January 21st 1991\n\nEvents of the day\n\nForeign Minister of Iraq Tariq Aziz accepts the Soviet peace plan.

President Bush condemned the act and said it would not alter American strategy in the Persian Gulf War.\n\nPresident Bush officially designated the Persian Gulf area and surrounding waters a combat zone, a move that exempted the armed forces serving there from income tax on their military pay. The president's executive order also gave the military in the war zone more time to file their income taxes' They were not required to file their Form 1040s until 180 days after they departed the Gulf.\n\nCombat operations (Air, Land and Sea)\n\nOver 8,000 sorties have been flown; air operations focus continues on neutralizing fixed/mobile SCUD launch sites and troop concentrations.\n\nPhoto: An air-to-air view of two U.S. Air Force F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft from the 33rd Tactical Fighter Wing, Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., and a Royal Saudi Air Force F-5E Tiger II fighter aircraft during a mission in support of Operation Desert Storm.

Suspected and confirmed Scud positions were attacked by using prepared and airborne alert missions. Other targets were airfields, military and industrial production and storage facilities, command-control-communication centers, Republican Guard forces, and ground controlled intercept sites. Thirty-three packages attacked enemy targets. Three package were canceled due to weather in the target area- Weather hindered precise targeting and caused air crews to shift to alternate targets or radar bombing with limited success. Thirty-one A-10 sorties attacked Iraqi Army forces and mobile Scuds along the Saudi border. MARCENT reported the rapid response of USCENTCOM and CENTAF to shift JSTARS surveillance areas to a real-time threat followed by rapid interdiction response.\n\nPsychological operations included daily radio broadcasts and Volant Solo nightly broadcasts into the KTO. An MC-130 leaflet drop disseminated a million \"surrender appeal\" leaflets into the KTO, while a bomb drop (F-15) spread 90,000 leaflets.\n\nThe Iraqi Air Force is still considered \"dangerous.\" \"Good Progress\" is made in destroying Iraq s nuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) warfare capabilities. Some NBC facilities are severely damaged. \"Fair progress\" is made against Iraq's offensive potential; however, SCUDS still remain a threat, and the Republican Guard remains strong. \"Heavy damage\" to government buildings is accomplished and telecommunication and electrical power are disrupted.\n\nAntiaircraft artillery is Iraq's most effective air defense threat. Barrage fire, from 57-mm or smaller artillery, is firing to an altitude of 10,000 to 15,000 feet. Iraq is making a major effort to reconstitute its integrated air defense system.\n\nPhoto: A U.S. Air Force F-111F fighter aircraft from the 494th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 48th Tactical Fighter Wing, RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, takes off for a mission in support of Operation Desert Storm.
