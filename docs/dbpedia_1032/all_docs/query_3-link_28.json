Father Oswald was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1972. Chaplain Oswald served in parishes in Milwaukee until 1991 when he joined the Chaplains staff at the Veterans Hospital. In 1994, he was appointed Chief of Chaplain Service at the Medical Center. In addition to his duties at the Medical Center, he was appointed to the Veterans Administration Chaplain Advisory Board in 1996, and served a two-year term. He was subsequently appointed to the National Veterans Administration Chaplain Field Leadership Conference, representing the 12th Veterans Integrated Services of Chaplains. Chaplain Oswald will now deliver the Memorial Address for the 101st Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention. MEMORIAL ADDRESS FATHER NORMAN OSWALD: Good morning, everyone. In 1972 when I was ordained, I had a hope and a dream and a promise that stemmed from the family that I grew up in. My father was a veteran of World War II, served in what was then the Army Air Corps. He was called back for the Korean Conflict, and by then it was the United States Air Force. And I had always hoped and dreamed to follow in his footsteps and to put into my life words that were so important in his: duty, honor, God and country. While my plans, I guess, were not God's plans, because I was not allowed to go into the chaplaincy. The Bishop would not release me. However, God has a way out, and I am now proud to say that I work each and every day serving those who have served God and country, who have lived up to those words of honor and duty. I welcome you to our City of Milwaukee, and I also invite you to come, if you have time, to visit the VA Medical Center. I would like to share some thoughts with you this morning as we do this memorial. I have learned from one of our Rabbis on our staff that most of us have that word ``memory'' a little bit mixed up. Most of us had memory up here (indicating), and as I watched many of you here this morning you revealed to me what the Rabbi told me, that memory is something that happens down here (indicating). It is a word of the heart, and that is what I would like to address today, our hearts as we remember it. Years ago in this city, when we had one morning newspaper and an evening newspaper, there was a banner on the morning newspaper, and I paraphrase it, saying the only thing that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men and women to remain silent. Well, our veterans, men and women, have not remained silent. They have put their lives on the line to stand for what is right and what is trust, and they have lived up to their Lord's sacrifice, which means to affirm that which is holy, that which comes from the hand of God, and that which is valued. A number of years ago there was a cartoon in the paper, and most of my guys and gals at the VA know when I talk I am a little bit unorthodoxed. So you have to put up with me this morning. But Peanuts sometimes reveals some very deep truths that we need to ponder. One of them took place in Windsor. I know some of you don't know what Windsor is here in Wisconsin, but we do. Lucy runs into Charlie Brown, and Charlie Brown has an absolutely marvelous caring mother, and she had wrapped him in about fourteen sweaters, ten pairs of mittens, boots and a hat, and you can barely see his face. Charlie is proceeding to walk across the frozen lake. Charlie is burdened, and Charlie slips and Charlie falls down, and he is laying on his back like a turtle and he is calling, ``Help me, help me. Will someone help me?'' Lucy was walking by and she said, ``Oh, Charlie, what is your problem?'' He says, ``Lucy, help me.'' She says, ``Well, can't you get up?'' He said, ``Would you help me?'' She said, ``I will tell you what. I will hope for an early spring.'' Thank God our veterans have never had that attitude. They did not hope for an early spring through many long winters of their lives, but they made that spring happen to so many people around this world, who have cried for help. They have affirmed the treasure, indeed, of life, liberty, freedom and justice. It is that goal common from the hand of God. So as we remember these men and women who have gone before us and shared their stories, we really get in touch with that which is best in each and every one of us. I mentioned my father. One day my mother called me up, and my father passed away shortly before I was ordained, and my mother called me up and she said, ``I would like you to come home and help me clean out that one corner of the basement. We have never gotten to it.'' It is interesting, you get to this one corner of the basement that you have never gotten to, the things you discover, trash and treasures. I want you all to know my father was relatively famous for his fifteen minutes in World War II, and as we were cleaning out underneath I ran across a picture of my dad which appeared in our local paper. My dad, as I said, was in the United States Army Air Corps. The guys back then had a message for the folks that we were in conflict with then. They will throw everything at you but the kitchen sink. Guess what? My dad brought the kitchen sink home from Germany. That is not why I tell the story. Those of you that have been in service know when you go into service, quite often you bond with your fellows and you become closer to some of them than your own family, for they are by your side to give you strength and courage and to remind you why you are there. Again, those words, honor, guidance and service to God and country. I mentioned we were cleaning out underneath this cupboard, and I pulled this thing out from underneath the cupboard. I said, ``Well, this goes in the junk heap.'' And my mother said, ``Give me that.'' When my mother speaks like that, you listen. So I handed it to her and she began talking about my dad and his time of service in World War II. She started talking about my dad's best friend who came from a place called Piney Flats, Tennessee. I never would have known where Piney Flats was nor would I have to say I really cared if it wasn't for the story that I was to hear. This friend of my father's from Piney Flats, Tennessee, was like my dad, a bombardier. He befriended my father; he gave my father courage and strength when he needed it. My father's best friend, who gave him strength, was shot down and presumed killed in action. Now, as my mother was telling me the story of that friendship, sharing the memories, she was doing something to this thing that I thought was worthless. My mother also has an uncanny sense of timing, and she handed it to me and she had me taking off years of tarnish and dirt, and underneath it all was a sterling silver baby cup. On it was the name Norman Walker, the gentleman from Piney Flats, Tennessee, my father's fellow serviceman, a man of duty and honor. And underneath that name was engraved my name ``Norman Oswald'', and I know why I got that name, because that man from Piney Flats had hopes and dreams and visions and values that he died for. My father wanted to be reminded of that through the life of his son. So we gather today and throughout this convention to remember and to tell the stories that uncover the treasures of this nation and its greatest resources, the men and women who have stepped forward and sacrificed and given of themselves. There was another Charlie Brown episode. Charlie runs into Linus one day, and it is night time. Linus is carrying a little candle in his hand, and Charlie Brown says to Linus, ``What is this that you have?'' Linus said, ``Well, you know, I heard it is better to light just one little candle than to curse the darkness.'' Charlie says, ``That's true, although there are those who will disagree with you, Linus.'' The next frame has Linus going, ``Oh, you stupid darkness.'' Well, again, the men and women that we light those candles of hope that burned brightly and give us direction as we move through this world. I would like to close with this reflection. This is something that was given to me a few years ago. It was a beautiful meditation. It is entitled ``I Am A Veteran.'' We are reminded at the beginning of this reflection of something General Omar Bradley said, that veterans are God's gift to us and freedom is their gift to the world. ``I Am A Veteran.'' ``Oh, God, I am a veteran, hear my prayer. I shivered in that cold winter in Valley Forge and rejoiced in the glorious thunder at Yorktown. I went as the flames engulfed Washington and said never again. I wore blue and blood red. I wore gray, and I bled red, but what blood I spilled was to reunite a nation of the people, by the people and for the people. ``I am a veteran. I was at Little Big Horn and I prayed. I was at Wounded Knee and I prayed, and I prayed that the new Americas and the old Americas would one day be one people. I was there to charge up the hill at San Juan knowing that my country was emerging beyond its borders. I was prepared to make the world safe for democracy. Young and idealistic, I came to France to turn back the horrors of war and the war to end all wars. ``I am a veteran. It was with my belief that I became part of the day which will live in infinity, and once more I said goodbye to those I loved to protect my country, across the vast desert I have met the enemy. I met him on island after island and I kept my promises. ``I met him on the beaches at Normandy. I repealed him in the gates and I freed thousands from the shadow of death. I am a veteran. A small nation cried out for help and I came because others had been there for me, a nation which saved. ``I felt your presence in the jungles of distant lands. I held my head high when others called most. I put on my uniform to save them from tyranny, and today I remain ready to pledge my life, my property, my sacred honor until there will be peace and freedom on earth for everywhere and everyone. O God, I am a veteran. Hear my prayer. Amen.'' (The Festival City Barbershop Chorus sang ``This Is My Country'' at this time.)

For those that have any children with you or guests with you, I ask if they want to come with you tomorrow morning, please stop by the credentials table and get these name tags for all the guests that would like to participate tomorrow morning. I thank you once again, and I thank all the officers for their participation and all our guests. I hope you enjoy this Milwaukee Convention because they have done an outstanding job. I now close the Memorial Service and thank each and every one of you. God bless you all. (Whereupon, the Memorial Service was concluded at 9:30 o'clock a.m.) JOINT OPENING SESSION MONDAY, AUGUST 21, 2000 (The Joint Opening Session of the 101st National Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States and the 87th National Convention of the Ladies Auxiliary, was called to order on Monday, August 21, 2000, at 8:00 o'clock a.m., in the Midwest Express Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, by Adjutant General John Senk.) ALL AMERICAN COMMANDERS AND OUTSTANDING COMMUNITY SERVICE POSTS ADJUTANT GENERAL SENK: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am John Senk, Adjutant General of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

(Applause) Seated behind the All American Commanders are the 1999-2000 Outstanding Community Service Post winners, represented by their Commanders and Auxiliary Presidents. Please stand and receive your recognition. (Applause) INTRODUCTION OF HELEN PUTNAM BLACKWELL Before we begin our formal agenda, I was to introduce to you a lady that was the granddaughter of the founder of our organization, James Putnam. Unfortunately, this morning she was taken ill and had to be taken to the hospital, and I ask that you keep her in your prayers. It is now time to officially open the 101st National Convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Please welcome a Past VFW Commander-in-Chief, a proud Korean War veteran and this year's National Convention Chairman, from the great State of Wisconsin, Walter G. ``Wally'' Hogan.

I welcome you on behalf of myself and all who are working so hard to make this convention a great success. We sincerely hope the time that you spend with us will renew your pride in our nation, rededicate your commitment to America's veterans and bring new excitement to your work as a member of the VFW and its Ladies Auxiliary. Please rise as we officially open this convention with the advancing of the colors. National Sergeant-at-Arms, you will prepare the room to advance the colors.

INTRODUCTION OF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF PAST COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HOGAN: How about a nice hand for our National officers and our Ladies Auxiliary officers. (Applause) It is now my pleasure to introduce a gentleman who has served the Veterans of Foreign Wars for many years. He was elected to the office of Commander-in-Chief at the organization's 100th National Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, August 20, 1999. He is the first member from the State of New Hampshire elected to this position. John served in the United States Army from October, 1970, to April of 1973. In Vietnam, he was assigned to the 176th Assault Helicopter Squadron. John served as the Department of New Hampshire Adjutant/Quartermaster from 1985 to 1997, and now continues to serve his Department as Quartermaster. He is currently a Life Member of VFW Post 483 in Nashua, New Hampshire. He also is a member of the Military Order of the Cootie, American Legion, Elks, Association of U.S. Army and the Retired Firefighters Association, following a 21-year career as a firefighter in Nashua, New Hampshire. He has also served as Chairman of the Board of Managers of the New Hampshire Veterans Home since 1987. He has also served as a State Representative from Congressional District 28, Nashua, New Hampshire. Please join me in giving a warm welcome to a man whose dedication to veterans has highlighted this first year in a ``New Century of Service'', Commander-in-Chief John Smart. I present to you Commander-in-Chief John Smart from the great state of New Hampshire. ...Whereupon, the assembly extended a prolonged standing ovation to Commander- in-Chief Smart. ... PAST COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF HOGAN: John, it is indeed my pleasure to turn over the reins of this convention to you, by presenting you with the gavel, bell and the badge. I wish for you a most successful 101st National Convention. REMARKS BY COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: Thank you, Wally. Good morning, comrades and sisters. Can you hear me? You can't tell that I am a little excited, can you? Good morning to each and every one of you, and to you, Wally and to the Department of Wisconsin and to your Committee, thank you for a wonderful job for this 101st National Convention. To Lorraine Frier, and all the officers of the Ladies Auxiliary, and to my officers, and to each and every one of you, I have dedicated this convention to all those brave men and women who served during the Korean War. I now ask all Korean War veterans to please stand and be recognized. Let's show our respect for their service to their country. (Applause) One year ago, I pledged to you and to the Veterans of Foreign Wars that, with all my spirit and strength, I would never relent, or be silent, in my service to our nation's true heroes, our veterans and those in uniform who serve America today. One year ago, I urged you to get involved because each of you has earned the right to make a difference. This morning, I am here to say that you have made me proud. You have made a difference. You have helped chart the course for a ``New Century of Service.'' Today, thanks to your efforts and those of our Ladies Auxiliary, veterans and the men and women of our armed services are better off than they were a year ago. Thanks to your efforts, our programs have new vitality and, as I travel throughout this country, I have seen a new level of enthusiasm and commitment in our members and supporters. Your dedication and hard work have given the VFW's second century of service a grand and glorious beginning. For that, you have my sincere and heartfelt gratitude. (Applause) Over the past year, we have achieved great successes together. Unfortunately, great challenges still lie ahead. As I visited VA hospitals and VA nursing homes across the nation, I am still finding veterans who must wait weeks and sometimes months to get the treatment they need. This is especially true of veterans who need special care. Today, the VA claims process is still a major problem. Today, some veteran's claims are taking up to 205 days to be processed before compensation begins. Too often, hearings to review the disputed claims take months, then the review boards too frequently adjudicate them incorrectly. The hearing process must then begin again resulting in further delays before the veteran receives due compensation. These processing problems must be corrected now, today. (Applause) Our veterans are suffering and, in some cases dying, while bureaucrats push their paperwork from desk to desk. I have visited with literally hundreds of our World War II veterans, many who are seeking VA health care for the first time, but they have little prospect of getting the long-term care they need. Dear friends, these are the very individuals who saved America and the world from tyranny and returned to rebuild the land of opportunity and prosperity that we enjoy today. We cannot � and we will not � allow them to go without the services they so desperately need. (Applause) My year as Commander-in-Chief of the greatest veterans organization in the world is almost over. But, I will not stop and I know you will not stop working to ensure full and complete health care for all veterans. During the past year, I have traveled overseas and here at home to meet with our brave young men and women in uniform. I wish you could feel the pride I have felt as I shake their hands, hear of their dedication and see the hope in their eyes for America's future. Unfortunately, they remain underpaid, ill-equipped, over-deployed and continue to be a test bed for social change in our nation. In uniform, they are limited to what they can do to change their situation. I am here to tell you that they are looking to us to speak out for them. We have and we will continue to do so. (Applause) We must continue to write, call and testify to our politicians until these issues are properly addressed. We must continue to speak up against overseas deployments where there is no clear objective, minimal commitment of resources and no clear exit strategy or time frame. We must ensure that our military resources are used for America's security and in the best national interest. These are our sons, our daughters and our grandchildren who have willingly put their lives and their futures on the line for America and we cannot and will not let them down. (Applause) This week, you will have the opportunity to hear from the two individuals who seek to become the next President of these United States, our President. I do not presume to influence your decision concerning either gentleman. However, I ask you, from the bottom of my heart, listen carefully to what they have to say. Take time to review the platform of their respective parties. Make yourself aware of their past records and the future they propose for America. Then, and only then, go to the polls in November and exercise the right that America's veterans have sacrificed for. Vote and encourage everyone you know to vote. Better men than you and I have died to give us that right and we dare not fail them. In conclusion, I want you to know what this year as your Commander-in-Chief has meant to me. I have been an active part of the Veterans of Foreign Wars for the better part of my adult life. From the beginning, I have known beyond no doubt that the VFW is the best and most effective veterans service organization in the world. You, the VFW and our Ladies Auxiliary, have done and are doing more for this nation than perhaps any other single group. I am humbled and grateful for the opportunity to have been your spokesman for the past twelve months. It has been my distinct and sincere pleasure to represent you in Washington, to the troops deployed overseas, to our fellow veterans in VA hospitals, and to America's media. You have made me proud to be counted among your ranks. I leave with the sincere hope that I have been the kind of Commander-in-Chief that you wanted me to be. I hope I have carried your banner well and I hope I have spoken your voice effectively and with conviction. I hope you will remember John Smart as a Commander-in-Chief that cares deeply for America, for our veterans and for each and every one of you. As I always conclude my reports or remarks to you, let me say God bless you, God bless America, and have a great week here in Milwaukee. Thank you, comrades, sisters and friends. (Applause) INTRODUCTION OF MR. MIKE SOIKA, MAYOR'S CHIEF OF STAFF COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: Milwaukee will be the home of the VFW National Convention for this year and next year. If you have not discovered it already, Milwaukee has a lot to offer its visitors. Here to bring greetings from Milwaukee's office of the Mayor is the Mayor's Chief of Staff, Mike Soika. I like it when a plan comes together. (Laughter) I know the Governor is here. INTRODUCTION OF THE HONORABLE TOMMY THOMPSON, GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: Our next guest is a veteran, having served in both the Wisconsin National Guard and the Army Reserve. He began his political career with his election to the Wisconsin General Assembly in 1966, serving as Minority Leader and Assistant Minority Leader. Elected Governor of Wisconsin in 1986, he is currently serving his fourth consecutive term. He is a Past Chairman of the National Governors' Association; the Republican Governors' Association, and the Education Commission of the States. He is the current Chairman of the Council of State Governments and the Amtrak Board of Directors. I want to personally thank Governor Thompson for his kindness to the VFW as the Chairman of the Republican Platform Committee. Governor Thompson personally met with VFW staff members to hear our concerns regarding veterans and military issues. After reviewing and understanding our concerns, they were incorporated in the party platform. For this and on behalf of all veterans, the military and their families, I say thank you, Mr. Governor. Now, please welcome a true friend of America's veterans, the Honorable Tommy Thompson, Governor of Wisconsin. GREETINGS - THE HONORABLE TOMMY THOMPSON GOVERNOR THOMPSON: Thank you so very much. Thank you, John. Thank you for your leadership, your passion and your direction. The Auxiliary, to all the members, Miss America, I thank you. I thank you for being the great Americans that you all are. I am very honored to be with you today at the first Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention of this century and the first one in Wisconsin in about 50 years. I welcome you to Milwaukee on behalf of the Mayor and to the great State of Wisconsin. Please, ladies and gentlemen, help our economy. Spend some money. When I look out over this audience, I see an array of individuals, but you all have something very much in common. You are the true American heroes. You are more deserving of our respect and admiration than any athlete, movie star, politician or other celebrity. You represent the spirit of America, the spirit exemplified by President and former soldier, Teddy Roosevelt. He once said, ``No man is worth his salt who is not ready at all times to risk his body, to risk his well-being, to risk his life in a great cause.'' Some of you served in foreign lands during World War II. That war was the pivotal event of our century. The men and women that won that war made a contribution to our country that will never again be equaled. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in World War II history. Movies like Saving Private Ryan, ``The Thin Red Line'' have vividly portrayed the hardships endured by our World War II veterans. Although World War II veterans are receiving the attention they deserve, our lasting tribute has eluded them, a memorial in Washington, D.C., which I think is badly needed, and with your help we will succeed and we will get it done. (Applause) However, this will change soon, thanks to that nationwide effort. Wisconsin is proud to do its part. We set out to raise $332,000, led by my wonderful Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Ray Boland. We have these dog tags we sell for a buck apiece, and I gave him twenty dollars and I asked for change, and he said, ``That's just a contribution, Governor.'' Harley-Davidson just gave $250,000 for the World War II Memorial Center on Saturday. (Applause) This monument is going to be a fitting tribute to our World War II veterans. Succeeding generations of American veterans have maintained the legacy of those World War II veterans. Many of you here today served in Vietnam. This conflict is still a hotly-debated topic. But that in no way diminishes the bravery, the selfless sacrifice and the honor of the Americans who fought in Southeast Asia. Others of you served in the recent conflicts, in the Persian Gulf, Kosovo, Bosnia, or in other peace-keeping missions. The men and women who assumed this awesome task have remained vigilant in lonely outposts far from home. You have my thanks and admiration. Let's make sure that our military is prepared to fight when they need to fight any place in this world. All veterans, no matter when they served, where they served or in what capacity, deserve our internal thanks, and I thank you. I think the Korean veterans are the ones today after fifty years that need to be recognized, the forgotten war. It is very near and dear to me. On June 25th, our nation observed the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the Korean War. This conflict lasted more than three years. The battles were brutal and the conditions deplorable. During that 37 months of the war, 54,000 Americans died. One of those killed in action was Mitchell Red Cloud, a native American from a rural community in West Central Wisconsin. Just before dawn, he was positioned in front of his company's command post when he detected the approach of Chinese Communist forces. He gave the alarm. Then he immediately began firing at the charging enemy. His accurate and intense fire checked the assault and gained time for his company to consolidate its defense. He maintained his firing position until he was severely wounded. Refusing assistance, he pulled himself up to his feet, wrapped his arm around a tree and continued to fire until he was fatally wounded. His heroic act stopped the enemy from overrunning his company. For his gallantry above and beyond the call of duty, his award is the Medal of Honor. Like Mitchell Red Cloud, all of you, and all of those who served in the Korean War, helped stem the tide of Communist aggression in Asia. In memory of my brother, Charles, who was wounded several times serving as a Marine for thirty-some months in Korea, in the Chosen Reservoir, I dedicate my veterans speeches to him. He served throughout the entire war, and like his comrades, the incredible pain and suffering he went through. But I want all of our Korean War veterans here today to know they are not forgotten. Because of the efforts of our Korean veterans and those that came before them and after them, this nation is the greatest country on earth, the sole remaining super power, thanks to you and thanks to all of you for what you have been able to accomplish. (Applause) But today, all of you, rightfully could have rested on your laurels when the fight had ended, but your service did not end at the time of discharge from the military, absolutely not, because you are leaders. After you returned home, you continued to serve your nation, your state, your communities in so many ways. I couldn't begin to list all of the great works that the VFW has accomplished since it began more than a century ago. It continues today under your great leader, John Smart. Each day the VFW and Auxiliary members perform acts of service that go unnoticed. You visit the sick in VA hospitals. You speak to school children about patriotism and you teach appreciation for our flag, and the flag is sacred and should not be destroyed and burned. For all that you have done, while you have worn the military uniform, and for all you have done when you have donned the VFW cap, I personally salute you. I realize you face numerous challenges in trying to sustain your Posts and your membership. Our down-sized military means fewer veterans which makes recruitment very difficult. But I urge each of you and your leadership to keep trying to keep this organization alive and vital. We need you now more than ever. We need you to continue to advocate for better health care and other services for veterans. We need you to make our veterans aware of the benefits that they have earned and, yes, we are entitled to and should get in each state in America. Here in Wisconsin, we have a tradition of providing numerous benefits and services for our state's veterans. We are continuing to improve our veterans' programs through the efforts of my secretary who was voted by all of his peers in the veterans' departments across the country as the number one veterans secretary in America, my secretary, Ray Boland, who is here, who started the first program for homeless veterans. We have set it up now and it is being copied in other states in America. Both Ray and I have testified in Congress for homeless veterans and for better medical care for veterans, and we will continue testifying in Congress until every veteran in America gets what they are entitled to, what they deserve and should have. And we will fight until they get it. I just sponsored a resolution with all 50 Governors in Pennsylvania at our annual meeting saying we are going to join with the VFW and continue our united efforts to make sure that we serve the veterans better. We have accomplished much, but we have much more to do. We can reach our lofty goals because of organizations and your leadership and veterans just like you in every community in America. When called to serve, you took a solemn oath to give your own life, if necessary, to protect the lives of your fellow citizens You were willing to give up your own freedom so others could be free. What a noble cause. That experience taught you to understand why freedom is so critically important to Americans. Former prisoner of war Everett Alvarez, Jr., once said, ``You never know how sweet freedom can be unless you have lost it for eight and one-half years.'' Now, you work tirelessly on behalf of your fellow veterans in your communities and because of you and what you did years ago, and what you are doing today and will do tomorrow, we are a better nation and a better world, and the last remaining super power in this country. God bless all of you, God bless the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and above all, God bless America. Thank you. I salute you. (Applause) PRESENTATION OF AMERICAN FLAG SETS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: It is now my pleasure to introduce Sharon Peterson, the Ladies Auxiliary National Patriotic Instructor, presenting flag sets to Mike Soika and Governor Thompson. Let's give them a warm round of applause. (Applause) NATIONAL PATRIOTIC INSTRUCTOR SHARON PETERSON: Thank you, Commander-in-Chief. Comrades, Sisters, Guests and Friends: I have some words for you to pay heed to. I have been kicked, trampled, burned and shot full of holes. I have fought battles but I prefer the untroubled air of a world at peace. I represent the freedom of humanity, and I shall fly high, thundering in silence for the whole world to hear. My gentle rustling in the breeze sounds out the warning to all who would bury me forever. That lull stands the population dedicated to liberty. For those who have perished for my right to freedom of flight, for those that will die and, indeed, for those who will live, I stand as a symbol of freedom, loving people. I have been carried into battle in far away lands, always for the cause of freedom. I am blood stained, torn and many times wearied and saddened by the thousands who have paid the supreme sacrifice. Do not let it all be for nothing. Tell me the brave all have died for a worthwhile cause. Be proud of what I represent and display me for all to see. Whether you call me Old Glory, Stars and Stripes, or the Star Spangled Banner, I shall fly forever as the symbol of your freedom, as I did for your ancestors and as I shall do for your heirs. I am your flag. God bless our nation that we are free to fly this symbol of freedom. (Applause) Governor Thompson, it is my honor and a privilege on behalf of our National President, Lorraine Frier, and the members of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States to present you with this flag set. We hope it will be displayed proudly and with honor in the surroundings of your office for all of Wisconsin to view. GOVERNOR THOMPSON: Thank you. Thank you very much. I can assure you that it will be in my office in Madison by 3:00 o'clock this afternoon when I return, and I will proudly salute it each and every morning I walk into that office. Thank you so very much. NATIONAL PATRIOTIC INSTRUCTOR PETERSON: The Mayor's representative is not here as of yet, but we also have a presentation of a flag set for the Mayor of Milwaukee. I am sure he will display that with pride and dignity for you that live here. Thank you very much. PRESENTATION OF VFW GOLD MEDAL OF MERIT AND CITATION TO LADIES AUXILIARY PRESIDENT LORRAINE FRIER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: I know every Commander-in-Chief believes that the President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars is the most special. I, too, believe that about Lorraine Frier and I am certain I can prove it. Even prior to her accepting the presidency of our Ladies Auxiliary, she was known to be a force to be reckoned with. Bright, articulate and outspoken, she hit the ground running with her commitment to patriotism and to the Ladies Auxiliary. Over the past year, she has raised her organization to new standards of commitment and dedication. Her energetic and aggressive approach to the duties of her office have established new standards by which Presidents of the Ladies Auxiliary will be judged. I am very proud of her and I know you are as well. To receive the VFW Gold Medal of Merit and Citation, please welcome a great patriot and my ``Mrs. Wonderful'', the President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Lorraine Frier. (Applause) ADJUTANT GENERAL SENK: Commander-in-Chief is presenting the Gold Medal of Merit and this Citation to Lorraine Frier, National President of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, 1999-2000. ``In special recognition of her untiring dedication to our country and in sincere appreciation for her exhilarating leadership as evidenced by the exceptional contributions of the Ladies Auxiliary to the programs and purposes of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Her �Free to Fly' spirit swept the country and renewed the commitment to the aims and goals of the Ladies Auxiliary. ``In Witness Whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and the Official Seal of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, this 21st day of August, 2000.'' This has been signed John W. Smart, Commander-in-Chief, and John J. Senk, Jr., Adjutant General. (Applause) RESPONSE - LADIES AUXILIARY PRESIDENT LORRAINE FRIER LADIES AUXILIARY PRESIDENT FRIER: What can I say? Commander-in-Chief John Smart, my ``Mr. Wonderful''. I have to let you all in on a little secret, however. When we were on the cruise, my daughter gave him another name, and that was ``The Big Kahuna''. So I mentioned this to my lovely Past President and line officers the other night at a meeting, and one of them commented that a year ago he was ``Mr. Wonderful'' and he ends up as ``The Big Kahuna''. But he is always my ``Mr. Wonderful''. Comrades and sisters, and our very distinguished guests that we have with us today, I am very honored and very, very pleased to accept this very special award from the Veterans of Foreign Wars. However, I don't accept it just for me, I accept it on behalf of all of my ladies in the Auxiliary, because they are the ones that do the work; they are the ones that have the dedication, they are the ladies of the greatest Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. It has been an exciting year of accomplishments, both for the VFW and the Ladies Auxiliary. It has been a year of many firsts. It has been my distinct pleasure and honor to serve all of you, but more importantly, to serve with my ``Mr. Wonderful'', John Smart. Our convention marks the 86th year of the Ladies Auxiliary to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. We have been partners ever since. I told the community activities honorees this morning at breakfast they were there because it proves once again that the Posts and the Auxiliaries working together spell success. Our Ladies Auxiliary is very proud of our legacy of service and our dedication to the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I would like to especially thank once again all of my ladies for your dedication and love, and I would like to thank all the comrades for the help that you have given to us because once again for the twelfth consecutive year the Ladies Auxiliary has raised over $3 million for cancer aid and research. (Applause) We are very, very proud of everything we have achieved because we have done it together, and once again joining together spells success for you, for the national organization and for our beautiful country. God bless each and every one of you. God loves you dearly, because I certainly do. Thank you so much, Commander. You are a very wonderful friend and my ``Mr. Wonderful''. I hope you have the most successful convention ever. God be with you each day and I love you dearly. ...Whereupon, the assembly extended a prolonged standing ovation. ... COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: Lorraine, never change, will you, please. INTRODUCTION OF SECRETARY OF DEFENSE WILLIAM COHEN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: It is indeed an honor and privilege this morning to introduce a gentleman who serves as Secretary of Defense. Mr. Secretary, before I introduce you, may I echo the words of all our members of the VFW and its Ladies Auxiliary. I want you to know, sir, that we have some of the finest, brightest, most dedicated men and women who serve in the armed forces of the United States. I can let you know, sir, we are very, very proud of each and every one of them. Thank you, sir. (Applause) William S. Cohen was sworn in as the nation's 20th Secretary of Defense on January 24, 1997. He previously served three terms as the U.S. Senator from Maine and three terms in the House of Representative from Maine's Second Congressional District. As a Senator, he was a sponsor of the G.I. Bill of 1984. His efforts led to the creation of the Rapid Deployment Force, which later became the Central Command, and the Maritime Pre-Positioning Program, both of which were key to America's success in the Gulf War. He has been a key factor in strengthening U.S. counterintelligence efforts and defending against foreign political and industrial espionage. He has received numerous awards for his work on behalf of our military personnel. Comrades, sisters, friends and guests, please welcome a friend of our men and women in uniform and a friend of America's veterans, the Honorable William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense. (Applause) RESPONSE - SECRETARY OF DEFENSE COHEN SECRETARY OF DEFENSE COHEN: Thank you, Commander-in-Chief Smart, everyone's ``Mr. Wonderful'', for your warm words and your leadership of this great organization. Let me also extend our words of congratulations to Heather French, Miss America, for all that you have done on behalf of our veterans and our soldiers, and we look forward to a very special ceremony later this year. Lorraine Frier, the National President of the Ladies Auxiliary, congratulations on your award as well. You have just done an outstanding job and as you pointed out you worked together. You bring together all of the forces that help support our forces in the field and the veterans who have served, so we are truly indebted to you and the Ladies Auxiliary as we are to the veterans themselves, and also the members of the VFW and all that you do. Janet and I were just talking as we were looking out into this vast audience how proud we are to be here amongst those of you who have done so much, not only for the veterans but for those who served and the contributions you make to humanity, the charitable efforts that you undertake. We are truly proud to be here to share just a few moments with you today. Also, I want to say that you have been such a powerful voice, not only for the veterans but everybody who serves today in uniform. You do so by standing up for our forces, their families, their quality of life, by sustaining the ties of friendship that bind this extended family together in such extraordinary fashion and by ensuring that the fundamental principles at the heart of our democracy are preserved and passed on to future generations. I also want to say on a personal note of privilege that I am delighted to be here today to address this distinguished gathering, but also because this afternoon you are going to be honoring my wife, Janet, for her extraordinary work on behalf of all who serve in uniform today. I can think of few, if any, who have been more active and none more committed to the cause of service of our members in the uniform and those who have served in the past, than my wife, Janet Langhart Cohen. And I wanted to be here today to pay special tribute to you. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, I can't see all of you, I can feel you out there in the audience. I must say that Janet and I have not had an opportunity to address an audience this large since we were privileged to help kick off the Indy 500 with their 500,000 patriots. I want to say that in the audience as we spoke, and then we are able to take the lead car around the lap and I recall that day very vividly, both of us do, because we had a Harrier that flew over all the crowd and then did a 360 in front of everyone there that day. I recall the words of everybody who was speaking and passing by with the roar of that crowd and everybody firing their engines. They looked up and they saw that Harrier and they said, ``That is the sound of freedom, and thank God, those planes are ours.'' (Applause) I can't tell you how proud we felt at that particular moment and virtually every day that we are privileged to serve this country. I must also tell you that whenever I address a new audience, and certainly one of this size, I feel a little bit like Henry Ford, who after having made all of his millions in this country decided he wanted to go back to his father land in County Cork, Ireland. His wealth had long preceded his arrival. So when he finally got there, there were a group of local town officers, and they were looking for a contribution to help in the construction of a local hospital. Ford was quite accustomed to be touched in that family, pulled out his checkbook and made out a check for $5,000. The next day in bold print, in the local press, it said, ``Ford Contributes $50,000 for the Construction of the Local Hospital.'' The town officials were duly embarrassed. They came rushing to Ford and they said, ``Oh, Mr. Ford, we are terribly sorry. A mistake has been made, it had to be a typographical error, and we will be happy to see to it that a retraction is printed in tomorrow's paper.'' Ford said, ``Wait a minute. I think I have got a better idea. You give me one wish and I will give you the balance of the $45,000.'' They said, ``That is an offer we can't refuse. Whatever it is you want, we will give it to you.'' He said, ``I want, when that hospital is finally completed, to have a plaque over the entranceway with a quote taken from the source of my choice.'' They said, ``It is done.'' He gave them the check for $45,000. The hospital was built, it is there today, and it has a quote taken from the book of Matthew. It says, ``I came unto you as a stranger, and you took me in.'' So, I want you to know I come unto you a little bit as a stranger today. I hope you will take me in but not quite in that fashion. First, I want to say and make one point. When I decided to leave public service after over a quarter of a century of serving in public office, I never expected to be called. I never expected to receive a call from President Clinton. I was on my way out the door into the privacy and the anonymity of private life, and I got a call from the White House saying, ``Would you be willing to serve as my Secretary of Defense?'' I asked the President at that time, I said, ``Why do you want to do this? You are a Democratic administration and I am a Republican.'' He said, ``I want to send a signal; I want to send a signal to the country and to Congress when it comes to national security there is no party label. We are not Republicans, we are not Democrats. It is not a question of moving left or right, Republican or Democrat. It is really a moving forward. I want to send that signal.'' I said, ``Mr. President, under those terms, I am happy to go back into the public service.'' I want you all to know it has been the greatest experience of my life and that of my wife, Janet. Every day that we go to the Pentagon, we are uplifted. It is the most exciting, extraordinary experience that one could ever hope to achieve to be the civilian head of the greatest military on the face of the earth. We are grateful every day that we visit. I want you to know that we have done a lot of traveling. I have traveled almost 700,000 miles during the past three and one-half years. Janet has been at least on 300,000 to 400,000 of those miles. We have been to Bosnia, to Kosovo, to Korea, to the Gulf, to the deserts of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. I want you to know how proud we are and how proud you should be of the men and women who were serving us. They are serving without complaint, they are serving with distinction. They are happy to be doing the job that they are doing. They are helping to spread the flag of freedom the world over. And today, more than any other time in the history of the world, more people are sleeping under that blanket of freedom than any time in the history of the world thanks to our men and women in the military. I know there is always controversy in dealing with the military. When I first took office, I looked at what was happening, what we were doing, and we were on a downward descent. Frankly, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, there was a tremendous demand for peace. I heard it when I was on Capitol Hill and serving in the Senate. My constituents in Maine were demanding it as were people the country over, saying now that we no longer have this visible enemy on the horizon, we need to restructure and downsize. We need to start pouring more of our resources into building our economy and to modernizing for the future with a smaller, more capable, more agile, more lethal force. So spending started to go dramatically lower. When I arrived in office, frankly, I took a look at what we had and I saw that Congress and the administration had taken the highest figure of what they could agree upon on what we should spend for national security and was told essentially this is what Congress and the administration have agreed on, and that is likely to be the number for the forseeable future. Well, after just 18 months, we decided that wasn't enough. We have begun the largest sustained increase in our military spending in a generation. We were looking at $43 billion being spent for procurement, an all-time low. We now, this year, have gone in just three and one-half years, gone from $43 billion to $60 billion. In five years, we will be at $70 billion, and climbing in the future in order to recapitalize and rebuild this wonderful military that we have. So what we have done, we have looked at the men and women and said, you know, we can never pay them enough but we can pay them more. That is precisely what we recommended and what we have done. We have now secured the largest pay raise in a generation. We now have returned that retirement benefit from 40 percent back up to 50 percent. We are now focusing on rebuilding our housing and our health-care system. As a result, we are starting to see retention and recruitment increase once again. It has been a tough environment. It has been a very tough environment. We have got the strongest economy we have had in over two decades, and we are competing for the same people that the private sector wants. They want the people that we want as well. So, they can pay two, three, four times as much. So we have got to draw from that same pool and not only draw them in but then hold them. So recruitment, retention is now starting to stabilize and increase as a result of what we have been able to do on a bipartisan basis. I again come back to the point I am not here as a Republican, I am not here on behalf of the Democratic administration, I came here today to simply talk to you, all of you who have supported our military, the contributions you have made as members yourself, but what you do in terms of trying to sustain this great military that we have today. That is the reason I wanted to be here today to talk to you, to tell you, yes, we can always do better. National defense is certainly a subject matter which is open to debate and improvement, and hopefully that will be the case whatever administration comes in next year. But I want you to know something. We have the finest, the best led, the best equipped, the best educated, the finest fighting force in the history of the world. We have that today. (Applause) I can point to any place on the globe, but I want you to think back just about a year ago. We were waging a war in Kosovo. It seems like a lot longer in terms of the time frame. But a year ago we waged the most successful air campaign in the history of the world. I want you to think about it. We had 38,000 sorties that were flown during that campaign. We lost two aircraft and no pilots. That is a record that has never been equalled. Then let me say to Saddam Hussein, or anyone else who wants to challenge the United States, Milosevic, or anyone else, Saddam has been put into a box and if he tries to move out of that box in any way, threaten his neighbors, he is going to be hit and hit hard. We have been able as a result of the commitment we have made globally to help stabilize the world for peace and security and prosperity, and that is the reason. That is why we are fully deployed. That is part of our shape to respond and prepare strategy. We need to be fully deployed and to send the signal to all of those in the world that we are there not to conquer territory, we are not there to try to grab land, we are there to promote stability, because where there is stability an investment will follow. If investment follows, it has a chance to develop and promote prosperity. If you have prosperity, you have a much greater chance of promoting democracy. When you have democracy, you have less chance for conflict and warfare. That is why we are fully deployed around the world. That is why we have 100,000 people spread throughout the Asia Pacific region. Why are we there? Because if we were not there, who would fill the vacuum? If we were to pull our forces out tomorrow, who would move in the Asia Pacific region? Would it be China, Japan, India, Pakistan? Who would move to fill the vacuum and what would that mean towards stability in that part of the world? The same applies for Europe, where we have 100,000, the Gulf, 23,000. Yes, that puts a strain and burden upon our country, but we are a super power and we have to continue to always examine what does that mean, what are the benefits, what are the burdens? Are we prepared to assume those benefits and burdens? If we look at the history of what we have done during the past fifty years, you say we are the leader for freedom. Every other country looks to us as the model, the Statue of Liberty holding up that flame saying this is the country whose ideals we want to emulate. If you look across the globe, you will find that freedom is in the ascendancy. Every country, be it Europe or Central Asia, they are looking to the United States, saying we are wanting to embrace free market ideas. We know through a free market we are able to prosper in a way that we could never do under the old Soviet concept of a centralized economy. Yes, it is costly, it is burdensome. Can we do better? You bet. Can we improve in the future? We need to. But I hope that during the course of this year and next year, whoever is in office, that we always maintain that commitment to serve the men and women who are serving us, and you play a vital role in that. You who have served and you who have served as the models for them, you are the ones who help carry the torch on behalf of the United States. I want to thank you for all of them. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my job as Secretary of Defense not only to talk about current threats to our security, and there are a number. I mentioned Saddam Hussein and I mentioned Milosevic. There may be others I can talk about today. What we are looking at is what I call a summer power paradox. Mainly, there is no other country that can challenge us directly. There is no other country that has the capabilities that we do, be it ground forces, be it warships, be it our aircraft. No other country can challenge us directly. They look for indirect ways to challenge us, asymmetrical types of conflicts. That comes in the form of either chemical, biological or even cyber. Those are the kinds of threats we are seeing emerging today and we will have to face tomorrow. To give you an example, there are probably at least two dozen countries or more that are seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction, and have the means to deliver them. So what we have to do is to intensify our anti-proliferation types of measures to cut down on the technology that so many of either our friends or allies or adversaries are helping to spread around the world. That is a big challenge. Then to deter those weapons of mass destruction from ever being used against our troops or against our population. So chemical, biological, we have to be concerned about that. We have to be concerned about terrorists, those who are being supported by people like Osama Bin Laden, and we know that threat is out there. We saw the bombing of our embassy just a year or so ago in East Africa. We know that the same groups are seeking to develop and acquire chemical and biological weapons. We know that a group in Tokyo, a few years ago, released sarin gas in a subway. We know that same group was trying to release a chemical weapon as well against American forces. We know that Osama Bin Laden is trying to acquire weapons for mass destruction. We know the bombing of our Trade Center a couple of years ago, they were also experimenting with chemical weapons. All of that is out there and we have to be prepared to fight against that. We know that cells are now being formed by other countries, professionals dedicated to finding ways to interrupt our infrastructure. If you could shut down our financial system, if you could shut down our transportation system, if you could cause the collapse of our energy production and distribution systems just by typing on a computer and causing those means, those links to this globalization to break down, then you are able to wage successful warfare. We have to be able to defend against that. We are taking these measures. This morning is not the time for me to go through on a case-by-case demonstration of all that we are doing. Let me just talk about a couple. We are concerned that, yes, some country will seek to release a chemical or a biological agent on American soil sometime in the future; that a poet some time ago said just imagine a man clutching a little case, walks out briskly to infect a city whose terrible future has just arrived. We are anticipating that kind of terror. We are preparing our citizens by going out to 120 different cities, preparing those who will be required to respond to a chemical or biological attack. We are doing all of those things in anticipation of the kinds of threats that we are likely to face in the future. So, I want you to know that we are not only holding onto the present conflicts to look at what we have to defend against today, but prepare ourselves for the kind of conflicts that we are likely to face in the future. I want you to know once again that our men and women in uniform are performing magnificently. They are doing everything and more that we are asking from them. I wanted to be here today to say that to all of you. The sword of technology is Toffler. He reminded us more than 25 years ago, he talked about future of shock, that we are going to have the winds of change sweep across our country, our culture, our ideals. And we have seen that take place. He said that technology has the potential to benefit all of mankind, and we know that. Today technology is empowering the average citizen in ways that none of us contemplated just ten, twenty or twenty-five years ago. But this technology has two edges to this sword. The hand that wields it, as Toffler pointed out, can sever with the wrist that is holding it. It is a double-edge sword. We have to be very, very concerned about how we are empowering our citizens, our businessmen and women, our consumers. We also have to be concerned about it not being turned and used against us. So we are preparing for that eventuality as well by devoting vast resources to developing the capability of protecting our infrastructure, protecting our citizens and protecting our soldiers. I feel like I am a former Senator just warming up. As you know, Senators have the capacity to speak at length. I have put away my senatorial robe as such and assumed that as a chief executive for the Pentagon. I want to conclude this morning by just again telling you how very proud I am to be in this position. I never imagined I would be here. I never thought that anyone would call me and ask me to serve in this capacity, and I will tell you once again my wife and I have never, ever had the opportunity to be around people who are so devoted to duty, so dedicated to their country, so patriotic, so hard-working, so gifted as we have in the military today; and we are terribly, terribly proud. We have been blessed to have had this opportunity. We also had the opportunity just a couple of months ago to attend the opening of the D-Day Museum in New Orleans and Steven Ambrose had orchestrated that. He also had Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and others who arrived to participate in this great opening. I don't know how many of you have read the book by Steven Ambrose, his many, many books, but the one always that stayed with us is ``The Citizen Soldier.'' In the end of that book, ``The Citizen Soldier'', he talks about the greatest generation and which Tom Brokaw was also there to participate in that. When he talks about the greatest generation in ``The Citizen Soldier'', he said at the very conclusion, ``How was it? How was it possible for this country of ours so diverse, and at that time disorganized in terms of its military might, take on this mechanized evil that was going across the entire country of Europe? How were we able to defeat that enemy?'' He said it all came down to the citizen soldier. He said the citizen soldier who knew the difference between right and wrong, and he was unwilling to live in a world in which wrong triumphed. So, he fought and we prevailed, and all of us are the grateful beneficiaries of their sacrifice. Ladies and gentlemen, many of you in this audience were a part of that greatest generation. You have been part of generations that have followed. You have held up the torch of liberty and freedom and all of us here are the external beneficiaries of what you have done. God bless you. (Applause) COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for taking time out of your busy schedule to be here with us this morning. I can assure you, Mr. Secretary, that the Veterans of Foreign Wars will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you to do whatever it takes to give our young men and women the very best it needs to care for them and their families while they are in harm's way. Thank you again, Mr. Secretary. INTRODUCTION OF MISS AMERICA 2000 - HEATHER FRENCH COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SMART: One of the most enjoyable aspects of the past year for me has been to meet this next young lady. In one short year, she has become the favorite little sister to every veteran in America. Miss America 2000, Heather French, is the daughter of a disabled Vietnam veteran. She has chosen to direct the spotlight of her title toward awareness, funding and volunteerism for homeless veterans' programs. For the past year, she has traveled more than 20,000 miles a month, sharing her passion for America's homeless veterans' programs. The VFW is proud to have been a part of that effort. Together, Heather and the VFW have brought much-needed attention to homeless veterans' efforts in Little Rock, Boston, Tacoma and Kansas City. Following this convention, we will continue that effort to ensure that America is aware of its homeless veterans and how we can help. I am certain that no other single individual has done more to bring attention to the plight of homeless veterans than Heather French. For that reason, I am honoring her this morning with the VFW Gold Medal of Merit and Citation for her support of homeless veterans. My comrades, sisters and friends, please welcome the lady who will be the veterans' Miss America forever, Miss America 2000, Heather French. ...Whereupon, the assembly extended a prolonged standing ovation. ... ADJUTANT GENERAL SENK: The Gold Medal of Merit and this citation awarded to Heather French, Miss America 2000. ``In sincere appreciation for her commitment as an advocate for our nation's homeless veterans by creating an unprecedented awareness of the struggles and pains facing these proud defenders of America's freedom. Her tireless efforts to bring aid and comfort to all veterans and her willingness to share her spotlight with these forgotten heroes earns her the love and admiration of the members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and adds a gleaming jewel of patriotism and compassion to her crown of Miss America. ``In Witness Whereof, we have hereunto set our hands and the official seal of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, this 21st day of August, 2000.'' This has been signed by John W. Smart, Commander-in-Chief, and John J. Senk, Jr., Adjutant General. RESPONSE - MISS AMERICA - HEATHER FRENCH MS. HEATHER FRENCH: Thank you so much. It is such an honor to be recognized by family. I don't say just friends, but I say family, because you welcomed me into not just your arms but into your hearts. In Los Angeles, as the gentleman that introduced me said she may be Miss America, former Miss Kentucky, but Heather French is a veterans' daughter. That placed upon me the most precious title that I have ever received, even above being Miss America, because it made me responsible, it made me accountable for your lives. It made me responsible to teach a nation how to care for you and your family and for future generations so that we can pass on a legacy of respect to our children. I dare say that above and beyond the threats internationally as the Secretary has so eloquently put it, we have one on our own soil that is a threat, and that is of the spiritual. That is of hopelessness amongst some of your brothers and sisters. That is a threat that we cannot afford in our American nation. We cannot afford broken spirits. I have spent this past year, and there are so many wonderful memories to reflect on. I have seen the spirit of your Madam President, Lorraine, who has been such a role model for a wonderful drive to teach your ladies how to rise above. And the National Commander, what can I say? Every time I am around I have grown to love him as your Madam President has as ``Mr. Wonderful.'' He always has a smile on his face. Secretary and Mrs. Cohen, what role models you have been for not just caring about the umbrella that protects us all, but caring individually about our veterans and our soldiers. It is because of you that they are proud to be American veterans and proud to be American soldiers. Thank you. I have embarked upon a wonderful mission this year. On September 18th, although, yes, I was proud to be named Kentucky's first Miss America, I was proud to be named your Miss America. That must be the Kentucky crowd in the back. On September 18th, when I took on that crown and that title, I began a mission that started when I was four years old. You see, as a young person I was so fortunate to know the price of freedom. At four years old, my father took me into my first VA hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio. Where is my Ohio crowd? (Applause) And it was there that I learned the greatest lesson, and that was where your issues are concerned, where you are concerned and your family, it is better to listen not just with ears. Anyone can do that. But we need to listen with the heart. We need to know that 25 million American veterans are more than just a statistic, that you are individuals; unique stories, unique experiences. I got a chance to learn about other families who are struggling like my family was because of my father's disabilities and his struggles. I got a chance to see children who were asking the same question I was, and that was why is this happening to my dad? Why is this happening to my mother, my aunt, my uncle, my brother, and my sister?
