We here at Madame Noire were surprised by many of these unions. Are you?\n\nPersia White and Saul Williams\n\nPersia White and famous poet and slam artist Saul Williams met when he made a guest appearance on Girlfriends as Lynn’s love interest “Sivad.” The artsy couple hit it off immediately and eventually married in 2008 after five years of dating. Unfortunately, the artsy couple called it quits just a year later."
