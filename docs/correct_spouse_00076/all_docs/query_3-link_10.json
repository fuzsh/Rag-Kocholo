The time runs from Eli appointment as Tabernacle priest until the Ark was moved to Jerusalem in Y38 of David. David’s Y30 was 435.9Y after Exodus & 1052.6Y before Jesus Baptism by John. Only the year of a key event is given in this table. Also, Samuel-1&2 does not specify time of some events. The ‘sequence-tie- object’ is the 20 years Moses Ark stayed at Kirjath-Jearim in the house of Abinadab. There were 20 years from its return, after capture in Eli 98 year, until moved by King David, in his 38 year, to city Jerusalem. If A denotes the Ark years, then 18+A will be the years of David, B. Esh-baal, (aka: Eshbaal, Ishbosheth, Ishui, denoted by C) was Saul’s last living son. He was 40 years old when David became King at age 30. So C=10+B = 28+A. Next an age of Saul, 20Y, is assumed for the birth year of Eshbaal. This could also have been 25 or 30. This only affects the age of Saul at various events. Within reason, these ages are unspecified by scripture. So Saul’s age, D=20+C=48+A. The age of Eli, called F, is specified as 98. This was when the Ark was captured. Seven months later, the Ark is returned to the house of Abinadab, in Eli’s 98 year. So F=98+A. No attempt is made to work in partial years. Lastly, find age of Samuel in terms of Eli years. Here guidance is given by two facts. A priest’s allowed years of service is set by Moses Law to be not less than 30 and not more than 50. Samuel mother Hannah came to the Tabernacle in Eli time as she prayed to God for a son. She vowed he would be given in service to God. Next see that when the child was weaned she presented Samuel to Eli at the Tabernacle. The conception year of Samuel is taken to be Eli 34Y. Five years of age in Hebrew tradition is the age of weaning by which time Eli was 40. Variable E, Samuel’s age, is F-35 = 98+A-35 or 63+A. Considerations on the Results The years of any event for any listed single age can be found by adjusting the single variable, A, ark years from capture return, until the specified event age is achieved. Saul died when Esh-baal was 40; this is at age 60 or ark year 12. Samuel died 2 years prior at age 73. As Sam entered priestly service at age 30, then yes 43 years of service was a goodly term of service and he was ‘old and full of years. Saul became king about 2 years after Eli died. This was in Samuel 63 year and Saul 50th . This same year, a young David is 20 and kills Goliath. By Moses law youths could enter military service from 20Y upwards. So David’s service conforms to Moses requirement, as expected. Neither the age of Saul nor Samuel is given when Saul is appointed king. One or 2Y after Eli death is reasonable. Thus Sam’s age at that time is 64 or 65 years. As said Samuel, he was old. Anything over 50 in the priest system would be ‘old’. By this table, Saul’s time, as king, was only 11-9 years. During that time he fought 6 or 7 wars. During most that time, David lived on the land as a fugitive. Thus the translation of Acts 13:21-22 must be either that the time of Saul and Samuel were about 40 years or that the 40 refers to the years of David reign as King of Israel. v21: ...the Saul son Kis out of tribe Benjamin. v22: Years forty, and deposing him; He lifted to them the David into king to whom also he witnesses... (From Greek interlinear and Strong's Greek words & my punctuation and verse#) Some incorrectly argue the ark was moved during Saul’s days. A close reading of 1Sam14:3,18-19 shows Saul asked moving the ark but midsentence withdrew the order. Nowhere in the days of Saul is it stated the ark moved. This concur 1Chr13:3 ... Bring again the ark… for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul. Also it specified where the ark stayed since return from capture. That was the very same place David fetched Moses Ark unto Jerusalem. Please download the PDF, if interested in reading more on this topic.
