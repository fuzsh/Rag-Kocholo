The characters are listed in the order they were first credited in the series.\n\nMain article: Carrie Mathison\n\nPlayed by Claire Danes, Carrie Mathison is a CIA officer who grapples with bipolar disorder. While deployed in Iraq, Carrie receives information leading her to suspect rescued American POW Nicholas Brody of being a terrorist. During a lengthy unauthorized investigation into Brody, she becomes obsessed with him, and the two even have a brief romantic relationship. Her suspicions ultimately being correct, she loses her job when her investigation is exposed by Brody. Carrie successfully stops Brody's suicide bombing attempt but is unaware she was successful and is instead made to believe that Brody was innocent. Now completely demoralized, she submits herself to electroconvulsive therapy as she is no longer confident in her skills.\n\nWhen Brody's confession video is discovered, Carrie is brought back into the CIA. She successfully interrogates Brody, getting him to admit his complicity and to agree to work against al-Qaeda rather than be exposed to the world as treasonous. Carrie acts as Brody's handler and their romance is eventually rekindled. She is kidnapped by Abu Nazir on American soil but is instrumental in his subsequent capture and killing by FBI forces. When Brody is framed by al-Qaeda as the perpetrator of the Langley bombing on 12/12, Carrie helps Brody flee the country and promises to clear his name.\n\nAfter learning that the Iranians were responsible for the bombing, Carrie and Saul hatch an elaborate plan to draw out IRGC Deputy Chief Majid Javadi, publicly staging the CIA's apparent disavowal of Carrie in order to convince the Iranians she can be turned. As part of the ruse, Carrie is placed in a psych ward, which takes a mental and emotional toll on her despite the false pretenses of her stay. The plan is ultimately a success when Javadi comes to the U.S. and is turned into the CIA's asset in Iran. Saul brings Brody back to the U.S. so that he can enact the second stage of the plan: assassinate the IRGC chief in Tehran so that he can be replaced with Javadi. Carrie convinces Brody to take up the mission, and helps him escape to a safehouse after he completes the plan. While waiting to be extracted, Carrie reveals to Brody she is pregnant with his child. Brody is ultimately captured and executed by the Iranian authorities, and Carrie attends his public hanging.\n\nMonths later, Carrie is the CIA's station chief in Kabul, and has left her daughter Frannie with her sister Maggie, reluctant to be a mother. As station chief, she earns the nickname \"The Drone Queen\" for overseeing numerous airstrikes. Carrie transfers over to the Islamabad station after its previous chief is killed, and leads the hunt for Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani. After Haqqani storms the U.S. embassy and takes control of the region, Carrie returns home to arrange her father's funeral, and reunites with her estranged mother. She quits the CIA after learning that Saul agreed to Dar Adal's covert deal with Haqqani in hopes of becoming CIA director.\n\nTwo years later, Carrie lives in Berlin, working as a security consultant for the During Foundation and staying with her daughter Frannie as well as her coworker and boyfriend Jonas. After evading an assassination attempt, Carrie goes into hiding and discovers that the Russians have infiltrated the CIA's Berlin station. She is forced to divert her attention from the plot in order to rescue Peter Quinn from a jihadist compound where he was subjected to a sarin gas attack. She and Saul wake Quinn from his coma in an attempt to learn the jihadists' plot, but it is unsuccessful and results in Quinn suffering a major stroke. Carrie ultimately stops the terrorist attack, but declines to rejoin the CIA.\n\nMonths later, Carrie moves to New York, where she works at a nonprofit providing legal aid to Muslim Americans, while covertly acting as President-elect Elizabeth Keane's foreign policy advisor. She also takes care of a recovering Quinn, feeling immense guilt over her role in causing his stroke. Carrie loses custody of Frannie after child services deem Carrie an imminent risk to her daughter. She learns that it was engineered by Dar Adal, whose black ops group is discovered by Quinn to be brewing a plot against the President-elect. Quinn dies saving Carrie and Keane from an assassination attempt. Weeks later, Carrie regains custody of her daughter and works as an intelligence advisor to the White House, but is abruptly fired amidst President Keane's mass roundup of federal employees in retaliation to the assassination attempt.\n\nOver the next three months, Carrie begins seeking justice against the President, but soon learns with Saul's help that the Russians are engineering an elaborate attempt to undermine the White House. After Carrie repeatedly endangers Frannie during her investigation, she agrees to give up custody of her daughter to Maggie. She and Saul then travel to Russia to exfiltrate a key witness back to the U.S. Carrie lures Russian authorities led by Yevgeny Gromov away from Saul's team, resulting in her capture and imprisonment. Seven months later, Saul negotiates her release. Carrie emerges in severe delirium, having been denied her medication during her captivity.\n\nCarrie recovers from her captivity at a hospital in Germany, unable to remember most of the time she spent in Russia. Saul soon calls her back to Kabul to help negotiate a peace agreement that would end the war in Afghanistan. The plan nearly succeeds until the American and Afghan presidents die in a helicopter crash. With tensions between U.S. and Pakistani governments nearly escalating to a war, Carrie works with Yevgeny to recover the helicopter's flight recorder. Upon finding it, the two learn that the helicopter crashed due to a mechanical failure, which if publicized would avert the impending war. However, Yevgeny confiscates the recorder and agrees to exchange it for the identity of Saul's deeply embedded asset inside the Kremlin. Carrie identifies the asset, successfully preventing a war, though Carrie is forced to escape to Russia with Yevgeny. Two years later, Carrie lives with Yevgeny in Moscow, having defected, while secretly operating as Saul's new Russian asset.\n\nMain article: Nicholas Brody\n\nPlayed by Damian Lewis, Nicholas Brody is the husband of Jessica Brody and father to Dana and Chris. He is an ex-Marine who was captured by al-Qaeda and held as a POW for eight years in Iraq. Brody, after years of brutal treatment, becomes sympathetic to Abu Nazir's cause during his captivity and agrees to return to the United States as a sleeper agent. Once back in the U.S., Brody has a turbulent relationship with his family, partly due to Jessica's having had an affair with Brody's best friend Mike. Brody has an affair of his own with Carrie Mathison, the CIA officer who suspects him of working for al-Qaeda. According to plan, Brody successfully gets himself into a bunker with the Vice President while wearing a suicide vest, intending to detonate it, but he aborts when Dana calls him, begging him to come home. He leaves the scene with nobody being the wiser.\n\nBrody takes advantage of his public popularity, and support from Vice President Walden, to win a seat in the United States House of Representatives. He continues to secretly work for Abu Nazir until he is discovered by the CIA. Carrie, using her emotional connection with Brody, is able to convince him to turn against al-Qaeda. Using Brody's inside information, a major al-Qaeda terrorist attack is thwarted by the CIA. However, Brody is made to look like the perpetrator of a second bombing at CIA Headquarters on 12/12, making him the most wanted man in America. Carrie helps him escape and go into hiding in Canada while promising to clear his name.\n\nMonths later, an injured Brody resurfaces in Caracas, where a group of mercenaries with CIA connections tend to his wounds and keep him addicted to heroin in a slum that grew out of an abandoned skyscraper. Saul arrives weeks later with $10 million in cash for Brody's release, finding him in a catatonic state. After Brody recovers from his withdrawal symptoms, Saul and Carrie convince him to lead an operation in Tehran to assassinate IRGC chief Danesh Akbari, so that he can be replaced with Deputy Chief Majid Javadi (who Saul has turned into a CIA asset). Before Brody departs, Carrie allows him a last farewell with Dana, who rebuffs him and asks to never see him again. In Tehran, Brody successfully assassinates Akbari; Carrie helps him escape to a CIA safehouse and reveals that she is pregnant with his child. Brody is soon arrested by Iranian authorities, who sentence him to death by public hanging. Carrie attends Brody's execution despite his pleas that she not be there.\n\nPlayed by Mandy Patinkin, Saul Berenson is a veteran intelligence officer at the CIA, initially introduced as the agency's Middle East Division Chief. Saul recruited a young Carrie Mathison into the CIA, and is a close friend and mentor to her. His measured approach to his job often clashes with Carrie's drastic, impulsive methods. Saul is doggedly committed to his job, often at the expense of his personal life: he has a wife, Mira, who resents his absence at home (which ultimately results in their divorce), and a sister, Dorit, who lives in the West Bank and has not seen him in years.\n\nCarrie told Saul about the intel Hasan Ibrahim supplied regarding a turned American POW and requested permission to place surveillance on Sgt. Nick Brody, a POW who was recently rescued after long captivity. Saul denied the request, suggesting that her idea that Abu Nazir tipped off the military to the location where Brody was found was fanciful, and would need real evidence to justify action against Brody. He did however place her in Brody's debriefing on the condition that she behave herself (which she didn't). Saul defends her against her boss, David Estes, who complained about her behavior in the debriefing, however he was warned not to let things get personal with Carrie. Saul discovered Carrie's illegal surveillance of Brody and became angry with her when she later to seduce Brody. Saul does feel that Carrie justified herself when she found a rhythmic pattern in the way Brody tapped his fingers during televised appearances.\n\nSaul is instrumental in getting cooperation from captured terrorist Aileen Morgan, which leads to information that implicates Tom Walker. When she also wonders aloud why Brody betrayed her by turning her in, leading Saul to realize that Carrie really loves Brody. Saul later runs afoul of CIA Director Estes when he discovers that Estes and then-CIA director William Walden ordered a drone strike that hit a school in Iraq and have been taking measures to cover up the incident. After an operation with Carrie in Beirut, Saul finds a copy of the confession tape that Brody recorded. This leads to Saul, Carrie, and Estes forming a task force attempting to use Brody as a re-doubled agent against al-Qaeda. Saul discovers that Estes' plan is to have Brody killed once the operation is finished and tries to put a stop to it which leads to further friction with Estes, almost losing his job. However, Peter Quinn, the black ops operative hired by Estes to kill Brody, decides not to go through with the plan once Abu Nazir is killed. When Estes is killed at the bombing of the memorial service for William Walden at Langley on December 12, Saul becomes the acting director of the CIA.\n\nOnce he is director, Saul and Carrie almost immediately put into action a plan to lure out the mastermind behind the 12/12 attacks, in which Carrie is outed to the press as having bipolar disorder and having had an affair with Brody. Appearing vulnerable, Carrie is contacted by representatives of an international bank with ties to the middle east, as Saul predicted, who ask her to inform on CIA operations to their client, Majid Javadi, Iran's deputy intelligence Chief and the orchestrator of the 12/12 attack with whom Saul has a troubled history. When they were both getting their starts in their respective nations, Saul and Javadi worked together during the Iranian hostage crisis, but Javadi betrayed Saul by having several hostages who Saul was going to extradite back to the states killed. In response, Saul helped Javadi's wife and son escape to America. Saul, with the help of Fara Sherazi, finds that Javadi embezzled millions from his own nation to fund the attack, making him an enemy of the Iranian state should this ever be revealed. Using this as leverage to make Javadi a CIA asset, Saul sends Javadi back to Iran. At the same time, Saul clashes with Senator Andrew Lockhart, who is soon to replace him as director, and he discovers that his wife is having an affair with a man named Alain Bernard.\n\nSaul manages to bring Brody, now a heroin addict after his captivity in Caracas, back to the United States to help carry out the second phase of his plans for the Middle East. Saul intends to send Brody to Iran under the guise of seeking political asylum so that he can kill Danesh Akbari, leader of the Revolutionary Guard, who will then be replaced by Javadi - ushering in a regime change in the nation. A special ops unit works to rehabilitate and retrain Brody back to peak condition. Meanwhile, Saul finds that Alain is an Israeli intelligence agent hired by Lockhart to spy on him, and uses this info to give himself more time in office to see through the mission to the plan. Brody manages to make it into Tehran, where he eventually succeeds in killing Akbari. Carrie implores Saul to get Brody extracted; Saul agrees, but Lockhart and Dar Adal overstep him and leak Brody's location to Iranian authorities, who apprehend and execute Brody. Despite this, Saul's plan is a success, with Iran agreeing to disarm its nuclear sites four months later. Saul is fired from the CIA once Lockhart takes office, and then begins work in the private sector.\n\nSaul travels to the U.S. embassy in Islamabad where Carrie has since been posted as station chief, and reconnects with U.S. ambassador Martha Boyd, an old friend and former romantic partner. On his way back, Saul is kidnapped and brought to Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani, who uses him as a human shield to travel freely through Pakistan without fear of a drone strike. Haqqani holds Saul captive as a bargaining chip to get several Taliban prisoners released in an exchange. Some time after the Taliban's assault on the U.S. embassy, Saul learns from Dar Adal that Haqqani agreed not to harbor terrorists in Afghanistan in exchange for being removed from the CIA's kill list. Dar also informs Saul that video evidence of his capture by the Taliban will not be publicized, preserving Saul's chances of becoming CIA director. Saul agrees to this deal, deeply disappointing Carrie when eventually finds out. Carrie subsequently helps derail Saul's bid for the directorship, forming a rift between them that lasts over two years.\n\nTwo years later, Saul is called to Berlin to attend to a scandal involving leaked documents attesting to widespread privacy violations by the American and German governments as part of a counterterrorism probe. Saul formally agrees to end the program but continues it independently, enlisting Peter Quinn to assassinate known targets. In the two-year interim, Mira filed for divorce from Saul after he rejoined the CIA, and Saul began a sexual relationship with Berlin station chief Allison Carr. Carrie later finds out that Allison is a longtime mole for the Russians and is using Saul as a patsy to obtain classified intelligence. Carrie and Saul team up with German intelligence to thwart the Russians' operation; though Allison escapes, Saul makes a deal with Ivan Krupin, her handler, for details about her extraction plan, and leads a team to intercept and assassinate Allison at the German border.\n\nMonths later, Saul and Dar Adal advise President-elect Elizabeth Keane in New York during her transition into office. Dar, distrustful of Keane's antiwar platform and anticipated overhauls of the intelligence community, plots behind Saul's back to undermine the Keane administration. Saul investigates Iran's possible violations of their nuclear treaty (based on a false lead planted by Dar), visiting his sister Dorit in the West Bank as cover to secretly meet with Majid Javadi. Saul has Javadi confirm whether Iran is running a parallel nuclear program; Javadi eventually comes to the U.S. himself, seeking political asylum after he is outed as a CIA asset in Iran, and confirms to Saul that Iran is complying with the nuclear pact. However, Javadi reverses course, telling the opposite to Keane after making a deal with Dar Adal. Saul and Carrie prove to Keane that Dar is conspiring against her. After a faction within Dar's group attempts to assassinate Keane, she retaliates during the first month of her presidency by arresting over 200 federal employees including Saul.\n\nSome months later, Keane agrees to release her 200 political prisoners including Saul, who accepts the position of National Security Advisor. Saul is first placed in charge of the manhunt for provocateur Brett O'Keefe, and unsuccessfully attempts to deescalate a standoff between the FBI and O'Keefe's supporters (which ultimately ends in a deadly shootout). Saul finds evidence that the situation escalated due to disinformation deployed by the Russians, and enlists a task force to uncover a widespread Russian conspiracy to undermine President Keane's administration. He and Carrie work to exfiltrate a key witness in the case from Russia so that she can testify about the conspiracy before Congress. Carrie allows herself to be captured by the GRU in order to ensure the operation's success, and Saul is forced to leave her behind. Seven months later, Saul negotiates Carrie's release in a prisoner exchange and finds her in severe delirium due to her being denied medication for her bipolar disorder while in captivity.\n\nAfter Keane resigns, Saul stays on as National Security Advisor for Ralph Warner, who inherits the office after serving as vice president to Keane. Over a period of months, Saul oversees a diplomatic effort to end the war in Afghanistan. He visits a recovering Carrie in Germany and enlists her to help negotiate the peace agreement in Kabul. A major breakthrough occurs when Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani is himself discovered to be interested in ending the war. Saul meets with Haqqani to finalize a peace agreement, but negotiations collapse when a helicopter carrying President Warner and Afghan President Daoud crashes near a military outpost where the end of the war was just announced. Saul finds his advice falling on deaf ears in the White House after the brash and inexperienced Vice President Benjamin Hayes takes over the presidency. When tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan nearly culminate in a war, Saul and Carrie work to obtain the helicopter's flight recorder, which proves that the crash occurred due to mechanical failure, but is in the hands of the Russians. Carrie makes a deal with the GRU, agreeing to give up the identity of Saul's deeply embedded asset inside the Kremlin in exchange for the recorder. When Saul refuses to name his asset, Carrie independently identifies the individual as Anna Pomerantseva, the GRU's head interpreter who volunteered to defect for Saul in 1986 while in East Berlin. The effort ultimately succeeds in preventing a war between the U.S. and Pakistan, at the cost of Anna committing suicide to avoid capture by Russian authorities. Two years later, Carrie, having defected to Moscow, becomes Saul's new mole inside the Kremlin.\n\nPlayed by Morena Baccarin, Jessica Brody is the wife of Nicholas Brody and mother of Dana and Chris. In the eight years her husband is gone and presumed dead, Jessica does not remarry but does engage in a serious relationship with Brody's best friend Mike Faber, which is abruptly ended when Brody returns home. The reunited couple struggle with their marriage. He resents Jessica's relationship with Mike. Jessica, in turn, learns of Brody's affair with Carrie. As his behavior becomes increasingly bizarre, Jessica suspects further infidelity. When Brody is off on a CIA-sanctioned mission, Jessica and Mike's relationship is rekindled. Nicholas and Jessica eventually come to a mutual agreement that their marriage cannot continue.\n\nPlayed by David Harewood, David Estes is the director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. He has a tense relationship with Carrie, partly due to a past affair with her which led to the end of Estes' marriage. He fires Carrie upon learning of her bipolar disorder and her multiple contraventions of CIA protocols, but later on, he must reinstate her when she is proven to have been right about Brody. Saul discovers that Estes and then-CIA-director Walden ordered a drone strike launched in Abu Nazir's homeland, resulting in the destruction of a nearby school and that his efforts to undermine Carrie were actually an attempt to cover up the incident. Estes makes plans to have Brody assassinated once Abu Nazir is neutralized, and when Saul opposes this action, he threatens Saul's job. He is among those killed when a bomb explodes at the CIA building.\n\nPlayed by Diego Klattenhoff, Mike Faber is Nick Brody's best friend, having served with him in the Marines. While Brody is presumed to be dead as a prisoner-of-war, Mike gets involved in a long-term relationship with Nick's wife Jessica and becomes very attached to her and the Brody family. The relationship is abruptly ended when Brody returns. The Brody family still comes to depend on Mike when they are neglected by Nicholas. Mike and a fellow Marine, Lauder Wakefield, feel that Brody may have had something to do with the murder of Tom Walker and investigate the matter. Saul and Estes talk him down from investigating further, but he eventually confronts Jessica with his theories. Mike and Jessica rekindle their affair while staying under CIA protection. Brody eventually gives Mike his blessing to look after his family after separating from Jessica. Mike and Jessica are seemingly vindicated in their suspicions about Brody when he is publicly framed for the bombing of the CIA's Langley headquarters. In the aftermath, Mike continues to assist Jessica amid the public scrutiny her family faces.\n\nPlayed by Jackson Pace, Chris Brody is the son of Nicholas and Jessica and younger brother to Dana. Chris is too young to remember Nicholas before he went into service, and struggles to connect with his returned father at times. When his father's behavior becomes more erratic, Chris finds comfort in the familiar presence of Mike Faber.\n\nPlayed by Morgan Saylor, Dana Brody is the daughter of Nicholas and Jessica and older sister to Chris. Intelligent and strong-minded, Dana is the member of the family with whom Brody feels most comfortable after his return home. She is the only one to whom Brody freely admits his conversion to the Muslim faith. Dana exhibits some resentment towards her mother for having had an affair with Mike. When Brody is about to detonate his suicide vest at the State Department, Carrie convinces Dana to call him and \"talk him down\", which convinces Brody to not go through with the attack, though Dana is left not having any clue what Brody was planning to do.\n\nWhile she is on a date with her boyfriend Finn Walden, Finn is driving recklessly, fatally strikes a pedestrian, then drives away. Dana is overcome with guilt. Her relationship with her father deteriorates when she wants to report the accident to the police, but her father doesn't allow it (his hand is forced by the CIA), much to her disillusionment. When she watches the news showing that her father was turned in Afghanistan, Dana attempts suicide and is eventually placed in a psychiatric hospital, where she meets Leo Carras. The two begin a relationship and eventually run off together until Dana learns that Leo was possibly involved in the death of his own brother, which Leo told her was a suicide. After this, Dana changes her last name to disassociate herself from her father and moves out of the house. Psychologically ruined and disillusioned, she ends up cleaning motel rooms, seeing Brody one final time before he goes to Iran. Her father tries to reconnect with her, but Dana rejects him and claims to never want to see him again.\n\nPlayed by Jamey Sheridan, William Walden is the Vice President of the United States and a former director of the CIA. Both Brody and Abu Nazir hold him accountable for the drone strike that killed Nazir's son Issa. Walden capitalizes on Brody's political value following his return from captivity, offering him a seat in the House of Representatives in a special election. Not long after Brody is elected to Congress, Walden launches his own presidential bid and asks Brody to be his running mate. Walden is killed during a meeting with Brody when Nazir's associates tamper with his pacemaker. Brody agrees to provide the pacemaker's serial number for Nazir in exchange for releasing Carrie as his hostage. In Walden's dying moments, Brody finally disavows him in person and refuses to save him. Walden attended the University of Notre Dame and was an All-American football player there.\n\nPlayed by David Marciano, Virgil Piotrowski is a freelance surveillance expert and former CIA employee. He is one of Carrie's few friends. Carrie often enlists him to help her with surveillance operations, including that of Nicholas Brody's household. He frequently runs operations alongside his younger brother Max, also a freelancer with relatively less field experience but formidable technical skill.\n\nPlayed by Navid Negahban, Abu Nazir is a high-ranking operative, possibly the operational leader, of al-Qaeda. Nazir oversees the captivity of prisoners of war Nicholas Brody and Tom Walker, and over a period of years is able to groom them both to turn on the U.S. and align with al-Qaeda. Issa, Nazir's son, is killed by a CIA-sanctioned drone strike. The incident is pivotal in shifting the allegiance of Brody, and also leads Nazir to swear revenge on the CIA and its director. He sends Brody and Walker back to the U.S. with a plot to kill Vice President Walden and many other officials, but it is thwarted by the efforts of Carrie Mathison.\n\nBrody is captured by the CIA and forced to work with them against al-Qaeda. Nazir then infiltrates the United States himself with a new plan. First, he orchestrates the assassination of Vice President Walden, holding Carrie as a hostage as leverage to force Brody's assistance. He then sacrifices himself (killed by SWAT team), along with his cell (captured by CIA forces), in order to give the appearance that the terror threat has been neutralized. However, Nazir had planted a bomb in Brody's car, and one of his associates detonates the bomb at the CIA's headquarters, killing 219 people and wiping out much of the CIA's infrastructure, and setting up the innocent Brody as the culprit.\n\nPlayed by Rupert Friend, Peter Quinn is a black ops officer working for a shadowy group within the CIA led by Dar Adal. He is an expert assassin who has spent most of his life conducting high-risk missions for the government. He often acts as a voice of reason to Carrie, for whom he develops romantic feelings, and remains drawn to working in the field despite repeatedly expressing his weariness and moral qualms with the work he does. Little is known regarding Quinn's personal background: he was recruited at age 16 by Dar Adal, who raised him to become a skilled operative and acted as a mentor figure to Quinn throughout his life. Quinn additionally had a son with a Philadelphia police officer named Julia Diaz, who knows Quinn only by his alias, \"John.\"\n\nQuinn is originally introduced as a CIA analyst brought in by Estes to head up the Brody task force. He clashes with Carrie as she is not very willing to take orders from him, but they come to respect each other's skills. Quinn is later discovered by Saul to be a black ops officer hired by Estes to assassinate Brody once Abu Nazir is neutralized. He ends up refusing to kill Brody, realizing that carrying out the job would only be advancing Estes' interests, and knowing the effect it would have on Carrie.\n\nQuinn is later assigned to the CIA station in Islamabad, and sees action during the hunt for Saul Berenson after he is kidnapped, as well as Haissam Haqqani's assault on the US embassy – where Quinn's actions save the lives of many Americans. After Haqqani escapes, the US makes the decision to break off ties with Pakistan and the embassy is evacuated; despite orders to evacuate, Quinn remains in Islamabad, and reaches out to Astrid – a German intelligence officer and his former lover – who helps him locate Haqqani. He attempts to assassinate Haqqani using a pipe bomb, but Carrie gets him to stand down to avoid him from killing civilians. Shortly thereafter, Quinn returns to the U.S. and reunites with Carrie at her father's funeral. The night of the wake, Quinn and Carrie kiss, and he proposes that the two of them leave the CIA together. Carrie, afraid of destroying another relationship, decides to confront her estranged mother, who reassures her that her bipolar disorder does not stop her from finding love in her life. By the time Carrie attempts call Quinn, however, he has already accepted a high-risk mission in Syria with Dar Adal's group, believing that Carrie turned him down. Quinn spends the next two years running special ops missions in Syria.\n\nIn Berlin, Quinn is initially assigned to investigate a leak of classified documents dealing with cooperation between the CIA and German intelligence. Saul later recruits him for an off-the-books operation to target ISIS terrorists in Berlin, an operation that is complicated when Carrie's name ends up on his list. Quinn helps Carrie fake her death and rescues her from an ambush by assailants that turn out to be Russian intelligence officers. He later infiltrates an ISIS cell and discovers their plan to launch a chemical attack on Berlin. He attempts to convince them to stop the attack, but the ISIS recruits decide to use him as the test subject for their sarin gas chamber. One of the recruits, Qasim, gets qualms about the operation and injects Quinn with an antidote. Carrie and Saul ask doctors to revive Quinn to query him for information on the impending terrorist attack, but Quinn is unresponsive and goes into respiratory arrest. Quinn is later hospitalized and suffers a massive brain hemorrhage, leaving little chance for survival. Carrie regularly visits Quinn, and receives a heartfelt letter he wrote for her.\n\nHaving returned to the US, Quinn is treated for PTSD at a hospital in Brooklyn, and suffers severe impairments to his speech, memory and motor capabilities as a result of his stroke. Carrie eventually moves Quinn into the ground floor of her apartment. While staying with Carrie, Quinn grows attached to Carrie's young daughter, Frannie, and cares for her while Carrie is away. Quinn soon becomes convinced that a man living across the street from Carrie is spying on her, which leads to him uncovering a vast conspiracy by Dar Adal's group to discredit (and later assassinate) President-elect Elizabeth Keane. Quinn ultimately sacrifices himself to save Carrie and Keane, driving through a barricade of armed soldiers sent to kill the President-elect and dying from his bullet wounds. Weeks later, Carrie cleans out Quinn's belongings from his apartment and finds photos of his estranged son over the years, as well one of herself, which moves her to tears.\n\nPlayed by Sarita Choudhury, Mira Berenson is the wife (later ex-wife) of Saul Berenson. She leaves Saul to move to New Delhi, but she returns to the U.S. after the CIA bombing. She stays at Saul's side throughout his tenure as acting director of the CIA, though she briefly begins a relationship with another man, Alain Bernard, who is later revealed spying on Saul, acting on behalf of Andrew Lockhart. After breaking it off with Alain, she recommits to her marriage to Saul, which continues after his tenure at the CIA ends and he begins work in the private sector. However, after Saul rejoins the CIA, Mira files for divorce. They meet again in New York, as Saul prepares to go into hiding; their conversation causes Saul to reconsider.\n\nPlayed by Tracy Letts, Senator Andrew Lockhart leads the committee investigating the bombing of the CIA. At a hunting retreat led by the White House Chief of Staff, Lockhart is revealed to be the nominee for director of the CIA to replace Saul. Lockhart clashes with Saul while the latter is still director, and hires an Israeli intelligence agent, Alan Bernard, to spy on him, a scheme which Saul uncovers. Lockhart also gives the order to have Brody eliminated after he becomes a liability for the U.S. during his mission in Iran.\n\nAs CIA director, Lockhart oversees the Islamabad crisis during the hunt for Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani, and goes to the Islamabad CIA station himself after Saul is captured by the Taliban. Lockhart unsuccessfully attempts to negotiate with the ISI for Saul's release. Later, when Haqqani and his men storm the U.S. embassy, Lockhart takes refuge with the U.S. ambassador and other officials while safeguarding a package of highly classified CIA intelligence. He is forced to give up the package when Haqqani threatens to kill CIA analyst Fara Sherazi (whom he murders anyway). In the aftermath of the fiasco, Lockhart attends the wake of Carrie's late father at her home, and informs Carrie, Saul and Quinn that he expects to be removed from his post as CIA director.\n\nPlayed by F. Murray Abraham, Dar Adal is a black ops specialist, leading a secretive cabal within the CIA (informally referred to as \"the Group\"). He is an old friend and colleague of Saul, as well as Peter Quinn's handler and longtime mentor, having recruited him to the agency when he was only 16 years old (it is later implied that he sexually groomed the young Quinn). Dar is discreet, calculated and highly pragmatic in his dealings, often overstepping legal and ethical boundaries to ensure what he believes is the best outcome.\n\nDar is introduced as having lent Quinn to Estes to oversee the Brody operation. Saul confronts Dar after learning that Quinn was sent to assassinate Brody in case the CIA's plans went awry. After Saul is named acting CIA director following the 12/12 bombing of the Langley headquarters, he and Dar work together to dismantle the network of Majid Javadi, the Iranian deputy intelligence chief who financed the attack. Saul, Carrie and Quinn secretly conduct an operation to convert Javadi into a CIA asset and send him back to Iran to be replaced as IRGC chief in hopes of regime change; though Dar only learns of the plan after its first stage is complete, he immediately supports Saul (unlike Senator Lockhart, who the two of them overstep to ensure the plan succeeds). Saul sends Brody into Iran to assassinate the existing intelligence chief; though Saul makes a longshot attempt to extract Brody afterwards as a promise to Carrie, Dar and Lockhart sidestep him and allow Brody to be captured and executed by Iranian authorities, knowing it would be operationally and politically more expedient.\n\nAfter Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani invades the U.S. embassy in Islamabad and takes control of most of the region, Dar makes a deal with him, agreeing to remove Haqqani from the CIA's kill list in exchange for Haqqani denying sanctuary to terrorists in Afghanistan. Saul agrees to the deal despite his own near-death at the Taliban's hands in Islamabad after Dar informs him that he has negotiated the erasure of video footage of Saul's captivity under Haqqani, which would preserve Saul's chances of becoming CIA director. Carrie confronts Dar at his home, arguing that Saul would never agree to such a deal, but is dismayed to find Saul already at Dar's house, realizing he is complicit in Dar's political maneuvering.\n\nDar and Saul meet at the Berlin station to resolve the issue of data leaks. Due to the influence of Allison Carr, Dar and Saul come into conflict. In the course of this, both work alongside Carrie to find out about the terrorist attack in Berlin. At the end of this season, Dar Adal presented Carrie with the letter Quinn wrote to her before sailing to Syria.\n\nWhen Senator Elizabeth Keane is elected President of the United States, Dar and Saul relocate to New York to advise her on the country's foreign policy and intelligence efforts. Dar begins secretly plotting with his cabal to undermine Keane out of concern that her antiwar platform will lead to undesirable overhauls of the intelligence community. He starts by seeding a rumor that Iran is running a parallel nuclear program with North Korea, thereby contravening the terms of their nuclear agreement. When Dar learns that Carrie is discreetly advising Keane on foreign policy, he begins working against her as well, sending one of his special operatives to spy on Carrie from across the street of her apartment, and calling child services to place her daughter Frannie in foster care. Dar also oversees the operations of a vast troll farm run by right-wing radio host and provocateur Brett O'Keefe to spread disinformation targeted at Keane. Dar soon learns that a faction within his cabal (led by General Jamie McClendon) has escalated the scope of the operation without his approval, and are now plotting to assassinate Keane and frame Quinn as the perpetrator. Dar calls Carrie to warn her about the assassination attempt; Quinn ultimately sacrifices himself to save Carrie and Keane. Dar is arrested and put in federal custody for his role in the conspiracy. Despite expressing regrets about losing control over his cabal, Dar nonetheless warns Saul that Keane cannot be trusted, and his suspicions are apparently corroborated when Keane arrests over 200 federal employees (including Saul) as backlash for the attempt on her life.\n\nSenator Sam Paley, who is leading a Congressional investigation into the Keane administration, visits Dar in federal prison for insight regarding Saul's sudden trip to Russia. Dar infers that Saul and Carrie are conducting a special operation there, which leads Paley to discover that Saul is planning on exfiltrating a key witness in a Russian conspiracy to undermine Keane's presidency.\n\nPlayed by Nazanin Boniadi, Fara Sherazi is a young Iranian-American financial analyst, who assists Saul in linking the Langley bombing to Majid Javadi. She lives with her father, who was for a time unaware that she worked for the CIA. She has an uncle in Tehran, who assists Carrie when she goes there.\n\nFara later joins Carrie in Islamabad alongside Max Piotrowski as part of an underground task force assembled to track down Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani. Fara follows Haqqani's nephew, medical student Aayan Ibrahim, and discovers that Haqqani did not die in a drone strike that Carrie previously ordered on his compound. Carrie uses this information to seduce Aayan into unwittingly helping the CIA locate Haqqani, though this ultimately leads to Aayan's death at his uncle's hands. Haqqani later storms the U.S. embassy in Islamabad alongside a troupe of armed soldiers in search of a package containing highly classified intelligence about the CIA's network in the region. He takes Fara as a hostage and threatens to kill her unless CIA Director Andrew Lockhart turn over the package. Lockhart complies, but Haqqani nonetheless stabs Fara to death before escaping. Max, implied to have had romantic feelings for Fara, is left devastated by her death, and later chastises Carrie for being a harsh and ungrateful mentor to her.\n\nPlayed by Laila Robins, Martha Boyd is the United States ambassador to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. She and Saul were once romantically linked, and remain friends in the present day. Martha since married Dennis Boyd, an international studies professor who is later found to be the ISI's mole inside the U.S. embassy. Martha helps Carrie entrap Dennis; while in custody, he reveals to Martha that he leaked information about the embassy's secret underground entrance to the ISI, which they realize enabled Haissam Haqqani and his Taliban soldiers to storm the embassy and steal a package of top-secret CIA intelligence. In the aftermath of the massacre at the embassy, Dennis urges Martha to give him his belt so he can hang himself in his jail cell and prevent her from being indicted as an accessory to his crimes. Martha reluctantly complies, but later finds that Dennis did not kill himself and has instead been detained by the CIA.\n\nPlayed by Sebastian Koch, Otto Düring is the founder of the Düring Foundation, a philanthropic organization which is headquartered in Berlin. He hires Carrie Mathison to be his head of security. Otto provides Carrie his home as a temporary safe haven while she investigates the origins of an attempt on her life, and gives her a copy of classified CIA intel passed to him by Saul (which allows her to discover Allison Carr's double agent status). After Carrie stops a terrorist attack from occurring in Berlin, Otto proposes that she become his companion, expressing his admiration for her ambition, talent and world experience. However, she declines. Otto later provides seed funding for Carrie's philanthropic organization providing legal support to Muslims in New York City, and continues making romantic overtures to her over a period of months until she finally rebuffs him.\n\nPlayed by Miranda Otto, Allison Carr is the CIA station chief in Berlin. She is revealed to be a longtime double agent working for the Russians, having been blackmailed by SVR officer Ivan Krupin in 2005 while serving as a case officer in Baghdad. Ivan then became her handler and lover, receiving classified American intelligence in exchange for information that would help Allison rise the ranks of the CIA. Allison is shown to be cunning, materialistic and manipulative, initiating a sexual relationship with Saul following his divorce to gain trust within the upper echelons of the CIA.\n\nIn Berlin, Allison puts out a hit on Carrie after leaked CIA documents mention a connection between Carrie and Ahmed Nazari, one of Allison's high-value assets in Baghdad who was also working for the Russians. Carrie fakes her death and goes into hiding to uncover the conspiracy, and finds clues on Nazari's laptop indicating Allison's allegiance to the Russians. Carrie and Saul hatch a plan alongside German intelligence to lure Allison into being arrested alongside Ivan. Allison is soon released from custody to help thwart an incoming jihadist attack on Berlin. However, the Russians inform Allison that her final task is to ensure that the attack occurs. Allison tracks down one of the jihadists' accomplices, learns the time and location of the attack, then kills the man as well as her CIA escort before shooting herself in the shoulder to stage a shootout. At the hospital, she lies about the location of the attack to mislead the authorities, then escapes while unattended. Saul makes a deal with Ivan, offering him witness protection in the U.S. in exchange for intel on Allison's extraction procedure. Saul and a team intercept Allison's car and kill her.\n\nPlayed by Alexander Fehling, Jonas Hollander is a lawyer at the Düring Foundation and Carrie's boyfriend in Berlin. He begins to distance himself from Carrie after her old life begins seeping into their partnership. He does help provide medical supplies to an injured Peter Quinn, but walks out after Carrie refuses to abandon her mission. He ultimately breaks up with Carrie out of concern for his family's safety.\n\nPlayed by Sarah Sokolovic, Laura Sutton is a dissident American journalist at the Düring Foundation. She publishes leaked CIA documents attesting to mass privacy violations by the American and German governments, having received the files from a pair of hackers. Laura later makes contact with one of the hackers, Numan, who promises her the remainder of the documents. When the BND detain Faisal Marwan, a suspected jihadist who was released after the documents scandal, Laura goes on air threatening to release the remainder of the documents unless Faisal is released from custody, claiming that his civil liberties have been violated. However, Faisal commits suicide to avoid being interrogated. After Numan is arrested by the BND, Astrid threatens Laura with his deportation unless she gives the documents and goes on air denouncing Faisal as a terrorist. Laura reluctantly complies.\n\nPlayed by Elizabeth Marvel, Elizabeth Keane is the President of the United States. Before she takes office, Keane enlists Carrie as a foreign policy advisor, while things are complicated by Dar Adal's attempts to manipulate her agenda. After a special ops group attempts to assassinate her, Keane lashes out at the U.S. intelligence community, ordering dozens of arrests, including Saul Berenson. She ultimately resigns the presidency.\n\nPlayed by Linus Roache, David Wellington is the White House Chief of Staff to Presidents Elizabeth Keane, Ralph Warner and Benjamin Hayes. He is Keane's close friend and former campaign manager during her Congressional days, and is hired after Keane's previous chief of staff, Rob Emmons, is killed. In the early days of Keane's administration, Wellington learns that his on-and-off girlfriend, Simone Martin, is a Russian spy attempting to implicate him for the assassination of General Jamie McClendon, thereby sabotaging the Keane administration. After Keane resigns and her vice president, Ralph Warner, takes over, Wellington remains on as chief of staff. When Warner dies in a helicopter crash and his inexperienced VP, Benjamin Hayes, inherits the presidency, Wellington finds much of his advice falling on deaf ears.\n\nPlayed by Maury Sterling, Max Piotrowski is Virgil's younger brother, who works with him on freelance security consulting operations. Max is reserved and socially awkward, but technically adept and competent at reconnaissance work. He and Virgil help Carrie throughout the Brody investigation, installing surveillance in the Brody family's home and monitoring his activities after he becomes a CIA asset. Carrie later enlists Max alongside Fara Sherazi to her task force in Islamabad to help her find Taliban leader Haissam Haqqani. During this time, Max forms a close bond and partnership with Fara, for whom he harbors romantic feelings, until Haqqani murders Fara during a Taliban raid on the U.S. embassy. Max spends the next two years in a deep depression, and claims to have developed a methamphetamine habit to cope with his grief.\n\nMax later moves to New York to help Carrie take care of Peter Quinn, who is recovering from a stroke. When Quinn uncovers a homegrown conspiracy against the President-elect, Max goes undercover in Brett O'Keefe's shadowy private company, which he learns is a troll farm whose services are being solicited by Dar Adal. Dar himself enlists Max's help in uncovering a plot to frame Quinn for the murder of the President-elect. After Keane's inauguration, Max continues aiding Carrie in Washington D.C., installing surveillance in Chief of Staff David Wellington's apartment, and assisting in the investigation of Simone Martin. Saul forcibly recruits Max into his Russia task force, where Max helps Carrie and Saul extract Simone from Moscow. Max and the rest of the group are personally thanked by President Keane for their efforts in thwarting the Russian conspiracy against the White House.\n\nAbout a year later, Max joins a military unit in Afghanistan, still seeking justice against Haqqani and the Taliban for Fara's death. When President Warner is killed in a helicopter crash, Max and the team are dispatched to the scene. Carrie has Max retrieve the flight recorder from the helicopter to ascertain the cause of the crash; Max succeeds, but the rest of his unit is killed by the Taliban, while he is captured a lone Taliban soldier who sells off the flight recorder. Carrie and Yevgeny Gromov track down Max, who gives Carrie the flight recorder's location before being escorted to another safehouse. At the second compound, Max is held prisoner by Haqqani's son Jalal, who threatens to execute Max unless Haqqani's death sentence is revoked. When Haqqani is executed, Jalal kills Max. While waiting for Max's body to be collected, Carrie breaks down in tears while expressing her guilt over taking Max for granted.\n\nPlayed by Jake Weber, Brett O'Keefe is an influential right-wing radio personality. He also presides over an underground corporation that deploys vast amounts of fake social media accounts in order to influence the general population with his agenda; one of his main orders of business is to discredit Keane before she takes office.\n\nAfter Keane's inauguration, O'Keefe is labeled a fugitive and goes on the run, eventually taking shelter in Lucasville, Ohio with the Elkins family, most of whom staunchly support him. When Saul arrives with the FBI, a standoff ensues between the Elkins family (alongside their armed reinforcements) and the authorities. Saul attempts to negotiate with O'Keefe to deescalate the situation, but O'Keefe allows tensions to rise so that he can broadcast the event live. The standoff eventually culminates in a shootout that results in mass casualties, largely on the Elkins' side. O'Keefe is detained by the FBI and kept in federal custody.\n\nPlayed by Morgan Spector, Dante Allen is an FBI agent formerly stationed in the CIA's Kabul outpost during Carrie's tenure as station chief.\n\nIn the early days of Elizabeth Keane's presidential administration, Dante is part of the team investigating the 200 federal employees Keane arrests as backlash for an assassination attempt months prior. Carrie, believing them to be innocent, enlists Dante's help in securing their release by receiving insider information on misconduct within the White House. Carrie and Dante begin investigating David Wellington, the president's chief of staff, for possible links to the assassination of Jamie McClendon, the corrupt U.S. Army General who spearheaded the plot to eliminate Keane. However, Carrie finds evidence of Wellington's innocence; Saul helps her realize that Dante is likely setting her up to sabotage Wellington on behalf of Russia.\n\nCarrie begins investigating Dante and learns from his ex-wife that he harbored resentment for Carrie in Kabul after her botched drone strike, which resulted in her promotion and his career decline. Carrie surmises that the Russians exploited this vulnerability to recruit Dante to their mission. Dante offers Carrie his apartment as a temporary home for her and her daughter, Frannie. While there, Carrie and Dante confront each other over their mutual suspicion of one another, but it leads to the two of them having sex. However, Saul's team bursts in and captures Dante. During his interrogation, Dante refuses to cooperate with the CIA. Carrie and Saul send in a decoy lawyer to poison him in a manner similar to McClendon; believing the Russians are responsible, Dante admits that Wellington's girlfriend Simone Martin is a Russian asset involved in the plot to kill McClendon. Dante is rushed to the hospital after entering cardiac arrest; when he recovers, he discloses to Carrie the secret Twitter code used by the Russians to dissolve their online network. Dante is eventually found in the hospital by his Russian handler, GRU lieutenant colonel Yevgeny Gromov, who denies Russia's role in Dante's poisoning and suggests that the CIA was responsible. Yevgeny has Dante call Carrie to confirm his suspicions, but Dante warns Carrie that Yevgeny is in the room with him. Yevgeny smothers Dante to death using his hospital pillow, with Carrie arriving at the hospital too late to save him.\n\nPlayed by Costa Ronin, Yevgeny Gromov is a lieutenant colonel in the GRU, Russia's intelligence directorate. He is notorious for conducting disinformation campaigns within governments across the world, the latest being a vast conspiracy to undermine President Keane. Yevgeny is discovered to be employing a network of sock puppets on Twitter as well as handling several moles in proximity to the U.S. government - these include FBI agent Dante Allen (who is murdered by Yevgeny for being a risk as he did with Clayton and Ivan Krupin), as well as Simone Martin, Yevgeny's lover who he extracts from federal witness protection back to Moscow(Simone was almost murdered by Gromov when she became a risk). Saul and Carrie eventually hatch an operation to exfiltrate Simone from Russia so that she can testify in Congress; Carrie wears a wig to mimic Simone's appearance and lures Yevgeny and his men away from Simone long enough for Saul and his team to take her back to the U.S. Carrie is captured by Yevgeny and placed in a Russian gulag, where Yevgeny confiscates her medication unless she records a statement disavowing the CIA. Carrie refuses, and ends up spending the next seven months in captivity until Saul gets her released. During Carrie's captivity, Yevgeny \"saves\" her from attempting to commit suicide by hanging.\n\nYevgeny is later stationed in Kabul, where Russia has connections with the Taliban. He stages several encounters with Carrie to get close to her, and reveals during a conversation that the two of them developed a \"close\" bond during her captivity (which she cannot remember), which led to her divulging various personal secrets to Yevgeny. Carrie's CIA superiors at the Kabul station believe her to have been turned by the Russians due to her relationship with Yevgeny; due to the mutual distrust between her and the CIA, Carrie goes rogue and enlists Yevgeny's help in tracking down Max Piotrowski, as well as the flight recorder on President Warner's downed helicopter. The two eventually find the recorder, which proves that the crash occurred due to mechanical failure. Carrie confronts Yevgeny as to the nature of their relationship in Moscow, leading to the two of them kissing. Yevgeny then sedates Carrie and has his men take the flight recorder; he later makes a deal with Carrie, offering to exchange the flight recorder for the identity of Saul's deeply-embedded asset inside the Kremlin. Yevgeny tells her that the asset must be neutralized one way or another and the only way to stop this is to eliminate said asset or stop the person who is passing the information to the United States. This means that she must kill Saul.\n\nCarrie reluctantly agrees and ultimately succeeds in finding the asset, she completely burned Saul's asset, Anna Pomerantseva (Tatyana Mukha). The asset winded up killing herself, without killing Saul. He was devastated by that. The effect of that all happening was, Carrie was able to avert a war between the U.S. and Pakistan from happening, but the relationship with Saul was severed. She and Yevgeny escape to Russia.\n\nTwo years later, Carrie has defected to Moscow and is in a \"relationship\" with Yevgeny; the two of them live together in the latter's lavish apartment. Yevgeny congratulates her on completing a book denouncing the U.S., unaware that Carrie is secretly operating as Saul's new Russian asset.\n\nMain article: Tasneem Qureishi\n\nPortrayed by Nimrat Kaur, Tasneem Qureishi is an Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agent in Pakistan, and later the organization's Director-General. She is introduced as an antagonist, aiding Haissam Haqqani and the Taliban's takeover of the region in effort to drive out the Americans. Years later, she becomes Saul's ally amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan, hoping to avoid a war. She attempts to talk Haqqani's son Jalal out of waging war on the West, but reverses course after witnessing the dramatic increase in the Taliban's ranks under Jalal's leadership.\n\nPlayed by Numan Acar, Haissam Haqqani is a Taliban commander, and later the organization's leader.\n\nHaqqani is introduced as a high-value CIA target whose compound in Kabul is destroyed by a drone strike ordered by Carrie. However, Carrie later learns that Haqqani was not present at the blast site and is instead in hiding, receiving deliveries of medicine from his nephew Aayan Ibrahim (who survived the blast). Carrie leads Aayan into a meeting with Haqqani in the mountains, but Haqqani emerges with a captured Saul, aware that the CIA has drones overhead ready to assassinate him. He executes Aayan for leading him into a trap. Over the next several days, Haqqani uses Saul as a human shield to travel through Pakistan freely, reuniting with his family after years and reestablishing his public notoriety in the area. Haqqani uses Saul as a bargaining chip to negotiate the release of several Taliban prisoners in U.S. custody. He then brings a troupe of armed Taliban soldiers to storm the U.S. embassy in search of a package containing classified intelligence on the CIA's network in the area. Haqqani and his men slaughter several CIA personnel before retrieving the package and escaping. The attack bolsters Haqqani's presence in the region and allows him to rise the ranks of the Taliban. He covertly makes a deal with Dar Adal, agreeing not to harbor terrorists in Afghanistan, in exchange for being removed from the CIA's kill list.\n\nYears later, Haqqani grows weary of war and becomes interested in negotiating peace in the region. Saul capitalizes on the opportunity, arranging a meeting with Haqqani to broker a peace agreement. The meeting is ambushed by the ISI; Haqqani survives and learns that his eldest son Jalal betrayed him to the ISI over his opposition to peace talks. Haqqani stops short of killing his son and instead exiles him from the family, unaware that Jalal was later picked up by Tasneem. After a helicopter carrying U.S. President Warner and Afghan President Daoud crashes in the mountains, killing both world leaders, Afghanistan's new president, General Abdul Qadir G'ulom, publicly blames Haqqani for the attack and orders his arrest. Haqqani turns himself in to the U.S., hoping for a fair trial, but is swiftly sentenced to death and executed by a firing squad.\n\nThe following is a list of recurring characters who have appeared in at least three episodes of a season or in at least two episodes of two different seasons. The characters are listed in the order they were first credited in the series.\n\nPlayed by Afton Williamson, Helen Walker is the wife of Tom Walker. Aware of his terrorist affiliations, Helen Walker initially agrees to cooperate with the CIA to apprehend her husband Tom. However, at a critical moment, she tips off Tom, allowing him to narrowly escape.\n\nPlayed by Amy Hargreaves, Margaret \"Maggie\" Mathison is Carrie Mathison's sister. Maggie is usually the person that Carrie goes to for support when having personal problems. As a medical doctor (though not a psychiatrist), Maggie secretly obtains medication for Carrie to control her bipolar disorder. Maggie also strives to remain in touch with her family, letting her and Carrie's father Frank stay in her home, and herself having a husband and two kids. Once Carrie gives birth to her daughter, Frannie, Maggie is largely responsible for taking care of the child, given Carrie's enduring commitment to her intelligence work. Carrie and Frannie move in with Maggie after Carrie is fired from her job at the White House. However, Carrie's increasing inability to look after her child, as well as the repeated trauma to which she exposes Frannie because of her field work, leaves Maggie no choice but to seek custody of Frannie. At the custody hearing, Carrie accepts an agreement allowing her to see Frannie every other weekend.\n\nPlayed by Alok Tewari, Latif Bin Walid is the majordomo for Prince Farid who was an agent for Abu Nazir.\n\nPlayed by Omid Abtahi, Raqim Faisel, along with his girlfriend Aileen Morgan, are low-level al-Qaeda operatives living in the United States.

The CIA discovers the house, sending them on the run. Faisel is murdered by unknown assailants while he and Aileen are hiding out at a motel.\n\nPlayed by Marin Ireland, Aileen Margaret Morgan, along with her boyfriend Raqim Faisel, are low-level al-Qaeda operatives living in the United States. Morgan was born in the U.S. but took on an anti-American perspective while living her teenage years in Saudi Arabia. As part of an al-Qaeda plot, Morgan and Faisel are assigned to purchase a house within sniper range of a Marine One landing pad. The CIA discovers the house, sending them on the run. Faisel is killed, and Morgan is arrested in Mexico by Saul Berenson.

Morgan ultimately commits suicide during a lengthy stay in solitary confinement.\n\nPlayed by Hrach Titizian, Danny Galvez is a Muslim-American CIA officer with a Lebanese mother and a Guatemalan father who assists Carrie in most of her cases. He is attacked in one of his missions and shot, and takes a few weeks to recover. He is then believed to be a mole by Carrie, but her suspicions are proven wrong when he presents his alibi for leaving the compound.\n\nPlayed by James Rebhorn, Frank Mathison is Carrie Mathison's father. Like Carrie, Frank also has bipolar disorder, but is able to manage it more effectively than his daughter due to his commitment to therapy and medication.
