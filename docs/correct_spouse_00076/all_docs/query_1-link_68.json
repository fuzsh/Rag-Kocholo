        "text": "Acts 2:1—21\n\nI love the bulletin covers we’re using today . In the past, we used to order bulletins from the United Church Bookstore, specifically designed for occasions like Pentecost. However, before Easter this year, we had the idea of using the children’s artwork instead. On that occasion, I only selected one piece for the bulletin cover. Then, someone suggested that we should use all the pictures the children had produced in Sunday school. So that’s precisely what I did this time. Last week, they produced five pieces of artwork in class, and I used them on two versions of the bulletin to include all the pictures. I find the creativity in the artwork produced by our young people quite wonderful, especially in their different interpretations of the Pentecost story. Take, for example, the top-left picture, where you can clearly see the depiction of tongues of fire. Everyone I have shown this picture to has remarked that the Holy Spirit resembles Casper the friendly Holy Ghost! In the next picture, the people in the foreground have their backs turned towards us because they are gazing at the birds, which adds a wonderful element to the story. The third picture shows God sending the Spirit down onto the people from His fingers. This particular image truly highlights the large crowds that had gathered in the streets of Jerusalem from various regions beyond Israel. However, what truly struck me about all these pictures is that while they all incorporate elements of the Pentecost story, each one of them is unique in its own right. Together, they incorporate a message of both unity and diversity. And unity and diversity are key themes from our text today. So let’s take another look at this story from Acts, which is a tale about the birth of the church, and see if we can discover something we haven’t noticed before.\n\nThe text tells us that the Jewish followers of Jesus gathered on Pentecost, also known as Shavuot. This festival served as both a harvest celebration and a commemoration of God’s law being given on Mount. Sinai. Interestingly, a tradition in the Jewish Midrash states that when the Torah emerged from God’s mouth, like tongues of fire, it split into 70 different languages. This symbolizes the intention for God’s word and the law to reach all people, including those who were outside the immediate community of Israel. So, we can see that the Pentecost story mirrors something that’s already found in the Jewish tradition. In Acts, Jesus’ followers are gathered in the upper room, and the Holy Spirit descends upon them, accompanied by a violent wind and tongues of fire. Similar to the story from the midrash, the voice of God, through Jesus’ followers, breaks into many languages, including the languages of the strangers in the streets who have come to Jerusalem.\n\nPreacher Rachel May points out that there are two “theys” in this story. The first “they,” in verse 1, refers to Jesus’ followers “they” who were all gathered in one place. And in verse 7, there is another “they”—the people outside on the street, they who were “amazed and astonished.” They asked, “Aren’t these people Galilean? How is it that they are speaking in our language? Surely, they’re drunk!” The “they” who are speaking those words are mostly Jews, who have travelled to Jerusalem from various locations around the Mediterranean and even beyond, to attend religious festivals. However, despite being Jewish, they all speak different languages. They share the commonality of being Jews, but they are also distinct from one another in terms of language and cultural background. Therefore, there are two groups referred to as “they” in this story. And the core message of Pentecost revolves around bringing these two diverse groups together as one united “us”—a community that is both unified and diverse. However, there’s a natural tendency for most of us to resist diversity. We, who I suppose as the church represent the “they” in the upper room, often tend to prefer a monoculture where we are alike in most ways, where there’s a sense of “sameness” among us.\n\nAn author of a blog post from the Leeds Church Institute reflects on the same text, focusing on a particular city in the north of England. The writer highlights that during the time when the story took place in Jerusalem, there were likely around 15 commonly spoken languages, such as Aramaic, Greek, Roman, and Hebrew. However, in present-day Leeds, there are at least 85 different languages spoken, with many individuals using English as a second or even a third language. The writer notes that the inability to communicate effectively in English, the dominant local language, leads to exclusion from essential activities and services for many people in Leeds. These individuals face challenges in accessing education, healthcare, and employment due to difficulties with spoken and written English. Language and culture can serve as barriers to community involvement as well as participation in the life of the church. Additionally, the pressure to conform and assimilate often threatens a person’s desire to preserve their own native language and culture.\n\nI was curious about the number of languages spoken in PEI, but I couldn’t find that information. However, I discovered that between 2016 and 2021, the number of PEI residents whose primary language was neither French nor English doubled. At that time, non-English and non-French-speaking individuals made up 6% of the island’s population. In fact, PEI is the fastest-growing province in Canada. A question we can ask ourselves is, who do we consider to be the “they” in our society, and how do we perceive them in terms of our Christian calling? How open are we to those who are “different” from the majority in terms of race, culture, language, faith, viewpoint, or other aspects such as gender identity?”\n\nWhen we discussed this text on Wednesday, Rev. Dale Skinner pointed out something that made us realize the radical inclusivity of Luke (the author of Acts) and the diversity of the Jewish diaspora (i.e., the people who, over centuries, had been dispersed in faraway countries from Israel). The first three groups of people mentioned as “outsiders” are the Parthians, the Medes, and the Elamites. Dale pointed out that the Parthians lived far away from Jerusalem, well beyond the Mediterranean region, and had been declining for centuries as a people and a culture. The Medes, well, they hadn’t been heard from for a long time, and the Elamites hadn’t even existed for about 500 years before this story took place. But remarkably, representatives from these very distant communities are all there in Jerusalem on that day. In other words, what Luke is saying is that the spirit resists the human tendency we have to exclude others. The spirit refuses to discriminate, and the Spirit permeates time, culture, and distance. The spirit is all embracing of all people.\n\nThere is a relatively new verb in usage called “queering.” The noun “queer” has historically been used as an insult against people in the LGBTQI community, and unfortunately, it is still used this way at times. However, as a verb, “queering” typically means to challenge and deconstruct traditional notions of gender, sexuality, and identity. Essentially, it involves questioning and even subverting what society considers to be established norms. The purpose of queering is to reveal and resist the limitations and exclusions that these norms impose. This term is rooted in something called “queer theory,” and it is used to explore and destabilize what society defines as “normal” and acceptable. By queering, one can create a sense of discomfort among those who perceive themselves as representing normality. However, queering can also be applied in various other contexts and areas of society beyond gender issues.\n\nIt can be used in art, for example. We could argue that classical music was queered and became jazz. Jazz was queered and became rock and roll. Rock was queered to create space for punk rock and rap. (If you felt any sense of discomfort when I asked to join in the rap chorus today, that was queering.) But, don’t worry, it was the Holy Spirit creating that discomfort and pushing against your boundaries.\n\nRev. Thomas Bohache suggests that the Pentecost story becomes queer through the Holy Spirit. This is because it testifies that God’s message of wholeness will be heard in diverse ways and through diverse messengers. It is a truth that can be understood in various ways, according to the individual needs of the listener. The Holy Spirit resists only speaking the language of the Roman Empire: Latin. She resists speaking the language of the Galilean dialect—Aramaic. The God of Pentecost resisted the majority languages and spoke in the languages of the people on the margins.” In other words, as Thomas Bohache proposes, it is not about believers focusing inward and attracting others with their message. Instead, it is about the Holy Spirit standing alongside those on the margins and saying, “There is something here for you!” There’s a song called “A Living Pentecost” that says it in this way, from the perspective of those who are outside the norm, i.e., Those who were not in the upper room.\n\nStreets are filled with many people, voices raised in every tongue, bringing the first fruits of their harvest, a gift to God from old and young. In the midst of celebration, comes a new unsettling sound: A cacophony of praising, words alive, Spirit unbound!\n\nMighty wind blows through the city, sweeping a new age into birth, holy fire to burn the boundaries, and ignite God’s work on earth. Aramaic, Persian, Coptic, Parthian, Arabic, and Greek, heard and understood and spoken, God in multilingual speak!\n\nWake-up call to every nation, chaos melts, new paths made plain, harvest now for new creation, these the first-fruits of Christ’s reign. We, God’s Church, arise for action, moving in faith to break new ground, Spirit, take us to the margins where your living work is found.\n\nGod is here, (in the streets) speaking our language, speaking as we do, Christ alive here in Spirit, and turns the tables, upsets conventions, brings a new church to birth, today a living Pentecost.\n\nAs we reflect on Pentecost through the words of Luke and that lens of queering, let us sense the Holy Spirit’s radical call to embrace diversity and break down barriers. Let us welcome all voices, especially those from the margins, into our community. Together, let’s create a vibrant, inclusive church that truly embodies the spirit of Pentecost. Let us join in this transformative journey. Let’s live out the message of love and acceptance every day.\n\nYork Sunday School Class ↩\n\nRachel May: A Sermon for Every Sunday ↩\n\nLeeds Church Institute blog ↩\n\nCBC Article August 18th 2022 ↩\n\nRev.

This might be when playing football or netball, for example. The teacher would choose two team captains who would then take turns selecting the kids for their respective teams. Typically, the captains would select the bigger and more skilled players first, leaving the smaller and less talented students to be picked last. In my case, when it came to football, I was one of the skinniest kids in class and not particularly good at the game either, so I was always one of the last ones picked. If I was eventually selected, my team captain would reluctantly say, “Okay, come on Atwood!” He would assign me to the right or the left wing, far away from where the action was happening, as if to minimize any potential damage, I could cause. I’m not sure if this practice still exists in schools today. I hope not because as someone who was often picked last, I understand how it feels to be excluded and undervalued.\n\nThat experience reminded me of this text from the book of Acts in some ways. The apostles were attempting to find a replacement for Judas, who had betrayed Jesus and had subsequently taken his life. Judas’s most significant sin was that instead of seeking forgiveness for his wrongdoing, he chose to separate himself from the community. So, as a result, the remaining apostles undertook the task of selecting a replacement. However, there are several problematic aspects to the way they approached this. Firstly, Jesus had already promised the disciples that the Holy Spirit would come upon them and provide guidance. Therefore, one could argue that they acted prematurely in selecting someone before Pentecost had occurred. Secondly, even though there were at least 120 believers in the community, Peter, and the apostles established criteria that significantly limited the pool of potential candidates. For instance, they decided that the person to replace Judas had to have known Jesus from the time of his baptism until his ascension. This reduced the pool of who could be selected down to two men: Mathias and Joseph, also known as Justus. Then, to determine the chosen one, they resorted to casting lots or throwing dice. This process was akin to a game of chance, a crap shoot if you will, and it ultimately led to Mathias being selected. The question arises: was this the correct decision? Although it remains uncertain, it is worth noting that Mathias’s name is never mentioned again in the New Testament, unlike the other apostles. So, did he ever play a role in the development and well-being of the early Christian community? I wonder if the apostles felt inadequate or incomplete because there were only eleven of them instead of the expected twelve. The number twelve symbolized the twelve tribes of Israel. It represented completeness, I suppose. But, instead of patiently waiting for the Holy Spirit, they gave in to the common human tendency to try to take control when feeling broken or inadequate. Men often do this, disregarding caution and not waiting for the voice of the Spirit to guide us. We take charge, we set criteria, we make decisions, risking the exclusion and gifts of others.\n\nThe apostles insisted on selecting someone who had known Jesus from his baptism to his ascension. But why did it have to be someone who knew Jesus in such a way? Judas had known Jesus intimately, and we all know how that turned out. And while these criteria were valid, there were also women who had known Jesus for that long. Why couldn’t one of them have been chosen? Well, yes, it was a patriarchal time in history. Men who were church leaders typically controlled the criteria to exclude women from roles where they could offer ministry. This continues to the present day.\n\nJudy, a member of our online Bible study group, is Jewish now, but she used to be a member of a conservative Christian church. Ten years ago, she went on a trip to Israel, and when she returned, her congregation asked her to give a presentation on her experiences. However, her pastor told her that she could give the presentation, but she was not allowed to use any Scripture passages because men would be attending! Judy said, “Can you imagine, having been to Israel and not being able to use scripture to illustrate the places I visited?”\n\nIn our story from Acts, Matthias was the one selected to be an apostle over Justus. We never hear of Matthias again, and of course, we never hear anything further about Justus either. But no doubt, he was an integral part of that community. I wonder how Justus felt when he was not selected? I imagine it was similar to how I felt when I was the last one chosen for the football team. Or how Judy felt when she was allowed to present her experiences but not valued for her theological and biblical insights. Justus may not have become an apostle, but can we imagine that he served in many other ways , testifying through his life to the resurrection of Jesus. He may have lost the casting of the dice, but I’ll bet he never lost his faith. The Book of Acts notes that there were countless unnamed individuals who shared the story of Jesus with others, either through their words or in the way they lived. I wonder who were the unsung witnesses of the resurrection in our lives? There was an elderly spinster from our Methodist congregation at home, her name was Nea Smith. Nea was deeply committed to our church and an active member of the UCW. Her lemon cake was undoubtedly the most delicious you can imagine, and Margaret still has the recipe. Nea had a knack for organizing games and activities that brought UCW meetings to life, fostering a sense of community among its members. She was also a trained nurse and, as she neared the end of her life, Nea was aware of her physical decline and what awaited her. But she was prepared for that.\n\nNea was a very traditional person and tended to stick to the tried and true methods, avoiding any newfangled ways of doing things. Consequently, when it came to planning her funeral before her passing, she asked the minister, “I would rather not be wheeled into the church, I want to be carried in. There are two stools under the choir loft, and I dusted them off with pledge this week. When the time comes, I want my coffin to rest there on those two stools by the communion rail at the front of the church.” As Nea prepared for her final visit to the hospital, she had already laid out the clothes she wished to be buried in on her bed. When I heard this story from the minister, I said to Margaret that evening, “If that’s not faith, then I don’t know what is.” Nea’s unwavering belief, her commitment to her community and her practical preparations as she neared the end of her life exemplified the spirit of Methodism to me more than any of the well-known theological writers I have read about.\n\nNea, for me, embodied the same qualities I can imagine Justus had from our story: faithfulness and dedication to his community. Who in your life reminds you of Justus? I invite you to name and honor these individuals, and to share what about them inspired you?\n\nYes!, there are so many individuals who have contributed quietly but profoundly to their communities. Like Justus, they may not have held a prominent position, yet their steadfast faith and service have left an indelible mark. Let’s honor and celebrate such unsung heroes among us, whose lives inspire us to live with faith and purpose.\n\nWhen we recently went to Sackville to drop off items at the archives, one of them was a UCW minute book from Stanhope. We left it with the archivist. But looking back, I regret not taking the opportunity to open it and explore the history of the faithful women who were part of the Stanhope community. So the next time I’m in Sackville, I plan on finding that book again and delving into its contents. I would like to discover the names of those dedicated women, I would like to learn more about their contributions to our community. I want to hear their stories…I would like to hear their voices.\n\nJudy: Lectionary Ball Game ↩\n\nFeasting On The Word Year B Vol2, pp.530 ↩\n\nRate this:\n\nActs 8:26-40\n\nThe road to Gaza , which Philip traveled on in our story from the Book of Acts, was a scorching and arid journey through the desert. Located south of Jerusalem, it symbolized division not only between Israel and Egypt, but also between Israel and Ethiopia. This division extended to people of diverse racial backgrounds and cultures. As I read this passage, it struck me how even today the word “Gaza” continues to represent division among people and communities, particularly in recent times between Israelis and Palestinians. The influence of this desert road to Gaza is still evident in the fractured relationships between people. It ”symbolizes the difficult path to peace in our world today.” We witness it in the news and in the protest marches occurring on the campuses of numerous North American universities. Even in the present day, the word Gaza evokes thoughts of division, conflict, and exclusion.\n\nThe book we are reading from should actually be titled “Acts of the Holy Spirit” instead of “Acts of the Apostles”. This is because it was the Spirit of God that empowered the early church and connected the Christian community with the wider world, rather than the personal motivations of individual members. For instance, Philip didn’t randomly decide one morning, “I think I’ll go to Gaza today!” No, he was compelled by the Spirit to go into the desert. The Spirit prompted him to “get up and go!” and so he got up and he went.\n\nPhilip was traveling south along the road to Gaza when he was overtaken by a chariot. We can learn a lot about the person in the chariot, both from the information provided and from what is left unsaid. The details paint a vivid picture: this is no ordinary chariot. The occupant is engrossed in reading a scroll from the book of Isaiah. It is clear that he cannot be both driving a chariot and reading a biblical scroll simultaneously. So let us imagine a grand, opulent chariot, hung with luxurious furnishings, being pulled by four horses adorned with decorative plumes. In the back seat sits a well-dressed passenger, immersed in his reading. Clearly, this man is wealthy. Not only is his mode of transportation extravagant, but also owning a personal copy of a biblical scroll is a luxury that few can afford. Furthermore, we come to know that he holds a high and important position as the chief treasurer of the Candace, whom the queen of Ethiopia. However, there is an ironic twist to this story. Despite his wealth and importance, this man is also a slave and a eunuch. Eunuchs were male slaves who had been castrated, either at birth or later in life. They were often entrusted with the oversight of a harem, for obvious reasons, and occasionally managed to rise to influential positions within the Ethiopian court. But the person in the chariot defies any attempt we might make to confine him or define him. He shows his intelligence through his ability to read, and enjoys both affluence and respect. However, at the same time, he is enslaved.\n\nAccording to the story, he was returning to Ethiopia from Jerusalem, where he had been worshiping at the temple. However, he was not a Jew; instead, he was known as a God-fearer, someone who was drawn to the God worshiped by the Jews. Nevertheless, even if he had been a jew he would not have been permitted to worship inside the temple because, as stated in the book of Deuteronomy, “No one with crushed or severed genitals may enter the assembly of the Lord” (Deut 23.1). Eunuchs were considered a “third” inferior sex, neither male nor female. Consequently, regardless of their societal success, they would never be allowed to enter certain places, such as the temple. This individual would have been excluded and restricted to the Court of the Gentiles.\n\nIt’s interesting that he is reading from the book of Isaiah because Isaiah is a text that encourages the inclusion of those who were not Jews. In Isaiah, we read, “To the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths, who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant, to them, I will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters.” So this man is reading a text that is about inclusion and hope, but he’s struggling to understand the full measure of what the prophet was writing about. He was reading the text aloud, which was how people used to read in those days. Reading privately and in silence, as we tend to do, was a practice that developed much later in history. So this is how Phillip knew that the eunuch was reading from the book of Isaiah.\n\nSo let’s imagine Phillip running as fast as he can to catch up with the chariot. He draws alongside and shouts, “Do you understand what you’re reading?” The eunuch replies, “Well, no. How can I when there’s no one to guide me?” There’s a significant difference between reading and studying the Bible texts alone, individually, and reading them and discussing them with others in the community. Studying the texts in relationship with others connects us not only to the words on the page but also to the stories and pages of each other’s lives. So, Phillip accepted the invitation to join this person in his chariot, and travel together along the road to Gaza for a while, and to discuss and discover the transformative power and grace of God’s word. I envision that this episode was more than just Phillip, the teacher, explaining his interpretation of the text to the eunuch. Instead, their conversation involved sharing and discovering how Isaiah’s words spoke to their individual lives. I can imagine the eunuch saying, “You know, Phillip, when I read those words, ‘like a lamb is silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth,’ and ‘in his humiliation, justice was denied him,’ I don’t know who the prophet is referring to, but I certainly understand the feeling of humiliation and powerlessness. I didn’t choose to be the way I am sexually, I did choose to use my skills and abilities to serve others. Sadly, I have experienced humiliation, even within God’s temple, in Gods house.”\n\nAnd I think Phillip, as he listened to this person’s life story and challenges, was deeply impacted by scripture and this personal narrative. It made him realize that maybe he needed to be more tolerant towards those who were of a different race, culture, and sexual orientation than his own. In fact, it was not just about being “tolerant,” but about fully accepting others. There is a distinction between tolerance and acceptance. Tolerance can imply, “I may not approve of your identity or lifestyle, but since I am a Christian and a person of faith, I’ll put up with you. ‘Hate the sin, love the sinner.” On the other hand, acceptance means that regardless of who you are—whether gay or straight, white or a person of color, liberal, or conservative in your beliefs, and regardless of the struggles you may be facing—you are welcomed in this place and in our community. Because “we are building a house where all are named and a place where everyone’s songs and visions are heard.”\n\nI remember a lesson I learned in 1984 about the difference between tolerating others and accepting them. I was working as a project leader for the Bermuda Government. At that time, I had just completed the design of a new payroll tax computer system, which was responsible for processing the second-largest income stream for the government. One of my programmers, Robert, was assigned to write the computer code for the most crucial and complex part of the system. Robert and I had a great rapport and often engaged in fascinating theological discussions in our office. I deeply admired his intelligence, humour, and wit, and he introduced me to authors and writers who continue to influence me today. One of these authors was a Trappist Monk named Thomas Merton, who wrote the spiritual autobiography, “The Seven-Story Mountain.” However, despite our positive relationship, Robert was struggling to complete his work, causing us to fall behind schedule. And the day came when I had to have a “Come to Jesus” talk to him, to have a serious discussion with Robert about the issues he was causing for the project. As I addressed these problems, I could see that he was upset, and there were tears in his eyes. So something told me to get up and go somewhere else so that we could talk outside the office environment. We went down to Par-la-Ville Park, which was nearby. We sat on a bench together, and he poured his heart out to me. He told me he had been in a relationship with another man, but that it had recently broken up. He said that he didn’t know what to do, and that it had devastated him, and obviously, it was affecting his concentration at work.\n\nI didn’t know what to do or what to say. His lifestyle challenged my assumptions about Christian life and morality, at least at that time. I would have described myself in those days more as a “tolerant” person than one who accepts others without judgment. However, when Robert shared his pain and struggles with me, everything else—work, computer systems, project schedules—suddenly seemed trivial compared to the challenges he was facing. The most important thing I did that day was in offering him my friendship and to begin my own transition from tolerance to acceptance. Robert has since passed away, but I consider my friendship with him to have begun not during those theological discussions and arguments we had in the office, but on the day we sat together on a bench in Par-la-Ville Park. It was then that I came to know the pain and struggle in his life, a pain that did not fit the pattern I was so comfortable with in my beliefs.\n\nThomas Merton once wrote, “The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our image. If, in loving them, we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them.” We can become so wrapped up in where we are that we become more concerned about our glory rather than the glory of God, which shines through others.\n\nSo, returning to our story, Philip, and the eunuch were traveling along the road to Gaza when they came across some water (imagine that… water in the middle of a desert). The eunuch noticed it and said, “Look, here is water! What is stopping me from being baptized?” Without hesitation, they got out of the chariot, and Philip baptized him, warmly welcoming him into the Christian community.\n\nLikewise, we are a people of resurrection, journeying towards Gaza. Moved by the Spirit, who urges us to get up and go from this place, and to engage with those who have endured injustice, rejection, and mere tolerance instead of acceptance. There is water in the desert, so is there any reason at all why we cannot wholeheartedly accept every one of God’s children?\n\nImage: A Desert Nova by Jacob-Routzahn ↩\n\nJohn E.

Margaret and I went to Kensington to see it. What can I say? It was an extraordinary experience, one that I might even describe as bringing a sense of the holy and sacred. During the moment of totality, darkness descended, and everyone around us paused and gazed up at this astounding phenomenon in the sky. Lowell shared that where he and Mary Lou observed the event, two seagulls and a crow sat on a branch and also looked up at the eclipse, just like everyone else. Such special moments can truly alter our perspective on the world. David Makepeace, who witnessed an eclipse in the 1990s, expressed, “I flew to Mexico to visit a girl. I didn’t go for the eclipse, but then it happened, and it amazed me. The sight in the sky was intense, and it felt as if my consciousness was lifted from the two-dimensional existence I was living. It opened up a three-dimensional reality for which I was unprepared. “ I spent the next couple of days sitting on the shores of the Sea of Cortez, just pondering my existence, and how could something have been just so fantastic, and so uplifting? It felt like there was something I had to figure out about it.”\n\nEvery so often we can become trapped in our usual patterns of thinking and need a new experience to gain a fresh perspective. This is true even for the most brilliant scientists. In 1919, Albert Einstein used a solar eclipse to support his theory of gravity. According to his thinking, the Sun’s gravitational pull would cause light to bend as it passed by distant stars. Astronomers put his theory to the test during a solar eclipse on May 29, 1919. They observed that stars near the Sun appeared slightly shifted, just as Einstein had predicted. Einstein was not surprised by these findings, as he knew his theory was correct. However, even the greatest minds can face challenges. Despite Einstein’s mastery of his theory of General Relativity, he struggled when confronted with Quantum physics. In this field, the natural world and the universe appeared to be governed by randomness and uncertainty. Events seemed to unfold by chance. This led Einstein to famously protest, “God does not play dice with the universe.” However, later on, Stephen Hawking, an expert in Quantum physics, asserted, “God indeed plays dice with the universe, and he throws the dice where they cannot be seen.”\n\nIn today’s gospel reading, God reveals the hidden dice to the disciples, transforming their understanding of whom Jesus is and showing them the risen Christ who has conquered death. And then, Jesus commissions them to be witnesses of the resurrection. However, at that moment, the disciples find themselves behind locked doors, overwhelmed by fear and uncertainty. They struggled to grasp the extraordinary reality before them and are unsure of how to proceed as a community. Can we really blame them? They have just experienced the most challenging week of their lives. Not only that, since Jesus’ death, they have heard reports of Him appearing to others. Can they trust the testimonies of the women who visited the tomb? What about Peter, who found the tomb empty? Now, two other disciples have joined them, sharing their encounter with Jesus on the road to Emmaus. These followers declare, “He is risen.” But what does that mean? As the disciples sit and discuss these things, Jesus suddenly appears. Filled with fear, they initially mistake Him for a spirit or ghost. They struggle to accept that this is the real, living, breathing Jesus. Jesus invites them to touch His hands and feet, but they remain unconvinced. It is only when Jesus asks for a piece of fish to eat that they finally begin to believe. What helps them in their belief is Jesus pointing them back to the scriptures, to the Torah, which has always shown that in the history of the people of Israel, life always triumphs over death. The disciples in this story struggle to accept a reality that eclipses their understanding. The fact that Jesus stands before them in the flesh contradicts everything they have just witnessed in his suffering and death. This story also challenges our context. Just as the disciples faced challenges in reconciling the resurrection with their preconceived notions and expectations of Jesus’ fate, we too often struggle to reconcile our faith with the complexities of the world around us. In our modern context, where skepticism and doubt often prevail, the resurrection challenges our understanding of life and death, the natural order, and the limits of human comprehension.\n\nIn biblical studies, there is a term called “hermeneutics,” it refers to the way we interpret biblical texts. One approach used in reading the Bible is adopting a “hermeneutic of suspicion.” Although it may sound strange, this approach is helpful because it considers the historical context and encourages us to carefully examine and question the motives and intentions of the biblical authors. However, hermeneutics can also be applied to how we view life in general. We can see reality itself as a narrative through a hermeneutic of suspicion, or even a hermeneutic of fear. In other words, we may see life as something that happens to us rather than for us.\n\nThere is a story about a traveller in the early days of the West who came to the Mississippi River and discovered, in despair, that there was no bridge across. Fortunately, it was winter and the river was covered in ice. However, the traveller was afraid to trust it, unsure of its thickness. Ultimately, with great caution, he started crawling across on his hands and knees and made it halfway over. Then, he heard someone singing from behind him. He turned cautiously and saw another traveller driving a four-horse wagon of coal over the ice. The second traveller was singing joyfully as he crossed the frozen river at great speed. What was the difference between the two travelers? Perhaps the horse-drawn traveller already knew the thickness of the ice. However, I believe it was also their hermeneutic about life itself that influenced their crossing. As a community, how do we transform ourselves from fearful travelers crawling on our hands and knees to those who venture out onto the ice with a song in our hearts? Like those disciples, our narrative of life in God includes the reality of the resurrection. And the resurrection means that the ice is always thicker than we imagine it to be.\n\nThis story from Luke is about doubt, but it’s also about joy and wonder. Preacher Delmer Chiltern shares his experience of growing up in a conservative Southern Baptist church. During Sunday school, one of the rituals was reciting a “memory verse” when your name was called. In the class, the boys were told that “Jesus wept” was no longer an appropriate memory verse. Delmer chose another verse instead: “Still they stood there undecided, filled with joy and doubt” . However, the teacher did not approve of his choice, partly because he quoted from The Living Bible, and partly because of that word “doubt.” As a young boy in a conservative congregation, Delmer felt like he was the only one who had doubts. Everyone else seemed so confident and sure. Those with doubts were told to ignore them and simply have faith. But how does one switch off their brain once it has been awakened? So when Delmer came across this verse, he felt a deep connection to it. It was right there in the Bible! Jesus’ disciples also experienced doubt and wonder, even when they saw the resurrected Jesus before them. This verse became a turning point for Delmer. Previously, he believed that to be a Christian, he had to unquestioningly understand and believe everything. However, after that moment, he realized that he could stand in a place of uncertainty and still be filled with Christian joy, embracing both his doubt and wonder. It wasn’t a choice between one or the other—it could be both.\n\nWhat I find so interesting about this text from Luke is that, regardless of the particulars of the resurrection or even what we believe about the resurrection, it’s about the tangible presence of Jesus in the community. The gathering in that room contains all the elements of how we gather in this sanctuary. There is a coming together of the people of God, there’s the presence of Jesus in worship, at times we have the sharing of a meal, and there’s the message from scripture. Finally, there is the sending out! Like the disciples in the room that day, we too gather as a church and are sent out as witnesses to the Gospel. This is what we are called to live by as a community. Challenges may surround us, but the risen Christ is among us, calling us to touch his hands and feet through touching each other and by witnessing to the resurrection outside this place. As we progress through this Easter season and beyond, we may sometimes feel that we are being buried , but in fact we are being planted. So let us embrace doubt and wonder, for they enrich our faith journey. Stand firm in uncertainty, yet be filled with the tangible presence of Jesus. Go forth as witnesses to the Gospel, living out the resurrection’s transformative power in our world.\n\nAmen\n\nImage provided by Phil Hart ↩\n\nDavid MakePeace CBC News, Mar 15, 2024 ↩\n\nDelmer Chiltern, Sermon from Lectionary Lab Live 2024 ↩\n\nLuke 24:41—The Living Bible ↩\n\nChristine Caine: Quote ↩\n\nRate this:\n\nActs 4:32–5:11\n\nOne thing that I find fascinating is studying maps and geography. I am particularly interested in human activity or culture over time changes the landscape. For example, If you fly over England and then over Wales and look down from above, you will notice that the enclosed land parcels in Wales are generally smaller than those in England. This difference is partially due to land ownership practices. In England, land was primarily passed down to the eldest son due to inheritance laws throughout much of the country’s history. As a result, property boundaries tended to remain the same in successive generations. However, in Wales, a different legal system called “cyfraith tref” (pronounced “ca-fraith trave”) was in place. Their system was more flexible, allowing for land to be equally divided among children. Consequently, over time, the land parcels became progressively smaller.\n\nThis also made me wonder what Prince Edward Island (PEI) might have looked like from above before the colonists arrived. Would we have seen enclosures such as walls or fences dividing up the land, similar to Wales and England? While there were enclosures of sorts in Canada before the colonists arrived, they were not artificial. The First Nations people tended to use natural landmarks like rivers, mountains, and forests as territorial boundaries. These boundaries, however, were not fixed and changed based on ecological conditions and seasonal variations. Additionally, the First Nations people practiced more of a collective stewardship of land, rather than individually based ownership, which is what we are familiar with. The land was available to anyone in the tribe who needed to use it. This concept seems to reflect what we read in Acts about the use and distribution of property, where it states, “There was not a needy person among them”; property was shared.\n\nIt was Luke who wrote the book of Acts, and the reason the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles are separate books is because they couldn’t both fit onto the same scroll. In the Gospel of Luke, on the first scroll, we find the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. On the second scroll, we have the story of the Christian community after the resurrection. In Acts, Luke explores the question, “What does the Christian community look like after the resurrection?” Basically, he is asking, “Hallelujah! Jesus has been resurrected, but…what now?” In other words, how has our community changed because Jesus lives? The text we are examining portrays this resurrected Christian community idealistically. For instance, Luke informs us that:\n\nThey were all of one heart and soul.\n\nThe apostles boldly proclaimed their witness of the resurrection.\n\nThere were no needy individuals among them.\n\nEverything they owned was shared in common.\n\nWell, it wasn’t quite as ideal as that. In the second part of today’s text, we have the story of Barnabas, also known as “Barney” in the Cotton Patch Gospel. Barnabas was apparently not from the region of Jerusalem but a Syrian from Cyprus, someone who came from far and wasn’t originally part of that community. However, Barnabas embodied the spirit of generosity. He sold a field he owned and gave the proceeds to the apostles so they could distribute them to those in need. But then there’s the story of Ananias and his wife Saphira, who also sold property. They told the apostles they were giving all the proceeds to the church, but they were caught lying when they secretly kept some money for themselves. Although they were free to do so, they were not free to lie about it. In the story, they both tragically died suddenly, not for being stingy, but because they lied to their community. Setting aside the severity of the consequences, it is clear that honesty was crucial to good relations within the community. It was fundamental to how these people lived and worshiped together. From that story, we can see that the church wasn’t perfect, but it was based on the idea of “Koinonia,” a Greek word mentioned 42 times in the New Testament, first appearing in Acts 2:42. “And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching, and to fellowship (Koinonia), to the breaking of bread and the prayers.” These are the underlying practices that have always defined the Christian community: teaching or the Word; the breaking of bread, i.e., the sacraments; and the prayers, in other words, worship. But, more importantly, those three things are intended to take place within the context of fellowship. This has often been the missing ingredient in churches. You see, it’s fellowship that drives the forward momentum of a church. It’s fellowship that takes the community to the place where God wants it to go. So, what is fellowship, Koinonia and what does it look like within a resurrected community?\n\nThis week, I read a story about Clarence Jordan, an American farmer from Georgia, USA. He was not only an ordained minister but also a New Testament Greek scholar. Inspired by the early Christian community and the concept of “Koinonia,” Jordan founded a community farm. This 400-acre farm had jointly owned land, and every member of the community was treated as equals. However, by implementing this fellowship concept, Jordan challenged the existing state of affairs. In 1942, in the southern states, treating both whites and people of colour equally, in terms of pay and benefits, was unheard of. The reaction from the wider white community was unfavorable, to say the least. They couldn’t comprehend the idea of whites and people of colour sharing meals or cooperating in work. During that time, people of colour were not even allowed in white churches, let alone provided the opportunity to sit separately. Predictably, the KKK attacked the Koinonia Farm and even attempted to set it on fire. The white-controlled society in the south persecuted them, both legally and physically.\n\nYou may not be familiar with the Koinonia Farm, as I wasn’t until this week. Surprisingly, it still exists today and has made a significant impact on American history. You may have heard of “Habitat for Humanity,” which was started by members of the Koinonia Farm. Additionally, the Civil Rights Movement in the South, which owes much to the courage and faith of Clarence Foster and his community, likely wouldn’t have happened without their influence.\n\nRecently, I listened to a recording of a talk given by Clarence in the 1950s. He mentioned that the early Christians were more than just a church; they were a movement. Their belief system, known as “The Way,” was something Clarence believed the Christian community lost as it began acquiring property, buildings, and possessions. For Clarence, The Way couldn’t remain stagnant. It was a road we travelled together, a stream that constantly flowed forward. Therefore, concretizing The Way of Christ Jesus into a building or program is impossible. The Way is defined by its movement, adaptability, and practice of fellowship.\n\nLast week, while looking at some maps, I stumbled upon an online version of the 1880 Meacham Atlas of PEI . I intended to locate the whereabouts of our churches during that time. Naturally, Central didn’t exist then; it was constructed in 1928 after church union. The congregation at Central originated from the Presbyterian church, possibly the one in Marshfield. (I’m still trying to find the Pleasant Grove church on the map, which was initially Methodist.) However, I did manage to find the Methodist Chapel in York, as well as our two churches in Stanhope and St. James.\n\nThis led me to ponder the following question: if we were to fly over the landscape of the pastoral charge area today, what would we see? Well, we would observe four distinct church buildings, much like what the 1880 Meacham Atlas depicts. But I wonder, what does the map of our resurrected community look like? Where do we witness not just a church, but a movement? Where do we perceive not simply a program, but the “Way” being lived out by a community committed to practicing Koinonia, or “fellowship”? It does exist, in a manner similar to the early church—not always flawless in form, but nevertheless undeniably authentic. Every week, Margaret, myself, and others experience this sense of Koinonia during choir practice on Wednesday and Thursday. As we make final selections and rehearse the hymns we’ll sing on Sunday, laughter and genuine fellowship are never absent.\n\nThroughout this week, I had a validating experience of Koinonia when someone from our congregation reached out to me with concern. I was able to extend care and support on behalf of our community to an elderly gentleman who had not attended worship with us since before the pandemic. He had recently lost his son to cancer. And he was deeply moved and appreciative that our community had extended Koinonia to him in fellowship.\n\nSo, Koinonia does exist among us, but the pressing question is: how do we enhance it? How do we make it even more pervasive and central to our identity as a community of the Resurrection? As we celebrate during this Easter Season, let us consider the significance of Hallelujah and Hosanna! Yes, Jesus is risen, but so what? What does that mean to us? How do we honor the call of fellowship, as illustrated by the early Christian community and exemplified by the brave actions of individuals like Clarence Jordan? How do we embrace Koinonia, fostering equality, compassion, and communal stewardship? Together, let us endeavor to embody the resurrected community, placing Koinonia at the core of our identity and mission as we progress forward along the Way together.\n\nThanks Dale & Huw Lewis for help with pronunciation ↩\n\nClarence Jordan Tells The Koinonia Story ↩\n\n1880 Meacham Atlas of PEI ↩\n\nRate this:\n\nMatthew 28:1-15\n\nThat night, near the Damascus Gate, under the shadow of Skull Hill, everything changed. I was there, just as I had been ordered, standing guard outside the tomb where they had laid him. It was a new moon, so it was very dark. I couldn’t see them, but I could smell the scent of passion flowers that grew in this area of Jerusalem. The air seemed heavy and humid, weighed further down by what had happened on Golgotha and my role in it. I was overwhelmed with despair and burdened by a deep sense of guilt. I realized that I had been used as a tool by the Roman state to inflict harm upon an entire people, much like I had used a nail to cause agony and pain to those I had put to death.\n\nIt was around midnight when I finally fell asleep, drifting into a dream of my home in Sicily. In the dream, I found myself sitting with my mother on top of a hill in Agrigento, watching the sun sink below the horizon. Curiosity got the better of me, and I asked her, “Mater, how can we be sure that the sun will rise again? What if darkness stays with us forever?” In response, she smiled and said, “Lucius, darkness may come, but it will never stay forever. The Sun God, Sol Invictus, the invincible, always returns—even after the darkest nights.” Suddenly, I was jolted awake by a deep rumbling, accompanied by the shaking of the ground beneath me. Fissures began to form in the earth. The tombstone had shifted, partly exposing the interior. Without hesitation, myself and my fellow guards, Caius and Leo, rushed over to the tomb, squeezed our way through the entrance and looked inside. Although the burial cloths remained, the body was nowhere to be found. Caius anxiously questioned, “What shall we do now?” Thinking quickly, I replied, “We must make our way into the city and report the missing body.” Leo chimed in, suggesting, “Perhaps his disciples have taken it.” I responded and cautioned him against making assumptions, “We cannot jump to conclusions. You two will head into the city and make a thorough report, while I remain here to safeguard the area.”\n\nThey followed my instructions and left me alone on the ledge where the body had been placed. Lost in deep thought, I sat there for a while, reflecting on the bewildering sequence of events that had transpired recently. The cold gradually seeped through, prompting me to retrieve the robe from my bag and wrap it around myself. Strangely enough, this very garment, for which I had gambled on Golgotha and reluctantly accepted, serving as a constant reminder of my guilt and shame, now brought me solace and a glimmer of hope.I made my way back to the entrance. As I stepped out, the sun was rising over the horizon, and its light was breaking through the trees, dazzling my eyes. About 20 yards away, I could see a man walking in my direction. I presumed him to be the gardener. We walked towards each other. When we met, I asked him, “Did you feel the earth shake?” “Yes,” the man said, “I felt it. I’m inspecting the graves and tombs to see if there was any damage. This one behind me was,” I said, “the stone rolled from the entrance and the body is gone.” He looked at me, nodded, and smiled. Then he said, “In the garden, growth has its seasons. First comes spring and summer, but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and summer again . “I don’t understand,” I said. “You will,” he replied. Then he said, “I’ll take a look at that tomb entrance.” “Very well, peace be with you, my friend,” I replied. Then he said, “And to you, may you find peace in your heart.”\n\n“May you find peace in your heart.” Those were the exact words Jesus spoke to me when I encountered him at the temple grounds the previous week. At first, I considered it a mere coincidence. However, at that moment, an indescribable wellspring of hope surged within me. Thinking on the gardener’s words, the recent events, and the empty tomb, I felt an overwhelming sense of hope emerging from deep within my heart. It was as if the darkness which had enveloped me was being dispelled by the dawn of a new day. Later on, I learned from Jesus’ disciples that he always proclaimed that when he was lifted, he would draw all people to him and rise again after being crucified. I was undeniably drawn to him, and in my heart, I firmly believe that he was and still is alive. He became my resurrected Lord. Consequently, soon after that encounter, I left the army, delivered the robe to Peter—the fisherman, and returned to Sicily. It has been challenging for me to live as a Christian within a Roman world. Still, after three decades, reflecting on that transformative experience, I now see the grace that has entered my life since that fateful day at the tomb with clarity. The weight of guilt that once burdened me has been replaced by a profound sense of forgiveness and redemption. This light continues to radiate within my heart, illuminating my path with love and compassion.While the memories of my past actions may never completely fade away, I find comfort in the knowledge that I am no longer defined by my mistakes. Instead, I embrace the grace that has been extended to me, knowing that the sun will always rise again, bringing with it the promise of a new beginning. In the shadow of Skull Hill, amidst the despair of betrayal, a dawn broke within me. As the sun rose over that empty tomb, I found hope in the words of a gardener and the memory of a risen Lord. Let us embrace the promise of renewal, forgiveness, and redemption. Jesus says to all of us, “Rise with me, embrace the light, and let love guide our way forward.”\n\n1 Movie: Being There, Chance the Gardener\n\nMovie: being There, Chance the Gardener ↩\n\nRate this:\n\n[John 19:17-30]\n\nWhy did I keep this?

But I’m afraid that it has cost me far dearer than I’ll ever receive for it. This time, I just can’t seem to get the images out of my head. I don’t understand. I must have done over 70 executions by now. “Futuo!” Why, during the rebellion, we crucified so many Jews that the Samaria road to Jerusalem was lined with their crosses. Maybe this one today was the one that was one too many. Doing that to a person does something to you as well, it changes you, it wounds you. I’m sure that’s why Brutus killed himself last year; he couldn’t take the pressure off that violence any longer. You know, I didn’t volunteer for this. I was assigned this job as a punishment for being absent from my cohort.\n\nSo there I was, waiting with my tools on Golgotha when the other men arrived with the prisoners. Tullus led them up the hill, and he shouted out to me, “Hail Lucius! It’s been a while since we did one of these together. But never mind, we have his belongings here, a fine robe. We can play tesserae dice for it.” “I’m not interested, Tullus. Let’s just get this over with. I’d rather not be here.” “Same here, Lucius, but remember, ‘Si non ades, non accipis spoilia.’ ‘If you’re not there, you don’t get the swag.’They brought three prisoners to the summit of Golgotha. The last one in line was a mess. He’d been flogged badly, and they had twisted together strands of the euphorbia bush and pressed the thorns into and around his head. “What the hell did he do to deserve this, Tullus?” I asked. “He got a bit too high and mighty for himself, Lucius. Claimed he was the King of the Jews. See the sign here, says it in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, ‘King of the Jews.’ So, you can nail that up once you’ve put him up there.” That’s my job, you see, the hammer and nail man, and I was quick and efficient at it too.\n\nI looked into the face of the prisoner, who returned my gaze. At that moment, I was startled and shaken. “Futuo, Tullus, I don’t believe it!” “What’s the problem?” he asked. “I’ve met him before, Tullus, a few days ago near the entrance to the temple. I warned him then that there was trouble in the city. Well, it looks like trouble has found him,” said Tullus. “But Tullus, he was only looking for his father!” “Come on, Lucius, we have a job to do.” They laid the man naked on the cross support. I knelt beside him with my tools. “He wished me peace, Tullus, and look now what I’ve brought upon him.” I placed the nail over his thin wrist and raised my mallet. I looked down at him and said, “I’m sorry.” He said only one word, which was barely heard, “Peace.” I struck with my mallet.After that, while the three men were dying, we gambled with tesserae dice. I didn’t want to, but Tullus said it would stop me from moping. It’s how this all came to me. After everything had ended, the two thieves were left hanging, while we took the man of peace down. He was to be buried in a tomb near the Damascus gate. “Come on, Lucius,” Tullus said, “let’s go and get drunk and try to forget about today.” “Forget?” At that moment, I knew I would never be able to forget. How could I erase the memory of this man whom I sensed was good, just, and full of peace? His face somehow reminded me of all the faces I had lifted and fastened onto wooden crosses. They all seemed to merge into this one face. I felt overwhelming shame. “Come on, Lucius,” Tullus shouted, “don’t mope over it all day. Give up the moody brooding.” “I can’t come, Tullus,” I replied. “I’ve also been ordered to guard his tomb.” “Do as you wish, or as you must, Lucius,” Tullus said.\n\nAs I descended the hill of Golgotha, a conversation I had with my mother many years ago on another hill among the olive groves in our home in Agrigento, Sicily came to mind. I was just ten years old at the time. I asked her, “Mater, what does my name mean?” “Your name, Lucius? Well, it means light. Lucius of the light.” But today, in my shame and guilt, all I felt was a deep, suffocating darkness. The man of peace had radiated light, but I, Lucas the extinguisher of light, had snuffed it out. “Why did I let this happen? What am I supposed to do with this robe of shame?”\n\nAt some point in our lives, we all carry a “robe of shame”. This robe can symbolize various aspects of our lives such as guilt, regret, or the responsibility for past actions or choices that have harmed ourselves or others. It can represent moments of betrayal, selfishness, prejudice, or indifference. Ultimately, it encompasses any aspect of our lives where we feel the weight of our mistakes or shortcomings, leading us to reflect on our actions and seek forgiveness, redemption, and transformation. However, in Christ, we find forgiveness regardless of the extent of our sins. The voice we hear from the cross is, “May you have peace in your heart.”\n\nRate this:\n\nNumbers 21:4–9\n\nJohn 3:14–21\n\nJoseph Campbell once said, “Where you stumble, there lies your treasure, and the very cave you are afraid to enter will become the source of what you are looking for.”\n\nDid any of you ever watch Batman when you were kids? I loved watching that series, especially the Batmobile! I used to imagine myself driving it, zooming out of the Bat cave at high speed. To be honest, I thought Robin was a bit silly with his costume and his weird expressions like “holy fireworks” or “holy jelly moulds,” etc. But Batman was definitely cool! Have you ever wondered why he wore a bat costume? I think it had something to do with the fact that most people are afraid of bats. Mice are cute, and birds can be as well, but when you put them together, and they become a bat, that’s an entirely different thing! I would imagine that most of us would have a revulsion towards bats, and I certainly do! In the 2005 movie “Batman Begins,” director Christopher Nolan explores the origins of Bruce Wayne’s identification with bats. He tells the story of young Bruce, when he was about seven, he fell down into an empty well and broke his arm. While he was lying there at the bottom of the well in complete darkness, hundreds of bats started to swarm around him. The young boy was terrified. But over time, maybe with some therapy, Bruce was able to move beyond that traumatic memory. In later years, becoming Batman was his way of facing that which he feared the most.\n\nThis is kind of what happens in the story from Numbers. Moses erected a representation of the venomous snake, the very thing that had caused fear, pain, and death to the people. He put it squarely in front of them and said, “This is what you need to look at to be healed.” That idea, I believe, is further reflected in the Gospel reading. Jesus was having a conversation with Nicodemus. He explained to him, just as the serpent was lifted in the wilderness, to heal the people, so when the Messiah is lifted on the cross, he will heal and bring life to all who put their trust in him. However, the cross is something that we may not want to think about or look at too closely. I know this to be true: it’s a key reason why so few people attend church on Good Friday compared to Easter Sunday. Good Friday evokes feelings of pain, fear, and sadness. It’s difficult to go to that place because it connects with our pain, fear, and hurt.\n\nIn our story, the people of Israel have been traveling through the desert for many years. By this point, they have walked their way through the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and are now halfway through Numbers. They complain about the long journey, lack of water, and the desert heat. They also complain somewhat illogically about the lack of food and yet dislike the manna, which God provides for them daily. After years in the desert, they have succumbed to a “back to Egypt thinking.” Life has become so difficult that they are considering returning to Egypt as slaves rather than endure the hardships of freedom where they are always hungry, thirsty, and hot. Typically, when the people of Israel had a complaint, they went to Moses, who negotiated with God on their behalf. However, in this case, for the first time ever, they went around Moses and complained directly to God. As the saying goes, “be careful what you wish for!”\n\nThis passage is difficult to read because in the story, when the people rebel, God sends venomous fiery snakes that kill many of them. The idea and image of God punishing the people like this is disturbing. It portrays God as vengeful. However, it’s important to understand that the ancient people who told these stories believed that misfortunes in life occur due to sin and are punished by God. While most people today rightly reject this notion, it was prevalent in ancient times. The snakes had likely always been in the wilderness, while the people wandered through it for forty years. It’s possible that at some point, someone disturbed a nest of serpents, provoking an attack that resulted in snakebites. The truth is, nature can sometimes be dangerous.\n\nSo, the people were suffering from these snakebites, and God instructed Moses to make a bronze or copper snake and fasten it to a pole, lifting it up for the people to see. If they focus their attention on the bronze snake instead of their wounds and bites, they will be healed and live. Preacher Grace Imathiu reflects on Moses’s reaction to God’s command to create a copper snake. She imagines Moses would have taken a copper bowl or similar vessel and cut it into a long strip. He would then have hammered it into the shape of a snake, attached it to a pole, lifted it high, and called the people to avert their gaze from their snakebites. They were to look instead at the bronze snake to be healed, turning their attention away from the welts and wounds on their arms and legs.\n\nI have been involved in a book study on Julian of Norwich , a 14th-century mystic who lived in Norwich, England. During a severe illness that nearly resulted in her death, a priest held a wooden crucifix in front of her and encouraged her to confess her sins. In the midst of dying, Julian had a vision. It seemed as though she saw past the wooden crucifix, into the actual scenes of the crucifixion. She became, in essence, an eyewitness to the suffering and death of Jesus. Her depiction of Jesus’ horrific wounds, the crown of thorns, the flogging, and the impact on his physical body is challenging to read and comprehend. Julian’s descriptions have the graphic quality that would have made her an excellent screenwriter for the movie “The Passion of the Christ.” Her writing was so vivid and visceral. I only watched “The Passion of the Christ” once, vowing never to see it again! In both Julian’s writings and the movie, I wanted to turn away. And it struck me that I’m reluctant to look too closely at the cross because I would rather not see Christ’s torn body, but also I’m reluctant to look at other depictions of human suffering. I want to avoid watching news coverage of the devastating impact on people’s lives in Gaza. One particular video clip remains etched in my memory: a three-year-old child, covered in dust, sitting on a hospital bed, trembling in shock after losing their family in a bomb explosion. This single image encompasses the tragic reality of Gaza for me. However, we have a natural inclination to turn our eyes away from the wounds of others because those sights disturb us.\n\nBut this week, as we finished our assigned reading called “Flowing Blood,” which was even more visceral and gruesome than the previous chapters, I came to a more profound understanding. The suffering, fear, and terrible wounds displayed on the cross represent the things that have frightened or hurt us the most in our lives. They are the parts we struggle to remember or confront. We tend to turn away from those painful experiences and memories. However, by turning away from our pain, we also turn away from the suffering of others. Julian of Norwich, by observing Jesus’ torn and bleeding body, gained a deeper comprehension of God’s incredible sacrificial love, which was revealed on the cross. She writes,\n\n“The precious plenty of his dear worthy blood descended into Hell and delivered all that were there who longed for the court of Heaven. ”\n\nAs Joseph Campbell wrote, it is by descending into the abyss that we find the treasures of life.”\n\nIn Bermuda, we do not have snakes, although some people have accidentally brought them to the island. However, we do have a centipede, which can grow up to 6–8 or even 12 inches in length. Its sting can be quite unpleasant, although rarely fatal. I remember as a child walking along the road from Fort St. Catherine’s to Tobacco Bay, where we used to go swimming. On the way, we would pass a small café. In the café window, there were several jars of alcohol containing dead centipedes. I would always stop and gaze at them with fascination. These repulsive insects were kept safely in their jars, but I could not understand why anyone would display such creatures in the front window of a café. It made me question why anyone would even want to eat there. However, someone once told me that the alcohol from one of those jars could cure a centipede sting. This is just one example, among many, of venom becoming an antidote.\n\nThe venom that we fear the most often holds the potential to heal us and our broken world. The pain we carry within ourselves and the pain in the world are exposed and nailed to the cross. During Lent, as we move towards Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice, we are specifically urged to look up at the cross. We should examine what is nailed there, our pain and the pain of others. We should also consider God’s pain and sorrow for our world. However, behind all of this, as Julian of Norwich discovered, lies sacrificial love and abundant, eternal life.\n\nGod calls us to confront our fears and wounds, urging us to gaze at the crosses in our lives and the broader world. By facing discomfort, we uncover the transformative power of sacrificial love and the promise of eternal life, reflecting the profound lessons these two passages teach us. It encourages us to not shy away the venomous aspects of life, recognizing that they can ultimately serve as antidotes for healing and repairing our broken world. As we journey through Lent, we are encouraged to lift our eyes to the cross, acknowledging the profound depth of God’s love amidst suffering.\n\nJoseph Campbell ↩\n\n“Batman Begins,” directed by Christopher Nolan ↩\n\nGrace Imathiu: A Sermon for Every Sunday ↩\n\nEmma Pennington: At the Foot of the Cross With Julian of Norwich” ↩\n\nThe Passion of The Christ: Directed by Mel Gibson ↩\n\nEmma Pennington: At the Foot of the Cross With Julian of Norwich” ↩\n\nJoseph Campbell ↩\n\nRate this:\n\nJohn 2:13—22\n\nWell, here I am again at the place where it all happened when everything changed. I come here for a walk sometimes, just to remember how things used to be and to recall what life was like back then in the old days. I still find it difficult to believe that where I’m now standing was once a magnificent temple. It took 46 years for Herod to build it, and just a few weeks for the Romans to destroy it. It was truly a sight to behold in those days. As you approached Jerusalem from the east, it gleamed and dazzled in the distance. This is one of the coins from that very day when my life was turned upside down. It’s a temple shekel. I’ve always kept it with me as a souvenir, a remembrance of the day when he came here. Come on, I’ll show you around, give you the grand tour, so to speak, but now without the grandeur. I should introduce myself. My name is Yehuda (Juda) HakasPi (Juda of the silver, or, of the money). The HakasPi comes from the Hebrew word (ceseph), silver, like this coin.\n\nWell, it was right here, I remember where I used to sit every day. You can still see what’s left of the old gate pillar. My table was near the entrance to the court of the Gentiles, well, a court is what this used to be before it was all destroyed. Now it’s just a desolate wasteland, mostly rubble. The great temple stones were knocked down and carted away by the Romans, to help fortify the city walls. “Not one stone was left on another,” as they say now. Yes, I remember those days so clearly. HakasPi is my name, Ceseph’s my trade, I would call out (silver name, silver trade, you see?). I would say to the pilgrims entering the temple precincts, “Believe me, you can’t get a better rate for your shekels anywhere in Jerusalem.” Well, that was a lie. I had a silver tongue as well, and I used to make a good living exchanging Roman denarii for temple shekels.\n\nNow, you’re not from around these parts, are you? So, I’d better explain. You see, pilgrims came to the temple from all over Israel to make a sacrifice to the Lord. And the sacrifice had to be a pure and unblemished animal. A sheep or a bullock, or if you were poor, a pigeon would do. But imagine having to travel all the way from places like the Jordan, Capernaum, or Nazareth with an unblemished animal, even a pigeon. You had to feed it on the journey, so it probably wouldn’t be unblemished by the time you got to Jerusalem! So, the temple helped the pilgrims by selling the animals right here in the court of the Gentiles. But you couldn’t buy the animals with Roman denarii, which were the coins used all over Israel. You see, the denarii had Caesar’s head on it, so it was considered unclean and wouldn’t be allowed inside the inner temple, only in the court of the Gentiles. So, what we used to do as money changers is to take the pilgrims’ dirty denarii and exchange them for nice clean shiny temple shekels, and then charge a percentage for the service. Money changers had to live too! And I lived well. After 10 years at this, I had a big house and my own olive grove just outside the city walls.\n\nBut that all came to an end the day He arrived in Jerusalem. It was the Passover. I remember when hordes of people from all over Israel entered the city. I used to make more profit on Passover than any other time of the year. You see, there were thousands of people buying animals who needed to convert denarii into shekels. On Passover, we all used to put our rates up, both the sellers of animals and especially us money changers. So if someone was buying a bullock which was normally 8 shekels, well on Passover, the price went up to 10 shekels. And then, moreover, my regular exchange fee of 10% went up to 20%, just during these holidays, mind you! I would make 2 shekels on every 10 for someone buying a bullock. I gave the poorer pilgrims a bit of a break and only charged them 15% instead of 20. After all, they were just buying a little pigeon. But it was quite a set-up, I can tell you. The money was rolling in, and the people coming to the temple were so emotional and filled with religious fervour, they weren’t paying attention to practical matters like denarii and shekels and the rate of exchange. We took care of that worry for them. And I can tell you, it was a racket in more ways than one. It was noisy and chaotic: imagine all the animals, some of them terrified, baying and crying loudly as they were being led off to slaughter. There was the smell of blood and all the other things as well. Well, it was noon, and I was just about to count up what had come in that morning when he walked through the gate. He passed my station, then over towards the far side of the court where the oxen and sheep were kept. There were some other men with him, poorly dressed and looking around in wonder at the magnificent temple walls with their colorful tapestry hangings. But their leader looked angry, I mean furious. Suddenly, he started shouting something. I couldn’t hear from where I was, but I noticed that he grabbed some cords of rope from one of the animal stalls. He twisted them together and started striking at the animal keepers. It was pandemonium! Soon there were sheep, oxen, all breaking out from their stalls and charging towards the entrance. I had to jump out of the way, so I wasn’t trampled. Then he came quickly, striding towards me! I didn’t know what to do. As he came up to my table, he took it and flipped it over on its end. There were shekels and denarii spilling all over the ground. And he looked at me and said, “Do not make my Father’s house a house of trade.” I was terrified! I didn’t know what to say, think, or do! I’d never seen anyone look so infuriated before, and I can tell you, I’ve seen many angry people in my life. And I saw as well that there were tears coursing down his cheeks. Then he stooped and picked up one of the shekels from the ground (it was this one). (Pause) He looked right at me and said, “Follow the commandments of the Lord.” Then he said, “Yehuda HakasPi, your life is worth more than this!” and he handed me this shekel. I was stunned. I just took the coin, left the rest of the money lying on the ground, and I walked home shaking. It was only then that it occurred to me that he had never met me before, but he knew my name.\n\nWell, after that, I tried a few times to go back to work at the temple, but I just couldn’t do it any longer. I kept thinking of his words, “Follow the commandments.” You see, I had broken them. The commandments say, “You shall not steal,” but I had stolen, and I had taken from those who were the most vulnerable. The commandments say, “You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below,” but I had made money my idol.\n\nThe stories of that day were shared by people for many years afterward. They say he was a prophet. I believe he was. His followers later remembered that it was written in the scriptures, “Zeal for the Lord’s house will consume him.” Well, that’s true as well. I experienced his zeal, and his zeal did consume him because a few years after that Passover Day in the temple, on another Passover, he was killed by the Romans outside the city walls. I heard that day when he was confronted by the temple leaders demanding a sign for his authority, he said to them, “Destroy this house and I will rebuild it in three days.” They thought he meant the temple, but he was really talking about himself. Well, as you can see, looking around you, the temple certainly was destroyed. It happened years afterward, consumed in the fire in the war with Rome. But they also say that three days after his death on the cross, the prophet rose again from the tomb. I don’t know if that’s true or whether it’s just a story, but this I do know. My life, just like this temple, was also destroyed. I lost my business, I lost my house, I lost my olive grove. But I have found a whole new life of freedom through my faith, and through living the commandments, and through worshiping the Lord. And I’m still in the silver business! I have a little silversmith’s shop on Shimon Street. I specialize in making amulets of the old temple for those who still go to pray at the only remaining temple wall. I sell them for a fair price if you’re interested. These days, I also try to share what little wealth I have with others. It’s what he asked me to do, and what I try to do now—follow the commandments the Lord gave us so we could be free.\n\nIn our culture, we find the idea of an angry God and an angry Jesus disturbing. After all, a great deal of damage has been inflicted on people by how the church has portrayed a judgmental God over the ages. But truth be said, anger is an emotion, and emotions in themselves are not wrong or sinful. What we do with them can sometimes be wrong. If we push anger down inside us, we do wrong to ourselves. And when we allow our anger to deliberately hurt others, that is also wrong. But the anger of God is Holy Anger. It is anger grounded in grief at the injustice that many people experience in the world. I believe that God is angry about what is happening in Gaza and Ukraine. It’s a grief that God feels deeply, and its anger filled with compassion. In the passage from John, one of the verses refers to Psalm 69: “Zeal for your house consumes me, and the insults of those who insult you fall on me.” The same psalm also says, “I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold; I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me. ” The anger of Jesus is not just anger in itself but anger that is grounded in grief, compassion, and tears for our world. God calls us to have that same compassionate holy anger, to feel the deep waters and the flood which sweep over those who, through the breaking of God’s commandments, are treated with injustice today. But it’s an anger that leads to salvation, as it did for Yehuda HakasPi, as it can do for us and all those we are called to serve in Christ’s name.\n\nAmen.\n\nRate this:\n\nGenesis 9:8–17\n\nJane Ferguson, tells the story of a young mother who was taking a walk with her small son, and they saw a rainbow. The four-year-old boy looked up in wonder, and said, “Mummy, can we take that home and put it in our house?” His awestruck question prompted the mother to write a poem titled “Rainbow in My House.” It imagined the multi-coloured light of the rainbow playing on their walls, emanating from the windows and doors, coming out of the chimney. The house was transformed, and could not contain the glory of the rainbow and its colors. Jane asks a question, “What would we look like, in the light of the rainbow? What would it mean to us to put God’s rainbow in ourselves, and in our community?”\n\nWe all know the story of Noah and the flood. We’ve seen pictures of the ark and the rainbow ever since we were children in Sunday school, or in the nursery. The passage we’re looking at today takes place during the aftermath of the flood, when the ark came to rest on Mount Ararat. There, God established a covenant with Noah, his family, and indeed, with all creation. God made a solemn promise: never again would the world be destroyed by a flood. Normally, in a covenant between two parties, there are obligations and responsibilities on each side. But in this case, the obligations of the covenant are all on God’s side. Regardless of how humankind will behave in the future, God (as one theologian puts it) accepts “unilateral, self-imposed boundaries, limiting how God will respond to human sin, “Never, never, never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.” The story of the rainbow covenant was recorded by the people of Israel, when they were in exile from their homeland, and in the midst of chaos for their community. The rainbow is actually a weapon, a war bow that God had in the story set aside, hanging it up in the sky. It’s as if God was saying, “I’m done trying to force humankind to change the way in which they behave. I need to come up with another plan to redeem them.” The flood had not cleansed the human heart of sin, and God is not expecting our behavior to improve much in the future. Why? Because, as God realizes, “the inclination of the human heart is evil from their youth.” (Note: however, read my next sermon, “Walk Before Me!”)\n\nNow, that’s difficult to hear, isn’t it? Are we really that bad? Are we truly as sinful as that verse suggests, from our youth? But if we’re honest with ourselves, we must admit that there is something within us that is rebellious, ungovernable, and chaotic. A place where unlike God, we don’t intend to respect boundaries of behavior. Reverend Dave Puxley shared a memory with our Bible study group on Wednesday. He recalled picking up his four-year-old son from nursery. As he watched his child sitting at the top of the slide, suddenly, he pushed another kid off the slide, causing them to fall. Later, the child’s teacher asked Dave, “Does your church have a practice of eating rocks?” “Eating rocks? No, of course not!” Dave replied. The teacher explained, ’Well, I caught your son eating gravel at lunchtime, and I told him you can’t do that, you can’t eat gravel!’ but he responded, “Oh, that’s okay, we eat rocks at Daddy’s church!” Dave noted that clearly at that age, there’s very little moral agency in us. I remember when I was about 12, my best friend Paul, who was also my cousin, and I were both in scouts. Each of us had a sheath knife with a 4″ long blade. We used to walk around his neighborhood proudly wearing these knives on our belts. One day, we ventured into Paul’s neighbor’s banana patch. The banana patch transformed into a Vietnamese jungle in our minds, with the banana trees becoming enemy soldiers who needed to be killed. I still feel ashamed of what we did to that man’s crop of bananas. And Last week I was looking at my Twitter feed (now known as “X”). And I was astonished at the number of videos posted on there, of kids at school beating each other up, in corridors & bathrooms, not just boys, but girls as well! I always thought girls didn’t fight, apparently I was wrong about that! Reflecting on my own experience, what I’ve heard and what I’ve seen maybe there’s truth to the verse in Genesis 8:21, “the inclination of the human heart is evil from their youth.”\n\nRudyard Kipling wrote a story called, “Letting in the Jungle.” It is about a group of people who ventured into the jungle, cleared land, brought their livestock, planted crops, and built homes. Initially, it was a paradise. However, when the rainy seasons arrived, the jungle encroached once more. Animals attacked their livestock, and the jungle’s vegetation grew back faster than they could manage. The jungle reclaimed their paradise. Yet, Kipling was not merely discussing the jungle; he was telling the tale of humanity. As Emerson Colaw stated, “Kipling knew how near the jungle lies to the settlements of man, how thin is the veneer of civilization, and how deep the savage in humankind.” There is something in our character that at times grieves the very heart of God. We may attempt to justify or rationalize it, but there is an element of the jungle or the wilderness within each of us.\n\nIn today’s reading from the Gospel of Mark about Jesus’ baptism, even before he had accomplished anything, he heard God’s voice saying, “You are my son, the beloved.” However, immediately after this, some suggest that the spirit in the dove appears to transform into a bird of prey with claws. It drives Jesus out into the desert, where he faces temptation by Satan and dwells among wild beasts. Perhaps, like Jesus, we also need time in the wilderness to tame the WILDerness we carry within us.\n\nJoseph Campbell, the author of “The Power of Myth.” describes how primitive societies established rites of passage for their children to help them become productive members of their communities. During our visit to South Africa in 2012, we spent a week on Safari in Kruger Park. One of the highlights of was meeting the locals, including Alfred Rouleni, who served as our guide during the Safari. We felt safe with him, especially because he always carried a large hunting rifle. One evening, while having a barbecue out in the veld, we were all enjoying our dinner, when we suddenly heard a hyena snarling near the kitchen area quite close to us. Let me tell you, I always thought hyenas were small, sort of like big dogs, but they’re not they’re huge, particularly the females who dominate the species. Alfred calmly instructed everyone to remain still. I remember my fork, loaded with barbecued ostrich, remained suspended halfway to my mouth. Alfred grabbed his rifle and went to investigate the situation, along with the other guides, successfully scaring the hyenas away. Later, he shared with us the traditions of his tribe. He described how young boys, around the age of twelve or thirteen, were sent into the jungle alone, for six weeks as part of their coming-of-age ritual. Having been trained by their tribe on survival skills throughout their lives, this period served as a time to reflect on their knowledge and their identity within the community. It reminded me of the principles behind the 4-H program here in PEI, although not as intense.\n\n’I pledge my head to clearer thinking, my heart to greater loyalty. My hands to larger service. My health to better living, for my club, my community, and my country.\n\nI think this is what our journey into Lent is meant to achieve. It’s essentially a rite of passage through the wilderness that can help us confront our own wild natures. As WM Lloyd Allen writes,\n\nit is those who can travel the rocky road of Lent through the chaos of Good Friday and the silent void of the grave who can hope to see the Easter dawn. Where the light will reveal a rainbow in the dark western sky behind them.\n\nAs we journey through Lent, let us first acknowledge that like Jesus, we are beloved, wrapped in God’s love. Secondly, if we want to give up something for Lent, let’s hang up our bows of war, let’s give up chewing rocks! Let’s reflect inward, confront our untamed nature, and dedicate ourselves to personal and communal transformation. Let’s welcome the challenge, navigate the rough terrain, and emerge into the Easter dawn, where the light reveals a rainbow of hope. Let’s join hands, strive collectively for a community and a world where we embody a covenant of love, a covenant of understanding, and a covenant of service.\n\nJane Ferguson, Feasting on The Word Year B Vol 2, page 26 ↩\n\nWM Lloyd Allen: Feasting On The Word Year B Vol 2, page 28 ↩\n\n↩\n\nRev.

It was called Kung Fu and starred David Caradine. It told the story of a wandering Chinese monk, Kwai Kaine, who immigrated to the United States in the late 19th century. He would drift from one town to another, sharing his Zen Buddhist wisdom, and when required, he would use his martial arts skills to take on and beat the various bullies he encountered. In each episode, his thoughts would invariably go back to the time when he was growing up in a Shaolin monastery, when he was taught by his Zen teacher, Master Po. His teacher’s nickname for Kwai was “grasshopper.”\n\nThough Master Po was blind, he could always surpass his students in the discipline of martial arts. On one occasion, he asked Kwai Kaine to close his eyes so that he could accentuate his sense of hearing. “Do you hear the water running in the stream?” “Yes,” said Kwai Kaine. “Do you hear the sound of your heartbeat? ‘No,’ said Kwai Kaine. ‘Do you hear the sound of the grasshopper at your feet?’ Kwai looked down and there was indeed a grasshopper which had landed there. Kwai Kaine asked Master Po, ‘Old man, how is it, that you could hear the sound of the grasshopper?’ Master Po replied, ‘young man, how is it that you could not hear it?’ The Shaolin master’s words echo with those of Isaiah.\n\n“Have you not heard, have you not been told from the beginning? It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, whose inhabitants are like grasshoppers.”\n\nIsaiah was writing to the people of Israel, near the end of the Babylonian exile. At this point, they were a people without any hope^1. The Israelites had spent years in refugee camps, living from hand to mouth. Now, they were being encouraged to return home, but what was the point? The return from exile was always imagined to be a joyous event, but few wanted to go back to Israel. Jerusalem and its temple had been destroyed years before. There were few walls left standing, there was no work and there was little food. The Israelite people were not clamoring up to go home, they had been away for a whole generation. Most of them would not even have recognized the place. Sure, exile was certainly bad, but returning was equally difficult. These people felt forgotten by God, They believed that they were as small, and as weak and as insignificant as grasshoppers. Insects merely to be trodden down and squashed underfoot. So Isaiah was challenging them with a series of rhetorical questions. Questions which were intended to get their attention so that they might come to their senses. That they might realize that they had fallen into a state of “theological amnesia!” That they had forgotten all about what God had done for them in the past. Isaiah is saying to them, “Hey! Wake up!” Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the very beginning? Have you forgotten God? Have you forgotten that God is always near to you and cares for you, even in dark times like this?”\n\nLike the Israelites, we tend to live a “fair weather” faith. It’s easy to believe in God when everything is going well in life. It’s easy to hope when life is good. But, not easy when everything seems to be going south. Like when you’ve lost your job or when you’ve recently been given that cancer diagnosis. Or, when we’re faced with financial insecurity. When each new day offers no hope for a better future. There are many today who could speak those words written by the prophet, “my way is hidden from the Lord, and my right is disregarded by my god.”\n\nLast week, Elmo, the puppet character from Sesame Street, asked on “X,” the social media platform, “Just checking in, how is everybody doing?” The immediate and considerable response indicated that people are not doing well at all. The multitude of answers to Elmo’s question was a clear indication of the underlying mental health crisis in North America. One person replied to Elmo, “just another day staring into the abyss, Elmo.” Another person wrote, “every morning I cannot wait to go back to sleep. Every Monday, I cannot wait for Friday to come. Every single day and every single week for life!” Someone else wrote, “I’m at my lowest, but thanks for asking.” And another person said, “The world is burning around us, Elmo.” And another, “Wife left me, my daughters don’t respect me. My job is a joke. Any more questions, Elmo? Jesus, man!” Even President Biden replied to Elmo, noting that “life can be difficult and how important it is to support one another!” There were about 205 million views and tens of thousands of responses. Elmo finally replied, “Elmo is glad he asked. Elmo learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing. Elmo will check in again soon, friends. Elmo loves you.” Life is a journey and not always an easy one. And it’s in the challenging and difficult times that our faith is really put to the test, where we have to dig deep to hold onto our relationship with God.\n\nIn verse 31 of this passage, Isaiah writes, “They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength.” Rev. Dave Puxley, ^2 in our online Bible study, explained that the word “wait” in the Greek language, (specifically in the Septuagint version of the Hebrew Bible), is translated as “hupomeno” (ὑπομένοντες). This word carries various connotations; it means to wait, to remain under, but not simply with resignation. Instead, it implies a vibrant hope that generates endurance. “Hupomeno” could also be understood as suffering from ‘seasickness,’ which is definitely not a pleasant experience but requires endurance. However, even in this discomfort, we can find solace in the fact that we are not alone. God is with us on this journey, just as He would be on a vessel, guiding us towards a future where we will rediscover and fully experience God’s grace.\n\nRev. William J Carl III ^3 shares a story about a remarkable woman named Margaret Stevenson, who resided in Tennessee. Despite being in her nineties, Margaret would hike ten to fifteen miles daily in the Smoky Mountains. Rev. Carl reflects on his hiking experiences with Margaret, noting that his first trip up Mt. LeConte was her seventy-fifth, his second was her hundred twenty-fifth, and his third was her five-hundredth. Incredibly, Margaret had climbed Mt. LeConte over 700 times. During one particular hike together, they encountered a challenging two-mile ridge with no breaks. Rev. Carl, who prefers hiking in short bursts, quickly moved ahead while Margaret maintained her steady pace. However, he soon found himself lying on his back, exhausted. Through his haze, he saw Margaret pass by, her cane clicking rhythmically. She encouraged him, saying, “One more mile to go, Bill. I’ll see you at the top!” True to her word, Margaret reached the summit well before Rev. Carl, without ever stopping. Sadly, Margaret’s husband later succumbed to cancer. However, due to her strong faith and daily walk with God, their final hours were filled with joy and celebration rather than sorrow and regret. Margaret’s unwavering focus on Christ, her steady and sure step, and her understanding of Isaiah’s words embodied her profound belief: “But those who wait for the LORD shall renew their strength, they shall mount up with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.”\n\nIn his commentary^4 on this passage, Pastor Todd Weir suggests that Isaiah intentionally chose to use both grasshoppers and eagles as symbols of humanity. Grasshoppers, like eagles, have wings, although they are not as adept fliers. In addition, they have five eyes, which contributes to their adaptability and survival by providing a wide perspective. This ability to see a broader horizon can help us navigate through difficult times and prevent us from becoming solely focused on immediate troubles. Isaiah suggests that, like grasshoppers, we should expand our outlook and acknowledge the vastness of the world.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind ourselves of what Isaiah said, “Grasshopper, have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told to you from the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, through whom we can transcend our challenges and embrace a faith that marvels at the grandeur of the world, lifting us to new heights.” So may we embrace both grasshopper eyes and eagle’s wings in our journey.\n\n[1] Christopher B.

He feels called to the church and the priesthood. And, during the daylight hours he attends Mass prtays his rosary, and tries to live a religious life. But at night Stephen can be found in “Monto,” which is the red light district of Dublin. And he’s doing things that no person should be doing, particularly a young man considering a life as a priest. His conflicted existence drives him one day down to the seashore. As he walks along the beach, deep in thought, wrestling with the implications of the incompatible life he is living, he sees a young woman wading through a stream of water. Her legs are bare, to avoid her skirts getting wet, they are gathered up near her waist. Joyce writes, \"She stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing out to sea, and she seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird.\" Stephen knows in that instant that this girl is a sign, pointing him towards his future. She’s a call to the priestly life, though not, as he first thought, a priest of the church, but a priest of the imagination. Stephen knows now that his vocation is to be a writer of literature. As the episode on the beach closes, he declares. \"I go forth to welcome life, to encounter for the millionth time, to forge in the smithy of my soul, the uncreated conscience of my race.”\n\n\"Portrait of an Artist is an autobiographical novel that, in many ways, mirrors the life of its author, James Joyce.\" I don’t know whether Joyce actually saw a girl on a beach but, something like that epiphany, made him realize that he had to leave his home in Dublin, Ireland and go over to Europe for the remainder of his life. He went into self imposed exile to write stories about his country, stories that are now regarded as the greatest pieces of literature ever written.\n\nJoyce once said that, “when a man is born there are nets flung at him to hold him back from flight, but I sha"
