        "text": "May 15th – 5th Sunday of Easter – God’s People Expanded\n\nI was asked recently what Bible character I most relate to. What would you say? Pete Horlbeck said I preach like John. I would like to think I’m saintly like Mary who shouted for joy when she sung about God using her as God’s vessel to deliver us all. Or obedient like Ruth. Or strong like Samson. Or wise like Deborah. Or tenacious and undeterred like Paul. I am much more like look before you leap, foot in my mouth Peter.\n\nMatthew 14:22-33 says, “Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear. But Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!” Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”\n\nWhen he saw the wind, he was afraid, and he began to sink.\n\nIn Matthew 17:1-8, “After six days Jesus took with him Peter, James and John the brother of James, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. There he was transfigured before them. His face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as the light. Just then there appeared before them Moses and Elijah, talking with Jesus.\n\nPeter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”\n\nWhile he was still speaking, a bright cloud covered them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased. Listen to him!”\n\nWhen the disciples heard this, they fell facedown to the ground, terrified. But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Don’t be afraid.” When they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus.”\n\nPeter, James, and John got an up close look at glow in the dark Jesus, shining in his divinity, so much so that Peter didn’t want to leave. He offers to put shelters up for Jesus, Moses and Elijah. He’s taking the mountaintop experience to a whole new level planning to hang out on top of the mountain permanently, but God with a big, booming voice cut that out. I preached last week on the rising of Tabitha/Dorcas. Peter knows how to do it from watching Jesus heal Jairus’ daughter. Again, Peter gets an up close personal seat to all these events. Though he’s not named, I’m sure Peter was among them fighting over who is the greatest disciple after he shared the Passover meal with him on the night in which he was betrayed because he directly mentioned him by name in Luke 22:31-34, “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.” But [Peter] replied, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and to death.” Jesus answered, “I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.”\n\nBig words. And words that he’s going to have to prove later that night. Later on Luke 22:54-62:\n\n“Then seizing him, they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed at a distance. And when some there had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, “This man was with him.”\n\nBut he denied it. “Woman, I don’t know him,” he said.\n\nA little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.”\n\n“Man, I am not!” Peter replied.\n\nAbout an hour later another asserted, “Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.”\n\nPeter replied, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: “Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.” So it all came true. Boasting in all his pridefulness in front of his fellow disciples, but as soon as he was out in the world, he’s like a dog with his tail between his legs. Giving Peter the benefit of the doubt, he may have meant it at the time. We all do when the boat is rocking merrily along, but when the ship hits the sand all bets are off. When we get a full gulp of adversity all of us quake in our boots. That’s what distinguishes this Peter, the one in our text today, from the one in the Gospel accounts. We see Peter transformed. We see Peter following the leading of the Holy Spirit. We see Peter having a hand in God’s people expanded and we should do the same.\n\nActs 11:1-18\n\nNow the apostles and the believers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God. 2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him, 3 saying, “Why did you go to uncircumcised men and eat with them?” 4 Then Peter began to explain it to them, step by step, saying, 5 “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. There was something like a large sheet coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners; and it came close to me. 6 As I looked at it closely I saw four-footed animals, beasts of prey, reptiles, and birds of the air. 7 I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; kill and eat.’ 8 But I replied, ‘By no means, Lord; for nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ 9 But a second time the voice answered from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not call profane.’ 10 This happened three times; then everything was pulled up again to heaven. 11 At that very moment three men, sent to me from Caesarea, arrived at the house where we were. 12 The Spirit told me to go with them and not to make a distinction between them and us. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house. 13 He told us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and bring Simon, who is called Peter; 14 he will give you a message by which you and your entire household will be saved.’ 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning. 16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ 17 If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?” 18 When they heard this, they were silenced. And they praised God, saying, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”\n\nWe see Peter transformed.\n\nA farmer purchases an old, run-down, abandoned farm with plans to turn it into a thriving enterprise. The fields are grown over with weeds, the farmhouse is falling apart, and the fences are collapsing all around.\n\nDuring his first day of work, the town preacher stops by to bless the man’s work, saying, “May you and God work together to make this the farm of your dreams!”\n\nA few months later, the preacher stops by again to call on the farmer. Lo and behold, it’s like a completely different place — the farmhouse is completely rebuilt and in excellent condition, there are plenty of cattle and other livestock happily munching on feed in well-fenced pens, and the fields are filled with crops planted in neat rows. “Amazing!” the preacher says. “Look what God and you have accomplished together!”\n\n“Yes, Reverend,” says the farmer, “but remember what the farm was like when God was working it alone!”\n\nSimon Peter is long-past questioning his dependence on the Triune God. He understood that he was doing nothing by his own strength, but the power of the Holy Spirit coursing through him. Peter is not the leap before you look, foot in his mouth, disciple who’s full of himself. But he’s fulfilling what Jesus said in Matthew 16:15-18, “He said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.” And Jesus answered him, “Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father in heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.” The gates of Hell will not prevail against the church. Nor against Peter, himself. Remember when Jesus said in the Upper Room where he shared the first Lord’s Supper with the disciples? “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”\n\nThe devil may win a few skirmishes, but he will never win the war, if we surrender to God’s will, God’s calling in our lives. Marianne Williamson in A Return to Love writes, “Until your knees finally hit the floor, you’re just playing at life, and on some level you’re scared because you know you’re just playing. The moment of surrender is not when life is over. It’s when it begins.” Peter had his knees hitting the floor moment and he is forever changed and his faith has been transformed. You see, his friends in Jerusalem, didn’t see his vision in a dream in Joppa, so he lays it out step by step, bit by bit. He doesn’t cow tow or stutter or appear sheepish in any way. He just lays it out there that God’s people, holding the keys to the kingdom, need to be expanded. Underline several times the word need. Peter was exemplifying what Saint Teresa of Avila once said: ‘We can only learn to know ourselves and do what we can — namely, surrender our will and fulfill God’s work in us.’\n\nSo, there in Jerusalem, in the midst of his circumcised brothers, Peter reached the conclusion of his account and humbly asks in verse 17, “If then God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?” After these men heard Peter’s “step by step” explanation and understood that they were complicit in opposing God’s will, “they were silenced.” What a reversal that was to get the Jewish Christians to welcome the Gentile Christians so whole-heartedly that “they praised God, saying, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”\n\nWe see Peter following the leading of the Holy Spirit.\n\nOnly a vision of the Holy Spirit could lead Peter to throw out the customs, what was ingrained in him from birth.\n\nIn his book What’s So Amazing About Grace? Philip Yancey tells of a time when he was giving the children’s sermon. He held up a bag, and pulled a package of barbecued pork rinds for them to munch on. Next he pulled out a fake snake and a large rubber fly, which led to squeals from his young audience. Yancey and a few of the children then sampled scallops.\n\n“Finally, to the children’s great delight,” he writes, “I reached cautiously into the bag and extracted a live lobster. Larry the Lobster we called him, and Larry responded by waving his claws in a most menacing fashion.”\n\nYancey explained to the congregation that Levitical laws specifically forbade everything they had just eaten. No Orthodox Jew would touch any of the contents of his shopping bag. This is why the message in Acts 11:9 is such radical news: “What God has made clean, you must not call profane.”\n\nPeter knew that this would be a stretch to the people in Jerusalem, but he was hoping, he had faith that the same Holy Spirit that drew him to that conclusion, was working in them too.\n\nThe famed Methodist preacher Halford Luccock once published a book of sermons called Marching Off the Map. The title comes from a sermon of his in which he referenced a story from the life of Alexander the Great.\n\nAfter Alexander’s unprecedented string of victories that opened the way for his army to travel from Asia Minor through Persia and into Afghanistan, his generals came to him one day and informed him: “We don’t know what to do next. We have marched off the map.”\n\nThis, says Luccock, is the critical moment of decision, and it doesn’t happen only to world conquerors. Frequently, in life, bold and adventuresome people come across situations in which there is no precedent to guide them.\n\nIn such times we are faced with two choices: turn around and return to the security of what we already know? Or forge ahead, marching off the map? Do Peter and the people of Jerusalem trust the Holy Spirit to lead them into a new way, marching off the map? They all shout a resounding, “ Yes!”\n\nWe see Peter having a hand in God’s people expanded and we should do the same.\n\nRita Snowden tells a story from World War II. In France some soldiers brought the body of a dead comrade to a cemetery to have him buried. The priest gently asked whether their friend had been a baptized Catholic. The soldiers did not know. The priest sadly informed them that in that case, he could not permit burial in the church yard.\n\nSo the soldiers dug a grave just outside the cemetery fence. And they laid their comrade to rest. The next day the soldiers came back to add some flowers — only to discover that the grave was nowhere to be found.\n\nBewildered, they were about to leave when the priest came up to speak to them. It seems that he could not sleep the night before, so troubled was he by his refusal to bury the soldier in the parish cemetery. So early in the morning he left his bed, and with his own hands, he moved the fence — in order to include the body of the soldier who had died.\n\nGrace means we move the fence. Grace means we don’t judge a book by its cover. Grace means we don’t live our lives based on a series of assumptions. But oh my golly, we live to be let into exclusive clubs. We secretly relish being on the “inside” instead of the “outside.” It’s safe on the inside, where you have a certain status and it’s comfortable. It’s hard to welcome the stranger, the people who are different from you, the ones that don’t use the same words, or language. Maybe they don’t speak churchese. But the Triune God demands, demands for us to draw the circle wide. There’s hymn “Draw the Circle Wide” with lyrics by Gordon Light and arrangement by Mark Miller in United Methodist Worship & Song Hymnbook 3154.\n\nGod the still-point of the circle\n\nRound you all creation turns\n\nNothing lost but held forever\n\nin God’s gracious arms\n\nDraw the circle wide, draw it wider still.\n\nLet this be our song: no one stands alone.\n\nStanding side by side, draw the circle, draw the circle wide\n\nLet our hearts touch far horizons\n\nSo encompass great and small\n\nLet our loving know no borders\n\nFaithful to God’s call\n\nIt reminds me of Paul’s words in Galatians 3:26-28 “For in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith. As many of you as were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is no longer Jew or Greek; there is no longer slave or free; there is no longer male and female, for all of you are one in Christ Jesus.”\n\nWe don’t have to hog all the love for ourselves. God’s love is available to all. Our lives can be transformed just like Peter’s. If we ask the Holy Spirit to remove all of the bravado and pride, so that we can follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. Lastly, we can draw the fence or circle wide. Showing the world God’s love every chance we get. Oh, the Holy Spirit, will guide us and lead us where to go, what to say, and how we should say it. Our God loves a good show and tell story, the believers of the Way, surely saw how the Holy Spirit had transformed Peter, and the world will see us transformed little by little, step by step as we walk in the ways of Jesus, showing compassion when we are hurt, speaking words of love and grace, when it’s so easy to offer judgment and angst, and letting our little lights shine in a world that’s constantly seeking to dim and eventually snuff them out. The Holy Spirit used Peter and may the Holy Spirit use us.\n\nI heard a DJ ask people to call in and share their mother’s best advice.\n\n“Whatever you’re doing, make the place better than you found it.”\n\n“The world is full of people all too eager to put you down. Don’t join the chorus and say bad things about yourself, to yourself. Your heart is listening.”\n\n“Never forget your umbrella.” “My mother always used to say this. She meant it literally, and figuratively. For her, and eventually for me, it was about being prepared for whatever life decides to rain down upon your head. I say the same thing to my daughter over, and over again.”\n\n“It’s OK to be shy, but it’s not OK to never try.”\n\n“If you open it, close it. If you turn it on, turn it off. If you take it out, put it back. If you empty it, fill it. If you fill it, empty it.”\n\n“Just because you CAN do it, doesn’t mean you should.”\n\n“Every relationship takes compromise, but don’t push down parts of yourself to make your relationship work. It takes two equal people to be partners, not one person, and one half-person.”\n\n“Always prepare early. Give yourself enough time so you have peace of mind and don’t have to rush.”\n\n“We don’t even know what we don’t know.”\n\n“Do not feed the fears.”\n\nWhat say you, what advice did your mom’s or mother figures give you?\n\nJessica Larijani, SUCCESS director of digital content, writes, “My mom puts her whole heart into everything she does. For my sisters and me. For my family. Her friends. Even strangers. I admire her for so many things, but especially her generosity.\n\n“I know what she’s doing right now without asking: sewing. She started as soon as there was a need and she hasn’t stopped since. She is part of a mask brigade making and donating protective wear to health care workers and first responders. She’s sewn almost 500 masks since the start of this pandemic, and I know she’ll keep going as long as there are requests.\n\n“My mom’s mission has always been to help others, and her selfless dedication to that has shown me that nothing matters quite like giving kindness. Our actions leave an impact, and we can all make a difference in this life if we just choose to look for the opportunity to help.”\n\nOur actions in this life leave an impact, not only on our children, but on everyone around us.\n\nActs 9:26-43\n\n36 Now in Joppa there was a disciple whose name was Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was devoted to good works and acts of charity. 37 At that time she became ill and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in a room upstairs. 38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, who heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him with the request, “Please come to us without delay.” 39 So Peter got up and went with them; and when he arrived, they took him to the room upstairs. All the widows stood beside him, weeping and showing tunics and other clothing that Dorcas had made while she was with them. 40 Peter put all of them outside, and then he knelt down and prayed. He turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up. 41 He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he showed her to be alive. 42 This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 43 Meanwhile he stayed in Joppa for some time with a certain Simon, a tanner.\n\nWhat is grief, but love made real? I wrote that line down when we first watched Marvel’s WandaVision. We binged it all over again on Friday in preparation for watching Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness and I wrote it down again. What is grief, but love made real? Luke, the author of the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts, the account of the early stages of the Way, known today as Christianity, cites one such story about a mighty woman who had died and as Jessica from SUCCESS magazine said, Dorcas put her heart in everything she did and she was loved and cherished in return.\n\nSo what is happening in our text today? What lessons does it have to teach us? They carried her body to an upper room of her house. Nowadays, the scene is often played out in a funeral home, a chapel, a sanctuary, or at a graveside.\n\nThe grieving friends of Tabitha, or Dorcas in Greek because Luke realized this story would be told to both Jews and Gentiles, are gathered to­gether in her home. She must have died recently, for she hadn’t been buried yet.\n\nAs the sad news spreads through town, her friends and loved ones come and pay their respects. I would imagine the initial conversations at the door are all essentially the same. “I just heard the news.” “I can’t believe it!” “How did it happen?” “Was anyone with her?” “She was such a wonderful person!” The same questions that we would ask.\n\nMy grandparents all had large families and I remember funeral homes a lot as a kid. The whole family gathered with all the drama and hijinks that comes with whole families gathered. It gave us a chance to see aunts, uncles, and cousins we wouldn’t see until next Thanksgiving or Christmas. It gave us a chance to see family we don’t normally see. It gave us a chance to see the children and the grandchildren of the people that our grandparents’ talked about. It gave us a chance to share memorable or poignant or funny stories of loved ones and when we were younger to play hide and seek or tag in our funeral clothes until inevitably we were told to stop. But one time something peculiar happened. All of us in the family would each dutifully walk up to the casket, pay our respects, and make a mad dash to the couches and wing-backed chairs over in one of the side rooms. One time, my dad and his two brothers walked out of the viewing room with quizzical looks on their faces. They each took another pass looking at their aunt’s face. Something was definitely wrong and they couldn’t figure it out. I don’t know who noticed first or who said it first, but one of them said, “Aunt blah-blah-blah, is smiling! She never smiles.”\n\nThat certainly was not the case with Tabitha. Aunt blah-blah-blah, to protect the innocent, may have lived a life “devoted to good works and acts of charity.” I don’t know if what my dad and uncles said was right because I was little. However, Dorcas certainly was devoted to good works and lived love as the growing crowd of grieving friends and neighbors attest. They reminisce together, sharing their favorite stories of Dorcas. With­out the help of videos or pictures, they have to use their own recollections of her. They don’t have a set time for the visitation like we do now. Instead they share for hours, telling their favorite stories, recalling their happy memories together, trading the tales of her life.\n\nWhile they didn’t have slideshows of pictures to spark memories, they have something even more personal because she made it. They have the things that Tabitha her­self had made. For each one of them.\n\nEvidently this saintly woman was masterful at making clothes. Not just skillful, but generous, as well. Was there a friend or a neighbor who hadn’t received something from her hands? The remi­niscing turns into a lovely sort of show-and-tell as the townspeople bring out the tokens of Tabitha’s kindness.\n\n“She gave this to me for my last birthday,” one woman tear­fully shares, as she holds up a lovely shawl. “She was so thought­ful! She never forgot a birthday, you know.”\n\n“She was always thinking of other people,” another chimes in.\n\n“This robe,” says another woman, drawing attention to the one she’s wearing, “I’m sure she was making this robe for herself. But when I visited one day and commented about how pretty it was, she held it up against me and said, ‘A perfect fit! It’s yours!’ “\n\nOn and on the stories went.\n\nYou and I don’t get to hear those stories and the truth is we don’t know any of Dorcas’ backstory. Scripture doesn’t give us a glimpse of her life up to now. We have no record of any of her words. If we were going to wear our historian hats – the only part of her biography that is preserved for us is this story on this one particular day; and she was dead for most of it.\n\nAnd YET, for all intents and purposes, we feel like we know her, don’t we?\n\nWe feel like we know Tabitha because we’ve all been loved by someone like her. Perhaps it was your grandfather, your aunt, your sweet next door neighbor, a favorite Sunday school teacher, that one camp counselor who was there when you first encountered Jesus and you realized that he died for you. All of those people who loved you into being who you are. Those generous folks who share their love with the world, not just the rich and fancy, but ALL people.\n\nPersonally, I don’t know how many Christmas stockings that my Great Aunt Clair made when we were kids, but I know that I still have mine. She made my mom and aunt long-sleeved denim Winthrop shirts specifically designed for each of them because she was a proud Winthrop alum. She always gave me books that were Newbery or Caldecott Winners for Christmas. I would read every book that I received, mostly the latest Nancy Drew, before I would read those. Sure, they weren’t a fun whodunit mystery, but those “boring” award books taught me lessons that stick with me to this day. I have a whole host of books and quilts and prayer shawls and cross stitch pictures and pottery and a woodworked chair that my grandfather made that I will cherish long after the Saints who have imbued their spirits of selfless goodness and love long after they have gone and I remember the people that made them.\n\nSo it was with Tabitha. The family members, friends, and neigh­bors had all gathered together in her home, clothed and armed with the loving handiwork that she had left behind. Together they oohed and ahhed. Together they reminscised. Together they showed the symbols of her goodness and love to the apostle Peter.\n\nPeter, the leap before he looks, the foot in his mouth, and yet, the rock on which Jesus built his church, had become a pillar of the early church and he was staying in the nearby town of Lydda. He was just a few miles from Joppa where Tabitha had lived. So the Chris­tians there sent word to Peter, urging him to come to Joppa right away.\n\nWhen Peter arrived, he was taken immediately up to the room where the body of Dorcas lay. There he was surrounded by the grieving loved ones, each one with an article of clothing to show him, each one with a story to tell him. Surely Peter was moved by the stories of the mourners. Surely his heart was touched by the good works of love she had left behind.\n\nThen he did something unusual. Peter sent them all out of the room. They hadn’t asked him anything.\n\nHe abruptly told them – all who had gathered – to leave the room. It would have seemed strange to them, he didn’t know Tabitha. He hadn’t heard anything about Dorcas until he came to her house. He’d never even laid eyes on her. I can’t imagine what they whispered to one another as they walked down the stairs, leaving Peter alone in the viewing room.\n\nHe told the people to go because that’s what he had seen Jesus do.\n\nYears before, when Peter and the disciples had chosen to follow Jesus along the dusty roads of Galilee, Peter had been in a similar bedroom. The twelve-year-old daughter of Jairus had died, and the house was full of mourners and Jesus sent them away. Or at least out of the room. Accompanied only by a few disciples and the grieving parents, Jesus spoke to the little girl. And in speaking to her, he raised her to life.\n\nSo, now, the disciple followed the example that he had seen set by his Master, his Rabbi and did the same thing. He sent the mourners out of the room, and then he spoke to the corpse. “Tabitha, get up,” Peter said, and the dead woman opened her eyes. Then she sat up. And then, Peter called all of her friends and loved ones back into the room and you could have knocked them over like a feather.\n\nThey thought she was dead. They are bursting with joy! They can’t believe their eyes! Now they get to say all those nice things TO her, instead of about her. Their grief is turned to love made real in the flesh. They could hug her and she could hug them back.\n\nIt was not Peter’s strength that brought about her healing, but by the Spirit of Jesus working within him and through him and for him. He saw his rabbi do it and he had faith and trust that the Spirit of the Lord would do it again.\n\nPeter stays with Simon, the tanner, but he soon goes on his way, on to the next place where he will stay, where he will preach, where he will heal. He leaves Tabitha, alive and well, in Joppa. She is among the good love works that Peter leaves behind.\n\nEarlier, we caught a glimpse of the good love works that Tabitha had left behind. Tunics, cloaks, robes, shawls. But Peter has his own profound collection. Healed bodies, lives transformed in Christ, and a living Tabitha — these are among the good works that Peter leaves behind.\n\nPeter’s example and Tabitha’s example challenge us. We see what each left behind, and we ask, “What is it that I leave? What is the impact and effect you or I having been in a community, a church, a school, a workplace, a family? What is the good, the love, the mercy we leave behind? A life well-lived?”\n\nWhere Tabitha had been, she left behind symbols of love and generosity, tokens of caring and love. Where Peter had been, he left behind life and health, gladness and rejoicing.\n\nWe don’t have to be an artisan to leave an impact, but as Mary Oliver asks “Tell me what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?” Are you going to live love or are you going to live in fear, anger, and let the root the bitterness creep in?\n\nWe consider the example of Tabitha, and we observe that the good works she left behind remind us of her Lord. Afterall, he is the original artist and he gifted her with the creativity and skill with which she made everything. He modeled for her the love and the generosity that she shared with all of the people in her community.\n\nWe consider Peter and we see that the works he left behind also remind us of his Lord. When we look at Peter, we remember Jesus who sent his followers out in Matthew 10 “to proclaim the good news … Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons. You received without payment; give without payment.” We remember Peter who went about doing good in Acts 10:38 and when Jesus told Peter and the rest of the disciples in John 14 that they would do the works he had done and even greater works. The Holy Spirit was with Peter. And with Tabitha/Dorcas. And it can be alive in us. Helping us leave behind good love works. Giving us the strength, perseverance in the darkness of this world, and the Mighty will to do it, we can point people to our one and only Savior in whom all of our good works are inspired and are from. That’s the best advice of all. We point people to our Savior by our good love works so they can see, feel and know Jesus. Amen.\n\nThe next five weeks are going to take a deeper look at the Holy Spirit at work in the book of Acts. Last week’s lectionary reading was the resurrected Jesus appearing to the disciples in a locked room and breathing on them the Holy Spirit, the ruach, the very breath of God that ignites, sustains and transforms. Call this a 5 week special feature: Ultimate Transformation with Saul and Ananias, A Mighty Woman with Tabitha/Dorcas and Peter, God’s People Expanded with Peter and the Gentile expansion pack, Dreams not Beans with Paul and Lydia, and finally Freedom with Paul and Silas. All leading us toward Pentecost which for all intents and purposes IS the Holy Spirit’s day. Blow, Spirit, blow!\n\nYou know that we have access to the Holy Spirit right here and right now. The Holy Spirit is our advocate and comforter, interceding for us when we don’t have the words to cry out, intervening as a hedge of protection, guiding and leading us to where we should go and even giving us the words to say.\n\nI preached last week upstairs that we serve a show and tell God. God shows us the ultimate transformation when Saul becomes Paul. Saul is high on the hog, a big man on campus, a titan of Wall Street, a superstar of the Jewish faith when he meets Jesus on the road to Damascus. The Lord revealed his plans to a hesitant Ananias who says, yes, Lord, and he gets a firsthand look at what our Lord Jesus can do. The practical point for today is two-fold – if we think we’re too far gone, irredeemable, not worthy or good enough our Jesus loves home improvement projects and if the triune God is telling you do something, no matter how crazy it sounds, we as members of the Way should hop to it! If we follow the Spirit’s leading everything that was lost will be found in the sweet name of Jesus.\n\nActs 9:1-20\n\nMeanwhile Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest 2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. 3 Now as he was going along and approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. 4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” 5 He asked, “Who are you, Lord?” The reply came, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. 6 But get up and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.” 7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless because they heard the voice but saw no one. 8 Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. 9 For three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.\n\n10 Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias.” He answered, “Here I am, Lord.” 11 The Lord said to him, “Get up and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul. At this moment he is praying, 12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight.” 13 But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints in Jerusalem; 14 and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who invoke your name.” 15 But the Lord said to him, “Go, for he is an instrument whom I have chosen to bring my name before Gentiles and kings and before the people of Israel; 16 I myself will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” 17 So Ananias went and entered the house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on your way here, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. Then he got up and was baptized, 19 and after taking some food, he regained his strength.\n\nFor several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, 20 and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “He is the Son of God.”\n\nIf we think we’re too far gone, irredeemable, not worthy or good enough our Jesus loves home improvement projects.\n\nExtreme Makeover Home Edition first made the big home reno transformation scene with, “Move that bus! Move that bus!” Now it’s common place with Fixer Upper, Home Town, Zombie Houses, Love it or List it, and the list goes on. We often get sucked into watching those shows because we want to see the great big transformation – the huge reveal at the end. It’s rare that we see a transformation from sinner to saint as dramatic as that of Saul to Paul. We know that there are stories out there, however and here is one such story. The story of Cain Lackey from Patrick County, Virginia.\n\nCain Lackey was known as the Meanest Man in Patrick County. He was rough and tough. The year was 1892 and Patrick County, Virginia, was a place of dirt fields and mud roads. There wasn’t always enough food. People died because there were no doctors. Some places were almost impossible to get to because of the roads.\n\nFor all that, it was still very beautiful. There were the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, and the music of winding rivers racing over the boulders in their streambeds. In the western part of the county were rich fields and long grasses. There were dairy farms, and orchards so plentiful that the smell of the fruit was like perfume.\n\nTwo ministers, Brother Dove and Brother Elgin, were standing at the edge of a swamp. Down below, a tough, wiry man was digging a ditch. Brother Dove was a revival preacher, new in town, and Brother Elgin warned him about the man who was digging: Cain Lackey, the Meanest Man in four counties.\n\nBrother Elgin proceeded to tell Brother Dove about Cain Lackey, how he could carry a railroad tie the way most men carried a two-by-four, how he could out-wrestle and out-fight anyone else who’d ever passed through. And he told him about the famous fight against a man known as Champion Ben, who he’d laid flat with a single punch, and how it had required twelve men to pull Cain Lackey off the former champion.\n\nBrother Elgin also told him about the man’s father, who kept him from school, worked him from dawn to dusk, made him sleep outdoors all summer long, and how Cain had built a working mill by himself at the age of ten.\n\nNo one could level another man with his fist like Cain. No one was stronger or meaner. “Well, he certainly looks like the strongest man in the county,” Brother Dove said, watching the way Cain Lackey thrust his shovel into the swamp, and sent great clouds of mud into the air behind him.\n\n“I’m going to invite him to the revival,” Brother Dove said suddenly.\n\n“He’ll never come,” Brother Elgin said.\n\n“He’ll definitely never come if we don’t ask him,” Brother Dove replied.\n\nBrother Elgin watched as the Brethren minister descended into the swamp. Brother Elgin could see Brother Dove step first ankle deep, then knee deep into the swamp, getting mud and gunk all over him. He watched as Brother Dove stuck out his hand to Cain Lackey. After a moment, Cain took the hand.\n\nA few moments later Brother Dove was walking back to Brother Elgin. Mud clung to his boots and pants.\n\n“What did he say?” Brother Elgin asked. Cain Lackey had already returned to digging. Not much seemed to keep him from work. “He said he’d come. Is he as good as his word?”\n\n“Yes. If he tells you he’ll come he’ll be there. He’s just that way. He’ll do what he tells you. But if he tells you he’ll give you a whipping, he’ll do that, too.”\n\nThat night at the revival, the church was full. People had come from miles around to hear Brother Dove. There were young people and old people. There were children and mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers, and plenty of babies. All the windows were open, and still it was hot, very hot inside, yet no one left. No one wanted to leave, because when someone like Brother Dove came to preach revival it was something special, very special.\n\nThe songs were the sorts of songs that everyone already knew. A sweaty man in the front of the church moved his arms up and down, right and left, to direct the singing, but everyone already knew the songs.\n\nBrother Dove looked out over the congregation, and then he saw, in the doorway of the church, a big man standing. It was Cain Lackey, all right, and he had a child in his arms. He hadn’t thought about it, but he now knew that Cain Lackey was married, and had children. There was a beautiful child in his arms. There was no room for anyone else in the church, but when Cain came in the door, people were afraid of him and made room for him to sit down.\n\nOpening his Bible, Brother Dove began to read, and to talk. It got hotter and hotter in the building, and Brother Dove was dripping with sweat, and so was everyone else. It had gotten dark outside, and it was getting dark in the church as well. He could barely see into the back row, and he wondered, what did Cain Lackey, the Meanest Man in Patrick County, think about what he was saying?\n\nWhen it was time for the closing song, some were crying in the church, and some were squeezing forward so that Brother Dove and Brother Elgin and all the other Brethren ministers could pray for them. Many people were coming forward.\n\nBrother Dove could see a dark shadow, a silhouette of a man, standing at the back of the church. Cain Lackey was standing, but he could see there was no way Cain Lackey could come forward, even if he wanted to. The church was too packed.\n\nAnd then he saw something that surprised him. Cain Lackey was standing on top of a church bench. He was holding a little girl in his arms, and she was fast asleep. This person who was supposed to be the worst person in Patrick County had a little girl asleep in his arms, and he was coming forward by walking on top of the church benches.\n\nThe other ministers stood back as if they were shocked, but Brother Dove welcomed Cain Lackey, and hugged him very tightly, him and his daughter. Then Brother Dove invited Cain Lackey to kneel while they prayed together. All along, the singing continued. Then a cool breeze blew in the window, a breeze that brought relief and comfort.\n\nWhen he was through praying, Brother Dove raised his hands and suddenly everyone was quiet. No one was singing. No one was crying. Everyone was listening.\n\n“Today you have seen a miracle of grace,” he said. “God has called this man to do great things. You will be the ones who will see these things. Welcome this man into our church!”\n\nCain Lackey went on to learn to read and write. He became a minister and built many churches. He was elected to public office and spent tax money to build roads to improve access to rural areas even though it made him unpopular. He worked to provide social services for poor people who had been ignored by other politicians. He smashed stills where he found them. He changed lives. Most of all, he lived a life of grace and service to Jesus Christ. A life transformed.\n\nSaul, much like Cain Lackey, had a reputation of being a very bad man, a big bully like I said in the children’s sermon. Saul was a man to be feared. Saul was very zealous in the Jewish faith. He called himself a Hebrew among Hebrews, so fervent in the faith and traditions of his own people that he stood by and watched over the cloaks of the mob that dragged Stephen off and stoned him to death. Paul himself recalls elsewhere how he was fervent in persecution, determined to eradicate the Jesus movement by any means possible. In Galatians 1:13 he says that he “violently” laid hands on Christians. It was an overall empty life.\n\nSaul’s conversion is the greatest act of transformation in the New Testament. It’s one of those “if he can change I guess I can change” stories that we need to prove that our gospel truly transforms lives.\n\nIf the triune God is telling you to do something, no matter how crazy it sounds, we as members of the Way should hop to it!\n\nGod uses Ananias, an ordinary Christian disciple to heal Saul. This is the only time this particular Ananias is mentioned in scripture except when Paul is giving his testimony in Acts 22:12, “A certain Ananias, who was a devout man according to the law and well-spoken of by all the Jews living [in Damascus].” When the Lord called to Ananias in a vision, he answered, “Here I am, Lord.” After he’s given his instructions, Ananias vocalizes his fears and hesitations. Word on the street was that Saul was evil and he had authority from the Chief Priests in Jerusalem to bind anyone invoke the name of Jesus.\n\nEvery call from God is a personal call. God’s call comes to us person-to-person. It is not a conference call. Some of us respond by putting God on hold. Others of us use call-waiting and take other calls first. Then there are those of us who try to return the call collect – making God pay for calling us. And yet Ananias answered Jesus. He trusted Jesus, even if he may have harbored doubts and fears, and it is to Ananias, not Saul, that the purpose and plan for the new apostle’s life is first revealed.\n\nAnanias follows Jesus’ instructions. The text doesn’t say if he had doubts or hesitancies, but the only way I “out” myself to Saul as a member of the Way with his reputation was to hear a voice from the Lord. And even then…Ananias must have his own real transformation from righteous and respected Jew to faithful follower of the Way. His was a transformation not recorded within the Bible, but he had to have one because he addresses this fearful enemy of his people as “Brother Saul” — demonstrating with his words his trust in the Lord’s transformative abilities. I would love an insight into Ananias thought process as he does the unthinkable. Outing himself as a follower of the Way and being the Jesus’ instrument bringing Saul healing. And while the vision’s words does not make the source of Ananias’ healing ability clear, Ananias himself knows better than to take credit for such a miracle. The Holy Spirit, Jesus’ presence here on earth, is the source of this healing. Saul is no longer an outsider persecuting the church; he is now a true brother in Christ.\n\n“Here I am, Lord.” Ananias’ behavior in this story gives us a game plan for what we should do. God wants Ananias, an ordinary man, a simple disciple, in an act of courage to lay hands on Saul – essentially to make a pastoral call on this terrorist. Here is Ananias’ reaction. Step 1: He answered. Step 2: He confirmed the assignment. Step 3: He went. Step 4: He laid his hands on Saul. Step 5: He affirmed his new family member, when he called him “Brother.”\n\nAnanias understood and lived as a good Jew, who was now a follower of Jesus, a disciple of the Way. Proverbs 3:5-6 which says, “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not rely on your own insight. In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.” He embodied the hymn “Trust and Obey.”\n\nWhen we walk with the Lord in the light of His Word\n\nWhat a glory He sheds on our way!\n\nWhile we do His good will, He abides with us still\n\nAnd with all who will trust and obey\n\nTrust and obey, for there’s no other way\n\nTo be happy in Jesus, but to trust and obey\n\nIf we follow the Spirit’s leading, everything that was lost will be found in the sweet name of Jesus.\n\nLee Strobel once knew the emptiness and lack of direction of living without the Triune God – God, Jesus, and Holy Spirit – in his life. Though he was a successful journalist, by his own account he was not a happy man. He describes himself at that stage in his life as “profane and angry.” To prove his point he cites a time when he came home one night and kicked a hole in the living room wall just out of anger with his life. Can you imagine the impression his conduct made on his five-year-old daughter? But Jesus Christ came into Lee Strobel’s life and changed his life radically. He says that five months after he gave his life to Christ, his little girl went to her mother and said, “Mommy, I want God to do for me what he’s done for Daddy.” Strobel says that God changed not only him, God changed his family and changed his world. When true God-given transformation happens it leaves nothing untouched and changes your whole wide world.\n\nIt was hard to argue with a testimony like that. The scales had fallen off Lee Strobel’s eyes and he could now see both physically and spiritually. Just like Saul. The text says, “Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God.” It was quite the transformation! A week before he had given himself the task with the Chief Priests blessing to round up believers of the Way and today he’s preaching in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. What blasphemy! To those Jewish ears. But what a transformation! A testimony! Saul could sing quite literally, “I once was lost but now I’m found, was blind but now I see.”\n\nHe who was lost, is found, indeed and he’s ready to preach Jesus’ transforming power far and wide. Saul was not irredeemable. Ananias trusts in God’s leading. The result is revival then and now if we show and tell the world as the Spirit leads in the sweet, sweet name of Jesus – the One who has the power to transform our lives."
