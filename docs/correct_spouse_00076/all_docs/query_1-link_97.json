        "text": "I bought a copy of Anna Kate Blair’s debut novel The MoDERN after hearing the author in conversation with Kate Mildenhall at the Beaumaris Library, but I wasn’t sure if I would like it. I knew I would enjoy the exploration of art, architecture and place, and I was intrigued by what was said about how contemporary communication impacts on relationships. But I was wary of Rooney-esque narcissism. I am just not interesting in narratives that involve moaning about nothing much at all.\n\nBut, as it turned out, I loved this book. It concerns Sophia, an Australian woman who has won a Fellowship at MoMA. It’s 2016 and she turns 30 in the course of the novel, which consists of her meditations on art and her favourite artist Grace Hartigan; the institution of marriage in contemporary life; living in New York; and how social media interacts with friendship and love. When she almost-by-accident becomes engaged to Robert, who promptly departs to hike the Appalachian Trail, Sophia finds herself being drawn into the expectations of the wedding industry, personified by her prospective mother-in-law Barbara.\n\nAnd Sophia is just not ready for it. *chuckle* There’s a lot of overthinking that she needs to do first…\n\nI didn’t know how to approach marriage. I didn’t feel excited about it, but I didn’t feel afraid of it, exactly, either, I felt only that I had been asked a question for which I hadn’t studied, and that I might have given the wrong answer. (p.161)\n\nA painting which is referenced many times in the novel is Grace Hartigan’s ‘Grand Street Brides’. For reasons best known to the Whitney Museum of Art, it’s not on display, but you can view it online here. It is relevant because Hartigan’s work interrogates 1950s womanhood and its demands for a certain kind of consumption. The painting is of mannikins in wedding dresses in a bridal shop, but their facial expressions and postures defy expectations because they are not the images that we are used to, when we think of the staged postures and pouts of models from the 1950s.\n\nBarbara takes Sophia to look at wedding dresses, and there are cakes to be inspected. She gives Sophia a list of things to consider, which makes Sophia anxious about seeing Barbara again in case she is asked about something on the list.\n\nI’d bought a dress, but it wasn’t the sort of dress that Barbara would approve. I wasn’t sure, anyway, that a dress was enough. I hadn’t thought about flowers, cakes, venues, dates. I hadn’t thought about music, invitations, guest lists, bridesmaids, table settings. I hadn’t thought about shoes, food, vows, photographers. I wondered if Robert had thought about these things, was expected to think about them. (p.158)\n\nSophia, for whom sexuality is something smudging and subtle, almost liquid, resists labelling. She didn’t want a term at all: she just wanted to ‘exist in all her dimensions.’\n\nLabels hardened things, made them rigid, gave credence to categorisation as an idea. (p.116)\n\nBut she feels queasy when a nearby gay bar is attacked in a hate crime. She realises that it had been people like her, and her friends in Australia, who were the targets, and yet she feels guilty because her relationship with Robert had distanced her from any sense of community based on queerness.\n\nThere’s a hint that there’s something in Sophia’s past that is causing her anxiety and indecisiveness, but her New York crush Cara, doesn’t want to know about it:\n\nCara told me that she didn’t like tragic stories. She was tired of hearing them, felt that women were always exchanging their trauma with one another to create intimacy.\n\n‘I’m sick of being asked to understand people because they’re traumatised. she said. ‘It’s dull. I’d rather hear about beautiful things.’ (p.88)\n\nLater, she is impatient with Sophia’s maundering about the past, and we see the way she pre-empts any response from Sophia:\n\n‘We don’t forget our pasts,’ she said. ‘We just don’t talk about them. But they’re there, in every interaction. Like, you romanticise the idea of forgetting the past, but that definitely says something about your past.’\n\nShe paused. I was about to speak, I think.\n\n‘I’m not interested in knowing what you’re trying to forget, Soph,’ she said. ‘I’m tired of that. Art school’s like group therapy sometimes. I’m not into it. I’d rather talk about, like, actually making art. Or looking at it.’ (p.102, underlining mine)\n\n(You can see from those inserted ‘likes’, that Cara aged 22 (Gen Z) is a different generation to Sophia, (Millennial) and there are times when Sophia feels this eight-year age difference acutely. Cara makes her feel young and carefree, nostalgic for her younger self.)\n\nI was fascinated by the way Instagram mediates this relationship. Sophia starts ‘following’ Cara rather than stealing surreptitious glances, and it’s reciprocal. Sophia stages, takes and posts photos there with full consciousness of Cara looking at them, and she analyses the way Cara is comfortable with her own body in a way that she herself isn’t. But, in one of many brief allusions to the status of her relationship with Robert, she has to remind herself to check his Instagram account, the one she’d made him set up before he left. She finds that his blurry, unfiltered photos make her feel tender, because he’s probably only using Instagram because she asked him to. I find her musings about this hilarious:\n\nHe only had ten followers and one of them was Poughkeepsie Footwear. I played our Fleet Foxes record, sometimes, as I looked at Robert’s pictures, trying to conjure the atmosphere of the Blue Ridge Mountains. I clicked the heart beneath the images to encourage him rather than because I admired their composition. I wished that I was there to take photographs for Robert, to select the details that would best communicate his experiences to those left in cities, like me.\n\nInstagram was something that offered snippets of proximity to my friend’s daily lives, but in Robert’s pictures, I saw a set of strangers and unfamiliar forests. He didn’t appear in the pictures and he left the captions empty, save the occasional #TAclassof2016. It was hard, studying these square, to imagine what it felt like to climb mountains and pitch a tent. I didn’t know what Robert and his new friends talked about around campfires at night. I didn’t know if they were allowed to light fires in Virgina. (p.91-2)\n\nHilarious, but also strange: “I wished that I was there to take photographs for Robert, to select the details that would best communicate his experiences”. Does she realise what a weird wish this is? In one way it’s reinventing him and in another, it’s such a controlling thing to want to do!\n\nAnd then *chuckle* she’s completely disconcerted by the arrival of a letter from Robert. A letter! She doesn’t open it, and again, I pause, because I cannot imagine hesitating to open a letter from the person I loved.\n\nThis window into a different way of thinking about the world, all filtered by social media and the precarity of her circumstances is fascinating. Sophia’s insecurity colours everything about her. Her shelter — an ideal apartment in a big, anonymous city — is hers because she’s with Robert. Her ability to stay in New York where she wants to make her career depends on visa requirements, which are more of a problem if she doesn’t marry her American fiancé. Her ongoing employment in a world of contracts and indifferent employers, doesn’t depend on her PhD or her specialised knowledge because there is no shortage of that at MoMA. How can she know what it is she should offer in her job application?\n\nI kept coming up short to reflect on how there is a whole world of young people out there who think in an entirely different way to the way I do. They have grown up with screens and social media and insecure work, so the way they forge and develop work and personal relationships is a cultural chasm away from my experience. I did know this, intellectually, but I had not comprehended what it is like to judge and be judge by what’s posted on Instagram; what it’s like to conduct correspondence through SMS during the absence of a loved one. (It made me remember the box of letters that recorded our correspondence during the year we were separated when The Ex (unwillingly) did his national service.)\n\nThere are flaws in this debut novel: it’s risky to have a central character who’s as fraught as this one is and some readers might find her tiresome. But Blair never loses sight of the her central preoccupations and I thoroughly enjoyed the aspects that made me think about things in a different way.\n\nThere are other reviews at The Conversation; at ArtsHub; and at the Newtown Review of Books.\n\nAnna Kate Blair is a writer from New Zealand but she now works at Vic Writers, and you can find out more about her at her website.\n\nAuthor: Anna Kate Blair\n\nTitle: The MoDERN\n\nPublisher: Scribner (Simon & Schuster), 2023\n\nCover design by Laura Thomas\n\nISBN: 9781761421242, pbk., 327 pages\n\nSource: Personal copy, purchased at the author talk at Beaumaris Library, with thanks to Ulysses Bookstore in Sandringham."
