Mecca White's ethnicity is a mixture of American Indian, Africana, and European.\n\nShe attended The Lond Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts, Battery Place, New York, and Sanford Meisner Center. After completion, she enrolled at the New York Film Academy. White was a student of The Los Angeles Film School, where she graduated in 2016 with a Degree in Film/Cinema/ Video Studies.\n\n3. Mecca has worked on various projects in the entertainment industry\n\nMecca has accomplished so much within a short period in the industry. She attributes her success to her family (more so her mother and step-father) who worked extra hard to immerse her in the world of art, film, and laughter. She also took a course that helped in pushing her even higher.\n\nShe has featured in the comedic TV pilot Juice Truck as the writer and director. Mecca also worked on the short film crew, Carousel, directed by his step-father, Joseph Morgan. Some of her other appearances are:\n\n2002 - Girlfriends as Savannah\n\n2017 - Carousel as the Cashier\n\n2018 - Juice Truck as Alex\n\n2019 - Iconic as Niki\n\n2021 - Dhar Mann as Court Spectator 1\n\n4.

She is recognized for starring as Lynn Searcy on Girlfriends between 2000 and 2008. She is also a member of the XEO3 music band and a solo singer who released her debut album titled Mecca in 2009.\n\nHer biological father, Saul Stacey Williams, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, musician, poet, writer, and actor. He is recognized for his unique blending of poetry and alternative hip hop to produce a masterpiece. Saul also took lead roles in the independent film Slam (1998) and the jukebox musical Holler If Ya Hear Me (2013).\n\nHer step-father, Joseph Morgan, is a talented British actor and director. He is famously known for starring as Niklaus Mikaelson on the CW'S, The Vampire Diaries, and his lead role in its spin-off, The Originals.\n\n5. Mecca is a vegan like her mother\n\nMecca is a vegan like her mother. She regularly holds conversations centring on veganism on her social media platforms. Similarly, her mother is a vegan, a human and animal rights advocate, and an environmentalist.\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) honoured her as 2005 Humanitarian of the Year. She is also a board member of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.\n\n6. Her mother has been married twice\n\nMecca's mother, Persia, was first married to Saul Williams on 29th February 2008. The couple exchanged their wedding vows after dating for over five years. The couple first met when Saul made a guest appearance on Girlfriends.\n\nOn 17th January 2009, Persia announced through her Myspace blog that she and Saul were no longer together. Saul married actress Anisia Uzeyman and lived in Paris for four years before relocating to Los Angeles, where he currently resides.\n\nPersia moved on and remarried actor Joseph Morgan after the divorce. Persia and Morgan first met on the set of The Vampire Diaries. They started dating in 2011 and got engaged in 2015. They walked down the aisle on 5th July 2014 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.\n\n7. She has a good relationship with her step-father\n\nMecca found a father figure in Joseph Morgan, with whom they have a good relationship. The two have seemingly developed a great bond since Morgan entered Mecca and her mother’s life. He even adopted her and gave her his name, which Mecca has used as her middle moniker.\n\nMecca White has built quite a good resume for a film and art lover. She developed a passion for the movies thanks to the influence from her mother, Persia and step-father, Morgan. With the effort she is putting in, the future looks promising.\n\nTuko.co.ke shared an interesting article about Marta Fitzgerald. Rush Limbaugh's fans are familiar with Marta Fitzgerald. She is the ex-wife of the late American radio presenter, television host, and political analyst. Additionally, she was known for being an aerobic instructor.\n\nMarta Fitzgerald was the third woman Rush Limbaugh married. They married Rush in 1990 but divorced ten years later.
