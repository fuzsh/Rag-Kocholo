        "text": "The Leaves is a harrowing story, one that leaves the reader drained and dispirited. It’s the debut novel of Jacqueline Rule, a lawyer and academic from Sydney whose work in a legal organisation brought her into contact with children caught up in foster care and youth detention. She believes that the novel is an innately political form which can advocate for a more empathetic and humane approach to how our society reforms young offenders.\n\nThe story begins with the close friendship of Faith and Evelyn, both single mothers raising their children Luke and Mitch, who are close together in age. Neither of these women have friends or family as a support network because efforts to unite them with family or community through Stolen Generations reunion pathways have failed. So when Faith dies suddenly of meningitis, the social welfare system becomes responsible for Luke’s welfare, and for reasons depicted as inexplicable, they reject Evelyn’s attempts to become Luke’s foster parent. She tries very hard to do the right thing by her friend, impoverishing herself in the process, but is unsuccessful.\n\nAnd so begins a dispiriting story of one failed foster care placement after another, where Luke experiences indifference, neglect, cruelty, and violence. It’s more of the same when he transitions into group homes, except that it’s often the other children who torment him with impunity. When he’s old enough to leave, he finds himself among the homeless, but the support he finds there is broken up by the authorities and, almost inevitably, it seems, he ends up in juvenile detention, at the mercy of a violent guard who brings this narrative to its shocking conclusion.\n\nBecause the author has chosen to represent an ‘Everyman’ rather than the story of one child, it’s hard to know how common this relentless system failure is. Some of it is consistent with what I read in the award-winning Stone Girl (2018) by journalist Eleni Hale, a novel which was based on the author’s lived experience of foster care. (See my review here). That was harrowing to read too, but it was not without hope because of the example of the author herself, who had managed to transcend her terrible experiences and become a successful journalist. (Her website BTW tells us that she has a second novel in the pipeline.)\n\nThe OzChild website tells us that in 2021, one in 32 Australian children required child protection services last year. That’s an extraordinary statistic and it makes me wonder why, what is wrong in our society that so many children are vulnerable in this way, and more importantly what’s being done to prevent it?\n\nAuthor: Jacqueline Rule\n\nTitle: The Leaves\n\nPublisher: Spinifex Press, 2024\n\nCover design by Deb Snibson\n\nISBN: 9781922964021, pbk., 176 pages\n\nReview copy courtesy of Spinifex Press\n\nHere in Victoria, there is a critical shortage of foster carers. This is despite non-discriminatory eligibility, tax-free allowances to cover day-to-day expenses, plus extensive training as part of the recruitment process. see here. In my experience, in the later years of my career, the process also included training for teachers, both at the whole school level and for the individual teachers in day-to-day contact with the child."
