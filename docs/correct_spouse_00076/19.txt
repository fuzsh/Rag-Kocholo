Persia White (Lynn from “Girlfriends”) and poet Saul Williams were married February 29, 2008.? If you recall, Williams played Lynn’s boyfriend, Sivad, on the show.? How sweet is it that they are together in real life!?? I’m already missing Joan, Lynn and Mya…the CW was wrong for cancelling that show so abruptly.
