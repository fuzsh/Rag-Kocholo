        "text": "Right now, in Salt Lake City\n\nshooting High School Musical 2.\n\nI just finished Hairspray, up in Toronto, and then\n\nright now, actually, I'm in the process of filming\n\nHigh School Musical 2.\n\n(upbeat rock music)\n\nGoing from project to project, the way I like to do it.\n\nBoth musicals so I'm kind of in the\n\nswing of things right now.\n\nI started home-schooling when I was in the 8th grade,\n\nand my friends are going to prom but,\n\nI never got invited.\n\nIn High School Musical 2, in a little portion,\n\nin Troy's bedroom he has pictures of Troy and Gabriella\n\nwhen we went to prom so we got to take pictures\n\nof we went to prom in real prom outfits, you know.\n\nSo that was the closest I've gotten to prom though.\n\nI went to lots of other people's proms,\n\nas their date, but I didn't go to my own prom.\n\nOur director, Kenny was telling us about how\n\nhe went to Hawaii and he got a massage on the beach\n\nand he opens his eyes and he hears the roar of the ocean\n\nand gosh, I just really wanna go.\n\nNo, my style is a little more...\n\nI don't know. I think that the clothes that Gabriella wears\n\nis a little sweeter than some of the stuff that I would wear\n\nbut still the same kinda thing.\n\nA few of the dresses I picked out\n\n'cause I really like them, but\n\nI don't know. We're kinda similar in a way.\n\nI love jewelry. I love this necklace.\n\nIt's really cute. A little lobster.\n\nI love this too. I love skinny jeans.\n\nYou want my one tip, you want something\n\nthat I could never live without is\n\nmy eyelash curler (laughs).\n\nI think I wanna do a movie. I'm not sure what yet.\n\nAnd then after that I might record a second album.\n\nI think I'm gonna be playing High School\n\nfor a little while longer.\n\nBut, I love it.\n\nSo much happens in High School\n\nso you learn a lot about life.\n\nI learned everything I know."
