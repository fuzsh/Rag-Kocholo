        "text": "After “High School Musical,” Zac Efron — who played Troy Bolton, the hunky basketball star turned musical theater geek — became Hollywood’s new favorite leading man.\n\nImmediately following the first “HSM” movie, Efron landed a role as the suave Link Larkin in the 2007 film adaptation of “Hairspray,” in which he stole the heart of Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) and proved his singing chops. (Actor Drew Seeley provided the vocals for Troy Bolton in the first “High School Musical,” but it’s all Efron in the two follow-ups.)\n\nIn 2009, one year after the release of the third and final “HSM” film, Efron starred in the commercially successful comedy “17 Again” and Richard Linklater’s period drama “Me and Orson Welles,” which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Efron continued to build up an acting resume ranging from rom-coms to indie dramas, including “Charlie St. Cloud” (2010), “New Year’s Eve” (2011), “The Lucky One” (2012), “Neighbors” (2014) and its sequel “Neighbors 2” (2016), “The Disaster Artist” (2017) and “The Greatest Showman” (2017).\n\nMost recently, Efron portrayed serial killer Ted Bundy in “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile” (2019) for Netflix, and also served as an executive producer on the movie.\n\nThough he has a few film projects on the way — a remake of Stephen King’s “Firestarter” and the survival thriller “Gold” — Efron has put a larger focus on his passion for the environment and sustainability, which he showcased in his 2020 Netflix travel docuseries, “Down to Earth With Zac Efron.”\n\nFollowing her first turn as the school’s “freaky genius girl” Gabriella Montez in “High School Musical,” Hudgens signed a recording contract with Hollywood Records, Disney Music Group’s label, and released her gold-certified debut album, “V.”\n\nIn 2008, before “High School Musical 3,” Hudgens released her second album, “Identified,” which did not see much commercial success but introduced the bop “Sneakernight.” Hudgens then decided to focus more on acting, playing Mimi in the Hollywood Bowl’s 2010 production of “Rent” directed by Neil Patrick Harris, and leading Zack Snyder’s “Sucker Punch” in 2011. Hudgens continued to show off her acting chops in James Franco’s raunchy 2013 film “Spring Breakers” and “The Frozen Ground,” in which she appeared alongside John Cusack and Nicolas Cage.\n\nIn 2015, Hudgens returned to the stage, portraying the titular role in “Gigi” on Broadway. She played Rizzo in 2016’s “Grease: Live,” and she starred alongside herself in Netflix’s “The Princess Switch” series.\n\nIn January 2019, Hudgens returned to “Rent” in Fox’s “Rent: Live,” this time playing the role of Maureen, and, in 2020, she held a small role in “Bad Boys for Life.”\n\nComing up, Hudgens will once again put her musical skills to the test as the lead of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s film “adaptation of Jonathan Larson’s musical “Tick, Tick… Boom!”\n\nKnown for playing the spoiled, obnoxious Sharpay Evans in “High School Musical,” Ashley Tisdale got her start on another Disney show, “The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.” But “HSM” catapulted her to new heights, resulting in a record deal with Warner Bros. Records (now called Warner Records), where she released two albums, “Headstrong” (2007) and “Guilty Pleasure” (2009).\n\nAfter exiting her record deal, Tisdale decided to focus more on acting and a newfound love for producing. Her production company, Blondie Girl Productions, was established in 2008 and signed a multi-year deal with Relativity Media, under which Tisdale executive produced and starred in the ABC Family film “Picture This” (2008).\n\nTisdale returned to television in 2010, playing the head cheerleader in the CW’s “Hellcats,” and later reprised the role of Sharpay in the “HSM” spin-off “Sharpay’s Fabulous Adventure,” which she also executive produced. In 2014, Tisdale held a lead role in ABC Family’s “Young & Hungry,” which she also produced. Most recently, Tisdale has served as a panelist on ABC’s “The Masked Singer” spin-off “The Masked Dancer.”\n\nThough Tisdale has often teased a third album, she is currently focused on something else: motherhood. Her daughter, with husband Christopher French, was born in March.\n\nIn “HSM,” Corbin Bleu portrayed the basketball-carrying, graphic tee-wearing Chad Danforth, who was Troy’s right-hand man. In the films, it took Chad a long time to come around to the fact that his best bro had a passion for theater, so much so that he sang a song called “I Don’t Dance” — but in real life, that couldn’t be further from the truth.\n\nAfter starring in the Disney Channel movie “Jump In!” and appearing on shows like “Hannah Montana” and “Ned’s Declassified School Survival Guide.” Bleu made his Broadway debut in 2010 as Usnavi in Lin-Manuel Miranda’s “In the Heights.” In 2011, Bleu played the role of Seaweed in “Hairspray” at the Hollywood Bowl and finished as the runner-up on “Dancing With the Stars” in 2013.\n\nBleu returned to Broadway in 2016 as the leading role in “Holiday Inn,” in which he showed off his tap dancing skills, later winning the Chita Rivera Award for best male performance. In 2019, he played Bill Calhoun/Lucentio in the Broadway revival of “Kiss Me, Kate” for which Bleu was nominated for a Drama Desk award for outstanding featured actor in a musical.\n\nIn addition to his work in theater, Bleu has also appeared on shows like “The Good Wife,” “Psych,” “Drop Dead Diva,” “The Fosters,” “The Middle,” “Supergirl” and “Dynasty.”\n\nOlivia Rodrigo is the franchise’s latest breakout star.\n\nRodrigo, who plays talented songwriter Nini on “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series,” had her first hit with “All I Want,” a piano ballad that she penned for the series. The song debuted at No. 90 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has since become gold-certified with over 570 million global streams.\n\n“They were like, ‘Here, you’re 16 years old and have no writing credits. Why don’t you write this song for us?’ And it actually did really well,” said Rodrigo, who is one of Variety’s Young Hollywood cover stars.\n\nAfter releasing her record-smashing debut single “Drivers License” in January and No. 1 album “Sour” in May, Rodrigo has become one of pop’s biggest forces, while still starring on the show’s second season.\n\n“I think our entire generation sort of grew up on ‘High School Musical,'” Rodrigo said. “The generation before us grew up on ‘High School Musical,’ and I also think the generation after us will grow up on ‘High School Musical,’ because that’s just how it is. That concept is just so powerful.”"
