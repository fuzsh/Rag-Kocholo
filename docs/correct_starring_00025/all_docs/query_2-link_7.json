        "text": "Zac Efron came into America's collective consciousness in 2005 living the true American dream: singing while playing basketball. 15 years later, and the now 32-year-old star might not be doing much singing or hooping anymore, but he's still making us smile, whether he's leading comedies, showing off his workout routines, or playing a far-too-charismatic (and terrifyingly chilling) serial killer.\n\nRecently, Efron had his own feel-good Netflix travel show, called Down To Earth. But the reason we're willing to go on adventures with him in a nonfiction show is because we already feel like we know him well from the work he's done in the fictional realm. For someone who started off as basically a teeny-bopper, Efron has done a lot of work in the past few years to make us enjoy his presence on screen, whether it's making us laugh, making us terrified, or just putting us in awe of how he managed to get in such insanely-good shape.\n\nWe can't say every movie on this list is great (they can't all be winners!), but it's been a blast to watch one of the industry's most likable figures go from a Disney-bred teenager to someone who could feasibly play Ted Bundy, a pyromaniac with wild facial hair named Flicker, and Freddie from Scooby Doo in just about the same calendar year. A note here, too, that we're looking fairly exclusively here at movies where Efron played a leading or at least semi-leading role; it's very fun to see him pop up in The Disaster Artist, but that's way more of a fun project for laughs than a real leading role to be judged. We also didn't include TV like Summerland or his little-seen abandoned comedy pilot with Jennifer Coolidge (yes, that certainly exists, and yes, we, too, wish there was more). But we digress: we're here for the movies.\n\nSo, without further ado, we give you the definitive ranking of every movie Zac Efron has ever starred in."
