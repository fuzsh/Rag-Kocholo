        "text": "Zac Efron has said that he’s open to the possibility of a High School Musical reboot.\n\nThe 34-year-old actor starred in the 200 film alongside Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, and Corbin Bleu among others.\n\nThe film followed the story of two high school students who secretly decide to audition for their school’s musical.\n\nIn a new interview with E! News, when Efron was asked whether he would be interested in an HSM reboot, he said: “Of course.”\n\nHe added: “I mean, to have an opportunity in any form to go back and work with that team would be so amazing. My heart is still there. That would be incredible. I hope it happens.”\n\nHigh School Musical first aired on the Disney Channel in 2006 and was followed by a sequel in 2007.\n\nA third film, High School Musical 3: Senior Year, was released in cinemas in 2008.\n\nIn 2020, Efron and Hudgens virtually reunited with their High School Musical castmates for a Disney musical special during the pandemic, with director Kenny Ortega.\n\nThe Disney Family Singalong saw the former Disney stars perform a number of their biggest hits from self-isolation, with special performances from Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato."
