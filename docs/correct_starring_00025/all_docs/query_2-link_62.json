        "text": "Background\n\nZac Efron was born on October 18, 1987, in San Luis Obispo, California, to administrative assistant Starla Baskett and electrical engineer David Efron. He has a younger brother named Dylan. When he was 11 years old, his parents saw his singing talent and encouraged him to pursue theater, leading to him participating in his high school’s theater productions. His acting teacher introduced him to an agency, and Efron was eventually signed to the Creative Artists Agency. He was accepted to the University of Southern California after graduating from Arroyo Grande High School in 2006 but decided to take a hiatus from his education to pursue his dream of becoming a film director.\n\nIn 2002, Efron guest starred on several television shows, such as “Firefly,” “ER,” and “The Guardian.” The following year, he appeared in the critically acclaimed television film “Miracle Run.” After several guest appearances, he became a permanent cast member of the show “Summerland” in 2004 and was featured in the ‘Sick Inside’ music video and the film “The Derby Stallion.” Efron broke into the film industry in 2006 after starring in “High School Musical,” one of the most popular made-for-television films of all time, and became popular among the younger generation. He and costar Vanessa Hudgens began dating in real life, and he appeared in the music video of her single, ‘Say OK.’\n\nMore recently, Efron has appeared in various popular films, including “Baywatch,” “The Greatest Showman, and “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile.” Since 2020, he has hosted a Netflix web documentary called “Down to Earth with Zac Efron” alongside Darin Olien. Efron, also one of the show’s executive producers, travels to different countries and learns about the locals’ ways of life. He’s currently based in Australia after relocating there in 2021.\n\nZac Efron Movies"
