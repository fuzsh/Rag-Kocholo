        "text": "Story\n\nTalented basketballer and high school musical star, Troy (Zac Efron), gets summer jobs at the local country club for himself, his girlfriend Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and their East High School friends. The plan is to save up for college and enjoy the summer together.\n\nBut there’s a major problem. Sharpay’s (Ashley Tisdale) parents own the country club, and Sharpay herself has only one thing in mind: she wants handsome and talented Troy for herself. And Sharpay isn’t afraid to use tricks and bribery to get what she wants.\n\nWill Troy lose track of his values and betray his friends and his true self?\n\nThemes\n\nMusical; comedy; teenage romance; coming of age; friendship; jealousy; teamwork; competition; staying true to oneself\n\nViolence\n\nThere’s no violence in High School Musical 2.\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are no sexual references in High School Musical 2.\n\nAlcohol, drugs and other substances\n\nThere’s no use of substances in High School Musical 2.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nHigh School Musical 2 has some mild partial nudity and romantic activity. For example:\n\nSome female characters wear low-cut clothes that show cleavage.\n\nTroy is shown topless on several occasions.\n\nCharacters hold hands and hug.\n\nProduct placement\n\nThere’s no product placement in High School Musical 2.\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere’s some mild coarse language in High School Musical 2, including ‘jerk’.\n\nAlso, Sharpay often rudely shouts and yells at people.\n\nIdeas to discuss with your children\n\nHigh School Musical 2 is the sequel to the popular High School Musical and features many members of the original cast. Like the first movie, this musical movie is aimed at a preteen audience with a love for music, dance and teenage romance.\n\nAlthough High School Musical 2 has positive messages about friendship, some characters are very stereotypical. This includes Sharpay, who’s the cliché of the superficial, manipulative, spoilt, blonde rich girl. She wears pink outfits and has glittery accessories, a lap dog and an entourage of giggling, airheaded girlfriends.\n\nThese are the main messages from High School Musical 2:\n\nStay true to yourself.\n\nMean and manipulative behaviour doesn’t pay off in the long run.\n\nValues in High School Musical 2 that you could reinforce with your children include:\n\nbeing a loyal friend\n\nstanding up for yourself\n\nkeeping promises.\n\nHigh School Musical 2 could also give you the chance to talk with your children about the real-life consequences of things like selfish and manipulative behaviour."
