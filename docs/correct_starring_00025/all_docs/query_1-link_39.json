        "text": "Who Killed the Soaps? 7 Culprits, Including The Real Housewives, Farmville, and James Franco\n\nSoap opera fans &mdash; and Hoover &mdash; can go ahead and blame ABC's head of daytime Brian Frons for the death of All My Children and One Life to Live. Two weeks ago, he pulled the trigger, ending 40 years worth of storytelling, and further enraging fans by announcing in the same breath that both series would be replaced by cheaper-to-produce talk shows. Susan Lucci on All My Children's cancellation: \"I was completely blindsided\" It's true that soaps don't make as much money as they used to, but why? Are there culprits to blame beyond network executives needing to cut costs? We point a finger at several other guilty parties in the death of the serial:\n\nFinally, High School Musical: The Reality Series\n\nHow it took this long, I do not know. ABC is developing a reality competition based on Disney Channel's uberpopular High School Musical, Variety reports.Eyeing a summer debut, the multi-episode series will launch with a nationwide talent hunt, followed by a chosen few honing their skills at a music conservatory. Wannabe Troys and Gabriellas will be eliminated each week until a winner (of what, that has yet TBD) is chosen. Appearances by kicking and screaming HSM stars are likely, says the trade.\n\nHigh School Starlet Is Making Her Own Music\n\nHigh School Musical's Kaycee Stroh had music on her mind on the red carpet of the Bebe Lingerie Launch Party, held Feb. 13 at Element in Hollywood. Besides anticipating the filming of High School Musical 3, she is embarking on a singing career. \"I just got my first song for Disney and I will be recording it within the next couple of weeks,\" she shared. \"Hopefully it will come out either right before or right after High School Musical 3.\"Stroh hopes to convey confidence and sassiness in her upcoming song. Referring to her self-acknowledged weight gain due to recent knee surgery, she wants to build confidence in girls everywhere. \"No matter what size or shape or color, girls are beautiful and girls are fun. This song I&#146;m doing has to do with being confident. I hope I can project that.\" &#151; Summer Brooks"
