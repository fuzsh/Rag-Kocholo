        "text": "On Wednesday Zac Efron fans found themselves in a frenzy. The trailer for A24’s forthcoming biopic The Iron Claw, in which the Hollywood heartthrob stars as a wrestler, was released. Right now the attention is on the loyally followed actor and his co-stars Jeremy Allen White, from The Bear, and Harris Dickinson, famous for Beach Rats.\n\nDirected by Sean Dirken, the man behind spooky psychological thriller, The Nest, The Iron Claw chronicles the true story of the Von Erichs: an American family of pro-wrestlers who made history competing in the ring during wrestling’s golden era. Calling it a sports film barely scratches the surface and those already privy to the Von Erich’s will know that fierce fighting aside, gruesomeness and grief riddle their story.\n\nThe film’s themes are certainly of the moment; there’s a domineering patriarch, Fritz Von Erich played by Mindhunter’s Holt McCallany, who stops at nothing to ensure his sons follow in his footsteps and become world wrestling champs. Kevin’s three sons, Kerry, Kevin and David are inseparable but complicated, and a tragedy exposes the extreme consequences of overwhelming pressure to perform. Romance is involved too, as Lily James plays Zac Efron’s lover.\n\nIt’s as dark and twisted as we’d expect from as A24 production, which again translates into captivating cinematography. Just in time for Christmas, The Iron Claw lands in UK cinemas on December 22nd."
