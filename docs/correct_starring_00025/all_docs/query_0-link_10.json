        "text": "High School Musical 2 is the second film in the High School Musical series. The World Premiere took place on August 14, 2007,[1] at Disneyland, in Anaheim, California. The primary cast, including Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, and Corbin Bleu attended the event. The film debuted on television on August 17, 2007, on Disney Channel in the U.S., and on Family in Canada.\n\nIn the second installment of the Disney franchise, high school student Troy Bolton stresses over getting a job, with the price of college expenses looming on his mind, as well as trying to make sure he and Gabriella Montez are able to stay together all summer. This situation attracts the attention of Sharpay Evans, who attempts to steal Troy for herself by hiring him at her family's country club.\n\nThe premiere was seen by a total of over 17.2 million viewers[2] in the United States which is almost 10 million more than its predecessor, making it the highest-rated Disney Channel Movie of all time as well as the highest-rated basic cable telecast at the time.[3][4][5]\n\nPlot[]\n\nThe school year ends with everyone at East High School looking forward to summer vacation (\"What Time Is It\"). Troy Bolton is still dating Gabriella Montez, who decides to stay in Albuquerque with her mother. Troy eventually decides to look for a summer job to gain money for college.\n\nSharpay and Ryan Evans plan to spend part of the summer at their family's country club, Lava Springs (\"Fabulous\"), but Sharpay's summer plans also include pursuing Troy, whom she has arranged to be hired at the club. However, Troy convinces the club's manager, Mr. Fulton, into hiring Gabriella and their close group of friends as well; including Taylor and Chad. Sharpay is enraged upon learning that Gabriella is working as one of the lifeguards, but is unable to get her fired. So she orders Fulton to give them difficult tasks so they would be best to quit. Fulton attempts to intimidate the group, but Troy rebuilds their confidence and convinces them that they can persevere (\"Work This Out\").\n\nTroy continues to worry about funding for college. Sharpay senses his need and arranges for Troy to be promoted, hoping that this will convince him to sing with her at the talent show. Meanwhile, Kelsi writes a ballad for Troy and Gabriella. Troy agrees to sing with his friends in the show (\"You Are The Music In Me\"), not knowing that Sharpay is vying for his attention. (In the extended version, Sharpay and Ryan trap Troy as he prepares for a date with Gabriella, and perform their potential show-stopper (\"Humuhumunukunukuapua'a\").\n\nRyan realizes he does not mean much to Sharpay anymore, as she is ready to blow her brother aside for the opportunity to perform with Troy. This leads to tension between the twin siblings and Ryan angrily informs Sharpay that he will no longer obey her orders. Taylor and Gabriella invite Ryan to the baseball game, where he persuades the Wildcats to take part in the talent show (\"I Don't Dance\").\n\nTroy and Gabriella's relationship is strained when Troy sees Ryan with Gabriella, sparking jealousy. Owing to a \"promise\" from Troy, he and Sharpay practice their song for the Midsummer Night's Talent Show (\"You Are The Music In Me (Sharpay Version)\").\n\nWhen Sharpay discovers that Ryan and the Wildcats are putting together their own performance in the show, she orders Mr. Fulton to ban all junior staff members from performing. Gabriella angrily confronts Sharpay about her interference and quits her job at Lava Springs. Troy overhears the exchange and tries to persuade Gabriella to change her mind. Gabriella expresses her loss of trust with Troy (\"Gotta Go My Own Way\") and leaves Lava Springs, and gives him the necklace back. It also seems that they broke up.\n\nTroy returns to work the next day to find that his friends refuse to talk to him. Kelsi silently shows Troy the notice from Mr. Fulton, causing Troy to question his own motivations (\"Bet On It\"). He begins to reconcile with Chad and his other friends. Then Troy confronts Sharpay, informing her that he will not sing with her because of the way Sharpay and Troy himself have been treating tbe junior staff earlier. The Wildcats and Chad forgive Troy for his absence and convince him to sing in the talent show, which he does only under the condition that they are all allowed to perform as well.\n\nAt Sharpay's supposed instruction, Ryan gives Troy a new song to learn moments before the show. As Troy goes onstage, he asks Sharpay why she switched the song, and Sharpay is shocked to find that her brother tricked her. Troy sings the song (\"Everyday\") alone until Gabriella surprisingly joins him onstage. In the end, Sharpay proudly presents her brother, Ryan, with the award for the talent show. After the talent show, all the Wildcats go to the golf course to enjoy the fireworks.\n\nEveryone celebrates the end of the summer with a pool party (\"All for One\") which features a cameo appearance by Miley Cyrus.\n\nCast[]\n\nZac Efron as Troy Bolton\n\nVanessa Hudgens as Gabriella Montez\n\nAshley Tisdale as Sharpay Evans\n\nLucas Grabeel as Ryan Evans\n\nCorbin Bleu as Chad Danforth\n\nMonique Coleman as Taylor McKessie\n\nMark L.

The show offered viewers a behind-the-scenes look into the production of the movie. The world premiere of the opening number \"What Time Is It\" was on Radio Disney May 25, 2007,[6] and similarly \"You Are The Music In Me\" premiered on July 13, 2007.[7]\n\nOn December 11, 2007, the movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray titled High School Musical 2: Extended Edition. On September 15, 2008, a 2-disc special edition of the movie was released titled High School Musical 2: Deluxe Dance Edition. In fact, this was the first Disney Channel Original Movie to get a Blu-Ray release.\n\nSongs[]\n\nSong Chiefly sung by Other singers Scene What Time Is It? Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Ryan, Chad, Taylor Wildcats East High's Classroom, Hallways, Cafeteria What Time Is It (Reprise) Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Ryan, Chad, Taylor Wildcats East High's School Grounds Fabulous Sharpay Ryan & Sharpettes Lava Springs Pool Work This Out Troy, Gabriella, Chad, Taylor, Kelsi, Zeke, Martha, Jason Wildcats and Kitchen Workers Lava Springs Kitchen You Are the Music in Me Troy and Gabriella Kelsi and Wildcats Lava Springs Dining Room Humuhumunukunukuapua'a Sharpay and Ryan Sharpettes Lava Springs Backstage Room I Don't Dance Chad and Ryan Baseball Players, Wildcats, and Company Lava Springs Baseball Field You Are the Music in Me (Reprise) Sharpay and Troy Sharpettes Lava Springs Stage Gotta Go My Own Way Gabriella Troy Lava Springs Pool, Locker Room, Grounds Bet On It Troy None Lava Springs Golf Course Everyday Troy and Gabriella Wildcats and Company Lava Springs Stage All for One Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Ryan, Chad, Taylor Kelsi, Zeke, Martha, Jason, Wildcats, Company Lava Springs Pool\n\nReception[]\n\nThe first broadcast of the film on August 17, 2007 broke records, receiving 17.2 million viewers.[4] This number made it, at the time, the most-watched basic-cable telecast in history (the previous record was held by an edition of ESPN's Monday Night Football between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys on October 23, 2006, which attracted 16 million viewers), the most-watched made-for-cable movie ever (the previous record was held by TNT's January 21, 2001 airing of Crossfire Trail, which brought in 12.5 million viewers), and the largest audience of any program on broadcast or cable in the 2007 summer television season, along with Friday nights for the past five years. Ratings for the second showing of the movie fell to 8.4 million, and the third showing fell to 7.4 million, totaling the premiere weekend to 33.04 million viewers.[8]\n\nIn Latin America, the premiere of High School Musical 2 was seen by 3.3 million viewers in the north region. The film was the most-watched in its schedule, among all cable channels, and produced the highest rating of the channel, surpassing all original films of Disney Channel. Among other records, the premiere in Argentina surpassed the debut of High School Musical the last year, in a 107 percent, while in Brazil the sequel reached 208 percent, and Mexico did so with 61 percent.[9] In the United Kingdom, the movie became Disney Channel UK's most viewed program ever, totaling 1.2 million viewers in its first showing.[10]\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, gaining a score of 57% on Rotten Tomatoes while gaining a score of 72/100 at Metacritic.[11][12] USA Today's Robert Bianco awarded the film three stars out of four, saying High School Musical 2 was \"sweet, smart, bursting with talent and energy, and awash in innocence\".[13] While critics enjoyed the film, they noted that the timing of the movie's premiere seemed odd, premiering just when school was about to start up again, while the movie's plot involved the gang going on summer vacation.[14] High School Musical 2 won the \"So Hot Right Now\" award at the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards 2007, in which High School Musical castmate Zac Efron hosted with The Veronicas.\n\nHigh School Musical 2: On Stage![]\n\nMain article: High School Musical 2: On Stage!\n\nLike the original High School Musical, the sequel has been adapted into two different theatrical productions: a one-act, 70-minute version and a two-act full-length production. This stage production includes the song \"Hummuhummunukunukuapua'a\" that was left out of the original movie but included in the DVD. Through Music Theater International, Disney Theatrical began licensing the theatrical rights in October 2008. MTI had originally recruited 7 schools to serve as tests for the new full-length adaptation, but due to complications with multiple drafts of both the script and the score, all but two schools were forced to drop out of the pilot program.\n\nOn May 18, 2008, Woodlands High School became the first school to produce High School Musical 2.\n\nFrom July 17-August 3, 2008, Harrell Theatre, in Collierville, Tennessee, was the first community theatre to perform the production, which featured both a senior cast and a junior cast.\n\nFrom January 15 - February 15, 2009, the West Coast premiere production was presented by Pacific Repertory Theatre's School of Dramatic Arts. The production was directed by PacRep founder Stephen Moorer, who previously directed the California premiere of the first High School Musical.[15]\n\nFrom 6–18 April 2009, the UK Premiere was performed by StageDaze Theatre Company in Cardiff.[16]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nZac Efron finally sings with his own vocals starting with this film, after his singing voice was substituted with Drew Seeley's vocals in the first movie. This is because the songs for the second film were written to suit his baritone range.\n\nConsidering that this film is summer themed, majority of it took place at Lava Springs Country Club.\n\nThis is the only film where it doesn't predominantly take place at East High.\n\nThe Lava Springs Country Club scenes were filmed at an actual resort, The Inn at Entrada, located in St. George, Utah.\n\nThe cast and crew were lodged in the resort's villas during filming.\n\nLike East High, the resort became a popular tourist destination.\n\nIt's been revealed in the film that the entire East High student body were all hired at Sharpay and Ryan's resort.\n\nTroy and Gabriella have their first onscreen kiss in this film.\n\nTable tennis balls filled in for real golf balls in the golf course scenes. This was done for the safety of the cast and crew and to ensure no filming equipment gets damaged.\n\nThis is the only High School Musical film that doesn't have a basketball championship game.\n\nThis movie premiered on the same day as the series premiere of Phineas and Ferb.\n\nMiley Cyrus, who is known for playing Hannah Montana, makes a cameo in the finale as one of the dancing pool party attendees. She was voted by Disney fans through a poll by Disney Channel on which Disney star would make a cameo.\n\nGallery[]\n\nPosters[]\n\nAwards[]\n\nYear Award Category Result 2007 American Music Award Favorite Soundtrack\n\n(High School Musical 2 (soundtrack)) Won Bravo Magazine Award Bravo Otto for TV Star – Male\n\n(Zac Efron) Won CMA Wild and Young Awards Best Single International\n\n(You Are the Music in Me by Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens and written by Jamie Houston) Won Family Television Awards Best Actor\n\n(Zac Efron) Won Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards Fave Movie Star\n\n(Zac Efron) Won So Hot Right Now!
