        "text": "Zac Efron still has his head in the game. On Friday, the former High School Musical star made a surprise return to the home of the Wildcats.\n\nTo the delight of HSM fans everywhere, Zac posed outside of the real Salt Like City school where the DCOM was filmed. For the Instagram photo, the actor stood outside the front of the school, his hand outstretched in a fist toward the sky. “Don’t you… Forget about me,” he captioned the shot.\n\nZac didn't divulge any further details of what prompted his visit to East High, but Vanessa Hudgens made a similar recent trip. Near the end of June, Vanessa shared a TikTok from outside of the school. In her video, which she soundtracked with “Breaking Free,” she struck various poses and shared a few smiles.\n\nOne of Zac's former HSM stars took note of his East High trip. Bart Johnson, who fans may remember as Coach Jack Bolton, left an adorable Instagram comment, writing, “Warms coaches ole heart to see this. Welcome home, son. WHAT TEAM!?”\n\nOthers speculated that Vanessa and Zac could be returning to East High. “I hope this means you and Vanessa are guest starring on HSMTMTS,” one follower wrote. Another added, “Reunion? HSM4??? What does this mean?!!!”\n\nThere's no official word on a HSM reunion or a return of any of its former stars, but Zac recently expressed interest in a fourth film. In a May interview, he confirmed that “of course” he would return for a High School Musical 4, saying, “Seriously, having the opportunity in any form to go back and work with that team would be so amazing.”"
