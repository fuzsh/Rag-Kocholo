He's \"the man, the myth, the...lie\" as the film's trailer portrays.\n\nThe movie follows three childhood best friends Dean, JT, and Wes (Zac Efron, Andrew Santino, and Jermaine Fowler) who pull a prank gone wrong when they invent the imaginary Ricky Stanicky to get them out of trouble. Twenty years after creating this ‘friend,’ the trio still use the nonexistent Ricky as a handy alibi for their immature behavior."
