It’s been following me since I got back.\n\n“Either I’m going crazy, or I’m being set up.”\n\nBest films of 2019 (so far)\n\nShow all 49\n\nThe real Bundy was executed in 1989 aged 42. At the time of his death, he had confessed to killing 30 women and girls across seven states, though the actual death toll might be higher.\n\nExtremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, and Vile premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nIt is scheduled to be released in some theatres and has been acquired by Netflix. The film will be available on Sky in the UK in May.\n\nThe trailer of the biopic received mixed reactions earlier this year, leaving some viewers worried that the film would glorify Bundy. Director Joe Berlinger has dismissed those concerns as naive.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
