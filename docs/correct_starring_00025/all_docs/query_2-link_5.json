        "text": "\"Somehow that didn't make it onto the Netflix title,\" Nicole told People.\n\nIf there's one thing to watch this week, it's Nicole Kidman and Zac Efron in the new Netflix rom-com A Family Affair.\n\nThe movie premiered on the streaming service Friday. In it, Nicole plays a writer facing a major conundrum: She's falling for a movie star, played by Zac, who just happens to be her daughter's boss. Joey King plays Nicole's daughter.\n\nThe movie's title, A Family Affair, makes perfect sense, but Nicole and Zac recently revealed that the film initially had a different title — one that wasn't exactly the most restrained.\n\nIn an interview with People last week, the two stars explained that the film was once titled Motherf****r.\n\n\"Beeped out,\" Kidman said. \"Somehow that didn't make it onto the Netflix title.\"\n\nZac noted that the film's original title definitely caught his eye before he joined the movie.\n\n\"That made the script stay at the top of the pile,\" he told People. \"It's like, what on Earth could this be about?\"\n\nWell, there you go. In the same interview, Nicole praised Zac for being \"game\" to tell a story about an older woman romancing a younger man.\n\n\"The problem is we've not had the equivalent from all different viewpoints, with women telling the stories. And we need game men,\" she told People. \"[Zac] came in and makes the film because he was like, 'I'm here to have fun, to play, and to very much be a part of this and be there for you' — for both Joey and I.\"\n\nNicole also expressed this sentiment at the film's premiere last month when Variety asked about the film's message.\n\nShe responded, in part, by noting the importance of a woman writing the film. That would be Carrie Solomon, who made her feature screenplay debut with A Family Affair.\n\n“Having a female write this, and now having more stories and all the work we’ve done for a decade just to get all the different stories out there, be they comedies, be they dramas…just with that perspective of women, without the judgment behind it,” Nicole told Variety.\n\nYou can stream A Family Affair on Netflix now.\n\nShare This Article"
