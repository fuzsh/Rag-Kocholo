        "text": "Kenny Ortega returns with High School Musical 2, sequel to the surprise hit, High School Musical. High School Musical 2 premiered Friday the 17th of August on the Disney Channel.\n\nThe original cast of HSM returned for the sequel including, Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale, Lucas Grabeel, and Corbin Bleu.\n\nDid anybody watch last night? Or was I the lone HSM Nerd. Any comments? What did you think of it?\n\nI noticed that they had a better grasp on continuity this time around. HSM1 was filled with errors. Also in my personal opinion I thought this was much better choreographed. Here is the IMDB link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810900/\n\nWell, they are all people associated with Disney. Zac Efron was in Hairspray though. So you might have heard of him from that.\n\nI wasn't thinking many people here would be familiar with Disney Original Movies, but I decided to put it up anyways. Cause' you never know. There might be another High School Musical fan somewhere on the boards. haha"
