        "text": "Troy's performance of \"Get'cha Head in the Game\" in High School Musical is arguably one of the most famous moments in Disney Channel history, but our minds have been totally blown by the truth behind the vocals of the movie.\n\nThough he starred as Troy Bolton in the franchise, Zac Efron's voice can barely be heard in any of the first movie's songs. It turns out he recorded them but didn't make the final cut, and most of his parts were sung instead by actor Drew Seeley, with Zac lip-syncing on-screen. And Zac wasn't told why, he said in a 2007 Orlando Sentinel interview recently unearthed by J-14.\n\n\"In the first movie, after everything was recorded, my voice was not on them,\" he said. \"I was not really given an explanation. It just kind of happened that way. Unfortunately, it put me in an awkward position. It's not something I expected to be addressed. Then High School Musical blew up. I'm very fortunate that Drew has gotten proper credit and also that I've gotten the opportunity to come back and try it again with my own voice.\"\n\nHe said he believes Drew is a better singer than him, while he's just \"a regular kid that can carry a tune.\" However, he was adamant about getting to sing in the second movie. \"That was a very huge point for me,\" he said. \"I had to put my foot down and fight to get my voice on these tracks.\""
