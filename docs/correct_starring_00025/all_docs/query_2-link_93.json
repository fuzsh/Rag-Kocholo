        "text": "The dog days of August saw Universal’s box-office champ Straight Outta Compton remain No. 1 for the third straight weekend with $13.2 million from 3,142 theaters, while Christian drama War Room did far better than expected in earning $11 million from a small footprint of 1,135 locations to come in second.\n\nElsewhere, Zac Efron’s electronic dance music drama We Are Your Friends forged few friendships, debuting to a dismal $1.8 million from 2,333 locations, the worst opening of all time for a new major studio offering opening in 2,000 or more theaters, not accounting for inflation.\n\nIf there’s any solace, it is that Warner Bros. paid a modest $2 million to distribute the film in North America on behalf of Working Title Films and StudioCanal (still, it’s the latest in a string of summer titles from the studio to disappoint). We Are Your Friends, directed by Max Joseph (Catfish: The TV Series), placed No. 13 or No. 14.\n\nWe Are Your Friends stars Efron as a young DJ trying to break into the EDM scene and become a music producer. Wes Bentley and Emily Ratajkowski also star in the film, which earned middling reviews and a C+ CinemaScore from audiences. Tracking had suggested We Are Your Friends would open to at least $8 million.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\n“This was a passion project for Zac Efron, and we believe in him,” said Warners exec VP for domestic distribution Jeff Goldstein. “Yes, the result was disappointing, but this was a small film.”\n\nThe only titles opening in 2,000 to 2,500 theaters that did less than We Are Your Friends were two films from independent distributors, Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure ($443,901) and Delgo ($511,920), and the rerelease of Saw on its 10th anniversary in 2014 ($650,051).\n\n‘Straight Outta Compton’ Breaks Out With Massive Box Office Take\n\nStraight Outta Compton finished Sunday with a domestic total of $134.1 million in the latest victory for Universal, which is enjoying the biggest year in history of any Hollywood studio at the global box office. Overseas, Compton opened to No. 1 in the U.K. and Germany with $3.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively. All told, the biopic of gangsta rap group N.W.A earned $6.5 million from eight markets for a worldwide cume of $140.9 million.\n\nHowever, it was Terminator: Genisys that won the weekend overseas thanks to a late run in China, where it grossed $23.4 million for an eight-day cume of $82.8 million. The film has jumped the $300 million mark internationally for a foreign total of $320.1 million and global cume of $409.5 million.\n\nParamount’s Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation also jumped the $300 million mark overseas, earning $15.3 million from 64 markets for a foreign cume of $309 million and a global total of $479.9 million. Paramount partnered with Skydance on both Mission: Impossible and Terminator: Genisys."
