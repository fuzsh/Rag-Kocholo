Unfortunately, they are all broke and must get jobs in order to be able to afford to enjoy themselves.\n\nTroy thinks his problem is solved when he gets a job at Sharpay's family resort, but he fails to realise that she has an ulterior motive for hiring him. Will she manage to lure Troy away from Gabriela and his friends to duet with her at the country club's talent show?"
