        "text": "Where does Zac Efron‘s career go next after “The Iron Claw“? Fans already know that “Ricky Stanicky” and “A Family Affair” are on their way in 2024, but beyond that? Well, Black Bear has a package for “Famous” for ready for independent buyers ahead of EFM next week. And the upcoming thriller will see Efron stretch his range as an actor once more, with him playing dual roles: a Hollywood heartthrob and his obsessive lookalike fan.\n\nREAD MORE: ‘Ricky Stanicky’ Trailer: Zac Efron, John Cena & More Star In Peter Farrelly’s New R-Rated Comedy\n\nBased on Blake Crouch‘s 2010 novel of the same name, “Famous” sees Efron play Hollywood hopeful Lance Dunkquist, who’s the spitting image of leading A-lister, James Jansen. Dunkquist heads to LA to make his dreams of stardom come true, no matter what it takes (and chances are, it will take something dark, disturbing, and altogether obsessive and unsavory).\n\nJody Hill will direct “Famous,” his first feature since 2018’s “The Legacy Of A Whitetail Deer Hunter.” Hill is best known for his TV work, including “Peacemaker,” “Eastbound And Down,” and “Vice Princpals.” He also directed episodes of “The Righteous Gemstones.” His other film include “Observe And Report” and “The Foot Fist Way,” with a bit cameo in 2007’s “Superbad.” But Hill won’t pen the script for his upcoming feature, like he did on his past three. Instead, Chad Hodges adapts Crouch’s novel for the big screen. It’s the third time Hodges adapts Crouch’s work after making the “Wayward Pines” trilogy into a TV series, and “Good Behavior” into a series, too. Hodge earned a WGA nod for his work on “Good Behavior.”\n\nSam Esmail produces “Famous” with Chad Hamilton through their Esmail Corp. banner. Esmail is coming off of producing “Leave The World Behind” for Netflix. As noted earlier, Black Bear handles the film’s international sales with CAA Finance, while WME Independent deals with its US rights.\n\nEfron is coming off arguably his most well-regarded acting performance yet as Kevin Von Erich in “The Iron Claw,” so he’s a hot commodity right now. And that makes “Famous” an appealing choice for the actor, considering “Ricky Stanicky” sees him return to territory adjacent to “Bad Grandpa” and “A Family Affair” may as well be a sequel to 2012’s “The Paperboy.” “Famous” sounds like something more pulpy, even trashy, compared to “The Iron Claw,” but it could see Efron lean into Ted Bundy territory as he did for “Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil, And Vile.” Many people liked that (for some reason, this writer thought many overrated that performance), so maybe “Famous” will capture a similar vibe.\n\nIf “Famous” starts shooting before midyear, expect it out in theaters in early 2025."
