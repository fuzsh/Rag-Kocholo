        "text": "Wildcats everywhere, wave your hands up in the air!\n\nZac Efron returned to East High from ‚ÄúHigh School Musical,‚Äù the hit Disney franchise that made him a household name.\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ Forget about me ‚úäüèº,‚Äù the actor captioned an Instagram post Friday that showed him posing in front of the Salt Lake City school.\n\nThough Efron seemed to be referencing the Simple Minds song from the iconic 1985 teen flick ‚ÄúThe Breakfast Club,‚Äù his followers expressed hope that the post meant a ‚ÄúHSM‚Äù-related project is in the works.\n\n‚ÄúOMG please tell me a reunion is happening!‚Äù one fan wrote, while another added, ‚ÄúThe way I need a reboot with you to happen! Troy forever ily Zac üíï.‚Äù\n\nSeveral fans noted that Efron‚Äôs ex and former co-star Vanessa Hudgens posted social media footage of her in front of East High just last month.\n\n‚ÄúBut but but‚Ä¶ Vanessa posted a similar one a few weeks ago. What does this mean?‚Äù someone asked.\n\nAnother individual surmised that Efron, 34, and Hudgens, 33, could be making cameos on Disney+‚Äôs ‚ÄúHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI hope this means you and Vanessa are guest starring on HSMTMTS,‚Äù another person wrote.\n\nThe pair memorably played lovebirds Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez in the three ‚ÄúHSM‚Äù films, which were released between 2006 and 2008. Efron and Hudgens proceeded to date in real life, though they ultimately called it quits in 2010.\n\n‚ÄúRight off the bat, we had a connection,‚Äù the ‚ÄúSay OK‚Äù singer told Glamour the year they split. ‚ÄúI think everybody could see it. When we had our audition, they paired us together. And he was adorable.‚Äù\n\nAlthough things reportedly ended amicably, Hudgens told ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood Live‚Äù in 2017 that she and Efron eventually stopped talking.\n\n‚ÄúOh, yeah, no ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not a thing that happens,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúI completely lost contact with him.‚Äù\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Efron reconnects with Hudgens at East High.\n\nMeanwhile, like most of his fans, the Hollywood hunk‚Äôs old TV dad and basketball coach is happy to see him back in Wildcats territory.\n\n‚ÄúWarms coaches ole heart to see this,‚Äù commented actor Bart Johnson, who played Coach Jack Bolton. ‚ÄúWelcome home, son. WHAT TEAM!? üèÄüêæ.‚Äù"
