The official currency of the Philippines is the peso, or ‘piso’ in Filipino - abbreviated to PHP.

Philippine banknotes and coins are minted exclusively by the Central Bank of the Philippines or Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in Quezon City. The peso has been used in its current form since 1949.

1 peso is divided into 100 centavos, and the most popular bills for Philippine peso are the 20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 notes.
