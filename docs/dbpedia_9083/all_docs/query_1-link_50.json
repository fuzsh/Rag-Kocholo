        "text": "Facts about the currency\n\nThe smallest currency unit is called ‘centavo’ in Philippine English. Following the adoption of the “Pilipino series” in 1967, it became officially known as “sentimo” in Filipino.\n\nIn 2009, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) announced that it had launched a massive redesign for current banknotes and coins to further enhance security features and improve durability.\n\nIn the 1950s, the exchange rate was 2 pesos against the US dollar. The fluctuating free rate was abolished in 1965 and several devaluations followed.\n\nA 10% service charge is automatically added to the bill at some restaurants, but leaving a little extra tip is always appreciated.\n\nTravellers entering the Philippines are limited to taking up to 10,000 pesos without prior authority from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (the central bank of the Philippines). The same restriction applies when you leave. If you’re carrying any foreign currency in excess of US 10,000, it must be declared."
