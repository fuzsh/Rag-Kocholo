        "text": "Pesos in your pocket\n\nThe peso, in one form or another, has been around for centuries. It was in 1521 when the Spanish arrived at the shores of the Philippines and replaced the trading of gold for goods in favour of a more formalised currency.\n\nIf your restaurant bill has the letters ‘SC’ on it, this means a service charge has been added already, and you therefore don’t need to leave an extra tip. However, if not, a tip of 10% would be very much appreciated. Just ensure that you give any tips directly to your serving staff, since otherwise they may end up not benefitting at all from your generosity.\n\nFrequently used banknotes\n\nBanknotes used include 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 PHP. Coins used often are for 1, 5 and 10 PHP, with coins in cents rare due to their low value.\n\nToday’s pesos come in many denominations, including the 20 PHP bill, which features the Philippines’ second president, Manuel L. Quezon, on the note.\n\nIf you want to get around with a debit or credit card, keep in mind that there aren’t too many Filipino retailers who accept payments via MasterCard, Visa or other international providers."
