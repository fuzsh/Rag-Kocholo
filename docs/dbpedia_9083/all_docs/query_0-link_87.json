Governor Eli Remolona on the same day said the central bank tends to allow currency adjustments to happenBloomberg Terminal unless the movements are very sharp. On Monday, he said he’s comfortable with the peso’s current level and that the central bank has hardly been intervening in the foreign-currency market."
