        "text": "By Jude Aldrich Allaga\n\nIt takes only an American dollar to feed a child dinner, but a Philippine peso to leave them starving for the night. This is the plight of today’s Philippine Peso: how its value in the foreign market dictates which Filipinos can get by, but more so, who won’t.\n\nThe Peso’s Pedigree\n\nWhat once was labeled as “salapi,” the Philippine currency was represented by gold bits used within the country’s rural island communities, until the Spaniards introduced the “Spanish Peso,” becoming the primary currency in 1565. The “salapi” was retained but seen only as a half-peso coin.\n\nThe “centavo” coin was introduced once the Philippines claimed its independence in 1898, but lost its usage during the American colonization. Spanning two world wars and Japanese occupation, the Philippines finally regained its independence in 1946 and established the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas three years later.\n\nNow, we retain the “Peso” currency, with “centavo” as our “sentimo” or monetary subunit.\n\nExplaining the External Exchange\n\nThe Philippine Peso maintains its foreign relations, however, as it can be exchanged into different values depending on other currencies; this is the “exchange rate,” which, described by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, is “the price of a unit of foreign currency in terms of the domestic currency.”\n\nThis exchange rate links international markets and investors and affects the price and inflation of basic commodities such as salt, rice, and sugar and imports such as crude oil. Its demand, or appreciation, alongside its depreciation, or devaluing, holds weight and cements the Philippines in the international bank. Furthermore, an appreciation or depreciation of the Peso impacts trade, service costs, and other external sectors.\n\nYet, despite the mandate that both the government and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas may have on our monetary exchange, they cannot dictate the exchange rate, but the Philippine Peso’s participation in the foreign exchange market does.\n\nFor instance, when buying US dollars while demand for it is quite low, it would cost less than when buying US dollars for imports. Thus, an appreciation for the US dollar would mean a depreciation of the Philippine Peso. Aside from demand and devaluation, however, many other factors contribute to our current fluctuations in exchange rates.\n\nTies of Trade\n\nIn relation to the demand for currency, demand for a country’s exports can likewise increase, making their currency more appreciated or “firmer.” In other words, an increase in Philippine exportation would require less Philippine Pesos per US Dollar. The Philippines, which heavily relies on imports however, suffers tremendously as a demand for the US Dollar rises instead.\n\n1) Socioeconomic Stability"
