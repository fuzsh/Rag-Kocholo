        "text": "By Ditas Lopez\n\nThe Philippine peso’s resilience to the global pandemic poses a risk to an economy that is forecast to contract in 2020, with the currency expected to remain largely stable by the end of the year.\n\nThe peso is one of only two emerging currencies that haven’t suffered losses this year, with declines exceeding 20% in some of its peers like in Brazil and South Africa. The local currency is projected to end the year at 51 per dollar, according to the median of April estimates in a Bloomberg survey. It climbed to as high as 50.40 on Thursday, the strongest level since January.\n\nThe currency’s resilience is making the nation’s exports become relatively more expensive, in a world where global demand is falling amid virus-induced lockdowns. A weaker currency would also boost the value of remittances, a key source of consumption and which the World Bank expects to contract by about 13% this year.\n\n“A weak peso will be helpful for remittance beneficiaries, which could in turn help bolster sagging consumption,” said Nicholas Mapa, economist at ING Groep NV in Manila.\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is committed to a free floating exchange rate policy regardless of the peso’s direction, Governor Benjamin Diokno said. “We participate in the FX market only when there is a need to smoothen volatility,” he said in a mobile-phone message.\n\nForeign reserves climbed to a record $89 billion in March, a report on Thursday showed, signaling authorities didn’t aggressively intervene to support the peso last month when a global financial market meltdown sent risky assets crashing.\n\nRoland Avante, president of Philippine Business Bank, said the peso has remained resilient as imports are weak with most companies shut and oil prices and demand low. The government’s recent $2.35 billion bond sale and loans from multilateral institutions also provide support.\n\nMoney sent home by Filipinos working abroad reached a record $30.1 billion last year, equal to about 10% of the country’s gross domestic product.\n\n© 2020 Bloomberg L.P."
