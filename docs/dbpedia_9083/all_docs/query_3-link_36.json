        "text": "The countries you can sell to and the currencies customers can use to pay you.\n\nThe countries you can sell in and the currency you can accept depend on the payment processor you connect to your store. Your store can only accept one currency at a time.\n\nThis guide covers Stripe and PayPal’s supported countries and currencies, and answers questions you may have if you use Squarespace Commerce outside the US.\n\nWho can shop in my store?\n\nYou can accept our payment methods from anywhere in the world where they're supported. We don't impose additional location restrictions for shoppers buying products from your store.\n\nInternational shoppers in some countries may be charged additional fees by their banks. Visit Stripe and PayPal’s documentation for more information.\n\nDoes Squarespace Commerce support my country?\n\nIt depends on how you accept payments. To accept payments, you'll need to connect a payment processor that supports your country. You can connect Stripe, PayPal, or both.\n\nStripe's supported countries\n\nVisit Stripe’s Global page to see a list of their supported countries. Countries are classified in three ways:\n\nLive: These countries have full support and access to all Stripe features. Anyone can sign up and create an account.\n\nOpen Preview: Preview countries may not include all Stripe features. Anyone can sign up and create an account.\n\nClosed Preview: Closed preview countries may not include all Stripe features. Closed previews are by invitation only. You can request an invite on Stripe's Global page.\n\nTo learn more Stripe's country previews, visit their documentation.\n\nArgentina, Colombia, Indonesia, and South Africa\n\nWhile Stripe supports the national currencies for these countries, it's not currently possible to create a Stripe account in these locations. This means that to sell in ARS, COP, IDR and ZAR your Stripe account must be located elsewhere, in a supported country in their core network. Stripe's extended network of African countries, including South Africa, is powered by Paystack, which Squarespace doesn't support.\n\nPayPal’s supported countries\n\nVisit PayPal’s Global page to see a list of their supported countries.\n\nDoes Squarespace support my currency?\n\nNote: In some countries, like in South Africa and Indonesia, it's not possible to create a Stripe account even if the national currency is supported by Stripe. Check Stripe's global page to see if you can create a Stripe account in your country.\n\nSquarespace currently supports these currencies:\n\nArgentine Peso (ARS) - (Stripe only, with limitations)\n\nAustralian dollars (AUD)\n\nBrazilian Real (BRL)\n\nBritish pound (GBP)\n\nCanadian dollars (CAD)\n\nColombian Peso (COP) - (Stripe only, with limitations)\n\nCzech Republic koruna (CZK)\n\nDanish krone (DKK)\n\nEuro (EUR)\n\nHong Kong dollar (HKD)\n\nIndian Rupee (INR)\n\nIndonesian Rupiah (IDR) - (Stripe only, with limitations)\n\nIsraeli shekel (ILS)\n\nJapanese yen (JPY)\n\nMalaysian ringgit (MYR)\n\nMexican peso (MXN)\n\nNew Zealand dollar (NZD)\n\nNorwegian krone (NOK)\n\nPhilippine peso (PHP)\n\nPolish zloty (PLN)\n\nRussian ruble (RUB)\n\nSingapore dollar (SGD)\n\nSouth African Rand (ZAR) - (Stripe only, with limitations)\n\nSwedish krona (SEK)\n\nSwiss franc (CHF)\n\nThai baht (THB)\n\nUS dollars (USD)\n\nYou can choose one currency for your store. All Squarespace Commerce charges (orders, taxes, and shipping) will be processed in your store currency.\n\nNote: Stripe and Paypal support other currencies that aren’t currently available for Squarespace Commerce.\n\nStripe’s supported currencies\n\nAfter connecting a Stripe account to Squarespace, your store will automatically update to display the currency associated with your Stripe account, if that currency is supported by Squarespace. You can change this currency at any time.\n\nThe available currencies depend on where your connected bank account is located.\n\nU.S., U.K., Australian, and European bank accounts support all currencies listed above.\n\nCanadian bank accounts only support USD and CAD.\n\nIndian bank accounts only support INR.\n\nMexican bank accounts only support MXN.\n\nNew Zealand bank accounts only support NZD.\n\nStripe charges a conversion fee for transactions in a currency that isn’t associated with your bank account. The conversion fee varies, but it's about 2% on top of the regular transaction fees. To learn about this, visit Stripe's documentation.\n\nTip: If your country supports multiple currencies, we recommend choosing the currency used by the bank account connected to your Stripe account. Funds in that currency will go to that account with no conversion fee.\n\nPayPal supported currencies\n\nAfter connecting a PayPal Business account to your Squarespace site, your store will automatically update to display your PayPal Business account’s primary currency, if that currency is supported by Squarespace. You can change this currency at any time.\n\nPayPal charges a conversion fee for changing currencies. To learn about this, visit PayPal’s documentation.\n\nPayPal doesn't support these currencies:\n\nArgentine Peso (ARS)\n\nColombian Peso (COP)\n\nIndian Rupee (INR)\n\nIndonesian Rupiah (IDR)\n\nSouth African Rand (ZAR)\n\nPayPal has limited support for these currencies:\n\nMalaysian ringgit (MYR) - Supported by Malaysian PayPal accounts only\n\nTip: If your country supports multiple currencies, we recommend choosing the currency set as your primary currency in your PayPal Business account.\n\nWhere can I ship my products?\n\nYou can ship your products anywhere in the world, as long as your mail carrier supports it. We have integrations with USPS, UPS, and FedEx, but you can use any carrier you’d like by setting up flat rate shipping options, which charge your customers a set amount at checkout to cover your shipping costs.\n\nCan I collect VAT or GST?\n\nYes. Squarespace supports tax-inclusive pricing and customizable order receipts. For help setting this up, visit Collecting VAT or GST.\n\nCan I change my store currency?\n\nYes. After connecting a payment processor to your Squarespace site, you'll see all available currencies for your account in the Store payments panel. To learn more, visit Changing your store's currency.\n\nCan I choose a different store currency than my bank account (Stripe) or primary currency (PayPal)?\n\nYou can sell in a currency that isn't linked to your bank account. However, your payment processor may charge a conversion fee for each transaction. You can review the fee and more details on Stripe’s pricing page and PayPal’s user agreement.\n\nCan I choose multiple currencies for my store?\n\nNo. You can only sell in one currency for your store at this time. Your payment processor determines the available store currencies. If you’ve connected both Stripe and PayPal, a currency must be supported by both the bank account connected to your Stripe account and by PayPal to display in the drop-down menu.\n\nWhat if my country isn't supported by Stripe or PayPal?\n\nStripe and PayPal are the only integrated payment processors we support. To use Squarespace Commerce, you must have a bank account (for Stripe) or PayPal account based in a country supported by one of these providers.\n\nIf your country isn’t currently supported by Stripe, connect PayPal only. Stripe is continually adding support for new countries. You can view their documentation here.\n\nGet notified about updates\n\nTo receive notifications about new currency and country options in Squarespace, open a ticket with this information:\n\nSubject - Currency/Country commerce Request\n\nYour domain name or Squarespace URL\n\nYour email address\n\nThe currency and country you need Squarespace to support\n\n</>"
