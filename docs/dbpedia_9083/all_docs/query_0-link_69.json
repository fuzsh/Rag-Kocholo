The national and official currency of the Philippines is the Philippine Peso which is abbreviated as PHP.\n\n2. Since the Philippines was a former U.S.A colony, they used English besides \"peso\" on notes and coinage until 1967.\n\n3. PHP went through a considerable devaluation due to the pegged system but after the 1993 New Central Bank Act it became free-floating.\n\n4. This action ushered more stability to Philippine Pesos and eliminated the black market."
