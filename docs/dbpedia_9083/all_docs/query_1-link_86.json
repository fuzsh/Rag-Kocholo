In particular, micro-printed details using laser-engraving technology were included in the two highest denominated coins, the 10-Piso and 5-Piso, which makes it difficult for these coins to be duplicated using traditional coin counterfeiting methods. The metallic composition of the NGC coins also discourages the illegal practice of hoarding large quantities of coins for the extraction of their metal content.\n\nThe coins, which appear as “metallic silver”, are made from durable nickel-plated steel that possess very good wear and corrosion resistance. The change in material addresses concerns on discoloration predominantly observed for copper-based metals.\n\nCoins in the NGC Series feature the new BSP logo, three national heroes (Apolinario Mabini in the 10-Piso, Andres Bonifacio in the 5-Piso and Jose Rizal in the 1-Piso), a stylized Philippine flag in the 25-, 5- and 1-Sentimo, and Philippine endemic flora.\n\nInnovation of the design\n\nUniqueness"
