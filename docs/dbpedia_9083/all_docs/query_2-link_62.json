        "text": "What Is Fiat Money?\n\nFiat money is a government-issued currency that's not backed by a physical commodity such as gold or silver. It's backed by the government that issues it. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand and the stability of the issuing government rather than the worth of a commodity backing it.\n\nMost modern paper currencies are fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar, the euro, and other major global currencies.\n\nUnderstanding Fiat Money\n\nThe term \"fiat\" is a Latin word that's often translated as \"it shall be\" or \"let it be done.\" Fiat currencies only have value because the government maintains that value. There's no utility to fiat money in itself.\n\nGovernments would mint coins out of a valuable physical commodity such as gold or silver before fiat currency came about. They might have printed paper money that could be redeemed for a set amount of a physical commodity. Fiat is inconvertible, however. It can't be redeemed because there's no underlying commodity backing it.\n\nFiat money isn't linked to physical reserves such as a national stockpile of gold or silver so it risks losing value due to inflation. It might even become worthless in the event of hyperinflation. The rate of inflation can double in a single day in some of the worst cases of hyperinflation, such as in Hungary immediately after WWII.\n\nThe money will no longer hold value if people lose faith in a nation's currency unlike a currency backed by gold. This type of currency has intrinsic value because of the demand for gold in jewelry and decoration as well as in the manufacturing of electronic devices, computers, and aerospace vehicles.\n\nHistory of Fiat Money in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is considered to be both fiat money and legal tender. It's accepted for private and public debts. Legal tender is any currency that a government declares to be legal. Many governments issue a fiat currency and then make it legal tender by setting it as the standard for debt repayment.\n\nThe country's currency was backed by gold and in some cases silver earlier in U.S. history. The federal government stopped allowing citizens to exchange currency for government gold with the passage of the Emergency Banking Act of 1933. The gold standard backed U.S. currency with federal gold but it ended completely in 1971 when the U.S. also stopped issuing gold to foreign governments in exchange for U.S. currency.\n\nU.S. dollars have been backed by the \"full faith and credit\" of the U.S. government since that time. They're \"legal tender for all debts, public and private\" but not \"redeemable in lawful money at the United States Treasury or at any Federal Reserve Bank,\" as the printing on U.S. dollar bills used to claim. U.S. dollars are \"legal tender\" rather than \"lawful money\" in this sense, which can be exchanged for gold, silver, or any other commodity.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Fiat Money\n\nAdvantages Explained\n\nFiat currencies gained prominence in the 20th century in part because governments and central banks sought to insulate their economies from the worst effects of the natural booms and busts of the business cycle.\n\nFiat money isn't a scarce or fixed resource like gold so central banks have much greater control over its supply. This gives them the power to manage economic variables such as credit supply, liquidity, interest rates, and money velocity. The U.S. Federal Reserve has the dual mandate to keep unemployment and inflation low and using fiat money can help it meet those goals.\n\nFiat money serves as a good currency if it can handle the roles that a nation's economy requires of its monetary unit: storing value, providing a numerical account, and facilitating exchange. It also has excellent seigniorage. It's more cost-efficient to produce than a currency that's directly tied to a commodity.\n\nDisadvantages Explained\n\nThe mortgage crisis of 2007 and subsequent financial meltdown tempered the belief that central banks could necessarily prevent depressions or serious recessions by regulating the money supply.\n\nA currency tied to gold is generally more stable than fiat money because of the limited supply of gold.\n\nExamples of Fiat Money\n\nThe U.S. dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Albanian lek, and the Indian rupee are all examples of fiat money. It's a currency that's backed by an issuing government so fiat money usually provides some economic stability, but not always.\n\nThe African nation of Zimbabwe provided an example of the worst-case scenario in the early 2000s. The country's central bank began to print money at a staggering pace in response to serious economic problems, resulting in hyperinflation.\n\nExperts suggest that the currency lost 99.9% of its value during this time. Prices rose rapidly and consumers carried bags full of money just to purchase basic staples. The government of Zimbabwe was forced to issue a 100-trillion Zimbabwean dollar note at the height of the crisis. Foreign currencies were eventually used more widely than the Zimbabwean dollar.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
