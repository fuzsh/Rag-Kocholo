        "text": "Currency in the Philippines\n\nA Travel Money Guide to the Philippines\n\nRelax on the pristine beaches of Boracay Islands, swim with gentle whale sharks of Cebu, trek through the mud-walled rice terraces in Banuae or take in the sights of Manilla are all enticing reasons to visit the Philippines. But it isn’t a budget destination and to get the most out of your trip, it’s a good idea to learn everything you can about the local currency and payment options before you go.\n\nLearn more about the Philippine currency and how to get your hands on it for the best value:\n\nWhat currency is used in the Philippines\n\nHow to buy Philippine Peso before you go\n\nAUD to PHP exchange rates\n\nCurrency exchange in the Philippines\n\nHow much do things cost in the Philippines\n\nUsing bank cards in the Philippines\n\nWhat Currency is Used in the Philippines?\n\nThe official currency in the Philippines is the Philippine Peso, which is represented with symbol ₱ and the international code PHP.\n\nThe Philippines currency has 6 banknotes have 7 denominations: ₱5, ₱10 ₱20, ₱50, ₱100, ₱200, ₱500 and ₱1000.\n\nPhilippine peso can be divided into 100 centavos and has 4 coin denominations: 1¢ 5¢, 10¢ and 25¢.\n\nUsing Your Bank Card in the Philippines\n\nMost Filipino businesses are well set up to receive card payments. Some of the best travel money cards include debit, credit and prepaid cards. But before you use your bank card willy-nilly, it’s worth reading up on the fees and charges you might incur.\n\nDebit Cards\n\nYou’ll probably want a debit card if you plan to withdraw money from an ATM. While you may also be able to pay with a debit card in some businesses in the major destinations, you might discover some hefty fees on your account summary.\n\nDepending on your bank, you could be hit with fees for foreign ATM withdrawals or currency conversions. But some banks are better than others; we recommend checking out Wise, ING and Revolut, all of which have travel-friendly debit cards that waive these charges.\n\nCredit Cards\n\nCredit cards can come with some enticing perks, including added security, loyalty programs, and even free travel insurance.\n\nBut are they worth it?\n\nMajor local businesses, including hotels, restaurants, airline offices, and department stores, accept credit cards. But you might have to pay a surcharge.\n\nMastercard and Visa are widely accepted. You may also be able to use your American Express card, though local ATMs won’t accept them.\n\nJust be aware of additional charges you may incur for foreign transactions. These could include:\n\nInternational transaction fees\n\nHigh exchange rate margins\n\nATM fees\n\nPotential ‘cash advance fees’ if you use an ATM\n\nIf you still prefer credit cards over any other payment, consider going with a company that offers cards that waive certain travel fees. Bankwest Platinum and 28 Degrees both have travel-friendly cards.\n\nPrepaid Travel Cards\n\nThe biggest advantages of prepaid travel cards are that you can lock in a favourable exchange rate. You also get a handy back-up card.\n\nJust remember that while they are convenient, you could end up paying a long list of hidden fees. Many travel cards still impose:\n\nCurrency conversion fees\n\nUncompetitive exchange rates\n\nInternational ATM withdrawal fees\n\nInitial load fees\n\nReload fees\n\nInactivity fees\n\nHow to Buy Philippine Peso Before You Go\n\nThere’s a certain reassurance that comes with stepping off the plane (or cruise ship) already cashed up with Philippine Peso.\n\nBuying Philippine Peso before you leave Australian shores isn’t just convenient. It can also save you money. But it all depends on where you get your Philippine currency in Australia. There are three main options:\n\nBuy PHP online and have it delivered or collect it in-store\n\nSwap Philippines pesos for Australian dollars from a money changer\n\nBuy your Philippines currency at your home airport\n\nTry S Money or a similar online currency exchange store to get rates that reflect the comparisons you see on XE or Google.\n\nIf you choose online delivery or in-store pickup, check the processing time. Some exchange companies with online options suggest you allow between two and five days to process currency.\n\nPrefer in-store currency exchange? Head to the CBD of your nearest city for the most competitive exchange rates; suburban bureau de change outlets tend to have poorer rates and fees.\n\nCurrency exchange counters in Australia’s airports are infamous for their atrocious exchange rates. Avoid them if you can.\n\nAUD to PHP\n\nFrom\n\nAustralian Dollars (AUD)\n\n⇆\n\nTo\n\nPHP\n\nSo is this a good rate?\n\n38.0778\n\nLow\n\n36.8735 Average\n\n38.2735 High\n\n39.6735\n\nToday's rate is lower than the average rate to buy PHP. This chart compares today's rate to the average rate from the past 90 days.\n\nThe Average Cost to Travel Around the Philippines\n\nTo get the most out of your time in the Philippines, you’ll want to create a budget and make sure your savings stretch as far as possible.\n\nTo give you an idea of a reasonable budget, we’ve listed the average prices of some common items and experiences you’ll have while in the Philippines.\n\nThe average daily travel budget in the Philippines is about $160. Some of the expenses you might be looking at include:\n\n$100\n\nA room in a guesthouse\n\n$15\n\nTwo-course meal at a nice restaurant\n\n$3\n\nA local beer\n\n$0.50\n\nCar rental\n\n$42\n\nEntertainment\n\nHow to Exchange Currency in the Philippines\n\nPlaces like Manila, and Cebu City receive great numbers of tourists, so there are facilities to cater to money exchanges. Beyond these major destinations, it’s best to get cash before you venture into remote territory.\n\nATMs\n\nOutside the big cities finding an ATM can be difficult. You need to take cash to the islands as there might only be one internationally networked ATM in popular islands like Palawan or Panglao.\n\nCard skimming is an issue in the Philippines, so cover your hand when entering in your 4 digit pin. Bank of Philippines ad Banco de Oro are normally safe bets for tourists.\n\nDepending on your bank, you may have to pay for overseas ATM withdrawals and currency conversions. To reduce the amount you’ll pay in fees, try to withdraw just the right amount of money you’ll need for the duration of your trip.\n\nDon’t forget: Let your bank know you’re travelling! If they detect a foreign transaction but aren’t aware you’re overseas, they could end up freezing your card.\n\nCurrency Exchange in the Philippines\n\nThere are money changers in the Philippines and the safest are in major malls like SM (super malls), Robinsons (one of the largest shopping malls in the Philippines), SM Hypermarket and Savemore. However they don’t exchange from peso to dollar, its only dollar to peso.\n\nOther money changers are located in the big cities and not part of a chain ad tend to offer marginally better rates than banks as many banks charge flat fees per transaction. Most of them will have a board showing the exchange rates at the front of the shop.\n\nTravellers Cheques\n\nNot worth the bother! Travellers cheques are so outdated, very few banks even accept them any more.\n\nThey can’t be used as direct payment, so the only way to use them once you’re in the country is to swap them for currency at a bank or bureau de change office. Even then, very few banks will accept travellers cheques if you don’t have an account with them. And exchange services apply exorbitant fees and rates to them.\n\nTrack the best time to buy Philippine Peso\n\nWe match the currency exchange rate with the rate shown on Google or Xe. In real time.\n\nThis means you never pay over-inflated rates and can be 100% positive you are getting the most competitive rate for currency exchange.\n\nCheck out the daily rates:\n\nNot ready to buy yet?\n\nYou can get a free rate tracker!"
