        "text": "If you’re planning a trip to the U.S. in the near future, you may want to exchange some of your money into U.S. dollars, the country’s official currency. The international symbol for the currency is USD.\n\nThe U.S. dollar is the global reserve currency, which means foreign central banks hold it in their reserves in addition to their own currency. USD is used in about 40% of global trade and nearly 80% of all global cross-border transactions, with most commodities being traded in U.S. dollars.\n\nThis post has everything you need to know about converting PHP to USD, including where to secure the best exchange rates and how to avoid paying high fees on your conversion.\n\nHow to Convert PHP to USD\n\nCalculating a conversion of Philippine peso to U.S. dollar is fairly simple. You can either use a calculator or do it by hand.\n\n1. Use a Currency Calculator\n\nUsing a currency conversion calculator is often the easiest way to get an estimate when you’re converting currency. Since exchange rates fluctuate on a daily basis, using a calculator can ensure your math is correct.\n\nKeep in mind that exchanging currency often comes with added fees that a conversion calculator won’t be able to predict. For instance, credit card companies and ATM networks usually charge a 1% conversion fee on all foreign transactions. Individual merchants may also charge supplemental fees if you ask them to convert the price of an item to your home currency at checkout.\n\n2. Calculate it Manually\n\nThe other option is to do the calculation manually using a simple mathematical formula. However, in order to do this, you need to know the current exchange rate. At the time of writing, ₱1 is equal to $0.017.\n\nOnce you know that information, multiply the amount you have in PHP by the current exchange rate. The resulting number will show you the amount of dollars that you have to spend on your trip.\n\nManual Currency Conversion Example\n\nLet’s say you have ₱5,000 and would like to figure out how many dollars you have for a trip to the States. Using the current exchange rate, the formula for your conversion would look like this:\n\n₱5,000 PHP x 0.017 = $85 USD\n\nHow to Buy USD\n\nWhen you’re ready to buy USD, it’s a good idea to plan ahead to ensure that you pay the fewest fees. Here are two ways to get the currency you need while minimizing the fees you’ll be charged:\n\nExchange at a bank before your trip: Heading to your bank before your trip is often the most cost-effective way to exchange currency. Since you have an existing relationship with them, your bank is likely to give you the best exchange rates and charge the lowest fees. For example, BPI offers exchanges into multiple currencies, including USD, EUR and GBP.\n\nUse an ATM abroad for withdrawals: If you need to exchange more money while you’re on your trip, you can do so at an ATM. Be sure to check the fine print with your banking agreement to understand any exchange rate charges and out-of-network charges you may incur during a foreign ATM withdrawal.\n\nWhat to Avoid When Exchanging Currency\n\nExchanging currency at the airport: While exchanging currency at the airport is unquestionably convenient, these kiosks often offer some of the worst exchange rates while charging some of the highest fees.\n\nExchanging currency in a street kiosk: Some major American cities offer exchange kiosks that look like ATMs that allow you to exchange currency while on the go. Still, you’ll likely pay a premium to use one of these convenient locations.\n\nNext Up:"
