        "text": "Are you wondering if what is the official name of the currency of the Philippines? âPisoâ or âPesoâ. According to Section 48 of the Republic Act No. 7653 also known as âThe New Central Bank Actâ, âPesoâ is the unit of monetary value in the Philippines, which is represented by the sign \"P.\" The âPesoâ is divided into one hundred (100) equal parts called \"centavos,\" which are represented by the sign \"c.\"\n\nHowever, since 1967 for coins, and since 1969 for banknotes, Filipino Language has been used in our currency, including the term âPisoâ which has been translated from âPesoâ. This has been done to uphold and enrich our national language."
