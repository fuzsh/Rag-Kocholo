In this article, we’re going to show you how to get and convert Mexican pesos from U.S. dollars as well as some interesting facts about the almighty peso.\n\nWhat is a Peso?\n\nThe peso is a unit of currency in a number of countries and is the official currency of Mexico. A peso in terms of Mexican currency is a Mexican peso (sign: $; code: MXN) or peso méxicano in Spanish. One peso is the equivalent of one-hundred centavos (100¢ MXN).\n\nModern currencies that used the “peso” have a common origin in the Spanish dollar from the 15th-19th centuries. If you’ve ever wondered why pesos use the same symbol as the dollar, it’s because they share a common history.\n\nPeso in Spanish literally means “weight,” and originally referred to the Spanish real de a ocho, or “royal eight-real coin.” In the 19th century, the Mexican peso was equal to 8 reales. The term “peso” in this context used to refer to pesos oro (gold weights / gold peso) or pesos plata (silver weights / silver peso).\n\nThe gold content of the peso has varied over time. In 1821, the peso contained 2.48 grams of gold, but by 1873 it only contained 1.92 grams of gold. The gold content of the peso increased again in 1900, when it was fixed at 2.5 grams of gold. (This was the same gold content as the earlier Spanish real de a ocho). Since 1900, the gold content of the peso has remained fixed at 2.5 grams.\n\nThese days, pesos in circulation contain no gold or silver. Like the U.S., who stopped producing gold coins in 1933, and silver coins in 1965, Mexico stopped using precious metals in their coins shortly after in 1967.\n\nMexican Peso Symbol and Abbreviations\n\nOne common way to distinguish whether the “$” symbol refers to dollars or pesos is with the addition of MX before the “dollar” or “$” sign. An alternative to this convention is by adding the “MN” after the the value is written, e.g. $100 MN. The MN stands for Moneda Nacional, which means “National Currency.”\n\nIf you’re searching for real estate, you may see “mdp” after the value. This refers to millions of pesos. For example, 3.2 mdp means 3.2 milliones de pesos or 3.2 million pesos.\n\nMXN is the official ISO currency code for Mexican pesos. For comparison, the U.S. dollar’s ISO code is USD and the Canadian dollar is CAD. You can find all of the ISO currency codes here.\n\nHow to Get Mexican Pesos\n\nThere are a few different ways to get Mexican Pesos. The most common are:\n\nYou can exchange currency at most banks before you depart.\n\nYou can buy pesos from a currency exchange.\n\nYou can withdraw pesos from an ATM when you arrive.\n\nWhen traveling to Mexico, it’s a good idea to have some pesos on hand on arrival to cover expenses like taxis, tips, and souvenirs. Here are some of the most popular ways to get pesos.\n\nExchange Money at the Bank\n\nYour first option for exchanging for pesos is at certain banks. They usually have an exchange service, and you can use that prior to your trip. Most banks have pesos on hand so you can just go to the bank and get some pesos and you’ll be ready to go to Mexico. Smaller banks, however, might take time to order some in so make sure you go in advance in case your bank needs to order them for you.\n\nAll major banks offer a currency exchange service. These include:\n\nBank of America\n\nWells Fargo\n\nCitibank\n\nChase\n\nU.S. Bank\n\nMany international banks also offer this service in the U.S., such as Barclays and UBS. It’s important to research the fees associated with each bank so you can get the best rate possible when exchanging your money. You should also check the hours and locations that the bank offers its services in order to make sure they are convenient for you. Order delivery times can vary, but most major banks typically advertise a 2-7 business days.\n\nVisit Currency Kiosks\n\nAnother way to get pesos is at the currency exchange kiosks that you can find at most airports. These can be at your departure airport or on arrival in Mexico.\n\nYou can also find them in most large cities (especially if the city is a popular tourist destination).\n\nJust keep in mind that these kiosks usually have a fee (either an extra fee or one built into the exchange rate) so they aren’t the best option if you’re on a budget. Airport kiosks are notorious for this.\n\nUse ATMs\n\nAnother easy way to convert your money for pesos is at ATMs. This is our preferred way of getting pesos when we are in Mexico. We get better rates when we use the ATM instead of going to the bank or exchanging money at the kiosks.\n\nJust avoid the ATMs at the airport whenever possible. Like the kiosks, the rates you get will be poor.\n\nUse Wise to Convert Dollars to Pesos\n\nOur favorite service for international money conversion is Wise. Wise is a money transfer service that allows users to send and receive money in over 40 different currencies. One of the supported currencies is Mexican Pesos (MXN).\n\nTo convert dollars to pesos using Wise, simply create a free account and enter the amount of USD you want to convert. The exchange rate will be displayed, and you can complete the transaction by entering your bank account information.\n\nThis is one of our favorite ways of converting USD to MXN because of the ability to lock in the best currency exchange rate and make online payments to locals while we’re traveling. This makes paying our local vendors for our Spanish Immersion Retreats a breeze. Wise even offers a debit card that will give you two free ATM withdrawals each month.\n\nThe Cheapest Ways to Get Pesos\n\nIf you’re from the U.S, the cheapest way to pay in Mexican pesos is to not handle them at all! Paying with a travel credit card will almost always give you the best rate with no additional fees because U.S. travel cards generally don’t charge foreign transaction fees.\n\nPopular travel credit cards that offer no foreign exchange fees include:\n\nUnfortunately, if you’re from outside the U.S., most credit card companies don’t offer a no foreign transaction fee benefit.\n\nIf you need to get your hands on actual pesos, withdrawing from an ATM using a debit card that refunds your ATM fees is your best option. Since most banks charge $3-5 USD per withdrawal, you can save a ton of money over the course of your travels by using the right debit card.\n\nThis is actually what we recommend for most countries as outlined in our Ultimate Guide to Travel Banking.\n\nHow to Send Money to Mexico\n\nIf you’re trying to send money to a friend, family, or loved one in Mexico, one of your best options is with Wise. This can even be a good option if you’re trying to send money from your U.S. bank account to an account you have in Mexico while living abroad.\n\nWise has the lowest fees around, whether you need to transfer $10 or $10,000 USD. Their rates are generally better than PayPal too, which is why they are our go-to option.\n\nHowever, if you’re moving money to purchase real estate, keep in mind that the limit Mexican accounts can receive using this method is $1,976,693.5 MXN (roughly $94,900 USD).\n\nHow do you say ATM in Spanish?\n\nAn ATM is called a cajero automatico in Spanish. Sometimes this is shortened to cajero when enough context is given to specify that you are asking about an ATM. Cajero actually means “cashier,” so when you say cajero automatico, you’re literally saying “automatic cashier.”\n\nIf you want to ask where you can find an ATM in Spanish, you can say, “¿Dónde está el cajero automático?” – “Where is the ATM?”\n\nAlternatively, you can ask “¿Hay un cajero automático cerca de aquí?” – “Is there an ATM close to here?”\n\nNeed more help with directions? Learn more in our article and video about how to ask for directions in Spanish.\n\nHow to Exchange Pesos for Dollars\n\nAt the end of your visit to Mexico, you might find yourself with some spare pesos that you’d like to convert back into U.S. dollars. We’ve already shown you the cheapest way to get pesos, but how can you exchange them back for dollars? Here’s what you can do with leftover foreign currency.\n\nThe cheapest way to convert your extra pesos back into dollars is by bringing them back to the United States. As mentioned previously, banks usually have the best conversion rates, and several larger banks (such as Wells Fargo) are happy to help reconvert your money for you.\n\nWith banks, you’ll get a far better rate than anything you’ll find in Mexico in terms of exchange kiosks. The mark-up is almost always built into the conversion rate. Always beware of exchanges that claim to do it for “no fee.”\n\nBut if you don’t want to go through the extra hassle of converting your pesos, holding on to them until your next trip isn’t a bad idea either. Especially if you plan to be back in less than a year or two.\n\nWe tend to hold on to some pesos in between trips just so that we have cash as soon as we get back into Mexico. It’s nice to not have to look for an ATM right away and have enough money for a few tacos when we land.\n\nHow to Convert US Dollars (USD) and Mexican Pesos (MXN) in Your Head\n\nOnce you have your hands on some pesos it’s helpful to know how much you’ll be spending with this easy formula. Right now in 2022, one U.S. dollar equals about 20 pesos. The daily conversion may vary slightly, but 20 pesos to the dollar makes it really easy to convert.\n\nIf you’re going to buy something that’s 500 pesos, all you need to do is:\n\nMove the decimal point over one digit to the left — which will leave you with 50.\n\nCut that in half. That’s how much it is going to be in U.S. dollars.\n\nSo, half of fifty is twenty-five dollars.\n\nTechnically, 500 MXN = 25.86 USD (at the time of writing), so a rough calculation of $25 is pretty accurate.\n\nIf you have 50 U.S. dollars and you want to convert that to pesos, all you need to do is move the decimal point over the other way and double it. So, 50 dollars means adding a zero at the end, giving you 500. Double that and you’re looking at about a thousand pesos.\n\n$50 USD = 965 MXN, so, again, that’s a pretty accurate quick calculation you can do when you’re out and about.\n\nMexican Peso Currency Denominations\n\nThe current Mexican coins in existence are 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, as well as 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 pesos.\n\nThe current Mexican bills in existence are 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 pesos.\n\nYes, there is a 20 pesos coin and a 20 pesos bill. The bill is much more common.\n\nThe 1,000 Pesos Bill\n\nYou probably won’t get to see this bill when you’re here in Mexico because it’s not very common, but it is real. However, if you happen to come into possession of one, know that most small stores will not have change for it. (As mentioned above, 1,000 MXN is roughly $50 USD).\n\nMexican Coin Values\n\nWe covered how to convert pesos in your head above, but if you’re still stuck, it might help you think about it in another way. In the USA, we have dollars and cents, and in Mexico, there are pesos and centavos (cents). Just as 100 cents make up a dollar in US currency, 100 cents make up one peso in Mexican currency.\n\nTo keep things simple, let’s say 20 Mexican pesos is roughly equal to one U.S. dollar. Then the Mexican coins you’ll encounter are worth:\n\n5 centavos ($0.05 MXN) = $0.002 USD\n\n10 centavos ($0.10 MXN) = $0.005 USD\n\n20 centavos ($0.20 MXN) = $0.01 USD\n\n50 centavos ($0.50 MXN) = $0.02 USD)\n\nAs mentioned in the denominations section above, Mexico also has several peso coins. Remember, each whole peso is worth 100 centavos. That means these peso coins are worth roughly the following:\n\n1 peso ($1.00 MXN) = $0.05 USD\n\n2 pesos ($2.00 MXN) = $0.10 USD\n\n5 pesos ($5.00 MXN) = $0.25 USD\n\n10 pesos ($10.00 MXN) = $0.50 USD\n\n20 pesos ($20.00 MXN) = $1.00 USD\n\nBear in mind, these values are using a conversation rate of $1 USD = $20 MXN to illustrate the rough value of pesos to dollars. This works well for estimating the cost of small items. However, the actual exchange rate varies daily.\n\nInflation in Mexico\n\nLike the U.S., inflation in Mexico has been relatively high in recent years. Consumer prices rose by an average of 8.4% in 2022, according to the country’s National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI). This was the highest inflation rate since 2008, when prices rose by 7.3%.\n\nThe main drivers of inflation in Mexico are rising food and energy prices. Food prices have been rising due to a combination of bad weather and increased demand from China. Energy prices have also been rising due to higher global oil prices.\n\nWhile some of these factors are beyond the control of the Mexican government, it has taken steps to try and keep inflation under control. These include raising interest rates and increasing government spending on social programs.\n\nSo far, these measures have helped to some degree. However, if food and energy prices continue to rise, it could put upward pressure on inflation and cause it to rise again in the future.\n\nThe Mexican Peso has been a relatively stable currency compared to other Latin American countries. This is due to a number of factors, including Mexico’s strong economic ties with the United States, and the Mexican government’s commitment to maintaining a stable peso.\n\nIn recent years, the peso has been fairly stable against the U.S. Dollar, and has even appreciated somewhat. This has helped to insulate Mexico from some of the economic turmoil experienced by other Latin American countries.\n\nThe Value of Old Mexican Pesos\n\nBefore MXN, there was MXP – the original Mexican Peso. This currency ISO was phased out to make using money in Mexico more manageable. Old Mexican Pesos (MXP) are obsolete. The standard currency you see today in Mexico is what is referred to as the Nuevo Peso or “New Peso” (hence the “N” in “MXN”). This transition from the old peso officially took place on January 1, 1993. Essentially, the new peso erased three zeros off the old peso to clean up the effect of years of inflation.\n\n1,000 MXP is the equivalent of 1 MXN. That’s roughly $0.05 USD at current rates.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for people who have been traveling to Mexico for decades to still be in possession of some old pesos, not realizing that their value is actually much less than what it appears on the bill when factoring in the transition to the new peso.\n\nThe old peso bills and coins are no longer accepted as cash within the general population, however, they still can be cashed in for the modern value equivalent in new pesos at the Bank of Mexico.\n\nHow much are old pesos worth exactly?\n\nWhile some collectors might place a higher value on rare or misprinted coins and bills, the value of most old pesos can be figured out quite easily on your own.\n\nSimply follow these three steps to convert old Mexican pesos (MXP) to new Mexican pesos (MXN) and then into US dollars (USD).\n\nTally up the total of the bills and coins you have\n\nMove the total three decimal places to the left\n\nEnter the result in the MXN field here or by using the currency converter above\n\nAlternatively, you can see the conversion for each of the old Mexican peso bills directly from the Bank of Mexico here.\n\nIs $100 USD a lot of money in Mexico?\n\nA popular question for people interested in visiting Mexico is how far $100 USD goes there. This is a difficult question to answer as it involves many factors such as where you plan to visit and what your standard of living is. But we’ll give you an idea of what you can expect for pricing in general in Mexico.\n\nThe overall cost of living in Mexico is roughly half that of the United States, so a quick “back of the envelope” calculation for what most things will cost there can be done by taking the price of a similar public utility or living expense in the U.S. (not including electronics) and dividing by two. Obviously, this guesstimation will be different depending on where you plan to visit. Colima, for example, is generally cheaper than Quintana Roo in the same way that Cincinnati is cheaper than New York City.\n\nThe average inexpensive meal at a restaurant in Mexico costs roughly $100 pesos (~$4.73 USD), domestic beer is around $30 pesos (~$1.42 USD), and bottled water costs $11.52 pesos (~$0.54 USD). The cost of other typical expenses in Mexico can be found and compared here.\n\nAs of Jan 1, 2023, Mexico’s minimum wage was raised to $172.87 pesos per day. That means a Mexican working minimum wage would have to work at least 12 days to make the equivalent of $100 US Dollars. So, in short, $100 USD is a fair amount of money in Mexico, generally speaking.\n\nGetting Change in Mexico\n\nOne culture shock for many who visit Mexico for the first time is how difficult it can be to find a store or vendor who has change for larger bills. Oftentimes, 200 peso bills and larger will cause more trouble than they’re worth when purchasing cheaper items. You’ll find that ten-peso coins are often more valuable than they look as it’s much easier to get change for purchases using smaller denominations.\n\nThis does not mean that larger bills are useless. Just keep in mind that if you’re making a purchase that requires getting fifty to one hundred or more pesos back in change to try to use the smallest denominations you can to help assure that you’re able to make the transaction.\n\nOften, if you do not have the correct change or close to it, a vendor may ask you to wait a moment while they run next door to see if a neighboring establishment can break a larger bill.\n\nTips for Spotting Counterfeit Mexican Banknotes\n\nSpotting counterfeit Mexican banknotes can be tricky, but there are a few tips that can help.\n\nFirst, look closely at the note and make sure all of the details are correct. Check for any discrepancies in the design, such as a missing or incorrect security feature.\n\nAdditionally, check to see if all of the colors on the note match up correctly and if there are any inconsistencies in the paper itself. Take special care when examining the serial numbers, as each genuine Mexican banknote should have its own unique number.\n\nAnother tip is to hold the note up to a light source and look for any watermark images that might be present.\n\nFinally, observe carefully how it feels in your hand; genuine notes should feel crisp and new while counterfeits often feel slightly rough or worn. By following these simple tips you can easily recognize counterfeit Mexican banknotes.\n\nIn our experience, counterfeit currency in Mexico is rare. However, that doesn’t mean you’ll never come across a counterfeit bill, so you should always be cautious.\n\nFeatures for the Visually Impaired\n\nMexican banknotes feature a number of elements to help those with impaired vision identify their bills. These features include raised numbers and letters on each bill, as well as a tactile feature in the shape of an owl’s head on the 500 peso note. The raised numbers and letters help those with impaired vision to distinguish between different denominations. The tactile feature, which is in the shape of an owl’s head, helps users to locate the denomination without needing to look at it.\n\nBanknotes also feature larger fonts, making them easier to read for those with low vision or other disabilities. Additionally, a special ink has been used that makes it easier for people with impaired vision to recognize color differences between denominations. Also, each denomination is a different length, making telling the difference between bills much easier.\n\nAll these features make it much easier for visually impaired individuals to be independent when handling money.\n\nTipping with Pesos in Mexico\n\nEver wonder whether you should tip in pesos or dollars? While many touristy cities in Mexico often have restaurants that accept payment in U.S. dollars, it’s usually a bad idea to pay in anything other than the local currency.\n\nThis is because in Mexico, many establishments that accept dollars are adding a significant markup to the currency exchange rate – often 10% or more. By tipping in foreign currency in Mexico, you’ll pay more and pass on the burden of exchanging money to the locals.\n\nAccepting foreign currency is generally less than ideal for the locals because most places in Mexico only accept Mexican pesos as payment. This means that whoever you’re tipping will have to spend their time finding a place to convert your tip into a local currency where they’ll likely not be getting a great conversation rate either.\n\nTime is money, and currency conversion kiosks are usually a rip-off. In our opinion, it’s best to tip in pesos.\n\nHow much should you tip? We answer that in our ultimate guide to tipping in Mexico. But the standard for restaurants and tours is generally 10-15%.\n\nWhat Colors are Mexican Peso Bills?\n\nThe Mexican Banknotes are colorful and attractive. They contain the colors green, blue, red and brown. The colors have a special meaning: green represents hope and freedom; blue represents union and justice; red represents the blood of national heroes; and brown represents the richness of Mexican soil.\n\nThe colors also represent the five regions of Mexico: Central Mexico, Baja California, Yucatán Peninsula, Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast. All of these colors come together to create a vibrant design that is both beautiful and meaningful to Mexicans.\n\nAdditionally, each note has an intricate design that illustrates some aspect of Mexican culture or history. These designs are often inspired by archeological sites, landscapes or cultural symbols such as eagles or cacti. In this way, each banknote serves as a miniature piece of art with both aesthetic value and symbolic significance.\n\nWho’s on Mexican Peso Banknotes?\n\nAs with the U.S. dollars, Mexican banknotes portray the image of important people from the country’s history. In the case of Mexican pesos, the people on the bills are famous luminaries who lived before, during, and after the Spanish conquest.\n\nWho’s on the 1,000 Pesos Bill?\n\nThe newest version of the 1,000 pesos bill features former Mexican president Francisco I. Madero, Hermila Galindo, and Carmen Serdán. Madero was a Mexican writer, businessman, revolutionary, and statesman, who became the 37th president of Mexico in 1911.

He is currently featured on the new 500 pesos bill as well.\n\nHow Can You Easily Tell Pesos Apart?\n\nAll denominations of Mexican currency vary in color, texture, and size, in an effort to deter counterfeiting and to assist the blind. The four largest bills are not only the longest but are also made out of a different material than the 50- and 20-peso bills. The larger bills are made from paper while the 100, 50, and 20 are plastic.\n\nHistoric Facts About Pesos\n\nThe Mexican peso is the eighth most traded currency in the world, the third most traded currency all over America (after the U.S. and the Canadian dollar), and the most traded in Latin America. It was the first in the world to use the dollar sign — even before the U.S. dollar.\n\nYou can learn more about the history of the peso in our article Three Interesting Facts About Mexico You Probably Didn’t Know.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLearning about the money you’re using when you’re visiting a new country is a great way to gain insight into the history and culture of the place.
