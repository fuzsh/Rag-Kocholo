        "text": "In your API requests, you need to provide transaction amounts by specifying a currency code and a value. For most APIs the value must be specified in minor units, given the number of decimals of the currency. This page lists the supported currency codes and explains what minor units are.\n\nCurrency codes\n\nMinor units\n\nWith the exception of Terminal API, our APIs expect you to submit transaction amount values in minor units: the smallest unit of a currency, depending on the number of decimals.\n\nMost currencies have two decimals. Some currencies do not have decimals, and some have three decimals. For example:\n\nGBP 10: GBP has two decimals, so in minor units you need to submit an amount of 1000\n\nJPY 10: JPY has no decimals, so in minor units you need to submit an amount of 10\n\nBHD 10: BHD has three decimals, so in minor units you need to submit an amount of 10000\n\nDifferent number of decimals\n\nFor CLP, CVE, IDR, and ISK the ISO 4217 standard has a different number of decimals than shown in our currency codes table. When submitting amounts in minor units, the decimals in the table on this page are leading.\n\nFor example, ISK has zero decimals in the ISO 4217 standard, but to submit an ISK amount to Adyen you have to use two decimals as shown in the table.\n\nCurrency conversion rates and fees\n\nSometimes sums have to be converted from one currency to another, for example when the transaction currency differs from the settlement currency. When currency conversions take place, a foreign exchange (FX) reference rate and management fee apply.\n\nFX reference rate\n\nAdyen applies a foreign currency exchange rate when a currency conversion takes place. This is called the FX reference rate.\n\nFX management fee\n\nAdyen also charges a fee for managing the exchange of currency conversions. This is called the FX management fee, or spread. How this fee is calculated is included in your contract with Adyen.\n\nBy default, the FX management fee differs based on the currency category:\n\nCategory one currencies: AUD, CAD, DKK, EUR, GBP, HKD, JPY, NOK, NZD, PLN, SEK, USD, ZAR.\n\nCategory two currencies: all other currencies.\n\nYour company can also choose an alternative setup, where the FX management fee is based on a scheme rate. This is currently available for Visa and Mastercard. The FX management fee for other payment methods is based on the currency category."
