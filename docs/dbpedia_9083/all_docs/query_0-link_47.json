        "text": "If you have an overseas trip or vacation coming up, planning your travel money in advance can save you time and money. This guide walks through the best available options to buy Philippine Pesos in the United States, whether you want cash in your wallet before you leave, or prefer to spend with a card.\n\nWe’ll look at how to pick the right method for you, what it might cost, and how to get the best available Philippine Peso exchange rate.\n\nCompare providers\n\nWe do not compare all available providers in the market. Our results are sorted by default from the lowest USD cost to you to the highest USD cost to you and you may choose to sort results according to other criteria. We may receive a referral fee if you choose one of these providers, but that won’t affect the ranking of the provider, the exchange rates or any fees you are charged.\n\n*Please see Terms of Use for your region or visit Wise fees & pricing for most up to date information.\n\n**Average margin versus the mid-market exchange rate of 129 individual quotes from 9 travel money providers, collected on 30/05/2024.\n\nYou can order a travel money card like Wise or Revolut in the United States, add money in USD and use your balance to purchase Philippine Pesos within your multi-currency account.\n\nYou’ll then be free to spend your Philippine Pesos when you have enough balance with no extra fees once you arrive at your destination - you can also make ATM withdrawals whenever you need some cash. If you have travel money left after your vacation you can convert back to USD instantly for use at home - or just leave your balance ready for your next trip.\n\nSecure, cheap, and easy to use\n\nExchange instantly or let your card do it when you pay\n\nUse a digital card even before your physical card arrives\n\nTravel money cards like the Wise card offer great rates, cheap fees, and flexibility to manage your money with your phone.\n\nSome banks allow you to exchange money in a branch location. The processes and eligibility rules here do vary quite a lot. In some cases you’ll need to already hold an account with the bank you pick, for example. Plus you’ll usually need to order your travel money in advance as banks don’t tend to hold a high level of stock of foreign currencies. Some banks support buy back services so you can sell your unused travel money back - but you might get a different exchange rate for this, which means you could get back less than you spent in the first place.\n\nWhere banks offer travel money services they cover most global currencies\n\nYou’ll often be able to order online for branch collection\n\nBuy back services may be available for leftover travel money\n\nProviderFeesExchange ratesLocationsLearn more Wells FargoVarying fees depending on the service requiredExchange rates may include a markupMajor branches of Wells Fargo - call ahead to check availabilityGo to site\n\nAnother option is to buy your Philippine Pesos in person at an exchange office. To do this all you’ll need to do is pick the exchange office that’s most convenient to you, and head in with some cash in US Dollars. Some exchange offices also accept card payments. Currency exchange offices set their own exchange rates and fees, so shopping around is essential - but this method does have the advantage that it’s usually instant to get the travel money you need.\n\nExchange rates are likely to include a markup - a fee\n\nNot all currencies are stocked by all exchange services\n\nYou may lose out when you sell back unused travel money\n\nThere’s no single best provider when it comes to exchange rates. Different services set their own rates which may vary based on the currency, the amount you want to exchange, how you want to pay, and whether you’re exchanging money in a digital account or for physical cash.\n\nTo compare your options it helps to understand a bit about the mid-market exchange rate. That’s the rate you’ll see for USD to PHP exchange if you use an online currency converter tool or a Google search. The mid-market rate is commonly used as a benchmark as it’s the one quoted on wholesale markets. However, banks and exchange services don’t usually pass this rate on directly. Instead they add an extra fee to the rate offered to retail customers - known as a markup.\n\nThis means that looking for a service which has transparent exchange rates which are the same as - or close to - the mid-market exchange rates is a good idea. You can compare a few live exchange rates for popular providers using the Exiap tools, to find the best Philippine Peso exchange rate based on the specific transaction you want to make.\n\nHere’s what to do to find the best USD to PHP exchange rate:\n\nEnter the amount you need into the comparison tool\n\nReview the options available, looking at the exchange rate for US Dollars to Philippine Pesos in particular\n\nDecide between getting a travel card, ordering online, or in person\n\nChoose a provider based on the available options and deals\n\nProviderExchange rateLearn more Wise56.6722 Mid-market rate 0%Go to siteWells Fargo50.4236 🔻 - 11.02%Go to siteXchange of America51.5358 🔻 - 9.06%Go to site\n\nYour budget for a trip to the Philippines can vary enormously depending on what you’re planning to do, where you’ll stay and how long you’re going to be there. It’s worth setting yourself a budget in Philippine Pesos well in advance so you can plan around that. The most expensive costs of any trip are usually accommodation and activities, but do remember to also take into account costs of currency exchange, food and transport, as well as incidentals like tipping.\n\nAverage hotel costs in the Philippines do vary a lot but can start from around $50. On top of that you’ll need to budget for food, at around $15 per meal. If you’re looking for an easy life you could also choose to take an organized tour which means there’s no need to plan all your activities individually. Or, set your budget to cover about $14 per day to make sure you can get the most from your trip.\n\nSpendingCosts in PhilippinesAmount in US DollarsAccommodation₱2,833$50Transportation₱1,190$21Meals₱850$15Entertainment₱793$14\n\nCountry costs provided by BudgetYourTrip. Correct as of 25 April 2024.\n\nIs it better to get Philippine Pesos in the US or the Philippines?\n\nYou can buy Philippine Pesos before you travel, or on arrival if you’d prefer. Which works best will come down to the fees and exchange rates you can find both locally and when you get to your destination. One disadvantage of buying Philippine Pesos when you arrive is that you’ll waste time looking for exchange offices - while taking all your cash with you isn’t necessarily a smart choice for safety. As an alternative, getting a travel money card from a service like Wise could be a good bet for flexibility, security and cost.\n\nCan I get Philippine Pesos at a bank?\n\nWhether or not you can get Philippine Pesos from your bank will depend on several factors - including who you bank with. Some banks do allow account holders to purchase Philippine Pesos in person but you might need to order Philippine Pesos online in advance and wait for your order to be prepared before you can collect.\n\nBecause Philippine Pesos are a commonly traded currency you might find your bank has them in stock if they offer travel money services. Call in advance to ask if they have Philippine Pesos on hand to avoid a wasted trip.\n\nCan I get Philippine Pesos at the airport?\n\nMany major airports have currency exchange desks which stock major currencies for instant conversion. You may also be able to order money in advance for collection. However, it’s useful to know that a lack of local competition can mean that prices are high at the airport, with exchange rate markups adding to the overall cost significantly.\n\nAs Philippine Pesos are commonly needed by travelers, you may find you can get some instantly at the airport. However, it’s worth checking in advance to make sure you don’t end up stuck without travel money.\n\nHow long does it take to get Philippine Pesos?\n\nHow long it takes to sort out your travel money can depend a lot on the method you choose - here’s a quick summary:\n\nTravel cards can take 7 - 21 days to be delivered, but you may be able to start using a virtual card instantly for mobile payments\n\nHome delivery services could dispatch common currencies on the same day as order, for overnight delivery, but may take 4-5 days for some currencies and payment methods\n\nBank currency exchange can involve placing an order in advance and waiting 2 - 7 days before you can collect it, particularly for uncommon currencies\n\nForeign currency exchange offices in cities and at the airport can offer instant conversion if they have the currency you need in stock"
