The currency in the Philippines is the Philippine peso. Each peso is divided into 100 sentimos.

When you’re buying currency for the Philippines, look out for the currency code PHP. And once you’re in the Philippines, you’ll see the symbol ₱ used to show prices.

You’ll find Philippine banknotes in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 - although the 5 and 10 PHP notes are seldom used. There are also 1, 5 and 10 peso coins.

Sentimos come in coins of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 25.
