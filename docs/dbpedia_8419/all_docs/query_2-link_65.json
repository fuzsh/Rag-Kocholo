Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nBut it was also where he experienced a \"tough\" childhood at the hands of his \"tyrant\" father, who would beat him and his older brother, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the series, Schwarzenegger returns to Thal, his childhood home, and the bedroom where he first dreamed of becoming a star. Here's a closer look.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwarzenegger grew up in Thal, Austria. The village is just west of Graz, the country's second-biggest city after Vienna.\n\nIn \"Arnold,\" Schwarzenegger called Thal \"a beautiful, beautiful place.\"\n\nThe forest-covered hills of Thal were first settled in the 10th century. Today the village has a population of around 2,300 people.\n\nIt's a 20-minute drive from Graz. Schwarzenegger recalled how venturing to the city in 1961 was an eye-opening experience — it was there that he first saw a movie-theater poster for \"Hercules,\" featuring bodybuilder Reg Park.\n\n\"I was in a trance,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe lived in an apartment in this 19th-century home from his birth in 1947 until 1966, when he left to pursue his bodybuilding dreams.\n\nThe home, which is surrounded by farmland, was built in the early 1800s. His family lived upstairs while the forest ranger lived downstairs, he said in \"Arnold.\"\n\n\"We had a castle across the street built in the 1100s, so this was our playground,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"So it was absolutely beautiful.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchwarzenegger returned to the home for his Netflix docuseries, \"Arnold.\"\n\n\"I always like coming back here,\" he said of Thal. \"I think it's always good to stay in touch with your roots and where you come from.\"\n\nThe home now operates as the Arnold Schwarzenegger Museum. Schwarzenegger gave his blessing to the project before it opened on his 64th birthday in July 2011.\n\nHe also revisited his old childhood bedroom. Its walls were adorned with photos of bodybuilders he aspired to emulate, like Reg Park.\n\nWhile in his bedroom, he recalled dreaming of a life of bodybuilding, starring in movies, and making millions of dollars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, the bed he used is still in the room.\n\nThe bed is in the corner of a large room that also features a closet and desk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe shared the home with his mother Aurelia, father Gustav, and older brother Meinhard. Schwarzenegger called his childhood \"tough.\"\n\nIn the docuseries, he revealed his father, who served as a member of the Nazi Party's paramilitary wing, the Sturmabteilung (SA), came home from World War II \"suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome,\" Insider previously reported.\n\nHe called his father a \"tyrant,\" and said he'd smack and beat his sons with belts and make them \"compete against each other.\" Schwarzenegger said his father's behavior became worse when he drank.\n\nMeinhard died in a car wreck in 1971, and their father died the following year. Aurelia died in 1998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe home didn't have any running water or electricity, according to the BBC. Today, visitors can see its 1950s kitchen, and the home's original pit toilet.\n\nThere is also a washstand, alongside jugs that they used to collect water, the BBC reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe first started bodybuilding while living in the home and dreamed of moving to America.\n\nToday, his original dumbbells and workout machine — a pulley with weights attached — are on display at the museum, the BBC reported.\n\n\"I would be working out in my house and there was no sound, nothing,\" Schwarzenegger said in \"Arnold.\" \"And I could think and concentrate and visualize how I'm going to become a bodybuilding champion, how I'm going to move to America, how I'm going to get in the movies, how I'm going to make millions of dollars.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe museum has memorabilia from the various stages of Schwarzenegger's life, from his blockbuster movies to his time as California governor.\n\nThere's a replica of his governor's desk in the museum, as well as a collection of his movie memorabilia, including a Harley Davidson motorbike from one of the Terminator films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOutside the home is a large bronze statue depicting Schwarzenegger in the 3/4 back pose — a pose he made famous.\n\nThe bronze statue by sculptor Ralph Crawford was unveiled in 2011, when the museum opened to the public, according to its website.\n\nSchwarzenegger left the home in 1966 to pursue his dream of becoming Mr. Universe, and the following year, at the age of 20, he became its youngest-ever winner. He would eventually leave Austria in 1968, at the age of 21.\n\nRead next\n\nNetflix House Tour\n\nAdvertisement"
