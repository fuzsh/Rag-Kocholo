        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has been in the public eye for several, very different reasons. He is a former professional bodybuilder, actor, businessman, investor, and politician. As a bodybuilder, he began lifting when he was 15 years old and was awarded the Mr. Universe title five years later. He won many other contests as a bodybuilder, wrote several books and articles on the sport, and become a name associated with bodybuilding. Schwarzenegger also gained fame all across the world as a Hollywood action film icon—featuring in movies such as “Terminator.”\n\nOn this day, October 8th, in 2003, Schwarzenegger was elected as the 38th Governor of California. He was in office from 2003 to 2011. As a republican, he replaced former Governor Gray Davis. In announcing his candidacy, Schwarzenegger did not decide to run until the day of the announcement on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno.\n\nAfter leaving office, Schwarzenegger returned to acting."
