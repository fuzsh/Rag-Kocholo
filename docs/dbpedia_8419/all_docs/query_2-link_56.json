        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger has come a long way from his modest childhood home in Austria. With an impressive career spanning more than five decades under his belt, the former body builder, actor and politician has spent his money wisely, investing in commercial property early on in his career. Arnie is now thought to be worth $1 billion (£779m).\n\nAs well as savvy investments, he's lived in some impressive houses over the years too, these days with his beloved pet donkey and miniature pony for company. Click or scroll on to see inside his amazing houses...\n\nThe Terminator star currently resides in his sprawling mansion in the prestigious Brentwood neighbourhood of Los Angeles, which he bought with his then-wife, Maria Shriver, in 2002, says the LA Times.\n\nThe former Governor of California, who made it on to the 2024 Forbes World Billionaires List, has proved himself a savvy businessman, as well as one of the most successful actors in Hollywood, but he certainly wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth...\n\nArnold Alois Schwarzenegger was born on 30 July 1947 in the village of Thal in south-east Austria. Born to Aurelia and Gustav Schwarzenegger, the star's father was a local police chief and Arnold and his older brother, Meinhard, were raised in a strict, military household.\n\nHe later discovered his father had been a member of the Nazi party, according to Forbes. Arnold has spoken about how difficult his childhood was with a father who would make him and his brother “earn breakfast” and encouraged them to “compete against each other” as reported in British newspaper The Independent.\n\nThroughout Arnold's formative years, the family lived above the police station where Gustav worked. Originally the home of Count Herberstein, a member of the Austrian nobility, the property was built in around 1806.\n\nA humble childhood home, the modest property didn't have indoor plumbing or running water until the star was 15 years old, meaning Arnold had to collect vats of water from a well 200 yards (600ft / 183m) from the house, according to a piece he wrote for The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nToday, the modest residence has been converted into a museum so that fans can tour Arnie's childhood bedroom and view memorabilia from his early life.\n\nThe home is the place where The Twins actor discovered his love of sports, with his father encouraging him to follow a rigorous exercise routine.\n\nIn 1967, the star's parents upped sticks to the small town of Weiz in the west of the Austrian state of Styria, but Arnie had other ideas...\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1965, Schwarzenegger joined the Austrian army to serve his compulsory year of national service.\n\nJust one month later, he won his first bodybuilding title, Junior Mr. Europe. Schwarzenegger had to leave his army base without permission for the competition, which was held in Germany. As a result, he spent a few days in the army jail, but after his release continued his training with vigour.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s nickname in his bodybuilding days was 'The Austrian Oak' or 'Styrian Oak' due to his large build and a story of him performing chin-ups from the limb of an oak tree on the banks of the river Thalersee, the lake of his hometown in Austria\n\nHowever he trained, his gruelling workouts paid off in 1967 when at the age of 20, he won his first Mr Universe amateur title in London, UK.\n\nThe youngest person ever to win the competition, Schwarzenegger was confident that he would keep his title the following year, which would also see his dream come true of visiting the United States, where the competition was due to be held. He went on to win the competition four times.\n\nIn 1968, Arnie's dream was realised when he was spotted by fitness pioneer Joe Weider at the Mr Universe competition. He invited the promising bodybuilder to stay in the United States and live and train with him in Los Angeles, California.\n\nSchwarzenegger jumped at the chance and devoted himself to training for the next seven years, even featuring in a 1977 documentary about bodybuilding competitions called Pumping Iron. When he arrived on US soil, Schwarzenegger had $27,000 (£21k) in his wallet, his winnings accumulated from competitions as reported in British newspaper The Express, but that would soon change.\n\nArnold started to make small investments in real estate and began to see the benefits. Remarkably, by the time he was 25, he was a millionaire, well before he made his first film.\n\nSadly, in 1971, as Schwarzenegger was starting to make his mark in the States, he learned that his brother Meinhard had died in a driving incident.\n\nThey had a strict upbringing, which Arnold attributes to his brother's untimely death. \"The brutality that was at home...I think he could not sustain. He [Meinhard] was much more delicate of a person by nature,\" he says in the 2023 Netflix documentary, Arnold.\n\nDespite the sadness in his personal life, Arnold continued to work hard. Seen here in his apartment in 1977, the bodybuilder focused his property purchases in the Santa Monica area of Los Angeles as he spent his time training in Venice Beach.\n\n“Buildings that I would buy for $500k within the year were $800k and I put only maybe $100k down, so you made 300% on your money\", he explained in Tim Ferriss' book Tools of Titans.\n\nFast forward to 1986 and with his career picking up pace after his starring role in the 1982 movie Conan the Barbarian, the star snapped up his first mega-luxury home in fashionable Pacific Palisades with his new wife, journalist Maria Shriver, the niece of John F. Kennedy, whom he married that same year.\n\nSituated on 1.75 acres (0.7ha) between Will Rogers Historic Park and Rustic Canyon Creek, the 4,177-square-foot (388sqm) home is nestled in an area of stunning beauty, crisscrossed by a network of riding and hiking trails and a meandering creek, so perfect for newlyweds thinking of starting a family.\n\nBuilt in 1981, the five-bedroom, six-bathroom abode looks very different to how it was when Arnold moved in, thanks to an extensive remodel. It now boasts a traditional American aesthetic, with dark wooden floorboards and cosy reading bench at the entrance.\n\nIt was home to Schwarzenegger and Shriver and their four children from 1986 until 2003 and is reported across numerous publications to be where Schwarzenegger had an affair with housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena, who gave birth to a son nine months later.\n\nWhile the star admitted to his affair, he said he didn't know the boy was his until Joseph was seven or eight and he noticed \"he started looking like me\". Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger and Shriver announced their separation in 2011 and their divorce was finalised 10 years later.\n\nA mixture of New England and California contemporary styles, the home has been completely remodelled inside and out since the star and his family were in residence, but this spacious living room with its neutral palette still oozes understated elegance.\n\nThis is the 'family room' which is both a comfortable lounge area and a well-stocked library, with skylights so you can page turn late into the evening.\n\nUpstairs, the master bedroom comes with a private terrace and a sauna. Downstairs a spacious kitchen, with a huge range cooker and stainless-steel appliances, flows into a formal dining room with sliding glass doors that lead outside to the backyard.\n\nKey attractions outside include expansive lawns, landscaped gardens and this grotto-style pool and tennis court, which are surrounded by ancient oak, sycamore and eucalyptus trees.\n\nThe couple kept the home in the family when they sold the property in 2013 to author Maxwell Kennedy, son of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, and his wife Vicki Strauss for $12.9 million (£10m). And it returned to the market in November 2021, when it listed for $11 million (£8.7m).\n\nFor over 20 years, Arnie has used Ketchum in Idaho as his chosen holiday destination. The Kindergarten Cop star built his longtime holiday home in Sun Valley in 1994 and has never looked back.\n\nHe chose well, as this area is a celebrity hotspot, frequented by the likes of Mark Zuckerberg, Tom Hanks and Bill Gates. It's known for its privacy and a major benefit for them is there are 'no maps locating their houses or sightseeing buses touring their neighbourhoods' according to American news site SFGATE.\n\nSo while we're unlikely to get a glimpse inside the mysterious property, the rustic retreat is reportedly spread over 18,000 square feet (1,672sqm) and boasts a wood and stone interior featuring stunning views over the mountains. Friend and builder of the home, Gary Storey describes the interior style as \"tasteful European\".\n\nWe can't think of a more idyllic spot for the action star to enjoy some downtime, especially given his no doubt stressful stint as the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011.\n\nWhile Governor of California, Schwarzenegger proposed deep cuts in the state budget, meeting hefty opposition and wanted to push for changes in tax laws for businesses. But he might be best remembered by some for his mistaking a hole in a road for a pothole and causing more problems than he solved by filling it.\n\nAs reported by British newspaper The Guardian the 'giant pothole' Schwarzenegger and a friend packed with quick-drying cement and topped with sand was actually an essential service trench for work being performed by a utility company.\n\nBack to his property journey and in 2002, Arnie and his wife Maria reportedly snapped up a newly-built mansion in the celebrity hotspot of Brentwood in Los Angeles for $11.9 million (£9.4m), after moving out of their long-time home in Pacific Palisades.\n\nThe couple had originally planned to move back into the Pacific Palisades home after it had undergone extensive renovations, but changed their minds and remained in their ocean-view Brentwood residence, where the star lives to this day. His wife Maria departed the home following their split in 2011.\n\nDetails of the property are scarce, although it is known to be set on six acres (2.4ha) of land, while the house itself has five bedrooms and 11,000 square feet (1,022sqm) of interior space.\n\nAerial shots show just how lavish the mansion's design is, with the grand estate featuring an impressive backyard with a tennis court and swimming pool.\n\nWe were treated to glimpses of the property during the pandemic, however, when the star posted the occasional photograph of his home life there. It turns out the actor is sharing his mansion with two rather unusual family members, a miniature horse named Whiskey and a donkey called Lulu.\n\nSchwarzenegger revealed “I never ever planned on having a donkey,” explaining that his girlfriend saw his pony and said, “I think she needs a companion”. Next thing he knew, there was a donkey in his house reports American magazine Hello!\n\nBut the action hero is quite the animal lover and adopted a baby pig in April 2023, which he called Schnelly. He often posts photos with the pet, including this one where he appears to be mouth-feeding him sweet treats. “Schnelly loves his cookies, and I love my Schnelly,” he says.\n\nIt’s not all fun and games in pet paradise, however. Schwarzenegger encourages daily exercise for all his animals, telling Schnelly in this adorable video from his Instagram account: “C'mon Schnelly! You’ve got to lose some fat.”\n\nOffering a window into his lavish living spaces, the star's home office space is shown here. Featuring colourful artwork, memorabilia and family photos arranged on a wooden sideboard, it's the perfect place to knuckle down for a day of hard work.\n\nOr, in Arnie's case, reading a book or two. In his Instagram post, he said: \"Isaac Dovere is a fantastic journalist and I love reading all of his stories because he knows how to dig in and get information no one else can.\" We wonder what else is on Arnie's bookshelves...\n\nTrue to form, the veteran star still spends his days keeping up his fitness levels. Here he's pictured in his home gym area, which is fitted out with the latest equipment.\n\nIt's also the home of his beloved chess set, which got plenty of use when the star was hunkering down in the pandemic. Arnold has spoken of his love of chess: “I started when I was eight with my father, I had to play with him every day. When I went to America, I started playing over there with friends and people at the gym,” he said to chess.com in an interview. “It was always part of me.”\n\nThese days, the star spends his leisure time relaxing in the mansion's extensive grounds, which include rolling lawns, alfresco terraces and a hot tub.\n\nFrom his childhood home without running water in Austria to his lavish Los Angeles mansion and his array of successful property investments, we can't wait to see what Arnold Schwarzenegger buys next!\n\nLove this?
