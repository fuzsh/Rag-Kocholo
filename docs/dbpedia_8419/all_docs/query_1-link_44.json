        "text": "Biographical Sketch\n\nFormer California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Governor Downey Professor of State and Global Policy at USC, and chairman of the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy.\n\nDuring his service as California’s 38th governor, Schwarzenegger worked with leaders of both major political parties to address the greatest challenges facing the state. His leadership put California at the forefront in addressing climate change, pushing for the development of renewable energies, rebuilding our critical infrastructure, investing in stem cell research, and putting in place health care and political reforms. He pushed for historic investment in California’s roads, bridges, water delivery systems, and schools. He proposed a comprehensive health care reform initiative and ensured California was the first state to create a Health Benefits Exchange. He also put politics back in the hands of the people through citizen-based redistricting and primary election reform.\n\nRecognizing that states have the responsibility to provide the best possible education to every child, Schwarzenegger committed himself to offering top-quality early childhood development programs, comprehensive after-school programs for all elementary and middle schools, parental choice through high-performing charter schools, and expanding career technical education programs.\n\nContinuing his commitment to environmental leadership, in 2011 he co-founded R20, a global non-profit of subnational governments and regional leaders working together to address climate change and build a green economy."
