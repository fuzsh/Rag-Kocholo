        "text": "Most of us probably remember Hansal Mehta for his bitter-sweet Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar (you must get your hands on a DVD if you haven’t seen this one!) that spoke about urban alienation in a thriving metroplois-Mumbai. Starring Manoj Bajpai and Tabu, the film was much ahead of it’s time and did not fare well at the box office but did leave an impression. Mehta is back with a bang after all this time with the gritty and pacy tale of Shahid Azmi at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival.\n\nShahid is the story of Shahid Azmi-a human rights activist and lawyer Shahid who was killed in 2010 by unidentified assailants in his office for defending Fahim Ansari who was an accused in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Supported by a brilliant star cast that includes Raj Kumar Yadav (of Love, Sex aur Dhoka fame), a fresh faced Prabhleen Sandhu and a memorable cameo by director Tigmanshu Dhulia, Hansal Mehta managed to keep audiences riveted with his masterful storytelling in Shahid.\n\nSuhaag.com caught up with Mehta and the lovely Prabhleen Sandhu at TIFF.\n\nSU: Why did you want Shahid’s story told and what attracted you tot he story\n\nHM: It has been a long drawn concern of mine that the world is changing, particularly India. I came back fom the US to a different Bombay in the 90’s-fearful and suspicious. I grew up in a free city so this was a shock for me. Bombay has never been the same after the riots and the city has been regressing in terms of political governance, communal issues, migrants…I have been voicing my concerns in my own way.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2008 attacks, everyone was targeted but the Muslim community bore the brunt of the victimization following the attacks. My wife is Muslim and we could not rent and apartment or buy one in her name.\n\nRight about then I, as a filmmaker was disillusioned with the kind of films I had made in the past- they did not reflect my concerns or my personality.\n\nThen in 2010 there was a headline: Shahid Azmi-lawyer defending Fahim Ansari killed in his office. I thought it was a fascinating story and journey of a young man that needs to be told. I rediscovered my passion for telling a story. It’s a story that is pertinent for the world we live in.\n\nSU: You got pretty involved with the character while researching the film..\n\nHM: Shahid’s story took over my life-at the end of the process, it’s like he became a part of my family. While making the film, I did not refer to the script for a moment because his story and his life came alive in front of me.\n\nSU: Was it difficult to get this film made? It had no stars, no songs..\n\nHM: I was very clear at the outset that I wanted a producer who respected my freedom. I was ready to make the film at no budget provided I make the kind of film I wanted to. Sunil Bohra and Anurag Kashyap let me make the film that I wanted to. There was no compulsion, no stars, no songs, nobody ever questioned my approach or even watched my initial cuts.\n\nSU: You’ve had a contentious relationship with Anurag Kashyap and yet he is the producer of this film\n\nHM:Anurag is very dear to me. His first film as a writer was my film, Jayate. I almost see his success as my success very often. Anurag said that I brought him to the film industry and I said he brought me back! Life has come a full circle with this film.\n\nSU: What are your cinematic influences?\n\nHM: My cinematic sensibilities are like clay-they are always changing. I am quite a fan of new cinema. I am not much of a purist. I will say that watching Krzysztof Kieślowski’s Blue changed my life. He is the reason I am making films today.\n\nMy recent favourites have been Dibakar Banerjee’s Khosla ka Ghosla and Oye Lucky, Lucky oye. Dibakar is such a a striking film maker.\n\nSU: What are your hopes for Shahid?\n\nHM: My personal ambition for the film is for it to be seen by as many people as possible. It’s an important film for our times. Even at TIFF I saw reactions that were related to issues, more thought driven rather than the cinematic value of a film. People are reacting to the characters and their journey.\n\nSU: Prabhleen, how easy or difficult was it for you to play Mariam’s character?\n\nPS: I always improvise and hardly refer to the script. So it was fine that Hansalji did not let me refer to the script and just gave me a situation to react to. He was the easiest person to work with but my look test was a different matter. I was asked to come without make-up in my kurti and jeans! But the moment Hansalji said that I looked like the Mariam he had in mind, the entire shoot was a breeze.\n\nSU: How did you get Raj Kumar for Shahid’s role?\n\nHM: I auditioned a lot of stars for the film but no one quite got the character. I had seen Raj Kumar in Love, Sex aur Dhoka and then in Ragini MMS. Midway through the latter, I locked him in. Our casting director, Mukesh Chhabra has done a fabulous job with all the characters in the film.\n\nSU: What are your actor’s strengths?\n\nHM: Prabhleen is very instinctive. Actors generally take themselves too seriously. She is shorn of any such baggage. There is also a lack of burning ambition. Such ambition can sometimes destroy you and that is not there is her.\n\nRaj Kumar is ambitious but more than that he is greedy. He wants all the good roles out there. He doesn’t care about the length of the role-if it’s a good role, he will do it. There are two actors who will define Indian cinema according to me: Ranbir Kapoor and Raj Kumar-if they continue to do what they are doing."
