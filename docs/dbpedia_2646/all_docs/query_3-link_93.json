But here, the revered filmmaker tries something new, and it works wonderfully - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 14, 2024\n\n14%\n\nSwatantrya Veer Savarkar (2024) Even though I enjoyed the movie, with my intermediate knowledge of India’s history and Partition, Satantra Veer Savarkar will not be a movie that everyone can enjoy. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 14, 2024\n\n52%\n\nAnyone But You (2023) Where Anyone But You stands out is that it seems like the movie knows it’s a rom-com and leans into all the tropes, while also subverting them a little bit at the same time. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 14, 2024\n\nA\n\n92%\n\nDune: Part Two (2024) Dune: Part Two works as an epic conclusion to the introduction in the first Dune. Part Two works better as the conclusion, experiencing as one cohesive story rather than two parts of one whole. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 05, 2024\n\n33%\n\nArgylle (2024) The grand spectacle of Vaughn’s stylized action sequences is a lot of fun to watch on the big screen. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 20, 2024\n\nD\n\n11%\n\nMadame Web (2024) All in all, a disappointing entry into more Spider-Man movies without Spider-Man, that continues to make us wonder, ‘why?!’ - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 20, 2024\n\n90%\n\nSociety of the Snow (2023) From beginning to end you can’t help but marvel at the characters' resilience and perseverance to simply live, despite everything around them, from plunging temperatures to painful winds, trying to kill them. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 07, 2024\n\n63%\n\nThe Archies (2023) It’s a simple story about young kids who end up dealing with very adult concepts of capitalism and how they can bring change to the world around them. It may not be for audiences expecting more than that. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Dec 29, 2023\n\n89%\n\nThe Iron Claw (2023) Director Durkin does not play up any one angle too much but creates a great balance of emotions that will make audiences laugh, smile, relate to the family dynamic and ultimately be a part of the emotional whirlwind that they go through. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Dec 29, 2023\n\n33%\n\nAquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) In many ways, The Lost Kingdom is emblematic of all the issues that plagued the DCEU in its 10 year-run; no plan or foresight of direction, countless studio interferences, and a failure to understand how to do a shared universe in the first place. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Dec 29, 2023\n\n67%\n\nThe Creator (2023) ...if watching it [The Creator] as a cohesive narrative that has emotional depth or substantive quality, then it would fail to live up to even the lowest of expectations. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 29, 2023\n\n75%\n\nSuspect X (2023) An engaging story told with a certain skill that keeps audiences hooked from the first scene until the last. It’s engaging, and ominous and creates an intense suspenseful atmosphere that prevents it from getting bogged down with its dreary and dark tone - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 28, 2023\n\n79%\n\nThank You for Coming (2023) If seen as a movie that has a message, like sexual empowerment, feminism or anything else, you will find it lacking. But as a sex comedy that deals with the stigma of being single and how loneliness makes us all act in crazy ways, it works. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n91%\n\nDream Scenario (2023) Dream Scenario is a lot of things, most among them showcasing an incredible Nic Cage performance. The humour is derived from the absolutely bonkers premise and the even more outrageous situations that arise from it. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n90%\n\nWoman of the Hour (2023) The story creates tension, and Kendrick’s direction enhances that with some brilliant technical choices that make the movie stand out in its genre. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n95%\n\nIn Flames (2023) The story is impeccably written, also by Kahn, and so much of it is unsaid moments of grief, trauma and build-up that lead to such a satisfying reveal and climax. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n100%\n\nUproar (2023) Uproar is a lot of things, but mainly it’s a cavalcade of emotions running rampant and all over the place, which is pretty much how it feels to be a teenager. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n100%\n\nConcrete Utopia (2023) Concrete Utopia is a showcase of the worst thing that can happen to a collective of people when facing the ultimate adversity; death. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n90%\n\nThe Queen of My Dreams (2023) The Queen Of My Dreams is a must-watch for anyone into family dramas, mother-daughter relationships, or just a story that is heartwarming and takes you back to South Asian roots, showcasing culture and the nostalgic atmosphere. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 18, 2023\n\n76%\n\nAsteroid City (2023) While Asteroid City does have some issues, when it comes to its pacing and some plot points, it’s a very quick watch. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 14, 2023\n\n31%\n\nHeart of Stone (2023) While some action sequences feel new and exciting, the rest of—well— everything else, feels like there was no effort put into them. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 14, 2023\n\n95%\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone (2023) They Cloned Tyrone is a wonderful experience of a movie with a completely original story, told with style and flair, with performances that blow the roof off. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 14, 2023\n\n52%\n\nTransformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023) Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts is all about the heart that the story infuses into this plot about robots fighting other robots. - Nerdspin\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 14, 2023\n\n100%\n\nLost Ladies (2023) Rao is able to package Lost Ladies with relatable characters, a sweet love story and so much heart. All the while discussing topics that can be labelled feminist, by those who use the word derogatorily. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 13, 2023\n\n90%\n\nKill (2023) KILL is just a thrill ride from start to finish, and the effort they put into those aspects shows as such - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 13, 2023\n\n92%\n\nThe Fabelmans (2022) The Fabelmans is a sweet and poignant story about life seen through a lens. And how those experiences shaped one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. - theshahshahid.com\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 30, 2022\n\n78%\n\nVikram Vedha (2022) The lead pairing of Bollywood megastars are stunning in their performances. Saif Ali Khan plays Vikram as strongly as Madhavan. While the biggest difference in the movies is Hrithik Roshan’s performance as Vedha. - The Movie Blog\n\nRead More | Posted Oct 21, 2022\n\n48%\n\nRaymond & Ray (2022) The performances of McGregor and Hawke make what they’re going through so very universal as well. Despite the story going to some crazy and wild places, you can relate to and invest in both these characters’ lives. - theshahshahid.com\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 26, 2022\n\n71%\n\nWhat's Love Got to Do with It? (2022) The humour comes from the usual making fun of the differences in culture that one expects from a movie like this. There are absolutely no sweet or light-hearted moments between the lead couple in this, apparent romantic comedy. - theshahshahid.com\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 26, 2022\n\n67%\n\nKacchey Limbu (2022) It’s a light-hearted affair with amazing music and a great young cast turning in some wonderful performances. It never takes itself too seriously, even though it plays the dramatic beats very sincerely. - theshahshahid.com\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 20, 2022\n\n89%\n\nBros (2022) It’s a very realistic portrayal of gay men, finding love and dealing with their issues and coming together. In that sense, Bros is raw, unapologetic and completely aware of the story it’s telling, without worrying about who it’s telling it to. - theshahshahid.com\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 20, 2022\n\n94%\n\nThe Woman King (2022) The Woman King is a must-watch. An epic blockbuster unlike any other before it. From its amazing framing and visuals to its tightly directed story, it’s a riveting experience from beginning to end. It’s visceral, raw and groundbreaking in a lot of ways. - theshahshahid.com\n\nRead More | Posted Sep 16, 2022\n\n2/10\n\n23%\n\nThe Man From Toronto (2022) The Man from Toronto is an action-comedy that doesn’t deliver on either of those fronts. With convenient plot points and a weak story, it’s one of Netflix’s weakest originals. - Cultured Vultures\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 30, 2022\n\n7/10\n\n39%\n\nSpiderhead (2022) Tune in if you want to see a Hemsworth performance that’s a departure from his usual clean-cut action hero roles. - Cultured Vultures\n\nRead More | Posted Jun 20, 2022\n\n68%\n\nThe Adam Project (2022) The Adam Project on Netflix is an absolutely kid-friendly movie thats a load of fun. It might turn out to be an early spring-time blockbuster for the streamer. - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 11, 2022\n\n95%\n\nTurning Red (2022) Pixars Turning Red is a sweet little movie that works as a wonderful analogy for growing up. - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Mar 08, 2022\n\n51%\n\nThe Tender Bar (2021) The very likeable cast depicting emotionally supportive characters to a young man in a story trying to pursue his dreams is very endearing - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 02, 2022\n\n85%\n\nThe Last Duel (2021) While certain sequences will be uncomfortable, Ridley Scott's ability to tell a period story that is so relevant today is uncanny. - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Feb 02, 2022\n\n36%\n\nSooryavanshi (2021) Rohit Shetty's latest instalment of his cop universe of movies feels like a means to an end, setting up other films for the director. - Split Screen Podcast\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 14, 2022\n\n74%\n\nFinch (2021) While not perfect, I would recommend Finch to anyone who wants to laugh and smile during a movie in this kind of tragic setting. - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 14, 2022\n\n39%\n\nThe Unforgivable (2021) The Unforgivable is a quiet thriller that works on so many levels. But at times, the pacing and story does waver slightly. - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 14, 2022\n\n75%\n\nMinnal Murali (2021) Minnal Murali adds to the discourse of superhero movies, not just in India, but worldwide. - Comic Years\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 13, 2022\n\n50%\n\nBruised (2020) But despite its best intentions, the movie ends up a recycled and regurgitated version of many other movies in the same genre, only without the same impact. - Netflix Hits\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 13, 2022\n\n55%\n\nDon't Look Up (2021) Don't Look Up is a fun movie when you watch it as a casual comedy with a powerful cast telling a ridiculous story. However, things start falling apart when you see the movie as a commentary or satire to real-world events. - Netflix Hits\n\nRead More | Posted Jan 13, 2022\n\n40%\n\nDhamaka (2021) \"The Acting is the least offensive part of whatever Dhamaka was trying to be.\" - Split Screen Podcast\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 30, 2021\n\n90%\n\nPassing (2021) Passing is a supremely interesting movie. Its depiction of its leading black characters is anything but typical. - Netflix Hits\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 15, 2021\n\n88%\n\nThe Harder They Fall (2021) The Harder They Fall is a genuinely great movie. While the story is a little loose at some points, it more than makes up for it with a justified sense of grandeur and style that hasn't been seen in a Western for a while. - Netflix Hits\n\nRead More | Posted Nov 15, 2021"
