        "text": "The opening ceremony of the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2023 was held on Friday, October 27 on a grand scale at the sprawling The Grand Theatre at Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre, BKC, Mumbai. After the ceremony, the cast and crew of The Buckingham Murders came on stage before the murder mystery played as the opening film. Lead actor and producer Kareena Kapoor Khan was joined by director Hansal Mehta, producer Ekta Kapoor and actors Ranveer Brar, Ash Tandon and Prabhleen Sandhu.\n\nThe Buckingham Murders screening at Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2023: Kareena Kapoor Khan LAUDED for turning producer; says “I am a huge fan of Hansal Mehta’s films; he has given me one of my career’s BEST roles”\n\nWhile speaking to Anupama Chopra, Kareena Kapoor Khan said, “Today, I am feeling as if this is my first film. I am nervous as it’s a different kind of genre that we have attempted. It’s the first time I have worked with actors who come from a completely different world. Most of the actors were from the UK. Ranveer, Prableen and I were the only actors from India and we were thrown into a different world. But I think we have made a good film. It’s my favourite genre. That’s why, I have attached my name with my favourite producer, Ekta. I have been a huge fan of Hansal’s films. He has given me one of my career’s best roles!” As expected, there was a huge round of applause for the last sentence.\n\nEkta Kapoor remarked, “It’s very easy to put women on a pedestal and celebrate. Then, you’re again putting them in a box and saying ‘This version of you needs to be celebrated’. For me, that itself is putting conditions on another person, which becomes a big problem. If I get a chance to go through a script that brings out a flaw without justifying it but still resonates with me, I’d love to put my name to it.”\n\nEkta was all praises for Kareena Kapoor Khan, “To be producing this film with an actor who not only was brave enough to stand by this film but also to put her name first time as a producer…the sheer grit and grace of Kareena Kapoor, it’s such an honour!”\n\nAsh Tandon, too, couldn’t stop praising the talented performer, “She’s incredibly instinctive. I was meanwhile prepping all the time. Everyone would ask me ‘Why are you carrying the folder’? I would be like, ‘I am writing notes. If I lose it, I can’t do the job’!”\n\nRanveer Brar, “Even if it was my close shot, she (Kareena) sat through with the same intensity, giving the same reaction and reciprocating the same way, as if the camera was on her. That professionalism and love for the craft were (praiseworthy).”\n\nBollywood Hungama was the first one to break the news that The Buckingham Murders will be the opening film at the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival 2023. It is a story about a mother, with a traumatic past, who is assigned the case of a murdered child in a town in the United Kingdom.\n\nAlso Read: Kareena Kapoor Khan starrer The Buckingham Murders opened the Jio MAMI film festival!\n\nMore Pages: The Buckingham Murders Box Office Collection\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS - LIVE UPDATES"
