Or characters growing or characters changing or characters learning to like each other or characters overcoming obstacles to succeed in the end. Y'know ? Movie shit.\"\n\nKaufman is sweating like crazy now. Valerie is quiet for a moment - from \"Adaptation\".\n\nWe are all about CINEMA. That movie shit.\n\nNOTHING is sacred.\n\nNOBODY is spared.\n\nBecause we talk about films, dammit.\n\nNot your sex life.\n\nFilms, fests, unsung, indies, undiscovered - all that and some fun. If you have dope on anything related to cinema or you would like to share something, do write to us at moifightclub@gmail.com.\n\nThanks to TIFF, few stills of Hansal Mehta‘s new film Shahid is finally online. Also, the official synopsis and the cast and crew list. The film is going to have its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in its “City To City” programme where “Mumbai” is in focus this year.\n\nThe stills look stark and powerful and creates a deadly mood. And now the official synopsis of the film…\n\nShahid is the remarkable true story of slain human rights activist and lawyer Shahid Azmi, who was killed in 2010 by unidentified assailants in his office. From attempting to become a terrorist, to being wrongly imprisoned under a draconian anti-terrorism law, to becoming a champion of human rights (particularly of the Muslim minorities in India), Shahid traces the inspiring personal journey of a boy who became an unlikely messiah for human rights, while following the rise of communal violence in India. This story of an impoverished Muslim struggling to come to terms with injustice and inequality, whilerising above his circumstances is an inspiring testament to the human spirit. Starring Raj Kumar, Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur.\n\nAnd here’s the cast and crew list…\n\nDirector: Hansal Mehta\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nRuntime: 123 minutes\n\nExec.
