        "text": "Delayed complications after flow-diverter stenting: reactive in-stent stenosis and creeping stents.\n\nPubMed\n\nCohen, JosÃ© E; Gomori, John Moshe; Moscovici, Samuel; Leker, Ronen R; Itshayek, Eyal\n\n2014-07-01\n\nWe assessed the frequency and severity of changes in stent configuration and location after the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, and patterns of in-stent stenosis. We retrospectively reviewed data for consecutive aneurysm patients managed with endovascular implantation of flow-diverter stents (Silk Flow Diverter [Balt Extrusion, Montmorency, France] and Pipeline Embolization Device [ev3/Coviden, Minneapolis, MN, USA]) from October 2011 to July 2012. Routine 2, 6, 9-12, and 16-20 month follow-up angiograms were compared, with a focus on changes in stent configuration and location from immediately after deployment to angiographic follow-up, and the incidence and development of in-stent stenosis. Thirty-four patients with 42 aneurysms met inclusion criteria. The Silk device was implanted in 16 patients (47%, single device in 15), the Pipeline device in 18 (53%, single device in 16). On first follow-up angiography, in-stent stenosis was observed in 38% of Silk devices and 39% of Pipeline devices. In-stent stenosis was asymptomatic in 12 of 13 patients. One woman presented with transient ischemic attacks and required stent angioplasty due to end tapering and mild, diffuse in-stent stenosis. Configuration and location changes, including stent creeping and end tapering were seen in 2/16 patients (13%) with Silk devices, and 0/18 patients with Pipeline devices. We describe stent creeping and end tapering as unusual findings with the potential for delayed clinical complications. In-stent stenosis, with a unique behavior, is a frequent angiographic finding observed after flow-diverter stent implant. The stenosis is usually asymptomatic; however, close clinical and angiographic monitoring is mandatory for individualized management. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically for endovascular treatments, the effects of indwelling intravascular devices on blood stream need to be considered. The most recent technology used for cerebral aneurysm treatment is related to the use of flow diverters to reduce the amount of flow entering the aneurysm. To verify the differences of flow reduction, we analyzed multiple Enterprise stents and two kinds of flow diverters. Materials and Methods: In this research, we virtually modeled three kinds of commercial intracranial stents (Enterprise, Silk, and Pipeline) and mounted to fit into the vessel wall, and deployed across the neck of an IC-ophthalmic artery aneurysm. Also, we compared the differences among multiple Enterprise stents and two flow diverters in a standalone mode. Results: From the numerical results, the values of wall shear stress and pressure are reduced in proportion to the size of mesh, especially in the inflow area. However, the reduced velocity within the aneurysm sac by the multiple stents is not as significant as the flow diverters. Conclusions: This is the first study analyzing the flow alterations among multiple Enterprise stents and flow diverters. The placement of small meshed stents dramatically reduced the aneurysmal fluid movement. However, compared to the flow diverters, we did not observe the reduction of flow velocity within the aneurysm by the multiple stents.

Recurrent aneurysms for which stent-assisted embolization has failed are a therapeutic challenge, given the existing intraluminal construct with continued blood flow into the aneurysm. We report our experience using flow-diverting stents in the repair of 25 aneurysms for which stent-assisted embolization had failed. Nineteen (76%) of these aneurysms at the 12-month follow-up showed improved Raymond class occlusion, with 38% being completely occluded, and all aneurysms demonstrated decreased filling. One patient developed a moderate permanent neurologic deficit. Appropriate stent sizing, proximal and distal construct coverage, and preventing flow diverter deployment between the previously deployed stent struts are important considerations to ensure wall apposition and prevention of endoleak. Flow diverters are shown to be a reasonable option for treating previously stented recurrent cerebral aneurysms. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

While current commercial flow diverting stents rely on a dense mesh of braided coils for flow diversion, our group has been developing a method to selectively occlude the aneurysm neck, without endangering nearby perforator vessels. In this paper, we present a new method of fabricating the low porosity patch, a key element of such asymmetric vascular stents (AVS).

The patient was successfully managed with dual implantation of flow-diverter and conventional carotid stent. Flow-diverter was placed across the neck of pseudoaneurysm to provide flow diversion while carotid stent was implanted within the lumen of the expanded flow-diverter to approximate and hold the flow diverter proximal and distal to the pseudoaneurysm. Follow-up ultrasonography revealed complete resolution of the pseudoaneurysm.

Flow-diverting stents are an alternative for complex cases. These stents have proven to be effective treatment devices for intracranial aneurysms. The reference list of Pham's systematic review, published in 2011, and Seward's literature review, published in 2015, was considered, as well as all new articles with eligible features. Search was conducted on specific databases: MEDLINE and Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em CiÃªncias da SaÃºde. For carotid dissection and pseudoaneurysm, our review yielded 3 published articles including 12 patients. The technical success rate of flow-diverting stent was 100% with no procedural complication described. Mean clinical follow-up was 27.2Â months (range 5-48), and in 5Â months' angiographic follow-up, all lesions had healed. No new neurological events were reported during the clinical follow-up. Flow diverter stent use on intracranial and peripheral vascular surgery demonstrates satisfactory initial results, but it is still under investigation. There are very few cases treated till now and the initial results with flow-diverting stents to cervical carotid dissection are promising. In well-selected cases, where simple embolization or conventional stent is not appropriate, this technic may be considered. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In this research, we simulated three aneurysms constructed from 3D digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The Enterprise, LVIS and the Pipeline device were virtually conformed to fit into the vessel lumen and placed across the aneurysm orifice. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to compare the hemodynamic differences such as WSS, Velocity and Pressure among these stents. Control referred to the unstented model, the percentage of hemodynamic changes were all compared to Control. A single LVIS stent caused more wall shear stress reduction than double Enterprise stents (39.96 vs. 30.51Â %) and velocity (23.13 vs. 18.64Â %). Significant reduction in wall shear stress (63.88Â %) and velocity (46.05Â %) was observed in the double-LVIS stents. A single Pipeline showed less reduction in WSS (51.08Â %) and velocity (37.87Â %) compared with double-LVIS stent. The double-Pipeline stents resulted in the most reduction in WSS (72.37Â %) and velocity (54.26Â %). Moreover, the pressure increased with minuscule extent after stenting, compared with the unstented model. This is the first study analyzing flow modifications associated with LVIS stents. We found that the LVIS stent has certain hemodynamic effects on cerebral aneurysms: a single LVIS stent caused more flow reductions than the double-Enterprise stent but less than a Pipeline device. Nevertheless, the double-LVIS stent resulted in a better flow diverting effect than a Pipeline device.\n\nFlow Diverters for Intracranial Aneurysms\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlderazi, Yazan J.; Kass-Hout, Tareq; Prestigiacomo, Charles J.; Gandhi, Chirag D.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFlow diverters (pipeline embolization device, Silk flow diverter, and Surpass flow diverter) have been developed to treat intracranial aneurysms. These endovascular devices are placed within the parent artery rather than the aneurysm sac. They take advantage of altering hemodynamics at the aneurysm/parent vessel interface, resulting in gradual thrombosis of the aneurysm occurring over time. Subsequent inflammatory response, healing, and endothelial growth shrink the aneurysm and reconstruct the parent artery lumen while preserving perforators and side branches in most cases. Flow diverters have already allowed treatment of previously untreatable wide neck and giant aneurysms. There are risks with flow diverters including in-stent thrombosis, perianeurysmal edema, distant and delayed hemorrhages, and perforator occlusions. Comparative efficacy and safety against other therapies are being studied in ongoing trials. Antiplatelet therapy is mandatory with flow diverters, which has highlighted the need for better evidence for monitoring and tailoring antiplatelet therapy. In this paper we review the devices, their uses, associated complications, evidence base, and ongoing studies. PMID:24967131\n\nComputational Study of Intracranial Aneurysms with Flow Diverting Stent: Correlation with Surgical Outcome\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTang, Yik Sau; Chiu, Tin Lok; Tsang, Anderson Chun On; Leung, Gilberto Ka Kit; Chow, Kwok Wing\n\n2016-11-01\n\nIntracranial aneurysm, abnormal swelling of the cerebral artery, can cause massive internal bleeding in the subarachnoid space upon aneurysm rupture, leading to a high mortality rate. Deployment of a flow diverting stent through endovascular technique can obstruct the blood flow into the aneurysm, thus reducing the risk of rupture. Patient-specific models with both bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms have been investigated. Computational fluid dynamics analysis with physiological boundary conditions has been performed. Several hemodynamic parameters including volume flow rate into the aneurysm and the energy (sum of the fluid kinetic and potential energy) loss between the inlet and outlets were analyzed and compared with the surgical outcome. Based on the simulation results, we conjecture that a clinically successful case might imply less blood flow into the aneurysm after stenting, and thus a smaller amount of energy loss in driving the fluid flow in that portion of artery. This study might provide physicians with quantitative information for surgical decision making.

Successful treatment is highly dependent on the degree of flow reduction and the altered hemodynamics inside the aneurysm sac following treatment. Establishing a causal connection between hemodynamic metrics of FDS-treated CAs and long-term clinical outcomes requires a rigorous parametric characterization of this flow environment. We use 3D particle image velocimetry (PIV) to measure the flow inside idealized aneurysm models treated with FDS. Physiologically realistic Reynolds numbers and increasing levels of parent vessel curvature are analyzed to understand the effect of inertia on flow development. The flow velocity into the aneurysm and the topology of the flow inside the sac is shown to be highly dependent on parent vessel Dean number (De). The role of flow pulsatility is then added to the study via time-dependent waveforms. Velocity measurements at 2 values of parent vessel Womersley number (Wo) allow us to parameterize flow inside of CAs treated with FDS as a function of De, Re and Wo, improving the fundamental understanding of how FDS alter CA hemodynamics and aiding in the development of new treatments.\n\nEndothelialization of over- and undersized flow-diverter stents at covered vessel side branches: An in vivo and in silico study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBerg, Philipp; Iosif, Christina; Ponsonnard, Sebastien; Yardin, Catherine; Janiga, GÃ¡bor; Mounayer, Charbel\n\n2016-01-04\n\nAlthough flow-diverting devices are promising treatment options for intracranial aneurysms, jailed side branches might occlude leading to insufficient blood supply. Especially differences in the local stent strut compression may have a drastic influence on subsequent endothelialization. To investigate the outcome of different treatment scenarios, over- and undersized stent deployments were realized experimentally and computationally. Two Pipeline Embolization Devices were placed in the right common carotid artery of large white swine, crossing the right ascending pharyngeal artery. DSA and PC-MRI measurements were acquired pre- and post-stenting and after three months. To evaluate the stent strut endothelialization and the corresponding ostium patency, the swine were sacrificed and scanning electron microscopy measurements were carried out. A more detailed analysis of the near-stent hemodynamics was enabled by a realistic virtual stenting in combination with highly resolved Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations using case-specific boundary conditions. The oversizing resulted in an elongated stent deployment with more open stent pores, while for the undersized case a shorter deployment with more condensed pores was present. In consequence, the side branch of the first case remained patent after three months and the latter almost fully occluded. The virtual investigation confirmed the experimental findings by identifying differences between the individual velocities as well as stent shear stresses at the distal part of the ostia. The choice of flow-diverting device and the subsequent deployment strategy strongly influences the patency of jailed side branches. Therefore, careful treatment planning is required, to guarantee sufficient blood supply in the brain territories supplied those branches. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to highly irregular manifold aneurysm shapes and locations, the choice of the stent and the patient-specific deployment strategy can be a very difficult decision. To support the therapy planning, a new method is introduced that combines a three-dimensional CFD-based optimization with a realistic deployment of a virtual flow diverting stent for a given aneurysm. To demonstrate the feasibility of this method, it was applied to a patient-specific intracranial giant aneurysm that was successfully treated using a commercial flow diverter. Eight treatment scenarios with different local compressions were considered in a fully automated simulation loop. The impact on the corresponding blood flow behavior was evaluated qualitatively as well as quantitatively, and the optimal configuration for this specific case was identified. The virtual deployment of an uncompressed flow diverter reduced the inflow into the aneurysm by 24.4% compared to the untreated case. Depending on the positioning of the local stent compression below the ostium, blood flow reduction could vary between 27.3% and 33.4%. Therefore, a broad range of potential treatment outcomes was identified, illustrating the variability of a given flow diverter deployment in general. This method represents a proof of concept to automatically identify the optimal treatment for a patient in a virtual study under certain assumptions. Hence, it contributes to the improvement of virtual stenting for intracranial aneurysms and can support physicians during therapy planning in the future. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent advancement shows that a new device, âflow-diverterâ, can divert blood flow away from the aneurysm sac. People found that a flow-diverter based on thin film nitinol (TFN), works very effectively, however there are no studies proving the mechanical safety in irregular, curved blood vessels. Here, we study the mechanical behaviors and structural safety of a novel microstructured TFN membrane through the computational and experimental studies, which establish the fundamental aspects of stretching and bending mechanics of the structure. The result shows a hyper-elastic behavior of the TFN with a negligible strain change up to 180Â° in bending and over 500% in radial stretching, which is ideal in the use in neurovascular curved arteries. The simulation determines the optimal joint locations between the TFN and stent frame. In vitro experimental test qualitatively demonstrates the mechanical flexibility of the flow-diverter with multi-modal bending. In vivo micro X-ray and histopathology study demonstrate that the TFN can be conformally deployed in the curved blood vessel of a swine model without any significant complications or abnormalities.\n\nMicrostructured Thin Film Nitinol for a Neurovascular Flow-Diverter\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Yanfei; Howe, Connor; Lee, Yongkuk; Cheon, Seongsik; Yeo, Woon-Hong; Chun, Youngjae\n\n2016-01-01\n\nA cerebral aneurysm occurs as a result of a weakened blood vessel, which allows blood to flow into a sac or a ballooned section.

(Inventor)\n\n1964-01-01\n\nA flow diverter valve applicable to any fluid flow system requiring rapid bleed or bypass is disclosed. Examples of application of the flow diverter valve to a liquid rocket and a turbojet aircraft engine are given. Features of the valve include: (1) an independent fluid source is used to activate the flow diverter valve toward its closed position during its initial stage of travel; (2) the flow diverter port area and size is unlimited and the valve travel is unlimited; and (3) the valve housing is fabricated such that the valve can be a one step valve, a two step valve, or include as many steps as are found desirable.\n\nA New Flow-Diverter (the FloWise): In-Vivo Evaluation in an Elastase-Induced Rabbit Aneurysm Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Byung Moon; Kim, Dong Joon; Kim, Dong Ik\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a newly developed, partially retrievable flow-diverter (the FloWise) in an elastase-induced rabbit aneurysm model. We developed a partially retrievable flow diverter composed of 48 strands of Nitinol and platinum wire. The FloWise is compatible with any microcatheter of 0.027-inch inner diameter, and is retrievable up to 70% deployment. The efficacy and safety of the FloWise were evaluated in the elastase-induced rabbit aneurysm model. The rate of technical success (full coverage of aneurysm neck) and assessment of aneurysm occlusion and stent patency was conducted by angiograms and histologic examinations at the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. The patency of small arterial branches (intercostal or lumbar arteries) covered by the FloWise were also assessed in the 5 subjects. We attempted FloWise insertion in a total of 32 aneurysm models. FloWise placement was successful in 31 subjects (96.9%). Two stents (6.2%) were occluded at the 3-month follow-up, but there was no evidence of in-stent stenosis in other subjects. All stented aneurysms showed progressive occlusion: grade I (complete aneurysm occlusion) in 44.4% and grade II (aneurysm occlusion > 90%) in 55.6% at 1 month; grade I in 90% and II in 10% at 3 months; and grade I in 90% and II in 10% at 6 months. All small arterial branches covered by the FloWise remained patent. A newly developed, partially retrievable flow-diverter seems to be a safe and effective tool of aneurysm occlusion, as evaluated in the rabbit aneurysm model.\n\nDoes the gravity orientation of saccular aneurysms influence hemodynamics? An experimental study with and without flow diverter stent.\n\nPubMed\n\nChodzyÅski, Kamil J; Eker, Omer F; Vanrossomme, Axel E; de Sousa, Daniel Ribeiro; Coussement, GrÃ©gory; Vanhamme, Luc; Dubois, Frank; BonafÃ©, Alain; Chopard, Bastien; Courbebaisse, Guy; Zouaoui Boudjeltia, Karim\n\n2016-12-08\n\nMost intracranial aneurysms morphologic studies focused on characterization of size, location, aspect ratio, relationship to the surrounding vasculature and hemodynamics. However, the spatial orientation with respect to the gravity direction has not been taken into account although it could trigger various hemodynamic conditions. The present work addresses this possibility. It was divided in two parts: 1) the orientations of 18, 3D time-of-flight MRI (3D TOF MRI), scans of saccular aneurysms were analyzed. This investigation suggested that there was no privileged orientation for cerebral aneurysms. The aneurysms were oriented in the brain as follows: 9 - down, 9 - up; 11 - right, 7 - left; 6 - front, 12 - back. 2) Based on these results, subsidiary in vitro experiments were performed, analyzing the behavior of red blood cells (RBCs) within a silicone model of aneurysm before and after flow diverter stent (FDS) deployment in the parent vessel. These experiments used a test bench that reproduces physiological pulsatile flow conditions for two orientations: an aneurysm sack pointing either up (opposite to gravitational force) and down (along the gravitational force). The results showed that the orientation of an aneurysm significantly affects the intra-aneurysmal RBCs behavior after stenting, and therefore that gravity can affect the intra-aneurysm behavior of RBCs. This suggests that the patient×³s aneurysm orientation could impact the outcome of the FDS treatment. The implementation of this effect in patient-specific numerical and preoperative decision support techniques could contribute to better understand the intrasaccular biological and hemodynamic events induced by FDS.

If left unchecked, undesired flows mix substantial amounts of partially heated and partially cooled portions of working fluid, effectively causing leakage of heat from heated side to cooled side. By reducing leakage of heat, flow diverters increase energy efficiency of magnetic heat pump, potentially offering efficiency greater than compressor-driven refrigerator.\n\nNeurovascular stent artifacts in 3D-TOF and 3D-PCMRI: Influence of stent design on flow measurement.\n\nPubMed\n\nBouillot, Pierre; Brina, Olivier; Delattre, BÃ©nÃ©dicte M A; Ouared, Rafik; Pellaton, Alain; Yilmaz, Hasan; Machi, Paolo; Lovblad, Karl-Olof; Farhat, Mohamed; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Vargas, Maria Isabel\n\n2018-06-12\n\nThe morphological and hemodynamic evaluations of neurovascular diseases treated with stents would benefit from noninvasive imaging techniques such as 3D time-of-flight MRI (3D-TOF) and 3D phase contrast MRI (3D-PCMRI). For this purpose, a comprehensive evaluation of the stent artifacts and their impact on the flow measurement is critical. The artifacts of a representative sample of neurovascular stents were evaluated in vitro with 3D-TOF and 3D-PCMRI sequences. The dependency of the artifacts with respect to the orientation was analyzed for each stent design as well as the impact on the flow measurement accuracy. Furthermore, the 3D-PCMRI data of four patients carrying intracranial aneurysms treated with flow diverter stents were analyzed as illustrative examples. The stent artifacts were mainly confined to the stent lumen therefore indicating the leading role of shielding effect. The influence of the stent design and its orientation with respect to the transmitting MR coils were highlighted. The artifacts impacted the 3D-PCMRI velocities mainly in the low magnitude domains, which were discarded from the analysis ensuring reliable near-stent velocities. The feasibility of in-stent flow measurements was confirmed in vivo on two patients who showed strong correlation between flow and geometric features. In two other patients, the consistency of out-of-stent velocities was verified qualitatively through intra-aneurysmal streamlines except when susceptibility artifacts occurred. The present results motivate the conception of low inductance or nonconductive stent design. Furthermore, the feasibility of near-stent 3D-PCMRI measurements opens the door to clinical applications like the post-treatment follow-up of stenoses or intracranial aneurysms.

Vascular disruption is often treated with emergent vessel deconstruction, incurring complications in a subset of patients with poor collateral circulation and resulting in minor and major ischemic strokes. We attempted a novel approach combining a covered stent graft (Jostent) and two flow diverter stents [Pipeline embolization devices (PEDs)] to treat active extravasation from a disrupted right ICA that was the result of a transsphenoidal surgery complication. This disruption occurred during clival tumor surgery and required immediate sphenoidal sinus packing. Emergent angiography revealed continued petrous carotid artery extravasation, warranting emergent vessel repair or deconstruction for treatment. To preserve the vessel, we utilized a covered Jostent. Due to tortuosity and lack of optimal wall apposition, there was reduced, yet persistent extravasation from an endoleak after Jostent deployment that failed to resolve despite multiple angioplasties. Therefore, we used PEDs to divert the flow. Flow diversion relieved the extravasation. The patient remained neurologically intact post-procedure. This case demonstrates successful combined use of a covered stent and flow diverters to treat acute vascular injury resulting from transsphenoidal surgery. However, concerns remain, including the requirement of dual antiplatelet agents increasing postoperative bleeding risks, stent-related thromboembolic events, and delayed in-stent restenosis rates.\n\nFlow Diverter Stents for the Treatment of Anterior Cerebral Artery Aneurysms: Safety and Effectiveness.\n\nPubMed\n\nClarenÃ§on, F; Di Maria, F; Gabrieli, J; Shotar, E; Zeghal, C; Nouet, A; Chiras, J; Sourour, N-A\n\n2017-03-01\n\nFlow diverter stents (FDSs) are increasingly used for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Initially developed for the management of giant and large aneurysms, their indications have progressively expanded. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of FDSs for the treatment of anterior cerebral artery (ACA) aneurysms. Among the 94 consecutive patients treated for 100 intracranial aneurysms by means of FDSs in our institution from October 2010 to January 2015, eight aneurysms (8â%) in seven patients were located on the ACA. Three aneurysms were located on the A1 segment, three aneurysms on the anterior communicating artery (ACom) and two on the A2-A3 junction. In three cases, FDS was used for angiographic recurrence after coiling. Five patients were treated with a Pipeline embolization device, one with a NeuroEndograft and the last one with a Silk FDS. Treatment was feasible in all cases. No technical difficulty was reported. No acute or delayed clinical complication was recorded. Modified Rankin Scale was 0 for six patients and one for one patient. Mean angiographic follow-up was 9.7âÂ±â3.9 months (range 6-15). Total exclusion was observed in five aneurysms (71.4â%) and neck remnant in two (28.6â%) cases. One patient refused the control DSA. Our series shows the safety and effectiveness of FDSs for the treatment of ACA aneurysms.\n\nVery late ischemic complications in flow-diverter stents: a retrospective analysis of a single-center series.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuÃ©don, Alexis; ClarenÃ§on, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Di Maria, Federico; Rosso, Charlotte; Biondi, Alessandra; Gabrieli, Joseph; Rojas, Patricia; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader\n\n2016-10-01\n\nOBJECTIVE The authors evaluate the rate and discuss the pathomechanisms of very late (â¥ 4-month) ischemic complications after flow-diverter stent (FDS) placement for intracranial aneurysms. METHODS The authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of the patients treated at PitiÃ©-SalpÃªtriÃ¨re Hospital between January 2010 and September 2014, who underwent FDS placement for intracranial aneurysm. The patients received dual-antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel and aspirin) 5 days before and 3-6 months after the procedure and then aspirin alone for 6-9 months. An ischemic complication was defined as a sudden focal neurological deficit documented on diffusion-weighted images. RESULTS Eighty-six consecutive patients were included. Three (3.5%) patients treated with the Pipeline embolization device experienced a delayed acute ischemic stroke (2 cases of perforator/side-wall branch infarction and 1 case of thromboembolic stroke) with an average delay of 384 days (4 months, 20 months, and 13 months, respectively). The aneurysm locations were the left superior cerebellar artery, the right anterior choroid artery, and the left internal carotid artery (paraclinoid segment), respectively. The complications occurred after the patients had completed the antiaggregation protocol, except for Patient 1, who was receiving aspirin alone because of a spontaneous hematoma. At the acute phase, no in-stent thromboses were found on digital subtraction angiography. In Patient 2, the treated anterior choroid artery was occluded 20 months after the procedure. In Patient 3, a focal stenosis (approximately 40%) of the distal aspect of the FDS, probably caused by intimal hyperplasia, was seen. CONCLUSIONS Very late ischemic complications after FDS treatment were observed in 3.5% of the cases in the authors' series, some of which occurred as late as more than 1 year after placement.\n\nEndovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms with the p64 flow diverter stent: mid-term results in 35 patients with 41 intracranial aneurysms.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorais, Ricardo; Mine, Benjamin; BruyÃ¨re, Pierre Julien; Naeije, Gilles; Lubicz, Boris\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThe p64 flow diverter (FD) device is a fully resheathable and detachable stent dedicated for endovascular treatment (EVT) of intracranial aneurysms (IAs). We report our mid-term experience with this device. Between January 2015 and February 2016, we retrospectively identified, in our prospectively maintained database, all patients treated with p64 FDs in two institutions. Independent clinical follow-up was performed by a vascular neurologist. Imaging follow-up included a digitalized subtraction angiography (DSA) at 3, 6, and 12Â months and a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at 12Â months. Thirty-nine patients (22 women/17 men; median age 54Â years) with 48 IAs (median aneurysm size 6.2Â mm; mean neck size 3.4Â mm) were identified. All IAs were saccular and unruptured. Failure of safe stent delivery occurred in 15% of cases (7/48 IAs) which were excluded. Transient neurological morbidity occurred in 2/35 patients (5.7%) including one delayed thromboembolic complication. No permanent morbidity or mortality was encountered. Complete aneurysmal occlusion at 3, 6, and 12Â months was 20/30 (66.6%), 18/27 (66.6%), and 24/28 (85.7%), respectively. Intra-stent stenosis was observed in 9/29 patients (31%) and classified as moderate in 4/29 (13.7%) and mild in 5/29 patients (17.2%). These stenoses gradually improved over time, with only mild stenoses being identified at 6Â months and at 12Â months. In our small case series, the p64 FD stent appears safe and effective for EVT of IAs. A high occlusion rate and a low morbidity rate were observed.\n\nRenal hemodynamics: the influence of the renal artery ostium flow diverter\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRossmann, Jenn Stroud; Albert, Scott; Balaban, Robert\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe recently identified renal artery ostium flow diverter may preferentially direct blood flow to the renal arteries, and may also influence flow patterns and recirculation known to be involved in atherogenesis. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of steady and pulsatile blood flow are performed to investigate the influence of diverter size and position, and vascular geometry, on the flow patterns and fluid mechanical forces in the neighborhood of the diverter. CFD results show that the flow diverter does affect the blood distribution: depending on the diverter's position, the flow to the renal arteries may be increased or reduced. The results of simulations also show the diverter's effect on the Wall Shear Stress (WSS) distribution, and suggest that the diverter contributes to an atherogenic environment in the abdominal aorta, while being atheroprotective in the renal arteries themselves. These results support previous clinical findings, and suggest directions for further clinical study. The results of this work have direct implications in understanding the physiological significance of the diverter, and its potential role in the pathophysiological development of atherosclerosis.\n\nInfluence of the renal artery ostium flow diverter on hemodynamics and atherogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlbert, Scott; Balaban, Robert S; Neufeld, Edward B; Rossmann, Jenn Stroud\n\n2014-05-07\n\nThe structure and function of the renal artery ostium flow diverter on the caudal side of the renal branch point were previously reported; in this study, we further evaluate the diverter×³s possible functions.

All IAA exceeded a diameter of 3 cm or were symptomatic. Follow-up (FU) examinations included CT or MR angiography, sonography, and clinical assessment up to 2 years.ResultsPrimary stent placement was technically successful in eight of ten cases. In two cases, severe stent retraction during deployment necessitated placement of an additional stent. Immediately after stent placement, a marked reduction of flowmoreÂ Â» within the sac was observed in all cases (peri-interventional mortality 0 %). During FU, there were two thrombotic stent occlusions, making reintervention necessary (primary patency rate 80 %, secondary patency 100 %). Four IAA were completely occluded at FU, whereas the original vessel and covered branches (n = 8) were patent. In four IAA, there was still residual perfusion. In one patient, IAA diameter decreased slightly, while it remained constant in seven (mean imaging FU 195 (range 1-695) days). There were no adverse events on clinical FU (mean FU 467 (range 101-695) days).ConclusionsOther studies showed the Cardiatis-Multilayer-Stent to be a technically relatively simple treatment option for complex IAA with inadequate landing zones, especially in patients with multiple comorbidities to avoid ipsilateral IIA obstruction. However, in our series complication rate was high. Incomplete sac exclusion, stent-shortening, and thrombotic occlusion can complicate treatment, making meticulous patient selection necessary. Close imaging surveillance is mandatory especially in the early postinterventional period.Â«Â less\n\nDiverting lava flows in the lab\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nDietterich, Hannah; Cashman, Katharine V.; Rust, Alison C.; Lev, Einat\n\n2015-01-01\n\nRecent volcanic eruptions in Hawai'i, Iceland and Cape Verde highlight the challenges of mitigating hazards when lava flows threaten infrastructure. Diversion barriers are the most common form of intervention, but historical attempts to divert lava flows have met with mixed successÂ and there has been little systematic analysis of optimal barrier design. We examine the interaction of viscous flows of syrup and molten basalt with barriers in the laboratory. We find that flows thicken immediately upslope of an obstacle, forming a localized bow wave that can overtop barriers. Larger bow waves are generated by faster flows and by obstacles oriented at a high angle to the flow direction. The geometry of barriers also influences flow behaviour. Barriers designed to split or dam flows will slow flow advance, but cause the flow to widen, whereas oblique barriers can effectively divert flows, but may also accelerate flow advance. We argue that to be successful, mitigation of lava-flow hazards must incorporate the dynamics of lava flowâobstacle interactions into barrier design. The same generalizations apply to the effect of natural topographic features on flow geometry and advance rates.\n\nFlow-independent dynamics in aneurysm (FIDA): pressure measurements following partial and complete flow impairment in experimental aneurysm model\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWatanabe, Masaki; Chaudhry, Saqib A; Qureshi, Adnan I\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground: There have been growing concerns regarding delayed aneurysm rupture subsequent to the flow-diverting stent deployment. Therefore, more investigations are needed regarding hemodynamic changes secondary to flow-diverting stent deployment. Objective: To study intra-aneurysmal and perianeurysmal pressures after partial and complete flow impairment into the aneurysm. Methods A silicone model of an 8-mm-sized aneurysm (neck diameter: 5 mm, vessel size: 4 mm) was used. The aneurysm wall was encapsulated and sealed within a 5 ml syringe filled with saline and a pressure sensor guide wire (ComboWire, Volcano Corp.) to detect pressure changes in the perivascular compartment (outer aneurysm wall). A second pressure sensor guide wire was advanced inside the aneurysm sac. Both pressure sensors were continuously measuring pressure inside and outside the aneurysm under pulsatile flow under the following conditions: 1) baseline (reference); 2) a 16 mm by 3.75 mm flow-diverting stent (ev3/Covidien Vascular, Mansfield, MA) deployed in front of the aneurysm; 3) two flow-diverting stents (16 mm by 3.5 mm) were deployed; and 4) a covered stent (4 mm by 16 mm VeriFlex coronary artery stent covered with rubber sheet) was deployed. Results: Mean (Â±SD) baseline pressures inside and outside the aneurysm were 53.9 (Â±2.4) mmHg (range 120â40 mmHg) and 15.4 (Â±0.7) mmHg (range 40â8mmHg), respectively. There was no change in pressure inside and outside the aneurysm after deploying the first and second flow-diverting stents (partial flow impairment) and it remained at 53.9 (Â±2.7) mmHg and 14.9 (Â±1) mmHg for the pressure inside and outside the aneurysm, respectively. The pressure recording from outside the aneurysm dropped from 15.4 (Â±0.7) mmHg to 0.3 (Â±0.7) mmHg after deploying the covered stent (complete flow impairment). There was no change in pressure inside the aneurysm after deploying the covered stent. Mean (Â±SD) pressure within the aneurysm was 55.1 (Â±1.7) mmHg and\n\nCorrelation between Hemodynamics and Treatment Outcome of Intracranial Aneurysms after Intervention with Flow Diverters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPaliwal, Nikhil; Damiano, Robert; Davies, Jason; Siddiqui, Adnan; Meng, Hui\n\n2015-11-01\n\nEndovascular intervention by Flow Diverter (FD) - a densely woven stent - occludes an aneurysm by inducing thrombosis in the aneurysm sac and reconstructing the vessel. Hemodynamics plays a vital role in the thrombotic occlusion of aneurysms and eventual treatment outcome. CFD analysis of pre- and post-treatment aneurysms not only provides insight of flow modifications by FD, but also allows investigation of interventional strategies and prediction of their outcome. In this study 80 patient-specific aneurysms treated with FDs were retrospectively studied to evaluate the effect of intervention. Out of these cases, 16 required retreatment and thus are considered as having unfavorable outcome. Clinical FD deployment in these cases was simulated using an efficient virtual stenting workflow. CFD analysis was carried out on both pre- and post-treatment cases, and changes in hemodynamic parameters were calculated. Support vector machine algorithm was used to correlate the hemodynamic changes with outcome. Results show that cases having higher flow reduction into the aneurysmal sac have a better likelihood of occlusion. This suggests that changes in hemodynamics can be potentially used to predict the outcome of different clinical intervention strategies in aneurysms. This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R01 NS091075).\n\nParticle imaging velocimetry evaluation of intracranial stents in sidewall aneurysm: hemodynamic transition related to the stent design.\n\nPubMed\n\nBouillot, Pierre; Brina, Olivier; Ouared, Rafik; Lovblad, Karl-Olof; Farhat, Mohamed; Pereira, Vitor Mendes\n\n2014-01-01\n\nWe investigated the flow modifications induced by a large panel of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) intracranial stents in an idealized sidewall intracranial aneurysm (IA). Flow velocities in IA silicone model were assessed with and without stent implantation using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). The use of the recently developed multi-time-lag method has allowed for uniform and precise measurements of both high and low velocities at IA neck and dome, respectively. Flow modification analysis of both regular (RSs) and flow diverter stents (FDSs) was subsequently correlated with relevant geometrical stent parameters. Flow reduction was found to be highly sensitive to stent porosity variations for regular stents RSs and moderately sensitive for FDSs. Consequently, two distinct IA flow change trends, with velocity reductions up to 50% and 90%, were identified for high-porosity RS and low-porosity FDS, respectively. The intermediate porosity (88%) regular braided stent provided the limit at which the transition in flow change trend occurred with a flow reduction of 84%. This transition occurred with decreasing stent porosity, as the driving force in IA neck changed from shear stress to differential pressure. Therefore, these results suggest that stents with intermediate porosities could possibly provide similar flow change patterns to FDS, favourable to curative thrombogenesis in IAs.\n\nSolitaire FR stent as an adjunctive tool for pipeline stent deployment in the treatment of giant intracranial aneurysms.\n\nPubMed\n\nClarenÃ§on, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Wyse, Gerald; Fanning, Noel; Di Maria, Federico; Gaston, AndrÃ©; Chiras, Jacques; Sourour, Nader\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe use of flow-diverting stents has gained acceptance during the past few years for the treatment of numerous intracranial aneurysms, especially large or giant ones. However, successful catheterization of the distal parent artery in giant intracranial aneurysms with a microcatheter can be extremely challenging. Forming a microcatheter loop in the aneurysm sac can aid distal catheterization. We report the use of a Solitaire FR stent as an adjunctive tool in the successful treatment of 2 giant intracranial unruptured aneurysms with a Pipeline Embolization Device. After having formed a loop inside the aneurysm sac, the microcatheter was anchored distally by a Solitaire FR stent. With the Solitaire FR device opened, the loop in the giant aneurysm sac was completely reduced without loss of the microcatheter position in the distal parent artery. A Pipeline Embolization Device could be delivered in both cases without any difficulty. There were no complications. The technique described results in ideal microcatheter alignment with a secure distal position before deployment of a flow-diverting stent.\n\n4D phase contrast flow imaging for in-stent flow visualization and assessment of stent patency in peripheral vascular stents--a phantom study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBunck, Alexander C; JÃ¼ttner, Alena; KrÃ¶ger, Jan Robert; Burg, Matthias C; Kugel, Harald; Niederstadt, Thomas; Tiemann, Klaus; Schnackenburg, Bernhard; Crelier, Gerard R; Heindel, Walter; Maintz, David\n\n2012-09-01\n\n4D phase contrast flow imaging is increasingly used to study the hemodynamics in various vascular territories and pathologies. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and validity of MRI based 4D phase contrast flow imaging for the evaluation of in-stent blood flow in 17 commonly used peripheral stents. 17 different peripheral stents were implanted into a MR compatible flow phantom. In-stent visibility, maximal velocity and flow visualization were assessed and estimates of in-stent patency obtained from 4D phase contrast flow data sets were compared to a conventional 3D contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) as well as 2D PC flow measurements. In all but 3 of the tested stents time-resolved 3D particle traces could be visualized inside the stent lumen. Quality of 4D flow visualization and CE-MRA images depended on stent type and stent orientation relative to the magnetic field. Compared to the visible lumen area determined by 3D CE-MRA, estimates of lumen patency derived from 4D flow measurements were significantly higher and less dependent on stent type. A higher number of stents could be assessed for in-stent patency by 4D phase contrast flow imaging (n=14) than by 2D phase contrast flow imaging (n=10). 4D phase contrast flow imaging in peripheral vascular stents is feasible and appears advantageous over conventional 3D contrast-enhanced MR angiography and 2D phase contrast flow imaging. It allows for in-stent flow visualization and flow quantification with varying quality depending on stent type. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The model allows to present the conception of first flush management using an improved flow diverter Septurn. Flow diverters used in the separate sewer systems create a hybrid system called \"semi-separate\" sewage system, which allows to treat the first flush volume in the waste water treatment plant (WWTP). Proposed construction of the flow diverter makes possible to capture significant part of the pollutant load (TSS) and simultaneously to reduce volume discharges to WWTPs during wet weather.\n\nNumerical Studies of a Supersonic Fluidic Diverter Actuator for Flow Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGokoglu, Suleyman A.; Kuczmarski, Maria A.; Culley, Dennis e.; Raghu, Surya\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe analysis of the internal flow structure and performance of a specific fluidic diverter actuator, previously studied by time-dependent numerical computations for subsonic flow, is extended to include operation with supersonic actuator exit velocities. The understanding will aid in the development of fluidic diverters with minimum pressure losses and advanced designs of flow control actuators. The self-induced oscillatory behavior of the flow is successfully predicted and the calculated oscillation frequencies with respect to flow rate have excellent agreement with our experimental measurements. The oscillation frequency increases with Mach number, but its dependence on flow rate changes from subsonic to transonic to supersonic regimes. The delay time for the initiation of oscillations depends on the flow rate and the acoustic speed in the gaseous medium for subsonic flow, but is unaffected by the flow rate for supersonic conditions\n\nRelationship between aneurysm occlusion and flow diverting device oversizing in a rabbit model.\n\nPubMed\n\nHodis, Simona; Ding, Yong-Hong; Dai, Daying; Lingineni, Ravi; Mut, Fernando; Cebral, Juan; Kallmes, David; Kadirvel, Ramanathan\n\n2016-01-01\n\nImplanted, actual flow diverter pore density is thought to be strongly influenced by proper matching between the device size and parent artery diameter. The objective of this study was to characterize the correlation between device sizing, metal coverage, and the resultant occlusion of aneurysms following flow diverter treatment in a rabbit model. Rabbit saccular aneurysms were treated with flow diverters (iso-sized to proximal parent artery, 0.5â mm oversized, or 1.0â mm oversized, respectively, n=6 for each group). Eight weeks after implantation, the angiographic degree of aneurysm occlusion was graded (complete, near-complete, or incomplete). The ostium of the explanted aneurysm covered with the flow diverter struts was photographed. Based on gross anatomic findings, the metal coverage and pore density at the ostium of the aneurysm were calculated and correlated with the degree of aneurysm occlusion. Angiographic results showed there were no statistically significant differences in aneurysm geometry and occlusion among groups. The mean parent artery diameter to flow diverter diameter ratio was higher in the 1.0â mm oversized group than in the other groups. Neither the percentage metal coverage nor the pore density showed statistically significant differences among groups. Aneurysm occlusion was inversely correlated with the ostium diameter, irrespective of the size of the device implanted. Device sizing alone does not predict resultant pore density or metal coverage following flow diverter implantation in the rabbit aneurysm model. Aneurysm occlusion was not impacted by either metal coverage or pore density, but was inversely correlated with the diameter of the ostium. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

However, they are associated with complications like late aneurysmal rupture. Additionally, flow diverters show focal structural decrease in luminal diameter without any intimal hyperplasia. This resembles a \"fish mouth\" when viewed en face. In this pilot study, we tested the hypothesis of a possible association between flow diverter fish-mouthing and delayed-type hypersensitivity to its metal constituents. We retrospectively reviewed patient records from our center between May 2010 and November 2015. A total of nine patients had flow diverter fish mouthing. A control group of 25 patients was selected. All study participants underwent prospective patch test to detect hypersensitivity to flow diverter metal constituents. Analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis and Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to test variables to predict flow diverter fish mouthing. The association between flow diverter fish mouthing and positive patch test was not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, history of allergy and maximum aneurysm size category was associated with flow diverter fish mouthing. This was further confirmed on Wilcoxon sign rank sum test. The study showed statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and history of contact allergy and a small aneurysmal size. Further large-scale studies are needed to detect a statistically significant association between flow diverter fish mouthing and patch test. We recommend early and more frequent follow-up imaging in patients with contact allergy to detect flow diverter fish mouthing and its subsequent evolution.\n\nNumerical Studies of a Fluidic Diverter for Flow Control\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGokoglu, Suleyman A.; Kuczmarski, Maria A.; Culley, Dennis E.; Raghu, Surya\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe internal flow structure in a specific fluidic diverter is studied over a range from low subsonic to sonic inlet conditions by a time-dependent numerical analysis. The understanding will aid in the development of fluidic diverters with minimum pressure losses and advanced designs of flow control actuators. The velocity, temperature and pressure fields are calculated for subsonic conditions and the self-induced oscillatory behavior of the flow is successfully predicted. The results of our numerical studies have excellent agreement with our experimental measurements of oscillation frequencies. The acoustic speed in the gaseous medium is determined to be a key factor for up to sonic conditions in governing the mechanism of initiating the oscillations as well as determining its frequency. The feasibility of employing plasma actuation with a minimal perturbation level is demonstrated in steady-state calculations to also produce oscillation frequencies of our own choosing instead of being dependent on the fixed-geometry fluidic device.\n\nCombined Effects of Flow Diverting Strategies and Parent Artery Curvature on Aneurysmal Hemodynamics: A CFD Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYu, Ying; Lv, Nan; Wang, Shengzhang; Karmonik, Christof; Liu, Jian-Min; Huang, Qinghai\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose Flow diverters (FD) are increasingly being considered for treating large or giant wide-neck aneurysms. Clinical outcome is highly variable and depends on the type of aneurysm, the flow diverting device and treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of different flow diverting strategies together with parent artery curvature variations on altering intra-aneurysmal hemodynamics. Methods Four ideal intracranial aneurysm models with different parent artery curvature were constructed. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the hemodynamics before and after applying five types of flow diverting strategies (single FD, single FD with 5% and 10% packing density of coils, two FDs with 25% and 50% overlapping rate) were performed. Changes in pressure, wall shear stress (WSS), relative residence time (RRT), inflow velocity and inflow volume rate were calculated and compared. Results Each flow diverting strategy resulted in enhancement of RRT and reduction of normalized mean WSS, inflow volume rate and inflow velocity in various levels. Among them, 50% overlapped FD induced most effective hemodynamic changes in RRT and inflow volume rate. The mean pressure only slightly decreased after treatment. Regardless of the kind of implantation of FD, the mean pressure, inflow volume rate and inflow velocity increased and the RRT decreased as the curvature of the parent artery increased. Conclusions Of all flow diverting strategies, overlapping FDs induced most favorable hemodynamic changes. Hemodynamics alterations post treatment were substantially influenced by parent artery curvature. Our results indicate the need of an individualized flow diverting strategy that is tailored for a specific aneurysm.

Case report A 68-year-old woman with serious complications of type II diabetes mellitus had malignant otitis externa on the right side. She was treated with combined antibiotic therapy and underwent mastoidectomy for mastoiditis. She presented at our hospital with acute hemorrhage from the right external auditory canal. The emergency computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed a multiobulated pseudoaneurysm at the petrous segment of the right internal carotid artery. The pseudoaneurysm was treated with a 5âÃâ40-mm Surpass flow diverter. Three months later, she developed a malignant external otitis on the left side. As the infection progressed, a left-sided mastoiditis, a brain abscess, and a pseudoaneurysm at the petrous segment of the left internal carotid artery developed. The pseudoaneurysm caused bleeding from the left ear, and was treated with a 5âÃâ50-mm Surpass flow diverter. No recurrent bleeding was observed. Four months later, a follow-up angiography showed complete occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm on the left side, but a residual aneurysm could be detected on the right side. One year after the first intervention, the follow-up CT and magnetic resonance angiography revealed the complete occlusion of the aneurysms bilaterally. Conclusion The use of a flow diverter appears to be an efficient and safe method to occlude carotid pseudoaneurysms even in an inflammatory milieu.\n\nComparison of Flow Characteristics of Novel Three-Dimensional Printed Ureteral Stents Versus Standard Ureteral Stents in a Porcine Model.\n\nPubMed\n\nDel Junco, Michael; Yoon, Renai; Okhunov, Zhamshid; Abedi, Garen; Hwang, Christina; Dolan, Benjamin; Landman, Jaime\n\n2015-09-01\n\nWe compared the flow characteristics of novel three-dimensional (3D) printed ureteral stents with four conventional double-pigtail stents in an ex vivo porcine model. In six ex vivo porcine urinary systems with kidneys and ureters intact, we deployed a 5F occlusion catheter in an interpolar calix. We tested each system with antegrade irrigation with a 0.9% saline bag placed 35âcm above the renal pelvis. We evaluated four standard stents (6F UniversaÂ® Soft, 7F Percuflex,â¢ 7/10F Applied Endopyelotomy, 8.5F Filiform Double Pigtail) and compared them with a 9F 3D printed prototype stent. For each stent, we measured the total, extraluminal, and intraluminal flow rates. The mean total flow rates for 3D printed stents were significantly higher than the 6F, 7F, and 7/10F stents (P<0.05). No significant difference was seen in the total flow rate for the 3D printed stent and the 8.5F stent. The mean extraluminal flow rates for the 3D stents were similar to those of 7F stents, but significantly lower than 6F stents (P<0.001) and 8.5F stents (P<0.05) and higher than 7/10F stents (P<0.001). The mean intraluminal flow rates for the 3D printed stents were significantly higher than the 6F, 7F, 7/10F, and 8.5F stents (P<0.05). In this pilot study, 3D printed stents manifested a mean total flow rate comparable to the flow rates of contemporary stents. Continued advances in technology and material may permit functionally feasible 3D printed ureteral stents.\n\nMorphologic and Clinical Outcome of Intracranial Aneurysms after Treatment Using Flow Diverter Devices: Mid-Term Follow-Up\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBreu, Anna-Katharina; Hauser, Till-Karsten; Ebner, Florian H.; Bischof, Felix; Ernemann, Ulrike; Seeger, Achim\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFlow diverters (FDs) are designed for the endovascular treatment of complex intracranial aneurysm configurations. From February 2009 to March 2013 28 patients (22 females, 6 males) were treated with FD; mean age was 57 years. Data, including aneurysm features, clinical presentation, history of previous bleeding, treatment, and follow-up results, are presented. Early postinterventional neurological deficits (transient: n = 3/enduring: n = 1) appeared in 4/28 patients (14%), and early improvement of neurological symptoms was observed in 7 patients with previous restriction of cranial nerve function. The overall occlusion rate was 20/26 (77%; 59% after 3 months). 77% achieved best results according to O'Kelly-Marotta score grade D with no contrast material filling (70% of those after 3 months). In 4/6 patients who did not achieve grade D, proximal and/or distal stent overlapping â¥5âmm was not guaranteed sufficiently. During follow-up we did not detect any aneurysm recurrence or haemorrhage. In-stent stenosis emerged as the most frequent complication (4/27; 15%) followed by 2 cases of vascular obliteration (AICA/VA). In conclusion endovascular reconstruction using a FD represents a modern and effective treatment in those aneurysms that are not suitable for conventional interventional or surgical treatment. The appearance of severe complications was rare.

The aim of the present project was to design a safe, fast, and standardized surgical technique for stent assisted embolization of saccular aneurysms in a rat animal model. Saccular aneurysms were created from an arterial graft from the descending aorta.The aneurysms were microsurgically transplanted through end-to-side anastomosis to the infrarenal abdominal aorta of a syngenic male Wistar rat weighing >500 g. Following aneurysm anastomosis, aneurysm embolization was performed using balloon expandable magnesium stents (2.5 mm x 6 mm). The stent system was retrograde introduced from the lower abdominal aorta using a modified Seldinger technique. Following a pilot series of 6 animals, a total of 67 rats were operated according to established standard operating procedures. Mean surgery time, mean anastomosis time, and mean suturing time of the artery puncture site were 167 Â± 22 min, 26 Â± 6 min and 11 Â± 5 min, respectively. The mortality rate was 6% (n=4). The morbidity rate was 7.5% (n=5), and in-stent thrombosis was found in 4 cases (n=2 early, n=2 late in stent thrombosis). The results demonstrate the feasibility of standardized stent occlusion of saccular sidewall aneurysms in rats - with low rates of morbidity and mortality. This stent embolization procedure combines the opportunity to study novel concepts of stent or flow diverter based devices as well as the molecular aspects of healing.\n\nBlood flow in intracranial aneurysms treated with Pipeline embolization devices: computational simulation and verification with Doppler ultrasonography on phantom models\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPurpose: The aim of this study was to validate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of flow-diverter treatment through Doppler ultrasonography measurements in patient-specific models of intracranial bifurcation and side-wall aneurysms. Methods: Computational and physical models of patient-specific bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms were constructed from computed tomography angiography with use of stereolithography, a three-dimensional printing technology. Flow dynamics parameters before and after flow-diverter treatment were measured with pulse-wave and color Doppler ultrasonography, and then compared with CFD simulations. Results: CFD simulations showed drastic flow reduction after flow-diverter treatment in both aneurysms. The mean volume flow rate decreased by 90% and 85% for the bifurcation aneurysm and the side-wall aneurysm, respectively. Velocity contour plots from computer simulations before and after flow diversion closely resembled the patterns obtained by color Doppler ultrasonography. Conclusion: The CFD estimation of flow reduction in aneurysms treated with a flow-diverting stent was verified by Doppler ultrasonography in patient-specific phantom models of bifurcation and side-wall aneurysms. The combination of CFD and ultrasonography may constitute a feasible and reliable technique in studying the treatment of intracranial aneurysms with flow-diverting stents.

In sidewall IA models with straight parent artery, two main hemodynamic regimes with different flow patterns and IA flow magnitude were broadly observed for unstented and high porosity stented IA on one side, and low porosity stented IA on the other side. The hemodynamic transition between these two regimes is potentially involved in thrombosis formation. In the present study, CFD simulations and multi-time lag (MTL) particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) measurements were combined to investigate the physical nature of this transition. Measurable velocity fields and non-measurable shear stress and pressure fields were assessed experimentally and numerically in the aneurysm volume in the presence of stents with various porosities. The two main regimes observed in both PIV and CFD showed typical flow features of shear and pressure driven regimes. In particular, the waveform of the averaged IA velocities was matching both the shear stress waveform at IA neck or the pressure gradient waveform in parent artery. Moreover, the transition between the two regimes was controlled by stent porosity: a decrease of stent porosity leads to an increase (decrease) of pressure differential (shear stress) through IA neck. Finally, a good PIV-CFD agreement was found except in transitional regimes and low motion eddies due to small mismatch of PIV-CFD running conditions. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The basic device, with one input and two output channels, takes advantage of the Coanda effect to force a fluid jet to adhere to one of two axi-symmetric surfaces. The resultant flow is bi-stable, producing a constant flow from one output channel, until a disturbance force applied at the control point causes the flow to switch to the alternate output channel. By properly applying active control the output flows can be manipulated to provide a high degree of modulation over a wide and variable range of frequency and duty cycle. In this study the momentary operative force is applied by small, high speed isolation valves of which several different types are examined. The active fluidic diverter actuator is shown to work in several configurations including that in which the operator valves are referenced to atmosphere as well as to a source common with the power stream.\n\nBenchmark for Numerical Models of Stented Coronary Bifurcation Flow.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarcÃ­a Carrascal, P; GarcÃ­a GarcÃ­a, J; Sierra Pallares, J; Castro Ruiz, F; Manuel MartÃ­n, F J\n\n2018-09-01\n\nIn-stent restenosis ails many patients who have undergone stenting. When the stented artery is a bifurcation, the intervention is particularly critical because of the complex stent geometry involved in these structures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been shown to be an effective approach when modeling blood flow behavior and understanding the mechanisms that underlie in-stent restenosis. However, these CFD models require validation through experimental data in order to be reliable. It is with this purpose in mind that we performed particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements of velocity fields within flows through a simplified coronary bifurcation. Although the flow in this simplified bifurcation differs from the actual blood flow, it emulates the main fluid dynamic mechanisms found in hemodynamic flow. Experimental measurements were performed for several stenting techniques in both steady and unsteady flow conditions. The test conditions were strictly controlled, and uncertainty was accurately predicted. The results obtained in this research represent readily accessible, easy to emulate, detailed velocity fields and geometry, and they have been successfully used to validate our numerical model. These data can be used as a benchmark for further development of numerical CFD modeling in terms of comparison of the main flow pattern characteristics.\n\nPerformance characteristics of plane-wall venturi-like reverse flow diverters\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmith, G.V.; Counce, R.M.\n\n1984-02-01\n\nThe results of an analytical and experimental study of plane-wall venturi-like reverse flow diverters (RFD) are presented. In general, the flow characteristics of the RFD are reasonably well predicted by the mathematical model of the RFD, although a divergence between theory and data is observed for the output characteristics in the reverse flow mode as the output impedance is reduced. Overall, the performance of these devices indicates their usefulness in fluid control and fluid power systems, such as displacement pumping systems.\n\nPerformance characteristics of plane-wall venturi-like reverse flow diverters\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSmith, G.V.; Counce, R.M.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nThe results of an analytical and experimental study of plane-wall venturi-like reverse flow diverters (RFD) are presented.

Many researchers reported that the growth of stenosis is significantly related to the geometry of stent strut configuration. The different shapes of stent geometry are presenting the different flow pattern and re-circulation in stented femoropopliteal artery. The blood flow characteristics near to the stent geometry are predicted for the possibility of thrombosis and atherosclerosis to be formed as well as increase the growth of stenosis. Thus, this study aims to determine the flow characteristic near to stent strut configuration based on different hemodynamic parameters. Three dimensional models of stent and simplified femoropopliteal artery are modelled using computer aided design (CAD) software. Three different models of stent shapes; hexagon, circle and rectangle are simulated using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. Then, parametric study is implemented to predict the performance of stent due to hemodynamic differences. The hemodynamic parameters considered are pressure, velocity, low wall shear stress (WSSlow) and wall shear stress (WSS). From the observation, flow re-circulation has been formed for all simulated stent models which the proximal region shown the severe vortices. However, rectangular shape of stent strut (Type P3) shows the lowest WSSlow and the highest WSS between the range of 4 dyne/cm2 and 70 dyne/cm2. Stent Type P3 also shows the best hemodynamic stent performance as compare to others. In conclusion, Type P3 has a favourable result in hemodynamic stent performance that predicted less probability of thrombosis and atherosclerosis to be formed as well as reduces the growth of restenosis.\n\nStudy of an engine flow diverter system for a large scale ejector powered aircraft model\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSpringer, R.

Complete system performance was calculated and a versatile computer program capable of analyzing any ejector system was developed.\n\nPhysiologically-relevant measurements of flow through coils and stents: towards improved modeling of endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarbour, Michael; Levitt, Michael; Geindreau, Christian; Rolland Du Roscoat, Sabine; Johnson, Luke; Chivukula, Keshav; Aliseda, Alberto\n\n2016-11-01\n\nThe hemodynamic environment in cerebral aneurysms undergoing flow-diverting stent (FDS) or coil embolization treatment plays a critical role in long-term outcomes. Standard modeling approaches to endovascular coils and FDS simplify the complex geometry into a homogenous porous volume or surface through the addition of a Darcy-Brinkman pressure loss term in the momentum equation. The inertial and viscous loss coefficients are typically derived from published in vitro studies of pressure loss across FDS and coils placed in a straight tube, where the only fluid path is across the treatment - an unrealistic representation of treatment apposition in vivo. The pressure drop across FDS and coils in side branch aneurysms located on curved parent vessels is measured. Using PIV, the velocity at the aneurysm neck plane is reconstructed and used to determine loss coefficients for better models of endovascular coils or FDS that account for physiological placement and vessel curvature. These improved models are incorporated into CFD simulations and validated against in vitro model PIV velocity, as well as compared to microCT-based coil/stent-resolving CFD simulations of patient-specific treated aneurysm flow.\n\nFlow diversion in the treatment of carotid injury and carotid-cavernous fistula after transsphenoidal surgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLum, Cheemum; Ahmed, Muhammad E; Glikstein, Rafael; dos Santos, Marlise P; Lesiuk, Howard; Labib, Mohamed; Kassam, Amin B\n\n2015-01-01\n\nWe describe a case of iatrogenic carotid injury with secondary carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) treated with a silk flow diverter stent placed within the injured internal carotid artery and coils placed within the cavernous sinus. Flow diverters may offer a simple and potentially safe vessel-sparing option in this rare complication of transsphenoidal surgery. The management options are discussed and the relevant literature is reviewed.

Experiments revealed that fluid hydrodynamics, fluid flow velocity and shear stress play essential roles in the corrosion behavior of absorbable magnesium-based stent devices. Flow-induced shear stress (FISS) accelerates the overall corrosion (including localized, uniform, pitting and erosion corrosions) due to the increased mass transfer and mechanical force. FISS increased the average uniform corrosion rate, the localized corrosion coverage ratios and depths and the removal rate of corrosion products inside the corrosion pits. For MgZnCa plates, an increase of FISS results in an increased pitting factor but saturates at an FISS of â¼0.15Pa. For AZ31 stents, the volume loss ratio (31%) at 0.056Pa was nearly twice that (17%) at 0Pa before and after corrosion. Flow direction has a significant impact on corrosion behavior as more severe pitting and erosion corrosion was observed on the back ends of the MgZnCa plates, and the corrosion product layer facing the flow direction peeled off from the AZ31 stent struts. This study demonstrates that flow-induced corrosion needs be understood so that Mg-based stents in vascular environments can be effectively designed. Copyright Â© 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Despite good clinical success of FDs, complications like incomplete occlusion and post-treatment rupture leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage have been reported. In silico computational fluid dynamic analysis of the pre- and post-treated geometries of IA patients can shed light on the contrasting blood hemodynamics associated with different clinical outcomes. In this study, we analyzed hemodynamic modifications in 15 IA patients treated using a single FD; 10 IAs were completely occluded (successful) and 5 were partially occluded (unsuccessful) at 12-month follow-up. An in-house virtual stenting workflow was used to recapitulate the clinical intervention on these cases, followed by CFD to obtain pre- and post-treatment hemodynamics. Bulk hemodynamic parameters showed comparable reductions in both groups with average inflow rate and aneurysmal velocity reduction of 40.3% and 52.4% in successful cases, and 34.4% and 49.2% in unsuccessful cases. There was a substantial reduction in localized parameter like vortex coreline length and Energy Loss for successful cases, 38.2% and 42.9% compared to 10.1% and 10.5% for unsuccessful cases. This suggest that for successfully treated IAs, the localized complex blood flow is disrupted more prominently by the FD as compared to unsuccessful cases. These localized hemodynamic parameters can be potentially used in prediction of treatment outcome, thus aiding the clinicians in a priori assessment of different treatment strategies.\n\nAssociation between hemodynamic modifications and clinical outcome of intracranial aneurysms treated using flow diverters.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaliwal, Nikhil; Damiano, Robert J; Davies, Jason M; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Meng, Hui\n\n2017-02-11\n\nTreatment of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) has been revolutionized by the advent of endovascular Flow Diverters (FDs), which disrupt blood flow within the aneurysm to induce pro-thrombotic conditions, and serves as a scaffold for endothelial ingrowth and arterial remodeling.

This article reports the long-term results (2-4 years) of this treatment from a single-center. From November 2008 to January 2012, 35 patients (29 females and 6 males; mean age 53.9 y) with 39 intracranial aneurysms were treated by FDD. Five patients (14.3%) had ruptured aneurysms and 30 (85.7%) had no previous hemorrhage. The procedures were performed in 5 patients (14.3%) with SILK and in 30 (85.7%) with PED. In 3 patients FDDs were used as a second treatment after failure of previous coiling (2 cases) or stenting (one case). The 39 aneurysms were in supraclinoid ICA in 26 (66.7%), cavernous ICA in 2 (5.1%), PCoA in 4 (10.2%), MCA in 5 (12.9%), SCA in 1 (2.6%) and PICA in 1 (2.6%). The aneurysms were small (<10mm) in 32 cases (82%), large (11-25mm) in 6 (15.3%) and giant in 1 (2.6%). The occlusion rate according to the aneurysm location, size and neck and the complications were evaluated. Peri-procedural complications included transient dysarthria (2 patients), vasospasm with acute intra-stent aggregation (one), microwire rupture (one) and failure of the stent opening (one). The follow-up was made between 24 and 62 months (mean 41 months); clinical examination and CTA were performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure. The complete occlusion was confirmed by CTA and DSA. MRI with angiographic-studies was taken every year. Complete occlusion was obtained in 35 aneurysms (92.1%) and subtotal in 3 (7.9%). Complete occlusion occurred at 3 months in 24 cases (68.6%), within 3 and 6 months in 9 (25.7%). The rate and time of complete occlusion were not correlated with the aneurysm size. MCA aneurysms mainly showed partial occlusion (2/3 cases). Besides, large-neck aneurysms and those with a vessel arising from the sac mainly showed late (>6 months) or partial occlusion. FDD are a safe and efficacious treatment of intracranial aneurysms, resulting in\n\nEvaluation of hydrocarbon flow standard facility equipped with double-wing diverter using four types of working liquids\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDoihara, R.; Shimada, T.; Cheong, K. H.; Terao, Y.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA flow calibration facility based on the gravimetric method using a double-wing diverter for hydrocarbon flows from 0.1 m3 h-1 to 15 m3 h-1 was constructed as a national measurement standard in Japan. The original working liquids were kerosene and light oil. The calibration facility was modified to calibrate flowmeters with two additional working liquids, industrial gasoline (flash pointââ>ââ40 Â°C) and spindle oil, to achieve calibration over a wide viscosity range at the same calibration test rig. The kinematic viscosity range is 1.2âmm2 s-1 to 24âmm2 s-1. The contributions to the measurement uncertainty due to different types of working liquids were evaluated experimentally in this study. The evaporation error was reduced by using a seal system at the weighing tank inlet. The uncertainty due to droplets from the diverter wings was reduced by a modified diverter operation. The diverter timing errors for all types of working liquids were estimated. The expanded uncertainties for the calibration facility were estimated to be 0.020% for mass flow and 0.030% for volumetric flow for all considered types of liquids. Internal comparisons with other calibration facilities were also conducted, and the agreement was confirmed to be within the claimed expanded uncertainties.\n\nFlow-Diverting Devices versus Coil Embolization for Intracranial Aneurysms: AÂ Systematic Literature Review and Meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Geng; Zhu, Yue-Qi; Su, Ming; Gao, Kai-Di; Li, Ming-Hua\n\n2016-04-01\n\nTo review the literature on flow-diverting device (FDD) treatments for intracranial aneurysms (IAs) and to compare the safety and efficacy of FDDs with coil embolization treatment (CET) for IAs using a meta-analysis of published studies. A systematic electronic search was conducted of PubMed, Springer Link, EBSCO, and the Cochrane Database on all accessible published articles through September 2015. Abstracts, full-text manuscripts, and the reference lists of retrieved articles were analyzed. Studies that explicitly compared FDD and CET approaches to the treatment of IAs were included. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated for the complete occlusion rate and the morbidity rate using a random-effects model. Nine studies were included in the analysis, containing retrospectively collected data for 863 patients. FDD treatment showed a significantly higher complete occlusion rate than CET (ORÂ = 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.11-4.65) and the subgroup of stent-assisted coiling did (ORÂ = 2.08; 95% CI, 1.34-3.24). FDDs did not achieve a significantly lower overall morbidity rate compared with CET (ORÂ = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.45-1.69) or the SAC (stent-assisted coiling) subgroup (ORÂ = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.33-2.26), and our results did not show a significant difference in mortality between the two techniques. FDD treatment of IAs yielded satisfactory results in complete occlusion rate compared with CET. The FDD procedure is feasible and has no significant difference in morbidity risk. Despite the findings reported herein, further validation with well-designed, multicenter randomized controlled trials is needed. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This exploratory study aims at a proof of concept for an advanced device-modeling tool in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate flow modification effects by PED in real treatment cases. Methods We performed computational modeling of three PED-treated complex aneurysm cases. Case I had a fusiform vertebral aneurysm treated with a single PED. Case II had a giant internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm treated with 2 PEDs. Case III consisted of two tandem ICA aneurysms (a and b) treated by a single PED. Our recently developed high fidelity virtual stenting (HiFiVS) technique was used to recapitulate the clinical deployment process of PEDs in silico for these three cases. Pre- and post-treatment aneurysmal hemodynamics using CFD simulation was analyzed. Changes in aneurysmal flow velocity, inflow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS) (quantifying flow reduction) and turnover time (quantifying stasis) were calculated and compared with clinical outcome. Results In Case I (occluded within the first 3 months), the aneurysm experienced the most drastic aneurysmal flow reduction after PED placement, where the aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate and average WSS was decreased by 76.3%, 82.5% and 74.0%, respectively, while the turnover time was increased to 572.1% of its pre-treatment value. In Case II (occluded at 6 months), aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate and average WSS were decreased by 39.4%, 38.6%, and 59.1%, respectively, and turnover time increased to 163.0%. In Case III, Aneurysm III-a (occluded at 6 months) experienced decrease by 38.0%, 28.4%, and 50.9% in aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate and average WSS, respectively and increase to 139.6% in turnover time, which was quite similar to Aneurysm II. Surprisingly, the adjacent Aneurysm III-b experienced more substantial flow\n\nExperimental study of laminar blood flow through an artery treated by a stent implantation: characterisation of intra-stent wall shear stress.\n\nPubMed\n\nBenard, Nicolas; Coisne, Damien; Donal, Erwan; Perrault, Robert\n\n2003-07-01\n\nThe stimulation of endothelial cells by arterial wall shear stress (WSS) plays a central role in restenosis. The fluid-structure interaction between stent wire and blood flow alters the WSS, particularly between stent struts. We have designed an in vitro model of struts of an intra-vascular prosthesis to study blood flow through a 'stented' section. The experimental artery consisted of a transparent square section test vein, which reproduced the strut design (100x magnifying power). A programmable pump was used to maintain a steady blood flow. Particle image velocimetry method was used to measure the flow between and over the stent branches, and to quantify WSS. Several prosthesis patterns that were representative of the total stent strut geometry were studied in a greater detail. We obtained WSS values of between -1.5 and 1.5Pa in a weak SS area which provided a source of endothelial stimulation propitious to restenosis. We also compared two similar patterns located in two different flow areas (one at the entry of the stent and one further downstream). We only detected a slight difference between the weakest SS levels at these two sites. As the endothelial proliferation is greatly influenced by the SS, knowledge of the SS modification induced by the stent implantation could be of importance for intra-vascular prostheses design optimisation and thus can help to reduce the restenosis incidence rate.\n\nChanges in blood flow due to stented parent artery expansion in an intracranial aneurysm.\n\nPubMed\n\nMori, Futoshi; Ohta, Makot"
