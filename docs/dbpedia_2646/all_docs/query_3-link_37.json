        "text": "On-Screen Characters Of Shahid Kapoor Which You Will Never Forget\n\nShahid Kapoor's journey from being the chocolate boy of the Indian film industry to becoming an actor recognised for portraying a variety of roles is paved with a number of characters played by him. He started out his journey as a background dancer in the 90s. With his hard work and dedication he climbed the ladder of success and became the most sought-after actor in Bollywood.\n\nAlthough he's known for portraying romantic roles, he is a versatile actor. From playing sweet and charming Prem in Vivah to self-destructive and high-functioning alcoholic Kabir, he has come a long way.\n\nHere are some on-screen characters of Shahid Kapoor which you will never forget.\n\nRajiv Mathur, Ishq Vishq:\n\nA college student, who wants to be popular and is bullied due to his lack of a girlfriend. Shahid Kapoor made his debut in Bollywood with Ishq Vishq. It became a blockbuster hit as the story was a coming-of-age romance drama. His cute looks and sweet smile got him a massive amount of fans with his debut. His acting skills and hard work also got him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.\n\nPrem, Vivah:\n\nThis family drama was yet another successful collaboration of Shahid Kapoor with Amrita Rao. He portrayed the character of the youngest of a rich businessman, whose marriage is arranged by his father. He falls in love with Poonam as soon as he sees her picture. It was one of the most successful films of his career.\n\nJeet/ Jabba, Chup Chup Ke:\n\nShahid Kapoor played the role of a deaf and dumb man, Jeet, saved by a fisherman when he intends to drown himself to escape his mountain of debt. The humour and perfectly timed comic scenes had the audience doubled over with laughter. He was cast alongside Kareena Kapoor for the third time. She also portrayed the character of a deaf and dumb girl, Shruti, who falls in love with Jeet.\n\nAditya, Jab We Met:\n\nDirected by Imtiaz Ali, Jab We Met was a romcom. Shahid's character Aditya is a depressed businessman, who bumps into a fiesty Punjabi girl Geet (Kareena Kapoor), on a train journey. She is on her way to her home and misses the train trying to get Aditya on the train. They both travel together to Punjab. They end up falling for each other. Their chemistry was appreciated by the viewers and the movie was a hit.\n\nCharlie & Guddu, Kaminey:\n\nPaired with Priyanka Chopra, Shahid Kapoor played a double role in this movie. Charlie and Guddu were twins raised in Mumbai. Their dreams were as big as the city, which leads them into trouble. One being a target of a politician while the other being chased by corrupt police officers. Besides his good looks and perfectly carved body, Shahid Kapoor has a lot to offer as an actor and the movie was one such example.\n\nRomeo Rajkumar, R. Rajkumar:\n\nWritten and directed by Prabhu Deva, R. Rajkumar was an action romance movie. Shahid Kapoor's character was not of a cute, caring lover, instead he was a goon. He was paired with Sonakshi Sinha who played the role of Chanda, Rajkumar's love interest. With a lot of action and romance, the movie was a hit.\n\nHaider, Haider:\n\nIt was the third installment in Vishal Bhardwaj's Shakespearean trilogy. It was an adaptation of Hamlet, and was set amidst the Kashmir conflicts of 1995. Shahid gave a lot of dedication and hardwork to fulfill his role as Haider. It sure was challenging but it earned him praise from around the world. It received several awards including, People's Choice Award at the Rome Film Festival.\n\nTommy Singh aka Gabru, Udta Punjab:\n\nShahid Kapoor played the role of a rockstar who often glorifies drug abuse in his songs. His actions land him in jail where he meets his fans, who murdered their mother for drug money. This incident made him realise the negative impact of his songs. Though the role was a challenging one, Shahid Kapoor succeeded in playing it well.\n\nMaharaval Ratan Singh, Padmaavat:\n\nBased on the poem of the same name by Malik Muhammad Jayasi, it was a period romantic drama. Even though the movie was followed by controversies, Shahid Kapoor's role was a phenomenal one. Even in the supporting role his skills proved once again why he's one of the best actors in the industry.\n\nKabir, Kabir Singh:\n\nKabir is a surgeon who spirals into self destruction and alcohol and drug abuse, because his girlfriend is married to someone else. His character is that of a man who finds it difficult to get over his ex, and is full of toxic behaviour. Paired with Kiara Advani, Shahid did an amazing job in playing his role. The movie was a remake of Telugu film, Arjun Reddy.\n\nEven though our list ends here, there is no end to the skills and charm of Shahid Kapoor."
