        "text": "In a recent interview with iDream Media, Sandeep Reddy Vanga, the acclaimed director behind the blockbuster film Arjun Reddy, shared insights into the casting challenges he faced while remaking the film in Hindi as Kabir Singh. The film, starring Shahid Kapoor in the lead role, went on to become a massive success at the box office. However, Sandeep revealed that the journey to finalizing the cast was not without its hurdles.\n\nThe director disclosed that early on in the casting process, there were reservations about selecting Shahid Kapoor for the role of Kabir Singh. Critics pointed to Kapoor’s track record, citing that none of his solo films had surpassed the $12 million (Rs 100 crore) mark at that time, with his highest grosser being $7.8 million (Rs 65 crore). Some skeptics questioned the decision, suggesting that choosing a more established actor, like Ranveer Singh, could potentially yield higher box office returns. However, Sandeep Reddy Vanga remained steadfast in his belief in Shahid Kapoor’s acting prowess.\n\nAnimal movie director Sandeep Reddy Vanga was told Shahid’s track record was a concern\n\n“Shahid’s track record was a concern; none of his solo films had done Rs 100 crore then, his highest was Rs 65 crore. They used to say Rs 55 crore, Rs 65 crore is the kind of business Telugu movies do. ‘Why are you doing it with this guy? If it was Ranveer, the box office would be higher’. But I was always sure about Shahid, he’s a fantastic actor,” Sandeep explained in the interview.\n\nInterestingly, Sandeep Reddy Vanga also revealed that Ranveer Singh was initially approached for the role of Kabir Singh. However, Ranveer declined the offer. He expressed that he found the character’s dark nuances too challenging for him at that particular time.\n\nOn the professional front, Sandeep is gearing up for the release of his upcoming movie Animal. Animal marks his first collaboration with Ranbir Kapoor. The film, also features Rashmika Mandanna, Anil Kapoor, and Bobby Deol. It explores the intricate dynamics of a father-son relationship portrayed by Anil and Ranbir."
