Without the support of Time Warner Cable & State Bank of India, it would be impossible to keep this event FREE ADMISSION !\n\nI Love Free Concerts has teamed up with NYC Bhangra to bring you Holi NYC 2013: Festival of Colors. The 4th annual celebration of Holi ( Holi Hai! 2013 ), a festival of colors and spring, brings dance, music and culture in the way many South Asians celebrate SPRING !\n\nJoin us on a beautiful and joyful spring day as we celebrate the beauty of life with our friends and beloved brothers and sisters around the world.\n\nPlease go here for more information: http://bit.ly/ZFiPFy\n\nThe Holi Festival takes its name from an evil witch who lived thousands of years ago. Her name was Holika. She had a boon not be burned even if she stepped into fire. She misused this benediction to burn many babies by carrying them into fires. However, when she tried to do the same to a five year old Krishna devotee named Prahlad, she got burned instead, while Prahlad emerged from the fire unharmed. Prahlad’s constant habit was to chant the names of God, Hare Krishna Hare Krshna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare / Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare. Thus taking shelter of the Lord through His Holy Names the Supreme protected him.\n\nSign up for updates for the Holi Newsletter: http://holinyc.com/\n\nYou can also visit NYC Bhangra Event Page: http://on.fb.me/Ud4zDS\n\nMore information on NYC Bhangra: http://bit.ly/VSsiJ5\n\nPlease invite your friends to this amazing event on Facebook, and also visit http://ilovefreeconcerts.com/holi/\n\nWe look forward to seeing you at this marvelous and beautiful event.\n\nRahul Bose certainly knows how to broaden his female fan-base uttering just a few words.\n\nRahul Bose ‏ @RahulBose1\n\nIt’s really quite simple. O2 in, CO2 out.\n\nand another tweet that reads:\n\nPlease read ALL my tweets before jumping down my throat again! There are 10 of them. 11, w/this one. On a flight, so back in 3hrs. Cheers.\n\nCheerful as that sounds, he might be just on the verge of turning into the Indian equivalent of Mel Gibson and he should be perhaps the one to start with breathing exercises.\n\nBut thankfully India is more forgiving than America with people who step into a hornet’s nest. What he is talking about is the reaction to his proposal to rehabilitate rapists in India and transform them into “gender warriors” – whatever that means. A day later a holy storm unleashes on him in form of a twitter war.The poor guy all he wanted is help us women…. how could his effort backfire in this manner?\n\nIt just happens so that India has been rattled by most brutal gang rapes, every day now it seems new ones are being reported. It has women, mothers, fathers, daughters on edge.\n\nThe reaction wouldn’t be so strong if India’s justice system hadn’t been so lenient in dealing with rapists for as long as we can remember…What’s needed right now is harsher sentencing, follow-through. Women who come forward should be treated sensitively, instead being blamed for provoking what happened to them. Until now it seems victims were being accused, like “she had it coming, the way she dresses” But the last horrendous incident in Delhi last November, has turned a page after people took in drones to the street calling for justice.\n\nWe know Rahul Bose deep down has his heart in the right place, but this is a very delicate matter. And his message might have been misconstrued and ill-received because the times right now call for action, for stricter punishments. Also, it’s coming from a man. The politically correct thing to do for a man is to reaffirm the need of acknowledgment and punishment for rape, not so much forgiveness.\n\nBesides, people extract from carpet statements the one or two ideas that emerge and are recognizable, sticking out like a sour thumb. Forgiveness and rehabilitation. Forgiveness HAS BEEN ALWAYS THERE, UNFORTUNATELY. That’s the problem. Part of the problem.\n\nIt’s a little bit like a white dude saying “I don’t understand. **Ni**er** is not a bad word, I hear black folks saying it all the time” and you want to grab him and tell him “It comes with a whole painful history attached to it!”\n\nIt’s the same as Rahul Bose telling us to show compassion to sorry-ass rapists and love conquers all. It’s the way to a better society.\n\nHe is living in dreamland. First of all, what about faking of being sorry? What about required long-term therapy and follow-ups? who’s going to pay for that.. how will you deliver those services? What about recidivism? are there any studies about the likelihood of repeat sex offenders in India? especially in a lenient system that prefers to hush dirty little secrets under the table…. it’s not as easy as handing out little cornflowers and preaching about the benefits of lovemaking vs rape. And please, shift the focus of your sermon to the victims and deliver services to them that make THEM heal from their psychological and physical wounds. Rapists should know: no mercy will be bestowed on you! That’s the only message that will bring change!\n\nread more:\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Rahul-Bose-wont-apologise-for-his-reform-comments/articleshow/18880438.cms\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/filmi-parties/bollywood/Ring-The-Bell-social-media-storm-in-Delhi/articleshow/18880551.cms?\n\nThis movie never made it to my shores. An interesting and multilayered film dealing with sexual harassment at the workplace. But if you think you learn something, then let’s cut to the chase. Don’t sleep with your boss. EVER. Under no circumstances. We know from experience how messy that can get. Case in point: Inkaar\n\nA panel of investigators is summoned to determine if a sexual harassment suit filed by the creative director of an ad agency, Maya (Chitrangda Singh) against a CEO, Rahul (Arjun Rampal) has any merit and a solution can be found internally without creating too many waves. The questioning takes place over three days and we viewers feel just as exhausted at the end of this film as the members of the panel. But then comes the film’s climax and we realize our sufferings were in vain.The two feuding parties were just trying to figure out how they feel about each other. Duh!\n\nSo what started out as a really interesting premise of He Said She Said, the whole muddiness of office romance, game of ambition, blame and accusation had me in its grip. Usually sexual harassment is about one willing and one unwilling party, but in this case there was mutual attraction and boundaries were crossed consensually An ambitious young attractive employee finds a mentor in her boss and climbs up the ladder.\n\nTo illustrate how young and dumb she was in the beginning of her odyssey we see Maya adorned with unattractive body piercings until she morphs into a sophisticated dame in accordance with her new position. of creative director, which turns her into a mean and patronizing boss who fires old tested employees at will. Maya never appears as a victim and never gets our full sympathy. except of course we ask ourselves, in order to climb the ladder in a company on the fast track, do we need to sleep our way up? and that’s a concern of many women. It’s legit. We see it happen all the time. Maya does and gets somewhere fast. She has a good mind and everyday situations are converted into creative ideas that benefit the agency. So even if she hadn’t slept with her boss and mentor, she would have probably climbed up pretty fast. We understand his well-controlled rage and anger when she is being promoted and encroaches now on HIS territory.\n\nWe see their relationship play out in their reciprocal flashbacks. And our sympathies may switch from one to another as we can understand their viewpoints..\n\nI was happy to see Chitrangda Singh, who had so impressed me in Desi Boyz. She is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful actresses in Bollywood these days. She exudes elegance and sophistication. Somehow she reminds me of Zeta-Jones.. What I loved about her in this role is, that she remained enigmatic to the end. A superbly nuanced performance.\n\nThis was a fantastic role for Arjun Rampal, too. I could too fall in love him and hate him and admire him, just as Maya. This emotional roller-coaster kept me glued to the story.The tension was building up, but helas, it collapsed like an undercooked souffle which you have pulled out of the oven with great anticipation and then see it sadly deflate.\n\nI wish I could re-write some of Bollywood’s endings. They oftentimes feel rushed, clumsily put together and reverse the positive feelings you built up during the movie. No exception here. They should have brainstormed the ending maybe via a focus group. The climax and resolution was the weakest part. So weak indeed that I felt that I had wasted two hours of my time. Still, the characters resonated with me and I therefore I would recommend watching it to my friends, warning them ahead of time about a weak ending.\n\n***\n\nHe’s never looked hotter and never played a more despicable character. Or that at least is what I think as a woman. Parents of eligible daughters, meet your nightmare. Well, the girl will never get to meet the parents and that’s how the movie starts. Haven’t we met them before, the commitment-phobic?\n\nThis is a bittersweet movie about a flailing relationship that doesn’t go anywhere, mainly because our protagonist, music producer with a golden touch, Ishaan (John Abraham) is a self-centered and self-destructive SOB, the center and blackhole of his own universe.\n\nHis girlfriend Anushka (the beautiful Chitrangada Singh from Desi Boyz and Inkaar) a successful professional in her own rights, has had it with him, his empty promises, his hedonistic life-style. He doesn’t know it, but there is an ultimatum in the air. She gets dressed up to meet his parents, he forgets all about it partying and drinking after-hours.\n\nAnushka means business and for her a no is a no and shuts him out of her life, figuratively and literally. Even though the movie applauds the manifesto of “hey, I don’t need you. I can figure it out on my own,” none of the female characters is flawless or very likeable. Each character is actually pretty lonely and struggles with their own demons and their own narcissistic tendencies. I couldn’t warm up to any and yet, could relate to their strengths and their weaknesses, their humanity. Often we don’t mean to be hurtful and just don’t think things through, the ramifications of our behavior.\n\nAfter being fed to the dogs, Ishaan seems to find new love and outlook on life when he gets to know more intimately his new neighbor, Gauri, played by Prachi Desai. But even this relationship is flawed. In his professional life, Ishaan doesn’t score much better. His boss is a woman with her own S&M fantasies (slightly wardrobe challenged Raima Sen). We can’t even celebrate her higher salary and position because she is not much nicer than Ishaan and seems just vindictive.\n\nAnd then there is still Ishaan’s overpowering and overindulging mother, who clearly favored her son over her daughter from the getgo. since he was the younger of the siblings, did she feel the need to protect him or is it that she favored in good old tradition the male progeny?\n\nWe know little about the sister other than she sides with Anushka, not her brother, which isn’t difficult to understand.\n\nRelationships leave marks and sometimes have consequences. The film offers a window into difficult and uncomfortable solutions. When we walk out of the theater, there is no sense of elation. The movie attempts to close on a high note, but we don’t buy it.\n\nThis is not a high-five type of a movie. But this is exactly what I appreciate about it. Once again John Abraham doesn’t shy away from a role that makes him appear unlikeable. Even though I must say he has never looked hotter and made my heart stop more than once with his brooding masculinity. Deep down he represents these dangerous type of men good girls are attracted to. And somewhere inside of him he might have caught a glimpse of familiarity with the dark side of his character. He played Ishaan with ease.\n\nThis movie reminds us to be better, as lovers, as friends, as mates. So it comes with a message. It’s almost a dialogue opener between the sexes, between partners. What do we want from each other, what are our expectations? What is acceptable, what not?\n\nI liked the conclusion of the movie. It was painfully realistic. Therefore I believe it won’t be a big box office success. For some reason I gravitate towards those.\n\nOn another level, I liked the nuanced cinematography. It’s a promising directorial debut for Kapil Sharma. Not a novice in the film industry, this is his first gig as director. Promising.\n\nWriter Devika Bhagat has written some fabulous screen-plays, like Manorama 6f u.Bachna Ae Haseena, Aisha, Ladies vs RB, JTHJ..\n\nEven though Devika takes a women-centric stance she still doesn’t lose perspective. We have our weaknesses too. I like that about her characters. Never comes out more than in this movie. Aisha was such a mix of likeable, manipulating, shallow and earnest.\n\nHowever, her characters put their foot down and are unafraid, facing a challenging world upfront. Gone are the times in India that women smile bashfully through abuses. Anushka, Gauri, even the mother are decision-makers and won’t get bullied into submission.\n\nDevika Bhagat writes for contemporary women, encouraging them to come into their own. Yet, a reconciling middle-ground should be the goal. I wouldn’t like to see male chauvinism being replaced by female chauvinism.We can find a seed of that threat in I, Me aur Main."
