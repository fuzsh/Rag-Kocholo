        "text": "Bollywood's handsome hero Shahid Kapoor is selecting one Telugu director after another to score hits. He worked with Sandeep Reddy Vanga on 'Kabir Singh' which was a remake of 'Arjun Reddy'. Telugu director Goutham Tinnanuri worked with Shahid Kapoor for 'Jersey' which is a remake of the Tollywood film of the same name starring Nani in the lead. Shahid scored a hit with 'Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljah Jiya' and there is an interesting news going around regarding his upcoming project.\n\nApparently, Shahid found another Telugu director to work with and it is none other than Vamsi Paidipally. After 'Maharshi', Vamsi went to Kollywood and made 'Varisu' with Thalapathy Vijay. Sources say that he is going to Bollywood now. Paidipally narrated a script to Shahid and the latter reportedly liked it a lot. If this news turns out to be true, Dil Raju will be bankrolling this film under his Sri Venkateswara Creations banner.\n\nThe 'Munna' director is currently fine-tuning the script and the pre-production works are expected to begin soon. On the work front, Shahid is expected to feature in the second season of hit web-series 'Farzi' and he is also working on 'Deva' which is expected to arrive in October. Pooja Hegde is the heroine in it while Siddharth Roy Kapur is the producer. Let us wait and see if Vamsi Paidipally works with Shahid in the coming days or not."
