        "text": "She was 14. He was 19. They met, fell in love and went on to kill 11 people, including the father, mother and sister of the girl. Two criminal lovers chased by the police, on a road to nowhere. This is stuff that Hollywood films thrive on. In this case, art only had to copy life.\n\nCharles Starkweather was only 19 when he went on a murder spree that ended the lives of 11 people in Nebraska and Wyoming in 1958. That he was accompanied in these activities by his then 14-year-old girlfriend Caril Ann Fugate added a layer of intrigue and dark mystery around it. This was a story waiting to be retold.\n\nNaturally, Hollywood could not resist this for too long and a film was made in 1963, titled The Sadist. Then came the 1973 film Badlands by legendary director Terence Malick. It was in fact the debut film of Malick who would then go on to make US classics such as Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line, The Tree of Life and The New World.\n\nBadlands is in no way a faithful documentation of the real-life antics of Charles Starkweather and Carol; it was rather ‘inspired’ by their last days. It had Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in title roles who managed to bring forth the casual deadliness with the supreme hollowness of their characters’ actions.\n\nBonnie and Clyde and The Highwaymen\n\nThe year was 1934. The bodies of notorious gangsters Bonnie Elizabeth Parker and Clyde Champion Barrow were brought to Arcadia after they were gunned down in an ambush in the Louisiana woods on May 23. The population of the sleepy town soon swelled from 2,000 to 12,000 within hours, according to many reports. People arrived in groups by train, horseback and even by plane. The city ran out of drinks and sandwiches.\n\nIn what could be a mix of misplaced hero worship, souvenir hunting and dark tourism, people tried to snatch whatever they could from the criminals. Including body parts like hair and fingers. The police had a tough time controlling the crazy mob. Bonnie and Clyde were known for bank robberies and the murder of 11 people, including police officers during the Great Depression. Their ‘heroics’ were frequently reported in the local media, often with photographs they posed for, elevating them to folk hero status during their lifetime.\n\nAt least three movies and many TV productions were based on the lives of Bonnie and Clyde. The Bonnie Parker Story (1958), starring Dorothy Provine, Bonnie and Clyde (1967) directed by Arthur Penn and The Highwaymen directed by John Lee Hancock were notable Hollywood productions.\n\nThe 1967 eponymous film starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway is not the first film on Bonnie and Clyde, but was said to have glamourised the criminal couple. The Netflix film The Highwaymen, on the other hand, recounts the story, rather coldly, from the eyes of former Texas Ranger Frank Hamer. It was Hamer’s relentless pursuit that brought curtains on their criminal career in the most devastating manner.\n\nBlack Friday (2004)\n\nOn March 12, 1993, a series of terrorist bomb blasts ripped through Mumbai, India’s commercial capital. There were 12 in all, including one at the Bombay Stock Exchange Building, the symbol of India’s financial network. The blasts shook the entire country to the core. 257 people lost their lives and over 1,400 people were injured in a single day. The attacks were allegedly organised by Indian fugitive don Dawood Ibrahim through his associates Tiger Memon and his brother Yaqub Memon. A massive manhunt ensued after which several people including Yaqub Memon were captured and put on trial.\n\nBlack Friday is an Indian film in Hindi about the Mumbai serial blasts of 1993. The film directed by Anurag Kashyap details the events that led to the blasts and the following police investigation. The film is based on a book by Indian author and investigative journalist Hussain Zaidi. It portrays the role of Memon, his brother Yaqub and their associates who orchestrated serial blasts.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India verdict that came on 21 March 2013 upheld the death sentence against suspected ringleader Yakub. He was later executed on July 30, 2015. Tiger Memon was never caught.\n\nCatch Me If You Can\n\nFrank William Abagnale Jr was an American con artist and convicted felon. Born in New York in 1948, his first victim was his own father. Abagnale was only 15 at that time. He later enlisted in US Navy but was discharged soon. He moved on to car theft, stealing bank cheques, and impersonating government officials. In 1968, after many convictions and releases, he impersonated himself as a TWA pilot and moved to Louisiana. Abagnale was again caught and convicted to 12 years in jail on June 2, 1969. He fled to Europe and was arrested in France, and served three months there. He was then extradited to Sweden for fraud and deported back to the US in 1970.\n\nBack in the US, he again started impersonating airline pilots and issuing bad checks. He was arrested after he cashed 10 fake PanAm payroll cheques in different places. Escaped from jail and was picked up 4 days later. Sentenced to 10 years and additional 2 years for escaping from jail. 1975, he started a new career as a security consultant and public speaker.\n\nAbagnale Jr is a con no doubt but just how big a con he is still to be ascertained. be cause he was often found to be making tall claims as to the magnitude of his con jobs in a bid to subsist on his ‘fame’.\n\nCatch Me If You Can is a Hollywood biographical drama directed by none other than Steven Spielberg. The screenplay is based on Abagnale’s autobiography though he was never involved with the film. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks in top roles.\n\n‘Kurup’, ‘NH 47’ and ‘Pinneyum’\n\nIn January 1984, the charred body of a film representative K J Chacko was found in a black Ambassador car on a national highway in Kerala, India. That was the beginning of the unravelling of one of the most intriguing and sinister murder plots in the state. A wealthy expatriate Sukumara Kurup was accused of killing Chacko to fake his own death for insurance money. Chacko was forcibly poisoned and strangled to death, it would emerge later. His body was then burned inside the car to make it difficult to identify him and look like it was Kurup who died in the accident. Kurup has been one of India's most wanted criminals and continues to evade arrest.\n\nThe movie 'Kurup', which was simultaneously released in five languages, was based the cold-blooded crime. Dulquer Salmaan plays the role of Kurup in the movie, directed by Srinath Rajendran. The film also features Indrajit Sukumaran, Shine Tom Chacko, Sunny Wein and Shobitha Dhulipal. ‘Kurup’ is currently streaming on Netflix. The Chacko murder case also inspired two other Malayalam films; NH 47 (1984), directed by Baby and Pinneyum (2016) by Ador Gopalakrishnan.\n\n'Talvar' and ‘Rahasya’\n\nArushi Talwar, a 14-year-old girl from Noida, just minutes away from the Indian capital of New Delhi, was found dead with her throat slit in her bedroom on May 16, 2008. A day later, the body of Nepalese domestic help Hemraj was also found on the terrace of their house. The girl's parents, dentist couple Rajesh and Nupur Talwar were sent to jail initially by a court. They walked free from prison after 4 years as the court declared them not guilty. The double murder of Aarushi Talwar and Hemraj remains an unsolved case.\n\nThe gruesome event has inspired two films, Talvar and Rahasya, both of which are based on the failed, murky investigation. 'Talvar' was directed by Meghna Gulzar with Irrfan Khan playing the main role. The movie clinched the Best Adapted Screenplay at the 63rd National Film Awards of India. It is currently available on Netflix. The movie ‘Rahasya’ directed by Manish Gupta received favourable reviews and remained popular for 100 days at the box office.\n\nMolly’s Game\n\nMolly Bloom is a US entrepreneur, speaker and author who was charged with running a high-stake poker game that attracted wealthy people and celebrities from Hollywood and sports. Before this, she was into competitive skiing (her mother was a ski and snowboard instructor and her brother was an Olympic skier) before she suffered an injury while trying to qualify for Olympics herself.\n\nIn 2007, Bloom started Molly Bloom Inc. as an event and catering company to host poker tournaments. By 2008, the games had moved on to private homes and hotels, with hands going as high as $4 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Even the Russian mafia allegedly turned up and took part in her games, according to reports.\n\nThe FBI finally stormed her place and arrested her in the middle of the night. Defence lawyer Charlie Jaffey tells his client of the prosecutors' offer to let her keep the money and her freedom in return for all her hard drives containing gambling records. Molly pleaded guilty and in 2014, she was sentenced to one year of probation, a $200,00 fine and community service. She went on to write an autobiography Molly's Game, which was later adapted into a film by the same name.\n\nMolly's Game was written for the screen and directed by Aaron Sorkin. The film was released in 2017 and starred Jessica Chastain in the lead role.\n\nThe Serpent (2021) and Main Aur Charles (2015):\n\nCharles Gurumukh Sobhraj Hotchand Bhawnani is the full name of a French serial killer of Indian origin otherwise bluntly known as bikini killer. The conman and serial murderer Sobhraj was born in Saigon to an Indian father and a Vietnamese mother and his tryst with petty crimes started as a teenager. While he is believed to have killed between 10- 20 tourists in different Asian countries and was imprisoned in India for twenty years from 1977 to 97, only nine of his victims have been known for certain.\n\nThe Serpent was an eight-part British crime series produced by BBC One and Netflix on the life of Charles Sobhraj while Main Aur Charles is a Bollywood crime thriller based on his life. Tahar Rahim essays the role of Sobhraj in the series.\n\nIn the Bollywood version, after escaping from a high-security jail, Sobhraj becomes the target of a massive manhunt led by a sincere cop who is determined to arrest him.

The men arrived at the branch and the leader of the team produced a search warrant. Security cameras were turned off and they collected cash and samples of jewellery from the outlet. The leader of the gang then promptly left the scene, never to be seen again. It was later revealed that the leader, known by the name Mon Singh, had posted an ad in the newspaper previously and recruited the team of fake CBI officers after conducting an interview. The case has remained unsolved.\n\nThe Bollywood film Special 26 is directed by Neeraj Pandey.

He focussed on defending the cases of those who he thought were falsely accused of terror charges.
