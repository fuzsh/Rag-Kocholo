        "text": "By Karan Anshuman\n\n​Actors: Raj Kumar Yadav, Prabhleen Sandhu, Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, Kay Kay Menon, Baljinder Kaur Director: Hansal Mehta Certification: U/A Rating: ***1/2\n\nShahid is an important story to tell. DirectorHansal Mehta has done a remarkable job chronicling the true tale of slain advocate Shahid Azmi and bringing it to the mainstream. It goes well beyond being a fierce biopic, a purposeful indie, or just a riveting drama that’s impossible to dislike. Reflecting the intention of its protagonist, Shahid, sharing a hallmark with all significant films, ultimately makes a statement.\n\nYou’re thrust into the narrative with Shahid’s (Raj Kumar Yadav) neighborhood engulfed in the flames of the ‘92 riots. The violence is real, immediate. You hold your breath as he desperately tries to get back into his own house; his untrusting family refusing to open the door to their squalid tenement.\n\nThe incident’s impact scars Shahid to take up the cause of the jihadi and he heads to the terrorist training camps of Kashmir. By the time he realises this is not who he is, the film is barely done with its opening titles. You could argue that Mehta glosses over what seems to be a major (and dissonant) chapter in the character’s life story, but then you’d be asking to be spoon-fed. In any case, the wound lies exposed and open to the elements in the final courtroom showdown as he defends Faheem Ansari, the prime accused in the 26/11 attacks case in the climax.\n\nWhen he comes back, he does a stint in jail; here he meets his mentor and discovers a penchant for academics. His own acquittal and friend’s observation, “[the] Indian judiciary … it works,” puts him on a firm but perilous course to study and take up law, a vocation he excels in and makes it a mission to take on the cases of underprivileged Muslims wrongly accused under TADA.\n\nBut, it’s in between all the extraordinary drama and action where the film is – where Shahid Azmi is – heart lies. The most touching moments are with his family of three brothers and his mother.\n\nPinches of real-life humor are like sparks in a long, dark night. His cramped Deonar one room apartment has a single light source that he is not allowed to use to study under at night, his overly supportive brother (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub), who in a brilliant scene, admits he is been pushed to the breaking point, and his ever-worrying mother who displays an uncanny, unexpected wisdom in handling her children.\n\nThere is also his reticent affair with one of his first clients – Mariam that develops into a cataclysmic romance.\n\nIt is this clash of the professional and personal life of Shahid that Mehta beautifully orchestrates and eventually brings them to a head when the advocate starts receiving death threats from hardliners.\n\nThe parallels with MK Gandhi and the protector of the defenseless are hard to miss. And this is the overarching philosophy writers treat their story with when in doubt.That Shahid is shot on a budget is evident and but for most part the 5D’s images don’t matter. Scale fumbles with the larger moments: montages of key events and when the film attempts to reach beyond personal moments. Liberal use of fade out and fade ins to show timelapses irks mildly.\n\nThe court scenes are terrific and Mehta shows how they are done. Unconventional sets, an unusual trick of overlaying dialogue (while still making sense of everything), and faint humour come together perfectly and make these scenes impossible to overlook. I don’t know about how authentic they are (and they do seem a tad simplistic) but any more detailing would’ve risked the episodes turning dreary.\n\nUnlike lead actors in Hindi films who attempt to shine through their sheer energy, or by underplaying, or simply carrying off a certain look; Raj Kumar Yadav bares his soul like few others have in the past.\n\nThis is not an easy thing to do as not every performance of actors who takes this route comes off looking sane. But, Raj Kumar controls that animal and delivers an exceptional rendition of Shahid Azmi. He’s strongly supported by the likes of Prabhleen Sandhu, Vipin Sharma, and Ayyub.\n\nFew words are as impactful than “Based on a true story” before a film starts. Automatically the next couple of hours become consequential. The more unbelievable the narrative, the more thrilling it is. Real life is the best inspiration for cinema and Shahid is an excellent example. His account would’ve remained untold, relegated to forgotten editions of newspapers, had the story not affected the filmmakers.\n\nkaran.anshuman@timesgroup.com\n\nTweets @krnx"
