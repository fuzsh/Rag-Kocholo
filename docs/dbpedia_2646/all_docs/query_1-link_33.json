We had earlier reported that Nishant Malkani, who was almost finalized to play the lead role, is no longer a part of the show. We now hear that a new face from Kolkata has been finalized to play the male lead. The story will revolve around this guy (much younger in age) and the manner in which he falls for a girl who is older than him.\n\nSubmitted by TellychakkarTeam on Tue, 06/12/2012 - 19:05\n\nAbout Author\n\nSubmitted by TellychakkarTeam on Tue, 06/12/2012 - 19:05"
