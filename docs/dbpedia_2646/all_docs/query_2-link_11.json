T\n\nSubmitted by TellychakkarTeam on Sat, 08/18/2012 - 16:25\n\nActress Prabhleen Sandhu is on cloud nine as her maiden film as protagonist Shahid has been officially selected to be premiered in the Toronto International Film Festival 2012. The movie is the true story of slain human rights activist and lawyer Shahid Azmi, who was killed in 2010 by unidentified assailants in his office. The film starring Raj Kumar Yadav and Prabhleen Sandhu will take us through the journey of Shahid and his wife Maryam, played by Rajkumar and Prabhleen. T alking about it, Prabhleen tells Tellychakkar.com, “Yes, it is a great feeling indeed. It was a memorable experience working with the team of Shahid. I got to learn so much from director Hansal Mehta; I am a typical director’s actor and I thank Hansalji for helping me throughout the shoot. And to represent the movie at the Toronto International Film Festival is really exciting.” Ask her about the chosen attire for the D-day and she quips, “That’s the major problem. I have not been able to decide on the dress and color of it. I have an Indo-Western look in the movie, so will probably go for a similar look.” On her comeback to television, Prabhleen has to say this, “Well, I have been offered few roles in the last few months. Recently I got called to play Dharti Maa in Zee TV’s Ramayan, but I do not want to do cameos. If I take up television, it has to be a challenging lead role.” Prabhleen, wish you all the best for the film festival!!\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nHaha\n\n0\n\nYay\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nSubscribe Here"
