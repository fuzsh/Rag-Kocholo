        "text": "Shahid Kapoor’s next will be an action thriller directed by Malayalam director Rosshan Andrrews, who is known for films such as Salute (2022) Kayamkulam Kochunni (2018). The film will be bankrolled by Zee Studios and Roy Kapur Films.\n\nThe plot will be about a rebellious police officer who gets involved in a high-profile case. The story promises mystery and intrigue at its centre with plenty of action.\n\nKapoor talked about the movie, saying, \"It's rare to find a subject that has action, thrill, drama, and suspense all packed into one script and I am really looking forward to this. It's a privilege to be collaborating with Zee Studios and with Siddharth Roy Kapur, with whom I have worked on Haider and Kaminey earlier. We have also been neighbours for a long time, haha! Rosshan Andrrews is a veteran filmmaker whose Malayalam filmography is spectacular. We have spent many months together now and it will be a pleasure to work with such a fantastic cinematic mind. I can't wait to bring this exhilarating, entertaining, and thrilling story to the masses.\"\n\nAndrrews said, “I am thrilled to make my Bollywood debut with this gripping story and work with such an incredible team of professionals. The combination of Shahid's exceptional acting, Siddharth Roy Kapur's expertise as a producer, and Zee Studios' commitment to delivering ground-breaking content is truly inspiring. Their passion and dedication to the project have been instrumental in bringing the story to life. As a director, I aim to create an immersive cinematic experience that leaves audiences awed. I believe that this project has all the necessary elements to achieve that goal.\""
