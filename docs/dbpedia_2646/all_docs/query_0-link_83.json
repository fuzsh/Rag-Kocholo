        "text": "This is one busy weekend with the Box Office buzzing with six movies. We have Pyar Ka Punchnama 2, Wedding Pullav, Chinar Dastaan-E-Ishq, Hogaya Dimaag Ka Dahi, Crimson Peak and Bridge Of Spies.\n\nBRIDGE OF SPIES: Tom Hanks is back again with a thriller. Though somehow he looks his best in soft movies like ‘Forrest Gump’, ‘The Terminal’ and ‘Cast Away’ to name a few, he also sets into a thriller pretty well. This week we see Tom Hanks in this American historical dramatic thriller film based on the 1960 U-2 incident.\n\nDirected by the ace director Steven Spielberg himself, the film tells us the story of Tom Hanks (James Donovan) who is an Insurance lawyer and is sent on a Government mission to do the impossible.\n\nA Soviet spy Rudolf Abel is caught and is defended by Donovan in court against his country. At the same time Soviet Union also captures a U.S spy plane and its pilot Francis Gary Powers with a lot of classified information. Now Donovan is sent to do a prisoner exchange and trade the freedom of the pilot with the Soviet Spy.\n\nAlong with Tom Hanks the film features Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan and Alan Alda. Being a Steven Spielberg movie, this one is surely a must watch!!!\n\nCRIMSON PEAK: Directed by Guillermo del Toro, this is a gothic romance film. The ‘Pacific Rim’ director is back with a dark haunted love story. She is the daughter of an industrialist and he is an inventor in search of funds for his latest invention. Love turns into marriage and Edith, comes to a crumbling mansion called Crimson Peak, which is home for Thomas, the husband.\n\nHe lives there with his sister Lucille and they mysteriously plot a few deaths around the place. Edith has the powers to hear and speak to the dead in the mansion, so unravels dirty deep mysteries buried in the mines below the mansion.\n\nThe film stars Mia Wasikowska, Tom Hiddleston, Jessica Chastain, Charlie Hunnam and Jim Beaver.\n\nWEDDING PULLAV: Directed by Binod Pradhan, this is an Indian romantic comedy film. This is not the first time when best friends discover love for each other. We have seen it in ‘My Best Friend’s Wedding,’ ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and ‘Mere Yaar Ki Shaadi Hai.’ Wedding Pullav is about two friends almost getting married to others and realizing that they cannot live without each other.\n\nThe film stars debutants Kannada actor Diganth, Anushka Ranjan, Karan Grover, Rishi Kapoor and Parmeet Sethi.\n\nCHINAR DASTAAN-E-ISHQ: Directed By Sharique Minhaj, this is a love story. The film features Faisal Khan, Inayat Sharma, Dalip Tahil, Pramod Mautho and Shahbaz Khan. Amir Khan’s younger brother Faisal makes a comeback after years in this film.\n\nHO GAYA DIMAAG KA DAHI: Directed by Fauzia Arshi, this is a roller-coaster comedy film. It weaves the catch me if you can chase, where if you are caught you are dead.\n\nThe film features Kader Khan, Om Puri, Raajpal Yadav, Sanjay Mishra, Razak Khan, Vijay Patkar and Amita Nangia.\n\nPYAR KA PUNCHNAMA 2: Directed by Luv Ranjan, this is the sequel to Pyar Ka Punchnama which came in 2011. The film then did not bomb the Box Office but gradually picked a lot of traffic. The film is about three friends who are desperate to fall in love somehow. And yes they eventually do, but the definition of love is different this time. Similar to the earlier film, the sequel seems to make you roll away in laughter splits.\n\nThe film stars Kartik Aaryan, Nushrat Bharucha, Divyendu Sharma and Raayo S. Bakhirta.\n\nTill next week … its ciao!\n\nAn exciting weekend with five releases. This Movie Time sees ‘Shahid’, ‘Boss’, ‘Rajula’, ‘Captain Phillips’ and ‘Escape Plan’ – an interesting mix of action, romance, comedy and thrills. Here are the releases in detail for you:\n\nSHAHID (A) (Hindi)\n\nAnurag Kashyap debuted as a writer with Hansal Mehta in ‘Jayate’ and today he produces a film for him, a dream project called Shahid. Directed by Hansal Mehta, Shahid is a biographical drama film based on the life of human rights activist and lawyer Shahid Azmi, and is produced by Anurag Kashyap and Sunil Bohra.\n\n“I’ve died a hundred times and if death did come knocking, I would look it in the eye,” said Shahid Azmi and that is exactly what he did. The film depicts his life span, struggle, achievements, triumphs and the humiliation he faced in a short time of 32 years after which he was murdered.\n\nThe character of Shahid Azmi in the film Shahid is played by Raj Kumar whom we have seen earlier in Gangs of Wasseypur and Kai Po Che. Raj Kumar stated that he is very proud of the film as it has been made with a lot of love and honesty.\n\nIn the film there is a scene of the interrogation in which the accused Shahid is humiliated by the officials. To do this scene Raj Kumar proposed that he should go naked so as to feel the embarrassment and the pain the character must have gone through and it is said that after this scene Raj Kumar cried for three hours and was left emotionally drained.\n\nShahid stars Raj Kumar, Prabhleen Sandhu, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub, Tigmanshu Dhulia and K.K Menon. A UTV motion pictures release, Shahid is scripted by Hansal Mehta, Sameer and Apurva Asrani.\n\nBOSS (Hindi)\n\nA Bollywood action film Boss is the story of a father and a son. With lots of action and drama, Boss stars Akshay Kumar, Mithun Chakraborty and Aditi Rao Hydari. Directed by Anthony D’Souza, it was released mid week on 16th October, to cash in on the Eid festival.\n\nRAJULA (Hindi)\n\nA 700-year-old story is brought to life again. The ancient tale of Rajula and Malushahi is what the film Rajula is about. Written and directed by Nitin Tewari, Rajula is the first movie from Uttrakhand to win the best film in the audiences choice award at the Delhi International Film Festival 2012.\n\nThe story is about this documentary film maker Ravi who is searching for a topic to make his film and then he stumbles upon the age old love story of Rajula and Malushahi. As he goes deeper into the traditional tale of love he discovers the strength of a woman in love and her struggle to make love a success.\n\nThe cast of Rajula includes, Karan Sharma and Ashima Pandey.\n\nCAPTAIN PHILLIPS (English)\n\nDirected by Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips is a biographical film depicting the life of the merchant mariner Captain Richard Phillips who was taken hostage by the pirates during the Maersk Alabama hijacking in 2009.\n\nThe cast includes Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. Two time Oscar winner Tom Hanks plays Captain Richard Phillips and critics say this is his true comeback movie – one of his best performances after ‘Cast Away’. On the other hand, Barkhad Abdi is a first time Somali actor who plays the main Somalian hijacker in Captain Phillips. Expect strong performances by both.\n\nThe film had to face major criticism as the real crew members claim that Captain Phillips is anything but a hero. It was his recklessness that steered the ship Maesrk Alabama, Phillips was commanding into the Somalian pirates infested waters.\n\nThe crew members of Maesrk Alabama have told CNN that the Captain did not lock the doors at the right time and literally led the pirates into the ship. According to the chief engineer of the Maesrk Alabama, Captain Phillips also ignored the seven warnings given to him as emails to remain 600 miles of the Somalian coast. But Richard Phillips ignored all the warnings and continued to lead the ship into the pirate infested waters and made himself a hostage.\n\nThe question is, does the film Captain Phillips depict the real story as the crew members claim the truth is different from the book on which the movie is based. Written by Stephan Talty and Richard Phillips himself, the book is called ‘A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy Seals and Dangerous Days at Sea’.\n\nCaptain Phillips is a movie to be seen for the performances and some amazing cinematography by Barry Ackroyd.\n\nESCAPE PLAN (A) (English)\n\nAnd here they come again. Two men who were the ruling superstars in their times are back with a high Octane thriller. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger starring together in action thriller Escape Plan. The story of two men who help each other and break one of the largest prisons with the maximum security.\n\nStallone is Ray who signs a deal to break out from a high security prison. He is drugged on the way and so he ends up in a glass cell prison with the world’s most dreaded criminals in an unknown location. He who is an expert in breaking out of cells is now trapped with no contact with the outside world.\n\nHe takes the help of mysterious Schwarzenegger who is inside the prison and the strongest of all. Together they make an escape plan only to find out that they are in the middle of a sea in an oil tanker. Will their escape plan work and save their skins?\n\nDirected by Swedish filmmaker Mikael Hafstrom, Escape Plan is written by Miles Chapman and the cinematography is by Brendan Galvin.\n\nSo we get to see how do the old stars perform in their come back movies? In this age, how will they manage the stunts as they have been doing some of the most amazing stunts all their lives. Stallone remembered for his ‘Rocky’ series and California Governor Schwarzenegger for his ‘Terminator’ series, have won a million hearts.\n\nSo all you lovers of these men, go for Escape Plan. To see them together will be a treat.\n\nThis is an exciting weekend with some good movies. Do get back with the reviews as soon as you see some of these.\n\nhttps://gcaffe.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/movie-time-oct-18-24-2013.mp3"
