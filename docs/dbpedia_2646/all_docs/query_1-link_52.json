        "text": "Synopsis\n\nProduced by the makers of ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, the free-to-air web series will be released on Facebook during Diwali.\n\nNEW DELHI: A first-of-its-kind web series — a tribute to Bollywood strugglers — will be released this Diwali. The web series will introduce as many as 156 actors, those who have unsuccessfully struggled in the Indian movie industry for several years, sometimes even decades.\n\nProduced by the makers of ‘Gangs of Wasseypur’, the free-to-air web series will be released on Facebook during Diwali. Titled “Akki Vikki te Nikki”, it will be the directorial debut of critically acclaimed actor Vipin Sharma. “It is a homage to the indefatigable spirit of those who want to see themselves on the silver screen regardless of the cost,” Sharma told ET.\n\nSharma made his debut in Bollywood opposite superstar Aamir Khan in the widely acclaimed movie “Taare Zameen Par”. Sharing the making of the series, Sharma said, “I had announced that we are looking for bad actors.” But much to their surprise, actors turned up in hundreds for the audition. Prabhleen Sandhu, who featured in the national award winning movie “Shahid”, said, “Some struggles cannot be explained. Some end in disappointment, while some become successful journeys.\n\nThis (web series) is a tribute to the journey of all those who have struggled in the movie industry.” Sandhu will be playing a critical role in the eight-part web series.\n\nBesides Sandhu, the series will also feature Zeishan Quadri, actor and co-author of the Bollywood hit “Gangs of Wasseypur”.\n\nAnother highlight of the series is that all the actors have been given a chance by Bombaycasting.com-brainchild of film producers Bohra Bros, which calls itself the country’s first online acting portal. The portal invites self-shot videos from actors across the country, after which a panel of experts from the National School of Drama (NSD) and Film & Television Institute of India (FTII) shortlist the actors.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nTata Consumer Products needs a Starbucks ‘shot’ to increase its market value exponentially\n\nPorts to power, what companies facing insolvency mean for Adani Group\n\nA list of 20 large-cap stocks where you have lost money big time.\n\nThe challenges dotting India’s push for 6G leadership\n\nAre Yamaha dealer IPO investors and Sir Isaac Newton on the same page?\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3"
