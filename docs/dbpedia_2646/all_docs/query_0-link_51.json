        "text": "Shahid\n\nCast: Raj Kumar, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Kay Kay Menon\n\nDirection: Hansal Mehta\n\nRating:\n\nRead Review: Movie review: Shahid\n\nOn Feb 11, 2010 lawyer Shahid Azmi, a crusader for the wrongly accused, arrived in his office in Kurla to meet people who needed his help. It was a trap. He was shot dead. While the 32-year-old Azmi was a favourite of the poor and the framed, he wasn't the most popular among the police, whose flawed investigations he regularly exposed.\n\nIn a seven-year long career, Azmi had 17 acquittals, an impressive statistic given Indian judiciary's infamous reputation for long, unending trials. It is one of the many interesting details that director Hansal Mehta's earnest biopic gives viewers about a bright young man.\n\n{blurb}\n\nIn Azmi, Mehta has found a real, unsung hero who overcame a life fraught with difficulties and twists and turns. Mehta uses a linear narrative, which highlights the key moments in Azmi's life.\n\nThe film starts off with the 1992-93 riots in Bombay, an episode that disturbs Azmi, then a teenager, and lures him to a fundamentalist ideology. But his stint at a militant training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir is short-lived and he escapes unconvinced that violence is the solution. On his return, he is arrested for a conspiracy to kill leaders like Bal Thackeray. There's no evidence of Azmi's guilt but he signs a confession, thinking it's his ticket to freedom. He soon finds himself behind bars for seven years. The time spent in Tihar jail is instrumental as it triggers in Azmi the passion to fight for ordinary men facing extraordinary circumstances and labelled terrorists without any proof. On his release, he decides to study law and become a part of the very judicial system that denied him justice.\n\nIt's not only the professional life that Mehta concerns himself with. He follows a sweet but doomed romance as well as focuses on Azmi's close bond with his elder brother Arif (Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub), who supports him financially and emotionally once he is out of prison. The film also stages some of the most naturalistic and dramatic courtroom scenes seen in Hindi films. There is no Sunny Deol-style screaming or OMG!-like lecturing but humorous banter between lawyers and intelligible cross-questioning.\n\nMehta's decision to shoot on real locations, many of which were Azmi's haunts such as Govandi and Kurla, makes the film more believable and convincing. Apurva Asrani's taut editing ensures that you are engrossed in Azmi's journey. Also noteworthy is Mukesh Chhabra's fine casting which features unfamiliar faces who seem tailor-made for the roles they play.\n\nThe bright star of Shahid though is Raj Kumar. After Kai Po Che, Kumar is yet again in fine form as he demonstrates the vulnerability of Azmi as well as his steely determination. It is a passionate performance that makes him a serious best actor contender during awards season.\n\nTraditionally, Bollywood is known to turn biopics into hagiographic accounts of the subjects. But Shahid stops short of hero worship and is a fitting tribute to an inspiring figure.\n\nPublished By:\n\nAtMigration\n\nPublished On:\n\nOct 18, 2013\n\n--- ENDS ---"
