        "text": "New Delhi: Rajkumar Yadav displayed his acting potential in Dibakar Banerjee's 'LSD' and through films such as 'Shaitaan', 'Kai Po Che' and 'Talaash', he has emerged as a powerful character actor. Now, he is going to be seen in director Hansal Mehta's 'Shahid', which is based on the controversial story of slain activist and lawyer Shahid Azmi.\n\nHansal Mehta started his career in direction with 2000 film 'Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar' and went on to make films like 'Chhal', 'Ye Kya Ho Raha Hai' and 'Woodstock Villa', but he decided to take a break from films after 'Woodstock Villa' which was released in 2008.\n\nNow, he has come up with a story that is based on facts and real events. 'Shahid' was premiered at the Toronto Film festival in 2012, and was received with enthusiasm.\n\nThe film also features Tigmanshu Dhulia, Zeeshan Ayyub and KK Menon.\n\n'Shahid' is now going to face a tough test at the box-office.\n\nRohit Vats of IBNLive is inside the theatre to live tweet the experience of 'Shahid'.\n\n09:36 AM: Stay tuned for the tweet review of #Shahid. #Shahid was shown at Toronto Film Fest in 2012.

One of them is a brilliantly written court scene. Rajkumar Yadav steals the show through this scene.\n\n12:22 PM: Prabhleen Sandhu has played the role of Marian in #Shahid.
