        "text": "What is it?\n\nOne of the most acclaimed and controversial independent movies at film festivals around the world last year, 'Shahid' will have a mainstream theatrical release under the Disney UTV umbrella. Directed by Hansal Mehta, the film features Raj Kumar as Shahid along with Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur. According to the director, the true story of Shahid Azmi and his inspiring life is essential viewing for our times of strife, discord and mistrust.\n\n`Shahid' has travelled to several film festivals including Toronto, Dubai and Mumbai witnessing critical acclaim. The film won the Silver Gateway Trophy at the 14th Mumbai film festival while Hansal Mehta won the Best Director award. Hansal went on to win the best director at New York Indian Film Festival and at the Indian Film Festival of Stuttgart. In the past, Shahid had a World Premiere at Toronto International Film Festival 2012 (TIFF 2012), Opening Film at Dharamshala International Film Festival, Centerpiece at New York Indian Film Festival and Centerpiece at Chicago South Asian Film Festival.\n\nThe Storyline\n\n`Shahid' is a true story of slain human rights activist and lawyer Shahid Azmi, who was killed in 2010 by unidentified assailants in his office. From attempting to become a terrorist, to being wrongly imprisoned under a draconian anti-terrorism law, to becoming a champion of human rights (particularly of the Muslim minorities in India),' Shahid' traces the inspiring personal journey of a boy who became an unlikely messiah for human rights, while following the rise of communal violence in India.\n\nThe Arrival\n\n`Shahid' hits the theatres on 18th October 2013."
