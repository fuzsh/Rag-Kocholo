        "text": "We often come across certain individuals who not only mesmerize us with their beauty, but also their simplicity. I met one such person who is immensely talented and a jovial personality. An actress by profession, who has made her mark on television as well as been an integral part of the award winning film ‚ÄúSHAHID‚Äù.\n\nHaving done her Masters in English, her television shows like ‚ÄúMohe Rang De‚Äù (Colors TV) and ‚ÄúAapki Antara‚Äù (Zee TV) have received overwhelming response and appreciation, before she took the next big step of shining on the silver screen. She started her career with Punjabi films, after which she entered bollywood with films like Ram Gopal Verma‚Äôs ‚ÄúNot A Love Story‚Äù and Raj Purohit‚Äôs teen drama ‚ÄúSIXTEEN‚Äù before bagging the role of ‚ÄúMariam‚Äù in the movie ‚ÄòShahid‚Äô opposite actor Rajkumar Rao.\n\nI had the opportunity to interact with this diva and know more about her. Meet PRABHLEEN SANDHU\n\nQ. How would your best friends describe you?\n\n‚ÄúEntertainment, Entertainment, Entertainment‚Äù yes, that‚Äôs exactly how my friends would describe me. In a world full of problems, I am glad I can be someone to spread some cheer and take away your dull moments.\n\nQ.Whats the most fun thing you have done in your life?\n\nThe most fun thing I have done in my life is being an Actor. From day one of my acting career, it has been fun everyday and of course, it has been an adventurous ride as well.\n\nQ.Your television show ‚ÄúAapki Antara‚Äù and movie ‚ÄúShahid‚Äù, both are based on social issues. Was it a conscious decision to take up such roles or did it just happen?\n\nActually, I have always been inclined towards social work as my dad has been associated with a social welfare society in Punjab where he is holding the President‚Äôs post, engaging into a lot of doing social work. So, it was a conscious decision and it happened too. And I‚Äôm always proud of the kind of work I do.\n\nQ.If not an actress, what would you have been?\n\nI think I would have been a ‚Äòfailure‚Äô in any field other than films. This is what I always wanted to do! I love my profession and I feel blessed to be a part of this industry.\n\nQ. One person who has had the most positive influence on your life?\n\nWhen I was in Punjab, my mom had the most positive influence on my life.There was a time when I was growing up and I was jealous of my classmate and that‚Äôs when my mom explained that being jealous will only waste my time and energy, whereas the other person would not be affected at all. And I think I have never been jealous of anybody after that. So that‚Äôs the kind of positive influence my mom has had on me. In the later stage of my life, when I shifted to Mumbai, Mr. Sunil Bohra (a famous personality in film production) has had the most positive influence on my life. Whenever I‚Äôm a feeling low, he is the one who uplifts my mood and shows me the positive side of the life.\n\nQ. One quote that really inspires you\n\n‚ÄúTHE SIZE OF YOUR AUDIENCE DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! ‚Äù\n\nQ. Have you been to Goa? What do you like the most about the place?\n\nYa I have been to Goa once during International Film Festival of India (IFFI). I simply loved Goa ( everything about it). I wish I can make some more trips soon, and this time for leisure.\n\nQ. If you had to describe yourself in one word, what would it be?\n\nGorgeous ( inside n outside) üòâ\n\nQ. What are your future plans?\n\nI take life as it comes. I have never planned anything in life and that has been always a blessing for me. So no future plans. Lets wait and watch, what life has in store for me.\n\nQ.Your thoughts about the blogger Pooja?\n\nPOOJA, you a real rockstar and a very genuine person. I have met u just once but I feel like we know each other since childhood. This is the connection I think you make with not only me but with everybody. And thank me too‚Ä¶I have taught u how to be that cool!!!! üòâ ha ha!\n\nI had fun catching with up this fun girl‚Ä¶I am sure you had fun reading about her too. Let me know your feedback, in the comments section.\n\nThats it for now.\n\nMuch Love\n\nPooja üôÇ"
