However, this martyr will shed blood on the small screen. 24-year-old Prabhleen Sandhu from Ferozpur , Punjab, has made her television debut as the revolutionary Kranti of Mohe Rang De on Colors. Mohe Rang De is a love story set against the backdrop of the 1942 Quit India Movement. In an exclusive chat with Tellychakkar, Prabhleen speaks on Mohe Rang De, patriotism and the Quit India Movement and more. Read on Tomorrow is the 66th anniversary of the Quit India Movement. How will you celebrate? We are going to shoot, shoot and shoot. For us every day is like a Quit India Movement. So are you saying that you want freedom from work? Noooo! I would never want that. I’m perfectly happy with what I am doing. Tell us about your background. I’m a Sikh, who hails from the city of martyrs (Ferozpur). The city shares its border with Pakistan. I’ve done my post graduate in English. My mother wanted me to be a teacher but I felt by being an actor I could play various characters. As one who hails from the city of martyrs, you fit the bill perfectly for Mohe Rang De Yeah, that’s what for my colleagues say. In fact, they call me a martyr too. Despite living in the city of martyrs, there isn’t one in our family. How did you start your career? I started my career with Punjabi films. My first film was Yaaran Naal Baharaan where I played Juhi Babbar’s friend. I’ve also finished my first Hindi film Tere Rang Me which is yet to be released. I never had to struggle much to get work and I was lucky to be chosen for Mohe Rang De.. Mohe Rang De, Tere Rang Me! And now your show is on Colors. There’s so much ‘rang’ to you now? What’s life without Colors? It’s just a coincidence that my first serial also has rang in its title. What is the response to your show? I’m not much into TRPs but what I’ve learnt is that those who are watching it have really liked it. People who know me as well those who don’t have appreciated the show. They find it very different The show is set against the backdrop of the Quit India movement. So, are you resorting to history books? To be honest I haven’t and I must confess that I was pretty bad at history. However, the main plot revolves around the love between Kranti and Rajveer (Gavie Chehal). Besides, it’s not necessary to read books, the atmosphere around our show is such that history is repeated in front of your eyes. From the look of it, Mohe Rang De is similar to the film 1942: A Love Story. Isn’t that a drawback for the show? No, I wouldn’t like to call it a drawback. On the contrary, it’s good for a show to be compared with a hit film. Viewers would want to see how the same plot comes out on television. Historical subjects are no longer working either on films or TV. Was there any apprehension before taking such a show? None at all. One should always think positively and needn’t worry about the negatives. It’s been 61 years since our independence. Does such a show appeal to the younger generation? There, I have to agree with you. The youth is more occupied with trivial things. In the past, I too was a bit hesitant about talking on patriotism as I feared what my friends would say. However deep inside I’m patriotic to the core. Finally, how will you celebrate this Independence Day? Whether I’ll be shooting or not, I’ll be hoisting the flag. I wasn’t doing it earlier but from now on I’ll hoist the flag every year. After all, I’m a krantikaari (revolutionary) now.\n\nLike\n\n0\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nHaha\n\n0\n\nYay\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nSubscribe Here"
