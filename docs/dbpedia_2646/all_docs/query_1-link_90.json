        "text": "Rating: 3.5/5\n\nReview:\n\nYou can escape a terror attack. You can fight terrorism. But what happens when you are branded a 'Terrorist' for life? On the grounds that your name reads 'Zahir', 'Faheem', 'Khan', 'Shaikh' (and not Matthew or Donald? God help!).\n\nEven if you're acquitted, the right to live a life in fairness and dignity is permanently adjourned. Case closed! The story of 'Shahid' (fact remixed with fiction) confronts us with hard-hitting questions on religious fundamentalism, flawed legal investigations, and injustices suffered by the underdogs.\n\nIn his teens, Shahid (Raj Kumar) witnesses the savagery of religious antagonism during the 1993 Mumbai riots. Shattered and shaken, he escapes from his 'slumdog' existence to Kashmir to join the militants. Unnerved with lessons in jihad and jingoism, he returns to a brief life of normalcy in Mumbai.\n\nThe past catches up. He's arrested and thrown into prison under Mumbai's anti-terror laws. During his term he meets co-quaidi and mentor who shows him light in the dark cells of his tormented existence. Shahid begins studying in jail, once acquitted, he gets his law degree and amidst much resentment, humiliation (often called jihadiyon ka Gandhi) and life-threatening challenges, he becomes a fearless champion for his cause. He remarkably wins some of the most controversial terrorism cases (including defending the prime accused in 2008 Mumbai terror attack). One fateful night Shahid is gunned down. His case files reopen.\n\nMehta's film is brutally honest, brave and above all a fascinating humane story. Nothing distracts the dark and disturbing subject, the narrative is not found guilty of over-dramatizations; indulgence or loaded lines (like 'tareek pe tareek' and 'Milord', here). He finds a perfect pitch at crucial points - The courtroom interrogations, Shahid's subtle romance with Mariam (Prabhleen), and moments shared with Arifbhai (Mohammed, in a fine performance) are subtle, but stirring.\n\nRaj Kumar is superb; he peels layers to strip to the core of his character. He magnifies the most intense scenes with sheer brilliance of an understated, realistic performance. It warrants applause. And an unadulterated encore. Catch it if real cinema is what you crave.\n\nNote: You might not like this film if gritty, real-life dramas are not your idea of entertaining cinema.\n\nCasts and credits:\n\nActors: Raj Kumar Yadav, Tigmanshu Dhulia, Prabhleen Sandhu, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Baljinder Kaur, Vinod Rawat, Vipin Sharma, Shalini Vatsa, Paritosh Sand, Mukesh Chhabra, Pawan Kumar, Vivek Ghamande\n\nProducers: Ronnie Screwvala, Siddharth Roy Kapur, Anurag Kashyap, Sunil Bohra\n\nDirectors: Hansal Mehta\n\nBanner: Bohra Bros Pvt. Ltd, AKFPL Production, UTV Spot Boy\n\nStory / Writers: Sameer Gautam Singh\n\nAdditional informations:\n\nCountry: India\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nGenre: Social\n\nRelease Date: Friday, 18th of October 2013\n\nRuntime: 129 minutes\n\nSynopsis:\n\n'Shahid' is a work of fiction based on the fascinating true story of slain human rights activist & lawyer Shahid Azmi. Accused of terrorist links, he was imprisoned under a draconian law before he went on to become a fearless lawyer. The film traces the awe-inspiring journey of an impoverished citizen who became an unlikely messiah for human rights and an inspiring testament to the human spirit. Hansal Mehtaâ€™s latest film Shahid, based on the life of slain defense lawyer Shahid Azmi, is a powerful story about a man who stood up for what he believed in and paid the price for it. Powered by the belief of the director and a convincing cast that manages to suck you in, the film is the kind that will stay with you long after the lights turn back on.\n\nMovie trailer:"
