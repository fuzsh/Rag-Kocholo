        "text": "Mumbai: Actor Rajkumar Yadav will make an appearance on TV show ‘Yeh Hai Aashiqui’. He will be seen in the role of a lawyer, just like his character in his forthcoming movie ‘Shahid’. He says working on the show was \"fantastic\". \"It was a fantastic experience. I had a great time with everyone in the team. It is such a great team and they actually made my job easier,\" Rajkumar said in a statement. \"I have seen a few episodes of `Yeh Hai Aashiqui` and it is phenomenal. The kind of work they are doing and the stories they are showing is very different,\" the ‘Kai Po Che’ actor said of the show which features unconventional love stories which aren`t easily accepted by Indian society. Rajkumar`s ‘Shahid’ co-star Prabhleen Sandhu too will be seen in a critical role in the show`s episode which will be aired on Bindass Sunday. Actors Shakti Arora and Anupriya Kapoor will be seen in the lead roles in the episode. ‘Yeh Hai Aashiqui’ is hosted by Vikrant Massey."
