        "text": "Indian actor Shahid Kapoor began his career as a background dancer, making uncredited appearances in the films Dil To Pagal Hai (1997) and Taal (1999).[1] He also appeared in several music videos, including one for the singer Kumar Sanu, before making his acting debut with a lead role in Ken Ghosh's romantic comedy Ishq Vishk (2003).[2][3] The film was a sleeper hit, and Kapoor's portrayal of a teenage student earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut.[4][5] He found little success in the next two years; all five of his releases, including the thriller Fida (2004) and the drama Shikhar (2005), were commercial failures.[6]\n\nIn 2006, Kapoor starred opposite Kareena Kapoor in 36 China Town and Chup Chup Ke, and played a prospective groom opposite Amrita Rao in Vivah, a commercially successful family drama from director Sooraj Barjatya.[7][8] In the following year, he reunited with Kareena Kapoor in the romantic comedy Jab We Met, for which he received his first Best Actor nomination at Filmfare.[5] In 2009, Kapoor portrayed twin brothers, one with a lisp and the other with a stutter, in Vishal Bhardwaj's critically acclaimed thriller Kaminey.[9][10] He then appeared in a series of films which performed poorly at the box-office, including Mausam (2011) and Teri Meri Kahaani (2012).[11][12] The 2013 action-drama R... Rajkumar proved to be his first commercial success in four years.[13]\n\nIn 2014, Kapoor played the title character in Bhardwaj's Haider (2014), an adaptation of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet, winning the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[13][14][15] After serving as a talent judge on the dance reality show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Reloaded (2015), he played a rockstar addicted to drugs in Udta Punjab (2016), a crime drama about substance abuse, for which he won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor.[16][17] Kapoor's highest-grossing release came in 2018 with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's period drama Padmaavat, one of Indian cinema's biggest grossers, in which he portrayed the Rajput ruler Rawal Ratan Singh.[18][19] The following year, he played the title role of a disgruntled lover in Kabir Singh (2019), which proved to be his biggest commercial success as the sole male lead.[20] After a short hiatus, Kapoor starred in the Amazon Prime Video crime drama series Farzi (2023), which emerged as the most-watched Indian streaming series.[21] He had further commercial success in the romantic comedy Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya (2024).[22]\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nKey † Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 Dil To Pagal Hai Dancer Uncredited [1] 1999 Taal Dancer Uncredited [1] 2003 Ishq Vishk Rajiv Mathur [23] 2004 Fida Jai Malhotra [24] Dil Maange More Nikhil Mathur [25] 2005 Deewane Huye Paagal Karan Sharma [26] Vaah!
