        "text": "Shahid Kapoor, widely recognized as one of the finest actors in Hindi Cinema, continues to showcase his versatility across genres. Presently engrossed in the filming of Devaa alongside Roshan Andrews, Shahid Kapoor is poised for an impressive lineup in the upcoming years. As reported earlier, Kapoor has already committed to a high-budget film directed by Sachin Ravi, known for Avane Srimannarayana, in collaboration with producers Jackky and Vashu Bhagnani. Sources now reveal that Shahid Kapoor is in advanced discussions for a grand historical project.\n\nInsiders suggest that Kapoor is in talks with director Amit Rai, known for OMG 2, for a historical film centred around the life of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Described as an untitled epic, this project is anticipated to become one of the most expensive films in Indian Cinema. The aim is to pay tribute to the courageous warrior, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, on the grand canvas of the silver screen.\n\nWhile eagerly awaiting the release of Teri Baton Mein Aisa Uljha Jiya on February 9 2024, Shahid Kapoor is set to dive into the shooting of Devaa. Discussions are ongoing for several other films, with two prominent projects being the untitled high-scale entertainer with Sachin Ravi and the historical directorial venture by Amit Rai."
