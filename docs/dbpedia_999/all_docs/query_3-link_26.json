        "text": "This is a 1951 Lydia Lane article, where songstress and actress Dinah Shore talks about all sorts of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nBeauty is not a gift. It is something which can be worked for and developed. No one in Hollywood has proved this more effectively than Dinah Shore I told Dinah this when we lunched at Paramount where she is making a musical out of that old melodrama “Aaron Slick of Pumpkin Crick.”Oh! How I remember those dreadful photographs when I first started singing on the Eddie Cantor show,” Dinah said. Dinah has really changed a lot since those old days. I commented that it was encouraging to others to realize how it is possible for a person to completely do herself over.”\n\n“Did Hollywood help you a lot?” I asked. “Some of the changes I d always wanted, and some had to be made in order to make me more photogenic,’ Dinah said. “I was always self-conscious about the space between my teeth I never was able to have a smiling picture taken As soon as I could afford it I went to a dentist and had caps put on my front teeth. “And your hair is different, too ” “I think that’s made the biggest change of all. I had no talent for doing my hair. It was straight as a poker, and permanents in those days were very expensive and most of the time frizzle. So I used to part my hair in the middle and bring it straight back. But the studio hairdressers have taught me many different ways of wearing it.”\n\n“Your hair is naturally quite dark, isn’t it?” I asked. “When I first came to Hollywood, Warner Brothers had me lighten it, and I’ve stayed blond ever since. It photographs much better now.” I wanted to know more about the change that has taken place with Dinah. “It’s so easy to get an idea of yourself when you are growing up and stick to it,” Dinah said. “But there is nothing commendable about not changing your type. At school I liked all sports and used to think of myself as the sweater and skirt girl. But Hollywood has taught me I can be 20 types, and so can everybody else!”\n\nThe waitress brought Miss Shore’s broiled lamb chops and a green salad. “Do you have a weight problem?” I asked. “I used to,” Dinah said, “but I never seem to gain anymore, since I have trained myself not to eat too much. It’s over eating that does the damage. I have regular meals, but when there is something fattening, I take only one spoonful of it.” “How about exercise?” “If my belts seem tight, I do exercises every morning. But as soon as I reduce my waist, I lose interest.”\n\n“What exercises do do?” I wanted to know. you Dinah laughed. “They’re yours, Lydia. I sent for your leaflet on exercise years ago.” “Everyone wants to be successful,” I commented. “What do you consider the most valuable thing which has helped you get ahead.” . “Let me see,” Dinah said, “that requires some thought.” Her face brightened.\n\n“l tell you it’s something I learned from Eddie Cantor when he was my boss. One day I picked up a magazine and found someone else was getting credit for something I deserved. When Eddie saw how disturbed I was, he said “Did you ever go to a track meet and did you ever see a man win the four-forty who turned around to watch what the other fellow was doing? Just go ahead with your job the best you can, he said, and you’ll have no mite for jealousy or dis satisfaction. I think this is wonderful advice, and it’s so easy to follow.”\n\nThis is a 1951 Lydia Lane article, where actress Ava Gardner talks about how to apply lipstick and mascara. Enjoy!\n\nA top producer who has been associated with beauty for many years told me he considered Ava Gardner the most glamorous star in Hollywood. In hopes that she would confide some of her glamour tricks, I visited Ava at MGM where she is making a western about Texas. When I arrived, Ava and Clark Gable were playing a love scene. Mr. Gable, with a blood stained face, held Ava in his arms and said, “I’ve won my fight.” Ava replied, “You’ve won me too.” Their lips met. This scene had to be done again and again before Director Vincent Sherman was satisfied, but through it all, Ava’s mouth remained beautifully intact.\n\nLater I asked her, “How do you keep your lipstick from smearing?” Ava laughed, “It’s such a simple little trick. I think knowing how to apply lipstick in a neat outline so that it doesn’t smear is so important. It’s difficult not to have a messy or crooked line unless you use a lipstick brush. Of course every one is clumsy with it at first.”\n\n“In making an outline,” Ava continued, “follow your own mouth, accentuate it if necessary but don’t copy a shape because you like it on someone else it’s a sure way to look ridiculous.” “But you still haven’t told me why your lipstick didn’t smear,” I insisted. “Do you paint a sealer over it?” “No,” Ava said quickly, “I don’t go for that stuff. After I have put on a layer of lipstick, I powder it down well, apply another layer of lipstick, and then let it set a moment or two. Then I press a tissue over my lips.”\n\n“Are you also able to eat without your lipstick coming off?” “Oh, yes,” Ava answered. I asked Miss Gardner to tell me her pet peeve in others, so far as grooming is concerned. “I think the biggest mistake that a great many women make is to use too much make-up. I think covering your skin with layers of cake-type foundation makes you look older.. The lines which come into your face when you smile or frown stay there the rest of the day.”\n\n“What is your pet glamour trick?” “Glamour tricks are for special occasions,” Ava said thoughtfully. “When I’m really getting dressed up I love to do things with my eyes. I really go to town.” “Will you tell me about it?” Some beauties would guard this secret, but not our friend from North Carolina. “Well first I curl my lashes and if I’ve just had a shower, I brush them with powder to be sure they are dry. Powder also makes your lashes look thicker. Then I like to doe-eye effect with a line drawn close to the lashes. “I never use mascara on my lower lashes, it invariably comes off. I think colored lashes, those greens and blues, are dreadful.”\n\n“My first coat of mascara is put on very lightly,” Ava continued. “I don’t apply a second coat until this is dry. Very often you’ll see someone put mascara on with spit. A-side from being unsanitary, this is bad for the lashes because there is a harmful acid in saliva. Most of the time I brush downward on the back side too. For my final coat I have my brush real goopy. To finish, I cover my lid with blue or green eye shadow, and sometimes I scatter little gold flakes on top.”\n\n“But there is no use making a great fuss over your eyes if they are bloodshot or tired,” Ava added. “I have a bottle of eye drops that clear the whites almost instantly. And after I’ve been working under bright lights or on an outdoor set in the sun, my eyes are often tired. I’ve found a wonderful way of resting them. I keep a plastic eye pad in the ice box. The pad has a liquid inside which stays cool for ages. I lie down, place this over my lids and I can just feel the burning sensation go out of them.”\n\nThis is a 1951 Lydia Lane article, where Henry King talks about what he, as a veteran director, find beautiful in women. Enjoy!\n\nIt has been said that veteran Hollywood director Henry King has started more girls on their path to stardom than any other man in Hollywood. Here, I decided, is a man who knows women. I wanted to talk to him. When I visited Mr. King in his office at Twentieth Century Fox, I came quickly to the point.\n\n“Who do you consider the most beautiful woman you’ve ever known and why?” I asked white-haired Mr. King, who looked at me with surprised blue eyes. “You want me to name just one person?” I nodded yes. “But beauty is a relative thing,” he insisted. “Every woman at some time of her life has moments of great beauty moments when something in her soul sends out a transforming radiance. Beauty is as beauty does”\n\nTo make his point Mr. King continued, “Take Susan Hayward because she is the one who is freshest in my mind.” (Henry King has just finished directing Miss Hayward in ‘Bathsheba’). There is no question Susan is a beauty. She is good to look at under any and all conditions. In ‘I’d Climb the Highest Mountain she was a preacher’s wife. For a certain scene in the play Susan had to look unattractive and the make-up people were discussing what they could do to hide her beauty. But Susan had such a picture in her mind of defeat and bitterness that she was capable of losing her charm and beauty for that scene without make-up.”\n\nMr. King looked at me and smiled for he realized that he had made his point that beauty as well as ugliness comes from within. I asked another direct question, “What attracts you to a woman?” Mr. King’s eyes twinkled as he said, “It depends upon how close she is. Far away it’s her figure. As she comes closer, it’s her personality that intangible something which radiates in many ways. And when you look at beauty without it you toss it aside.”\n\nI wanted to know what trait in women he found most unattractive. “You can’t make me knock women, I love them.” Then after a thoughtful pause he said “I find it easy to keep away from a woman who is affected or artificial.”\n\n“You’ve known a great” many women,” I said. “Who stands out as your personality girl?” “There have been many.” Mr. King pointed to a large color photograph of one of his discoveries, Alice Faye. “There’s a girl with personality plus.” We chatted a bit about how different the standards of beauty beautiful woman today from the curvaceous figures of the Gay 90s.\n\n“Some critics feel that by streamlining her body a girl loses some of her sex appeal,” I remarked. “Sex may be different things for different people.” Mr. King said. “I have just been making tests of a little actress named Marilyn Monroe,” he replied. “Now she definitely does not have an old-fashioned figure she is streamlined … she is slender, but . . . ” Mr. King refused to state the obvious, for at the moment Marilyn Monroe is considered the pin-up sensation of Hollywood.\n\n“With streamlined living and with time saving devices in modern homes, women have more leisure than ever before.” Mr. King said. “They have more time to develop and more time for beauty.” Mr. King feels it is possible for every women to get herself cast in the part she wants to play in life. “An actress may desire to play a role,” he said, “but before she is handed the part she has to be able to sell her ability to be convincing that she is right for it.\n\n“A woman can’t just sit and wish for things. She has to acquire a technique to make her goal possible. Not every woman can be born beautiful but she can create the illusion of beauty.” “What actress of unconventional beauty has done this most successfully?” I wanted to know. On the wall opposite us was a colored poster of “Song of Bernadette.” Mr. King pointed to this portrait of Jennifer Jones. “I remember when Jennifer was first brought to me she was good looking but not pretty,” Mr. King said. “I made a test of her to see if she was capable of coordinating her body and her thinking. Not everyone can, you know. As she played the part, she became radiantly beautiful.\n\n“It’s my Job as a director to bring out potentialities,” Mr. King added. “You can’t get out of a bottle what isn’t in it and it’s a mistake for anyone to try to be something she isn’t. Any woman can become her own director and bring to the surface what is bidden beneath.”\n\nBONUS:\n\nThe following question has been asked of the four stars Mr. King named in this interview: “What is the most valuable beauty secret or glamour trick Hollywood has taught you?”\n\nMARILYN MONROE: “Hollywood made me voice conscious. When I made my first test I was amazed when I heard myself speak. I felt like running to the nearest voice coach. I started work immediately and have been grateful ever since.”\n\nJENNIFER JONES didn’t wish to be quoted but a close friend of hers told me, “I knew Jennifer before she made ‘The Song of Bernadette’ and while I thought she was a very sweet girl I used to long to tell her how to dress. But now, since she’s had studio designers dress her on the screen, she has developed a style sense.”\n\nSUSAN HAYWARD: “I was in a serious accident at the age of 5 k I was taken out of dancing school l and they thought perhaps 1 1 would be crippled for life. But after two years on crutches I was able to walk again. Not until I came to work in pictures did I take dancing again. I’m very grateful for this experience because the exercise makes me feel so alive. Anyone can dance at home with records as long as they remember to keep good posture.”\n\nALICE FAYE: “The most usable thing I learned in Hollywood was the secret of making up with subtlety. When I came from the New York stage I penciled my eyebrows and used too much make-up. After Hollywood taught me to be natural I not only looked better but I felt better too.”\n\nThis is a 1951 Lydia Lane article, where actress Ginger Rogers talks about all sorts of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nGinger Rogers met me at the door of her hilltop house with a freshly scrubbed face, and looking like a girl in a circular skirt and blouse. “How do you do it?” I asked her. Ginger looks more like a teen aged girl than a mature woman. Correct thinking and maintaining health, she told me, were her two beauty secrets. I told her what a friend had said about her. “Ginger and I are about the tame age,” the friend had said, but at the rate we are going in a few years I will look like her mother!”\n\nMiss Rogers laughed. She settled herself gracefully on the floor at the end of a low table. “How do you do It?” I asked. “How do you keep your youth?” “That’s not a simple question to answer,” Ginger said, offering me a cup of coffee from a blue and white wedge-wood coffee set. It was a foggy morning and we sat there seriously discussing why some people stay young longer than others. “Most important I think, is to watch your thinking.” Ginger advised. “There is nothing to tear you down faster than dwelling on something unpleasant, its destructive to carry trouble around with you. Have you ever seen a man who all his life walked with heavy pails in each hand? After a time he walks in that bent-over position even when he doesn’t have the buckets.”\n\n“I don’t carry problems with me. I try to leave the past behind, where it belongs. Often someone will ask me question about something which has happened a long time ago, and I honestly can’t remember.” “Does this mean not remembering birthdays?” I wanted to know. “I don’t think It’s necessary for anyone to be conditioned by the thought of age,” Ginger answered seriously. “I believe we are as young as we THINK.”\n\nWe talked about the dancing sequences which Ginger had put together from her pictures with Mr. Astaire. The film of dancing scenes covers a period of ten years, with a running time of nearly three hours. “It’s so interesting to sit there and see a girl grow into a woman,” Ginger said. “Seeing those dance scenes is just like having time run right in front of your eyes.”\n\nI commented how little Miss Rogers figure had changed with the years and asked, What’s the secret?” “Just what we’ve been talking about” Ginger said. “A person has a choice to keep a young body or to let it become aged. Formulate a desire and put it into action. After all, your hand moves because your thought made it.” “You mean you don’t do any exercises?” “No,” Ginger said quickly, “not the setting up kind, but I enjoy tennis.” “How about dieting?” “I eat only when I’m hungry and never more than I want. There is more to the mental side of dieting than the average person realizes.” Ginger Rogers hair is blond and healthy looking and I asked what she did about it. Ginger told me she washes it at home in a special shampoo bowl. “You know the kind which has the spray already attached. I think rinsing is most important, and I use the juice of one lemon before my final rinse.”\n\nIn answer to my question as to what type of shampoo she preferred, Ginger said, “I’ve used the same one for years, it has an oily base and I like the way it leaves my hair.” “What’s your favorite glamour trick?” “I do so little about these things, and I never spend a whole day grooming myself. When I’m not on a picture, I try to keep make-up off my face.” “How do you remove your make-up when you are working?” Miss Rogers confided she doesn’t go for creams but prefers a special liquid that had no chance of clogging her pores.\n\nThis is a 1951 Lydia Lane article, where actress Ann Sheridan talks about all sorts of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nAt a recent star studded opening, a veteran director looked at Ann Sheridan and murmured, “She has the best chassis in Hollywood.” How do you keep such a lovely figure?” I asked Ann a few days later as we were driving to visit a military hospital. ‘ Do you have to watch your diet?” “I’m a meat and potato girl” Ann confided. When I asked if she really meant potatoes, she said, “Yes. and bread too, plenty of it, I couldn’t live without it.” “Doesn’t it make you gain?” “That’s been my problem for years trying to gain weight,” Ann answered seriously.\n\n“After I had pneumonia in ’47 I was much too thin. No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get my weight back. It s dreadful to go day after day and never feel like eating that’s the way it was with me.” “But you look so wonderful now,” i told her. “What did you do.” ‘My doctor finally suggested I try vitamins, and that is all I needed,” Ann said. “I was so grateful to be able to enjoy food again. My weight went back to normal, and it always stays there now. It’s wonderful to be able to fill out my clothes again.”\n\nAnn was wearing a figure revealing black dress, a little hat with a veil and a beautiful mink stole. I told her how smart she looked, and we started talking about clothes. “Working in pictures has taught me a lot,” Ann said. “Hollywood designers are fabulously clever in concealing” your bad points, and playing up your good ones. I think every woman should consider her own problem first. She should flatter her figure rather than slavishly try to follow fashion.”\n\nAnother point about clothes Ann brought out was the importance of feeling comfortable in what you are wearing. “If you can’t move or walk gracefully in a dress, it’s no good,” Ann told me. “Recently I bought a beautiful suit. It doesn’t look tight, but binds across the shoulder, and I just never wear it.” As Ann reached across the dash board to pull out a lighter for her cigarette. I noticed how long and beautifully manicured her nails were.\n\n“How do you grow such long nails?” I asked eagerly. “I guess they are a gift,” Ann confided. “I just never have any trouble with them.” ”Who manicures them for you?” I persisted. “I do it myself,” was Ann’s reply. Answering my question, she told me that the job of manicuring nails is easily learned all it takes is a little practice. There are a few tricks, however, she assured me. “When I get a new bottle of finger nail polish, I leave the stopper out until it thickens,” Ann said. “I find it’s much easier to apply polish, and it looks so much better, if you start with a thick covering.”\n\n“Then I apply just one coat-stroking the polish down the center and once on each side. It’s a mistake to brush the nail more than once.” “You do a beautiful Job.” I told her. “The most flattering compliment I’ve ever had came once when I was in New York,” Ann said. “Sherman Billingsly asked me who did my nails, and when I told him I had done them myself, he said ‘it’s the most beautiful manicure I’ve ever seen. It was a wonderful compliment.” As we drove along, Ann sat more relaxed than most actresses. I asked if she had to work hard for this composure.\n\n“Frankly, no,” she replied. “Do you ever have any trouble sleeping? “I don’t know. Ann said, “but there was a time that I found sleeping difficult. Things were not going smoothly for me, and I just lay in my bed all night waiting for it to get light.” “Did you take sleeping pills?” “Definitely no,” Ann was emphatic. “I wasn’t going to get into that routine. I’ve always been very much against them. The way I cured my sleeping problem was to cure my mental problem. It’s easy to sleep if you can find a way to forget the care of the day.”\n\nThis is a 1951 Lydia Lane article, where actress Marlene Dietrich talks about all sorts of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nWhen, you think of Marlene Dietrich, you, usually think of a very, glamorous j woman who is not only a top screen star, but is also a grandmother. I wanted to find out how mature Miss Dietrich remained one of America’ most beautiful women. ! When I arrived on the “Chuck- Luck” set, a scene with Marlene i Dietrich and Mel Ferrer was being filmed. She play the part of an ex-dance hall girl turned ranch owner and was wearing suede breeches which fit tight enough to reveal the lines of her beautiful body.\n\nWhile a quick change was made, I chatted with Hal Mohr, ace camerman, who photographed Miss Dietrich 12 years ago. “It’s extraordinary,” he said. “She hasn’t aged a day.” Later, In Miss Dietrich’s dressing room, I told her I had a compliment for her and repeated what Mr. Mohr had said. Not a muscle in her face changed. After a significant silence she said in her wonderfully deep voice, “So Hal doesn’t think I look any different and neither does he.” Her blue eyes looked at me quizzically, “What do people expect to see? They shouldn’t make so much of this.”\n\n“I don’t think most people change much in 10 years. If they would look at their old snapshots I think they’d find they seem very much the same.” Blue, Angel, which starred Miss Dietrich about 20 years ago, recently was put into a new release and here one saw a plump German girl not a fraction as attractive as the mature Marlene. I asked Miss Dietrich how she keeps such a beautiful figure. “There is nothing to tell,” she replied. “I eat what I want, but I just don’t have craving for food which is bad,”\n\n“But you are so much thinner now than when you first came to Hollywood,” I persisted. Miss Dietrich agreed. “But I don’t think food is entirely responsible for that. Fat is caused by many things: metabolism, emotions. I do not know a great deal about this, but I think they must influence the way the body burns up food.” Miss Dietrich has been on the list of the best-dressed women of the world many times and we chatted a bit about clothes. “We all follow fashion to a certain extent,” she commenced, “we have to. But it is best to dress our individuality.” To illustrate this point. Miss Dietrich told me, “I never wear colors.” She explained she felt better dressed in back, navy, blue, white, gray or beige.\n\n“Do you feel that a person has to be born with a style sense?” Marlene answered that she felt It can be developed. As we sat in her dressing room, I became aware of a delightful fragrance and I asked the glamorous Marlene if she was fickle about perfume. “No, she said, “I wear one scent.” This she uses in an atomizer to spray on clothes and skin. She said a woman should try a number of different scents until just the right one was found. “What is your favorite cosmetic or beauty preparation?” I asked. Miss Dietrich said that it was baby oil, which she had used for years to remove her make-up. “And I never use paper on my face,’ she said. Paper, Miss Dietrich explained, was too smooth, and that she prefers the friction of a Turkish towel."
