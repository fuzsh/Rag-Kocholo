        "text": "When people gave Louis Malle credit for making a star of Jeanne Moreau in Fahrstuhl zum Schafott (1958) immediately followed by Die Liebenden (1958), he would point out that Moreau by that time had already been \"recognized as the prime stage actress of her generation.\" She had made it to the Comédie Française in her 20s. She had appeared in B-movie thrillers with Jean Gabin and Ascenseur was in that genre. The technicians at the film lab went to the producer after seeing the first week of dailies for Ascenseur and said: \"You must not let Malle destroy Jeanne Moreau\". Malle explained: \"She was lit only by the windows of the Champs Elysées. That had never been done. Cameramen would have forced her to wear a lot of make-up and they would put a lot of light on her, because, supposedly, her face was not photogenic\". This lack of artifice revealed Moreau's \"essential qualities: she could be almost ugly and then ten seconds later she would turn her face and would be incredibly attractive. But she would be herself\".\n\nMoreau has told interviewers that the characters she played were not her. But even the most famous film critic of his generation, Roger Ebert, thinks that she is a lot like her most enduring role, Catherine in François Truffaut's Jules und Jim (1962). Behind those eyes and that enigmatic smile is a woman with a mind. In a review of The Clothes in the Wardrobe (1993) Ebert wrote: \"Jeanne Moreau has been a treasure of the movies for 35 years... Here, playing a flamboyant woman who nevertheless keeps her real thoughts closely guarded, she brings about a final scene of poetic justice as perfect as it is unexpected\".\n\nMoreau made her debut as a director in Im Scheinwerferlicht (1976) -- also writing the script and playing Sarah, an actress the same age as Moreau whose romances are often with directors for the duration of making a film. She made several films with Malle.\n\nStill active in international cinema, Moreau presided over the jury of the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.\n\nSophia Loren was born as Sofia Scicolone at the Clinica Regina Margherita in Rome on September 20, 1934. Her father Riccardo was married to another woman and refused to marry her mother Romilda Villani, despite the fact that she was the mother of his two children (Sophia and her younger sister Maria Scicolone). Growing up in the slums of Pozzuoli during the second World War without any support from her father, she experienced great sadness in her childhood. Her life took an unexpected turn for the best when, at age 14, she entered into a beauty contest and placed as one of the finalists. It was here that Sophia caught the attention of film producer Carlo Ponti, some 22 years her senior, whom she later married. Perhaps he was the father figure she never experienced as a child. Under his guidance, Sophia was put under contract and appeared as an extra in ten films beginning with Le sei mogli di Barbablù (1950), before working her way up to supporting roles. In these early films, she was credited as \"Sofia Lazzaro\" because people joked her beauty could raise Lazzarus from the dead.\n\nBy her late teens, Sophia was playing lead roles in many Italian features such as La favorita (1952) and Aida (1953). In 1957, she embarked on a successful acting career in the United States, starring in Der Knabe auf dem Delphin (1957), Die Stadt der Verlorenen (1957), and Stolz und Leidenschaft (1957) that year. She had a short-lived but much-publicized fling with co-star Cary Grant, who was nearly 31 years her senior. She was only 22 while he was 53, and she rejected a marriage proposal from him. They were paired together a second time in the family-friendly romantic comedy Hausboot (1958). While under contract to Paramount, Sophia starred in Begierde unter Ulmen (1958), Der Schlüssel (1958), Die schwarze Orchidee (1958), Es Begann in Neapel (1960), Die Dame und der Killer (1960), Prinzessin Olympia (1960), and Die Millionärin (1960) before returning to Italy to star in ...und dennoch leben sie (1960). The film was a period piece about a woman living in war-torn Italy who is raped while trying to protect her young daughter. Originally cast as the more glamorous child, Sophia fought against type and was re-cast as the mother, displaying a lack of vanity and proving herself as a genuine actress. This performance received international acclaim and was honored with an Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nSophia remained a bona fide international movie star throughout the sixties and seventies, making films on both sides of the Atlantic, and starring opposite such leading men as Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Gregory Peck, and Charlton Heston. Her English-language films included El Cid (1961), Der Untergang des Römischen Reiches (1964), Arabeske (1966), Der Mann von La Mancha (1972), and Treffpunkt Todesbrücke (1976). She gained wider respect with her Italian films, especially Hochzeit auf italienisch (1964) and Ein besonderer Tag (1977), both of which co-starred Marcello Mastroianni. During these years she received a second Oscar nomination and won five Golden Globe Awards.\n\nFrom the eighties onward, Sophia's appearances on the big screen came few and far between. She preferred to spend the majority of her time raising sons Carlo Ponti Jr. (b. 1968) and Edoardo Ponti (b. 1973). Her only acting credits during the decade were five television films, beginning with Sophia Loren - Mein Leben (1980), a biopic in which she portrayed herself and her mother. She ventured into other areas of business and became the first actress to launch her own fragrance and design of eyewear. In 1982 she voluntarily spent nineteen days in jail for tax evasion.\n\nIn 1991 Sophia received an Honorary Academy Award for her body of work, and was declared \"one of world cinema's greatest treasures.\" That same year, she experienced a terrible loss when her mother died of cancer. Her return to mainstream films in Prêt-à-Porter (1994) was well-received, although the film as a whole was not. She followed this up with her biggest U.S. hit in years, the comedy Der dritte Frühling (1995), in which she played a sexy divorcée who seduces Walter Matthau. Over the next decade Sophia had plum roles in a few independent films like Soleil (1997), Zwischen Fremden (2002) (directed by Edoardo), and Lives of the Saints (2004). Still beautiful at 72, she posed scantily-clad for the 2007 Pirelli Calendar. Sadly, that same year she mourned the death of her 94-year-old spouse, Carlo Ponti. In 2009, after far too much time away from film, she appeared in the musical Nine (2009) opposite Daniel Day-Lewis. These days Sophia is based in Switzerland but frequently travels to the states to spend time with her sons and their families (Eduardo is married to actress Sasha Alexander). Sophia Loren remains one of the most beloved and recognizable figures in the international film world.\n\nAudrey Hepburn was born as Audrey Kathleen Ruston on May 4, 1929 in Ixelles, Brussels, Belgium. Her mother, Baroness Ella Van Heemstra, was a Dutch noblewoman. Her father, Joseph Victor Anthony Ruston, was a businessman and Honorary British Consul in the Dutch East Indies; he was born in Úzice, Bohemia, of English, Austrian, and Czech-Jewish descent.\n\nAfter her parents' divorce, Audrey went to London with her mother where she went to a private girls school. Later, when her mother moved back to the Netherlands, she attended private schools as well. While she vacationed with her mother in Arnhem, Netherlands, Hitler's army took over the town. It was here that she fell on hard times during the Nazi occupation. Audrey suffered from depression and malnutrition.\n\nAfter the liberation, she went to a ballet school in London on a scholarship and later began a modeling career. As a model, she was graceful and, it seemed, she had found her niche in life--until the film producers came calling. In 1948, after being spotted modeling by a producer, she was signed to a bit part in the European film Nederlands in zeven lessen (1948). Later, she had a speaking role in the 1951 film, Mit Küchenbenutzung (1951) as Eve Lester. The part still wasn't much, so she headed to America to try her luck there. Audrey gained immediate prominence in the US with her role in Ein Herz und eine Krone (1953). This film turned out to be a smashing success, and she won an Oscar as Best Actress.\n\nOn September 25, 1954, she married actor Mel Ferrer. She also starred in Sabrina (1954), for which she received another Academy Award nomination. She starred in the films Ein süßer Fratz (1957) and Ariane - Liebe am Nachmittag (1957). She received yet another Academy Award nomination for her role in Geschichte einer Nonne (1959). On July 17, 1960, she gave birth to her first son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer.\n\nAudrey reached the pinnacle of her career when she played Holly Golightly in Frühstück bei Tiffany (1961), for which she received another Oscar nomination. She scored commercial success again playing Regina Lampert in the espionage caper Charade (1963). One of Audrey's most radiant roles was in the fine production of My Fair Lady (1964). After a couple of other movies, most notably Zwei auf gleichem Weg (1967), she hit pay dirt and another nomination in Warte, bis es dunkel ist (1967).\n\nIn 1967, Audrey decided to retire from acting while she was on top. She divorced from Mel Ferrer in 1968. On January 19, 1969, she married Dr. Andrea Dotti. On February 8, 1970, she gave birth to her second son, Luca Dotti in Lausanne, Vaud, Switzerland. From time to time, she would appear on the silver screen.\n\nIn 1988, she became a special ambassador to the United Nations UNICEF fund helping children in Latin America and Africa, a position she retained until 1993. She was named to People's magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world. Her last film was Always - Der Feuerengel von Montana (1989).\n\nAudrey Hepburn died, aged 63, on January 20, 1993 in Tolochnaz, Vaud, Switzerland, from appendicular cancer. She had made a total of 31 high quality movies. Her elegance and style will always be remembered in film history as evidenced by her being named in Empire magazine's \"The Top 100 Movie Stars of All Time\".\n\nBorn in Namegata, Ibaraki Prefecture in 1931, Kagawa Kyoko (also Makino Kyoko) has endured through the golden age of Japanese cinema, into the end of the century and onto the new to act in many of the more important films from her native country. Growing up she had aspired to learn English and then to become a ballerina after watching Swan Lake, but fate and a beauty contest sponsored by The Tokyo Shimbun newspaper intervened and cast her into the role of an actress. She began her career at the defunct Shintoho Studio in 1949. Films like Tokyo Story, Sansho The Bailiff and High And Low directed respectively by Ozu, Yasujiro, Mizoguchi, Kenji and Kurosawa, Akira have captured and immortalized her. She married and moved to New York City, USA with her husband, a reporter, and child for three years in 1965. She went through a couple of dry spells mid-career when roles had vanished, one of which lasted three years and was broken when a call came from Kurosawa to work on Maadadayo. It was the first time the actress and director worked together in 28 years. Kagawa won a Japanese Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the film. She was awarded a Japanese Medal With Purple Ribbon in 1998 for her contribution to Japanese life and arts. She was the subject of a film perspective at the Tokyo International Film Festival and Japan's National Film Centre in 2011. She also received an award in the same year from The International Federation Of Film Archives for her movie preservation effort. She was the first Japanese actor to receive this prize. She has done commercial work in the '70s and '80s (House Foods) and more recently for Lawson stores and Kirin Brewery. Overall she has a dozen awards, a couple of books and even a music single to her credit.\n\nKatharine Houghton Hepburn was born on May 12, 1907 in Hartford, Connecticut to a suffragist, Katharine Martha (Houghton), and a doctor, Thomas Norval Hepburn, who both always encouraged her to speak her mind, develop it fully, and exercise her body to its full potential. An athletic tomboy as a child, she was very close to her brother Tom; at 14 she was devastated to find him dead, the apparent result of accidentally hanging himself while practicing a hanging trick their father had taught them. For many years afterward, she used his November 8 birth date as her own. She became shy around girls her age and was largely schooled at home. She did attend Bryn Mawr College, where she decided to become an actress, appearing in many of their productions.\n\nAfter graduating, she began getting small roles in plays on Broadway and elsewhere. She always attracted attention, especially for her role in \"Art and Mrs. Bottle\" (1931). She finally broke into stardom when she took the starring role of the Amazon princess Antiope in \"A Warrior's Husband\" (1932). The inevitable film offers followed; after making a few screen tests, she was cast in Eine Scheidung (1932), opposite John Barrymore. The film was a hit, and after agreeing to her salary demands, RKO signed her to a contract. She made five films between 1932 and 1934. For her third, Morgenrot des Ruhms (1933), she won her first Academy Award. Her fourth, Vier Schwestern (1933), was the most successful picture of its day.\n\nBut stories were beginning to leak out, of her haughty behavior off- screen and her refusal to play the Hollywood Game, always wearing slacks and no makeup, never posing for pictures or giving interviews. Audiences were shocked at her unconventional behavior instead of applauding it, and so when she returned to Broadway in 1934 to star in \"The Lake\", the critics panned her, and the audiences, who at first bought up tickets, soon deserted her. When she returned to Hollywood, things didn't get much better. From 1935-1938, she had only two hits: Alice Adams (1935), which brought her her second Oscar nomination, and Bühneneingang (1937); the many flops included Break of Hearts (1935), Sylvia Scarlett (1935), Maria von Schottland (1936), Quality Street (1937), and the now-classic Leoparden küßt man nicht (1938).\n\nWith so many flops, she came to be labeled \"box-office poison\". She decided to go back to Broadway to star in \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1938) and was rewarded with a smash. She quickly bought the film rights and so was able to negotiate her way back to Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. Die Nacht vor der Hochzeit (1940) was a box-office hit, and Hepburn, who won her third Oscar nomination for the film, was bankable again. For her next film, Die Frau von der man spricht (1942), she was paired with Spencer Tracy, and the chemistry between them lasted for eight more films, spanning the course of 25 years, and a romance that lasted that long off-screen. (She received her fourth Oscar nomination for the film.) Their films included the very successful Ehekrieg (1949), Pat und Mike (1952), and Eine Frau, die alles weiß (1957).\n\nWith African Queen (1951), Hepburn moved into middle-aged spinster roles, receiving her fifth Oscar nomination for the film. She played more of these types of roles throughout the 1950s, and won more Oscar nominations for many of them, including her roles in Traum meines Lebens (1955), Der Regenmacher (1956), and Plötzlich im letzten Sommer (1959). Her film roles became fewer and farther between in the 1960s, as she devoted her time to the ailing Tracy. For one of her film appearances in this decade, in Long Day's Journey Into Night (1962), she received her ninth Oscar nomination. After a five-year absence from films, she then made Rat mal, wer zum Essen kommt (1967), her last film with Tracy and the last film Tracy ever made; he died just weeks after finishing it. It garnered Hepburn her tenth Oscar nomination and her second win. The next year, she did Der Löwe im Winter (1968), which brought her her eleventh Oscar nomination and third win.\n\nIn the 1970s, she turned to making made-for-TV films, with Die Glasmenagerie (1973), Liebe in der Dämmerung (1975), and Das Korn ist grün (1979). She still continued to make an occasional appearance in feature films, such as Mit Dynamit und frommen Sprüchen (1975) with John Wayne and Am goldenen See (1981) with Henry Fonda. This last brought her her twelfth Oscar nomination and fourth win - the latter still the record.\n\nShe made more TV-films in the 1980s and wrote her autobiography, 'Me', in 1991. Her last feature film was Perfect Love Affair (1994), with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, and her last TV- film was Eine Weihnacht (1994). With her health declining, she retired from public life in the mid-1990s. She died at 96 at her home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut.\n\nShirley MacLaine was born Shirley MacLean Beaty in Richmond, Virginia. Her mother, Kathlyn Corinne (MacLean), was a drama teacher from Nova Scotia, Canada, and her father, Ira Owens Beaty, a professor of psychology and real estate agent, was from Virginia. Her brother, Warren Beatty, was born on March 30, 1937. Her ancestry includes English and Scottish.\n\nShirley was the tallest in her ballet classes at the Washington School of Ballet. Just after she graduated from Washington-Lee High School, she packed her bags and headed for New York. While auditioning for Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's \"Me and Juliet\", the producer kept mispronouncing her name. She then changed her name from Shirley MacLean Beaty to Shirley MacLaine. She later had a role in \"The Pajama Game\", as a member of the chorus and understudy to Carol Haney. A few months into the run, Shirley was going to leave the show for the lead role in \"Can-Can\" but ended up filling in for Haney, who had broken her ankle and could not perform. She would fill in for Carol, again, three months later, following another injury, the very night that movie producer Hal B. Wallis was in the audience. Wallis signed MacLaine to a five-year contract to Paramount Pictures. Three months later, she was off to shoot Immer Ärger mit Harry (1955). She then took roles in Hitzewelle (1958) and In 80 Tagen um die Welt (1956), completed not too long before her daughter, Sachi Parker (born Stephanie), was born. With Shirley's career on track, she played one of her most challenging roles: \"Ginny Moorhead\" in Verdammt sind sie alle (1958), for which she received her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. She went on to do In Colorado ist der Teufel los (1958) and Die Heiratsvermittlerin (1958). In 1960, she got her second Academy Award nomination for Das Appartement (1960). Three years later, she received a third nomination for Das Mädchen Irma la Douce (1963). In 1969, she brought her friend Bob Fosse from Broadway to direct her in Sweet Charity (1969), from which she got her \"signature\" song, \"If My Friends Could See Me Now\". After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made a documentary on China called The Other Half of the Sky: A China Memoir (1975), for which she received an Oscar nomination for best documentary.\n\nIn 1977, she got her fourth Best Actress Oscar nomination for Am Wendepunkt (1977). In 1979, she worked with Peter Sellers in Willkommen, Mr. Chance (1979), made shortly before his death. After 20 years in the film industry, she finally took home the Best Actress Oscar for Zeit der Zärtlichkeit (1983). After a five-year hiatus, Shirley made Madame Sousatzka (1988), a critical and financial hit that took top prize at the Venice Film Festival. In 1989, she starred with Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts in Magnolien aus Stahl - Die Stärke der Frauen (1989). She received rave reviews playing Meryl Streep's mother in Grüße aus Hollywood (1990) and for Tess und ihr Bodyguard (1994). In 1996, she reprised her role from \"Terms of Endearment\" as \"Aurora Greenway\" in Jahre der Zärtlichkeit (1996), which didn't repeat its predecessor's success at the box office. In mid-1998, she directed Bruno (2000), which starred Alex D. Linz. In February 2001, Shirley worked with close friends once again in These Old Broads (2001), and co-starred with Julia Stiles in Carolina - Auf der Suche nach Mr. Perfect (2003) and with Kirstie Alley in Salem Witch Trials (2002).\n\nMacLaine as her own website which includes her own radio show and interviews, the Encounter Board, and Independent Expression, a members-only section of the site. In the past few years, Shirley starred in a CBS miniseries based on the life of cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash--Hell on Heels: The Battle of Mary Kay (2002), and wrote two more books, \"The Camino\" in 2001, and \"Out On A Leash\" in 2003. After taking a slight hiatus from motion pictures, Shirley returned with roles in the movies that were small, but wonderfully scene-stealing: Verliebt in eine Hexe (2005) with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell, In den Schuhen meiner Schwester (2005) with Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette, in which Shirley was nominated for a Golden Globe in the best supporting actress category, and Wo die Liebe hinfällt... (2005) with Jennifer Aniston and Kevin Costner. Shirley completed filming of Closing the Ring (2007), directed by Sir Richard Attenborough, in 2007. Her latest book is entitled \"Sage-ing While Ag-ing\"; Shirley's latest film is Valentinstag (2010), which debuted in theaters on February 12, 2010.\n\nAnastasia Vertinskaya is a popular Russian actress and public figure best known for her roles as Assol in Das purpurrote Segel (1961) and Ophelia in Hamlet (1964).\n\nShe was born Anastasia Aleksandrovna Vertinskaya on December 19, 1944, in Moscow, Russia, Soviet Union (now Moscow, Russia). Her father, Aleksandr Vertinskiy, was a famous Russian actor, singer and songwriter, who returned from his emigration in China to Moscow during the Second World War. Her mother, Lidiya Vertinskaya (née Lidia Vladimirovna Tsirgvava), was also a Russian émigré who was born into a Georgian-Russian family in Kharbin, and her older sister, Marianna Vertinskaya, was born in 1943, in Shanghai, China. Young Anastasia Vertinskaya had a happy childhood together with her sister Marianna. She was brought up in a multi-lingual family where she enjoyed an intellectually stimulating environment, and a highly cultural atmosphere of her parents circle. Anastasia Vertinskaya was fond of her father, who invested much of his talent and energy in his daughter's education. Her famous father died when Anastasia Vertinskaya was 14, and she suffered from emotional trauma that cast influence on her most important roles in film, that she played at the age of 15 to 19, such as Assol, Gutierre, and Ophelia.\n\nIn 1961, at age 15, Vertinskaya made her film debut starring as love-torn Assol who has a dream about her hero, Vasiliy Lanovoy. She became an instant celebrity in the Soviet Union with her first film, Das purpurrote Segel (1961), by director Aleksandr Ptushko, a popular adaptation of the eponymous book by Alexander Grin. Next year she co-starred as Gutierre in Der Amphibienmensch (1961) Vertinskaya shot to international fame starring as Ophelia opposite Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy in Hamlet (1964), by director Grigoriy Kozintsev. Meanwhile, she attended the Shchukin Theatrical School, graduating in 1967, as an actress. She played supporting roles as Lisa Bolkonskaya in Die grosse Liebe der Natascha (1965), by director Sergey Bondarchuk and as Kitty in Anna Karenina (1967), by director Aleksandr Zarkhi. She also starred as Margarita in Master i Margarita (2006), an adaptation of the eponymous book by Mikhail A. Bulgakov.\n\nAnastasiya Vertinskaya was member of several theatrical companies in Moscow, such as Theatre of Vakhtangov, Taganka, Theatre Sovremennik, Pushkin Theatre, and Moscow Art Theatre (MKhAT). Her most acclaimed stage appearances were as Nina in 'The Seagull' and as Elena in 'Uncle Vanya', both plays by Anton Chekhov. In a unique theatrical experiment by director Anatoli Efros at Taganka, she appeared in two roles: as Prospero and Ariel in the Shakespeare's Tempest. In 1989 she portrayed her father, Aleksandr Vertinskiy, in a show that she also wrote and directed to mark the centennial birthday anniversary of her father.\n\nOutside of her film career A. Vertinskaya taught acting in Oxford and in the European film school in Switzerland; she also held a master class at Comédie-Française (Théâtre de la Républic) and at Chekhov's school in Paris. She was designated People's Actress of Russia. Since 1991 Anastasiya Vertinskaya has been running the Charitable Foundation for Actors, which supports such cultural landmarks as the home of Boris Pasternak and the museum of Anton Chekhov as well as many other cultural projects and individual actors and filmmakers. During the 1990s she completed restoration of her father's historic recordings for a CD release. Anastasiya Vertinskaya was married to director Nikita Mikhalkov and their son, Stepan Mikhalkov, is also a filmmaker.\n\nOver the course of a five-decade career, she starred in nearly 150 films. She is a three-time César Award winner (1977, 1996, 2002), a two-time Molière Award winner, a BAFTA nominee, and a recipient of several international prizes including the Volpi Cup (Best actress) at the 1965 Venice Film Festival for Three Rooms in Manhattan.\n\nBorn in 1931, she was raised by her single mother, a midwife from Normandy. After studying to become a midwife like her mother, she enrolled at the prestigious Conservatoire de la rue Blanche in Paris. After graduating in 1954 with the \"First Prize in Modern and Classical Comedy\", she joined the Comédie Française, where she was a resident actor from 1954-57.\n\nIn 1955, she began her film career, making her film debut in Treize à table (1955), but it was with theatre that she started to attract the attention of critics. Her performance in Jean Cocteau's play La Machine à écrire in 1956 was admired by the author who called her \"The finest dramatic temperament of the Postwar period\"\n\nIn 1956 she was awarded the Prix Suzanne Bianchetti as best up-and-coming young actress but only with Luchino Visconti's epic Rocco und seine Brüder (1960), she was able to draw the public's attention to her. In 1962, she married Italian actor Renato Salvatori. Travelling back and forth between two film careers in France and Italy, Girardot also worked with renown Italian directors, including Marco Ferreri in the scandalous La donna scimmia (1964).\n\nFamously ignored by French New Wave directors (with the exception of Claude Lelouch), Girardot found her glory in popular cinema alongside more established and traditional directors such as Jean Delannoy, Michel Boisrond, André Cayatte, Gilles Grangier, or André Hunebelle.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, she had become a movie star and a box-office magnet in France with such films as Laster und Tugend (1963); Lebe das Leben (1967); Der Mann, der mir gefällt (1969); and Death of Love (1970), the fact-based tale of a middle-aged teacher whose affair with a much younger student made her the object of bourgeoisie ridicule. The film was nominated for a Golden Globe, and remains Girardot's biggest box office hit in France.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Girardot came back and forth between drama and comedy, proving herself an adept comedienne in such successful comedies as Claude Zidi's Der Querkopf (1978), Michel Audiard's _Elle boit pas, elle fume pas, elle drague pas, mais... elle cause! (1970)_ and Philippe de Broca's Ein verrücktes Huhn (1977). She also played the mother of upcoming stars like Isabelle Adjani in the hit teen movie Die Ohrfeige (1974), and Isabelle Huppert in the drama Dr. med. Françoise Gailland (1976).\n\nThe 1980s were less kind, as her film career floundered and parts dwindled. However, Girardot had a major comeback on the big screen playing a peasant wife in Claude Lelouch's Les Misérables (1995).\n\nRuth Elizabeth Davis was born April 5, 1908, in Lowell, Massachusetts, to Ruth Augusta (Favor) and Harlow Morrell Davis, a patent attorney. Her parents divorced when she was 10. She and her sister were raised by their mother. Her early interest was dance. To Bette, dancers led a glamorous life, but then she discovered the stage, and gave up dancing for acting. To her, it presented much more of a challenge.\n\nAfter graduation from Cushing Academy, she was refused admittance to Eva Le Gallienne's Manhattan Civic Repertory. She enrolled in John Murray Anderson's Dramatic School and was the star pupil. She was in the off-Broadway play \"The Earth Between\" (1923), and her Broadway debut in 1929 was in \"Broken Dishes\". She also appeared in \"Solid South\". Late in 1930, she was hired by Universal, where she made her first film, called Bad Sister (1931). When she arrived in Hollywood, the studio representative who went to meet her train left without her because he could find no one who looked like a movie star. An official at Universal complained she had \"as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville\" and her performance in \"Bad Sister\" didn't impress.\n\nIn 1932, she signed a seven-year deal with Warner Brothers Pictures. Her first film with them was The Man Who Played God (1932). She became a star after this appearance, known as the actress that could play a variety of very strong and complex roles. More fairly successful movies followed, but it was the role of Mildred Rogers in RKO's Human Bondage (1934) that would give Bette major acclaim from the film critics. She had a significant number of write-in votes for the Best Actress Oscar, but didn't win. Warner Bros. felt their seven-year deal with Bette was more than justified. They had a genuine star on their hands. With this success under her belt, she began pushing for stronger and more meaningful roles. In 1935, she received her first Oscar for her role in Gefährliche Liebe (1935) as Joyce Heath.\n\nIn 1936, she was suspended without pay for turning down a role that she deemed unworthy of her talent. She went to England, where she had planned to make movies, but was stopped by Warner Bros. because she was still under contract to them. They did not want her to work anywhere. Although she sued to get out of her contract, she lost. Still, they began to take her more seriously after that.\n\nReturning after losing her lawsuit, her roles improved dramatically. In 1938, Bette received a second Academy Award win for her work in Jezebel - die boshafte Lady (1938) opposite the soon-to-be-legendary Henry Fonda. The only role she didn't get that she wanted was Scarlett O'Hara in Vom Winde verweht (1939). Warners wouldn't loan her to David O. Selznick unless he hired Errol Flynn to play Rhett Butler, which both Selznick and Davis thought was a terrible choice. It was rumored she had numerous affairs, among them George Brent and William Wyler, and she was married four times, three of which ended in divorce. She admitted her career always came first.\n\nShe made many successful films in the 1940s, but each picture was weaker than the last and by the time her Warner Brothers contract had ended in 1949, she had been reduced to appearing in such films as the unintentionally hilarious Der Stachel des Bösen (1949). She made a huge comeback in 1950 when she replaced an ill Claudette Colbert in, and received an Oscar nomination for, Alles über Eva (1950). She worked in films through the 1950s, but her career eventually came to a standstill, and in 1961 she placed a now famous Job Wanted ad in the trade papers.\n\nShe received an Oscar nomination for her role as a demented former child star in Was geschah wirklich mit Baby Jane? (1962). This brought about a new round of super-stardom for generations of fans who were not familiar with her work. Two years later, she starred in Wiegenlied für eine Leiche (1964). Bette was married four times.\n\nIn 1977 she received the AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award and in 1979 she won a Best Actress Emmy for Heimkehr einer Fremden (1979). In 1977-78 she moved from Connecticut to Los Angeles and filmed a pilot for the series Hotel (1983), which she called Brothel. She refused to do the TV series and suffered a stroke during this time.\n\nHer last marriage, to actor Gary Merrill, lasted ten years, longer than any of the previous three. In 1985, her daughter Barbara Davis (\"B.D.\") Hyman published a scandalous book about Bette called \"My Mother's Keeper.\" Bette worked in the later 1980s in films and TV, even though a stroke had impaired her appearance and mobility. She wrote a book, \"This 'N That\", during her recovery from the stroke. Her last book was \"Bette Davis, The Lonely Life\", issued in paperback in 1990. It included an update from 1962 to 1989. She wrote the last chapter in San Sebastian, Spain.\n\nSadly, Bette Davis died on October 6, 1989, of metastasized breast cancer, in Neuilly-sur-Seine, Hauts-de-Seine, France. Many of her fans refused to believe she was gone.\n\nAnne Bancroft was born on September 17, 1931 in The Bronx, NY, the middle daughter of Michael Italiano (1905-2001), a dress pattern maker, and Mildred DiNapoli (1907-2010), a telephone operator. She made her cinema debut in Versuchung auf 809 (1952) in 1952, and over the next five years appeared in a lot of undistinguished movies such as Der Würger von Coney Island (1954), Die Gladiatoren (1954), Pantherkatze (1955), Wenn die Nacht anbricht (1956) and Das Mädchen mit den schwarzen Strümpfen (1957). By 1957 she grew dissatisfied with the scripts she was getting, left the film business and spent the next five years doing plays on Broadway. She returned to screens in 1962 with her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in Licht im Dunkel (1962), for which she won an Oscar. Bancroft went on to give acclaimed performances in Schlafzimmerstreit (1964), Stimme am Telefon (1965), Der junge Löwe (1972), Das Nervenbündel (1975), Der Elefantenmensch (1980), Sein oder Nichtsein (1983), Zwischen den Zeilen (1987) and other movies, but her most famous role would be as Mrs. Robinson in Die Reifeprüfung (1967). Her status as the \"older woman\" in the film is iconic, although in real life she was only eight years older than Katharine Ross and just six years older than Dustin Hoffman. Bancroft would later express her frustration over the fact that the film overshadowed her other work. Selective for much of her intermittent career, she appeared onscreen more frequently in the '90s and early '00s, playing a range of characters in such films as Love Potion No. 9 - Der Duft der Liebe (1992), Codename - Nina (1993), Familienfeste und andere Schwierigkeiten (1995), Die Akte Jane (1997), Große Erwartungen (1998), Glauben ist alles! (2000) and Die Villa (2000). She also started to make some TV films, including Deep in My Heart (1999) for which she won an Emmy. Sadly, on June 6, 2005, Bancroft passed away at the age of 73 from uterine cancer. Her death surprised many, as she had not disclosed her illness to the public. Among her survivors was her husband of 41 years, Mel Brooks, and their son Max Brooks, who was born in 1972. Her final film, the animated feature Delgo (2008), was released posthumously in 2008 and dedicated to her memory."
