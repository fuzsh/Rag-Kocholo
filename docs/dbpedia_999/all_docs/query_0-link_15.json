        "text": "Centuries before the first white settlers crossed the Appalachian Mountains, several famous Native American tribes had passed through the area. Indians such as the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, and the Shawnee all occupied the local banks of the Cumberland River at different points in time. French-Canadian fur traders then eventually traveled to the region in the 1710s, establishing a remote outpost that they named “French Lick.” (Not to be confused with French Lick, Indiana). Settlement by individuals of European origin remained sparse until the eve of the American Revolution, when a North Carolinian jurist named Richard Henderson formally acquired most of the locale in 1775. He had specifically been given the territory from the Cherokee through the historic Transylvania Purchase. While Henderson never lived in the area, he largely directed its inhabitation. Four years after obtaining the land, Henderson sent a party led by James Robertson to investigate the space bordering both sides of the river. Camping in French Lick, they were soon reinforced by another group under the direction of John Donelson. Together, the settlers cleared the wilderness around the outpost and erected a log stockade that they called “Fort Nashborough.” They derived its name from General Francis Nash, who had led the famous 1st North Carolina Regiment during the American Revolutionary War. Mortally wounded at the Battle of Germantown, Nash had since become an national symbol for the Patriot cause.\n\nOver time, a small community formed around the wooden fortress. To maintain order among the village’s population, Richard Henderson created the Cumberland Compact—the first articles of self-governance used to administer the community. At the time of its passing, Fort Nashborough was actually a part of North Carolina. But when nearby pioneers in the mountains failed to create the separate State of Franklin, North Carolina decided to surrender its Trans-Appalachian domain to the federal government. As such, Fort Nashborough became a part of the Territory of Tennessee, which formally joined the Union as a state in 1796. The state legislature subsequently charted the community as the “City of Nashville” approximately a decade later. Nashville quickly emerged as the economic and political hub for the middle of Tennessee. It specifically morphed into a vibrant river trading port, as well as an industrious manufacturing center. Railroads further augmented its prosperity, as it allowed for more goods and laborers to flow easily into the city. Plantations fueled by slave labor surrounded Nashville, as well, which primarily grew staple crops like cotton and tobacco. Some of those estates grew to be very large, including U.S. President Andrew Jackson’s plantation “The Hermitage.” As such, Nashville had become Tennessee’s most important community by the mid-19th century. The Tennessee General Assembly even selected the city to serve as the state’s capitol in 1843. It then hired architect William Strickland to design the new state capitol building, which is still in use today!\n\nNashville’s socioeconomic importance to Tennessee made it a primary target for Union armies when the state sided with the Confederacy during the American Civil War. Occupied in February of 1862 by northern troops, Nashville was the first Confederate capital captured in the conflict. The Tennessee General Assembly and the state governor—Isham G. Harris—quickly fled the city for Memphis. Afterward, President Abraham Lincoln used Nashville as the headquarters for his representatives in the state, specifically Military Governor Andrew Johnson. Nevertheless, rebel guerillas continuously harried the federal soldiers inside Nashville, harassing their lines of supply and communication. The culmination of the Confederate attacks around the city culminated at the end of 1864 with the Battle of Nashville. The climax of the brief—yet fierce—Franklin—Nashville Campaign, the fight was a desperate bid by the rebels to disrupt Union logistics in the Deep South. After chasing its enemy for months, the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Lieutenant General John B. Hood seemingly pinned Major General George H. Thomas’ combined Union force in Nashville. Hoping to lure the federals out of their fortifications, Hood’s men patiently waited outside the city for close to two weeks. On December 15, the Union garrison finally struck, assailing both flanks of the Confederate line. While Thomas’ diversionary assault on the right flank proved to be ineffective, the main thrust against the left shattered the rebel line in a torrent of brutal hand-to-hand fighting. Hood withdrew a few miles to the south that night, with Thomas in hot pursuit. When fighting resumed the following day, the northern soldiers completely routed Hood’s Army of Tennessee.\n\nThe end of the Civil War brought about the collapse of slavery and the antebellum economic system that had kept it afloat. Despite enjoying a brief period of freedom in the immediate wake of the conflict, African Americans in Nashville endured racial discrimination that barred them from receiving equal citizenship rights. Known as “Jim Crow,” the laws lasted for decades until the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s overthrew them. The city itself was at the forefront of the fight to confront racial segregation, with hundreds of local activists demonstrating across the city. Celebrated today as the “Nashville Sit-ins,’ they largely protested to desegregate businesses in Nashville. Some of the activists—including the late John Lewis—went on the form the historic Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee shortly thereafter. Nashville also grew exponentially as a city, thanks in large part to the popularity of its river wharves and train depots. Thousands of people subsequently moved to Nashville. Dozens of new educational institutions opened in the city, too, reinforcing Nashville’s moniker as the “Athens of the South.” One such facility to open was the great Vanderbilt University. Founded in 1873 thanks to the financing of railroad magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt, the university has since grown into a massive, internationally recognized research institute. Another prolific schools founded at the time included Fisk University, which became one of the most prestigious black institutions of higher education in the nation. Nashville’s economy continued to expand and diversify, with the fields of agriculture and manufacturing serving as the major local industries. The city specifically became a hotbed for the production of water heaters, appliances, and automobiles in the 20th century. As the decades progressed, though, education, finance, and health care emerged with equal importance to Nashville’s modern economy.\n\nMusic soon became Nashville’s most important export. Starting with the regular live broadcasts of the Grand Ole Opry in 1925, Nashville underwent a rapid transformation into the “Music City” that many know and love today. Country music, in particular, became part of the city’s cultural identity, as people across America equated Nashville with the Grand Ole Opry and its stars. Originally hosted from the Ryman Auditorium, countless country music legends performed on the show at one point or another. Among the famous musicians to sing on the Grand Ole Opry included Gene Autry, Bill Monroe, Ernest Tubb, Roy Acuff, and Hank Williams. (Many of those individuals even stayed at The Hermitage Hotel!) The national infatuation with the Grand Ole Opry—and country music in general—exploded in the decades following World War II, giving rise to the commercialization of the genre as a whole. Many new prolific record labels flourished in Nashville as a result, such as the likes of Mercury, Capitol Records, and RCA. Concentrated in an area of town called “Music Row,” those recording studios—primarily RCA’s Studio B—were largely responsible for creating a sub-type of country music known as the “Nashville Sound.” New generations of musicians also started flocking to the city in search of an opportunity to make a name for themselves. Among the performers to arrive in Nashville included the likes of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Loretta Lynn, Patsy Cline, Charley Pride, Tammy Wynette, and Buck Owens. Country music has since become one of the most beloved cultural art forms in the United States. It is celebrated all over Nashville today, particularly in the world-renowned Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum. No trip to Nashville is complete without a visit to this fascinating institution.\n\nLed by the city’s Board of Trade, local Nashvillians rallied together to raise an initial $300,000 dollars-worth of stock to erect The Hermitage Hotel. By the time the project finished, though, the investors had spent several hundred more on the project. Locals downtown watched in utter awe as architect James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter developed what became Nashville’s third skyscraper. Carpenter spared no effort with his design, using the principles that he had learned while studying abroad at the celebrated École des Beaux Arts in Paris. Guestrooms featured mahogany paneling and offered a wealth of cutting-edge amenities like running ice water, a telephone, and even a private bath. The dining room—now the Grand Ballroom—contained Circassian walnut craftsmanship as well as several ornate chandeliers. Carpenter also constructed a spectacular assembly hall on the top floor of The Hermitage Hotel, designed to host some of the most extravagant parties in all of Nashville. Further below on the eighth floor, he and his staff dedicated a few sample rooms for traveling salesmen to exhibit their goods. This unique commercial aspect of the hotel continued elsewhere on the grounds, as a space for various shops opened along the street. In the basement, Carpenter developed a German-styled rathskeller called the “Grill Room,” which had a vaulted ceiling supported by several massive columns. (Its adjacent taproom is known today as the Oak Bar.) A men’s barber shop provided convenient service, and behind the men’s room, a small exercise room existed with optional showers for guests.\n\nPerhaps the greatest space in the entire building was the central lobby. Glorious Tennessee marble adorned the lobby floors, while Italian marble graced its soaring columns. Above the space sat a magnificent painted glass skylight, which functioned as the lobby’s crown jewel. Some of the panels displayed amazing detail, including mythological figures like Roman god Janus. Carpenter supported the entire structure with its own vaulted ceiling that was held up by several magnificent columns. The columns themselves abounded with many wonderful decorative elements. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior, the structures featured:\n\n“Ionic voluted capitals with egg and tongue molding and an abacus with leaf and tongue enrichment [placed upon] large, fluteless, terra-cotta coupled columns. An entablature of terra-cotta string moldings (adorned with leaf and tongue and egg and tongue enrichment and dentil molding with fillets) and a festoon and acanthus leaf frieze [was] above the coupled Ionic columns. Smaller, polished granite coupled columns, with Corinthian capitals, [supported] the architrave of the arched window [and several] openings.”\n\nYet, those same details spread throughout the ceiling of the lobby, as well. For instance, the egg and dart motifs continued near the fascia of the skylight, as did some fantastic dentil molding. Additional motifs—including cherubs, plant life, and the fleur-de-lis—appeared commonly in other areas of the lobby. A grand ladies entrance also resided along neighboring Union Street. It featured marble-clad hallways that led directly to such places like the loggia, the main dining room, and the various parlors inside the mezzanine that overlooked the lobby.\n\nImage of Glass Panel Depicting the Roman God Janus, The Hermitage Hotel, 1908, Historic Hotels of America, in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe Hermitage Hotel itself displays a wonderful blend of Beaux-Arts style architecture, which became widely popular in Gilded Age America. This beautiful architectural form originally began at an art school in Paris known as the École des Beaux-Arts during the 1830s. There was much resistance to the Neoclassism of the day among French artists, who yearned for the intellectual freedom to pursue less rigid design aesthetics. Four instructors in particular were responsible for establishing the movement: Joseph-Louis Duc, Félix Duban, Henri Labrouste, and Léon Vaudoyer. The training that these instructors created involved fusing architectural elements from several earlier styles, including Imperial Roman, Italian Renaissance, ad Baroque. As such, a typical building created with Beaux-Arts-inspired designs would feature a rusticated first story, followed by several more simplistic ones. A flat roof would then top the structure. Symmetry became the defining character, with every building’s layout featuring such elements like balustrades, pilasters, and cartouches. Sculptures and other carvings were commonplace throughout the design, too. Beaux-Arts only found a receptive audience in France and the United States though, as most other Western architects at the time gravitated toward British design principles.\n\nRatification of the 19th Amendment (1920): By the summer of 1920, 35 states across the Union had ratified the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. If passed, the amendment would have granted women the right to vote by outlawing any practice that would disenfranchise a person based on their sex. Yet, the law remained in limbo as 13 state legislatures did not yet support the amendment. In order for any constitutional amendment to become federal law, both chambers of Congress must pass the proposed legislation by a two-thirds majority. Then, it must pass in two-thirds of the states before returning for ratification in Washington. As there were only 48 states in the Union at the time (Alaska and Hawaii would not join until 1959), the amendment was one state short of passing. Fortunately, two of the 13 states—Tennessee and North Carolina—had yet to vote for the amendment and were effectively undecided. Suffragists around the country started assessing which one would most likely to swing in favor of the law and believed that Tennessee was their best bet. Carrie Chapman Catt—the President of the National American Women Suffrage Association—made the determination herself, having arrived in the state to ascertain the situation that July. Moving into Suite 309 of The Hermitage Hotel, she quickly began strategizing with local suffragist leaders like Catherine Talty Kenny, Anne Crawford Milton, Katherine B. Warner, Lizzie Crozier French, and Anne Dallas Dudley of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association. (Dudley was also serving as the Vice President for the NAWSA, so she and Catt were well acquainted.) The group were later joined by reinforcements from the National Women’s Party, which included the influential Sue Shelton White. While the local suffragists attempted to sway public opinion to back the amendment, Catt and her colleagues from the National Women’s Party frequently met with their allies in the state government at the hotel. At one point, Governor Albert Houston Roberts even answered Catt’s call to speak with her personally.\n\nBut on the same day that Catt arrived at The Hermitage Hotel, so too did one of her nemeses—the antisuffragist Josephine Pearson. Booking a suite on the eighth floor, Pearson and her political acolytes started their own lobbying campaign against the bill. People in Pearson’s camp believed that most women did not want the vote. Furthermore, they argued that a fundamental difference between men and women existed, in which women were pure and not suited for the world of politics. Some also hailed from elite families and feared that enhanced voting rights would allow for an unhealthy redistribution of power in society. This was particularly true for affluent southern whites, who ardently believed that the amendment would undermine the South’s racist Jim Crow policies. Soon enough, the red rose lapels on the shirts of Pearson’s antisuffragists became just as common in The Hermitage Hotel as Catt’s yellow roses. The campaigning exerted by both sides was tireless over the next six weeks, as the state legislature furiously debated the 19th Amendment. So many political operatives traveled to The Hermitage Hotel that some in Nashville took to calling it the “third house” of Tennessee’s congress. Josephine Pearson and her “Antis” eventually reserved the building’s mezzanine—as well as several rooms on the first floor—to serve as their main headquarters. At one point, the anti-suffragists even opened a speakeasy in order to court both pro and anti-suffrage legislators. (Prohibition had just been passed with the 18th Amendment a year prior). Known informally as the “Jack Daniel’s Suite,” the men became more receptive to their arguments the more they drank. Some even sauntered down the halls singing the anti-suffragist’s anthem, “Keep the Home Fires Burning,” once the speakeasy had closed for the night.\n\nAs the time for the vote in the state legislature came closer, the atmosphere in The Hermitage Hotel grew incredibly tense. Shouting and fistfights became more frequent among Catt and Pearson’s supporters. Carrie Chapman Catt started to suspect that her phone in Suite 309 had been tapped, while several of her fellow pro-suffragists were spied upon by strange-looking men. Voting began on August 18. While the amendment passed the Tennessee Senate, many worried that it would die in the state’s divided House of Representatives. Predictions were so close that neither side felt that they had enough votes to win. Sure enough, the first round of voting in the House resulted in a deadlock. But during the second round of voting, a 24-year-old representative named Harry T. Burn—who had previously shown support for Pearson’s anti-suffragists—decided to change his vote to “aye.” It turned out that Burn had been inspired by his mother, who had written him a letter that said: “Hurrah and vote for suffrage and don’t keep them in doubt. Don’t forget to be a good boy and help Ms. Catt.” Burn’s change of heart tipped the scales in the suffragists favor, allowing the amendment to pass 49 to 47. A pandemonium erupted in the chamber and Burn was whisked away by a bodyguard to The Hermitage Hotel. Singing and wild cheers filled the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol from the supporters who had fought so hard for the 19th Amendment’s ratification. After surging toward the Governor’s Mansion, the pro-suffragists flocked to The Hermitage Hotel to give Carrie Chapman Catt the terrific news. Looking onto the crowd with a smile, she had realized that the 19th Amendment had finally become a national law. Some 27 million women now had the right to vote!

Bush, 43rd President of the United States (2001 – 2009)\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt: For six weeks in the summer of 1920, Carrie Chapman Catt lived inside The Hermitage Hotel. She had arrived in the middle of July, hoping to help local suffragists in their fight to convince enough Tennessee state legislators to ratify the proposed 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A prominent figure in the national Women’s Suffrage movement, she was one of the figures responsible for eventually giving women the right to vote. Born in Wisconsin shortly before the start of the American Civil War, Catt had spent her childhood in Charles City, Iowa. She subsequently obtained an undergraduate degree at the University of Iowa before studying law for a short period of time. Catt eventually became a high-school principle in Mason City, rising to become its first female superintendent in 1883. During this time, Carrie Chapman Catt started engrossing herself into the women’s suffrage movement, which had started to build momentum in the Gilded Age. She quickly became one of the biggest suffragettes in Iowa, going a far as to organize the Iowa Woman Suffrage Association. Her dedication to the movement proved so be great that she even legally had her second husband, George Catt, sign a prenuptial agreement that would allow her to work exclusively on women’s suffrage for four months of the year. (George Catt remained steadfast in his support of his wife’s political beliefs, leaving her a large sum of money after his death to finance her activities.)\n\nCarrie Chapman Catt’s abilities as a fundraiser and community organizer were unrivaled at the time. As such, the members of the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) elected her as their president in 1900. She had big shoes to fill, though, considering her predecessor was the legendary Susan B. Anthony. Nevertheless, Catt rose to the challenge. She quickly coordinated all sorts of political campaigns across the United States, making the NAWSA an emerging force in national politics. (Catt also united the organization with another group that she had recently founded called the “International Women Suffrage Alliance.”) After taking a brief sabbatical to care for her dying husband, Catt continued to guide the activities of the NAWSA for the better part of the next two decades. Under her tutelage, a large network of suffragists began lobbying extensively to build support for a constitutional amendment that would outlaw one’s sex as a prerequisite to vote. Catt called this strategy her “Winning Plan.” The first sign its success emerged after she consolidated the various suffrage groups in New York City to form the Women’s Suffrage Party. Its members greatly influenced the New York legislature toward passing a statewide mandate that allowed women the right to vote. Catt also gained considerable support from President Woodrow Wilson, whom she had impressed with her organization’s assistance to the national war effort during World War I. President Wilson subsequently gave a speech in 1918 that spoke favorably about the prospects of female suffrage.\n\nOver the next three years, the efforts of Catt and the NAWSA convinced 15 other state legislatures—as well as the Territory of Alaska—to pass similar state laws granting women the franchise. And with the backing of the White House, national support for a constitutional amendment had reached its zenith. In 1919, James R. Mann—a congressional representative from Illinois—motioned to vote on the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (also called the Susan Anthony Amendment). The measure subsequently passed the House of Representatives with a vote total of 304 to 89—more than the two-thirds majority required to pass any proposed amendment. Two weeks later, the Senate passed the bill 52 to 25. Per constitutional law, the 19th Amendment then went to the state legislatures for ratification. Catt and her fellow suffragists across the nation watched eagerly as 35 different states approved the bill—just one shy of a two-thirds majority (Alaska and Hawaii were not yet states). But support stalled by 1920, as 11 other states refused to pass the amendment. Only two states remained that had yet to cast a vote either way: Tennessee and North Carolina. Recognizing the greater number of suffragists in Tennessee, Catt and her allies quickly traveled to Nashville that summer to lobby the state’s politicians. After six weeks of pitched battling against various anti-suffrage forces, Catt and her fellow suffragists managed to convince enough legislators to pass the 19th Amendment. Triumphant, Catt then founded the League of Women Voters as a means of educating women about their newfound civic responsibility. She subsequently served as the organization’s president until her death in 1947.\n\nAnne Dallas Dudley: Born in Nashville, Anne Dallas Dudley decided to separate from tradition and change history. She became one of the founders—as well as the first president—of the Nashville Equal Suffrage League in 1911. Then, four years later, she was elected as the President of the Tennessee Equal Suffrage Association. As such, she took an active role in helping out the grassroots suffrage leagues scattered across the state. Her abilities as a politician were soon recognized nationally, as Carrie Chapman Catt elevated her to serve as the Vice President of the National American Women Suffrage Association (NAWSA) in 1917. She was then given charge of the Congressional Steering Committee, which was engaged in a fierce push to enact a federal suffrage amendment. Although it took Dudley nearly two years, the Congressional Steering Committee succeeded in its push to start the creation of such a law. When the 19th Amendment passed both chambers of Congress, it subsequently went to the states for ratification. But when support stalled in 1920, Dudley played an integral role in helping to pass the amendment in Tennessee. Having returned to her native Nashville a year prior, she was one of the most vocal voices petitioning local legislators to place their support behind the law.\n\nDudley had many endearing qualities, including being very articulate, energetic, and confident. She brought a charming— yet firm—style of smart leadership. Her social skills and untiring drive helped influence the gradual shift of public opinion about the role of women in both society and government. Dudley was also a visionary, proclaiming:\n\n“We have a vision of a time when a woman’s home will be the whole wide world, her children all whose feet are bare, and her sisters all who need a helping hand; a vision of a new knighthood, a new chivalry, when men will not only fight for women but for the rights of women.”\n\nThis idealism served as the catalyst for her career as a social activist and philanthropist. She and her two children led the first suffrage parade in the South and was the first woman in Nashville to make an outdoor speech. During her time with the Nashville Equal Suffrage league, membership grew from a mere nine members to 1,200 in just a few years. Dudley also helped organize the national convention of the NAWSA in 1914, which was actually held in Nashville. (The Hermitage Hotel operated as the headquarters for the NAWSA that year, too). She also possessed a deep-rooted sense of patriotism, serving on the National Women’s Liberty Loan Committee during World War I. The organization successfully complete three war bond drive across Tennessee, raising much-needed funds for the national war effort.\n\nDudley was persuasive and skilled at handling anti-suffrage arguments. She frequently responded to criticism that equated male suffrage with military service, pointing out that “women bear armies.” Dudley also held the conviction that women themselves needed the ballot for the sake of their own development. After the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, Anne Dallas Dudley continued to raise her two children and became known as one of Nashville’s most gracious hostesses. She maintained her work as a social and civic leader, too, joining such organizations like the American Red Cross, the Garden Club of Nashville, the Association for Preservation of Antiquities, and the Colonial Dames. She even helped found the Woman’s Civic League of Nashville and was president of the Maternal Welfare Organization of Tennessee. The street adjoining The Hermitage Hotel is now named “Anne Dallas Dudley Boulevard” in honor of her legacy. A painting of her face is included in the Pride of Tennessee collage in the Tennessee State Capitol, located a block away from the hotel.\n\n1908: Construction on this magnificent historic building began when a group of concerned locals led by the Nashville Board of Trade decided to construct a luxurious hotel in downtown Nashville. Hiring the renowned architect James Edwin Ruthven Carpenter, the investors ultimately spent more than a million dollars on the project. Carpenter spared no effort with his design, using the brilliant design principles of the French Beaux-Arts school to augment the hotel’s soon-to-be iconic façade.\n\n1910: On opening night—September 17—countless luminaries from the greater Nashville area flooded into The Hermitage Hotel. A lavish feast awaited all show stepped inside, as did the famous orchestra that played at the famed Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City. Advertised as “fireproof, noise-proof, and dust-proof,” the hotel’s architecture and amenities stunned the guests, as well.\n\n1911: President William Howard Taft attended a banquet held in his honor at The Hermitage Hotel. It became the first of several visits made by U.S. Presidents to the hotel. In subsequent years, U.S. Presidents Woodrow Wilson, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ricard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush all traveled to the building at one point or another.\n\n1918: Charlie Chaplin approached the front desk carrying his iconic custard pie prop, after an adoring fan had given him the dish during a wartime fundraising event at the Ryman Auditorium. Roughly a year later, The Hermitage Hotel helped cook for a procession of 3,600 soldiers that had returned from serving in France. It also held a special dinner for Admiral Albert Gleaves, Admiral of the Asiatic Fleet.\n\n1920: Pro and anti-suffragists tirelessly lobbied local politicians from inside The Hermitage Hotel, while the state legislature fiercely debated ratifying the 19th Amendment. Led by Carrie Chapman Catt and Josephine Pearson, respectively, the two camps effectively transformed the building into their personal headquarters. Thanks to the efforts of Catt and her fellow pro-suffragists, the amendment passed on August 18, 1920.\n\n1929: The Francis Craig Orchestra began performing at the Grill Room and the accompanying Oak Bar. His orchestra was also the first to broadcast over the WSM, enjoying phenomenal success as one of NBC’s most popular programs. Many young entertainers also performed with his band, including the great Dinah Shore.\n\n1940: Vivian Leigh and her husband, Laurence Olivier, had a limited layover at the hotel when their plane was grounded by bad weather. The two had just been married some four months prior. Among the other actors to stay at the hotel around the time included Spencer Tracey, who stopped by on route to Florida to appear in the movie, The Yearling.\n\n1947: Right before he retired from leading his orchestra at The Hermitage Hotel, Francis Craig scribbled the lyrics to a song called “Near You” that he had written inside the Grill Room. The song rapidly rose in popularity, remaining on the Hit Parade for 16 consecutive weeks. Its record sold 2.3 million copies and its sheet music was reproduced in 20 different languages!\n\n1953: Gloria Swanson visited the hotel when she showcased a clothing line at three separate fashion shows! By this point, The Hermitage Hotel was at the height of its original popularity, hosting countless Hollywood celebrities, country music icons, and prominent dignitaries.\n\n1975: Thanks to the preservation efforts of the city’s Metro Historical Commission, the U.S. Department of the Interior listed The Hermitage Hotel in the National Register of Historic Places. The organization specifically cited its brilliant Beaux-Arts-style architecture, as well as its connections to Tennessee’s 20th-century political history as the reasons for its decision.\n\n1977: Despite serving as the city’s premier holiday destination for decades, The Hermitage Hotel had fallen on hard times. Tourism to the city’s historic downtown had dwindled, which depressed business for the hotel. Developers subsequently started eyeing the location for their own construction projects, leaving the fate of the building uncertain.\n\n1981: Local preservationists with Historic Nashville teamed together with Mayor Richard Fulton to save The Hermitage Hotel. They invested heavily into its renovation, restoring the magnificent building back to its former glory. After nearly four years of construction, The Hermitage Hotel reopened once again as a Park Suite Hotel on March 6. It soon resumed its status as the city’s most prolific hotel in a matter of months.\n\n1996: The Hermitage Hotel joined Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It has since become one the most active partners in the collection, proudly showcasing its affiliation with the National Trust.\n\n2000: Historic Hotels of Nashville purchased The Hermitage Hotel and completely renovated the guestrooms and public areas. After completing the construction work, the reinvigorated Grand Dame reopened once more on Valentine Day’s some three years later.\n\n2007: The Hermitage Hotel received numerous awards and accolades for its outstanding service, including a coveted Five Diamond rating by the American Automobile Association. It then earned the praise of Forbes magazine, obtaining a five-star score from the company a year later.\n\n2020: The U.S. Secretary of the Interior designated The Hermitage Hotel as a National Historic Landmark—the highest degree of federal recognition that a historic structure can receive from Washington. According to the agency: “The 19th Amendment to the Constitution gave women the right to vote, and the Hermitage Hotel was a critical centerpiece for the women’s suffrage movement as the hotel was used as a headquarters by suffragists to secure Tennessee’s ratification.”"
