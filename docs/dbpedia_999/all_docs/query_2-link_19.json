        "text": "Dinah's guests: The Chad Mitchell Trio, Sam Fletcher, Georgia Brown, Shore, and Streisand.\n\nDinah Shore — a radio and film star in the 1940s and 1950s — hosted and sang in a series of monthly broadcasts on NBC from 1961-1963 called The Dinah Shore Show. When she announced a sabbatical from television in order to concentrate on her family, the last show of the season was closely watched. Shore built her last show around four new, youthful talents.\n\nIntroduced by Shore as “a girl barely out of her teens ... wistful, funny, appealing, and enormously talented. She’s basically a comedienne,” Shore said, “but she’s a fine dramatic actress, too, as you’ll see when she sings her torch song.”\n\nStreisand, wearing a Grecian-style, orange dress, sang two songs on The Dinah Shore Show: “Cry Me A River” and “Happy Days Are Here Again.” Dinah Shore's choreographer Tony Charmoli recalled that Barbra wore a lot of second hand clothes in those days. “So we did a dress rehearsal,” he said, “and what Barbra wore, thinking it was an acceptable Sunday evening family show [dress], it was really something she got out a rag bag somewhere. Dinah said ‘I just don't think I can endorse her looking like that. The audience just doesn't understand that.’ So Barbra complied and wore one of Dinah's gowns. I remember it was an orange gown with a big wide belt and an orange chiffon scarf. There wasn't time for sewing it on, so we put it on, tightened the belt, and put some pins in the back. Now, Barbra had to go up a staircase, and I remember telling her ‘Barbra, don't go up normally. Side-step your way up. Don't show your back ever toward the camera. She did an interesting thing. At the point when she thought she was turning her back a little too much and they might see the back of the dress, she flipped that chiffon scarf in the air and it kind of distracted you from all of that. She knew what she was doing.\n\nIn the last segment of the show, Barbra joined Dinah and her guests Georgia Brown (from Broadway's Oliver!), Sam Fletcher, and the Chad Mitchell Trio (folk singers). They all sang a rousing rendition of “Brotherhood Of Man” (from How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying) and Barbra sang one of the verses.\n\nBarbra flew to California for her first time to appear on The Dinah Shore Show — which was taped in color. She was on the cusp of being cast in Funny Girl on Broadway."
