        "text": "Madeline Kahn was an actress renowned for her comedic flair and velvety soprano voice. Born Madeline Gail Wolfson on September 29, 1942, in Boston, Kahn started her career in off-Broadway productions before finding her calling in film and television. She graduated from Hofstra University with a drama degree, where she honed her acting chops and began to shape the trajectory of her future career. Kahn's breakthrough role came under the direction of Mel Brooks in his 1974 comedy classic, Blazing Saddles. Her portrayal of the saloon singer Lili Von Shtupp earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. This was followed by another nomination for the same category in 1975 for her performance in Paper Moon. Kahn's partnership with Brooks proved fruitful, leading to her unforgettable roles in other Brooks's films such as Young Frankenstein and High Anxiety. Beyond her film career, Kahn was also a force to be reckoned with on the small screen and stage. She won an Emmy Award for her guest role in the popular sitcom, The Cosby Show and a Tony Award for her performance in the Broadway play The Sisters Rosensweig. Sadly, her life and career were cut short when she passed away on December 3, 1999, due to ovarian cancer.\n\nLoretta Young (born Gretchen Young; January 6, 1913 â€“ August 12, 2000) was an American actress. Starting as a child actress, she had a long and varied career in film from 1917 to 1953. She won the 1948 Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the 1947 film The Farmer's Daughter, and received an Oscar nomination for her role in Come to the Stable in 1949. Young moved to the relatively new medium of television, where she had a dramatic anthology series, The Loretta Young Show, from 1953 to 1961. The series earned three Emmy Awards, and was re-run successfully on daytime TV and later in syndication. In the 1980s, Young returned to the small screen and won a Golden Globe for her role in Christmas Eve in 1986."
