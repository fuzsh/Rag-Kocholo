        "text": "Actress | Singer | TV Host Born Frances Rose Shore on March 1, 1916 in Winchester, TN\n\nDinah Shore was a durable and phenomenally successful entertainer who moved gracefully from radio and recordings to television, cookbooks and her own celebrity golf tournament, capturing and keeping America's heart along the way.\n\nOver the long span of her career, the golden-haired Southern belle garnered nine gold records, 10 Emmys and her most cherished award, a Peabody, which included the inscription, \"What TV needs, obviously, is about 100 Dinah Shores.\"\n\nIn observance of her death, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce placed flowers on one of Shore's three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, awarded to her for outstanding achievement in radio, recording and television.\n\n\"We have lost one of the voices that defined an era for us,\" said Hollywood billionaire and former 20th Century Fox owner Marvin Davis, who, with his wife, Barbara, was a friend of Shore. \"In many ways Dinah Shore set an example for us all to follow, not least in the areas of charity and fund raising for the less fortunate. Dinah was a joy to be around, independent and humorous. We should not mourn her death but rather celebrate her life.\"\n\nShore reigned over television for four decades from its infancy in the 1950s until the 1990s with a succession of shows built around her husky, sentimental voice, Southern comedic charm, cooking talent and ability to cajole celebrities to join her for whatever they wanted to say or do."
