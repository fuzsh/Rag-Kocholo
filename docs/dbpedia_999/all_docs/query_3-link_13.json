        "text": "Many well known and highly identifiable actresses have tried and failed to make the arduous crossover from fizzy TV sitcom star to mature, dramatic artist. Usually it was their hardcore fans who refused to accept them in any other light. Sally Field and Elizabeth Montgomery come first to mind as two strong actresses, with even stronger TV comedy character personas to contend with, who managed to make the none-too-easy leap to serious dramatic stardom after the fact. And then there's THAT girl ... lovely, glowing brunette Marlo Thomas ... another prime example.\n\nBorn in Detroit, Michigan on November 21, 1937, Marlo was christened Margaret Julia Thomas. Raised within the mad Beverly Hills whirl of the entertainment business as the daughter of show business legend Danny Thomas, she was initially dissuaded from an acting career and began a half-hearted adult life as a school teacher.\n\nQuickly switching to acting, however, Marlo began with early TV appearances in the late 1950's on such series as \"Dobie Gillis,\" \"77 Sunset Strip,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Zane Grey Theatre\" (an appearance with her father). Her first break came when she was cast as Joey Bishop's sister and aspiring actress on the sitcom The Bob Newhart Show (1961) for one season, and she continued to build up her small screen resumé with assorted guest shots on \"Bonanza,\" \"My Favorite Martian,\" \"McHale's Navy,\" \"The Donna Reed Show\" and \"Ben Casey.\"\n\nFollowing her delightful work on the London stage as Corey in \"Barefoot in the Park\" in 1965, Marlo appeared in a failed TV pilot. The pilot was seen by ABC, and they had her tested for another sitcom lead and passed with flying colors. This one stuck did not fail. Audiences adored \"That Girl\" with the romantic entanglements and struggling ambition of Ann Marie, a single, independent and very trendy young lady in the real world as an actress wannabe. Marlo became an instant household name (as did co-star Ted Bessell) and earned a Golden Globe (\"Best TV Star\") and four Emmy nominations during the five-year run of the groundbreaking show.\n\nCancelling the show on her own terms in 1971, the smoky-voiced actress was faced with a huge task of breaking a stereotype as a perky, fresh-faced, wide-eyed innocent. Capitalizing on her TV fame, she immediately pursued serious film roles. Playing the title dramatic role of Jenny (1970) opposite Alan Alda, she portrayed an unwed, naïve, pregnant girl who marries a filmmaker for convenience sake and earned a Golden Globe nom for \"Most Promising Newcomer\" in the process. Still, the box office take was mild and the public needed more convincing. When she made her Broadway debut successfully in the Herb Gardner play \"Thieves\" opposite Richard Mulligan in 1975, she made another stab at films by recreating her stage role. The reviews for Thieves (1977) co-starring Charles Grodin this time (who directed her in the Broadway version) were underwhelming. She would meet talk show icon Phil Donahue on his daytime TV program while a guest promoting the Thieves (1977) movie. They wed in 1980.\n\nDuring this time Marlo broadened her focus and combined her deep love for children and education with her show business career. She took home bookend Emmy Awards for producing the \"Outstanding Children's Specials\" Free to Be... You and Me (1974) and, later, Free to Be... a Family (1988). She would also win a Grammy for her children's album \"Marlo Thomas & Friends.\" As for TV, she earned wonderful reviews starring in the ABC holiday mini-movie comedy It Happened One Christmas (1977) playing a troubled female version of James Stewart's protagonist in Ist das Leben nicht schön? (1946) but it was her dramatic work in the TV movies The Lost Honor of Kathryn Beck (1984) Wie sag ich's meinen Eltern (1985) (Golden Globe nomination), Nobody's Child (1986) (Emmy Award, Golden Globe nomination), and In der Gewalt der anderen (1991), Angeklagt - Der Vater (1994) and Der Ruf des Todes (1994) that forever erased her pristine stereotype image and saw her as a dramatic force to be reckoned with.\n\nMarlo's subsequent return visits to Broadway with the plays \"Social Security\" (1986) and \"The Shadow Box\" (1994) added to her list of successes and continued with demanding theater roles such as Beatrice in \"The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigold\" (1990), Martha in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\" (1992) and Ouisa in \"Sex Degrees of Separation\" (1992).\n\nMarlo remained actively involved on TV in everything from classic comedy (as Jennifer Aniston's mom in Friends (1994) to adult drama as a lawyer/mentor in the highly-rated crime drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (1999), with other TV guest appearances including \"Roseanne,\" \"Ally McBeal,\" \"Ugly Betty,\" \"The New Normal\" and an additional recurring role on Wet Hot American Summer: 10 Jahre später (2017).\n\nSporadic filming into the millennium included the \"Odd Couple\"-styled comedy Ein Köder für den Killer (1990) co-starring Elaine May and featuring May's daughter Jeannie Berlin who also co-wrote, and featured roles in the romantic comedy Echt blond (1997), the drama Starstruck (1998), the social comedy Playing Mona Lisa (2000), the Miley Cyrus romantic dramedy LOL - Laughing Out Loud (2012), the witty comedy The Female Brain (2017) and the action comedy Ocean's 8 (2018) headed by Sandra Bullock.\n\nYounger brother/producer Tony Thomas and actress/sister Terre Thomas also involved themselves in show business careers. On a more personal level, Marlo is an accomplished author, humanitarian and social activist. She has also continued the tradition of her late father as National Outreach Director for St. Jude's Children Hospital for cancer research.\n\nThe woman who will always be remembered as the crazy, accident-prone, lovable Lucy Ricardo was born Lucille Desiree Ball on August 6, 1911 in Jamestown, New York, the daughter of Desiree Evelyn \"DeDe\" (Hunt) and Henry Durrell \"Had\" Ball. Her father died before she was four, and her mother worked several jobs, so she and her younger brother were raised by their grandparents. Always willing to take responsibility for her brother and young cousins, she was a restless teenager who yearned to \"make some noise\". She entered a dramatic school in New York City, but while her classmate Bette Davis received all the raves, she was sent home; \"too shy\". She found some work modeling for Hattie Carnegie's and, in 1933, she was chosen to be a \"Goldwyn Girl\" and appear in the film Roman Scandals (1933).\n\nShe was put under contract to RKO Radio Pictures and several small roles, including one in Ich tanz mich in dein Herz hinein (1935), followed. Eventually, she received starring roles in B-pictures and, occasionally, a good role in an A-picture, like in Bühneneingang (1937) or The Big Street (1942). While filming Too Many Girls (1940), she met and fell madly in love with a young Cuban actor-musician named Desi Arnaz. Despite different personalities, lifestyles, religions and ages (he was six years younger), he fell hard, too, and after a passionate romance, they eloped and were married in November 1940. Lucy soon switched to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she got better roles in films such as Du Barry Was a Lady (1943); Best Foot Forward (1943) and the Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy vehicle Zu klug für die Liebe (1945). In 1948, she took a starring role in the radio comedy \"My Favorite Husband\", in which she played the scatterbrained wife of a Midwestern banker. In 1950, CBS came knocking with the offer of turning it into a television series. After convincing the network brass to let Desi play her husband and to sign over the rights to and creative control over the series to them, work began on the most popular and universally beloved sitcom of all time.\n\nWith I Love Lucy (1951), she and Desi promoted the 3-camera technique now the standard in filming sitcoms using 35mm film (the earliest known example of the 3-camera technique is the first Russian feature film, \"Defence of Sevastopol\" in 1911). Desi syndicated I Love Lucy. Lucille Ball was the first woman to own her own studio as the head of Desilu Productions.\n\nLucille Ball died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, age 77, of an acute aortic aneurysm on April 26, 1989 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nBorn as Vivian Roberta Jones in Cherryvale, Kansas, she had a brother and four sisters. Her family moved to Independence, Kansas, and later studied drama under Anna Ingleman and William Inge. Their next move, to Albuquerque, New Mexico, brought her to that city's Little Theatre, which provided her the money she needed to study under Eva Le Gallienne in New York. After arriving in 1932 she had trouble finding stage work until she began a two-year stint in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein's \"Music in the Air\".\n\nShe next understudied Ethel Merman in the hit \"Anything Goes.\" Her first starring role was as Kay Thompson's last minute replacement in \"Hooray for What!\", starring Ed Wynn. In 1945, while starring in a touring company of \"Voice of the Turtle\" she had a nervous breakdown. After undergoing psychotherapy and limited movie work, she returned to the play at the La Jolla (California) Playhouse, where she was seen by Desi Arnaz who decided she was perfect for the role of Ethel Mertz (Ball and Arnaz's first choice, Bea Benaderet, was unavailable) in the I Love Lucy (1951) television series.\n\nAt first she didn't want the part (too frumpy), and hated being cast as the wife of William Frawley (she was 42, he was 64, and the two never got along). Frawley, an alcoholic and on the professional skids had actively campaigned for the role of Fred Mertz after learning that Gale Gordon was also unavailable. Desi Arnaz hired him, but only under strict conditions regarding alcohol consumption and professionalism. The runaway success of the series forced the two to work together but Frawley never forgave Vance for a comment she made about the disparity in their ages, which he overheard. After I Love Lucy (1951) ended she divorced her third husband, married again to John Dodds, and they moved to Stamford, Connecticut, the first time she had lived east of the Mississippi (aside from work) in many years.\n\nIn 1962, she began work on Hoppla Lucy! (1962), but the pressures of long-distance commuting didn't suit her, so after three years she limited her herself to guest appearances. In 1974, she and her husband moved to Belvedere, California (just north of San Francisco Bay) so she could be near her sister. She battled ill-health throughout much of the 1970s and died in 1979, aged 70, of breast and bone cancer.\n\nDiminutive, blond character comedienne whose strident voice and nervy manner made her the perfect foil to Lucille Ball's madcap antics on TV, at first, occasionally, on I Love Lucy (1951) (as \"Betty Ramsay\" and \"Evelyn Bigsby\"), then on a regular basis on Hoppla Lucy! (1962) and Here's Lucy (1968) (as \"Mary Jane Lewis\"). Mary Jane started her show business career on the stage with the civic theatre in her hometown, Muncie, Indiana. After briefly acting with the Guild Theatre in Cincinnati, Ohio, she joined the local radio station WLW and embarked on a lengthy career as a radio actress. Her marriage to fellow actor Jack Zoller was followed by a move to Los Angeles in 1939.\n\nDuring the 1940's and 1950's, Mary Jane became one of a company of much in-demand voice actresses (along with performers Lurene Tuttle, Howard Duff and Bea Benaderet, whom she befriended), comedy inevitably being her forte. She acted on \"The Mel Blanc Show\" (1946), as the love interest \"Leila Ransom\" on \"The Great Gildersleeve\" (1950), \"Blondie\" (1950), \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\" (1950), the family friend on The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (1952), and the voice of basset hound \"Cleo\", owned by Jackie Cooper, on The People's Choice (1955) (1955-56). Her best-known pre-Lucille role was as \"Daisy Enright\", the nemesis of \"Our Miss Brooks\", which starred Eve Arden and Gale Gordon (both on radio and, subsequently, on TV). Mary Jane re-enacted the part for three seasons in the television series, produced by Desilu.\n\nIn 1960, Mary Jane got married for the second time, using her newly married name for her character on Hoppla Lucy! (1962), produced by new hubby Elliott Lewis. By 1965, Mary Jane had replaced Vivian Vance, who retired from the show, as Lucy's neighbor. For most TV audiences, Mary Jane will be fondly remembered as Lucy's cheerful ally and confidante in their various joint endeavors at setting up pompous banker Mr. Mooney (Gale Gordon). Despite other changes in the cast, Mary Jane's role carried over into the next incarnation of the Desilu franchise, Here's Lucy (1968).\n\nAfter her death in August 1999, Lucie Arnaz eulogized her mother's friend Mary Jane, as being the antithesis of the dizzy blonde she portrayed on screen and as a fun-loving and joyous spirit.\n\nMiyoshi Umeki was born as the youngest of 9 children. The daughter of a prominent Japanese iron factory owner, she developed an early passion for music, learning to play the mandolin, harmonica & piano. She also enjoyed singing American-styled tunes, much to the chagrin of her parents. This propensity for Americanized pop songs later paid off.\n\nAlthough she projected the typical Japanese female stereotype of humbleness, delicacy & subservience in most of her prime film & stage roles, she was nevertheless an assertive scene-stealer. This docile & deceptive-looking talent w/ cropped hair as well as a heart-shaped face radiated charm in addition to innocence so effortlessly, she managed to make history at Academy Awards time as the 1st Asian actor to receive an acting Oscar for her superb work in the tragic post-WWII film drama Sayonara (1957).\n\nFollowing World War II, she traveled w/ a U.S. Army G.I. jazz band in Japan as Nancy Umeki & was the 1st to record American songs for RCA Victor Japan. She became an extremely popular radio & nightclub artist, which sparked a move to the U.S. in 1955. Again, she demonstrated a demure prowess for gaining attention w/ her 1-season regular role (1955-1956) on the musical variety show Arthur Godfrey and His Friends (1949). W/ that popularity, she was able to sign w/ Mercury Records, eventually releasing 2 albums.\n\nThe timing couldn't have been more perfect. From this recognition, she was immediately cast in Sayonara (1957), which was based on James A. Michener's best-selling romantic tale. Inspired casting opposite comedian Red Buttons in a tragic, counterpoint romance as a World War II airman & his naive Japanese war bride who fall victim to post-war prejudice led to supporting Academy Awards for both actors. Despite her win, she would not make another film for 4 years.\n\nFollowing her Oscar win, she starred on Broadway w/ the 1958 musical Flower Drum Song, in which she proved a highlight as a starry-eyed Chinese immigrant/mail-order bride w/ her captivating rendition of A Hundred Million Miracles, earning a Tony nomination in the process. She scored additional points after recreating her role for the film version of Mandelaugen und Lotosblüten (1961).\n\nIn total, she made only 5 American films in all. Her other appearances were supporting roles in the naval comedy Ein Haus in Yokoshimi (1961), Ein Leutnant und ein Bett (1962) & Das Mädchen Tamiko (1962). She also tread fairly lightly on TV w/ random 60s appearances on Mutter ist die Allerbeste (1958), Stationsarzt Dr. Kildare (1961), Tausend Meilen Staub (1959) & Mister Ed (1961), among others.\n\nDuing the 50s & 60s, she was an occasional guest on variety shows for TV titans such as Perry Como, Dinah Shore, Merv Griffin, Andy Williams & Ed Sullivan. Arguably her biggest claim to fame was Mrs. Livingston in the heart-tugging TV comedy Eddies Vater (1969). Following this renewed attention, she went into a complete self-imposed retirement.\n\nShe lived a sedate family life for more than 3 decades. Her 1958 marriage to TV producer/director Win Opie ended in divorce after 9 years. She subsequently married TV director Randall Hood in 1968. They ran a business renting editing equipment to film studios & university film programs until his sudden death in Los Angeles in 1976. A longtime resident of North Hollywood, she eventually moved to Missouri w/ advancing age to be nearer to her son & his family. She died of cancer at age 78 on August 28, 2007 in Licking, Missouri.\n\nAnissa Jones was an American child actress of Lebanese descent. She is primarily remembered for the role of the orphan girl Buffy Davis in the hit sitcom \"Family Affair\" (1966-1971). The series lasted for 5 seasons and 138 episodes. Jones' career rapidly declined following the end of the sitcom. She died due to \"combined drug intoxication\" when only 18-years-old.\n\nIn 1958, Jones was born in West Lafayette, Indiana. West Lafayette is a college town, primarily known as the home of Purdue University. Jones' father was the engineer John Paul Jones, who was at that time a faculty board member at Purdue University. Jones' mother was Mary Paula Tweel, a Lebanese-American zoology student.\n\nJones spend the first few years of her life in Charleston, West Virginia, where her family had settled. Around 1963, the Jones family moved to Playa Del Rey, California. Her father had accepted a job in aerospace engineering in California, and was eager to relocate to the West Coast. The marriage of Jones's parents soon deteriorated, and they were already divorced by 1965.\n\nIn 1964, Jones made her debut at television commercials. She was only 6-years-old at the time. She begun pursuing acting roles in 1965. She had her big break in 1966, when cast in a co-starring role in the new sitcom \"Family Affair\". She was 8-years-old at the time, but she was cast in the role of a 6-year-old. Jones was unusually short for her age, and she reportedly looked younger than her actual age.\n\nJones soon became a popular child actress, and she made several guest appearances in other television series. She served as a guest host in the variety show \"The Hollywood Palace\",. She was also interviewed in the talk shows \"The Mike Douglas Show\" and \"The Merv Griffin Show\". She made her film debut in 1969, with a small part in the drama film \"The Trouble with Girls\". The film's main star was Elvis Presley, in one of his last acting roles. The film depicted the murder of a pharmacist in Iowa, and the efforts of a band manager to profit from the crime.\n\n\"Family Affair\" ended in 1971, leaving Jones without a regular role for the first time in her acting career. Despite auditioning for various roles over the following years, she was nearly always rejected. Her acting career ended at the age of 12. In 1976, Jones was still living in California and had a regular boyfriend.\n\nOn August 27, 1976, Jones went partying with her friends in the beach town of Oceanside, California. The following day, Jones was found dead at the home of Helen Hennessy, a close friend. An autopsy revealed that she had consumed a combination of cocaine, PCP, Quaalude, and Seconal. A small vial of blue liquid was found next to her corpse, but the police could not determine what it was. Jones was given a small, private funeral service. Her remains were cremated, and her ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFollowing Jones' death, Dr. Don Carlos Moshos was arrested for illegally prescribing Seconal to Jones. Moshos died in late December 1976, while still awaiting his trial. In 1979, a court decision forced Moshos' estate to make compensations payments to Jones' surviving relatives. Jones' last surviving relative (her mother) died in January 2012. Jones is long gone, but is still fondly remembered for her sitcom role.\n\nMeredith Lynn MacRae was born on May 30, 1944, in Houston, Texas. She was born on a military base where her father was stationed.\n\nMeredith was bitten by the show business bug at an early age. Her father, Gordon MacRae was a singer and movie idol of the 1950s (Rodgers & Hammerstein's Oklahoma (1955) and Karussell (1956)), and her mother, Sheila MacRae, is an actress/comedienne and author, who is probably best known as Alice Kramden (1966-1970), during the 2nd incarnation of Jackie Gleason's The Jackie Gleason Show (1966) (aka \"The Honeymooners\").\n\nAt the age of eight, Meredith started her own acting career and appeared in the film Heiratet Marjorie? (1953), which starred her father.\n\nShe attended UCLA and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. In 1964, she married Richard Berger, former president of MGM. They divorced four years later.\n\nMeredith went on to starring roles in two of television's heyday family sitcoms: Petticoat Junction (1963) and Meine drei Söhne (1960). She also guest starred in many other television shows including: Fantasy Island (1977), Magnum (1980), Detektiv Rockford - Anruf genügt (1974), and Webster (1983) (the highest rated episode ever). She also appeared in several movies and had a brief singing career.\n\nIn 1969, Meredith married actor Greg Mullavey (Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (1976) and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1973). They had one daughter, Allison, born in 1974. Greg and Meredith divorced in 1992 but remained friends.\n\nIn 1995, Meredith married Philip Neal, Chairman and CEO of Avery-Dennison.\n\nIn 1999, she was diagnosed with cancer. In 2000, due to complications from multiple surgeries and allergic reactions to medications (which caused her brain to swell), Meredith Lynn MacRae departed this life.\n\nMissouri born-and-bred Betty Ann Lynn was born in Kansas City. Her name is as light, breezy and innocent as the characters she played on film and TV. She is pleasantly remembered for playing TV's sweet-as-apple-pie \"Thelma Lou,\" who had the tough end of the bargain as the ever-patient girlfriend of Don Knotts's neurotic \"Barney Fife\" character on The Andy Griffith Show (1960). It took a second reunion decades later to finally get those two characters married. While Betty enjoyed other entertainment outlets such as film and the stage, it is her \"Thelma Lou\" character which will remain indelibly etched in the minds of all her many faithful fans.\n\nBetty came from a musical background as the daughter of a singer and began her career as a young teen performing in both supper clubs and on Broadway; in such musical productions as \"Walk with Music\" (1940) and \"Oklahoma!,\" the latter as a dancing replacement. She even entertained the troops with her light soprano at USO tent shows towards the end of World War II. In the late 1940s, after being \"discovered\" in the short-lived Broadway production of \"Park Avenue,\" the fresh-faced Betty was signed on as a starlet for Twentieth Century Fox and appeared in several of their popular movies, billed herself briefly as \"Betty Ann Lynn\" before abruptly dropping her middle name from the credits.\n\nBetty made her movie debut in a small, sprightly role in the classic Clifton Webb comedy Belvedere räumt auf (1948). After another minor part in Eine Dachkammer für zwei (1948), she earned a featured part playing kid sister to Barbara Bates in Die Braut des Monats (1948) starring Bette Davis and Robert Montgomery. She continued the momentum, all in a same airy vein, as the bobby-soxer daughter of stars Loretta Young in Mother Is a Freshman (1949) and Fred MacMurray and Maureen O'Hara in Father Was a Fullback (1949). After appearing again in pictures starring Clifton Webb and Bette Davis (Im Dutzend billiger (1950) and Die Ehrgeizige (1951), respectively), her blossoming film career lost major ground. Betty instead focused on 50s TV and also returned to the stage with a production of \"The Moon Is Blue\" (1954). She still appeared occasionally on the larger screen but, for the most part, was either unbilled or the pictures themselves were obscure. While on hiatus from the Disney series, \"Texas John Slaughter\" (1959), Betty tested and won the recurring role of Deputy Barney Fife's steady girl on Andy Griffith's homespun series. She became part of the small-town ensemble for five seasons -- until Knotts officially left the series to try out, full-time, in motion pictures. The producers were thinking of keeping her on the show but Betty felt her role was incomplete, without her connection to Don Knotts, after Barney Fife left.\n\nTV work continued, never straying far from her wholesome image, with recurring roles on Lieber Onkel Bill (1966) and Meine drei Söhne (1960) and guest parts on Katy (1963), The Smith Family (1971) and Unsere kleine Farm (1974). After a 1978 part on an episode of Barnaby Jones (1973), little was seen of her until she rejoined the Mayberry cast for a reunion in the TV movie Return to Mayberry (1986). In the same year, Andy Griffith hired her to play his secretary in a handful of episodes for his Matlock (1986) series. Betty's last acting role on TV occurred in 1990 and, save for a stage appearance in \"Love Letters\" in 2002 opposite another former Mayberry resident Howard Morris, she officially left acting.\n\nResiding in the same West Hollywood home since 1950, she moved out of state to Mount Airy, North Carolina - the primary real-life inspiration for the fictional Mayberry. The never-married former actress lived in a retirement community there till her death on October 16, 2021 at the age of 95.\n\nPretty, auburn-haired actress Aneta Louise Corsaut was born in Hutchinson, Kansas on November 3, 1933. She majored in drama at Northwestern University and studied acting with Lee Strasberg, considered by some to be the father of method acting in America. Aneta dropped out in her junior year to pursue a career in acting.\n\nAneta guest-starred in two TV shows during 1955: live program Producers' Showcase (1954) and the Robert Montgomery-hosted drama Robert Montgomery Presents (1950). She didn't make her feature film debut until 1958, when she starred in the cult science fiction favorite Blob - Schrecken ohne Namen (1958) opposite Steve McQueen.\n\nAneta's best-known role came about in 1963, when she first appeared on The Andy Griffith Show (1960) as independent and self-sufficient schoolteacher Helen Crump. Aneta stayed on the show until its end in 1968, and reprised her role in the spin-off series Mayberry R.F.D. (1968), the made-for-TV movie Return to Mayberry (1986), and the reunion special Andy Griffith Show Reunion (1993).\n\nBesides her role as the heroine in 'The Blob', Anita Corsaut regrettably didn't appear in many feature films. She had a role in video nasty Der Killer mit der Bohrmaschine (1978), as well as uncredited appearances in Leih mir deinen Mann (1964), Nymphomania (1965), and Der wilde wilde Westen (1974). She did, however, appear in many TV shows, including Bumpers Revier (1975), Adam-12 (1968), House Calls (1979), Matlock (1986) (starring none other than Andy Griffith!), and General Hospital (1963), as well as guest appearances on a dozen others.\n\nMs. Corsaut battled cancer in her later years, and sadly died of the disease on November 6, 1995 at the age of 62. She will be remembered as Helen Crump.\n\nHope Summers could portray a friendly neighbor or companion as she did for Frances Bavier's Aunt Bee character on many episodes of The Andy Griffith Show (1960) or a seemingly amiable satanist in Rosemaries Baby (1968).\n\nBorn in Mattoon, Illinois, she developed an early interest in the theater. Graduating from Northwestern School of Speech in Evanston, Illinois, she subsequently taught speech and diction there. This, in turn, led to her the head position in the Speech Department at Bradley University in Peoria, Illinois, teaching students privately on the side as well. In the 1930s Hope began to focus on acting. She found work in community and stock theaters in Illinois and earned some notice for putting on one-woman shows such as \"Backstage of Broadway.\" She made use of her vocal eloquence by building up her resumé on radio, performing in scores of dramatic shows, including \"Authors' Playhouse,\" \"First Night,\" \"Ma Perkins\", and \"Step-Mother\".\n\nIn 1950 Hope transferred her talents to the new medium of television and earned a regular role on the comedy series Hawkins Falls, Population 6200 (1950). By the age of 50 she was customarily called upon to play slightly older than she was, appearing in a number of minuscule matron roles in such films as 714 antwortet nicht (1957), Hound-Dog Man (1959), Wer den Wind sät (1960), Sommer der Erwartung (1963), The Ghost and Mr. Chicken (1966), Der große Coup (1973) and her last, Eine ganz krumme Tour (1978). She never had any major stand-out roles in movies; TV would be a more prolific choice of medium. Her gently stern, old-fashioned looks allowed her to be a part of many small-town settings, including Dennis, Geschichten eines Lausbuben (1959) and Petticoat Junction (1963), and in various western locales such as Maverick (1957) and Wagon Train (1957).\n\nShe played a rustic regular for many years on Westlich von Santa Fe (1958). Usually assigned to play teachers, nurses and other helpful, nurturing types, her characters were also known to be inveterate gossips. Hope worked until close to the end of her life, passing away from heart failure in 1979."
