        "text": "George Montgomery, a Westerner to the core, who went from prizefighter to stuntman to cowboy star before turning his energies to sculpture, furniture-making and painting, died on Tuesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 84.\n\nThe rugged, soft-spoken actor was also well known as half of one of Hollywood's most visible couples in the 1940's and 50's, when he was married to the singer Dinah Shore.\n\nAfter making dozens of B westerns in the 30's and early 40's, often appearing under his actual name, George Letz, Mr. Montgomery was signed by 20th Century Fox, which planned to turn him into a major star. It was then that he began to use Montgomery, his real middle name. At Fox, he appeared with Betty Grable in ''Coney Island'' (1943), Ginger Rogers in ''Roxie Hart'' (1942), Gene Tierney in ''China Girl'' (1942), Maureen O'Hara in ''10 Gentlemen From West Point'' (1942) and even in a musical, ''Three Little Girls in Blue'' (1946), opposite June Haver.\n\nWhile Mr. Montgomery drew praise for his straightforward performance as detective Philip Marlowe in ''The Brasher Doubloon'' (1947), based on Raymond Chandler's ''High Window,'' he was never really able to break free from the public's view of him as a cowboy star. And it was to the saddle that he returned in the 1950's and 60's in more than three dozen roles whose titles tell the story, from ''Dakota Lil'' (1950) to ''Masterson of Kansas'' in 1954 to ''Toughest Gun in Tombstone'' in 1958.\n\nPerhaps it is telling that once Mr. Montgomery began producing and directing his own films in the 1960's, he never once cast himself as a cowboy. Instead, he enjoyed setting the films, often World War II adventures, in exotic locations in Africa and Asia.\n\nOne of Mr. Montgomery's bronze sculptures showed Ronald Reagan on horseback. He had been a close friend of the former president for decades, and Nancy Reagan issued a statement on Wednesday on the couple's behalf. ''Ronnie and I have known him for so many years that it will be hard to imagine him gone,'' she said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
