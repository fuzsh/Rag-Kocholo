        "text": "1946 - 1947\n\nThe Ford Dealers' Association turn to pretty Dinah Shore to help sell cars\n\nHenry Ford will go down in history as the man who put America (perhaps the whole world) on four wheels. Ford's real gift to modern society was more than the cars or the assembly-line manufacturing process that helped to make the cars affordable. The cars, however, would have a lasting and indelible impact on American society.\n\nFord's climb to dominance in the automotive industry had a shaky beginning. Henry began as a backyard tinkerer with an affinity for mechanics and created some very interesting horseless carriages. Business sense took a while to arrive, his first company would go on after he left to become Cadillac, and the major investors in his second company, the Dodge brothers, would jump ship to form their own car company.\n\nThe Ford Motor Company would produce several different models between 1903 and 1908 but struck gold with the 1908 Model T. Certainly nothing fancy, the Model T was a simple and robust design that allowed it to be sold for a relatively low price. More importantly, the design was suitable for the standardization needed for assembly line production, further reducing the price of the vehicle.\n\nThe Model T was such a success that Ford waited until 1927 to produce a new model. In 1932, they launched the first affordably priced car with a V-8 engine. The Great Depression forced the company to lay-off workers which would lead to violent protests at some of Ford's Detroit plants.\n\nWith the coming of the War, Ford would become part of the foundation of \"the Arsenal of Democracy\". The company would produce 270,000 Jeeps, 390,000 tanks, more than 8,000 B-24 Liberator bombers, and countless machine tools, parts, and gun mounts. Before the War was even over, the Ford Motor Company was making plans to retool and produce the cars that returning G.I.s were going to want to buy.\n\nOf course, the other American automobile companies wanted a piece of that market, and the post-War Prosperity led to a Golden Age of American Automobiles. Ford turned to the Radio Waves to help keep their company name in the minds of car buyers, and in the fall of 1946, the Ford Dealers' Association hired Dinah Shore to host The Ford Show.\n\nBorn Fannye Rose Shore, she contracted polio as a small child. Mama Shore nursed the young girl through the frightening disease with bed rest, therapeutic massage, and a series of exercises. Having operatic aspirations of her own, she also sang with her daughter to help keep her spirits up. Fannye survived with a slight limp, and eventually entered Vanderbilt University in Nashville. She visited the Grand Ol' Opry and made her radio debut on WSM, adopting the professional name of Dinah.\n\nDinah moved to New York, was hired by WNEW (where she sang with Sinatra), and signed a recording contract with RCA Victor. She was featured on programs on NBC and CBS but really began to climb to fame on Time to Smile. Dinah was a popular addition to several AFRS programs and USO shows. She would host her own shows for Bristol-Myers and Birdseye Frozen Foods before being hired by the Ford Dealers in the fall of 1946.\n\nThe Ford Show was built around Dinah's sunny personality as much as her singing. Music was provided by the Ford Orchestra (a.k.a. The Robert Dolan Orchestra every other night of the week) and guests would include Lily Pons, William Bendix, Dennis Day, Gene Kelly, and others. Although Dinah got to demonstrate her comedic timing, most of the comedic duties were left to her \"second banana\", Peter Lind Hayes.\n\nDinah and The Ford Show parted ways after the 1947 season. The Automobile Company turned to Ford Theatre and Fred Allen to tout their radio presence. After taking some time to work in TV and movies, Dinah would return to NBC Radio in March 1953 to encourage buyers to \"See the U.S.A. – In Your Chevrolet!\""
