        "text": "Celebrate your individuality at The Dinah. From September 25-29, visitors from across the globe will travel to Greater Palm Springs for a slew of crowd-pleasing musical performances and unforgettable pool parties. The Dinah, produced by Club Skirts, is a celebration of women and the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIt’s an opportunity to connect, feel empowered, and just have fun. The annual extravaganza is celebrating its 33rd year. All the events take place at Margaritaville Resort & Spa in Palm Springs, which serves as the host hotel. See this guide to start planning your weekend of fun!\n\nTHE WOMAN BEHIND THE MUSIC\n\nMariah Hanson may not be a household name, but the event’s founder and producer has been primarily responsible for securing the line-up of musical acts for the festivities. Over the years she’s shown a knack for finding the next big thing before they were a big thing.\n\nLook at some of the names on the list that have headlined The Dinah: Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Lizzo, Ke$ha, Bebe Rexha, Iggy Azalea, Tegan and Sara, Indigo Girls, Salt-N-Pepa, and Meghan Trainor, just to name a few.\n\nHanson also developed something called the Emerging Artist Contest, which happens every year for unsigned artists to get a chance to express themselves and gain some exposure.\n\n“The Dinah’s musical lineup strives to present the boldest and best in queer or queer-friendly music, focusing on signed artists who are either breaking out or have achieved an impressive level of success,” Hanson said. “But so many unsigned artists wanted to play The Dinah, so I developed the Emerging Artist Contest, which showcases unsigned artists.”\n\nTHE HEADLINERS\n\nThe festival is dubbed “The Largest Girl Party Music Festival in The World” and is known for its impressive musical line-up, which always includes a mix of mainstream LGBTQ+ artists. The festival kicks off with one of its main events — the Black and White Ball —that will feature Lauren Jauregui. The multi-platinum Cuban-American performer was a member of the girl group Fifth Harmony. But Jauregui is just the tip of the musical iceberg.\n\nThe rest of the five-day festival includes:\n\nIniko: A proud non-binary artist, they have amassed a seven-digit following on TikTok that has eclipsed 4 million followers including breakout hits like “Jericho” and “The King’s Affirmation.” The Brooklyn-based pop singer will take center stage at the Saturday night Hollywood Party.\n\nKiNG MALA: The L.A.-based alternative pop artist will hit the stage during the Saturday pool party.\n\nLauren Sanderson: Known as a rule-breaking queer artist, her self-love anthem “They Won’t Like This” has been making a lot of noise. Sanderson will perform during the Hollywood Party.\n\nWhitney Peyton: Playing during the Friday afternoon pool party to kick off the festivities, Peyton is a Grammy Award-winning rapper.\n\nSherrelle Holmes and Lucy & La Mer: They will combine to headline the Sunday pool party. Both are queer artists that participated in the 2023 Emerging Artists Contest and made such an impression that Hanson added them to the 2024 festival.\n\nEVENT SCHEDULE AND TICKETS\n\nFrom pool parties with surprise celebrity appearances to dancing into the wee hours of the night, The Dinah always delivers memorable moments. This year is no exception. By day it’s poolside shenanigans that include splashing, dancing to live DJs, games, contests, vendor fairs, and celebrity meet-and-greets. By night it’s showing off your moves at a dance party to a mix of emerging and well-established artists and grabbing a good spot to watch the celebrity-studded red carpet arrivals.\n\nThese events have individual tickets, but an attendee can buy a festival pass for $350 which provides admission to everything.\n\nWednesday, September 25:\n\nThe official Dinah pre-party at Chill Bar on Arenas Road from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. This event is complimentary to all attendees. Dancing, mingling, celebrities ... the usual good stuff.\n\nThursday, September 26:\n\nThe Dinah official opening party is held at Reforma Night Club in Palm Springs from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. Tickets at the door are $40.\n\nFriday, September 27:\n\nThe Girl Spot Friday Pool Party at Margaritaville main pool. Whitney Peyton will perform. The event is from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. Tickets are $80 at the door.\n\nThe Black and White Ball features a headlining concert from Lauren Jauregui at the Margaritaville Desert Rose Ballroom. The event is from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. with star-studded red Carpet arrivals at 9:30 p.m. Tickets are $100 at the door.\n\nSaturday, September 28:\n\nThe L Word Pool Party features the music of KiNG MALA and a celebrity dodgeball game. It’s from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Margaritaville main pool. Tickets are $100 at the door.\n\nThe Hollywood Party features headliners Iniko and Lauren Sanderson. It’s from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. with a red carpet at 9:30 p.m. Tickets are $100 at the door.\n\nSunday, September 29\n\nThe Lucky Sunday Pool Party. From 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sherrelle Holmes and Lucy & La Mer will perform. Tickets are $70 at the door.\n\nThe Dinah official Closing Night Party. At a location still to be determined with the winner of the emerging artists contest performing. The event is from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. and tickets are $40 at the door.\n\nFor all the details and to purchase tickets, go to thedinah.com/party-events.\n\nWHERE TO STAY\n\nMargaritaville in Palm Springs is the host hotel for The Dinah. As of August 1, there are still rooms available. If you want to be part of the action, reserve your room ASAP before they all sell out - because they will.\n\nBut, there are plenty of other hotels nearby within walking distance or a quick Uber ride away.\n\nArrive Palm Springs: You can walk to all The Dinah events from this fun and modern hotel with a pool, restaurant, and poolside bar.\n\nDays Inn: This hotel is a short stroll from all The Dinah events and includes all the expected comfort and amenities from a well-known chain.\n\nHilton Palm Springs: This resort is in the heart of Palm Springs and within walking distance of restaurants and shopping. It has a posh pool area with great views of the San Jacinto Mountains.\n\nHyatt Palm Springs: This area staple has a splash-worthy pool deck, an outdoor bar/lounge, and private balconies with picturesque views of either the San Jacinto mountains or palm trees.\n\nSkylark: This restored 28-room mid-century era hotel, is anchored by a pool at the center of the property and provides a free buffet breakfast daily.\n\nThe Rowan: Kimpton’s The Rowan is in the middle of all the downtown Palm Springs action and has one of the best views of Greater Palm Springs from the 7th-floor rooftop where you will find the pool, restaurant 4 Saints, and the High Bar.\n\nHELPFUL TIPS\n\nIf you like to be part of the action and avoid FOMO, stay at the host hotel, or one within walking distance or a short Uber ride away. If you plan to attend more than a couple of The Dinah events, opt for the Dinah Festival Pass which includes entrance to all the events - rather than purchasing tickets a la carte.\n\nAdd one extra day to your itinerary to explore all Greater Palm Springs has to offer.\n\nYou can’t leave the area without a little culture from the Palm Springs Art Museum, an amazing panoramic view atop the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway, or checking out amazing animals at the Living Desert. Last but not least: Remember to bring your reusable water bottle, lots of sunscreen, and enough swimsuits to cover multiple parties."
