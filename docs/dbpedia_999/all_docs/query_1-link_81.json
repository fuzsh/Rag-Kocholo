        "text": "Loved it!\n\nGreat book, loved hearing about the life of Dinah Shore. Liked the narrator too. if you're a fan, don't miss this one!\n\nGreat Biography\n\nWould you recommend this audiobook to a friend? If so, why?\n\nYes..anyone who's a fan would love this.\n\nWhat about Pam Dougherty’s performance did you like?\n\nHer voice is very clear and she just adds something more to the story.\n\nWas this a book you wanted to listen to all in one sitting?\n\nDidn't read all at once.\n\nA delightful remembrance\n\nThis was a wonderfully done biography and an enjoyable listen.\n\nI remember Dinah Shore from my younger days when my parents would watch her on TV. I remember looking forward to watching her on special days when we didn't have school (snow days, holidays, sick days). It was always a special treat to watch her show.\n\nIt was entertaining to learn more about her career and her life. The author does a nice job of taking us from her childhood trough her struggles on radio and finally on to TV and the big screen. The story is a wonderful reminder of those that worked hard and achieved.\n\nI am glad I listened to this biography. Mrs. Shore is an important part of the early TV days and how the media evolved. It is a far cry from what passes for \"entertainment\" today. The values she represented in her professional life are admirable and should stand as a reminder of a better time.\n\nWhile Mrs. Shore was not a perfect person, to this day she represents a standard of professionalism and excellence that is worthy of our remembrance.\n\nI recommend this audio book.\n\nThis audiobook was given by the author, narrator, or publisher at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review via Audiobook Boom.\n\nA great lady!\n\nWhat did you love best about Miss Dinah Shore?\n\nShe always wanted you to feel at home with her.\n\nWhat was one of the most memorable moments of Miss Dinah Shore?\n\nWhen she broke up with George and wouldn't bad mouth him.\n\nWhat about Pam Dougherty’s performance did you like?\n\nPam's knowledge of the characters made them come alive and believable.\n\nDid you have an extreme reaction to this book? Did it make you laugh or cry?\n\nIt made me want to be a better person.\n\nAny additional comments?\n\n\"I was voluntarily provided this review copy at no charge by the author, publisher and or narrator.”\n\nMiss Dinah Shore\n\nMiss Dinah Shore: A Biography\n\n: Michael B. Druxman\n\nAn unauthorized biography of Dinah Shore. I have vague memories of her tv shoe from when I was growing up. I did learn some things I didn't know about her. It was an interesting listen.\n\nThe narration was well done. Pam Dougherty did well and in places even a bit of a Tennessee accent.\n\n\"I was voluntarily provided this review copy audiobook at no charge by the author, publisher and/or narrator.\""
