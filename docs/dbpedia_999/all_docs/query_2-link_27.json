        "text": "This is a 1956 Lydia Lane article where songstress DInah Shore talks about a bunch of beauty stuff. Enjoy!\n\nEVERYONE agrees that Dinah Shore is more attractive now than ever before. “I never stop trying to improve myself,” the songster from Nashville admitted with a little laugh. “I have never felt that I was pretty, so I’ve always experimented and tried to get as much helpful advice as possible. “Of course, everyone would like to be born beautiful,” Dinah said. “But when you are not, -you must try to accept the assets you do have and be cheerful about it. Analyze yourself, be realistic and make any changes you feel may help. Sometimes a girl who is not pretty will feel she has to make up for her lack of beauty by being the life of a party when this isn’t her true personality at all. Whatever makes you feel comfortable will always make the best impression with others. ‘\n\n“It is surprising what you can do toward improving yourself if you really work at it. I’ve tried a lot of tricks,” Dinah continued, “and learned by trial and error. I’ve tried plucking my eyebrows and extending their natural line and I’ve shaped my mouth in various outlines, but in the end 1 was convinced that simplicity and the natural look were the best for me. “That is, with one exception.” Dinah added. “I find that being a blonde is more becoming o me than my natural shade of hair. I love to spend .a lot of time in the sun and when I have a tanned skin, my light hair presents a more flattering contrast. But when you do bleach your hair you must be careful to protect it from the suq. “1 used to feel that 1 could wear my hair one way,” Dinah said. “But with my weekly NBC-TV show we needed more variety and 1 am delighted because I discovered that changing my hairdo gives me the same kind of lift as buying a new hat. “Now 1 wear my hair piled high or parted in the middle, page boy, chignon and sometimes in bangs. One thing 1 do try to avoid, however, is too many curls. Today the trend is to a casual hairdo. A tight permanent may last longer but it is rarely becoming.”\n\nNOTICING Dinah’s lovely, natural looking makeup as we lunched at the Brown Derby, 1 commented on It, hopeful of a tip or two. “I’ve experimented with make-up,” Dinah obliged, “and have discovered that the big secret of looking natural is to select your powder to match exactly the tone of your skin. The right shade of powder is very important because if it Is too light or too dark it will be conspicuous. “I keep three basic shades of powder on hand and blend them according to the color of my skin. A clean puff Is also essential,” Dinah told me, “because any oil from your skin that is left on your puff will cause your powder to streak. Scrubbing with soap suds and a nail brush is the best way to clean puffs. “I’ve made mistakes before in using rouge, but now I know a pale pink shade in a fluid type rouge gives the most natural effect for me. The whole trend today,” Dinah concluded “is toward naturalness and simplicity in everything.”\n\nAs Dinah was served a patty of meat and sliced tomatoes, I inquired if she might be following a diet. “Oh no,” she said, “I solved my weight problem long ago by learning to eat well-balanced meals. I keep a scale in my bathroom and weigh myself each morning before I dress. Sometimes my weight fluctuates as much as four pounds, so the real .test with me is how my cl6thes feel. The moment a skirt is too snug, I cut down immediately. The trick is to. do something about it right then, without delay. “It isn’t necessary,” Dinah continued, “to put yourself on a strict diet. Just cut down on every meal. Instead of two pieces of toast for breakfast, take only one. Have a salad for lunch instead of a sandwich and ; skip that pat of butter at dinner.” DINAH highly recommended developing an appreciation for the nutritional value of certain foods. “If you stay away from the fattening foods, you can stay away from starvation diets,” she said. “And you will feel and look so much better.”\n\nA little girl with a southern accent approached Dinah for an autograph. Dinah is well known to the people of Middle Tennessee. Born Fannie Rose Shore in Winchester, Tenn., Dinah later moved to Nashville where she attended Hume-Fogg high school and Vanderbilt university. She started taking voice lessons. However, her activity as a cheerleader at football games did not improve her voice, and two months after the first lesson, Dinah and her singing teacher came to an amiable parting of the ways. Dinah was very friendly and charming to her young admirer. “It’s much easier to reach your objective in life,” Dinah remarked, “if you like people and people like you. I place ‘heart’ before beauty or talent However, if you do have a goal in life, it must be clearly defined. You can’t have faith in arriving some place if you aren’t sure of where you are going. Keep a positive point of view and don’t become discouraged.” ."
