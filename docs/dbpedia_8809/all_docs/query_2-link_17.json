        "text": "It may seem like a tautology, but Trump is popular where he is popular. Such is the case with divisive figures. In order to remain in office, politicians in those areas where Trump is popular feel the need to heed the will of their own personal constiuency and embrace Trump.\n\nTo be fair, an opinion I share is that some of the popularity that Trump receives in no small part comes from how unpopular he is where he is in fact unpopular. That is to say that those who are ardent Trump supporters like him more because of who he upsets and how he goes about it. People running for office in these areas are more than likely going to embrace and hope to emulate the Trump presidential style because it makes them more popular where it actually matters for them. Someone running for congress from Oklahoma probably couldn't care less what Trump's poll numbers in California are. If he is popular in their district then they will continue to support him.\n\nFurther, according to the most recent Gallup Poll Trump maintains 89% job approval within the Republican party. By contrast, Barack Obama's job approval for Democrats in his last week in office was 95% which isn't too far above where Trump is. The two have drastically different approval ratings from Independents, with Trump having 39% most recently and Obama holding 61% in his last week.1\n\nIt is highly possible that the so-called \"Never Trumpers\" in the Republican party are in a tight spot, since they seem to be completely out of step with the rest of the Republican electorate. Many have already fled the Republican party which in cases of states with closed primaries means they have already abdicated any responsibility of helping the party choose the next nominee. Trump's style of always counter-attacking against perceived slights helps to keep all except the most outspoken against him in the party silent out of fear of retribution. This doesn't mean that those who approve of the job Trump is doing wouldn't support another Republican nominee more, but the current signs point to the Republican electorate being solidly behind Trump.\n\nBut will such a scenario repeat itself for 2020? Probably not, given the immense popularity of the most likely Democratic candidates, be that Elizabeth Warren, Beto O'Rourke, or Joe Biden.\n\nI think you could be overestimating those politicians' overall popularity. Donald Trump wasn't supposed to be elected the first time around. I think you make a good point in that Clinton's unpopularity probably did help get him elected, but now that he's in office he is delivering on things that Republican voters want, so why would they switch?\n\n1- For completeness, Trump has 6% job approval from Democrats and Obama had 14% from Republicans.\n\nBecause traditional Republicans can't credibly convert Trump supporters.\n\nThe popular narrative is that Donald Trump's election represents some sort of \"whitelash\" against Democrats, Obama supporters, human decency, etc. But rich racist white people voted for Romney and McCain too.\n\nWe just elected a liberal intellectual African American president. Twice. The people who voted for Obama have not magically vanished.\n\nTrump clearly won on the backs of working-class voters. Of pretty much all races (outperformed the last two Republican candidates among both Hispanics and African Americans). How an outsider managed to capture such a large and valuable demographic is an interesting question in its own right, but I'll give you the Occam's Razor: that demo was being ignored by both major political parties.\n\nThink about it. 50 years ago pretty much all e.g. sitcoms were about working class people. 20 years ago most still were. Now almost none of them are. Working class people have gradually been excluded from cultural relevance. They're not mentioned in media (except as a punchline). For a while they probably didn't really care: they still had enough political clout even as the cultural capital disappeared.\n\nThen the jobs have moved and towns died. Industries changed. No one talked about it, no one cared. A few have used it to prop up a socialist ideology, but I don't think rural working-class Americans distaste for such is citation-worthy at this point. It comes across as blatantly opportunistic: like \"you don't like me or anything I stand for or am but you'll gladly use the @#$%storm my life has become to prop up your point that I disagree with\". No one on the national scene came at it from the perspective of those people, and if anyone in Washington or New York really cares it's awfully hard to see it from podunk.\n\nNow along comes this guy who says, hey I'm for you, I'm going to fight for you, I respect your point of view, I'm going to focus on you unlike these other yahoos...\n\nAnd the sad part, for those who don't like President Trump, is that nothing, nothing has changed about that dynamic since the election. Trump is still the king of his domain. Democrats aren't even an also-ran. They haven't made the first attempt to court those people. They have dismissed them as racists and/or opioid addicts. And there are plenty of Republicans who are going to say eh, I don't like him, but I'd still vote for him ahead of the other side. Even as I edit this in late 2019, even with the scandals currently rocking the administration, re-election is sadly the null hypothesis.\n\nOn the marginalization of working class voters\n\nThere's been some discussion about this in the comments. So to show what I mean, here's an incomplete list of questions that seem (to me, based on living in the Midwest) to be on the minds of working-class voters, no particular order:\n\nWhat if the evidence for global warming is faked, or even just misinterpreted?\n\nWhat if a loss of manufacturing jobs destroys American small towns and the culture they represent?\n\nWhat if that culture is further threatened by waves of immigrants?\n\nOur politicians seem to be an entrenched bureaucracy of people who could broadly be defined as \"not us\". They're not even pretending to care about us anymore. What do we do now?\n\nIn terms of discussion on the national stage, the conversation is pretty lopsided. I frequently see point 4 brought up except the people doing so... aren't exactly the salt of the Earth. Points 2 and 3 are always couched in terms of money (we'll throw them a bone sometime! maybe!) and racism, respectively. It's never talked about in terms of culture/way-of-life. Few are willing to risk the labels that come with the media consensus on climate change. Well, except that one guy...\n\nAnd I'm frankly not sure what to make of all of this. Because while I'm from a small town, I went urban a long time ago and never really looked back. I'm educated, liberal (compared to them), etc. I'm one of the people they complain about. I've become one of the people they complain about. And I like the new culture better than the old. But I also know people. Good people. And I just don't see a crusader for their culture in e.g. Mitt Romney.\n\nAddendum #2: Why we can't have nice things\n\nI should thank the OP. This question is the gift that keeps on giving. In response to my 4 points above, a commenter responded with\n\nWhat if it's not? What if airplane jet trails were really chemicals designed to control the population? What if our leaders are actually lizard men? What if nonsensical what-if-questions were actually pointless?\n\nBetter not vote for free-market Republicans, because Capitalism says you should find new jobs or fade away. Fun fact, the current administration ended programs to help workers displaced by automation get training for in-demand fields.\n\nPeople who immigrated to the US are now worried about immigration? That's just funny.\n\nProbably not vote for billionaire con men.\n\nThink about how that sounds to the average middle American. Think about the message it conveys (regardless of whether or not it's true): you're too stupid to know what's good for you. Think about what the most likely response is. Saying that to someone is not going to make them meekly back down. It doesn't even matter if you're right. You think they're going to listen to someone who's belittling them? They're going to hate you, and they're going to react to you by allying themselves with something they know you hate. You (yes you) are actively encouraging people to vote for Trump. Please, please stop.\n\nDamage to the Party\n\nLike the asker suggested, Trump could be posing damage to the Republican brand. Anytime Republicans oppose Trump on an issue, he publicly disrespects them. He has attacked current and former Republican politicians, pundits, party supporters, and members including John McCain, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck, Jeff Sessions, Jeff Flake, Lindsey Graham, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, Nikki Haley, John Kasich, Megyn Kelly, Karl Rove, Marco Rubio, Charles Krauthammer, the Koch Brothers, the Fox News network, Lisa Murkowski, Sheppard Smith, Scott Walker, and Robert Mueller. Trump has hired and fired some prominent Republicans within the party establishment, including former RNC communications director Sean Spicer, former RNC chairman Reince Priebus, and former Republican senator Jeff Sessions. Some have said the 2018 mid-terms would be a referendum on the public's sentiments towards Trump, and in 2018, Republicans lost the House of Representatives (and by a wider margin than projections predicted) for the first time since 2008, and lost ground on many gubernatorial seats.\n\nThere have been many articles speculating that Trump is doing long-term damage to the Republican brand 1 2 3 4.\n\nBeware of Spoilers\n\nOne consideration missing from other answers is the effect of spoilers during primaries. In the 2016 Republican primary, there were 12 candidates who ran in the primary, and 5 more in the mix who dropped-out before the primary. By most peoples' view, Trump was most unique among the field, whereas many other candidates were part of the tea party establishment, who either held public office as a Republican, or campaigned in previous Republican presidential primaries; and many of them had extremely similar policy positions and messages. In other words, the other 16 candidates were virtual spoilers or clones of each other. This put Trump in a position to dominate many of the earlier primary races, and this advantage of running against a field of clones would persist until the final three candidates (it's fair to say, at this point, that Ted Cruz and moderate John Kasich were as mutually different from one another as they were from Trump). It's been argued that towards the end of a primary process, some party members will get behind the candidate in the lead and give that candidate a big push so that they have big momentum coming out of the primary. If this is true, Trump's lead in pledged electors towards the end of the primary persuaded Republicans to support him more strongly during his final stretch against Cruz and Kasich.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make about spoilers isn't just about 2016, though. The question is... in 2020, will Trump have the same kind of advantage granted by spoilers, or could he have a disadvantage in the form of spoilers? It's always possible that the 2020 Republican primary field could be 4 candidates very similar to Trump (like Steve King, Roy Moore, Matt Gaetz), and only 1 candidate different from Trump's style (like John Kasich, Jeff Flake, or Susan Collins). Part of the reason that I propose this possibility is that more and more Republicans are emulating Trump's politics, meanwhile established party insiders rarely contest the seat of a sitting president. This could mean, in theory, lots of Trump clones, but very few establishment types (like Orrin Hatch, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley). So... Trump's viability in the 2020 primary might be at risk, but there are no guarantees of that either.\n\nWhat Else Can Republicans Do?\n\nThere are basically two kinds of recourse I know of to remove Trump from office, which are defeating him in a 2020 party primary, and impeachment. Successfully impeaching Trump would required something like 18 Republican senators voting to convict. Any Republican senator in a heavily red state who voted to convict Trump could expect to face certain defeat in their next re-election. Even in swing states, it is certain that they would not win their next party primary as long as Trump's approval among Republicans is around 89%. Impeachment is not a realistic possibility, because political self-interest will trump any evidence of a crime. Another way of removing the president (but this is not entirely up to the RNC, as per the question) is by invoking Section 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment. This would require the action of the Vice President, and the collaboration of the majority of another body (I wonder if its sufficient to have the VP and the majority of the House of Representatives).\n\nWhenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.\n\nFundraising\n\nThe most likely route to remove Trump from the Republican brand is to defeat him in a 2020 party primary. Another relevant battleground for this primary is going to be fundraising. A challenger to Trump's seat is going to need to gain favor with prominent Republican donors, and attempt to also court traditionally Democratic donors who want to enable a Trump defeat.\n\nHere are some top relevant donors in the 2018 election cycle according to opensecrets\n\nTop organization Republican donors: Las Vegas Sands, Adelson Drug Clinic, Uline Inc, American Action Network, Senate Leadership Fund, Blackstone Group, and Republican Governors Assocation.\n\nTop organization Democratic donors who also donate substantially to Republicans: None. Some contribute very small amounts to Republicans.\n\nTop Conservative or Moderate Super Pacs: Congressional Leadership Fund, Senate Leadership Fund, New Republican PAC, America First Action, DefendArizona, Club for Growth Action, With Honor Fund, National Assn of realtors, Patients for Affordable Drugs Action\n\nTop PACS who contribute substantially to Republicans (all of these contribute to Democrats as well): National Beer Wholesalers Assn, AT&T Inc, Northrop Grumman, National Assn of Realtors, Sheet Metal Air Rail and Transportation Union, American Bankers Assn, Operating Engineers Union, Credit Union National Assn, Lockheed Martin, etc.\n\nTop Republican individual donors: Sheldon Adelson, Richard Uihlein, Steve and Christine Schwarzman, Kenneth Griffin, Jeff Bezos, and Timothy Mellon.\n\nTop Democratic individual donors who also contribute to Republicans: Michael Bloomberg, Thomas Steyer and Kathryn Fahr, Donald Sussman, James Simons, George Soros, Fred Eychaner, and Deborah Simon.\n\nAlthough the Koch Brothers do not show-up in any of these lists by name, they are also understood to be a consistently large Republican donor, sometimes in amounts of hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nAny challenger to Trump will have to lobby the top donors for their support. In the case of the Koch brothers, the sparring between Trump and the Koch brothers may motivate them to back a different candidate. Jeff Bezos is also not likely to back Trump in 2020, due to souring relations, but he was a big backer in 2016. Michael Bloomberg's opinion of Trump may lead him to back a Republican challenger (although he's shown more interest in actually running against Trump in 2020). Trump's attacks on George Soros make it plausible that Soros could back a Republican challenger. Sheldon Adelson seems to be a steady supporter of Trump. While Richard Uihlein has consistently backed MAGA Republicans like Roy Moore, it seems that he may be getting tired of backing losers and may be rethinking who he gets advice from (Uline Inc will also use its money in the same way). Thomas Streyer supports impeachment of Trump, so he will probably support anyone who can credibly challenge Trump. Donald Sussman donated big money to the Clinton campaign to oppose Trump, so he might support a 2020 challenger. American Action Network has been a big Trump supporter. AT&T looks to be at odds with Trump, but they also paid $600,000 to Michael Cohen.\n\nSupport of Voters\n\nAnything the RNC does to subvert the Trump administration is likely to incur backlash from the party's voters. Before taking its ultimate action (impeachment or whatever else), the party would first need to launch a substantial public relations campaign to become the voters' higher priority in relation to supporting Trump. The most prominent messaging system between the RNC and Republican voters is Fox News; so Fox News and its owner Rupert Murdoch are in a position to pick the winner of this fight. Fox News's coverage of Trump seems to be consistently supportive of him, barring a few exceptions out of thousands of hours of coverage. However, although Rupert Murdoch has a pretty close relationship with Trump, there is also tension within it 1 2. If Murdoch ever decided to shift Fox News coverage in a direction that prioritized the RNC over Trump, it could eventually pave the way for a big move by the RNC against Trump.\n\nWhat you asked is very near opinion, so I will use my own opinion as an example. Keep in mind that I am using my opinions as an example, not to \"support Trump\" but because I think it shows a good example of why Republicans as a whole do not work towards his removal.\n\nAt the last election, I did not vote for Trump, though I do not consider myself Republican or conservative, by traditional means, and I even voted for and mostly liked Obama. However when voting, and during the run-up to the election, I was basically in the \"Anyone but Clinton\" camp. I am still happy that Clinton didn't win.\n\nNow it's a couple of years later, and I am overall happy with Trump's performance as a president. I do wish for a new amendment to the constitution that says President's can't have social media accounts. I do wish he would shut up sometimes, but as far as policy goes, what has gotten done, and what he has worked for is mostly in line with my ideals. Not all of it, but most, and I am happy with that.\n\nIn order for someone to replace Trump, they would have to have the same ideals and ability to get things done, that I want done, while at the same time not looking so terrible on social media.\n\nYou would be very hard pressed to \"sell\" me a democrat at all, right now. Even another Republican would take a very special mix.\n\nDo I support Trump? Not really, but I would rather have him than Clinton, probably another Democrat, and likely any Republican. I don't like him, but things are getting done. That's much better to me then nothing getting done.\n\nSo if the Republican party was to \"oust\" Trump, who could they offer in his place to keep my vote.\n\nHe has an overall 45% approval rating 1 Bush was at 37% 2 Obama was at 46% 3\n\nSay what you want, he seems to have some support.\n\nTrump's unpopularity stems not so much from his actions, as his abrasive NYC personality. New Yorkers tend to be brusque and abrupt in general, a byproduct of the hectic environment they live in. Trump personifies and in some cases amplifies the less pleasant aspects of that.\n\nSo far, his administration has done well in keeping the campaign promises he made - more than a typical president. Many of those promises were nonpartisan, to the benefit of everyone, such as lowering unemployment. And, so far, he hasn't taken any actions that have had a negative impact on a large number of citizens... like Obamacare sending heath care costs through the roof. The tariffs he put in place are designed to persuade other nations not to tax US goods in an inequitable manner, and they appear to be implementing that very persuasion. The EU has already agreed to modify it's taxes, and China is showing signs of making long overdue changes.\n\nWhile Trump may offend some people, he hasn't hurt the nation economically, and that's what really matters to voters in the end. If you look at the critique of Trump in the media, most of it is fairly superficial, a good deal of it is somewhat contrived or exaggerated - catering to an audience predisposed to believe only bad things about Trump. I was no fan of Obama after he sent my health care bill through the roof, but I never thought that justified removing him from office.\n\nIf you ask why the Republicans don't get rid of Trump, it's because there really isn't anything in what he has done, that calls for removal. Those of us who were around in the Nixon era remember the chaos that followed his resignation. Think long and hard before going that route... a lot of unintended consequences.\n\nThe closest parallel I can find is the Clinton/Lewinsky affair. No, that wasn't conduct becoming of a president. However, like Trump's acerbic remarks, that situation didn't materially affect the things that are truly important to most citizens: the state of the economy, and how well their personal financial situation is going. And it comes down to: better the devil you know, than the devil you don't know."
