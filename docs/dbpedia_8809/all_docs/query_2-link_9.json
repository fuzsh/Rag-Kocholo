        "text": "“It’s so hard to keep track of an individual death, isn’t it?” she said. “There are so many deaths, so many injustices, they all blend together.”\n\n“Well, that depends how closely they affect you.”\n\nShe smiled; she had bad teeth. “That’s right,” she said. “It isn’t morality at all, it’s personal convenience, personal emotions. None of us really care how many strangers get killed.”\n\nWell, if you’re going to a cocktail party you have to expect cocktail party conversations. I said, “Naturally, it affects you more if it happens to somebody you know.” And even as I was saying it, I knew I was giving this girl an irresistible opportunity to quote John Donne.\n\nWhich she took. I received the tolling of the bell with my best glazed smile, and she said, “But the point really is morality, isn’t it? People are liberal or conservative these days, they believe in women’s rights or property rights or whatever, some of them are even still ethical, but nobody’s actually moral any more. Nobody hates sin.” Then she nodded, looking amused at herself, and said, “See? People smile if you even use the word sin.”\n\nWas I smiling? Yes, I was. Wiping it off, I tried another catch phrase: “The only sin is getting caught.”\n\nNobody knew what to make of this book when it came out, and to the extent anyone remembers it, they still don’t. It isn’t a novel. It isn’t an anthology of previously published material; short stories, essays, whatever–it contains two stories, neither of which had ever seen the light of day before. A farcical novella about a critic/murderer who turns detective (while still committing murders), followed by a longish short story about a sailor who finds out his ex-wife is a movie star, goes to see her, then goes back to being a sailor. They’re both written in the first person by Donald E. Westlake, and that’s about all they have in common, aside from being in the same book. Or so it seems, anyway.\n\n‘Newgate Callendar,’ still writing his pseudonymous crime fiction column for the New York Times that he inherited from Anthony Boucher, was baffled. He liked the first story a lot–it was what he and most people expected from Westlake–a funny mystery. But the second story, which he admitted was well-written, had no murder mystery in it (well, no dead body, put it that way), no heists, no illegal activity of any kind. It’s not crime fiction by any accepted definition. “What it is doing in this book is anybody’s guess” he wrote. Well, we’re anybody, so let’s guess.\n\nWestlake’s work for M. Evans & Co. was eclectic, to say the least. You really never knew what was coming next. He published ten books with them (not including the western/crime hybrid he co-wrote with Brian Garfield). Except for the two Dortmunders, no one book much resembled any of the others–but they were all at least nominally in the genre he was known for, with the exception of the political thriller Ex Officio, his first book for them, which he published under another name, so nobody got confused by that.\n\nWestlake was producing much less by this time, and the previous year he’d come out with Dancing Aztecs, a sprawling comedy epic, which must have taken longer to write than his usual thing, and had perhaps depleted his energies somewhat.\n\nHe’d finished with Parker, Grofield, Tobin–couldn’t really write as Stark or Coe anymore, at least for the time being. He was probably enjoying the novelty of just being one person for a while. But it was perhaps harder for him to write as much as he used to with only one voice, and the publishing industry still didn’t like putting out too many books by the same author in one year.\n\nHe’d just about run out his string with the ‘Nephew’ books–only so many viable variations in that story. His personal life was more complicated than ever, with two ex-wives, four growing sons, and a new relationship that was heading towards a third and final marriage. It has to have cut into his writing time at least a bit.\n\nYou could say that he simply owed M. Evans a book for that year (1977), so he foisted some odds and ends on them–but he gave them a Dortmunder later that same year. Hard to believe this was a mere contractual obligation volume–particularly since he published nothing with them in the next two years, only to finish off with one last rather head-scratching heist story set in Europe.\n\nWestlake’s relationships with publishers often seem to have soured towards the end, and he’d head off to the next one. You get a shift in personnel at the top, a change in priorities, and all of a sudden the rapport isn’t there anymore. Or maybe his agent got him into another bidding war. He’d had an amazing run there, but it was winding down, along with the 70’s. The 80’s would be–problematic. But we’ll get there.\n\nThe title itself is odd–Enough what? The first story isn’t really long enough for a hardcover mystery, so maybe the second is just to pad things out, so the book buyer would feel it was worth the $7.95 pricetag. I love the cartoon-strip artwork on the cover of the first edition, but it says absolutely nothing about the contents.\n\nNone of the covers ever managed to address both stories, which demonstrates an underlying problem of the book. How many people looking for a nice little comic crime novel really want to stick around for a somber, poignant, and impossible-to-pigeonhole story about a sailor and his starlet ex?\n\nThe dedication reads “For Avram Avakian, fondly, this two-reeler.” Avakian being the guy who made a workmanlike but rather uninspired film from Westlake’s screenplay for Cops and Robbers, which Westlake later turned into an excellent novel. Westlake felt that Avakian was a brilliant film editor who didn’t possess the full skill set to be a successful director.\n\nThe opening quote is from Ambrose Bierce (a favorite writer of Westlake’s, which is an interesting coincidence, since I was mildly obsessed with Bierce as a kid, and didn’t know Westlake was similarly afflicted until well after I started reading him)–it’s from The Devil’s Dictionary–“Enough: too much.” (Or perhaps, two much?)\n\nAnd then there’s a quote from Thomas DeQuincey (who I keep meaning to read), specifically geared towards the first story, which basically says if a man commits murder, this may lead to worse sins, like bad manners.\n\nAllow me to theorize (like anyone can stop me). He normally gave M. Evans two books a year–maybe they didn’t insist on it, but he wasn’t getting paid for books he didn’t produce. Dancing Aztecs had, of necessity, been his sole contribution for ’76. He had a Dortmunder for ’77, but he needed something else.\n\nHe had an idea for a mystery novel, but it wasn’t ‘enough’ for a full-length book. And at some point in time–maybe recently, maybe years before–he’d turned out a short story, that he liked, but couldn’t find a buyer for, because it wasn’t what people expected from him, and it was too long for a magazine. He talked M. Evans into publishing them both in the same volume. That way with the Dortmunder published shortly afterwards he’d have two books for ’77–not much, for him–but enough. And then he published no books at all for over two years. Well, I didn’t say it would be a flawless theory.\n\nWe can’t discount the possibility that Westlake did think there was a link between these two stories, different as they are. That one served as counterpoint to the other, and of course they’re both about identity, because that’s what he writes about. Probably a few years earlier, he’d have published the second story under a pseudonym, but he was fresh out of pseudonyms. Maybe he wanted to remind people yet again that Westlake wasn’t just the comic caper guy.\n\nAnd maybe I’ve speculated long enough about Enough. I debated about whether to review the two stories in it together or separately, and mainly decided on the latter because in subsequent editions they were often published separately, particularly overseas.\n\nThe second story actually got a film adaptation, many years later, in France–which must have come as a surprise to Mr. Westlake. It would have come as a surprise to ‘Newgate Callendar’ as well, but he’d died the year before. Really no surprise a part-time mystery reviewer and full-time music critic liked the first story better–the protagonist is, after all, a critic who solves mysteries, while bedding luscious ladies, outsmarting (and cuckolding) befuddled homicide detectives. Seriously, show me a critic who’ll give that story a bad review.\n\nCarey Thorpe is another of Westlake’s unapologetic cads–in many ways reminiscent of Art Dodge in Two Much. But he has a somewhat more conventional profession–he’s a film critic, moderately successful, who writes semi-scholarly articles for various obscure film journals, as well as reviewing recent releases for a small Manhattan weekly called The Kips Bay Voice (for those who are not Gothamites, Kips Bay is a neighborhood on the east side of Manhattan, just below 34th, and since the British used it to land their invading forces during the Revolutionary War, has never been known for much of anything other than absurdly high rents).\n\nAs we meet him, he is standing over the dead body of one of his two girlfriends, Laura Penney. They had quarreled, and he hit her, and she hit her head on her own coffee table, and is no more among the living. If this were the vibrant J. Morgan Cunningham writing this, he’d say the manner of her passing was almost a cliché, but this is a murder mystery novel, let’s remember.\n\nThing is, nobody knew he and Laura were sexually intimate–they were seen at various social events, screenings and such, but because he has a somewhat more serious girlfriend, Kit Markowitz, and he wanted to date both of them at once without either of them knowing, he’s created the illusion that when he’s seen with the other it’s only for the purposes of having somebody on his arm at the aforementioned social events. The quarrel that led to Laura’s death was a byproduct of this deception.\n\nCarey, who is separated from his wife Shirley (only an offstage character in this play), doesn’t sound to be all that much of a hunk, but he’s clever and charming enough to talk his way into bed with any number of desirable females, though talking his way out again is a more challenging proposition, as many a rake has learned.\n\nHe’s been under a lot of stress from work and multiple bedmates and insufficient funds and an estranged wife who wants his head on a platter (which ties neatly into the insufficient funds thing), and he’s been taking a lot of valium, which allows him a somewhat more abstracted view of his increasingly dire situation (maybe a bit too abstracted).\n\nBut even when he’s not popping pills, he’s never going to be the soul of compassion. His main agenda here is going to be to make sure he doesn’t take the rap for Laura’s death, so he tidies up the crime scene a bit, and makes his exit. When two police detectives greet him at Laura’s apartment (he’s keeping the date he knows she put in her appointment book, because it would look suspicious if he didn’t), and inform him of her demise, he is suitably horrified–and rather surprised to find that as the investigation proceeds, neither of them seriously suspects him. They’re nothing like the police detectives in the movies he reviews.\n\nCarey thinks of everything in terms of movies–when somebody buzzes him into Laura’s apartment, and just for a moment he thinks she’s alive, he starts envisioning Gene Tierney. The first detective, named Bray, reminds him of Dana Andrews–he wonders if that makes him Clifton Webb. The second detective, Fred Staples, doesn’t remind him of anybody, but he, surprisingly, is a fan of Carey’s reviews in the Kip’s Bay Voice. He says his wife loves them too. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n\nFor a short book, this one has a lot of plot twists, and I don’t have the patience to cover them all. I’ll list a few–there’s a blackmailing private detective (working for a company called Tobin-Global, and let me just say, this story makes me miss Tucker Coe very badly), who was tailing Carey on behalf of his wife, and wants ten grand to keep quiet. Carey liquidates every asset he has, then actually robs a bank to get most of the rest–then realizing the detective has set himself up as an ideal suspect that Carey could finger in turn, makes him give the money back.\n\nAs if things weren’t complicated enough already, Carey is rather effortlessly seduced by Fred Staples’ outwardly placid and domestic blonde wife Patricia, while Carey is screening Gaslight for her (Gaslight becomes their code word for sex). Contrary to his first impressions, she turns out to be a total narcissist, and a really incredible lay. He knows this is a bad idea, screwing the wife of a detective investigating a murder he himself committed, but he just can’t seem to stop acting on bad ideas.\n\nIn the meantime, the private detective (who reminds Carey of Martin Balsalm in Psycho), unwilling to play the patsy, refuses to go away quietly, and you know that recurring line from the Parker novels about how you shouldn’t make murder the answer to everything? Seems like Carey never read any Parker novels, and that line never made it into any of the movie versions. And private detectives rarely come off well in Donald Westlake novels.\n\nSo is that the end of his problems? Alas, no. Because the detectives suspect his favorite girlfriend, Kit Markowitz, of murdering Laura in a fit of jealous rage. She doesn’t have an alibi, and once they question her, the indignant Kit decides to play girl detective–she even throws a party (with Carey’s help) where she invites all the potential suspects.\n\nThat’s where the little exchange up top occurs, Carey talking to a woman who showed up with two gay male friends–who just got married in San Francisco–interesting little bit of social data there, we tend to forget that gay marriage was going on for decades, with varying degrees of legality, long before it became a major national issue. The dialogue rather reminded me of Woody Allen’s Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989), which only goes to show that Carey is not the only one out there who is constantly making connections with movies. God is a luxury Carey can’t afford either, not that he ever brings up religion.\n\nUnfortunately for Kit, she turns out to be a pretty good detective after all, and she figures out who the killer is–and rather inexplicably, chooses to tell him that in private. Now this is a major problem with the story. Are we supposed to believe the otherwise bright and perceptive Kit is so engrossed in her role as detective that she thinks Carey will simply turn himself in, or the police will break in just in the nick of time–or that she’ll have a hold on him, to keep him from straying in future? None of the above happens, and he feels just terrible about what he does next, but in for a dime…..\n\nSo this is all entertaining enough, but frankly it’s rather sub-par Westlake, full of characters that are intentionally tissue-paper thin (this is a farce, after all, but Westlake doesn’t normally use that as an excuse for poor characterization). And yet for all that, it’s still worth reading, and it’s worth asking why.\n\nThe central gimmick, what sets the story apart, is that in the midst of trying to avoid being identified as the murderer, and committing two further murders (and a minor bank heist) towards that end, Carey finds out he’s a far better detective than he ever was a film critic.\n\nFred Staples is just delighted to pal around with (as he sees it) a celebrity, and Carey wants to keep an eye on him and his partner to make sure they don’t get the right idea about him. So he accompanies them on another case, and he just happens to solve it–in that way that fictional detectives in bad mystery stories so often do. Just spots something the professionals missed.\n\nIt’s not something he particularly wanted to happen, it’s not something he ever aspired to do. He just wants to attend film screenings, write articles, go to bed with pretty girls, and live a generally shallow meaningless pleasure-filled existence, like any civilized man who reads Esquire.\n\nBut having done it once, to Fred’s awestruck delight, Carey finds himself in demand as a consulting detective. And over and over, he spots that one little clue that cracks the case. He has a gift for both committing murders and solving them. Go figure.\n\nNow if he actually wanted this to happen, it would be impossibly contrived and far-fetched (like most detective novels), but because it’s just something Carey finds himself doing reflexively, more or less because it’s so damned obvious to him that he can’t keep from speaking up, and because, after all, it’s what detectives are always doing in the movies, you sort of let him slide, because you want to see how far Westlake can stretch this gag out. And he can stretch it pretty damn far.\n\nFirst he solves the mytery of a murdered director, shot while he was screening his own film. Turns out the killer was an aspiring screenwriter whose work was used without attribution. He immediately confesses, as fingered killers so often do in mystery stories, because trials are so messy and time-consuming for dramatic purposes.\n\nThere’s this leitmotif of otherwise sensible people behaving like cheap genre tropes, when they really ought to know better, because they, like Carey, think that’s how you’re supposed to behave in this type of situation–the movies have programmed them. Life imitating bad art, badly.\n\nThen there’s another murder, this one a gay travel writer murdered by a lover–Carey realizes the man put a coded message into what he was writing at his desk when he realized he was in danger. See, the murdered copy-writer refers to Antigua as being right next to St. Martin. They check a map.\n\nWhen he removed his finger, I bent to read the lettering: “Anguilla.”\n\n“Anguilla, Antigua.” Staples shrugged, saying, “He was upset from the argument, that’s all, he just got mixed up.”\n\n“Does that make sense?” I studied Ailburg’s writing again, shaking my head. “No, it doesn’t.” This was his job, he knew what island was where. And look how he broke that sentence, starting a new line after the word ‘charming.’ It looks awkward.”\n\nStaples said, “I don’t see what you’re driving at.”\n\nOnly because you’ve never read Under An English Heaven, officer.\n\nThen there’s a seeming suicide that Carey realizes was a murder (see if you can spot the clue), but he decides not to finger the killer for personal reasons (this one’s a bit of a reference to The Sincerest Form of Flattery, a Westlake short story that appeared in The Curious Facts Preceding My Execution).\n\nAnd finally, a classic locked door mystery at the consulate for some tiny obscure nonexistent Eastern European nation, and I have to confess, Westlake plays fair with all these mysteries, puts in enough information for the reader to solve them all, and I didn’t solve any of them–even on the second reading. Well, I remembered whodunnit, but I didn’t remember how Carey figured it out.\n\n(All the chapters in this book have mystery novel titles, even when they don’t have an actual mystery in them–The Adventure of the Missing R–The Problem of the Copywriter’s Island–The Chainlock Mystery–The Death of the Party–see if you can guess which of these features Carey solving a murder mystery, and which is just him dealing with the complications attendant to his own personal murders).\n\nSo Carey’s rather enjoying being the criminal sociopath’s answer to Ellery Queen, but he’s gotten so wrapped up in playing detective/murderer that he misses the obvious denouement. Fred finds out Carey’s been diddling the missus. So he frames Carey with planted evidence. For murders Carey actually committed.\n\nFred does not know, nor will he ever, that Carey actually is the murderer–nor does he care who actually did the killings. He thinks he’s just being petty. Being framed for something you actually did is an old obsession with Westlake, ever since The Affair of the Purloined Microscope (see The Getaway Car). It’s just so–unprofessional. Detectives should care about their craft. Carey rubs it in just how much better a detective he is, by pointing out an obvious (to him) clue in that one case he’d decided not to solve–something Fred missed entirely. Fred is most admiring of Carey’s sagacity, but what’s that got to do with the fact that the man had sex with his wife?\n\nSo Carey is in Fred’s car, going to the inevitable Station House, knowing that he’s going to prison, because the only way he can prove he was framed is to admit his actual guilt. He’ll have to plead guilty, get the lightest sentence possible, and hope to rejoin the civilized world someday. And there’s every indication in the book that he will do that, and he might be a more successful film critic than ever–notoriety will bring him a wider readership. But it’s still so unfair. All he did was kill three people, and he didn’t mean to kill the first one, and the other two were just–loose ends. He’s guilty, but he’s not the least bit guilt-ridden. He’s only sorry he committed the sin of getting caught.\n\nWestlake was experimenting with a very detached yet whimsical tone in this novel, and it doesn’t entirely work. And it doesn’t entirely fail. It’s one of those middling efforts, cleverly worked out, fun to read, and easily forgotten.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting thing about it is the very detailed knowledge of film that Westlake reveals–he probably could have been a fairly successful film critic, but I have this feeling he wouldn’t have been a very enthusiastic one. He can’t really make Carey live and breathe the way his best characters do, because he can’t identify with somebody who’d spend his life writing about movies–even writing smutty greeting cards would be more creative, because they’d at least be your smutty jokes. Movies are fun and all, but are they worth all that analysis? Is anything? (Yes, I do seriously wonder what he’d have thought about this blog).\n\nIn his capsule review of this same story, Ethan Iverson quoted a passage I surely would have used myself if he hadn’t beaten me to it–it’s an interview Carey does with some aging Hollywood director, one of those guys who made a bunch of classic films and never wrote the scripts for any of them, but he still gets the credit, and the money, and a gorgeous young thing to keep him warm in his declining years, because that’s how it works in Hollywood.\n\nAnd it really sums up that mixture of affection and disdain Westlake always had towards the movies–how well a good filmmaker can tell a story, and how helpless he is without a good script, and yet look who gets all the worship and acclaim in that business. How can you say it’s your work when so many other people contributed? And how could somebody who has decided to just live in the reflected glow of that unreal medium ever know himself? Carey Thorpe got caught up in unreality, captured by it, and was ultimately undone by it. And yet it really doesn’t matter, because there doesn’t seem to have been much of a person there to start with. That’s the weakness of the book.\n\nI think Westlake might have been influenced in the writing of this one by Charles Willeford’s The Burnt Orange Heresy, which is about an art critic, and which is roughly ten times the novel this is (and Westlake would have agreed). Willeford wrote a lot less than Westlake, and he had to make his shots count more. Westlake, having so much more ammo, could afford a few misses.\n\nBut while it’s not the kind of story we remember him for, the second part of this two-part tome was by no means a miss. It’s a palpable hit, and ‘Newgate Callendar’ should have seen that, but let’s just say Westlake had a point about critics. Yes, me too. It’s a fair cop, Mr. Westlake. But being a mere amateur, typing all this nonsense for absolutely no monetary compensation at all, I can always plead insanity. I’ll be out in two years, tops.\n\n“Why would anybody want to live anywhere except New York?” he asked her. “You’re quits with your husband, so you punish yourself by living in some tank town somewhere.”\n\n“Los Angeles isn’t a tank town.”\n\n“The hell it isn’t. Los Angeles is three Long Islands next to each other. But no Midtown Tunnel.”\n\nLaughing, she said, “If you’re so crazy about New York, what are you doing way out in the provinces?”\n\n“Business,” he said. “I’m coming out to get something, and then I’m going right back.”\n\n“All right,” she said. “But what if everybody felt the way you do? What if everybody wanted to live in New York?”\n\n“They do. That’s why they all hate New York so much–it’s envy. But you know who the big guy is in the social set in Indianapolis? The one that just got back from a trip to New York. He could go to Chicago or St. Louis or any damn place, and all people say is, ‘How was the trip?’ New York is the only place in this country he could go, when he gets back people say, ‘Tell me all about it.'”\n\nRe-reading this passage, I was reminded of Go Set A Watchman, Harper Lee’s ‘new’ book (that Westlake never got to read), where the grown-up Scout goes home to Maycomb, having been living and working in New York for several years. Everybody asks her about it, and she has a hard time explaining how different it is. And then she meets a rather tedious hometown couple, just back from their honeymoon in New York, and they can’t stop talking about it. And they say they wouldn’t live there for anything, it’s just awful. And they still can’t stop talking about it. They probably never did.\n\nWestlake was well aware that New York was not America, nor America New York–his narrator in this book informs us that America doesn’t begin until you’re over the Pennsylvania border, and ends somewhere around Nevada. New York is the quintessential American city in its diversity, its energy, its hustle. It’s where people from all over the world converge upon to begin the process of becoming Americans. But as Spaulding Gray once remarked, it’s really just an island off the coast of America. And the most popular tourist destination, for Americans and pretty much everybody else.\n\nAnd I think that quote up top does a good job explaining why that is. When you take a trip, you want people to ask you about it once you’re home. Everybody wants to know what New York is really like. And probably no two people who have been there would give you the same exact answer to that question. New York is all things to all men. It’s the Saint Paul of cities, much more so than the one in Minnesota.\n\nDonald Westlake’s emotions towards the city of his birth were always conflicted. He recognized very well that it is not a particularly beautiful town, for all its grandeur; that it lacks the more focused individual character of many other world capitals, that it’s really an assortment of small provincial villages lumped together into a metropolis. In 361, he has his very alienated protagonist say it’s basically just a blown-up Binghamton, and you would really have to see Binghamton to know what a put-down that was.\n\nOnce he was an established writer, Westlake generally preferred to live out in the country, in upstate New York or Northern New Jersey, far from the madding crowds. But throughout his career, he kept returning to Gotham, in his stories and in his life. He never got it out of his system. It was The City to him. As it has been to so many others.\n\nDancing Aztecs is a book about New York, more than anything else, which is why it’s really weird that somebody made it into a movie set in France–and not even in Paris (which we’re all thinking about this week). Lyon, for Christ’s sake. A city also featured in Mise à sac. With a present-day population of about half a million people. At least in Mise à sac it was only subbing for Newark.\n\nNot an easy film to lay your hands on a copy of. I have not seen it. There’s a clip on YouTube that seems to indicate that a gag in the book (where there’s a mix-up relating to the fact that different languages which utilize the Latin alphabet pronounce the names of the letters differently) translates fairly well into French, with a few minor adjustments. But looking at the little bit of it I can see, I can’t say that I feel I’ve missed some life-altering cinematic experience by not having seen it. And yet still probably better than the version Hollywood never got around to mangling, I mean making.\n\nAnyway, picking up from Part 1, I have several more items of interest to discuss, and I’d best get cracking. Gotta hustle.\n\nItem Three: The Not-So-Melancholy Danes\n\nDonald Westlake rarely ever depicted Man’s Best Friend in anything other than an intimidating light, and until somebody who knew him well tells me otherwise, I’m going to assume that’s because he was mortally afraid of large dogs. But he was also quite clearly an animal lover. This creates a conflict, because dogs are animals, and he knows perfectly well that the aggressive ones are usually only that way because they were bred and conditioned to be that way–it’s their job, and everybody has to do his job, right?\n\nIn his work as Richard Stark, he dealt with the conflict by showing dogs as ruthless incorruptible sentinels, the ultimate professionals, admirable and terrifying. In his comedic work under his own name, he dealt with it differently.\n\nSee, at the home of Bud Beemis, one of the people who might have the real golden statue, Mel Bernstein’s path converges with that of August Corella, the pseudo-mobster who arranged for the real statue to be smuggled into the states. At this same gracious domicile dwell two Great Danes. And by great, I mean fabulous.\n\n“Hamlet!” yelled Beemis. “Ophelia!” You stop that! Stop it! Leave that man alone!”\n\nThe dogs reluctantly released Earl, just in time to see Corella come around the corner of the house. Ah hah! This must be the guy they should defend the house against. The two dogs, smiling happily, loped toward Corella, who made an abrupt U-turn and ran like hell the opposite way.\n\n“Hamlet! Come back! Ophelia! Damn it, come back here!”\n\nThe dogs were having too much fun to listen to some old spoil-sport. Pretending they couldn’t hear their master’s voice, they continued after Corella, who scurried around to the front of the house and lunged into the Cadillac, startling Ralph out of a year’s growth. The two Great Danes thudding against the side of the car startled him him out of a second year’s growth. “Jesus!” he yelled, flinging his well-read New York Post up in the air. “Jesus Christ!”\n\n(Westlake may not have been a dog person, but country living forces you to come into contact with such harrowing household guardians on a regular basis, and ever the sharp-eyed observer of the passing scene, he came to understand canine psychology quite well–that selective deafness thing he describes is spot-on. “But I would have done what you said if I heard you.” Says the critter who can hear the tiniest scrap of food hit the floor from the other side of the house.)\n\nMel, who was smart enough to make friends with the toothsome twosome on his way in, gets away with the statue (another fake), while they worry the exposed flanks of the opposing forces (literally), and then pursue them all a country mile down the road, before trotting back home in an excellent mood, Hamlet flourishing the rear bumper of Corella’s Cadillac in his gaping maw like a trophy of war. But Mel, no longer having the furry fiends to protect him, has to somehow shake Corella’s steadfast pursuit, which brings us to–\n\nItem Four: Did Anyone Ever Put Out a Car Called Kill?\n\nPerhaps the most frequently-quoted passage from this book appears in a section of the book dealing with a fantasy-prone Connecticut State Trooper named Luke Snell, who Mel latches onto as a means of thwarting Corella & Co. Like so many other of the best lines in the book, it’s reserved for the narrator.\n\nThe state trooper was driving a Fury II. State troopers love Fury IIs. State troopers will go on driving Fury IIs until some car company puts out a car called Kill. Then state troopers will drive Kills. State troopers get their self-image from Marvel comics.\n\nWestlake probably had the odd few run-ins with state troopers as a motorist living in rural New Jersey, but of course his irreverent attitude towards officers of the law had been formed many years before. However, our question must be whether he had accurately (if sardonically) assessed the reason for the enduring popularity of the Plymouth Fury among state troopers (the one in the novel even drives an older model Fury as his personal automobile).\n\nAnd it took only a few moment’s research for me to determine that Mr. Westlake had missed an important datum–in 1971, AMC put out the Matador, and as we all know, the word matador means ‘killer’, which is surely close enough. So by the mid-70’s, state police were still often driving Fury IIs, even though their dream car was now available. So Westlake was wrong? Let us merely say he overstated his point, because, as Wikipedia helpfully points out, “Matadors were a popular vehicle for police, as it outperformed most other police cars. It was also featured in many television shows and movies during the 1970s.” And possibly some Marvel comics, but I really couldn’t say.\n\nNor can I say with authority what state troopers are driving now, since the Fury was discontinued, along with Plymouth, and for that matter, AMC. Clearly fantasy-prone state troopers are not a large enough consumer base to sustain a brand in today’s competitive automobile market. I do believe the Ford Taurus and Dodge Charger are enjoying brisk business in that niche, however; something to bear in mind when you feel like making up a bit of time on the interstate. Even if your only purpose for breaking the speed limit is to return more quickly to the side of your beloved, which brings us to–\n\nItem Five: The Love Rectangle\n\nThere are numerous sexual liaisons of various types depicted in this book, but only four that could really be called romantic, making up the sides of a rectangle (two of them much shorter than the other two). To wit–\n\nA)The idealized interracial couple of Jenny Kendall (white) and Eddie Ross (black), who represent love at its most pure and perfect. Having helped the Open Sports Committee achieve its goal of a public squash court in Harlem, they take their ‘Other Oscars’ (Oscar Russell Greene’s name for the replicas of the Dancing Aztec Priest that he hands out to each member of the group, not knowing that one of them isn’t a replica), and set off on matching motorcycles to see America, and it’s been a few years since Easy Rider, so maybe that worked out okay for them (maybe stay out of the deep south a while longer, kids).\n\nOur narrator has a soft spot for these two, making it clear that their connection is real and powerful, but that adult complications may loom in the future (Jenny has not yet told her parents about Eddie). They’re basically too perfect to be funny, so we don’t see much of them, and they disappear from the narrative shortly after their statues both prove to be fakes–and that’s fine, because they still have each other, and youth, and youth’s illusions, so preferable to reality in every possible way. They have the real thing, so they don’t need the real statue.\n\nB)The not so idealized and yet rather more believable interracial couple of David Fayley (white) and Kenny Spang (black). Who we meet when Jerry breaks into their apartment to check their statues, and gets discovered–first by David, then by Kenny. Who are gay, naturally–and referred to as such. As I’ve already mentioned, Westlake the word man had finally given up the hopeless rearguard action (oh shut up) of pretending that the meaning of ‘gay’ had not been definitively reassigned (double entendres abound) to refer to same-sex oriented males.\n\nSo what happens? Jerry plays it cool, acts like he’s supposed to be there. So David assumes Kenny picked him up, and Kenny assumes the same of David, and neither of them wants to be square enough to act as if this is any big deal, we’re all adults here, and they’re both very very hurt, but neither will admit it. It’s funny, but also touching. Gay men were still figuring out how to do monogamy (well, aren’t we all, really?), and the rules were not so clear. Much later in the book, the reason for Jerry’s presence is revealed, and they’re both very relieved to know they’re just a pair of squares. And again, the revelation that they don’t have the real statue doesn’t phase them a bit, because they have each other.\n\nJerry’s encounter with these two has quite an impact on him as well–seeing their apartment, realizing how different life can be from what he’s used to in his own little corner of New York, doesn’t disgust him as he expects–it intrigues him. How many other new worlds remain to be explored?\n\nC)The unsettled marital relationship of Mel and Angela (nee Manelli) Bernstein (you can see how we’re moving through different stages of romance here). When we first meet Angela, she’s having sex with the rather callow Wally Hintzlebel in her and her husband’s bedroom, and then Mel comes home unexpectedly, and ends up seducing his wife while Wally waits unhappily in the closet (and thus learns about the statues).\n\nThis marriage would not seem long for the world, and clearly both partners have taken each other much for granted, and yet after Mel learns of her infidelity (in the context of Angela rescuing him from Wylie Cheshire the surly football player), and the expected domestic fracas results, the end result is a somewhat more perfect union. The Bernsteins, who had simply been a couple, transition into a partnership, with the estimable Mandy Addleford as their live-in maid and part-time marriage counselor. I have to say, her roving eye notwithstanding, the bed-hopping bridge-playing Angela is my favorite female character in the book, and Mel Bernstein is a lucky man, horns and all.\n\nD)The main event, romantically speaking, is the meet-cute and then mate-cute of Jerry Manelli and Bobbi Harwood. The only serious couple we see in the process of becoming a couple (the others are entirely about sex). Jerry is a bit too street-wise to be a ‘Nephew’ in the strict sense, but hustler that he is, he’s no match for the ultimate hustler, Cupid. Unlike his fellow hustler, Art Dodge, he knows The Girl when he sees her.\n\nBelieving Bobby has the legit statue, Jerry tracks her down on the road, while she’s driving across country to California, having walked out on her college prof. husband, who seems determined to believe she’s having affairs with a variety of black men (sadly not the case), and keeps telling her it’s fine, he doesn’t mind at all, and if you don’t believe this kind of husband exists there’s some websites you need to check out, but I’m not posting those links here.\n\nWhile romancing the statue out of her, Jerry finds to his dismay (and no reader’s surprise) that he’s falling for her, but she’s so obviously out of his league, being a classy blonde who plays harp for the Philharmonic, he just figures it’s not to be, and keeps going for the gold. And he gets it; just not the way he expected. And we don’t get their first sexual encounter described for us, and the narrator explains why–\n\n(Novelists, when their characters drive cars, never feel compelled to describe precisely what the physical actions are of hands, feet, eyes, knees, elbows. Yet many of these same novelists, when their characters copulate, get into such detailed physical description you’d think they were writing an exercise book. We all know the inter-relation between the right ankle and the accelerator when driving a car, and we needn’t be told. In sex, we all know about knees, thighs, fingers, the softness at the side of the throat, here-let-me-help, how’s that, mf, mf, mf, mf. And if you don’t know it, you shouldn’t read dirty books anyway; they’ll only give you the wrong ideas.)\n\nSpeak for yourself, Mr. Stingy. Not our fault you got sick of this kind of writing doing all those smutty books to pay your electric bills and what-all. As I recall, this restraint of yours in describing the sex act did not last long. Okay, granted, some writers do get a bit hung up on the fine details, but do you see their readers complaining? Self-evidently not, because you had Mel Bernstein, formerly a faux literary agent wading through an endless pile of slush, strike it rich as the author of a smutty bestseller, partly plagiarized from his former clients.\n\nSo that’s the Love Rectangle, and in all four cases, the point is the same. Golden statues with emerald eyes are fine in their place, but love remains the universal currency. A lesson that may never be learned by–\n\nItem Six: The Amateur\n\nWally Hintzlebel is a type of character we meet in a lot of Westlake novels (and at least one Richard Stark). Tall, gangly, innocent-looking, far from wise in the ways of the world, and yet with aspirations to know more of that world. If only he could catch a break. As already mentioned, he lives with his mother, a ghastly woman who dotes on him, and has basically smothered him with her cloying affection and her good cooking. He believes he’s happy living the way he is, selling swimming pools to suburban housewives, and then selling his way into their beds, but when he hears about a million dollar statue going up for grabs, all he can think about is getting his hands on it, and getting the hell away from mom and the horny housewives, and seeing what the world has to offer him.\n\nNow which previous character in the books we’ve already looked at does this most remind us of? Lanky acned 18 year old Alfred Ricks, of The Jugger, that’s who. Who overheard the town sheriff trying to beat the location of this supposed huge stash of stolen cash out of his next door neighbor, Joe Sheer, and all Alfred could think about was getting the money for himself, so he could run away from his parents and his stilted small-town life, leading to an unfortunate sequence of events that culminated with him getting buried in Joe Sheer’s cellar. Because you really do not want to be a young naive amateur in a Richard Stark novel.\n\nWestlake is kinder to amateurs, and he gives Wally a lot of breaks–and yet, at the end, is Wally really better off than Alfred? I don’t want to give it all away, but when you read that chapter, think about it. What are we actually being shown here? What’s the moral of the story? Maybe Alfred had the better deal after all. Cleaner, anyway. Quicker.\n\nBut amateurs in a Richard Stark novel get off easy compared to a different sort of character in nearly any Westlake novel, namely–\n\nItem Seven: Rich Pricks\n\nThis is a long book, so we get a variety of rich people, but just two of any significance (Westlake has no problems with prosperous hard-working members of the bourgeoisie, being one himself at least some of the time), these being shifty financier Victor Krassmier, and heir to old money, Hugh Van Dinast.\n\nKrassmeier is introduced to us by way of an annual report he drafts out relating to himself, that he has no intention of making public (you can’t do an IPO for a person anyway, no matter what Mitt Romney thinks). Basically, he’s overextended himself, and he arranged with August Corella to pull the statue heist, having good connections with a museum willing to put up the cash. He concludes the report thusly–\n\nThe Future\n\nVictor Krassmeier’s physical plant remains active and capable, with only slight depreciation, except for a continuing problem with the prostrate gland, which should not prove to be a serious factor in future business activity. On the national and international economic scene, Victor Krassmeier remains optimistic. The system continues to suffer one of its periodic dislocations and adjustments, but he anticipates–along with most of the rest of the financial community (see Graph 1 and Chart 2)–that the long-awaited upturn will begin to make itself at last evident in the second or third quarter of the next calendar year. His portfolio and other holdings remain basically sound. The “South America matter” should solve the negative cash flow problems, at least until the expected turnaround. Should that turnaround take longer than anticipated to emerge, future partnerships with August Corella or others could certainly be considered. On balance, Victor Krassmeier considers his current posture to be nerve-racking but positive.\n\nWell okay, corporations aren’t people, but maybe some people can be corporations.\n\nHugh Van Dinast comes from very old money indeed–his ancestors helped build this city, and indeed this country, and perhaps they can be forgiven the odd peccadillo, such as a marked proclivity for very young Polynesian girls (or boys, what does it matter, really?).\n\nHugh himself is an oddball, in that he lusts after tall patrician blondes, and when Bobbi Harwood, seeking transport out of town, gets hired to drive his Jaguar across country, Hugh falls madly in lust with her, and makes extremely improper (and unwelcome) advances. Soundly rebuffed, he figures he’ll meet her in California to apologize for his beastliness, and maybe slip some sleeping pills into her drink.\n\nCharming fellow. And persistent. And basically useless to the narrative, except for the purpose of getting Bobbi out of town, and reminding us that the people who built a city may not be the ones who best understand it, and their heirs may end up not understanding much of anything. Old money tends to be dumb money. And as Victor proves, new money may not be much better.\n\nI could add one item to the next, until this review was half as long as the book itself, and be very hard-pressed to run out of material. That’s Dancing Aztecs, and it’s been a pleasure and a challenge to review it. I’m pretty damn certain this is the longest and most detailed review it’s ever gotten (that’s probably true of most if not all of the preceding reviews), and maybe it doesn’t need all this analysis, but then again, does Joyce’s Ulysses?\n\nSure, there’s a lot of things in that book that need explaining, interpretation, scholarly musings, but isn’t it basically the same thing? A story of many characters milling around one city and its environs, and we look into their minds one by one, and recognize bits of ourselves in them, and we realize what a complex organism a city can be, and how many stories unfold daily within it, and within each person within it. This is simpler, more readable, less ambitious perhaps, but am I reaching here? In fact, Westlake made a very direct reference to the opening line of Ulysses in the next Dortmunder novel. Which is not our next book. I’ll get to that.\n\nJoyce’s point was about how different people react to life, how they say yes or no to it, how they balance their hungers with their morals (if any). This more modern urban trek is, like all Westlake’s books, about how people find out who they are, what they’re capable of–or fail in that quest. Jerry the hustler succeeds by putting the hustle aside for a while, going with the flow, and realizing that as lovely as Ms. Harwood is, as much potential as they may have together, his true love is Gotham, and he will always return to Her, expanding his horizons, while still remaining rooted in the town of his birth. A different character might have a different answer. Because everyone is different. But we all gotta hustle. Because tempus fugit and all that.\n\nEach of the three parts of this book begins with a masterful little essay, each with its own point to make–Everybody in New York is looking for something–Everybody in New York is trying to get somewhere–Everybody in New York wants to be somebody. And ending in each case by reminding us that only once in a while does somebody find what he or she is seeking, get where he or she is going, be what he or she wants to be. But the potential is always there. So keep hustling. But don’t forget to stop and look around you sometimes. Because when you do that maybe you’ll see what you’re really looking for, where you really want to go, who you really want to be.\n\nThe Hustle is a New York Dance, we’re told at the start–referring to the Disco scene, and I doubt Westlake the jazz buff was a fan (I sure wasn’t), but he would have noted with approval, all the same, how that scene encompassed such a wide variety of races and classes. We’re all in this dance together, and it’s messy and rude and maybe we don’t know the moves as well as we should, and we step on each others’ toes a lot (or try to hog the spotlight)–but it can be beautiful sometimes. When it works. If you’re on the streets of New York, or any city where all the colors blend together–stop and look. Look at us learning how to dance. Maybe we’ll get it right someday, in spite of all the haters. Do it. Do it. Do The Hustle.\n\nAnd now I have to review a book that is actually one short novel and one long story, and I’ve long debated with myself whether to make this one a two-parter. I’m still debating it. But it’ll work itself out. Enough, already.\n\nGreater New York is in some ways like a house. Manhattan is the living room, with the TV and the stereo and the good furniture, where guests are entertained. Brooklyn and Queens are the bedrooms where the family sleeps, and the Bronx is the attic, full of inflammable crap that nobody has any use for. Staten Island is the backyard, and Long Island is the attached garage, so filled up with paint cans, workbenches, and a motorboat that you can’t get the car in it any more. Hudson County over in New Jersey is the basement, with the furnace and the freezer and the stacks of old newspapers, and the Jersey swamps are the toilet. Westchester is the den, with paneling and a fake kerosene lamp, and Connecticut is the guest room, with starched curtains and landscape prints. The kitchen is way up in Albany, which means the food is always cold by the time it gets to the table, and the formal dining room was torn down by William Zeckendorf and friends back in the early fifties.\n\nJerry Manelli had spent most of his life in just one corner of this house, and he was only now beginning to realize it. The last twenty-four hours had been frustrating, but they’d also been interesting, catching his attention as nothing had done for years. While he’d been moving in the small circle of the family and Inter-Air Forwarding and a succession of Myrnas, the world all around him had been full of strange neighborhoods and even stranger citizens, and if they weren’t people you’d want to be around every day of your life, so what? They were new experiences, and it had been a long time since Jerry had had any new experiences.\n\nDancing Aztecs is the only book Donald Westlake published in 1976, the bicentennial year of his nation’s founding. The last time this had happened was 1964, when his sole contribution to literature was Pity Him Afterwards, which he wrote in eleven days–that it was his only book to come out that year was probably more a matter of publishers’ schedules than him producing less work in that time period. In 1965, he published The Fugitive Pigeon, one of his biggest sellers ever, and established himself as a comic crime novelist, a niche he created almost from scratch, and then dominated for decades afterwards.\n\nThe Fugitive Pigeon is about a young New Yorker living way out in Canarsie, who is forced by circumstances to traverse a large part of the greater New York area (even Staten Island), to try and clear his name before the mob puts a hit on him. In the process, he learns a lot about his city and himself, finds true love, and accepts adulthood. It’s a short book, written in the first person, with a lot of fascinating detail built into it, and it’s still a lot of fun to read. But as I said in my review of it, it isn’t really laugh out loud funny. And its perspective is fairly limited, since it’s basically a romantic picaresque with a crime angle, and we see the story solely from the protagonist’s point of view. Also, basically everybody in the book is white. Even the gangsters seem pretty vanilla. And there’s a lot of pop cultural references.\n\nDancing Aztecs is written in the third person omniscient (and this narrator is as about as omniscient as they come). The first edition from M. Evans & Co. is 374 pages, which was not a record for Westlake–Ex Officio had been much longer. But unless you count Smoke as a comic novel (that one’s a bit harder to peg), it’s the longest humorous work he ever published, and in its original form was reportedly even longer, with a character we don’t see at all in the published work; an insane Federal agent who was fired twelve years ago, but thinks he’s just in really really deep cover.\n\nIt’s hard to sustain a comic plot over a long stretch. Westlake had a very large story to tell, with a lot of characters, a lot of side-plots, a lot of detail. He solved this problem by basically making the book into three books; The First Part of the Search, which is the length of one of his usual comic novels (he tells the reader to go to bed after finishing it), then the novella-length Second Part of the Search, and The Third Part of the Search is really a long short story, 73 pages in all. Each part, you see, gets more focused and intense, as the search begins to narrow, and the once widely-dispersed cast of characters start coming together for the big finish.\n\nIt’s not aiming to be a tightly plotted little mousetrap of a book, like the books we know him best for, Parker, Dortmunder, Tobin, the Nephews, etc. There is a mystery in it, but it’s even less the point of the proceedings than is usually the case with Westlake. The story is basically a chaotic treasure hunt, with one fairly obvious influence–\n\nBut I’d say this was in the mix as well, along with the type of comic theater that inspired it–\n\nThat being said, this is first and foremost a reworking of The Fugitive Pigeon, greatly expanding on the basic idea of that book, and employing the vastly superior comic techniques Westlake had mastered in the ensuing decade.\n\nIt also has maybe a touch of Comfort Station in it, believe it or not, that tiniest of Westlake novels, a mere parody of Arthur Hailey (I have since reconciled myself to this fact), but in creating a mock-narrative of a handful of mismatching strangers brought together by circumstances in New York City (crossroads of well over seven million private lives in the mid-70’s, not counting commuters), Westlake may have felt like this was worth revisiting in earnest–still comedic, but granting the characters actual human dimensions, and the capacity to learn, to grow. This book would not be a parody of anything–why let the Arthur Haileys of the world be the only ones to paint grand tableaux?\n\nI’m not just guessing here–Westlake dropped a substantial clue when he had one character walk right by the Bryant Park Comfort Station (closed to the public at that time, but no matter). He also used the same tongue-in-cheek dramatis personae device to open the book.\n\nBut he refers to quite a few other past comic novels of his as well. There’s a moment where that same character walks into the same midtown office building where Art Dodge’s greeting card company, Those Wonderful Folks, from Two Much, is located–the V.S. Goth cab company from Somebody Owes Me Money is there as well. There’s something called Nebula Musical Attractions, and I don’t know what book that’s from. But I assume like the others, it’s a book about New York. Building up to Westlake’s ultimate book about New York.\n\nThere are those who think this is the funniest book Westlake ever wrote. One interviewer called it his masterpiece. Liking it as much as I do, I can’t go that far. For my money, it’s still not as funny as the best of the Dortmunders, nor as original and insightful as some of his other works, comic and otherwise–it’s an inspired mess, when you get right down to it. But it’s a larger more vivid book than most writers could ever claim, and not just in terms of sheer length. It’s an epic picaresque. And its hero, you might say, is not a person, but a city.\n\nTime to synopsize? That’s what I generally do at this point in the review. Well, how do I put this?\n\nThere is too much. Let me sum up.\n\nThe Dancing Aztec Priest is a solid gold statue with emerald eyes. It is from Descalzo, another of Westlake’s fictional Latin American countries, this one situated over the spine of the Andes (where there were no Aztecs, but somehow Dancing Incas doesn’t have quite the right ring to it). Some Descalzan ne’er do wells and some equally shady New Yorkers conspire to steal the statue from the state museum and replace it with a souvenir replica, sending the original to New York in a crate that is supposed to contain 16 souvenir replicas, but one will be the genuine item.\n\nThe crate will be intercepted at the airport by Jerry Manelli, a young hustler from Queens, who has created a fictitious company called Inter-Air Forwarding. He pretends to be legitimately picking up various items from JFK Airport, when in fact he’s stealing them, for himself and others. The airport is so huge and busy, nobody ever notices (this I believe). He doesn’t know what he’s picking up, and he doesn’t care.\n\nBut in this case, because of a regrettable oversight regarding the way the letters of the alphabet are pronounced differently in Spanish, he picks up the wrong crate, entirely full of replicas, while the crate with the original and 15 copies goes to a diverse group of people called The Open Sports Committee, as self-awarded prizes for having successfully bugged the city into opening the Stokely Carmichael Memorial Squash Court in a Harlem Park, regardless of the fact that Stokely Carmichael is not dead yet.\n\nThis group is straight and gay, black and white, rich and poor, united mainly (not entirely) by their desire to bring squash to Harlem (this multi-cultural devotion to squash I had a harder time believing in, but I’ve heard stranger stories, and so have you). And having accomplished their goal, they scatter to various parts of the city and points beyond with the statues, one of which is worth over a million dollars to a local museum that will ask no inconvenient questions.\n\nJerry, picking up on the fact that the people he delivered the crate to are really really unhappy about something, talks to some in-laws of his–Mel Bernstein, who is married to Jerry’s seductive sister Angela, and runs a hustle of his own that sounds a lot like the Scott Meredith Literary Agency on a small scale–and Frank and Floyd McCann, two Irish brothers who are hustlers in the sense of being union workers who don’t actually have to work that much.\n\nThey figure out that the real statue was in there. In discussing this at Mel’s house, they inadvertently alert Wally Hintzlebel, a pool salesman who was just having sex with Mel’s wife Angela (Jerry’s sister) and is hiding in the closet upstairs. Wally lives with his mother. He’s never lived anywhere but Long Island, never done anything but other men’s wives. He wants that money so he can broaden his horizons. The people who set up the original hustle also understandably want it to pay off for them. And once they are alerted to what’s going on, so do certain members of the Open Sports Committee, who demand their own cut. But nobody knows who has the real statue. And the game is afoot, Watson.\n\nMost of the book is these disparate groups racing around desperately, breaking plaster statues right and left, trying to find the gold one. Their problem is that because of the unusual diversity of the Open Sports Committee, the searchers are going to have to venture into places they are not familiar with, interact with types of people they have no real experience with. You’d think New Yorkers would be used to anything, but in reality, as our all-seeing narrator informs us–\n\nAlmost nobody lives in New York, and that’s especially true of those born there. They live in neighborhoods, the way small-town people live in small towns, and they very rarely leave their own districts. The average citizen of Ozone Park, say, in Queens, has probably never in his life been to the Midwood section of Brooklyn, and why should he? It’s just another neighborhood, exactly like his own, with churches and stores and movies and schools, and with nothing in particular to attract the interest of outsiders. And though most citizens of both Ozone Park and Midwood are likely to have been to Manhattan–because they work there, or they’ve had an occasional special night out–they don’t really think of Manhattan as being part of their hometown. “I’m going to the city,” say the people in the outer boroughs.\n\n(I used to say that all the time when I lived in The Bronx, and this was after I’d lived in Manhattan first. Well, when Londoners say ‘The City’ they just mean an area of about a square mile where a bit over 7,000 people actually live–we’re not that bad, anyway).\n\nHow many people are there who really know New York? All five boroughs. Who have visited each and every neighborhood–not necessarily walked every block, but could find it if they wanted, without referring to a map or asking directions? I’m far from convinced any such person has ever existed, at least not in the past century (I’m sure there were lots of people who had a strong working knowledge of Old New Amsterdam). I think there’s probably not a person in this city, native-born citizen or immigrant, who could make that claim. But what a claim to be able to make. Even Eustace Tilly might be impressed by such a person.\n\nThere’s not a part of this city you can’t reach by train or by bus. I’ve been to many of them, probably more than the average New Yorker. And whenever I get to a new place, I end up thinking “I can’t believe this was always here, and I never knew about it.” And if I said that maybe ten thousand times, I’d be getting somewhere. But I seriously doubt I’ll live that long.\n\nI really do not want to synopsize the plot of this book, because the fact is, it just doesn’t pay. It would take too long, because the story keeps going around and around in ever-tightening circles. The plot, the characters, the premise itself, are all MacGuffins. The real point of the enterprise is to give us a tour of Greater New York, and a highly philosophical overview of same. And to suggest that people are nutty when it comes to money and sex; hardly an original observation, but I’d call this a fairly original presentation.\n\nUsually, when I review one of Westlake’s books, I do a thorough synopsis, because it’s just such a pleasure to walk through the story again, and doing so brings certain aspects of the book into greater focus. Here, it simply makes my head spin. The comings and goings, and goings right after comings (I’m talking about sex here), and enough already. What items of particular interest may be found within this maelstrom of human activity?\n\nItem One: The Race Thing\n\nI’d say nearly half the people in this book are not white. The major protagonists all are, but because the POV of the book is constantly shifting, we get a large number of chapters written from the perspective of African Americans and Latinos. The chapters dealing with black people are written more or less in the style of Chester Himes, with a wily funeral home director named F. Xavier White filling in for H. Exodus Clay–Westlake’s not even trying to hide the influence here (he thought Himes was just about the best thing that ever happened to the mystery genre after Hammett, and he was probably right about that).\n\nHowever, some of the chapters in Harlem are written in broad ghetto dialect–something Himes’ omniscient narrator never stooped to in those Harlem Detective novels, which were dialect-heavy for sure, but never in the third-person, and never half as broad as here. Somehow, the all-seeing narrator in this book can turn into a black man when he’s looking down on Harlem. Who is the joke supposed to be on here? Is this even in remotely good taste? You tell me. This passage is about a jazz band on a truck in a funeral procession given in honor of a slain gangster from Down South (paid for by the dude who slew him).\n\nNow this band playing, and what they playing, it funeral music. Jazz funeral music. Very low, but syncopated. Lots a looooonnng looowwww trombone notes, full a growl. Lots a piano left hand. The clarinet, it tootle and teetle, but it don’t make no fuss about it, and even when the trumpet, it stride, it stride soft. Same as the bass, it walk slow and stately, it go bum dum bum dum bum, like a fat man carrying a crown on a little red pillow.\n\n(Later on, coming back from the cemetery, this band gone wail. Then you gone hear something. You gone hear that trombone waa-do-du-deedle-du-do, and that trumpet climb up la-bat-da-badda-bah, and that clarinet skeetlee-dee-titty-dee, and them drums fa-bot-ba-ba-boo-budeh-bah, and that bass go thun-thun-tha-thun-thun, and that piano triple-skipple-dipple-whipple-fipple-ripple-roo. You gone see that piano player smile under that bowler hat, and that trumpet man’s eyes, they gone pop right out he head, and that trombone man’s glasses, they gone steam up like in a Turkish bath. Because this is the idea, on the way the cemetery you got to think about him what dead, so you can play the long slow music with the heavy walking beat. But on the way back from the cemetery, it time to think about the living, it time to come up out your sadness, come up to happiness again. At least that’s what them handkerchief-heads from Down South, them Dundershaft relatives, that what they think.)\n\nIt was hard work just to type that out from the book, and I can only imagine how much long loving labor Westlake lavished on writing it up from scratch. I know he means no disrespect–quite the opposite, jazz freak that he is–and Faulkner gets away with worse in his novels–but he’s Faulkner, and Twain is Twain, and they grew up in the country this language comes from. I guess sometimes it’s just hard to know where the line is, so just pretend it isn’t there, that we’re all brothers and sisters, and we can like the way different people talk differently, and be grateful for it, and it’s not like anybody’s wearing blackface. But he’s still cutting it pretty close here in these chapters. And I don’t for one minute believe he didn’t know that, but since the critics never take him seriously anyhow, and there’s never going to be a movie version, what’s the harm?\n\nF. Xavier White has a fat jealous wife named (I kid you not) Maleficent, and she’d blend into any Tyler Perry movie ever made like she was written for it. And she comes across as a total caricature–until she gets her own chapter, and she’s feeling so sad and lonely, and all of a sudden you feel this wave of sympathy and love for her, and because the two Irishmen (I’ll get to them) break into the funeral home to try and find the statue, and scare the living daylights out of her, she is dissuaded from committing suicide (thinking she’s had a vision), and decides to become a better person. So does the compassion make up for the caricature? The sympathy for the superstition? I dunno.\n\nThere’s a black ganglord named Mr. Jeremiah “Bad Death” Jonesburg, and one gets the feeling Westlake likes him much better than any of his white ganglords. And maybe takes him a bit less seriously than the ones in the Stark novels, but this is not a serious book, is it?\n\nHe’s the Man, the Main Man from 96th to 155th, east side and west. Them Italians downtown shake when they hear the name Bad Death, because he’s the one run them out, run them right out of Harlem and the whole patch. He’s the meanest the baddest, the biggest, the toughest, the coolest and the hottest son of a bitch ever to hit the street. Where he walks tombstones grow, and where he sits the sun never shines. His bed is made of politician’s bones, and for lunch he eats policemen’s orphaned children. He wears Datsuns when he roller-skates, and his toilet seat is lined with pussy fur. His hand can crumble bricks, and his piss cuts through solid steel. He stacks his women three at a time like cordwood, and makes love to them all at once. The Queen of England irons his shirts, and his Cadillac runs on Dago blood. When he’s angry bullets melt, and when he smiles trees die. He’s so mean he can’t look in a mirror, for fear he’ll annoy himself. When he speaks transistor radios give up the ghost, and when he farts entire neighborhoods turn into deserts. He is the Man, and nobody forgets it.\n\nRap music was already a thing when Westlake wrote this, but I doubt he’d listened to any at the time–he’s drawing on the older oral and literary traditions that spawned rap, and on Himes again (except Himes was never much impressed by ganglords, and most of the time neither was Westlake). Frankly, I doubt there’d be a New Orleans style jazz band in a funeral procession in Harlem in the mid-70’s, but that’s quibbling. Himes’ Harlem wasn’t exactly up-to-date either, seeing as he was writing it as an exile in France.\n\nSo Bad Death is the Man, and it’s impossible to scare him, but he’s tickled pink when Frank and Floyd show up at the Funeral Home, and Frank, in a burst of inspiration, cons him into thinking they’re government agents armed with guns cunningly disguised as pencil flashlights. Bad Death is so delighted that Washington is taking an interest in him that he lets them go. Now even the Feds know he’s the Man.\n\nNot all the black characters are in Harlem. There’s a level-headed domestic named Mandy Addleford who works for an actress on Broadway, who Frank and Floyd have to kidnap to keep her from spilling the beans (Frank works on Broadway too, and she recognizes him), and she ends up becoming an integral part of Mel and Angela’s household–part of the family, even.\n\nThere’s a beautiful (we’re talking Beyonce-level) school teacher named Felicity Tower, still a virgin in her early 30’s, desperately wanting to stop being one, and not having the foggiest notion how. There’s a hulking ill-tempered football player named Wylie Cheshire, who Mel assumes is white, because he lives in a mainly white suburb, and it’s such a genteel-sounding name. There’s two good-natured street urchins named Buhbuh and Leroy, who don’t have much to do except sit and watch the craziness unfold around them. What links all these people together? They all got statues. And they’re all New Yorkers. And that, to this book, is a vastly more important detail than skin pigmentation, or speech patterns.\n\nThe most important black character is Oscar Russell Green, who led the Open Sports Committee to victory over The System, and then retires to his high-rise apartment in Harlem to get drunk, as he does on rare occasions, just to blow off steam. And then he realizes there’s these two Irishmen burglarizing his place. We’ll get back to that. Oscar seems to me to be a character who needed a bit more narrative time, and maybe he had it in the longer version of the novel. Westlake had an unfortunate tendency to create black characters with a lot of potential and then not do much of anything with them, and again I wonder if that one black character in Comfort Station who couldn’t quite find his way into the main narrative was aimed at Westlake’s deficiencies as a writer as much as Hailey’s. The best writers know their limitations better than anyone.\n\nBut the Latinos in the story have no statues (even the ones who originally stole the original statue). That part of the story relates mainly to Pedro, a peasant-type from Descalzo, who was forced to participate in the art-theft hustle, then forced to hijack a plane to New York (to avoid the consequences of the art-theft hustle, which would involve being hung by the tongue until dead), and then avoids the consequences of said hijacking by virtue of people just forgetting he’s there, and then he wanders around JFK until a sympathetic fellow Latin (probably Puerto Rican, we’re never told, and it doesn’t matter) who works there takes him home to meet the family, believing him to be a political refugee (which is sort of true). And Pedro thus becomes the newest of New Yorkers, without even trying, and things turn out rather well for him, and at the end he still has no idea what’s going on, but it sure beats hanging by your tongue in Descalzo.\n\nPedro is basically our back-door into what Westlake recognized as a growing network of Spanish-speaking New Yorkers who were forming their own society within the city (comprising about a third of the city by the time he wrote this), and he heartily approved. As we saw in Brothers Keepers, he had a very warm regard for Latinos in general, felt like they had as much of a right to be here as anyone, and that they would in the main be welcome if sometimes chaotic additions to the ever-expanding crazy quilt that is America, even as his own wild Irish ancestors had been. And it’s kind of sad that four decades later we’re still arguing that point, but not very surprising. Ethnic stereotypes are durable buggers. And this brings us to–\n\nItem Two: The Stage Irishmen\n\nDamn, it just occurred to me–Frank McCann, elder brother of Floyd, actually works as a stagehand–on Broadway. Another of Westlake’s patented implicit puns. Westlake knew very well what he was invoking with those two bumbling bellicose bigoted brothers, and he enjoys every minute of it–they’re a lot of fun. For him, and for us.\n\nIt’s not 100% clear whether Frank and Floyd are Irishmen in the sense of having been born in Ireland and immigrated as young men, or in the sense of just being of Irish stock and not having fully assimilated yet, but that’s neither here nor there. They are there to remind us that 1)Not all ethnic stereotypes relate to non-white people and 2)Not all ethnic stereotypes are entirely unfair, though the reality is always so much more complex than the stereotype, and all ethnicities have their little quirks (Westlake has fun with a rich inbred WASP here as well, but he’s a mite unsympathetic with that one, as you might expect).\n\nAnyway, the McCanns are big florid-complexioned redheads (rather reminiscent of how Westlake described Ray Kelly’s father and brother in 361–hmm), and much as they’re supposed to be out there looking for the original statue separately, covering more ground, they’re both scared to death of the non-white neighborhoods they’ve been assigned, and being very close, just have a natural inclination to stick together, so they work as a team, going places they’d normally stay the hell away from, dealing with people they’d just as soon leave the hell alone.\n\n“Harlem,” Floyd said, and either through fright or by contrast with his assignment his face had never looked whiter. “I’ve never been in Harlem in my life!”\n\n“What about me?” his brother Frank demanded. “I get the South Bronx. That’s worse than Harlem.”\n\n“I can’t do it,” Floyd said. “That’s all, I just can’t do it.”\n\n“You think you’ve got troubles,” Mel said, “look at my list. I’m all over the place, I’ve got Long Island and Connecticut and New Jersey, it’ll take me a month.”\n\nThen everybody talked at once, until Jerry shut them all up by banging the pot on the dining room table–“Dents!” yelled Angela, but whether about the pot or the table she didn’t say–and when the bong-bongs had startled everybody into silence Jerry said “We worked out those four bunches together. Nobody complained ahead of time, so nobody should complain now.”\n\n“I can’t go to Harlem,” Floyd explained.\n\nJerry was unsympathetic. “You want to drop out? If you want, you go home now and you don’t get a split and no questions asked.”\n\nFloyd stood there blinking, stuck between the rock and the hard place, and his older brother Frank clapped him on the back, saying “You can do it, Floyd. Any good Irishman is worth ten niggers.”\n\n“There’s more than ten niggers in Harlem,” Floyd said.\n\nThe classic Stage Irishman is a mixture of braggadocio and cowardice, cunning and credulity–Amos & Andy would have worked just as well with Irishmen, back in the day. And just as with black stage stereotypes (and present-day entertainments as well, I already mentioned Tyler Perry, and he’s just part of a very long line), you had the objects of the mockery themselves contributing mightily to the mix (because poor people always love to laugh at themselves, as long as they get some say in how it’s done, and a chance to get a bit of their own back in return).\n\nAny of you ever hear tell of a lad named Ned Harrigan? I will bet you a week’s salary Westlake had. In many ways, this novel reads like a late 20th century take on what Harrigan was doing on the New York stage in the late 19th century. And just like in those plays, the Irish have beefs with everybody–Frank and Floyd are still bitter about their assignment, and wondering if they got screwed over somehow when it came to dividing up the territories–\n\n“But us micks got it again,” Floyd said. “Every damn time. I’ll tell you something, Frank. There’s times you can get ahead of a guinea, and there may even be times you can get ahead of a sheeny, but there isn’t an Irishman born that can get ahead of guineas and sheenies working together.”\n\n“A million dollars is still a million dollars,” Frank said.\n\nSo that being unquestionably the case, they cover their territory, and in the process of doing so they–\n\nBurglarize a very large black man’s apartment in Harlem.\n\nTerrorize poor Felicity Tower, who thinks they’ve come to rape her (and is mainly relieved when they don’t, but still doesn’t know what to do about the virginity thing).\n\nAbduct an older and wiser black woman who recognizes Frank, taking her to the wilds of Queens, from whence she never returns (because she finds a better job there, as already mentioned).\n\nAnd never once do they perceive any ironic reversal of dramatic expectations in any of that. Not even when Floyd, seeing Oscar Russell Green (who is drunk as a skunk by that time, but still a large black man in Harlem), shouts in mortal terror, “F-f-f-feet do your stuff!” But really it’s not a reversal–it’s just an intentional anachronism. They’re taking back the jobs their ancestors did, before those tasks got assigned to other groups. Everything old is new again.\n\nAnd perhaps now is a good time for the intermission. This is a rather long book. I’ve got several more items to discuss. And speaking of old things that never really get old, here’s a song from the aforementioned Mr. Harrigan (and his song-writing partner, a Mr. Brahm (who was Jewish, of course, you think multi-culturalism was invented in the late 20th century?). Yeah, New York New York is a great old song, and Sinatra does it proud, but to me this is the official Gotham Anthem. And still, at heart, what this city I’m typing in is all about.\n\n(And Mr. Moloney cleaned up a few of the more offensive racial epithets in the original lyrics, but the spirit of the piece remains the same, as does that of the city that inspired it).\n\n(Part of Friday’s Forgotten Books)\n\nThis will be a short piece, and it ought to be, because it’s about a word Donald Westlake used very sparingly in his long career. And, I would argue, never without good reason. But some might disagree.\n\nHe first used it in Up Your Banners, which is the only book Westlake ever wrote that was specifically about racism. And in fact, it appears quite infrequently there. Here’s two instances I can find (no e-version of this book).\n\nHe can stand there and tell me how the students don’t have the mental capacity or the moral sense of white people, not because they’re niggers but because–”\n\n“Oliver! To hear a word like that from you, of all–”\n\n“But because,” I shouted, drowning her out, “they have niggers for parents! And he forgets who was principal at that rotten stinking school when the parents were students there, and it was my grandfather. So these kids won’t get any decent education because people like my father give up on them ahead of time, so they’ll grow up and have kids of their own and those kids will come from homes with no books or records or polysyllabic words and then it’ll be my turn to say those kids are untrainable but it isn’t their fault it’s their parents. It isn’t their parents, it’s my parents!”\n\nOliver never thought of himself as racist, as having any antipathy to black people at all, and so the word (along with a few others) is there as an acknowledgement, that he himself comes to terms with, that those feelings were there. Whether he was using that word or not. He’s got to understand this about himself to know who he is, and figure out what’s most important to him–which turns out to be the black woman he’s in love with. Who fortunately loves him back (though if he’d ever said that word to her face, the story might have ended differently).\n\nThen it makes a single appearance (along with ‘jigaboo’) in a chapter of Two Much, a book that is not about race at all. The likable but unscrupulous narrator of that story is being led off by two toughs hired by a rival of his who wants him out of the picture–they’re escorting him to the airport, and not wanting anybody to get the better of him, he takes advantage of the fact that they’re in the garment district, and there’s a lot of non-white people there, as is invariably the case–including some very formidable looking black men.\n\nSo he tactically deploys those two supremely offensive epithets to enrage these men, telling them to get out of the way when white men are passing, and it’s been a very long time since you could get away with that kind of thing in New York, except maybe in Bensonhurst. In the ensuing confusion, he makes good his escape, while the two presumed wiseguys (who never said anything insulting) are occupied with the men he insulted–guilt by association. Fighting words come in handy when you want to start a fight. This character is at no time portrayed to us as a model of good behavior, and he is ultimately punished for his sins, though let us say in a rather unconventional manner.\n\nLater, the word makes an appearance in Kahawa, a book set in Africa, in the context of a white man being brutally interrogated by Ugandans under the command of Idi Amin, who think he’s working for the CIA (which he is not). When he professes ignorance of what they are accusing him of, he’s asked if he thinks they are niggers–in other words, does he think they are fools. That’s the only instance of the word Google Books turns up. This is also not a book about race, per se, since the great majority of people in it are black (though most of the main protagonists are not). It’s a heist story combined with an expose of the atrocities committed by Amin’s government against his own people. We’ll be looking at it fairly soon.\n\nIt appears in Why Me?, a Dortmunder novel, and again, it’s a very unpleasant character using it, and he’s basically thinking it to himself, and we’re not supposed to approve of this person in any way. And it’s probably in a few other books he wrote (not all of which can be searched via Google). But the book we’re about to look at uses it differently, and more often than the others, and it’s not a book about race, or racism, but it’s a book in which race and racism are, shall we say, plot points, because it’s a book about New York City. Which has been a racial pressure-cooker for several centuries now. As well as a place where every imaginable race has blended with every other imaginable race.\n\nAnd when you get right down to it, all races are imagined. We’re just human beings–vain, confused, grasping, avaricious, mendacious, contentious, self-deceiving and yet oddly likable creatures, with all-too-rare redeeming moments of grace and humor and good fellowship. That’s how Westlake saw it, anyway. And that’s what Dancing Aztecs is all about.\n\nThe word ‘nigger’ appears in Dancing Aztecs at least seven times. In two instances, it’s used by black people referring to other black people they consider backward in some way. In four instances, it’s used by two Irish brothers to refer to black people in Harlem, who they are scared to death of encountering, and yet greed impels them to risk it (at no time do they ever say the word when a black person is present). And it’s used once by the closest thing this book has to a central protagonist and hero–a cocky streetwise young Italian American, thinking to himself that it’s strange the niggers aren’t throwing each other off rooftops in Harlem, knifing each other on the streets–the reality is not living up to the hype.\n\nThese three white characters are from Queens, they live in white working class ethnic enclaves, and they really don’t know much of anything about black people. So the word is almost more of a tribal epithet than a racial one (and yet a racial epithet it remains, because what the hell else can it be?). And the book is about people who live in one small part of a great city being forced by circumstances to come to grips with the totality of it, the immensity of it, the diversity of it. And not all the epithets are relating to black people by a long shot–everybody gets a dose of verbal buckshot.\n\nWhy is the use of the n-word startling here? Because we’re not used to seeing sympathetic white characters use it in a work that is comedic in nature. The most famous book in all of American literature that does that has been a source of controversy since its publication. That’s why I put an image of it up top. But the word has been far from absent from literature in English as a whole. Here’s a very incomplete list somebody compiled–dig the header. “Politically Incorrect Books.” Ever notice how people treat non-PC language as a bad thing when other people do it, and at the same time gutsy and irreverent when they do it? Yeah, looking at you, Bill Maher.\n\nVery unlikely that Dancing Aztecs will ever be required reading in American high schools, and in fact it aroused little if any controversy when it was published in 1976. It just barely got reviewed in the New York Times–fellow writer John Crosby, who doesn’t seem to be the least bit familiar with Westlake’s prior work, sticks in his two paragraph review at the end of a much longer review of something called Final Score, by somebody named Emmett Grogan, a then-infamous member of the counter-culture, and according to Crosby a terrible novelist, and yet he gets eight paragraphs to Westlake’s two. Go figure.\n\nI’m a bit shamefaced about laughing at this old-fashioned hilarity but, there it is. It’s funny Donald Westlake writes about women, blacks and homosexuals as if Women’s Lib, Gay Lib and Black Power had never been invented, or, at least, he had never heard of them. Some of the black black-outs are pure Uncle Tom and I’m sure Mr. Westlake will get a few letters telling him so.\n\nHistory does not record whether he ever did. It does record that Westlake finally used the word ‘gay’ to refer to same-sex oriented men in this book, having given up the fight to keep that word in the public domain. It records that the women in this book mainly know what they’re after, and aren’t shy about getting it. It records that there’s a youthful interracial couple (white girl, black boy) riding around on motorcycles as they celebrate their love, and they are treated with great sympathy by the omniscient narrator.\n\nThere are also some black Harlemites who do come across as stereotypes–though no more so than the ones who appear in the work of Chester Himes, who Westlake admired as much as any living writer. Obviously Himes does a vastly superior job writing about Harlem and its denizens, of transcending stereotypes. And Westlake would have been telling himself that while he was writing those scenes, but he wrote them anyway. If he’s going to write about the whole city, he’s got to write about Harlem. And if he’s going to show the the white characters from Queens, warts and all, he’s got to try and be even-handed, and show everybody’s warts, rich and poor, black and white, male and female, straight and gay.\n\nOne thing I’ve long noted is that the popular stereotypes about Irish people and black people in fiction were remarkably similar–as well as the real-life behaviors that originally inspired those stereotypes–Westlake assuredly noticed as well (and in one of the funniest and most insightful passages in any of the Harlem Detective novels, Chester Himes indicated he’d noticed that too–we’ll talk about that sometime).\n\nHow well it all works is a matter of opinion, but what we can say, we who have been following Mr. Westlake’s literary career since 1960 here on this blog, is that Mr. Crosby is full of it. Westlake knew very well what had been going on in the world around him, and had devoted some considerable attention to it in his work. And the way people were treated because of their color, religion, gender, or sexual persuasion mattered a very great deal to him. Because to him, the most sacred thing of all was the right of the individual to define him or herself.\n\nBut as he has a character say in Up Your Banners, “You can’t condescend up.” If you’re holding your fire selectively, that presumes that you on some level consider yourself superior to the people you’re sparing from your rain of satiric arrows. That you consider them too fragile to withstand a bit of good-natured mockery. Or words that they hear every day of their lives. Or a style of comedy they helped invent, and perpetuate to this day.\n\nAs the omniscient narrator, he’s looking down on everybody. But not as some old white man in the sky. More like a hovering hawk, looking down curiously, wondering what ails these strange creatures cavorting about below. But unlike the hawk, he can get into their heads, figure out what makes them tick. He’s not wholly impartial–some characters he likes much more than others. Well, some people are just assholes, you know? He tends to be hardest on the ones with money–or badges. Nobody can accuse Mr. Westlake of not having his little prejudices.\n\nIf nobody had ever been treated like a nigger, nobody would give a damn about the word. It says a lot for us that it’s still such a living part of the English language, and nothing good. But a language, a literature, that hides from the truth, that sanitizes and censors itself, is of no use to those of us who want to fight for something better. Good manners are fine and dandy, by all means let’s show each other respect, understand each others’ journeys better. I’d sooner cut out my tongue than throw that word at another human being, knowing full well he’s got no equivalently insulting word to throw back at me, due to a shared history any decent person should be ashamed to remember.\n\nBut for God’s sake, people–can’t we love each other? And love begins with intimacy–and laughter–and the ability to say what you think. If we’re going to love each other, it has to be warts and all. I’ll show you mine if you’ll show me yours. Maybe we can’t share a raft going down the Mississippi, but we can meet on the streets of many a fine city, and pass the time of day, and be glad of each other’s presence, because variety truly is the spice of life. The more the merrier. And no city in human history has ever embodied that principle quite like the setting of our next book.\n\nAnd now we’ve come to the dance portion of our program. Aztec priests in your places, please. All together now….."
