        "text": "Index of Mathematicians (and honorary mathematicians)\n\nThis index lists the individuals whose mathematics is celebrated on this site. Theorem of the Day's theorem descriptions generally include an attempt to attribute the theorem to specific people and it is these people who are currently included in this index. I would be very grateful to have inaccuracies brought to my attention (either by emailing me or writing in the Visitors' Book). If a personal hero of yours is missing from the list, please suggest a theorem of theirs which I can add to Theorem of the Day, thereby including them here.\n\nClicking on a theorem will take you to the pdf description of it offered by this website. Highlighting the theorem will also bring up its entry in the main theorem list where full information about the theorem entry may be found.\n\nClicking on the name of a mathematician will open a new window with their biography from, say, MacTutor, Numericana.com or Wikipedia, if one exists; failing that, you will get their own web page. Where I could find nothing helpful about them at all to link to you will get instead my list of mathematicians deserving a better web presence ...\n\nThe page features pop-up menus, potentially an enemy to accessibility. It will probably work on Android phones but not iPhones. I borrowed the css from Andrey Ciclicci. Thank you also to John H. Halton whose idea this index was.\n\nA B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z"
