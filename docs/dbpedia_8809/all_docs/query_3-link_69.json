It was an immediate success, ringing up $2 billion in sales. Even today, the building continues to break real-estate sales records.\n\nSource: “House of Outrageous Fortune” by Michael Gross\n\n15 CPW architect Robert A.M Stern was inspired by the great New York apartments of the 1920s, not today’s glassy towers. The building has two sections with 201 units total, as well as a formal driveway.\n\nSource: “House of Outrageous Fortune” by Michael Gross\n\nOther amenities include a library, private restaurant, three-lane lap pool, and health club with private massage rooms and yoga area.\n\nSource: “House of Outrageous Fortune” by Michael Gross\n\nThe facade of the building is completely covered in limestone, which cost millions of dollars more than brick. The lobby is also opulent, with English oak panels, fluted marble columns, and two fireplaces. There’s even a waiting room for chauffeurs.\n\nSource: “House of Outrageous Fortune” by Michael Gross\n\nIt’s only been open for five years, but the list of well-known people who have lived or currently live at 15 CPW is astounding.
