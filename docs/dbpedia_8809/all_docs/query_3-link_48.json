        "text": "I finally got into Union Square and at a nice time of the year. The park was packed with people sunning themselves, reading and enjoying the sunshine. The Farmers Market was in full swing and offered so many wonderful things for sale.\n\nWhat a beautiful day to start the walk in Union Square Park\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d136291-Reviews-Union_Square-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nI was able to tour the neighborhood twice in the two day period over Father’s Day Weekend once at twilight just as the sun was setting and the lights were coming on at the cafes and restaurants and then the next morning after breakfast on a clear and sunny day. The buildings took on two different personalities at different times of the day.\n\nThe first part of the walk was revisiting lower Fifth Avenue from West 20th to West 14th Streets. Again which I had just covered for my blogs on the Lower Flatiron District. Just after the Civil War to WWI, the was the Midtown Manhattan of that era with the banking and shopping districts where you still see these traces in the beauty of the buildings. From Beaux-Arts to Neo-Classical, these former headquarters buildings were meant to impress. I started my tour passing the same Fifth Avenue buildings that share the border with the Lower Flatiron District.\n\nI passed 156 Fifth Avenue as I walked this part of the neighborhood again and admired it for its detailed stonework carving and unusual styled roof. The Presbyterian Building was built in 1893 and was designed by architect James B. Baker and was designed in the French Gothic style. It was to be used by the Presbyterian Church as their base for domestic and foreign missions and used as office space. The Panic of 1893 changed that, and they had to lease the space out (Daytonian in Manhattan).\n\n156 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/156-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/14050649/\n\nhttp://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/02/presbyterian-building-156-fifth-avenue.html\n\nI then took the long walk down Fifth Avenue and all the architectural treasures it contains. This was once the core of the old ‘Midtown Manhattan’ after the Civil War and the City started its march uptown.\n\n148 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/148-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/property/148-5th-ave-new-york-ny-10011/36061-08210041/\n\nThis unique office building was built in 1900 as a office building. This building is currently under renovation.\n\nThe details on 148 Fifth Avenue\n\nThe details of 148 Fifth Avenue\n\nThe next interesting building on the walk down Fifth Avenue was 119 Fifth Avenue which had just finished being renovated.\n\n119 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/13021/119-5-Ave-New-York-NY-10003/\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/119-5th-avenue-new_york\n\n119 Fifth Avenue at the corner of East 19th Street in the Flatiron District neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City was built in 1905-06 and was designed by John H. Duncan in the neo-Renaissance style. It was built to be an annex to the Lord & Taylor department store buildings which took up most of the square block between Broadway and Fifth Avenue and East 19th and 20th Streets, being connected by bridge to two of them. After Lord & Taylor moved uptown in 1914, the building had multiple uses (Wiki).\n\nThe details of 119 Fifth Avenue\n\nThe details of 119 Fifth Avenue\n\nOne of the most impressive buildings in the neighborhood is the old Arnold Constable Store building that stretches from its Broadway entrance down the entire block on 18th Street to its Fifth Avenue entrance.\n\n115 Fifth Avenue-Arnold Constable Department Store\n\nhttps://buildingsofnewengland.com/tag/115-fifth-ave-nyc/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Constable_%26_Company\n\nhttps://www.realtyhop.com/building/115-5th-avenue-new-york-ny-10003\n\nThis seven-story department store building was designed by architect Griffith Thomas in 1868 for the prominent dry-goods company of Arnold Constable & Company. ‘The Palace of Trade’ as it became known as, is located stretches between Broadway and Fifth Avenue. The stunning Second Empire building is faced in marble, brick, and cast-iron, features stacked arch orders and a prominent, two-story, pavilioned mansard roof. Arnold Constable & Co. was founded by Aaron Arnold, who opened a small dry goods store in the city in 1825 (Buildings of New England).\n\nAs the business prospered he moved into larger quarters numerous times. In 1842, James Constable, an employee, married Arnold’s daughter Henrietta and was subsequently made a partner. From this, the company was renamed Arnold Constable & Co. In its heyday, Arnold Constable & Co. was the largest dealer to the elite in New York City, supplying the latest fashions to a clientele that included the leading families in the city (Buildings of New England).\n\n103 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/103-5-avenue-new_york\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/07/1896-beaux-arts-pierrepont-building-103.html\n\nThe building had an interesting history. The building was designed by architect Louis Korn and was designed in the Beaux-Arts design. It was completed in 1896 and it was named after Edwards Pierrepont, whose mansion had stood on the site before the construction of the building. When it opened the building was popular small publishing and mercantile companies (Dayonianinmanhattan.com).\n\nThe 103 Fifth Avenue details\n\n103 Fifth Avenue embellishments\n\nIn between the buildings there was plaque to Levi Parsons Morton, the former Governor of New York State and the Vice-President of the United States under President Benjamin Harrison. This is where his home was located.\n\nThe plaque of the former Vice-President’s home on Fifth Avenue.\n\nVice-President and former New York Governor Levi Parsons Morton\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_P._Morton\n\nOn the building is also the B. Shackman & Company sign for a now long gone Fifth Avenue toy business.\n\nThe B. Shackman & Company sign\n\nhttps://ephemeralnewyork.wordpress.com/tag/b-shackman-co/\n\nThe B. Shackman & Company sign was for the former B. Shackman & Company novelty and toy store that was located here until the 1970’s. The store once sold all sorts of novelties and gifts (Ephemeral New York.com/Consumer Grouch).\n\n91 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/91-93_Fifth_Avenue#:~:text=91%2D93%20Fifth%20Avenue%20is,built%20between%201895%20and%201896.\n\nhttps://www.propertyshark.com/mason/Property/12971/91-5-Ave-New-York-NY-10003/\n\nThis beautiful office building was designed by architect Louis Korn for businessmen Henry and Samuel Korn in 1896. The office building currently houses small companies (Wiki).\n\nThe details of women looking down at us on the street at 91 Fifth Avenue\n\nThe lion details on 91 Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe last building on this part of Fifth Avenue was under an extensive renovation and I was not able to get the pictures that I wanted but still you could see the details in the building around the renovations.\n\nLooking up Fifth Avenue from 16th Street\n\nThe Kensington Building was designed by architect Samuel Sass in the Beaux-Arts design and completed in 1906. Some of the first tenants of the building was the Milton Bradley company. The building was converted into a residential building in 1996 and were designed by architect Joseph Pell Lombardi (Landmark Branding LLC).\n\n73 Fifth Avenue\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/flatiron-union-square/the-kensington-73-fifth-avenue/4044\n\nThe details on 73 Fifth Avenue\n\nThis part of Fifth Avenue has kept its character all these years and now that these buildings are back in vogue because of their history and design detail, they are being refitted for modern times. These were once the headquarters of companies that are now long gone but are housing the new future companies leading us into the 21st Century.\n\nLooking up Fifth Avenue from 15th Street and the core of the Lower Flatiron District.\n\nWest 14th Street is a Hodge podge of building types and in various conditions. COVID really hit 14th Street businesses hard and between the pandemic, urban renewal of the neighborhood and changing tastes of building types, there is only a few buildings left from the era when this was a major shopping street at the turn of the last century. This was before everything moved up to the 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue area.\n\nMuch of the block between Fifth and Sixth Avenue is in the process of being knocked down, renovated or both. Still there are some architectural gems still left on the street.\n\nOn the corner of Fifth Avenue and West 14th Street is 80 Fifth Avenue.\n\n80 Fifth Avenue from the corner view\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/80-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/4632221/\n\n80 Fifth Avenue is an elaborately-detailed Renaissance Revival style office building that was constructed by the architecture firm of Buchman and Fox. This building was constructed in 1908 to be used as manufacturing and office space (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nSeeing better detail work on the building from the West 14th Street view.\n\nThis beautiful building’s lower and upper levels feature decorative floral and geometric ornamentation, elaborate cornices, and angled bay windows on the third floor. Ornamented pilasters are found at either side of these windows, with slightly more austere middle floors and in its arched windows and elaborate ornamentation at the top story (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nThe beautiful detail work on 80 Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe building’s history has a long past of companies that have worked in these offices but the most prominent had been the creation of the gay organization, The National Gay Task Force. Among the Task Force’s accomplishments during the time it was located at 80 Fifth Avenue included getting the American Psychiatric Association to end its classification of homosexuality as a mental illness; getting the federal government to end its ban on employing gay or lesbian people in any federal agencies (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nWhen I turned to the corner and walked down East 14th Street, I know seeing developers attempt to rid Union Square of its once seedy past. As I pass the park itself, I still remember the days when this was a major drug haven, a major methadone clinic was located here and sensible people stayed far away from Union Square Park. It took Danny Meyers and the creation of Union Square Cafe in 1985 at 101 East 19th Street and then the closing of the methadone clinic to change all that. The popularity of the Farmers Market and the renovation of the park in the late 1980’s changed the complexity of the neighborhood.\n\nThe original Union Square Cafe at 21 East 16th Street\n\nhttps://www.unionsquarecafe.com/about/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d457829-Reviews-Union_Square_Cafe-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy father and I on Father’s Day at the original Union Square Cafe for lunch in early 2000’s\n\nThere were also a series of buildings around the square that were knocked down and new buildings built in their place most notably the old S. Klein on the Square building replaced by a new office building, a branch of NYU opening on the southern end of the park and the Zeckendorf Towers buildings at One Union Square changed the who complexity of Union Square into a desirable neighborhood. In the 21st Century, it is now becoming a trendy neighborhood catering to the tech industry.\n\nEven more changes are on there way:\n\nhttps://www.curbed.com/2021/01/union-square-park-partnership-plan.html\n\nAs I crossed Fifth Avenue to West 14th Street towards Union Square I remembered that this was the most southern part of the old Ladies Shopping District before the Civil War. It had been the theater district as well with the Academy of Music closer to Irving Street. After the Civil War, the shopping and theater district moved uptown towards 23rd Street, then to 34th Street and then ending at 42nd Street.\n\nBetween Fifth Avenue and Broadway along the southern border of Union Square, there is not much left of that shopping district. Many of the older buildings had been knocked down in the early 1900’s for new stores and since then much of the non-landmarked buildings were again knocked down in the early 1980’s to improve the district. S. Klein stood empty from 1975, when it closed for business to 1983 when it finally was knocked down for the Zeckendorf Towers and that changed the district forever (Wiki).\n\nStill when I walked from Fifth Avenue to Union Square there was one building that stood out amongst all the new late 20th buildings on 14th Street and that was 22-26 East 14th Street.\n\nThis impressive building at 22-26 East 14th Street built along the former Ladies Shopping Mile was once meant to impress. This was once the home for Baumann Brothers Furniture & Rugs\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-baumann-bros-bldg-no-22-26-east.html\n\nThe building was designed by architects David and Jon Jardine for successful textile merchant James McCreery in 1881. The building was designed in the Neo-Grec and Neo-Classical design and until 1897 was the home for Baumann Brothers Furniture and Carpet store. It then passed to Woolworth’s and the broken up for other retailers. It is now home to Footlocker but you can still see the beauty in this building with its elaborate embellishments (DaytonianinManhattan.com)\n\nYou really have to stop and look at its Neo-Classical details to really appreciate this building\n\nThe intricate details of the McCreery Building\n\nThe floral details in the middle of the building\n\nI got a chance to walk around Union Square once I finished my tours of Fifth Avenue and East 14th Street. It was a beautiful sunny day and people were outside enjoying the sun and shade in the park. The Farmers Market was going on which made it even busier. By the subway station, there were guys hustling to play chess. A typical day in Union Square Park. Thirty years ago just like Bryant Park or Madison Square Park, sensible people stayed away from these squares of green with the garbage and graffiti and drug dealing. How a City transforms itself over a period of time is confounding. From the ashes of COVID, another New York City is rising.\n\nWhat impresses me the most about the park is that the crazy protestors never knocked our statues down. Inside Union Square are three very prominent and very famous statues of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and General Lafayette.\n\nGeorge Washington\n\nhttps://www.mountvernon.org/george-washington/\n\nWe are lucky that our statues were not knocked down like other cities in 2020. This impressive statue of General Washington sits at the entrance of Union Square.\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/1676\n\nThis impressive statue of George Washington was designed by sculptor Henry Kirke Brown and was dedicated in 1856. The moment Brown depicts is that of Evacuation Day, November 25, 1783, when Washington reclaimed the city from the British. With outstretched hand, he signals to the troops in a gesture of benediction (NYCParks.org).\n\nArtist Henry Kirke Brown\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kirke_Brown\n\nArtist Henry Kirke Brown was an American born artist who had studied with artists in Italy for his training. He is best known for his figurative historical statues. He also designed the statue of Abraham Lincoln in Union Square.\n\nOn the southern part of Union Square is the Climate Clock atop the NYU Dorms at 60 East 14th Street. The facade of the building makes quite the statement above Union Square if you stop to look at its details.\n\nThe new climate clock and NYU dorms replaced the once seedy shopping district the was Union Square at 60 East 14th Street\n\nhttps://climateclock.world/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Clock\n\nThe view of Union Square through the ages:\n\nThe Climate Clock melds art, science, technology, and grassroots organizing to get the world to #Actin Time. The project is centered on a simple tool: a clock that counts down the critical time window to reach zero emissions (our “Deadline”), while tracking our progress on key solution pathways (“Lifelines”) By showing us what we need to do by when, the Clock frames our critical mission — a rapid and just transition to a safe climate future — and puts it at the very forefront of our attention (Climateclock.world.com).\n\nThe building that single handedly changed Union Square (outside of Union Square Cafe) was the Zeckendorf Towers. This replaced the long closed S. Klein Department store that had closed in 1975 and lead to the seediness of the area. The store had been boarded up for years and led to the downfall of Union Square in the early 1980’s.\n\nS. Klein Department Store on Union Square East was boarded up for years\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Klein\n\nWhen the store was torn down to make way for the Zeckendorf Towers, this completely changed the area. That and the renovation of Union Square in the late 1980’s and the creation of the Union Square Farmers Market made this a desirable area once again.\n\nThe Zeckendorf Towers at One Irving Place/One Union Square East\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeckendorf_Towers\n\nThe success of the Zeckendorf Towers changed the complexity of the neighborhood for years to come replacing the S. Klein Department store. The residential building was designed by the architectural firm of Davis, Brody & Associates and was name for owner William Zeckendorf. The building was finished in 1987.\n\nTucked off in the corner of the park is the statue of General Lafayette. Why this important figure of the Revolutionary War is hidden is unfortunate.\n\nThe statue of General Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, Marquis de La Fayette\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/884\n\nGeneral Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier de La Fayette, Marquis de La Fayette\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette\n\nThe larger-than-life-sized figure was sculpted by Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, who also designed the Statue of Liberty (1886), another gift from the French government that figures prominently in New York Harbor. The granite pedestal designed by H.W. DeStuckle was donated by French citizens living in New York. (NYCParks.org).\n\nArtist Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Auguste_Bartholdi\n\nFrederic Auguste Bartholdi was a French born artist best known for designing the Statue of Liberty. Bartholdi attended the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris where he graduated in 1852. He then went on to study architecture at the Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-Arts (Wiki).\n\nAs the sun started to set on this Sunday afternoon, I passed 4 Irving Place which the first couple of floors were under scaffolding. I admired the clocktower on the top of the building, the beautiful embellishments and just the elegance of the building. The building is home to Consolidated Edison (ConEd).\n\nThe was designed by architect Henry Janeway Hardenbergh and architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore in the Neo-Classical design. The first phase of the building was started in 1911 and both phases were finished by 1929. The original section of the building is in the picture with the wings of the building to both sides (Wiki).\n\nI passed 4 Irving Place, the Con Ed Building, just as twilight hit the building and you could see the beauty in its shadows.\n\nIts clock told the time of the early evening.\n\nThe next morning when I walked past it again, you could see the true beauty of its design.\n\nI also noticed that the roof top held a more intricate design than I noticed the night before. Look up at its intricate details to admire its beauty. This is part of the originally designed building.\n\nOnce I turned onto Irving Place, the old core of its industrial past gave way to the bohemian village it would become and stay in the future. This was once ‘THE’ neighborhood to live in and has stayed that way since even through the rough times of Union Square.\n\nThe most impressive object you will see in the neighborhood is this bust of Washington Irving that sits outside the Washing Irving Campus on Irving Place.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving_Campus\n\nThis bust of Washington Irving was created by artist Friedrich Beer\n\nArtist Friedrich Beer\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Beer\n\nhttps://www.artprice.com/artist/112959/friedrich-beer\n\nArtist Friedrich Beer was a German born artist known for his works on busts of famous individuals.\n\nThe neighborhood goes from commercial to more residential as you get further up Irving Place and closer to Gramercy Park. The borders of Union Square overlap with Gramercy Park and the Flatiron District between East 18th and East 20th streets so I revisited buildings that J had seen before. If people went in a Time Machine to Manhattan from 100 years ago they would still see the same buildings but with totally different uses.\n\nThe Washington Irving house at 122 East 17th Street and Irving Place (Washington Irving never lived here)\n\nhttps://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-irving-house-new-york-new-york\n\nThe “Irving House” was built by Peter Voorhis between 1843 and 1844, along with the adjacent two houses at 45 and 47 Irving Place. The original tenants of 49 Irving Place (at that time referred to as 122 East 17th Street) were Charles Jackson Martin, an insurance executive, and his wife, who would reside there from 1844 until 1852. Henry and Ann E. Coggill would live in it in 1853, and in 1854 it would become the home of banker Thomas Phelps and his wife Elizabeth, who would remain until 1863 (Atlasobsucra.com).\n\nThe front of the house facing Irving Place\n\nThe first mention in print of Irving having lived in the house came in the Sunday Magazine Supplement of the New York Times on April 4, 1897. The article is a human interest story about Elsie de Wolfe and the means and methods she used to decorate “Irving’s house.” In 1905, de Wolfe would become known as the first professional interior decorator and it appears this article is an early attempt at publicity for her. As for the information about Irving, the article takes enormous liberties (actually, it flat-out makes things up), claiming that Irving had conceived of the house himself and was very particular about the architecture and design (Atlasobsucra.com).\n\nThe entrance to the house at 122 East 17th street\n\nThe plaque on the house dedicated to the writer created by artist Alexander Finta\n\nIn 1930, a restaurant called the Washington Irving Tea Room was operating in the basement of the building and in 1934 a plaque sculpted by Rodin-student Alexander Finta was put up on the north facade that would cement the story in the public consciousness. Today, the surrounding area remains covered in references to Irving, from the large art installations in the nearby W Hotel to the Headless Horseman pub on 15th Street(Atlasobsucra.com).\n\nArtist Alexander Finta\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Finta\n\nhttps://www.askart.com/artist/Alexander_Finta/108330/Alexander_Finta.aspx\n\nArtist Alexander Finta was a Hungarian born artist who moved to the United States in 1923. He had studied mechanical engineering in his own country and had studied with Auguste Rodin. His is known for his elaborate busts. He spent the remainder of his career at 20th Century Fox Studios (Wiki)\n\nAll along the Irving Place corridor, the street is lined with interesting and historical buildings many of them turned into restaurants or inns. There are many historic plaques in this neighborhood and some creative architecture. The first building that caught my eye was 53 Irving Place, which is the home of Pierre Loti Wine Bar.\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d2136974-Reviews-Pierre_Loti_Wine_Bar-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nThe home of Pierre Lotte Mediterranean Restaurant at 53-55 Irving Place was the home of O Henry\n\nWhen I looked at the side of the building near the entrance, I was this historic plaque that said that this was the home of author William Sidney Porter (O. Henry). The author lived here from 1903-1907 and wrote the “Gift of the Magi” while living here and eating at Pete’s Tavern across the street (Wiki).\n\nThe historic plaque for author O Henry at 53-55 Irving Place\n\nAuthor William Henry Porter\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._Henry\n\nDown the road at is Pete’s Tavern, one of the most famous and the oldest literary restaurants in the City. The restaurant was founded in 1864 as the Portman Hotel and then in 1899 when changed to Healy’s Cafe when it was run by John and Tom Healy. Then in 1899, it was bought by Peter D’ Belles and renamed Pete’s Tavern. The restaurant was a ‘Speakeasy’ during prohibition and the dining rooms have not changed much over the last over hundred years (Pete’s Tavern website).\n\nPete’s Tavern was busy on the night of my first part of the walk.\n\nPete’s Tavern at 129 East 18th Street\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete%27s_Tavern\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d527869-Reviews-Pete_s_Tavern-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nThe entrance of Pete’s Tavern\n\nThe entrance to Pete’s Tavern on Irving Place\n\nThe painting outside of Pete’s Tavern of the Speakeasy years\n\nPete’s Tavern was busy both nights that I passed it. I had not eaten there in over a decade when I had a holiday dinner there with friends by I remember the food and service being excellent. The restaurant is really special during the Christmas holiday season from what I can remember.\n\nMy friends Barbara, Lillian and I after dinner at Pete’s Tavern in the early 2000’s\n\nAnother restaurant I went to before my friend, Barbara, moved to Florida was a Friend of the a Farmer at 77 Irving Place, a farm to table concept before it became very popular. I remember the food being wonderful but the place being a bit noisy. She lived on the fringe of Gramercy Park and had passed this restaurant many times and had wanted to try it that evening.\n\nAnother great restaurant is Friend of a Farmer at 77 Irving Place\n\nhttps://www.friendofafarmer.com/\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d496790-Reviews-Friend_of_a_Farmer-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nAcross the street, I passed this apartment building at 76 Irving Place. I loved the outside embellishments on the building and the friendly looks you get from the statuary. The building was built in 1897 by architect Lyndon P. Smith (Corcoran Group).\n\nYou have to look up to admire the details of 76 Irving Place\n\nhttps://www.corcoran.com/listing/for-sale/76-irving-place-manhattan-ny-10003/23012133/regionId/1\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/76-irving-place-new_york\n\nThe entrance to 76 Irving Place with its tiny angels\n\nThis woman greets you at 76 Irving Place\n\nThe classic architecture of the block especially as you get closer to Gramercy Park changes from smaller apartment buildings to brownstones lining the parks southern border. Gramercy Park offers some of the most interesting architecture. This ivy covered building that impressed me so much as the sun was going down is at 80 Irving Place.\n\n80 Irving Place is currently under renovation\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2014/04/the-1854-house-at-no-80-irving-place.html\n\nhttps://www.trulia.com/home/80-irving-pl-new-york-ny-10003-31506439\n\nThe house was built as a single family mansion between 1853 and 1854 and had been the home of the prominent Wood family and then to actress Agnes Ethel Tracy. Since 1987, it has been a single family home again. What I thought was interesting was that the house was used in the movie “Working Girl” as Sigourney Weavers character’s home (DaytoninManhattan.com).\n\n81 Irving Place in all its glory\n\nhttps://www.elliman.com/newyorkcity/buildings-communities/detail/527-c-725-2766/81-irving-pl-gramercy-park-new-york-ny\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/81-irving-place-new_york\n\nhttps://www.apartments.com/81-irving-pl-new-york-ny-unit-8a/5q6z3mp/\n\n81 Irving Place is one of the most beautiful apartment complexes in the city that I have come across.

I have always loved this building since I fell in love with the neighborhood over thirty years ago. I always wanted a home with a key to Gramercy Park. The building has that classic turn of the last century look about it and it has always been my dream to live here when I retire. I need to hurry and win the lottery.\n\nMy dream home would be at 19 Gramercy Park South with a key to the park\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19_Gramercy_Park_South\n\nI had thought this was a apartment building but it is actually a single family mansion with 37 rooms. It was built in 1845 and when the mansion was extended by Stamford White in 1887 was the home of socially prominent Stuyvesant-Fish family. It is currently back to being a single family mansion (Wiki).\n\nAs I turned the corner at East 20th Street I never tire of peering into Gramercy Park and keep wishing for that key. Gramercy Park is still one of the most beautiful and fantastical parks in New York City. It has once been part of the Stuyvesant estate and got its name from Gramercy Farm that once stood here. It is the only piece of the old Rose Hill Farm still in existence (Wiki).\n\nGramercy Park on a glorious Spring day\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramercy_Park\n\nAnother view of Gramercy Park\n\nI love the beauty of this park. There is an English feel to this park that reminds me of London and some of the neighborhoods that I visited it there. I have never been inside the park but it would be fun to walk around. I found out from researching for another blog on the Rose Hill neighborhood is that Gramercy Park is the corner and last surviving parcel of the old Rose Hill Farm.\n\nEast 20th street across from the park has some of the most interesting brownstones in Manhattan. They add to the historic value of the neighborhood. When you turn the corner of Gramercy Park off Irving Place, you will see the classic architecture that surrounds the park. It is one of the most picturesque neighborhoods in Manhattan.\n\nThe beauty of East 20th Street across from Gramercy Park\n\nRight across the street from the park sits one of the best known brownstones in the neighborhood housing the “Players Club”. This club was made famous by the movie “Manhattan Murder Mystery’” for the wine tasting scene.\n\nThe “Players Club” at 16 East 20th Street\n\nhttps://theplayersnyc.org/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_(New_York_City)\n\nThe historic plaque on the building\n\nThe scene from “Manhattan Mystery”:\n\nThe movie “Manhattan Murder Mystery” by director Woody Allen was shot in the neighborhood\n\nThe mansion was built in 1847 and was the home of Valentine G. Hall. The building was bought by actor Edwin Booth, the older brother of John Wilkes Booth who assassinated President Lincoln. He kept a suite for himself at the top of the home and then turned the rest of the building into the “Players Club” in 1888. The club now serves as a social club with artifacts of the theater arts on display and a private restaurant (Wiki).\n\nI loved the entrance way to 13 East 20th Street\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/13-east-20-street-new_york\n\nThis Co-Op building was built in 1910 and has the most elegant appearance at the entrance. This really looks like old New York.\n\nI love the elegance of 13 East 20th Street\n\nAnother historical building on the block was 10 East 20th Street which was the home of painter Robert Henri.\n\nEast 20th Street the home to painter Robert Henri\n\nThe historic marker for painter Robert Henri\n\nArtist Robert Henri\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Henri\n\nhttps://www.nga.gov/collection/artist-info.1391.html\n\nArtist Robert Henri was an American born artist. He studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts Philadelphia and at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He is best known for his works in the Impressionism movement (Wiki).\n\nAs I crossed Park Avenue South, I entered the familiar neighborhood of the Flatiron District meeting the bottom of the Rose Hill neighborhood. This is when Manhattan neighborhood borders get confusing. Since the Union Square technically ends at East 18th Street but that would leave two blocks open without being in a specific neighborhood, I stretched it to East 20th Street. This again borders the Flatiron and Rose Hill/NoMAD section of the City. I figure that I will let the realtors figure this one out.\n\nWhen you cross the border at Park Avenue South, I admired the same buildings I had seen several month earlier when I walked these streets and avenues just as Fall semester at NYU began.\n\nThe building at 250 Park Avenue South houses the restaurant Barbounia in the base of the building.\n\nBarbounia 250 Park Avenue\n\nhttps://barbounia.com/\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d611431-Reviews-Barbounia-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\n250 Park Avenue South was designed by architects Rouse & Goldstone in 1911 in the Neo-Classical design.\n\nThe detail work on 250 Park Avenue South\n\nhttps://www.officespace.com/ny/new-york/2231029-250-park-avenue-south\n\nThe restaurant ‘Barbounia’ at 250 Park Avenue South\n\nThe detail work above the doorway to the building\n\nNext to this building is another beautiful historic building at 42 East 20th Street, housing another great restaurant, The Gramercy Tavern.\n\nThe Gramercy Tavern\n\nhttps://www.gramercytavern.com/\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d424094-Reviews-Gramercy_Tavern-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\n42 East 20th Street\n\nhttps://www.14to42.net/20streete042.html\n\n42 East 20th Street was designed by the architectural firm of Neville & Bagge and was built in 1890 in the Beaux-Arts design.

It had been closed for so long after COVID I never thought it would open any time soon. It did finally open late last year and I thought this was one of the most interesting of the historical homes in the City. This one had been completely recreated by the family and then furnished with family heirlooms from the original house. That makes for an interesting museum.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt\n\nThe Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site at 28 East 20th Street\n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/thrb/index.htm\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d143273-Reviews-Theodore_Roosevelt_Birthplace_National_Historic_Site-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nMy review on VistingaMuseum.com:\n\nAt 28 East 20th Street is the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace Historic Site, which is an exact replication of the original home that President Theodore Roosevelt was born and raised. The house that originally stood on the site was built in 1848 and was bought by the Roosevelts in 1854. Theodore Roosevelt was born there on October 27, 1858, and lived in the house with his family until 1872, when the neighborhood began to become more commercial and the family moved uptown (Wiki).\n\nThe Roosevelt House Living Room\n\nThe original building was demolished in 1916 to make way for retail space, but upon the death of Roosevelt in 1919 the lot was purchased and the house rebuilt by the Women’s Roosevelt Memorial Association, which eventually merged with the Roosevelt Memorial Association in 1953 to form the Theodore Roosevelt Association.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt’s bedroom\n\nNoted female American architect Theodate Pope Riddle was given the task of reconstructing a replica of the house, as well as designing the museum, situated next door, that serves to complete the site (Wiki).\n\nThe Parlor of the house\n\nYou have to take time when the museum is open to take the independent tour. When you walk around the house you will swear that the family had just left the room to grab something. It is well worth the trip to see how the family lived before they moved uptown.\n\nThe next building on the block that is unique is 7 East 20th Street, the old Holtz Building.\n\nThe ornate, Beaux-Arts edifice was erected in 1907 as a commercial building with the Holtz Restaurant located on the lower two floors. In the early 1900’s Phillip Braender commissioned architect William C. Frohne to design a 12-story building, with the lower two floors being specifically customized and designed to house for the Holtz Restaurant. The Holtz was a high-end establishment catering to the upper echelon of the population and converted to condo lofts in 1987 (Corcoran Group.org/Streeteasy.org)\n\nhttps://www.cityrealty.com/nyc/flatiron-union-square/holtz-house-7-east-20th-street/354\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/7-east-20-street-new_york\n\nThe embellishments by the doorway\n\nThe Holtz Company sign at the top of the building\n\nThe elegant details at the top of the building guard over the people who work here\n\nAnother great building on the block is the Hudson Company building at East 20th Street. This is a mixed use building that was built in 1910.\n\n5 East 20th Street used to be a former carriage house.\n\nhttps://streeteasy.com/building/5-east-20-street-new_york\n\nAfter I finished the walk down East 20th Street, I walked back down Fifth Avenue to Union Square Park in the mid afternoon to see what was going on. There was a smaller version of the bigger weekend Farmers Market.\n\nThe Union Square Greenmarket in full swing on a sunny afternoon\n\nhttps://www.grownyc.org/greenmarket/manhattan-union-square-m\n\nAfter walking through all the stands and admiring the wares and the baked goods, I wanted to cool down with a walk through the park. I never really noticed all the beautiful statuary in the park before. There is a lot of interesting and famous works in the park.\n\nThe golden plaque on the sidewalk outside Union Square Park with the original layout of the park\n\nNew Yorkers relaxing on a warm sunny afternoon in Union Square Park\n\nWhen I walked around the park, I noticed more and more artwork and statuary around the park. This flagpole is located in the middle of the park. You really have to walk around the base to appreciate the details the artist created on this.\n\nThe Independence Flagstaff in Union Square Park\n\nAlthough this flagstaff commemorates the 150th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, it is also known as the Charles F. Murphy Memorial Flagpole. The intricate bas-reliefs and plaques were completed in 1926 by sculptor Anthony De Francisci and feature a procession of allegorical figures representing democracy and tyranny, the text of the Declaration of Independence, and emblems from the original 13 colonies. The enormous flagpole, said to be one of the largest in New York State, is capped with a gilded sunburst (NYCParks.org).\n\nArtist Anthony De Francisci\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_de_Francisci\n\nhttps://americanart.si.edu/artist/anthony-de-francisci-1173\n\nArtist Anthony De Francisci is an Italian born artist whose family were stone carvers by trade. He studied at Copper Union and the National Academy of Design when he moved to New York City. He is known for his known for his work as a sculptor and his design of American currency.\n\nThe details are amazing on the flagstaff\n\nLocated at the northern end of the Union Square is the prominent statue of President Lincoln. This statue stands and overlooks the lawn of the park.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/abraham-lincoln/\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/913\n\nThis impressive statue of Abraham Lincoln was designed by sculptor Henry Kirke Brown and was dedicated in 1870. In his statue of Lincoln, cast in 1868, and dedicated September 16, 1870, he combines a classically styled pose with a perceptive naturalism, uniting realistic detail with an idealistic stance (NYCParks.org).\n\nArtist Henry Kirke Brown\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kirke_Brown\n\nArtist Henry Kirke Brown was an American born artist who had studied with artists in Italy for his training. He is best known for his figurative historical statues. He also designed the statue of George Washington in Union Square.\n\nThere is a lot more to Union Square than just the park. There is interesting architecture. Historic statuary, wonderful restaurants and great selection of stores.\n\nThe amazing part about Union Square is the transformation of the area in the past thirty years from a park that everyone avoided to one that people could not live without. From the days of being home to one of the biggest methadone clinics in the City to be home to Union Square Cafe which transformed the park, Union Square has become the gateway to Uptown.\n\nThe Northern end of Union Square Park\n\nThe neighborhood has transformed itself with hip cafes, expensive lofts and a Farmers Market that is the benchmark that all others hold themselves. Just watching people sit and relax in the park reminds me of how this area had changed. You have to walk the streets to see the influences of the past and the present and how it has it has morphed to the neighborhood that it has become.\n\nUnion Square Park on that sunny warm June afternoon\n\nAs I explored the borders of the park, I came across a statue of a mother and child. I never noticed that this was an old water fountain for the park. It is always blocked off by vendors during either the Farmers or Arts Markets. With nothing in front of it, I could finally see it in its full form.\n\nThe Union Square Drinking Fountain\n\nhttps://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/union-square-park/monuments/797\n\nConsisting of a bronze statuary group atop a granite stepped pedestal, it was crafted by German sculptor Karl Adolph Donndorf and donated by philanthropist Daniel Willis James to promote public health as well as the virtue of charity (NYCParks.org).\n\nArtist Karl Adolph Donndorf\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_von_Donndorf\n\nArtist Karl Adolph Donndorf was a German born artist know for his large realistic sculptures. He had served as an artist apprentice to further his education on sculpture (Wiki).\n\nJust looking at old pictures online of Union Square in the 1970’s and 80’s shows me the power and resilience of Manhattan. It just goes to show you how a City can reinvent itself even in the worst of times and keep morphing!\n\nThe other blogs on the Union Square neighborhood:\n\nDay Three Hundred and Thirteen: Walking the Borders of Union Square:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/48888\n\nDay Three Hundred and Seventeen: Walking the Avenues of Union Square:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/50233\n\nDay Three Hundred and Eighteen: Walking the Streets of Union Square:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/50516\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nWith Graduation behind me and in between Summer classes, I am finally exploring the streets below 23rd Street. I never thought I would get here. It had been two long semesters and the Christmas from hell. I don’t think my feet ever hit the floor. I just kept going.\n\nI finally got back to the Flatiron District. This is where the lines get a blurry with the neighborhoods. The Flatiron District overlaps with Union Square which overlaps with Gramercy Park. NoMAD mixes with the Flatiron District and Rose Hill and then Kips Bay and Gramercy Park again. It gets very confusing so I just repeat the roads in other neighborhoods. Since the official southern border of the Flatiron District is West 20th Street, I looked to the neighborhood to walk.\n\nThe Lower Flatiron District by McCreery’s Department store on 15th Street.\n\nI decided to defy what the relators say and I cut the neighborhoods by Avenues. I decided that Lower Flatiron District would be from West 20th to West 14th Streets between Sixth and Fifth Avenues. Union Square would be from West 20th to West 14th Streets between Fifth and Irving Place. From there I would finish Gramercy Park past Irving Place and then Lower Chelsea from West 23rd to West 14th Street from Sixth Avenue to Twelve Avenue. Have I confused you yet? It is for me and I am not sure if the residents of these communities know what neighborhood association to join.\n\nI started my walk along the northern section of the neighborhood which I had walked before the semester had started at NYU. I started on West 20th Street and it was like visiting an old friend. It was then I realized that I had not walked this neighborhood in two years and that a lot had changed in that time. I had finished walking it in 2022 before Grad school had even started.\n\nWalking through Chelsea to West 20th Street. I love how the purple in this restaurant stands out every summer.

These were once the headquarters of companies that are now long gone but are housing the new future companies leading us into the 21st Century.\n\nLooking up Fifth Avenue from 15th Street and the core of the Lower Flatiron District.\n\nWest 14th Street is a Hodge podge of building types and in various conditions. COVID really hit 14th Street businesses hard and between the pandemic, urban renewal of the neighborhood and changing tastes of building types, there is only a few buildings left from the era when this was a major shopping street at the turn of the last century. This was before everything moved up to the 23rd Street and Sixth Avenue area.\n\nMuch of the block between Fifth and Sixth Avenue is in the process of being knocked down, renovated or both. Still there are some architectural gems still left on the street.\n\nOn the corner of Fifth Avenue and West 14th Street is 80 Fifth Avenue.\n\n80 Fifth Avenue from the corner view\n\nhttps://www.loopnet.com/Listing/80-Fifth-Ave-New-York-NY/4632221/\n\n80 Fifth Avenue is an elaborately-detailed Renaissance Revival style office building that was constructed by the architecture firm of Buchman and Fox. This building was constructed in 1908 to be used as manufacturing and office space (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nSeeing better detail work on the building from the West 14th Street view.\n\nThis beautiful building’s lower and upper levels feature decorative floral and geometric ornamentation, elaborate cornices, and angled bay windows on the third floor. Ornamented pilasters are found at either side of these windows, with slightly more austere middle floors and in its arched windows and elaborate ornamentation at the top story (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nThe beautiful detail work on 80 Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe building’s history has a long past of companies that have worked in these offices but the most prominent had been the creation of the gay organization, The National Gay Task Force. Among the Task Force’s accomplishments during the time it was located at 80 Fifth Avenue included getting the American Psychiatric Association to end its classification of homosexuality as a mental illness; getting the federal government to end its ban on employing gay or lesbian people in any federal agencies (Kates, Ariel. Off the Grid).\n\nWalking past buildings that are being renovating or built much of what must have been there from the turn of the last century had been torn down and that beauty in the buildings that must have been the ‘Ladies Shopping District’ in the early 1900’s. The only other building on West 14th Street that had the same characteristics and beauty is 56 West 14th Street by the corner of West 14th and Sixth Avenue.\n\n56 West 14th Street-The former R. H. Macy Annex\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2023/06/the-r-h-macy-co-annex-56-west-14th.html\n\nThis Neo-Classically designed building was the annex to the original Macy’s store that stood at the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 14th Street. R.H. Macy Dry Goods originally opened in a small building (since demolished) on this corner in 1858, and as its success grew it expanded into a number of neighboring buildings. No. 56 was built in 1898 by then-owners Isador & Nathan Straus. It was designed by architects William Schickel and Isaac E. Ditmars (Moskowitz, Sam Off the Grid).\n\nThe elaborate embellishments of 56 West 14th Street\n\nThe interesting details of the building.\n\nFour years later, in 1902, the department store moved uptown to it’s present location on Herald Square, which is the current headquarters of the store.\n\nWalking up Sixth Avenue towards West 20th Street, there is again the same issue. Most of the more elaborate buildings are closer to the edge of West 20th Street. Walking back up toward the heart of the former “Ladies Garment Mile” along Sixth Avenue from West 18th Street to West 23rd Street, the lower part of Sixth Avenue is similar in look to West 14th Street. A mish-mosh architectural styles from years of knocking down the older buildings. Inside are a variety of fast food restaurants, coffee shops and small stores.\n\nThe first building left of the former shopping district is the former Pace Building at 610 Sixth Avenue.\n\n610 Sixth Avenue-The former Price building\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-price-buildling-604-612-sixth-avenue.html\n\nDavid Price opened his first women’s clothing store, D. Price & Co. around 1887. The Price Building was built in 1910-1912 and designed by Buchman & Fox in the Beaux-Arts style (Wiki). The was the combination of the two stores, the one facing Sixth Avenue and the one facing 18th Street (DaytoninManhattan.com).\n\nThe embellishments of 610 Sixth Avenue designed by Buchman & Fox.\n\nNext to the Price Building is what was one of the grandest of the department stores in New York City at 620 Sixth Avenue, Seigel Cooper\n\n620 Sixth Avenue-The former Siegal Cooper Department Store\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegel-Cooper_Company\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2010/08/big-store-1896-siegel-cooper-department.html#google_vignette\n\nThe original store design in the late 1800’s (New York Historical Society)\n\nThe Siegel-Cooper Department store was a Chicago based store that was founded in 1877 by Henry Siegel, Frank H. Cooper and Isaac Keim. They opened the New York City store in 1896 on the Ladies Mile Shopping District. The store was designed by the architectural firm of DeLemons & Cordes in the Beaux-Arts design. When it opened, it was the largest department store in the world until Macy’s opened in 1902 (Wiki).\n\nThe Siegal Cooper insignia on the building.\n\nThe window details\n\nThe details on the upper windows of the store.\n\nHenry Siegel over-extended himself and sold the company in 1902 to an investor and the store declared bankruptcy in 1915 and closed in 1917. After the store closed, it was used as a military hospital and then as a warehouse. Today after years of being used as a warehouse, it now has several retailers located in the store space (Wiki).\n\nAcross the street from the Siegel-Cooper store is the old B. Altman & Company store before they moved to East 34th Street.\n\n625 Fifth Avenue-The old B. Altman & Company Department Store.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._Altman_and_Company\n\nB. Altman & Company was founded in 1865 as a family store that eventually came under the control of Benjamin Altman. It moved from its Third Avenue and Tenth Street location to 621 Sixth Avenue in 1877. The store expanded four times in this location to cover what is now 625 Sixth Avenue. The store was designed in the Neo-Grec design and built in four stages. First by architects David and John Jardine for the original store in 1877 and then the extension in 1880. Then by architect William Hume in 1887 and then by architects Buchman & Fox in 1910. The store moved to the corner of Fifth Avenue and 34th Street in 1906 when the shopping district moved to 34th Street (Wiki).\n\nThe last old department store on the Ladies Mile Shopping District is at 641 Sixth Avenue on the corner of Sixth Avenue and West 20th Street.\n\n641 Sixth Avenue-The old Simpson Crawford Department Store\n\nhttps://daytoninmanhattan.blogspot.com/2011/12/exclusive-1902-simpson-crawford-dept.html#google_vignette\n\nSimpson Crawford like many stores on Sixth Avenue had its humble beginnings on 19th Street. The store continued to grow and expand catering to the ‘carriage trade’ and selling the finest merchandise. After their new store was destroyed in a fire in 1880, they opened the store at 641 Sixth Avenue in 1899 which was designed by architectural firm William H. Hume & Son in the Beaux-Arts design (dayoninmanhattan.com).\n\nThe details of 641 Sixth Avenue.\n\nThis part of the Flatiron District feels so different from the northern part of the neighborhood. So much of it has disappeared over the years that the character has changed. It does not have the distinction of the blocks between 23rd and 20th streets. There are blocks of these types of buildings whereas the blocks of the old shopping districts of the early to late 1800’s from 14th to 18th Streets have slowly disappeared over time. Older buildings have since been replaced with modern office and apartment buildings. The buildings have even been refitted for apartments and for the growing college campuses in the area.\n\nWhile there are many architectural gems in this neighborhood, it just goes to show the progression of Manhattan and how things have changed in the last 100 years. The City keeps marching on. Still this section of the Lower Flatiron District shows just how important this part of the old “Midtown Manhattan” was from the Civil War until WWI. Just look up and admire all the details on each building. There are a surprise and delight for the eyes.\n\nThe Street art on West 15th Street off Sixth Avenue “I Love New York”\n\nRead my blog on Walking the Streets of the Lower Flatiron District:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/47757\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nI got an email during Spring Break that Cornell Basketball was going to be playing Yale for the Ivy League Championships. We had an Alumni get together at the Lion Head Tavern at 995 Amsterdam Avenue before the game and we would be heading up for the game. You know that nothing works out the way you think it will.\n\nLion’s Head Tavern at 995 Amsterdam Avenue\n\nhttps://www.lionsheadnyc.com\n\nReview on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60763-d5842687-Reviews-Lion_s_Head_Tavern-New_York_City_New_York.html\n\nBy the time I got to the Alumni get together at the Lion Head Tavern which is several blocks from the gym it was almost over. It had been a long morning for me and try getting a bus to cooperate getting into Manhattan on a Saturday and then catching the subway uptown was interesting. I have to say that the tiny bar was PACKED with Alumni and current students having a good time before the game. The whole place both inside and outside the bar was spilling with Red and White. Everyone really thought we would win the Ivy League Championship. I thought so too with the current record we had for the season.\n\nWhen I got inside, all that was left was a salad that had seen better days and there was no dressing to it and some portobella mushroom burgers (Yuck!). I did not want to eat any mushy mushrooms. By that point at 1:30pm, everyone was heading up to the Levien Gymnasium where the game was taking place and I was starved, so I walked to Koronet Pizza on Broadway to have one their giant slices. I forgot how giant the slices are there.\n\nKoronet Pizza at 2848 Broadway\n\nhttps://www.koronetpizzany.com\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d426021-Reviews-Koronet_Pizza-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nI forgot how good the pizza was and how big these slices actually are. The cheese slice if cut into half could easily serve two hungry people. I downed the slice with a Coke before the game and it filled me up for the rest of the afternoon. It was so beautiful outside that the doors and windows were all open and the place was spilling with Cornell, Columbia and Princeton Alumni (Princeton had just lost to Brown in the Semi-Finals and they were all bummed).\n\nThe pizza slice is huge and takes up two plates.\n\nAfter this large lunch, I walked up to the gym to get tickets. At first they were trying to sell me the seatback tickets for $60.00 but I could not afford that nor did I want to pay that for a Ivy League game. Since I was traveling alone, I did get a ticket in the bleachers for $30.00 which I still thought was too high but I came all the way to see the game so I paid for my ticket and then had to run around the perimeter of the gym to get to my seats. The commentators were blocking the easy route to the bleachers.\n\nThe place was mostly a sea of red and white with the Yale Alumni tucked into two sets of the gym. Our band and cheerleaders were on top of the bleachers yelling and screaming. At that point were behind by ten points when I arrived in the first half of the game.\n\nThe Cornell Team in the huddle during the first half of the beginning of the game.\n\nThe start of the game when I got there.\n\nThe first half was not so great. We had lots of mistakes. We kept up with Yale, a team that we had beaten the last time and lost by two points the time before. I have to say that our side of the court was rather loud. I have found at Ivy League games no matter football or basketball, Cornell Alumni and students are far more the dominate members of the stands even at away games. I have been to Penn, Columbia and Yale games were we take up all the seats and do most of the cheering.\n\nIt was not much of a game for either side in the first half as we left at half time 37-25 with Yale ahead by twelve. I knew a score like this you could catch up in the second half as I have seen Michigan State (my undergraduate Alma Mater), come back from games with higher deficits. The problem with Cornell is that we kept missing all our shots and Yale kept making the three pointers. That was the difference in the game.\n\nThe second half was a bit better in the beginning. We started to catch up from the blood bath of the first half. We started to chip away at their lead. During the break, our cheerleaders came out and got the crowd going along with the band.\n\nThe Cornell Cheerleaders leading the way to a hopeful comeback and victory in the second half of the game.\n\nWe starting catching up in the second half and came out fighting. We were able to get the score within seven points with three and a half minutes left to the game. The crowds were exploding on the Cornell side and Yale got very quiet for about a minute and a half. It looked like the game was going to turn around.\n\nYou got to keep fighting!\n\nWe moved within seven points of the lead but we could not sustain the game. We kept missing the three point shots and easy layouts.\n\nThe teams battling it out but we could not put the game away.\n\nIn the end we chipped away to nine points but we could not come back from the deficient. We ended up losing by twelve points 69-57.\n\nI like all the other Alumni was bummed at the loss. Several I heard went back to the Tavern as the Columbia versus Princeton Girls Basketball Teams started their game. I decided to walk around the neighborhood as I had not been up here in several years to walk around. I had not released I had written my blogs here in 2017.\n\nI needed something sweet and remembered the bakery on Amsterdam Avenue that had been there for years that everyone kept raving about, Hungarian Pastry Shop. I stopped for some dessert. I had read and seen so many videos on the shop I wanted to try it. The lines were long all day and I had to get into the line for a half hour before I could get in.\n\nThe Hungarian Pastry Shop at 1030 Amsterdam Avenue\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hungarianpastryshopnyc\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d457265-Reviews-Hungarian_Pastry_Shop-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nThe pastry cases.\n\nI tried their version of the Napoleon, which was layers of Vanilla Cream, whipped cream and a caramel topping between the flaky layers and a Apple Strudel, that was loaded with fresh apples and cinnamon. I took the desserts across the street to the park and I have to tell you that they were terrific.\n\nThe pastries are amazing!\n\nI ate them at the park across the street and just relaxed and watch the world go by. I admired the statuary in the park which I had seen when I visited the park years ago on my walk through here.\n\nDown the long paths of plantings and around the bends of the property, I sat by the interesting statue at the center of the park. The breathtaking statue is called the “Peace Fountain”, created in 1985 which shows a unusual look at the battle between good and evil by artist Greg Wyatt, who was an artist in residence at the church.\n\nArtist Greg Wyatt\n\nhttps://gregwyattsculpture.com\n\nMr. Wyatt has graduated from Columbia College with BA in Art History and studied at National Academy of Design. He bases his work on the philosophy of the “spiritual realism’ merging realistic images and abstract forms of space, form and energy (Wiki).\n\nThe ‘Peace Fountain’ by artist Greg Wyatt\n\nThe sign from the sculpture.\n\nI decided rather than head off to a museum downtown, I would update my blogs in this part of the City and walk around Morningside Heights, Bloomingdale and parts of the Upper West Side. It was a nice afternoon and it was a chance to catch up and see what was going on in the neighborhoods and what had changed. I have to say that the SoHA section of Harlem (from 125th to 110th from Morningside Park to Fifth Avenue) has really changed and gentrified even more than I remembered. This was the same with the Bloomingdale section of the Upper West Side (from 110th to 94th Streets from Riverside Park to Central Park).\n\nMy blog on Morningside Park Day Sixty-Nine:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/3909\n\nMy blog on SoHA Day Sixty-Eight:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/3900\n\nMy blog on Bloomingdale Day Eighty-One:\n\nhttps://wordpress.com/post/mywalkinmanhattan.com/5822\n\nI walked all around Morningside Park amazingly enough not looking as dangerous as everyone said it was now. There were plenty of people walking their dogs, conversing in the park and playing basketball. The flowers were just starting to bloom and the park by the pond looked really pretty.\n\nMorningside Park in bloom\n\nThe pond area of Morningside Park\n\nThe pond with Columbia University in the background.\n\nI walked all around the streets and avenues looking at old restaurants that had closed or moved, businesses that changed hands and how much the neighborhoods have changed in seven years.\n\nWest Place Chinese Restaurant at 1288 Amsterdam Avenue\n\nhttps://www.seamless.com/menu/west-place-express-inc-1288-amsterdam-ave-new-york/4672840\n\nMy review on TripAdvisor:\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d5065901-Reviews-West_Place-New_York_City_New_York.html?m=19905\n\nMy review on DiningonaShoeStringinNYC@Wordpress.com:\n\nNot wanting to head home without eating dinner, I went to West Place Chinese Restaurant at 1288 Amsterdam Avenue for dinner and this time I tried the Boneless Spareribs with Fried Rice and an Egg Roll combination platter and the meal was excellent as usual. I had not eaten here in months and the food is consistently excellent. The portion size was larger than I remember from the last time. They really piled the food into the container.\n\nThe Boneless Spareribs with Fried Rice and an Egg Roll.\n\nThe Boneless Ribs were overflowing on the platter.\n\nThese sweet and juicy bites are full of flavor and piled into this small dish. There was enough food for two people.\n\nThe Egg Rolls are amazing.\n\nBy this time it was getting dark and I wanted to head home. I took the subway at 125th Street, got the joy of watching some kid jump the turn style and then headed up to take the subway back downtown.\n\nIt may not have been a good game but it gave me a chance to revisit several neighborhoods, update blogs, eat some terrific food and enjoy a day supporting Cornell University on what should have been our championship year (Yale eventually won the Ivy League Championship by one point over Brown and will go off to the NCAA Championship).\n\nStill it was a nice day out.
