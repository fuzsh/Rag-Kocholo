        "text": "The near-Earth objects we look for are mostly in the plane of the ecliptic, because that is where the vast majority of solar system material not in the Sun is to be found.\n\nThe object that is about to hit Earth is coming from an extremely high angle of inclination, either because it is an Oort cloud comet that got sent to the inner solar system or an interstellar object or nefarious aliens wanted to make sure the job got done right.\n\nSo a counterpoint to your view.\n\nThe world thinks there is no warning system, not because it doesn't exist, but because the world has no way to respond to this information. A world ending meteorite would travel at a speed and be of a size that not even any of our nuclear weapons could deter it!\n\nWhy doom the common folks with the knowledge they only have a week to live? Would the riots that ensue really better if we gave them weeks of notice vs just a few hours? The few hours warning would likely be since at that point they can't hide it anymore.\n\nIt could be an extra-solar object like 'Oumuamua. That would explain why it hadn't previously been detected. A sky survey might pick it up, but since it's heading almost directly towards us on a hyperbolic trajectory it would just be another small dot moving slowly across the sky and might not appear to be of much concern. But once it gets closer its brightness starts rapidly increasing and people start wondering what it is. By the time someone finds the sky survey data, calculates the trajectory, and realises what's about to happen, there isn't going to be much time before it does. This will probably be a civilisation-ending event due to the high velocity of the impactor.\n\nIf this did happen, I think it's quite plausible that we would have very little warning - the only problem is that an interstellar object on a collision course with Earth is fantastically unlikely - much, much more so than a regular meteorite strike.\n\nReally bad luck\n\nEstimates show that an asteroid in excess of 1 kilometer in diameter impacting Earth would be a civilization-kill event. While we have found over 90% of near earth 1-kilometer asteroids, 90% isn't 100%(As stated here https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/#:~:text=With%20over%2090%25%20of%20the,population%20larger%20than%20140%20meters.). There is a chance that a low albedo asteroid, obscured by the sun's glare, went unnoticed, and is on an impact course with Earth, or that a cataloged asteroid changed course due to weird interactions with other bodies, and is now h headed towards earth. And if it isn't a near-earth asteroid, then this is even more likely, and there is plenty of asteroids around.\n\nExtra justification for why it wasn't found when it was near Earth is because most scopes were trained on another flyby, causing them to miss this one, much like what happened in the Chelyabinsk asteroid, where it went unnoticed due to many telescopes being pointed at another asteroid doing a close flyby. Say, there is a really interesting comet doing a close flyby of Earth, meaning that few telescopes are looking for nearby asteroids. This might lead to it going completely unnoticed until the last second. While it is a bit unlikely, so is an asteroid impact in general, so that's the best I can come up with.\n\nSimple: You're looking for a needle in a haystack.\n\nHow much stuff is in the sky in your solar system? Few objects? Easy to track and spot... Many? harder to spot.\n\nMany upon many? harder and harder to spot.\n\nThe sky is full of stuff that's moving and it's hard to know what's going where and when it'll hit. It's a young system with lots of moving stuff.\n\nEdit: My idea could also work in an older universe where there's a lot of space debris. Basically, how can you tell if something big is coming your direction if there's a lot of clutter and objects to track? Even high tech could have issues tracking a massive cloud of asteroids, comets, space trash, etc.\n\nThere is a lot of research on this just now. Almost all money spent on space is wasted. We are not going to New Worlds, and bring back gold, tobacco, and slaves. However, spotting an earth-hitting asteroid and deflecting it could give a return on our investment: maybe biggest return of all in saving the Earth and everything on it. So there is a lot of research on this just now. If this object appeared today, then we are probably boned, but we are working on the answers.\n\nWe still do not know what is out there. Most of the incoming stuff belongs to the solar system and Oort Cloud, so it is mostly about the ecliptic. Interstellar objects such as Oumuamua are much rarer. A lot of the spotting is confined to the ecliptic.\n\nOumuamua was a long, thin object with a low albedo. We saw that. We don't have enough big telescopes looking in all directions yet, but we could. Unless this is an attack on Earth, the odds of something travelling interstellar distances, then hitting the earth are huge.\n\nIt is hard to spot objects close to the solar disc. However, if we are making a spotter network, the logical thing is to put telescopes out at Lagrange points L4 and L5. The greater parallax gives greater precision on the trajectory predictions. The other advantage is that if the object is coming at us 'out of the sun', it would be sixty degrees away for the next telescope.\n\nExtrapolating from your question a bit: suppose we had the defences against meteorites we are currently proposing, what naturally occurring and not wildly improbable object might take it by surprise?\n\nA sun-grazing trajectory would be hard to predict. The object may be coming in fast towards the sun, then get deflected through a significant angle. If it has volatiles, it may outgas violently, changing its orbit when it is close to the sun. It may be around the back of the sun when this happens. We get to see the modified trajectory too late to do anything about it.\n\nStarlink.\n\nActually, more generally, the clouds of satellites we are putting in orbit these days. They're a royal pain for the astronomers and will make it harder to detect rocks. A bit of bad luck blocking routine observations could mean a threat actually was seen but not noted as such--just because you see it doesn't tell you anything about the threat it poses. I believe the minimum is three observations to derive an orbit and precision is a function of both how accurate and how far apart they are.\n\nYour rock gets a streak across it a couple of times, the next time it's picked up it is at first thought to be a different rock. Eventually enough observations are made that someone thinks it might be coming close--then the big boys look, they get a parallax. Then the world collectively fills it's underwear.\n\nAssuming this is in the current Earth scenario, there are a few possibilities I can see and it depends on how much time you wanna give to the population:\n\nDecades: it is a very bad luck scenario of a direct hit from a body out of the solar system.\n\n%: It is not going to hit Earth, but the moon. A body hit the Moon an it was not very big or very fast, but its composition was unknown and something happened on impact: It exploded. With enough thrust to send many debris to Earth.\n\n(Very imaginative scenario now, not to say ridiculous) Years: Activity in a Saturn's moon (probably Enceladus) made it eject gases with enough thrust to change the moon's orbit. The change was enough to cause a chain reaction in its rings and some impacts later a giant ice body left the outer rings. It's coming in our direction. It is coming fast. It will destroy all the platypuses and the rest of Earth too."
