        "text": "Tag: Abe Birnbaum\n\nAn Industrial Classicist\n\nAbove: Walter Dorwin Teague's design for Kodak's \"Brownie\" camera, circa 1930. (Milwaukee Art Museum)\n\nWalter Dorwin Teague pioneered industrial design as a profession, firmly believing that great, heirloom-quality design could be available to all, and that even mass-produced objects could be beautiful if they possessed “visible rightness.”\n\nCultural critic Gilbert Seldes profiled Teague (1883–1960) in the Dec. 15 issue, and in this excerpt he examined the designer’s role in the streamlining craze that emphasized movement and speed in everything from locomotives and automobiles to radios and pencil sharpeners.\n\nIn this next excerpt, Seldes noted that Teague shared the thinking of other modernists of the time, namely that people could be herded into towers, even in rural landscapes. At any rate, Teague’s ultimate objective, according to Seldes, was to make everyday living more attractive to the masses.\n\n* * *\n\nArt Depreciation\n\nLewis Mumford did a bit of hate-viewing during a visit to the Whitney Museum, which hosted the Second Biennial of Contemporary American Painting. Mumford found a few works he genuinely liked, but had to admit he also enjoyed the ones he hated. Excerpts:\n\n* * *\n\nThe Swash Buckles\n\nFilm critic John Mosher checked out Douglas Fairbanks Sr’s latest movie, The Private Life of Don Juan, which would prove to be the old swashbuckler’s last hurrah.\n\n* * *\n\nToyland 1934\n\nThe New Yorker continued its seasonal tradition of offering exhaustive descriptions of various wares around the city, including the many new toys that would be available to children whose parents could afford them. An excerpt:\n\n“Patsy” dolls and doctor/nurse kits were also popular sellers in 1934…\n\nThe article was followed by detailed listings of department stores and select toys. Here are excerpts featuring two of the toy biggies: Macy’s and F.A.O. Schwarz:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe kick off the holiday season with Santa bringing cheer to the world, his bag laden with tobacco products from the jolly elves at R.J. Reynolds…\n\n…along with your cigarette you could enjoy a cup of this frothy eggnog spiked with a generous shot of Paul Jones…\n\n…and I pity the poor soul who was hoping for a toaster from Santa…perhaps the companion “Hospitality Tray” will add an extra dose of good cheer…\n\n…however some may have wished for a revolutionary Parker “vacumatic” pen…no more dipping into the old ink-well…\n\n…I include this ad simply for the terrific Abe Birnbaum caricature of Broadway producer Sam Harris…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, we begin with this merry spot by George Price…\n\n…William Crawford Galbraith gave us another person in the spirit of the season…\n\n…as did Daniel ‘Alain’ Brustlein…\n\n…a less cheery note comes to us from James Thurber, who gave us a patron unhappy with changes to his familiar watering hole…\n\n…and we have Alain again, and a spirited salesperson…\n\n…Barbara Shermund gave us a glimpse of the awkward courtship rituals of the male peacock…\n\n…and we close with Jack Markow, and the demands of Hollywood life…\n\nNext Time: Music in the Air…\n\nThe High Life\n\nAbove, Stewart's Cafeteria in Greenwich Village, May 1933. (New York Public Library)\n\nAlthough Sherwood Anderson is mostly known for his short story collections and novels, in the 1930s he also worked as a journalist, and for the June 9, 1934 issue of the New Yorker he explored the “centre of proletarian high life,” Stewart’s Cafeteria in Greenwich Village.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about Anderson’s page 77 article for the “A Reporter at Large” column is what it doesn’t report, namely, that Stewart’s Cafeteria (later the Life Cafeteria) was known as a popular gay and lesbian hangout in addition to being a place for gawkers, assorted bohemians, and bohemian wannabes.\n\nAnderson was a man of the world, so he knew exactly what Stewart’s was all about. But even the New Yorker wasn’t in the business of outing anyone, and editor Harold Ross, whose eccentricities included a puritanical strain, would not have allowed anything associated with “sexual deviance” to be printed in his magazine. Here is an excerpt from Anderson’s article, “Stewart’s, On the Square,” in which he subtly hints at the cafeteria’s “third life.”\n\nWhile Anderson tiptoed around the topic of homosexuality, gossip rags such as Stephen Clow’s Broadway Brevities put it front and center. Described as one of the most vicious show business gossip magazines ever published, Brevities also provided Clow with some side income: Clow and his collaborators often threatened to blackmail wealthy businesspeople and show business figures who frequented places like Stewart’s—outing them in his tabloid unless payment was made.\n\nNaturally such reporting helped attract gawkers to Stewart’s and its successor, Life Cafeteria. According to the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project, “Stewart’s closed in the mid-1930s and was subsequently reopened as the equally popular Life Cafeteria. Regulars included a young Tennessee Williams and Marlon Brando (though they didn’t meet each other until years later on a beach in Provincetown). Of the space, Brando later recalled, ‘The rednecks [on the street] were pointing at the diners like animals in a zoo. I was immediately intrigued and ventured in. Before I left that afternoon, I discovered that many of the homosexual men were actually putting on a show for the jam .'”\n\nAccording to the NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project:\n\n...in 1935 the manager of Stewart’s was convicted of operating a “public nuisance” and “disorderly house” and “openly outraging public decency” by allowing objectionable behavior in the interior and large crowds to gather outside. Specifically, the district attorney’s complaint cited “certain persons of the homosexual type and certain persons of the Lesbian type, to remain therein and engage in acts of sapphism and divers [sic] other lewd, obscene, indecent and disgusting acts” and that the cafeteria was “used as a rendezvous for perverts, degenerates, homosexuals and other evil-disposed persons.” Much of the testimony centered on the gender non-conforming dress and behavior of the patrons.\n\nHere is another excerpt from Anderson's article, where he delves into the nighttime scene at Stewart's:\n\n* * *\n\nNightlife, Part II\n\nIn my previous post E.B. White pondered the fate of the Central Park Casino, a favorite haunt of deposed Mayor Jimmy Walker and other members of the smart set who openly flouted Prohibition laws. In \"Tables for Two,\" Lois Long made this observation (below) at the conclusion of her nightlife column, believing that Parks Commissioner Robert Moses would give the management a chance to lower food prices and allow common folks to enjoy its sumptuous atmosphere. Little did she know that Moses was feasting on a diet of revenge rather than food, and had plans to tear the place down, regardless of its lower prices.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe kick off the ads with another Ponds celebrity endorsement from dancer and actress Francesca Braggiotti (1902-1998), who was married to actor, politician, and diplomat John Davis Lodge...\n\n...Dr. Seuss was back with more ads for Flit insecticide...he was still two years away from his first children's book: And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street...\n\n...and with a splash of color, Bermuda beckoned New Yorkers to a \"Real Vacation\"...\n\n...however, before you headed to Bermuda, you'd needed to do something with the kids...\n\n...on to our cartoonists, we start with spot art from Abe Birnbaum...\n\n...Birnbaum again with an illustration of boxer Max Baer for the profile section...\n\n...more spot art from James Thurber in the \"Goings On About Town\" section...\n\n...and Thurber again with some alarming news for a potential suitor...\n\n...Rea Irvin kicked off his series, \"Our Native Birds\"...\n\n...a famed advertising agency launched a new door-to-door survey, per Perry Barlow...\n\n...Helen Hokinson gave us a hopeful gardener...\n\n...Barbara Shermund looked in on the \"modern girl\" scene...\n\n...and Peter Arno examined a sad medical case...\n\n...and we close the June 9 issue with this item from E.B. White, who commented on a recent rally of American Nazis and some fighting Irish...\n\n...the Nazi rally was also alluded to in the June 2 issue (I have the issues reversed this time to support the narrative)...\n\n...where Howard Brubaker was keeping things light in his column \"Of All Things.\" I was surprised how little was mentioned in either issue about the meeting of 20,000 Nazi sympathizers on May 17, 1934, at Madison Square Garden.\n\nLet's explore further: According to the Jewish Virtual Library, America's first established anti-Nazi boycott group was the Jewish War Veterans (March 19, 1933), followed by the American League for the Defense of Jewish Rights (ALDJR), which was founded by the Yiddish journalist Abraham Coralnik in May 1933. By 1934 the ALDJR was led by Samuel Untermyer, who changed the organization's name to the \"Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League to Champion Human Rights.\" Nazi sympathizers targeted Untermyer as the face of boycott efforts, and at the May 17 rally the mere mention of his name prompted shouts of \"Hang him!\"\n\nThis excerpt from the May 18, 1934 edition of The New York Times gives some idea of what transpired at the rally:\n\n* * *\n\nDueling Muses\n\nFilm critic John Mosher always seemed upbeat about anything involving Disney, but given that animation was still in its infancy (its plastic trickery still rather novel), it didn't take much to outshine the otherwise drab fare (the \"Grim\") being coughed up by Tinseltown.\n\nThe grim included the Pre-Code drama, Upper World, about a rich, married man who falls to his ruin via a romance with a stripper (don't they always?), and Now I'll Tell, another Pre-Code drama, this one loosely based on the doings of racketeer and crime boss Arnold Rothstein.\n\n* * *\n\nMore From Our Advertisers\n\nWe cool off by a taking a dip in the pool...er, rather by enjoying the \"No Draft Ventilation\" of a car body by Fisher...the model might want to stay in the pool, since air-conditioning in cars was still a good twenty years away...\n\n...and yes, this is also a car-related ad, if you can believe it, the bride looking forward not to years of wedded bliss but rather her new La Salle (a Cadillac product)...\n\n...another bride, and a car...is that a car body by Fisher? Who cares, the wedding is over and its time to fire one up...\n\n...this woman seems to have it all thanks to Daggett & Ramsdell of Park Avenue, who are prepared to coat her in a \"complete range of all the essential creams, lotions, face powder...cold cream soap, dusting powder\" etc. etc....\n\n...Dr. Seuss again for Flit, with baby in tow...\n\n...on to our cartoons, we have Robert Day checking on the progress at Mt. Rushmore...\n\n...Alan Dunn reveals pandemic worries of a different nature...\n\n...and we close with Helen Hokinson, and a sudden change of mood...\n\nNext Time: Coney Summertime...\n\nThrough the Looking Glass\n\nAbove, from left: When Teddy Roosevelt announced in 1912 that he would run for president against his former VP, William Howard Taft, Brown Brothers sent photographer Charles Duprez to Oyster Bay to take this famous photo; President Taft and his wife, Helen “Nellie” Taft, in 1909; famed New York Giants pitcher Christy Mathewson warms up before a game, circa 1912. (liveauctioneers.com/cabinetcardgallery.com/psacard.com)\n\nBefore there were photo agencies like Magnum or archives such as Getty Images there was a company named Brown Brothers, the world’s first stock photo agency founded by Arthur and Charles Brown in New York City in 1904.\n\n“The Talk of the Town” looked in on Brown Brothers, “the largest collection of photographs in the world—more than a million,” including a famous image of Teddy Roosevelt and the first photographic portrait of a woman’s face.\n\nBrown Brothers photos could be seen everywhere in the early 20th century—their staff of twelve photographers provided images to New York newspapers at a time when the technology for publishing photos in the dailies was in its infancy and most papers didn’t employ staff photographers. Even the venerable New York Times hired the Browns to cover news events until they established their own team of photographers.\n\nNote: The Brown Brothers’ archive of photos and negatives went up for sale in 2014, and was ultimately acquired by Leland’s in 2020.\n\n* * *\n\nDe Terraplane!\n\nE.B. White (in “Notes and Comment”) was also looking at a photo, or rather scrutinizing one that was featured in a Saturday Evening Post advertisement for Hudson’s Terraplane:\n\n…here is the ad from the Post…\n\n…and a closer look at the image, which had White seeing double.\n\n* * *\n\nEscape Artist\n\nIn his “Of All Things” column, Howard Brubaker included the following item about a new telescope, ostensibly to set up a quip about John Dillinger’s recent prison break (his second):\n\n* * *\n\nPlaying Nice\n\nThe New Yorker commented on the trend toward fewer fights in the world of hockey, and although fighting in general ebbed a bit through mid-century, it nevertheless remained a staple of the game. Indeed the New York Rangers founder, Tex Rickard, who also promoted boxing at Madison Square Garden, knew quite well that hockey fights were one reason folks attended the games.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWe begin with this sumptuous ad from Packard, appealing to those who could afford to own this luxury brand…\n\n…if you couldn’t afford a Packard, you could rest assured that even a well-heeled deb could be happy with a Chevy…\n\n…the folks at Powers Reproduction continued to tout the wonders of their color photography, even if their cake looked less than appetizing…\n\n…Fanny Brice was appearing with the 1934 Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway, so the folks at Spud jumped on her celebrity bandwagon…\n\n…while R.J. Reynolds was suggesting we replace our chewed up pencils with a nice Camel cigarette…now, don’t you feel better?…\n\n…the Canadian distillery giant Gooderham & Worts offered all sorts of options to calm our jangled nerves in this two-page spread…\n\n…while the Germans continued to entice us onto their cruise ships perfected by science and featuring “the strapping sons of sailor families”…hmmm…\n\n…in 1934 the New Yorker began featuring mostly wordless cartoons on the opening page of “The Talk of the Town,” including this one by Robert Day featuring Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia checking up on city employees…\n\n…Richard Decker gave us an Irish Sweepstakes winner from Brooklyn who displayed some modesty and media savvy…\n\n…Decker again, with the latest in perambulators…\n\n…Otto Soglow’s Little King put his back into a ceremonial groundbreaking…\n\n…Peter Arno’s sugar daddy received some not-so-happy returns…\n\n…one of William Steig’s “Small Fry” was doing some serious reading…\n\n…and James Thurber’s war continued from the rooftops…\n\n…on to March 31, 1934…\n\n…where we find Alice Frankforter covering an exhibition dubbed “A Mile of Art.” I’m guessing critic Lewis Mumford passed on this opportunity to offer some blistering commentary. As for Frankforter, she found the spectacle puzzling, if not irritating. An excerpt:\n\nConstantin Alajalov offered his perspective on the art world stunt with this bit of spot art…\n\n…and more from Frankforter, now reaching a state of exhaustion and near-delirium as she approached the end of the exhibit:\n\n* * *\n\nBiblical Babbitts\n\nFrank Buchman’s First Century Christian Fellowship (aka the Oxford Group) meeting in New York featured a lot of people chuckling and bubbling, but all that forced conviviality left critic Edmund Wilson feeling “quite morose.” Writing for the “A Reporter at Large” column, Wilson looked in on the group as they awaited Buchman’s arrival at a preliminary rally. The column was subtitled, “Saving the Better Classes and Their Butlers.” An excerpt:\n\nLike other critics at the time, Wilson saw “Buchmanism” as bourgeois optimism and boosterism, interested more in converting the souls of the wealthy and celebrated rather than serving the needs of poor.\n\n* * *\n\nCarnegie’s Couture\n\nVogue magazine fashion editor Nancy Hardin and the New Yorker’s fashion editor Lois Long teamed up on a profile about Hattie Carnegie (1889 -1956) titled “Luxury, Inc.” Born Henrietta Kanengeiser in Vienna, Carnegie immigrated with her family to New York in 1900; nine years later she adopted the name “Carnegie” after Andrew Carnegie, the richest person in America. Through hard work and an inherent instinct for what American women desired, she built a fashion design business that thrived in Depression and catered to stars and celebrities including Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Fontaine, Lucille Ball, and Joan Crawford. An excerpt, with illustration by Hugo Gellert:\n\n* * *\n\nSteampunk Dream\n\nIn my previous entry I featured Robert Coates’s observations on the new Machine Art exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. For the March 31 issue critic Lewis Mumford, celebrant of the simple and unpretentious, waxed nostalgic over the novel exhibit:\n\nAlan Dunn was also inspired by the exhibit, as evidenced in this cartoon from the April 7 issue…\n\n* * *\n\nMore From Our Advertisers\n\nFounded in October 1933, the men’s magazine Esquire took off with a bang, and the publishers were not shy about boasting of its early success…\n\n…cover of the April 1934 issue, featuring the mustachioed mascot Esky…based on a drawing by cartoonist E. Simms Campbell, Esky was featured on the cover in various situations until 1961…\n\n…Peter Arno’s “Whoops Sisters” appeared sixty-three times in the New Yorker between 1926 and 1927 before Arno retired them (they occasionally popped up in other publications, and in a 1931 Cunard ad)…it seems odd that they would make an appearance in a cheap thermometer ad in 1934…at any rate, it is difficult to tell if this is by Arno or by a clever forger…\n\n…there’s no mistaking the cartoonist behind this ad…\n\n…and this one by Otto Soglow…\n\n…and we close our advertising section by raising a glass to Frankfort Distilleries…\n\n…on to our March 31 cartoons, and a lineup of New Yorker regulars Abe Birnbaum…\n\n…Barbara Shermund…\n\n…Mary Petty…\n\n…and James Thurber, with a break in the battle…\n\nNext Time: America’s Sweetheart…\n\nAs Thousands Cheer\n\nABOVE: Broadway's As Thousands Cheer (1933) featured evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson (Helen Broderick) trying to persuade Mahatma Gandhi (Clifton Webb) to end his hunger strike and join her act. (NYPL)\n\nBroadway gave Depression audiences a lift with As Thousands Cheer, a revue featuring satirical sketches that skewered the lives and affairs of the rich and famous and served as a precursor to sketch shows like Saturday Night Live.\n\nWith a book by Moss Hart and music and lyrics by Irving Berlin, the revue was a big hit, playing for nearly a year on Broadway in its initial run.\n\nWolcott Gibbs took his turn as Broadway reviewer, and pronounced As Thousands Cheer “the funniest thing in town.”\n\nNot everything was roses in As Thousands Cheer: In a poignant star turn, Ethel Waters sang—at Irving Berlin’s request—his famous tune “Supper Time,” a Black woman’s lament for her lynched husband. The revue was the first Broadway show to give an African-American star (Waters) equal billing with whites, however she was segregated from her co-stars and did not appear in any sketches with them. Her co-stars even refused to bow with her at the curtain call until Berlin intervened. According to the James Kaplan biography Irving Berlin, “The show had a successful tryout at Philadelphia’s Forrest Theatre in early September, although opening night was marred by an ugly incident all too in tune with the times: the stars Clifton Webb, Marilyn Miller, and Helen Broderick refused to take a bow with Ethel Waters. To his everlasting credit, Berlin told the three that of course he would respect their feelings—only in that case there needn’t be any bows at all.\n\n“They took their bows with Waters at the next show.”\n\n* * *\n\nA Final Byline\n\nE.B. White opened his column with a tribute to Ring Lardner, who died at age 48 of a heart attack and other complications. In the months before his death Lardner had contributed a number of comical “Over the Waves” radio reviews.\n\nLardner’s first contribution to The New Yorker came shortly after the magazine’s founding. “The Constant Jay” was published in the April 18, 1925 issue: Readers appreciated his subtle wit, including this oft-quoted gem:\n\n“The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong—but that’s the way to bet.”\n\nLardner also liked to poke fun at himself and his aw-shucks view of things. Here are the opening and closing paragraphs of his final New Yorker contribution, “Odd’s Bodkins:”\n\n* * *\n\nMacy Modernism\n\nAs Lewis Mumford observed in his “Skyline” column, Macy’s was the first department store to embrace a modern approach to interior design, but as Marilyn Friedman notes in her book, Making America Modern: Interior Design in the 1930s, Macy’s modernism was a bit toned down to blend into more traditional settings. A case in point was Macy’s 1933 Forward House exhibition, which Mumford described as “a brilliant piece of modern showmanship.”\n\n* * *\n\nFishing for Commies\n\nGeoffrey Hellman profiled New York House Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr (1888–1991), a staunch anti-communist perhaps best known for establishing the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. I feature this brief excerpt mainly for the great caricature by Abe Birnbaum.\n\n* * *\n\nAll Wet\n\nEleven years before Esther Williams made her first aqua-musical, Ruby Keeler took the dive under Busby Berkeley’s direction in Footlight Parade. E.B. White served as film critic for the Oct. 7 issue, and found Footlight to be a feast for the male gaze, as well as mindless entertainment.\n\n* * *\n\nA Dog’s Life\n\nDoubtless drained from writing The Waves, Virginia Woolf followed up with some historical fiction, namely Flush: A Biography, a book about Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s cocker spaniel. Clifton Fadiman had this to say about the unusual biography:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nWhen you market a car for only $445 you aren’t going after the luxury market, but hey, drop a ten-truck truck on this baby and you can live to tell about it…\n\n…with legal beer flooding the market brewers were particularly keen to attract female drinkers of all ages…and apparently social classes…\n\n…a couple of ads from the back pages, the first touting the smart-set writing of columnist and foreign correspondent Alice Hughes for the New York American, and the second an advertisement for Chase & Sanborn coffee, which relayed the story of a marriage on the brink due to stale coffee…\n\n…I include this ad for the heroic scale of the ocean liner, particularly as depicted by the people in the background…\n\n…we bounce on to our cartoons with Otto Soglow’s Little King…\n\n…James Thurber continued to explore the unrest among our domestic youth…\n\n…speaking of America’s youth, this gathering (courtesy Gardner Rea) appeared to have trouble finding some…\n\n…Helen Hokinson found fun with flounder…\n\n…Rea Irvin turned the tables on a life-drawing class…\n\n…and we close with Richard Decker, over the moon with a stranded chorine…\n\n…and in a nod to the approaching holiday, imagery from a 1933 Fleischer Studios animated short film, Betty Boop’s Hallowe’en Party…\n\nNext Time: The Wild West…\n\n​\n\nKeeping Their Cool\n\nThe heat came early to New York in June 1933, so folks flocked to air-conditioned cinemas or sought the cooling breezes of rooftop cafes and dance floors. And thanks to FDR, there was legal beer to be quaffed at various beer gardens popping up all over town.\n\nLois Long kept her cool on the beach or at home with a cold Planters’ Punch, but one gets restless, and Ethel Waters was at the Cotton Club, so Long headed out into the night; an excerpt from her column “Tables for Two”…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nLegal beer and hot summer days combined to bring some much-needed advertising revenue to The New Yorker…\n\n…here we have dear old dad telling the young ‘uns (all in formal wear, mind you) about the good old days before Prohibition took away his favorite tipple…\n\n…notable about the magazine’s first beer ads was the target market…this is akin to the cigarette manufacturers, who were also targeting women as a new growth market for their products…curious how this PBR ad is illustrated…is she getting ready to drink the beer, or serve it?…\n\n…also joining the party were the folks who made mixers like White Rock mineral water…note the reference at bottom right to the anticipated repeal of the 18th Amendment…\n\n…the purveyors of Hoffman’s ginger ale were less subtle, encouraging drinkers to mix those highballs right now…\n\n…you could enjoy that cool one while sitting in front of a Klenzair electric fan, which was probably nothing like riding a dolphin—a strange visual metaphor, but then again perhaps something else is being suggested here besides electric fans…\n\n…no doubt Lois Long took in one of these breezy performances on the rooftop of the Hotel Pennsylvania…\n\n…an evening with Rudy Vallée would have been a lot cheaper than one of these “compact” air conditioners, available to only the very wealthy…\n\n…but you didn’t need to be J.P. Morgan to own a Lektrolite lighter, which was kind of clever…this flameless lighter contained a platinum filament that would glow hot after being lowered into reactive chemicals in the lighter’s base…\n\n…another ad from the Architects’ Emergency Committee, which looked like something an architect would design…\n\n…our final June 24 ad told readers about the miracle of Sanforizing, which was basically a pre-shrinking technique, like pre-washed jeans…\n\n…we kick off our cartoons with George Price at the ball game…\n\n…Alan Dunn was in William Steig’s “Small Fry” territory with this precocious pair…\n\n…James Thurber brought us back to his delightfully strange world…\n\n…and Whitney Darrow Jr gave us a trio at a nudist colony dressing a man with their eyes…\n\n…we move along to July 1, 1933…\n\nWhere in this issue we find the Nazis not keeping their cool. In an article titled “Unter Dem Hakenkreuz” (“Under the Swastika”) American journalist and activist Mary Heaton Vorse commented on the changes taking place in Berlin, where the vice, decadence and other freedoms of the Weimar years had been swept away, including women’s rights…an excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nSome Strings Attached\n\nBack in the states, Alvin Johnston published the first installment of a two-part profile on John P. O’Brien (1873–1951) who served as mayor of New York from January to December 1933, the second of two short-term mayors to serve between the disgraced and deposed Jimmy Walker and the reformer Fiorello LaGuardia. Considered the last of the mayoral puppets of Tammany Hall, he was known for his brief, heartless, and clueless reign during one of the worst years of the Depression; while unemployment was at 25 percent, O’Brien was doling out relief funds to Tammany cronies. A brief excerpt (with Abe Birnbaum illustration):\n\n* * *\n\nThat Pepsodent Smile\n\nThe author James Norman Hall (1887–1951), known for the trilogy of novels that included Mutiny on the Bounty, offered these sobering thoughts about a famed actor he spotted on a South Pacific holiday:\n\n* * *\n\nMore From Our Advertisers\n\nMore cool ones for those hot summer days courtesy of Schaefer…\n\n…and Rheingold, here served by a sheepish-looking woman who doubtless wished that the tray supported champagne or cocktail glasses…and leave it to the Dutch to be one of the first countries to get their foot into the import market…when I was in college this was as good as it got, beer-wise…\n\n…Dr. Seuss again for Flit, and even though this is a cartoon, it demonstrates how in those days no one really cared if you sprayed pesticides near your breakfast, or pets, or kids…\n\n…here’s one of just four cartoons contributed to The New Yorker in the early 1930s by Walter Schmidt…\n\n…Otto Soglow’s Little King found an opportunity to stop and smell the flowers…\n\n…Mary Petty gave us two examples of fashion-conscious women…\n\n…James Thurber explored the nuances of parenting…\n\n…and we close with George Price, master of oddities…\n\nNext Time: The Night the Bed Fell…\n\nComrade Alex\n\nIf folks thought things were bad in Depression-era America, they could ponder the famine-ravaged masses in the Soviet Union…\n\n…not that Alexander Woollcott seemed to notice or care all that much. In the autumn of 1932 he traveled to Moscow to check out some Russian theater and enjoy the fine food and drink provided by his friend Walter Duranty, Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times. In his “Shouts and Murmurs” column…\n\n…Woollcott reflected on his Moscow visit, his humor at odds with the stark reality all around him…\n\nWoollcott wrote of “spindle-shanked kids” singing cheerless songs about tractor production, recounted a conversation with a hungry moppet at a boot factory, and noted the “appreciative grin” he received from a teenager who both envied and admired his girth:\n\n* * *\n\nHappier Thoughts\n\nThe Dec. 24 issue marked the beginning of a New Yorker tradition: Frank Sullivan’s annual holiday poem, “Greetings, Friends!” Writing for the Dec. 17, 2009 issue of The New Yorker (“Behind the Writing: “Greetings, Friends!”) Jenna Krajeski observes that “as far as holiday poems go, ‘Greetings, Friends!’…is as much an acknowledgment of the season as a noting of the times.” Frank Sullivan faithfully continued the tradition until 1974; after his death in 1976, New Yorker editor William Shawn asked Roger Angell to take over the writing of the poem. In 2012 Angell passed the duty along to Ian Frazier, the magazine’s current Yuletide bard.\n\n* * *\n\nWaxing Poetic, Part II\n\nIn the Dec. 17, 1932 issue humorist and poet Arthur Guiterman penned this petition to Acting Mayor Joseph McKee on behalf of the city’s statues…\n\n…to which Mayor McKee replied in the Dec. 24 issue:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nNew York’s fashion merchandisers continued to tout their latest copies of Paris styles such as this “Poppy Dress” from Lord & Taylor (illustration by Mildred “Melisse” Oppenheim)…\n\n…Radio City Music Hall and the RKO Roxy Theatre announced their grand openings…\n\n…Radio City featuring a cavalcade of stars along with the “Roxyettes” (soon to be renamed “Rockettes”) while the RKO Roxy presented the pre-Code romantic comedy The Animal Kingdom…\n\n…the folks at R.J. Reynolds challenged smokers to “leave” their product, if they cared to, knowing full well they were hooking new smokers by the thousands every day…\n\n…we ring in the New Year with some hijinks from James Thurber…\n\n…and this unlikely dispatch from a New York police officer via Peter Arno…\n\n…ringing in the year with Harry Brown’s Dec. 31 cover…\n\n…and Alexander Woollcott’s continuing account of his visit to Moscow, where he was shown the town by his friend Walter Duranty. In this excerpt, Woollcott makes a rare political observation regarding his friend: “Except for a few such men from Mars as Walter Duranty, all visitors might be roughly divided into two classes: those who come here hoping to see the Communist scheme succeed, and those who come here hoping to see it fail.”\n\nFor the record, Duranty has been widely criticized, especially since the 1950s, for his failure to report on the 1932-33 famine (which claimed as many as 7 million lives) and for covering up other atrocities of the Stalin regime. In the 1990s there were even calls to revoke Duranty’s 1932 Pulitzer Prize, which was awarded for his reporting on the Soviet Union.\n\n* * *\n\nRocky Theme\n\nAs Rockefeller Center prepared to open its doors to its first buildings (there would be fourteen in all) American playwright and screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood penned this hymn to the “Citadel of Static”…\n\n* * *\n\nOh Chute\n\nIn 1929 Geoffrey Hellman secured a position with The New Yorker as a writer for “The Talk of Town” and also contributed a number of profiles, including this one about a parachute stunt-jumper named Joe Crane. Here is the opening paragraph and an illustation by Abe Birnbaum:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nIllustrator Howard Chandler Christy (1872-1952) is best remembered for his patriotic poster designs of World War I, which might explain why this fellow looks a bit outdated…\n\n…Christy also originated the popular “Christy Girl,” the embodiment of the ideal American woman in the early 1900s (note the Christy Girl’s resemblance to the woman in the ad above)…\n\n…speaking of ideal, imagine a movie featuring this trinity of actors: John, Ethel and Lionel Barrymore…John Mosher will give us his review in Jan. 7 issue…\n\n…the Lyric Theatre saw its glory years during the 1920s when it hosted stage shows featuring such talents as The Marx Brothers, Fred and Adele Astaire and a young Cole Porter, who hit it big in 1929 with Fifty Million Frenchmen…the 1930s, however, saw the Lyric’s fortunes diminish and in another year it would be converted into a movie house…also note the influence of Italian Futurists in this ad for an Italian theater troupe…\n\n…and there’s also a futuristic bent to this Garrett Price cartoon, which steers more in a Kandinsky direction…\n\n…cartoonists were also finding inspiration in the magazine’s advertising, Pond’s cold cream providing the spark for Alain (aka Daniel Brustlein)…\n\n…for reference, a Pond’s ad from 1933 comparing Lady Diana Manners complexion to her former visage, circa 1924…\n\n…Lady Chatterley’s Lover, by D. H. Lawrence, was banned for obscenity in the United States in 1929, but Helen Hokinson’s enterprising librarian was still able to deliver the goods…\n\n…on the other hand, it is doubtful George Price’s sales clerk will also deliver…\n\n…a great one by James Thurber, with more detail than his usual spare line…\n\n…and we say goodbye to 1932 with Alain, and a New Year’s Eve party with some familiar faces…\n\nNext Time: Modernism Lite…\n\nThe Red House\n\nFrom the 1930s until the 1950s, New York City was the one place where American communists almost became a mass movement.\n\nWriting in The New York Times opinion section (Oct. 20, 2017), Maurice Isserman observed how in those days New York party members “could live in a milieu where co-workers, neighbors and the family dentist were fellow Communists; they bought life insurance policies from party-controlled fraternal organizations; they could even spend their evenings out in night clubs run by Communist sympathizers…” we skip to the Sept . 17 issue in which journalist Matthew Josephson penned a report on the movement for the “Reporter at Large” column titled “The Red House”…excerpts:\n\nAccording to Isserman (a professor of history at Hamilton College), in 1938 the Communist Party of America counted 38,000 members in New York State alone, most of them living in New York City. A Communist candidate for president of the board of aldermen received nearly 100,000 votes that same year, with party members playing a central role in promoting trade unions.\n\nJosephson commented on the candidates appearing on the Communist ticket in the 1932 U.S. presidential elections, finding James W. Ford to be “much more intellectual” than his running mate:\n\nJosephson concluded his article with observation of a party protest event, and one unmoved police officer…\n\nPostscript: The Cold War in the 1950s and a renewed Red Scare spelled the end of the party’s heyday, as did Nikita Khrushchev’s 1956 speech that denounced the murderous legacy of his predecessor, Josef Stalin.\n\n* * *\n\nTrès Chic\n\nFor those with means, the idea of living in the same building with other non-family humans seemed unseemly, but in 1870 Rutherford Stuyvesant hired Richard Morris Hunt to design a five-story apartment building for middle-class folks that had a decidedly Parisian flair. The Sept. 10 “Talk of the Town” explained:\n\nAccording to Ephemeral New York, the apartments were initially dubbed a “folly,” but the building’s 16 apartments and four artists’ studios—located near chic Union Square—were quickly snapped up, creating a demand for more apartments. The building remained fully occupied until it was demolished in 1958. According to another favorite blog—Daytonian in Manhattan—demolition of Morris Hunt’s soundly built, sound-proof building was a challenge.\n\n* * *\n\nSome Characters\n\nI include this brief snippet of the Sept. 10 “Profile” for the jolly illustration by Abe Birnbaum of Al Smith, Jimmy Hayes and the Prince of Wales…\n\n* * *\n\nDown In Front\n\nE.B. White was always on the lookout for the newfangled in the world of transportation, but this latest development by the Long Island Railroad was not a breath of fresh air…\n\nWhite also looked in on the latest news from the world of genetics—with hindsight we can read about these developments with a degree of alarm, since Hitler was months away from taking control of Germany…\n\n* * *\n\nShowing His Colors\n\nOn to lighter matters, critic John Mosher enjoyed an eight-minute animated Walt Disney short, Flowers and Trees—the first commercially released film made in full-color Technicolor…\n\n…Mosher also took in light entertainment of the live-action variety with Marion Davies and Billie Dove providing some amusement in Blonde of the Follies, although the picture could have used a bit more Jimmy Durante, billed as a co-star but making an all-too-brief appearance…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nLord & Taylor announced the return of Edwardian styles as the latest in fashion among the younger set, once again proving what goes around comes around, ad infinitum…\n\n…except when it comes to “college styles”…I don’t see this look returning to our campuses anytime soon…\n\n…the end of Prohibition was still a year away, but at least in New York it was all but over…I like the Hoffman ad and its winking line “with or without”…\n\n…as a courtesy to readers (and to fill a blank space) the New Yorker “presented” a full page of signature ads touting a variety of specialty schools and courses…the Carson Long Military Academy (right hand column) closed in 2018 after 182 years of “making men”…\n\n…on to our cartoonists and illustrators, we begin with this Isadore Klein illustration in the opening pages…\n\n…Rea Irvin gave us a nervous moment at the altar…\n\n…and Richard Decker showed us one groovy grandma…\n\n…on to the Sept. 17 issue (which we dipped into at the start)…and what a way to begin with this terrific cover by Peter Arno…\n\n…in his “Notes and Comments,” E.B. White offered some parting words for the departing (and scandal-ridden) Mayor Jimmy Walker…\n\n…and Howard Brubaker added his two cents regarding Walker and his replacement, Joseph McKee, who served as acting mayor until Dec. 31, 1932…\n\n* * *\n\nHeady Role\n\nThe British actor Claude Rains earned his acting chops on the London Stage before coming to Broadway, where in 1932 he appeared in The Man Who Reclaimed His Head — E.B. White was subbing for regular critic Robert Benchley, and concluded that Rains should have used his own head before agreeing to appear in such silly stuff…\n\n…and speaking of the silver screen, we turn to critic John Mosher and his review of the 1931 German film Mädchen in Uniform. It is interesting to see how Mosher (who was gay) carefully chose his words to describe this lesbian coming of age film…\n\nMädchen in Uniform was almost banned in the U.S., but Eleanor Roosevelt spoke highly of the film, resulting in a limited US release (albeit a heavily-cut version) in 1932–33.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nI’m featuring this detail from an Elizabeth Arden ad because the illustrator’s style is so distinct…if someone knows the identity of the artist, please let us know (on other drawings I’ve seen a signature that looks like “coco”)…\n\n…invented in 1918, this “cheese food” made from milk, water, whey, milk protein concentrate, milkfat, whey protein concentrate and sodium phosphates—among other things—was acquired by Kraft in 1927 and marketed in the 1930s as a nutritious health food…I have to say I haven’t seen any Velveeta ads in The New Yorker as of late…\n\n…”Pier 57, North River!” barks the successful-looking man to the admiring cabby who’s thinking “lucky dog!”…\n\n…on the other hand, Peter Arno (kicking off our Sept. 17 cartoons) gave us a Milquetoast who wasn’t getting anywhere near the French Line, or First Base…\n\n…and speaking of the mild-mannered, James Thurber offered up this fellow…\n\n…Helen Hokinson’s “girls” were perhaps wondering if their driver was among the Commies at Union Square…\n\n…John Held Jr. entertained with another “naughty” Victorian portrait…\n\n…Robert Day, and wish unfulfilled at the zoo…\n\n…and we close with Richard Decker, and trouble in the Yankee dugout…\n\nNext Time: A Picture’s Worth…\n\nOn Detention\n\nTwentieth century New York saw a lot of paradise paved (see Moses, Robert), but there is one spot in New York that saw paradise reclaimed—not from a parking lot but from an eleven-story prison that once stood at 10 Greenwich Avenue.\n\nThe Jefferson Market Garden in Greenwich Village was once the site of a women’s prison designed to be a more humane corrections facility, but between its opening in 1932 and its closing in 1971 the Women’s House of Detention went from noteworthy to notorious.\n\nIt was designed by a firm known for its Art Deco buildings—Sloan and Robertson—and although it still looked rather stark and institutional on the inside, attempts were made to gussy it up with artworks commissioned by the WPA. The New Yorker’s E.B. White found a certain “sanitary elegance” to the place.\n\nby the late 1960s the jail had become squalid, overcrowded and violent. He wrote: “I can still hear the desperate pleas of inmates shouting through the windows as I walked home from school every day.”\n\nIn the late 1960s Village residents began holding town hall meetings to discuss the removal of the overcrowded prison, many complaining of the friends and families of inmates who lingered outside day and night, yelling up to their loved ones behind bars. The protests were successful; the prison closed in 1971 and was demolished three years later.\n\n* * *\n\nHow Dry I Ain’t\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt was a canny politician, seemingly able at times to please both sides of a divisive issue. This was the case in 1932, when teetotaling New Yorkers touted FDR’s long record of supporting such causes as the Anti-Saloon League, while city dwellers such as E.B. White knew better…\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nIn the days before air conditioning, most folks had to rely upon whatever cooling breezes they could channel into their homes, and apparently in Tudor City they could find some relief from the East River, at least when the wind was blowing from that direction…\n\n…if the wind wasn’t in your favor, you could switch on an electric fan, an appliance that didn’t come into common use until the 1920s…this ad also demonstrated the power of the dictum “sex sells,” even if applied subtly…\n\n…it would be awhile before air-conditioning became common, but in 1932 you could at least keep your goodies cool with a GE refrigerator, its radiating coils offering a novel way to disperse this smoker’s emissions…\n\n…we jump to our cartoons, with Kemp Starrett in some mixed company…\n\n…Garrett Price illustrated the peril one faced when driving through Chelsea, where one could encounter freight trains at street level…\n\n…for almost one hundred years this street-level freight line on 11th Avenue—known as “Death Avenue”—claimed the lives and limbs of hundreds of (mostly poor) New Yorkers…\n\n…happily, we move on to June 25, 1932…\n\n…which featured a profile of Samuel Klein (1886-1942), founder of Union Square’s discount department store S. Klein, famous for its “bargain bins.” The profile included this column-busting caricature of Klein as rendered by Abe Birnbaum…\n\n…and we roll right into our advertisements, and this spot from the makers of B.V.D.s, who found a new market for men’s shorts and continued the 1920s trend toward a more casual, androgynous look among “modern debs”…\n\n…you likely wouldn’t catch Helena Rubinstein wearing B.V.D.s., busy here shaming women into using her line of beauty products…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we have this spot illustration by James Thurber…\n\n…and another travelogue image from Rea Irvin…\n\n…Douglas Ryan gave us an unlikely Shakespeare lover (unless the boxer was Gene Tunney)…\n\n…and we end with a bit of Prohibition humor from Gardner Rea…\n\nNext Time: Help Wanted\n\nThe Mouse That Roared\n\nIn the spring of 1928, Walt Disney collaborated with cartoonist Ub Iwerks in creating a new cartoon character, Mickey Mouse, and later that year Mickey would be featured in the first-ever post-produced sound cartoon, Steamboat Willie. The film was an immediate hit, bringing almost instant fame to Disney.\n\nJust three years after the birth of Mickey, Disney had already carved a place for himself in American culture, drawing the attention of millions of Mickey fans—and one critic for The New Yorker—Gilbert Seldes, who penned a profile of the “Mickey-Mouse Maker” (illustration by Hugo Gellert). Note in the second of these two excerpts how Disney was already connecting his product to patriotism and clean living through his Mickey Mouse Clubs:\n\nIn his conclusion, Seldes marveled at Disney’s productivity—a new picture made every two weeks—and his seemingly endless creativity. Little could Seldes imagine that one day the man and his mouse would become a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate.\n\nYou can watch 1931’s Traffic Troubles here:\n\n* * *\n\nBig Man on Canvas\n\nIt seems the earth almost shook when Mexican artist Diego Rivera arrived in New York for only the second one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. His work habits, his comings and goings, and his enormous girth (modest by today’s standards) were reported in The New Yorker, including this entry in “The Talk of the Town”…\n\n* * *\n\nWinds of War\n\nIt’s the end of 1931, but one can already detect the rumblings of the future to come, namely world war. The former Allied and Axis powers of the First World War were all busy developing new weapons, particularly of the airborne variety that all believed would provide a decisive edge if (or rather when) the next war commenced. Japan was already making moves on China, and in just four years the Germans would reoccupy the Saarland and Italy would invade Ethiopia. E.B. White, in his “Notes and Comment,” found the current state of affairs more than a bit troubling…\n\n…and hints of the world to come could also be found in Howard Brubaker’s “Of All Things” column, where he made this observation:\n\nBrubaker was likely referring to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s cautious approach to announcing his candidacy for president. The outcome, of course, proved quite different for the German people.\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nPreparations for war drove the development of the aircraft industry, which quickly adapted its designs during peacetime for civilian purposes. This ad from United Airlines touted the advantages of plane over train travel for corporate executives. Within 30 years the airlines would indeed supplant railroads as the preferred means for business travel…\n\n…Prohibition would remain in force until the end of 1933, so brewers like Anheuser-Busch continued finding ways to link their non-alcoholic products to the ghosts of drinking past…\n\n…on to our cartoons, James Thurber rendered this apt portrait of our civilization…\n\n…Barbara Shermund gave us an actress with a reputation to protect…\n\n…and Garrett Price presented an unlikely harmonica player…\n\n…on to our next issue, where we find more Diego Rivera…\n\n…and we begin with this entry from “The Talk of the Town,” attributed to James Thurber…\n\nThurber refers to “a lady” who accompanied Rivera, most likely Frida Kahlo, who was emerging as an artist in her own right around this time.\n\nMore on Diego could be found in the art review section, where critic Murdock Pemberton offered a cautionary message to the rabble who might not abide some of the artist’s controversial themes:\n\n* * *\n\nHead Cracker\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s Johnny Broderick was known as New York’s toughest cop, known for personally assaulting gangsters (and suspects) and for once facing down armed gunmen during a prison break at the Tombs. His valor won him many fans (and some detractors), making him a local celebrity and a subject of gossip columns. Reporter Joel Sayre offered his assessment of Broderick in a “Profile” for the Dec. 26 issue (illustration by Abe Birnbaum). Excerpts:\n\n* * *\n\nSomething to Cheer About\n\nOn the lighter side, Hollywood took a shot at Noel Coward’s 1930 comedy of manners, Private Lives. The original play featured Gertrude Lawrence and Laurence Olivier, while the Hollywood version Norma Shearer and Robert Montgomery. For once, critic John Mosher actually liked this screen adaptation:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nJust one ad from the Dec. 26 issue to close out the year, and what better way to say “Merry Christmas” than with a fresh cigarette…\n\n…on to our cartoonists, William Crawford Galbraith offered a look backstage in this two-page illustration across the bottom of “The Talk of the Town”…\n\n…Richard Decker showed us the importance of making oneself clear, especially when aloft in a dirigible…\n\n…Robert Day found humor in a barren landscape…\n\n…Garrett Price offered us a cheesy predicament…\n\n…Helen Hokinson found a man about to make an important point…\n\n…and we end 1931 with this classic from James Thurber…\n\nNext Time: Thurber’s Dogs…\n\nMarkey’s Road Trip\n\nWith the explosion of car ownership in the 1920s and 30s came improved highways across America, but if one were to undertake a long-distance journey, like The New Yorker’s Morris Markey, you were bound to find a wide range of conditions, from concrete highways to muddy dirt roads.\n\nMarkey wrote about his experience of driving from New York City to Atlanta for his “Reporter at Large” column, noting that stops at filling stations also offered opportunities to fill up on bootleg gin. Drunk driving, it seems, wasn’t a big concern in the early 1930s.\n\nUnfortunately, Markey shared the sensibilities of many of his fellow Americans 89 years ago, and made this observation about drivers below the Mason and Dixon Line:\n\n* * *\n\nPale Riders\n\nSince the mid-19th century Chelsea’s Tenth Avenue was known as “Death Avenue” due to the killing and maiming of hundreds who got in the way of freight trains that plowed through 10th and 11th Avenues in the service of warehouses and factories in the district. In the 1850s the freight line hired horsemen known as “West Side Cowboys” to warn wagons and pedestrians of oncoming trains, but even with this precaution nearly 450 people were killed by trains between 1852 and 1908, with almost 200 deaths occurring in the decade preceding 1908. Calls for an elevated railroad were finally answered with the opening of the High Line in 1934. “The Talk of the Town” looked in on the last of these urban cowboys:\n\n* * *\n\nGuys and Dolls\n\n“The Talk of the Town” had some fun with a little-known aspect of a notorious gangster’s life; namely, the doll-filled house belonging to Jack “Legs” Diamond:\n\n“Talk” also made joking reference to the number of times Diamond had been shot and survived to tell about it.\n\nDiamond’s luck would run out at the end of 1931 — Dec. 18, to be exact — when gunmen would break into his hotel room in Troy, NY, and put three bullets into his head.\n\n* * *\n\nZiggy’s Stardust\n\nFlorenz Ziegfeld (1867-1932) had a knack for show business, launching the careers of many entertainers through his Ziegfeld Follies, which got its start in 1907 during vaudeville’s heyday. The advent of sound movies signaled the end of the vaudeville era and of Ziegfeld himself, who would stage one final Follies before his death in 1932. Gilbert Seldes penned a two-part profile of Ziegfeld under the title “Glorifier” (caricature by the great Abe Birnbaum). An excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nIf Looks Could Kill\n\nThe New Yorker’s film critic John Mosher had a difficult time making sense of Murder by the Clock and its lead actress, Lilyan Tashman, who gave a tongue-in-cheek performance as the film’s femme fatale.\n\n* * *\n\nEine Kleine Nachtmusik\n\nOpen-air performances of classical music and opera were popular summertime diversions in the days before air-conditioning. In 1931 crowds gathered in Lewisohn Stadium to hear the New York Philharmonic perform under the direction of Willem van Hoogstraten, who conducted the Lewisohn summer concert series from 1922 to 1939. Here is a listing in The New Yorker’s “Goings On About Town” section:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nFlo Ziegfeld’s 1931 Follies were lavish productions, but his advertising in The New Yorker was anything but as evidenced in this tiny ad that appeared at the bottom of page 52…\n\n…no doubt anticipating the demise of Prohibition, the makers of Anheuser-Busch beverages ramped up the promotion of their non-alcoholic products to create associations with pre-Prohibition times…\n\n…not to be outdone by the East Coast chocolates giant Schrafft’s, Whitman’s took out this full page ad to suggest how you might enjoy their product…\n\n…which was in sharp contrast to the approach Schrafft’s took in this full-page ad featured in the April 25, 1931 New Yorker, which touted the health benefits of its candy…\n\n…on to our cartoons, Richard Decker took us swimming with a middle-aged man who was anything but bored…\n\n…Barbara Shermund went en plein air with a couple of her ditzy debs…\n\n…Garrett Price also went to the country to find a bit of humor…\n\n…Helen Hokinson found a home away from home for a couple looking to take the sea air…\n\n…James Thurber continued to explore his brewing war between the sexes…\n\n…Harry Haenigsen gave us a novel approach to landing a trophy fish…\n\n…William Steig illustrated the wonders of the tailoring profession…\n\n…and Alan Dunn aptly summed up the generation gap of the 1930s…\n\n…on to the Aug. 1, 1931 issue…\n\n…”The Talk of the Town” mused about the advertising jingles made famous by the makers of Sapolio soap…\n\n…Bret Harte actually did write jingles for the brand, once described by Time magazine as “probably the world’s best-advertised product” in its heyday. With a huge market share, Sapolio was so well known in the early 20th century that its owners decided they no longer needed to spend money on advertising. It was a poor decision, and by 1940 the product disappeared from the marketplace.\n\n* * *\n\nTough Love\n\nAs a charter member of the famed Algonquin Round Table, Heywood Broun was a friend to many of the founding writers and editors of The New Yorker. And so it must have been quite a task to review his play, Shoot the Works, which The New Yorker found wanting in a number of aspects. And because he was so close to Broun himself, Robert Benchley left the review writing to someone who signed the column “S. Finny.” I can’t find any record of an S. Finny at The New Yorker, and I don’t believe this is a Benchley pseudonym (he used “Guy Fawkes” in The New Yorker). At any rate, here is an excerpt:\n\n* * *\n\nFrom Our Advertisers\n\nThe makers of the “Flexo” ice cube tray continued to tout the wonders of their product with these Ripley-themed ads. This might appear rather mundane to modern eyes, but electric refrigerators with built-in freezers were still rather novel in 1931…\n\n…another way to stay cool in the summer of 1931 was to take an excursion to the Northern climes…\n\n…this ad for the New York American featured an illustration by Herbert Roese, whose early work strongly resembled that of Peter Arno’s…\n\n…on to our cartoons, we have the latest antics of the Little King courtesy Otto Soglow…\n\n…William Steig added levity to a heavy moment…\n\n…Barbara Shermund found humor at an antiques shop…\n\n...John Held Jr continued his revels into our “naughty” Victorian past…\n\n…and we end with Garrett Price, and a look at the ways of the modern family…\n\nNext Time: An American Classic…"
