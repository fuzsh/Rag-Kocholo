        "text": "Hell’s Kitchen church home to first Black Catholic parish in the north sells for $16M\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nThe first Black Catholic church to open above the Mason-Dixon line has been sold for $16 million, as first reported by Bisnow New York. Located at 342 West 53rd Street in Hell's Kitchen, the former St. Benedict the Moor church was constructed in 1869 as the only church for Black Roman Catholics. The property was sold by the Archdiocese of New York to developer Walter Wang's JMM Charitable Foundation, whose future plans for the site are unknown, according to W42ST.\n\nLearn more here\n\nHochul recommends five historic places in NYC to be added to state and national registers\n\nBy Aaron Ginsburg\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul last week announced 21 nominations for possible placement on the State and National Registers of Historic Places. The list of nominations includes a diverse set of locations that are intricate to the history of New York. Nominations include early automobile manufacturing sites in Buffalo and Syracuse, a Mohawk Valley cemetery home to the author of the Pledge of Allegiance, and the only remaining 19-century textile mile in Troy. Of the total nominated places, five are located in New York City, including an abandoned Bronx train station designed by Cass Gilbert and an area in Hell's Kitchen once home to a famed open-air market.\n\nSee more here\n\nGet a new look at Hudson River Park’s Pier 97 after $38M revamp\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nHudson River Park's northernmost pier is being transformed from a concrete strip to nearly two acres of green space with an esplanade and other amenities, Curbed NY reports. Renderings from design firm !melk, who is working with the Hudson River Park Trust on the revamp of Pier 97, located off 12th avenue and 57th Street in Hell's Kitchen, show a verdant respite from the city and din of the nearby West Side Highway. The vision for the new space at the gateway to Hudson River Park will consist of a series of connected spaces with walkways, sculptural canopies and a playground, with an elevated \"belvedere\" overlooking the river.\n\nMore renderings, this way\n\nA first look inside Álvaro Siza’s restrained yet powerful Hell’s Kitchen tower, his first U.S. building\n\nBy Alexandra Alexa\n\nWith the construction of Álvaro Siza’s Hell’s Kitchen tower well underway and sales expected to launch later this month, the project website and a new batch of renderings have been released, revealing new project details and a first peek at the interiors designed by Gabellini Sheppard Associates. The rising 37-story tower at 611 West 56th Street will be the Pritzker Prize-winning architect’s first high-rise in the United States and largest project to date. Unlike most other starchitect projects in NYC, it stands out for its restraint and simplicity, hallmarks of Siza’s approach to design.\n\nMore info\n\nNew renderings for Pritzker Prize winner Álvaro Siza’s first U.S. building in Hell’s Kitchen\n\nBy Devin Gannon\n\nNew renderings of Pritzker Prize-winning architect Álvaro Siza's first United States building were revealed this week, stirring up interest before the Hell's Kitchen tower launches sales this fall. Currently under construction just off 11th Avenue, 611 West 56th Street will reach 37 stories and contain 80 condo units, ranging from one- to three-bedrooms, and penthouses. In addition to the fresh images of the limestone tower, developers Sumaida + Khurana and LENY also released a teaser website for the project.\n\nSee it here\n\nRafael Viñoly reveals new renderings of ‘Auto Row’ office addition\n\nBy Dana Schulz\n\nHistorically, Auto Row, the stretch of eleventh in the 50s, has been somewhat a no-man's land to most, save for those rare New Yorkers who own a car. But with Hudson Yards pushing development westward, it's now coming out of the shadows. One of these projects is Rafael Viñoly Architects' addition to 787 Eleventh Avenue, an Art Deco industrial building that was originally home to the Packard Motor Company when it opened in 1927 to the designs of Albert Kahn. Viñoly's $100 million commission is adding two stories off office space to the top of the eight-story building, converting the other floors to commercial space, and retaining the current auto dealerships on the lower five levels. It's been more than two years since the first renderings were revealed, and now the firm has released an additional batch that show aerial views of the addition, more office views, and a closer look at the 12,000-square-foot roof deck.\n\nMore details and renderings ahead\n\nFormer IRT Powerhouse on West 59th Street, once the world’s largest, gets landmark status\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nThis morning, the Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the former IRT Powerhouse (now the Con Ed Powerhouse) at 12th Avenue and 59th Street an official New York City landmark. The Beaux-Arts style building, designed in 1904 by McKim, Mead & White, is considered a remarkable example of the style applied to a utilitarian building. It was bestowed with such grandeur to convince the public to embrace the subway, a newly-created transportation option at the time. The monumental building not only powered the city's the first subway line but upon completion 111 years ago it was the largest powerhouse in the world.\n\nFind out more\n\nREVEALED: Pritzker Prize winner Álvaro Siza’s first U.S. building in NYC’s Hell’s Kitchen\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nBack in 2015 architects and design buffs were excited to hear that Portuguese Pritzker Prize-winner Álvaro Siza would be designing his highly-anticipated first U.S. building on Manhattan's west side in a neighborhood being called Hudson West. Now, CityRealty reports that developers Sumaida + Khurana and LENY have released renderings of the building at 611 West 56th Street on the former site of the Gristedes corporate headquarters. The development team has secured an acquisition loan, and demolition and foundation work have begun on the 35-story, 80-unit condo.\n\nFind out more\n\nThis $425K Hell’s Kitchen studio may be small, but its renovation will not disappoint\n\nBy Emily Nonko\n\nHow much can you do with 410 square feet? Surprisingly, quite a bit. A renovation at this Hell's Kitchen studio, located within the 433 West 54th Street cooperative, has tried to maximize space in any way possible. Case in point: a Murphy bed \"cabinet\" with the option to tuck your bed away in style, a corner kitchen lined with wood that also holds storage underneath a compact breakfast bar, and a fire escape that makes for a suitable outdoor space. After last selling in 2010 for $340,000, the studio is asking $425,000.\n\nThis way for a look inside\n\nNYCxDesign 2017: The 6sqft guide to finding the best design events this month\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nNYCxDesign 2017, New York City’s official turn to celebrate all things design, hits town from May 3 – May 24. NYC is among the world’s design capitals and home to more designers than any other U.S. metro area. NYCxDesign spotlights the city’s diverse design community and its contributions to our economy and everyday life, and increases awareness of and appreciation for design with a collaborative mix of cultural, professional, educational and commercial offerings. This year’s celebration is the longest-running one to date. You can head in any direction and you'll stumble into a design-related event, but we've compiled a guide to a few of the top collaborative efforts and highlighted some of our picks.\n\nCheck out our NYCxD picks, this way\n\nGreat Game Changers: One Worldwide Plaza, A Classy Attraction for Sleazy 1980s Midtown\n\nWhat does it take to jump-start an unglamorous neighborhood? A huge development? A mixed-use project? New transit facilities? When this full-block, mixed-use development project was conceived in the mid-1980s the area in and around Times Square was one of the city’s worst. It was riddled with crime and pornography and was run-down, especially along Eighth Avenue. The proposition to add a building that was the scale of the full-block One Worldwide Plaza development, therefore, was not only surprising, but shocking and downright unthinkable. The legendary Madison Square Garden designed by Thomas W. Lamb had occupied its site from 1925 to 1966, but its second incarnation here was rather ramshackle especially in comparison to its previous glorious building on Madison Avenue at 26th Street. When it moved south next to the “new” Penn Station 16 blocks to the south, this site became the city’s largest parking lot and it took about a decade and a half for it to find a new life. The site was finally developed and completed in 1989 by a syndicate headed by William Zeckendorf Jr. that included Arthur Cohen and Worldwide Realty partners Frank Stanton and Victor Elmaleh.\n\nmore on the rise of worldwide plaza and how it revived midtown manhattan\n\nFormer Headquarters of the Christian Brothers Is Now a $15M Hell’s Kitchen Mansion\n\nBy Michelle Cohen\n\nSpanning 7,000 square feet, with a two-story master bedroom that cantilevers out eight feet over the back garden, a back wall of glass and smart-everything, this single-family modern masterpiece may be mere blocks from the trophy towers of Billionaire's Row, but it outshines any of those eight-figure abodes by a midtown mile. Built in 1910, this six-story, 7,000 square-foot building at 416 West 51st Street was the headquarters of the Christian Brothers, whose main role was to keep neighborhood youth out of trouble, from 1953 until 2011. In the middle days of the 20th century through its end decade, there was trouble aplenty in the rough district known for tenements and street gangs. The neighborhood has come an almost unfathomly long way in recent years, and \"the manse,\" as the listing calls it, is as good a parallel as we've seen. What's now being offered for $15 million is the result of the current owners' four year effort, in collaboration with Suk Design Group, to create a single family home fit more for a heavenly host than the Hell's Kitchen of history. Every inch of the building is wired for comfort and control, and there's a fully-stocked arcade and a \"glass-wrapped floating staircase winding around the elevator like a helix,\" four enormous bedroom suites and that dramatic duplexed master suite.\n\nTour this unbelievable vertical mansion"
