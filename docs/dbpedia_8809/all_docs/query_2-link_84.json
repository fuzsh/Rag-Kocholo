This document contains specifications for 109 Python problems for the course CCPS 109 Computer Science I. It provides general requirements for the problems, such as that solutions must be implemented in a single labs109.py file and use only concepts from the first five weeks of the course. It also contains a list of the 109 problems in increasing order of complexity, intended to help students learn and practice Python programming concepts. The problems draw from a variety of sources and aim to avoid both trivial and pointless problems.",
