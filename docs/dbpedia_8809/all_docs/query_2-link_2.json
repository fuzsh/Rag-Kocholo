        "text": "– Pointer to relevant discussion elsewhere.\n\nPlease see Wikipedia talk:Talk page guidelines#RfC: Should the guideline discourage interleaving? #2. The proposal could have significant impact on what is permissible under WP:TPO and WP:REFACTOR. — SMcCandlish ☺ ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼\n\nI came across a large (not sure how large) group of articles with the following characteristics:\n\nBiographies of persons who died more than 200 years ago\n\nPersons whose biographical references are likely not in English (the ones I found were Japanese)\n\nArticles with no references for eight or ten years or more\n\nMany were based on Japanese Wikipedia\n\nThese articles had propagated through the WP mirrors, making searches for original references a real slog\n\nMy belief is that a fan of samurai history figured out a way to quickly generate these articles into the English WP without any references. Because the references are likely to be in Japanese, an English language editor is unlikely to ever discover them. Having these article on the backlog will only slow down the task of cleaning it up.\n\nAs a general matter, articles for which the best references are not in English, and for which there are not English references and have not been for years, should be left to the editors of the natural language of the article. We should simply delete our musty articles. If they are later offered to English with references, we can take them. In the mean time, the current batch should go.\n\nTechnically, writing such a script should not be so difficult. Look for articles including {{unreferenced and {{Japanese name and whatever date parameter you want and you've got your selection tool. The tool can be generalized with the language of the name to help clear the backlog. Waddaya think? Rhadow (talk)\n\nHave you tried searching the contribution history of the creator, including the page creations? Legacypac (talk)\n\nOn quick inspection, all the ones Rhadow presently has PROD-tagged are different creators. However, the edit history of Akechi Mitsutada shows an edit summary of \"rm reference to Samurai Wiki\" - possibly some or many of these were originally referenced from Samurai Wiki, which is less than optimal. ♠PMC♠ (talk)\n\nOhh hell on closer inspection these are super hinky. Lots were created by Darin Fidika operating under a number of socks, including Cosmos Raver and Exiled Ambition, and others listed at his sock category. The master, Darin, was blocked in 2008 for serious issues including copy-pasting straight from Samurai Wiki. This ANI refers. There is also the page history at User:Nihonjoe/Samurai which describes the effort to clean all this trash up. Even if they're not copyvios now they're not great :| ♠PMC♠ (talk)\n\nCourtesy ping to Nihonjoe since a page in his userspace has been brought up. TonyBallioni (talk)\n\nAnything created by this editor (under any username) is suspect. Feel free to browse through all the contributions by any of them and nominate anything that appears dubious. Given his history, it's entirely likely he's still operating under some undiscovered username, too. He seemed very miffed at being blocked over and over. ···日本穣 · 投稿 · Talk to Nihonjoe · Join WP Japan!\n\nI don't think such a script should be created since it will most likely lead to mass-nominations with serious WP:BEFORE violations. If there really is a group of such articles that need equal handling, such exceptional cases can be discussed at a noticeboard and if consensus is to delete them all, an admin can do so. Or you can create a multi-AFD for a set of them (say 20), tag them with AWB or similar and see if there is actual consensus to handle them all at once; somehow, I doubt it.\n\nBut the core assumption that we should delete articles because sources in English do not exist is contrary to WP:NOTENG and WP:NEXIST. If sources exist in any language, then the article should be kept, because readers should not be deprived of information just because some people here cannot read Japanese. Regards SoWhy\n\nHello SoWhy -- I understand your line of argument. The result of it, though, is a free pass for any article about Flat earth or Pink elephants written prior to 2007, because someone believes there are existing references in Old church slavonic. Pink elephant articles will stay in the list of 280,000 unreferenced articles. It shifts the burden of proof from the reckless copy-n-paster to the hapless volunteer. As long as we celebrate the number of articles created by an editor, rather than the quality, the backlog of unreferenced articles and pointless lists will continue to grow. Rhadow (talk)\n\nI think you misunderstood. Deletion of articles because they are completely unverifiable is perfectly acceptable, see WP:DEL7. What you were proposing though is deletion of articles that are verifiable but just are not yet referenced. That is what I object to, because there is no deadline. Regards SoWhy\n\nOppose Such a script would be contrary to policy. Andrew D. (talk)\n\nComment a maintenance category could probably be used instead? —PaleoNeonate –\n\nApart from opposing much of the rest of what is proposed here, I would point out that the existence of Wikipedia mirrors doesn't in any way get in the way of finding sources. It is silly to expect sources for people who died over 200 years ago to be available on web sites anyway, so the fact that Wikipedia articles are mirrored there doesn't get in the way of sensible searches for books and academic papers. 86.17.222.157 (talk)\n\nAn editor has started a discussion on the notability guideline for academics. Interested editors may wish to participate in the discussion. Thanks. Ivanvector (Talk/Edits)\n\nper WP:IMGSIZE, the |image_size= should be deprecated fully from all infoboxes and replaced with |image_upright=. -- Pankaj Jain Capankajsmilyo\n\nOppose - IMGSIZE does not prohibit the use of pixel specification, it discourages it \"except with very good reason\". Unless someone can show that there is never a very good reason to use pixel specification in an infobox, we will continue to need support for the |image_size= parameter. ―Mandruss ☎\n\n@Mandruss: Don't ask people to prove a negative. Please provide examples of when it is neccessry to use pixel specifications.\n\nSupport in the absence of any evidence that this is neccessary or desirable.\n\nSupport. I was going to say pretty much what Andy said. I've been on this site for about 12 years, and have never even once seen a good case for specifying something like this in fixed pixel sizes. Doing it with images at all makes this site look terrible at notably lower or notably higher resolutions than the average office PC's monitor. — SMcCandlish ☺ ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼\n\nSupport - Fine. If two editors with far more experience than I have are willing to assume that this thread will receive enough attention to decide we will never have a legitimate need for this parameter, I can live with that. I'm all about simplification. But \"per WP:IMGSIZE\", alone, was an inadequate argument. ―Mandruss ☎\n\nYour support is solicited for the Project Grant that can be seen here.

Thank you for your consideration.\n\nBest Regards, Barbara (WVS) ✐ ✉\n\nWP:CANVASSING KMF (talk)\n\nApologies if this has been considered before... I can't find it after a quick trawl through the archives.\n\nI notice that with the WP:Requested moves process, once a requested move has been proposed, a bot automatically lists the request at the WP:RM page. Is there any technical or logical reason why the same shouldn't be done with the subpages made for AfD nominations? This would save the step of creating and adding an {{afd3}} template manually to the day's AfD listings, saving time, effort, and one stage in the afd'ing process. Grutness...wha?\n\nTwinkle already handles this. I don't see the need for a bot when we already have a de facto automated process. TonyBallioni (talk)\n\nThe place where Twinkle doesn't help is multi-page nominations, where each page must be tagged manualy (or using AWB). I keep running into this at CFD. עוד מישהו Od Mishehu\n\nThis discussion was spread across multiple pages, including some village pumps, but organically ended up at a dedicated page. However, we are now at (or beyond?) the stage where this again needs wide publicity and participation. Please see the long discussion at Wikipedia talk:Wikidata/2017 State of affairs#Strategies for improving the descriptions and especially the \"Proposal from WMF\" subsection (currently the bottom one), where a new magic word is proposed and specific implementations of it discussed.\n\nThis is a discussion which will potentially impact all articles and affect the first thing all users get to see in mobile view and on apps (and elsewhere), so getting enough input on this is important. I have posted it at WP:CENT and will also post notices at WP:AN and the bot owners noticeboard. Feel free to drop notes at other places.\n\nPlease keep the actual discussion in one place (if this should be here, then close the other discussion and send people here, but please don't discuss in two or more places at once). Fram (talk)\n\nIn the same fashion as when suffixes of browser titles were shortened from \"- Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\" to \"- Wikipedia\",\n\nI suggest removing the text \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\" that is displayed below the <h1> page titles. It's pretty obvious we are on Wikipedia, it just adds clutter. Note it is hidden by default in MediaWiki.\n\nRefs:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Monobook.css&diff=prev&oldid=4764942\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Vector.css&diff=prev&oldid=300913899\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Modern.css&diff=prev&oldid=187577589\n\nCologneblue skin shows it by default.\n\nOd1n (talk)\n\nOd1n, if Monobook, Vector, and Modern all hide it, it sounds obvious to remove it and reduce page size. However since it's hidden, could you post a screenshot of Cologneblue displaying it? I'd like to know what we're considering removing, before supporting removal. :D Alsee (talk)\n\nJust use query string useskin=cologneblue. Also I just noticed cologneblue doesn't remove it from the homepage, contrarily to the other skins. This reveals that skin isn't much supported by en.wikipedia in practice. Od1n (talk)\n\nI remember at one time that the sub-heading at the top of Wikipedia articles read \"Wikipedia - the free encyclopeadia that anyone can edit\". As Wikipedia has a high Google search, would it be a good idea to go back to putting this at the top of articles, to alert new users to Wikipedia to the fact that this is a wiki Website? Vorbee (talk)\n\nNotice this un-hiding was introduced in 2004. The context was different at that time. It would be like « Facebook, the social network you can register for free! ». Od1n (talk)\n\n@Vorbee : I disagree about your proposal of expanding the text even further. People just don't read this kind of stuff. Od1n (talk)\n\nA little technical clarification. It's actually called the tagline and the text is set by MediaWiki:Tagline. I have posted a notification of this discussion at MediaWiki talk:Tagline#Proposal to hide tagline. siteSub is just an id assigned to the tagline in some skins so it's easy to manipulate with CSS rules. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/load.php?modules=mediawiki.skinning.interface hides it by default with #siteSub{display:none}. For some reason Cologne Blue doesn't assign the id siteSub to the tagline. That's why it's displayed by default in Cologne Blue. MediaWiki:Vector.css, MediaWiki:Monobook.css and MediaWiki:Modern.css override the default hiding in those skins by saying #siteSub {display: block;}. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nThe MediaWiki default for MediaWiki:Tagline is From {{SITENAME}} where {{SITENAME}} is \"Wikipedia\" here. Wikipedia has many live mirrors. Some are listed at meta:Live mirrors (a lot of those are no longer active). It varies which parts they display and whether they satisfy the attribution requirement in our license. There may be live mirrors where the tagline is the only indication that the page is taken from Wikipedia, but often they just display everything including the copyrighted logo. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nSome parts of this message's history are very funny. Od1n (talk)\n\nSupport hiding it in the Cologne Blue skin, since it is in the others and we got rid of it by consensus; the fact this didn't happen in one rather disused skin is just an oversight. — SMcCandlish ☺ ☏ ¢ ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼\n\nThe original post may be a little ambiguous but the tagline is currently shown in all desktop skins at the English Wikipedia and as far as I know there has never been a consensus to hide it. The tagline is the text \"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\" below the big \"Example\" heading at Example. The statements \"it is hidden by default in MediaWiki\" and \"Cologneblue skin shows it by default\" both refer to a default MediaWiki installation with no local css like MediaWiki:Vector.css. You personally hide it in User:SMcCandlish/common.css with this line:\n\n#sitesub, .editpage-head-copywarn, .edithelp, .posteditwindowhelplinks { display: none; }\n\nYou can log out to see the tagline seen by others. As I mentioned earlier, Cologne Blue doesn't assign the id siteSub to the tagline. That's why your common.css doesn't hide it in Cologne Blue. PrimeHunter (talk)\n\nTo clarify:\n\nMediaWiki software hides the tagline by default on skins Vector, Monobook, Modern. Then, Wikipedia website un-hides them. I'm suggesting to undo this un-hiding.\n\nUnrelated stories:\n\nOn Cologneblue skin, MediaWiki software doesn't hide the tagline. Probably an overlook. Thus, Wikipedia doesn't un-hide the tagline on this skin.\n\nOn the Wikipedia homepage the <h1> and tagline are hidden, except on Cologneblue skin. Probably an overlook.\n\nOd1n (talk)\n\nUser:Isarra, are you maintaining this skin, or do you know who is? Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nCologne Blue is maintained by whoever feels like maintaining it at any given moment. If it's behaving in an inconsistent manner to the other skins, patches are always welcome. You may need to make sure to add one or more of the general skin maintainers (me, jack phoenix, matmarex, some others) to be sure it actually gets reviewed, though. -— Isarra ༆\n\nIt should be noted that the same area is used by several gadgets, incl the popular assessment gadget. When making it invisible, you will have to correct those gadgets as well. —TheDJ (talk • contribs)\n\nDiscussion\n\nFor examples of where this was an issue, see:\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Explore: The Journal of Science & Healing (2nd nomination) where the article was saved by finding and adding sources that described the pseudoscience this journal publishes.\n\nWikipedia:Articles for deletion/Is Genesis History?, which was closed \"keep\"/\"no consensus\". In my view this article is pure coatrack for creationism; there are no independent sources that describe how this \"documentary\" advocates pseudoscience from its first moment to its last, and the \"reception\" section is pure echo-chamber. Jytdog (talk)\n\nI don't see any need for a specific quack-related guideline/amendment anywhere. In the first case, it both clearly passes WP:GNG and WP:NJOURNALS#C1. In the second case, it's a clear pass of WP:GNG as well (and closed as keep, not keep/no consensus). There's no need to have specific criterion for determining the notability of quack topics, whether the topic concerns quacks themselves, the specific quack theories, quack publications, etc. Journals/Movies aren't considered notable if they lack \"independent reliable sources\". That covers both quack and non-quack journals/movies. Headbomb {t · c · p · b}\n\nThe second is a clear pass only in violation of PSCI. The purpose of this RfC is to change the guideline so that it is clear that WP articles cannot be COATRACKS.\n\nThe general N guideline addresses articles about pseudoscience directly at Wikipedia:Notability#Fringe_topics but nothing addresses media that is propaganda for FRINGE/PSCI, and that is a big hole. And if you read the whole close of the creationist fakeumentary, it ends with This leaves us, given the headcount, with a rough consensus for keeping the article (or at the worst, with no consensus for deleting.). Jytdog (talk)\n\nI don't see the coatrack. Reading Is Genesis History?, I find it a dispassionate treatment of the movie as a subject, and stays completely neutral on the subject of the movie. I'm surprised very little non-Christian sources analyze the movie, much in the same way you can find in Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed, but it could simply be no one bothered to look. Or maybe they don't exist because no one outside the Christian world cared. I don't see what either of these articles warrant additions to our notability policies. These articles are notable, both are clear passes of WP:GNG, and no amount of \"but it's quackery\" will make them non-notable.\n\nAs for \"but nothing addresses media that is propaganda for FRINGE/PSCI, and that is a big hole\" we have something that does cover that: WP:IS/WP:RS. Headbomb {t · c · p · b} Italic text\n\nI will not be replying to you further. Jytdog (talk)\n\nTypical Jytdog reply. Can't land arguments, ignore the person calling you on it. Headbomb {t · c · p · b}\n\nNope; you don't listen and misrepresent other people and I am not going to derail this dealing with malarky. You will surely write something snarkish in reply, and I will not reply to that. Sorry if you are all sweaty and Ready to Fight but I am not interested. Jytdog (talk)\n\nThe second has been stated as a clear pass of GNG, but I would challenge you to actually look for sources. Included in the list of sources keep !voters repeated are WorldNetDaily, Biologos Founadtion, Box Office Mojo, and other advocacy sites (which, regardless of their bias, do not contribute much to notability when posting about their focus subjects on their own websites). In fact, there was an extended discussion defending WorldNetDaily in that AfD. There are a couple other decent names mixed in, but upon further inspection they're simply press releases, screening announcements, brief mentions, and offer no in-depth coverage of the film (let alone sufficient coverage of PSCI/FRINGE, which were relevant issues, but the debate wound up resting on the question of whether PSCI was relevant, with most people uncritical of the claim that it passes NFILM/GNG. — Rhododendrites talk \\\\\n\nUser:Francis Schonken no, it does not mix two things. N is the guideline that implements the WP:NOT policy - it answers the question: Does this topic belong in Wikipedia or not? The basic answer if GNG, as we all know. The idea is that if there are insufficient sources with which we can create an article that is WP:NPOV, the topic is not suitable for Wikipedia. WP:PSCI is part of NPOV. All this does is apply WP:NFRINGE to media properties that are propaganda for pseudoscience or FRINGE topics. The hole that was exploited to create the creationist COATRACK article is clear as day and easy to close. If you really do oppose this, how do you propose we prevent COATRACK articles from existing? (real question) Jytdog (talk)\n\nNah, the proposal is badly written. There can be a significant amount of independent reliable sources that don't delve into the is-it-true-or-not aspects of a literary work (or film, or whatever) that advocates a pseudoscience. On the merits of these reliable sources which discuss the work (without much discussing its pseudoscientific content) it can pass GNG without passing this proposed guidance. So no, wouldn't work. Tries to solve an issue of keeping out coatrack content by forbidding the article.\n\nRe. \"how do you propose we prevent COATRACK articles from existing?\" – by keeping out the coatrack elements. Suppose a gifted author writes a beautiful love story, but interwoven with pseudoscience advocacy. Press praises the book for its literary qualities, but largely ignores the pseudoscientific content. If then, the Wikipedians who write the article on that book keep to what reliable secondary sources have written about the book, they avoid the coatrack and keep the article. --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nUser:Francis Schonken Thanks for replying but I don't see how it is possible to keep out RS that promote the pseudoscience. have a look at Is_Genesis_History?#Release_and_reception. What do we do about that? (and really I looked and looked and there is only one source (which is sub-WP:PARITY) that addresses the pseudoscience of this propaganda piece.) I feel you are being too ... glib here. (if you are watching and I shouldn't ping you pls let me know)\n\nIf you have ideas about how to improve the proposal, very open to that. Jytdog (talk)\n\nRe. \"RS that promote the pseudoscience\" – maybe listen to yourself: \"RS that promote the pseudoscience\" are either not truly RS (then take to WP:RSN to check) or not truly promoting pseudoscience (take to WP:FTN to check). If neither of that helps, take to WP:NPOVN to determine how to incorporate content, in a balanced manner, from a RS that leaves a door open to something that would generally be considered pseudoscience.\n\nRe my ideas \"about how to improve the proposal\": WP:SNOW (in fact: WP:TNT), this is not going anywhere while it mixes two things: notability (about the existence of articles) and COATRACK (about the content of an article, once its topic is deemed notable enough for existence). --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nI appreciate your time but we are far from SNOW, and you are not dealing with the difficulties of an article like the Genesis one or similar PSCI advocacy media. We will see what others say. Thanks again for your time. Jytdog (talk)\n\nI think Is_Genesis_History is a perfectly fine Wikipedia article about a notable film. It can't be construed as promotion of pseudoscience as long as there's a link right at the top to the article about Young Earth Creationism. The more unfriendly this place is to diverse content, the more editors will get fed up and leave. Then there will be nothing left but MainstreamPropagandaPedia. JerryRussell (talk)\n\nA more promising try (in the sense of likely to draw support) may be to add a qualifier rather than change the meaning of notability in this sense. By qualifier I mean something like an addendum to the notability criteria e.g. \"Note that it is possible for a film to be notable, but to fall short of compliance with other content policies like WP:NOT, WP:FRINGE, or WP:NPOV. In such cases, it is usually preferable to redirect or delete the article rather than retain an article that cannot be developed beyond a stub.\" — Rhododendrites talk \\\\\n\nStubs are better than redlinks. Headbomb {t · c · p · b}\n\nIt is not game-able, as every article about a work advocating a controversial subject should have discussion in the Reception section representing the mainstream - or at least multiple - views on the subject matter. this is problematic statement. Because we are such a wide variety of topics, this idea - while well-intended to prevent promotional regurgitation of fringe theories - would also potentially be applied to topics that do not regularly receive \"mainstream\" coverage but still are considered appropriate topics for WP here. I agree we have to be aware if all the sources for a topic in a fringe area are strictly all fringe-y, and they are all overly promotional (rather than being a more critical review), that's definitely a good sign that the item is not notable. But even within these fringe fields, there are \"reliable sources\" that are editorially control, and are reviewing these works from a critical eye rather than a proselytizing view, then that makes the works notable by our metrics. It doesn't matter it is fringe theory, as long as we write in a neutral tone and assign fringe claims to the appropriate attribution. --MASEM (t)\n\nI wonder whether films such as Reefer Madness would be classified as something that \"advocates a pseudoscience or other fringe perspective\". Presumably Dressed to Kill (book) would be in that category, too. WhatamIdoing (talk)\n\nI've withdrawn the RfC but am keeping discussion open to see if agreement on some refinement can be reached. Nobody has put out specific language and I look forward to seeing something like that. Jytdog (talk)\n\nThe movie-article[3] you cited appears to have turned out acceptably. However I have an idea. I haven't thought it through deeply yet. If an article on a topic such as a movie significantly discusses a subtopic such as creationism, and our article on that subtopic explicitly identifies it as fringe/pseudoscience, maybe we should explicitly endorse adding NPOV context for that subtopic. That would apply even if we have no sources about the movie addressing the fringe nature of the subtopic. We would basically just insert text briefly explaining subtopic is pseudoscience and wikilink to good articles addressing the issue. Alsee (talk)\n\nUser:Alsee thanks for that thoughts. There is a very fine line between complying with PSCI by doing what you say, and editors committing WP:SYN by doing the debunking themselves instead of citing sources that do the debunking. The WP:FRINGE guideline talks about this some. I try like crazy to avoid the SYN thing. Jytdog (talk)\n\nDefine \"COATRACK article\"?\n\nTaking a step back from the original discussion, maybe the issue should be analysed a bit more thoroughly before solutions are proposed (to avoid \"solution in search of a problem\" issues).\n\nMaybe a good vantage point would be to give a good definition of \"COATRACK article\". The obvious meaning would appear to be \"an article that is entirely (from start to finish) a WP:COATRACK\". Well, if that is the case I suppose the problem could (and should) be addressed by a WP:RM – reasoning: if the entire content of the article doesn't fit under its stated article title, then move to an article title that does cover the content of the article.\n\nBut that does not seem to be (not by far) the issue which the proposal above aims to address. So, would it be possible to give a workable definition of \"COATRACK article\", or, at least, what it stands for in the discussion here? --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nI just looked at the WP:COATRACK essay again. Its actual title is Wikipedia:Coatrack articles, and sort of defines the \"coatrack article\" concept in terms of article content, with a variety of advice on how to handle coatrack issues (move the coatracked content elsewhere, remove bias, etc., see Wikipedia:Coatrack articles#What to do about coatracks). Multiple ideas afaics on how to \"prevent COATRACK articles from existing\", i.e., by transforming them into non-coatrack articles. Again, probably not what we're looking for here (unless, for instance, upgrading the essay to guideline status is what is being sought here – is it?). Maybe the \"What to do about coatracks\" section can be finetuned, with specific advice on how the type of coatracks that are experienced problematic in the current discussion should be handled. Still, an accurate definition of the kind of coatrack articles we're trying to prevent now (as opposed to the types of coatrack articles already covered by the guidance in the essay) would seem a first step. --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nUser:Francis Schonken thanks for giving some thought to this. In the Is Genesis History article, the \"hook\" was the movieness (made by X, cast of Y, premiere on Z, box office of A) but the \"coat\" was the POV celebration of the creationist pseudoscience. I had to reach deep down in the gutter of blogginess to make the reception remotely compliant with PSCI - there are actually no mainstream sources that discuss this movie for what it is - pure pseudoscience. And if I hadn't been able to find that shitty blog that described the movie for what it is, it would still be a celebration of pseudoscience, right here in WP because of a lack of mainstream sources. We delete articles generally where there are insufficient sources to create an NPOV article. The AfD should have been a resounding \"delete\", but people concentrated on the hook (it's a movie) and ignored the coat. What can happen with this piece of progaganda can happen with any kind of propaganda - Nazi shit, racist shit, MRA shit, whatever shit. Hence the suggested change to the guidelines. There really is a problem with N guidelines that people can cite to allow POV Jytdog (talk)\n\nI can relate to the \"lack of mainstream sources\" issue, but not in a sense of always being confined to \"PSCI\" issues. Let me give you an example: In its glory-days we had this separate section on a publication not mentioned in \"mainstream sources\", which I recently cut down and reformed to the shorter last paragraph of this section. When doing that I wasn't thinking so much about any guidance, just trying to put things in the perspective apparent from available sources (sort of a WP:BALASPS reasoning in the background of my mind I suppose); framing it as a \"pseudoscience\" topic, would maybe be a bit of a stretch (it could maybe be described as some sort of religiously inspired pseudo-history, and pseudo-history could then possibly be framed as pseudo-science, but framing it thus would probably be too much of a convoluted analysis as compared to any manageable solution that might result from such analysis).\n\nSome topics which have a separate Wikipedia article, such as the article in question, Pontius Pilate's wife, as well as for instance Adagio in G minor, centre almost exclusively around the \"reception history\" aspect – so, as such, I can't see reception history as a coatrack: some \"trivia\" growth may need to pruned every once and a while (sometimes drastically, e.g. here), but that's hardly the kind of coatrack we're talking about here I suppose. I mean, \"trivia\" could mostly be framed as some sort of coatracking, but again pruning of trivia is easier to do without taking the longer and more convoluted road of framing it as coatracking before just weeding it out. In sum: reception history can be a fickle thing for some topics, but hardly ever, imho, does it need to be framed as coatracking, and even less should reception history be deemed innately 'suspect' (from a PSCI angle or whatever).\n\nThe specific problem for the Is Genesis History? article rather seems, imho, its \"recent history\" aspect. To a certain degree that was a problem playing in the BWV 565#Reception section, so I can relate to that somewhat (although I mostly stay out of recent history articles because of that kind of difficulties, respecting editors who take such challenges all the more). In a first step I'd say that for such topics the \"reception history\" aspect rather needs to be framed as falling under the WP:BALASPS policy, without worrying too much about the PSCI aspect. (NPOV trumps PSCI in the domain of reception history if you want it in a short formula). Sure, creationists had their field day with the Is Genesis History? film. Maybe a Wikipedia editor should be able to say to themself: let them have their field day, I don't care, I don't \"write\" history, I record it. Is Is Genesis History? a pseudo-documentary? Probably, but until a reliable source says so, we can't put it in Wikipedia. Wait a few years until someone writes a history book about the surge of creationism in the early 21st century, and uses the film as an example. Until if and when that happens, make do with the reception history sources as available, pretty much what has been done up till now in the article. I'd maybe have the \"mix of history and philosophy\" comment (which I found truly insightful) somewhat higher in the article, maybe even in the lead, but if that commentary can only be found in a blog, it would probably need to stay where it is now (or even be removed when it can be replaced by the commentary from a more reliable source).\n\nAnyhow, as far as the rewriting of guidance goes, I don't see a need for it (yet) – we'd also need more than one or two examples that indicate a \"trend\": tailoring guidance to problems that occur only in one or two articles hardly ever finds consensus. Don't let that stop you from formulating analyses or proposals that might make it clearer why and how such updating of policies and guidelines would be indicated. --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nOK thanks for your thoughts. I am stewing on them and appreciate the time you took to write them. Jytdog (talk)\n\nJytdog, you appear to be saying that \"Is Genesis History\" shouldn't have an article unless somewhere in it we say creationism is pseudo-science (using those very words). The thing that persuaded me to vote 'keep' there was at least one review written by scientists who were christians. They chose one example used in the film (formation of Grand Canyon) and pointed out how implausible and inconsistent all the claims made in the film about the GC were, they then went on to argue that creationism is NOT the orthodox historical christian belief and is not, and never has been, necessary to being a christian. They argued that the film presents a false dichotomy between science and religion (as IMO do many notable atheists). This may not use the specific words 'pseudo-science', but they are clearly of the opinion that the film's science as well as its theology are plain wrong. To me personally, this review was a great deal stronger because it DID come from a christian source.\n\nYour general point however \"what can happen with this piece of progaganda can happen with any kind\" is true. I first became involved with WP because of a film which adopted a very particular, very contentious, viewpoint on the Yugoslav wars. The film was so fringe that it had never been reviewed anywhere, and certainly not outside its ethnic/political base. It took 20 months on and off, several ANI's and a few SPI's before the article ceased to be a mirror of the filmmaker's website, by which time it had 'done its job', ie given a veneer of respectability to a dangerous piece of propaganda. As so often on WP, failure to implement existing policy, rather than lack of policy is the problem. Pincrete (talk)\n\nFrame as issues regarding reception content of recent history topics?\n\nIf we can leave the \"COATRACK articles\" approach aside, which imho seems somewhat at a dead end anyhow (see my last comment in the previous section), we could maybe define the problematic area as \"recent history\" topics often lacking reliable (secondary) sources to cover reception-related content. Then we could tie this with an elaborate field, covering many articles, which has come under heightened scrutiny of Wikipedia editors recently, e.g. Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not#Proposal for new section under \"Not a Newspaper: Not real-time news reaction, commentary, and analysis. Not that anything practical has come out of these deliberations yet, but at least we're no longer talking about \"one or two articles\". But also no longer in a \"seek ways to nuke the entire article\" dynamic (which I consider another route at a dead end here). --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nFYI Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not#RFC: New subsection under \"Not a Newspaper\" about commentary got closed this morning, as a \"no consensus\", the closer's report being an interesting read though (including in view of what is being discussed here). --Francis Schonken (talk)\n\nWe are supposed to be ad-free, even though St. James himself proposed adverts, overruled thanks to the Spanish Fork.\n\nBut now we get incessant advertising for internal odds & ends of our own(e.g. monuments) - not unlike the BBC, which carries endless adverts, though only for its own stuff.\n\nCould someone stop this nuisance, or at least have a poll to see if it is wanted— Preceding unsigned comment added by JohnWheater (talk • contribs)\n\nYou can switch it off by clicking on the cross--Ymblanter (talk)\n\nIt comes back every now and then. --Treetear (talk)\n\nI don't think that I've seen these yet. —PaleoNeonate –\n\n– Pointer to relevant discussion elsewhere.\n\nPlease see: WP:Bots/Noticeboard#InternetArchiveBot notices about nothing but archive-url additions\n\nSummary: Proposal to have InternetArchiveBot stop posting one specific kind of notice on article talk pages – namely that it's just added an archive-url to a citation template.

TonyBallioni (talk)\n\nFrom a readers perspective it would be awesome if there would be a feature where I can put different articles on a \"to-read\" list, and also have a \"read\" list of all the articles I already read on wikipedia.

If one goes down far enough on this page displaying one's edit count, one will see a pie chart listing percentages of the different contributions one has made. I am sure that there used to be a section of this pie chart called \"Article\", but I now think it is called \"Main\". My proposal is that we go back to calling this section of the pie chart \"Article\" - calling it \"Main\" may confuse some Wikipedians into thinking it is to do with Wikipedia: Main Page. Vorbee (talk)\n\nHi @Vorbee:, that chart is from an external link to the xtools utility. You can use this link to request changes to xtools. — xaosflux Talk\n\nMore than once I've enquired (not here) about whether it would be feasible to create an automated list of redlinks, which would appear much the same as Special:AllPages, except all the entries would be red.\n\nOne could peruse the list, and finding that there are, say 20 redlinks for Pope Donald III throughout WP, and having established that they are not vandalism or typos, one could set about either creating an article for said Pope Donald III (assuming notability can be established), or delinking the redlinks - in either case eliminating 20 redlinks. This would serve a very useful purpose.\n\nThe first time I raised this idea, some years ago, it was knocked on the head immediately as being beyond the capacity of the system at that time. Have things marched on, technologically speaking? Is this now a goer? It seems a glaring omission from the wiki-way of doing things. -- Jack of Oz [pleasantries]\n\nJack of Oz you could try Special:WantedPages, however that list is not restricted to mainspace, and redlinks-in-templates get counted for every instance of the template.

There are numerous issues I would like to discuss, and, not to start those discussions here, but just to give a sense of some of the scope, here are some:\n\nIs there a way to run an individual page through all lint tests, or just one lint test? If not, how soon can this tool be constructed?\n\nEach page's \"Page Information\" link provides a page that tells how many errors of each type of lint error the page has. This should be enhanced to provide some further information such as what is displayed on each of the Lint errors page, e.g. edit link, some error text, and \"Through a template?\"\n\nSome of these Lint errors would be relatively easy to fix with bots, especially Multi colon escape. Are there plans to create such bots?\n\nWhy, when a new type of Lint Error is added, do the numbers continue to grow for an extended period? Is it that it takes a long time for the linter to process every Wikipedia page, or that the definition of the error expands, or other factors?\n\nFor each type of Lint error, should Wikipedia editors attempt to correct these errors at all, or just wait for a bot to fix at least some of them?\n\nAre there pages that should not be fixed, for example, sandboxes, user talk pages, Wikipedia talk archives? If there were an official reference on this, then editors would not worry about others objecting, and they would also be able to say to anyone who objects\n\nSee: Wikipedia:Lint error policies\n\nWhich pages should the user be reasonably certain of fixing correctly on the first try? For example, if it is OK to edit User pages, it might be good etiquette to get each fix right the first time (if necessary, by experimenting in the editor's own sandbox).\n\nAre there plans to improve the ordering of errors? If page information reports that there are \"Misnested tag with different rendering in HTML5 and HTML4\", it can be a major search effort to find the indication on Special:LintErrors/html5-misnesting, in order to fix the errors.\n\nThe Wikipedia edit page, upon \"Show preview\" and \"Save changes\", should warn Wikipedia editors of any newly-added lint errors. Arguably, new High Priority errors should prevent a page from being saved.\n\nCan we make the help link more prominent on each Lint error page?\n\nCan we enhance the help pages to discuss other errors, such as unclosed tags or unclosed tables, that are known to frequently trigger the topical lint error?\n\nCan we improve the diagnostic to better localize the error?\n\nAgain, I don't want to have these discussions here. I just want a unified place to have these and other discussions. —Anomalocaris (talk)\n\nSounds useful, feel free to start up Wikipedia:Lint errors and an associated talk page or the like. We can link to it from MediaWiki:Linterrors-summary that displays at Special:LintErrors. — xaosflux Talk\n\nAlternatively, we can have the discussion first (probably better at WP:VPPOL or WP:VPT) and then start a page with a working set of rules. --Izno (talk)\n\nPut it at VPT not not VPPOL if you have the discussion. I'm sure there are many of us who have no earthly idea what a lint error is. I'm currently imagining Wikipedia being full of exploding cloths dryers ;-) TonyBallioni (talk)\n\nThat's... not far off in actuality. --Izno (talk)\n\nIf there are questions related to bad / incomplete documentation, would you be able to add it to mw:Help_talk:Extension:Linter?

PS: Thanks for the exploding clothes dryers humour. :-) SSastry (WMF) (talk)\n\nUser:Anomalocaris didn't want the discussion here, so will wait on responding to some of these things, but mw:Help:Extension:Linter#Tools might be useful. SSastry (WMF) (talk)\n\nWe just deployed a couple of fixes that reduce the false positives categorized in the html5-misnesting linter category. Most of those errors will now go back to being missing-end-tag errors or misnested-tag errors. SSastry (WMF) (talk)\n\nJust a note, but my bot ( ) was handling some misnested errors.

SSastry (WMF) (talk)\n\nI have just read some of the content on 'Dispute Resolution'. I read about the three revert rule in context of 'edit-warring', and that you should attempt to resolve your disputes when your changes are reverted.\n\nWhile I agree on the aim to achieve a peaceful consensus, I do think that the currently accepted standards of behavior regarding 'Reverts', favor the editors 'watching' the article and do not put two editors(one that has made the change and the one that has reverted those) at equal footing.\n\nWhile an editor makes any change and in doing that deletes or modifies existing content instead of just adding some, he/she is not specifically targeting a particular editor. But in case of 'Reverts', exactly that is happening ie one undoes changes done by a particular editor.\n\nWhile doing a 'Revert' it is 'assumed' that the 'changes' are disruptive and unconstructive, without even trying to make a contact or asking the editor for the reasons for the change. It is entirely plausible that the changes are in fact constructive and that the article was in a vandalised state beforehand.\n\nSo, I do think that 'Reverts' are more offensive and aggressive as compared to some ad-hoc changes made to an article, and hence have a much greater potential of igniting a chain reaction of aggressive and warring behavior.\n\nIf talking/conversation is the behavior being promoted or encouraged by Wikipedia, then it should be promoted/encouraged right from the start. So, before making a 'Revert', one should try to talk to the editor and try to achieve consensus. One cannot expect the editor making the first change, to do this, as it would be very difficult to go and find out in the 'History' exactly who are the editors, the content of which he/she is trying to modify/delete, and to find out about all the editors 'watching' an article and then try to talk to each of them and achieve consensus.\n\nI think that 'Reverts' should be entirely discouraged, and should only be allowed in exceptional cases where the vandalistic or disruptive nature of the 'change' is very obvious. If Revert is done, then one should always specify an 'as objective as possible' reason for the 'Revert'.\n\nOne more reason for above policy change is the difference between the knowledge of editors 'watching' an article and the editors making first change. You see, editors who 'watch' an article, in most probability, are somewhat familiar with Wikipedia and probably would know about such thing as 'Dispute Resolution'. Given that they know about the expected procedures/actions to be taken in the case of 'Disputes', they are less likely to take 'Disputes' as threatening or feel helpless/powerless when it happens. On the contrary, the editor who is making the first change, could be someone entirely new to Wikipedia and knows nothing about 'Dispute Resolution'. When someone 'reverts' his/her changes, he/she is more likely to engage in aggressive behavior and feel threatened or enraged at the perceived injustice of 'Revert' done to his/her changes.\n\nEditors who 'watch' an article should not be automatically assumed better/more neutral than others, and should not be given undue benefit of doubt.\n\nWhen I do make a change to an article and someone 'reverts' it, and then when I read the message in my notifications, this is what I(and probably many others) think:-\n\nWhy my change has been reverted? Why is it 'assumed' to be disruptive? Who decides whether it is 'disruptive' or 'constructive', given that supposedly everyone can edit Wikipedia?\n\nWho the hell he/she(the editor who has made the revert) thinks he/she is? Is he/she some kind of authority? What does he/she thinks of him/herself that he/she can decide about whether a 'change' is disruptive or constructive?\n\nWhy am I the one, who is expected to go through all this shit(talk pages and stuff) and try to gain approval? Why doesn't he/she has done or tried that already? Am I inferior to him/her? No I am not, and I will fight for this!\n\nYou can see where it's going. Add to this, the message: \"Continual disruptive editing may result in loss of editing privileges\", only seems more threatening and a sign of partiality/discrimination in built in the 'System'. Because you see, as per my thought process, why is it that my editing is assumed to be disruptive and that the 'Reverts' made by the other editor are assumed to be 'constructive'? — Preceding unsigned comment added by Manubhatt3 (talk • contribs)\n\nI think your suggestion is completely non-viable and based on a misunderstanding. Reverting is an integral part of the editing process, not a form of \"targeting\", unless it is in the form of dealing with a problem editor or wikistalking. A revert simply means you are going to have to obtain a consensus for the change. If both editors break 3RR they are both likely to be blocked, unless the revert is exempt from sanctions (i.e. reverting clear vandalism, reverting a blocked editor etc). If both editors become embroiled in a cycle of reverting each other without a technical 3RR violation they may also be blocked, depending on the level of engagement on the talk page and the level of support from impartial editors. A decent admin should only base their decision to block on the level of disruption and the efforts undertaken to resolve the dispute; for example, if the editor attempting to implement a change provides a very detailed rationale on the talk page and an article \"watcher\" constantly reverts without leaving so much as an edit summary, I would expect only the non-communicating editor to be blocked even if the number of reverts for both parties are similar. Ultimately though we all face this: the burden of obtaining consensus is on those seeking to effect change. It's not a perfect system, and it is sometimes abused, but it is an essential part of quality control. Betty Logan (talk)\n\nAnother important reason is that a high proportion of reverts are to deal with vandalism or other totally non-constructive editing. It would be ridiculous to have to obtain consensus before undoing such edits. Peter coxhead (talk)\n\nWhat they said. Correct me if I'm wrong, Betty Logan, but I think you're referring to the first revert, a la WP:BRD. We can and do debate what constitutes the first revert, but we shouldn't be discussing turning BRD on its head. ―Mandruss ☎\n\nBetty Logan I can understand your argument, but you must understand that I am talking from the point of view of people/editors who are not much familiar with such concepts and processes. AFTER reading your comment, I can NOW understand that a 'Revert' is a signal to obtain consensus, but that is probably not the message sent across to someone who is relatively somewhat new to this and making changes. If you read my full post, that is what I am trying to say there. Peter coxhead I am not against 'Reverts' done to obvious cases of vandalism and disruptive editing(read my full post), but what I am saying is that the editor making the change should be given benefit of doubt.— Preceding unsigned comment added by Manubhatt3 (talk • contribs)\n\nThat is why we also have an Undo button with the ability to add your own customized edit summary explaining your action so as to not WP:BITE newcomers. Certain scripts such as WP:TWINKLE also have an option to do a \"Good faith revert\" to soften the blow even more. Of course, not everyone takes advantage of these features. -- œ™\n\nIs there any way that the \"Differences between revisions\" page can make the revision more obvious? Sometimes I look but I can't see anything. See, for example, this delta – I don't see anything highlighted.

M was changed to Graves, Genevieve J. M. -- John of Reading (talk)\n\nSome time ago, the whole diff'd paragraph had a color background. I think that the diff'd character background should have a color background, not just the characters themselves. --NaBUru38 (talk)\n\nSometimes the revisions are only minor revisions and this would be evident if the revision is marked with an m. Vorbee (talk)\n\nOccasionally, Wikipedians tend to put things on our watchlist that we only intend to watch for a limited amount of time, such as a particular move request, deletion discussion, user talk pages of editors to whom we have made a specific inquiry, articles undergoing a particular editing process, etc. Presuming this is technically feasible, I would like to be able to watchlist items like these with an expiration date, so that after, say, six months, they automatically disappears from my watchlist. In terms of design, I am thinking that the default would remain \"no expiration\", which would require no additional action, but that an editor could choose expiration option from a dropdown menu. I would further propose the option of changing preferences to reverse this situation, allowing a particular editor to choose a preset expiration time for all watchlisted items, except those for which \"no expiration\" is specifically selected. Thoughts? bd2412 T\n\nbd2412 the request for this feature dates back to at least 2006, and has been submitted for the 2014 WikimediaGermany wishlist and the 2015 WMF Community Tech wishlist. The primary Phabricator item is T100508. Some progress has been made in May of this year upgrading backend systems to support this,[4] however it seems to be lingering again as an \"open task\" with no indication of when anyone is going to work on it.\n\nThe WMF has just been too busy with more important tasks: Renewing Flow development, providing a \"wikitext edit mode\" inside VisualEditor so that they can deprecate the current wikitext editor, and damn near crashing Wikipedia itself with new Wikidata rollouts. (I tried to resist the temptation to be snarky, but I failed badly.) Alsee (talk)\n\n(I tend to be careful of where I'm spending our painfully crowdsourced money, but in case anybody else missed that \"The current wikitext editor is not going anywhere, at least for the next few years.\" - per documentation, now you know! I am unaware of current plans to remove it, but hey, please do keep me posted if you hear otherwise. Elitre (WMF) (talk) )\n\nIf wikitext is not going anywhere, then someone should have time to implement the feature proposed above. bd2412 T\n\nOr maybe this ten-year-old watchlist bug which has been partially responsible for multiple ArbCom cases. Snuge purveyor (talk)\n\nElitre (WMF) per your link, the WMF wants to terminate support for the current editor due to the cost of \"multiple parallel work streams\". Given that the WMF already ignores or neglects community requests for \"high impact\"(random example) work on core wikitext infrastructure because you're too busy chasing visual-butterflies, and given the intention to terminate support for the current editor, I expect the current editor would be even more neglected. I expect your work on other things will cause incidental breakage or crippling of the current editor extremely quickly. However that is almost irrelevant. There is a far far bigger problem here:\n\nThe WMF is repeating a bad old problem. The WMF effectively built the NewEditor in secret. The WMF built the NewEditor with zero community input. Once the prototype was available, the WMF was immediately notified that there were going to be serious community objections. For the last year the WMF has been unwilling or unable to constructively address the issue. There is currently a consensus that the NewEditor is unacceptable.[5] Unacceptable as the default for existing editors. Unacceptable as the default for new editors. Either:\n\nYou need to change the community's mind and build a new consensus that we want the NewEditor promoted to default; or\n\nYou need to throw the NewEditor in the garbage; or\n\nYou keep supporting our primary editor as the primary editor, AND you support the secondary VisualEditor, AND you add maintenance load supporting a pointless tertiary NewEditor; or\n\nYou go to war with the community trying to force out a NewEditor as the default against consensus.\n\nI would like to note that MediaViewer was a rather petty squabble over an essentially cosmetic feature. It blew up because the WMF was unable to constructively engage the community, it blew up because the WMF had zero respect for the consensus process, and it blew up because the WMF committed one of our most serious crimes. The WMF abandoned discussion and Eloquence abused technical protection trying to win a petty dispute by force. If the WMF were to engage in warfare over our core editing platform, things could escalate far worse. The default editor is not a petty issue. Sabotaging wikitext-editing by trying to force out an inferior&sabotaged default-wikitext-editor is a threat to Wikipedia itself. The fact that it's an obsessive-compulsive effort to force everyone into VE just adds insult to injury.\n\nI have been seriously worried about this situation for a year now, and the WMF just keeps ignoring the situation. Jdforrester just goes non-responsive, and Whatamidoing is unwilling or unable to give a constructive response. So since you're here, please don't waste time discussing how the current editor will stay as opt-in \"for years\". That is irrelevant. The dispute is whether the default is going to be changed at all. Please tell me the WMF has some plan for addressing the WMF-community conflict on this issue. Please tell me the WMF isn't going to blindly ignore the issue until \"deployment day\". Please tell me the WMF isn't going to try to force out the NewEditor as default against consensus. Please tell me we're not all just waiting to discover how big and destructive the fireworks are. We should have sorted this out before writing code for a NewEditor. At worst we should have sorted this out immediately after the prototype was built. Alsee (talk)\n\nPer that link, the Foundation does indeed want to remove support for some \"multiple parallel workstreams\". But you will not find any plans, on any page, for removing the 2010 wikitext editor (nor the 2003 editor, for that matter), as you have been told repeatedly (on at least three separate occasions by me personally).\n\nFor those who haven't been told many times already, you can find out just how many editing environments the WMF is currently supporting by looking at the long table at mw:Editor. The only \"removals\" associated with VisualEditor involve converting the codebases for CX and some of the mobile editors, while leaving the end-user experience the same. Completely unrelated to mw:Extension:VisualEditor, the WMF will stop supporting the 2006 Javascript wikitext editor (probably before the end of this calendar year), but it looks like a volunteer at the French Wikipedia will convert it to a user script, in which case I'm not sure that it's accurate to say that anyone is actually \"removing\" it, even though the Foundation will stop fixing it when/if it breaks. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nWhatamidoing (WMF) I am not interested in a Crystalball debate on how long or how well the WMF will support a deprecated editor at the level of functioning expected of a first-rank-editor. It's irrelevant. I will ask, for far more than the third time, for you or anyone from the WMF to address the the #1 #2 #3 #4 issue I posted above regarding default editor, in light of the overwhelming consensus against deploying Visual Editor's new \"wikitext mode\". Alsee (talk)\n\nYour entire premise is wrong. The editing environment you prefer is not deprecated. I would appreciate it if you would quit claiming or even implying that it is.\n\nYour numbered list offers false choices. When and whether it will be offered by default to which users at which wikis has not been decided. The only things that I can say with certainty are:\n\nThe Foundation will not be scrapping VisualEditor's wikitext mode.\n\nIt won't be offered outside the Beta Feature at this wiki until sometime after (possibly long after) the current performance audit is completed. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nSounds interesting. There must be an essay somewhere (?) about the inefficiency of editing based on watchlists. It often seems to lead to accusations of hounding and \"following\". I'm sure it contributes significantly to edit warring. I often wish I could see my Watchlist in reverse time order (is that a editting setting already?) I'm often reminded of an under-10's football match where they all follow the ball round in a tight clump. Martinevans123 (talk)\n\nThere's already a solution to meet this need! Well, a work-around actually. I totally agree that Watchlists are pretty useless as editing tools except to receive email alerts of new changes to pages. Cleaning them out down to just key articles of interest can be a pain. So I installed Page Collector script, and now have two additional, and much more useful watchlists, though you can have more. One is my 'To Do' list to flag up pages I encounter that I'm far too busy to edit right now, but which I definitely want to go back to later and make changes myself. The other is a chronological 'To Monitor' list of pages that I only want to keep an eye on for a short while, often as a result of encountering a page under WP:NPP and seeing how others have handled it where I'm not too sure myself (- a great way to learn). It can also be great for monitoring user contributions to check for persistent vandal activity or to watch someone's talk page for an ongoing topic. You can manually insert a marker date, but there's always the page history to show when items were added. So it's relatively easy to remove 'watched' pages. Adding a page is done from a Tab next to the search bar at the top of the page. If anyone thinks this would meet their needs, here's the link to install it. Nick Moyes (talk)\n\nBD2412, I'm told that this project is about a million dollars' worth of engineering work. But I still want it. ;-) I encourage you to consider adding it to the next m:Community Wishlist, which I believe will start in about three weeks. Whatamidoing (WMF) (talk)\n\nThanks, I will keep that in mind. Cheers! bd2412 T\n\nThe complicated issues arising around the current RFC non-language characters in usernames has a lot of comments around being hard to ping, hard to refer to in 'plain language' form and such like, complicated even more by the issue of arabic and asian charater sets among others. A possible solution to the problem could be to automatically assign a secondary username to ALL usernames as an alias, using a simple number string (say 8 or 10 characters) that serves as an alternative method of referring to, or communicating with, problematic usernames. Pinging the number would do exactly the same as pinging the username. I see this as a simple look-up, whereby each username is backgrounded with the number in the same way you have easy access to a user's contributions, userlog, blocklog etc when hovering over a name. A bot could easily run through assigning exisitng usernames the number and auto-create it on new ones. On the presumption there are existing usernames that consit only of numbers, prefixing it with something like \"~\" (tilde) would distinguish it as an alias. Eg, My username being ClubOranje would have an alias like ~27504667. I'm sure there is someone clever over at Meta that could acheive this. ClubOranjeT\n\nThis should probably be on Meta somewhere, but I can't find an equivalen tpage over there... ClubOranjeT\n\nSuch an idea would likely require some rather significant changes to the MediaWiki software to support these aliases for pings and to show them in the places you propose. BTW, your alias would probably be either 2184171 or 17366057. Anomie⚔\n\n– Pointer to relevant discussion elsewhere.\n\nPlease see Wikipedia talk:What Wikipedia is not#Paragraph 2 of NOTNEWS. The gist: it's suggested that the part in it about Wikipedia not being here for the reporting of breaking news is ignored by a sufficient number of editors that it isn't really a policy and should be deleted. — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nThe key word here is \"enduring\" and if an event or incident fails to prove enduring, it could always get discussed at Wikipedia: Articles for deletion. Vorbee (talk)\n\nSee Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Tasks#Admin_help_wanted and Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/JJMC89_bot_14.\n\nAfter a couple of years of manual effort to move and edit articles to better follow the consensus guidelines about punctuating names in bios (at WP:JR), we're down to a shortlist of exceptions and a long tail of about 1,650 obscure names (see User:Certes/JrSr/titles). So we got some help, including a bot that's ready to finish this. The Bot Approval Group asked that we advertise this here for a week before executing it. If interested, take a look at the lists at User:Certes/JrSr/titles and say if you see any issues. Dicklyon (talk)\n\nDisclosure: I know Dicklyon's work, and usually support his efforts. So all I can say is that I my opinion were sought, I'd support this. Tony (talk)\n\nSupport I see no reason to not proceed with moving the appropriate pages (i.e. non-bio pages need not adhere to WP:JR). However, I am an involved editor and have been making changes to this effect up until this VPP. ~ Tom.Reding (talk ⋅dgaf)\n\nI was wondering if it could be possible to have a more dynamic search bar than what we have. The search bar present automatically looks for the most popular/clicked upon page based on the letters you type in first, but this isn't what I want. I want it to be based on my watchlist, as they are the articles/pages that I frequent the most. For example, if I type in the phrase 'Jack', I come up with File:JackDelanolocomotiveshop.jpg, File:JackXArik.png, Jack Dempsey, Jacksonville, Florida, Jacksonville Jaguars, Jackson, Mississippi, Jackie Robinson, Jackie Chan and Jack Kirby. None of these pages are any that I edit or look at. However, the Jack Gallagher (wrestler) page is on my watchlist and I frequently edit it. Is there a way to make it so that I could see this article at the top of my search? Pages I frequently edit and are on my watchlist, I use the search bar to quickly navigate to and I feel like they should pop up at the top of searches as something that is on my watchlist. If there is a way to do this, please let me know. Regards, — Moe Epsilon\n\nThat would be useful. · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nThis would probably be a software change, please see how to request these at Wikipedia:Bug reports and feature requests. עוד מישהו Od Mishehu\n\n@Od Mishehu: thanks, but would I not need local consensus before I requested something such as that?

Please read the proposal and comment as you feel is necessary. Thanks! --Jayron32\n\nBasically, the idea is that we could have a \"Team\" of people who sit at the new pages feed and, after finding an article which isn't CSD-able, making rapid changes to turn it into at least a stub. (Fixing grammatical errors, adding a dozen or so sources, tagging the issues, and expanding the article) Terrariola\n\nIsn't this what WP:NPP does? Darylgolden(talk) Ping when replying\n\nStrictly speaking, no. It's a triage, not a field hospital. It's difficult enough to get the 430 reviwers to do the bare minimum. In fact about 90% of the reviewing is done by about 10% of the reviewers. Kudpung กุดผึ้ง (talk)\n\nWell... ideally when NPP comes a cross a page with obvious and easily fixable errors, they should take a few seconds and fix them, which I normally do. You know, put on a tourniquet and tag them with a casualty card for the MASH unit. But if we can't get NPP to do at least that, I don't see a reason why we should expect to be able to assemble some other team to do it instead. GMGtalk\n\nNPP is almost 100% CSD-ing, my idea is not for simple grammatical fixes, but turning \"Substub\" articles into proper stubs with reliably sourced text and the appropriate images, infoboxes, audio, etc.— Preceding unsigned comment added by Terrariola (talk • contribs)\n\nThe idea that NPP is mainly CSDing is a misconception. Since ACTRIAL, to be honest, most of the work I do there when I'm reviewing new pages is stuff like formatting references. Even before ACTRIAL it was never mostly CSD for me, but there was a lot more of it. But to your idea: that is in theory what the tags do: let people know an article is unreferrnced or whatever so they can fix it. We see how well that actually works, but I don't think creating a team to work on new pages after they are triaged would really do anything much more than we have now. TonyBallioni (talk)\n\nCan it do any harm? · · · Peter (Southwood) (talk):\n\nIt wouldn't do any harm, but Terrariola not being a New Page Reviewer may not be aware that it's chicken/egg. We need interested reviewers and we urgently need some enhancements to the system, and without one we don't get the other. Kudpung กุดผึ้ง (talk)\n\nThis sounds like a good idea for a \"task force\" under NPP, but like Kudpung said above, NPP is already sorely understaffed and fixing that is much more impactful to readers. — xaosflux Talk\n\nThe suggestion has already been put forward that New Page Reviewers should have the option of leaving a copy of constructive feedback and suggestions on the article's Talk Page for all to see, and not just on the creator's own talk page. I think this might help a bit, were it ever to be implemented. Regards from the UK. Nick Moyes (talk)\n\nSome of us do consider that NPP is a place for categorisation and other fixes as well as for deletion tagging. I think it a shame when I see a patroller who hasn't yet started to improve articles. But it would be a mistake to do too much of that at the very front of the NPP queue, most new articles have no sections, and many are created by newish editors who have not yet mastered the art of fixing edit conflicts. The number of new and not so new editors who have suffered from edit conflicts on the second or third edit to the article they just started is non trivial. ϢereSpielChequers\n\nIt is important that the references in legal citations in articles invovlving explanation of law in the United States give the correct information in the proper form, in order to be able to be looked up for those that wish to read the cases for themselves. Therefore, it is proposed that editors should be required to follow proper form when they cite U.S. case law. For example, We might often see a citation like this (IF we're lucky): Brown V. Board (1954). Where the proper citation is: Brown V. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).\n\nThis gets compounded when the author is intending to cite to specific pages of a decision, where the proper form is as follows:\n\nParty V. Party, Volume number of the reporter, Reporter name, Page No. the case starts on, page numbers cited to, court name (Supreme court of the U.S. is ALWAYS omitted), Year of case.\n\nIt is worthy of mention in support of this that things such as law reviews, etc. ARE NOT binding. Rather only direct quotes from the proper reporters are binding. [in the case of the Supreme Court, only direct quotes from the United States Reporter are actually binding law, cited as ___ U.S.___)].\n\nThis is necessary to ensure that articles are as accurate as possible, and to ensure that citations are compatible to other look -up tools such as lexus-nexus, findlaw, fastcase, etc., which expect proper citation; as well as to ensure that where case names are searched in google, that the user is able to easily identify the correct case as pertinent. This will help to streamline wikipedia review functions, as well as give the users the correct tools within which to further their own research into the subject matter of the given article. 108.201.29.108 (talk)\n\nSee {{Cite court}}, a template that standardizes the formatting and reminds you what fields to include. The few times I've wanted to cite a case, I spent a long time trying to figure out how to look up the reporter and details therein, and then just gave up. I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know the lingo or reference tools. If I know the involved parties, court, and date, and maybe even a caselaw.findlaw.com link, how do I find the other details? Take as a specific example footnote 1 at Davol Square. DMacks (talk)\n\nI think its unreasonable to expect laymen to be able to understand that they are doing it wrong. The best that can be done is to provide better instructions for how to do it right, and fix any errors we find. Dysklyver\n\nIt's generally pretty easy to find the full information for a reasonably notable case by googling the case name. Also, as to the original comment, the \"v.\" should be lowercase. bd2412 T\n\nConcur with Dysklyver and with BD2412 (including on the typographical matter). — SMcCandlish ☏ ¢ >ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ<\n\nWikipedia articles are supposed to be cited to secondary sources, rather than primary sources such as legal cases, so this should not be a major issue. If this is a problem anywhere then it can simply be fixed by someone who knows how to do it better as with everything else on Wikipedia. I don't see that there's any need to require anybody to change the way that they write citations. And should we develop similar rules for citing legal cases in the countries where 96% or so of the world's population lives? 86.17.222.157 (talk)"
