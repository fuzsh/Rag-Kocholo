Alternately addressed as Four Hudson Square, the 22-story, 338-foot-tall steel-framed structure is designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill and is being developed by Silverstein Properties. The media giant purchased the full-block parcel from Trinity Church Real Estate for a total of $650 million and Skanska demolished four old structures that occupied the site last summer. Lendlease is constructing the new headquarters, which is bound by Varick Street to the east, Spring Street to the south, Hudson Street to the west, and Vandam Street to the north.\n\nRead More\n\nConstruction Tops Out at 141 Willoughby Street in Downtown Brooklyn\n\nA new 24-story commercial tower at 141 Willoughby Street in Downtown Brooklyn has officially topped out.
