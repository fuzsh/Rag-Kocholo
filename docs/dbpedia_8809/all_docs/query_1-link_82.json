        "text": "History of Irving Place\n\nIrving Place was established in 1831 by Samuel B. Ruggles who also built Gramercy Park (Moscow, 62). He had petitioned city of New York to make an extra street between Third and Fourth Avenues, where he owned most of the land. He dedicated the street which runs from 14thstreet to Gramercy Park South to his good friend Washington Irving, a diplomat and a writer, who was at the peak of his career. It opened in 1833 as a prime location due to Union Square Park in the west, Gramercy Park in the north, and later Stuyvesant Square to the East in 1836 (Harris, 12).\n\nThe architecture, stores and venues, and residents of this area were exclusive. First, the architectures were fashionable and up to date. In the 1830~40’s, they were built as Greek Revival style rowhouses which use red bricks for walls and stairs from the sidewalk up to the entrance; in the 50’s they were Italianate style rowhouses which use brownstones (65); in 1870 they started experimenting with flathouses which hold many rooms and multiple tenants (Where and How). After 1873, there were no longer single-family rowhouses on East 17th and Irving (Harris, 2). Even though the rent costed $1500 per year [$21375 in 2002 value, my calculation] in 1870 on Irving Place in a 20 feet by 60 feet flathouse, hundreds of applicants flocked here because of all the “clubs, concerts, lecture, operas, and houses they most desire to frequent (Where and How).\n\nIrving Place always attracted middle-class and upper-middle class from the establishment to the present day. The first occupants of Irving Place until 1880’s were “well-to-do merchants, bankers, politicians, professional men, and their extended families” (Harris, 1); the second set of occupants were artists and writers such as Broadway and vaudeville stars (20); and the latest set of occupants since the 30’s were salesmen and clerks who work at garment factories and wholesalers(23). [*the fashion district is now deteriorating in NYC so there could have been another wave of occupants… I couldn’t find exactly what kind of people now live on Irving, but I’m pretty sure they have some sort of lucrative careers.]\n\nDuring this early period, Irving Place and area near Union Square became a most desirable living quarters because of the high-quality venues surround them. There were various shopping quarters around Union Square until later when they moved to midtown (14). Academy of Music opened in 1854 on the North block of 14thstreet near Irving Place. Irving Hall opened in 1859, which was replaced by Amberg Theater in 1888 when German immigrants, Kleindeutschland, centered Irving Place as their living quarters, which was later replaced by Irving Place Theater, which is now demolished (19). The Irving Hall served its purpose as “a ballroom, concert, and lecture hall annex\n\nto the Academy [of Music]… and served as the home to the NY Philharmonic in 1861-63” (17), described as “a new and elegant temple of the light fantastic foe” (General) in the NY Times in 1860. Next block was Steinway Hall, which served as a piano showroom and a recital hall (NY, 200). The Kleindeutschland “had a major influence on the political, cultural, and especially musical life of the neighborhood” (Harris, 19)… which brings us to the present day.\n\nEven though Academy of Music, Irving Hall, and other venues may have been demolished, the legacy still lives on through Irving Plaza, a concert venue that holds hundreds of shows every year (Naurekas). The Irving Plaza is the flower of Irving Place; it is the hottest place to be on this street. Other businesses include sushi restaurant, bakery, coffee bar and Pete’s Tavern (a saloonwhich has survived since 1864 through the Prohibition Era) between 19th and 18th streets, two restaurants and two bars between 18th and 17th, “Washington Irving House” and Washington Irving High School between 17th and 16th, Irving Plaza between 16th and 15th, and Zeckendorf Towers and Con Ed Building between 15th and 14th (Naureckas). Other than the aforementioned businesses, Irving Place is largely a residential area, just as it was back in the 1800’s.\n\nFun Fact: Washington Irving was thought to had lived on Irving Place, but it was only his nephew, Edgar Irving, who did. (Harris, 14). It was because of this confusion that kept Irving Place from having something other than residential homes and residential area-friendly businesses built.

On the north end of Irving Place, one arrives at the Gramercy Park—the only surviving private park on Manhattan Island. It stayed relatively unchanged since 1831 when it was established, and, as written in the plaque, it was appointed as a Historic District. Gramercy Park and its surrounding areas give off a quaint atmosphere, as if one is suddenly transported onto a wealthy street somewhere in Europe.\n\nCompared to the rest of the city’s parks and their surrounding environment, Gramercy Park may be the elitist, unwelcoming place of all. The sidewalks do not get enough sunlight except on the park itself because of the tall apartments, and only people who live in buildings surrounding the park have access to the inside of the park if they pay a high annual fee. The restrictive policy leaves the others who do not live in the luxurious apartments peering inside the iron gates wondering how it might be to jog on the clean, untouched gravel paths.\n\nThe park’s enticing force drew writers such as Mark Twain, Herman Melville, Henry James and O. Henry (who wrote Gift of the Magi at Pete’s Tavern) to Irving Place. Even Sarah Jessica Parker attempted to purchase a house around the Gramercy Park but was outbid by $18 million.\n\nIn fact, when 40 mostly minority students of Washington Irving High School went into Gramercy Park on a field trip in 2001, they were reported to the police by the park trustee; they were not charged with trespassing. This episode could have resulted in civil law suit. Since 2007 the keyholders of the Park no longer allow the public into the park on the used-to-be annual “Gramercy Park Day.” It is “Now elitist only 364 days a year” because the park goes public only on every Christmas Eve. It seems that the Gramercy Park residents prefer to keep the park “ornamental,” the original vision by Samuel B. Ruggles who designed the park so that the people living in the townhouses would have a view of the park from a height. I was not able to take great pictures from the ground level because of this design.\n\nThe park’s nickname is “A Victorian Gentleman Who Refused To Die,” and the old ways have made the area an increasingly uncomfortable and lifeless environment. Outsiders watch with perturbed eyes as the Gramercy Park’s restrictiveness is bringing down the elitist neighborhood with its decay.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nWalking on Irving Place\n\nIrving Place was surprisingly busy with people at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday. As I observed, Irving Place increasingly seemed like an asyndeton, “the suppression of linking words such as conjunctions and adverbs, either within a sentence or between sentences” (De Certeau, 101) because it was not all that uniform throughout. I had known that though Irving Place is a largely upper-middle class and upper-class residential and leisurely street, but I was surprised at how the bottom of the street—14th to 17th—felt the most fragmented compared to the quiet, elitist and organized 17th to 20th. The block between 14th and 15th have what one would normally see on a bigger street—a sports bar on the west side and the NY Sports Club on the east side.\n\nThe next block has on its west side Irving Plaza, which houses as a concert venue as well as a church on Sundays, and on its east side the office of the Rosicrucian Order, an occult organization.\n\nNext block has New York City’s Human Resources Administration and Washington Irving house on the west side while the Washington Irving High School is on the east side.\n\nThe transition starts on 17th street. Up to this intersection, there are numerous gum drop marks on the concrete sidewalk that have turned black overtime that prove that many people traversed the area and the level of their etiquette.\n\nAbove 17th street, I observed that many people, in their 20’s to 80’s, sat in one of the quaint, expensive restaurants and chatted away or simply sat on a set of steps or a bench. I wondered how these people can be so leisurely at 2 in the afternoon on a weekday. Since bodily dispositions are culturally or socially produced through “mimetic processes” (Morris 685), I was able to see (or judge) that the people who were quite old had the air of upper class people who lived in the vicinity. I was unsure of others, if they live or do not live around Irving Place, but it was sure that they had the time and money to enjoy such luxury at that particular hour of the day. These people define Irving Place space into a particular place, a sensuous and sumptuous place.\n\nContrastingly as I was walking away from Irving Place towards Union Square on 16th street, I saw a mob of Beth Israel Hospital nurses pouring out of a building. I was able to immediately identify that they were not the type of people (middle-class) to be spotted on the upper side of Irving Place, since “[a] type of walking mobilizes particular semiotic regimes that are articulated to different ideological meanings; for example, the display of certain [clothing]… of various ‘community’ identities that are organized around particular mythologies” (Morris, 689). The nurses had a bright blue uniform and a giggly, schoolgirl-like atmosphere to them as they linked their arms and walked towards the direction of Union Square. From the memory of the past, similar present, into an anticipated future (690), all were happening at that precise moment; these women were looking forward to having lunch together like they do every day.\n\nI was able to see a complete contrast of atmosphere between Irving Place and the streets connected to it. There is such a dynamic relationship between people and how the street, its buildings and businesses dictate where and what kind of people belong there. Every block is different and none are the same, you only need to turn at the corner to see a completely different New York on Irving Place.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCerteau, Michel de. “Walking in the City.” The Practice of Everyday Life.

The different opinions on this subject matter were covered in articles “Million-Dollar Operation on Irving Place Corner: Second Large Project Recently Undertaken in Hitherto Neglected Neighborhood—Details of the Structure” and “Irving Place Changes: Tall Buildings and Stores Robbing it of its Quiet Atmosphere,” both written in 1909 when the new plans took off. Irving Place the street was not photographed or documented much while it was still a quiet, residential area considering it was a more private, residential part of New York. Only the apartments around Gramercy Park are the remnants of what Irving Place might had been, since now the lower streets—14th to 17th—are mostly big buildings (NYC Human Resources Center, bike shop, Rosicrucian Order, Irving Plaza), while the upper streets—17th to 20th—are still largely residential but is bustling and spotted with restaurants, a spa, a yoga studio, and other small businesses. Crang says in his essay “Envisioning Urban Histories” that “History does not form a presence on the scene but an absence and loss or, rather, a ghostly presence that haunts the city–not life as it was but life as it has been forgotten” (Crang, 448) This is very true of Irving Place since one feels the ghostly absence of life in the lower section of Irving, as if the 100-year-old-lamentations still echo through time and its current residents.\n\nAlthough there are no remaining photographs left to describe the process, these articles are substitutes as “narratives of destruction” (444). The “Irving Place Changes” article in particular talks about the “air of old-fashioned dignity and substantial respectability rare in a street so near the centres of business” (Irving). This is still the case now. As I have commented on an earlier entry, the Gramercy Park has been called “The Victorian Gentleman Who Refused to Die,” and it fits quite well into how history becomes a ghost that haunts the city since the Gramercy Park is often considered elitist and some frown upon the privileged atmosphere even though it’s only been preserved through decades and the changing city. It is history you can see in present day, yet people do not revel by it, they are instead offended. The article also uses words such as “robbed,” “destroyed,” and “lose.” The second article, “Million Dollar Operation on Irving Place Corner” which talks about the construction of the current NYC Human Resources Center, interestingly describes Irving Place as a “neglected neighborhood” that had “nothing about it to indicate that Union Square and the Subway were only a short block away,” and that the new construction would “change the whole outlook for its [Irving Place’s] future (Million). It goes on to talk positively about the development and change the surrounding area will be going through. The journalist believes that Irving Place needs to be transitioned into the greater part of NYC. It seems that the past should only live in photographs lest they become stagnant in the present, and some things are better to be forgotten and only reminded from time to time, but unfortunately that is not possible for Irving Place.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCrang, M. “Envisioning Urban Histories.” Environment and Planning. 1996.

So unfortunately, this entry is not going to be as spectacular, but here are some newfound miscellaneous revelations of Irving Place through NYPL Digital Gallery.\n\nThis is the view of Irving Place from 14th street to the north from early 1900’s. There is nothing recognizable about this section of the street, except that maybe the scaffolding on one of the buildings resembles that of Irving Plaza. There is an unexplained platform running across overhead on 15th street. I wonder what this could be, since I could not find any information about a platform running across Irving above ground level.\n\nHere is the picture of the “fake” Washington Irving house, which is probably the most well-preserved building out of the entire street. Notice that it has unique architectural style that is not the typical New York style. NYC.GOV’s citymap application shows that this house was built in 1800 (estimated), which is around or before when Ruggles established Irving Place in 1831.\n\nGramercy Park seems strangely barren 100 years ago; you can actually see Lexington Avenue through the park. Now there are many more trees, bushes and more privacy in this area, which may have changed the residents’ vision of how the park should be managed and diminished their generosity to outsiders. There is much more sunlight and warmth then than now, even with the same iron gates that keep out intruders. Would have Ruggles wanted to make the park solely “decorative” to those who live up high in one of the townhouses? Which is his true intention?\n\nOne of the NYT historical article lamented that Irving Place was becoming plagued with small businesses over a short period of time. This picture shows west block of Irving between 18th and 19th streets where it is now taken over by quaint restaurants. Had I not seen this picture, I would have never understood why the residents were so furious with the changes. The street probably resembles what the typical New York street would have looked like, which takes away the identity of Irving Place.\n\nThe Con Edison clock tower building used to be Consolidated Gas Company’s, since Con Edison expanded. It looks exactly the same except for the bright neon lights.\n\nLastly, this early map shows exactly where the former Steinway building and Academy of Music building were located—but for the life of me I cannot decipher what the rest of the map indicates.\n\nPicture Sources in Order:\n\n14th street http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=711229F&t=w\n\nWashington Irving House http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=711396F&t=w\n\nNYC.GOV http://gis.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/\n\nGramercy Park South http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=720050F&t=w\n\n18th street http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=720648F&t=w\n\nConsolidated Gas Tower http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=711227F&t=w\n\nCon Edison Tower http://www.takethehandle.com/2010/03/05/corner-by-corner-14th-street-irving-place/\n\nEarly Map of Irving Place\n\nAcademy of Music http://images.nypl.org/index.php?id=G91F216_039F&t=w\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nSusan Vreeland’s Clara and Mr. Tiffany\n\nClara and Mr. Tiffany was published this year (2011), and it gives a sense of professional working women’s position in the early 1900’s New York. The book is grounded in historical facts, that the protagonist Clara Driscoll, the famous artistic contributor behind Tiffany studios, who was hired by Mr. Tiffany who is now known for his tiffany lamps (Hofer). The novel is a representation of New York’s artists who lived below 23rd street in the early 1900’s, a rarely depicted subject in New York fictions. For example, House of Mirth depicted a Victorian-era New York just above the 23rd street and the Hamptons, among other lavish locations.\n\nIt would have been quicker to go to Peter Cooper’s Restaurant near the studio, but the three misses lunched there, and that meant six ears vibrating with curiosity. I had a reason to get Theresa and Marion into Healy’s Café on Irving and Eighteenth, in addition to their chicken hash, which I loved. On the way, I urged them to try it with chunky applesauce and corn bread.\n\nAs we approached the café, a dapper man walking in the opposite direction opened the door for us, and a sheaf of handwritten pages slipped out of his hand.\n\n“Oh, I’m sorry,” said Marion.\n\n“It’s nothing.” The man continued to hold the door for the three of us while his papers were blowing away. Once inside, we watched him chase them, enter the café, and sit at the far table.\n\n“One of the men at my boardinghouse knows him,” I said in a near whisper. “He lives alone across the street, and takes his meals here. Rumor has it that he was in prison once. He writes stories here about characters who have lost respectability or integrity and find a way to win it back again. He goes by the name of O. Henry.” (Vreeland, 360-361)\n\nAs did The Colossus of New York and A Walker in the City, Clara and Mr. Tiffany includes [food and] gossiping about strange people in its story. For example, in The Colossus: “Such a strange bunch. Such thin walls in this place. Ire and compassion have been neighbors for years, eavesdropping on arguments and clucking tongues, but they haven’t seen each other for years” (Whitehead, 78), and in A Walker: “I had never known anyone like them. They were weary people, strange and bereft people” (Kazin, 118).\n\nIt is interesting to see how Vreeland shows the irony of gossip in this short passage of Clara’s observation of O. Henry in Healy’s Café – now Pete’s Tavern. Clara decides to avoid eating at Peter Cooper’s restaurant because she would be talked about, yet she is the one to gossip about another person. The fact that all of these NY fictions—Clara and Mr. Tiffany, House of Mirth, The Colossus of New York, A Walker in the City—have someone talking about someone else’s eccentricity, means that everyone is eccentric and everyone is at the mercy of others’ mouths,b ut New York gossip not quite like small town gossip because the dynamic of its population is unique of New York’s cosmopolitanism.\n\nOn another note, O. Henry’s Gift of the Magi was famously written at Healy’s Café/Pete’s Tavern.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHofer, Margaret K., Nina Gray, and Martin Eidelberg. “Clara Driscoll and the Tiffany Girls: The Women of Tiffany Studios by Margaret K.

August Rush, or Evan Taylor, is an unintended orphan and a gifted musician who finds his way back to New York City where his parents live, both of whom are renowned musicians. Louis Connelly is his long-lost father, who is the lead singer of a rock band.\n\nHis subplot constantly returns to Irving Plaza, where he and his band play on the night that he and Lyla, Evan’s mother, meet. Everything outside of the portrayal of the show is surprisingly accurate, since many New York City films tend to glamorize or depict an abstract version of it. There was no “drifting”: “a deliberate attempt to assess the ambience of the city by putting space together in a counter-intuitive way, through the artifice of looking for (false?) origins and traditions” (Leach, 213). By starting off by introducing a group of young runaway boys then moving towards Evan’s parents, the audience can see the nitty-gritty of the city—both the dark and the good; the maneuvering of children, adult, and traffic; and AN ACTUAL DIRTY NYC SUBWAY. Clearly, this film was directed by someone who knew the city well and was familiar with the atmosphere of Union Square, Washington Square Park, and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nReturning to the portrayal of Irving Plaza and Louis Connelly’s band, it is somewhat disappointing to see a less-than-authentic dynamic in the audience in the beginning credits, before Evan was born. This part of the film might have been “drifted”.\n\nThe audience was not moshing properly; they were jumping up and down instead of pushing each other, and the people in the middle of the floor were jumping higher than the ones in front of the stage. This subtle difference has a great impact, since the rest of the movie has such a flawless representation of NYC. NYC is known for the best shows in all the world, and August Rushtries too hard to portray one.\n\nEleven years later, Louis Connelly decides to perform again with the band. He goes straight to Irving Plaza’s manager and plays for him, begging him to hear one song so that he can prove himself worthy of Irving Plaza. This is entirely inaccurate because musicians do not directly go to the venue to book—or beg, for that matter—to play a show at a legitimate concert hall like Irving Plaza. Any professional band would have a booking agent, who would have to call the venue’s booker in order to formally set up a date. If it were a small club or a café, Louis’s method would have worked.\n\nNevertheless, he is approved by the manager and he and his band magically reunite and they play a night at Irving Plaza THAT SAME NIGHT.\n\nThey also magically have a private van and roadies within hours—after more than ten years of hibernation.\n\nHere is the concert from the film; footage starts at 0:50.\n\nHere is the real-life example of an excellent concert at Irving Plaza, brought to you by yours truly and The Damned–the original Punk Goth band of the 70’s. The crowd goes wild on their opening song. Notice the smooth yet rough flow of the crowd and fist-pumping at every beat.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nNightlife at Irving Plaza and Interview\n\nIrving Plaza is one of the most famous venues in New York City, therefore in the world. It is known for hosting concerts for some of the greatest artists of the times. Artists of various genres perform there on many nights, and each night there is a different kind of crowd. At night, Irving Plaza brightens up the block with neon lights on its scaffolding. Something about the neon lights excite Irving Plaza’s night-revellers.\n\nVibrant hues invite the audience into the world of “underground” night life, where they can stay up and not go home (Shlor, 239). People stand in line for hours in hopes to stand in front of the stage. When the show starts, the lights captivate the audience and replicate the sounds created. Irving Plaza has the same character that is reflected on the interior as well as the exterior: “The street is external and internal space at the same time; seen from the enclosed spaces that line it, it is part of the external world, and in the course of privatization of certain needs and tasks various functions are withdrawn from it step by step” (238). The artist is often the puppeteer of the audience who wishes to be dominated.\n\nIn enclosed spaces night life can more easily be controlled, domesticated, civilized, reduced to a manageable scale (251), and lights and music are the tools of exhilaration. Outside, noise barely escapes until the crowd is released at midnight.\n\nThere is another side to Irving Plaza. Hillsong Church holds service throughout the day on Sundays when “the image of the street changes with its functions” (236). There are no neon lights, no devious people. One interesting detail about Hillsong Church is that its band, Hillsong, is a famously known Christian band. They play in Irving Plaza for the services and tour on their own.\n\nOn the night of Miyavi, I had the chance to talk to one of the friendly security guards at Irving Plaza.\n\nQ. Tell me a little bit about yourself.\n\nA. My name is Ramel. I’ve been working at Irving Plaza for thirteen years. Started off when I was about seventeen. One of the guys saw me and they liked what they saw and they said “Hey, this guy can defend himself! Come work for security.” And I got my security license. I’ve been working here ever since.\n\nQ. What was your first impression?\n\nA. First Impression was, wow. This is weird. Different music, different genres, different crowds. One of my first shows was an English band. It was weird because I didn’t know their lingo. And some guy goes, “Hey, can I get a lighter fag?” And I said “What d’you call me?” and he’s “No, I mean lighter for me fags.” Then I found out that they call fags cigarettes. You learn a lot from different crowds.\n\nQ. What has surprised you most about working at Irving Plaza?\n\nA. You can find different people going to different shows. I thought I’d never see so many Mexicans at a country show, so many black guys at a rock show. There are different genres different people and I realize that music is universal. It’s like a cultural melting pot.\n\nQ. Tell me about some of the people you’ve met while working here.\n\nA. I don’t watch sports but a lot of celebrities come by. I don’t know who they are but somebody tells me who they are. Also other musicians that I’m not particularly interested in their genre, and I’ve never seen them on TV but they might be super famous in their country or wherever they’re from. Crowds of people might cling to them then I’m like, they must be somebody, it must be a celebrity. That’s how I find out about who’s who! One time I met Mick Jagger and I said “You know you have to get back to the end of the line!” I felt bad after I found out it was him.\n\nQ. What do you do when you aren’t working at Irving Plaza?\n\nA. I’m a landlord and I own a brownstone out in Brooklyn. I run out the land and collect the money and pay bills. That’s about it. I was in school for a while but it got complicated working late nights then having to wake up and work early in the morning, so I left that alone for a few semesters. I plan on going back.\n\nQ. What might someone be suprised to know about you?\n\nA. That the smallest guy like me, 5’6”, is capable of defending himself. I might not pick on a big guy, but the little guy always gives me the attitude. So they’ll be surprised.\n\nQ. Do you have any crazy stories while working here?\n\nA. Just the drunk girl stories where I put ‘em in a cab then they’ll get out around the corner. Then you feel for their safety. I’m surprised that a lot of guys still carry around knives, like hunting knives, and they still try to get in and a lot of police officers don’t like to check their firearms, but it’s the rule here.\n\nQ. Is there anything else you’d like to tell me?\n\nA. Irving Plaza is a great place to work. I get to see free concerts. I love it.\n\nI have a colorful Flickr collection of concert photos from Miyavi 10/31, Howard Jones 10/18, Jane’s Addiction 10/17, X 9/30, Yngwie Malmsteen 10/13, The Damned 10/22, and Tom Tom Club 10/3. The best way to browse through the album is to enlarge it to full screen–you will be able to see the details in caption and smoothly scroll through pictures.\n\nHere are some of the videos from the nights at Irving Plaza. They have all been filmed by me and all are watchable for up to 1080p for your viewing pleasure. In all of these footages it becomes quite evident that the better the show is, the more obedient the audience becomes, whether that translates into moshing, singing along, or following the musician’s every command. Every musician at every show that I’ve been to seems to love to emphasize that they’re in NYC. Jane’s Addiction, especially, made jokes about NYC between every song. There is a special connection between music and NYC.\n\nMiyavi\n\nJane’s Addiction\n\nYngwie Malmsteen\n\nX – Los Angeles\n\nThe Tom Tom Club\n\nWorks Cited\n\nhttp://hillsongnyc.com/church-times-locations\n\nSchlor, Joachim. “Nights in the Big City”\n\nWashington, Ramel. Personal Interview. 31 October 2011.\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n111 Gramercy Park and Gramercy Park\n\nBoth renditions of the pilot were unsold. It seems that even TV pilots can reflect the “Victorian gentleman who refused to die” quality of Gramercy Park. Each pilots have focus on different characters. 111 Gramercy Park was the first to be made and it focuses more on the people living in the apartments and less on the nannies who work for them. Gramercy Park tries to focus on everyone equally. The former comes off as almost a Korean drama that deals with the complexities of rich aristocratic families whose main concerns are to hold onto one’s social standing and paying off women to keep them from marrying their sons, but has in-depth character development. The latter turns out to be on the borderline of a cheesy soap opera with simple characters such as the immature trust fund baby, the dazed nanny, overbearing mistress of the house, among others.\n\nFriends and Sex & the City are the closer examples to these TV pilots. Whereas Friends represents New York City in one compact block, these pilots show it in one luxurious building. Its characters are compartmentalized into each of their rooms, such as “Apartment 7A – The Hanovers,” “Apartment 5C – The Warners,” and “Apartment 6B – The Quinns.” They also show the glamour of New York City, but not as much as Sex & the City would—111 Gramercy Park is more about the technicalities of having a certain status and living in such neighborhood while Gramercy Park fills the time with sex romp scenes (cop out?).\n\n111 Gramercy Park has an inauthentic quality because was shot in Toronto, and this is apparent throughout the episode. The shot of “Gramercy Park” and the apartment are probably an imagined drawing. (I could not tell because the quality was too grainy.) The Park looks so public and spacious to the point that it looks like the south side of Central Park. Also, the architecture of 111 Gramercy Park is not like the real apartments surrounding the park because there are no steps leading to the entrance and the doors are not glass. Thus, in 111 Gramercy Park, “what counts is not the authenticity of a piece” (1) but the idea —Gramercy Park in New York City upholds a Victorian lifestyle even in modern times.\n\nIt is surprising that Gramercy Park was actually shot in New York City and inside Gramercy Park since the keyholders of the park are firm about the alienation of outsiders. For the first time, we can see the view of the park from the sky. This is a rare piece of the city one can hardly find.\n\nThrough observations of media representations of Irving Place, I found that movies and TV shows are able to excel at either correct representation of the city or the actual development of the story, but only one at a time.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n111 Gramercy Park http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWVqs4c_CaE\n\nGramercy Park http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ny2MJUO-tg&feature=related\n\nSadler, William J. and Haskins, Ekaterina V. Metonymy and the Metropolis: Television Show Settings and the Image of New York City\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nGramercy Park and Billy Joel’s New York State of Mind\n\nBecause sounds of a place can give it a specific identity, Gramercy Park and Irving Place are known for being the quieter parts of the town and is considered more respectable. These streets have minimal sound level; the only loud noises are sirens that occasionally come from Union Square or Third Avenue.\n\nI found the Gramercy Park video ironic. To a person who does not see the video in serious light would think that Billy Joel’s “New York State of Mind” was a perfect representation of “An oasis of beauty and tranquility in the heart of Manhattan,” which is the description of the video. The video suggests that the jazzy, bluesy and calm piano music is the essence of tranquility but the history of jazz suggests that it is not the case. Corbould talks about the origins of jazz in upper NYC as a “modern expression of primitivism” which was “faster and more complex than African music” and used all kinds of tools such as cowbells, spoons and even screams to make mechanic-primitive noise. All the noise is reduced to silence in Billy Joel’s rendition of jazz which is perfectly parallel to the aural atmosphere of Gramercy Park; there is no human sound escaping the townhouses, and if one tries hard she can hear the silence just like the song itself. The reason Gramercy Park neighborhood is respectable is the silence, which is directly related to the fact that the neighborhood is predominately white, and vice versa (861).\n\nAs an analogy—as I recall a Maceo Parker show, he and his band played a Billy Joel style jazz song—very calm, classy, and ample amount of piano—to which the crowd became confused. At the end of the song, he abruptly cut off his saxophone playing and said, “That’s not the kind of jazz we play,” and sped up in a James Brown jazz fashion. During the show, I slowly began to understand that the original New York jazz genre which has much more power and funk than the whitewashed version. After many cultural filterings, Billy Joel mixed jazz with his classical roots and created the calmer, “whiter” version of jazz, one that appeals to the greater mainstream population of America. It goes the same for the youtube video—the “white” culture enjoys the tranquility of Gramercy Park in a nevertheless “New York state of mind,” inevitably a mixture of many diverse cultures no matter how high the iron fence stands.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCorbould, Clare “Streets , Sounds and Identity in Interwar Harlem.” Journal of Social History – Volume 40, Number 4, Summer 2007, pp. 859-894\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\n———————————————————————————————————————————————\n\nDigital Representation of Irving Place\n\nThrough Google Earth, Google Maps and Foursquare, I was able to find an another Irving Place. Here, Irving Place is a mixed reality environment where the physical and virtual spaces are combined because of temporalization and spatialization. For example, the virtual Irving Place in Google Earth has two different times. Irving Place has street-view pictures from after 2009 with the present red neon Irving Plaza banner intact; its intersection, 15th street, dates from between 2007 and 2009 when Irving Plaza was renovated and briefly renamed as “The Fillmore at NYC Irving Plaza” (Sisario).\n\nAlso, the scaffolding on 18th street remains on Irving Place view while the view from 18th street does not have it. Then, the dated street-views are ‘virtual’ because it is “immaterial, outside of time, both distant and close” (Galloway 390).\n\nGoogle Earth and Google Maps focus on mapping places of consumerism, as does Amble Time discussed in the reading (392). Many places are out of order in these interactive maps where its users create the reflection of the geographical counterpart. The users are more focused on highlighting the leisure aspects of the city rather than laborious, governmental, or educational. For example, restaurants such as Casa Mono and Pure Food & Wine are in their correct locations, while Washington Irving High School is incorrectly located on the west side of the block between 16th and 17th, virtually replacing and eradicating the important NYC Human Resources building.\n\nOnly when NYC Human Resources Administration is googled does it pop up on Google Maps; it is incorrectly named N Y City of Human Resources, with a personal comment: “i hate that they dont pick up there phones”. It seems as though NYC Human Resources Administration building has no virtual or physical presence.\n\nWhereas NYC HR Administration is void in the virtual map, other consumerist and leisurly places on Irving Place have significant physical and online presence.
