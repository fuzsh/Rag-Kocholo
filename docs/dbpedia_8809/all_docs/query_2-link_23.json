        "text": "Next on our construction countdown at number 29 is 451 Tenth Avenue, a 587-foot-tall residential skyscraper in Hudson Yards. Designed by Handel Architects and developed by Related Companies, the 45-story structure stands on an L-shaped plot at the corner of Tenth Avenue and West 35th Street.\n\nYIMBY is kicking off its annual countdown of the 31 tallest buildings being built in New York City, starting with 606 West 30th Street, a 545-foot-tall residential skyscraper in Hudson Yards that recently resumed construction after a period of inactivity. Designed by Ismael Leyva Architects and developed by Lalezarian Properties, the 42-story mixed-use skyscraper will yield a total 312,350 square feet, of which 192,780 will be dedicated to residential space and 14,240 for commercial use. The Midtown, Manhattan property is located between Eleventh Avenue and West Street, near the border with West Chelsea. 606 West 30th Street is also known as Tower B in a two-tower development along with the adjacent 601 West 29th Street, an already topped-out 695-foot-tall skyscraper by FXCollaborative for Douglaston Development.\n\nConstruction is nearing the halfway mark on TSX Broadway, a 46-story hotel at 1568 Broadway in the heart of Times Square. Designed by PBDW Architects, Mancini Duffy, and Perkins Eastman and developed by L&L Holding Company, Maefield Development, and Fortress Investment Group, the 470-foot-tall structure will yield 550,000 square feet at the corner of Seventh Avenue and West 47th Street. The project involved the nearly full demolition of the former DoubleTree Suites by Hilton and the full restoration and 30-foot lifting of Kirchoff & Rose’s 1,700-seat, 108-year-old Palace Theater. Pavarini McGovern is in charge of construction for the property, which will feature ten floors of retail space and is slated to cost around $2.5 billion with a capacity to serve 15 million annual visitors.\n\nConstruction is nearing completion on 113 West 24th Street, a 39-story Marriott hotel located in the Midtown, Manhattan district of Chelsea. Designed by Stonehill & Taylor Architects and developed by Lam Generation, the 420-foot-tall reinforced concrete tower was last reported to yield 360 guest rooms, each averaging around 380 square feet apiece. Flintlock Construction Services, LLC is the general contractor for the project, which is located between Sixth and Seventh Avenues.\n\nPermits have been filed for a seven-story residential building conversion from an existing two-story garage at 415 West 45th Street in Hell’s Kitchen, Manhattan. Located between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, the interior lot is a short walk to the 42nd Street-Port Authority subway station, serviced by the A, C, and E trains. John Young of Emmut Properties Corp. is listed as the owner behind the applications."
