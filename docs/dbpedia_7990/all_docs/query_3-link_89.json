        "text": "1-Page Summary1-Page Book Summary of The Structure Of Scientific Revolutions\n\nThe Meaning of âStructureâ and âRevolutionâ\n\nMany people have the idea that science progresses in a linear fashionâa straightforward march from ignorance to knowledge. If that were true, then there would be no such thing as scientific revolutions; old ideas would never need to be overturned, only built upon.\n\nHowever, not only do scientific revolutions happen, they follow a specific pattern. The Structure of Scientific Revolutions lays out this pattern clearly and labels each part of it. The parts are:\n\nNormal science: The process of adding to existing knowledge through experiments and study.\n\nPuzzle-solving: Finding and fixing discrepancies in science as we currently understand it.\n\nParadigm: This is a difficult word to define, and the author himself used it in many different ways. However, a paradigm could be seen as a perfect example of an idea, which can be expanded into the framework of a whole field of scientific understanding. For example, think about the evolution of humans from a more ape-like ancestor. Using that paradigm, evolutionary biologists form the framework for all of their studies.\n\nAnomaly: Someone finds a discrepancy between the current paradigm and experimental results.\n\nCrisis: The discrepancy canât be resolved. Scientists loyal to the current paradigm try to dismiss it, while others try to show that the current paradigm is wrong.\n\nRevolution: The old paradigm is overthrown by new information, and eventually a new one takes its placeâa âparadigm shift.â\n\nThere have been many such revolutions in history that completely changed the way people understood and approached the world. There was a mathematical revolution when the Greeks created proofs to show not only that certain mathematical formulae and postulates work, but why they work. Classical science had a revolution when laboratories and experiments became the preferred way of examining the world, a practice that may have begun with Galileo.\n\nIn the 19th century, entire fields of science were codified and sorted into paradigms, including heat, light, and electricity. Phenomena that had baffled scientists could now be categorized and understood. This was around the time of the Industrial Revolution, and likely a direct cause of it. There have been more since then, including Einsteinâs theory of relativity and Planckâs first steps into quantum theory.\n\nRevolutions happen because science is not a straightforward path toward whatâs âtrue.â Itâs more like a path away from whatâs wrong.\n\nKarl Popperâs work could be seen as the precursor to this concept of scientific revolutions. Popper taught that scientists come up with broad, testable ideas, and almost inevitably prove them wrong. Then they refine their ideas based on the new information and try again. This cycle of conjectures and refutations is similar to the idea of scientific revolutions, just on a much smaller scale.\n\nâNormal Scienceâ Within a Paradigm\n\nThe everyday work of scientists could be called normal science. This is when they work within a...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Chapter 1: An Introduction to Structure\n\nOur current view of science is pulled mostly from textbooks and similar sources, the formal education we receive in school. However, these sources are like guidebooks or pamphlets for tourists, rather than accurate pictures of scientific history. As a result, some of our ideas about science are wrong.\n\nMany of those books imply that âscienceâ is only the theories and discoveries in the books themselves, rather than a huge assortment of different fields, ideas, and practices. Also, they often focus on experimental science (the so-called Scientific Method), but ignore the importance of connecting the results of those experiments to more general theories.\n\nIf our current ideas about science are true, then science is just the complete collection of knowledge we have about the world. In that case, scientific historians should be devoted to figuring out who made which contributions to that collectionâand, on the other hand, figuring out how and why so many mistakes and myths were wrongly added to it over the years.\n\nHowever, recently, people are finding that scientific history isnât a straight line from ignorance to knowledge like they thought. There are a few anomalies that...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Chapters 2-4: All About âNormal Scienceâ\n\nNormal science means study based on previous scientific knowledge. That knowledge is usually learned through textbooks and formal education, which outline the main questions of a field and the methods used to answer them. Before textbooks became common, the old classics like Aristotleâs Physica had much the same purpose.\n\nThese books became influential for two reasons: first, because they were remarkable enough to attract a loyal following at a time when many schools of thought were competing with each other; second, because they left a lot of questions and unsolved problemsâpuzzles for their followers to solve.\n\nScientific discoveries that have those two characteristics become paradigms: They are perfect examples of their fields, and a lot of information can be extrapolated from them. Paradigms are at the heart of normal science. They are the models that future experiments and theories are based on. This is why we use phrases like Newtonian physics: physics based on the paradigm of Newtonâs discoveries.\n\nStudents prepare for their work in chosen scientific communities by studying paradigms. Physicists, for example, would study Newtonâs work and how to apply his...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Chapters 5-6: Paradigms, Anomalies, and Discoveries\n\nWhile historians can generally find the paradigms of a given community fairly easily, finding the specific rules that community followed is often much harder. For one thing, scientists may follow the same paradigm, but disagree on how to interpret it. Also, like professionals in any field, scientists have experience and knowledge that they either donât communicate clearly or donât realize others lack. Therefore, historians sometimes donât recognize or understand the rules of the time because theyâre couched in unfamiliar terms and assumptions.\n\nFinally, just because there is a paradigm doesnât mean that there is necessarily a set of rules to go with it. Sometimes historians are looking for something that simply isnât there. However, even when paradigms lack specific rules, they can still restrict the scientific field by guiding the work.\n\nTo illustrate this point, consider a question asked by the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. He wondered how we know to apply terms like âchair,â or âgame,â to something weâve never seen before.\n\nThe brief version of the answer is that we apply those terms to things that resemble other things we know by those names. For example, if...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Chapters 7-9: How Crises Lead to Revolutions\n\nIf recognizing anomalies is a key part of new discoveries, it shouldnât be surprising that itâs also part of inventing theoriesâremember that discovering new facts and developing new theories are closely related processes. That whole process is key to scientific revolutions.\n\nThis isnât to say that normal science never solves anomaliesâin fact, thatâs one of its major functions. This is part of the reason paradigms are so hard to change: Scientists often assure themselves that there is a solution within the paradigm, it just hasnât been found yet. Of course, this isnât always the case.\n\nOn the very rare occasions that a field answers every question posed, such as the paradigm that has light traveling in the form of rays, that field stops being science and becomes an engineering tool. However, when those anomalies last long enough or reject some key part of the paradigm, it could be said that the fields they pertain to are in crisis.\n\nIn other words, an anomaly must seem like something more than a regular puzzle of normal science. Scientists in those fields have a growing awareness that something is fundamentally wrong, that nature is in direct conflict with their...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Chapter 10-11: Changing Paradigms, Changing World\n\nWhen paradigms change, it could be said that the entire world changes with them. Scientists ask different questions, follow different rules, and even use different terms (or use the same terms differently) after a paradigm change. Perhaps even more importantly, they see new information in studies theyâve done before.\n\nThis process resembles a gestalt shift. In psychology, a gestalt shift is when your perception of something suddenly changesâlike a picture that you can see as either a rabbit or a duck (but never both at once).\n\nHowever, there are important differences between a simple gestalt shift and a scientific revolution. Gestalt shifts can go either wayâfrom duck to rabbit or rabbit to duck, and back again. The subject can even learn to make the switch at will. On the other hand, scientific revolutions generally go one way, and they are irreversible. A scientist who now views the world through a Copernican paradigm can never go back to Ptolemy. A period when scientific perceptions can switch back and forth is, by definition, a crisis.\n\nIn a gestalt shift, such as with the picture which could be seen as a duck or a rabbit, either interpretation is correctâor at...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Chapter 12: Verifying a New Paradigm\n\nAny new paradigm starts with one or, at most, a few people. These people usually have two things in common. First, they have focused their work on the anomalies that led to the current crisis. Second, they are young, or at least new to the field, and so are less set in the current methods and rules than their colleagues.\n\nThe challenge then becomes convincing the rest of the scientific community to adopt their new paradigm. Therefore, the two (or more) paradigms must now be compared both against nature and against each other.\n\nPositive Verification\n\nItâs impossible to test a paradigm in every way, under every circumstance. Therefore, many scientists would say that convincing the community to adopt a new paradigm isnât about proving beyond doubt that itâs correct; instead itâs about showing that, given the available evidence, it is more likely to be correct than the other options.\n\nThis is called positive verification, and it offers a couple of testing methods. One way is to compare the paradigm or paradigms in question against all conceivable ones that explain the same data. Another is to come up with tests that the paradigm might reasonably be expected to...\n\nThe Structure Of Scientific Revolutions Summary Introductory Essay by Ian Hacking\n\n(Shortform note: This essay is included as a preface to Structure in the 2012 edition, but its author suggests saving it until after youâve read Kuhnâs book.)\n\nThis introductory essay by Ian Hacking discusses how and why The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was written, its impact on the scientific community, and whether itâs still relevant today (Shortform note: The first edition of Structure was published in 1962).\n\nThe sciences have changed a lot since Structure was first published. In 1962, physics was in the spotlight. It was the middle of the Cold War, so everyone had nuclear weapons on their minds. In fact, Kuhn himself was trained as a physicist.\n\nToday, however, biotechnology is the hot field of science. On top of that, modern technology like computer simulations and the internet has changed how science is practiced and how ideas are shared.\n\nAnother major change since Structure was written has to do with fundamental physics itself. In 1962, physics had two major competing models of the universe: steady state and the Big Bang theory. By 2012, only the Big Bang..."
