For instance, almost all the great discoveries are accidental b/c we don't have enough brains to come up w/ something like this. Just like that, I always end up finding more knowledge by accident. Please help me here b/c I am depressed but how can I find knowledge by myself? Is there an organized way? Is there such a thing as the art of finding knowledge?\n\nIf I understand you correctly, you are depressed because many great discoveries occur by accident, and that makes you feel like humans are insignificant? ... if I this is the case I can say that, while some discoveries and achievements have been catalyzed by accidental findings, it's still up to the human brain to decide what to do with those accidental findings... after the \"accident,\" there's a lot of hard work from the human to try and put the accident to good use.\n\nhuman have observed things falling for hundreds of thousands of years. they've also observed the stars flying around in circles in the sky for just as long. but it took one human brain to put those two pieces together and discover the laws of gravitation.\n\nmaybe that eureka moment was brought on by an accident, but it was the power of human reasoning that gave meaning to that accident. your cat won't understand how the stars move no matter how many apples you throw at it... try it; it's fun!\n\nSkhandelwal said:\n\nHi all, I tried to be really dedicated to my discovery on finding knowledge...but somehow, the more I find it...the more I realize how much I am missing out on it.

According to Kuhn, normal science is essentially a process of dogmatic puzzle-solving, but there's no shame in that, because it's puzzle-solving and the unearthing of anomalies that pushes science towards revolutions."
