        "text": "There is a congenial way in which Éric Rohmer’s films bond to our experiences of everyday life. They capture the vertices of human encounter—a chance meeting that leads to the beautiful and pure friendship; a long, meandering walk down a boulevard between quarreling lovers—with such lucidity and specificity that, to describe something as Rohmerian is to conjure up a constellation of attitudes about freedom, pleasure, and morality, and standards of realism and introspection as represented by not only the unforgettable characters in his films but also the mode his films were made in. These films synthesize with our own lived experiences and color the way we approach new life encounters.\n\nSo it felt like a perfectly Rohmerian moment when, upon an early trip to Paris a friend offered an introduction to one of Rohmer’s closest collaborators, Mary Stephen. I knew nothing else about her except that she had been his longtime editor, co-composer, and that she was known for hosting the best Chinese New Year dinners. The woman I met—a brilliant multilingual Chinese Canadian émigré full of profundities and stories—had been, along with actress Marie Rivière, a main spokesperson for Rohmer at festivals and screenings even before his passing, owing to his emphasis on privacy. Now she travels the world and works as mentor and editor to an ever-growing array of established and up-and-coming international filmmakers, amassing a tremendous body of work that includes Blind Mountain (Li Yang, 2007), Last Train Home (Lixin Fan, 2009), The Swaying Waterlily (Seren Yüce, 2016), and, most recently, Love After Love (Ann Hui, 2020). Mary’s friendship has given me a precious glimpse into not only the profound inner workings of Rohmer’s productions but also the extensive influence of these films on contemporary filmmaking generations on, as reified by her own prolific career.\n\nTO BEGIN, I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT YOUR BACKGROUND. WHAT WAS YOUR CHILDHOOD LIKE?\n\nI was born in Hong Kong to a family of five children. My parents had a company selling construction materials in the postwar years, with stores on both the Hong Kong and Kowloon sides. They came from modest beginnings: my mother was a schoolteacher; my father had done many odd jobs in his youth, including construction work.\n\nI spent my childhood in a large old-style flat near the famous Tiger Balm Garden. My maternal grandmother, who had been a concubine for my mother’s father, also lived with us. She died when I was about 10. I remember my mother saying that she was a woman who “never had a day of happiness.” Sadly, our old house was destined to be demolished to make way for a high-rise.\n\nHOW DID YOU FIRST FORM AN INTEREST IN CINEMA?\n\nThe first film in my memory was a Hitchcock suspense-thriller. In those days, there were no age limits in cinemas, so my parents would take us to anything. I also started contributing to local newspapers, principally the Hong Kong Chinese Students Weekly, where I learned about the French New Wave. Cinema scholar Law Kar—the movie page editor at the time and still my mentor now—introduced films like The 400 Blows, Jules and Jim, Hiroshima Mon Amour, and Sundays and Cybèle.\n\nWhen I was 15, my mother traveled to Canada to visit my older brother and sister, who were there studying. She asked my father to take me and my younger sister out to keep us entertained. I requested Blow-Up, which my father sat through approvingly, nodding like a connoisseur, until Vanessa Redgrave took off her shirt and came toward the camera with bare breasts. He didn’t say a word after that and never let me choose a Sunday film again!\n\nI also started going to film-club screenings frequented by the same university students of the newspaper. From then on, I had only one desire: to go to Paris.\n\nBUT FIRST YOU MOVED TO MONTREAL.\n\nMy mother’s trip to Canada was prolonged because unrest in Hong Kong began in 1967. We spent a year in Hong Kong with my father who was no fun for adolescent girls, so I explored the south side of Hong Kong alone and took French lessons behind his back. Then the whole family began life as newly landed immigrants. My English was good thanks to lots of solitary reading, but this first year in a new country was difficult. I was discriminated against, and refused to go to school for days.\n\nAfter showing aptitude in the subject, I went into a math program at Acadia University, but it quickly became clear that this was not the path for me. So I took art classes and started to think about the next step. I saw movement in all the still images from these classes. By the second year, I was majoring in Film.\n\nTo this date, I apply my really good professors’ teachings to my editing and storytelling processes. The great, late collector of Hollywood star photography John Kobal taught a class on Hollywood musicals and subsequently became a regular correspondent and friend. Later, an encounter with him in London put me in the path of Mathieu Carrière and Jeanne Moreau, for my film project Night Fires, which was never successfully funded.\n\nWHAT PRECIPITATED YOUR FIRST TRIP TO PARIS?\n\nI often felt stifled in Montreal. Artistic pursuits were frowned upon in our family, but in my third or fourth year in Canada, my mother took me and my younger sister on a trip to Paris and London in an effort to give us some sort of a “cosmopolitan” education. I finally felt liberated driving by the bookstores and art galleries and vowed then and there to come back to Paris.\n\nAfter graduation from Loyola [the year it became Concordia], I lingered in Montreal, not sure what to do with my life. I had a Canada Council grant to make a film traveling across the country with the other hitchhiking youth, but then my mother passed away, and I made a short film about that for my family. I enrolled in a yearlong master’s program at the University of Wisconsin, but it was one of those study-abroad programs, so my partner John Cressey—a photographer with his own Paris dream inspired by Brassaï—and I sold everything and took off to Paris. I knew in my heart that I would never return.\n\nHOW DID YOU INITIALLY FIND PARIS AS A STUDENT? WHAT WAS YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIKE?\n\nFor the first month we had French-language lessons at Reid Hall in Montparnasse. I quickly realized that the French classes I had been taking in Montreal were not enough to deal with daily life in Paris. At Reid Hall we learned about argots, or slang, using Godard’s Breathless. Who would have thought that just a couple of years later, I’d be working as the assistant of that film’s legendary editor?\n\nWith my new friend Ann Martin, I went to about five screenings a day. I discovered a tiny cinema at Maubert Mutualité, where a little film by Marguerite Duras called India Song was playing. I must have seen the film a dozen times. I was blown away by the images and soundtrack, the suggested ambiance of a hot and humid southeast Asia, the melodrama expressed in such an abstract and experimental way. I immediately wanted to make my own version of India Song—a “contrechamp” from the Asian woman’s point of view instead of Duras’s white colonial protagonist’s\n\nTELL ME ABOUT YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH LES FILMS DU LOSANGE AND ÉRIC ROHMER.\n\nI dropped out of the Wisconsin program in time to get a refund and started writing a short script. But having a script was not enough—we needed a budget as well. In this university program mainly focused on Semiology, we were allowed to audit all of Paris University’s courses, and someone found a weekly three-hour class at the Institut de l’art et l’archéologie, given by Eric Rohmer, so we all went. It turns out Rohmer was using a film he was preparing at the time, Perceval le Gallois [1978] to teach students how to create budgets.\n\nIn order to get a sample budget, I went to Les Films du Losange to see Mr. Rohmer. The secretary didn’t let me through, but she made a note. As I reached the door, I heard the phone ringing. It was Rohmer saying more or less that if I wanted to see a sample budget, I should make my way back to the office.\n\nUPON THAT FIRST MEETING AT LOSANGE, WHAT DID YOU KNOW OF ROHMER? HAD YOU SEEN HIS FILMS?\n\nI knew that Rohmer was one of the first cineastes of the French New Wave. In Montreal, there was an ongoing show of his films at the Outremont Repertory Cinema, but I never went. I saw The Marquise of O when I arrived in Paris. My French New Wave idols were Truffaut and Resnais, and my dream had been to meet them in Paris. Somehow, I never ended up meeting either.\n\nWHAT DID YOU DISCUSS AT THAT FIRST MEETING AND WHAT TRANSPIRED AFTER THAT?\n\nWhen I got back to Losange, Rohmer was with Fabrice Luchini. I was not fluent in French, and very shy. Éric served us tea, and his usual little biscuits. Fabrice was rehearsing lines in medieval French for his role in Perceval le Gallois.\n\nIt turned out they were meeting that night to go watch Suzanne Flon in a play, as Rohmer was thinking of her for the role of Perceval’s mother. He asked if I wanted to come. It was at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées, which is just a stone’s throw away from Rohmer’s office. As we walked, he talked to me about the architecture and history of the buildings we passed. Soon, this became a ritual: I would spend lots and lots of afternoons in Rohmer’s office. He would often say that I was the only person who could drink more tea than him.\n\nDID YOU EVENTUALLY TALK TO ROHMER ABOUT YOUR FILM PROJECTS?\n\nYes, definitely, all through the early years. When he knew me as a student, I was already making my first feature, Ombres de soie [1978]. For this low-budget film, we used a discounted editing room off the Champs-Elysées, mostly used for dubbing porno films. Rohmer came to watch the process as he was interested in outside-the-box forms of indie filmmaking. Later on, he used my VHS of India Song to teach economical filmmaking. This way of thinking influences me to this day. I think younger generations of filmmakers are fans of Rohmer’s cinema not only because of the content and form but also the method.\n\nWHEN AND HOW DID YOU FIRST BEGIN WORKING WITH ROHMER ON HIS FILMS?\n\nAfter Ombres de soie, I wanted to stay in Paris and needed money, but I didn’t have a working permit. Rohmer asked if I would be Cécile Decugis’s assistant on The Aviator’s Wife, despite already having directed two films of my own. Cécile edited many New Wave classics, including for Godard and Truffaut. I obviously didn’t say no. Rohmer warned me that Cécile was very tough with her assistants and always made them cry. I said that was okay.\n\nSo I started working with Cécile as assistant. Not only did she never make me cry, we became good friends. We had dinner often, and she consoled me when I had heartaches. I don’t know what it is that bonded us. It could have been that I was a stranger in a strange town. She had a rich secret life that she never talked about: she was a fighter for the Algerian liberation movement and was involved in it so actively to the point of going to prison. She would tell me stories about Rohmer—or rather her own opinion of him. They had a straight working relationship, very different than what we had at the office. Though at first I might have been considered one of the “Rohmer girls” that he imposed on his editor, she very quickly adopted me. That’s how I started a working life in the Rohmer circle.\n\nAfter that, I worked a little on the next two films, Le Beau Mariage [1982] and Pauline at the Beach [1983]. Then, I left for the south for personal reasons. When I came back to Paris seven and a half years later, Rohmer was the first to come to my rescue. By then, Cécile had retired, and Lisa [María Luisa García], who had edited several Rohmer films after Cécile’s retirement, was busy working on a film with her companion, Jean-Claude Brisseau. Rohmer knew that I needed work quickly, now on my own with three little kids to feed. He told his producer that I would edit his new project, A Tale of Winter [1992] without even telling me first. Of course, I was overjoyed, but I hadn’t touched an editing table for over seven years. I had to relearn everything."
