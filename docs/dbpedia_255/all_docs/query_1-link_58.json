        "text": "K2 Studios specializes in producing visually-stunning, inspiring and educational large format films for IMAX® and giant screens. As film production in the giant screen format evolves, we evolve with it. K2 produces and co-produces documentary films, with end-to-end oversight from treatment, film financing, strategic partnerships, to the filmmaking itself.\n\nK2 works with the leading directors in the industry. Directors such as Stephen Low and Mark Krenzien have directed some of K2’s industry leading films, such as Low’s Fighter Pilot (one of the longest running films in the industry) and Krenzien’s Journey to Space, the highest grossing giant screen film of 2016.\n\nLarge format films, traditionally captured on 15/70mm film, boast nearly 10 times the image resolution of standard 35mm films that are projected in normal neighborhood cinemas. This allows for an exceptionally large projected image size while maintaining unmatched clarity and depth of field.\n\nWe capture content that is ready for giant screen theatrical exhibition. Because our films are captured on the largest formats available, we are then able to scale our projects down to create digital 4K programming with the most vivid imagery. Additionally, we produce 3D content using the latest 3D stereo cameras, and by using state-of-the-art post-conversion technology.\n\n​K2’s content capabilities have expanded to include multiple formats, including TV and online media. With a consistently impactful reach across multiple channels, K2 delivers unique storytelling ability with unrivaled production expertise.\n\nK2 content is looking to expand content production to include VR, AR, and Mixed Reality as well, as exciting new ways to engage and impact audiences. Contact us directly to learn more about our content development and partnerships.\n\nTHE WONDERFUL WORLD OF ELEPHANTS\n\nThe Wonderful World of Elephants 3D is an epic journey across Africa, Asia and Australia, getting up close and personal with the largest land mammals on the planet. Elephants are symbols of strength, power and wisdom, and they have captured our imaginations for centuries.\n\nSadly, most of the world’s elephants could disappear from much of the wild within a generation. Climate change, habitat loss, human conflict, hunting and poaching have devastated elephant populations, estimated to be down from 1.2 million in the 1970’s to around 500,000 today. But who are these species, how have they adapted to their unique ecosystems, and why must we protect them?\n\nThe film traverses the vast plains and rich rainforests of Africa that are home to the savannah and desert elephants, to the grasslands of South East Asia and the Indian Elephants that live there, and finally, to Melbourne Zoo in Australia. It's in Australia that we meet Luk Chai, the elephant who is helping to secure the genetic future of his species.\n\nThe Wonderful World of Elephants 3D is not just an insight into the elephants themselves but the incredible and diverse environments they inhabit and the people protecting them and the future of their species."
