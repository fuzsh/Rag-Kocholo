        "text": "My partner and I have sponsored a gay Venezuelan refugee. We finally received news that his application in Canada was accepted! With this news of his imminent arrival to Canada, my partner, the refugee, and I need help raising funds that will allow him to settle in Canada. The news that his application for asylum was accepted comes after years of delay, complications, and bureaucratic error that have cost us both financially and emotionally. Along with the delays caused by the pandemic, the application for asylum for this young man that was submitted in July 2019 was wrongfully rejected in 2020. Despite the fact that the young gay man we sponsored was clearly escaping homophobia and the worst humanitarian crisis outside of the world in the past hundred years in Venezuela (according to the New York Times), the Canadian Visa Officer deemed he was merely experiencing discrimination and not persecution which put his life at risk. This error on the part of the Canadian government meant that we had to use the funds that we had raised thus far to pay for a lawyer to represent our case at the Federal Court. We paid over $11,000 to correct the error made by the Government. After that case was settled (the Department of Justice agreed that the error of the Visa Officer was egregious), we finally received notice, after months of delay, that the refugee will be granted asylum in Canada. This was the good news we have been waiting years to receive! Now that his arrival is imminent, we need help raising the remaining $10,000 required to fund his first year in Canada. (The sponsors of every privately sponsored refugee must raise $18,000 to fund the refugee's first year in Canada. Each privately sponsored refugee is sponsored by individuals and a Sponsorship Agreement Holder organization, which in our case is the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto.)
