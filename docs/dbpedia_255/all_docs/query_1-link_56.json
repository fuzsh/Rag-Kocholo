        "text": "IMAX Films Made by Latter-day Saints\n\nLatter-day Saints have had an unusually large role in the development of the IMAX/70mm film industry. One reason for this is that IMAX films have traditionally been relatively positive, life-affirming, and family-friendly. Certain Latter-day Saint filmmakers were unwilling to work on films which they felt promoted violence, materialism, profanity and otherwise objectional material, but they found what they considered an oasis of filmmaking opportunities in the scientific, geographical and cultural themes of IMAX films.\n\nThe passion and artistry these filmmakers brought to their IMAX film topics (which some Hollywood directors considered too benign or tame to be of interest) continued to earn these Utah-based and Latter-day Saint filmmakers opportunities to work on the what are, literally, the world's largest films."
