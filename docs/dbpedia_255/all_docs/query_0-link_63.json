        "text": "Joined SWS 2018\n\nJohn has been and continues to be an advocate for supplementary and continued education through the world of open online courses. His interests are broad and plenty, but his heart gravitates toward math and science. John also cultivates an active interest in world travel, cultures, and languages, as he continues to refine his Japanese and Spanish language skills.\n\nWith a BS in Exercise Biology from University of California, Davis, John spends his free time playing basketball and baseball, long-distance running, and pursuing art, hiking, and camping (with a special emphasis on America’s National Parks) He lives in Sacramento with his wife and is enjoying every minute of raising a puppy.\n\nJoined SWS in 2022\n\nMichelle Gallardo (she, her) was born into a family of renowned artists in Guatemala, surrounded by beautiful art and given the freedom to play with art materials and ideas. Her creativity and imagination were always encouraged.\n\nHer work as an art teacher for High School students began with creating a space for students to enjoy art and feel safe and seen. Michelle's goal is to create opportunities for students to give voice to their struggles and invite them to shine their light. She says, \"As artists, we not only develop our technique but also learn to observe. Through that process, we open ourselves to colors, shapes, gestures, and qualities and thus realize we are connected to the whole world. We suddenly see beauty and harmony around us. I believe each person has the whole universe inside them and art is one way to discover that, as an inner process. Art is also a perfect way to express our voices and connect to others and the world.\"\n\nMichelle studied Political Science in university but ultimately chose dance as her path. She opened a dance academy, where she developed a program to coach students through an alchemical creative dance process that included inner work, choreography, costume design, and dance technique, culminating in a final presentation. She later worked at the Waldorf School of Guatemala, where she taught movement class for several years before being invited to develop and teach an Arts program for the entire high school, from eighth through twelfth grades. Michelle deeply identifies with Waldorf education and loves studying Anthroposophy.\n\nJoined SWS 2011\n\nMelissa’s (she, her) career began as an exhibition designer for museums in California and New Mexico and evolved into curatorial writing for art catalogues and books. She has been published as an art writer and critic in magazines and newspapers.\n\nMelissa has a BS in Environmental Design and Comparative Literature from University of California, Davis. She found Waldorf education at the Santa Fe Waldorf School, where she and her eldest daughter (who graduated from Sacramento Waldorf School in 2015) attended a parent-child class. When her family moved to Denver, they purchased a house two blocks from the magic that was Denver Waldorf School, and she was hired as a substitute teacher. Melissa was a class teacher at Davis Waldorf School before coming to Sacramento Waldorf School in 2011.\n\nJoined SWS 2012\n\nJacob (he, him) teaches mathematics and Music History in the high school, and is director of the high school orchestra.

S. Bach to Thelonious Monk, build geometric models, and go for bike rides along the American River.\n\nJoined SWS 2022\n\nMs. Kelly’s (she, her) teaching philosophy centers on recognizing the unique abilities of each student: to see and hear them deeply, help them develop empathy and a strong moral compass, and experience the joys of the creative process. She chooses to teach at a Waldorf School because she appreciates working in an environment that encourages the development of the whole person and values the arts. In her teaching, Ms. Kelly draws on her understanding that it is critically important in this historical moment to maintain an embodied connection with each other and the physical world, as our society seems to be losing these connections. She maintains and continues to develop an engaging, lively, and meaningful drama program at Sacramento Waldorf School.\n\nAs a child, Ms. Kelly’s parents and educators taught her about civil rights movements; she was inspired by the idea of the arc of history bending toward justice. As an educator in New York City colleges and public schools, she worked primarily with students of color and immigrant students.\n\nMs. Kelly holds an MFA in Theater from Sarah Lawrence College, an MS in Education, TESOL, from City College at the City University of New York, a Graduate Certificate in Theater from UC Santa Cruz, and a BA in International Development Studies and Dramatic Art/Dance from UC Berkeley.

She loves that her profession is never static, always evolving. She was drawn to Waldorf education out of a desire to find a connection between student and teacher, and a way to encourage the unique gifts of every student. She says, “I love being in constant dialogue with my students as it sparks new ideas within all of us.”\n\nMarcella teaches German in Ninth through Twelfth Grade.

He also leads the Sacramento Waldorf School mountain biking team.\n\nDoug appreciates the ability of students and teachers alike to thrive in a Waldorf school as it is founded in respect for the profound journey that life presents. He believes teaching requires a good sense of humor and a solid sense of organization, matched with the enthusiasm to push students lovingly into the unknown.\n\nWith a BA in Humanities from California State University, Chico, and a Diploma in Literary Studies from University of Wales, Doug completed his Waldorf Teacher Training Certificate through the Waldorf Teacher Education program in Eugene, OR.\n\nA Sacramento resident, he lives with his wife, Christina; their three amazing children, Skylar, Tenaya, and Rowan, all graduated from SWS.

She teaches American Literature, Architecture, Modern Novel, Parzival, Sacred Texts of the World, US History, and World Cultures – a range of classes that explore the diversity of human experience. She chooses to teach in a Waldorf school because she enjoys working in an educational environment that strives to meet the full potential and dignity of human beings.\n\nShe holds a BA in English, an MA in American Studies, both from the University of Timisoara, Romania, and a PhD in German Studies with an emphasis in Comparative Literature from the University of California, Irvine.

He teaches in Waldorf schools to empower future generations of creative change-makers through spirit, heart, and hands.

She chooses to teach in a Waldorf school because she wants to educate the whole human being and believes the study of humanities should not be about gaining particular skills but, rather, about exploring our values and what it means to be human.\n\nWith a BA in History and Literature from Harvard University and an MA and PhD in Russian Literature from Princeton University, Dunja obtained her Waldorf High School Teaching Certificate and Foundations in Anthroposophy and the Arts from Rudolf Steiner College. Before becoming a Waldorf teacher, she worked as an academic researcher and taught language and literature at the college level. Outside of school, she loves to explore the world's spiritual traditions and to engage in meditation.\n\nA Carmichael resident, Dunja is married to faculty member Jacob Hosler; their two children have attended Sacramento Waldorf School. Dunja’s interests include foreign languages, travel, knitting, and pondering.\n\nJoined SWS 2020\n\nVisnja Popovic (she/her) is as a former textile designer and business owner who has always felt the pull to share her love of art with children and young people. Visnja was drawn to Waldorf education because of its attachment to nature and focus on the tactile experience. She appreciates that Waldorf pedagogy is holistic, humane, and focused on human development.\n\nAs a first-generation immigrant from Serbia, Visnja knows how it feels to be an outsider. This experience informs her teaching philosophy, which focuses on bringing equity into the classroom and making sure students feel accepted in all their differences. Visnja loved her teacher as a child: in Serbian schools, like in Waldorf schools, children have the same teacher for several years. She felt a strong bond with this teacher, and their connection was meaningful. “My priority is to make the students feel accepted, respected, and comfortable in my classroom; the thing we are learning is second to establishing rapport with each individual as relevant and worthy.”\n\nVisnja has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Textiles from Rhode Island School of Design and a Master’s in Art Education from the Pratt Institute. She spent time in Ghana and South Africa studying printmaking and teaching. Before joining Sacramento Waldorf School, Visnja founded and ran The Textile Art Center in Brooklyn, a school, studio, and gallery space where Visnja ran a summer camp, after-school program, and an artist residency program. Weaving, screen printing and natural dyeing were a focus.\n\nVisnja lives in Fair Oaks with her daughter, a student at Sacramento Waldorf School. They share their home with various animals, including rabbits, parakeets, cats, dogs, and the occasional garden snake or pet slug.\n\nJoined SWS 2023\n\nRobin (she/her) has always been attracted to education and loves to share her enthusiasm and knowledge of the sciences with adolescents. She was drawn to Waldorf education and to SWS by the close community of a smaller school where each student can be seen and valued. She has loved getting to know her students and their questions.\n\nA current resident and neighbor to the SWS campus in Fair Oaks, Robin grew up in Louisiana just north of the lake from New Orleans. Her curiosity and passion for Biology, conservation, and scientific inquiry and was born there, and she followed those passions in her own education. Robin has a BS in Biological Sciences from Louisiana State University and PhD in Conservation Biology with a focus in Reproductive Physiology. Her dissertation research was conducted at the Audubon Center for Research of Endangered Species (ACRES).\n\nJoined SWS 2023\n\nMindy comes to SWS with many years of teaching in the Humanities and a wealth of experience and love for History, for writing, and for the stories we tell ourselves. “My mother was a principal and teacher for 30 years, and before that, ‘just’ a teacher. I spent my life watching and inspired by her and always knew I felt more alive in the classroom than anywhere else,” she says. “Also, kids make you a better version of yourself. I love having meaning in my life!”\n\nShe has a BA in American History and an Illinois certification in secondary education, specializing in Social Sciences from Northwestern University. Mindy also holds an MFA in Creative Writing from Lesley University and has written a memoir about her years teaching at a boarding school in Connecticut. She taught and developed Humanities curriculum in Chicago before relocating to the Sacramento area; most recently, she was a teacher at Shalom School teaching Fourth and Sixth Grade. The creativity teachers utilize in the classroom and the relationships that develop in a co-creative learning space are the key factors that brought Mindy to Waldorf education and what she enjoys about teaching at SWS.\n\nMindy speaks passionately about her Jewish heritage and openly shares with her students her family’s heritage and historical experiences as they relate to helping bring history and story to life in the classroom. As a descendent of Holocaust survivors, she was raised “learning this history, and it has translated into an intense need to make sure that today’s students are inoculated from prejudice, bigotry, and the other collateral damage that comes from peer pressure, obedience to authority, and blind conformity,” she says. “I am grateful every day that I live in a democracy and believe that democracy is not a finished product. It’s an evolving story. If that story is not safeguarded vigilantly, it will disappear. So, as a teacher, it’s my job to help my students be the vanguards.”\n\nJoined SWS 1984\n\nSince joining SWS in 1984, Dean has helped build our sports program into a successful and important part of school life. As a basketball coach, he has amassed 17 championships over his decades-long career.

She loves to read, take walks, garden, and visit Australia.\n\n“I have the great privilege of teaching students from Sixth Grade to Twelfth Grade. During these years, I see tremendous growth and change,” Megan says. “The child who sits in front of me in Sixth Grade will unfold as they move toward young adulthood. Every child that sits in my classroom deserves my utmost respect. I do not yet know who they will become. As an adult, they will more likely be more intelligent, more courageous, more brilliant than me.”\n\nJoined SWS 2020\n\nNina’s passion for teaching stems from her love of learning new things, and that passion is continuously strengthened by inspiring others to learn. She enjoys challenging her students to discover the world around them through phenomena-based interactions. She believes that curiosity about the world is an important tool for fostering learning not only in science, but also outside of the science classroom.\n\nShe has a Bachelor of Science in Physics from the University of the Pacific and a Preliminary Single Subject Teaching Credential in the subject of Physics from California State University, Sacramento. She has a passion for the sciences and math and is excited to share that passion with others.\n\nShe lives in Roseville with her husband, cat, and two adorably rambunctious Australian Shepherds.
