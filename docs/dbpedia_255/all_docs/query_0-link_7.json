        "text": "David Cronenberg, also known as the King of Venereal Horror or the Baron of Blood, was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in 1943. His father, Milton Cronenberg, was a journalist and editor, and his mother, Esther (Sumberg), was a piano player. After showing an inclination for literature at an early age (he wrote and published eerie short stories, thus following his father's path) and for music (playing classical guitar until he was 12), Cronenberg graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Literature after switching from the science department. He reached the cult status of horror-meister with the gore-filled, modern-vampire variations of Parasiten-Mörder (1975) and Rabid - Der brüllende Tod (1977), following an experimental apprenticeship in independent film-making and in Canadian television programs.\n\nCronenberg gained popularity with the head-exploding, telepathy-based Scanners - Ihre Gedanken können töten (1981) after the release of the much underrated, controversial, and autobiographical Die Brut (1979). Cronenberg become a sort of a mass media guru with Videodrome (1983), a shocking investigation of the hazards of reality-morphing television and a prophetic critique of contemporary aesthetics. The issues of tech-induced mutation of the human body and topics of the prominent dichotomy between body and mind were back again in Dead Zone: Der Attentäter (1983) and Die Fliege (1986), both bright examples of a personal film-making identity, even if both films are based on mass-entertainment materials: the first being a rendition of a Stephen King best-seller, the latter a remake of a famous American horror movie.\n\nWith Die Unzertrennlichen (1988) and Naked Lunch (1991), the Canadian director, no more a mere genre movie-maker but a fully realized auteur, got the acclaim of international critics. Such profound statements on modern humanity and ever-changing society are prominent in the provocative Crash (1996) and in the virtual reality essay of eXistenZ (1999), both of which well fared at the Cannes and Berlin Film Festivals. In the last two film projects Spider (2002) and A History of Violence (2005), Cronenberg avoids expressing his teratologic and oneiric expressionism in favor of a more psychological exploration of human contradictions and idiosyncrasies.\n\nOne of Québec's most politically aware filmmakers, Denys Arcand studied history at Université de Montréal, where he co-directed Seul ou avec d'autres (1962) with Denis Héroux and co-written with Stéphane Venne. He joined the National Film Board (NFB) in 1963, where his feature-length documentary on the textile industry, On est au coton (1970), was so controversial it was suppressed for 6 years. He made another fine documentary, Québec: Duplessis et après... (1972), before leaving the NFB for the private sector. Dreckiges Geld (1972), Réjeanne Padovani (1973) and Gina (1975) were distinctive views of Québec society, original and provocative. All 3 used the gangster film as a source while distorting many of its conventions. He then moved to TV, scripting the Duplessis (1978) series for Radio-Canada and directing 3 episodes of Empire, Inc. (1983). He returned to the NFB to make a documentary on the 1980 referendum, Le confort et l'indifférence (1982), which revealed growing cynicism about the political process. It won the Québec Critics Prize.\n\nHe returned to commercial filmmaking after a hiatus of 10 years with Le crime d'Ovide Plouffe (1984), before achieving major success with the scathing comedy about sexual mores, Der Untergang des amerikanischen Imperiums (1986) (The Decline of the American Empire), a film that won numerous prizes, including the prestigious Critic's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. The New York Film Critics voted it Best Foreign Film in 1986 and it won Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay at the 1987 Genies. It was also nominated as Best Foreign Film by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. Jesus von Montreal (1989) confirmed Arcand's international reputation, winning the Jury prize at the Cannes Film Festival. It won 10 Genies, including Best Picture and Director, and was nominated in the Best Foreign Film category by the Academy. Arcand then moved into English-language production in an attempt to break into a larger international market. Liebe und andere Grausamkeiten (1993), his first feature in English, was followed by Stardom (2000), a film that looked at the world of fashion. Neither achieved the subtlety and texture of his earlier work.\n\nThe overwhelming success of Die Invasion der Barbaren (2003), which marked both a return to the French language and to the characters who had peopled Der Untergang des amerikanischen Imperiums (1986), showed that Arcand had lost none of his powers of observation. The film won two awards at the Cannes Film Festival (best screenplay, and best actor for Marie-Josée Croze), Best Canadian Feature Film at the Toronto International Film Festival and the prestigious Oscar for Best Foreign Film. In 2005 Arcand was named Companion of the Order of Canada, which recognizes individuals for exceptional achievements of national or international significance.\n\nJames Francis Cameron was born on August 16, 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada. He moved to the United States in 1971. The son of an engineer, he majored in physics at California State University before switching to English, and eventually dropping out. He then drove a truck to support his screenwriting ambition. He landed his first professional film job as art director, miniature-set builder, and process-projection supervisor on Roger Corman's Sador: Herrscher im Weltraum (1980) and had his first experience as a director with a two week stint on Fliegende Killer - Piranha II (1982) before being fired.\n\nHe then wrote and directed Terminator (1984), a futuristic action-thriller starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Biehn and Linda Hamilton. It was a low budget independent film, but Cameron's superb, dynamic direction made it a surprise mainstream success and it is now regarded as one of the most iconic pictures of the 1980s. After this came a string of successful, bigger budget science-fiction action films such as Aliens: Die Rückkehr (1986), Abyss - Abgrund des Todes (1989) and Terminator 2: Tag der Abrechnung (1991). In 1990, Cameron formed his own production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. In 1997, he wrote and directed Titanic (1997), a romance epic about two young lovers from different social classes who meet on board the famous ship. The movie went on to break all box office records and earned eleven Academy Awards. It became the highest grossing movie of all time until 12 years later, Avatar - Aufbruch nach Pandora (2009), which invented and pioneered 3D film technology, and it went on to beat \"Titanic\", and became the first film to cost two billion dollars until 2019 when Marvel took the record.\n\nJames Cameron is now one of the most sought-after directors in Hollywood. He was formerly married to producer Gale Anne Hurd, who produced several of his films. In 2000, he married actress Suzy Amis, who appeared in Titanic, and they have three children.\n\nNorman Jewison was an award-winning, internationally acclaimed filmmaker who produced and directed some of the world's most memorable, entertaining and socially important films, exploring controversial and complicated subjects and giving them a universal accessibility. Some of his most well-known works include the pre-glasnost political satire The Russians Are Coming, The Russians Are Coming, the original The Thomas Crown Affair, the groundbreaking civil rights-era drama In the Heat of the Night (winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Picture), the first rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar, the futuristic cult hit Rollerball, hit musical comedy-drama Fiddler on the Roof, the romantic comedy Moonstruck, the courtroom drama ...And Justice For All, the military drama A Soldier's Story, the labor movement picture F.I.S.T., the war dramas The Statement and In Country, and the masterfully told story of Reuben 'Hurricane' Carter, The Hurricane, among many others.\n\nJewison was personally nominated for four Oscars and received three Emmy Awards; his films received 46 nominations and won 12 Academy Awards. In 1999, Jewison received the prestigious Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award at the Academy Awards.\n\nIn Canada, his life's work has been recognized with the Governor General's Performing Arts Award, and he was named a Member of the Order of Canada, an Officer of the Order of Ontario and a Companion of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour. In 2010, Jewison was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America.\n\nJewison was committed to advancing the art of storytelling and filmmaking, both through his groundbreaking films, and through his creation of the Canadian Film Centre (CFC) in 1986, which opened its doors in Toronto in 1988. The CFC is a charitable cultural organization which drives the future of Canadian storytelling.\n\nCanadian producer and director Ivan Reitman created many of American cinema's most successful and best loved feature film comedies and worked with Hollywood's acting elite. Reitman produced such hits as the ground-breaking sensation National Lampoon's Ich glaub', mich tritt ein Pferd (1978), which introduced John Belushi to American filmgoers, and the family features Ein Hund namens Beethoven (1992) and Eine Familie namens Beethoven (1993). His directing credits include Babyspeck und Fleischklösschen (1979), Ich glaub' mich knutscht ein Elch! (1981) and Ghostbusters - Die Geisterjäger (1984), films starring Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis; Dave (1993), which starred Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver, Junior (1994) which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danny DeVito and Emma Thompson. Reitman also produced the HBO telefilm The Late Shift - Spätvorstellung (1996), based on Bill Carter's non-fiction book about the late-night television wars which received seven Emmy nominations. Other producing endeavors include Commandments (1997), starring Aidan Quinn and Courteney Cox, Private Parts (1997), starring Howard Stern, as well as the animation/live action film Space Jam (1996), starring Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters. With Twins - Zwillinge (1988), Reitman created an entirely new comedic persona for action hero Arnold Schwarzenegger -- and forged a personal and professional relationship that continued with Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Acclaimed dramatic actors such as Robert Redford, Debra Winger, Sigourney Weaver, and Emma Thompson also revealed untapped comic talents under Reitman's direction. In 1984, Reitman was honored as Director of the Year by the National Association of Theater Owners and the next year received a Special Achievement Award at the Canadian Genie awards. In 1979 and again in 1989, for the films Ich glaub', mich tritt ein Pferd (1978) and Twins - Zwillinge (1988), Reitman was honored with the People's Choice Award. In November of 1994, Reitman became the third director honored by Variety magazine in a special Billion Dollar Director issue.\n\nReitman was born in Czechoslovakia, to Jewish Holocaust survivors, and left with his family for Canada at the age of four. He attended Canada's McMaster University, where he produced and directed several television shorts. He followed with a live television show, Greed (1999), with Dan Aykroyd as its announcer. \"Spellbound,\" which Reitman produced for the live stage, evolved into the Broadway hit \"The Magic Show,\" starring Doug Henning. He continued producing for the stage with the Off-Broadway hit \"The National Lampoon Show,\" and returned to Broadway to produce and direct the musical \"Merlin,\" earning a Tony nomination for directing. Reitman headed The Montecito Picture Company, a film and television production company, with partner Tom Pollock. His television credits included the Emmy-nominated children's show The Real Ghostbusters (1986) and the Saturday morning animated series Beethoven (1994) for CBS. His last directing credited was Draft Day - Tag der Entscheidung (2014), before his death in February 2022 in Montecito, California.\n\nFrançois Girard was born in Quebec in 1963. Best known for his movie writing and directing (Thirty-two Short Films About Glenn Gould, The red Violin, Silk...), Girard also directed a number of plays and operas including PARSIFAL at the Metropolitan Opera. He also wrote and directed two Cirque du Soleil shows; Zed and Zarkana.\n\nIn 1993, his feature film Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould would go on to garner international success including four top Genie Awards. Five years later he directed The Red Violin which received an Academy Award for best original score and enshrined Girard as an important player on the international movie scene. The film also won eight Genie Awards and nine Jutra Awards. SILK, which he directed, was adapted from Alessandro Baricco's best-selling book, and was released worldwide in 2007 and received four Jutra Awards.\n\nGirard's 1994 concert film Peter Gabriel's Secret World became a best selling film and earned him a Grammy Award. A few years later he directed one of the six episodes of the internationally acclaimed series Yo-yo Ma Inspired by Bach.\n\nIn 1997, François Girard made his opera directorial debut with Oedipus rex / Symphony of Psalms by Stravinsky and Cocteau which received numerous awards and was named by The Guardian \"the best theatrical show of the year. Other opera works include Lost Objects for the Brooklyn Academy of Music; Wagner's Siegfried; the Flight of Lindbergh / Seven deadly Sins from Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht; as well as Kaija Saariaho's Émilie. His most recent opera work is Parsifal which earned him and the Metropolitan Opera Company a remarkable critical success.\n\nFor the stage, Girard also directed Alessandro Barrico's Novecento; Kafka's Trial and Yasushi Inoue's Hunting Gun. He is currently working on a new production of Waiting for Godot.\n\nGirard is a three-time winner of the much-coveted Herald Angel Award for Best Production at the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nIn recent years, Cirque du Soleil's commissioned Girard to write and direct ZED, their first permanent show in Tokyo; and Zarkana which opened at Radio City Music Hall, played at the Kremlin Theatre and has become a resident show in Las Vegas.\n\nA distant relative of Herman and Joseph Mankiewicz, Francis was born in Shangaï in 1944. In 1945, his family moved to Montreal, where Francis would spend all his childhood. In the sixties, he graduated in Geology from Montreal University and worked in the woods for a while before realizing geology might not be his true calling. In 1966 he enrolled at the 'London School of Film Technique'. Back in Montréal in 1968, he worked as assistant director on commercial films like 'L'Amour humain' and 'Love is a four-letter word'.\n\nIn 1972, he directed his first fiction movie 'Le Temps d'une chasse', a character study based on his own screenplay and partly inspired by his days as geologist. The film was well received by critics and was presented at the Venice Film Festival. But it was only in 1978 that Mankiewicz directed his second picture 'Une Amie d'enfance', a dramatic comedy from a theater play by Louis Saïa and Louise Roy.\n\n1980 saw the release of his third film, 'Les Bons débarras', an original screenplay by maverick novelist Réjean Ducharme. As soon as it came out, the film was considered a milestone in Québécois cinema, a reputation that time hasn't tarnished. The film swept the Genie awards, taking eight trophees including best film and best director while actress Marie Tifo's interpretation of the main character won the Silver Hugo at Chicago Film Festival.\n\nOnce again written by Réjean Ducharme, Mankiewicz's next film, 'Les Beaux souvenirs' (1981), was eagerly awaited and shared obvious similarities with 'Les Bons débarras' in themes and approach. Unfortunately, while some critics expressed enthousiasm, the global reaction was lukewarm.\n\nBetween 1983 and 1985, Mankiewicz worked on an adaptation of Anne Hébert's novel 'Les Fous de Bassan', but left the project after heavy frictions with the producers. The film was eventually made with Yves Simoneau at the helm. Mankiewicz, for his part, was hired by CBC producer Bernard Zuckerman to direct 'And Then you die', an atmospheric thriller that won two Gemini TV awards. During those years he also directed Sam Shepard's play 'Comme une vue' in Montréal, his sole venture in the theater world.\n\nBased on a novel by Jacques Savoie adaptated by Savoie and Mankiewicz, 'Les Portes tournantes' was premiered at Cannes Film festival in 1988 in section 'Un Certain Regard'. It was distinguished by the Oecumenical jury and drew favourable notices before winning two Genies.\n\nMankiewicz then teamed up again with Bernard Zuckerman on two mini-series : 'Love and hate' (1990) and 'Conspiracy of Silence' (1991). Written by Suzette Couture and focusing on real life criminal cases, they both performed very well at the Geminis, winning respectively 5 and 7 trophees, each time including best dramatic mini-series and best direction.\n\nThose were to be Mankiewicz last films. In August 1993, he died unexpectedly of cancer at age 49. In his work, Mankiewicz often focused on family in crisis, relations between adults and children, echoes from the past. His premature death was a great loss for Canadian and Québécois cinema. Remain 'les beaux souvenirs' !\n\nDeepa Mehta is a transnational artist and a screenwriter, director, and producer whose work has been called \"courageous\", \"provocative\" and \"breathtaking\". Her visually lush and emotionally resonating films have played at every major international film festival; receiving numerous awards and accolades, and have been distributed around the world. Deepa was born in India and received a degree in philosophy from the University of New Delhi before immigrating to Canada. She began her career making documentaries in India.\n\nIn 1991, Deepa's first feature film Sam & Me, which stars Om Puri, won a Special Jury Mention in the Camera D'Or section at the Cannes Film Festival. Between 1992-1994 she directed two episodes of The Young Indiana Jones, produced by George Lucas for ABC. In 1993, Deepa directed her second feature film Camilla, a Canada-UK co-pro starring Jessica Tandy, Bridget Fonda, Elias Koteas, Maury Chaykin, Graham Greene, and Hume Cronyn. Fire, which Deepa wrote and directed, is the first film in her Elemental Trilogy (Fire, Earth, Water). Fire opened Perspective Canada at the 1996 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was runner-up for the People's Choice Most Popular Film Award. It played at the New York Film Festival and won many awards worldwide, including the Audience Award for Best Canadian Film at the Vancouver International Festival, the Special Jury Prize at the Mannheim-Heidelberg International Film Festival and Silver Hugo Awards for Best Direction and Best Actress in Chicago.\n\nEarth, based on Bapsi Sidhwa's acclaimed novel about Partition, Cracking India, is the second film in the Elemental Trilogy. It premiered as a Special Presentation at the 1998 Toronto International Film Festival, and won the Prix Premiere du Public at the Festival du Film Asiatique de Deauville and the Critics' Award at the Verona Schermi d'Amore International Film Festival. Bollywood/Hollywood was a change of pace. Written and directed by Deepa, it is a lighthearted, affectionate comedy about two mismatched lovers. It opened Perspective Canada at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival and was a tremendous crossover box office success. It remains one of the top 10 grossing English language Canadian movies. In 2003 Deepa co-wrote and directed the Canada-UK co-pro The Republic of Love, based on a Carol Shields novel.\n\nAfter a disrupted and hazardous production history Deepa's final film in the Elemental Trilogy Water opened the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, and was the first Canadian film acquired by US distributor Fox Searchlight. Water is a powerful, hauntingly tragic story, set in Benares (Varanasi) about a child widow who at the age of eight is forced to enter a house of widows where she has to live for the rest of her life. The movie was to have been shot in India in 2000, but Hindu fundamentalists fomented riots, burnt sets, and issued death threats against the director and actors, forcing production to shut down and the filmmakers to leave the country. Water was successfully remounted in Sri Lanka and completed shooting in June 2004, and features many of India's most renowned actors.\n\nWater was an enormous success. It was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Annual Academy Awards, and has screened at festivals around the world, winning many awards, and remains an audience favourite.
