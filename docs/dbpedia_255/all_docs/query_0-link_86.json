        "text": "David Cronenberg’s breakout film, “Shivers,” was both a success story and a scourge for the Canadian film industry. Released in 1975, it told the tale of a parasite that spreads through a Montreal high-rise, turning residents into sex-crazed zombies. The movie cost a hundred and eighty thousand dollars and brought in some five million, making it the highest-grossing film Canada had ever put out. Alas, it was not to everyone’s taste. Cronenberg gave his outrageous sci-fi premise a queasy sociological casing and played ruthlessly with horror-movie conventions, as in a bloody bathing scene à la “Psycho”—but with the deadly threat slithering up from the drain. The result was a parable of sexual revolution that split the difference between art and trash. In the U.S., the film was threatened with an X rating until Cronenberg agreed to remove a scene of a character hungrily stuffing bugs into his mouth. In Canada, Parliament debated whether its program of government-subsidized filmmaking had taken the cause of creative expression too far. Writing in the cultural journal Saturday Night, the novelist Robert Fulford excoriated Cronenberg as an opportunist gaming the system in a piece titled “You Should Know How Bad This Film Is. After All, You Paid for It.”\n\nIt’s one thing to get a bad review; it’s another to be accused of creating the “most perverse, disgusting and repulsive” film that a critic had ever seen. Cronenberg’s elderly landlady at the time read Fulford’s piece and apparently took literally his claim that her tenant made “sadistic pornography.” At the age of thirty-three, with a wife and young daughter, Cronenberg was suddenly evicted from his flat. A few weeks later, he recounted the ordeal in an editorial in the Globe and Mail, describing the “despicable hysteria” of Fulford’s article as an “attempt to take away both my livelihood and the expression of my dreams and nightmares.” He also revealed that, after he was evicted and had relocated to a house across the street, a city inspector arrived at his door to search the premises for evidence of filmmaking equipment in a residential setting, supposedly a zoning no-no. Cronenberg welcomed the man to come in and look around as much as he liked. “I felt confident and secure,” Cronenberg wrote. “This man would find nothing. He did not know what to look for.”\n\nIn the nearly half century since “Shivers,” through nineteen more feature films, Cronenberg has remained obsessed with bringing his nightmarish visions to life. He is fascinated by the flexibility and ferocity of the human organism, the myriad ways in which the body and its desires can betray us. He has explored those subjects using a clinical style punctuated by bursts of imaginative savagery, often achieved with stomach-turning, lo-fi special effects. His œuvre encompasses a gun made of gristle that fires teeth (“eXistenZ”); a typewriter with an anus (“Naked Lunch”); weaponized armpits (“Rabid”); a chest cavity reconfigured as a VCR (“Videodrome”); and, in “The Fly,” perhaps his best-known film, a human-insect mutant played by Jeff Goldblum. Many of his films have been met with revulsion or at least aggrieved ambivalence. Roger Ebert called “Dead Ringers”—about sibling gynecologists whose sinister intimacy dissolves in a haze of drug abuse, narcissicism, and sexual jealousy—the kind of movie “where you ask people how they liked it, and they say, ‘Well, it was well made,’ and then they wince.” When Cronenberg first competed at Cannes, in 1996, the jury was so flummoxed by the neurasthenic depravity of “Crash,” his adaptation of J. G. Ballard’s novel about car-wreck fetishists, that they jerry-rigged a special citation for “audacity.” Upon the film’s release in England, the country’s national-heritage secretary urged theatre owners not to show it. Cronenberg, in turn, has maintained a cool contempt for officious pundits and their agendas. He once joked to an interviewer, of his 1981 film “Scanners,” “I was exploding heads just like any other young, normal North American boy.” Like any North American boy, he achieved the infamous scene in question using a plaster cast stuffed with bits of leftover hamburger.\n\nDavid Foster Wallace once wrote that “Quentin Tarantino is interested in watching someone’s ear getting cut off; David Lynch is interested in the ear.” Cronenberg (whose sensibility, like Lynch’s, is unmistakable enough to function as an adjective) has supplied his new film, “Crimes of the Future,” with a character who has ears growing all over his body and his eyes sewn shut. The warped extremity of Cronenbergian body horror has kept him at a distance from the mainstream, but it’s also earned him a respect and influence that few other cult directors can claim. His work has been the subject of film-studies courses, Ph.D. dissertations, and critical anthologies, driving up the intellectual value of genre cinema without ever gentrifying it. His peerless series of gross-out mindfucks and philosophical schlockfests have shaped art-making in the movies and beyond, from the corporeal jolts of Darren Aronofsky’s “Black Swan” to the experimental pop of Charli XCX, who named a recent album “Crash.” Jordan Peele, an ascendant master of art-house scary movies, told the Wall Street Journal, in 2020, that watching “The Fly” taught him “the power of horror.” The veteran film critic J. Hoberman has called Cronenberg “the most provocative and consistently original North American director of his generation.”\n\n“Crimes of the Future,” Cronenberg’s first feature in eight years, marks something of a return to form. (It premièred at Cannes on May 23rd and is in theatres on Friday.) In the twenty-first century thus far, Cronenberg has made a string of relatively refined films, including literary adaptations such as Don DeLillo’s Wall Street odyssey “Cosmopolis” and the when-Freud-met-Jung period piece “A Dangerous Method.” He also wrote a novel, 2014’s globe-trotting thriller “Consumed,” which garnered respectful reviews from the likes of Jonathan Lethem, who praised the “sculptural intensity” of its details. “Crimes of the Future,” by comparison, is old-school Cronenberg body horror. It bears the same name as one of his earliest films, from the seventies, an experimental feature centered on a melancholy dermatologist navigating a world wiped of fertile women. The new “Crimes of the Future” echoes the original as a dystopic tale of human devolution, though, in a recent interview, Cronenberg claimed that the recycled title didn’t signal any particular connection between the two. “They both are accurately called ‘Crimes of the Future,’ ” he said. “So why not do it?”\n\nBased on a script that Cronenberg first wrote in the late nineties, under the title “Painkillers,” the new “Crimes” was shot in Athens and is set in an unspecified future, in a seaside town with jagged industrial wreckage strewn amid ancient ruins. Genetic mutations have led humans to continually grow new auxiliary organs and to lose the sensation of pain. The local attraction is a kind of surgical performance art. Saul Tenser (Viggo Mortensen), a veteran of the scene, lies supine onstage as his superfluous parts are extracted by his lover, Caprice (Léa Seydoux), as part of a grotesque double act.\n\nWhere many other auteurs can be identified by their virtuosity with the camera, Cronenberg makes images that are spare and functional, sometimes verging on amateurish. A former film professor of mine used to joke that Cronenberg was “a genius without talent.” But his cool style has a way of peeling back cinematic conventions and clichés, and extracting the intellectual marrow at the core of his sci-fi scenarios. The tone of “Crimes of the Future” is grim and searching, and the narrative momentum is minimal. In the opening minutes, a static shot shows a small boy sitting on the bathroom floor absent-mindedly munching on a plastic wastebasket. At once matter-of-fact and ominous—and soon followed by an act of ghastly violence—the tableau serves as an overture for the coming allegory of biological paradigm shift. Cronenberg’s scripts are littered with incantations that scan like twisted New Age mantras: “go all the way through it,” “you have to play the game,” and, most famously, from “Videodrome,” “long live the new flesh.” In “Crimes of the Future,” an obsequious pencil-pusher (played by a twitchier-than-usual Kristen Stewart) hounds Saul to register his tumors in a new database. At one point she tells him, in a line that sounds like both a diagnosis and a come-on, “Surgery is the new sex.”\n\n“People will say, ‘Oh, he’s back to body horror; he’s doing the same stuff he always did,’ ” Cronenberg, who is seventy-nine, told me recently. “But it’s never changed for me. My interest in the body is because, for me, it’s an inexhaustible subject—and of the essence of understanding the human condition. You will forgive me if I repeat myself. It’s just that these things are still true.” Before its première at Cannes, rumors circulated that “Crimes” 2.0 might cause viewers to suffer fainting spells or panic attacks. As it turned out, the Cannes première prompted only a few walkouts and received a standing ovation. Cronenberg, who dressed for the red carpet in white wraparound mountaineering glasses, told the audience, “I hope you’re not kidding.”\n\nSince the late nineties, Cronenberg has lived in a three-story family home in the prosperous Toronto neighborhood of Forest Hill. One afternoon in April, I visited him at the house, which is shielded from the street by several trees. Martin Scorsese once wrote that he’d been nervous to meet Cronenberg, given the nature of his films, and then was surprised to discover that he looked like “a gynecologist from Beverly Hills.” Slight and spry, Cronenberg greeted me at the door, wearing a sweatshirt in a pale-blue shade similar to the color of his eyes. His silver-white hair, as always, was upswept neatly from ear to ear, and his manner was as even and pleasant as his appearance. The pianist Glenn Gould, another Torontonian, observed that the city offered its inhabitants peace of mind because it “does not impose its ‘cityness’ upon you.” Cronenberg, in that sense, was made in the image of his home town.\n\nCronenberg has lived alone since the death of his second wife, Carolyn, a filmmaker, five years ago, but he maintains close relationships with his three children—a daughter and son with Carolyn, and a daughter from his first marriage, to Margaret Hindson—all of whom live nearby. He gently dismissed my suggestion that we take a stroll through the neighborhood’s bustling, patio-lined strip of coffee shops and restaurants, though not for fear of being recognized. “I’m common as dirt around here,” he said, leading me past rows of family photos and a dark-brown Braunschweig piano passed down from Carolyn’s mother, before ducking into the kitchen to prepare us espressos. We sat down in the dining room, which is decorated with an enormous photorealistic portrait of Cronenberg’s face woven from threads by the Argentinian art collective Mondongo. “Viggo commissioned them secretly and gave it to me as a gift,” Cronenberg told me. “It’s pretty good. It’s me being God.” Nearly a decade ago, Cronenberg donated a trove of personal mementos and props to the Toronto International Film Festival, including the fleshy bio-ports from “eXistenZ” and the steel surgical tools from “Dead Ringers.” The only movie ephemera I spotted in his home was a miniature version of Brundlefly, from “The Fly,” which sat on a shelf near a cluster of bulbous vintage Genie Awards—Canada’s equivalent to Oscars statuettes—one of which was put to use as a murder weapon in Cronenberg’s scabrous 2014 show-biz satire “Maps to the Stars.”\n\nWhen I asked Cronenberg, at one point, about the notable absence of teen angst or coming-of-age stories in his œuvre, he said, “It’s not a burr under the saddle for me.” Raised in Toronto in a middle-class Jewish family, he was by his own account a happy child. His father, Milton, was a local newspaper columnist and crime writer. His mother, Esther, played piano with the National Ballet of Canada. “In my family, art was something that you could do and probably should do,” he said. “People would come over and see five thousand books, hallways made of books because we didn’t have that many bookshelves. We were sort of unique on the block.” In his youth, Cronenberg was fascinated by the natural sciences, including botany and lepidopterology. In a 1992 book of interviews, “Cronenberg on Cronenberg,” he describes the focussed intimacy of empirical discovery: “What you saw through the microscope was fantastic. But when you looked up from the microscope, you were lost.” He was also a science-fiction writer and a budding cinephile. He recalled once visiting his neighborhood movie house, in Toronto’s Little Italy, to watch a children’s matinée, and noticing adult viewers emerging from another theatre across the street, weeping in broad daylight. “I thought, What did they see that made them cry?” he told me. “What an extraordinary thing. I certainly had never cried at the movies myself. And so I crossed the street and I saw that it was ‘La Strada,’ and it was my first indication that movies had that kind of power.”\n\nCronenberg attended the University of Toronto and studied English, but an encounter with a low-budget student film proved revelatory. David Secter’s “Winter Kept Us Warm” (1965), named after a line in T. S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” was a poetic study of an awkward undergrad with a painful crush on his male best friend. Cronenberg has said that it made him realize that you could “just go out and make a fucking film.” With the future Hollywood director Ivan Reitman, who was studying in nearby Hamilton, Ontario, he co-founded the Toronto Film Co-op, modelled after the underground cinema hubs of New York, and over the following years made a series of handcrafted films marked by a Beckettian existential deadpan. In 1971, Cronenberg ventured to Cannes to survey the terrain. “The red carpet was a million miles away,” he told me. “I hung out with all the guys that were making low-budget softcore porn and horror films.”\n\nIn search of other kindred spirits, Cronenberg contacted the low-end Montreal-based distributor Cinépix Film Properties, whose founders had cornered the French-Canadian softcore market. They were receptive to the script for “Shivers” (or, as it was then titled, “Orgy of the Blood Parasites”), but they struggled for several years before persuading Canada’s government film program to contribute to the project. In an interview clip from 1976, a journalist asks a boyish, bespectacled Cronenberg whether he’s out to “create a body of art or a fast buck.” Cronenberg, who has a knack for deflecting bad-faith challenges with a velvety diplomacy, replied that “Shivers” took four years to complete and netted him about thirteen thousand dollars. “That’s not fast, and it’s not much of a buck, either,” he said. “Shivers” did earn Cronenberg enough of a reputation to attract well-known performers to his films. Oliver Reed and Samantha Eggar starred in his harrowing divorce allegory “The Brood” (1979), completed during Cronenberg’s separation from Hindson, which he famously referred to as his “Kramer vs. Kramer.” Where Robert Benton’s Oscar winner features separated parents figuratively licking their wounds, Cronenberg’s film climaxes with Eggar’s character using her tongue to bathe her murderous, parthenogenetically birthed offspring.\n\nCronenberg’s closest brush with Hollywood was in the early eighties, when he was hired to adapt Stephen King’s best-selling novel “The Dead Zone.” Anchored by a mournful performance from Christopher Walken and produced by the Hollywood legend Dino De Laurentiis, the film was well reviewed and made back double its budget. Any Canadian filmmaker who achieves a measure of success is tempted to decamp to Los Angeles. Norman Jewison did so, in the sixties, and then won an Oscar for “In the Heat of the Night.” “The Dead Zone” was shot in Ontario, but post-production took place partly in L.A. “We rented a house in Los Feliz,” Cronenberg recalled. “And for the first two or three days my wife and I were saying, ‘Why are we fighting this? This is great. We should just move here.’ And then, for the next five weeks, we said, ‘Can’t wait to get out of here.’ It was just very suffocating: too much movie business and too much Americana.”\n\n“The Fly,” in 1986, solidified Cronenberg’s ability to keep working on his home turf. Distributed by Twentieth Century Fox but shot in Toronto, it was a horror movie with an uncanny sense of place, and Goldblum’s Seth Brundle, a.k.a. Brundlefly, was one of the great tragic movie monsters—Dr. Frankenstein and his creation fused together in one grotesque insectoid body. (“The medicine cabinet is now the Brundle Museum of Natural History,” he tells his horrified lover, played by Geena Davis, of the decaying parts of himself that he’s stored in his bathroom in jars.) The movie grossed sixty million dollars at the box-office, and its profitability gave Cronenberg the freedom to pursue passion projects. He made the monumentally off-putting “Dead Ringers,” eliciting a bravura dual performance from a bone-dry Jeremy Irons, and an adaptation of William S. Burroughs’s “Naked Lunch” (1991), a novel long deemed “unfilmable.” He seemed to evince some pride in his own range when he told me, over our coffees, “William Burroughs made me tea, and Dino De Laurentiis made me cappuccino.”\n\nAfter the success of “The Dead Zone,” Cronenberg was offered the chance to direct blockbusters, including “Return of the Jedi” and the original “Top Gun.” I asked him whether it was true that he’d also been pitched the hit serial-killer thriller “Se7en,” and he looked genuinely uncertain. “There’s been a bunch of stuff, but who knows if it would have worked out with me. I don’t have a drawer full of scripts, because the only scripts I’m interested in are my own.” He told me that he’d recently screened the new “Batman” movie, out of respect for its star, Robert Pattinson, whom he worked with on “Maps to the Stars” and “Cosmopolis.” “I thought that Rob was an honorable Batman,” Cronenberg said. “I don’t want to say anything more than that, because I’ve already made my position on superhero movies clear and been attacked for it.” (His position: that people who revere Christopher Nolan’s “The Dark Knight Rises” don’t know “what the fuck they’re talking about.”) But in the end he couldn’t help himself. “It’s basically an adolescent power fantasy, and that’s its essence,” he said, of the new installment. “You can’t get away from that, and it limits it in terms of emotion and power and intellect.”\n\nIn contrast to such provocateurs as Lars von Trier or Nicolas Winding Refn, who bracket their cinematic endurance tests in compulsory irony, Cronenberg is in some senses a peculiarly earnest filmmaker. Over the years, many people have wondered how a seemingly well-adjusted person can produce such disturbing art, but Cronenberg speaks of his work as a friendly invitation to follow his wandering mind. “I’m not making a movie to assault anybody,” he told me. “I’m going on this little thought-voyage, and some things are disturbing me, some things are confusing me, some things are delighting me unexpectedly, and here it is. Maybe you will come on this trip with me. Maybe you will feel the same, and maybe you won’t.” The outré violence in Cronenberg films is often very funny, not because he indulges in a cartoonish sadism, in the vein of Tarantino, but because he takes such obvious pleasure in biological hyperbole. Describing the retro prosthetics used in the movie, which lend the surgical goings on a hilarious tactility, he told me, “It’s kind of like the human body. When you open them up, they’re just crammed with stuff. It’s beautiful and laughable and ridiculous. And that’s us, you know?”\n\n“Crimes of the Future” is Cronenberg’s first movie explicitly about the process of art-making, and the sacrifices that unbounded personal expression requires. Léa Seydoux told me that she sees the film as “a metaphor about what it is to be an artist,” adding, “Do we need to feel pain to create art?” Saul’s striated scar tissue marks him as a brand name in mortification, a slashed soldier of the avant-garde. After once again having his innards extracted for all to see, he declares, “Art triumphs once again.” Cronenberg spoke respectfully of his friend Guillermo del Toro, the Mexican director of horror-fantasy films, whose woman-amphibian love story “The Shape of Water” won the Oscar for Best Picture, in 2018. But Cronenberg shares none of del Toro’s crowd-pleasing impulses. His own sensibility is reflected more closely in last year’s surprise winner of Cannes’s top prize, Julia Ducournau’s “Titane,” a lubriciously explicit thriller featuring gushers of blood and oil and a biomechanical human-car-hybrid baby. “Cronenberg’s work has been foundational for me, the same way Greek mythology was when I was a kid,” Ducournau said at the time, adding, “His work is in my DNA.” Cronenberg told me, “To be a provoker of creativity is a lovely thing. It connects with the idea of having children.” He paused, then added, “It’s my ‘brood.’ ”\n\nIn early 2020, Cronenberg alarmed his fans by saying, in an interview, “If I never make another movie, that’s perfectly OK.” He told me that he didn’t mean the comment as a signal that he was calling it quits. “My wife had died, and I really felt I didn’t have the heart for it,” Cronenberg said. “It wasn’t like Soderbergh retiring twenty times. It wasn’t meant to be a public thing. I was really saying what I was feeling.” Shortly afterward, the producer Robert Lantos urged him to revisit the script that became “Crimes of the Future,” and last month Cronenberg announced another project, “The Shrouds,” about a businessman who creates a device to communicate intimately with the dead. Cronenberg said that he had originally pitched the idea to Netflix, as a series, but the company balked at the finished script. “It went in a direction that they had not anticipated, even though I’d tried to be very articulate about it,” he told me. “They said, ‘It wasn’t what we fell in love with in the room.’ I came to feel that what they fell in love with in the room was me and my story, because it was a grief story about a dead wife, and they knew about that. So I think they felt that that’s what it was going to be, and it wasn’t only that.”\n\nA synopsis of “The Shrouds” makes it sound like a ghost story, but Cronenberg has always been a filmmaker of a staunch secularism. With the exception of “The Dead Zone” and its telepathic Chicken Little protagonist, Cronenberg is unique among masters of horror in eschewing the occult. In his movies, the mysteries of the universe are terribly close at hand. Creatures are either birthed in laboratories or crawl out of the darkest recesses of the human mind. “In a lot of horror films, you’re talking about supernatural things,” he told me. “I totally deny that. In fact, I think it’s a distraction, as I think religion is. I mean, to me, that’s the basis of religion: the avoidance of the reality of death.” I asked him whether he believed that people could be haunted, even if not literally. “I’m certainly haunted, no question,” he said, looking around the room. “If I were a different kind of person, raised in a different culture, I would definitely have ghosts floating around this house. After my wife died, people said I was going to sell the house and move into a condo, and I thought, Absolutely not—why would I do such a thing?” He added that he understands why people find comfort in the idea of ghosts: “However scary those afterlife critters are that come after you, they’re promising that you will still be alive after you die. That’s the hidden thing.”\n\nEarlier this year, Cronenberg collaborated with the younger of his two daughters, Caitlin, on a homemade, one-minute short film titled “The Death of David Cronenberg.” In it, the director doffs his bathrobe and crawls naked into bed with a to-scale replica of his own nude corpse—a prop on loan from a Canadian horror TV series in which he’d made a gruesome cameo. “I’m looking at this body, and it even had the shape of my dad’s nail beds,” Caitlin, who is thirty-seven, recalled. “It was shocking how real it looked, and it was made worse because, even though we didn’t show this in the film, the body had this gaping wound right in the middle.” They made the short at the family’s home, in Caitlin’s former childhood bedroom. “It was hard to shoot,” she said. “When we were first blocking it out, he put pillows where he imagined the body would be, and he was, like, ‘You know this is supposed to be Mom, right?’ I said, ‘Got it.’ The thing is, we grieve in really different ways, and he needs to create to grieve.” The short is mournful and tender, but it also vibrates with a familiar wry defiance; in Cronenberg’s hands, an old man cuddling his own dead doppelgänger comes off less as a treacly indulgence than as a demystifying gaze into the abyss.\n\nCaitlin is a professional photographer. She shot the cover for Drake’s 2016 album “Views,” featuring the rapper, a Toronto native, perched atop the city’s iconic CN Tower, and in recent years has also done the stills for her father’s productions. “Our household is what inspired me,” she said. “My dad would speak openly at the dinner table about about how much sex there was in “Crash” or how frustrated he was that it was going to be given an NC-17 rating. He told us about how he didn’t want to change anything, because ‘Fuck the censors.’ I would go to set as a little kid and there would be bloody bits of this or that around. My brother and I came out of that household not fearing sex or violence in the creation of our own art. My dad would come home at three in the morning from a shoot, go to bed, and get up the next day with the biggest smile on his face because he loved what he was creating.”\n\nViggo Mortensen told me that Cronenberg, on the cusp of eighty, still has the attitude of “an incredibly gifted guy who just got out of film school and stepped onto set.” “Crimes of the Future” is the pair’s fourth collaboration, though the first developed from a script by Cronenberg. Mortensen was memorably mutilated in a Russian bathhouse—naked and mid-shvitz—in “Eastern Promises” and gave a hearty, cigar-chomping interpretation of Sigmund Freud in “A Dangerous Method.” He’s said that their first project together, the riveting crime drama “A History of Violence” (2005), is possibly the best film he’s ever been in. Cronenberg made the movie as a director for hire, but certain scenes—such as a shocking sexual encounter probing the Mortensen character’s hidden identity—are distinctly his own.\n\nMortensen is now sixty-three, but in “Crimes of the Future” he gives Saul the bearing of a much older man. In the course of the film, the character limps and coughs through his daily encounters, and struggles to reconcile his grisly showmanship with the fact that his flesh is increasingly weak. He spends his time offstage resting in a robotic, cocoonlike contraption, diminished but still engaged. “I’m feeling creative,” he tells Caprice after discovering a new tumor ahead of schedule. “There’s a certain dryness and irony—a certain kind of humor that Saul has,” Mortensen said, adding, “He has independence of thought as an artist and as a technician. Of all the movies we’ve done, it’s the one where I think the character is closest to David.” When I mentioned Mortensen’s comment to Cronenberg, he said, “I’m not sure that that’s true in a literal sense of autobiography. On a metaphorical level of autobiography, though, I think he’s right.”\n\nIn 2014, shortly after his seventieth birthday, Cronenberg wrote an introduction to a new translation of “The Metamorphosis,” in which he compared his own experience of aging to Gregor Samsa’s alarming transformation. Both he and Kafka’s creation had been forced into “a new, mandatory reality, and life does not continue as it did.” If there’s an archetypal ending to Cronenberg films, it’s one in which the protagonist stares down the barrel of his mortality. I asked Cronenberg about the eerie prevalence of suicide in his films, dating back to “Videodrome,” his squishy and self-reflexive riff on violence in the media, whose final scene features James Woods’s antihero holding a gun to his temple, psyching himself up to pull the trigger. “It’s to be or not to be,” Cronenberg said. “Man is condemned to be free, and part of the freedom is that you can end your life, and you have the capability of doing that more and more easily as time goes on. So that opens up the question of why should you be alive.” In the last scene of “Crimes of the Future,” Saul ingests a potentially lethal substance while Caprice, a creator to the end, films the results for posterity. A final, rapturous closeup of Mortensen’s face resonates not with despair but with a humane acceptance of both the unknown and the inevitable."
