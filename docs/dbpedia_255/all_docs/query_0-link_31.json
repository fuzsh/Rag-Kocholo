        "text": "Since the beginning of her career, French-Canadian filmmaker Louise Bourque has made the re-use of her own images and home movies (some of which were shot before she was born) an essential and moving part of her creative work. In addition to the notable presence of her own parents, her mother in Just Words (1991), her second film, and her father in Bye Bye Now (2022), her last film to date, it is above all the central theme of the “home” that attracts attention and seems to possess an obsessive charge that runs through her work (this is the thematic around which this program was elaborated).\n\nThis house where she was born, in Edmunston, New Brunswick (and which still belongs to her family), becomes, throughout her films, the very place of haunting, of trauma, of fragility, of the pain of memory. It was in the garden of this house that she buried the outtakes of her first films, which, once unearthed, would give rise to the dazzling Self-Portrait Post-Mortem and Remains In all these films, she allows us to explore the abysmal depth of this expression, “No Place Like Home”. If no place can compare to home, it is also because home is not always the hospitable place we want it to be. Home is not always a place we want to return to. This is why “going back home”, far from any nostalgia, has the sound of a broken lullaby and appears, in all her films, as a process of confrontation with these wounds, often invisible, which fragment the self and which the manipulated filmstrip manages to metaphorize: the work of mourning is never completed (hence the role of repetition in several of her films). The photochemical, optical and plastic manipulation techniques that Bourque applies to these images give them an aura of intranquility, far from the often falsely reassuring character of the home movie (and of the peaceful “home” they evoke) as a place of innocence and happiness. Through a meticulous, “hands on” approach that explores the material properties of film, she offers us works that, by making a poetic archaeology of her own history, unearth, expose and release powerful blazes of light, noise and color, leaving lasting imprints on each viewer.\n\nAndré Habib, 2023\n\nLouise Bourque\n\nLouise Bourque is a French-Canadian Acadian filmmaker who studied film at Concordia University in Montreal and at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. After a 30-year exile in the United States where she made films and taught, she recently returned to Montreal. Her films have been screened in some 50 countries and broadcast on PBS and the Sundance Channel in the United States, as well as on Télé-Québec in Canada and SBS in Australia. Her work has been shown in prestigious museums and galleries around the world, including the Musée de la Civilisation and the Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec in Quebec City, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Her latest film, Bye Bye Now, had its world premiere in Bologna at the Archivio Aperto festival. In 2021, the book Imprints: the films of Louise Bourque, edited by Clint Enns and Stephen Broomer, was published, the first monograph devoted to her work, bringing together texts by international researchers and renowned filmmakers.\n\nFrom 1989 to today, Louise Bourque has made a major contribution to the history of Canadian and international experimental cinema. An alchemist of film, a filmmaker of the intimate, revisiting from film to film the ever-paradoxical place of the home, of the self-portrait, of home movies through a rigorous investigation of the materiality of film, Bourque offers us an essential, radical work of abrasive beauty. Her essential films include (2022). The People in the House (1992), Imprint (1999), L’éclat du mal (2000), Self-Portrait Post-Mortem (2002), Self-Portrait Autoportrait PostPartum (2017) and Bye Bye Now (2022)."
