        "text": "How Sundance-award winner \"Dìdi (弟弟)\" became a reality\n\nAcademy Award®-nominated director (Raya and the Last Dragon) — and Dolby Institute Fellowship winner — Carlos López Estrada brings together another exciting panel of film professionals. As one of the producers, Carlos joins fellow Academy Award®-nominated director (Nai Nai & Wài Pó) Sean Wang, along with members of the cast and crew, to discuss the herculean task of bringing their independent film Dìdi (弟弟) to life. Be sure to check out Dìdi (弟弟) in theaters Friday, July 26, 2024! Wide release on August 16th.\n\nA-List colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld\n\nPerhaps the top colorist in his field, Stefan Sonnenfeld joins us for our 200th episode! If you aren’t aware of Stefan, you’ve almost certainly seen his work. Some of his recent projects include Top Gun: Maverick, The White Lotus, and Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3. His credit list includes some of the biggest franchises in our business, including Star Wars, Star Trek, Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, Transformers, and many more. Just a few of the A-List directors and producers he has worked with are: Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Michael Mann, Martin Scorsese, Zack Snyder, Tom Cruise, Michael Bay, Bradley Cooper, Steven Zaillian, Spike Jonze, Gore Verbinski, Tim Burton, Matt Reeves, JJ Abrams, George Clooney, Tony Gilroy, and Judd Apatow.\n\nSo what does it take to be a top colorist in Hollywood, working for some of the biggest personalities in the business?\n\nBlending fantasy with reality in HBO’s Ren Faire\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Lance Oppenheim, as well as sound supervisor and re-recording mixer Paul Hsu, join us to discuss their new HBO documentary limited-series, Ren Faire. This conversation was recorded in-person, in front of a live audience at Dolby’s screening room in mid-town Manhattan, as part of our ongoing collaboration with the Artist Academy and Film at Lincoln Center. Ren Faire details the Succession-like power struggle atop The Texas Renaissance Festival, amid its founder’s impending retirement. It was filmed in an appropriately over-the-top theatrical style, and features some incredible sonic world-building, which cleverly mixes real and fantastical elements.\n\nBe sure to check out Ren Faire, with all three episodes now streaming on Max.\n\nThe star-studded audio dramatization of George Orwell’s 1984\n\nAndrew Garfield, Cynthia Erivo, Andrew Scott, and Tom Hardy are just a few of the celebrity voice actors in the new Audible Original adaptation of “George Orwell’s 1984.” But this adaptation is unique in that it is audio-only — not unlike a radio play. In doing so, writer Joe White had to translate the novel, which was written from a third-person perspective, and put the audience completely into Winston’s POV. And the creative team needed to rely purely on audio to do all the world-building, without the advantages of visuals or an omniscient narrator.\n\nYou can experience George Orwell’s 1984 on Audible in Dolby Atmos®, which fully immerses the listener into this chilling, dystopian world.\n\nThe Immersive Sound of Baldur’s Gate 3\n\nOne of the reasons behind the immense popularity of this hit multiplayer roleplaying game is its incredible soundtrack. In this episode, we are joined by the Audio Director of Larian Studios — the makers of Baldur’s Gate 3 — Stefan Randelshofer, along with our guest host, Dolby’s Senior Game Developer Relations Manager, Alistair Hirst, in a live discussion from this year’s Game Developers Conference, to discuss what went into creating the rich, sonic atmosphere of the video game.\n\n3 Body Problem - Adapting the “Unadaptable”\n\nShowrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff — co-creators of Game of Thrones — and Alexander Woo (True Blood) join us to talk about their epic new science fiction series: 3 Body Problem on Netflix. The show is based on a series of bestselling books by Liu Cixin — which, famously, have been described as “unadaptable” to film & TV, due to the complexities of particle physics, which are at the heart of the premise of the story. Rounding out the discussion are:\n\nDirector of Photography Jonathan Freeman\n\nSound Designer Paula Fairfield\n\nSupervising Sound Editor Tim Kimmel\n\nEditor Michael Ruscio\n\nFilming The American Society of Magical Negroes\n\nThe collaboration between director and cinematographer is arguably the most important dynamic on any film shoot. Here to discuss that are Director Kobi Libii and Director of Photography Doug Emmett, with their satirical comedy, The American Society of Magical Negroes. The film was also a winner of the Dolby Institute Fellowship, which grants independent films with the funds to finish in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and we were very proud to finally watch the completed film when it premiered at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival before it was released in theaters by Focus Features.\n\nThis conversation was a live webinar as part of the Dolby Institute’s partnership with Sundance Collab, the digital platform from the Sundance Institute designed for filmmakers, with exclusive webinars, curated resources, and free educational videos.\n\nThe Making of Masters of the Air\n\nThis week we discuss the sound, music, and cinematography of Masters of the Air, the epic WWII limited series from Apple TV+. With so many films and shows about World War II over the past several decades, one of the biggest challenges of the series was keeping things fresh. So the creative teams took some ingenious approaches to give every episode and action sequence a unique look, sound, and feel.\n\nJoining our conversation:\n\nSupervising Sound Editor Jack Whittaker\n\nRe-recording Mixer Duncan McRae\n\nRe-recording Mixer Michael Minkler\n\nComposer Blake Neeley\n\nCinematographer Jac Fitzgerald\n\nIs “No Budget Filmmaking” a fantasy? Hosted by Carlos López…\n\nRecorded live at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, Academy Award®-nominated director (Raya and the Last Dragon) — and Dolby Institute Fellowship winner — Carlos López Estrada brings together another all-star panel of Hollywood talent, this time posing the question: Is “No Budget Filmmaking” even possible in this day and age? The panel includes independent filmmakers: Bao Nguyen (The Greatest Night in Pop, Be Water); Rishi Rajani (The Chi, Being Mary Tyler Moore, A Thousand and One); Justin Simien (Dear White People, Bad Hair, Hollywood Black)\n\nHans Zimmer and the score of Dune: Part Two\n\n2-time Academy Award®-winning composer Hans Zimmer joins us on the podcast to discuss his work on Dune: Part Two, after winning an Oscar for his score to the first installment of the sci-fi franchise, directed by Denis Villeneuve. And like Denis, Hans had been dreaming about working on these films since he was a boy. And he also knew he wanted to take them in a less traditional direction, sonically.\n\nGreig Fraser and the cinematography of Dune: Part Two\n\nAcademy Award®-winning Director of Photography Greig Fraser, ACS, ASC, returns to the podcast to discuss his work on Dune: Part Two. The film is a stunning achievement, from both the technical and artistic standpoints, which benefitted greatly from being a continuation of his work from part one.\n\nBest Cinematography nominees: Academy Awards 2024\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n01:28 - El Conde - Edward Lachman, ASC\n\n12:53 - Killers of the Flower Moon - Rodrigo Prieto, ASC, AMC\n\n24:12 - Oppenheimer - Hoyte Van Hoytema, ASC, FSF, NSC\n\n33:29 - Poor Things - Robbie Ryan, BSC, ISC\n\nWelcome to our continuing coverage of this year's Academy Awards®.

Unfortunately, due to scheduling, Matthew Libatique (Maestro) was not able to join us.\n\nBest Sound nominees: Academy Awards 2024\n\nTable of Contents:\n\n01:30 - The Creator\n\n12:26 - Maestro\n\n23:13 - Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One\n\n33:55 - Oppenheimer\n\n44:36 - The Zone of Interest\n\nWelcome to our continuing coverage of this year's Academy Awards®.

So, if you are an Oscar voter — either as an Academy member or as a fan participating in your annual office pool — you'll have a much better idea of what to watch (and listen) for as you get to this category on your ballot!\n\nNOTE: As always, all nominees are invited to join our conversations. Unfortunately, due to scheduling, John Williams (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny) was not able to join us in conversation. And as you may know, Robbie Robertson (Killers of the Flower Moon) sadly passed away this past summer at the age of 80.\n\nDirector Gareth Edwards and the Oscar-Nominated VFX of The C…\n\nThe Academy Award®-nominated VFX team joins our returning guest, director Gareth Edwards, to discuss how they created such a visually stunning, effects-heavy science-fiction film with a comparatively minuscule budget, for The Creator. Rather than utilizing extensive previz, green screen studios, and fully-rendered CGI environments, The Creator was filmed on-location in Asia, documentary-style, with a very small crew, completely upending the usual methods of shooting for VFX.\n\nToday’s panel:\n\nGareth Edwards, Director, Producer, and Co-writer.\n\nOren Soffer, Director of Photography.\n\nJay Cooper, Visual Effects Supervisor: Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nAndrew Roberts, Visual Effects On-Set Supervisor: Industrial Light & Magic.\n\nBe sure to check out The Creator, in Dolby Vision® and Dolby Atmos® (where available)\n\nThe Oscar-Nominated sound team behind Bradley Cooper's Maest…\n\nContinuing our coverage of the 2024 Academy Awards®, we have another all-star team of sound artists whose work on Maestro is nominated in the Best Sound category:\n\nRichard King, Sound Designer & Supervising Sound Editor.\n\nTom Ozanich, Re-recording Mixer.\n\nDean A. Zupancic, Re-recording Mixer.\n\nSteven Morrow, Production Sound Mixer.\n\nMaestro is a highly stylized yet intimate film about Leonard Bernstein: his fraught marriage, his affairs, his family, and - of course - his storied career. This gave director Bradley Cooper an amazing opportunity to conduct extensive recreations of some of the composer’s famous concerts, all recorded live on set — including that unforgettable concert at Ely Cathedral.\n\nBe sure to check out “Maestro,” now streaming on Netflix in Dolby Vision® and Dolby Atmos®.\n\nThe cinematography of El Conde, with DP Edward Lachman\n\nLegendary cinematographer Edward Lachman, ASC, joins us to discuss his Academy Award®-nominated cinematography for El Conde, Chilean filmmaker Pablo Larraín’s satirical horror-comedy which reimagines Augusto Pinochet as a 250-year old vampire. The film features stunning black & white photography, which required the invention of a new kind of camera sensor in order to capture the unique look and feel of the film. Edward discusses that, his use of vintage glass, the advantages of having his director as camera operator, and more.\n\nThe Cinematography of Poor Things, with DP Robbie Ryan\n\nOur coverage of the 2024 Oscars continues in this episode with our guest, Robbie Ryan, BSC, ISC. Robbie is a two-time Academy Award® nominee for Cinematography.\n\nIn today’s episode, he discusses his second collaboration with director Yorgos Lanthimos on the film Poor Things. This year, Poor Things boasts 11 Academy Award nominations, including Best Director for Lanthimos and Best Picture. In this wide-ranging conversation, Robbie explains how he crafted the film’s unique, almost dreamlike look, which was mostly captured in-camera, and on film, without post-production effects.\n\nThe cinematography of Killers of the Flower Moon, with DP Ro…\n\nWith our continuing Oscars coverage, today we are joined by Academy Award®-nominated cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, ASC, AMC. He discusses how he got his start in the film business, working with legendary director Martin Scorsese, the challenges of shooting Killers of the Flower Moon, as well as how his research into Osage traditions and rituals became directly woven into his photography for the film.\n\nThe Oscar-Nominated sound team behind Oppenheimer\n\nWe have an all-star team of sound artists whose work on Oppenheimer is nominated for a 2024 Academy Award®. They are certainly no strangers to that award show, as they already have NINE Oscars between them!\n\nRichard King - Sound Designer and Supervising Sound Editor\n\nGary A. Rizzo - Re-recording Mixer\n\nKevin O’Connell - Re-recording Mixer\n\nWillie D. Burton - Production Sound Mixer\n\nWe discussed how they approached getting inside the head of the brilliant but troubled “Father of the Atomic Bomb,” J. Robert Oppenheimer, as well as working with the brilliant, and very particular director Christopher Nolan, who used some unconventional methods to record the dialogue.\n\nThe cinematography of Oppenheimer, with DP Hoyte Van Hoytema\n\nAs part of our continuing Oscars coverage, we are joined by Academy Award®-nominated cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, ASC, FSF, NSC. He discusses how he got his start in the film business, working with Christopher Nolan, shooting Oppenheimer on film, how they did all those in-camera practical effects, and his fears about creating a dynamically visual film… with so much dialogue.\n\nFirst-Time Filmmakers at Sundance, Hosted by Carlos López Es…\n\nRecorded live at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival, Academy Award nominated director — and Dolby Institute Fellowship winner — Carlos López Estrada (Raya and the Last Dragon) brings together five filmmakers, each with debut feature films in the US Dramatic Competition this year. So what does it take to get into the Sundance Film Festival, despite all of the challenges of being a first-time filmmaker? And how do you make the most of it once you do?\n\nDemystifying Sundance, hosted by Carlos López Estrada\n\nDirector Carlos López Estrada (Raya and the Last Dragon) returns to The Dolby Institute Podcast for another panel discussion, this time with members of Sundance. More than just a film festival, The Sundance Institute offers a myriad of resources for emerging and independent filmmakers, but navigating them all can be overwhelming. So this very special podcast episode is designed to answer your essential questions about The Sundance Film Festival and Sundance Institute.\n\nThe music of The Color Purple\n\nDirector Blitz Bazawule joins his composer Kris Bowers to discuss their new adaptation of “The Color Purple.” You may remember the original filmed adaptation of Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, directed by Steven Spielberg, from 1985. This version is actually an adaptation of the hit Broadway show, which won two Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical. Our guest host, music journalist Jon Burlingame, speaks with Kris and Blitz about their collaboration on the film, which began very early in the filmmaking process.\n\nDirector Jonathan Glazer and the sound of The Zone of Intere…\n\nJonathan Glazer joins us to discuss his latest film, “The Zone of Interest,” a searing drama about life just outside of the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp, which the director chose to have the audience hear, rather than see. Joining the discussion is Johnnie Burn, the film’s sound designer, supervising sound editor, and re-recording mixer, as well as producer James Wilson.\n\nThis conversation was recorded as a live panel discussion after a screening of the film at the New York Film Festival and was part of our support of the FLC Artist Academy program, where we bring conversations about the art and craft of filmmaking to the next generation of directors: https://www.filmlinc.org/academy-programs/artists-academy/\n\nThe making of Society of the Snow\n\nDirector J.A. Bayona discusses his latest film — and the country of Spain’s official submission to this year’s Academy Awards — “Society of the Snow.”\n\nDirector of Photography Pedro Luque and Sound Designer Oriol Tarragó also join us to discuss how they crafted this riveting retelling of the infamous 1972 Andes flight disaster, where a team of rugby players from Uraguay had to do the unthinkable to survive. Realism was big priority for Bayona, so the production was a challenging, sometimes even grueling experience.\n\nThe music of Poor Things\n\nComposer Jerskin Fendrix joins us to discuss his first-ever film score — the latest from director Yorgos Lanthimos — “Poor Things.” It was an exciting experimental collaboration for both artists, as this was also the director’s first time working with an original score for one of his films.\n\nOur guest host, music journalist Jon Burlingame, returns to the Dolby Institute Podcast to discuss Jerskin’s background, creative process, and what it was like to work with Lanthimos for the composer’s feature film debut.\n\nThe sound of Emerald Fennell’s wicked new film - Saltburn\n\nAcademy Award-winning writer and director Emerald Fennell joins us to discuss her latest dark comedy thriller, Saltburn. The film features an unflinchingly disturbing story, incredible performances, and an appropriately cutting-edge sound design, which was being experimented with up until the very end of post-production.\n\nJoining the conversation with Fennell are supervising sound editors Nina Hartstone and Eilam Hoffman, production sound mixer Nina Rice, and re-recording mixers Adam Scrivener and Jasper Thorn.\n\nScreenwriting for Change, Hosted by Carlos López Estrada\n\nDirector Carlos López Estrada (Raya and the Last Dragon) leads another all-star panel of Hollywood talent to discuss how they’ve navigated the industry as screenwriters, television writers, and showrunners. These talented writers have not only enjoyed enormous success in the industry, but have also brought their own fresh perspectives which have been missing for a long time in Hollywood.\n\nToday’s panel includes writers: Carolina Paiz (Narcos, Grey’s Anatomy, Orange is The New Black), Dana Ledoux Miller (The Newsroom, Thai Cave Rescue, Disney’s Moana), Joanna Calo (Hacks, Beef, Bojack Horseman, The Bear), Charles Yu (Interior Chinatown, Westworld, American Born Chinese, Marvel’s Legion on FX)\n\nConversations with Colorists: Picture Shop\n\nOur guest host Tom Graham — the Head of Dolby Vision® Content Enablement — returns for the second installment of our ongoing series, “Conversations with Colorists,” where he discusses the nitty gritty of working as a professional colorist, especially for projects that deliver in Dolby Vision®.\n\nJoining the discussion are three of the top colorists working in film & television today — Tony D’Amore, Paul Westerbeck, and Frederik Bokkenhauser, all senior colorists at Picture Shop.\n\nProducers searching for new voices, hosted by Carlos López E…\n\nWhat exactly are movie producers looking for when searching for new creative voices? Director Carlos López Estrada returns with another all-star panel to discuss this very topic, with some of the top producers in the field. So if you are an aspiring filmmaker, screenwriter, director, or any of the above early in your career, this episode is filled with real-world advice for navigating the film industry as an emerging creative voice.\n\nJoining Carlos are producers: Christina Oh, Producer, Minari, Poppy Hanks, Executive Producer, Judas and the Black Messiah, Michael Gottwald, Producer, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Andrew Hevia, Producer, Moonlight, Janet Yang, President of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences / Producer, The Joy Luck Club and Over the Moon.\n\nThe sound of The Creator with director Gareth Edwards\n\nDirector Gareth Edwards joins us to discuss his visionary new dystopian sci-fi film, The Creator. The movie features some incredible sound work — including a glorious Dolby Atmos® mix — but with some unconventional sound design choices for a science fiction film about artificial intelligence and fully autonomous robots. Joining the director to discuss all this and more are sound designers and supervising sound editors Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van Der Ryn, along with re-recording mixers Tom Ozanich and Dean A. Zupancic.\n\nCreative sound design at Aspen Shortsfest 2023\n\nWhat goes into building a soundtrack for a short film? And collaborating with a sound team when you’re dealing with a short time frame and limited budget?\n\nTune in as Glenn Kiser discusses these questions with a selection of filmmakers from this year’s Aspen Shortsfest — one of the best film festivals in the world for short films and short filmmakers:\n\n- Madli Lääne, director, Dear Passengers\n\n- Nikita Diakur, director, Backflip\n\n- Luis Fernando Puente, director, I Have No Tears, and I Must Cry\n\nThe Miracle of Making a First Film, Hosted by Carlos López E…\n\nDirector Carlos López Estrada (Raya and the Last Dragon) leads an all-star panel of independent filmmakers to discuss perhaps the biggest challenge of any director’s career: Making the first feature.\n\nJoining Carlos are filmmakers: Sian Heder (CODA), Reinaldo Marcus Green (King Richard), Nikyatu Jusu (Nanny), Randall Park (Shortcomings)\n\nThis discussion was streamed live as part of Antigravity Academy’s new Satellite Sessions — “monthly conversations with incredibly exciting figures from the film and TV universe” — co-presented by CAPE USA (Coalition of Asian Pacifics in Entertainment).\n\nThe Emmy-nominated Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiositi…\n\nSPOILER ALERT: Be sure to watch ep. 3 “The Autopsy” before watching this podcast!\n\nExecutive Producer and co-showrunner J. Miles Dale joins us on the podcast to discuss the horror anthology series Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities, which was recently nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards. Joining the conversation are sound and cinematography nominees: Supervising Sound Editor Nelson Ferreira, MPSE, and Director of Photography Anastas Michos, ASC, GSC. Guillermo del Toro's Cabinet of Curiosities is currently streaming on Netflix in Dolby Vision® and Dolby Atmos®.\n\nThe Music of Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nScottish composer Lorne Balfe joins us to discuss his incredible original score for the latest addition of the Mission: Impossible franchise. Guest host Jon Burlingame returns to delve into Lorne’s process — including some on-the-fly performances during his interview — and why he so badly wanted to record elements of the soundtrack in so many locations from around the world.\n\nCinematographer Phedon Papamichael on the latest Indiana Jon…\n\nA new, exclusive interview with Phedon Papamichael, the director of photography of the latest (and final?) installment of the Indiana Jones franchise. He and director James Mangold had to contend with a myriad of unique challenges on this film, including matching and updating the classic “Indy look,” filming more chase scenes than you can count, and working with cutting edge VFX to “de-age” Harrison Ford, making the 80-year old action star look the same age he was when he shot Raiders of the Lost Ark!\n\nWhy Disney and Pixar’s Elemental is their most ambitious mov…\n\nDirector and Co-Writer Peter Sohn and Director of Photography Jean-Claude Kalache join us this week to discuss Pixar’s famously demanding story development process, why this film took years just to get to an outline, how this film deals with some much more grown-up themes than the typical Pixar fare, and the unique challenges of animating two lead characters made up entirely of either a glowing, iridescent flame or a blob of translucent liquid.\n\nDirecting DAHMER with Paris Barclay\n\nFormer DGA president, and one of the most successful directors working in television, Paris Barclay joins us on the podcast to discuss his remarkable work on episodes six and ten of DAHMER, season one of Ryan Murphy’s series, “Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story.” But it was work we almost didn’t get to see, because he was initially very reluctant to take on the job.\n\nRobert Rodriguez (and family) on the making of Hypnotic\n\nIndependent filmmaking legend Robert Rodriguez joins us this week, along with his composer and son Rebel Rodriguez, to discuss their mind-bending new action-thriller, Hypnotic, starring Ben Affleck. We discuss how they finally completed this film after years of Covid-related delays, why the director still prefers Austin over Hollywood (as his production hub), and how he’s made filmmaking a truly family affair.\n\nMaking the Sundance hit Polite Society\n\nPolite Society had one of the biggest debuts at this year’s 2023 Sundance Film Festival and it’s easy to see why. The film is wild, fun, chaotic mashup of genre and style, everything from kung fu action to dark comedy to paranoid spy thriller to coming-of-age drama (and more!) is deftly mixed into this little firecracker of a movie, which was made with an astonishingly small budget during the height of the COVID-19 Omicron surge. Despite these challenges, the film is a masterclass in nailing tone and also turning that tone on a dime. But finding that right balance was no easy feat, requiring lots of trial and error.\n\nThe sound of Evil Dead Rise\n\nToday we have an exclusive interview with the writer and director of Evil Dead Rise, Lee Cronin, along with sound designer and supervising sound editor Peter Albrechtsen. We discuss how they made this super fun addition to the Evil Dead franchise as well as their collaborative process in crafting one of the creepiest soundtracks you’re likely to experience this year.\n\nHow to make an indie film in 2023\n\nMaking an independent film today is even more challenging than it was in its heyday of the 1990s. So we’re bringing you a panel discussion with directors of two of the festival favorites at this year’s SXSW Film Festival. Directors Hannah Pearl Utt (“Cora Bora”) and Emma Westenberg (“You Sing Loud, I Sing Louder”) take a deep-dive into the state of the independent film industry and the challenges involved in making a film in 2023, including how to get the gig in the first place.\n\nCraig Henighan on the Dolby Atmos® Remaster of Pi\n\n6-time Emmy Award winning (Stranger Things, Love Death + Robots) sound designer, supervising sound editor, and re-recording mixer Craig Henighan has worked with director Darren Aronofsky since Requiem for a Dream. And with A24’s 25th anniversary re-release of Pi, Craig discusses the challenges of updating its original soundtrack. The indie film’s razor thin budget only allowed for a four day mix back in 1998, and as a result, Craig had his work cut out for him as he reconstructed and rebuilt the original soundtrack into its stunning new remaster and Dolby Atmos® mix.\n\nThe future of film festivals\n\nIt is a time of great disruption in both independent and studio cinema. Join us for a conversation on the evolving role of film festivals in this dramatically changing landscape. We delved into topics such as the role of streaming platforms and online vs in-person festivals. And tackle questions such as how festivals can develop the next generation of talent, and how exactly DOES one get a film into SXSW or Sundance?\n\nBest Sound nominees: Academy Awards 2023\n\nWelcome to this year’s coverage of the Academy Awards. Like last year, we have compiled interviews from each of the nominees in the Best Sound category. So, if you are an Oscar voter — either as an Academy member or as a fan participating in your annual office pool — you'll have a much better idea of what to watch for and (more importantly) what to listen for as you get to the Best Sound category on your ballot!\n\nThe sound of Babylon\n\nOur coverage of the 2023 Academy Awards continues with another film on the Best Sound shortlist — Babylon. The work of director Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash) is certainly no stranger to awards season, so this is definitely a film to watch out and, in this case, listen for. If you’ve seen the film then you already know it is a bombastic depiction of Hollywood decadence in the time of transition from the silent film era to “the talkies.” And from the what we’ve heard in today’s episode, the production was appropriately over-the-top as well.\n\nThe sound of Avatar: The Way of Water\n\nAs we continue our 2023 Awards coverage, today we are talking to the sound team behind another film on the Best Sound Academy Awards shortlist — Avatar: The Way of Water. As you’ll hear about in detail in this interview, every member of the sound and music teams needed to work very closely together, in a concerted effort, to make the sound of this film as clean and as clear as possible. Or as James Cameron would often put it, “clarity is king.”\n\nThe sound of All Quiet on the Western Front (2022)\n\nThis week we sit down with the writer/director and sound team behind the harrowing new adaptation of All Quiet on the Western Front.
