        "text": "Requirements: PRIOR to the start of principal photography, file a Business Development Program application with the St. Petersburg/Clearwater Film Commission; enter into an agreement with Pinellas County Government; agree upon marketing deliverable items such as the date and location of screening, wording for credits, etc.; and submit an expenditure report or other industry standard accounting summary along with all invoices and receipts. Film SPC will provide a complete list of all contractually mandated deliverables.\n\nQualified Spend: Qualified spend includes local expenditures, such as above-the-line and below-the-line wages, location fees, hotels, food, construction materials, props, travel, etc. purchased or rented from a business with a local address. Nonresident wages can qualify through the use of a local production services company.\n\nSummary: This program is administered on a combination of a first-come, first-served basis and a review/approval of the production project by the film commission. Productions are evaluated based on size of the budget, local spend, and marketing value to the county. Pinellas County, St. Petersburg/Clearwater area, offers a Business Development Marketing Program that offers a rebate of up to 30% on qualified expenditures, above-the-line and below-the-line wages, occurring within Pinellas County\\'s 24 municipalities. The initial 10% is based on local expenditures. An additional 10-20% is based upon tourism deliverables such as saying the name of the area in the project, on screen beauty shots of beaches, landmarks, etc. Based upon the information provided, the Film Commission will determine the cash rebate amount, providing an initial dollar amount. This initial amount is contingent upon the monies spent locally and the production\\'s traditional and social media marketing value.

OPSTC is a refundable tax credit equal to 21.5% of all qualifying production expenditures incurred in Ontario. The OCASE credit is equal to 18% of eligible Ontario labor expenditures that are attributable to eligible computer animation and special effects activities performed in Ontario. A producer can claim the OCASE tax credit and the OPSTC credit for a combined rate of 39.5% on the portion of qualifying labor directly involved in a filmed scene that involves visual effects (e.g. blue or green screen shooting, plate shots, digital scanning or motion capture).

Utah uses the term “dollars left in the state” to define qualifying expenditures. As such, this term limits the amount that qualifies on payments made to nonresident workers to the income tax paid or withheld from such payments. Payments to a loan out company owned by a nonresident do not qualify for the incentive.\n\nSummary: This program is not administered on a first-come, first-served basis. Projects that spend $500,000 to $1 million and see that at least 75% of cast and crew are Utah residents (excluding extras and five principal cast members) may qualify for a 20% cash rebate. Productions spending $1 million or more in-state may earn a 20% tax credit without the cast and crew percentage restriction.

Both programs require preproduction to begin within 90 days following the approval of the application.\n\nQualified Spend: For both programs, qualified spend includes: goods and services leased or purchased in Virginia from a Virginia vendor (for goods with a purchase price of $25,000 or more, the eligible amount is the purchase price less the fair market value at the time the production is completed); and the first $1 million of salary paid to each resident or nonresident or their loan out company. For the grant program, certain negotiated deliverables can be considered for eligibility. The Credit Allocation Letter of Intent will indicate the beginning and ending dates for qualifying expenses.\n\nSummary: This program is not administered on a first-come, first-served basis. Virginia offers a refundable tax credit equal to 15% or 20% of qualifying expenditures in Virginia including the first $1 million of salary for each individual whether a resident or nonresident.

Not more than $40 million per calendar year for 2024 may be awarded under the MPP and MTP tax credit programs. The maximum credit a single MPP project may earn is $7 million (which will automatically be waived for a feature-length film or television series if funds are available at the time of initial certification) while each MTP project is capped at $5 million.

Payments for services provided by principal actors, whether received directly or through a loan out company, are capped at $15 million collectively.\n\nSummary: This program is not administered on a first-come, first-served basis. The Film Office will approve projects based on an analysis of certain criteria. Pennsylvania offers a transferable tax credit of up to 30% on nearly all production expenses incurred in Pennsylvania. If transferred, the transferee may not carry forward the credit to future years. In any fiscal year, the department may award up to 30% of the tax credits available in the next fiscal year, 20% of credits available in the second successive fiscal year, and 10% of credits available in the third successive fiscal year.

Loan outs must be registered with the Secretary of State.\n\nQualified Spend: Qualified spend consists of costs incurred during preproduction, production, and postproduction in Oregon including but not limited to: the purchase or rental of equipment; food and lodging; real property and permits; and the first $1 million of salaries, wages, benefits and fees paid to each resident or nonresident individual or loan out company for services provided in Oregon. Costs incurred prior to the film office receiving the production’s application will not qualify for the incentive.\n\nSummary: This program is administered on a first-come, first-served basis. The OPIF program offers cash rebates of 25% on goods and services paid to Oregon registered companies and 20% of Oregon-based payroll. There is an additional “regional” incentive for productions shooting some of their schedule outside a 30-mile radius from the center of Burnside Bridge in Portland. The annual funding cap is $20 million for each fiscal year (July 1 – June 30). The per project cap is equal to 50% of the annual funding. The GOLR rebate program is essentially a refund of the Oregon income tax withheld on qualifying payroll (up to a maximum of 6.2%) and, as such, it is not capped. The OPIF and GOLR programs are both scheduled to sunset December 31, 2029.\n\nRequirements: Apply during the application window PRIOR to the start of principal photography in Oklahoma; 45 days prior to the start of principal photography, provide proof that 100% of the budget is funded; incur at least $50,000 in qualified spend; film at least one day of principal photography in Oklahoma; for the TV pilot/season uplifts, at least 75% of the pilot or 75% of the series season must be filmed in Oklahoma; submit the Final Rebate Application within 90 days of the completion of production or the last qualified Oklahoma expenditure (whichever comes later); and include a five second screen cred"
