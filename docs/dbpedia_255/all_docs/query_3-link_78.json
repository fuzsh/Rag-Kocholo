Think I had a touch of food poisoning. Oh I was sick. Really really sick. It frightened me to death because I couldn’t breathe properly, and with COPD it’s difficult to breathe, you know, straining your throat. Yeah it was awful. Feeling better now. Better than what it was, Friday night, that’s for sure.\n\nIt was awful, really awful. It was some meat that was off, so I had a touch of food poisoning. It was horrendous. Oh it was just awful, and of course it was- yeah, not good. But feeling better now anyway, feeling a lot better today, which helps doesn’t it. But can’t go out anywhere today, it’s raining, and it’s rubbish weather, so what do you do? Just stay at home, stay in, watch TV or do something. It’s nice to have me grandkids up yesterday so that was good. They always make my day. So proud of them. Really proud of them."
