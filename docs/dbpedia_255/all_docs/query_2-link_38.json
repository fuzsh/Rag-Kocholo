        "text": "On a street in Sydney's wealthiest council area, Stephen Deer is one of 32 residents living at a boarding house which has been a refuge for low-income earners since the end of World War II.\n\nBut a development proposal could end the 70-year-old's \"absolutely joyful\" decade living at Selwyn Street in Paddington.\n\nMr Deer and his \"family\" of other boarding house residents, some of whom have lived there for more than 50 years, stare down eviction and potential homelessness.\n\n\"There's a stroke victim who lives up the front — double stroke double heart attack — another fellow next door, Richard in his 80s,\" Mr Deer said.\n\n\"Can you imagine living out in the park? Because there is no affordable housing, we're all on a pension.\n\nThe residents have almost no protection from the plans of developer LFD Developments (LFDD), who purchased the boarding house last year.\n\nLFDD wants to turn the property into four luxury apartments expected to house eight people.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe City of Sydney Council unanimously rejected the application, laying out 10 reasons in their decision paper, including that it fails to adequately address \"retention of existing affordable rental housing of the State Planning Policy\".\n\nNow, the boarding house residents are at the centre of a landmark case due before the NSW Land and Environment Court in December, which will determine whether a state planning law protects residents of privately-owned boarding houses, which are typically – if unofficial – affordable housing.\n\nThe City of Sydney estimates there are 4,000 people living in boarding houses in its local government area (LGA), and the Inner South estimates a similar number.\n\nUnder state planning laws, residents who have long paid affordable rent but who do not live in official social or affordable housing are protected only by \"flimsy\" policies, easily and frequently circumnavigated by developers.\n\nThe NSW budget promised 30,000 new homes and a historic investment in social housing.\n\nCity of Sydney Council and social housing services want to know what is being done to preserve affordable housing, if not in name than in function, which already exists on the market.\n\nBoarding houses fill gap where social housing fails\n\nRodney Boyton has also lived at the Selwyn Street boarding house for more than a decade and worries he will have \"nowhere to go\".\n\n\"It's just like a little small town, everyone knows each other and looks out for each other,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don't know what my plan would be.\"\n\nLFDD did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt is not the first time an affordable boarding house has been redeveloped, pricing existing residents out.\n\nThe most recent City of Sydney Housing Audit found 64 boarding house rooms had been lost in the 12 months to June last year.\n\nKaren Hunter from the Newtown Neighbourhood Boarding House Outreach Service said there was also a slow-but-steady decline of boarding house stock in the inner west.\n\n\"People who rely on them are people who are low income earners, but especially people who are on government benefits,\" she said.\n\nThe median wait time for social housing in Sydney was more than two-and-a-half years as of March, according to data from the Department of Communities and Justice.\n\nIn the last year, the Newtown service has helped to find new homes for 75 people who had been living at a boarding house in Dulwich Hill that closed suddenly.\n\nThe Dulwich Hill residents, many whom were elderly, were initially given only three weeks to find somewhere new to live.\n\nJust 26 were offered places in social housing.\n\n\"It did absolutely highlight the vulnerability of that cohort,\" Ms Hunter said.\n\n\"There is the boarding house act but it is flimsy protection for people, they don't have very much rights.\n\n\"As we see this tier of housing just slowly erode, there is nothing coming up to replace it.\n\nCouncil blames state, state handballs back to council\n\nThe State Environmental Planning Policy (SEPP) overrules local councils like the City of Sydney, which has already knocked back the development application for the Paddington site.\n\nWith the matter heading to court, there are calls from some councillors and the community for council to use their developer fund to purchase the property themselves.\n\nThe fund requires builders to contribute a percentage of the value of their development which is then used to build affordable housing.\n\nLord Mayor Clover Moore rejected the idea and said the current model of subsidising land for social housing providers was more effective.\n\nShe insisted the council had done its part trying to protect boarding houses and accused the former and current state government of letting down vulnerable boarding house residents by failing to update legislation regarding development.\n\n\"We do not want our city to just be an enclave of the rich,\" she said.\n\n\"We really need the government to do its bit and provide laws that allow us to refuse development applications when it involves loss of an important type of housing for the city.\n\n\"Unless the government gives us the backing we need, then we can't do our jobs.\"\n\nHousing Minister Rose Jackson's office said the Selwyn Street boarding house was not part of her portfolio because it was not social housing, and directed questions to Planning Minister Paul Scully.\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure said \"residential development applications are a matter for local council\".\n\nIt is a bureaucratic roundabout Ms Hunter is all too familiar with.\n\n\"Our concern is that people are falling through the cracks,\" she said.\n\nCommunity throws support behind boarding house residents\n\nA petition to save the boarding houses in Paddington has reached nearly 10,000 signatures.\n\nAs well as asking the council to purchase the property, locals want protections for boarding house residents firmed up, and are worried the developer could let the property fall into disrepair and deemed uninhabitable.\n\nMike Mannix has lived up the street since 2000 and said the men who live at the boarding houses were valued friends and neighbours.\n\n\"This is the wrong thing to do, it is morally wrong, and that is why we are standing in the way of it,\" he said.\n\nMr Deer said the boarding house residents had been struck by the community support.\n\n\"We thought wow, we are cared about,\" he said.\n\nBut while the number of signs on the terraces grow, so too does a deepening sense of dread among the men who rely on the cheap boarding house rent.\n\n\"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know,\" Mr Deer said.\n\n\"I don't know where we will go.\""
