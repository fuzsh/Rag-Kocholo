        "text": "Hey r/fitness,\n\nI am Steven Low, author of “Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength” released around 1.5 months ago.\n\nShort bio: Former gymnast. Performed for Gymkana for 5 years, and currently an assistant coach of 3 years with Gymkana, who recently appeared on America's Got Talent. Degree in Biochemistry from UMCP, currently at UMB for Physical Therapy.\n\nI write for Eat. Move. Improve, and have written some articles such as The Fundamentals of Bodyweight Strength Training, Shoes, Sitting, and Lower Body Dysfunctions, So you hurt your lower back, A closer look at vitamin D, and On tendonitis which have appeared here.\n\nI will continue fielding questions all throughout Saturday.\n\nNote: Make sure you ask your questions in response to me, as I will be checking new mail for ones to answer.\n\nAdditionally, and I almost forgot I would like to say that Jim Bathurst (BeastSkills) and Roger Harrell (DrillsandSkills) are people who I should've put in the acknowledgements section of the book."
