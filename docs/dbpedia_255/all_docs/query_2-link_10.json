        "text": "Hey r/bodyweightfitness,\n\nI am Steven Low, author of “Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength (Second Edition)” released around 1.5 months ago.\n\nShort bio: Steven Low is a former gymnast, coach, and the author of the Overcoming Gravity. Steven holds a BS in Biochemistry from the University of Maryland, College Park, as well as a Doctorate of Physical Therapy from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. During his time at UMCP, Steven performed with Gymkana, an exhibitional gymnastics troupe. Since then, he has coached Gymkana athletes and serves as a senior trainer for Dragon Door’s Progressive Calisthenics Certification (PCC). I have a background in gymnastics, parkour, and climbing with a little breakdancing thrown in.\n\nI've also been a mod of bodyweightfitness for a while now and try to help out as much as I can. :)\n\nWebsite: http://stevenlow.org/\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/stevenlowog/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/eshlow\n\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/eshlow\n\nPopular articles I've written (many that appear on here, and a few that are in the process of being updated!):\n\nThe Fundamentals of Bodyweight Strength Training\n\nShoes, Sitting, and Lower Body Dysfunctions\n\nOvercoming Tendonitis\n\nIntegrating Barbell and Bodyweight Training\n\nPrilepin Tables for Bodyweight Strength Isometric and Eccentric Exercises\n\nI also have a subreddit over at r/overcominggravity if you want to ask specific questions about the book!\n\nMake sure you ask your questions in response to me, as I will be checking new mail for ones to answer.\n\nI will field questions from the book, future articles, future projects, training, injuries, and anything else such as critique.\n\nNote: I gotta drive about 45 minutes a couple times today, but I'll still be answering questions when I can."
