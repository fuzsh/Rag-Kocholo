        "text": "Stephen Low, IMAX filmmaker\n\nWith big diesels, beautiful landscapes, and unique camera shots, the documentary Train Time takes the IMAX audience on an adventure from the crew’s point of view. Those working behind the scenes of the BNSF Railway openly share their triumphs and struggles as they battle brutal weather-related conditions, unforeseen delays, and much more.\n\nWith computer-generated imagery, along with aerial shots taken from helicopters to photos captured trackside, Director Stephen Low presents viewers with a 5,000-mile-long round trip, from Chicago to L.A., highlighting the past, present, and future of railroading in the United States. But how did his team choreograph all this footage into one cohesive, family-friendly film?\n\n“To make Train Time, BNSF, one of the world’s great railroads, gave us unlimited access over a period of three years to film on their massive 32,000 mile, 28 state network,” says Low. “I doubt if that’s ever happened before, at least not to that extent.”"
