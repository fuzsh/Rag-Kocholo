        "text": "All students registered on-campus in at least one for-credit course at the University of Alberta Edmonton Campuses during the Fall, Winter and/or Spring/Summer term will be assessed the U-Pass fee.\n\nThe following students are exempt from the U-Pass:\n\nStudents at Augustana\n\nStudents enrolled only in the Executive MBA program\n\nGraduate students designated as Off-campus Thesis students\n\nFaculty of Extension Students (including those in the English Language Program)\n\nStudents who are exempt from the U-Pass program are not eligible to opt-in.\n\nStudents completing their Co-op or Practicum term in Edmonton and who have not been assessed the U-Pass fee, are asked to fill out a Service Request Form. Students will receive a notification from the Registrar's Office regarding their eligibility for a U-Pass for that semester. Please note that the Spring/Summer Service Request Form is available in late April, the Fall Service Request Form is available in late August and the Winter form is available in December.\n\nStudents can apply for an exemption to the U-Pass if they fall into one of the categories listed below:\n\nAn employee of one of the participating transit systems,\n\nA student with a valid disabled transit registration,\n\nA student with a valid CNIB registration card,\n\nA student also registered at either NAIT, MacEwan University, NorQuest, or\n\nA thesis student conducting research out of the transit service area for more than 2 months of the term (you must provide a letter from your supervisor confirming this with your application).\n\nTo apply for an exemption\n\nPlease submit theU-Pass Service Exemption Form.\n\nIf you are a student on a co-op or work experience program and your placement is outside of the transit service area, please go to your co-op or work experience office to apply for an exemption to the U-Pass.\n\nDeadlines to apply\n\nDecember 31 for the Fall term, April 30 for the Winter term, and August 31 for the Spring/Summer term.\n\nIf you intend to apply for an exemption, do not pick up your Arc Card\n\nThe Universal Transit Pass (U-Pass) is an initiative of the Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Association, the local transit authorities, and the University of Alberta to deliver affordable and sustainable transit to the students of the University of Alberta. In 2007, students of the University voted to accept a mandatory fee assessment for the U-Pass.\n\nThe \"insufficient funds\" error indicates that there is no active U-Pass attached to your Arc Card and means that you were not assessed the U-Pass fee. You will need to confirm that you have been assessed the U-Pass fee before using your Arc Card.\n\nThe \"low funds\" error often occurs near the end of the term and is a warning to users that the U-Pass is about to reach the end of its validity. If you are assessed the U-Pass fee for the following term, your Arc Card will update and continue to work automatically.\n\nTo confirm your assessment, go to Bear Tracks > Financial Account > Fee Assessment.\n\nU-Pass is a group discount program, which lowers the cost of transit for University of Alberta students.\n\nThe U-Pass program is available for all students, graduate and undergraduate, registered in classes in the Fall, Winter and Spring/Summer Terms. The U-Pass is much lower than the cost of purchasing monthly passes for the same period of time because costs are spread over a large participant base.\n\nU-Pass fees are collected by the University and transferred to transit providers to help fund the transit service.\n\nAll undergraduate students registered in EITHER a Spring or a Summer term class will be assessed the U-Pass fee. Students registered in both Spring and Summer terms may notice that they are assessed the U-Pass fee twice. This double assessment will be corrected automatically after the Spring Add/Delete deadline. No further action is required.\n\nStudents registered in a Spring or Summer class are able to continue to use their current ARC card. The pass is valid May 1 - August 31.\n\nIf you want to confirm that you are assessed the U-Pass fee, please check your Account Details or Fee Assessment in Bear Tracks for the appropriate terms. You can find these under the Financials Menu.\n\nThe fees for the U-Pass will be assessed for each Fall, Winter and Spring/Summer term that a student is registered and will be reported on your fee assessment on Bear Tracks. The opt-out deadline for the U-Pass is the end of the term; December 31 for the Fall term, April 30 for the Winter term and August 31 for Spring/Summer term.\n\nThe fee for new or replacement Arc Cards are not included in your Fee Assessment and must be paid at the time of card pickup.\n\nThe cost for the U-Pass for Fall 2021, Winter 2022 and Spring/Summer 2022 will be $180 per term for all undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nGraduate students in:\n\ncourse-based Master's programs will be assessed the U-Pass fees during any term which they are registered for courses. The U-Pass fee is assessed once (in Spring) for both the Spring and Summer terms.\n\nthesis-based Master's and PhD programs admitted after Fall 2011, will be assessed the U-Pass fee at the start of Fall, Winter, and Spring terms. The U-Pass fee is assessed once (in Spring) for both the Spring and Summer terms.\n\nthesis-based Master's and PhD programs admitted prior to Fall 2011, who have Winter term registration(s), are considered active students through Spring/Summer terms and therefore will be assessed the Spring/Summer U-Pass fee in the Winter term."
