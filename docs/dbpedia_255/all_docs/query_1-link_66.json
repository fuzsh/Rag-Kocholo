        "text": "Steven Soderbergh\n\nAmerican film director\n\nRecent News\n\nJuly 23, 2024, 7:02 AM ET (The Hollywood Reporter)\n\nSteven Soderbergh Spy Drama ‘Black Bag’ Set for March 2025 Release\n\nSteven Soderbergh (born January 14, 1963, Atlanta, Georgia, U.S.) is an American film director who worked in disparate genres, directing both idiosyncratic independent films and popular box-office successes.\n\nEarly life\n\nSoderbergh spent much of his adolescence in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where his father was a professor and administrator at Louisiana State University. Soderbergh enrolled in a film animation course at the university while still a high school student, and it was then that he began making short films. After graduating from high school he moved to Hollywood to pursue a career as a screenwriter, but his efforts were met with rejection. A year later he returned to Baton Rouge, where he worked at a video arcade while continuing to write and shoot low-budget short films.\n\nBreakthrough: sex, lies, and videotape; Erin Brockovich; and Traffic\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nOscar-Worthy Movie Trivia\n\nA change of fortune came in 1986 when Soderbergh was asked to develop one such project into a full-length promotional film for the rock band Yes. This relatively small beginning emboldened him to set out for Hollywood once more. He then completed the celebrated sex, lies, and videotape (1989), which explores the complexities of modern relationships. The film was a surprise hit at the Cannes film festival that year, picking up three awards, including the Palme d’Or, and Soderbergh earned an Academy Award nomination for best original screenplay. Kafka (1991), King of the Hill (1993), and The Underneath (1995) followed, but they were not as well received. Soderbergh then shifted away from traditional narrative film with Gray’s Anatomy (1996)—a filmed monologue by Spalding Gray—and the experimental comedy Schizopolis (1996), in which he also starred.\n\n(Read Martin Scorsese’s Britannica essay on film preservation.)\n\nIn 1998 Soderbergh again found commercial and critical success with Out of Sight, the story of a bank heist and unlikely romance between the lead characters, played by George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. The Limey (1999), a gritty gangster tale, enjoyed similar accolades. In 2000 Soderbergh established himself as a leading director with the release of Erin Brockovich and Traffic. The former was based on the true story of a woman (played by Julia Roberts) who discovers that a power company is polluting the groundwater of a small town and aids the residents in a successful lawsuit. Traffic, a pseudo-documentary, depicts the lives of people involved in the drug trade, from users to law-enforcement officials. Both of the films earned Soderbergh Academy Award nominations for best director; he won for Traffic.\n\nOcean’s series and Magic Mike\n\nIn 2002 Soderbergh directed Ocean’s Eleven, a remake of a 1960 crime-caper film, starring some of Hollywood’s most prominent actors, including Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon. That film, along with its sequels, Ocean’s Twelve (2004) and Ocean’s Thirteen (2007), was highly profitable. After the poorly received films Full Frontal (2002) and Solaris (2002), Soderbergh directed Bubble (2005), a drama about three factory workers, one of whom is eventually murdered. The film, which featured amateur actors, was simultaneously released in theatres, on cable television, and on DVD. During this time he also created the television series K Street (2003), a drama starring actual political consultants James Carville and Mary Matalin as partially fictionalized versions of themselves.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Shot in black-and-white to evoke the atmosphere of an early studio film, it tells the story of a reporter (Clooney) covering the Potsdam Conference during World War II while trying to trace an old paramour (Cate Blanchett). Soderbergh then released his lengthy treatment of the life of Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, starring Benicio del Toro in the title role. Originally conceived of as two films, Che (2008) was eventually released as both a single film and as two separate films entitled, respectively, Che Part One: The Argentine and Che Part Two: Guerrilla. The first film depicts Guevara’s involvement in the Cuban Revolution, and the second traces his ill-fated attempt to foment rebellion in Bolivia.\n\nThe Girlfriend Experience (2009) featured Sasha Grey, a pornographic actress, as a prostitute. Despite its provocative premise, the drama mainly concerns the character’s quotidian activities. The film was adapted as a television series (2016– ), which Soderbergh executive produced. In 2009 Soderbergh also directed The Informant!, a comedy based on a true story about an unreliable whistle-blower (Damon). He then directed And Everything Is Going Fine (2010), a documentary about the life of Spalding Gray, and the big-budget ensemble thriller Contagion (2011), which portrayed the rapid spread of a deadly airborne virus. The adrenaline-fueled spy film Haywire (2011) focused on a female covert-operations specialist.\n\nIn 2012 Soderbergh had another hit with the good-humoured Magic Mike, about the world of male stripping. The following year he helmed Side Effects, a thriller in which a woman’s dependency on antidepressants has criminal consequences, and Behind the Candelabra, about a romantic relationship that the entertainer Liberace (Michael Douglas) began with a young man (Damon) in the late 1970s. The latter was produced by and for the cable network HBO, though it was released theatrically outside the United States; Soderbergh won an Emmy Award for his direction.\n\nLater credits\n\nDespite much success, Soderbergh announced that he was retiring from the big screen in 2013, citing “how badly directors are treated.” He turned his focus to television, producing and directing episodes of the series The Knick (2014–15), about an early 20th-century New York City hospital. However, in 2017 he returned to cinema with Logan Lucky, a heist comedy about siblings who decide to rob a NASCAR racetrack. He then directed the basketball drama High Flying Bird (2019) and The Laundromat (2019), a farce about the Panama Papers scandal that featured Meryl Streep. He reunited with the actress for Let Them All Talk (2020), about an award-winning author who goes on a cruise with several old friends. Soderbergh’s next film, No Sudden Move (2021), featured Don Cheadle and Benicio Del Toro as small-time criminals in 1950s Detroit. In 2022 he helmed KIMI, a thriller about an agoraphobic tech analyst who believes she has heard a violent crime. The following year Soderbergh returned to the world of male strippers with Magic Mike’s Last Dance, which starred Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek.\n\nSoderbergh published a memoir, Getting Away with It; or, The Further Adventures of the Luckiest Bastard You Ever Saw, in 1999.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Encyclopaedia Britannica."
