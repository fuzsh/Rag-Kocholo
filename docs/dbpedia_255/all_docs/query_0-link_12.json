Adam Kinzinger, who broke ranks and repudiated Donald Trump.\n\nThere’s also world premieres for Marah Strauch and Bryce Leavitt’s Space Cowboy, about the world of stunt skydiving and “free-fall” cinematography; directors Joanne Robertson and Neil Diamond’s So Surreal: Behind the Masks, which foregrounds efforts to return cultural artifacts to the Yup’ik and Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw nations; and Halima Elkhatabi’s Living Together, a film that captures apartment seekers in Montreal chasing the ideal roommate.\n\nThere’s also world debuts for Ted Passon’s Patrice: The Movie; Lina Vdovîi and Radu Ciorniciuc’s Tata, about co-director Vdovîi trying to reconnect with her estranged father; Anastasiia Bortuali’s Temporary Shelter, about Ukrainian refugees making a new life in Iceland after the 2022 Russian invasion of their homeland; Santiago Esteinou’s The Freedom of Fierro; The Speed Cubers director Sue Kim’s latest doc, The Last of the Sea Women, about elderly female free divers; and Ali Weinstein’s Your Tomorrow.\n\nTIFF’s Doc program in all booked 21 titles from 24 countries, many of which are sales titles. That includes a North American premiere for Raoul Peck’s latest film, Ernest Cole: Lost and Found, which bowed in Cannes and portrays the life of a pioneering Black freelance photographer in South Africa. Peck world premiered his James Baldwin documentary I Am Not Your Negro at TIFF in 2016.\n\nToronto is also giving a Canadian premiere to No Other Land, from directors Basel Adra, a young Palestinian activist, and Yuval Abraham, an Israeli journalist, who faced a brutal backlash after their prize-winning acceptance speech at the Berlin Film Festival for a documentary about the Israeli government’s attempts to expel Palestinians from the West Bank.\n\nToronto earlier announced documentaries elsewhere in the 2024 event, including R.J. Culter and David Furnish’s Elton John: Never Too Late; Cosima Spender’s Andrea Bocelli: Because I Believe; and Thom Zimny’s Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band.\n\nA full list of TIFF Docs titles follows:\n\nA Sisters’ Tale, Leila Amini, International Premiere\n\nBlue Road – The Edna O’Brien Story, Sinéad O’Shea, World Premiere\n\nErnest Cole: Lost and Found, Raoul Peck.
