        "text": "“LOVED IT!”—Chris Kipp, Pittsburgh, PA\n\n“Train Time is a completely compelling work, a visual and sonic tour de train.”—Karl Mohr, Toronto ON\n\n“Ten on 10!”\n\n—Sam, Montreal QC\n\n“This film was fantastic!.”—Matt Ahlenius, McPherson KS\n\n“An absolute masterpiece.”—Rob Amyot, Montreal QC\n\n“Train Time made our jaws drop.”—Pat, Montreal QC\n\n“Train Time blew me away in every way.”—Dan, North Bay ON\n\n“It was magnificent, awesome…”—Sharon, Newton Centre MA\n\nTrailer\n\nAbout the Film\n\nJoin the crew of a giant freight train for an eye-popping, music-infused journey across America. Giant diesels, spectacular terrain, tens of thousands of miles of track—and millions of pounds of freight that can’t wait.\n\nCreated by the director of the celebrated IMAX® Experience Rocky Mountain Express and his team, Train Time is captured on 15/70mm motion picture film, the world’s largest film format for exhibition in IMAX® and other giant screen theaters.\n\nTo deliver the cargo, Train Time propels audiences through the rugged beauty and vastness of the American landscape, revealing the brutal challenges of railroading, as well as secrets of the art and science of running the greatest trains. Weaving together present-tech and racing steam locomotives, grit, glamour and glorious landscapes, Train Time immerses viewers in a grand tapestry of American railroading.\n\nClimb aboard for the biggest adventure on wheels.\n\n“The best IMAX film I ever saw!!!”\n\n—David, Levittown PA\n\n“Train Time honestly gave me goosebumps. I thought the ending was so personal and it made me want to watch the film again. I loved the beginning, worth seeing just for that sequence alone. Going through all of the different weather conditions it made me realize that there’s a lot more to the railroad than I ever imagined and I’ve seen trains around my whole life. It made me recognize that there are people hard at work every day and I just want to know their stories now.”\n\n—Ellena & Riley, Boston MA\n\n“We are so bowled over by the wonders of Train Time that we plan to see it again this week and probably several more times.”\n\n—John & Eva Bristol, Victoria BC\n\n“Train Time is now our new favorite film! The trains, the scenery, the information, but most of all, the joy, grabbed us from the first moments of the film.”\n\n—Keith and Jean Mercer, Kearney MO\n\nGallery: In the Film\n\nClick on an image to open full-screen gallery.\n\nWhere to see Train Time\n\nClimb Aboard!

Train Time will capture your interest even if trains are not particularly interesting to you. The cinematography is absolutely outstanding and really draws you into the story/information being conveyed. The scenery and overall feel of the film absolutely left me wanting to watch more. Fantastic movie experience and would recommend it to anyone!\n\n—Natasha, Columbia MO\n\n“The views inside of the cabs and outside of the trains, the crews working, the scenery of the trains moving across the nation, the exploded diagrams, the information, the music—everything about this movie was spectacular.\n\n—Kyler, age 15, Columbia MO\n\n“What a beautiful film and now my kids know what I do for a living.”\n\n—Dane, age 38, Edmonton AB\n\n“Train Time is a completely compelling work, a visual and sonic tour de train. The footage was truly amazing, fantastic and a finely crafted storyline, finely-polished juggernaut. I see it as a total film.”\n\n—Karl Mohr, age 56, Toronto ON\n\n“My 6-year-old son and I just went to see Train Time in Pittsburgh and we LOVED IT! the scenery was beautiful, the workers were diverse, and the songs were added to our playlist.”\n\n—Chris Kipp, age 40, Pittsburgh PA\n\nMultiple thumbs up for Train Time from Pittsburgh celebrity Chancellor Humphrey : https://www.instagram.com/p/CnwzAN5gyw7/\n\nRail enthusiast Paul Springkowski ‘the train guy’ visits Pittsburgh for a Train Time experience at the Carnegie Science Center: https://www.tiktok.com/@paul.thetrainguy/video/7138519589960404270?lang=en\n\n“The experience out-lived the film.”\n\n—Paul Springkowski, Cleveland OH\n\n“Ten on 10!”\n\n—Sam, age 30, Montreal QC\n\n“The best IMAX film I ever saw!!!”\n\n—David, Levittown PA\n\n“The cinematography is absolutely beautiful, so freakin’ crisp and clean!! My favorite is the kids and the shots of the actual conductors, it made me feel a part of the action and it was so personal! The addition of the kids at the beginning was like the passion moving through many generations and I loved that, so so cute. The national geographic or discovery channel vibe with the opening shots of the inner workings and the landscape shots too. Incredibly well done and beautiful. “\n\n—Taylor, age 21, Cleveland OH\n\n“I’ve been to see Train Time four times and I get something new out of it each time. I brought my grandchildren to the film and now they love trains, just as I did. The film has even inspired us to build a model railway together!”\n\n—Anonymous viewer, Victoria BC\n\n“This film was fantastic! Our 5, 4, and 2-year-old boys loved watching and learning about the trains through this excellent IMAX film. The music was great too, the boys wanted to get up and dance. They were singing the songs later in the day, having only seen the film once! Our 5-year-old said this is his favorite train movie, he is the ultimate critic when it comes to train movies. My wife really enjoyed the movie as well. We’ll recommending this to all our friends and family! Thank you for creating this fantastic film, it will be remembered for a very long time.”\n\n—Matt Ahlenius, McPherson KS\n\n“Train Time is an absolute masterpiece of a film. The way the film was shot is absolutely stunning. You really feel like you’re on board these trains with the crew; it’s a Masterclass in filmmaking and a must watch for all!!” I got a fun and educational train ride across America for the price of a film ticket. What else can you ask for!”\n\n—Rob Amyot, age 32, Montreal QC\n\n“I recently took my children to see the film Train Time in Kansas City Missouri. The film is something deeper than just a train film. For me I had the enjoyment of sharing a trip across our beautiful country and learning at the same time. The film exposes my children to travel and adventure and team work along with mum and dad.”\n\n—Janet, Kansas City MO\n\n“Train Time blew me away in every way. I stand and applaud the working-class heroes. Makes me appreciate a freight train.”\n\n—Dan, age 52, North Bay ON\n\n“Those kids are adorable in the film–our future railroaders. I didn’t like trains–now I do.”\n\n—Rita, age 72, Ile Bizzard QC\n\n“Train Time made our jaws drop. I don’t know that we’ve ever seen form and content dance like this in an IMAX film before.”\n\n—Pat, age 47, Montreal QC\n\n“The presence of women throughout the film moved me! Most assume that engineers and train workers are white men, so the diversity displayed was appreciated. I love the black female railroaders; this perks my curiosity because it is an entirely untold perspective. I loved the film—is there such a thing as 12 on 10?!”\n\n—Leslie, school teacher, Marietta GA\n\n“Train Time was very nicely shot and the angles and background music and everything made it easy for me to pay attention and I don’t even like trains. There’s always something to look at and if it was a two-hour long movie, I’d watch it. It literally looks unreal with the amount of detail.”\n\n—Helena, age 22, Cleveland OH\n\n“The cinematography is outstanding. I never knew that freight trains are so stunningly modern with their control centres that look like NASA mission control. The film rekindled my childhood fascination: the narration, sound and cinematography were pure magic.”\n\n—Norman, age 38\n\n“Train Time honestly gave me goosebumps. I thought the ending was so personal and it made me want to watch the film again. I loved the beginning, worth seeing just for that sequence alone. Going through all of the different weather conditions it made me realize that there’s a lot more to the railroad than I ever imagined and I’ve seen trains around my whole life. It made me recognize that there are people hard at work every day and I just want to know their stories now.”\n\n—Ellena & Riley, Boston MA\n\n“Train Time IMAX movie–What a beauty! In every artistic, historical and factual sense. Our eyes are filled with sublime images, shots from all angles, the compositions of multiple shots, close-up views, perspective, panoramic, aerial, various seasons, colors. The paintings followed one another by their beauty. Well done!\n\n—Egidio Vincelli, age 74; Quebec Artist\n\n“My father-in-law (age 83) cried at the end overwhelmed by the film’s story & images and nostalgia. The film is simply beautiful in so many ways.”\n\n—Corey, Edmonton AB\n\n“(I was) in awe at the majesty of the freight trains, and the family of railroaders that keep them rolling. This is perfect for a guy like me. It’s got trains, majestic landscapes, human stories and cool animated explainers. I felt like I was 11 again. Train Time is a good time.”\n\n—Ian, age 32\n\n“I took [my family] to Boston’s Museum of Science to see Train Time at their huge Omni Theater. It was magnificent, awesome, and created a response I don’t adequately have words for. The scenery was just breathtaking. Nothing like the huge wraparound Omni theater to experience this! I can’t imagine how you all filmed it. Impossible! Thank you, thank you, thank you!”\n\n—Sharon, age 78. Newton Centre MA\n\n“My 15-year-old autistic son is obsessed with trains and we both very much enjoyed watching Train Time. As soon as we stood up from our seats in the theatre he was asking me to buy him the DVD (we also watched Rocky Mountain Express at the San Diego Fleet Science Center and then later bought the DVD). Do you know if and when Train Time will be released on DVD? He asks me all the time, lol. Or if it will be available for streaming soon?”\n\n—Michelle Bannasch, San Diego CA\n\n“My 6-yr-old son and I really enjoyed seeing Train Time for his birthday. A very special birthday we will remember always. The scenery was beautiful, the workers were diverse, and the songs were added to our ‘train’ playlist.”\n\n—Chris, age 40, Pittsburgh PA\n\n“We are so bowled over by the wonders of Train Time that we plan to see it again this week and probably several more times.”\n\n—John & Eva Bristol, Victoria BC\n\n“It’s a beautiful film, with many, many amazing shots, just like Rocky Mountain Express. Aerial shots are gorgeous and visually stunning.”\n\n—Dr Todd McConnell, age 70, Montreal QC\n\n“Train Time is now our new favourite film! The trains, the scenery, the information, but most of all, the joy, grabbed us from the first moments of the film. We are admitted train buffs, but we believe anyone would enjoy this film with its wonderful production values and great scenery, but also benefit from the technical and general information provided. What a way to spend 50 gripping minutes—we only wish it were longer! Thanks for producing this fabulous film!”\n\n—Keith and Jean Mercer, Kearney MO\n\n“Really loved Train Time and I’d love my children to watch it over and over.”\n\n—Justin Davis, Pittsburgh PA\n\n“Thanks for the best railroad movie I have ever seen. You’ve told a story about railroading that few people really know.”\n\n—Bob Leilich, The Woodlands TX\n\nWhat giant screen theaters are saying…\n\n“Train Time opened at IMAX® Victoria on September on 9, 2022 and has since been coined by our team as the little film that could. In its first two months, this film outperformed all other titles on our regular schedule and saw a high number of repeat visitors. This has been one of our most popular titles and is a film loved by all ages. Well done for striking that perfect balance!\n\n“Grandparents have returned with their grandchildren to bond over their love of trains, while children in turn revisit the film with their parents to share in their newfound passion – freight trains! The film has a unique ability to unite generations. Younger audiences were drawn to the breathtaking landscapes, opening scene with the model railway set and the lively soundtrack. Those less passionate about trains were impressed with the storytelling and cinematography. And any train enthusiast was of course captivated by every aspect of the film.”\n\n—Alexandra Weaver, Visitor Experience Manager, IMAX® Victoria and Royal BC Museum\n\n“Without a doubt, one of the best looking IMAX films I’ve ever seen! Train Time was enthusiastically embraced by our audience with the film scoring highly in exit surveys. It’s a film with wide appeal that has something for everyone.\n\n“Time after time Stephen has shown he is a master at taking audiences to places that the public rarely sees, and doing it on the world’s largest screens makes it all the more impactful. Train Time is another worthy addition to his legacy.”\n\n—Darren Durocher, Manager, IMAX® Theatre\n\nTELUS World of Science, Edmonton\n\n“Train Time offers our audiences such a unique window into the fascinating legacy that is the American railroad industry. We love how it takes a deep dive and showcases the science – particularly, the complexity and interconnectedness of so many of its moving parts – all while using real voices from within the industry to highlight the wide variety of roles, skills, and people that it takes to keep the system running.”\n\n—Dani LeBlanc, Director Immersive Theatres & Programs, Museum of Science, Boston\n\n“Train Time offers fascinating perspectives on careers in the modern-day railroad industry that are surprisingly STEM-oriented and that are accessible to people who are not typically represented. The movie shows women and women of color in positions often assumed are only held by men. The icing on the cake is the beautiful scenery and storytelling.”\n\n—Marcus Harshaw, Senior Director of Museum Experiences, Carnegie Science Center, Pittsburgh PA.\n\nIn the Media\n\nTrains Magazine / www.trains.com, April 23, 2023.

Train Time mesmerizes with freight trains whisking through breathtaking landscapes. But the behind-the-scenes aspect of STEM careers available throughout the railroad industry is fascinating. Railroads continue to be an integral part of American life and Train Time provides an eye-opening glimpse into the roles of dispatchers, road masters, engineers and conductors.” (Excerpt)\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, Aug 29, 2022, by Joshua Axelrod / Carnegie Science Center hosting U.S. premiere of new Imax documentary ‘Train Time’. (Note that this article was syndicated nationally (AP) and carried in the Hastings Tribune, thederrick.com and flipboard.com etc.)\n\nhttps://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2022/08/29/carnegie-science-center-premiere-imax-documentary-train-time/stories/202208290010\n\n(External link; opens in new window).\n\n“It’s just an honor to be able to run a U.S. premiere from this theater,” said Marcus Harshaw, senior director of museum experiences. “I think that’s a feather in our cap at the Science Center and at the Rangos Cinema. We’re really putting Pittsburgh on the map as a place where you can run these kind of premieres and the audience will come out and support.”\n\n“For Harshaw, ‘Train Time’ fits in perfectly with the sort of films he seeks for extended runs in the Science Center’s Rangos Giant Cinema. He loves how it both highlights STEM-related jobs available to railroad enthusiasts and ties into a permanent Science Center exhibit like its miniature railroad.”\n\n“Railroading is a fairly secretive world” (observes filmmaker Stephen Low). “BNSF has kindly thrown the doors open and let us film the intimacy of railroading. It’s really a unique perspective because of that access. You’re going to see railroading like you’ve never seen it before.” (Excerpts)\n\n“We are ecstatic to introduce a film to our guests that reveals diverse STEM careers not always talked about or known,” said Jason Brown, the president of Carnegie Science Center, in a statement. “The film immerses guests in a grand tapestry of railroading, which is a perfect pairing of art and science.” (Excerpt)\n\nwww.triblive.com, Sept 2, 2022. 5 things to do in Pittsburgh this weekend: Sept. 2-5.\n\nhttps://triblive.com/lifestyles/more-lifestyles/5-things-to-do-in-pittsburgh-this-weekend-sept-2-5/ (External link; opens in new window).\n\n“…showcases the heritage and the evolving role of railroading, along with a Black female train conductor in an industry that is perceived to be dominated by men.

(Excerpt)\n\nwww.victoriabuzz.com, September 2, 2022. ‘Train Time’ is the Newest Featured Short Film at the Royal BC Museums IMAX Victoria.\n\nhttps://www.victoriabuzz.com/2022/09/train-time-is-the-newest-featured-short-film-at-the-royal-bc-museums-imax-victoria/ (External link; opens in new window).\n\n“Director/Writer/Producer, Stephen Low shot the short film in 70mm IMAX film which will look amazing on western Canada’s largest screen at six stories high and 81 feet wide.” (Excerpt)\n\nMaking the Film\n\nBehind-the-scenes on Train Time\n\nTrain Time (working title) is a massive and unique effort that promises audiences a giant screen experience unlike anything yet seen. Filmed with railway cooperation, the giant screen documentary will offer up a remarkable behind-the-scenes and immersive ‘being-there’ perspective of railroading.\n\nThe Shoot. During our summer shoot in 2016, the team focused on covering locomotive operations and travel via dozens of specially-built mounting points on the locomotives. With a film production crew of a dozen and a revolving railroad crew of more than 50, the shoot aimed to secure great point-of-view footage from the train as it moved through mid-west and western states. “Safety is a key priority,” highlights filmmaker Stephen Low. “Operating and shooting on a railroad is extremely complex and cooperation from the railroad in helping to make this come together has been unprecedented.”\n\nTrainset. The production team operated from four classic business cars pulled by two diesel locomotives. One car supported the camera and sound team, another served as sleeper for production crew members, while a dining and staff car and a generator car help sustain the whole operation. The rapid and relatively short (500-foot) train ran on mainline track, but had to be scheduled between regular freights—some more than a mile long.\n\nVistas and Vantages. A key to a great giant screen experience is getting the audience to places they wouldn’t normally be able to get to. Train Time promises some unique vistas and with camera positions all over the train, the vantages are unlike anything you can actually see from the road or even from the inside of a train.\n\nFormat The film “Train Time” is captured with the IMAX camera in full, glorious 15/70 motion picture negative supplemented with ultra-high fidelity digital capture. The finished film will be exhibited in IMAX and other giant screen theaters beginning in 2018.\n\nThe crew. For the major shooting effort, the railroad support crew for Train Time encompassed a locomotive engineer, mechanical rider, a business car operations manager, assistant managers, a road foreman, conductor and others.\n\nTo capture unique footage, the team worked over several weeks with revolving personnel to keep the train operating 24-hours a day. Some of the production crew lived aboard, while some stayed in accommodations along the way with a driver and van providing ongoing shuttle and support.\n\nproducers and distributors of the giant screen experience\n\nvisit us at: www.stephenlow.com"
