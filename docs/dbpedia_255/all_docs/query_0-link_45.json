He works in a variety of disciplines that include painting, sculpture, installation, digital art, and graphic narrative. His many projects attempt to bridge the gap between painting and conceptual art and notions of high and low while frequently merging analog and digital approaches. His fine art has been shown widely both in the United States and abroad and has been exhibited at such venues as The Walker Art Center, MCA Santa Barbara, PS1/MOMA, Artpace, The Santa Monica Museum of Art, The ICA Philadelphia, the Blanton Museum of Art, S.M.A.K., and a host of private galleries. His writing and art criticism, under the pen name David Geers, has appeared in October, Fillip, Bomb, The Third Rail Quarterly, The Brooklyn Rail, and Frieze and often focuses on the convergence of art, politics, and technology. Meanwhile, his illustrated fiction and comics-based work has appeared in the Third Rail Quarterly, Unbag, Topic, in Devil’s Due’s much publicized Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force and Talk Bernie to Me anthologies, as well as the Ringo Award-nominated Pandemix anthology. His recently released debut graphic novel, Damnation Diaries, received a 2023 MoCCA Award of Excellence, positive reviews in Publisher’s Weekly, Artforum and other venues and was listed by the New York Public Library as one of 2023’s Best Comics for Adults. Rostovsky currently teaches at New York University and Parsons New School.\n\nPersonal website\n\nPeter Rostovsky is a Russian-born artist and writer who emigrated from the former Soviet Union as a political refugee in 1980.
