        "text": "Consults\n\nAre consults right for you?\n\nMost clients who sign up for consults fall into a several distinct categories.\n\nPros:\n\nYou want my expertise on gymnastics, parkour, climbing, and/or injury management.\n\nYou want direction in your training, especially with bodyweight training or combining bodyweight and barbell training.\n\nYou want an experienced coach looking over what you’re doing to feel assured, ask any questions, and adjust a program to your specific situation.\n\nYou’ve tried traditional doctors and physical therapists and they’re ineffective, or physical therapy is not a good option in your area.\n\nYou need an experienced hand to guide you from an injury for your daily life or sport.\n\nTraining and/or injury consultation may be right for you if you fall into any category above.\n\nCons:\n\nIf you are inconsistent with performing consultation recommendations, they won’t work as effectively. It will be very frustrating for both of us. You need to be fully committed. We can modify if life gets in the way, but missing days completely will be less effective.\n\nThe people who tend to have the best progress provide feedback and ask questions several times a week. If you want a set it and forget it program, we can do that but progress might not be as good.\n\nIf I think your case is best treated in person by a health professional I will tell you, or if it’s easy to address you can post on the reddit where I answer simple questions for free.\n\nIf you prefer a video introduction and explanations\n\nRates and services\n\nRates are subject to change based on availability. Availability at the moment: Low\n\nTraining and injuries rates\n\n$700 for 1.5 months for training OR injuries consultation ($467/mo).\n\n$1,000 for 3 months for training OR injuries consultation ($333/mo).\n\n$1,000 for 1.5 months for training and 1 injury OR 2 injuries package. Extra injuries are $250 per injury (e.g. 3 injuries is $1250).\n\nIf you need 2-3 months for multiple issues or want 6-12 months long for training we can discuss that with discounts.\n\nIf you are interested in a services trade use the contact form below.\n\nWhy I changed from 1 and 2 month offerings to 1.5 months (6 weeks) – Most of the injuries and training I am encountering benefit from an extra two weeks to resolve the injuries or get greater gains with training. 1 month was $500/mo, but the new offering is a bit less per month ($700/1.5 = $467 per month) to compensate.\n\nThe services rendered are:\n\nA personally constructed assessment and program that fits your needs whether it is training or injuries or both.\n\n60 minute video chat consultation to go over the program and to answer any questions you have.\n\n1 month (or more) of e-mail follow up for any questions, form checks, and adjustments depending on how your individual case is presenting.\n\nAny subsequent months may be discounted depending on how much follow up is needed if required on a per-month basis or negotiation.\n\nQuestions and Answers rates\n\nQ&A Conditions – Ask me questions about training or you’ve made your own plan for critique\n\nQ&A Rates –\n\nTraining related 60 minute Q&A via video chat for $150.\n\nInjury related 60 minute Q&A via video chat – Not accepting these anymore\n\nWhy am I not doing injury related Q&As anymore – The issue with the injury Q&As is I usually have to send a medical questionnaire, analyze it and figure out all of the right exercises for it, then list the videos and talk about them. This was way more than only 1 hour, and it was basically the injury consult for much less.\n\nFill out the contact form below if you are interested in any of these.\n\nPotential insurance reimbursement: This online consultation is considered out-of-pocket, but more insurance companies are allowing online consultations. I’ve had several clients submit an injury consult to their insurance company to be manually reimbursed. Usually the PT clinic bills your insurance company directly, but you can submit the claim yourself and get reimbursed for working with me.\n\nThe Process\n\nYou indicate what consultation you are interested in, and I send you questions so I can get an initial idea about your goals.\n\nI’ll e-mail you what I’m thinking about the particular situation with a general plan of action and answer questions about it.\n\nPayment is due before I send the plan.\n\nWe will schedule a 30-60 minute video call to discuss the program(s) and any questions.\n\nYou send me updates weekly at your discretion. If I don’t hear from you in 4-5 days I’ll shoot you a message to see how you’re doing.\n\nIf we need to modify a program based on what you are experiencing we will do it.\n\nYour month does not begin until the video chat session. Don’t worry about the e-mailing back and forth.\n\nIf you are interested, please indicate the program(s) that interest you below. Rates are subject to change based on availability.\n\nNote: If you don’t hear back from me in a day or two, you may contact me via Instagram, YouTube, or Reddit as it may have gotten lost in translation. You can also try refreshing the page and deleting the cache. A few people have told me there is an issue."
