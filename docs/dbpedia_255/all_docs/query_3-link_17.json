The political alterations in the kingdom were reflected in the sacred circle. Certain gods were relegated to the cold shades of obscurity, while new deities were adopted and others, hitherto regarded as negligible quantities, were exalted to the heights of heavenly omnipotence. The worship of Merodach first came into prominence in the days of Hammurabi.\n\nThe Art and Science of Leading\n\nAn Informative and Inspirational Leadership Guide Based on Personal Experiences\n\nBy: Dr. Keith Laprade\n\nNarrated by: Stephen Low\n\nLength: 2 hrs and 8 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nPerformance\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nStory\n\n0 out of 5 stars 0\n\nFor the longest time, this was the widely held perspective about leadership. The majority of people believed in this idea put forward by the Trait Theory of Leadership, which is an extension of the Great Man Theory given by Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle in the 1840s. Many theorists and philosophers also got influenced by Carlyle’s idea and even expanded it. One such philosopher was Francis Galton, who had several titles under his belt but was best known for his work in the fields of eugenics and human intelligence."
