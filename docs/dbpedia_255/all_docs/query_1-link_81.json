        "text": "AIRCRAFT CARRIER (Nimitz- and Ford-class)\n\nOne of the greatest engineering feats in history, the modern Nimitz-class carrier is a masterpiece of technology, and the flagship of the fleet. It is capable of housing a crew of over 5,000 men and women, and nearly 90 individual aircraft. With an overall length of 1,092 feet and full-load displacement of over 100,000 long tons, they have been the largest warships built and in service, although they are being eclipsed by the upcoming Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers. The new Ford-class carriers will introduce new technologies such as the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System, advanced arresting gear, automated systems, and more.\n\nF-35 Lightning II Fighter (A, B, and C Variants)\n\nHelmet Mounted Display System for F-35\n\nDesigned along with the F-35 is a Helmet Mounted Display System that provides pilots with unprecedented situational awareness. All the information pilots need to complete their missions – airspeed, heading, altitude, targeting information and warnings – is projected on the helmet’s visor, rather than on a traditional Heads-up Display. This approach greatly reduces the pilot’s workload and increases responsiveness. Additionally, the F-35’s Distributed Aperture System (DAS) streams real-time imagery from six infrared cameras mounted around the aircraft to the helmet, allowing pilots to “look through” the airframe. The helmet also provides pilots night vision through the use of an integrated camera.\n\nPRATT & WHITNEY F135 TURBOFAN ENGINE\n\nF-35 ELECTRONIC WARFARE TECH BY BAE SYSTEMS\n\nBAE Systems has introduced electronic warfare technology to the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, exploiting the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n​Electronic support intercepts, identifies and locates energy signals emitted from threats. Electronic attack or jamming then directs energy toward those threats to disrupt and neutralize their effects. Electronic protection protects personnel, facilities and equipment from an enemy or friendly disruption of combat capabilities.\n\nF/A-18 SUPER HORNET\n\nAMPHIBIOUS ASSAULT SHIP - USS AMERICA (LHA-6)\n\nLittoral Combat Ship\n\nSUBMARINE (Virginia-class)"
