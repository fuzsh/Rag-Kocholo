        "text": "Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a book gifting program that mails free, high-quality books to children from birth until they turn five, no matter their family’s income.\n\nThere are many reasons parents do not read to their children, but we can eliminate one of those reasons: a lack of books within the home. In 1995, Dolly Parton launched an exciting new effort, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library, to benefit the children of her home county in East Tennessee, USA. Dolly’s vision was to foster a love of reading among her county’s preschool children and their families.\n\nThrough the Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, children in Hancock County will have books of their own…at no cost to the family! A new carefully selected book will be mailed, in the child’s name, to his or her home each and every month from birth until he or she turns five years of age. Titles are chosen by a blue ribbon panel of educators, are age appropriate, and have concepts that build upon each other. All children, regardless of household income are eligible for the program. Should a child move out of Hancock County, he/she is deleted from the program unless the family moves to another community that participates in the Imagination Library program.\n\nSince the first mailing in November 2014, over 134,000 books have been mailed to children here in Hancock County. There are currently over 2,300 children enrolled in the program. $25 sponsors one child for one year (12 new books) and $125 sponsors one child for all five years (60 new books).\n\nIf you have any questions, please call us at 419-434-1077, or e-mail us at imaginationlibrary@findlaylibrary.org.\n\nEnroll your child today!\n\nHow Can I Support Dolly Parton's Imagination Library in Hancock County?\n\n$25 sponsors one child for one year\n\n$125 sponsors one child for all five years\n\n$300 sponsors a child in perpetuity\n\nBoth funds below support the program. Click on the fund to donate through the Findlay-Hancock County Community Foundation.\n\nHancock Literacy Fund\n\nEstablished 2020- The Dolly Parton Imagination Library was launched in 2014 to build early childhood literacy. The Library program provides age-appropriate books, selected by a blue-ribbon panel of educators, monthly to children enrolled from birth until their fifth birthday. This fund benefits The Imagination Library to provide lifelong literacy support to all Hancock County residents.\n\nChuck and Mariann Younger Hancock County Literacy Fund\n\nEstablished 2018- This fund, established in honor of Chuck and Mariann, is designated to support the Dolly Parton Imagination Library program. The Dolly Parton Imagination Library is a free book gifting program that mails free, high-quality books to children from birth to 5 years old regardless of their family’s income. Titles are chosen by a blue ribbon panel of educators, are age appropriate, and have concepts that build upon each other. Mailing books began in Hancock County in 2014. Since then, more than 65,000 have been sent to local children. Chuck and Mariann are both long-time supporters of education through local schools and universities, and other cultural opportunities.\n\nThank you to our 2024 Friends of Literacy:\n\nChuck and Mariann Younger Hancock County Literacy Fund\n\nHancock Literacy Fund\n\nZach Morgan Memorial Youth Leadership Fund\n\nHandbags That Help\n\nIvan & Judy Withrow\n\nRobroy & Lynette Millican\n\nKiwanis Club of Findlay\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corporation\n\nFindlay Noon Rotary\n\nRobin K.
