        "text": "Embrace the Season of Giving With Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library welcomes the holiday season by celebrating major achievements in literacy while cherishing the gift of quality time with family.\n\nAs of November 2023, Dolly’s childhood literacy program has gifted over 224 million books to children across the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and the Republic of Ireland. As we enter into the holidays, the Imagination Library continues to embrace the spirit of the season by gifting more books to more children around the world and inspiring us all to Dream More, Learn More, Care More and Be More!\n\nCelebrating Over 200 Million Books Gifted Globally\n\nTo celebrate the significant milestone of gifting over 200 Million Books globally, seven golden Dolly bookmarks were randomly hidden inside Imagination Library books gifted during International Literacy Month (September).\n\nGifting More Books to More Children\n\nDolly's dream has always been to inspire a love of reading among preschool children and their families by providing them with the gift of a specially selected book each month. What started in 1995 in Dolly's hometown of Sevier County, TN, has now grown into an international program. While Dolly and the Dollywood Foundation cover many overhead costs and administration needs, the Imagination Library is made possible through funding shared by Dolly Parton and local community partners. So, when the program becomes available to children in new areas, it's an accomplishment worth celebrating!\n\nLouisiana Announces Goal to Make Books Available to All Children Ages 0-5 in Every Parish!\n\nLouisiana Governor John Bel Edwards recently joined Dolly Parton, the faculty and students of Crestworth Early Learning Center, East Baton Rouge Parish Superintendent Sito Narcisse, and local leaders to announce the statewide expansion of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.\n\nCurrently, Louisiana has 32 programs covering portions of 30 parishes in Louisiana. Nearly 19,000 eligible children in the state are currently receiving free books through these existing programs. The goal of the statewide expansion is to make books available to children ages 0-5 in every parish in Louisiana. Visit imaginationlibrary.com to learn more and check availability as the program expands across the state!\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library is Now Available to all Children Under Five in Missouri!\n\nMissouri Governor Michael Parson recently joined Dolly Parton to announce the statewide expansion of her namesake Imagination Library book-gifting program. Missouri is the latest state to commit to achieving statewide coverage, with Missouri’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education(DESE) announcing that 100% funding for books and mailing for every child will be made possible by legislation (Section 178.694 RSMo. and DESE FY2024 budget) for many years to come.\n\nTo receive these books, all parents or guardians need to do is register their children in the program. High-quality, age-appropriate books are then mailed each month to the name of the child enrolled. Visit imaginationlibrary.com to learn more and register a child.\n\nCherish The Gift of Quality Family Time\n\nThe holidays are special for many reasons, but perhaps the most special of all is the quality time spent with family. It’s a wonderful time of year to cozy up with your child and read a good book together! Here are a few of the specially selected, age-appropriate books going out to registered children this season.\n\nShow Your Thanks by Giving\n\nJoin in the spirit of the season and give the gift of reading with families in your community by donating to your local Imagination Library! A donation as small as $26* covers the cost of providing an Imagination Library book to a child each month for one year!\n\n*Notates USA. Annual cost varies per country.\n\nNew to the Imagination Library?"
