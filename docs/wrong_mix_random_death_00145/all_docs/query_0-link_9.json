        "text": "Xavier Cason\n\nI practically grew up playing instruments in my father's band room and helping my mother design bulletin boards in her elementary classroom. It surprised no one that I spent most of my career as a music educator, first at Whiteville Middle School in Columbus County, NC in 1987, and later in Durham at NC Central University (1989-1997) and Hillside High School (1997-2012). I could not retire without paying homage to my mom's elementary work, so I also spent two years as an elementary music teacher at Bethesda Elementary School in Durham. It was at the elementary level that I clearly understood the foundational importance of early education. My favorite grade to teach was kindergarten. The daily outpouring of potential and curiosity was indescribable, and yet, so was the stark disparity among students as it related to school readiness.\n\nMy elementary teaching experience greatly influenced my first post-retirement goal, winning a seat on the Durham Public Schools Board of Education in 2016. While I worked as a board member to protect and prioritize early education, a change occurred at the presentation of the State of Durham's Young Children's Report. After the event, I volunteered to step up and take a more direct role in addressing young children's lived experiences before they arrive at school.\n\nAs Co-Chairs of a K-3 task force related to the report, County Commissioner Heidi Carter and I joined several early education initiatives, including the Early Education Action Circle, the DPS Community Schools Institutional Support Team, and Durham's Campaign for Grade-Level Reading. Stepping off the Board of Education, I took on the Community Schools initiative's Directorship in July of 2020 and have recently joined Durham's Early Childhood Action Plan Education Workgroup. I spoke earlier about my first post-retirement goal. My second post-retirement goal began in 2018 as a Ph.D. student in Education Evaluation and Policy Analysis at NC State University. I am currently in my last semester of classes and look forward to starting the dissertation phase with an eye on homeless education policy, which currently has a limited definition of what is and is not a preschool.\n\nMy time as a member of the DPS board of education was concurrent with my early education committee work. In many ways, both activities grounded me in the work of public/private partnerships, such as the complexities of collaboration and a focus on strategic planning and designing policies around community values. I have been an advocate for Pre-K expansion in Durham Public Schools and connecting high standards for early learning with the need for better pay and equitable educational opportunities for early education professionals. In any public-facing work I do, I will always seek out and prioritize the voices of those most affected by policy decisions.\n\nKate Goodwin\n\nKezia “Kate” Goodwin, a single-mom of three and grandmother of 2, is an Entrepreneur, Advocate and 34-year veteran in Early Childhood Education Operations and Management.\n\nKezia has served as a company leader for the YMCA, Head Start and KinderCare Education.

Their responsibilities encompassed various programs, including the Transition to Kindergarten partnership, Dolly Parton's Imagination Library, Reach Out and Read in pediatrician clinics, and logistics for Durham's Campaign for Grade-Level Reading. They also provided technical assistance to Smart Start-funded direct service providers, engaged in grant writing and management, graphic design, and community outreach.\n\nBrittany was served as the Director of Programs at DPfC from October 2019 to June 2023.
