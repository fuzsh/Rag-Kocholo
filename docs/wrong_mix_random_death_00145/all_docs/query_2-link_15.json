        "text": "We are now a Dolly Parton Imagination Library affiliate!\n\nThanks to our Friends of the Library groups, Nottoway County is now an official Dolly Parton Imagination Library affiliate. The Dolly Parton Imagination Library provides free, age-appropriate books to children up to five years of age - there are no income requirements or other qualifications to register, just a Nottoway County address. Once your child's registration is approved, it will take 6-8 weeks for the first book to arrive via US mail.\n\nThe books are mailed monthly at no cost to the family, but there is a cost of $2.10 per book charged to the affiliate (an annual cost of approximately $25 per child per year). Community groups and individuals are encouraged to help fund the program by making a monetary donation at any Nottoway County Library branch. Checks may be written to the Nottoway County Library.\n\nAbout Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library\n\nSince launching in 1995, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has become the preeminent early childhood book-gifting program in the world. The flagship program of The Dollywood Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, has gifted well over 182 million free books in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and The Republic of Ireland. The Imagination Library mails more than 2 million high-quality, age-appropriate books each month to enrolled children from birth to age five. Dolly envisioned creating a lifelong love of reading, inspiring children to dream more, learn more, care more and be more. The impact of the program has been widely researched and results suggest positive increases in key early childhood literacy metrics. Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. For more information, please visit imaginationlibrary.com."
