        "text": "Dolly Parton's Imagination Library\n\nThe Dolly Parton Imagination Library is a literacy program for young children. The program is available to the youngest residents in the Post Rock Extension District. www.imaginationlibrary.com\n\nWhat Is It?\n\nDolly Parton’s Imagination Library is a 60 volume set of books. Each month a new, carefully selected book will be mailed, in your child’s name, directly to your home. By mailing high quality, age-appropriate books directly to a child’s home, the Dolly Parton Imagination Library encourages children and their families to be excited about books and to feel the magic that books can create. Reading is a valuable experience for young learners as it promotes positive brain development, helps a child understand the world around them, and enhances positive relationships with the caring adults they rely on.
