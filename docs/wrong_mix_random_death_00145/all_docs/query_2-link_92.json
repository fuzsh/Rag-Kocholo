        "text": "PIGEON FORGE — One year after the Nov. 28, 2016, Gatlinburg wildfires, Dolly Parton said she's thankful for being in a position to help right away.\n\n\"It was just one of those things that God had his hand in it. If a bad thing had to happen, we had so many good people that just — and I got to get a lot of credit for a lot of hard work that a whole lot of people did — but I was just happy since it is my home and my people that I was able to kind of, you know, be the one to kind of stand out front and do whatever I had to do, but I was just so thankful for that,\" she said.\n\nWithin days after the fires, Parton and the Dollywood Foundation organized the My People Fund, which provided $1,000 a month for five months and $5,000 in its final month to Sevier County families and renters whose primary residence was destroyed or uninhabitable because of the fires.\n\nMore: 'My People' money paid off for those who lost homes, study shows\n\nThe My People Fund's name is meaningful to Parton.\n\n\"So I was just so happy ... and you should always help when you can, but these are my people. That's why we call it My People,\" Parton said. \"We have a show in the park with my people and my brothers and sisters and cousins called 'My People,' so it just seemed so perfect that you don't have to be family for us to be your people 'cause I'm proud of the folks here, and I'm just so proud of my part in it, but I had a lot of good help.\"\n\nParton had almost wrapped up her tour and was in Los Angeles filming \"The Voice\" with goddaughter Miley Cyrus when she found out about the wildfires last year.\n\n\"She (Cyrus) came running in and said, 'Did you know the Smoky Mountains are burning?' And I said, 'What are you talking about?' So anyway, that's when we became aware of it, and so we were coming off the road and my management has this great facility, and of course Pete (Owens, Dollywood's director of communications) and all the folks up here at Dollywood, they were right on top of everything with the publicity,\" Parton said.\n\nFriends of Parton began to reach out to her and asked how they could help. Around two weeks after the wildfires hit, Parton and several other artists performed in \"Smoky Mountains Rise: A Benefit for the My People Fund\" telethon on Dec. 13.\n\nMusicians including Reba McEntire, Cyndi Lauper, Chris Stapleton, Don McLean, Alabama, Kenny Rogers, Chris Young, Big & Rich, Hank Williams Jr., Alison Krauss and Amy Grant sang during the event. The telethon raised more than $9 million for the My People Fund.\n\nRelated:\n\nPrologue: 1 year ago, a 'whole mountain on fire' forever changed Gatlinburg\n\nPart I: Mountaintop spark, rising wind lit the fuse for Gatlinburg firestorm\n\nPart II: Air attacks, big box couldn't cage fire's surge toward Gatlinburg\n\nPart III: 'Like Armageddon': How the Gatlinburg fire became unstoppable and swarmed a city\n\nPart IV: 'No way out': Sacrifice and survival in the final desperate hours of the Gatlinburg fire\n\nJack McElroy: Special report caps year of coverage of Gatlinburg wildfire\n\nWe knew we lost our home': Immigrant family recalls escape from Gatlinburg wildfires 1 year ago\n\nBlack bears stayed put during Gatlinburg wildfires\n\nMemoir tells of blaze that tore through the Smokies a century before Gatlinburg wildfire\n\nWays of the winds: How fast did gales blow the night of the Gatlinburg wildfire?\n\nWhen seconds counted, TDOT worker cleared path to Gatlinburg for wildfire crews\n\nGatlinburg wildfires prompted Dolly, community and nation to give and keep giving\n\nDignity under fire: My people stand strong year after Gatlinburg disaster\n\nDolly Parton 'so proud' of My People Fund, telethon after Gatlinburg wildfires\n\nPark rangers' actions saved lives in Gatlinburg wildfires\n\nBlack Hawk crews arrived to 'war zone' day after Gatlinburg wildfires\n\nMap: Fires reported during the Gatlinburg fire"
