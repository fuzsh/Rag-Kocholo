        "text": "Gertrude Richardson (nee Twilley) was an English-born pacifist, feminist and socialist who was prominent in the fight for women’s rights in Manitoba, before the First World War. In 1911, Richardson and her mother moved to Canada to stay with her brother Fred on his homestead in the Roaring River district of Manitoba, south of Swan River, where Richardson began to publish verse[s] and articles in the Swan River Star. She married Robert Richardson, a successful local farmer. The Manitoba Grain Growers’ Association supported suffrage from 1911. The Roaring River #Suffrage Association was founded in March 1912, with both men and women as members. Gertrude Twilley was president, and her sister Fannie Livesey was secretary. They believed they were the first suffrage group in Manitoba. Gertrude Richardson became involved in the local Missionary Society, and eventually became its president. She also co-founded a Home Economics Society, at which women in the region exchanged recipes and learned about trade so they could understand and influence their husbands’ business dealings. She was invited to contribute to Woman’s Century, published by the National Council of Women of Canada. Her main interest was the Suffrage Association. This was closely associated with the Grain Growers, which held meetings in the local schoolhouse. (Nellie McClung came to Swan River and stayed with the Richardsons. She addressed a women’s meeting in the afternoon and a packed meeting of both sexes in the evening.) Richardson actively opposed the First World War (1914–18). She was against conscription and in favour of an early end to the war with a just peace settlement. She believed there was a natural link between pacifism and maternal feminism. She wrote that “war and militarism are the bitterest of all foes of womanhood, wifehood, motherhood and the home.” In 1915, the #RoaringRiverSuffrageAssociation became a branch of the Manitoba #PoliticalEqualityLeague. Richardson helped organize sections of the league in other Swan River valley communities. In February 1915, she attended the Political Equality League’s convention in Winnipeg and joined a deputation that confronted the Tory Premier Rodmond Roblin. Richardson was elected first vice-president with responsibility for organizing equality groups throughout Manitoba. Richardson later became disillusioned with the #WomensMovement, which failed to represent “women’s traditional values of peace and nurture,” and with some leaders supporting the war. She abandoned the suffrage movement, and organized religion, taking up Marxism. She called on Canadian women to “arise and save our men,” and blamed the war on “the blood-stained Capitalists of the world.” #MB150Trailblazers #WomensFirsts Keep reading: https://lnkd.in/gwSr5PK7\n\nGail Asper is a woman who did what some consider the impossible. She is responsible for the construction of the first national museum (an architectural treasure and award winner) built outside of Ottawa and the National Capital Region. The visionary, respected Winnipeg lawyer, philanthropist and president and trustee of the Asper Foundation spearheaded the creation of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg. Established in 2008 through the enactment of Bill C-42, an amendment of the Canadian Museums Act, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights was the first new national museum created in Canada since 1967. Asper ran one of the biggest fundraising campaigns in Canadian history to get the museum built. She currently sits on the Board of Trustees of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and on the Board of the Friends of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. Canadian generosity is exemplified in Gail Asper, who is a tireless champion for arts and culture. A visionary dreamer whose courage and conviction inspire others to see Manitoba’s vast potential, Asper inspires us to serve, to give, and to make our community a better place. She is well known for her support of the arts and her volunteer efforts encompass a myriad of causes. She has served on the boards of numerous, not-for-profit groups and was the 2002 campaign chair for the Winnipeg United Way Campaign, which raised a record $13.8 million, and then served as president of the board of United Way. She continues to serve on the United Way’s Major Donor Cabinet and Advisory Council. Asper has served as president of Manitoba Theatre Centre and co-chaired its successful $6-million capital campaign and $10-million endowment campaign. She served on the board of directors for the National Arts Centre Foundation as its Chair, and is a governor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Among numerous honours, Asper is the recipient of the YMCA/YWCA Women of Distinction Award for Community Voluntarism (2002); the Children’s Charity of Manitoba, Gold Heart Humanitarian of the Year Award (2004); and the Governor General’s Ramon John Hnatyshyn Award for Voluntarism in the Performing Arts (2005). She is also a recipient of the Order of Manitoba and an Officer of the Order of Canada. #MB150Trailblazers #AmazingWomen https://lnkd.in/gKcuhJEd.\n\nGabrielle Roy, C.C., F.R.S.C. (1909-1983) Gabrielle Roy, a famous French-Canadian writer, was born in St. Boniface, Manitoba, in 1909, to a French-speaking family. She studied at the Académie Saint-Joseph, in Saint-Boniface, and at the Winnipeg Normal Institute. She taught for 12 years, first in isolated villages and then in St. Boniface, where she also performed in the theater with the Cercle Molière troupe. In 1937, she left for Europe (France and England, 1937-1939), where she studied drama and wrote her first articles published in the French periodical “Je suis partout”. Returning to Canada in 1939, she settled in Montreal and published reports, descriptive works and essays in various newspapers and magazines: Le Jour, La Revue moderne, Le Bulletin des agriculteurs and others. Inspired by life in the working-class neighbourhood of Saint-Henri, she wrote her first novel, Bonheur d’occasion (1945). The English translation, The Tin Flute, was published in 1947. The novel was eventually translated into eighteen languages. Bonheur d’occasion won the Prix Fémina (1947) and was rated a bestseller by the Literary Guild of America in 1947. It was also in 1947 that Gabrielle Roy married Dr. Marcel Carbotte and settled in Quebec City. Bonheur d’occasion was followed by other novels and collections of short stories and essays. Among the many distinctions and artistic awards she has received, Roy was the first Canadian to be inducted into the Royal Society of Canada (1947), and was named a Companion of the Order of Canada (1967). She was awarded the Duvernay Prize for lifetime achievement in 1956, the David Prize in 1971 and the Molson Prize in 1978. Other important works include Ces enfants de ma vie (1977), which earned her third Governor General’s Literary Award. Her autobiography, La Détresse et l’Enchantement, which recounts the first thirty years of her life (up to 1939) and her letters to her sister, Ma chère petite sœur, Lettres à Bernadette 1943-1970, were published after her death, in 1984 and 1988 respectively.\n\nOn 18 October 1929, the “famous 5”, Emily Murphy, Irene Parlby, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney and Henrietta Muir Edwards, created a petition in an effort to have women considered legally as a person, so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927, although the Supreme Court of Canada passed a decision that women are not such persons. This judgement was overturned by the British Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the \"Persons Case\". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a larger drive for political equality. Excerpt from the Senate of Canada's website \"Why the Persons Case Matters\" Source No one had yet coined the term “glass ceiling” in 1929, but five women pushed through a barrier that had kept Canadian women out of public office since the country was created more than 60 years earlier. Led by Emily Murphy, Alberta’s first female judge, a group of Alberta women who came to be known as the “Famous Five” challenged a part of the Constitution that had prevented women from being appointed to the Senate. They won the so-called Persons Case, a legal challenge to a narrow interpretation of the Constitution that did not consider women to be “persons.” Women had been allowed to run in federal elections beginning in 1921. Agnes Macphail, the Progressive candidate in Grey South East, a riding centred around Guelph, Ont., became Canada’s first female Member of Parliament. But the government resisted pressure to appoint women to the Senate, arguing the British North America Act (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867 ) didn’t recognize women as “qualified persons” — the act used the word “persons” in the plural sense but when it referred to an individual person, it used the word “he.” The prevailing attitude: men were the only “qualified persons” who could be appointed to the Senate. Murphy was outraged. She had been subject to sexism since 1916. On her first day on the bench, a lawyer challenged one of her rulings. As a woman, Murphy wasn’t a “person,” so how could she be expected to be taken seriously as a judge? It was a recurring argument she heard throughout her legal career. In 1927, Murphy and four other women leaders in Alberta (Henrietta Muir Edwards, Nellie McClung, Louise McKinney, and Irene Parlby) asked the Supreme Court of Canada whether the British North America Act’s (BNA) section 24 included women in its definition of “persons.” Five weeks later, the Supreme Court reached a verdict in Edwards v Canada, the official name of the case. Its conclusion? Under Canadian law, women were not “persons.” #ThePersonsCase #FamousFive #NellieMcClung #VotesForWomen Keep reading: https://lnkd.in/gjyyiF8F\n\nAround the world, the women’s suffrage movement came to the fore in the 19th century, as women—especially those in the British Commonwealth—became increasingly politically active. John Stuart Mill, who openly supported women’s suffrage, was elected to the British Parliament in 1864. Throughout his campaign, he called for an amendment to the Reform Act to include female suffrage. Although the Reform Act was ultimately defeated by the entirely male-conservative government, for the first time it did succeed in raising awareness of the issue of women’s enfranchisement across the commonwealth. In the latter half of the century, the National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) was formed from many smaller groups. This larger union was immediately able to bring greater focus on the issue of suffrage, which had long been forced to the political background. The members of the NUWSS were extremely active, writing letters to politicians and publications, and holding town hall meetings and lectures to encourage public participation. In 1907, the NUWSS was able to organize a large protest, which became known as the Mud March. Thousands of women took to the streets, braving the cold and mud to march from Hyde Park to Exeter Hall in support of women’s suffrage. Emmeline Pankhurst, a highly visible suffragist from the UK, broke away from the NUWSS to create the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Since the movement had lost momentum and the support of the press, Pankhurst advocated for more violent forms of protest. This included storming the government while in session, invading private homes, and chaining themselves to public buildings. This led to the arrest and imprisonment of many women, many of whom were treated inhumanely while in jail. While the WSPU’s tactics gained public awareness through shock value, they also caused the group to lose many supporters of suffrage—men and women alike—who were not in agreement with their methods. In the early 1900s, the women’s movement joined the war effort, and by the time World War I ended, Parliament had agreed through the 1918 Qualification of Women Act to enfranchise women who were deemed ‘qualified’ to vote. ‘Qualified’ meant they were over 30 years of age, householders, married to a householder, or holders of a university degree. It took until 1928 before women were granted equal voting rights alongside men in England.

She was a member of the Manitoba Liberal Party, and was recruited to run as a “star candidate” in the first election in which women could be candidates. Florence Edith McTavish was born at Norway House, Manitoba, on April 26, 1876, the daughter of Metis parents, Lydia Catherine Christie and Donald C. McTavish, Chief Factor of the Hudson’s Bay Company. McTavish’s mother Lydia Christie was the daughter of William Christie and Mary Sinclair, both Metis. Rogers had strong family connections to Manitoba’s past. Her maternal great-grandfather, Alexander Christie, served as governor of Assiniboia on two occasions, and supervised the construction of Fort Garry. His son, William J. Christie, worked for the Hudson’s Bay Company in Manitoba from 1843 to 1873, and was named Inspecting Chief Factor in 1868. Rogers herself was born in the tiny outpost of Norway House, 600 kilometres north of Winnipeg. At age two, she moved with her family to Rupert House, on the shore of James Bay. In 1920, Rogers was asked to run for the Manitoba Liberal Party in the Winnipeg constituency, which elected 10 members by a single transferable ballot. She accepted, contested the 1920 provincial election, finished eighth on the first count, and was declared elected on the 38th count. In 1921, she introduced the legislation that incorporated the Winnipeg Foundation. An active advocate of the Child Welfare Act, she was re-elected in 1922 and 1927. During the First World War she was very involved in volunteer work, and was particularly active in social-welfare work, including a term as president of the Convalescent Home of Winnipeg (1919-1933). She served as the only woman on the Winnipeg General Hospital Board, and was secretary of the Central Council of the Battalion Auxiliaries. #MB150Trailblazers #WomensFirsts Keep reading: https://lnkd.in/g6ZEdFRn\n\nAs ballet dancers go, Evelyn Hart started her training late, making her sterling career and accomplishments are the more remarkable. Born in Toronto in 1956, she began her training at 14, in London, Ont. She attended the National Ballet School in Toronto before moving to Winnipeg at 17 to study at the Royal Winnipeg Ballet’s professional division. She joined the RWB corps de ballet in 1976, was promoted to soloist in 1978 and to principal dancer in 1979. In 1980, Hart won a bronze medal at the World Ballet Competition in Japan; later that year, Hart became the first Canadian to win a gold medal at the International Ballet Competition in Varna, Bulgaria – considered the Olympics of ballet – for the pas de deux Belong, choreographed by Norbert Vesak. Besides her spectacular artistic accomplishments, Hart is recognized for her contribution to the development of the RWB and the art form of dance as a whole. Many of the classics of the company’s repertoire (including Romeo and Juliet, Giselle, Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty) were brought in specifically to showcase her talents. Her biography, Evelyn Hart: An Intimate Portrait, by celebrated Vancouver dance critic Max Wyman, was published in 1991; Moment of Light: The Dance of Evelyn Hart, a 50-minute film by Winnipeg filmmaker Gordon Reeve, debuted on national television in 1992. In 2005, Hart left the RWB to dance as a freelance artist. On Aug. 23, 2006, she danced her swan song at the Grand Theatre in London, Ontario. She also danced as a guest artist with Toronto’s ProArteDanza, ending a 31-year career. #MB150Trailblazers #FemaleRoleModels #Ballerina Read more about Evelyn Hart: https://lnkd.in/gZGrrB6j."
