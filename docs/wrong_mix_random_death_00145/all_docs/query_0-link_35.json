Each Sunday night, Evie and Grandma get ready to go shopping by putting on their pajamas. That’s because they “shop” the Sunday papers, cutting out pictures of the things they are buying with their play money. Their dreams are modest but still bring a lot of pleasure to both of them. (Recommended for ages 4 – 8.)\n\nRelated Post: 4 ways social justice parents can teach kids about money\n\nEach Kindness by Jacqueline Woodson and E.B. Lewis\n\nWhen a new girl named Maya shows up in school and tries to befriend Chloe, Chloe isn’t sure why she turns away from her. Perhaps its because her clothes are ragged and she brings strange food in her lunchbox. Maya gives Chloe many chances to show friendship, but she doesn’t take any of them. One day, Maya isn’t there.\n\nTheir teacher takes out a bowl or water and drops a stone in. Ms. Albert tells the children that each time we show kindness, it ripples out into the world, just like the ripples from the rock.

Right now, her “books” are made of grocery sacks held together by safety pins, but she dreams of having real store-bought notebooks.

It focuses primarily on homelessness, although there are additional sections on refugees and global poverty.\n\nI like the way the book focuses on questions that young children are likely to have about poverty, its compassionate perspective, and its use of real photographs. However, I wish that it spoke more about systemic issues such as low-wage jobs and affordable housing. I recommend that adults add in some additional questions and perspectives that I highlight in this post on talking with children about poverty. (Recommended for ages 4 – 8)\n\nThose Shoes by Maribeth Boelts and Noah Z. Jones\n\nEverywhere Jeremy looks, he sees other kids wearing those shoes: the black high tops with white stripes. Grandma reminds him that they must focus on what he needs (winter boots), not what he wants. When the sole comes off Jeremy’s shoe at school, the guidance counselor gives him a pair of shoes he finds embarrassing. Almost all the other kids laugh when they see them.\n\nBut maybe now Grandma will get him a pair of those shoes? When all she kind is a thrift store pair that are too tight, Jeremy still insists he’ll wear them. But sore toes make him rethink his decision, and wonder who might enjoy the shoes more. (Recommended for ages 4 – 8).\n\nCoat of Many Colors by Dolly Parton and Brooke Boynton-Hughes\n\nDolly Parton has turned her famous song Coat of Many Colors into a children’s book. Her message can instill pride in children who live in poverty, and discourage bullying by those who don’t. She tells the story of how her mother made her a beautiful coat of patchwork rags. Dolly compared herself like Joseph from the Bible, feeling rich in the multicolored coat. But when she arrived at school, the other children didn’t understand the love that went into her coat, making fun of it.\n\nWhile Dolly’s letter to children at the end of the book acknowledges the pain she felt from their teasing, the story itself communicates that it’s the other children’s perspective that is wrong, not what Dolly wears. (Recommended for ages 3 – 7).\n\nTía Isa Wants a Car by Meg Medina and Claudio Muñoz\n\nEven though she can walk to everywhere she has to go, Tía Isa wants a car so that she can go to the beach. After all, she grew up right next to the beach on the island where she used to live.\n\nBut saving for a car isn’t easy, when half of Tía’s extra money goes back home to their family on the island.

She wears the same faded dress to school every day, but claims she has 100 dresses at home.\n\nWhen her best friend Peggy begins teasing Wanda every day about the dresses, Maddie is uncomfortable. Maddie is no stranger to poverty. She has to wear other people’s hand-me-downs. Will saying something to Peggy mean the end of their friendship? When Wanda stops coming to school, Maddie has to think long and hard about her silence.

Ada’s Violin challenged my stereotypes in telling the true story of a teacher and a group of children who learned to make beautiful music with their recycled instruments.\n\nIt’s truly a tale of community, with the town’s gancheros (recyclers who find materials to sell in the dump) figuring out what landfill materials could be used to make instruments. The book follows the children’s journey to far away lands where they open for a famous rock band. They discovered that “buried in the trash was music.
