I was so concerned when I sang her song how she’d feel about it, in terms of the arrangement, my licks, my flavor. When she said she was floored, that meant so much to me.”\n\nWhitney Houston’s iconic rendition of “I Will Always Love You” from The Bodyguard: Original Soundtrack Album became a juggernaut, topping charts all over the world and winning critical acclaim. The song spent 14 weeks at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, a record at that time and Whitney’s longest run atop the chart.\n\nThe song won GRAMMYs in 1994 for Record of The Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female. In 2020, “I Will Always Love You” was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry, and in January 2022 it was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nSongwriter: Dolly Parton\n\nProducer: David Foster\n\nB-Side: Jesus Loves Me\n\nLyrics\n\nIf I should stay\n\nI would only be in your way\n\nSo I’ll go but I know\n\nI’ll think of you every step of the way\n\nAnd I will always love you\n\nI will always love you\n\nYou\n\nMy darling, you\n\nBittersweet memories\n\nThat is all I’m taking with me\n\nSo goodbye\n\nPlease don’t cry\n\nWe both know I’m not what you, you need\n\nAnd I will always love you\n\nI will always love you\n\nYou\n\nI hope life treats you kind\n\nAnd I hope you have all you’ve dreamed of\n\nAnd I wish you joy and happiness\n\nBut above all this I wish you love\n\nAnd I will always love you\n\nI will always love you\n\nI will always love you\n\nI will always love you\n\nI will always love you\n\nI, I will always love you\n\nYou\n\nDarling, I love you\n\nI’ll always\n\nI’ll always love you"
