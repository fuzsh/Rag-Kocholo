What is Dolly Parton's Imagination Library?

Dolly Parton's Imagination Library is a FREE book-gifting program for any child under age 5 who lives in Chemung County or Steuben County.

How does it work?

A parent or caregiver registers a child for the program. Within about 6 weeks, the first book -- "The Little Engine That Could " -- arrives. Then the child will receive an age-appropriate book by mail each month until the month before they turn 5 years old. The books are the child's to keep.

Who pays for the program?

Donations to United Way of the Southern Tier fund the local program. Dolly Parton does not pay for the books; the Dollywood Foundation allows organizations like United Way of the Southern Tier to purchase the books at a discounted rate. The book are provided FREE to local families!

How can I support the program?

Donations are always welcome and appreciated! A gift of $30 will pay for a year's worth of books -- 12 books -- for a child. A gift of $150 will pay for a child to be in the program for five years! Make a gift today using a credit card on our secure site.
