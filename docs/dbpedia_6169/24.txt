Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is the largest US Department of Energy science and energy laboratory, conducting basic and applied research to deliver transformative solutions to compelling problems in energy and security. ORNL’s diverse capabilities span a broad range of scientific and engineering disciplines, enabling the Laboratory to explore fundamental science challenges and to carry out the research needed to accelerate the delivery of solutions to the marketplace.

Duke University was established as a core partner in ORNL’s original University Partnership vision. These core partnerships helped the laboratory facilitate the initial establishment of joint appointments, collaborative research, and graduate student opportunities that have since spread out across the country.
