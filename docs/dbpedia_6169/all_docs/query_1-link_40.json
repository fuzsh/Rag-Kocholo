        "text": "From Duke University\n\n3.20.24\n\nLauren Porcaro\n\nCome along with us on a journey of renewal and resurgence as we explore how students and scientists are rebuilding nature in viable ways. Discover the transformative initiatives of Duke Restore, where innovation meets conservation and regeneration, restoring the hope of a more sustainable tomorrow.\n\nAcross oceans, forests, deserts, and ice caps, indicators of climate change persist. In January, delicate almond flowers appear weeks early on gnarled branches in Central Park, just before a deep freeze; in the North Atlantic, right whales abandon traditional feeding grounds in search of food, putting them at risk in unfamiliar shipping lanes. Monarch butterflies migrating to Mexico’s oyamel fir trees find fewer sheltering branches.\n\nThis winter also brought a Wall Street Journal report on some American home and auto insurers leaving entire states, especially in areas at high risk for weather-related disasters — a financial marketplace following what plant and animal kingdoms, instinctively, already know: change is here.\n\nIn the layer between the natural world and global economies is where human-induced change can occur. What is to be done, within our lifetimes?\n\nThe Duke Restore Eco-Cultural Restoration Team paddles the Great Coharie River on a site visit to learn about river restoration from the Great Coharie River Initiative. Left to right: Rebecca Vidra, Philip Bell (Coharie Tribe), Claire Elias, Maeve Arthur, Katrina Bernaus. Photo credit: Kullen Bell (Coharie Tribe).\n\nSeeds of Resilience\n\nAs Earth’s climate saga continues, there is a new story being told from within the folds of a blade of translucent-green seagrass, protecting its new generation of seeds; in a stately forest’s waterways, where a re-engaged community kayaks; for leggy shorebirds, landing again in new marsh; in a red wolf pup’s footfalls, bounding away into the wild.\n\n“Nature can regrow, and we should be able to figure out how to help it,” Brian Silliman, Rachel Carson Distinguished Professor of Marine Conservation Biology, said, speaking recently from a research station on Australia’s One Tree Island, where he’d brought a class. Two hundred yards away, the edge of the Great Barrier Reef drops off into the deep.\n\nDuke Restore, a transdisciplinary initiative begun by Silliman in 2019, has now drawn more than 90 Nicholas School students and professors into teams dedicated to rebuilding and replenishing depleted habitats using methods that work with, rather than against, nature. It is a form of conservation focused on advancing the field of ecosystem restoration to enhance resilience of the natural world and of the communities that inhabit it.\n\nDuke Restore’s creation coincides with the United Nations’ Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, announced in 2020, with the goal “to prevent, halt and reverse the degradation of ecosystems on every continent and in every ocean.” Those involved in the initiative are taking steps to save all manner of ecosystems: rainforests in Borneo; wetlands on the Danube.\n\nSo far, six Duke Restore teams have formed: Eco-Cultural, Coral, Living Shorelines, Forest Restoration, Seagrass Farming, and Rewilding. A seventh, Carbon Farming, will be focused on peat bogs in eastern North Carolina.\n\nStarting with North Carolina and extending outward, Duke Restore brings teams directly into the field. Students walk old farmland furrows alongside members of a local organization in Durham that is reclaiming land from a former plantation, to set up a community garden.\n\nIn St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, Isaac Benaka, a second-year Master of Environmental Management (MEM) student, who was there in January to photograph damage to Elkhorn coral colonies after a recent, devastating bleaching event, attended a presentation that included a slide of recovering coral, and saw a roomful of scientists break into applause.\n\nIt turns out, these scientists have some stories to tell.\n\nA Restorative Science\n\nDuke Restore puts the Nicholas School at the forefront of a new kind of environmental approach. Conservation organizations haven’t typically used restoration as an intervention because it’s costly and not always successful. But as sea levels rise and communities are beset by unpredictable storms, wildfires and pollutants, restoring ecosystems is being embraced as a scalable strategy to increase habitat resilience.\n\nObservations of how natural systems recover from disturbance can be applied to restoration, increasing effectiveness by mimicking structures in nature that have evolved over time. Learning a better way to re-plant marsh stems in groups, for example, instead of in vulnerable, isolated plantings that more easily uproot in a storm, indicates that small changes can yield massive increases in success.\n\nTeams led by one or two master’s students, with a faculty adviser, determine their objectives, methods, and how to come up with the resources to carry out those objectives. These student-led initiatives appeal to Nicholas school students as a solution-based approach that nets results, said Silliman. “It’s not just documenting decline. They’re passionate about it because it’s tangible.”\n\nFollowing are snapshots of some of the work being done this winter.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAt the root of the Issue: Eco-Cultural Restoration\n\nOne of the teams, Eco-Cultural, has already evolved to the point where Rebecca Vidra, senior lecturer of Marine Conservation and Ethics and faculty advisor to the team, would like to refine its name, focusing on community partnerships. As all Duke Restore teams design ecological interventions that will improve local conditions in depleted ecosystems, the Eco-Cultural team’s focus is to broaden the scope of restoration to prioritize the many social and cultural benefits and to think about healing ecosystems and our connections to them. “The first year, we did a big literature review on eco-cultural restoration, which essentially is the idea that, when restoring an ecosystem, there is a possibility for restoring cultural traditions, cultural ties to the land, and communities,” she said. (The review was recently published in the journal Restoration Ecology.)\n\nDuke Restore Eco-Cultural Restoration Team visits the Catawba Trail Farm for UCAN’s Fall Festival.

Photo credit: Alan Dunkin.\n\nThe Eco-Cultural team is beginning to build a partnership with the Coharie Tribe in Clinton, North Carolina to learn about their work restoring the Great Coharie River. “This tribe, by restoring their river, ended up building the community and connections necessary to restore their cultural traditions,” Vidra said. “Their language. They’re drumming classes. It helped them re-weave those ties.”\n\nEarly fieldwork Vidra did in taro fields on Kauai inspired an interest in regenerative agriculture, and the importance of building authentic local relationships. “The best way to do restoration is to go out and do it,” she said. “It’s a different way of thinking about Duke and our resources. What if we used our time and labor, and connections, to really let community lead? And tell us what they want to know? What are the questions they have?”\n\nAnother Eco-Cultural team endeavor is to deepen the Nicholas School’s work with Catawba Trail Farm, a Black-led organization in Durham, which is building a community garden out of a section of 200 acres of former plantation land. In a big step forward, the Triangle Land Conservancy transferred ownership of the land to the Catawba Trail Farm in January. Working with Urban Community Agrinomics (UCAN), the organization that stewards this farm, the Eco-Cultural and Forests Teams are collaborating to plan a new garden space, remediate soils, and do a broader forest inventory of the site.\n\nPartnering with Duke Forest and organizations like The Nature Conservancy and the North Carolina Coastal Federation for financial support and expertise is also necessary for long-term solutions.\n\n“If you expand your scope of what you think restoration is, and should be,” Vidra said, this could make Duke “the example of a research-based institution that builds and stewards community engagement, community connections, community partnerships. I want us to lead in that way.”\n\n_____________________________________\n\nReawakening the Woods and Conquering Invaders\n\nDuke Restore Forest Restoration Team members examine a loblolly pinecone.

Co-leads of the group, MEM first-year students Caroline Kristof and Kristine Lister, described the current work, including a shortleaf pine restoration project in Duke Forest, and a project focusing on the removal of an invasive species, fig buttercup.\n\nInvasive species removal requires an ongoing commitment over several seasons. One of the major goals for this year is setting up partnerships so that the team has the foundation to continue for years to come. “It’s really exciting for us to find these partners and engage with them, knowing that we will have group members — new master’s students — in the future to continue the work.”\n\nKristof said the challenge between short- and long-term planning is the most challenging component as a new team. Some students prefer short-term forays into fieldwork, “but at the same time we have a lot of people who want to develop their skills, and get certificates, people who really want to get in the weeds — literally — and learn, and be consistent,” she said. Balancing these needs “is what we’re trying to figure out. But it also has been incredibly interesting and rewarding.”\n\nTwo groups they’re working with, the Triangle Connectivity Collaborative and Durham Open Space program, are mapping habitat connectivity, studying how easily animals can travel from one natural area to another, for example, said Lister, or whether there are obstacles to wildlife’s ability to forage and thrive: “Can a fox get from Eno River Park to Jordan Lake?”\n\n_____________________________________\n\nRebuilding Ecosystems, Restoring Hope\n\nWelcome to the heart of Duke Restore, where nature’s resilience meets human ingenuity.

The Duke Marine Lab on Pivers Island, in Beaufort, N.C. itself exhibits a living shoreline. For the past few years, the team has been working with the U.S. Navy on a shoreline project at the Marine Corps Air Station in Cherry Point, N.C. that will be installed soon.\n\nThe living shoreline at the Duke University Marine Lab on Pivers Island, in Beaufort, N.C. Photo credit: Carter Smith.\n\n“Living shoreline” is a broad term that covers a range of interventions. “On the really green end of the spectrum, you could just restore a salt marsh. In a low-energy area, that’s going to help attenuate sediments, and help provide coastal protection. In that sense, it might mimic a natural salt marsh really well. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you could have a very highly engineered shoreline, this is closer to the project that we’re working on at Cherry Point, where coastal protection is really important,” said Smith. “They’re trying to protect the shoreline from major hurricane events so they’re putting in a very highly engineered large, granite breakwater, with some marsh plantings behind it.”\n\nSmith described adaptations like putting in a granite sill just offshore a marsh, with gaps that allow fish passage, so that the fish aren’t obstructed from using the marsh behind these breakwaters, and can flux in and out at will, at high tide. In Beaufort, local species like red drum, pinfish and mummichog swim through to protected areas.\n\n“People are excited if they hear that there are blue crabs and red drum in an area,” Smith said. Red drum, or channel bass, is the state saltwater fish of North Carolina.\n\nNear conventional infrastructure, hardened shorelines like concrete seawalls, she said, scientists observe significantly lower biodiversity across plant and animal groups. “What we know now is that they’re not actually as effective, in a lot of circumstances, as people think that they are and they’re definitely not as resilient in the long term, because they typically have very high maintenance costs. They require a lot of continued human intervention.”\n\nSeawalls are built with a fixed sea level in mind, “which is really problematic, if we’re going to see feet of sea-level rise, in North Carolina, over the next 50-75 years,” Smith said. “That makes a big difference in terms of the effectiveness of this structure that was built assuming that the sea level was fixed.”\n\nUsing natural elements in coastal infrastructure, she said, has multiple benefits. “One, it is going to be better for the environment — hopefully, we’re going to see higher biodiversity along these natural shorelines if we do it correctly and restore significant portions of habitats — and two, it actually has potential to be really effective, because natural ecosystems can adapt! And change. And they can repair if they get damaged,” she said. “And so, there’s the potential for them to be a more sustainable and more resilient option.”\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeaves of Seagrass: Restoring shorelines, blade by blade\n\nStephanie Valdez, a PhD student and lead on the Seagrass Farming team, studies a plant that adapted millions of years ago, when it moved from land into saltwater: seagrass. It flowers, seeds, and needs sunlight like a terrestrial plant, and its coastal presence is crucial to fighting erosion and maintaining biodiversity.\n\nStudents on the Seagrass Farming team collect plugs of seagrass (H. wrightii) which are later transplanted. Left to right: Christy Cutshaw, Catherine Brenner, Manar Talab. Photo credit: Stephanie Valdez.\n\nSubtidal seagrasses sometimes get overlooked, as they undulate and react to wave energy, just underneath the water’s surface. Their presence, however, is important for many charismatic species on the North Carolina coast, like black drum, flounder, and blue crab, which spend their juvenile stage in and around seagrass meadows, moving on when they are stronger and more mature. Seagrass provides protection from predators and offers resources to juveniles such as food and anchoring substrate for egg-laying animals.\n\nValdez drew a parallel between the way Duke Restore works, to the seagrass meadows that work in conjunction with a salt marsh, to offer these species, and the shoreline, layers of protection from storm surges.\n\n“And it’s that layering of multiple species — no one species can do it alone,” she said. “That what’s really interesting about Duke Restore. Even though we have separate teams, we’re all communicating across teams; Living Shorelines is working to create facilities that work for both marsh and seagrasses.” Valdez and the Duke Restore Seagrass team are working with the Department of Environmental Quality and other agencies to determine the permitting language needed for a seagrass farm.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nA Dive into Reef Regeneration\n\nIn January, the U.S. Virgin Islands are subject to Christmas winds, which were combing over St. Croix just as Benaka arrived on the island to try to take photos of the reef by drone as part of a Corals team project spearheaded there by marine biologists at The Nature Conservancy. “It’s super exciting to be on the project, to get to be a part of it,” Benaka said, as he described waiting for whitecaps to subside.\n\nHayden Dubniczki prepares a drone for takeoff to capture images of the Elkhorn coral below as part of a study led by The Nature Conservancy in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Photo credit: Steve Schill.\n\nFor coral-reef monitoring, in general, sending divers out to the reef periodically to inspect coral populations is incredibly time consuming and expensive, he said, “but if we can use drone imagery to monitor the reef and keep tabs on corals and their health status, then we can — much more rapidly than we’ve ever been able to before — get an idea of what makes a successful reef in the face of climate change.”\n\nBenaka had taken up the project that Hayden Dubniczki MEM’24 began last summer, working with The Nature Conservancy. Dubniczki described the overall goal of the Duke Restore Coral team: to spark some on-the-ground efforts to achieve coral restoration at the Duke Marine Lab, as well as to connect students to research opportunities with organizations outside of Duke.\n\n“I spent many, many hours sitting at a computer and outlining coral colonies,” she said, describing building the foundation for a deep-learning model. “We also outlined mounding corals, like brain coral, and Millepora fire coral — it looks very similar to Elkhorn — so we want to make sure the model can make that close distinction.”\n\nDubniczki and Benaka worked with George Raber and Steve Schill at The Nature Conservancy’s project in St. Croix, who shared extensive knowledge of drones and coral reef—as well as with a state agency in St. Croix and TNC staff who live there full time. “Getting their perspective on the successes or failures they’ve had while trying to bolster their coral reef populations was definitely inspiring,” Dubniczki said.\n\n“Hayden and Isaac have been instrumental in developing a library of coral examples that the Deep Learning algorithm learns and uses to map coral colonies across many miles of reef,” Schill said. “Our goal is to develop a library of hundreds of field-validated examples so these patterns can be learned by an automated classifier that can then map thousands of corals whenever we collect new drone imagery.” They will use the information to observe how the reef changes over time, for adaptive management.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe Future of Ecological Conservation: Regrowth\n\nGlimpse into the future of conservation. Discover how coral, shoreline, and seagrass restoration projects stimulate enhanced biodiversity, and pave the way for more resilient and vibrant ecosystems.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nWhere the Wild Things Were: Bringing Back Native Species\n\nGlobally, as conservation programs have succeeded, animals on the endangered list have moved from threatened status to normal. Building on that progression, the Rewilding team was formed whose objective is to identify large species for reintroduction into the wild. The team is working with several other Duke Restore teams, including Forest Restoration and Corals, planning to return formerly endangered species like the red wolf to its original habitat in North Carolina. On the California coast, sea otters released from captivity have helped fuel a successful rebound in estuaries near Monterey Bay, which has, in turn, stabilized and restored local marshes.\n\nThe return of sea otters, a top predator, to a California estuary is helping slow erosion and restore the estuary’s degraded geology. Photo credit: Emma Levy.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nRenewal: The Path Forward\n\nSmith is looking forward to the installation of the new breakwater at the military base in Cherry Point, which will bring to bear many elements of Duke Restore, including building a natural shoreline, with a variety of local fish species maintaining their ecological role. Restoration as conservation works, Smith said. “It’s a solution that’s helping to meet goals that are important to humans, but also important for the functioning of these ecological systems.”\n\nIn undulating seagrass submerged in the cold Atlantic, a community of oysters, blue crab and young channel bass will go about their day, unaware of their advocates on land. “You’re getting better, cheaper coastal protection in the long term, and it’s good for the environment,” Smith said. “What a great reason for hope.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nYounger than most other prestigious U.S. research universities, Duke University consistently ranks among the very best.

Smith\n\nToo small to see with the naked eye tiny tunable nanotubes could one day be used for making electronic devices ranging from night vision goggles and motion detectors to more efficient solar cells, thanks to techniques developed by researchers at Duke University. Credit: Duke University.\n\nDuke researchers are devising new ways to engineer carbon-based semiconductors for electronics of the future.\n\nFirst discovered in the early 1990s, carbon nanotubes are made from single sheets of carbon atoms rolled up like a straw.\n\nCarbon isn’t exactly a newfangled material. All life on Earth is based on carbon. It’s the same stuff found in diamonds, charcoal, and pencil lead.\n\nWhat makes carbon nanotubes special are their remarkable properties. These tiny cylinders are stronger than steel, and yet so thin that 50,000 of them would equal the thickness of a human hair.\n\nThey’re also amazingly good at conducting electricity and heat, which is why, in the push for faster, smaller, more efficient electronics, carbon nanotubes have long been touted as potential replacements for silicon.\n\nBut producing nanotubes with specific properties is a challenge.\n\nDepending on how they’re rolled up, some nanotubes are considered metallic – meaning electrons can flow through them at any energy. The problem is they can’t be switched off. This limits their use in digital electronics, which use electrical signals that are either on or off to store binary states; just like silicon semiconductor transistors switch between 0 and 1 bits to carry out computations.\n\nDuke chemistry professor Michael Therien and his team say they’ve found a way around this.\n\nThe approach takes a metallic nanotube, which always lets current through, and transforms it into a semiconducting form that can be switched on and off.\n\nBy wrapping a carbon nanotube with a ribbon-like polymer, Duke researchers were able to create nanotubes that conduct electricity when struck with low-energy light that our eyes cannot see. In the future, the approach could make it possible to optimize semiconductors for applications ranging from night vision to new forms of computing. Credit: Francesco Mastrocinque.\n\nThe secret lies in special polymers — substances whose molecules are hooked together in long chains — that wind around the nanotube in an orderly spiral, “like wrapping a ribbon around a pencil,” said first author Francesco Mastrocinque, who earned his chemistry Ph.D. in Therien’s lab at Duke.\n\nThe effect is reversible, they found. Wrapping the nanotube in a polymer changes its electronic properties from a conductor to a semiconductor. But if the nanotube is unwrapped, it goes back to its original metallic state.\n\nThe researchers also showed that by changing the type of polymer that encircles a nanotube, they could engineer new types of semiconducting nanotubes. They can conduct electricity, but only when the right amount of external energy is applied.\n\n“This method provides a subtle new tool,” Therien said. “It allows you to make a semiconductor by design.”\n\nPractical applications of the method are likely far off. “We’re a long way from making devices,” Therien said.\n\nMastrocinque and his co-authors say the work is important because it’s a way to design semiconductors that can conduct electricity when struck by light of certain low-energy wavelengths that are common but invisible to human eyes.\n\nIn the future for instance, the Duke team’s work might help others engineer nanotubes that detect heat released as infrared radiation, to reveal people or vehicles hidden in the shadows. When infrared light — such as that emitted by warm-blooded animals — strikes one of these nanotube-polymer hybrids, it would generate an electric signal.\n\nOr take solar cells: this technique could be used to make nanotube semiconductors that convert a broader range of wavelengths into electricity, to harness more of the Sun’s energy.\n\nBecause of the spiral wrapper on the nanotube surface, these structures could also be ideal materials for new forms of computing and data storage that use the spins of electrons, in addition to their charge, to process and carry information.\n\nThe researchers describe their results March 11 in the journal PNAS.\n\nThis research was supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-18-1-0222), the National Institutes of Health (1R01HL146849), the United States National Science Foundation (CHE-2140249, DGE-2040435) and the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.\n\nfive-ways-keep-your-child-safe-school-shootings\n\nPlease help promote STEM in your local schools.\n\nStem Education Coalition\n\nYounger than most other prestigious U.S. research universities, Duke University consistently ranks among the very best.

An herbarium is a sort of plant library, and a type specimen is something like a first edition, or perhaps even an original manuscript. It’s the specimen based on which the species got its scientific name and classification, and the original type specimen generally stays in the herbarium of the person who discovered it.\n\n“Did you know,” Pryer asks, “that Mike and I were the ones who named the fern after Lady Gaga?” Absolutely true, but this is what journalists call “burying the lede.” Pryer has been discussing the herbarium for more than an hour, yet this is the first time Lady Gaga has come up.\n\nYou can understand it. Pryer has focused on explaining the herbarium and its work, to say nothing of its complex future. Still, it turns out Lady Gaga and her eponymous fern – an entire genus of 19 ferns, mind you, not just one species – actually help do that work.\n\nHerbarium director Kathleen Pryer with a specimen of Gaga monstraparva.\n\nThe herbarium houses science that is utterly foundational. Scientists go into the field and see plants: “What’s that?” They grab a specimen and take it home, where they do molecular, morphological and genetic work to figure out where it fits. Then affix it to a piece of archival quality cardboard, label it with information about its species, genus and surroundings, and if it’s something new, the world knows about a new plant, and the scientist’s organization has something new to share. There are about 3,500 herbaria in the world, and their 400 million specimens include every plant we know about.\n\nThe Duke herbarium holds more than 825,000 plant species, making it one of the largest among U.S. universities. Protected in envelopes or affixed to archival card-stock sheets and filed, specimens allow scientists to return to particular species at any time: Does it for sure have those little hairs? Do seeds really weigh a quarter of a gram? New scientific capacities only increase specimen value: Scientists can now, for example, test DNA in specimens gathered before DNA was even discovered. Herbaria send specimens to scientists who need them, and the scientists annotate them before returning, further spreading knowledge. “It really is the fundamental archive of plant and fungal biodiversity,” says professor of biology Jonathan Shaw, who focuses on bryophytes (mosses and such), of which Duke’s is one of the world’s primary collections.\n\nDiscovering unrecognized biodiversity: Analysis of herbarium specimens led Duke researchers to determine that the herb Boechera hastatula, middle, was a hybrid between B. retrofracta on the left and a soon-to-be published species on the right, B. “mitchell-oldsiana”.\n\nBut those samples are stashed in rows of cabinets in two separate areas on West Campus. The herbarium is out of space, and their future is uncertain. Campus space, staff and resources are scarce; specimens remain uncatalogued and unfiled. Advances such as digitization make Pryer fear that some think actual plant samples are not worth keeping around. A “unique and irreplaceable resource,” according to a 2023 strategic plan, the herbarium faces an uncertain future.\n\nPryer tours a visitor through the part of the herbarium housed in the Biological Sciences Building – three levels of cabinets stuffed full of plants in folders, squeezed into two stories of building. The other half of the collection resides two buildings away, beneath Duke’s Phytotron, where plants grow under controlled experimental conditions. At times the herbarium, which got its start with botanist Hugo Blomquist, who joined Trinity College in 1921, has lived in building hallways; at others it’s been banished to unreliable off-campus storage. Pryer describes various hopeful strategies for managing the herbarium in coming years.\n\nOne hope is a possible home in Duke Gardens, where it could be made easily available to researchers and the public, or possibly sending some of its resources to other herbaria, leaving more space for the Duke herbarium’s stronger collections. That new strategic plan organized by Pryer and co-director Paul Manos says the herbarium averages 80 citations in peer-reviewed publications per year, which they note outperforms the citations of an average Nobel laureate, bringing the kind of attention universities crave.\n\nLady Gaga’s big-shouldered costume from the 2010 Grammys looked like the reproductive stage of the fern named after her.\n\nWhich brings up Lady Gaga. In 2012 Pryer and other researchers were going over the genetics of some desert ferns found in Central America, and they had an herbarium moment. “When you start comparing material,” she says, “you’re working on two type specimens, and you realize, this [one] isn’t even anywhere close to this thing. It’s something new.” They realized that a new plant wasn’t just a new species – they were dealing with an entirely new genus of fern.\n\nThat meant it was naming time, and the lab loved Lady Gaga. More, the fern’s gametophyte looked like one of her costumes, and they produce spores that are sexually fluid; they even sometimes reproduce asexually. “It became a very exciting way” to support Lady Gaga’s “born this way” acceptance of sexual complexity. Sexuality “isn’t just blurry in humans,” Pryer says. “It’s blurry across animals, blurry in plants.” Finally, when graduate student Fay-Wei Li Ph.D.’15 was checking the ferns’ DNA, he found, among the G (guanine), C (cytosine), A (adenine) and T (thymine) base pairs that all similar ferns had, a unique string of four pairs: GAGA. And found them only in the new genus.\n\nMost of the ferns had previously been cataloged, assigned to a different genus. After the DNA analysis, they were reassigned to the Gaga genus. But two of the species were brand new: Gaga monstraparva, named for her “little monsters” fans, and Gaga germanotta, for her original last name – she was born Stefani Germanotta. The new species drew media attention to the herbarium from all over the world.\n\nWindham proffers a labeled archival card with the plant gently affixed: “This is the “holotype” of Gaga monstraparva,” he says. “Holotype” means it’s the single type specimen, from which the new species was identified. Duplicates of that are called isotypes, but monstraparva has none. “That is the only known specimen at this point,” Windham says. Staff is so short and time and space so tight that the specimen, from that 2012 identifying work, is still not yet filed in its special yellow type-specimen folder.\n\nBut it’s in the herbarium – as Lady Gaga says, “whether it’s broke or evergreen.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

Photo by Ryan Parks, Nicholas School of the Environment.\n\nAt any given moment, our bodies and those of other animals are teeming with viruses — even when we’re healthy. Most of them are unknown to science, Paietta said.\n\nScientists estimate there may be 1.5 million viruses still waiting to be discovered in mammals alone.\n\nNot all of them cause disease or will go on to infect new species — a phenomenon called spillover.\n\nBut some of them might, as the virus behind the COVID-19 pandemic likely did. And Paietta hopes to find some of the pathogens that could, before they become a threat.\n\nMost research on viral spillovers focuses on those that “spill” from wildlife to humans, Paietta said. And for good reason: Nearly two thirds of the emerging infectious diseases worldwide got their start by passing from animals to people. Think Ebola, SARS, monkeypox, and of course, COVID-19.\n\n“But viruses can go both directions,” Paietta said.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19, for example, has been transmitted from humans back to numerous animals ranging from deer to cats. Humans have also passed H1N1 influenza to pigs, and deadly respiratory viruses to wild chimpanzees and gorillas.\n\n“We’re interested in what people and domestic animals can give to wildlife too,” said Paietta, who works in biology professor Anne Yoder’s lab.\n\nThis has implications for conservation, especially given that 95% of the more than 100 lemur species found in Madagascar are already threatened with extinction, largely due to deforestation and habitat loss.\n\nWithin the past 60 years Madagascar has lost nearly half of its forests, mostly to make way for rice farms. With deforestation, people move into areas they haven’t inhabited before, and the buffers between people and wildlife shrink.\n\nBut when it comes to spillover there’s another factor at play: climate change.\n\nSituated in the Indian Ocean, Madagascar is already vulnerable to extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, floods and droughts — and global warming has only made them worse.\n\nCyclones damage crops and wreck houses, forcing people into the forest in search of timber to rebuild their homes and food to feed their families, said Paietta’s collaborator Brian McAdoo, a disaster risk expert at the Nicholas School of the Environment.\n\nMcAdoo’s graduate student Ryan Parks, a Ph.D. Student in earth and climate sciences, is working with Paietta to understand the role of flooding, which creates breeding grounds for mosquitoes that can transmit viruses — all of which create more routes of disease transmission between humans and wildlife.\n\nFor her part, Paietta has been focusing on viruses in lemurs. Though lemurs are our primate cousins, we know very little about what viruses they carry, Paietta said.\n\nA Day in the Life of a Researcher in Madagascar.\n\nWith help from researchers at Zoo New England, Arizona State University, and Malagasy colleagues at Mahaliana Labs and Centre ValBio, she’s been sampling lemurs and other animals living in and around the reserve to catalog all the viruses circulating in their bodies.\n\nThe researchers are looking for known viruses, but also for new viruses that scientists haven’t seen before, and that could be spreading silently from one species to the next.\n\nTo collect samples, this summer they darted lemurs and set up Sherman traps — a cage that closes when an animal enters and steps on a platform — returning later to collect rats and other small animals lured in by the bait.\n\nThey performed health exams on any animals they captured, taking oral swabs and blood and fecal samples to look for viruses in their mouths, their guts, and elsewhere in their bodies before releasing them back into the forest.\n\nThe researchers also sampled animals that live among people or near homes and farms, such as cats, pigs, chickens and cattle, which can act as intermediates.\n\n“Invasive and domestic animals serve as bridges between the forests and villages, because they are moving among them constantly,” Paietta said.\n\nBetween this summer and a similar trip in 2022, Paietta collected bodily secretions from some 280 animals, totaling roughly 1000 samples.\n\nShe carried the samples back to the U.S., frozen in liquid nitrogen tanks. At Duke and the PREMISE lab at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center, researchers will extract the genetic material from any viruses that might be present and sequence their genomes using an approach called “metagenomic sequencing”.\n\nUnlike traditional virus detection methods, which involve testing for specific pathogens, “metagenomic sequencing” can identify many pathogens at once — even viruses Paietta doesn’t know she’s looking for yet.\n\nPaietta’s work is part of a larger 10-year effort, organized by a nonprofit called Health in Harmony in collaboration with the local community living around the reserve.\n\nThe idea is to look at how improving people’s access to food and healthcare also affects biodiversity, deforestation, and disease transmission in the area.\n\n“We’re using a ‘One Health’ approach that looks at the intersection between human health, animal health and environmental health,” since they’re interconnected, Paietta said.\n\nPaietta hopes to start analyzing genome sequences by the end of the semester.\n\n“Then I get to look at all the data and start looking for viruses.”\n\nIt’s an exciting time to be doing this kind of research, Paietta said.\n\nAlready, she’s discovered what appear to be three new viruses called papillomaviruses that scientists have never seen before, uncovered while testing metagenomic methods at the Duke Lemur Center in collaboration with Arvind Varsani at Arizona State University.\n\n“It’s a field that I’m really lucky to be tapped into, because there is not much known,” Paietta said. “So everything we find is new.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

Duke’s graduate and professional schools — in business, divinity, engineering, the environment, law, medicine, nursing and public policy — are among the leaders in their fields. Duke’s home campus is situated on nearly 9,000 acres in Durham, N.C, a city of more than 200,000 people. Duke also is active internationally through the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore, Duke Kunshan University in China and numerous research and education programs across the globe. More than 75 percent of Duke students pursue service-learning opportunities in Durham and around the world through DukeEngage and other programs that advance the university’s mission of “knowledge in service to society.”\n\nDuke University is a private research university in Durham, North Carolina.

There are botanists, birders, conservationists and engineers of every stripe with specialties as diverse as their lunch orders. Soon the sounds of plastic cutlery being unwrapped and water bottles uncapped add to the background noise of insects screaming in the forest. A coil of shiny silver ductwork shivers as a portable air conditioning unit struggles to suck the humidity from the rainforest and breathe a bit of cool relief into the packed room.\n\nBut 10 minutes’ walk through the forest and down a narrow service road, mechanical engineer Juliet O’Riordan is still at our group’s test site. Both lunch and relief can wait; she is searching for a suitable branch upon which to hang our team’s success in the XPRIZE Rainforest competition. She’s feeling immense pressure to get it right. The team has traveled across the world to be here, her teammates are depending on her, and a documentary film crew is tracking her every move.\n\nXPRIZE Rainforest is a race to discover, understand and preserve the health of the world’s richest, densest ecosystems using autonomous technology to catalogue the biodiversity found there. To win the competition’s $10 million purse, teams try to develop the quickest, most complete and most efficient means of identifying species at every level of the rainforest, canopy to floor.\n\nBlue Devil Forest Divers Episode 1\n\nTHE XPRIZE RAINFOREST CHALLENGE IS MORE THAN AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE. Tropical forests are among the most biodiverse places on earth, and they’re quickly disappearing—cleared to make room for agriculture, or mines, or housing developments, or other applications judged to have more value than the standing forest.\n\nBut the services that intact forests provide to society are poorly understood, hard to quantify and nearly impossible to assign monetary value to, and that makes it difficult to make the case for conservation.\n\nBut we’re trying to change that here at the XPRIZE Rainforest competition semifinals in Singapore. By collecting and analyzing data about the species found here, we hope to offer new insights into the complicated, interdependent relationships that exist in the rainforest and the wealth of benefits they provide.\n\nTo advance to the finals, we have to demonstrate our intent and our ability to generate these insights—and that depends wholly on our successful collection of sound recording, photographs, and biological data collected from the rainforest.\n\nWE’RE COMPETING AGAINST 12 OTHER TEAMS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. The XPRIZE judges tell us that the approaches are wildly different across the semifinalist pool, but won’t give details; we have however, heard rumors of robotic dogs that fetch images of native foliage and of new techniques for collecting environmental DNA from the forest floor.\n\nOur team, the Blue Devil Forest Divers, is led by Duke University Associate Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Martin Brooke and Duke Professor of Conservation Ecology Stuart Pimm and takes a drone-based data collection approach. We’ve descended upon Singapore’s Windsor Nature Park with a fleet of 22 drones ranging in size from an eastern box turtle to a giant tortoise.\n\nMost of them are ANAFIs, small vehicles manufactured by the Parrot company, which are packed into hard-shell suitcases the color of nonpareil mint drops. In two table-sized crates, though, wrapped like mummies in swathes of stiff brown hex paper, are the components of the large drones that we call the Mother and the Relay. These drones are unique, both to the competition and to rainforest conservation. They’ve been designed and built from scratch by Duke University students enrolled in Brooke’s Ocean Engineering and Rainforest Engineering classes, each new wave of students squeezing a bit more utility and performance out of the drones every semester.\n\nMother is a hybrid drone that uses a gasoline-powered engine to extend the range that her battery affords. She’s essentially a school bus, ferrying the little battery-powered drones deep into the forest, much farther than they could fly on their own. The other large drone—the Relay—is a hybrid-fueled communications way station that hovers, tethered, above the canopy to listen for messages from Mother and communicate them to researchers on the ground.\n\nThe scheme allows our team to efficiently canvass more of the forest than if we were depending only upon battery power. In the semifinals, the test plot is within throwing distance of a service road, so the large drones aren’t even necessary— the small drones can reach the center of the plot under their own power. But this round of competition is an excellent opportunity for our team to learn how to ship, reassemble and safely fuel the large drones in addition to flying them.\n\nMechanical engineer Juliet O’Riordan assembles sound and insect traps, which will deliver audio recordings and DNA to the team when retrieved.\n\nSINGAPORE IS A DENSELY POPULATED CITY-STATE, AND ITS AIRSPACE IS STRICTLY CONTROLLED. The large drones are therefore subject to extensive airworthiness checks: the ability to display signal strength and failure warnings for each fuel source, to give flight telemetry, to perform a controlled four-minute flight with changing orientation, to communicate an uninterrupted video screen and to land within a designated area.\n\nThe engineers assigned to the large drones soldier through dozens of attempts and recalibrations as the sun rises higher and the open field begins to stream. Mother’s steady chirps are punctuated by the noise of two roosters fighting atop a wall that separates the test field from an adjacent housing block.\n\nJust when it seems the overheated students might give up, Mother suddenly pops into the sky like a kernel of corn. She climbs to around 20 feet and hovers like a dragonfly above the cheering team.\n\nBut the sweet victory is short-lived. Mother falls from the sky on her next flight, coming apart neatly when she hits the ground as she was designed to do. Her motor and electronics can be salvaged this way, and her frame rebuilt back home.\n\nThe engineers attribute the crash to the PID tuning—the software parameters that affect how the flight controller responds to commands—and all agree it could have been corrected with a bit more practice. The wind, or even the weight of the additional zip ties securing the motor to the frame, might have thrown the drone out of balance.\n\nBut a thorough critique will have to wait.\n\nAllison Goehringer and Achilles Dabrowski calibrate the Mother drone.\n\nTHE LARGE DRONE PILOTS, relieved of their vehicles, start registering flights on the small drones. A trio of University of Wisconsin-Madison botanists, led by orchid expert Stephanie Pimm Lyon, hovers over the pilots’ shoulders, directing them to areas of possible interest to photograph. Images of leaves and vines begin pouring in almost immediately, to their gratification. But other groups are waiting on data from two yet-to-be-deployed traps: a recorder that captures birdsong and a sticky insect lure.\n\nWe have two Tupperware containers full of insect bait. One contains slumping chunks of mango and banana whose edges are slowly dissolving into soup. Another is packed with balls of raw pork that have taken on a greenish cast and smell like fish guts. Liquid as dark as swamp water pools at the bottom. These slurries will be irresistible to flies and beetles, sending them careening into the sticky sides of the traps.\n\nDuke biomedical engineering lab administrator Maggie Gatongi and J.A. Jones Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering Nan Jokerst have set up a mobile DNA barcoding lab in the ranger station. They wait with small, high-powered microscopes to photograph the stuck insects—the first step of 14 in their protocol, which will end in a foolproof species ID. In their lab coats and sterile gloves, they double-check and triple-check their procedures as they wait for the first batch of captured insects to arrive.\n\nWhich brings us back to O’Riordan’s hunt for the perfect branch, and the corresponding challenge: there don’t seem to be any good branches, let alone perfect ones, from which to hang an insect trap.\n\nShe and her co-pilot, ECE alum Alex Xu, send numerous drones scouting through the test plot. The vegetation is thick and weedy, and the long, whip-thin branches frequently tangle in the drones’ propellors and send them tumbling to the forest floor. They’ve been lucky so far—if they crashed instead into a treetop or other inaccessible area, the drone couldn’t be retrieved until the end of the competition. In that scenario, the team would lose not only their drone, but also the trap or data it was carrying as well.\n\nALMOST AS QUICKLY AS A SWITCH FLIPPING, HERE NEAR THE EARTH’S EQUATOR – THE PILOTS HAVE CAPTURED 238 IMAGES OF THE RAINFOREST’S PLANT SPECIES. One trap, a bioacoustics recorder, is now hanging on a thick vine, where it will remain overnight to eavesdrop on the early-morning conversations of the waking birds.\n\nDespite this success, pressure is still building. “It is essential that in the morning we place an insect trap inside the valid area,” Brooke urges in a message to the group via WhatsApp. “We’ll take it steady and make it happen,” Xu responds in the thread, to a chorus of heart emojis that pop up from his teammates.\n\nA group of pilots return to the test site at 4 AM after a quick nap. They outfit the drones with thermal cameras, hoping to spot the warm auras of macaques or wild boar through the cool blue canopy—a strategy that had worked well both in Durham and in the jungle of La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica, where the team tested its approach last summer.\n\nThe sun rises on a still rainforest, illuminating only plants and foliage.\n\nAlexandra Rivera, Alex Xu and Juliet O’Riordan are surrounded by a documentary film crew as they fly a drone into the forest.\n\nBROOKE URGES O’RIORDAN TO RETRIEVE THE SOUND RECORDER, BUT SHE AND XU ARE STILL SCANNING ENDLESSLY FOR PERFORATIONS IN THE DENSE FOLIAGE, searching for a place to safely drop an insect trap. We only need one to prove that our DNA barcoding technique works.\n\nAt this critical moment, a safety officer makes an unwelcome announcement: there’s a Category 1 lightning storm approaching, and all flights are grounded until the threat passes. Only six people may remain beneath the tent, so the rest of us scurry up the hill to the ranger station, through the sweltering jungle.\n\nSingapore’s Central Catchment Reserve is essentially an inner-city woodlot. It’s different from mature rainforests, where old emergent trees compose the forest’s crown. Below, the canopy is so dense that it creates shade and a dark, sparse forest floor. Here in Singapore, emergent trees are few and far between, and the canopy below allows much more sunlight to filter down to the forest floor, creating conditions where small plants and shrubs thrive.\n\nIn the mature rainforest, there were innumerable unobstructed branches for O’Riordan to aim for. In Singapore, there are none.\n\nThe lightning warning is lifted just before 11 AM.\n\nPictured left to right: Juliet O’Riordan, Rebecca Schmitt, Lilly Johnson, Alison Korn and Allison Taub register a flight.\n\nTHE DRONE PILOTS IN THE RANGER STATION SPRING BACK TOWARD THE TEST SITE, where O’Riordan and Xu are already initiating their flight plan. Botanist Lilly Johnson is just behind them, carrying a length of red braid made from strips of a plastic biohazard bag.\n\nNo one spares the time to ask questions about this makeshift lanyard; every eye is on O’Riordan as she assembles another insect trap beneath the red tent.\n\nn a last-ditch attempt to collect an insect from the forest, botanist Lilly Johnson prepares to send a drone trailing sticky tape into the trees.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about this team is the latitude that Brooke and Pimm have allowed the students and recent graduates who comprise the team to plan for themselves and make their own decisions. The faculty members provide vision and they provide resources: expert entomologists, large trucks, drone transponders and controllers, portable DNA sequencers, mountains of Malaysian takeout. But apart from assisting with one particularly tricky bit of soldering, Brooke has, until this morning, remained hands-off. It speaks to the pressure the entire team is under that this dynamic has now changed.\n\n“Try to recover the sound recorder,” Brooke urges her.\n\nAs the two confer, Johnson brings a small drone to the table. From a sheet of yellow fly paper, she cuts long strips with the speed and precision of a sous chef and affixes them to the drone with the braided lanyard and runs with it to the top of the test site.\n\nWith just 36 minutes left in the collection period, our pilots have split into two factions, each frantically trying to engineer a win for the entire team.\n\nAt the top of the hill, one group is making a last-ditch attempt to collect an insect sample by dragging a long loop of fly paper through the canopy. At the bottom of the hill, Xu stands in the middle of the narrow service road, lofting a drone above his head, searching for the strongest signal to support O’Riordan’s recovery efforts.\n\nMidflight, O’Riordan and Xu lose their signal and must abandon the attempt. It’s unclear whether the competing flight at the top of the hill is interfering.\n\nBrooke charges up the hill to intervene, and O’Riordan uses the distraction to quietly launch an attempt to retrieve the sound recorder. She knows the spot she wants and aligns herself to the opening she sees; her drone buzzes alongside her. It takes only a minute for the Parrot to reach the sound recorder, and it snaps up the device with a strong magnet and turns back toward the service road, carrying its payload.\n\nEveryone has pivoted their attention back to O’Riordan—our whole team, the safety officers, the XPRIZE staffers and the film crew with their cameras rolling—so everyone hears when the drone starts to go down, making a sound like a weed whacker as it becomes entangled in the undergrowth. The drone and the recorder fall so close to the road that we can see the vehicle’s propellers still fighting valiantly to turn from amidst a nest of vines. Its lights blink orange in a silent SOS.\n\nWE HAVE NO INSECTS. WE HAVE NO SOUND DATA. O’Riordan sinks briefly to the ground, folding in on herself like a paper crane.\n\nThe drone is almost close enough to touch and the urge to simply pluck it from the brush is strong, but the rules of the competition prevent human beings from entering the plot.\n\nOne student commandeers the communications team’s tripod and telescopes its legs to their longest. Another finds a fallen branch taller than he is. Working in tandem, they use the two implements like giant chopsticks and reach for the sound trap. Their jostling separates the drone from the recorder and the precious data slips perilously close to the forest floor.\n\nThere is absolutely no way this will work.\n\nBut they somehow flip the device out of the thicket and onto the dirt between the road and the brush, where it’s fair game.\n\nA doctoral student in Pimm’s group snatches the sound recorder and scampers away to download the data, quick as a macaque with a contraband protein bar.\n\nThe flypaper, meanwhile, is dotted with tiny specks of dark matter that appear to be nothing, but an XPRIZE staffer documents the time and location of the collection anyway, just as the clock runs out. Jokerst and Gatongi examine the loop of sticky tape under the compact microscopes they’ve brought from Duke, methodically zooming in on one amorphous blob after another.\n\nThen, there it is, swimming up through the microscope’s light and into sharp focus against the yellow tape: a segmented abdomen and a pair of translucent wings.\n\nBUT THE NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE HAS OFFERED SPACE IN ONE OF ITS WET LABS FOR THE COMPETITORS TO PERFORM DNA AND eDNA ANALYSIS, so Gatongi and Jokerst shift into high gear to prepare our single sample for processing.\n\nThe collection period ended at full boil, but Gatongi is an island of cool. In the NUS wet lab, she is perfectly at home; she has taught hundreds of students to perform the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, protocol that she now initiates.\n\nMaggie Gatongi use photos to document a captured insect before preparing it for DNA barcoding.\n\nShe and Jokerst turn their results over to a recent biomedical engineering alum at 1 AM. It takes another three hours for him to run the DNA sequence on a base caller and name the insect: Scirtothrips dorsalus, a species of invasive thrip. The DNA ID confirms the visual one made by renowned entomologist Roger Kitching.\n\nTo the terabytes of data collected by the team, this small, precious bit of information is added. It’s proof that the DNA barcoding technique works and could be applied on a bigger scale in the finals of the competition.\n\nBrooke emails the team’s final report to XPRIZE. There are 63 unique taxa the team identified in the competition using photo, audio and DNA identification methods. The species richness of the rainforest plot has been described, and heat tree diagrams show how each individual species fits into the whole. From the chaos of the competition, an ordered snapshot of the rainforest’s biodiversity has emerged.\n\nNan Jokerst use photos to document a captured insect before preparing it for DNA barcoding.\n\nThe team disperses to all corners of the globe — to South Africa, to study the fragmentation of elephant populations; to new jobs in the forestry service and existing ones at Microsoft; to internships at Apple; to deserved vacations. But they still steal time to pore over the footage of Mother’s crash, looking for clues to inform her next incarnation and make her more resilient, and to troll iNaturalist after hours to see how the other teams fared at their plant identification task and to work out the odds of our team making it to the finals.\n\nSeveral weeks later, at the International Congress for Conservation Biology in Kigali, Rwanda, the XPRIZE Foundation announces the finalists.\n\nTHE SIX TEAMS WITH THE HIGHEST SPECIES COUNT ADVANCE. The Blue Devil Forest Divers are not among them.\n\nThe shock of the news is like being blanched in an ice water bath. But the team rallies to thank one another and prepares to pass the baton. Only four undergraduate students on the team will return to Duke in the fall.\n\nBrooke has competed in five different XPRIZE competitions now and says that managing the constant turnover is the biggest challenge—but Duke’s participation isn’t driven by winning, it’s driven by the university’s educational mission. More than 200 students have contributed their time and effort to this project, and many more will have the opportunity in the coming years. They learn and apply technical skills, but they also learn to manage complex logistical challenges, team dynamics and their own expectations.\n\nBrooke is teaching Ocean Engineering in the fall and students in the class will be rebuilding the large drones and outfitting them for long-range ocean device delivery. Brooke imagines that there might be an ocean-focused XPRIZE competition in the near future and if there is, Duke will take a swing at it.”\n\n“We did everything we set out to do,” says Brooke. “We had great opportunities for students in classes to work on authentic projects, and we got to test many of our technologies in rainforest environments. Things went better than I had hoped for, in many ways.

Duke’s graduate and professional schools — in business, divinity, engineering, the environment, law, medicine, nursing and public policy — are among the leaders in their fields. Duke’s home campus is situated on nearly 9,000 acres in Durham, N.C, a city of more than 200,000 people. Duke also is active internationally through the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore, Duke Kunshan University in China and numerous research and education programs across the globe. More than 75 percent of Duke students pursue service-learning opportunities in Durham and around the world through DukeEngage and other programs that advance the university’s mission of “knowledge in service to society.”\n\nDuke University is a private research university in Durham, North Carolina. Founded by Methodists and Quakers in the present-day town of Trinity in 1838, the school moved to Durham in 1892. In 1924, tobacco and electric power industrialist James Buchanan Duke established The Duke Endowment and the institution changed its name to honor his deceased father, Washington Duke.\n\nThe campus spans over 8,600 acres (3,500 hectares) on three contiguous sub-campuses in Durham, and a marine lab in Beaufort. The West Campus—designed largely by architect Julian Abele, an African American architect who graduated first in his class at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design—incorporates Gothic architecture with the 210-foot (64-meter) Duke Chapel at the campus’ center and highest point of elevation, is adjacent to the Medical Center. East Campus, 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) away, home to all first-years, contains Georgian-style architecture. The university administers two concurrent schools in Asia, Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore (established in 2005) and Duke Kunshan University in Kunshan, China (established in 2013).\n\nDuke is ranked among the top universities in the United States. The undergraduate admissions are among the most selective in the country, with an overall acceptance rate of 5.7% for the class of 2025. Duke spends more than $1 billion per year on research, making it one of the ten largest research universities in the United States. More than a dozen faculty regularly appear on annual lists of the world’s most-cited researchers. As of 2019, 15 Nobel laureates and 3 Turing Award winners have been affiliated with the university. Duke alumni also include 50 Rhodes Scholars, 25 Churchill Scholars, 13 Schwarzman Scholars, and 8 Mitchell Scholars. The university has produced the third highest number of Churchill Scholars of any university (behind Princeton University and Harvard University) and the fifth-highest number of Rhodes, Marshall, Truman, Goldwater, and Udall Scholars of any American university between 1986 and 2015. Duke is the alma mater of one president of the United States (Richard Nixon) and 14 living billionaires.\n\nDuke is the second-largest private employer in North Carolina, with more than 39,000 employees. The university has been ranked as an excellent employer by several publications.\n\nResearch\n\nDuke’s research expenditures in the 2018 fiscal year were $1.168 billion, the tenth largest in the U.S. In fiscal year 2019 Duke received $571 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health. Duke is classified among “R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity”.\n\nThroughout the school’s history, Duke researchers have made breakthroughs, including the biomedical engineering department’s development of the world’s first real-time, three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostic system and the first engineered blood vessels and stents. In 2015, Paul Modrich shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 2012, Robert Lefkowitz along with Brian Kobilka, who is also a former affiliate, shared the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on cell surface receptors.

The new approach opens up more of the genome for editing, enabling the repair of mutations associated with more diseases.\n\nCredit: Cell Chemical Biology (2023).\n\n“CRISPR is great, but there are a lot of places within the human genome that can’t be edited well,” said senior author Bruce Sullenger, Ph.D., the Joseph W. and Dorothy W. Beard Distinguished Professor of Experimental Surgery at Duke University School of Medicine. Sullenger is also a professor in the departments of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Neurosurgery, Cell Biology and Biomedical Engineering.\n\n“This work started from ground zero to understand and address that issue using large libraries of different CRISPR RNAs as well as informatics to see if we could get these editing tools to more places in the genome so that they can be edited and repaired as needed,” Sullenger said.\n\nSullenger and colleagues — notably first author Korie Bush, Ph.D., who launched the study as a graduate student in Sullenger’s lab — sought to improve the process CRISPR relies on to guide RNA to the right location on DNA and facilitate the deletion or repair in that region.\n\nMore often than not, the guide, which is an RNA molecule, presents a problem — it may not fold exactly right or it’s otherwise corrupted, so the editing or deletion process cannot occur. Typically when that happens, the guide RNA must be swapped out for a new one and the genome cannot be targeted in the right spot.\n\nThe Duke team instead found a way to salvage a dysfunctional guide RNA, which actually has two components that have to work well together: an RNA sequence that recognizes the DNA target site and a scaffolding sequence that holds the enzyme in place to cleave the DNA at the right juncture.\n\nThey found multiple RNA sequences that revived the integrity of the scaffolding, demonstrating that CRISPR gene editing technology is much more adaptable than previously believed.\n\n“We found lots of ways to change the system that yield combinations with enhanced editing efficiencies at various target sites,” Bush said. “The process is more malleable than we thought – we made hundreds of thousands of guide RNAs. If you need two pieces for the process to work well and you have so many more options to choose from, you can find a combination that works best.”\n\nSullenger said the finding should lead to safer and more effective ways of applying CRISPR technology as a therapy.\n\n“This is like an improvement in word processing that enables you to easily find and edit any error in the text, rather than only being able to edit certain portions of a text effectively,” Sullenger said. “Especially when coupled with informatics, it should lead to an acceleration of breakthroughs for treating diseases.”\n\nIn addition to Sullenger and Bush, study authors include Giulia Corsi, Amy C. Yan, Keith Haynes, Juliana M. Layzer, Jonathan H. Zhou, Telmo Llanga, and Jan Gorodkin.\n\nThe research received support from the National Institutes of Health (UG3 TR002852), the Independent Research Foundation Denmark (9041-00317B) and the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF21OC0068988).\n\nCell Chemical Biology\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

Everest, the highest peak.\n\nIt litters our landscapes, contaminates our soil, overflows our landfills, and is accumulating at alarming rates in our rivers and oceans.\n\nAnd it’s not just our environment and the animals that live there that are at risk.\n\nHumans face growing risks, too.\n\nMicroplastics and nanoplastics—specks of plastic so small they can be invisible to the eye—are in our air, our drinking water, our food. With every breath we take or every bite we eat, we’re taking them into our bodies.\n\nRecent research suggests the average person consumes up to a credit card’s worth of plastic this way each week. Over time, all this plastic can build up in our bodies and pose health threats we’re only beginning to understand, though there’s already a growing body of evidence linking this long-term exposure to neurodevelopmental and reproductive disorders, obesity, cancer and other ills.\n\nVideo: Plastic Pollution: A Global Issue\n\nEarth’s climate is also feeling the heat.\n\nThat’s because up to 99% of all plastic is made using crude oil, natural gas, or other fossil fuel-derived products. When manufacturers burn these fossil fuels to make the plastic, they emit roughly 400 million tons of climate-warming greenhouse gases into Earth’s atmosphere each year. That’s more than is emitted annually by all sources in the United Kingdom.\n\nAnd yet, we keep producing and using more plastic every year while only recycling about 9% of it.\n\nWe’re on an unsustainable course. But it’s not too late to find a better way forward.\n\nAnd that, said Zoie Diana, is where Duke University’s Plastic Pollution Working Group (PPWG) comes in.\n\nBlazing a New Path\n\nDiana, who recently earned her PhD in marine science and conservation from Duke’s Nicholas School of the Environment, co-founded the interdisciplinary working group in 2017 with faculty members Meagan Dunphy-Daly, John Virdin, Dan Rittschof, Michelle Nowlin and Jason Somarelli, who hold appointments at the Nicholas School, the Duke Law School, the Duke School of Medicine and the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability.\n\n“It struck us that the best way to tackle an issue as complex and multi-faceted as plastic pollution was to bring together interdisciplinary teams of scholars who could pool their expertise to shed new light on the problem, identify new avenues for exploration, and work toward new and more equitable solutions,” Diana said. “There was no existing group at Duke doing that, so we started our own.”\n\nToday, the group has more than 50 members from 12 Duke schools and academic units, including doctoral, masters and undergraduate students who work side by side with faculty and postdocs on research, policy analysis and educational outreach projects.\n\nMembers come from a broad range of fields, including environmental toxicology, business, medicine, public policy, engineering, law, bioinformatics, marine conservation, environmental justice, history, chemistry, resource and environmental management, and the arts. In many cases, they’ve never worked together before.\n\nVideo: Plastic Solutions: A Global Response\n\nInitial funding for the group came from a Pre-Catalyst Grant from the Nicholas Institute. Current funding comes from an Intellectual Community Planning Grant from Duke Interdisciplinary Studies.\n\nIn addition to creating a space where scholars from diverse disciplines can come together to brainstorm and collaborate, the PPWG team organizes seminars, panel discussions and other educational outreach events that are open to the broader campus community.\n\n“There’s a high level of concern about finding a sustainable alternative to single-use plastics and about plastic pollution in general. So, it’s important that we get accurate and timely information out so people understand what’s being done about the problem, what still needs to be done, and how they can get involved,” said Dunphy-Daly, associate dean for experiential education and undergraduate research at the Nicholas School.\n\nThere’s sometimes a misperception on issues like plastic pollution that you need to be a scientist, an engineer, or a policy expert to help move the needle in the right direction, Dunphy-Daly said. But one current project by a PPWG member leverages the storytelling expertise of Master of Fine Arts student Laura Asherman to help engage the public in the effort to reduce plastic use—in this case by creating a film about microplastics. Called “The Dumpster Dive”, told from the viewpoint of cockroaches who are elated that microplastics may turn out to be the silver bullet that finally eradicates their species’ archnemesis—humans—from Earth. The film, which features PPWG members Anna Lewis and Imari Walker-Franklin, premiered April 7 at Duke’s Nasher Museum of Art.\n\n“That’s the beauty of having an interdisciplinary focus,” Diana said. “You can tap into all kinds of expertise and achieve things you might not have been able to achieve otherwise.”\n\nVideo: The Future of Plastic Research\n\nMoving the Needle\n\nAlthough it’s still far too soon to assess PPWG’s long-term impacts, its members—faculty and students alike—have achieved some impressive accomplishments so far.\n\nOver the last two years, working group sub-teams have published five peer-reviewed papers that are helping shed light on the causes and consequences of plastic pollution and on potential solutions for it. Individual members of the group have contributed to additional papers, as well.\n\nTopics have included emerging technologies to prevent and collect marine plastic debris; the role bioengineering could play in forging a plastic-free future; the impact nanoplastics have on aquatic animals and ecosystems at nearly every level of biological function; and a new framework for estimating the costs of marine plastic pollution interventions.\n\nOther topics covered are the impacts (or lack therein) of voluntary corporate pledges to reduce plastic use; the inequitable distribution of plastic benefits and burdens on global and local economies and public health; and the effectiveness (or lack therein) of different global policies aimed at curbing single-use plastics and pollution.\n\nOngoing research by PPWG members suggests the flow of innovative studies will not dry up anytime soon. Jason Somarelli, assistant professor of medicine, and his team are working to develop new enzymes and microbial systems to degrade plastic. Marc Deshusses, professor of civil and environmental engineering, is working to create sustainable processes to convert non-recyclable plastic waste into energy. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n“I like to think of the Plastic Pollution Working Group as an incubator for new ideas and new approaches,” said Diana, whose doctoral dissertation was on multisector mitigation of single-use plastic pollution. “It’s been extremely rewarding to bring these brilliant minds from different disciplinary backgrounds t"
