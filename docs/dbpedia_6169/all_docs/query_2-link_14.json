REMM information is meant to supplement principles of good clinical management.\n\nRecommendations for any patient's medical care should consider not only the specific circumstances of that patient but also the resources available during the emergency.\n\nInclusion of any bibliographic reference on REMM does not constitute official US government endorsement of its contents, data and/or conclusions. Inclusion in a REMM reference list may be simply to facilitate consideration and understanding of the complexities of that topic.\n\nReference in this Web site to any specific commercial product, process, service, manufacturer, or company does not constitute its endorsement or recommendation by the U.S. government or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or any of its agencies.

It represents one part of the ten publications from this group.\n\nThe Tool provides suggestions but not formal guidelines or mandates.\n\nClinicians are urged to consider the specifics of every patient individually and the conditions (scarcity, danger, existing standards of care) where the patient is evaluated when making triage and cytokine recommendations.\n\nThe Tool should always be used in conjunction with appropriate clinical judgment about each patient.\n\nThe Tool has not been approved for clinical use by the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nSee also the Medical Disclaimer for the entire REMM web site which also applies to this Scarce Resources Triage Tool.\n\nSpecific Advice on Medical and Other Queries from Our Users\n\nREMM will not offer any official medical advice or recommendations about specific patients sent to our Contact Us Email.\n\nREMM will not offer any official advice or recommendations to individuals or groups about specific equipment, devices, calculations, or plans sent to our Contact Us Email.\n\n`\n\ntop of page\n\nUsing REMM Assets\n\nUnless otherwise noted, material presented on the REMM Web site is considered federal government information and is in the public domain.\n\nThat means this information may be freely copied and distributed.
