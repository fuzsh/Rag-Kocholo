ORISE is hosting the second annual ORISE Postdoc Mini Symposium—open to all ORISE participants, alumni, and mentors as well as federal agency staff and National Postdoctoral Association (NPA) members.\n\nORISE recognizes the crucial role that mentors play in the personal and professional development of the next generation of STEM. These videos feature a few of our mentors across the federal departments and agencies that offer internships and fellowships through ORISE who were gracious enough to talk about their experiences and expertise. The stories they tell offer a glimpse of the inspiration they instill, their commitment to life-long learning, and their passion for “shaping the future of science.”"
