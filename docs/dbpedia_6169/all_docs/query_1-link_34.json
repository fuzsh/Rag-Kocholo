        "text": "Meet a Current Scot\n\nColby Huffman\n\nHometown: Sevierville, Tennessee\n\nWhen he’s not on the field playing soccer for the Maryville College Scots, William “Colby” Huffman keeps busy in the lab. He’s active in the Scots Science Scholars Program, the American Chemical Society (ACS) and Tri-Beta (BBB). In addition, he serves as a lab assistant in the Biochemistry program, a Scots Science Scholars peer mentor and as an ambassador for the MC Admissions team.\n\n“I have a passion for helping as many people as possible, which has led me to my desire to become a doctor,” he said. “While at Maryville College, all the professors have pushed, motivated and encouraged me to pursue my big dreams. Through the challenging courses, I discovered a strong interest in chemistry and biology, which led me to declare my major in Biochemistry. I plan to use my incredible experiences like working in Dr. (Angelia) Gibson’s biochemistry lab to help me apply for Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), apply for M.D. and Ph.D. programs, and become a surgeon one day.”\n\nMeet a Recent Grad\n\nJulia Warrick ’21\n\nCurrently: Ph.D. student (Biomedical Sciences) at The Ohio State University\n\nAs an MC student, Julia was a Scots Science Scholar and worked as a tutor in the STEM Success Center. She also served as a lab assistant and as a supplemental instruction leader for biochemistry and molecular biology courses.\n\n“MC prepared me for graduate school with in-depth classes and labs that taught many of the scientific concepts and lab techniques that I have needed to know so far in grad school,” she said. “I think my Senior Study prepared me the most for graduate school because it allowed me to learn different lab techniques and it gave me the independence to learn how to design my own experiments, how to manage my time to meet deadlines, and how to adequately write about and present my work.”"
