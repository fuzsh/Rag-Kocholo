The fastest way to reach the University Partnerships Office is via email at university.partnerships@orau.org.\n\nOpportunity to Host/Deliver Webinar for DoD’s Information Analysis Centers – NEW\n\nThe DoD Information Analysis Centers (IAC): Cybersecurity and Information Systems (CSIAC), Defense Systems (DSIAC), and Homeland Defense and Security (HDIAC) host/deliver webinars each month. ORAU is assisting the IACs in identifying subject matter experts who might be interested in conducting a brief webinar beginning March and beyond.\n\nThe webinars are on DoD science and technology topics that draw hundreds of those in the larger DoD Research and Engineering (R&E) community. These webinars are intended to provide an awareness to the DoD R&E community about technical work or innovations with the goal of fostering collaboration, mitigating redundant work efforts, and stimulating innovation. The webinars are conducted as 30-minute presentations followed by about 15 minutes of Q&A. They are very convenient and well-attended. The IAC can either host the presentations in a public distribution venue or in a limited distribution (CUI) venue, specifically using DoD MS Teams.\n\nYou can take a look at some of the previous and upcoming webinar presentations at: https://dsiac.org/webinars/, https://csiac.org/webinars/, https://hdiac.org/webinars/. If you have a topic you’d like to deliver as a webinar presentation, please let us know. For topics related to DSIAC, brian.benesch@dsiac.org; for HDIAC topics, contact john.clements@hdiac.org; and for CSIAC topics, contact Philip.payne@csiac.org.\n\nORAU\n\nResearch and University Partnerships Office (RUPO)\n\nUniversity.partnerships@orau.org\n\nwww.orau.org\n\nORAU provides innovative scientific and technical solutions to advance research and education, protect public health and the environment, and strengthen national security.
