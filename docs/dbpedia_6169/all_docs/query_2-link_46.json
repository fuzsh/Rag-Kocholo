        "text": "OAK RIDGE, Tenn.â€” The Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS) in Oak Ridge, Tenn., welcomes three new team members: John Crapo, Josh Hayes and David Quillin.\n\nJohn Crapo joins the team as a part-time health physicist after retiring from the National Nuclear Security Administration, where he served as a program manager in the Office of Nuclear Incident Response. Prior to that, Crapo spent nine years with Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) working on its flagship contract, the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education, serving as associate director for its national security programs. His experience also includes 26 years of active duty in the U.S. Navy, serving as a nuclear engineering technician and radiation specialist, retiring at the rank of lieutenant commander.\n\nCrapo earned his bachelorâ€™s degree in radiological health physics at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell; his masterâ€™s degree in health physics at Georgetown University; and a masterâ€™s degree in environmental health from the School of Public Health, Harvard University. Crapo is certified in the Comprehensive Practice of Health Physics by the American Board of Health Physics, serves as the president of Clarksburg Community Assistance Network and is the executive administrator at Cedarbrook Community Church, Clarksburg, Md.\n\nJosh Hayes, Ph.D, joins the team as a health physicist. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a defense specialist and spent most of his enlistment stationed in Okinawa, Japan, where he was able to respond to the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. That experience led Josh to pursue goals in studying radiological sciences.\n\nHayes holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in biomedical sciences, a masterâ€™s degree in health physics and a doctorate degree in radiological health from Colorado State University (CSU). While working at CSU, he had the opportunity to travel several times for extended stays to Fukushima, Japan, to work with wildlife biologists and veterinarians, studying the impacts the environmentally dispersed radiation from the Fukushima nuclear disaster was having on wildlife. Specifically, he studied the hematological system of wild boar and field mice, which lead him to ORAU in 2018 for a summer internship. Following completion of his doctorate degree in 2020, Hayes moved to Vienna, Austria, to work for the International Atomic Energy Agency as a radiobiologist and biodosimetrist. In his spare time, he enjoys running the trails at Frozen Head State Park.\n\nDavid Quillin comes to REAC/TS as a nurse. Most recently Quillin worked as an occupational health nurse at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Prior to that, he worked as a critical care nurse at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center while also working with the Knox County Sheriffâ€™s Office as a reserve patrol officer. In addition to nursing, Quillin brings with him many years of law enforcement experience. He holds a bachelorâ€™s degree in nursing from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and a masterâ€™s degree in business administration from the University of Kentucky.\n\nAbout REAC/TS\n\nREAC/TS is an Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education facility managed by ORAU for the U.S. Department of Energy with the mission to strengthen the medical response to radiological and nuclear incidents.
